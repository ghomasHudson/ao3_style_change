Steve’s mind goes blank, he’s too far away to help her. He’s a supersoldier, he can crush her windpipe with a finger. If only he had something to throw at him. Like a shield. If only he had a shield.
They say she took it too seriously, she couldn’t take a joke. She was too small and weak, so she’d be asked to leave any day now. Eliminations didn’t start until year fourteen, but despite being nine, she was placed three years ahead of her age.
“There’s no way you could keep a lower profile Brynn. You haven’t done anything tabloid worthy in years.”
“I plan on keeping it that way.” She grips the underside of the bar, and whips out a small silver pistol, “You should’ve stayed dead.”
She snuck a quick peek over her shoulder as she loaded her few things into the car waiting for her outside, and saw Madame waiting in the foyer, almost out of view.
Steve helped, he went on missions, but always accompanied her to galas and fundraisers. He put up with her waking at three in the morning to start working on a project that came to her in the night.
She whipped her head around, the blue alien seemed annoyed, she struggled to her feet, “Does it matter what he thinks anymore? He blew away in the fucking wind.”
“And you really don’t want my scrubs in your machine.” She jokingly continued, “I just finished a rotation in the infectious disease ward, so.”
-June 4th this is a funny and terribly sad reference. In 2018 twitter dubbed June 4th national amnesia day, after a joke on the Simpsons that ‘nothing happened in Tiananmen Square’ which is a call back to the Tiananmen Square protests in China in 1989. The protests were enormous, but the protesters were shot at and mowed down by tanks, by order of the Chinese government, who didn’t want to give the people political freedom. While this isn’t a direct tie to what the chapter is about, amnesia or the recovery from it, it’s important to remember and be thankful for the freedoms we have. Toni actually grew up in a similar climate, with no freedom or free speech, and communist Russia was also a very hard place to live, so I guess it ties together better than I’d thought.
Lucie Steele was true to her name, Steele and sharp, but not pointy and mean sharp, intelligent, complex, and in the end even though her actions made no sense, Toni could understand why she did what she did.
The pilot gives her a cordial wave as she jumps off the aircraft, and wastes no time taking off again.
“They should. Sometimes I hope they do. But I’ve been given a unique opportunity. I’ve been trained to do this all my life.”
The day after the award show, Annie walked into school just as usual, and sat nearby them, they seemed to be talking normally about some boy in their class, and how hot he was, and when Annie agreed passively not even sure with boy they were talking about, Eryn, the unofficial leader of the group said,
“I don’t want to go to anymore award shows, they’ll just make fun of me!” Her voice cracked every other word but she choked out her concerns,
Toni rolled her eyes. Was this it? She was pressuring her to practically kill herself for fear of being outed as crazy?
“It was four months.” She repeated, “I was being chased by three SUVs, and a fourth hit me head on. There were no survivors. Not the drivers of the other cars, not our daughter. And certainly not me.”
“The baby could be injured, and it won't survive delivery at this point, without this surgery, you’ll both die.” She looks up to see a young man in a white coat. It’s the first time she’s seen the doctor. He’s blonde and his blue are are all to familiar. “No.” She tries, but it comes out as a wheeze, “You’re not of sound mind and your emergency contact gave consent.”
However, after sending an agent late last year, whose mission was to seduce her, and convince her to run away with him, it was revealed Manya wasn’t interested in men at all. And so, incomes Anya.
In a flurry of movement, all the girls shed their plaid skirts and button up shirts, and slipped on the black leotard, it pulled at Toni’s thighs in an uncomfortable way, and she saw other girls picked at the hemline of theirs too.
“Tell me your story. Just like Nika. Tell me what happened and put me out of my misery. Don’t let Eva get this. Don’t let her win.”
She pauses a moment, then laughing she says, “Black mail? How sweet. It’s been a while since I’ve been blackmailed, you make an old woman feel young again.”
He walks down the halls with purpose, and never pauses a moment to consider which identical corridor to take, he must be familiar with this place. He ignores the questions she pesters him with for the rest of their walk. Finally, she follows him silently, till he stops outside a large set of wooden doors.
She didn’t know where they were going, though she recognized each hallway. She recounted classes, and lessons as she past rooms filled with girls and Instructors.
He’s so distracted he almost doesn’t see the soldier coming from the side with a machine gun, but he cocks his shield in time.
She mumbles code into her walkie talkie, and Steve can make out is someone on the other end asking for the shooter's status. He’d forgotten all about him, he pauses “Tell them I’m in pursuit.”
It’s about five months before Toni’s plan is set into motion. Sasha’s too weary of her right after stealing her laptop, but over right before April break, on Sasha’s birthday, she receives a large computer, not a laptop like Toni. A desk computer that takes up most workspace on the tables given to students. But Sasha loves it, so Toni hacks it.
She walked down the streets for a few miles before she could hail a cab. It was a miracle that the mansion hosting the party was completely secluded from the city, or she would have been stranded.
“Stark.” She looked up, the drivers’ seat door was mostly ripped off, so she could see a man in black, covered in glass and blood standing above her, “This is for Captain America. Long live the revolution, let the Accords die!” he yelled, and Toni took his hesitation to rip her pistol from her jeans. She squeezed her eyes shut and jammed the trigger just a few times, but the silence between shots felt like years. He fell face first onto the glass surrounding her.
But Antoinette turned around unfazed, even comforted in her routine of rejection, because at least she could count on it.
She’d won the match, Petra knew it. But she still squirmed under her tight hold as if getting free would be enough to win.
Her dreams kept shifting, the more she concentrated on each image, the further away they flew. She was out of breath like she’d been running for a long time, but she wasn’t going anywhere.
The rest of the day Toni numbs herself. She goes through classes like a vegetable, answer only a few questions, and trying to ignore the whispers of her classmates.
“Steve! Less flirting more fighting!” Sam cries out taking to the sky to support Nat as she starts to attack the soldier, and disarms him.
Not that she lived at the tower, she lives with Pepper in a aparment a block away. She used to anyways. Until Pepper told her she couldn’t handle her girlfriend being in constant danger. She said she was leaving, but not leaving Toni. Basically we can still be friends, but in different words.
“Antonia.” She says, which surprises her, first names are rarely exchanged, mostly last names or in Toni’s case, убийца, монстр, демон. Murderer, monster, demon.
Toni’s working theory is that she just breathes between glares. She was right though, all twelve dresses hung up in front of her were of the same color, similar fabrics, and basic cuts, she just couldn’t decided. What a problem to have, deciding which fancy dress to wear to a fancy party Toni doesn’t even fancy being at.
Her unwillingness to take their bait left them agitated and bored, something she knew she’d pay for in the morning.
“And SHIELDs,” Pierce adds, “If you do this, none of your past can remain hidden. Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you? As you really are.”
Toni sunk from her knees, she leaned against the wall crying, “Please don’t hurt me, please, I didn’t want to, I didn’t want to, he made me!”
He throws the shield to the ground and wraps the other hand around Amanda, who tries to break his grip furiously, but can only kick her legs. Then in one fluid motion, she throws her leg over his hands and neck and pushed off him.
“Oh yeah, no prob. I was just-” she paused, she didn’t know why she kept that project alive other than spitting Howard by doing what he couldn’t, but she wasn’t about to tell him that, “doing the right thing. Of course we didn’t really expect you be alive.”
Katya took two or three before she started to try and block, but she couldn’t land any hits. It wasn’t long till she fell to the ground. Toni couldn’t let her up again, she’d be punished, so she leaned over Katya and held her down against the mat.
“But I’ll be eighteen when the baby’s born, if it’s born in July like expected, I turn eighteen in May.”
What’s another bomb in her heart? The worst part was the cell she was locked in, the room was all too similar to those of the programs.
She stormed out of the room knocking over one of Lucette’s suitcases. Lucette just stared at her in confusion, “What’s her deal?”
“Hardly.” Madame said, “She was the one who told me about Nika’s likes. You were found of that one weren’t you?”
Annie probably could have stayed at the school if Maria wasn’t in Turks and Caicos and could be reached, if Father cared at all, or if Annie agreed to apologize, but she was, he didn’t, and she wouldn’t. So she changed schools within the month tried to forget about Evelyn.
Toni glanced at the mats, not returning her banter, and Petra groaned in frustration. It’d become a game to try to get a reaction out of Toni since last week. Spilling food on her, tripping her in the halls, and hiding her uniforms was just some of their favorite methods of torment.
“Hey.” She starts preparing cheerios, trying not to notice how fucking ripped he is. Does he still have to work out? Or does the serum just keep him completly jacked?
She fell suddenly, her knees hurt from the force of her fall. Steve gripped her arms to steady her, and she managed to send him a smirk before all the lights went out.
“How do you know that?” Natasha says, grabbing the paper, “I looked this over ten times, it looked like an office building.”
“Ms. Orlov, if you ever plan to go on a successful mission, I suggest you at least attempt to mask your atrocious accent.” She replied
She falls right to the ground gasping but the Bucky recovers faster, he stands quickly and looks at Steve. He just stares.
Toni nodded, it was the most extreme version yet, but she had the advantage. She’d been on twice as many missions as them combined, some of which were in similar conditions. Maybe she could hide for a while and let them tire themselves out.
Anya Sokolov was set to inherit an enormous wealth. Daughter of some elusive oil company’s CEO, and has been homeschooled for her entire childhood, this party was her unofficial introduction to society.
“Hey Vanessa, this is Toni.” Vanessa nodded towards her before saying, “Call me Van, my parents hate when I say that but Vanessa is so stuffy.”
While she’d been thinking, one of the cars behind her had pulled up, and was getting dangerously close, she unthinkingly bent down to dodge bullets, right as she crashed into the car blocking her.
Toni’s train of thought was interrupted by a particularly loud wail, and Toni groaned quietly to herself. She stood up and ambled towards the girl awkwardly. She didn’t look up, and only acknowledged Toni’s presence when she sat down before her.
Toni still wore the dress she’d worn to Maximiliano’s funeral just hours ago. Her hair is curled perfectly, and her makeup is flawless, she still feels like an idiot for being so dressed up.
“No. I’ve been here for a while. Besides, that’s your private information. If you wanted me to know, you’d tell me.”
They’d both chosen directions aiming away from the mansion, so they figured if they walked in that direction long enough, they find the fence.
The black car approached slowly, and a slim man exited the car. He walked calmly towards them and Toni slumped back to the ground.
They set her down and clamped both her shoulders to the back, while forcing the arm restraints around her wrists.
Jarvis replaced Francesca, Maria hired him, not Father. Annie saw a pattern, whenever Father hired someone, they were young and female and left rather quickly, with the exception of Francesca, but whenever Maria hired someone, they were older, not exclusively male but might as well have been, and they always died before Maria or Father could fire them, with the exception of Jarvis.
“You may go now. I expect you here bright and early before roll call tomorrow to apologize to Ms. Shvets and Ms. Petrov.”
“Yeah probably. Maybe you should go it’s getting kind of late.” She looks at the clock, if Lucette is coming today, she’ll be here before lights out, and it’s almost eight.
Steve grabs her hand and she continues, “I know Barnes was as much as a puppet as I was. I’m not mad at him anymore. But I can’t let Pierce get away with this. I have to shut the Red Room down.”
“I mean, I’m obviously not going to be the final candidate.” Nika says, “I was chosen from my town. My parents wanted to send my brother Dima to school. They were given a fair amount for me, my sister was less lucky.”
Neither women had IDs, just super singing well-made wigs, and high tech masks that projected board members faces’ on their own, the real members had been captured and relocated in a SHIELD base nearby. Every time a security guard came close to them as if to question them, Natasha shot them a look of pure loathing.
In mere moments, they stopped, a dark hallway with a broken light stood between them and courtyard, which held the gallows. The guard's closed in on them, and Koila switched to silent weeping.
“What the-” she started, across from her sat two men in suits, giving her a severe look that said, go ahead. Try and run, give us an excuse to shoot you.
Toni slowly scooted out from behind the table, and stepped over the boxes, almost silently. Good thing Eva was so distracted by whoever had been shot, Toni easily snuck up behind her and grabbed the gun.
“I’m Jason Leonards and this is Carly Vespice and we’ve gone through almost every look to grace the 1992 Oscar’s carpet last night, except maybe the most controversial. Jodie Foster, won for Best Actress last night, her fourth nomination and second win. She wore a pale pink suit with a little red ribbon, but we aren’t here to talk about what she wore on her, we’re talking about who she wore with her!”
They were late, just a little. But enough to get a scolding from the Instructor and a glib look from Tania and her pack of ghouls.
“Are you sure about that because I don’t remeber putting any useless robots into production recently.”
She blinked, “You’re on the run from almost every government on Earth. You don’t have a job, or a home.”
They get to the street when the alarms started blaring, Koila tenses, but Toni says, “Don’t worry, we’re actually early. I was expecting them to notice as we were getting out.”
She let herself space out and she even considered crying later that day, but then she caught Sasha’s eye.
They didn’t suspect her for being a traitor. She had a reputation as the most successful asset yet. They wouldn’t see it coming, and they wouldn’t notice her leaving.
The monotony of living life during the day and working at night took its toll. She imagined this is what the Red Room might have felt like if she was alone and it was smaller. More claustrophobic if that was possible.
It’s so rudimentary, she doesn’t even have to break into Sasha’s room over April break. Sasha went home, along with almost every other student, but Toni’s never been invited back to her house over break, on the brief chat with Maria, she’s told to keep safe at school over break.
“Don’t do that!” He says, she gets her jeans on and starts out the door, “I’m not the bad guy here! I just liked what we have, and you can’t commit to being Iron Maiden or Toni Stark, how can you commit to a relationship?” He catches her arm on her way out the door, turning her back to him.
“About us.” She says shortly, she sits up and wraps the sheets around her, before leaning back on the headboard to see his reaction, when he doesn’t reply, she continues, “Us dating.”
“Commandos? And Peggy and Howard?” Steve shakes his head, “Not much, just if there were alive or not.”
“Hmm? Oh yeah, be right there, hold up for me, mmk?” Howard said standing up and walking to the back bathroom, only lulling to the left slightly.
Toni didn’t reply, so she continued, “What about Petra? Katya? Or was this how you did it to Tania?”
Would the girls make fun of her for getting beaten like this? Could she handle their taunts this time around?
Svetlana squirmed and cried for a moment, gripping her injured wrist, when Tania crouched over her, and started punching her in the face.
Losing Lucie is incomparable to pain Toni’s felt before. She has felt pain, plenty of times but crying about this seems ridiculous and weak. Toni’s knows’ she’s made of diamonds.
But she did it, after submitting to a full psychological evaluation, they had no more excuses. And she became the CEO.
In the meantime, they had a meeting to crash. Toni could see how easy it was for HYDRA to hide within SHIELD all these years, as it was child’s play to sneak into the base of operations.
“That sucks.” Toni said, tapping lighter punches on the pads so she could talk, “I’m sorry Tania treats you like that. All of you.”
Toni scoffs, emotional trauma can sometimes be worse. “So is the cello player still in the picture?”
“You are not wrong.” She’s about to give in, and have her meeting pushed when a phone rings across the hall. She doesn’t have a landline, and it’s not her stark phone ringing. It’s the burner phone she gave a very specific person to call her with in emergency ten years ago. She shoots out of bed, managing to lift Steve’s arm even,
He even called her at the ass crack of dawn when she was presenting a new missile system in Afghanistan. While the presentation went well, a few terrorists got in the way of her trip home.
“She was still breathing when I put my guns away,” she cocked her head to the side, “Can you say the same?”
Only her shoulders tensed, the rest of her body remained calm. She continues to wash the shirt with one hand as the other reaches for the pistol by her knee.
“I know. Trust me, I’ll do anything to protect the people I love. So let's go in there, assemble and what not.”
With Sam in the sky, Amanda and Nat on the ground it almost looks like he’s about to go down when he suddenly kicks Natasha to the ground with one leg.
The weak were disposable, canon fodder, pawns. She needed to be a knight, or a rook, or better yet, a queen.
“Never again?” Antonia replied, she didn’t trust the stranger, but she could recall the sensation of a slap across the face as tears ran down her cheeks, “Please please please, I’m sorry.” She felt the memory like it’d just happened seconds ago, but it was like one piece of a puzzle, and she was missing the rest.
She set them down outside the compound, and she almost didn’t believe she was home because she’d dreamed this so many times.
Steve forgives her. Forgive her. His words of course. She doesn’t know exactly what for, probably her attitude or behavior or lack of hustle. Oops not that last one, she was just listing off elementary school soccer coach voacab and that one accidetnyaly got thrown it. She smiled brightly, when he told her, “I forgive you too.” She lied.
They stood there a moment in silence. Nika broke it, “What are you doing here? Is this where you go during meals.”
Toni smiled back, just as sweetly, “Of course I’m grateful Madame. It’s just very late, I only got in an hour ago.”
“Really? Howard?” He shrugs and she has no idea what he means, while at the same time betting he wonders if he ever gave up common whore and hard liquor for marriage, which he didn’t.
But Toni grapples with her pistol and ducks to the ground as the first wave of bullets floods their campsite. She lets off a few shots, but none of them hit. Her rifle in her bag near the other side of the clearing.
“Even you couldn’t be so cruel.” Eva sniped back, barely turning her head to look at Toni, “She’s dying, we need to get her help.”
She entered without a hitch, no one batted an eye at a young girl in uniform. She slipped on an empty elevator and rose to floor thirteen, room ninety four. The key card she’d been given opened the door, so she slipped inside and shut it quickly.
“Yeah.” She said, and Toni thought she’d leave it at that but she continued, “I couldn’t eat lunch all week. Tania said if I acted like a toddler, I couldn’t sit at the big girls’ table.”
She lived in a different world from everyone else. They all seemed so naive, and carefree. All she could do most days was count down till her due date.
Kozlov nods, and takes off down the narrow hallway, towards the classrooms and away from the sleeping area.
“It’s even funnier, that you don’t remember me!” Toni exclaims, “Because, for the longest time, I didn’t either.”
“We’re not dumb.” Katya says, “She was annoying you so you told your bestest friend ever that she was a threat, and they eliminated her.”
Tania claims her as an opponent instantly, and the others pair up haphazardly, too nervous to strategically choose. None of them seem to know their own weaknesses or their classmates strengths. None of them seem to care.
Annie didn’t cry often, but that afternoon she cried for a long time before Jarvis found her sitting in front of the TV, the program had long since ended and it was now a random reality show but Annie just sat in front of it sobbing.
A woman stood in the corned between the door and the wall, and watched the girls walk in, she held a large black bag behind her, that swung as she approached them.
I'm ashamed to say I used the word 'whom' in this chapter. Hate me if you will but the free website Paper Rater (great too for writing essays and fanfics, this chapter is not sponsered by Paper Rater thou,) reccomended I do and I almost didn't because I didn't want to sound pretentious but I checked and it's gramatically correct and the character who said it seems the the person who'd say it even if it wasn't gramaticlly correct so I put it in there.
“Or Utkyn and Sobol could settle their score. Either way we’d have a clear loser and winner. We’d have the final pair to progress to the next level of the program.”
She pressed the pistol to Tania’s head. The older girl closes her eyes, but she’s smiling as she softly mutters to herself, “This is it. My big break.”
She must’ve been an odd sight. A young woman dressed as a maid, walking down a street that was getting busier and busier as she neared the city. She ignored a few leers, and men offering her rides, tuning them out the same way she turned her classmates out for years.
“Of course!” Nika says, “You’re the best in class. Tania talks a big game, but she’s jealous. You should’ve heard her the night you started Pointe.”
For a moment she considered following Tania, but the older girl shot her a look of pure loathing as they were released into the maze of rooms, as if to warn her away. She heed that warning.
The instructions are clear, the stealth suit goes on underneath the maid uniform, her hair should be kept up in a ponytail, and the bugs go in her pockets, until she’s ready to place them.
“Then don’t.” Steve says, “Keeping things as they are isn’t hard. All you have to do is not leave, so there’s no reason to make everything more difficult.”
They didn’t really. No one said anything to their faces, the gossip magazines must not have gotten word yet, or maybe they were still caught up on her boobs.
She walked down the corridor alone and confused as to what she’d seen. She got herself into bed, and stared at the ceiling frustrated because she didn’t have any answers.
Tania beat Svetlana to death last year in a sparring match. During the fight, she made eye contact with an Instructor and asked permission, until then the Instructors ignored her glib requests to kill her classmates, but finally they said yes.
There were only a few more days left of school, no more than two weeks tops, so Antoinette took the ball bravely, and suddenly the hoop looked a whole lot taller. She steadied her breathing, and ignored the crowd growing around her, girls came over from the grass to see what the commotion was, and kids who played elsewhere joined in, probably to watch Antoinette fail. She closed her eyes, and picture her position to the hoop, it was only feet away, four feet. It was five inches tall, and she was four and a half inches tall. She guessed the weight of the basketball, and how hard the wind was blowing that day, she calculated the pressure she’d need to apply for the ball to travel three feet upwards, the drop on the last foot.
She gets home and regrets every decision she has ever made. Why did she talk to her, why did she say stupid things? Why can’t she be normal.
Suddenly he leaned over and picked up the beer bottle half spilled on his bed. Toni wanted to scream, but she calmed her nerves, maybe he’d throw it on the ground like he did the other cans. Instead, he stared at the stained white sheets, now a murky brown. He discarded the bottle on the ground, but turned towards the phone, right next to the bathroom and Toni.
Toni’s face shone with pride at his defense, but when he hung up he angrily hit her with the back of his hand, landing right on her cheekbone.
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
“You got back just in time, we nearly finished moving him.” Coulson mused, suddenly another agent popped in the door, “Agent Coulson, we’ve got a hit in New Mexico. Come see.”
“Tones.” Rhodey said nudging her, she cracked and eye open and the clock read six o’seven. She’d only fallen asleep a few hours ago, why was he waking her up. “Oh my god Tones I’m so sorry.”
“Should we lock them up?” Koila asked, as the last cuff on Toni’s foot fell, Toni shook her head, and without warning, shot two bullets into each guard’s head.
“You’ve impressed me over the years. You’re reliable, skilled, and intelligent. You won’t be hard to commission.”
She couldn’t hear much, but his grunting and her own sniffling, but she thought she could make out the click of a lock behind her, Mazur didn’t notice, till a tall blonde lady was behind him with a small needle in his neck. He fell into her arms quickly and she dragged him onto the bed.
She had to promise Steve the next time she found out she was dying she’d let him know. She could tell he was really mad deep down, but he wouldn’t admit it. They got married in a courthouse with Happy and Pepper and didn’t tell anyone.
All the other girls treated it like a game, a contest. Whoever won a sparring session got high fives, the best hackers tutored the other girls. They hadn’t seen what she’d seen, they didn’t know how close they were to dying at any moment.
“I don’t think the world would ever leave us alone after that. ” He says, pulling a shirt over his head, “We don’t need to, why can’t we keep it to ourselves a while longer?”
She patted Toni on the shoulder, and returned to her seat behind the desk, picked up her book and ignored Toni as she uneasily rose, and walked out of the office.
But all that seemed meaningless. Absolute unimportant, when Bruce flew down from the sky and told her about Thanos.
“I just think-” He was cut of by the breaking news flashing, “This just in the Sokovia Accords official signing has been bombed. Prime suspect it James Buchanan Barnes or the Winter Soldier.”
No matter what she did all week, Tania wouldn’t even look at her. It was a given that she was stuck with Toni for fighting on Friday.
But she had a secret safe haven, Lucie and her had traded emails and often talked, quite possibly keeping Toni sane. Lucie was going to public school in New York, and she loved it. No one seemed to care who her parents were and how much money she had there, it’s ironic she faced more bullying for being rich in a private school.
Rumors flew around that the guards indulged in the prisoners on the way to execution, and Toni’s stomach turned at the very thought, but right now her only focus was leaving this country having completed the mission.
More doom and gloom I'm afraid, but that's what you signed up for! I cranked this bad boy out in a day thanks to y'alls wonderful comments! I hope you enjoy.
“And when you do, I’ll be there to step on your fingers.” She pauses, “Besides, I don’t allow prisoners to escape.”
“It’s your body withdrawing from all the alcohol.” Tera said unsympathetically as she held Toni’s hair back, when she puked into the toilet.
So she let go of Petra’s shoulder, and moved them up towards her neck. Not much pressure was needed, till she felt the throat close. Petra started choking, and grabbed and scratched at Toni’s hands, so she applied more force to the neck.
She didn’t have to think too hard to see the man in blacks face. He still came to her in nightmares and the dark.
They both knew this was unlikely. Lucie had signed a nondisclosure, and wouldn’t testify against Toni, obviously.
“Ms. Stark. We weren’t expecting you.” She turned around to see Coulson, his arms crossed wearing a half annoyed half pleasant look, “Come with me.”
“What? I would never. And you’re avoiding the whole state because of one person? Geez, what’d they do to you?”
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
He stalked off into the night, leaving one guard to finish the job. Toni took care of him rather quickly and uncovered the body from a hidden closet in the garage. It’d been no easy task sneaking it in that morning.
“Yes I do. I’d like to tell Jason Leonards that I happen to love the color red, and I was wondering if now that he’s crossed off criticizing a six year olds wardrobe choices he feels better about himself. Inquiring minds want to know.”
She handed out the leotards, and Toni worried hers would be too small, as she remembers no measurements being taken, and she wouldn’t fit into the same one as Klara.
He wasn’t just a nanny, but a butler and an impromptu personal stylist. He earned that title two hours before Annie’s first red carpet appearance, some award show. Father was friends with a actress up for an award, when her official personal stylist not only got her size wrong but apparently her age, the now six year old would not fit into the bright pink tutu built for a three or four year old, not that she’d wear it anyways. Jarvis, always to the rescue, returned from Annie’s large closet with a crimson dress that had never been worn and was forgotten in the back. It was fancy enough, so she changed quickly, record time in fact, and even though the rest of the carpet was a blur that she couldn’t recall if she tried, which was very rare for her, she had a photographic memory, she kept the dress, and she liked the color.
The whole thing seemed insane, Fury being shot down in his apartment, Kate- Sharon being a SHIELD agent this whole time, and the person following him and the shooter. Who were they? Whose side were they on?
For a change, Toni was given the details. They were hired by Manya’s half brother Samuil, who wanted to inherit the fortune instead of her.
“Ok Steve.” She sits opposite him and takes the first folder off the top of the stack. The first few are Howling Commandos, Gabe Jones, Morita, Montgomery, Happy, Pinky, Junior and Bucky. Only one is still living in an old persons home in California, Montgomery. His son and grandson became agents. The rest died two of them pretty recently. Bucky’s body was never recovered as she knows, but the Captain seemed to be shaken by it.
Everyday when school let out for break, she walked over to the girls in a large group playing some combination or tag and fairies or horses. They turn her away politely, maybe because they didn’t want to hurt her feelings, maybe because they didn’t want to attract attention.
“Tell him the situation, it’ll be too late when she wakes up.” The doctor says, they return quickly,
Tania and Eva nodded, so Toni accepted the explanation, “I could recount the death tolls if you wish, who was killed. When and where.” She pauses and Toni swears Madame purposefully makes eye contact with her, “And by whom.”
She doesn’t recognize herself in the mirror most days, she can only see the similarities between herself and the tall dark man who killed her family, terrified and terrifying.
She gestures towards the woman and the soldier fighting, “It won’t be long till he pushes her off again, and he’ll turn back to us. Four against one is better odds.”
The boys didn’t see her coming, they were busy already throwing the ball back and forth, making fake slam dunks despite the fact their feet never left the ground.
She reached for the gun before Madame handed it to her, pointed it at Nika and pulled the trigger in one fell swoop. She couldn’t stand to hear her plead anymore, she couldn't stand to think about it one more second.
And suddenly Toni was kissing Sindy, but not like she’d kissed Lucie. Lucie was gentle and soft, but Sindy was excited and adventurous. Her tongue wasn’t shy she basically leaned over onto Toni mid kiss.
They all had shackles, binding their hands together, their feet together, and their handcuffs and feet cuffs, you guessed it, together.
The spar was quick and easy. Toni let Nika get a few hits in early on, but it was a clean sweep at the end. Eighty two wins, fifteen losses.
“I have to admit, that was probably the best performance I’ve ever seen.” She turned around, and Steve stood there leaning on the door frame smiling.
Steve called most days, he did that before the accident, and he did it after. She had to give him points for dedication.
Tania laughed, but it was hollow, they both paused a moment when Tania leaned in, “Who’s dead then?”
The Instructors are tight lipped and agitated the next morning. Breakfast is quiet and quick, the other girls sensing the Instructors change in attitude too.
Petra, Katya, Mila, Nika. Their faces flashed through her head. Not their faces, their corpses. Their blood. It was on her hands. Only fair for the world to punish her. She wishes it would be death instead of this.
A short brunette woman sat across from him surrounded by envelopes and stacks of paper, “Oh my god. I’m so sorry.” She suddenly sat up and shuffled the papers together, “I shouldn’t have rushed out!”
Drop a like or comment to keep this weird flow of writing from me, I have no idea where it came from and I'm too afraid to question it!
No matter how many times a personal assistant picked her off the floor the next morning she always managed to find a new one to pass out on that night. There was always someone willing to fuck, and since she was turning 18 in a few short months, she’d be legal to buy all sorts of shit.
RIP Tania. Had a lot of conflict over this one. The scene where she dies was one of the first scenes I imagined so I've been working up to this for a while. I wish I hadn't named her Tania because it's so close to Toni, so sorry if I confused you guys, I confused my beta reader with that.
Toni would have stayed with Peter if she didn’t think the alien would forcibly take her. So she trudged miserably behind her till they arrived at the ship and boarded in silence.
He turns back, having been handed a gun, but Natasha shoves the man out of the way and disarms Pierce. Toni rushes another guard, it’s over in just a few seconds, Toni didn’t see much of what Natasha had done.
She glances towards the remaining candidates, they’re all standing stuck in their places, eyes wide. Even Tania looks helplessly at Toni.
They walk slowly down the hall, only a few doors down is Manya’s room. It’s filled with a dresser and a mirror, and a closet, not to mention clothes are stacked on top of each other in the back of the room.
Toni was stuck in the middle, which she hated. But there was little time to dwell, they all looked towards Madame standing in front of them, waiting expectantly.
“Antoinette Stark. You look at me.” She lifted her hands off her face and looked Jarvis in the eyes, he only said her full name when she was in trouble, but he didn’t look angry.
She looked around the deserted highway, no one else was there, and she didn’t dare look over the other cars. They might still be alive. She checked her heavy jacket for her phone, praying it hadn’t been destroyed in the crash. The screen was badly cracked, but she managed to pull it out of her pocket without it falling apart.
“Hey what’s this?” One of Howards closer friends Toni recognzed as Obidiah said, looking at another work desk with the proto gun on it.
Toni wheezed, and rolled off her back so she could look down the road for the emergency response trucks, but a big shard of glass dug into her hip when she did so and she finally yelped a little. The corners of her vision were going dark, she could hear the operator asking for a response, but she still couldn’t say a word.
She’d packed a blanket with her. They’d allowed the girls to bring whatever they could fit in their bags.
The girl begrudgingly stood up, slowly resting the other girls head on the ground, as she turned Toni shot her eyes to the body and recognized it as Mila. When she’d fully turned around Toni could see Eva had been drenched in blood from her stomach down, Mila’s blood.
Madame strolled in moments later, holding a manila folder with a stack of white papers, she seemingly read it aloud, “Antoinette Stark. Born 1985, to Maria and Howard Stark, heir to Stark Industries and it’s fortune. Gifted in mathematics, and coding, IQ 146.” She closes it suddenly and drops the folder on the table next to her.
“Do you have any idea how that happened by the way? You being alive, I mean. Besides the super serum, which really shouldn’t have worked that well by the way, it’s just not possible, because even if your were suspended and survive the shock of freezing, you still need air. What are the chances a channel of ice breaks right next to your nose or mouth! Like point seven million I’d guess!”
Toni whirled around, flashing a toothy, probably bloody smile, she said, “Figures you’d need to run away to land a hit.”
And he watched her go, down the hallway and thinks maybe she’ll just leave and he’ll never see her again.
He struggles to his feet anyway, hoping to buy time for Sam and Nat regroup and join him, when black grappling hook lodges itself in the sidewall of the highway, both Steve and the soldier look towards the hook embedded in the concrete, pausing a moment.
It took weeks for her to notice a single change. It wasn’t as if she could suddenly lift weights with ease, or run for hours. But she could feel the tightness of her legs, and the hard bumps on her stomach, of newly forming abs.
With one swift movement, Madame pushes a large metal cap over Toni’s head, and flips a small switch near the control board. She can’t see anything for a moment, it’s all white.
The wagon took a sharp turn, nearly pushing Toni off her bench, suddenly it went at such an incline, Toni snapped her head to see what was up the hill.
“Come on Sobol.” She said, grabbing Toni’s wrist and sharply pulling her onto the mats, “it’s too late to back out now.”
“Am I being eliminated?” Toni said, “Is that why I’m here?” Her heart started to pound, so she tried to steady her breath, Madame just laughed,
She groaned, there was metal and glass in her arms, and moving made her bones ache. She saw no other exit besides the door, that wasn’t layered in glass shards. She’d already ripped the seatbelt in the crash, so she crawled over the terrorist’s body, and out of the flipped over car.
Because this was not the deal. The deal was find Captain America’s body, give him a proper burial, maybe donate his outfit to a museum, be hailed as a hero and recognized for doing something her father never could and ultimately forget about the physical embodiment of her father's expectations that she could never reach.
After a rather hard kick, the woman is pushed to the ground and the soldier seems to remember he was originally after the three of them, and he grabs another pistol out of some deep pocket or and lines up his shot.
The selection process was explained to her in her first week. Do what we say, be smart, strong and perfect in every way, and maybe you’ll survive.
“That’s not what’s stupid.” He puts down the bowl, “What’s stupid is that despite the fact you hate me, I still like you. A lot.”
“First of all, it’s not illegal to be gay in America, and I thought Lucie and I had a passionate romance through sixth grade, if you keep changing your story, the court will never believe you.”
She couldn’t think like that. He was all she had. He was her new mission, her motivator. If he was employed by Hydra, maybe she’d have access to her parents killer. The man who ended her life as she knew it.
He died six months after they met, and no one suspected her. No one checked his food or cigars, not yet at least.
Her eyes shot open, she knew how far to push, and where to throw, she’d made precise calculations and it ensured accuracy and success. When she threw the ball forward her breath hitched with the crowd of children, she involuntarily closed her eyes and opened only in time to see it swoosh into the ring, no rim, only net.
But it still shocked her, she still sat in her room and marveled at the fact that Toni ‘ice queen’ Stark, who prided herself of being made of diamond, untouchable but mortal emotions, was crying, sobbing infact. Like a child.
Toni turned away, just for a second, even though she knew better. And Shvets used the opening to sweep her legs out from under her, she fell to the ground but kept a grip on her pistol.
Kozlov let it go and moved to the next girl, “What book is your literature class reading at the moment?” She asked in a perfect American accent, the girl being question blinked a moment, not for lack of understanding. They’d studied English extensively, but since Kozlov had asked in an American accent, that’s how Klara, the girl, has to reply.
“Bull? Yeah. I didn’t need another ‘Stark Goes Off The Deep End At Parents Memorial’ headline. It’s easier to just fake it.”
It only took a second for them to lock eyes. Toni did her best to look unbothered at being noticed, but was unsure of how convincing she was.
“Thank you, one of my talents is finding stupid things to be angry about.” She grinned, and walked up to him,
It wasn’t their first big fight, but it looked like it might be their last. Barnes choose a very bad moment to show up, with a murder charge on his head.
She tells him Bucky’s four sister are all still alive, being significantly younger than them but are spread around the globe, only one is still in America and all of them are still fairly elderly.
She’d always supported the right to choose, partially in the beginning because it infuriated Howard, but the more research she’d done, the more appalling it was women weren’t naturally afforded the right to choose. Now that the choice was up to her, she made up her mind considering both options, but she wanted this baby to live. She knew she’d have to give it up, and she’d probably never meet the person with half her genetic makeup, but she didn’t care, because she couldn’t give this child much in life, but she could give it life.
Girls she didn’t recognize, from nearly her own age, to ten years old were hurling insults and accusations as she made the short walk to her bed. They only let up when she let herself flop on the rickety piece of furniture.
“I’ve been waiting to see you, and I must say I’m not disappointed. Beautiful, and a reputation for intelligence, you really are the perfect candidate.”
Zma shakes her head, “This being so sudden, we don’t have time to get you in their system legitimately, but the costume should sell it, and you’ll be able to access his room with the key in your grab bag.”
Her black blanket and clothing gave her camo in the night, all she had to do was hide her skin, which was so pale she’d been called translucent.
The girls moved towards the door where Toni stood, they must’ve been drunker than Howard because they fell all over themselves.
Ignoring Rhodey, she gasped, “Oh Annie! I’m so going to miss you, but it’s only for the summer, I hear we’re both coming back next year!” She hugged Toni, and she felt her spine go rigid, in her ear Sasha whispered, “If you think this year was bad, next year’s gonna be a hell hole. Bye bye, you psychotic lesbian bitch.”
Starting college is supposed to be a big deal, but for Toni it’s a really big deal. At only fifteen years old, she starts it and everyone seems to be looking. Magazines’ run “Before and After” stories about her for a solid month before, and Toni is very tired at looking at her five year old self hobble through red carpets.
“Good.” Antoinette and Maria blinked in surprise, “Punch anyone who gets in your way, because they’ll sure as hell punch you if you let them.”
Between Sokovia and all the other Avenger Operations, they’d made a mess. Maybe they should answer for it? After all, they had all this responsibility.
They all acknowledged her in one way or another, whether it be a smile or a sneer, when Madame turned on her heel towards the North Wing.
Quickly Francesa scribbles in another figure by the house, Antoinette returns to her own drawing and notices Francesa shades the house to look dark and scary before asking, “What are you drawing Antoinette?”
She was chosen last in sparring and fights due to that fact and many others, one of which being her unpopularity with the commander of her class, Tania.
“I never managed to prepare anything to say today. What can one say about their dead..deceased parents. She was beautiful, he was charming, I guess. I think because I only knew them as a child, barely as a young adult, I didn’t really know them at all. I knew them as perfect beings, rulers of my life. I never knew them as people.” She spewed bull shit for about two more minutes before ending with a quote from Howard about success that made him sound like a total asshole. But everyone applauded, and a few even caught her afterwards saying how kind and genuine she had been.
“But then we realized. If given the opportunity, Shvets could potentially kill both Utkyn and Sobol.”
“Useless girl.” She said, turning towards her desk, laying her hands flat, “Did they call him something?”
He’s cut off by the other guard wrenching a taser from their chest and jabbing him in the chest. Maria Hill quickly grabs the helmet off her head, “These things really pinch your nose.”
Francesca was Antoinette’s only friend, she spoke fluent spanish and italian, an she taught Antoinette how to speak them too. She was beautiful, and young, despite the fact she’s been watching Antoinette for as long as she can remember. They sit on a hill nearby the house, and lay on the grass as the clouds pass by, Francesca points out what kind of clouds they are, and once in awhile she can see a star peaking out in the sky early, “They can’t wait for night to fall so they shine just a little during the day.”
After a few minutes, her mouth was sore, it pulled slightly, closing. He yelped and slapped her across the face, grabbing her jaw again, harder this time, he screamed, “Open you slut!” Another slap and he began again, harder this time, till the tears slid down her neck.
She’d been told she was beautiful all her life. By her parents. By her Instructors. It was always an asset.
She couldn’t hold back anything though. Not if she wanted to get out. Showing the Instructors she cared, meant showing them that she was unnecessary.
She could see Nika in his face. The beautiful young girl had little actual similarity, but she could sense a common theme in their deaths.
“그 책에 대해 말해줘?”  The Instructor asks, Klara wasn’t any good at Korean, none of them were, since they’d only started learning it a few weeks ago. So asking Klara to summarize the book just wasn’t fair.
“She’s an asset. She’s highly trained, and I don’t know what I’m walking into with that meeting.” She pauses, “Without her, I wouldn’t have even known where it was.”
“Toni, we don’t have all day. They all look the same, just choose one.” Maria exhales all in one breath, it’s impressive really.
It’s him again. The shooter. The Winter Soldier, Natsha told him about the asset, the ghost. Before he can think about what to do next, the car is flipping and they’re all sprawled on the highway, cars zooming beside them.
And her enthusiasm is squashed yet again, why does he keep bringing up Howard? To be fair he doesn’t know the dick head he became, but still.
And next year flashed before Toni’s eyes, the same as the last three years but more vengeance, more kids recruited to making Toni’s life hell. She took a breath, and decided.
It’s ten minutes after the hour break, she’s late for lunch. No one will notice her missing, so she heads to the shower and her body aches under the cold water.
It’s mentioned that Lidia Yakovlev killed herself the year before because she thought she would be the next one eliminated. She was right and remarks that the girl who tried to kill her in the test deciding who would get a mission would’ve been with her on the ground and Lidia would have had a gun. Ironic.
The hairs on her arms stood up as she saw Eva’s black flats pass her hiding spot a third time, she moved slowly and deliberately, taking her time searching every room, because she knew she had the luxury.
Two hundred and fifty wins and fifteen losses. She hadn’t lost since Nika died. Twenty seven of those wins have been against Tania, and everytime she trapped her, the older girl wouldn’t stop wiggling and cursing Toni out. But Toni didn’t let go until the Instructor called the match.
The man paused, and gulped, “Not if it was your switch.” He chucked the thin glass of champagne to the ground, where it shattered.
She’s silent the ride home, and it’s a long trip. She only stops crying when she can see the top of the Red Room mansion, and by the time she strides inside the prison, her tears are wiped away and she’s ready to face them again. For now.
Toni looked over towards Eva and Klara, sitting near the other side of the room, also waiting for the Instructor to return with Madame, “Can’t you see who’s not here? It’s Mila.”
They slept together two months in. Toni showered three times, but could still feel his hands, and his mouth. She felt dirty and used, and she didn’t expect him to call but he did. That’s when she began her mission.
“That’s not true.” Toni said, avoiding eye contact with Nika, “My parents sold my sister Ursula and I to a whore house, the Red Room rescued us, but couldn’t save Ursula from her injuries. I only suffered from a concussion, which gave me long term amnesia.”
The she gets to Howard, his inventions mostly how he upgraded the US in times of war, the Captain doesn’t seem all that interested. “How got married in nineteen sixty three.” she continues,
“It totally did.” She sighed, “I just saw you when you moved in, but haven’t really seen you since, so I figured you were just visiting. I swear I didn’t plan this. I don’t have a shrine in my closet.”
They talked tensely for a few moments, and Steve grew wearier, what was he hiding? And what happened to him in the first place?
“Yes.” She said, looking around her room to tidy and mess. She’d just managed to close her closet when she heard a knock on the door. “Come in!” She said.
Lara stands up, her legs are shaking so hard, it takes her a moment to walk towards them. Matveev gestures to a chair next to her, and Lara sits down, her legs shaking. She takes two straps of duck tape around Lara’s wrists.
Toni’s unfortunately familiar with the hallway she’s being dragged down. At the end of it, sits two thick doors, inside is an open warehouse type room, where she was forced to kill the closest person she had to a friend, and where she lost her memory, and identity.
Finally she came to Toni, already gone through the cycle, she came back to English, but with a Russian accent. “Tell my about your home.” Kozlov said.
Nika laughs, and the room goes quiet a moment. She turns to Tania and makes eye contact that says it all. Tania looks furious, the whisper start again in a few seconds, but it felt like a lifetime.
But her plan was already in motion, in a few moments, a maid would barge in, finding them in this state, and quickly alert Manya's father. She would be unharmed, but Toni would be dragged out of the mansion and secretly killed.
“Oh Lucie! I miss you so so much! I wish they’d sent me home instead, so I didn’t have to deal with the ever present eyes on me, but then you’d still be here suffering and I couldn’t take that either!”
“Why don’t you ask Francesca to tuck you in, she’d probably be just delighted to.” Mother slammed the door and Antoinette jumped back. Out of the corner of her eyes she saw Father and Francesca in his room, on top of each other, kissing.
Toni remains silent, but he continues, “Go on then, take off the mask. I want to put a face to all the stories I’ve heard about you.”
Madame finally stopped outside a small classroom, she’d only been in there a few times for measurements. They were fitted with new uniforms every two years. She’d assumed that was the only purpose of the room.
He left in a hurry, busy with secret organizations to glue back together, and Toni returned to Steve’s room.
The remaining ten girls stared at her wide eyes a moment, before a petite girl, Lidia, raised her hand. “Did she rely too much on her larger size?”
Eva, along with the other two lowest girls in the class, had been given their choice of firearms that morning. She and Tania, the two highest marking girls in the class, had been told to hide in the dusty basement of the school, that Toni didn’t even know existed.
-Just checked and I'm like 130 words from being at 30,000 words total like jeez i wrote all those words all by myself my man thats a lot of words
She knew it wouldn’t go well. She knew he’d overreact. But she couldn’t keep coddling him, he was an adult.
The series of hallways was familiar, and they led back to an empty room with no light. The Instructor Zma walked in with her.
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
She sat down on the bed and like Francesa had left all over agian, she cried. It was her fault everyone left. She called Francesa a slut, she never appreciated Jarvis, she’d given her baby away, she’d gotten Lucie kicked out. Soon enough Rhodey would leave too, probably sooner if she kept crying like this.
With the momentum from landing her kick, she swung the second guard over her shoulder and on top of the first. They laid there groaning, as if unable to comprehend being taken down by a girl half their size in thirty seconds.
Finally one of the doctors turns to the screen, “ON, we’re going to begin the process of waking him. We’ll move him to the set stage.”
It feels like mere minutes till the chopper lands in an empty field, just outside of Kiev. She can see the beginnings of the skyline, and she had just a few hours to make her way to the hotel.
But it wasn't. Steve was waiting on the first floor of the building, in civilian clothes with a beard.
Toni was confused, which was a rare occurrence for her. This was obviously a ballet studio, not a boxing ring like she’d been expecting.
“A little gratitude would be appropriate.” Madame said, smiling. But it was a thinly veiled threat. She’d gotten too comfortable. She knew she was good, but good wasn’t enough. She could just be successful on missions, she needed to be perfect in the mansion too.
Toni knew about her earlier brother, who was never mentioned much but it still surprised her, she didn’t think they’d mention him but they were being very thorough.
Just clips like, “Little Annie Stark! Are we supposed to believe she’s going to inherit that company?”
She tried not to remember their names, but if it was mentioned in passing, it was stuck in her brain along with piercing blue eyes, and her first conversations with Madame or her last conversation with her mother, it was filed away with all the things she didn’t want to remember.
“You don’t go into withdrawal from alcohol. I don’t think so anyways.” Toni said, interrupted but nauseous, but continued, “Besides I haven’t had more than a glass in weeks, there no way I’d be feeling it now.”
She shouldn’t have said it. Damaged assets were useless too. No matter how good she was, if she was broken, she wasn’t worth the while.
Toni can hardly breathe after a while, flashes of one night stand in Moscow pass through her head, Tania’s face makes a brief appearance when a memory of them in the stairwell after a day of sparring comes to mind. She can’t tell what’s real, happening right then, and what happened years ago.
No one knew about the crash. She paid the news to keep it quiet and remain anonymous. All the offenders died in the crash.
The girls, the targets. They blended after a while. No one told her the reason she was killing people, she didn’t know if they deserved it, and worse, she was beginning to think that they didn’t.
It’s one of those nights, when she’s finished the offical project she’d been working on, a styalzied gun with pinpoint acrucy and detector when target is in range, when she begins working on her unnamed robot, but this night was different, because on this night it worked.
It was almost magic how fast Lucie and Toni clicked, they had the same interests, opinions everything they had was shared. Even secrets.
If Maria had ever been surprised in her life, it was that moment. She didn’t look angry, but impressed and considerate. She glanced towards Howard for a moment before standing up and silently returning to her room. Toni stormed out the front doors ignoring Howard’s angry cries.
Today was a nice day, the teacher let the out early since school would be ending soon, and it was so pretty outside, and it was hot inside. As she got out, she walked towards the large mass of girls gathering on the grass, they were deciding what to play that afternoon, fairies or horses, just like every other day.
After finding the solution, and sending Vanko back to Siberan prison, she comes out of her lab for the first time for a bit. She added a communal floor because apparently everyone likes the chit chat over breakfast, and since it’s closest, she heads there for ceral.
“Of course.” Steve said, impatiently, “But you didn’t notice any details that might indicate where-”
“You’ve been itching to kill me since I was eight years old. You begged the Instructors to let you eliminate us, you craved it.”
“Remember to bring them my body. Don’t let Eva have it and be careful on your way back. She’ll want to kill you too.”
It’s a sparring day, so they spend the whole morning in the gym warming up. Rumor has it they’re going to eliminate someone this week.
Finally he was silent. She couldn’t help but take satisfaction in the look of pure shock on his face, it was refreshing.
Her voice was alone in the night, and the air was so thick her words felt stifled. She was about to continue her calling when she heard a loud footstep, from outside the wrecked car.
She was an assassin. Of course, that’s what she’d been training for. But also an evac operative, and a spy, and thief, and much more.
“You’re Black Wid-” Toni stopped, as the woman raised her pointer finger to her mouth, shhhing her from far away. As Toni stepped closer to the car, the woman smiled and pivoted away, down the hallway.
Natasha looked up, and Toni shoved the gun into his back roughly, he fell forward slightly, and turned around chuckling, “There she is.”
Did Madame know she was being sold her her parent’s killers? Did she care? Antonia Sobol didn’t remember the conversation, even with her perfect memory, it happened over a decade ago, she shouldn’t have memorized the speech Madame presented her with.
The soldier stands yards away, his stance is strained and imposing. In one fluid motion, he steps towards them and cocks his gun on his shoulder. Natasha’s guns are still in the car, Sam is still on his back catching his breath from the crash. Steve himself doesn’t feel ready to fit this supersoldier.
Suddenly he stopped walking, Toni rested on the ground panting. She carefully touched the back of her head, finding her fingers covered in blood. She tried to jump back away from the murderer, but his grip on her foot was like iron. She could only pull for a few minutes before she was out of breath, and she hadn’t gained an inch. She rested on the ground a few moments, when she heard the hum of an engine nearing.
But the day was still good, she’d planned on taking her new laptop down the the library and emailing Sasha and Rhodey before starting her research project. Maybe even stopping by the cafeteria for a snack before retiring for the evening. It was only December but Toni felt very ready to leave this school at the end of eighth grade.
They both get up slowly, but it seems Eva has retreated. The rules have been broken, and they both know Eva won’t end the game if one of them is killed. She’ll go on till she thinks she’s won.
The dialing tone rang for what seemed like hours, and Toni couldn’t breath so well anymore. She couldn’t choose a side to lay on because they were all lathered in glass.
The match’s that day were quick and painless, no one was on edge this week. Tania quickly took Mila down in record time, but both girls good naturedly got up and walked back to the line together.
They all sat in the family room, pretending to watch some home improvement show. Clint glanced over and awkwardly met her eyes for just a second, before looking away. Some spy.
“Promises promises.” Toni sang, stepping around the older girl in a circle, “Doing a lot of talking for someone who wants to fight.”
They sleep restlessly, and get up silently. As a class they move together, but like zombies. It’s Tania that talks first. “Get out of my way Sobol.”
Toni just grinned, “Yeah, maybe.” Bruce went off down the hallway, and Toni counted his steps till she couldn’t hear them anymore.
Toni’s ears were ringing, an Instructor held out her hand to help her up. They weren’t supposed to touch her. She almost swatted it away in confusion when she realized they were no longer Instructors. Not hers at least.
She only dropped her head in defeat. She was untied, and the restraints hadn’t left much of a mark on her hands, so there was no evidence of her capture.
“It should only take one day, and you will be promptly returned. Better go get briefed now, it’s almost time to go.”
His metal hand shoots towards it catching it with ease, but Steve can only see the face that’s now staring him down.
Toni sold her house in California and tried move the SI office out so she’d never have to go there. It was a big state but she could never be too careful. Apparently Ronnie Richards just moved to LA, and ‘accidentally’ let it slip he slept with her a few years ago, and now the paparazzi think she’s avoiding him, which is true but unrelated. He has matured since stealing yachts or whatever, but she doesn't trust his reaction to finding out he's a father. He technically still has rights of Maia, even though Toni got them temporarily waived by not including his name on her immediate birth certificate. But if both her parents and Toni died, she’d go to him.
Bruce dropped her off at her room and confirmed their plans to work in the lab tomorrow, “At noon ok? And don’t drop by my room to find me, I sleep in the nude. I’ll find you.”
Toni bit her lip nervously, the wave of nausea over and she slid to the tile floor, looking at her feet not answering.
But even though he and the man had their disagreements, it’s hard to watch him code on the table from behind a window. He can’t imagine what Natasha must be going through.
The suit came naturally, like the next step in an organic progression. She wanted to show off, to prove she really was the genius Stark. Steve wasn’t impressed though, “I prefer Toni to Iron Woman.”
After hours of stretching, and laps, the Instructor called them into line. The eight of them stood still, the back of their hands lay on the small of their backs.
Toni nodded, and took the woman’s extended hand, “The injection was a low grade anesthetic, he’ll wake up thinking it was a dream.”
Klara ambled towards her, but she hit the girl in the neck with her open hand, sending her tumbling. The two girls fled towards the door.
The perfect cover, she as the focal point of the party, allowing her to talk to anyone and everyone, especially her target.
Tania is an easy one. All brawn, little brain. Before her private sessions, she’d have been snapped like a twig, but since she been working on muscle, despite not showing it, if she could get Tania riled up and out of breath quickly, it wouldn’t take much to knock her off balance.
“Nearly, you can take off the mask if you want, we have to get out of here soon anyway,” Natasha says, not looking up from the computer
Toni swallowed hard, Natasha piped in, “It’s done Toni, it’s all out there. Steve’s almost got the helicarrier down, we have to go.”
“That’s not what I meant.” Steve said, turning around for a second he looked understanding and empathetic, but then he glanced at the Avengers conspicuously watching from the living room, “So don’t you try and twist my words! Ok, you’re not the victim here!” He yelled
The headmistress takes Lucie away that night, and she’s sent home soon after. Toni stays, and for the short rest of the year she silently takes wild looks from the other girls, she hears lesbian, dyke, slut tossed around but the emptiness numbs her and she barely notices.
She looked at her feet, crisscrossed in front of her, feigning shame, waiting for Koila to take the bait. The younger girl reached over and took Toni’s hand, “Bravery isn’t just fighting, it’s words, and presence. I appreciate you being there, many left long before the coup began.”
Toni nods, she always hated this room. She couldn’t remember much about the first day she got here, but she knew she’d been in this room, and she knew it hadn’t ended well. She’d tried to get debriefs moved, but couldn’t be too insistent without raising suspicion.
Toni furrows her brows, “It’s past eight am, we’re in Russia, probably one of the only villages in the area. You used a mixture of chloroform and other sleep inducers for the plane ride here.”
Brynn must not have thought this funny, “Yeah I guess, I think I liked my parents though. More than you liked your parents.”
The crowd of kids around her didn’t cheer, or even react much, maybe due to disappointment or maybe shock. Everyone was silent, or almost everyone, one girl directly behind her whispered particularly loudly to her friend, “Well she’s still a freak.”
To be fair Toni knew Barnes was alive and a brainwashed assassin. Steve told her he was alive and a brainwashed assassin. She however wasn’t informed he killed her parents. She honestly didn’t hate him, she barely liked her parents. But after Steve rode the guilt trip of not telling him about her secret child and father of said secret child for almost a week, she was pissed.
“It wasn’t a booty call if that’s what your asking.” Toni said suddenly, pulling away from him, “I’m not 19 anymore.”
Deep down Toni must’ve known some of the other girls didn’t want to be there just as much as she didn’t. Lidia certainly didn’t want to be there, Nika had pretty much been sold off to them. But if anyone was supposed to be loyal to ‘Mother Russia’ it was Tania Utkyn. Or so she thought.
Her eyebrows broke into a furrow, “Rhodey, I gotta tell you something.” His nod prompted her, “I’m not all out of family.”
Instead of going straight to Madame’s office, Toni stopped, Instructor Zma stood in the doorway and pointed up the stairs, where Tania and Eva stood.
Brynn flashed her a looked, and Toni backtracked, “No no no, that’s not what I meant, I mean we are together and we are having sex. Or were.”
She stayed all weekend and they switched from fucking to watching bad Netflix Original movies like it was nothing. She thought for a moment she could get used to it, to having a girlfriend to watch stuff with. Brynn wouldn’t be a bad option for girlfriend.
“I mean, you said either you die or Eva does, and I could die too. I’d actually say Eva’s pretty keen on the idea.”
“Yeah.” He shifts his weight, “Barton told me your dad used to be weird about me, or something, and that’s why you were pre-dispoded to loathing me, but I thought we got passed that and that we were friends and you come in here looking...beautiful and see me and almost turn around.”
Toni’s eyes shot to Katya, she was still sitting in the chair, but there was a thin red line across her neck that quickly began dripping blood.
“Great.” Amanda says coughing, and slowly raises her hands above her head, “Think we’re in trouble?” She smiles cockily,
Just like in their target practice, she’d gotten a bullseye. An angry red dot placed neatly between Nika’s dark black eyebrows.
“Neutralize as in rescue.” Natasha says, “I honestly don’t think he’s capable of killing him, even if it’s for his own life.”
“I was bugging a hotel room. He came back early, if I left or tried to fight him, it would’ve blown my cover.”
Toni smiled back softly, and let Manya lead her down the hallway, she narrated the significance of each room while they last. Some dining rooms were decades old, some board rooms were still in use by their original owners.
“Oh, it was. You were always expected to be the champion of your class. Even when you arrived I knew I could make you into the next great asset.” She smiled, almost warmly if you didn’t look at her eyes, “And you were so little when you came. So naive and kind. Like an angel, you didn’t want to hurt anyone.”
“Let’s get one thing straight. Just because I’m attracted to girls doesn’t mean I don’t have standards, so you giggling about me going into your room at night is ridiculous because anyone with eyes wouldn't touch you with a ten foot pole and a barf bag. Secondly, I think me telling the administration about your stealing activity lately might stop you from coming back next year all together, but even if it doesn’t, telling them how I hack your tired ass laptop back to hell will certainly get me expelled so I won’t be seeing you next year. By the way, as you know I’m an oblivious rich girl, so tell me what a girl like you from a poor ass town with a criminal record will look like to colleges, I’d really really like to know.”
“I’m trying to figure out where Pierce is meeting with the rest of the committee and how to get inside. SHIELD kept pretty good records but this place is ancient.”
The girls murmur to each other a moment before remembering themselves. Toni stands, back straight, eyes at attention. She doesn’t even blink and Madame notices, giving her a soft smile.
She looks over the rest of the file, word by word she figures out what they’ve done to her, and what they’ve taken. Brainwashing, mind erasure. By the end of the page she’s seething, but capable of wiping the tears from her face and walking out the door.
Instead she looked at him, they were closer now, she could smell the booze on his breath. They’d been taught how to deal with alcohol. The kinds of it, it’s effects, and that you should avoid it on missions, because it made you sloppy. She certainly could confirm that by the way Mazur seemed to be holding on to her for stability as well as control.
But Toni still stands in front of her, unblinking. “You’re getting rusty, Judyta. I switched them out for blanks two hours before you got here.”
“Well, it’s our name on the side of the building,” Steve countered, “So try not to be so inconsiderate.” She hated when he did that.
It took some doing to prove her identity, thankfully Howard kept a DNA sample in the books in case an illegitimate heir showed up after he died. But she did it, and she was one hundred percent his daughter.
Car accidnent? She hadn’t been told they were driving anywhere, she hadn’t talked to them since last week when they told her they disaproved of all her actions and life choices and she said they didn’t know the half of it. Her last words were “Well. Fuck you two.” Her last words.
“Things will be changing ladies. The program will be moved up for you.” No one dares ask why, but Madame answers anyways, “Mother Russia is in need of strong women to protect her. Eliminations will not be early, but combat will start tomorrow, no more sparring. Espionage will start in six months.”
“Hmm. Trouble’s like this did run in your family. Of course, your father would never admit it, not the great Ho-”
Toni flinched, “I’ve made mistakes. We all have. I’m doing my best to right wrongs, there’s no shame in that.”
As she stood up, she grabbed a link in Koila’s handcuff chain, dragging her up too. The guards took one look at her and waved them both out of the cell.
Amanda gets a clean punch in the face knocking his mask to the ground, but he turns so suddenly, Steve doesn’t see much other than his long hair.
“Shut up, I’m probably not even, I drank so much alcohol that night and the weeks before I probably sterilized myself.”
Instructor Kozlov took particular joy in playing a little game during morning roll call. She’d switch languages nearly every sentence, and her victim would be forced to respond in said language instantaneously or suffer the consequences. They ranged from losing an hour of sleep in the morning, to receiving lashes on her wrists.
“Can I play?” She asked quietly, and all the boys turn to her, in the beginning they looked at her in disbelief, now they were just annoyed.
“What would I know?” Toni says finally, Nika had to take a break for a second, “ I’ve been Tania Utkyn’s personal punching bag since I was eight.”
“And if we’re both lucky, we’ll never see each other again.” Madame continues, “I have your files, they’ll be sent with you. Now let me tell you about your new job.”
Toni finished working out faster than normal, she started to pack up her stuff and return to the sleeping quarters when she hears the shuffle of footsteps.
She back off her knees and thought a moment, “Probably with me sitting in an old woman's apartment for an hour, listening to her life story.” She sighed, “I’ve already heard it ten times.”
“Doctor, blood’s back, she’s not drunk or high, but she’s pregnant.” she could hear a far away voice say, then a door slammed shut. The person closest to her curses under his breath.
“It’s Antoinette, Sin!” the other giggled, “Sorry. We’re a little tipsy.” She whispered the last part as if it was a secret.
She could hear the things they said to her face everyday, and worse, she could hear the things they whispered about her behind her back.
“We don’t have rights!” She cried, “We lost them when we got careless, reckless. When people got hurt, we lost them.”
So he paused just a moment too long to pass by wordlessly. Kate, he remembered when she introduced herself as he was just moving in, smiled at him and hung up.
“I’ve committed years to being Iron Maiden. Blood, sweat, friends, family. I’ve got ten places to be everyday, you have one. So why don’t you let me go do my job.” He releases her arm, but the grimace is stuck on his face, she continues, “Don’t fucking touch me again.”
The school couldn’t kick her out, because her father funded most of the programs, but they didn’t do a thing to make her life better.
“Losing your edge Sobol?” Tania teased, as she landed another hit to her stomach, Toni blinked, barely noticing the punch, let alone the nasty comment, “Maybe” was her reply.
“There was stuff about you in those files wasn’t there.” he says, “Haven’t had the chance to go through them all yet.”
“Antonia?” A familiar voice calls out from the hallway, her first instinct is to crouch behind a table till she goes away, but she steels her nerves and pokes out of the door, “Nika?”
The party seemed less dull suddenly, and since Maria was leaving the following morning, Toni just wanted to go home.
Toni squirmed to the corner of the back seat, trying to control her breathing, trying to be silent. He ripped off the back door opposite her anyways.
“That’s quite enough chit chat girls.” A sharpening clicking sound alerts Toni to Madame’s presence, “I’m afraid you’ll both have to be punished.”
She hadn’t talked to Brynn since they were kids, at the fancy parties their parents held. Then the Wayne’s died and Brynn stopped going.
Bang bang bang. Legs to incapacitate, sternum for maximum organ damage, and then the head. The kill shots.
They move to the courtyard, and Francesca grabs some paper and pencils, and they sit at a table and draw, Francesca draws the hill they sat on, and the clouds, and the stars peeking out from the sky, and the house in the background. She adds in herself, and Antoinette another figure next to them.
“I see you decided to take a shower this morning, Sobol?” The Instructor in charge said, Toni nodded, avoiding eye contact with Eva.
Also this is kinda sad, see end notes for why :( I'm also pissed my mom won't let me have my friend over even though there's gonna be a heat emergency over the weekend and we're literally doing nothing. But it's fine obvi, just more bullshit to whine to my therapist about.
Only the look of pure fear Katya had in her eyes as the last drops of blood drained from her neck, and the light disappeared in her pupil.
So she went downstairs to the useless, carless robot that reminded her a lot of someone she knew, and she names it Dum-E after Howard.
“The chopper will pick you up shortly, and you’ll be dropped right outside Kiev, Ukraine, you’ll find your way to the hotel, the address is on the written brief, it’s Velyka Zhytomyrska St, 2A, Kyiv, Ukraine, 01001, the InterContinental Kyiv, a luxury hotel.”
It was a while before they stopped, the doctor had gone without a word. She slowly rose from the bed, the pain in her stomach was just a faint burning.
Toni nodded, she knew what was happening, but how could she even try to stop it without getting the back of Howards hand again.
“You’re being hired, sweetheart.” Madame said, leaning on her desk, “Surprisingly, I’m sad to see you go. Can’t say that about many candidates or assets for that matter. Lord knows Romanov was a pain in my-”
He doesn’t say anything, just looks down at her, and she pauses a moment before pushing one of the heavy doors open. When she turns to look back, he’s already making his way down the hallway.
The underground tunnel isn’t exactly unexpected. Natasha seems to know about it, Sam takes it in stride and Amanda… well, she seems more annoyed than impressed with SHIELD facilities.
She scans the room, wondering who’ll go. Maybe she will, it would be a twist, but it wouldn’t hurt class morale nearly as much as a more popular candidate’s death would. A reasonable choice for elimination.
She should have seen it coming honestly, because everything she touches turns to ash, or worse. Nothing gold can stay ponyboy.
They don’t talk as they trail down the abandoned corridors, no secret were left to fill the silence.
She looks at the ground and for nearly a minute is completley silent. “I almost turned around because I saw some random figure in the hall. I can’t see anything, I’m not wearing contacts or glasses. I just didn’t want to have to talk to anyone, nothing to do with you. However I would absoluetly not mind jumping your bones or even having a ‘relationship’ if you so desire, but not right this instant because I am very tired.”
Her sleeping quarters weren’t far, by the time she turned the hallway towards them, she was practically dragging her feet.
Eva steps closer, “I’m just saying, tell them you don’t want anymore missions, or sleep with one eye open. Even you can’t take all three of us.”
“Ok, ok, ok.” Bruce said from behind Toni, putting her hands on her shoulders. He knew that calmed her down. When Bruce Banner was telling you to chill out, it was a bad sign. She never meant to get so heated, but what could she say, she was a great actor.
She’d initially set out to find somewhere to set up some sort of hideout for an easy escape route, but all the windows were barred, very small and very close to the ceiling, and she’d yet to come across any doors.
The blue alien, Nebula, told her they’d survive for about a month before the food runs out, followed by oxygen. She grimly nodded, and a small part of her longed for the end.
“Walk with me darling.” She says, and Toni follows her to a familiar room. It’s so darks she can’t see very far, let alone to the back.
“Toni,” she heard him say, it was the first time he’d spoken to her since she got back, she almost let herself respond. “Toni.” He repeated, agitated.
Toni nodes, she can’t feel her limbs the longer they walked down the hall. She seems to know exactly where they’re going even without watching Madame.
“However, I will not be helping her, and she and you are currently unable to administer basic first aid. She’ll bleed out in minutes at this rate, the more she squirms the faster.”
Toni had gotten boobs recently, and she very much enjoyed them. They could be a hassle on stairs, and jump roping was a forgotten memory, but they made dresses look older, more sophisticated. They weren’t even that big, probably would get bigger after she got her period, but Toni felt a sense of accomplishment at managing to obtain boobs.
“Don’t!” Willa exclaimed, “I have them.” She reached down and grabbed the large leather bag that could’ve hidden a dead body, and rushed down the hall without another word.
“Early for what?” Koila says, and Toni just points to the sky, where a sleek black chopper approaches, it’s nearly silent, and hard to see in the sky. It’ll be weeks till they find out Koila got out of the country, and they’ll never find out where Toni went.
“Well, I have a fantastic solution to that.” Steve gently pulled off Toni’s shirt, before his own, while she worked on her jeans. “Isn’t Bruce dropping by tomorrow?” Steve said suddenly, “So maybe I shouldn’t sleep over.”
“Maybe if you spent less time thinking about my ass and smile, you wouldn’t be so stupid.” Toni said, before Tania could respond, the class ended and she scurried out of the room.
Annie gulped, the other girls were looking at her, none jumped to her defense, “Well, my dad was friends with one of the nominee’s I think-”
“Who is that?” Nat says, limping but looking more confused than hurt. Sam’s right behind her and they both stand watching the two dark figures attack each other.
Manya’s face changes in seconds, from confusion to worry, “I’m so sorry. How rude of me. I’m Manya Volkov, you must be Anya, the lady of the party.”
She slipped a pistol, and the keys from their belts, and tossed the key to Koila, who despite her shock, was able to begin unlocking herself without direction.
She already knew three languages, Spanish, Russian, and of course English. Most of them were Russian or were at least Slavic. She knew there were rumors about her, how she was ashamed her heritage so she pretended to be an American. They acted as if her being American, or posing as an American, meant she thought she was better than them.
The SHIELD bunker was a maze of rooms with no purpose, Toni could’ve gotten lost for days if she hadn’t turned back after the 4th hallway of empty rooms.
“Fucking hell Maria! Don’t be such a bitch!” Howard stood up from the table suddenly shaking the glasses and plates and stormed off towards his room.
Steve was about to scoop him up when the door shot opened, he leaped to his feet in defense but was momentarily shocked by Kate from downstairs in his hallway.
Toni walked towards her, “Yeah, we would’ve. I still would’ve kicked your ass in Geometry, and you’d tease me in Chinese Lit. but we would be friends.”
Romanoff doesn’t really live there, she’s always off on missons but have a room. Or a floor to be exact.
“It’s dead.” She says, turning her head from them, hot tears bunch up under her eyes and the bridge of her nose stings, “My baby is dead.”
“What’s not fair is that years ago I had a plan. To protect us. A plan that would’ve come in pretty damn handy.”
She took a look at the scene one more time before she left, the guard still unconscious, about to wake up to a dead body. The mansion looked quiet and peaceful from here, she almost wanted to go see Manya again before she left.
Tania slowly looks around, seeing no one else volunteer, she steps forward, but unassuming Svetlana beats her to the punch.
She walks for nearly two hours before she finds a creek, the best place to set up camp. She walks ten minutes in each direction to make sure neither of the other girls had the same idea.
“She needs a doctor!” Sam says, “She’s losing blood.” Natasha groans, but swats his hand away, “I’m alright.”
Steve looks back to the shooter, is this his backup? He looks just as confused though? Suddenly, two hands appear on either side of the hook, gripping the concrete wall. They tense, and slowly pulled up to reveal a woman.
The room is shabby, and crowded with friends. She greets Bruce happily, till he tells her what’s coming. Who’s coming.
Antoinette knew she was wrong, stars shine all day, but the glare of the sun hitting earth is much stronger and blocks out the meniscus light the stars put out, but she never corrects Francesca.
“She kissed Lucie.” “I heard she’s a lesbian.” “ She got her roomate sent away because she rejected her.”
Unexpected variable? She repeated back to herself. They didn’t know she’d be with them in the car she realized. They’d been planning to assassinate her mother and father. They had assassinated her mother and father. She began to struggle again, and the man looked towards her for a moment.
