“Coming to check on you, honestly,” Dean said as they set the box down on a counter. “How’s it going here?”
Dean ran into Lisa the very next day when he was getting out of the Impala in front of Castiel’s house.
Somehow, Dean had begun spending every single Friday with Cas. Watching him bake, and helping him clean up all the meanwhile discussing Castiel’s plans for the bakery. He even started driving Cas to drop off baked goods at the shelters and soup kitchens on Saturdays and then they would go out to get brunch. Early on, those Saturdays had also involved Dean fixing things in Cas’ house for him. Once the remodel at the bakery started, Dean joined him there where he could to see how the work was coming along and after a few weeks, Dean started to see Cas’ vision. The large work space in the back with gleaming countertops, the huge industrial ovens, and the giant mixers.
Dean knew that Sam kept track of Chuck just in case, but neither of them had ever wanted to see him again. Certainly not so soon.
As he and Cas rose and Cas’ was completely out of the substance, Dean felt the weight of the soldiers on his wings and the ringing from before rose in pitch into a painful screech that Dean realized was supposed to wake The Empty itself. And if that happened, Dean knew he and Cas would never make it out.
Lisa excused herself as Dean got into his trunk to grab his tools. He was hoping that the planks wouldn’t need to be replaced entirely, but wouldn’t know yet until he got a closer look. When he was sure he had everything he walked up to Castiel’s house.
Time moved because there was nothing else for it to do, but to Dean that meant little. He tried not to think about it because if he stopped to think about how many days or weeks or months had gone by since, then he would need to consider that eventually one day the number of years without Cas would eclipse the time that he had had with Cas. That felt unacceptable.
Dean kept a steady stream of conversation. He told Cas about working with Bobby and how he’d come to half own Singer Auto and a little bit about him and Lisa. How he met her at a bar and how quickly Dean had found himself dating her.
As he followed Cas into his house, Dean was immediately hit with the scent of baking. It smelled divine, but somehow more divine was watching Cas walk ahead of him. He was wearing jeans and they fit him perfectly, giving Dean plenty to ogle at.
The permanence of this death — of the way The Empty had taken Cas away — it left a gaping hole that Dean knew with absolute surety would never be filled. It would always be there and as invisible as it was to everyone else, for Dean it felt ever-present. Cas was never far from his thoughts. Castiel. Angel of the Lord. Angel of Thursday. Dean’s best friend. Dean’s person. Dean’s. Just Dean’s.
“She didn’t know,” Dean said. “I just never found a good time to tell her. Tells you a lot about how suited we were for one another.”
He did tell Cas about the time that Sam ran away. How worried he was and how when he returned and their dad was still screaming and yelling not just at Sam but at Dean as well, Dean had only wanted to hug Sam and he didn’t care that his dad blamed him because Sam was okay.
“No, I’m kinda paying him back. Doing him a favor. He has a few loose steps in his backyard. I noticed them yesterday when I was here and I offered to fix them.”
Castiel kept him company out in the yard. He busied himself with the garden, but wandered over to see how Dean was doing every once in a while, offering to get Dean anything he might need. It was nice.
It made him equal to Cas was the thing. It made him — no, he was worthy of Cas whether human or angel. It was just that Cas was an angel and despite his many deaths, he could still live far longer than Dean as a human would ever get to. Dean was sure that if Cas wanted, Jack could fix his wings. Dean had seen what it did to Cas to be human and he couldn’t ask Cas to give up who he was for him.
Cas made a noise that sounded like a chuckle, breath falling over Dean’s lips and chin as Cas pulled back, but Dean chased his lips. Wanted nothing more than to remain there kissing and kissing and kissing.
I wrote this fic, as I said back on ch. 1 because I was inspired by my co-worker. I also wrote it because I needed to find a way to get back to writing after the loss of my dog and I needed something simple and easy and happy and so this came to be and it's really helped me. So I'm glad that, as I saw in a few comments, that it's the kind of fluffy lighthearted thing that has helped on your bad days too.
Dean continued to shake them off. His focus remained on Cas and holding on when it occurred to him that he already had Cas in his hold.
The front came together slower, but just a few months after the remodel started it was all complete. The last thing to go up was the sign outside that read Angel Bakes complete with a halo floating over the A.
Dean was actually over at Cas’ house on a Friday afternoon when Cas got the call that his offer had been accepted. Dean insisted on getting a bottle of champagne to celebrate even though it meant that he had to drive to the nearest liquor store to pick it up first because Cas just didn’t have any on hand. Castiel’s smile didn’t fade from his lips for the rest of the night. He told Dean all of his ideas. How he wanted to set up the kitchen and the display counters and the kind of mixers and ovens that he’d been researching.
To be entirely honest, Dean hadn’t really given bees much thought. He’d heard about the need to protect them and their importance, but not enough to do more than just not get in their way or bother them. None of that meant that he didn’t admire Castiel for his clear devotion.
Cas took him outside through the back door. He had a small deck in the back similar to the front, and Dean had to stop just at the top of the stairs because Cas’ backyard was like nothing Dean had expected. Dean had expected it to look like Lisa’s, to be just grass and nothing more. He should have known better.
“They’re not what they used to be. Nothing like yours are.” Cas’ smile was wistful. “My grace hasn’t been what it was.”
“Look, we can get a little of that done, but then after that we are going out to get some food and then I’ll take you somewhere where you can have a little peace.”
Dean cut him off. “No. I’m here because you were kind enough to bake me a pie. It’s the least that I can do.”
So, he told Cas about all the weird myths and things that he’d been really into when he was younger. About how Dean had at one point been convinced that werewolves and ghosts and vampires, and shapeshifters were real. Cas chuckled as Dean explained the lore and the legends. They shared a look and Dean knew that Cas understood why Dean had been so into his grandfather’s books. Then, Dean told him other things. He told him about how it was his dad that had started teaching him how to fix cars, and how it was one of the few things that Dean had held on to after his dad was gone.
There could have been no other answer, not when saying yes meant that he could have Cas back and that he could tell him the most important three words that Cas would ever hear. It ate at him, knowing that Dean had been so shocked and struck by Cas’ words that nothing had come out of his mouth to dispel what Cas had clearly believed. Cas had been so sure that Dean would never see him that way, that his feelings were one-sided.
They had stepped away from the boxes, but Cas stopped and he looked directly at Dean. “You really mean that, don’t you?”
Maybe the problem was knowing that if he talked about it and that if he said it outloud with words that could be heard, it wasn’t only his anymore. Or that they had saved the world but nothing was alright. Not anymore. Not ever.
Cas shook his head with a grin. “They really don’t sting. I’m just going to lift one of the frames out so you can see them.”
Cas was no more than dead weight. His head hung down against his chest and his tan coat was streaked with black sludge. Dean was never going to let him go.
It was the right choice. He felt it in his bones. Looking at Cas, who had moved on to looking at other flowers and plants, it was easy to imagine him remaining in heaven and being in The Garden.
It was far more like flying than Dean had imagined it would be. His wings were moving and he was moving and it was all happening at a pace that humans would never be able to comprehend, but Dean wasn’t human anymore and he could understand. But The Empty’s soldiers weren’t human either and Dean rising up his single hand still grasping Cas’ wrist didn’t keep them from coming at him and throwing themselves at him and trying to rip Cas away.
They landed inside the bunker, tumbling directly onto a table in the library and sending all the books, notebooks, and empty beer bottles to the floor. Cas flopped onto his side, head thrown back, eyes closed, but Dean could still feel his pulse and he could hear his breathing. More importantly, Dean could see his grace. It was a dull shine, but it was there.
“I can’t,” Jack said in little more than a whisper. “And I have to — they need me back in Heaven, Dean. I…” he trailed off and his head tilted to the side as he looked directly at Dean. “I can’t go to The Empty.”
Dean let his eyes close and he could see Cas with his tears and the way that he had kept his eyes so fixed on him.
The anger that should have come at hearing that stayed at bay, kept back by his pain and by the pain that was reflected in Jack. For Jack, Cas had been a father. Maybe it was unconventional in the way it had come to be with Jack being Lucifer’s son and with Jack not being an actual baby when he was born, but Jack had chosen Cas and Cas had always loved and protected Jack. Not to mention that Dean’s anger at Jack had done more harm than good in the past, so Dean let it simmer and then just turned off the flame entirely.
Dean didn’t really talk about his feelings much. He didn’t talk about his fears or his insecurities or just how overwhelming it really was to be an adult. Dean had grown up fast after his dad died. After Cassie, he’d spent so much time there on that spot trying to figure out why he hadn’t been enough. It wasn’t until years later that Dean came to realize that he and Cassie had both loved each other but not enough for either of them to fully open up or fully be what the other needed. He hadn’t shared his spot with her or many other things and maybe it had been their downfall.
It was nearing 4am, and Jack just appeared in the bunker’s library. Dean was doing research. A few empty beer bottles sat on the table next to him. His notebook had gained very little in notes.
Sam greeted him with a hug. Eileen hugged him next. Neither of them asked about his trip, instead they started showing him information about a new case. Dean had expected his return to be met with more arguments with Sam or for him to want to push about finding a way to bring Cas back, so when they didn’t come Dean just jumped into the new case. Dean supposed that it could have been Eileen’s influence, but for once Sam just left it alone. So, Dean did his research when Sam wasn’t around and he prayed every day.
Dean turned his head and his eyes were on Cas again. Dean hadn’t let go of his wrist, he didn’t think he could let go, but he sat up and he pulled Cas into a more comfortable position on the table. He was frowning in his sleep, mouth turned downward. He was beautiful and he was back and Dean felt like he was in a dream. He was lost in looking at Cas and taking him in. His free hand touched Cas’ face and to Dean’s surprise a blue glow appeared there. Faintly he heard Sam make a noise, but that didn’t matter because Cas’ eyes fluttered. He leaned into Dean’s hand like a cat asking to be pet and then at long last his eyes opened and all Dean could see was blue.
“I think you see it now,” Cas said. “I think you see how absolutely unfounded the things you believed about yourself were.”
Dean didn’t know much about bees or beekeeping, but Castiel got excited when he talked about it and the way he explained everything made it easy for Dean to follow and even when he didn’t, he just liked to hear Cas talk.
He was aware that he didn’t know all, but the comprehension of himself and everything that he’d ever experienced in his life came with a deep awareness of his failings and his mistakes and how none of that mattered in comparison to knowing that his intentions had always been good and that few things had been under his control. It all settled on him at once. Understanding that Cas had always loved him and that Dean’s very soul had been pulled towards the angel from the first moment he laid eyes on him. There was also a lot more about his parents and Sam and the universe at large.
Dean met him halfway, hands reaching for Cas’ jaw and the scruff was surprisinglyand then his lips were pressing against Cas’ for the first time. One of Cas’ hands had climbed up to rest on Dean’s neck and jaw, but his other hand was at first on Dean’s shoulder and then on his wings again and between the kissing and the touch on his feathers, Dean couldn’t help a low moan.
“Well that and because I like you and I’m a good person. And I think after today, we are friends? Right?”
Cas immediately started to protest and to point at all the things he’d planned on doing for the day.
The way that Dean had landed had kept them connected but had banged up his left knee on the table hard, but it was his wings that had done the damage of throwing everything off the table. They had smashed other things too. All of it had made a great deal of noise, so Dean wasn’t surprised when a half-dressed Sam with a gun in hand showed up.
It seemed like that was a part of the whole thing that Cas still needed to wrap his mind around. Dean could tell when Cas’ eyes would go to his wings, how they would get caught up looking at them with something almost wistful.
“He’s gone!” Dean screamed and then in a normal tone, “if Jack could have done something, he would have already done it.” Without even thinking about it, Dean grabbed the half full cup of coffee.
“I’m just wondering if I’m really needed anymore as a hunter,” Dean said. “And if I could actually do it and walk away. Retire.”
Cas had what could only be called, a sprawling garden. There were plants everywhere. Most were growing out of the ground, but quite a few were in pots. Stone steps created paths around the plants to the center of the garden where Cas had a small patio. He had chairs and a table there and Dean could picture Cas there with a mug of tea, something fresh out of his oven on a plate and maybe some music playing. It was peaceful. Relaxing.
Castiel’s kitchen was a mess. There were piles of dirty bowls and other odds and ends in the sink. Very counter space was taken up with trays or cooling racks. Even the top of the stove had trays on it. On the island sat a Kitchen Aid mixer.
Dean kept back. He watched Cas take the top part off and then he used some sort of tool to open up the box. Cas motioned him closer and there they were. Some flew out, but most stayed put walking over the wood and over each other.
“So you became an angel,” Cas said and it wasn’t a question, but he still tilted his head just so as if it were.
Sam had a lot of questions about Dean being an angel and Dean did his best to answer until Eileen asked what Cas had asked earlier.
“It was about damn time that I pay you back for pulling me out of hell. Damn it, Cas, do you have any idea what you did to me? What it did to have you gone after—”
It was better than to admit that Dean would have wanted to do this for Cas even if Cas had taken payment for the pie.
“Things are different now,” Jack said carefully. “The Empty is different. I think that is the problem. If I could — if I could go in there I would…” he trailed off. “I could barely make the time to come here and, Dean, I can’t stay long before I’m needed.”
Dean didn’t get to ask or say anything before Jack grasped his arm. It felt just like the few times that he’d flown with Cas, disconcerting and like he was being pressed into a tiny space. And then, he was no longer in the bunker. He was nowhere. In a space so blank that there was no question about where it was. The Empty.
Cas was smiling his wide happy smile again. His eyes shone and Dean couldn’t help but lean over and kiss him simply because he could. Mere hours ago, Dean could have never imagined actually getting to see Cas again much less being able to kiss him. He had never allowed himself to hope for the fear that he would be disappointed.
Dean should have known better than to tell Sam about Castiel, but he was just so used to telling Sam everything that it had spilled out. He could feel Sam’s judgement.
“I come here to think,” Dean said. “Whenever everything feels like too much. It’s peaceful and then there is just this. Nature, the water, how it isn’t quiet, but my brain can be quiet.”
By the time that they left The Roadhouse, Cas did look more relaxed. He didn’t ask Dean where he was taking him, but he looked curious as they drove. Their drive was silent, broken only by Led Zeppelin playing low from the radio.
“Dean, you just broke up with Lisa a couple of months ago and this guy lives right next door to her. Isn’t it a little—”
Castiel laughed. “No, actually. But I was born on a Thursday and throughout the pregnancy she was sure I’d be a girl and that she would name me Wednesday.”
“What about Cas, Jack?” Dean asked after listening to Jack describe just a few of the things that had kept him busy.
Dean walked. The black emptiness went on and on with nothing to distinguish any part of it from another. It did, strangely enough, give him time to take grasp of himself. He felt better than ever. His knees didn’t ache and any tension that he’d carried on his shoulders was gone. And on his back he could feel his wings. They felt natural, and he moved them into his own view without thought, the black feathers weren’t just black but iridescent. In the bleakness of The Empty they almost shone with every hue. They were beautiful.
Dean dropped the spatula in his hand. “Pie fest,” he repeated. “And you’re only just now mentioning this? I think we have the location of our next date, Cas.”
Pie fest was everything that Dean had expected it to be and being able to fully taste all of the pies made it even better. Having Cas next to him and a tray full of plates of every pie that there had been and with Sam and Eileen signing at each other, Dean didn’t think he would ever feel happier. It was exactly how things should be.
Jack nodded. “I can,” he said. “I wasn’t sure that you would want to give up all that power. But I know your soul and I know who you are, so it isn’t surprising.”
Dean had thought about it before. It was what had prompted him to pray to Jack and ask for him to bring Cas back. If Jack was on that level of power it wasn’t implausible to think that Jack would be able to do it.
His voice was that deep gravely warm that Dean had missed desperately. Dean wanted to wrap himself in it.
Castiel put an offer in through a realtor the next day. It had been a month since Dean had met Cas, but it felt like he’d known him far longer. Sam pointed out that that was probably because Dean spent most of his free time with Castiel and Dean couldn’t actually deny that.
They met some of the angels and they gave Dean odd glances which Dean figured had to do with him technically being one of them now. Cas received shocked looks and more than one glare. Jack took them to The Garden. Dean had been there once before and the whole experience still felt more like a dream than anything. It didn’t look the same as it had back then. Now it was wild and huge. It just kept going and going and he imagined that it contained any and all plants. It was beautiful. He saw Cas stop at a flower he couldn’t identify, leaning in to give it a sniff and then he kept leaning there and Dean spotted a few bees that had caught his attention.
“It’ll need to cool still, if you want to hang out for a while. Unless you need to go because that’s fine too and I really shouldn’t keep you. It’s Friday night. I bet you have plans and yet you’re stuck here instead when I said I would—“
They shared another quick kiss. Dean had never expected to experience a relationship the way that it was with Cas. The ease that came with it that told Dean he was exactly where he should be. They had gone on a few dates since Cas’ return. Out to eat, or to the movies, bowling, and once — while Dean could still fly them places — Dean had taken Cas out to the beach. And those things were fun and doing them with Cas was even better, especially when he got to introduce Cas to something new.
“We do have to talk, Dean,” Cas said, removing his hand from Dean’s feathers and then taking a step back.
Dean was suddenly reminded that they hardly knew each other and yet he felt such a need to comfort and uplift this man who was beautiful and who Dean couldn’t help but admire because Dean had never met someone that would just bake a whole day away only to give it all away.
When Cas’ fingers made contact with his wing the feathers shone. It was a light so blinding that Dean had the afterthought to hope that his brother had shielded his eyes. The rest of him relished the touch.
“No. You are human, Dean. The best human. If they were all like you, this world would be very different. But my wings are gone and one day I won’t even have what is left. I’m appreciating them until they are gone. That’s all.”
Eventually, it wouldn’t have been enough. Dean knew that. All his research had been leading nowhere and if Jack had truly not had a way to bring Cas back, Dean doubted that he would have kept holding on. It was a scary thing to realize about himself, how deep in his subconscious Dean had known that there was an easier choice. A way to leave his misery behind.
And then there was the other aspects. The sex. Dean wasn’t shy about how much sex he’d had over the years and although it had happened very few times, sometimes it hadn’t been all women. With Cas, just like everything else, it was different. It meant more and it was satisfying because it brought them closer emotionally and physically. It was the most perfect thing.
Dean prayed to Jack too after the first week. Every night it was first a prayer to Cas and then a follow up to Jack.
What he was now, the grace that existed within him could easily tell Dean how often he’d said those words in his adult life and how often he hadn’t meant it or been convinced that he did when he didn’t. And the few times it had been real, none of them felt at all like the full encompassing love that he felt for Cas.
Cas’ lips parted in a gasp. For a long moment they just stared at each other and there was no doubt in Dean’s mind that they were both marveling at being together. Because despite everything that had occurred, the whole of it still felt like a dream. There was no looming threat. there was no danger to either of their lives. They could just be.
“You told me he was gone,” Claire said accusingly at Dean. Her eyes flickered towards Sam too, but they settled on Dean.
Their foreheads were pressed together and their breath mingled between them. There was still a lot that needed to be discussed. Cas needed to be filled in on more than just the bullet points that Dean had given him. Jack would need to return and see his father or maybe Cas would need to go to Jack. Dean could probably even go with him if he wanted to. The first thing was talking to Sam.
“Leave it alone, Sam! He’s gone. That’s it. Leave it alone! We are never going to see him again and that’s that! He’s gone just like mom and like dad and Bobby and...and even Jack.”
Jack didn’t respond. He didn’t appear and he didn’t send any messages. Dean prayed to Jack every day for two months until he finally just stopped.
“You still have a soul,” Jack said. “It is an extension of your grace. My father was right, there is no soul quite like yours. That has made this easier, Dean. And now,  I will send you to The Empty.”
Dean didn’t see himself like Cas did. He understood himself and the things he had done and the choices he made. He could connect more dots to fully comprehend that there was more driving him than ego or anger or believing he could never have more than that life John Winchester had put him on.
“I think we’ll have to talk to Jack,” Dean said. “We’ll have to go to him. But Cas, this affects you too. What do you want?”
Dean had fully expected the first hurdle to be getting the financials in place. But Cas already had the money. It made everything easier.
The thing about spending time with Cas was that it was the easiest thing in the world. It was easier than any of the time he’d spent dating Lisa and better than spending time with Sam who, as a little brother, just tended to get annoying after a while. With Cas, Dean lost track of time. He forgot about everything else and lived in the moment they were sharing even when Cas brought the conversation back to the bakery and all the work that he still needed to do and Dean had to talk him down into relaxing.
“Look,” Dean said. “I hardly know you. But what I do know is that you have some skills. And if your dream is to open up your own bakery, then you should fight for it. You should go for it. I’ll be your number one customer. And, Cas, I swear you’ll do really well.”
He could still taste. It just wasn’t the same as it was before. For one thing, hunger wasn’t a thing so eating something didn’t quench any real desire. It wasn’t satisfactory like it had once been. Saltier and sweeter things had a better taste but Dean could also now name every single ingredient that had gone into something and sometimes he didn’t taste the whole component but each separate flavor. And then there was the molecule thing that Cas had been going on about because that was a thing and it wasn’t pleasant.
Thinking about Cas ignited something, a spark that appeared as the singular thing other than Dean in the space. It beckoned and Dean followed.
He was right. Of course he was right because it hadn’t all even been about Dean. Everything had been at stake and Cas had had to make that decision. Really, it went back to Cas’ decision to make that deal with The Empty in the first place. And not just that, but his decision to keep the deal to himself. It had been such a blindsight, but worse on looking at it now, Dean had to imagine that Cas had been avoiding finding true happiness ever since. Dean had probably made that easy for him with how much he pushed Cas away. How much he lay the blame on Cas.
His voice was different, it had taken on a strange crispness and with it authority. When Dean looked at him he was still Jack, but he glowed as if a stagelight was pointing at him. It didn’t last long before it disappeared and there was just Jack left.
“Cas,” Dean said and his grip tightened on Cas’ wrist. The hand on Cas’ cheek swept over the space under Cas’ eye.
Something about his will to leave and the way that his wings were being weighed down by the soldiers and realizing that it was really Cas in his hold, it brought his grace forward and in a flash all the soldiers were torn apart, falling in black thick rain drops as Dean finally and properly flew out of The Empty gripping Cas tight.
“Kid came back with a dog. Bones. My mom made our dad let us keep him but somehow I was the one that ended up taking Bones out on walks all the time.”
Bone and sinew ripped and it must have been the worst of it, because he was sure that he blacked out for some of it. When he became aware again, it was on his knees, doubled over on the hardwood floor and feeling like something heavy had settled on his back and wasn’t letting him up.
If Sam knew about Dean’s research or about how often Dean tried to reach out to Jack, Sam said nothing about it. A part of Dean hoped that Sam did know about it and another part that Sam had no clue. Most of the time, it did seem like Sam had no idea. Between Eileen and the network of hunters that were always reaching out, Sam kept busy. The few times that he did bring up Cas it was casual and not like he was trying to get any reaction out of Dean.
“I don’t know if that’s better or worse than being named after my grandmother,” Dean said with a grin.
“Well, my grandfather did well for himself and when he passed and he left me all that money, I knew what I would do with it,” Castiel said. “And when it didn’t work out when Balt and I were — well, I just never touched it.”
The wood planks were not in a horrible state. Dean figured that eventually they would need to be replaced, but they weren’t there yet. So, instead he made work of getting all of Cas’ steps to have better attachments to the supports. It was quick work, but he kept getting distracted by watching Cas.
They walked on the stone steps and Dean admired some of the plans. He could recognize some. White daisies and yellow honeysuckle next to a beautiful dark purple flower that seemed to shoot out from between two floppy long leaves. There were lilies, and a row where lavender grew next to rosemary and thyme and rue. Cas had flowers of every color all mixed throughout. Dean spotted sunflowers, yellow beauties that stood almost as tall as he was.
“Different but the same,” Dean said. “I just understand things and I see more.” He reached behind Cas and gently touched Cas’ wing.
“Been in heaven, hell, and purgatory. Makes sense I’d get to come here too,” Dean said more to himself than anything because there really was no one and Jack hadn’t given him any instructions.
Dean didn’t respond. He did kinda hope that his friendship with Cas would develop into more, but it was something he was keeping close to the chest for the moment even if to his brother he would always be obvious.
The thing of it was that Dean had thought about it before. Somewhere in his notebook full of notes was a list of all the times Cas had died and what he knew about them and Cas’ return to life. Jack was right in saying that Cas had been resurrected by Chuck. Back then they hadn’t known about The Empty or what it was for but if it was supposed to hold all the angels that died, then they had to presume that Chuck had brought Cas back from there. Chuck would know how he’d done it. Chuck was also now stuck as a human forever and unlikely to help.
Dean had never flown before. He knew only that it wasn’t like the flight of a bird or a plane. It was more like creating a fold in the very fabric of reality and bending space and time to fit his means. He gripped Cas tighter and he willed to go wishing that Jack had allowed him to practice it just once, except that he suddenly he just knew what to do and then when it happened it didn’t feel unpleasant.
It did take them a few trips before they found the right place. Dean didn’t tell Cas right away that Singer Auto was only a few blocks away, but he was glad for the fact. It was on a corner and only a couple of blocks away from Singer Auto. It had been formerly a dog grooming place, and before that a pizza restaurant, and before that a dry cleaner, but none of those businesses had taken off.
Heat washed out of it, and Cas put on oven mitts that matched his apron and his mailbox because bees of all sizes were on them.
Knowing fully well that there could be nothing to do to bring Cas back, Dean returned to the bunker and promised himself that he would try. Not with any expectation or hope, but just because not trying felt like giving up on Cas altogether and that was one thing that Dean would never do.
It happened slowly, and Dean could tell he was changing almost entirely because of how food tasted and how he started to want food and sleep. His wings were one of the last things to go and having their weight removed from his back was weirdly freeing. Cas seemed more affected by them disappearing. Sometimes, Dean caught him reaching behind Dean as if to touch them only to remember a moment later that they weren’t there.
For some reason, Sam never pushed after the first few days. He never asked questions or tried to get Dean to talk about Cas probably because the first time Cas came up, right after everything went down, Dean had yelled and thrown things and then he’d picked up a bottle of Jack Daniels and when that one was gone he drank another all spaced out with beer and yet the pain was never dulled. The headache and nausea from the next day made him forget for a few moments and then it just added on.
It was Cas’ love that had held him together. Knowing it had kept him from truly drowning himself in alcohol. It had kept him from being overcome by the grief and the anger and the pain even while it had all been there in him nonetheless. It wasn’t like the time before this one when Dean had had Cas’ body as a representation that he was gone. Where he had been the one to prepare the body and then he and Sam had put him on that pyre. Dean had gone as far as to collect the ashes because Cas deserved more. Then, there had been Jack to pour his anger against. This time, there was just Dean. But Cas loved him and it was everything.
Cas, as Dean had come to learn, was brilliant if a bit behind on pop culture. There were few movies that Cas had actually seen and fewer tv shows. Things went over his head all the time and Dean had started — albeit slowly — giving Castiel a sort of education. He’d all but demanded that Cas have a movie night with him a few weeks earlier entirely so that Dean could put on A New Hope and transform Castiel into a Star Wars fan. He was pleased when Cas actually did enjoy the movie.
Dean didn’t regret it. He just didn’t know if he wanted to stay that way or if Jack would give him the option to return to his old self. In the end, he knew it didn’t matter as long as Cas was alive and as long as he was at Dean’s side.
Cas looked away. “I heard plenty from Lisa. But, and I guess it’s alright to say now, I didn’t feel like she was all that invested ”
“You didn’t give me time to say it back,” Dean said. “But I do love you, Cas. And isn’t it better reciprocated. To have it and know it.”
Dean laughed. “Did I rave about your pie nonstop to anyone that would listen? Yes, Cas, I did. And not just that…you’re an impressive guy. I am amazed by you.”
The kitchen looked far better than when Dean had first seen it by the time he had finished drying all the trays and pans. He was putting the trays away where Cas had pointed when the oven timer went off.
Dean had spent a lot of nights sitting on the hood of his car watching the stars there. He’d gone there to make hard decisions, or when life got hard and he just needed a place to go. It was not a place he had shared with anyone. Not Sammy. Not his mom. Not his dad. Not Cassie. Not Lisa. And it wasn’t like the spot was hard to get to or a secret, it was just that Dean had never told anyone that it was a place where he went. Cas was different and the number one thing that made him different was that while any of the others would understand why Dean went there or even appreciate the peace and quiet or how little light pollution existed there, they wouldn’t get it. Not like Castiel would.
Dean had known power before. He had had the mark of Cain on him, he had been a demon, and when Michael had used him as a vessel, Dean had been aware enough to know what that power felt like. What Jack had made him, it was different and greater than all of that. But more than that, it came with knowing.
Cas looked down to his feet. “You’ve done so much already,” he said at last. “Too much. And Lisa said...well, she said that I was monopolizing your time and then I realized that of course I was and of course there are other things you’d want to be doing. This isn’t — the bakery isn’t your dream. As much as I love the push you gave me, I shouldn’t be relying on you like this. It isn’t fair, not when there’s other things you should be doing.”
What Sam definitely didn’t know was Cas’ last words before he was taken or the exact reason why The Empty had come for Cas in that moment and Dean didn’t want him to know them.
Sam would have asked if there would be repercussions of what Jack was about to do. He would have asked about what would happen afterwards. Dean would have shut him up and done it anyway.
Jack leans away from the hug. “I have some errands to run. This space is for you to do with as you will. A home.”
He parks, and sits there. Shy, just for a moment, but he knows he is loved, can feel it in away he couldn’t before, thanks to the angelic upgrade. He takes a second to pull his grace, and isn’t that a kick in the head, into him. He doesn’t want to startle Cas.
Jack grins again, full of mischief. “That’s funny because I can.” Before Dean reacts, Jack places his hand on Dean’s forehead and pushes.
“And besides, now that we have fixed Heaven, as an archangel, my place is overseeing the hosts and spreading free will.”
“I was hoping to stay for a little while?” Jack tentatively states as they walk down to the lake to watch Miracle swim.
Jack darts in and gives him a hug. Cas has been his uncle, father, and now, Jack hugs him with all the power and comfort of Cas’s own father.
Upstairs there are three bedrooms, not that he needs sleep, but he’s gotten used to the rhythms of a human life. Towards the front of the house is a guest bedroom, with an extra long bed and full of empty bookshelves. The next bedroom is Jack’s. It’s empty for the moment. He wants Jack to decorate it himself. The whole back of the house is the Master suite. He passes by a bathroom holding a large jacuzzi surrounded with ledges for candles and Cas aches but he holds himself together until he sees the master bedroom.
The drive from the bridge back to the Roadhouse takes no time at all, and Dean is almost happy, driving his baby, Sam next to him. But he knows this isn’t everything. He’s died before he could really live and Sam’s lived a whole life. He’s learned to live without Dean, has in fact lived longer without Dean than with him. It’s heaven and Sam is gonna find Eilleen and Dean, Dean wants Cas. He wants to see his angel, he wants to tell him he’s sorry didn’t get a chance to speak. He wants to say that he loves him too. And if Cas still wants him, he wants to build a life together, the way they couldn’t on earth.
Dean leans his head back, watching as Cas absorbs the words, finds the truth in them and grins. He holds them steady as Cas leans into him.
Jack smiles at him, sadly. “I didn’t bring you back to be miserable and while you have been extraordinary helping me right everything, I didn’t bring you back for that either. I want you to be happy.”
His son, who was now God, who had reached into the Empty and pulled Cas out, reshaped as an Archangel, fit to Cas’s own preference. His body was no longer his vessel, but now a manifestation of how Cas sees himself, down to the skewed tie and trench coat. It had been his vessel for a fraction of a fraction of his lifetime and yet still feels more right as his angelic form than his other forms.
“Hello, Dean.” He hears from behind. He turns and there is Jack, looking as young as he did the last time Dean saw him.
“I wasn’t the best father, I didn’t know how. But I am willing to learn.” He opens his arms as Jack throws himself into them.
“I want you to take a vacation. You have been working non-stop and now that things are stable, you should take some time. I won’t force you but I would like to spend time with you, not here, Like we used to.” He ducks his head, looks up at Cas, eyes peering through his lashes.
The house flickers into a small two storey house with a garage. The outside is light blue with a large porch. He ignores the garage, knowing he’ll never enter it but nevertheless pleased that it’s there. He opens the door and steps onto a hallway. Empty weapon racks line the left side and a coat rack with a lone brown leather jacket hangs on the right. The wall on the left drops away to a large living room with a huge TV. To the right is a small dining nook, a table for 4 which opens to a large kitchen, with every appliance and an island which looks out over the lake. Next to the kitchen are stairs that lead up and on the other side covering the whole rest of the back of the house is a huge library that looks out over the lake, with a sturdy oak desk and plush couches for reading, shelves over flowing books. There are weapon racks here that are full, and Cas tenderly strokes a facsimile of an angel blade.
“I do. Honestly, I didn’t need him to tell me. The love you shared was tangible. He looked at you like you hung the stars and you looked at him like he was the sun.”
“Now that you’ve got your brother, there are a bunch of people who want to say hello.” Bobby says and inclines his head to the bar.
Jack reaches out and straightens his tie. “Your place is wherever you damn well please. You deserve peace and to be happy.”
He had no idea how to tell them they were wrong-- Luís and RJ, and shitty twenty-five-year-old Dean too. That the boring part couldn’t possibly be boring to him anymore because he was happy to be alive now, even if it meant getting old. Because he was too in love, and yeah goddamn it, fucking whipped to think the boring part was boring or that freedom was anywhere else than in choosing what he chose.
So when Dean stood up and let out a noise like an elderly bear deflating under a boulder, he shouldn’t have been surprised.
The reservation was at 7:00 pm, but it was about a two-hour drive, longer if it did start snowing. He needed to shower and get garage stink off him. He had to take Miracle for a walk. He had to corral Cas into getting dressed on time, or he’d be sitting around in his slutty yoga pants reading some forbidden text on omens or some shit until quarter after 5 if Dean let him. He needed to leave early for logistics.
Dean halted his own eyeroll despite the fact that Cas wasn't there to see and be bitchy about it. Dean had expected a more involved level of fussing--
Dean stepped out of the walk-in but still watched Cas get dressed. He still dressed in a lot of layers when they went out, but usually wound up looking like a confused professor. And he always kifed an item or two of Dean’s. And Dean watched him put on both Dean’s black briefs and white button down. And sure, when Cas walked out he was wearing tan slacks and a dark green sweater with elbow patches, which a jacket folded over his arm.
He replied, “Fuck no. Cas and I don’t dance. Well, at least not on dancefloors. Wait, hey, how much do you and Cas talk? Because I didn’t know you had this conspiratorial life plan thing for me going on. Or is the gossip in this place that bad?”
Being a little flabby these days didn’t normally bother him too much. Neither of them were as fighting fit as they were ten years ago, or even five. Cas was utterly human now, his former vessel now fully the meat and bones walked the world in, felt in, and aged in. Cas had his own battles with the world of physical limitations too. He ran, meditated, generally ate better than Dean, and took a special enthusiasm in fight training would-be hunters, but he also had a fucked up shoulder, bad eyesight, and a coffee addiction. So of course Cas wasn’t as limitless as he’d been on angel software. And he wasn’t as skinny as he'd been when Jimmy handed over his pilates and protein shake ass to Cas either. That’s just what age and semi-retirement did.
But the extent of Dean’s relationship to RJ and Luís could really only be described was “guys in a garage.” They talked about cars and not much else. Although he and Luís did spend last summer heatedly updating each other about the season tournament for Wrestlefest when they were visiting Kansas City. They knew Dean was with a man, and actually seemed to, like, not want to offend what they thought were Dean’s gay sensibilities. Which was awkward but nice. So there wasn’t even much traditional macho bullshit Dean had been used to with “guys in a garage” when he was younger. But the closest they got to bonding was basically insulting each other and laughing about it.
Dean gestured to himself, firmly on two feet, and even took a few steps to prove he could walk. He didn't even limp. It wasn’t even that much of a front. Yeah, he’d overdone it a little during the week, but the low throb wasn’t too bad. His knee didn’t feel like giving out. He would be fine and that wasn’t a lie.
Having spent most of the day feeling busted and old, Dean was pretty pleased he could flip the switch on Cas’s fierce and lustful gaze that quick, even while still wearing his old man lumbar support belt.
“Fear is part of becoming human,” Cas said. “Whether it helps or hinders you depends on your reaction to fear, not having fear itself.”
And he knew if he said anything, the Spock to his Kirk here would just tell him it was an illogical thing to worry about since Cas was in love with Dean’s soul, and had given up being an immortal angel for Dean, and was currently sitting naked on top of him.
Dean sighed and allowed himself to be pulled back off the bed. And they even kept the shower relatively hands off, because Cas was pretty dedicated to proving a point when he wanted to be. Especially when it was annoying to Dean.
and Dean just wasn’t going to dignify that with a response because as of tomorrow morning he would be fifty.
Dean’s phone buzzed in the pocket of his coveralls. It was a text from Sam. He checked the time first but it was only 8 minutes from the last time he looked.
Dean nodded. If Cas thought they were disastrously unprepared or wouldn’t take advice, he would have probably waylaid the kids, and maybe would have gotten Claire or somebody else to arrange a group to look into their vamps instead. Hopeful was really the best anyone could get and anything more concrete than that was just a guess.
And sure enough, Cas barely contained a disapproving eyeroll and slipped the palms of his hands over Dean’s chest down to the soft sides of his belly. “That’s nothing you need to worry about. It’s not a chore.” Cas lifted a hand and brushed over Dean’s forehead. For a second there was the old familiar feeling of shivering nerves before Cas healed him, but that little electric embrace of grace touching him from cell to cell was long gone. Cas just had warm hands now. Not entirely un-electric in their own way.
Cas knows he is being played, knows that this is a manipulation but he also knows that Jack means well. And he is tired.
He strokes the steering wheel for a moment and pops out leaving the sword behind. Cas’s grace is calling to him from behind the house and he makes his way around, absently noting the details. He sees a figure, so achingly familiar standing on the dock and he wants to cry.
“Perhaps you will find it silly. But with everything that happened. We never really got the chance to be a family, not really. I find that I want that, with you. I am a being of unlimited power and I find that what I want most is to know family, beyond the host.”
Jack reaches out and grabs his shoulder and before Cas can blink they are in a plot of heaven that isn’t on any of Cas’s maps.
He throws the sword into the back seat and a thought moves his wings into between and he can fit into Baby.
Dean lifts the sword and points it at him. “We will have a conversation about surprises and proper warnings another time. I have somewhere I have to be.”  He doesn’t want to risk flying. The knowledge is there but he’s rather not risk landing like a drunken parrot in front of Cas.
He can feel something lighten within him. It’s the first time he has said it out loud. And it’s true, he loves Cas.
Dean grins back, happily to see the being who he had viewed as a son so happy. “It seems to be missing one thing.” He says. “Where’s Cas?”
Cas kneels down, mentally shaking off the shock. The dog is adorable and Cas feels something inside himself warm. Maybe companionship won’t be so bad.
Standing there, with Jack next to him, Miracle splashing around, Cas thinks to himself that maybe he can be happy, incomplete as he is, that maybe eternity won’t be so lonely.
He’s in his office one day drafting orders for a new unit of Guardian Angels when Jack knocks softly.
“He’s happy, he has Sam, and Bobby, and his family, and I have my work.” Cas lets himself lean into Jack in a moment of vulnerability before pulling back.
Cas smiles softly  at Jack, heart full. “I know. And I am. I am content to love. I never expected that he return that love. I have given him a heaven to be at peace in. It is enough.”
“Hiya, Cas.” He releases the coat and raises his hands to cup Cas’s face. He rubs his thumbs along the cheekbones the way he never allowed himself to think.
Cas took a long silence. The question was unanswerable, really. Luck had more to do with it than anyone wanted to know. But Cas was the one to spend time with them.
Luís made a whip crack sound, and then both those little pissants broke into laughter. Which was at least better than being concerned for his safety just for standing up.
“Yeah, well I was going home for the day anyway so save yourself the trouble of reporting to Mimi.” Who was apparently reporting to Cas. Dean knew teaching Cas to use a cell phone had been a mistake.
“That turned out less sexy than I was aiming for,” Dean said through a sigh, slowly unbending his knee. It detracted a bit from seeing Cas pull off his slutty yoga pants and underwear all in one go.
“Seriously though, why don’t you get married? Don’t you have kids that are, like, older than me?” Elisa said.
“She baked sometimes, but the only thing she could really nail was pie and to be honest it was store bought crust. But it was amazing. Best pie I ever ate before yours.”
Past the patio, they continued on until they were approaching what looked like six wooden boxes. They sat a few feet apart from each other and Cas approached the closest one.
It made him think about the life that he and Sam had led for so long. The constant moving and chasing down leads for possible supernatural threats. How never settling down had hurt any chance of a normal life. Even the Men of Letters bunker was so far away from normal that it couldn’t fully function as a home.
“Like I guess I understand because I keep making you pies, but I haven’t even been baking lately and I’m trying to, you know, handle things and yet you’re still helping me and you came today and…”
Dean hadn’t been a reader like Sam was a reader, but that didn’t mean that Dean hadn’t read anything and Carver Edlund had written books in many different genres — it was what had made him so popular — but he’d also written a series of books about two brothers who travelled the world hunting ghosts and other supernatural beings and Dean had been obsessed with them for a long time.
Cas turned so that he was facing Dean, the space between them practically nonexistent. “This is only happening because of you,” Cas informed him before wrapping his arms around Dean’s shoulders.
Slowly, it all began to settle. He didn’t feel like before, but the discomfort eased and there were other things to focus on like how much more he could hear and see and how he could feel wings at his back. There was the thrum of power too, energy that existed within him and that was like nothing Dean had ever felt before.
Dean had imagined how seeing Cas would feel, how happy he would be and how things might play out, but his imagination didn’t account for Cas himself and for how the reality would feel. How all his emotions would become a tangled ball of yarn with so many starts and ends that no single thing took precedence. There was so much to say. So much that needed explaining. Cas had been gone months, long months that Dean had somehow existed through. But one required repeating.
His hands were still in the substance and it started to move, flicking up and at him from below, above, and all sides. His wings lifted up as protection and none of it touched him even while around him it was becoming more and more volatile and through it all, Dean held onto Cas.
He must have been feeling tired, because Castiel relented without arguing and so after Dean helped bring in the rest of the boxes from Cas’ car, Dean made Cas get into the Impala and then drove him to The Roadhouse for an early lunch.
Dean threw the mug at the nearest wall. The ceramic shattered and the coffee splattered on the wall and dripped down.
It was nearing morning by the time that their conversation ended. Dean hadn’t slept in over twenty-four hours. It was a strange thing to know, but stranger to know he didn’t need it at all. And that he wasn’t hungry.
Castiel was so busy getting the bakery ready for the grand opening once the remodel was done, that Dean barely saw him over the next few weeks unless it was to help him around Angel Bakes. Cas had even stopped baking on Fridays even if that meant that he wasn’t taking anything over to the soup kitchen and shelter. Cas also still had his job to go to in the meanwhile. Every time that Dean saw him, the dark circles under his eyes grew and grew and he looked so stressed that Dean thought he’d even started to lose weight.
In The Empty, his wings had been huge. Their scope and size had been able to wrap around him and shield him from The Empty’s soldiers. They had been so big and Dean had just known it. In the bunker they were smaller and fit in between dimensions and as much as Dean could feel them on his back, he knew they were actually invisible to humans. But Cas was an angel and it must have been jarring for him to see Dean with angel wings.
So, Dean resolved to spend as much time away from their house and when his dad passed on the Impala to him, he had the freedom to really go places. It was how he’d found the spot by the lake.
For some reason they didn’t tell Claire about Dean being an angel, but she did have a long conversation with Cas and afterwards when she hugged Dean afterwards, Claire muttered how happy she was that they were together.
So, Dean explained. He didn’t go into detail to how Dean had dealt with Cas being gone, but he mentioned praying to Jack and about how Jack hadn’t answered until he just showed up. How Jack had struggled to find a way to bring Cas back because he couldn’t personally go and fetch him and so it had fallen to Dean.
Dean’s wings were folded over him, covering him when the soldiers arrived and Dean felt the way that they came at him. His wings fluttered to push them away and yet Dean still felt the sharp something that kept hitting him over and over and then the grasping hands that were trying to pull him away.
Cas had a small shed off in the corner of his yard. It didn’t take up too much space and Dean suspected that all of Cas’ gardening tools would be in there.
No day could end without Dean telling Cas about his day. Even when he stopped praying to Jack nightly, he would still pray to Cas.
Cas used his metal took again and then with his bare hands he reached in and withdrew one of the wooden frames. Bees were everywhere on it. Some crawled right onto Cas’ hands but he didn’t seem to mind them when they did. Dean didn’t know what he had expected, but what he saw was amazing. And Cas being careful of squishing them and the way that he moved with such precision and care was hotter than anything Dean had ever seen. It was such a distraction, that whatever Cas had been telling him about the hive didn’t fully register.
Sam had given him one of his patented looks that screamed of pity and sadness. “We saved the world. There has to be a—”
Dean dropped his head into his hands. None of it was right. Jack couldn’t do anything and he was God. If Jack couldn’t bring him back there was no hope and no way to imagine that it could ever happen at all. His face was wet. Dean had cried for Cas so often since the day he was taken that as he wiped them away angrily, he was well aware that they would not be the last tears.
Cas hummed and he talked to his plants. He spent a long time checking on all of his plants, attentive in a way that Dean had never known anyone to be with plants.
Pink tinged Cas’ cheeks. It was almost subtle, but Dean could see it and it was adorable. He was adorable.
Cas sat on the edge of the table. His hands gripped the edge so tight that his knuckles had gone white, but he pushed off of it, falling into step and taking the remaining one to make it to where Dean stood. He looked wild, hair standing in every direction, and behind him the wings that Dean had never before been allowed to actually see. They were limp and with hardly any feathers left and yet they twitched up and curved towards Dean.
“And it’s only happening because of you,” Castiel said. “Really, Dean, that money would have sat in the bank and I wouldn’t have done any of this, but you...you made it possible. If anyone is amazed by anyone here, it should be me. And today...you brought me here. Dean, it’s like you know just what I need.”
“I saw you once,” Cas said, speaking for the first time. “You and Lisa were out in her yard and I saw you. You looked happy.”
Apparently, Castiel’s grandfather had been very well off. So well off that when he died, he left a sizable amount of money to his favorite grandchild.
They had walked to the front of the car and Dean motioned for him to get on the hood. They sat side by side up there.
It was more than Dean had expected. More than he could have ever hoped for. The hug lasted longer than the kisses, but even that came to an end and Cas found his hand and tugged him towards the table and then into two chairs.
Cas looked like he was going to be stubborn about it. But, Dean was stubborn too. Which was how he found himself filling up Castiel’s dishwasher and then hand wishing the rest while Cas put away the things that had already cooled off in containers.
Castiel was at a loss for words, but his cheeks had gone that lovely pink again. Dean wanted nothing more than to lean over and kiss him. He just didn’t know if it was something that Cas would want. His blush said a lot, but there was also just so much else on Cas’ shoulders and Dean didn’t want to add to that.
Castiel jumped into the topic, telling Dean all about how he thought he might get to harvest some honey in the next week or so since a few of the frames looked like they were getting quite full.
Dean lifted his hand. “No. No. I — caught me by surprise is all. I’m bi, Cas. You being gay, that doesn’t bother me.”
It was kinda awkward because they were on the hood of his car and so it was more like Cas was lying on him and just holding on, but Dean wrapped his arms around Cas back and Cas’ head was somehow tucked into the crook of his neck. It was as if they had been made to fit together.
It had been a while since Dean had been with a guy. Before Lisa there had been a string of one night stands mostly of the female variety but there had been a guy or two in the mix. In all actuality, Dean had never dated a man. He’d never done the relationship thing with a guy. Looking at Castiel and his pink cheeks, the way that his blue eyes glittered, and how his lips lifted up at the edges as he opened his oven.
“I don’t care what you are or what I am,” Dean found himself saying, “not when the parts that matter stay. Most caring man in the world, huh?”
Not that Dean wouldn’t have minded if it turned into more, but for the moment he and Castiel were just friends.
Dean had forgotten how much Jack looked like Cas. He had changed little in his time away, he still even wore jeans and t-shirt. He could have just been coming out of his room to see why Dean was still awake, curious and puppy-like in his excitement to help. That was missing from him, because his lips were pressed into a line and he looked serious.
A few months ago a coworker made a comment about how happy he was after breaking up with his girlfriend, but that he missed the muffins. I asked if she baked and he told me about the ex's neighbor baked every weekend and always brought them over some of whatever they baked. And I immediately got the idea for this fic.
“Hey, I’m happy to be here. And not just because of the pie. To be honest, I expected you to be a middle aged woman with a love for baking. I was expecting someone that I wouldn’t know what to say to. But instead it’s you…and, Cas, you are the most interesting person I’ve met in a while.”
“We’re friends for one thing,” Dean said. “We went over that already, haven’t we? But, Cas, I’m not just bothering with you. I’m…I enjoy spending time with you. I look forward to it any time we have plans and I miss you when we don’t. I love our conversations, but even just sitting there watching you bake is enough.”
He felt Cas’ fingers. It was gentle and almost not there and yet it was pleasant like someone running fingers through his hair but somehow even better and Cas’ fingers dug deep into his feathers.
Jack showed them around and from the way that Cas reacted, Dean could tell that things were different. Things in heaven had changed. Dean hung back and watched it all. The man — angel — he loved and his son who was God and technically just a few years old. And maybe Cas belonged at Jack’s side in heaven helping with all the changes and making sure that Jack was making the right decisions.
“And now Jack is God,” Cas said and there was just a smidge of disbelief. “And he made you an angel.”
“I have no idea. Maybe,” Castiel said with the confused tilt of his head that meant he didn’t understand what Dean was talking about.
“I’m just getting everything together. It’s been so much, Dean. I’m starting with all the pans and stuff I’ll need but I’ve been looking at suppliers and there’s just so much to order and to figure out. And I have to start getting a menu ready. It’s been a lot.”
Slowly, he moved off the table, but couldn’t get himself to let go of Cas’ wrist as if doing so would mean that Cas would just disappear, so as he moved Cas moved with him, sitting up on the table. His trenchcoat was still streaked with back and under it his tie was rumpled and askew.
It was strange, turning to face Sam. For one thing, Dean could see his soul, and he could also see that Sam was confused and deny it all he wanted, scared. And worried.
Dean rearranged them. He sat up a little and pulled Cas into his side, marveling just a little at how electric it felt to touch Cas, but also how physical contact had never been easier.
“They were beautiful. A reflection of you,” Cas said. “And they’re not fully gone yet. I can still feel them and see them sometimes. I give it a couple more days.”
“I don’t want it to be like it was,” Jack told them. “Everyone being apart. I want it to be open...like it’s supposed to be. A place to rest. To be happy.”
Laughter poured out of him, the kind that was genuine and that was joyous. He had laughed so little in so long that the sound almost sounded foreign. His eyes found where he held Cas’ wrist and all at once it became real. It was Cas that he was holding. There was nothing quite like the relief and the euphoria that was present in him just at being able to touch his angel and it was only his fear that he might drop him in the middle of flight that kept Dean from pulling him into his arms.
Dean knew his brother and he knew his brother meant well, that Sam had cared for Cas too, but that didn’t change the facts and in those first initial days when he was still trying to wrap his mind around the other thing, hope that they could bring Cas back was the last thing on his mind. He didn’t need Sam making unfounded promises that they would find a way when Dean knew their chances were slim and that Jack would have interfered and brought Cas back if there was a way.
“It won’t hurt to have this type of mojo on hunts, will it?” Dean asked. “I know Chuck is gone and things in heaven and hell are well in hand, but the monsters we hunt are still out there. I don’t know.”
They spent the morning right into the afternoon together. Cas was never far and if they weren’t touching in some way, they were within reach of each other. Dean’s wings seemed to lean towards Cas, wrapping behind Cas or just pointing at him but always aware of where Cas was. Cas never seemed to stop himself from glancing at them or touching them.
Castiel got back to piling up his dirty trays and bowls. He moved with such fluidity that Dean could have just watched him for hours. He was so clearly in his element and Dean could picture him in another kitchen. One in the back of a bakery full of the industrial equipment it would need. Dean needed that to happen.
“Good,” Cas said and he linked their arms together. “And one day, when we come back up here, it won’t be like today.”
Cas stared at him for a long moment. Dean heard Sam and Eileen returning, but he didn’t turn to see them because Cas gripped his hand tight.
Through the music blaring in his ears Dean heard a rough crunching noise. He pulled off his headphones and sat up with a start. He grabbed his gun from the table beside his bed and shot to his feet. He sped towards his door only to see that it had been ripped off its hinges.
It wasn’t as if Cas had never been kissed, it wasn’t as if people out there wouldn’t want to kiss him. Dean knew that Cas was attractive, objectively. It wasn’t hard to miss and he wasn’t blind. He may not be gay but he could still appreciate when someone was good looking. The point is that there were plenty of people out there who would want to kiss Cas. Why that was something Dean kept thinking he didn’t know.
before crouching down and rolling up the cuffs of Cas’s pants. Cas stared down at him. He fought a blush as he stood up and turned. He took the belt off of Castiel’s body, the one on the bed, and handed it to her.
“What the hell happened Cas?” Asked Dean. He was acting a bit odd, thought Castiel. He was fidgety and he kept glancing at her with an unplaceable expression then looking away awkwardly. “Where have you been for the past 2 weeks?”
“Can’t hurt. Besides what else is he doing.” Dean turned as the phone rang on the other end. He missed Sam’s exasperated eye roll.
“Hunters.” He spat, “You’re too late. I have already completed what my forefather set out to do. This town will never be brought low. It will never fail or falter; it will be held up as the pinnacle of virtue!”
Sam seemed to have accepted the new situation pretty fast which made Dean feel worse that he was being weird about it. At first he worried that he wasn’t being accepting enough, but that wasn’t it (which made him feel a bit better about himself). It was just that he was so used to seeing Cas a certain way, and it was like every time he turned a corner there he was – there she was – just being Cas. She
“I don’t know.” Dean whispered. His voice, which had been so loud a moment ago seemed to have withdrawn into him. He could hardly make a sound. He was standing in his room, gun in hand, unable to tear his eyes away from the angel he’d been trying so desperately to avoid. He never could avoid Cas though, could he? As much as he tried he always found himself back at Cas’s side. It was like Cas exerted a magnetic field and Dean was never really able to escape it, not that he tried. He took a tentative step forward. Castiel didn’t move, concern working its way into his eyes.
Sam didn’t want to believe that Castiel was gone either, but all the evidence said that there was no coming back this time. He had found a simple preservation spell for Castiel’s body, but it would only last so long before the effect wore off. They still didn’t really know what had happened. They just knew that Cas was gone.
Reluctantly Sam helped his brother carry the lifeless body of the angel into Cas’s room. They laid him on his bed. Dean sat down on the edge and didn’t move.
“I — I really needed you to know,” Dean said, after a long moment. He straightened his clothes and felt his wings right themselves too, but they leaned forward as if reaching for Cas. Missing his touch already.
The way that Cas lit up when he looked at Dean, then, made Dean realize all at once that he had known Cas for maybe an hour, but that he was already gone for him. He was infatuated. He had a big fat crush the likes of which Dean didn’t think he’d ever had before.
“Castiel told me that his father brought him back. Chuck brought him back from The Empty. And I played a part in it the last time that he — I just don’t know how.”
“If you don’t, opening day will be here and you’ll be so run down you won’t even enjoy it. You don’t have to do this alone. I’ll be here and I’ll get Sam to come help too and I’m sure if you ask Lisa she’ll help. And your cousin, what was his name? Gabriel. You bake enough for him that he owes you.”
“You befriended Lisa’s baker neighbor because you missed his pies and then somehow you’re fixing up things around this guy’s house and you’re taking him out to look at possible locations for a bakery this weekend.”
Dean couldn’t believe that at one point in his life he had been annoyed by how close Cas got to him. Now, he wanted Cas as close as possible. Always within his reach.
Cas was still moving around grabbing things left and right and Dean felt weird sitting there not doing anything. The whole thing just felt strange.
“When you helped get Cas back, you only woke him up,” Dean said. “Cas annoyed The Empty enough that it kicked Cas out. Chuck pulled him out. Didn’t disturb The Empty at all. Just made Cas alive again.”
His hand lingered on Cas’ cheek and Cas was staring at him unblinkingly first looking at Dean’s face and then past him.
Dean flew them back to the bunker after Jack filled them in on all the rest of his plans and then told Dean that he didn’t need his help to become human again. It would happen on it’s own in a few days — maybe a full week or two — so long as it was what Dean really wanted.
Things were different and yet the same. There were still things to hunt and people to help. The Impala was always ready to go and if there was one place where Dean felt happy it was driving his Baby with his music on and his brother at his side. But even then, when his eyes locked on the rearview mirror, there was an angel missing in his backseat and that never failed to make his chest ache.
Cas’ pulse was constant under Dean’s fingers. Cas looked down and Dean followed his gaze. Immediately he let go and he took a step back too because Cas’ wrist was angry red, the skin raised like a bad blistering burn. It calmed once Dean had let go and Dean watched as Cas examined his own wrist and as the mark disappeared entirely.
Dean pulled and in that moment a few things happened. The darkness around him intensified and there was noise, a ringing that meant his time was up.
Dean didn’t say anything. He didn’t know what he should or could say. Jack was no longer the kid that had trailed after them and that Dean hadn’t been very fair to. He was more powerful than ever and still he hadn’t managed to do the one single thing that Dean wanted more than anything. The thing he would give anything to get.
Dean pulled harder and his elbows were out, covered in black goo but out and Cas was still in his grasp.
His ribs had been bruised up from the last case he and Sam had gone on and a knife had slashed into the meat of his thigh. He’d burned his hand cooking breakfast that morning and there had been a big bruise on his left forearm. All of that was gone. Somehow, it just made the Castiel shaped hole in his heart that much sharper.
Eileen appeared behind Sam. She had taken the time to dress and she stopped just next to Sam. Her soul was just as nice as Sam’s and when they stood next to each other they seemed to get brighter. It made Dean wonder about his own soul in relation to the angel whose face he still tenderly held.
She would deny it later, Dean was sure, but her eyes teared up when she saw Cas right before she launched at him and pummeled his chest twice before Dean grabbed her around the waist and pulled her away.
“Lisa’s nice,” Dean said. “And it was nice to be with her but there was something missing. We’re better as friends. I think we were both just lonely.”
“Wait, you’re gay,” Dean said and his eyes widened because that was not at all the point of what Cas had been saying. Not to mention that there was some other emotional undercurrent there.
So, a week after meeting Castiel for the first time, Dean was once more back at his house, but this time instead of getting out of the car and knocking on his door, it was Cas that gave his car a gentle rap. Dean unlocked the door at once and Cas got in.
“I said yes because it was the only way to save him,” Dean said. “And not gonna lie, Jack, I feel great. And these wings are something else, but it isn’t me. Being human is more. Can you change me back?”
Cas beckoned him down the stairs. A couple of the wooden planks were wobbly when he stepped on them. Nothing adding a nail or switching out the plank wouldn’t fix.
Not that Dean had really minded. Bones had come with Dean out to the spot a few times. For all that Dean had complained when they first took the dog in, he’d become a companion for a time.
Dean hugged him back at once, his arms wrapping around Cas to rest at his back and he never wanted to let go. Castiel had an earthy smell to him, but something flowery too in his hair. He felt amazing in Dean’s arms and they stayed that way in that hug for longer than was socially normal.
In many ways, it was nice to hear that. It was nice to have someone else confirm what Dean already knew. And a part of him had to wonder what might have happened if he or Lisa met someone else back when they were together. What if Dean had actually met Castiel? Because he couldn’t deny his attraction. Or that he wanted to know more about Cas. He wanted to know everything about him.
The smile had grown. “I know that you’re only saying that because you want access to my pie all the time, but thank you.”
Dean was at fault there too. For one thing, he’d denied it for so long even to himself to the point that Dean hadn’t known — allowed himself to know — until it was too late. And by the time that Dean had realized why it was that Cas affected him so much and why he had nearly drowned himself in anger and alcohol after the night of Jack’s birth. And Cas for all his talk about profound bonds was an angel and as human as he could be at times, Dean had never expected Cas to feel anything for him in that way.
“I am busy,” Jack said. “And I can’t spare any angels. There are too few and those that are left...they do not see Castiel as we do.”
Cas brought the pie out and set it atop a cutting board. It smelled divine, the warm apple and cinnamon scent filling up the kitchen even more now that the pie was actually out of the oven. Dean’s mouth watered.
“Oh,” Cas said and his smile was so bright when he looked at Dean again. “You’re my best friend too.”
On a Saturday, when Dean hadn’t gotten a response from Cas about getting breakfast, Dean drove straight to Angel Bakes. He found Castiel there at the back entrance where he seemed to be in the middle of carrying a heavy looking box inside. Dean rushed and grabbed the other end of the box to lighten the load.
Cas’ eyes fluttered a few times and then they were back on Dean’s, just as piercing as ever. A blue that was all Cas and that Dean had thought he was never going to see again. And yet there it was.
Dean watched him. Jack ran agitated hands through his hair. His eyes flitted this way and that before they were on Dean again.
Dean found a stool at the island and he watched as Cas moved around throwing even more things into the sink.
When a whole three months had gone by of Dean not praying to Jack every night, Jack finally showed up.
They stood side by side and looked at the sign and Dean couldn’t help the feeling of pride that filled him because he had known Cas for a few months and yet even from the first night, it had been easy to tell that Castiel didn’t feel confident enough to go for it. But a few nudges had been enough to make him decide that yes, he could do it.
“I, um, I had a plan. It was a long time ago, but we had been looking at places to rent. My, um, my boyfriend at the time, he and I were going to do it together. And things were falling into place except that then...well, things happen.”
They filled in Sam and Eileen. There were questions and Dean could tell when Sam was holding back anger or when he was filled with sorrow that was aimed at Dean and at everything that he’d gone through the last few months.
“What?” Cas asked. He was watching Dean make dinner from the table, but he got up to stand next to Dean.
“I can’t go and the remaining angels can’t go, Dean. But you can. You can bring him back. Just not while you’re human.”
“Oh,” Cas said and his hand reached outwards and one of Dean’s wings moved towards Cas’ reach without Dean realizing it.
Dean was considering the alternative. If he went back to being a human and he left the life. Perhaps not fully, but he might take it slower and be a resource more than someone out there putting his life on the line and doing the work. He could man those agency phones like Bobby had done. There were so many hunters out there. Younger men and women that could take on the mantle. Dean had no idea how Sam felt about it, but Dean could admit that he was tired. Of course, he’d tried the normal life once with Lisa and Ben and it had failed spectacularly. But it had worked in some ways and Dean had cared about Lisa and Ben both. It just hadn’t been enough for him.
It was just touchy and vague enough that polite midwestern folks didn’t directly ask about the scandalous and homosexual details in their cover story.
“Reservations at 7,” he said automatically, mostly to defend himself from accusations that he was so old he ate dinner before 5:00 pm.
Kindly not pointing out that it was Dean’s inheritance of fighting the supernatural was far more unusual, even though that’s exactly what both them were thinking, Cas said, “We are.”
Dean’s malingering paid off because it meant he and Cas could take a shower together. It meant they got to undress together, which was always fun.
Dean never learned to accept Cas’s extremely casual nudism with any kind of equal casualness, and something about his birthday made him way too eager to touch, so Dean leaned over just to pet the smooth and freshly moisturized angle of Cas’s jawline. Against his intentions, Dean’s hands slid down Cas’s neck and chest, over scars and enochian sigils that developed after Cas’s humanity, and stopped roughly at Cas’s hips. Dean’s thumbs traced the ridges of his hip bones. Really, Dean wasn’t trying to make it sexual. Without anyone around, without anything to preoccupy their time but being together, he just couldn’t resist being this close.
“Yeah, be fair,” RJ said to Luís. “He’s got the big five-oh steakhouse dinner date tonight. He’s got to get moving if they want to be home in time for Jeopardy.”
Dean straightened his belt and ran a hand over the gift box in his pocket. “Oh, I’ve actually been ready for a while.”
Of course he got another text in reply, because his life was filled with spiteful, contrary bastards who all thought they were funny. It was just another eggplant emoji, but she did that thing Dean didn’t know how to do where it exploded like little word bubbles all over the screen when he looked at it. Then she sent another text that read,
It was advice, barely generalized, for the group in front of him, but clearly referencing something specific in Cas’s mind. Didn’t couldn’t really guess the particular thing from the past plaguing Cas-- they’d had more than their fair share of moments hurting each other because of their fears, trying to judge what was best without
Dean easily pressed the soul of his good leg’s foot on Cas’s chest. “Wow, babe, I get this kind of vibe you’re not just doing this for my health.”
warning for sexual stuff i guess. not graphic and not all that sexual really. just sensual touching.
Cas looked over, not surprised by Dean’s appearance, but not welcoming him into the demonstration either. Dean was still persona non grata in any situation where he could get tripped. But he took full advantage of enjoying the view. Cas’s eyes were dark with purpose but a light red flush turned up on his cheekbones. He gave Dean a ‘I’ll wrap this up in a minute’ look. Other than that, he continued to ignore Dean.
Cas hefted this leg with less gentless above his shoulder. He kissed the inside of Dean’s ankle up to his calf up to his knee. Then there he was, kneeling on the bed, looming into his space suddenly with a determined hungry look. With his leg draped over Cas’s shoulder, Dean flexed a little to pull him in closer. Cas’s hand snaked unto the leg of his jockies and curled ponderously around Dean’s dick, and then his sack. It was more like the slow massaging he’d been doing, than actively jacking him off, though his dick was definitely starting to twitch in interest.
Dean checked the time again. It was only 2:16 but he decided he might as well call it a day. His mind had not been on the job all day. All he really managed to do was disassemble and clean the existing parts of the engine he was keeping.  Between the donuts Mimi and Jake brought in for his birthday, standing around the coffee pot shooting the shit, getting hassled for turning fifty, getting hassled for busting his knee right before turning fifty, and thinking about date night tonight, there hadn’t been much time for the Cadillac he was working on.
Dean could see the exact image of Sam’s prissy bitchface he was undoubtedly making in hi-def clarity as if Sam were right in the garage with him. Of course he could; Dean had only seen it every day of his life.
Dean paused for a second because now she wasn’t teasing anymore. And yeah, he was here working a normal job with normal people, mostly passing as a normal person himself, but so much of his life was still redacted and he never expected this to be a thing he couldn’t explain. The things he maybe could talk about-- growing up absolutely terrified of people knowing him as queer, never thinking he’d be alive long enough to actually get married-- he didn’t want to.
Dean cleared his throat, and wrapped his knuckles on the desk as he walked away. “See you later, ladies. I’ve got a date with my boyfriend.”
Dean slid his phone back in his pocket, but there was a hesitation before the next buzz where he could almost feel the incoming nagging reverberating through the cell signal. He was just going to ignore it. That resolve only lasted about four seconds though, and he checked his phone again.
He’d found himself standing for conversations he didn’t need to, carrying things he could have put on a cart, picking up his pace when he should have just slowed down, most of the time he’d been in. And then pretending that spending most of his time after lunch on his wheeled creeper chair was just a coincidence.
Dean took a deep breath, breaking the kiss, and just taking a second in the quiet to just feel Cas, to hold him because he had him there. He brushed against the side of Cas’ face, nose breathing into his hairline. In turn, Cas let his forehead rest on Dean’s jaw, and he kissed at the crook of Dean’s neck. Cas smelled like sweat and BO and faintly like potting soil. The fact that this made Dean
Cas gave Dean a withering glare. And then with a speed and economy of moment Dean knew these kids would not have expected, Cas disarmed Alaina and dropped low to sweep her legs from underneath her. It was quick and violent enough that the other two froze in a moment of debating whether to move away from Cas’s threat range or back up their friend, unsure where their leisurely lesson was going.
Dean frowned. “Mimi isn't the--” Well she was the boss of him, technically speaking. It'd been almost 7 years but Dean still wasn't used to being, you know, legally employed. “She's not my mom. There's no honor and being a narc, RJ.”
Despite knowing the drill from Claire, that the two older men were basically Claire’s dads and the bunker was a training center where Dean and Cas were a team, the girl preened a little at the compliment.
Dean stuck around until Cas was ready to usher the kids out of the bunker. Cas seemed eager to wrap up with them, but refused all assistance from Dean, and kept telling him to sit down somewhere. Dean stubbornly remained, mostly leaning against the practice room wall, and listed creative ways garot a vampire with helpful demonstrations and helped pack a case of holy water for them when they left anyway. He tacked on as many pitiful words of wisdom he could think of, hoping anything or everything would help them hold it together.
He couldn’t tell her how an expensive day in a banquet hall wasn’t more commitment than he had now. He couldn’t relate that he found out about his real capacity for commitment when he was grieving Cas’s death. He couldn’t say that marriage would never compare to knowing Cas had already given up everything for him, felt happiness and love for him when those things weren’t supposed to have been possible. Dean couldn’t even tell her the shitty paranormal romance books she read
If Cas caught that he used the wrong verb for people who were always human, Dean couldn't tell. Didn’t really matter. It applied either way.
“Excuse me, it’s my birthday. I’m just about done with people younger than me bullying me on my birthday.”
Everyone else at the garage knew Dean Winchester was cagey about his past, his family, but they all thought it was because he was a recovering alcoholic. It was Dean’s background reason for not having a super detailed employment history he could admit to. And hey, not a total lie. They knew Cas as a somewhat reclusive researcher and translator of ancient texts, which was uninteresting enough that people didn’t ask much about it, and sometimes a thing Cas was actually paid to do by other hunters and academic weirdos. They knew the only family Dean and Cas had were Dean’s brother and two adult children that were now living out of state. Jack and Claire were implied to be from Cas’s life before Dean.
knowing what the other was thinking. All of them Dean had already forgiven years ago, but he knew extremely well it was hardest to forgive yourself. Dean’s hand twitched, and even his knee felt weak with forward give like he could barely contain not reaching out for Cas in that moment.
Really, Dean would have left at lunch if he hadn’t felt a twinge of guilt for shirking his responsibilities. It was his first week back after his time off from his knee surgery and he hadn’t gotten much done all week. But he’d spent most of the day debating himself on how early was too early to leave. He figured after 2:00 was safe. Not too early. Not overcompensating by working a full shift. Like really, who could expect that of him?
To their credit, the kids could tell there was some kind of meaningful doublespeak going on, but without knowing what they could only look around awkwardly.
Cas just ignored him and picked up Dean’s thighs with a push. Dean took the hint and was happy to shuffle himself up the bed a little more. Cas pulled open the velcro strip to take off Dean’s lumbar belt, which he was less happy about. Dean didn’t like wearing it, but he needed to-- nearly 40 years of digging, fighting, hauling, and all the other shit a hunter had to do hadn’t been kind to his knees or his back. The decades of beers and burgers had also built up, and since his hunting life had slowed way down, Dean’s spare tire had, uh, expanded a bit. When Cas let loose the tension in his belt, Dean didn’t feel totally unlike William Shatner being let out of his girdle.
And obviously, Dean didn’t think there was anything wrong with that, that’s why he did it every year. He had reasons for liking the sedate, normal routine he’d never really had in his life before semi-retiring from hunting.
Cas, always oblivious to his own nudity, didn’t hesitate to go nursemaid and check Dean’s motility the same as he’d been doing for the last few weeks, but with his cock and balls totally exposed like that didn’t matter. He wrapped a warm hand around Dean’s calf and massaged down to his ankle, gentle and slow. He held on until Dean extended his leg as much as he could, then guided the heel of Dean's foot up to the vicinity of Cas’s shoulder.
Cas leaned against Dean a little more, tipping his head back. Dean couldn’t help kissing that little exposed dip in his clavicle. “A reservation at Hanneman’s isn’t exactly the hardest to procure.”
Dean thought maybe the skinny girl with brown hair, Tara, maybe?, was thinking the same thing he was, the way she scanned over Cas’ forearms, baby blues, and thighs as he worked her friend over. He couldn’t really blame her and he kept nagging Cas not to wear those damn pants in mixed company. It was just indecent. Dean winked at her and she blushed.
Elisa looked up to “aww” at him and then unrepentantly returned to scrolling some incomprehensible social media app on her phone.
That was pretty much true and basically why Dean’s bad achy knee had evolved into a bad torn meniscus surgery in the first place, but it still felt insulting.
Which is why when RJ looked at Dean with genuine concern, actually holstering his airbrush pen on the cart next to him, and said, “Whoa, bruh, you okay?” Dean nearly collapsed under the weight of mortification.
He palmed the box as best he could, in case Cas walked in early, and he walked into the closet to pull on his knee brace and rapid-change into his date clothes. He put on his nice jeans since Hanneman’s was nice, but not, like,
Suppressing the immediate urge to rush in, Dean leaned hard against the doorway and just thought about why he continued to love someone so determined to give him a coronary.
Dean wanted Cas for the rest of time, in this life and the next. And Dean didn’t have the language for that.
, would be a little jealous now at the stability he had. Shitty twenty-five-year-old Dean probably would also be killed stone dead to see himself settled down, working a civilian job more often than hunting, and married to a man. And then would probably pop right back out of the grave just to call him lame for betraying his freedom and manliness in such a godawful boring way.
“Beatrice Green? Are you listening?” No response. Cas continued undaunted, “I heard about your husband George. He sounds like a wonderful man. I must say his second wife was a far better choice for him than you ever were. She was much more beautiful from what I’ve seen. She probably made him so happy once you were gone.”
“I am sorry that you though I was dead. I do not know what the witch did to me, but I promise that I am who I say I am. I’ll admit that I thought you might recognize me despite my current vessel, given all we have been through together. I do not know how to prove my identity to you. I could say that I know your father trained you to be hunters after the death of your mother. I could say that I know you have lived on the road your whole lives. I could say that I know you have both gone to the ends of the earth and the depths of hell for each other and would gladly do it again. I could say all of this and yet I feel now that you still might not believe me. I am not sure how to make you certain that it is me, but I am Castiel” She looked Dean in the eyes, arms hanging at her sides, resigned to her fate. Her stare seemed to pierce through him. He had only ever had one person look at him like that.
Dean went back into Cas’s room. Sam was sitting by Cas’s body, but Cas herself was nowhere to be seen (yeah, that was weird).
“I cannot ask that of you. I promised myself that I would not ruin another life by stealing it away.” Castiel spoke roughly, but not unkindly. The woman didn’t know what she was agreeing to.
. His Cas. Bright blue eyes and tousled dark hair; his strong hands resting on the wheel. Dean shook himself out of it.
“I am not entirely sure. After I was ejected from my vessel I must have been drifting in my angelic form for a while, longer than I had originally thought. I was not aware it had been so long. I’m sorry for the delay. My powers are not what they should be and it took me longer to get here than I intended.” Castiel tilted her head slightly, “What happened with you two after Thirza attacked me?”
Their lips met, close-lipped and calm. To Dean’s surprise it was Cas who deepened the kiss, pulling Dean into his arms and holding him like he was the only thing in the world. Dean dropped the gun he hadn’t realized he was still holding. He brought his hands up, tangling them in Cas’s hair. Oh god, he didn’t know how much he’d been dying to do that. And then it was Cas who was kissing Dean, and Dean just let it happen.
“Hello darlings,” Rowena said with a wide smile. She seemed far too happy with the situation for Dean’s liking.
There was Dean, unconscious and bound with a noose wrapped around his neck. He was crumpled on the floor under a beam as if Beatrice had just been about to string him up when she erupted into flames. Castiel barely registered the broken bodies hanging all around the basement as she shot towards Dean. She knelt beside him and saw, with relief, the soft rise and fall of his chest as he breathed shallowly. She pulled the rope over his head and lifted him into her arms.
Without thinking Dean closed the distance between them. Cas’s hand was still on his face and he pulled himself closer to her, placing a hand on the back of her neck. He tipped his head down and pressed his lips to hers.
“Hello Dean.” Cas said with a small smile. Dean pulled his hand off her arm quickly and felt his face heating up. He covered it by turning and pulling his jeans on from where they lay in a heap on the floor. He got dressed and went downstairs without looking back at Castiel.
“We might have a slight problem.” They had gotten out of the car at that point and Castiel had stuck the keys back in Dean’s coat pocket (which Dean had made a point of
“Yes Dean,” Cas replied, already done with Dean’s odd behavior at this point. “This is a couple’s retreat. It makes sense that there is only one bed.” She pushed past Dean and set her bag on a table and pulled out her (Sam’s extra) laptop. When Dean didn’t move from the doorway she looked up at him expectantly.
“Cut the crap lady! Answer the damn question. Who the hell are you?!” Dean growled. He seemed to have gone from shock to earthshattering rage in a matter of seconds. “Because I know for damn sure that who and whatever you are, it ain’t Cas. Castiel is dead and if you so much as utter his name again I will blow your brains out without a second thought!”
“Thank you Dean.” Said Castiel, putting the belt on. She pulled it as tight as it would go and the jeans bunched up a ludicrous amount. “This will suffice for now.”
You Dean Winchester are the single most infuriating human being I have ever met! Thanks to your reckless actions you almost died and I barely, just barely, managed to destroy the apparition that had her hands wrapped around your lungs! I had to tear apart the building to find you, hardly breathing, with a
It still hurt seeing Cas like that, lifeless and laid out a table. He knew that Cas was alive, right there with them, but it was painful nonetheless. Dean reached out instinctively, just enough that he would be able to brush his arm against Castiel’s, just to ensure she was still there. His arm hit air. After a brief moment of irrational panic he realized that she was still standing beside him, just that she was standing as if to put space between them. If Sam noticed he didn’t say anything.
“Not much really,” Began Sam, “We delt with the witch and the guy who summoned her. Then we brought your body back here. We’ve been trying to find a way to bring you back, but in all honesty man, we thought you were gone for good.” He looked guilty about it. Dean was still staring at Cas with that odd expression.
“Wow dude, harsh.” Dean let out a low whistle and Cas gave him a devilish smile. You’d think as an angel she wouldn’t be so good at that, but Dean knew better. Angels could be nasty sons-of-bitches when they wanted to be.
Dean screamed. Beatrice had sunk her outstretched arms elbow deep into Dean’s chest. Castiel slid sideways and pointed the shotgun at the ghost and pulled the trigger. It was too late. She had disappeared, taking Dean with her.
The door to the bunker opened. Sam and Dean were on their feet instantly, guns in hand. Dean shot Sam a questioning look and Sam shook his head; they weren’t expecting anyone. The only people who knew where the bunker was would know better than to barge in without calling ahead. That left one option: enemy, and a powerful one at that. To be able to break the bunker’s wards and just force its way in like that was no small feat.
