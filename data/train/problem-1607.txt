Over the past few weeks, Sherlock received a lot of love notes from his secret admirer. Some of them were adorable and some made him downright blush. He was also becoming closer to John, who seemed to be making a lot more conscious efforts to include Sherlock into his group of friends.
Sherlock smirked as he bent down to do exactly that. His lips captured John’s as he trapped him in a slow, filthy kiss. John’s mouth was still slightly open after talking and Sherlock took advantage by sliding his tongue along John’s bottom lip, nipping it to elicit a glorious sound from John.
Instead of laughing at Sherlock, which most of the rugby players tend to do, John had bent down next to Sherlock and helped him up. He even checked Sherlock for any injuries and apologised. So one could say that, yes, Sherlock was a little twitterpated by the blond, handsome (and definitely experienced) boy.
Mycroft closed his eyes and sighed, “You know, your comforting tactic may have worked a lot better if my dear Brother hadn’t left that child here.”
“I can fight my own battles, Watson.” Sherlock snarled, feeling humiliated that he was so weak. He gathered his books quickly and tried not to look at John, trying to will himself to look upset.
Basically, Mycroft is hurt by his bosses and Lestrade has to put away Rosie to...comfort his pouty Boyfriend. Smut. Duh. I also apologise for posting this cause Mycroft and Lestrade are really out of character in this one.
“What is it, Myc? You got to say it.” Greg answered, a little breathlessly as he used a finger to trace the outline of Mycroft’s erection, fingers still clenched around the silk tie.
Sherlock gulped audibly as he typed out his response. (And retyped, over and over again.) Eventually, he was able to conjure up a word.
Sherlock was pretty much asexual. (Or so John thought) The man said he was married to his work and that (to John) screamed asexual. Curse Sherlock and his vague explanation of his sexuality. Curse him and his “women aren’t my area” bullshit. Stupid Sherlock and his pretty hair. Idiot Sherlock with his pretty eyes and nose and all the other equally attractive body parts. Stupid.
John slid his phone back into his pocket and nodded slowly, narrowing his eyes at Sherlock suspiciously. He really wasn’t looking forward to another surprise trip to the morgue, the blood and organs really just ruined his appetite and it was so close to dinner.
The room was silent and then Sherlock’s head tilted downwards so that John’s hand was right next to his cheek. Closing his eyes, he started to nuzzle into John’s hand in some sort of fever induced haze.
(Yet, somewhere in the back of his mind, John was thinking about how perfect this would be if it was an actual date. BUT IT WAS VERY FAR BACK IN HIS MIND. Sherlock’s well-being came first.)
Back in apartment 221b Baker Street, Sherlock and John were sporting matching earpieces. They were sitting in their respective armchairs, both having very similar expressions on their faces. It was a “delicate” mix of worry, concern and skepticism.
John smiled at Sherlock, whose eyes were fixated on how perfectly their hands fit together. The taller was shocked into silence and he was just smiling fondly at their hands.
As Sherlock typed, he let a slow smile spread on his face as he conversed with Watson. They continued to chat till the evening, arguing about the wonderful picture John had posted of himself.
“An...admirer...” Sherlock mumbled, not believing his luck. Who could ever be his admirer? Everyone in this school (save for Irene) found him detestable. And he hated everyone back with a passion.
“Shhhh, Petal, shhhh. It’s going to be alright. Calm down. Remember to breathe a little. Don’t be so mad.” Asher soothed, pausing occasionally to give John and Sherlock apologetic looks.
Lestrade imagines what they must me seeing and cringes internally. Mycroft is lying on his side all fucked out and very naked with Lestrade behind him, his face is no doubt sporting a “I just got laid” look. Mycroft also seems to be drifting off due to sheer tiredness, flushed and breathless.
“Fa-da! Fa-da! Da-dee!” She squealed joyfully, unaware that Sherlock was taken aback by being addressed as ‘fa-da!’
John didn’t mean to stare at Sherlock’s body. John tried really hard not to look at Sherlock’s amazing body. But he couldn’t help it. It was like putting a slab of meat in front of a starving lion and telling him to wait. John blushed as his eyes ravaged Sherlock’s body, gazing hungrily at his exposed neck, wanting nothing more than to place a hickey-
He didn’t tell John the most haunting thought in his mind though. The thought that made him a little excited and afraid at the same time. The thought that Sherlock was slowly but surely falling away from John.
Harry stared into John’s eyes in mock seriousness and pointed an accusing finger at his face. “What more do you want? He’s hot, he’s smart and he’s availableeeee. God, if I wasn’t married I would turn straight for him alone.”
“I will get a candle, it’s more romantic...” Angelo announced before scuttling off to find a pretty little candle. This time, John didn’t say anything, he just smiled and let his eyes wander over to Sherlock.
They slaved away at the letter during lunch, with Sherlock doing almost nothing and John slaving away on the paper. Sherlock didn’t even glance at the paper, he just provided a “hmm, yes.” whenever it was required.
Causing mild states of chaos which he could monitor had always been his forte. Also, it was funny to sometimes see John backed into a corner.
Option a) He could fly to Paris, cut off all ties from London and continue his education in the city of love.
Sherlock couldn’t fight the oncoming blushes that came with each message if he tried. It was all too lovely, too endearing. He wanted to find out who it was. But he knew that if he found out, he would ruin it. The notes would stop.
Mycroft was not in the best mood. The higher ups in his place of work had recommended that he should have a break. Upon finding out that it was because China’s secret service refused to work with a homosexual, Mycroft was, quite understandably, upset and did not  take the news very well.
Somehow he made eye contact with John, holding the blond’s stare for a full thirty seconds. John’s lips were curled into a half smile, hesitant and cheeky.
“I’d so love to kiss you right now.” Mycroft announced as he hooked his leg teasingly over  Greg’s calf, “But I have so much work to do.”
When John told Sherlock to dress well, he didn’t expect him to pull out his purple shirt. The sexy, fitted purple shirt that accentuated all the good things about Sherlock’s body. To make matters worse, Sherlock had paired the shirt with a lovely black pants that was tight... in all the right places.
Greg turned to his side to look at the little girl who was fidgeting away merrily. She was counting off her fingers as she kicked her little feet around, giggling through her words as she babbled incoherently.
Mycroft groaned as Greg kissed him, mouth falling open, allowing Greg’s tongue to sneak in. Each touch was leaving a burning sensation on his skin. Noises left his mouth, high and needy, wanting something more.
Greg nodded understandingly as he set Rosie next to him so that he could properly pay attention to Mycroft. He had spent enough time around the man to know when he needed time alone and when he needed to confide in someone. Today, he sensed that Mycroft was decidedly needing the latter.
John shook his head and came to his cornered husband’s defence, “Your Father is one of the best judges of character I know. Why don’t you just trust him?”
Sherlock leaned back in his chair, not knowing whether to feel flattered or harassed. Meanwhile, Harry looked on at her stuttering Brother, infinitely amused.
“I...erm...couldn’t quite...tell you.” Mycroft finished lamely, trying to look away from Greg’s passionate gaze. He tried to grab the paper and get out of his seat but Greg held him down by his waist instead.
Sherlock’s eyes drifted shut as John pulled him closer to capture his lips in his own. A little sound escaped from his mouth as John twined his fingers into his curly locks. Everything was so warm and so good and Sherlock didn’t know if he could stop. He felt shaky, like a tiny lamb, yet the comforting feel of John’s hand on his jaw kept him grounded.
“ACCEPTABLE!” Sherlock pronounced, standing up quickly. John gaped at Sherlock from his seated position, not trusting himself to speak lest a string of very unpleasant words tumble out.
“No...i...it’s the small things...that I love about...ah! Oh god, Greg please!” Mycroft but his lip as Greg let his tongue run over his nipple, nipping it slightly.
Pointing to the star on his forehead, John explained, “Coach wanted a reward system. The boys got out of hand with it... They apparently can’t be trusted with stickers.”
Lestrade smiled, “Pretty thing, you’ll always receive when you ask nicely. Take your pants off.” With that, both of them were rid of all attire, Mycroft draped compromisingly over the couch, legs spread apart as he waited for Lestrade’s next command.
As Rosie set the table and sat down on the couch, a very awkward silence ensued, with both parents scrutinising Asher and the two teens squirming around uncomfortably.
“When I fell ill, you fell asleep tending to me. Your saliva also has a very distinct smell which left a residue on my forehead. This was why I looked slightly confused when I woke up as there were traces of your saliva on my skin. You must have kissed me.” Sherlock stated, all the while chewing merrily at his sandwich. (Who orders a sandwich at an Italian restaurant?!)
“Of course not, John.” Sherlock levelled his cool gaze with John’s very naughty eyes. He smiled at his knowingly before asking innocently, “Does the army have this kind of view?”
5. His eyes, which I always, no matter how, will forget the colour of. It makes me want to hold him close to my face so that I can remember it forever.
John’s hand snaked around Sherlock’s waist and pulled him in, the hand holding Sherlock’s snaking upwards to his face. He gently caressed Sherlock’s jaw with his thumb, marvelling at the swirling greens and blues in his eyes before finally getting lost in them.
“Be gentle, Mycroft, she’s just a child. Why don’t you just be a little patient, I know just what might cheer you up. Let me just put her in her crib, so that we may not be disturbed.” With that, Greg winked at Mycroft, causing the latter to blush a rather dark shade of crimson.
So he told John. He told John, the literal love of his life about how he might be falling for someone else, someone whom he doesn’t even know the name of. He told John about how wonderful the person sounded and how he wished to get to know him, even if his personality might drive him away.
“Oh, I’ll help you Johnny boy. I have questions.” Harry winked at Sherlock, who managed to look incredibly adorable and mildly disgusted by it.
John seethed silently as he watched Rosie beam at Sherlock before giving him a very lovely hug. As she left with Asher, Sherlock grinned and locked the door closed.
“Not gay...you said...” Harry teased, waggling her eyebrows at Sherlock, whose cheeks are now tinged the most delicate of pinks.
John gulped as Sherlock smiled (genuinely?!) at Harry, messing up his curly locks. “Hello, Miss. I’m Sherlock Holmes, John’s flatmate.”
“Sir, Mr Lestrade is here. He says it’s not urgent but would like to see you if possible.” The woman spoke, eyes permanently fixed on the screen in her hand. (Honestly, the fact that she can communicate while being so engrossed was what made her such an excellent personal assistant)
It was days like this that John loved the most. It was quiet and he was snuggled into his armchair, sipping his chamomile tea while reading a darn good book. A romance novel, since he was so sick of Detective stories.
Anyway, I'm so surprised about the amount of people reading my other works. Since this is an ongoing fic, I'll talk about it here. I can't help but ask myself every time a lovely message or kudo flashes across my email why you all like my older work so much? It's
John has never seen anything as sexy as the man currently grinding his hip into the blogger’s thigh. After a moment of brief hesitation, John undulates his hips in time with the music; it becomes evident that the mutual stimulation burns a slow build of arousal through the thredmates’ veins. When the song ends both men are panting and each need a moment to adjust themselves.
Sherlock can feel something in his chest constrict and tighten as the anguish once again washes over him. The weight of the past few days causes him to crumble to the cold alley floor. When the initial shock of the moment passed, a lingering, hollow feeling envelopes the detective. The ebony haired man gasps for air as he stumbles blindly to his feet and his legs carry him to the darkest part of the alleyway. He somehow manages to type in a number he had never truly forgotten, and with shaking, stumbling fingers, he manages to type out a brief message and hits send.
The doctor does not know how long he stands there, but the happy buzz from before has long since diminished into panic, disbelief, and a wild hope that threatens to send him to his knees.
Sherlock's features have shut down completely. His shoulders are slightly slumped over and his frame sagging. His face is devoid of all emotion or feeling as each word is said. He doesn't say anything and lets them continue on with their bullying.
' With an answering nod, the dark headed sleuth is gone, leaving John on the sidewalk with a intoxicated Harry bemoaning about her woes.
After the two men were officially married, the four men make their way to Angelo’s for the Reception Party. Once there, Sherlock and John link hands and walk through the door to greet their friends and family. To the newly wedded couple, the applause that greeted them was near deafening. Matching grins appear across two faces as they look at each other with unmasked adoration and love.
"Sherlock! Love, wake up!" The snoozing consulting detective instantly stills and the arms around John's waist disappear. When the good doctor can finally turn around, Sherlock has sat up, a faint blush has spread across his high cheekbones, and he refuses to look at John. "I-I'm sorry John. I shouldn't have done that." The embarrassed detective slowly makes his way up and then turns to leave until John reaches an arm out and drags him back into bed.
Warnings: self-harm, mentions of suicide attempt, mentions of drug use, Johnlock, but not heavy Johnlock (it's established, but affection only really comes into play at the very end of the entire fan fiction), Unbeta'd, I wrote this because I really wanted to write some deep angst, and I'm not British
On blood loss, I do know that it is possible to become unconscious. That's pretty much the extent of my knowledge. I tried to stay away from medical stuff. I am an artist. I draw. I do not understand medical things.
Sherlock surprises John though, by taking over the kiss. He finds himself pushed up against the nearest wall with a lanky detective pressed up against him. The kiss, which started slow and chaste, has now transformed into a hot, and passionate one conveying need and lust. When they break apart for air this time, Sherlock doesn't go far. They are only inches apart, foreheads pressed together, sharing air and small smiles."John, I want to know...I mean, would you want to...that is…come to bed with me?" Sherlock finishes his rambling with a dark red blush and averted eyes.
Mycroft nods his head, “Of course, brother mine. Do not hesitate to call, and please call Mummy. You know how she worries.” Mycroft walks toward the doorway and lingers there for a moment before quietly saying, “Also…your loss would break my heart. Please, do try to take care of yourself.” With that, the British Government leaves the room.
Later that night, after much cuddling and sweet kisses, a knock and mumbled conversation drifts up the stairs to 221B. Two sets of feet casually walk up the steps and behind the door, there’s a brief pause and a whispered argument until Sherlock audibly groans in annoyance and utters a petulant: “Mycroft.” The annoyed sleuth gets up from his cozy position beside John, takes several large steps, and throws open the front door. He takes one look at his older brother and Gregory and
When John finally stops laughing, they stare at each not knowing what to do or what to say to the other. A shouted, “Papa,” causes both men to jump in alarm, but it does cause some of the tension to dissipate as little Rosie runs to John in demands to be picked up. He hoists his little one in the air and she giggles as John brings her back down to cuddle her against his broad chest.
John only smiles at his threadmate and gently takes a larger hand in his own to bring up their joined hands to place loving kisses against the amateur detective’s pale digits. The blogger looks at him evenly, smiles, and says, “Could be dangerous. Tell me about the scene.” The amateur detective takes a moment to thank a deity he doesn’t believe in that he has met and fallen in love with John Watson. The ebony haired genius takes a deep breath as he begins to rattle off the details of the crime scene.
His short legs take him to the receptionist's desk where he quickly gets the information needed before getting in the elevator and pressing the designated button.
. Sherlock accepted the explanation easily enough. After all, he could see the logic behind their statements (Although he hated the way they spoke to him. As if he couldn’t understand them unless they spoke in this irritating high pitch coddling voice).
about it. Before turning to look at the other man, Sherlock tries desperately to hide the anguish that is, no doubt, etched into his angular features. However, judging by John’s expression, the usually unobservant man actually paid attention for once.
Sherlock had intended to ignore any pleas for conversation, but John sidesteps his attempts at indifference by striding over to the couch and standing above the disgruntled sleuth.
“What the hell is going on?!” He asks the detective as he packs away clothes while blatantly ignoring the blogger. Said blogger become irate and grabs his mate by the wrist, halting his movements. “Seriously, Sherlock. Why didn’t you say anything? What’s going on? Why do you have to leave?”
The grin from before returns to the bloggers face as he nods his acceptance. When they reach the dance floor, the ebony genius slots their legs together and grabs his soulmate’s hands and places them on his hips. Sherlock rhythmically rocks against his loving doctor along with the songs slow beat.
They stare at each other at a loss. What could they say to make this hurt any less? What can they do to stop this all-encompassing sense of grief they both feel? Eventually, Clara slowly collects her things and makes for the exit. Before she can completely leave the small, sterile hospital room, she hears a quiet, “Please, take care of yourself, Clara.” Without turning around, she quietly replies, “You too, John,” as she departs.
' Sherlock then takes out his pocket magnifier glass to scrutinize her blouse in more detail, which he then finds a dark brown, curly strand of hair.
John rushes to Sherlock’s side, gun never leaving Mary’s still body until he can kick her gun away and lands hard on his knees next to the detective and begins to make sure that Sherlock is safe. The Consulting Detective smiles softly as one hand reaches up and cradles his blogger’s cheek. Eyes are stained with tears as each of the two men express their relief and happiness when they realize that it is over. John draws the other man closer and gently kisses the detective several times until lips travel upward to Sherlock’s temple and ebony curls to just breathe him in.
"Hey, Sherlock, you okay?" John says before he heads to the entrance of St. Barts. "Turn around and walk back the way you came now." Sherlock's frantic plea makes him pause momentarily before he redoubles his efforts, "No, I'm coming in."
When he got home, he would go into his bathroom and stare at his reflection. 'Why am I treated this way? Why do I deserve this?' He started hating himself, and one day, when
. If he were completely honest, he would admit that the last one hurt the most. It was just another reminder that he was different.
“When I asked you to marry me, John, I was terrified that you would say no. As you all know, I am a rude, obnoxious, and an all around arse that you could ever have the misfortune of meeting. The point I’m trying to make is that I know I am hard to live with. I am dismissive of the virtuous and uncomprehending in the face of the happy. So if I didn’t understand that this man could ever want someone like me, it is because I never expected to be anybody’s best friend, let alone anyone’s soulmate, and certainly not the threadmate of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing. John, I am a ridiculous man, redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship and love. But as I am apparently your best friend and your threadmate, I cannot congratulate you on your choice of a lifelong companion.
. You had denied our connection. I felt as though you agreed with what he said. Back in school, I was just the threadless freak. The threadless freak that was told that he wasn’t good enough for his mate. In that moment they were all right. I love you very deeply, John. I don’t want to lose you.”
The detective smiles at his blogger as he says, “I will always be yours. I have enjoyed today. I quite enjoy married life so far.” Sherlock leans forward and gently kisses his threadmate and when he withdrawals he whispers against his lips: “I love you.” John chuckles and plants another kiss against cupid bowed lips: “I love you too.”
When Sherlock was 15 he began cutting. He didn't intentionally do it the first time. The first time was in fact an accident. He was working on an experiment, on a cloudy Saturday morning, with a small kitchen knife that he was using to scrape the slime off of stones in the pond that was just outside of the Holmes' manor. He was just finishing with the last sample when the knife slips and knicks his wrist. He drops the stone and knife and races inside in order to stop the minor bleeding. Once he is clean, and back in his room looking at the samples he has collected, he realizes he can't concentrate on anything other than the adrenaline surging through his veins based upon one little cut. He pushes the thought away for future examination and goes back to work. Little did he know that this was not the last time he would feel the knife piercing his skin.
,” opened and all the memories from the last few days came flooding back to him. The man gasped at the sudden onslaught of emotions that seemed to rush forward all at once. John’s angry face as he viciously spat the word freak seemed to project off of every wall of his mind palace’s walls.
Verdigris eyes snap upward as those words were spoken. “We didn’t exactly talk about how either of us felt after you fell. We both left too much unspoken. I left my feelings buried inside and you weren’t exactly forthcoming with your own.  Sherlock, I know my actions have been telling you that’s all over….but, I don’t want to love somebody else.” The detective has a small smile painted across his face as he says, “I don’t want to love anyone else either.” John’s answering grin lights up his entire face. “Good.. That’s good. So, where do you want this to go? What do you want out of this?”
Also, I've gotten a review that kinda bummed me out. Do you all still like this story? Are you guys still there?
When they separate John slowly withdraws one button from Sherlock's tight shirt slowly, so as not to scare him off, and when seeing a slight nod from the cautious detective, proceeds on to the next. When the shirt has been completely unbuttoned and lay pooled on the floor, John places his hands on Sherlock's warm skin and leads him to the bed. He gently pushes Sherlock into a seated position and he takes off his own shirt to give Sherlock a semblance of equality. He begins to work on his trousers but Sherlock knocks his hands away and unbuttons the top button and pulls down the tab. When John stands before him in only his pants, Sherlock stands up and quickly removes his own trousers.
The D.I. turns to the British government and sighs, “You see? I told you that they wouldn’t agree.” Mycroft smirks, “Oh, I knew that they wouldn’t agree, however, Sherlock should know that Mummy would be very disappointed if she knew that he broke tradition. We both know that we can’t let Mummy down. Plus, “ here Mycroft grins haughtily, “you owe me, Sherlock. We don’t want John to--.”
"Sure, I wouldn't mind. Black, two sugars, please?" John stands and nods and the answering "Ta." sets him in motion toward the kitchen. Lestrade walks forward and sits down in Sherlock's old chair. Sherlock then pulls his dressing gown tighter around his exposed chest and Lestrade shifts in his seat awkwardly. The silence feels oppressive and deafening, so, when John finally does return, both detectives sigh in relief as John inquires about the last football match. Sherlock watches contentedly as the conversation carries on without him. He picks up the case file and takes one last look as his thread-mate, small smile painting across his angular features, before delving into a case about a 70 year old man murdered in a pet-shop.
“Sherlock, you are sick and you can’t go out!” John berated the pouty mess of a man lying on the couch.
Greg looked up at Mycroft and blushed, giving Mycroft a small smile as he replied, “Right again, Myc. Anyway, I was curious, is this where you say curiosity killed the cat my love?”
“Alright, I’m coming down!” Sherlock yelled back in response, finishing his violin session with a series of high pitched notes. He scrambled towards the door, adjusting the collar of his purple silk shirt as he did so.
After a quick call to Angelo and a scuffle for the bill (Sherlock won) and the pair were walking merrily back to 221b Baker Street, giggling and holding hands like a pair of blushing teenagers on their first date.
A very disgruntled Sherlock walked into the kitchen, carrying a wailing Rosie in his hands from a distance with a clear look of disgust on his face. “Thank goodness, please take her. She has excreted in her underwear and has not stopped screaming since.”
Sherlock grinned, bringing a hand up to his curls to massage his head. “That wasn’t too hard now, was it?”
Grabbing his cock in one hand, Lestrade slowly sunk the tip into Mycroft’s tight waiting heat. He sucked in a deep breath as he was met with the overwhelming sensation of Mycroft’s greedy hole clenching onto his cock.
“Hmm...let’s be gentle tonight. Since you’ve finally admitted to loving me.” Greg hummed as his fingers tilted Mycroft’s head to face his heated gaze.
John couldn’t help himself as he reached out his spare hand to stroke Sherlock’s curls. Smiling fondly at the sleeping man, John wanted to give him a little kiss, right on the tip of his nose.
“An admirer sent this, Sherlock. It’s a heart.” Irene laughed, taking the paper to read the little message written on it.
“I know. You’d only listen to the purple shirt of sex!!!” Harry hollered back cheekily before slamming the door shut behind her.
Almost immediately, Asher stood up and rubbed Rosie’s back gently, trying to soothe her. His mouth came close to her ear (to Sherlock, John, Greg and Mycroft’s horror) to whisper words of comfort to cool her down. Rosie’s eyes were shooting deadly daggers at Sherlock, her cheeks turning a violent shade of red.
John shook his head and sighed exasperatedly, wanting nothing more than to slap the hell out of his Sister. “I’m not gay! Why would you even assume that I would date Sherlock?”
Rosie blushed, a pretty pink colouring her pale skin. “I have a date on Friday. I hope you won’t mind...”
Lestrade’s grip tightens around Mycroft as he thrusts in harder. Mycroft feels so good and used like this, pinned under Lestrade, sweat dampening the couch. The other man picks up the pace again, definitely close, mumbling a string of filthy swear words and Mycroft cries out loudly with every thrust.
Mycroft jerks when Lestrade’s naughty tongue traces over the oversensitive flesh, but Lestrade is gentle and quick about it. As he cuddles on Mycroft’s side, he takes a couple of minutes to suck a hickey on his neck while they both calm down from their high.
“Don’t look so down.” Greg breathed down at Mycroft, whose face was only inches from his own, a look of complete surprise drawn on his features.
The first time John actually thought about marriage, it was after a case. Sherlock was bouncing little Rosie on his lap, chuckling as she cooed at him.
John felt like he was about to cry or wail. He was about toss the ring and eat a lot of cake. However, he swallows his embarrassment and asked Sherlock, voice a little raspy due to the sting of rejection, “Why are you upset, love?”
Just like that, the two were off to their favourite restaurant, John looking like all his dreams had come true and Sherlock with a rather shy, bashful look on his face. John really didn’t understand what was so shameful about being hungry, honestly, Sherlock was being (adorably) ridiculous.
It’s been a while since he’s read romance novels. But he was sucked into the story, like the romantic he was. He could feel his heart swooping in and out as the female lead struggled with her feelings for her female roommate.
John snorted. The mere thought that Sherlock’s devilishly handsome looks were more than enough to change a person’s sexuality was hilarious. He was about to say so until he remembered Irene Adler. Damn it. So he really was that good looking a bloke?
The letters were filled with truthfulness and affection, and Sherlock couldn’t help but fall for the person writing them.
So Mycroft was duly shocked when entered the room to see tiny Rosie, bouncing cheerfully on Greg’s lap, pretty eyes shining with joy. Almost immediately, Mycroft scowled at the little toddler, angry at her for stealing away Greg’s attention. (Because it is only logical to be jealous of a tiny toddler who requires constant attention)
John raised his eyebrows in shock, the lack of the usual stink of alcohol was very surprising. Instead, there was a distinct smell of milk and cigarettes in her breath that he could get used to. (But...smoking....)
John choked on his saliva and grinned foolishly. Something tells him that he was about to have one hell of a night.
As Sherlock scrolled through the posts, he noted that there was an increasing number of photos that were decidedly not John. Seems like he’s a social creature, unlike Sherlock. Each picture was like a perfect window that allowed Sherlock to look into John’s life. (And boy, Sherlock really liked what he saw)
1. The way he smiled when I first met him, despite the fact that I had essentially berated him on his incompetence.
A few days after the shirtless fiasco, John realised that he might have to introduce Harry to Sherlock. (Or else Mr Dramatic would be extremely huffy that he didn’t meet her) He wasn’t too worried about Harry meeting Sherlock, in fact, he was much more concerned about how Sherlock would be affected. After all, visits from Harry always end up a bit... disastrous.
3. His exemplary work ethic, he would worry constantly about cases but never lets his concern overstep boundaries.
“Ah, but satisfaction brought it back.” Mycroft nodded, stroking Greg’s hair once more as he continued, “You shall have your answer next week. A list of reasons as to why I like you so.”
All that led up to now, as John was making his way back from the shop to pick up the rings. It took very careful planning to fool Sherlock and John was actually very proud he had managed to do so.
And that is the story of how both Sherlock Holmes and John Watson became boyfriends. (And get suspended for having a very heated make out session under the tree for 10 minutes.)
Sherlock was shaken out of his mind palace by a large fluffy mass of something that was suddenly covering his face. Sputtering in shock, Sherlock flailed around aimlessly under the blanket, managing to fall from his comfortable position on the couch.
Standing at the edge of the pool, John’s grin was frozen and preserved in the picture. The sun shining brightly over his head, tracing over the golden mop of hair on John’s head. Someone seems to have thrown a ball into the water and John was playfully deflecting of the spray of water droplets. (Basically, John looked ethereal)
John’s eyes drifted to the detective’s face, a perfect image of innocence and smiled. Maybe he did. Maybe he did like Sherlock. Who cared? He kinda does like Sherlock.
Enthralled by his find, Sherlock leaned into the computer to gape at the image, not noticing that he had accidentally liked the picture. It was only when he slouched back in his chair to take it all in that he noticed the glaring red heart.
“I’m not ill, I’m just slightly... not good.” Sherlock muttered, his face flushed a gentle pink due to the high temperature he was running. His words were slightly impaired by his blocked nose, making it very hard for John to take him seriously.
As she said that, Sherlock’s expression morphed into one of betrayal and disbelief. (All in all it was a hideous expression)
“Oh...ok.” Sherlock was dumbfounded, is this what friends do? He had no idea. He was just thankful that he could maybe get to know the person behind the letters.
John stood very still, bent over the phone like a shocked chihuahua, wondering how Harry was able to do that. “How...how did you know?”
John looked on at Sherlock in disbelief. Was Sherlock being...nice? But...he was Sherlock, he didn’t do “nice”. John frowned and just shrugged, at least Sherlock was on his best behaviour and it would make this exchange go smoothly.
“My Brother is quite the piece of work, I sometimes find myself thankful that I do not work in close proximity with him.” Mycroft smiled fondly at Greg, “Do you want anything? Massage oil? A massage? Biscuits?”
“Sherlock, come on! It’s my Sister!” John berated from the door as he peeked through the eyehole to anticipate his sister’s arrival.
John looked at her in absolute horror before he turned to his flatmate to apologise. “God, Sherlock. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean for that to come out. I’m not gay...you see.”
Rosie, a now very lovely grown up teenager with choppy short blonde hair, sat on the couch opposite, looking very upset. Her brown eyes were shining with spite as she scowled at her dad. She couldn’t help wondering if it would have been easier to sneak out of the house to go on her date instead of this.
“I don’t need those...I just need you.” Greg grinned as he reached over to clasp Mycroft’s hand in his. Mycroft’s cheeks turned a gentle pink as he rubbed little circles in Greg’s palm.
Like an anxious schoolboy, Mycroft quickly glanced at the mirror to survey his appearance. He looked tired, eyes all droopy and cheeks pale. His frown lines looked more prominent and his tie was wrinkled.
“Ow! Okay, chill. Don’t get your boxers in a twist mate, just being friendly!” Charles sniggered, pulling his arm away from John’s nasty grip.
“I didn’t. Congratulations John, welcome to the club!!!” Harry yelled into the phone before continuing in a very suggestive tone, “So....does your little Sherly knowwwww?”
“Now, you two go out and have a lovely time. The little babe will be fast asleep when you get home.” Mrs Hudson tickled Rosie under her Chin, rejoicing in the tiny peaks of laughter she was eliciting from the little one.
“Fine,” Sherlock relented, turning his body to face John. He reached his hand out to grab the pills and he quickly dry swallowed them. John shook his head in mock disapproval and placed the cold towel on Sherlock’s forehead.
John’s eyes narrowed as the door opened to reveal an Asian boy with a luscious head of black hair. His ears were pierced with black studs and there was definitely some sort of eyeliner on his face. He was wearing a leather jacket in a shocking shade of blue and a pair of slippers adorned his feet. (The tattoos were basically part of the look at this point)
And when they get bored of leading him on, they’ll break him with their laughs and jeers. Well, not today, idiots.
Of course, while Sherlock was saying this, John’s cheeks were turning brilliantly red, with the tips of his ears going a little pink for emphasis. Here was his roommate/crush, lecturing him on how obvious he was when he was crushing hard on him. God, it was a huge turn on for John.
John’s reflexes acted faster than he did, making him spit out his pasta. The chewed up bits spattered over Sherlock’s navy suit, causing John to wince before saying, “I’m sorry?”
Shaking his head, Mycroft used his fingers to hastily comb back his hair as Greg entered his office. The inspector looked a little worse for wear, eye bags heavy and a slowing gait. (That only meant one thing)
“They sound lovely.” John spoke reassuringly, patting Sherlock’s shoulder. It was the first thing he had said after hearing what Sherlock had said.
(Needless to say, Mycroft and Greg were promptly informed about Rosie’s potential suitor meeting on Friday.)
Greg mumbled the words as he read, eyes brightening with every line he read out. Almost simultaneously, Mycroft’s cheeks were tinted a slight red with every word Greg mumbled. When Greg reached the end, Mycroft’s cheeks and ears were basically the epitome of fire engine red.
The first thing he noticed was the paper. The regular lined paper covered with the slanted messy handwriting he knew so well. Sherlock felt his heart clench as he read the letter:
Soon, Lestrade’s two fingers turned into three, each helping to scissor and stretch out the moaning mess that was Mycroft. His quick fingers almost never leaving that precious bundle of nerves, constantly pressing and abusing it, making Mycroft whimper and blink back tears of pleasure.
Mycroft stayed silent, eyes hooded with anticipation as Lestrade hitched himself higher on his lap to grind their erections together. Mycroft moaned, definitely unashamed as he whined and bucked his hips forward for more friction. His crotch felt like it was on fire and he needed more.
7. The silly dates he brings us on that I secretly love. Especially the little picnics in the park at night. (Even though my best suit was thoroughly stained with grass stains)
“Greg...Gregory please...” he whined, hands scrabbling frantically against the expensive Italian couch, leaving definitive claw marks.
“Uhh...it’s probably a prank. They didn’t put my name.” Sherlock mumbled, clutching his books tightly to his chest as he walked past, “I need to get to class.”
“Oi! We’ve been in here for 20 minutes, pretty boy is going to be wondering what we are doing!” Harry hissed, pulling John out of the door to the living room.
“You spelt ‘like’ wrongly here,” Sherlock pointed out, leaning closer to John to point out his error. He could definitely hear John’s breath hitch as his shoulder brushed the blond’s.
“Move...Greg...” Mycroft gasped at the new feeling. He finds himself panting and squeaking while he fists frantically at the nothing, but the feeling is so good and so consuming that he simply does not care and all he could think about was GregGregGreg.
Sherlock slowed his steps, taking time to marvel at John’s adorable embarrassed face. He crawled past the rugby team, pressing his lips in distaste as the sweaty backs of sportsmen made contact with his arm.
Mycroft’s gentle massage paused for a second as his lips curled into an unreadable smile. “I must say, it is terribly straightforward of you to inquire why I like you. Why twelve? Perhaps it could be linked to your obsession with Christmas?”
Lestrade’s breath stutters to process the words coming out of Mycroft’s mouth. All of a sudden, he pulls out. The tip is barely in Mycroft’s ass, causing Mycroft to to whimper needy. Quickly, he thrusts in deeper, hips pistoning in and out at a much quicker pace.
Sherlock flinched as he glared at the scrap of paper. It was probably someone seeking to humiliate him. They would want him to become a stupid prancing hopeful who would put him hands to his chest and gasped like those annoying cheerleaders who constantly trailed the rugby team.
Greg tilted himself forward so that he could reach over and clasp his hand over Mycroft’s to comfort him. He found that rubbing his thumb against Mycroft’s palm would be extremely calming to the distressed Holmes.
John smiled when he heard Sherlock’s “I’m annoyed at you” huff. A few weeks ago he would have recoiled at the thought of even entertaining the grouchy man but ever since he realised he had feelings for the insufferable git, he’s become more tolerant of Sherlock’s antics.
Greg nodded as he lifted the tiny babbling child, cooing at her as she giggled. He tucked her into her crib, smiling at the little girl. He knew had a soft spot for the little girl, probably because she reminded him of his own children when they were born. Now, they were more prickly that ever, seeing that they’ve just entered the terrible teens.
“Sherlock, you have to take the medicine.” John chided, setting the tray down on the bedside table. He drew up and chair and sat next to Sherlock’s bed, immediately setting up. He arranged the pills in his hand, balancing it so that he could carry a glass a water at the same time. In his other hand, he grabbed a cold towel, poised to slap down on Sherlock’s forehead.
If he tried to confront the writer, or catch him. He might not like Sherlock. He would probably be all happy about it at first but will change his mind about Sherlock once he got close to him. And he’ll leave and never come back and break Sherlock’s heart.
“Just bring him over before your date and you can go.” John sighed as he stared at Rosie. She really did look like him, precious thing.
Rosie’s eyes widened and she hissed at Sherlock in Asher’s defence. (who looked very frightened and taken aback by Sherlock’s words) “Dad! You should have let him tell you himself!”
“About time you two got together. You’re truly a sight!” Irene purred, flicking her wrist towards them in a perfected motion. The rugby team hollered their assent, 60% of them totally captivated by The Woman.
“What did you say?” Sherlock spluttered, nearly dropping the mixing bowl on the ground in surprise. He knew John would react in a much more “normal” way but he was in the toilet and was not setting any standards right now.
Even on the earphones, both Sherlock and John heard Greg let out a disapproving gasp. It was quickly followed by a ‘shut it sweetheart, I need to see this’ by Mycroft.
“She was nervous, how could she not? Melissa was never the type to want physical contact. Her heart was beating wildly as-“ John read, pausing for a second when Sherlock grabbed his spare hand to cuddle with.
This one was addressed to him, his name underlined three times in regular black ballpoint ink. The handwriting was a little messy and slightly slanted as if it was written in a hurry. The lined paper was folded into fours and cut to look like a four leafed clover. A cute little holographic sticker in the shape of a heart was pasted on the back.
“JAWNNNN! ARE YOU AWARE THAT ROSIE HAS ANOTHER SUITOR?” He bellowed, stifling John, who was on the way back from the toilet.
“John...I’ve seemed to taken a pro stripper stance. Could you help me?” Sherlock asked, clearly embarrassed.
“Sherlock, you haven’t slept for days.” John crossed his arms and frowned at the Detective across him. The silver moon outside the window would mark the third night Sherlock refused to sleep and John was getting a little worried for him.
Sherlock was as stiff as a board, his entire face tensed considerably when John’s lips touched his. In just a split second, Sherlock had melted. His mouth moved slowly against John’s, not knowing quite what he was doing, but wanting it so badly.
“You are... hungry? Are you serious, Sherlock?” John nearly gasped in disbelief at the admission. Almost immediately, his caretaker instinct took over, making him sound like an overprotective Mother hen, “Great, go get your jacket and coat. Bring your wallet. We are going to Angelo’s to get you a proper meal.  Bring an umbrella, it looks like it’s about to rain. If you forget, I will be very disappointed in you.”
But that was before his phone buzzed. His Instagram. John had replied. Oh shit. Oh shitshitshitshitshit.
Mycroft had never felt so upset at Sherlock in his life. Okay, that was an exaggeration. Mycroft was far more upset when Sherlock childishly covered everything in his office with whipped cream. But still.
“Sherlock has an admiiiiiiirrreeerrr!” Irene sang, giggling at Sherlock’s flustered state. She gave John a suggestive wink and slowly licked her lips for effect.
“Mycroft, shut up! I’m trying to interview a kid here!” Sherlock groaned aloud, making Rosie flush with embarrassment and rage.
Taking a deep breath, John continued, “Her heart was beating wildly as Melissa leaned in to brush my hair away from my eyes. “It was always you...” I breathed. Melissa smiled and shook her head, she was afraid.”
He had been timing his own grocery runs to see how Long they were on average. He would then get Molly to buy all the things on his grocery list while he ran to get the rings and collect them on his way home. All within the average time it took for him to go to the supermarket.
“Am I gay...?” John’s voice trailed off as his eyes landed on Sherlock’s sleeping form, “For Sherlock?”
“DID HE?” she leapt up from her position on the couch, looking like she was about to burst into one of her unfortunate fits of rage. (They have become a bit of a problem, and Rosie has been following John to therapy to cope with her anger issues)
They quickly ordered their usuals and settled down to eat. Halfway through their meal, Sherlock decides to interrupt the mutual respect for food and manners by blatantly asking John, “Do you like me as a lover, John?”
“Father, I’m not going to discuss fungi on Friday! I have a date!” Rosie protested at Sherlock, who was merely helping John to bake a cake before being attacked with such trifling news.
Lestrade fucks him hard through it and Mycroft’s spasming muscles have him spilling into the condom as he collapses over Mycroft. They breathe together for a moment before Lestrade pulls out and ties off condom. Mycroft feels boneless as he watches Lestrade lick all of his come off of his soft dick and stomach.
“You wouldn’t...look half bad...” John mumbled, licking his lips unconsciously, obviously unaware that he said this out loud.
John placed his hand on Sherlock’s neck, effectively silencing Sherlock. He felt a blush creeping up his neck as he effectively stroked Sherlock’s neck to check his temperature.
Greg paused as he rubbed comforting circles into Mycroft’s palm before breathing out two little heartbreaking words, “Oh, Mycroft....”
They burst into the flat and sprawled over the living room floor, kissing and laughing. They snuggled sweetly on the carpeted floor, locking their hands together as they stared up at the ceiling.
The star of the show, however, was Sherlock’s pale, scarred torso, which was on full display underneath the coat. The rainwater gave it a pearly sheen and the faint lines of lean muscle could be seen. His waistline was incredibly small, and Sherlock’s taut belly showed signs of abdominal muscle.
Somewhere along the way it turned into full on letters, letters that told Sherlock wonderful things that he dared to believe. Letters telling him why he(secret admirer is a guy) liked Sherlock and soon it was becoming so much.
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he immediately fumbled to “unlike” the photo. Clicking hastily, the red heart on the screen disappeared. Unfortunately for Sherlock, John would have already received the notification. Groaning loudly at his mistake, Sherlock cradled his head in his hands as he contemplated what to do next.
“Fuck it.” John mumbled as he leaned forward to breath in Sherlock’s scent. (He smelled like berries, something woody and oh so Sherlock)
But meanwhile, he had to deal with a crying baby. John scrunched his nose at the stench from Rosie’s diaper.
“I’m... hungry...” Sherlock confessed, dipping his head down, causing his hair to fall in front of his eyes in the most swoon worthy way. (Not that John would openly swoon just like that. He had self control.)
John huffed in mock anger as he motioned to get closer. “I’m going to check if you’re warm and if you are, you are not going out. Honestly, why do I have to take care of you? You are such a child.”
So Mycroft sat on the sofa, grabbed a piece of paper and decided to make good on his promise to find things that he liked about Greg. As he wrote, the frown on Mycroft’s face turned into a happy grin.
“Sherlock, “ John spoke slowly after a few minutes of intense nuzzling, trying to remove his poor hand so that he could make some tea, “You are running a fever. You should go lie down.”
“I am not bringing him home. You scare away all my dates, Father. Every time I want to go out and have fun, you spoil it!” Rosie huffed and turned away from her parents.
Sherlock stared at his Daughter in absolute horror. His beautiful, steadfast, strong, brash (insert independent woman adjectives here) girl was blushing (?!) over a male. Judging by her smile and posture, this was not the first date she had gone on with this boy. Shaking his head, he raised a perfectly plucked eyebrow before yelling for his husband.
“Shut up.” John felt his face turn an embarrassingly deep shade of crimson, wanting to punch Harry through the phone for both the use of suggestive tone and for calling Sherlock “Sherly”.
Mycroft moans lewdly and starts pushing back against Greg to meet his thrusts. It feels like he’s being split open, and it’s so addictive and amazing that he wants to scream. Then Lestrade changes his angle, tilting Mycroft’s leg upwards and starts rubbing hard over his sweet spot with each thrust.
So it was quite understandable that he didn’t see John Watson, a well liked member of the rugby team, fresh out of the changing rooms from a rowdy game of rugby. The two collided head on and Sherlock, being ever so dramatic, had made a spectacle of himself falling onto the floor.
Sherlock knew he wasn’t supposed to be doing this. He certainly should not be foraging for information about the cute rugby player whom he bumped into in class. He should definitely just talk to John instead of doing a very thorough internet stalk on his Instagram.
Through the earpieces, Mycroft murmured, “Yes, her- bollocks I mean his file is extremely interesting. Why...he’s...”
“He’s excellent, of course but...he’s informed me that we have no less than seven moles in Scotland Yard.” Greg sighed, biting his lip, “He won’t tell me who. Just told me that it’s unfortunately not Anderson or Donavan.”
John sat across Sherlock on the couch, not really listening to the boring conversation that Sherlock and Harry were immersed in. He was far more interested how Sherlock looked in his outfit.
He didn’t know how Long he was scrolling for till he saw that photo. It was a photo taken in the summer the year before. It seemed that John had been slightly skinnier the year before and was less insecure about taking a picture with his chest exposed.
Mycroft immediately tapped a sleepy Greg next to him and narrowed his eyes on one of the many monitors in front of him. All of them were of the wonderful Holmes apartment, spanning every room, from the master bedroom (oh dear) to Rosie’s bedroom. (Not the bathroom, because both Rosie and John were about to throw a fit.)
Sherlock nodded awkwardly, trying not to freak out about the mere five centimetres that kept them apart. He could nearly smell the mint in John’s breath and was trying not to desperately sniff John’s mouth.
Seeing that John was in his own little space, Sherlock tried to include him in the conversation. (Sherlock was absolutely butchering the conversation and if John was listening instead of checking out his sexy roommate, he would have known that Harry was discussing about gay clubs in London.)
Lestrade huffed and complied with Mycroft’s (slightly bossy) command. As he thrusted into Mycroft’s compliant body, he can hear himself making filthy, breathy noises and he’s quite surprised they’re coming from him. It’s almost surreal. Below him, Mycroft is making noises too. Desperate moans, incessant whimpers and hissed expletives pepper the air as Lestrade fills him repeatedly.
“Dammit Sherlock!” John groaned, interrupting Sherlock’s adorable rambling about gene splicing, “You’re preventing your own proposal!”
Meanwhile Sherlock was sitting in the opposite chair, just observing John. He was bored. Of course, deducing the hell out of John while he listened could be the answer. For example, once Sherlock deuces John was more of a cat person in front of his then Girlfriend (who owned a dog), they fought wondrously.
Harry pursed her lips and nodded sarcastically before leaning towards a very uncharacteristically silent Sherlock to whisper (very loudly). “He’s only gay for you...you see.”
Hissing when he realised what he was doing, John recoiled away from his thoughts and buried himself into his book. Not. Gay.
“Hello, baby bro! So good to see ya! How have you been??!” Harry blurted as she wrapped John in a tight embrace. Without awaiting his response, she leaned over to exhale in front of John’s face.
“Go to bed, Sherlock. I’ll go there later.” John smiled as the Long legged Detective whined sleepily, finding his actions a little too endearing.
Sherlock bit back a grin as he saw John slap Mike’s arm playfully, whole face literally shining with sheepish amusement. A large holographic sticker in the shape of a star was pasted on the rugby player’s forehead, making John become the center of attention.
Which leads us to the now, 10 minutes before Harry was coming over to the flat. John had already yelled for Sherlock to come and wait in the living room like a civil person but he was somewhere in his room, screeching on the violin in private. The poor man must be stressed, since John hadn’t heard such terrible sounds since Irene Adler.
It was a regular rainy day in the flat. Sherlock had went bouncing off to the morgue to bother Molly for body parts and John was at home enjoying a particularly lovely cup of tea.
And that was basically the story of how Sherlock refused to let Mycroft and ‘Gavin’ ever try to babysit Rosie. (But John found it rather amusing. In fact I’m pretty sure they did the do that day too so...)
“Harry, I just wanted to call because I figured something out!” John whispered as if he was conspiring with an enemy. (Sherlock was in the other room, having woken up to update his boring blog)
As Asher calmed Rosie down, Sherlock’s manic grin softened into something much more genuine. His blue green eyes seemed to become a lot less piercing and more welcome.
“I was going to propose to you!” Sherlock blurted, taking another ring out of his pocket and slamming it down next to the wine glass.
It broke Greg’s heart that Mycroft hadn’t yet said ‘I love you’ back to him. But he had to wait. Mycroft wasn’t ready. Sherlock and John were apparently the same, with John declaring his love first and Sherlock shyly saying it back a lot later. Apparently, the Holmes are shy.
“You can’t!” Sherlock’s voice rumbled comfortingly, nuzzling into the crook of John’s arm while flipping off an unknown person.
“Classified...” Mycroft sighed, bringing his free hand up towards him to massage his temples. “The long and short of it being that I am temporarily suspended from work due to...my sexuality.”
Either way, Sherlock was embarrassed. So embarrassed, that he was about to call Mycroft to ask him if it were possible allow Sherlock to reside in one of his dwellings in Paris.
“Asher, do take a seat.” Sherlock gave him his ‘new people’ smile, effectively looking like one of those killer clowns.
Just a few more rough, deep thrusts and dizzying jabs to his sensitive prostate and Mycroft squeezes his eyes shut and spasms as his orgasm explodes out of him, untouched.
Which brings him back to where he was. Having deduced John’s Instagram handle, Sherlock set himself onto the wonderful task that was internet stalking a good looking bloke. Not just good looking, judging by the pictures, John was definitely downright attractive.
“Dad, Father, this is Asher.” Rosie smiled, albeit nervously, “I’ll go get him a drink.” To Asher, she flashed him an encouraging smile. “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine.” She mouthed before scurrying to the kitchen.
“Urm...no, not really. You can read it though...” Mycroft’s voice trailed off for the first time in his life. He ducked his head down as he felt Greg shift his head to get a proper peek at the paper.
“Ugh.” Greg groaned as he collapsed on the chair, rubbing his forehead as he gratefully accepted the glass of water that Mycroft pushed in front of him.
“Sherlock, as your doctor, you should really get some rest.” John glanced at the back of the Detective and giggled internally before sternly continuing, “I refuse to accept no as an answer. I’m going to get you a blanket to sleep in right now.”
“Well...it’s safe to assume that this wasn’t your intention.” Sherlock spoke softly, as if John were a frightened animal. Despite his rather neutral expression, his eyes were twinkling with interest.
So Sherlock just let it happen. And he basked in the happiness he felt every time he received a message. Yet somehow, in the bottom of his inner consciousness, he wanted more.
They both walked into the cozy Italian restaurant, settling into the booth where they first had dinner together. However, one thing was different:
“He looked like a respectable gentleman who I have no trouble determining came from respectable household that are very accepting. I also know that he has a very good moral compass. That jacket is hideous but was being sold by a homeless lady on the street, he felt pity and paid her generously. He also learns a type of Chinese martial arts, judging by the types of muscle he seemed to have developed.”
John didn’t quite know how he got involved in a relationship with Sherlock. He simply remembered Sherlock being very excited and planting a gigantic kiss on his lips. His explanation was, ‘I think we needed that.’
“Oh. You...aren’t ready?” John offered, heart sinking as he watched the love of his life say nothing in response.
John cracked a faint smile as he reached out toward Sherlock to brush his hair out of his face. His lips were a little swollen and he could see a slight puffiness of Sherlock’s lips too.
Mycroft had arrived home in a foul mood, slamming the door behind him as he stomped his way up the stairs. The fact that Greg had not been at the door to welcome Mycroft with the usual peppering of kisses and tea seemed to have worsened his mood significantly.
“Sparkly Watson! Sparkly Watson!” One of the rugby player’s loud voices pervaded Sherlock senses as he saw Mike Stanford and a group of rugby players guffawing.
Instead, he just held Sherlock’s gaze, which was slowly becoming more and more heated. Sherlock bent his head down slowly, letting his nose brush John’s. John gasped as Sherlock nuzzled into his cheek, his skin tingling when coming into contact with Sherlock’s cheek.
Sherlock let out an adorable huff and purposely turned his head to look at the wall. He refused to listen to John, since when did he ever obey John anyway.
Sherlock winced and made eye contact with Asher, “So, Asher. What are your intentions with my Daughter and will your anatomy come between your relationship if taken further?”
Which led to the second thing John realised. It really was quite simple but it was kinda difficult to totally ignore the fact that the object of his affections was not... receptive of his feelings. John knew he was in love with Sherlock but he didn’t really know what to do about it.
John exhaled slowly as he looked up at Sherlock, losing himself into those gorgeous blue green eyes that knew him so well. A single curly lock of hair dangled over John, tickling his nose. John’s eyes drifted down to Sherlock’s lips and he turned red at how close they were to his.
A full second of silence envelopes the table until John finally comprehended what he said. “OH NO. I DIDN’T MEAN THAT. I MEAN. I’M NOT GAY. NOT THAT YOU WOULDN’T LOOK GOOD. BUT THAT WAS THE POINT. I DON’T KNOW. YOU’RE A GOOD LOOKING FELLA. I DON’T—“
Sherlock nodded as he awkwardly patted Asher’s back before saying, “Well...Have fun. The museum is holding a rather interesting fossil exhibit that I er... recommend you to go to.”
“I mean...erm...” John fumbled, taking out the ring with his shaky hands and bowing slightly to make up for not kneeling, “Be my husband? I mean...me marry...JESUS! Will you marry me?”
“Gr...Gregory...please fuck me....fuck me please...ahhh...” Mycroft begged when Lestrade twisted his fingers, stroking his prostate in a teasing manner that was just too much. He begs shamelessly until Greg pulls the fingers out and Mycroft sobs in frustration, even as he hears Greg rip open the condom.
As Watson left the room to find a blanket, Sherlock felt the corners of his mouth turn upwards into a reluctant smile. Somewhere in his mind palace, he was berating himself for having feelings for his flatmate. But John was the first person to genuinely like Sherlock and it was only natural for Sherlock to feel an attraction towards him. (Also, quite embarrassingly so, Sherlock had a thing for army men. Not that he would admit it. But the thought of it was... entertaining)
“John?” The Detective in question asked, shaking John out of his stupor. “What I’m about to ask of you is something very strange and out of the norm for me. You must answer me honestly without getting too excited. Can you do that?”
Greg had obviously noted that Mycroft had arrived back home. However, seeing that he had a tiny child in his hands due to “a dire emergency, Gavin”, he could not go to the door to give Mycroft his usual warm welcome. (Kisses and tea equals a very happy Mycroft)
John immediately turned to Sherlock to give him the slightest of headshakes to signify his disapproval. Meanwhile, Greg was letting out a rather judgemental ‘hmm’. Rosie appeared, carrying a tray laden with cookies (chocolate, to sweeten up Sherlock) and cold water.
Those plans for promised fun times, however, were unable to be carried out due to something unexpected coming up on Greg’s end. Poor Mycroft arrived to a silent house, no roaring fire or a sexy half dressed Greg. Just a pathetic note on the table accompanied with a cup of very cold tea.
“FOR GOODNESS SAKES, SHERLOCK, ASK HIM SOMETHING. YOU DON’T LOOK VERY NORMAL.” Mycroft yelled, the tension getting on his nerves as he glared at the screen.
Sherlock nodded and nuzzled John’s cheek, hiding his burning face. His whole face felt hot and his lips were tingly. “I don’t think I can kiss again, I’m really hot.”
It’s final. It’s impossible, John cannot possibly propose to Sherlock. The rings shall burn forevermore in his pocket until he dies. Alone. Unwanted by anyone.
Oh well, it was too late to stop now, he’s already 30 weeks in and there are no signs of stopping. As Sherlock scrolled through John’s Instagram, he recalled what had happened earlier in the afternoon that prompted this chain of events...
“Sherlock...I’m a doctor.” John warned as he stared at Sherlock’s adorable pouty lips. He was definitely not thinking about how to shut them up by kissing the Detective.
Under the dramatic moonlight, John and Sherlock lay on the floor, blanket totally disregarded as they held each other’s hands and looked at the ceiling. In that moment, nothing ever felt so right.
The statement had no bite to it, no vicious intent to wound Sherlock mental state. Yet John sprung to Sherlock’s side immediately, poised to defend Sherlock.
“Elevated heartbeat and the dilation of your pupil. I noticed it...recently.” Sherlock blurted, his cheeks turning an adorable shade of pink. He flopped over to John’s left and grinned shamelessly at John.
“I’m not gay.” John admonished to himself, nearly dropping his book when Sherlock raised his eyebrows at him.
Sherlock leaned in, bumping his nose against John’s, his breath ghosting over John’s lips. As he tried to press his lips against John, neither of them anticipated the hollering of the entire rugby team and the one and only Irene Adler.
“Of course, I am a transgender male but I don’t really see it coming in between us. Rosie has been very understanding.” Asher explained, his cheeks turning red, obviously a little embarrassed.
“I think...you’ve Long outstayed your welcome, Miss Watson.” Sherlock gritted through his teeth, lowering his hand to his side.
“The fact that...I...love...him...-oh Mycroft!” Greg exclaimed, turning so that he was directly facing the blushing man.
Number one, realising that he was gay was freeing to John. It was like a cage had been lifted from his body and left him a free spirit. He felt really good about himself, more confident, no longer wanting to feel too insecure about who he was. Jesus, the first thing he did was to call Harry. (And of course that went... “well”)
Although the secret admirer probably didn’t exist, Sherlock couldn’t help but feel a little flattered. It was nice to know that someone liked him, or even bothered to pretend to. At least they tried to sound that they liked him.
Harry’s pride was rather apparent as she grinned at her Brother. “Tad— oh my...who is this?” Harry purred, glancing behind John’s shoulder to look at Sherlock.
“Okay.” Greg reached a hand up to boop Mycroft’s nose, laughing as Mycroft stuck out his tongue in retaliation. After a little fooling around, somehow Mycroft’s lips had landed on Greg’s.
“You don’t know that, John. Also when are you going to tell me that you are going to visit your Sister? Why can’t I meet her? Is it because we are both addicts? Does that make you uncomfortable?”
With that, John leaned over and pressed a sweet, loving kiss on Sherlock’s temple. No more worrying, no more denying, he was unapologetically, undeniably, in love with Sherlock.
Sherlock froze, his brain pausing to relish the touch of John’s callused hand against his cheek. John was touching him. John was touching him. JOHN WAS TOUCHING HIM. OH MY GOD.
It’s been four years since The Kiss and John was very happy and content with where they were. They were boyfriends who solve murders  and kiss and have sex. They were also Boyfriends who were still loving and sweet.
“Who put this in my locker?” Sherlock snarled, shoving the offending piece of paper under Irene’s nose. He sniffed disapprovingly at it as Irene squinted to look at it.
“Jesus...I...Gregory...please...” Mycroft groaned, thrusting into Greg’s hands. A wet patch form by his precome was already forming, not that Mycroft cared. All he wanted was Greg, just more and more of Greg.
John’s eyes widened as he stared at the magazines on the tray. Slowly, he started to reach for the first one, titled ‘The Great Mistakes of Newton’. He had never read to Sherlock and found it incredibly intimidating to read to his roommate.
As if on cue, the front door burst open to reveal Sherlock, who was...unapologetically shirtless. His curly locks were wet and were sticking to his forehead, dripping water all over the carpet. His eyes were bright, like he was injected with a generous dose of adrenaline.
Lips swollen and puffy from kissing, John swore that he had never been as happy as that night. With Sherlock near him, how could he ever be upset?
“Sherlock found the moles, have to go back to work. I’m so sorry that I’m not here. I’ll see you soon. Love, Greg.”
They kissed and kissed until their lips became red and swollen. Somewhere in the middle of the process, Greg had climbed onto Mycroft’s lap and was now straddling him while he ferociously ravaged the man below. Mycroft on the other, was not one to object, and allowed himself to just be consumed by the feeling of intense attraction.
Sherlock was lying on his bed like a corpse, hands by his side with his eyes wide open. His pale white alabaster skin was tinged pink with the fever and his lips were firmly pursed together. His head turned towards John and he scrunched his nose adorably, pulling the blankets over his mouth.
His heart was stalled in his chest as Sherlock’s shocked expression turned into one of utmost anger. Sherlock huffed and leaned back, muttering angrily under his breath.
Mycroft wails and shudders as his knees slip further apart on the couch until he feels like he might fall off and his hands grab frantically at the throw pillows behind his head. He’s never felt so good in his life, and he can feel his orgasm building deep in him. Lestrade is getting close too. Mycroft can tell because one of his warm hands had found its way to Mycroft’s chest, pinning him in place on the couch, and the other arm wraps around his middle and he grabs possessively at Mycroft’s waist.
Of course, he liked Sherlock. Sherlock was his Best Friend, his closest Friend. They shared an apartment together and stuff but did he really like Sherlock like that? He supposed that maybe the piercing feeling he felt whenever Molly talked to Sherlock was because he was worried for her but...
In the dim light of the street lamps outside, it was obvious a single tear slipped down Sherlock’s cheek.
Sherlock didn’t answer, he simply kept his eyes focused downward, hoping John would give up and leave, but John continued.
Sherlock smiled a bit down at his phone and ran his thumb over the screen before sending a text in reply. John wouldn’t reply quickly, he was of course asleep beside his bride to be.
John hung his head, nodding some. “Yes…” Was his weak reply. “I know… That’s why she… isn’t home. Rosie was born the day after I took you to the hospital… and she disappeared the night after we brought our daughter home. I had thought maybe she just left, I’ve had that happen before without an explanation.”
The facade only got so far before Sherlock was looking quite a bit rough, face with stubble a few days old and eyes heavily circled in purple and red. His hair clung to his forehead and he often had fits of shivering, but still managed to make his way into the outside world, sitting at a pub and watching a man across the bar. His target had left ages ago with some young man, to have sex, he deduced, but it was not the right time to follow the man yet, he needed undeniable proof to approach him.
Sitting with Sherlock in the kitchen, he intertwined his own fingers on the table top and looked up to the dark haired man. He took several long seconds to compose his thoughts before opening his mouth to speak, and when he did, Sherlock seemed to hone in on him, and simultaneously look right through him. It was almost as if John could see Sherlock’s brain stop working and the cogs start to stutter and smoke as he tried to comprehend what John was saying.
“No. These go, too. I can’t even leave you alone for a week to tend to my pregnant wife without you trying to ruin your life. You are an infant, Sherlock. No, worse than an infant.”
When Sherlock falls silent, John takes a moment to compose himself. He slowly lifts his head from his shaking hands and stares pointedly at Sherlock. John lets out a shaky breath and whispers,"I would like to know what the hell you were thinking." Sherlock sat in dumb silence as he stared at his beloved Blogger.
10. The gentle kisses we exchange, almost daily but he still makes it feel like being kissed for the first time.
Somewhere in the city of London, John Watson was smiling at his phone. He was filled with anticipation to meet Sherlock again and a little throb from his heart agreed.
“Alright then.” Sherlock nodded before unfolding the paper and smoothing it put on the grassy ground.
And that was only the beginning. With the roaring lust Sherlock had harbored inside of him, he kissed John in a way no man had ever kissed him, slow and sensual. Sherlock slid his tongue inside John’s mouth, tracing the sides of John’s tongue. Sherlock slid his hand up along John’s side to his cheek to deepen the kiss.
They still in the same position and panting feverishly when the door flies open, revealing Sherlock and John, here to collect Rosie.
Sherlock let out a high pitched whimper and grumbled sleepily as John withdrew his hand, “But... I want... “
John grumbled something about it not being any of Sherlock’s business and that he was going to his room.
“What? Did you finally realise that you were gay for Sherlock?” Harry spoke, voice muffled by phone’s poor quality speaker.
Harry nodded cheerfully, unaware of the damage she has done. “I know, I’m just here as a voice of reason.” She chirped, standing up and walking to the door by herself. There was a definitive spring in her step.
“Also, cockblocker is a bad word.” John added in (a little pathetically) before stroking Rosie’s shoulder, “We love you, you know.”
Watson turned towards his Detective and grinned back, teeth and all. “You are, without doubt, an insufferable git.” He announced, before bursting into laughter.
Sherlock grinned as Rosie ran to the door, eager to answer the door. She looked so worried, the poor thing, it was almost endearing to look at her in such a state of distress.
“Hm, what are you doing Myc?” Greg’s fingers sneaked onto Mycroft’s shoulders, massaging them as he settled his head on Mycroft’s left shoulder.
“That you are.” John laughed, wrapping his arms around Sherlock. His hands stroked the other’s back gently, trying to reassure the suddenly very shy Sherlock.
Mycroft hummed his agreement while Greg spluttered incoherently. (“W-what??? Why????? asdfghjkl!!?”) As Mycroft scanned the screen, he took in Asher’s appearance one last time before pulling out his earpiece. “The boy needs a suit, that jacket is most unbecoming of a man.”
Much to Sherlock’s horror, John expressed interest in Irene’s statement. He leaned forward, reaching for the paper in Sherlock’s hand. That gave Sherlock a quick window to sniff the soft almond scent wafting out of John’s blond locks.
While Sherlock went yammering about the science of attraction, John swallowed his fear. He stared at his chittering roommate, who was pointing out things about different people in the room in rapid fire style. John stared into the strange, beautiful, blue green eyes that he knew so well and took a deep breath.
“Shut up, purple shirt of sex.” John huffed, crossing his arms. He was embarrassed and derailed by Harry’s stupid remarks and just wanted to insult Sherlock.
“Yes.” Sherlock blushed, a crimson shade quickly spreading from his cheeks to the tips of his ears. His eyes were fixed on the tablecloth, wandering anywhere except into John’s eyes.
As Sherlock trudged his way to his room, John went to the kitchen to make two cups of green tea. Sherlock had never been sick before, although it was inevitable, since that man viewed his body as a transport. John bet that he had to be the one to personally nurse Sherlock so that he would actually recover.
Sherlock grinned and placed his phone on the table. An indescribable warmth tickled his chest and spread throughout his body as he grinned stupidly at the computer screen. For the first time in his life, he was at a loss for words. He had a date tomorrow, a real date. With a dashing, wonderful man.
Sherlock looked a bit surprised at John’s comment. Find out what about Mary? Did John know that her identity was a lie? That she was essentially a trained assassin?
Sherlock was not only in the hospital, John had insisted that he be placed on suicide watch for a minimum of two weeks. Sherlock naturally thought it was silly, because John knew better than most that Sherlock was not capable of killing himself. He found the idea to be doing more harm that good, despite feeling at times that those around him would be happier if he wasn’t there to make rude comments or make them feel like idiots.
When Sherlock regained control of his thoughts, he was in the bedroom of the man from the bar, his improvised John Watson. He was resting back against the pillows of this stranger’s bed after they had suggested a shower, taking time to clean Sherlock and learn curves of his body. He even would whisper, “amazing” from time to time, making it even easier for Sherlock to close his eyes and imagine John.
Hearing his boyfriend talk like that always got him riled up. He quickly flipped them over, "As you wish, love." John leaned down, licking his neck. "Be as loud as you want," he whispered then bit down. Sherlock moaned and slightly arched his back. John connected their lips while he got to work unbuttoning the purple shirt Sherlock was wearing. Sherlock panted and ran his fingers through John's golden grey hair. The soldier ground his erection into the man beneath him, being rewarded with another delicious moan. The sound of a belt buckle being removed joined the symphony of heavy breathing, then soon the sound of a belt hitting the floor.
“You absolute and utter cock! Two years! Two bloody years I thought you were dead!” He shouted, pointing an accusing finger at the other man as a group of several people pulled him off of Sherlock. He was doing his very best to keep his voice from breaking, but the emotion that washed over him cut deeply like some surgical blade, making it hard to ignore the tightness in his throat and the burning in his eyes.
After playing the violin for John and Mary’s dance, he distracted himself with making deductions with Janine Hawkins about men she was considering to take home with her that evening. She had jokingly tried to flirt with Sherlock about a tradition for the Bridesmaid and Best Man to have sex with each other, but he was far too involved in his own thoughts to even make an attempt to understand the flirtation. He simply allowed her attempts to falter off into her wandering off to find something more to drink before the night concluded.
I appreciate the kudos and such on this fic! I've loved writing it. I hope you all are enjoying how the story is developing.
When Sherlock moved the glasses he had stolen from another table off of the bridge of his nose, John could literally feel his heart breaking all over again. It was a relieving and angering experience, all wrapped up into one, sudden burst of action.
“Sherlock, that’s starting to get a bit scary now.” John chuckled, visibly uncomfortable by the consuming stare Sherlock had been drilling into John’s forehead.
By now Sherlock was spitting blood onto the floor of the hallway, tilting his head back to stop the gush of blood coming from his nose. John stopped long enough to watch Sherlock’s face, to see him sitting helplessly on the floor despite John knowing that the other man knew how to fight back. Sherlock managed through the pain in the entirety of his face, to look at John, catch his eyes.
He sat up off of his mattress and ran his fingers through his mess of curls before rubbing his temples and swinging his legs out of bed. He padded across the room to pulled on his dressing gown. It was just barely four o’clock in the morning, and the emptiness of his flat made him swallow thickly and look towards the window. Knowing John was not sleeping fitfully up the stairs, and knowing that he rested comfortably beside Mary made his chest burn with a jealousy he had never known before in his entire life. He had always been the one to separate himself from his feelings, or any form of envy that he felt inside of him. Sherlock Holmes didn’t have time to feel envy for other people, especially not people in relationships. He always considered himself married to his work, but the loneliness that was creeping up his spine made him feel… vulnerable.
A small smile quirked at the edge of Sherlock’s lips and he bowed his head some. “I am sorry, again, John. For causing you so much pain, but Moriarty had to be stopped. He had to believe that he had won.”
“Sherlock, you clot.” He said, voice obviously breaking from some form of emotion. He had never heard Sherlock talk of him in such a high regard, even if a few of those things he spoke about could have been considered offensive. He knew Sherlock well enough to know he was trying impressively hard to make John understand that he appreciated him as a friend. It worked. Despite knowing in action, he could get used to Sherlock saying that he appreciated John, if nothing else came of the wedding day.
