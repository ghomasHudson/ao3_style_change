Tony himself is wearing two sweaters over his flannel PJs and Bruce is wearing the same, though his sweaters are obscured by the fact that the entire top half of his body is currently up the chimney.
Nick Fury doesn’t sleep. He waits. And unlike Charlie Sheen, it’s actually true. Because if Nick Fury actually let himself rest for more than two minutes, he’s sure that something somewhere would explode.
Steve’s lips quirk up into a sly grin, the one that no one outside of their immediate circle of friends even believes exists, and he drawls, “Maybe I wear it because it makes one person in particular drool at the sight of me.”
Pumpkin guts are sprawled out across the kitchen table, emptied onto sheets of newspaper, and the kitchen smells heavily of pulp. But other than that, there is no sign of what Steve’s doing. He isn’t joined by any of the others. It’s just Steve, doing something Steve something he’s always loved to do.
“You saw Director Fury in our kitchen wearing a frilly, pink apron?” Steve asks, practically laughing.
Steve is all Tony can see, and Tony is at peace as Steve continues to skate them gently backward. His expression is warm and impossibly fond and he doesn’t need to say a word but when he does all he says is “I love you.”
Nick Fury never expected that six extraordinary people would manage to downgrade him from highly lauded international super spy to highly underpaid babysitter.
It wasn’t until the house was clean of smoke and toaster remnants and Thor was settled at the kitchen table, happily eating the stack of plain non-toasted poptarts Fury had given him, that Fury noticed just how quiet the house was.
Steve seems to see through him though. He lurches forward and swipes the book out of Tony’s grasp. There’s a slight blush on his face that gives away his embarrassment through his façade of anger and it makes Tony even more curious.
“Well I couldn’t let those people die either!” Steve exclaims and Tony knows it’s going to be an argument if he pushes any further and he really doesn’t want to fight with Steve right now.  He falls down beside him on the bed and burrows his face into the blankets by Steve’s knee.
Tony doesn’t say anything right away, which is admittedly out of character for him, but it’s Valentine’s Day and Dean Martin is playing over the speakers and he’d at least like to maintain some level of romance. He does however shoot Steve a lingering side glance.
What’s worst is Tony’s unceasing interest in why Steve isn’t using his art supplies. Steve almost feels that every other action Tony’s made is all a part of his main goal, which is to badger Steve until he starts drawing or painting again.  It started the day after the Hitchcock marathon when Tony had come up to him in the kitchen and said, “Hey, are you sure that the storage lockers are the best place for you art supplies? It gets really humid down there in the summer.”
Tony’s head spins at the thought of it. It doesn’t matter that Steve isn’t his anymore. The thought of Steve looking at another man like that, being intimate enough to paint him like that, makes Tony see red.
“Know what, Stark?” Fury grinds out, voice already edging on furious. He wasn’t paid enough for this shit.
“Oh yeah?” Steve asks, putting down the book he had been reading and pulling the covers on Tony’s side of the bed back in an invitation to join him.  Tony takes the invitation without further explanation.
“So Nirvana was a band in the late 80’s and 90’s,” Steve says, looking up at the speakers. “And disco was a music and dance thing in the…?”
Fury let out a heavy sigh. This plan, as almost every plan that he made involving the Avengers, was a bust. He looked towards the clock and was almost tempted to sigh again when he realized all of this had only taken up a half an hour or so. Great. He wasn’t looking forward going back to HQ and getting his ear chewed off about how he can’t even handle his own team. And he’s pretty sure that if he hangs up on them one more time they might just take disciplinary action.
“So,” Tony says, sinking back into his chair. “Steve Rogers. Tell me something that’s not in the file. Something we can bond over.”
The lighting is dim, the only real light coming from the centerpieces, full of glittering stones and tea lights. But even in the dimness Steve spots the team sitting at a large, circular table, all of them focused on the same person. She’s sitting next to Bruce and smiling a large, happy smile even though Steve can tell even from halfway across the room that Nat and Clint are grilling the life out of her. Her hair is piled up on top of her head in a style that Steve hasn’t seen since before he was frozen and it automatically endears her to him. The feeling is only reaffirmed when Bruce, who looks like he’s about to break out into a cold sweat, presses a nervous hand into her lap and it doesn’t seem to faze her at all. She doesn’t break in her conversation with Clint and Natasha, only reaches one hand down to squeeze his reassuringly.
“Don’t get all cute on me now,” Tony says and he throws himself onto the bed beside Steve. He wiggles around like the giant cat that he is until he’s properly shoved the book out of Steve’s lap and situated himself there instead. Steve rolls his eyes in annoyance but he pulls Tony closer all the same.
“Sorry we’re late,” Tony says as they approach the table, seemingly over his grumbling. “Steve was getting a little handsy in the elevator.” But then again, no.
Coulson closes his eyes for a moment, turning over the words in his head for a moment before saying, “Say: Steve Rogers, I spent my entire childhood hearing stories about you. About how kind and strong and brave you are. But nothing prepared me for the real thing. You are the strongest, most compassionate soul on this earth and one of the only true heroes the world has ever seen. I admire and love every piece of you and cannot believe that I am the one you’ve chosen to spend your life with. I vow to always strive to be better for you. I vow to be there for you through every tough decision and every happy moment. And most of all, I vow to always love you, until the end of my days.”
He squints, cocks his head, and listens really hard but his brain is working on maybe ten percent efficiency right now and he just can’t. Somewhere in the back of his head he realizes that he needs to bring food back to his poor, bedridden boyfriend but his confusion overrules whatever concern he may have.
He calls the Avengers to assemble over the comm and they dispatch quickly. All except for two. He presses his finger to his ear piece, already thoroughly annoyed.
Tony lets out a sigh of relief that is just a touch too obvious judging by the way Steve looks at him like he’s suddenly sprouted three heads. “It’s so great,” he says, scrambling for a cover. “The Caravaggio, I mean.”
Tony smirks triumphantly when he notices Steve watching and turns towards him, propping his head up and leering in his direction.
Steve perks up adorably at the mention of being a husband and just says, “I’m not lying. I appreciate the effort even though it’s not your color.”
They’ve been doing this for almost two years now and this is just always how it’s been. They love each other for a million different reasons but Tony is still volatile, still sarcastic, still too biting and Steve is still stubborn, still just as sarcastic, and still too rigid at times and that’ll probably never change.
He drags Steve in the elevator with him and presses the button to a floor Steve hasn’t been to yet. At Steve’s questioning look Tony just tips his glass towards him in a mock-toast, takes another sip, and says “That’s something I can work with.”
When he returns three weeks later, he’s buried under so much paperwork that checking up on the team gets pushed to the back burner. He figures as long as there isn’t a national emergency or alien invasion and the team hasn’t killed each other, that they can handle themselves for a little while. But then of course, on the lucky fifth week of peace and quiet, some wiseass supervillian decides that it’s a great day to try and level Manhattan.
So they just stay at home in bed. The tower is one of the only buildings with power thanks to the arc reactor but they dim all the lights so as not to blind the good people of New York in the pitch darkness. Tony sends Steve upstairs to the roof with their trusty blanket and a ton of candles while he goes into the kitchen and puts together something for them to eat.
Steve trails off with a vague gesture in Thor’s direction and a noise that is somehow conveys both amusement and confusion.
“Are you sure? I know he’d love to see you,” Steve tries, an edge of desperation creeping into his voice.
“That had the potential to be quality entertainment for the rest of the night,” Clint grouses as Betty presses a single button and places the quiches down like they hadn’t been working on the fireplace for the past hour.
They stop in front of the door to the old office and Steve lets go of Tony’s hand to go to the knob. He turns back and says, “We were going to surprise you with this on Christmas Eve. But, I knew, and I think we all knew, that now that you put two and two together on the office that you would’ve snuck down here anyway.”
But they end up together on their roof just like they had the year before, legs tangled together beneath a blanket. Tony freaks out when they see the neon maracas are now accompanied by a neon burrito. When Steve tells Tony that he loves him Tony says it back, loud and proud, yelling it down to the street like a crazy man.
Clint finally pries off the chains from around his wrists and Tony brings his hands forward to rest over Steve’s on his cheeks. “I was worried for a second there that you’d give yourself over,” he whispers, eyes getting heavy from exhaustion. And blood loss too, probably.
“That’s beside the point. The point is that this morning Steve Rogers called me to say that Tony hadn’t been home in two days and I do not have a clue where he is. The last time I actually had no idea where he was he came back to me with an arc reactor in his chest and I know that you’ve had S.H.I.E.L.D tracking him ever since the almost-dying-birthday-party fiasco so I’d appreciate it if you’d find him for me,” she said, so panicked her words rushed together.
“So I asked the nurses and they said that she had died the day before,” he says and Tony’s heart breaks at how hard he’s trying to keep his voice steady. “They said it was in her sleep. Real peaceful. The funeral was this morning.”
Steve’s heart melts a little at Tony calling their little team a family and he catches himself staring down at him intensely, trying to determine whether Tony just said it to humor him or not. When Tony looks up at him with genuine suspicion in his eyes and says, “What? What’s with the sappy eyes? I feel like this has to be a trap being that you were just giving me disappointed Cap eyebrows a minute ago.”
“Yeah, but that doesn’t mean that I think it makes any sense,” Steve replies. “You have no business meddling in Bruce’s love life.”
“Excuse me?” he asks, still slightly groggy even though somewhere in the back of his mind he’s already placed the voice. “How did you even get this number?”
He levels Steve with a look and a nod, saying “Rogers,” before turning to were Tony lay, half awake from the commotion and curling into Steve’s side.
Clint takes a long sip of wine from his glass, seemingly oblivious as everyone else at the table stares at him for a moment. Betty, eyes glassy, is the first to say something with an enthusiastic “Well said!” that breaks the spell that had fallen over them. Tony blinks and takes a moment to clear his throat, which had become mysteriously clogged, before joining everyone in taking a drink.
Steve’s obviously teasing him and Tony falls right into his trap, grumbling “The man should’ve stayed dead if he was just going to come back to flirt with my boyfriend.”
There’s nothing but silence in the car for a while, Tony making it clear that he can’t bring himself to say any more for the night. He watches as Steve moves his hand to the radio and switches it on. He fiddles with the knob for a minute before Frank Sinatra’s voice comes through, a little fuzzy but there nonetheless.
He can see they’re uneasy and he slips into his Captain’s voice easily. It’s easier to be strictly professional anyway.
Tony opens his mouth and all that comes out is a slightly choked noise and Steve worries for a moment that he might have broken him. “Tony,” he begins, panic starting to settle in.
He looks up to see Natasha and Clint leaning on either side of his door frame. Clint looks sympathetic and Natasha looks absolutely murderous. He feels a little swell of affection for them but still frowns.
He surprisingly obeyed without a word. Fury guessed that Thor just assumed he was better versed in how to handle deadly toaster fumes that he was.
“Making sure I eat my veggies, Cap?” Tony says with an affectionate grin. He doesn’t know when they became this. Friends, he guesses.
“Hey, we’re still a team and I need you to act as such,” he says firmly. “I can’t have hostility getting in the way when we’re in battle. So leave any anger you may have about this at the door every morning. Tony’s not going anywhere.”
Steve jumps in shock when he closes the door behind him and turns to see Tony standing across the hall from him, silently looking at him with an unreadable look.
He shot the other agent a grin over his shoulder that Clint returned quickly, as if they were laughing at an inside joke.
Her gaze returns to his chest, lingering over his purple heart as she says it and Steve gives a gentle smile. “He served in Iraq?”
Tony plops himself down on the couch and frowns at how plain everything is. This room is so not Steve. It hurts that he ever thought this was an okay space for him. His eyes scan the room for a stitch of color, of personality, of
Tony turns his head back at that, raising a questioning eyebrow as the elevator dings and opens in front of him. Natasha doesn’t seem fazed. She just continues as usual.
Natasha doesn’t say anything. She just gives him another little grin and shrugs as she continues to lace up her shoes.
Steve’s crying. Tony’s crying. Tony can hear Betty crying from here. A quick glance out at the crowd shows that pretty much everyone is crying. Even Natasha seems to have shed a tear or two but Tony writes it off as sweat since he’s pretty sure that Natasha had her tear ducts removed as an infant.
Tony responses with a weak, “Mmhmm,” and Steve knows he’ll be asleep within the next minute of two so he just shakes his head, presses a kiss to the top of Tony’s head, picks his book back up, and settles in for a lazy morning.
They’ve done an awful lot in the past year. They’ve thrown themselves in the line of fire for one another, they’d laughed together, hugged and kissed, fucked and made love, but never had they said that to one another.
When Tony had agreed to this plan, the idea of Thor in ice skates hadn’t even been a glimmer of a thought in the far reaches of his mind. Seeing it right in front of his eyes is something that Tony is certain that he will never be able to wipe from his memory.
“I don’t know why I think this is a good idea every year,” Tony says even though he can’t deny that he’s reveling in the crisp air and the orange and red leaves all around his feet.
“Now you’re just lying to yourself,” Clint says lightly with his usual toothy, boyish grin. He doesn’t say anything else and Tony doesn’t fight back. He just grips his husband’s hand tighter and keeps on skating.
He turns on his heel and heads for the elevator up to his and Steve’s quarters, expecting Natasha to say her goodbyes and head out on her own. What he doesn’t expect is for Natasha to say, “I’m just going down the block to the grocery store. I think they don’t close until 12.”
“I’m devastated, I’m sure,” Steve replies flatly, never having been able to understand Tony’s fascination with all the fake press out there about them. “Tony, which brand of toothpaste is it that Thor likes again?” He looks down at the bottle of Crest suspiciously.
“What the hell are you doing?” Fury asks. “If you wanted to go on a drinking binge, couldn’t you have done it at home? Or at least somewhere where Potts could find you on her own?”
Fury rolls his eye. Of course. “Well, you know, I know Stark pretty well and while you might handle it that way I’m pretty sure he’d drink himself into a coma if he was in that situation.”
“Yep,” she says, popping her p with the sugary sweet satisfaction of someone who knows someone else is walking into a hilariously awkward situation. She swings her bag over her shoulder and walks right past him. She waves and wishes him good luck as she leaves.
Tony is still just looking at him, stricken and numb. His face is slack and he his eyes are clouded over and indecipherable.
“Because you left me!” Steve yells and Tony stumbles back a step, as if that’s the last answer that he expected. He looks at Steve with big, shocked eyes and Steve can’t bring himself to stop. It all comes pouring out of him at once. “Because it’s been three fucking months and I am still trying to pick up pieces of myself and it makes me feel stupid and pitiful and weak! Because I can’t look at that bench or even pick up a pencil or a brush without thinking about how much I still love you and how much it still hurts!”
“Yeah…” Tony knows he should have a smart retort up his sleeve but he can’t help but get lost in Steve’s carvings, which are slowly forming another new picture. He zones out just long enough to realize that the lines are coming together to form a black cat at the base of the tree and blurts out, “How?”
Steve notices Tony in his periphery, walking towards the bench he uses for still life pieces and stretching himself across it like a cat. Between the bright blue of the arc reactor against his shirtless chest and the way his pants roll down to reveal the V of his hips Steve can’t help but be distracted for a moment as Tony writhes on the bench.
Clint nods and says “Yeah, I’m good. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.” He grabs the glass in front of him before anyone else can comment any further.
“Maybe with fireplaces. But if that’s all, I think the world will somehow learn to survive with my vast knowledge physics and engineering alone,” Tony replies, following Steve’s lead to the nearest armchair.
And Steve, poor Steve. He looks absolutely mortified. “I’m so sorry, sir,” he rushes out. “When Tony muted JARVIS we had no idea-”
“C’mon, you. I need to hear about your day too.” She says it with such ease that Tony’s heart almost breaks. It’s been years and Tony’s still not entirely used to all this. But it warms him so thoroughly, he can’t bear to fight it or even choke out a sarcastic retort. He just takes her hand and follows his friends into the kitchen.
“Guys, I am actually standing right in front of you,” Tony says, defensively. “And he said yes so obviously it wasn’t that bad.”
“No, everything’s fine with the room,” Steve says tightly and Tony knows that everything is most definitely not fine.
“You have to admit this is a little weird, Tony,” Bruce says, trying to divert Tony with his soothing tones and logic. “This isn’t something we can help you with. Just tell him how much you love him. That’s all that matters.”
Steve had panicked when he’d seen Tony fall to floor. He’d been ready to scoop him up and carry him to the hospital in his pajamas. Luckily the team had been there to calm him down and get him to go change while they called an ambulance.
“Tony are you sure that this is best place to be introducing this girl to everybody?” Steve asks. He tries to keep his tone serious though it’s hard not to be distracted by the mirrors and crystal surrounding them in the small space of the elevator. “I can barely make it through these things in one piece and that’s without me having to meet four very…”
“It’s alright,” Nat says, moving to match Tony’s pace. “I don’t think anyone’s going to accuse us of stealing anything.”
And while Nat and Clint are slow to turn their heads back to the picnic blanket and move towards the food, Tony moves on before she even started speaking. He slouches toward Steve and is egged on by the easy, happy smile he receives for his approach.
“Tony!” Betty says happily, apparently completely unaware of his complete internal crisis. “I’m teaching the boys some yoga! I’m starting them off with the downward facing dog, what do you think?”
“Oh my god,” Tony says, his body flooding with relief as he rolls his eyes. “No, it’s not about the weird sex thing. However, if you ever want to revisit that conversation-”
“He’s one of my good friends and the only one in this tower that isn’t getting any,” Tony argues. “I think that it’s my obligation to help him out here. And I met this professor at the Baruch commencement ceremony last summer you know, the one who made all the cookies I brought home?”
He eventually finds them in Stark’s bedroom and he’s extremely disappointed in himself when he realizes that he isn’t immediately appalled.
“So,” Tony says, pouring out drinks for the two of them. “You’re probably wondering why I called you up here.”
Their Thursday movie nights turn into a team event instead of a date. Clint pulls through on his promise and gets Steve a giant painting of a half-naked man staring lustily out at the viewer. He can see Steve is hesitant so he bolts it into the wall above Steve’s bed with SHIELD tested screws. They finally get Dr. Doom behind bars. He escapes. They get him again. Summer settles in. Betty drags them all to the beach Steve ignores the heat of Tony’s stare on his back as he, Nat, Clint, and Betty play chicken. They have a small party for his birthday. Tony gives him an awkward hug and a set of paint brushes. Steve doesn’t tell him that his supplies are still rotting away in his storage locker. He just smiles a stiff smile and thanks him. He starts visiting Peggy again more regularly, making a habit of bringing her fresh flowers every week. They finally give him a real office at SHIELD HQ and he pours more effort into his extra projects. In late July the team watches as Steve does the media circuit to publicize the new bill he’s helping to push through Congress to decrease wait times at the VA. There’s another, only slightly less awkward hug, when the bill gets pushed through.
“I’m really not. I’m always going to childish and stubborn. I’m always going to have a temper and I’m always going to be insecure. But I’m smart enough to know a good thing when I see it and Steve you are the
Steve smiles, a big beautiful excited smile, and it chases the last of Tony’s nerves away. Steve opens the door and reaches in to turn on the light. “Merry Christmas, Tony,” he says before finally moving aside so that Tony can walk into the room.
a walking, talking American flag. Cap was…” He hesitates, not sure if this is too deep, too weird to share with a man he’s not even sure he really likes. “Cap was someone I became to do what Steve Rogers always wanted to do. What I still want to do.”
“Nah,” Steve says, voice still rough with sleep, as he gathers up his art supplies. “I’m going up to bed. But I’m coming back down here in the morning and if you’re still down here I’m going resort to drastic measures.”
“Yeah, it was amazing, in fact write it down before you go,” Tony says, his possessive streak flaring to life like never before. “It’s just that things got a little too real for a moment there, bud.”
Her words carry a heavy weight and Steve feels guilt pool in his stomach. He couldn’t stand it if he was driving wedge that drove a friendship apart. He’d lost too many of his own friends to let that happen.
Pepper gives him a thoughtful look after he runs his fingers through his hair for the billionth time. She must think of something good because all she does is smile.
Until the credits start to roll and Clint says, “Besides, it’s clear why Cap is so defensive. He is basically Jack Dawson.”
“Tony, don’t look at me like that,” Steve pleads. “I had to do it. And the doctor said I’ll be fine. I won’t even need skin grafts thanks to the serum. Just rest and fresh bandages twice a day.”
The hospital is dimly lit and loud as ever. It reeks of antiseptic and anxiety and the hundreds of crappy reproductions of Impressionist masterpieces make Steve want to puke more than they soothe him. But Pepper sits in the midst of the chaos looking surer than ever about Steve’s fate with her
hater, Stark,” Clint remarks from the other side of Steve. He and Thor are sitting beside Steve and Tony doesn’t even know why they’re there. The only reasons he can think of are that they either really enjoy chewing popcorn like they’re masticating cows or love cockblocking Tony and his new boyfriend. Probably both.
“It’s perfect,” Steve says. “But I’d like to wear it as my wedding ring too. You okay with me not wearing a ring until then?”
“Obviously you can’t if you willingly paid money to watch a film that had the words Abraham Lincoln and Vampire Hunter in the title. At least let me show you some decent movies,” Tony counters, almost breaking the playful mood with how deathly serious he is about correcting Steve’s cinematic wrongs.
“What are you, Dr. Seven PhDs? An idiot?” They’re laughing as Tony leans over and makes the move for Steve, displaying as always his knack for listening.
Tony’s propped up on a mound of pillows on his bed. His eyes are soft and his hair askew. Steve expects him to say no outright or at the very least deflect with jokes until Steve gives up.
“I’m joking, I’m joking,” Tony says, trying to smooth out the situation again. He even shelves his joke about penis pumps and everything. He lifts his hand up to wipe a piece of lettuce away from the corner of Steve’s face in the hopes of distracting him and says, “Suffice it to say, my question was not about the weird sex thing.”
“All for the best.” Steve coughs, clearing his throat of any lingering huskiness. “Last time I kissed you in a public elevator the press had a field day.”
When the S.H.I.E.L.D higher-ups had first appointed him the head of the Avengers initiative, Nick Fury had never thought it’d boil down to this.  All the job description said was to give them orders and get their asses into gear. He’d always known Stark would be a pain, but he’d never expected it to be like this.
After he drops Tony back at the mansion, he doesn’t hear or see from any of the Avengers or their friends for about a month. It’s not that he doesn’t care, as much as he doesn’t have time. Almost immediately after the hotel incident, he’s called away on a mission in the Peruvian Andes and has no contact with anyone outside of his team.
“This year was wonderful,” Betty remarks as they enter the last two minutes of 2020, laying half-asleep across Bruce’s chest.
stand down,” he says the words firmly, but his voice is barely above a whisper. He realizes too late that he sounds more like a father figure than a figure of authority. “You stand the fuck down. You understand me?”
There’s no way that there’s a version of me that isn’t ass over elbows for you.” His words sound so earnest, so real that Steve can hardly take it.
Steve looks up at him and there’s a tiny grin on his face and affection in his eyes, which only makes Fury slightly uncomfortable. “Yes, sir.”
They both turn towards the screen for a moment to watch as Jack sweeps Rose up into his arms and kisses her to Celine Dion’s crooning. It’s a soft, quiet moment. The air smells like salt and butter and Thor is sniffling and murmuring something about how sweet it all is. The tension is forgotten.
“Yeah,” Tony says, rubbing a stained hand across his face. “Just trying to get the specs just right on the arc reactor for SHIELD HQ. I figure that if I get it right the first time around it’ll give Fury less cause to be on my ass about it all the time. “
“What?” Tony exclaims, highly perturbed by Steve’s answer. “What? Is there not enough room in here or something? Do the windows not give you enough light?”
Tony comes to bed on day six. Their bedroom is dark except for the light from the lamp on Steve’s nightstand and Tony looks haggard and weak in the dimness. Most of all he looks devastatingly sad and it frightens Steve. Steve has seen Tony look a lot of things – infuriated, disappointed, hurt – but never sad. His body goes numb with panic.
They’ve always been the fire in each other’s veins and that hadn’t changed as they had morphed from annoyances to teammates to friends to partners. All it did was fuel different emotions. Instead of focusing all of that heat into well-crafted barbs, they poured it into biting, bruising kisses.
But then again he doesn’t smile like this at Bruce. There’s no gentle teasing when it’s Clint’s turn to come down and make sure he hasn’t science-d himself to death.
Tony hesitates. Because even this warm, happy, toe-flexing Steve is still unnervingly perfect and Tony doesn’t want to point out how decidedly bad he is at this by ruining his pumpkin.
And just as quickly as that moment came, it’s gone again when Tony bursts into a screechy, off key version of “Endless Love” and Clint starts laughing so hard Steve’s actually concerned that he might hurt himself.
Their anniversary is in November and it really is a little too cold to be doing this. But between Steve’s abnormal body heat and their blanket they can make it work.
On their third anniversary they go on a picnic in the park, just like the one that kicked off their entire relationship.
“They cut off your suit but it’s garbage now anyway,” Tony replies, not sure how to respond. “Coulson’s probably already ordered a new one though.”
Tony knows Steve can hear him walk up behind him even though he doesn’t say a word. He just looks over his shoulder and watches as he continues to make short, curved strokes that somehow eventually make a spindly old tree, surrounded by bats. He could watch forever and still, with all of his intellect, never be able to mimic this.
“Really?” Steve says, unimpressed as he sways to the beat. “After all these years trying to impress you.”
“Oh yeah,” Tony says, trying to keep in a hiss of pain. “I think I overdid it when we were sparring the other day. Must’ve pulled something.”
He laughs and laughs until his vision swims and his belly hurts, Clint and even Natasha not too far behind. When they finally all collect themselves, wiping tears from their eyes, Natasha just shrugs and says “Fine cake, you win. We’ll just put enough candles on it that he’ll never notice.”
Tony just brings his other hand to Steve’s face as well. He holds him tightly, grounding him in the moment, as Tony’s face turns determined and resolute. “No. Everything’s going to change, Steve.” His voice is clear and sharp and leaves no room for arguments. “Steve, this is me apologizing for ending things between us. I’m sorry I didn’t fight for us. I’m sorry that I caused you pain. Believe me when I say that it nearly killed me to do it. And now this is me, saying that I need you,” Tony’s throat audibly clicks as he swallows. “And that I’ll probably screw up again but I’ll sure as hell never let you go and if there’s any way that you could ever take me back after how enormously I screwed up,
Looking at Natasha, waiting for him expectantly in the elevator, Tony can safely say that today is not that day. But the surprise makes the warmth of the gesture all the sweeter.
“I know you do,” Tony says, the fight and the heat having left him completely. Now he just looks lost and sad. “But that’s the problem. We’re destroying each other, Steve.”
“Okay, so about that, killing me would only make Cap more pissed than he already is and he’s already at rip your face off levels of anger so that would be a pretty bad move on your part.” And if it is one thing that he regrets about this whole thing it’s the panicked look that had flashed across Steve’s face when M.O.D.O.K had hacked into the tower’s systems and had a little video chat with the team earlier.
Tony wants to look at them at least, but he can’t tear his gaze away from the piano. He runs his hands over the keys reverently. “And you bought it for me. To have back. Permanently. For Christmas.”
“Birdbrain,” Tony mutters as he scans the rest of the article, snorting as he glosses over the details. “You should hear what your reaction to it has been.”
“Hardy har har,” Tony responds, half-hearted at best. He pokes at the logs at the base of the fireplace dejectedly. “Just because you can’t appreciate my application of the scientific method doesn’t mean that we aren’t going to get this done.”At this point, not one single person is bothering to suppress their laughter and Anderson Cooper’s live coverage of Times Square has been long forgotten. The common room is dark and cool, the only light coming from the TV flashing between the ball waiting to drop and the poor freezing tourists. Nat and Clint are pressed together, shoulder to knee, on the loveseat beneath an impressive mound of blankets while Steve and Thor sit on the couch in their t shirts and thin cotton pajama pants like it isn’t thirteen degrees outside.
He didn’t expect to walk in on Barton doing his target practice with a bullseye right above where Banner sat reading.
“C’mon,” Clint says with an eye roll, as if it’s obvious. “Artist. Scrappy, back-alley kid turned hero. Freezes in the ocean making the ultimate sacrifice. The parallels are uncanny.”
“I’m here because the team’s here. The fact that you own the building means absolutely nothing to me.”
But instead he found himself walking through the empty halls of the S.H.I.E.L.D infirmary. He figures that it had been long enough that there shouldn’t be any more visitors. He didn’t want to do this with anyone else around. It didn’t seem right.
This time ten years ago Tony had been in a Tom Ford suit, at a gala that cost more per plate than most make in a year, smooth talking a professional tennis player. But as he watches the soot roll down Bruce’s pant leg – navy blue fleece with tiny grey atoms – and gives up his pride in favor of chuckling at himself, he wonders if his past self would have even believed how much better this all is.
He charges upstairs the second he’s pulled enough badges to force Stark’s room number from the poor info desk girl. She gives him a key but he kicks down the door anyway simply because it’s 4 AM on the first Saturday morning he’s had off in months and he’s here.
“Really?” Tony yells, struggling against the restraints. The blade in his shoulder stings when he moves and the barrel of the gun digs further into his skull but he doesn’t even care. “You can’t even fight fair, you fucking ass?”
Bruce’s head popped up at the mention of his name, brows furrowed. He understood Fury’s appalled tone once he saw the look he was shooting at his teammate.
“Uhhh….” Tony trails off into awkward silence. It’s quiet except for the clinking of the ice in their glasses.
It takes Steve a moment to compose himself enough to even open his mouth, and honestly, Tony can’t even blame him. Thor’s skating ability is on par with a newborn baby deer fumbling its way through the forest for the first time. He wobbles with such vigor that he resembles jello more than any sort of demigod. And Tony thought the shameless photos of him and Steve on a Valentine’s date at a public ice rink would be bad. From what Tony can see while taking laps around the rink, there are at least twenty-seven people with their phones trained solely on the mess of limbs in front of them.
“Okay, okay, I got the hint,” Tony says, setting the magazine aside to hand Steve the bananas as well as some other fruits and vegetables. “I hope you know that I’m highly offended on your behalf that they seem to think that you would lower your standards enough to sleep with
“Betty Schaer,” she says in return. Her smile is still in place but she seems far away for a moment as if she’s looking at Steve but seeing through him at the same time. He doesn’t question it though he does start to fidget a bit when her gaze wanders down to the medals on his chest.
He hadn’t expected Tony to be there, sprawled across him and clutching him in his sleep while Steve ran his fingers through his hair, but he isn’t surprised either. He’d heard Tony’s anguished screams through the comm earlier, when they’d all thought the worst. He doubted anyone had the heart to deny him this.
“Bruce, I think the stupid thing’s defective,” Tony says, tapping at the base of the fireplace with a wrench from his open toolkit. “I’ll design a better one in the morni-“
Tony glances around their empty apartment confused, scanning every corner of the room for any sign of Steve. “She was making cookies so I guess it wasn’t that bad,” Tony says just for the noise, just to distract from the devastating silence that’s starting to make Tony panic a little. “Still rather kiss you.”
“Just making sure you’re alright,” Tony replies, trying to tamp down on any tenderness that may throw Steve off. His hands twitch to reach out and brush across his lip. “You got shuffled off to the infirmary right away so I didn’t get to make sure you were okay.”
Steve was absolutely fuming. Why couldn’t Tony leave well enough alone? Why did he feel it necessary to rip into Steve’s barely healed wounds like it meant nothing?
Eventually Tony’s arms go heavy and the calluses on his fingers start to crack and bleed and he physically has to turn away from his work. He turns to look at Steve to see that he’s barely awake, fingers dragging his pencil back and forth blindly as his eyes become heavier and heavier.
Once he’s settled he lays his head back on Steve’s shoulder and says “I think I just saw Nick Fury. Teaching Thor how to use a toaster. In an apron.”
He flips from page to page and all there is are lists and lists of random phrases and things and people ranging from YOLO to Bill Nye the Science Guy to hair bands. He flips and flips, searching for some rhyme or reason before finally blurting out, “Should I be worried that you’ve gone insane?”
Steve lets out a shuddering breath and grips Tony’s wrists tightly, painfully. “You said that we were
They aren’t naked or anything, but Tony’s got Steve pinned against the wall and they’re going at each other like a couple of horny teenagers with tongues down each other’s throats and writhing in a way that Fury never really wanted to know either were capable of.
“I hope so,” Tony responds, completely genuine. “I can’t help but feel like it was an outlier. But I guess I can hope.”
Steve’s choking on his own spit when a nurse comes over and touches his elbow gently. She leans in and says, “I’m sorry to interrupt Captain Rogers but we need to look him over one last time before we send him to his room. You have to go but we’ll be taking him up to the private suite on the ninth floor soon.”
Steve huffs a laugh and looks at Tony scrunching his nose up in the way he always does when he’s putting on a show over how annoyed he is.
“Takes one to know one, my love,” Steve whispers softly and so tenderly that Tony can’t help but get up and kiss him. Steve’s shoulders are sandy and his lips taste salty from their earlier romp through the water and Tony loves every second of it.
The second time he paid a visit to the tower, it was actually to talk with the team about Avengers business. They all needed to have a serious chat about the massive amounts of property damage they managed to inflict every time they went out into battle. If he got one more seven figure bill from Bloomberg’s office S.H.I.E.L.D might just go bankrupt and he might just have to kill somebody.
“Well, then why aren’t you painting? I don’t even see a sketchpad around here. Have you not been doing any art at all?”
Tony outright snorts at that. “Oh really? Can I record that for when I’m being decidedly not perfect?”
“Okay,” Steve agrees easily enough, kissing the fingers covering his mouth. Tony’s heart melts and he only keeps himself from tackling Steve right then and there by pushing Steve’s hair out of his face and running his hand down the side of his face.
,” Tony says, his tone as close to a verbal eye roll as possible. “I understand the movie’s cultural importance and all that. But the ending is just stupid. There was more than enough room for Jack to get on with her and not sink it. I’ve done the science, guys. It’s simple physics.”
When everyone is done singing, Tony leans down and whispers into Steve’s ear, “Make a wish, sweetheart.”
Steve fumbles again, becoming more and more frustrated before spitting out. “Well how about you? Don’t you have any topics of conversation, Mr. Genius?”
He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself even though he didn’t really relax until he finally saw Captain America’s blue and red uniform flash across the screen.
“A week or so after Steve moved in,” she said, with a rare grin. “Once they stopped sniping at each other every five seconds, they found out that they have the same taste in movies. They’ve been pretty tolerant of each other since then. Even friendly.”
“Yeah, think of the pies Tony,” Bruce agrees, a joking edge in his voice even though he’s smiling warmly at Betty. “And the tarts and the turnovers and the apple crisps.”
“You’ve been stripped of your defenses Captain America,” M.O.D.O.K squeals into his microphone. “And I assure you that my men outnumber you alone in droves. Surrender yourself so that I can use my superior intellect to decode the mystery of Erskine’s formula or Stark dies!”
“Yeah, but we don’t just fight,” Tony says, finally meeting Steve’s gaze. His words are harsh and fiery and he fixes Steve with a heated look. “We tear into one another. We never stay on topic. It always gets personal. Always turns into the same fight.”
When all the men are down Steve rushes over to Tony, cradling his head in his hands and looking worriedly at the pool of blood beneath him. Thor quickly rights the chair so that Tony isn’t bleeding out onto the concrete as Clint gets to work on the chains around his wrists and Natasha works on his ankles.
Fury didn’t realize the extent of how wrong he was until he decided to drop in for a visit. Nothing S.H.I.E.L.D related, just coming around to say hi. And to make sure that Steve hadn’t murdered Tony.
He hasn’t worried like this in a long time. It’s a clawing kind of feeling that makes him shake all over. And Steve knows that he’s had
Tony smiles back if only because Steve’s amusement is contagious. He pulls Steve’s hand in his up to his mouth for a kiss before saying, “Now darling, we all have our strengths.”
“Director Fury!” he yelled, “The infernal Midguardian device known as a ‘toaster’ has tried to kill me!”
“Okay, so, 1945,” Tony muses aloud, scratching his beard absentmindedly in thought. “What would I know from 1945?” He pauses. “Movies! What was the last movie you saw in the theater?”
the entire way for show. He figures that if Tony can make a show of hemming and hawing over Steve’s list, Steve can make a show of his “annoyance.”
But otherwise this New Year’s Eve is the same as the last. Everyone is cozy in their PJs. Steve is warm at Tony’s side and Anderson Cooper is back at it again.
Betty usually does join him for whatever movie is on AMC that night though. She usually comes to visit a few times a week and things between her and Bruce seem to be going well. It’s nice to see their relationship coming together even when Steve has yet to wake up without feeling the dull hollow ache of loss in his chest. It’s even nicer to have found a new friend in her.
“Yep. You are.” Steve says it dryly enough but it’s quickly followed by laughter. Tony elbows him for good measure but he can’t help but laugh too. Steve presses a kiss to his shoulder in return and Tony finds his resolve crumbling.
“But I really want to,” Steve grumbles. His voice is still gravelly but impossibly fond. Tony knows that if he turns his head he’ll meet a pair of warm, besotted eyes to match that tone.
Maybe that’s why he’s so worried. Maybe he’s frightened that something might happen to one of them before they can actually do something about all of this. Maybe he’s scared that he’ll never be able to take Tony out to dinner and hold all the doors open for him and pull out his chair and let Tony make fun of him for it for the entire night.
Tony isn’t one for sappy words and Steve never wanted to push. He knows how he feels about Tony and he knows how Tony feels about him. It’s clear in the way he looks at Steve, the way he holds him and the way his lips curl around his name.  He hadn’t ever needed to hear it but all of sudden he felt a need to express it, to tell Tony, to shout it out loud to everyone.
He tries not to think about it as Steve shakes his head, returning his grin with a fond one of his own, and says “Lots of inspiration down here. That’s all.”
Tony pulls his arm out from behind Steve to look him dead in the eye. “Steve, sweetie,” he says as plainly as possible. “If we were ever trapped floating in the Atlantic and I put you on a piece of debris and then didn’t get on it with you or find myself another one or even suggest we take turns, wouldn’t you think I was a colossal idiot?”
Fury took one more look at the smashed remants on the floor and Thor’s flailing arms that were just about to smash Mjolnir down onto the poor, broken contraption before he yelled, “Just what is going on here?”
But it doesn’t and the last words Steve hears as he leaves the recovery room are, “I’ll be talking to this other,
“Now see, this is where this movie just gets stupid,” Tony scoffs. Steve is settled against his side and is absolutely riveted to the screen. His back is warm against Tony’s arm, his lips are parted, and his eyes are big and glassy white-blue in the darkness of the movie room. It’s almost enough to distract Tony. Almost.
“It isn’t poisonous,” he finally replied, voice sharp. His eyes wandered over to the place on the counter where the toaster once sat. He hadn’t lied about ripping it from the wall. There was a large hole where the electrical socket used to be. Fury’s hands curled into fists.
He’s at the door in an instant, practically throwing himself on the knob and flinging himself inside. “What’s the matter? Are you hu-?”
Tony looks taken aback, putting up his hands in defense, before saying, “Hey, I was just trying to do something nice for you! You used to love sitting on that bench for hours, it was one of the only things that used to be able to relax you!”
“Ice cream,” she says simply. “And I was going to come down to the workshop to ask if you wanted to come with me. But now you’re here so, let’s go.” And without further ado, she walks right past Tony into the waiting elevator and hits the button for the ground floor.
Tony looks down and realizes that his hand that isn’t in Steve’s is clenched in a fist at his side. He unfolds his fingers slowly. He knows that they’re not going to hurt him. He trusts them all. But there is something decidedly weird about all of this.
Natasha tells him to hush with a single gesture, her hand cutting through the air. “I think I can fix it,” she murmurs.
Tony knows that that’s probably his cue to leave but between his empty bed and the absolute pin drop silence of the tower lately, he’s in no rush to try and sleep. Instead, he takes in the darkness of the room and peeks down at his watch for the time.
Tony turns his face towards Steve and lifts his hazy gaze up to look at him. When Tony’s eyes land on his face they light up like Steve’s the best thing he’s ever seen and it makes Steve’s heart stutter in its place.
Steve sighed, his eyes darting down to where Tony laid dozing on his shoulder. “Every time I close my eyes I hear-”
Tony interrupts him before he can go any further, turning his eyes up to meet Steve’s and taking his breath away. He reaches a hand up to curve around Steve’s jaw and says, “All of my life, whether they meant to or not, everyone close to me has always made me feel like I wasn’t…” He pauses, trying to think of the right word, before settling on “
They come back to their roof like they always do once the sun’s set. Winter’s settled in early this year and it’s starting to snow a little so they can’t stay out too long. But they still look down at the lights of the city together like they always do. Tony squawks in protest when he sees the neon maracas and burrito are gone and replaced by a simple CURRY & VINDALOO sign. Steve tells him that he loves him. Tony says that he loves him too.
“If you came here for a reason, please feel welcome to stay until the others return,” he said, in the oddly genuine manner only Thor could pull off. “Come now, take a seat.”
“You guys have really done it this time,” Clint remarks on day four of the lockout. And Steve’s stomach drops at the thought that he really has.
His heart still skips a beat when he sees Steve smile broadly, eyes dancing in the candle light, before blowing out the candles to the sound of everyone’s happy cheers.
“Oh.” Tony looks down at the little book poking out of Steve’s pocket with a blank look, totally deflated now that his insanity hypothesis has been thwarted. He perks up again when Steve’s words finally settle in his brain. “Wait! Isn’t this something I should know about as your 21
Even after all these years, sometimes Tony is still overwhelmed by what the world sees when they look at his husband. A living legend, a war hero, the man who flew a jet into the ocean to save the world and woke up seventy years later just to do it again. Sometimes people look at Steve like they look at Thor. Like he’s otherworldly, set above and apart from them.
“Yeah,” Tony says and turns on his heel. Steve looks back at his paperwork, tension already weighing down his shoulders again.
With the amount of time Tony had imagined the awful things that had happened to it, it’s almost the biggest shock to see it all in one piece. He walks forward stiffly and runs his hands over the edge of it reverently. He finds the notch in the wood where he had tripped and dented it when he was seven. He sits down on the bench and realizes that even this is the original as he finds the stain in the leather he had made when he accidentally laid a hand down on it while it was still dirty with motor oil.
She just smiles reassuringly at him. “Don’t be embarrassed. Every army brat’s grown up with those movies.”
Tony lets out a bark of laughter again, only this time it’s far more bitter. “Relationships. Monogamy. Swooning and cheesy dates and flowers and chocolates and-” he pauses to take another sip, before spitting out the final word. “
?” Tony asks, incredulous. Neither Clint nor Natasha jump, clearly having heard him come in. But nobody can tear their eyes away from the cake in front of them. “Really Clint?”
“Orange,” Steve replies, settling back into his seat slowly. He’s still unsure about this whole thing.
It had been a really simple procedure to fix some torn cartilage in Tony’s knee. It had been done in fifteen minutes and only left two small incisions on his knee. But the doctors had needed to put him under anesthesia anyway so…
“What?” Steve’s voice is small and confused and almost a shock to Tony as he hasn’t said a word since Tony put on the movie three hours ago. He knows that Steve’s become a master at selectively tuning out everyone’s banter, especially when he wants to focus on one thing in particular.
“I’m fifty,” he murmurs, letting the words settle over him. In some ways he feels unbearably old. But in others he doesn’t know where all that time went to.
“Didn’t we all,” Steve murmurs, completely immersed in the movie. Tony’s eyes nearly bug out of his head at Steve’s unfiltered confession. He spends a good five minutes imagining pre-serum Steve drooling over Walter Burns in the theater while Steve remains engrossed.
The way Tony looked right before he spotted his favorite director and promptly rolled his eyes. He had been smiling, actually smiling like he meant it. It wasn’t a shit eating grin, or an I’m-better-than-you-smirk, or even the leer reserved especially for schmoozing. No he was actually wearing a happy smile as he looked up into the face of none other than one Captain Steve Rogers, whose pursed lips and sparkling eyes obviously said
Steve feels the tension creeping back into his shoulders the more he thinks about it. He lets out a deep breath and focuses back in on Tony who is looking around his office like it’s torture chamber.
“It’s vibranium,” Tony explains as he crawls back into bed beside Steve. “Just like your shield. The old man had a couple of scraps hidden away in the workshop that I was saving for a special occasion. I wanted it to be your wedding ring but it’ll do. Especially since it’s virtually indestructible and you don’t know the definition of pushing your limits.”
He didn’t hear her coming down the hall until she spoke. It was the only fact about this situation he wasn’t surprised about.
A pleasant breeze blows through the park and Steve sneaks his arm around Tony’s waist, pressing a kiss to his temple and whispering his thanks before going back to the game. Natasha comes to observe and drops a plate of food on his knee. And while Tony knows that it’ll likely only be hours before they’ll have to deal with the fallout of what’s happening in the gazebo, he can’t help but feel perfectly content.
Tony groans and takes his hand out of Steve’s to slap it over Steve’s smiling mouth before he can continue any further. “Please dear God, never use those words again.”
“You had an outfit change?” Steve asks. Tony’s switched out his tux for a more relaxed button up top and some slacks.
“Excuse me!” he screams and they break apart so quickly it’s comical. Fury is almost disappointed that he’s so angry that he can’t properly revel in Stark’s deer in the headlights look.
So, they fight. They fight a lot. They fight over battle plans and alcohol and carelessness. But they also fight about date plans and kisses and the last piece of toast too. They always make up though and (with the exception of those three weeks about two months ago after Tony had come home stinking of whiskey and Steve had outright refused to even look at him until he agreed to go to therapy) the longer their relationship goes on the shorter the turnaround time gets.
Steve’s knee jerk reaction is that he should move back to Brooklyn but he knows that he can’t abandon his team. Tony tells him that he can stay in their quarters and that he’ll move into one of the guest suites during a stilted conversation a few days after they’ve broken up. Steve doesn’t accept the offer simply because it just isn’t fair. That was Tony’s room before and it should be his room after.
Steve’s honestly grateful for the out. He’s not sure he could take post-anesthesia Tony wrecking his emotions for much longer. He pulls away from Tony, even as he whines and fusses as the nurses try to take his pulse.
Tony looks around and notices that it’s a pretty typical morning at the tower. The kitchen smells like coffee and pineapple from the fruit salad Bruce is making. Everyone else is crowded around the kitchen table, reading the paper or munching on toast or cereal. Nothing seems out of place.
“What?” Steve asks, turning away from the stove with a look of bewilderment. When he spots the book in Tony’s hands he immediately pats down his back pocket, glaring at Tony when he finds it empty.
“C’mon fellow dork,” Tony says, getting up and pulling on Steve’s hand in an effort to get him to follow. “Between my PhDs and your tactical knowledge, I think we can build a pretty solid sand castle. What do you say?”
Tony swivels his head to see Betty, holding a plate of mini quiches and staring at them with a look that some would call piteous. He can hear Steve’s sharp spike of laughter as his face falls and Bruce plops out onto the floor beside him with a simple “Oh.” Clint groans in disappointment.
“So it’s gone?” Steve sounds like he’s on the brink of tears and Tony wants to hug him but is afraid to even touch him, to dislodge something vital or cause him pain. Tony just nods and squeezes Steve’s knee as comfortingly as possible.
Somewhere in the back of his mind, a voice that sounds suspiciously like someone he used to know, pops up and says tauntingly,
He frowns, but answers the question anyway. “I’d be devastated,” he says plainly. “But I couldn’t blame him for doing the right thing.”
He sits down and takes the carving knife slowly, afraid that if he seems too eager Steve might just figure out how bad of an idea this is. Apparently it works because Steve just wraps an arm around Tony’s waist to secure him in place and points to a spot to the left of the spindly tree.
As per usual, Steve has to fight back the impulse to crawl into a corner and die of embarrassment at the mention of his time selling war bonds. He expresses his flattery as best he can, stuttering a little around his words of thanks.
Tony cuts his gaze to the side to find that Natasha and Clint are carrying at least five bags of apples between them. Steve and Bruce are flanking Betty at a nearby Granny Smith tree. Steve is carrying what is easily ten pounds of apples without breaking a sweat. Bruce is holding open another bag while Betty keeps adding to the pile.
“We were about to send a search party out for you,” Bruce says as Clint settles into his place at the table. “Everything okay?”
And it looks like the question shocks Steve nearly as much as it shocks Fury. A blush forms high in his cheeks as his gaze darts away from the director. “Of course I do.”
But then he takes Tony’s hand in his, guides the knife into place, and he whispers “I’ve got you.” And that’s all Tony needs to hear.
“Oh my god,” Tony groans with a laugh as Steve stalks up the stairs towards the door. He’s batting stray popcorn out of his hair the whole way. “You do! That is precious.”
“Oh, yes you are,” she says, going back to fiddling with her planner. “It may not be official yet and neither one of you might’ve said it out loud but it’s there.”
It’s a little stupid and it’s corny but it makes Steve smile. It’s the first time he’s felt like a part of not a team, not an organization, but a
“He didn’t do anything wrong,” he says and it’s the truth. “I was out of bounds. He had a right to dump me.”
There’s a slight stutter in Tony’s breath and Steve can feel Tony’s hand trailing lower. “If only everyone knew how absolutely
Tony starts when he first sees her, not expecting anyone to be up and on the common floor. It's been quiet in the tower with Steve and Clint away on SHIELD business in DC and Thor in New Mexico trying to win back Jane.  Tony is getting used to crawling up from his workshop at odd hours without hearing from anyone.
Despite the awkwardness, Tony can’t help but feel pleasantly warmed all over, especially when he catches a glimpse of his husband, chatting happily to Bruce. He’s already managed to get grass stains on his khakis and he’s wearing a denim shirt so old and worn that he’s had to patch it twice already but he’s as frustratingly beautiful as he always is.
Steve looks just as soft and just as adoring as Tony anticipated, and he can’t help but melt into the sheets. They say nothing for a moment, just taking one another in. Tony raises his hand to Steve’s face and traces his fingers across his cheekbone, over his ear, and around his jaw to his lips. Steve waits a beat, kisses the fingers hovering over his lips softly, and then says “Can I say it now?”
“It was so stupid, Tony. I could feel Abraham Lincoln rolling in his grave. I don’t think I’m prepared for 21
Tony’s face doesn’t really show any real signs of recognition but he lets out a soft little ‘oh’ and walks out the door anyway. Everything seems pretty normal until he reaches the kitchen.
Tony’s heart sinks. He knows where this is going but he stays where he is and just nods. “Go on,” he says, gently encouraging Steve to continue.
“See, now that’s interesting,” Tony says with a large grin, leaning in close to get a better look at Steve across the table from him. “In a surprising way. I would’ve guessed red, white, or blue.”
“I don’t know,” Steve says, shrugging and avoiding Tony’s eyes when he backs out of their hug. “I guess, I just don’t want anyone thinking that I mourn that part of my life, you know? I’m happy here with the team. With you.”
Really, it’s as good as Tony could hope for their wedding to go. Besides, he knows Steve won’t care at the end of the day. Because if it’s one thing that Steve understands about Tony, it’s his stubbornness to never let a good joke die and his snark in the face of opposition.
in spandex and leather always knew just how to get to him. He couldn’t even take a deep breath thanks to this mess.
“Director, please,” she begged quickly before he could end the call. “I wouldn’t have called unless there weren’t any other options.”
Not to say that there weren’t still barbs. Because as much as they love each other, as much as they admire each other, on a fundamental level Steve and Tony are two very different types of people. They’ve learned, they’ve loved, and they’ve changed but that same tension between cynical humor and optimistic dedication – the very spark that started it all - is still there.
The world doesn’t collapse. Nothing bursts into flames. No one declares their undying hatred for Tony and leaves him alone to die.
His words are far from innocent but the way he snuffles into the side of Steve’s neck is adorable and pulls on Steve’s heartstrings like nothing else. Between the sentimentality of it being their anniversary and Tony’s nuzzles, Steve can feel the emotion plugging up his throat. He grabs Tony’s hands tighter beneath their cocoon in an effort to keep his mouth shut, to bottle neck all the sappy words that want to come pouring out.
Tony puts on a dark blue shirt and makes his way to the kitchen, Steve is putting scrambled eggs on his plate along with bread and a few blueberries, well Tony's blueberries but he doesn't mind it. Actually, it makes him remember when he first met Steve, and he can't help but smile at the memory.
Anyway, it’s been a long time since Steve’s last paint, and he missed it a lot. But the thing is he just can’t find the inspiration right now, instead, he photographed and hoped to get a job soon. His concern now is to get some sleep, he will have a long day tomorrow. Steve tugged himself under the sheets, and he’s snoring softly in a few minutes.
“Thank you, Steve. Enjoy the rest of your day, huh?” There’s a smirk on her face when Steve turns around by the door. He surely will. He smiles back, waving her goodbye.
"Tony, are you okay? What's in your head?" The genius opened his mouth to answer, there are a lot of things he could say to Steve. He could tell him how much he was panicking with all of this happening, how he was the biggest problem in the team, because Tony is so reckless and selfish. Though, it wasn't Steve's problem, and right now he couldn't be a burden to Steve, because it was him who put the blond in this situation and he has to fix it. The blond shouldn't have to handle Tony either, he shouldn't have to comfort him, so instead, Tony sighed.
"Thank you for waking me up." His voice is nothing more than a whisper, it sounds broken heart to Tony's ears. Tony shrugged.
Steve blinks and his gaze turns to Tony, dodging a running girl holding a teddy bear, and caressing a boy head, he smiles at the sight. Tony would be a good father, he knew for sure for the way he talked about Peter the day before, he cares about the boy and Steve could see clearly now that the teenage also sees Tony as a father figure.
Steve thank the girl who allows him training and they exit the place, making their way back home. Home, such a small word full of meaning, what is home? A place where you would feel safe, but what if home wasn't a place, but a person? Steve had a home, the compound, Tony had given him that home, it was enough for Steve at the time, but now the meaning of this word changed for Steve. Home is a person and Steve knew that no matter where he was, if Tony was with him, then he would be home.
He needs to know the truth before surrender completely, he needed to know if Steve really loves him as he does love Steve. He felt insecure and exposed, but it was okay, because there was only him and Steve in that room, and he wasn't afraid of showing his weakness to the blond. His heart was already broken since Germany.
Steve grabs Tony by the wrist, he looks surprised by the soldier act, like he had forgotten for a minute where and in which year they were. His eyes widened when Steve pulls him when he runs to the back or maybe the front of the building, Tony wasn't sure about which side of the building they were.
Then, she frowns at the sight of a book on the desk, she doesn't remember to buy anything, this one looks pretty old and used, though. She sits on the bed pulling the book from the desk, which makes some pencils fall on the carpet, she passes her hand over the red cover making the remnants of dust flew in the air and dance beautifully on the sunlight.
“Not so far. Everything is well described here,” Steve said, leaning against the chair, suddenly more relieved.
"We can't risk being caught, Steve." Tony sighs exasperatedly. "This is not the twenty-first United States century, where there are still prejudice but also laws to protect us. People will not be friendly if they know that we date." Steve sighs, he knows that the brunet is right, but he can't deny that he finds it hard sometimes not to shout his love for Tony everywhere. He kept this secret for so long and now that he finally has Tony, he just wanted to tell everyone.
Steve was looking for Tony in the middle of the crowd, they were together during the entire ceremony, then Steve went to greet Nick Fury and lost the brunette of sight.
"That's not true. I like the movie, too, Tony." The genius raised a brow doubly. "Okay. I can say that I also appreciated that you held my hand, although I'd prefer to kiss you." Tony's smile fade, and Steve knew immediately that he had said something wrong.
amazing, just like the first one did. It's Tony who breaks the kiss to catch his breath, they keep their forehead together and Steve observes the contours of the philanthropist's face, his beard perfectly aligned, the shine of his skin on the moonlight. Steve strokes his thumb on his face affectionately while Tony keeps his eyes shut appreciating the touch and thank inner for it.
Steve's hands rest on his waist and their lips met again in an urgent and needy kiss. Tony wraps his legs around the blond's waist, and Steve holds him tight walking to the double bed in the center of the room, their lips never lose each other, except when Tony peppers kisses and sucks smoothly Steve's neck.
He leans towards the nightstand opening the drawer and taking off a little bottle of lube. He kneels between Tony's legs spreading them, wrapping them around his waist. Steve pours lube on his fingers, then gently, he inserts one finger in Tony's entrance pushing it slowly and carefully. Tony feels the burning in the beginning, then it slowly fades away, and Steve adds another finger, thrusting his fingers merciless inside of him, scissoring him, preparing Tony to take him all. It feels good, Tony thinks, Steve's fingers inside of him feel really good. He pants when Steve pushes in a third finger, his hard cock pulses with the lack of attention but he doesn't want to touch himself, so he pushes back the feeling, focusing on Steve, on Steve's hard cock with a drop of pre-cum.
Steve didn't even have realized that they stopped in front of a candy store, he was so distracted on his own thoughts. He glances to the showcase to see that Tony was pointing to a pink package full of colorful jellies gums and too much sugar.
The men came in Tony's direction again, the first one attacked, but Tony was short and fast and he dodges the attack. The second attacks, directing a kick to his lower back, which makes him stumbles and holds on a shelf bring the products on it to the floor. The second moves forward, this time raising his knee to hit Tony's stomach, but he doesn't expect Tony to take a step and hit his jawline hard, the attacker's head is thrown backward, and Tony holds his neck with a tight grasp almost cutting the airflow. The man pants, holding Tony's arm in an attempt to soft the grasp and escape, them the second holds a gun aiming at Tony.
Natasha showed him the whole floor, and the office, where the computer he would use was, so he would be able to edit the pictures. Well, the laptop was way better than Steve’s, it was faster and with large storage memory, so he could say that he wouldn’t mind using this instead of his. Then, Natasha took him to the two different studios that had different decorations, according to the red-haired they were preparing some photoshoots for the next collection they would launch, or preparing some photos in advance to put on the website. The third studio, on the other hand, was full of people working on the models, even Wanda was there as she talked with one of the models.
The sun is setting on the horizon. The pink, orange, dark blue colors are starting to fill in the sky spreading its glorious rest of light on the ground and creating mysterious shadows on the corners of the city. That’s probably Steve’s favorite part of the day. Those melancholic sparks of light fading to give space to the stars were something that amazed Steve. He used to watch the stars when he was in the Army. He used to look up at the sky and admire them while he tried to clean his head from all the concerns that he might have had. He needed a clean head because the lives of other men were depending on his attitudes and decisions. So, that passage from the afternoon to the evening has always been a moment of reflection to Steve, a moment where he could let his thoughts flowing freely in his mind before all the discipline he had learned to have in the field took over him again.
"Shit," Tony says, throwing the jacket in a chair. "I found it on the lab you were, it's a blood sample of yours." Tony rolls the tube between his fingers, then he raises his gaze to look at Steve. "Steve, what happened when you were there?"
They run through the labs, this place is a fucking maze. Luckily the event should already begin because there aren't any civilians in that floor.
Both took a little of everything from the plateau and they eat in silence for a while. Tony sips that coffee served and swallows the black liquid unwillingly, making his best to not spit it out. The coffee is awful and tasteless, so he puts it aside. Steve, on the other hand, drinks only water and his scrambled eggs peacefully.
They left the car in an empty street, next to downtown, like Tony had said it was a loan, they never intended to keep the vehicle, and they hoped the police would track it and the owner would have it back soon. Tony bought a newspaper in a kiosk in the corner of the street and started to look for apartments for renting in the want-ads They only have a week left before coming back to their original timeline, but if Hydra wants the Tesseract they would be pretty determined to find it, which means that Tony and Steve needed to be really discreet in order to keep the cube safe and sound for their own's sake.
This is enough for Tony. He feels the adrenaline flowing through his veins, in the next moment, he is holding Thomas Pierce by his collar against the wall, a switchblade dangerously close to his carotid.
"I guess I may not live to see you two together, you both are too stubborn to believe me." She says, leaving behind the lab and Tony with a head full of confusing thoughts.
Steve turns to face her, he didn't know how to react. Peggy thought he was dead, what could he explain to her but the truth? They were messing with that timeline so bad, none of this was supposed to happen. Then Steve turns back to Tony who was standing in the same place, his face now showing that he was a little upset.
Tony leads them to the closest emergency exit for what he remembers from the floor plan. One more agent appears from the elevator.
Tony's beard tickles his skin, but it doesn't matter because he loves it. Steve's hand rest on the back of the genius's neck, pulling him closes and deepening the kiss, then Tony groans and pulls apart licking the cut on his bottom lip.
His phone chimes on the table and Steve takes it, seeing that Peggy, Bucky’s almost fiancée, liked his last picture and commented on a ‘nice shot’. Well, if it wasn’t for Peggy, they certainly would be at the bottom of the well.
“You see Maria Hill there? Ask her for coordinates. She planned this whole thing, I’m sure she has a lot for you to do,” Sam said.
"C'mon, mister Perfect-Body!" Tony exclaims, rolling his eyes and turning to read the package's cover. "It says sugar-free, see? It doesn't even have sugar on its composition"
"Tony? Tony, stay with me. Don't sleep." Steve says cupping his cheek, his voice sounds loud, but he knows that Steve isn't shouting, his headaches like hell, and he can hear his heartbeats loudly inside his ears.
"No, don't apologize." For a tiny moment, Tony seems like he's going to rest his hand on Steve's left knee before he retracts the move and grips the wheel again. "I'm just surprised, I think. I grew up hearing stories about the greatest Captain America and all of this." Tony hesitates. "I kinda have a crush on you too."
"So, how do we know that they know we have the tesseract?" Tony asks and a sudden glimpse comes to his mind.
He smiles at this thought while, at the same time, he punched the sandbag in front of him, the chain hanging it from the roof squeaks, protesting against the move.
Happy is not here today, according to Tony, he’s driving Pepper around for some SI’s business, which means it’s only him and Tony in the car. Thankfully, traffic is not so bad, and the Stark Tower is in the middle of town, easy access, plus, the silence in the car is not awkward like it was in the first times Tony picked him up in Brooklyn. In one of Tony’s songs, Steve wasn’t good at memorizing their names, and he also prefers classic older songs, filled with silence.
“You’re sure?” Tony places a kiss on his hand. Steve nodded. Yes. he was sure. He would be fine. He just needed to breathe.
Time passes by real fast on the road after that night. Steve and Tony were more talkative and intimate with each other. They were taking back for years of being secretly in love in just hours, they talked a lot about everything, their feelings and the moment they realized they loved each other.
I know I put 10 chapters there, but I'm thinking it can have around 12 - 14 since the chapters are getting way too long.
"Good morning, sweetheart," Steve says, catching Tony's full attention, he leans to drop a kiss on top of his head. "They just brought breakfast."
Steve moves slowly, thrusting inside of him. Steve grunts from pleasure, his eyes closed while he slides his hands to Tony's hips, keeping the brunet steady while he thrusts again harder this time, Steve's cock deepening further inside of his hole. Tony pulls Steve closer for a needy kiss that the supersoldier gently gives back, his nails sliding on Steve's lower back, the blond moan, thrusting again.
Steve chuckles, shaking his head, then Tony winks at him. Steve checks for the memory card inside the camera.
He opens his mouth to argue, but he knows Steve is right. They can't go, they don't even have an ID, though Steve needs medical care.
He flips through the folder, taking glimpses of the material in it, his jaw clenched with the things he is reading. Tony closes the folder abruptly, shoving it angrily inside the bag. Fuck. Everything is messed up. He needs to show it to Steve, as well as he also needs to know what happened to Steve while they are in that warehouse.
Tony sighs a deep sigh. “Probably not. He hates himself so much right now I don’t think I could get him to do anything.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” he says, trying to sound indifferent. He doesn’t enjoy the thought of being alone in the Tower, but he’s not about to stop her. “Have a drink for me. And have fun.”
“What?” Tony asks, offended on Steve’s behalf for a moment. He doesn’t even notice that Steve’s sinking back into the couch.
“The 70’s,” Bruce tells him patiently as he folds a napkin and passes it Steve’s way. “Very different than Nirvana. Honestly Tony, I don’t know why you decided to group all these things together.”
Tony looks down at his husband and runs his fingers through his hair, pushing the blonde fringe away from his eyes. They’re just as beautiful and blue as ever and his gaze is half-hooded, cozy and warm.
“Steve, you are the most important thing in the world to me,” Tony says, trying to be as earnest and serious as possible. “But if something happened to Pepper, I’d go off the deep end. She meant something to you. That doesn’t change how you feel about us.”
He should be out of the cast by tomorrow and back in the gym by the end of the week. But in the mean time Tony hasn’t left his side for longer than a few hours at a time, something that had never happened before in their relationship. On one hand, it’s a little annoying because he really doesn’t need 24/7 supervision. And of course, that just makes him feel guilty because he knows Tony wouldn’t be doing this if Steve hadn’t scared him like he had. But on the other hand, he likes it. He loves being with Tony and they very rarely have the luxury of being able to have a conversation that lasts more than twenty minutes, so this is nice. In fact, it’s the only thing that makes bed rest tolerable.
“Wow, I must love you so much,” Tony slurs and Steve lifts his head, surprised by the random moment of tenderness.
“I called you up here to try and get to know you.” Tony finally plops down in the seat across from him. He looks at Steve and it’s the closest he’s ever seen Tony get to sincere yet. “We’re all living together now and things were strained between us for a good amount of time on the helicarrier and I don’t want to live like that forever. So we’re going to have to suck it up and learn to like each other on some sort of personal level. Because respecting each other as teammates was fine when we were just teammates but it won’t cut it now that we’re roomies.”
Honestly, Tony isn’t surprised this happened. He’d be waiting since the moment they got together for some supervillian to try and kidnap one of them to use as bait. What he is surprised about is that it’s M.O.D.O.K because honestly he always imagined that it would be someone a little more intimidating.
“Oh God, Steve, please” Tony pleads, still highly amused by the put off look on Steve’s face. “Don’t judge 21
He found himself peering into a media room of some sorts; Tony and Steve curled up on the couch together watching His Girl Friday like they were old friends. Nick Fury had stopped being surprised a long time ago, but even he couldn’t deny the way his jaw dropped at the sight of them.
Phil starts to get up though he’s rolling his eyes, which probably means that he’s not that impressed by Tony’s defense of his relationship. “If I was going to steal Steve Rogers away from you, I would’ve done it years ago,” he says casually, as if he’s telling Tony that it’s a little rainy outside so he should take an umbrella. Tony gapes at him like a fish out of water, watching him go without even having the decency to write down the love poem he just spewed about
Tony has no words. His chest feels tight and he knows it has nothing to do with the arc reactor. He has no way to thank them. He has no way to deal with how loved he feels right now.
Tony looks over and sees that Steve is staring at him and he snorts at his cheesiness but he brings the food over and settles in beside him anyway. Steve takes the plate gratefully and digs in enthusiastically. Tony’s been on edge all day, a little nervous at the thought of what he might do tonight. He’d thought that he would have to put it off when Steve had insisted on having Bruce and Betty tag along but now they’re here and they’re alone and it seems like almost the perfect moment sitting among the candles and the darkness.
There are two small patches on Steve’s left bicep, so tiny that you wouldn’t notice them unless you were standing right next to Steve. One is a small letter A that matches the logo on top of the Avengers tower. The other, right below the A, is a small circle that’s half Steve’s shield and half Tony’s arc reactor.
“Tony,” Steve warns, leaning down to get a good look at him. He’s cut off as Tony slaps a hand over his mouth.
“He can’t do any worse than Natasha,” Betty reasons. It’s unusual for her to call someone out in such a blunt matter, but Natasha herself doesn’t disagree with her assessment.
Fury’s tired. And not your regular kind of tired. No it’s the aches-in-your-bones kind of tired. They’d just been through a long battle and an even longer day. He wanted nothing more than to just go home and fall into bed and not think about anything for a while.
“Ah, can you say that again so that I can record it?” Tony says with a grin, as he threads his fingers through Steve’s hair. Steve huffs out a laugh and pokes him in the ribs. Tony wiggles and laughs but still says, “Hey J, please tell me that you recorded that for me?”
Steve clears his throat and says, “This was a nice idea Tony, but I just don’t think it’s going to-“
“Yeah,” Tony whispers back with a smile as the others countdown the last five seconds of 2020. “Always together.”
“I’m thinking of headstones over here, want to give it a try?” Steve asks, his chin snug against Tony’s shoulder.
Tony closes his eyes and soaks it in and all he feels is warm. For now, dark winter nights are forgotten.
“Because you look like you’re about to collapse.” Steve’s becoming more and more agitated as he looks over Tony and Tony should’ve known better than to think he could come down clutching his side and not have anyone ask about it.
He knows somewhere deep, deep down that he should really just give the book back. But it would take a far stronger man than Tony to resist temptation when a tiny black book falls out of Steve Rogers’ back pocket.
But then Tony comes home and he sees what the world doesn’t see. What he will selfishly hoard for himself for the rest of his days.  Steve’s bare toes flex on the tile kitchen floor, a sign that he probably regrets not putting on sock to go with his worn, grey sweat pants. His bangs, just a little too long, fall into his eyes as he focuses on his task.
“I wasn’t,” Steve says absently as he digs around for the floss so that all the toiletries can be neatly stacked together in one bag. “But I’m not surprised. I tried to tell him to go for that sleep test thing that SHIELD offers but he didn’t bite.”
Steve had brushed him off but it hadn’t deterred him for long. Another few days later he cornered Steve in the elevator and said “You know, I asked JARVIS to scan your storage locker and he said that your oil paints are starting to go bad and your pastels are starting to melt. You should probably bring them up before it gets any worse.”
Steve gets up to offer Tony a hand up and a smile that is nothing but affectionate as he says “You losing your touch?” and Tony is too damn happy to care anymore. He takes Steve’s hand goes up into his husband’s arms without complaint.
it’s totally possible for you to be keeping a harem in the tower,” Tony says, sneaking on a pack of M&M’s while Steve hauls a value pack of spilt chicken breasts onto the belt. “However, you and Justin Hammer wouldn’t be a thing in any universe. Your judgment would never be
“Nah.” She sounds wistful. A smile breaks out across her face and fades away just as quickly. “It’s enough to know that he got through okay. Besides, he’s got you now.”
Tony lets the silent looks continue for another minute before Tony asks “Did you guys blow up the office?”
can change. I can watch what I say, I can check my temper. We can go to counseling if we need to. But not this. Tony, I need-”
“The thing that bothers me now that I’m older and, I guess, wiser?” Tony takes a pause to think and Steve doesn’t push. “Well, there’s a lot of things that bother me about it. But one of the things that I think about a lot is my mother’s piano. She had this beautiful white baby grand piano. And when they died I couldn’t bare to look at it anymore. So I sold it.”
“A rip off,” Tony says, flashing him a wide, cheeky smile as Steve lets out a burst of surprised giggles.
It’s blizzarding in the way it always does during February in New York and it makes the tower feel like the inside of a snow globe. Quiet, muffled wind whips against the windows and it’s so soothing Tony almost feels like melting into the couch for a long nap. Steve, Natasha, and Clint are away on a minor recon mission that Tony knows they could do in their sleep. Tony just dropped by Bruce and Betty’s quarters and found Bruce bundled in a blanket and quietly reading a book on Marie Curie.
She just frowns and then turns to walk away without another word, leaving him alone in the empty, quiet room.
Tony’s about to spew out a cranky response when his hands run over two rough patches on Steve’s bicep. He looks down and something catches in this throat at what he sees.
“Huh?” Steve twists his head to look back at the patches, a large smile blooming across his face when he sees them. “I didn’t ask for the Avengers one. I gave Coulson a sketch for the other one but I wasn’t sure if he’d actually put in it.”
Steve accommodates himself at the edge, bring his knees to his chest and wrapping his arm around his own legs while resting his chin on one of his knees. A few minutes later he hears footsteps behind him and turns to see Tony walking in his direction, in one of his hands he has a box while rubs his eyes with the other one.
He opens one of the last doors, and he immediately recognizes the blond. Steve lifts his head up to see who is coming in and his eyes widened.
, Steve thinks. "It's a long story." He finally says sounding uncertain, which makes Peggy lifts a brow questioning.
Tony throws himself on the couch beside Steve. The blond look at him to see that he was holding the jellies gum he had bought earlier. Steve smiles, of course, Tony would take dessert.
“No, I don’t think I will.” He replies before holds Tony’s legs around his waist with a tight grip and heads straight to their room.
Since Steve came back home six months ago, he’s been diagnosed with PTSD - post-traumatic stress disorder -, which was not surprising at all. He had heard of a lot of cases during his time in the Army, but Steve wanted to serve and he just had to get his chance, so he would fulfill it happily. Bucky was diagnosed one year ago as well since he came back before Steve. He was in therapy longer than Steve, so he coped better with nightmares than Steve did. The blond was also in therapy in the last three months. He finally decided to follow it after Bucky scolds him so many times for not getting help before. So, Steve was learning to deal with his PTSD, as well as Bucky, although Bucky has also been coping with phantom limb syndrome.
Pierce puts his hand inside of the left pocket taking out a keychain with more than ten keys. Tony takes it, asking which one opens the door of the room they are in, and which one opens the room Steve was, the man answers reluctantly. Then, Tony puts the keys inside of his jacket. He keeps holding the blade high while he walks to the door.
Steve nods silently, but Tony can see that he still did not accept this idea, he feels like they should act and stop it right now.
"I'm next to..." Tony didn't finish and all Steve heard was something being hit, probably, against the wall.
The lights turn on the exact moment Tony finishes his improvised bomb, when an alarm sounds loud and strident.
"I used to draw when I was a kid." For a moment, Tony thinks he won't continue, but he does."You know, I was a sick and scrawny kid from Brooklyn, so I couldn't play around with the other kids outside, so I drew. " Then, he adds. "And read, I used to read a lot."
Basically, they have spent the day over the building floor plan, distracted, and making a plan to get the Pym particles as soon as Hank will be back and leave the building without being noticed. They would need to be discreet and get a disguise to get in, after that, they would have to find a way to reach the labs. It'll work. It has to. Steve assured him.
"Okay, then what? Who's going to snap it?" Scott asks. "That thing is powerful." He throws his hands on the air looking exasperate.
"You care about him" That's not a question. "More than a friend. You have strong feelings for him, you should tell him." Her expression softens.
He hears the guards steps outside the door, then he turns on his heels and sees the corridor empty. That's his call. He exits the office and moves fast to the elevator. Thankfully, it's empty and it goes like this all the way up. Steve finds himself back in the ground, the midday light blinds him for a second, till he puts the mirrored glasses back on. He moves to the corner where they came from and waits for Tony. He appears a few minutes later carrying a briefcase and talking with Howard Stark, his own father.
Warning: there's a smut scene in the end of the chapter, just leaving this warning here in case you don't like it.
“Hey! You came!” Wanda exclaimed excitedly, and Steve could see that she was slightly drunk. The young woman pulled Steve by the wrist. “This is Clint from finances,” she said. Steve nodded, squeezing Clint’s hand when he extended it for a handshake. “That’s Thor there, he works in security,” Wanda pointed to a blond dancing clumsily, though he doesn’t seem ashamed of it. A blonde bartender appeared bringing another drink to Clint. “Oh! That’s Carol!” Wanda said, smiling passionately. Carol winked in response. “My fiancée. By the way, everyone, this is Steve Rogers, SHIELD’s new photographer.”
He looks to the bloody cloth Steve threw on the floor, his bowels turn to the sight and he pushes Steve aside before he leans his head deep and throws up. He doesn't have any problem or phobia with blood, but the events of the night are too much for him. God, he doesn't want Steve to see it.
Tony can hear his irregular breath. Steve leans to kiss him, Tony puts a cautious hand on his chest. "We're gonna run out of hot water if we don't stop playing, soldier." Steve snorts, but he robs a kiss from Tony anyway.
“Well, he should’ve knocked,” Steve shrugged, leaning again to kiss Tony. “Better, he should’ve not come up,” Steve mumbled against Tony’s lips.
"I know, " Steve says, a smile playing on his lips when he stares at Tony, which makes the brunet's lips curled up, too. Tony finishes the stitches on his arm.
Fuck! At least, they had talked enough time to FRIDAY be able to trace the call. He looks at the location blinking on his phone screen. It's not far from where he is, but it's a recluse place, next to big factories and warehouses. He was on his own, and Steve would not like him to go, but since when Tony Stark listens to Captain America commands? He was on his way, he would find Steve and bring him back home, safe and sound. That's what they do, what they've been doing the last ten years.
She looked around, Bruce was nowhere to be seen what made her wonder if her friends had come back. She grabbed the empty coffee mug and headed to the kitchen.
“You know I don’t dance.” Steve rolled his eyes, a habit that he had taken from Tony throughout the last year, he used to hate this, but now he loved, he learned to love even the billionaire’s flaws.
Outside, Steve sighed, probably it wasn't so bad as Tony said, he knew Tony has the habit of overreacting. Then, someone bumped on his shoulder abruptly, he didn't realize the high heels steps of the woman, he was caught off guard. The woman turns to apologize, a surprised look on her face, and Steve swears mentally, he shouldn't have to be seen, this wasn't supposed to happen.
Then, Steve and Bucky put the plates and cutlery on the well-organized table. It wasn’t a big table, but they could fit in it. Peggy stood up, giving orders to the boy to well place the table while Tony observed it.
The first rays of the sun hits them, warming their skin, wiping the cold away. Steve also hates the cold, it's a reminder of the time he lost in the ice, not that he could say that he lost, otherwise, he would never know Tony.
Tony closes the door, then he walks in the kitchen's direction leaning on the doorway, observing Steve takes a bottle of water out of the fridge and drinking directly from it.
Steve loved it. Tony leaned so comfortably against his chest while they talked about daily subjects, or their jobs, or their families. It felt right. It felt great. Steve thought he had never felt so warm, and cozy with someone before. He felt it with Tony, and he could never get enough of it every time Tony was around. Having Tony around made Steve felt wanted, loved.
Tony sats on his bed, taking the folder out of the bag and putting the rest of thing aside. He reads the content attentively, his eyes widening in shock and horror when he keeps reading further. What Hydra is trying to do is inhuman and unnatural.
“I’m thankful for--” Bucky started, he rested his chin on his hands as if he was thinking. “My job. This prosthesis. Well, nothing extraordinary happened this year, huh,” Bucky made a pause. “
He hears footsteps behind him and looks over his shoulder to see five men, drunk, one of them still sipping the rest of the content of a beer bottle before throwing it to the middle of the street, the glass flighting everywhere, but it doesn't hit Tony. One of the guys stumbles bumping on another guy on his left who pushes him out of his way. The guy raises his head laughing and his eyes meet Tony's stare.
"Got it," He says holding a up a paper bag. "Have you tried it?" Steve shook his head. "Well, they're amazing, I'm telling you, you're gonna love it."
Steve keeps his cap down all the way to the sixth floor. However, the agent seems interesting on him, she looks right into him.
Tony was in their room, in front of a mirror fixing his bow tie when Steve came in. He was wearing a very expensive dark blue tuxedo, not by his choice, it was Tony who bought it and insisted him to wear it. On the other hand, Tony was wearing a black one. Steve approaches him, taking his hands off the tie and fixing it himself.
Steve passes right next to him to reach the sink and wash his plate and mug. He dries his hands on the towel hanging next to the sink.
"Then, I guess I'm about to have a fucking migraine," Tony says, walking out of the room and locking the man inside.
His father used to drink, sometimes, a lot. Tony had seen where it had led Howard Stark. He spent some much time, made such an effort, for not being like his father that he hasn't realized that he, in fact, became him. And Tony hated it, so much, he hated himself for all the mistakes he had made. He could forgive anyone, even Steve's betrayal, but he couldn't forgive himself for the harm he had caused to thousands of people.
Tony takes the footage back to the hour that Steve left the apartment. For some long minutes, he watches the boring video of people crossing the streets to go to work, kids accompanying their mother to the market, people taking the dog for a walk, a couple jogging, some men smoking at the corner.
He stops right in front of Tony, his arms open wide. A slight frown between his eyebrows, a sign that we did not like being contradicted.
Tony looks around, looking for something that he could use against them. This is a chemical lab with high and dangerous chemics on the shelves and desks.
"I-Sorry" Steve mumbled, but Tony didn't understand why Steve was apologizing, there was nothing to apologize for. Behind him, Peggy furrowed.
“I know, it’s gonna be a long day. That’s why you need to sleep.” Steve emphasizes, his eyes going down to the brunette’s lips as well. He is unable to resist the smile on his husband’s face, so he attacks his lips and pushes him against the table, making Tony sit on it. The brunette spread his legs so Steve can get even between them and closer to him, Tony hand slid on Steve’s side, his fingers touching every muscle of his husband, he rests his hands on the blond’s ass, he squeezes his cheeks and Steve moans under his touch.
He nods in agreement and takes a step forward closing the distance between them, his hand wrapping Tony's waist while he leans to kiss him. Tony kisses him back happily. They pull back and take a minute to catch their breath.
Well, Miss Potts stopped in front of the director’s door and knocked twice before opening it and step in.
He looks to Steve with a thankful smile before getting the bottle and drink half of it. The cold water coming down his throat is a relief, clearing his air passage and relieving the tight in his chest.
Tony crosses the street, and stops looking around, his hands on the top of his head while he snorts annoyed and worried. Everything is going so wrong since they came here. Tony almost hates the seventies for all the misfortunes it has brought to them, although he makes a mental note to remember that it was in the seventies that he and Steve finally got together, it does not seem so bad, after all.
What happened in Sokovia saved plenty of lives. God, saved a lot of lives otherwise the whole world would be dead by now, and he felt relieved for the lives and families saved and together now, but it was still the deaths that weight inside his chest, it was the deads who not allow him to sleep at night. All the lives matter, all humans being deserved to be happy. To have a future.
It was Steve who knew Peggy at first. He met her when Bucky went on a mission in Iraq, and Steve wasn’t sure if he would be accepted in the Army, given to his medical history that was terrible back then. However, Peggy worked in the Army office for a while until she decided to leave and open her own restaurant in Brooklyn. Peggy fully supported Steve in his decision of giving it a try. Fortunately, he was accepted. He trained for months over his limits, listening to the jokes of other fellas. Steve trained day and night, his muscles grow, he became stronger, and following an adequate diet plus daily work out, Steve was able to get rid of most of his diseases and show a high improvement of his health.
