always be the two of us, but that's not how it's gone, is it? You run off and face it all on your own and I sit around like some useless imbecile. I'm not stupid, Sherlock, and I'm not defenceless; army, remember?"
“No, but you can help me break them!”  Sherlock persists, his own laughter breaking through.
"Thanks for that, Phillip.  I'll see you later, John's insisting I have my dressing changed."  Sherlock flaps at him when John tries to take the phone away.  "Yes, Phillip, I'll be sure to tell him."  Sherlock hands the phone to John with another huff.  "Couldn't this have waited, John?"
“God, Sherlock.”
“Doctor Watson, Mr Holmes.”
"No!" Sherlock rocked slightly on his heels at the vehemence of John's exclamation. "No." John uttered again, this time more calmly.   "I'd like you to teach me, not a stranger. But, can we.... can we not talk to anyone else about this Sherlock? Keep it just between us, for now?"
This may be finding a ‘safe’ source for a drug or by watching over people when they crash from their highs in rather dingy drug dens.”
“It’s just gone four a.m, your brother is still in with John.  Mary went home several hours ago, probably best in her condition.  I didn't mean to wake you.  I just wanted to see for myself that you're safe.”  Lestrade’s fatherly voice breaks through Sherlock’s musings, surprising him with both his presence and his perceptiveness.  Sherlock realises that it must have been the sound of Lestrade entering the room that woke him.
"I really want to kiss you Sherlock, but your poor lips are too tender." John's gaze is fixed on Sherlock's mouth, a glimpse of his tongue enough to cause Sherlock to tremble in his hands. Slowly, John presses lingering kisses to his forehead, to the bridge of his nose, along each cheek bone and finally to the corners of Sherlock's full lips. They both sigh as their foreheads rest against each other and Sherlock feels more whole than he can ever recall feeling. "Now, you need to get better so that I can kiss you properly. I want to find out if that mouth of yours really does feel as good as it looks."
“The doctors had expected you to have woken up by now; you were displaying all the expected signs. You’re breathing on your own now, completely unaided.  The swelling in your head has receded and you show no signs of fever.  You should be awake now”
Sherlock parts his legs, encouraging John to slip between them, his long legs wrap over John’s thighs, locking him securely in place. A groan slips from John’s mouth at the new position, he moves down Sherlock’s body until his cock slips down and nudges at Sherlock’s cleft, making both men moan.
“Careful John, last time Sherlock and I saw a pair of Cowboy boots he deduced that the wearer was a sufferer of erectile dysfunction.”
When the nurse leaves the room, satisfied with her patient’s progress, Sherlock decides to calculate how long John had been left ‘alone’ since waking up. The answer that Sherlock arrives at shocks him; less than fifteen minutes. Less than fifteen minutes and yet it felt both forever and fleeting to Sherlock.
“It’s no bother at all, dear.  Sit yourself down and I’ll put the kettle on, then fetch the first aid kit.”  Mrs Hudson bustles off and spends some time shuffling around in her drawers before she locates what she needs.  She lets the tap run before filling her kettle and then turns on the hot tap to wash her hands thoroughly. When she turns ‘round her guest is just sitting down at the table, eyes still wide in wonder. “Now dear, what’s your name so I can chat to you properly whilst we’re getting all nice and cosy here?”
How do I not miss you when you are gone?
Wincing at the memories, John shifts on his seat, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck. The movement catches a previously deep-in-thought Sherlock's attention. Ice blue eyes sweep over John's form, narrowing as they take in John's face. Slowly, Sherlock moves his hand to John's knee, offering both solace and camaraderie. As is often their way, no words are spoken and yet John knows that Sherlock is saying. 'I am here for you, John.' The simple touch means more to John than any grand declaration of love ever could. Although, John thinks as he looks out of the window, a smile playing about his lips,
"Really? We'll have to do something to rectify that." He watches as a deep flush sweeps over Sherlock's cheekbones but his crooked grin is a sure sign of his agreement on the matter. The grins gradually turn into chuckles and both men release their hold on each other, constant touch no longer necessary.
"I think John may be more comfortable doing what is necessary for this test somewhere a little less public. Somewhere without windows would be ideal, a lock on the door preferable. The little area you wash in, perhaps?" Although it's worded as a question Molly realises that it's more of a polite demand than a request. Blushing furiously, Molly retrieves the bathroom key from her pocket and gives it to Sherlock.
A huge, huge thank you to everyone for reading and also for the wonderful response to the previous chapter, I am blown away by your support.
John's ears perk up at the sound of his name, but the rest of the conversation is a mystery to him. He glances between the men in the hope that he can work out what is being said, but to no avail. Josef is studying him intently with something akin to awe on his face, which John finds confusing; what could possibly be awe worthy about him? Sherlock, on the other hand, is looking at him in a way that makes his skin heat and his breath catch. It's the same look John had glimpsed in the hotel room the night before. Hunger. This time Sherlock does not shutter the look away, but allows him to see it. Eyes the colour of the ocean seem to bore directly into John, silently willing him to understand. Swallowing roughly, John barely hears the words that are meant for Josef but said to him.
“But I don’t want one,”
No other partners?”
John’s hips suddenly still and his grip tightens on Sherlock’s arse as he finally reaches his climax.
"Jesus, John."  Sherlock is unable to hold himself back, his original line of thought disrupted as he surges forward.  He kisses John fiercely, his own body trembling violently.  "No!"  Sherlock's voice is harsh and strained, his voice contorted with his warring emotions, his eyes filling with tears that he will not allow to fall.  "You can't write things like that! You just can't!  You mustn't!  You can't mean them....... How could you? ....... I couldn't .....if you didn't...... You can't." Sherlock's words finally stutter to a halt.  If John loved him, his world would be complete.  But how could a man like John, love a man like Sherlock?
In no rush to leave John's embrace, Sherlock let his mind drift back over the previous night's events. He could remember his own dark dreams; the repeated threat to John and his own helplessness.  Then, woven into his dream he had heard John calling him, telling him to listen, to come back.  Sherlock had instinctively done as he was instructed and had slowly, but surely, slipped into a deeper sleep.  His subsequent dreams had consisted of whispered phrases in John's voice. Snatches of compliments now drifted back to him.  "Your brilliance astounded me." "You are incandescent." And then, something about being John's 'other half'.  Such pleasant dreams, which had been infused with the imagined sensation of John running his fingers through his hair.
"Christ, Sherlock." John's words are breathless as he basks in the glory of being the recipient of Sherlock's intense focus.
An infrequent user.
The room is quiet except for the heavy breathing of the men, both absorbed in their own, and the other man’s, actions.
John had tried his best not to feel jealous about it but had failed miserably, his displeasure coming through in passive-aggressive actions and sharp words.
They continue to make small-talk until Mrs Hudson starts to yawn discreetly and her eyes grow heavy, she covers her mouth with her hand briefly and blinks sleepily at Enid.
Again a huge thankyou to everyone! The comments make me so happy.  A special thankyou goes to penguinsofPatagonia, for letting me use her description of how dancing makes her mind feel, it was just so damn perfect for Sherlock I had to have it!
Presently, the sound of the violin drifted into the kitchen, the notes caressing his ear with the tenderness and skill of an old love. As the sounds wrapped him in their sensuous embrace John vowed to talk to Mary about their upcoming wedding.  Whatever it was, or could be, between him and Sherlock John needed to be in 221B for it to happen. He needed to be home.
Together can never be close enough for me
“I can see that Mr ‘olmes is in the best ‘ands now.”
Sherlock edged further forward in his chair, purposely positioning one of his long legs between John's shorter, sturdier ones.  Although no contact was made, Sherlock could feel the warmth emanating from John, the sensation bringing a warm flush to his skin.  Glancing up, Sherlock could see that his friend was deep in thought and his furrowed brow returned.
So many dead people.
John watches, mesmerised as Sherlock slowly eases from the bed and onto the sheepskin rug, before following him over. The firelight plays over flat, firm muscles and caresses the alabaster skin; shadows dance over the planes of high cheekbones and mischief twinkles in starlight eyes.
or out and about, returning home with various shopping bags and boxes; all of which he squirrels away in his room.
"Quite." Sherlock presses a careful hand to his chest, wincing at the sudden surge of pain. "I've asked him to bring all his records over.  There's a slim chance, but one I'm willing to take, that we will recognise Mary or an associate of hers in the photos or descriptions."
Each day I'll turn it back
“You lied by omission.” The anger is passing and hurt creeps in to John’s voice.
“Of course you have.
“Bit over-friendly, if you ask me.
The threat is now clear in her voice, if not in her words.
How can I not love you when you are gone?'
"Sherlock. When you..." Mrs Hudson's voice broke. "When you..... jumped, two people died that day. You....... and John. It may have been your body broken on the ground but his very essence died in that moment."
Any denials are quickly interrupted.
"But you know how to look after a wound at home; you've already done it." Sherlock's words are softer, but he knows he's still treading a thin line.  Somehow he can't seem to stop himself pushing the point further.
At some point John’s hand had slipped from Sherlock’s and Sherlock had not held it again, not wanting Mary to see and cause trouble for John. Sherlock’s hand now feels empty and cold and he misses John’s touch intensely.
John settles once more over Sherlock, kissing along the deep V of muscles dipping towards Sherlock's groin. A slight shift lower and John's chin bumps against the head of Sherlock's cock. At the contact, Sherlock's hands sweep down to John's head, long fingers threading through his hair, tensing and flexing before Sherlock forces his hands away again, finally positioning one to clutch in his own hair, the other tugging at the bed sheet.
Relief and despair fought for dominance in Sherlock's mind.  Maybe John hadn't deliberately ignored him? Maybe Mary needed John more at that moment? That still didn't explain why Sherlock had not heard anything directly from John but he felt the tiny Phoenix of hope start to rise from the ashes of his shattered dreams.
Well…”
"Gerroff Sh'lck, sleeping."  John's words were mumbled and slurred, exhaustion still trying to claim him as its victim.
“All hearts are broken.  All lives end.  Caring is not an advantage, Lestrade.” Sherlock flatly intones, it’s a lesson he has known for as long as he can remember.
This story is gradually being edited by the wonderful Lockedinjohnlock in preparation for being turned into a podfic! I'm so excited! She is a brilliant beta too!
"Sherlock? Look at me."  John's voice is surprisingly calm despite being laced with need.
can tell that my timing would have been
"Yeah. That would be good." John licks his lips and his eyes travel to Sherlock's mouth, they are both very aware of the tension between them, of the need for them to cross some invisible line and finally be together in a way that their situation doesn't currently allow.
John opens his mouth to speak but it is obvious he is struggling to vocalise, eventually forcing out a cryptic, “Waves?”
When all the music dies
Sherlock stared at the flashing cursor for several long minutes before swiping it into the saved/not sent box. Sentiment had played him as its fool once; he would not let it do it again. Straightening his back and hardening his heart, Sherlock Holmes began to rebuild his walls.
Mary returns downstairs and awaits the inevitable night time nibbles to hit John, as they always had done after they'd had a particularly energetic round of sex.  She admits it hadn't all been bad, having to pretend an attraction for John Watson.  He was attractive in an understated way and she hadn't been totally bored by him, there was some intelligence there.  In fact, she mused, she could almost,
"Yeah, probably.  Thanks Sherlock. That was good. You're...."  amazing, outstanding, beautiful..... "A really good teacher, much more patient than I probably deserve." John was mumbling in the direction of his feet, not wanting to look up in case Sherlock saw the sadness on his face.
"No. I'll have a coffee." John glanced to where Sherlock was lying, meeting a calm blue gaze. "Please."
Although Sherlock's body remains relaxed in John's arms, he hears the anxiety lacing Sherlock's whispered words.  His heart clenches at the knowledge that Sherlock  still seems so unsure.  John gently tilts his head, positioning himself so that he can look directly into Sherlock's face.  He is struck anew at the raw beauty he sees, the odd mix of innocence and wisdom, knowing that he will never tire of it.  Eyes fathoms-deep study him intently, as if he were the greatest mystery in the world.
"Yeah, maybe one day," John grins, his face soft with sentiment.  "Marriage first," he chuckles.  "I'm a traditionalist, after all."
From the moment John had limped into his life Sherlock knew that a leak had sprung in his defence wall; he had tried valiantly to plug it up again. He had tried all of the  techniques that had proven successful at keeping people distant in the past.  Disinterest had not worked - John had stayed. Rudeness had not worked - John had stayed. Blocking him from the Work had achieved nothing - John had stayed. Interfering in John's relationships had not worked - John had stayed. One thing had worked though - his staged death. Upon his return Sherlock had witnessed John's reaction to him and had thought that he had finally shored up the leak in his defence wall against his emotions.  It had hurt him bitterly; he had been prepared to knock the last of that wall down for John. To wrap John up in his love for him, to never leave him again, to give John cause to keep staying. Sherlock's intellect was overwhelming but it paled in comparison to the intensity of his emotions when they were allowed free reign. Unsurprisingly John had been terrified upon first seeing Sherlock, convinced that he had actually lost his mind, that his hallucinations had finally taken firm control. Sherlock had read it all so easily on the broken man who stood in front him, his own fear and overwhelming emotions causing him to act irrationally, to say idiotic things.  Sherlock tensed in his chair as the image of his betrayal in John's eyes burned its path across his mind palace. John had stumbled as he stood, the anger and fear had been evident and Sherlock had automatically reached to help, only stopping when he saw that John's iron will had re-asserted itself.
"Mary implied that there was a history between you two, a sexual history. And, I must admit, you looked at him like there had been."
“It’s not my story to tell.” Sherlock says in an attempt to calm John down, not wanting him to do something to exhaust himself further.
John looked up to see Sherlock smiling at him from across the room.  A genuine, warm smile, a smile John suddenly realised he had never seen Sherlock bestow on anyone else. His heart beat a tattoo in response, his face melting into an answering grin.
“No.”  He attempts to reassure Lestrade.  “The operation went well, it was a success.  They were able to completely remove the haematoma.”
“John?  You know it won’t always be like this? I won’t always be like this?”  Sherlock finally replies earnestly.  “I’ll still get lost in the work.  Still want to spend time on my experiments.  Still be an arsehole from time to time.”
"This, John." Sherlock's long fingers brush lightly over John's hip, before tracing the line between his abdomen and thigh.  John trembles as Sherlock's touch slides closer to his balls.  "I'd visualised what you would look like naked, but this is what you kept a secret from me. The fact that you would stand before me, proud in your nakedness.  All your softness ....."   A gentle hand cups John's testicles and long fingers stroke the soft skin behind.  "....... and hardness."   A long swipe of wet, warm tongue up John's erection causes him to gasp and thrust his hips forward.  "On display.  No shame, just for me.  Oh, God, John." Sherlock slips his mouth around the tip of John's cock, pulling a low moan from him.
"How are we going to do this?" John awaits Sherlock's answer and when none is forthcoming offers a few suggestions of his own. "If you need to sit, you'll obviously need to lower your pyjama bottoms but then I'll be able to sit you down and leave the room until you're done. That gives you some degree of stability whilst you're doing what your body needs to do. If you wish to remain standing I'll turn away but switch my grip from around your back to around your abdomen. That way I'll be able to support you but you'll have some, if limited, privacy. That option requires less energy from you but I won't be able to leave the room."
"Solve it. I know you can!"
“We’re detectives, John, we often pretend to be…. “
"Teasing you." A lick through the line of hair leading from John's belly button to the top of his trousers.
Sherlock looks briefly away, chewing on his lip before returning his full attention back to John, his face open and vulnerable.
“Nope!”
Author's Note 27/07/2015
"Well, that's very considerate of you." John teases, allowing his smile to bloom fully. "But for now, we need to go slower, savour each moment. We'll start with you having that shower you wanted and then curling up in bed and yes, Sherlock Holmes, you will sleep."
Dragging his gaze away, he walked into the kitchen.  Scanning the room, he was amazed at how neat it was. Mrs. Hudson obviously came by regularly, looking after Sherlock in her own indomitable  way. Switching the kettle on John automatically reached for mugs and the instant coffee, only briefly registering that everything was back in the same places as before Sherlock's absence. Pouring the hot water over the coffee he checked the fridge for milk and was not entirely surprised to find none. Rooting around in the back of a cupboard he found a dusty bottle of whiskey.  Quickly he added a generous portion to both mugs before adding copious amounts of sugar to Sherlock's.
“Your husband could be on the cusp of regaining consciousness, have you no words of encouragement, of comfort, for him?”  Sherlock questions, struggling to keep the anger from his voice.
For as long as I live.'
that he realises he has been watching open-mouthed.
“You’re going to need to acknowledge my presence at some point, Sherlock.”  The voice echoes in the sparse room, its self-righteous tones unsoftened by the feminine timbre.  His only visible reaction is to hunch his shoulders up further and clasp his hands so tightly together that the colour leeches out of his skin.
Sherlock is already awake and idly tapping away on his laptop; John has no idea when Sherlock brought it through to the bedroom but is grateful to see Sherlock awake and alert. A visual check confirms that Sherlock is still pale, even by his normal standards but that the deep purple-grey beneath his eyes is starting to diminish. John notes that Sherlock is perhaps still a little thin in the face but knows that Sherlock will soon regain the lost weight, Mrs Hudson's numerous gifts of food ensuring it. He knows, through very thorough investigation, that Sherlock is very fit, the bullet wound continuing to heal well. The thought of last night's activities brings a smile to John's face that is answered by one of Sherlock's when he looks up from his laptop.
"Brilliant."
Sherlock stops rifling through his bag to look at John, an unusual softness to his features. "No. I was going to stay in, work on the laptop whilst you slept. Order something John, then get some sleep." Sherlock finally grabs his toiletries and disappears into the small en-suite.
He admits he had not coped well with the realisation that John and Mary were expecting a child, it was very much the final nail in the coffin in regards of John continuing to spend time with him; work with him.  Mary would, quite rightly, need for him to be at home to help with their child; would expect him to keep regular hours so that they could provide stability for their child. That, of course, had all changed when he’d been shot. John had been angry with Mary for so long - resenting her, resenting the child - that Sherlock hadn’t had time to process his own feelings on the situation fully.  John forgave Mary, as Sherlock knew he would, and the baby became a very real factor once more.  He thought he would ‘put up’ with the child, the way he had with John’s girlfriends.  As such, he had been ill-prepared for the flood of love that he had felt when he had first held her in his arms; crying and covered in vernix caseosa, none the worse for her sudden arrival in the back of a car.  An arrival he’d played an unexpectedly active role in.  He’d loved the days when John and Mary had visited, dropping exhausted on his sofa, leaving him in sole care of their daughter. Trusting him. He had taken great care to only call her ‘Watson’, thus always reminding himself to whom she belonged.  His heart had broken at the event of Mary’s death; not only at the loss of a woman he had grown to cautiously like but at the loss of John, with everything that he represented, and the loss of his goddaughter.
He barely manages to move slightly to the side before collapsing against John.
“And you won’t have to, John.”  It’s Greg’s turn to speak.  “It’s been an active case, that active case is now resolved.”  He glances at Mycroft for confirmation before continuing. “We are going to release a statement to the press that you and Sherlock having been actively aiding us in researching the woman that went by the name of Mary Watson aka Mary Morstan. That, together with the American government, we have been investigating crimes that she committed both on British and American soil.  We are going to say that you voluntarily went undercover, John, that the marriage was an unusual move in a long-term operation.”
He allowed his eyes to freely roam Sherlock's naked form.  Pale skin, blessed with a few freckles and moles here and there, adding to his natural beauty. Trim muscles, no unnecessary bulk or fat there, glossy dark curls surrounding the base of a spectacularly hard cock - which now twitched eagerly under his admiring eye. Slowly he raked his gaze back up Sherlock's body, amazed that he finally had the opportunity, had finally been brave enough to say something.  Settling his gaze on Sherlock's face his breath caught in his chest at the otherworldly beauty of the man. His friend. His best friend. His lover. His ........ everything. Sherlock's eyes were sparkling with joy and arousal, blue, gold and green all warring for dominance, those eyes that saw everything now watching John.  His lips were flushed with colour, thoroughly kiss bruised and looking more delectable than ever, a strangely lush mouth for a man but most definitely masculine. John felt the heat rise on his cheeks again as he remembered the feel of those full lips wrapped round his cock. Reaching gently over, John traced Sherlock’s slightly parted lips with his middle finger.  Gasping, John’s eyes flutter shut when Sherlock sucks his finger in, swirling his tongue round its tip, before giving it one more slow suck and allowing John to slowly withdraw his finger, leaving a trail of glistening wetness on Sherlock's full lower lip.
"Go away Mrs. Hudson!" Sherlock tried to make his voice cold, clipped but he knew he would not be able to fool this astute lady.  She saw far more than most and when it came to Sherlock her patience knew no bounds. He knew she saw him as a wayward son and he loved her dearly for it. Yes, loved.  That realisation had finally hit him during his time away. That had been the reason why he had fiercely protected her against Mycroft's barbed comments, why he had thrown a man from a window (multiple times) and why he had been so proud to introduce John to her.
John stares at Sherlock, struggling with the fact that Mary had actually succeeded in killing him, amazed that Sherlock is now sat here with him - living and breathing. “I knew you were bloody stubborn….”
Sherlock strips off his clothes quickly and efficiently until he reaches his underwear, which requires slightly more careful manoeuvring before he finally steps out of those too.  Stepping under the shower, he tilts his head back, eyes closed as he lets the water wash away the fine patina of sweat from his skin.  Deciding against washing his hair, knowing it would leave his hair unmanageable, Sherlock runs his fingers through it, carefully untangling any knots as he finds them before pushing it back off his forehead.  Sherlock takes his time washing, carefully ensuring every possible part of him is clean and refreshed; he ignores the way his heart rate picks up at the thought of precisely why he wants that level of cleanliness.
He raises up the head of his bed, mirroring John, and turns to face him.
The door clicks open and Sherlock ignores it, after-all, the nurses have been in and out all day, but the soft clearing of a throat alerts him to the fact that this is someone different, with a different purpose.
John urges, needing Sherlock to be the one who takes the lead now.
"You do it." It still hurts Sherlock a little to speak, but the words emerge more easily than before. Suddenly, Sherlock is concerned about the loss of time and what Mary may be plotting now that she knows he will pull through. Remembered words flood through him, bringing heat to his cheeks and a hitch to his breath, John saying that he wanted nothing more to do with Mary, that his heart belonged to Sherlock and then, in the most explicit of ways, describing how he wanted his body to belong to Sherlock too.
“I hardly think Gethin is an assassin.”
This story is gradually being edited by the wonderful Lockedinjohnlock in preparation for being turned into a podfic by her! I'm so excited!
I couldn't see it for myself, all I could see was the raw strength and masculinity of it.
‘Ave it looking like ‘ome again in no time.”
Sherlock has seen John napping often enough in his armchair at Baker Street to recognise the signs of imminent wakefulness.
He dips his tongue between John’s toes, repeating the manoeuvre when John’s soft moans are broken by a surprised giggle.
What was affirming?
“Nonsense.  You stay right there, young man,  I’m going to sort you out some food.  And you are going to eat it, even if I have to spoon feed you.”
Sherlock breathes deep, the scent of John making him light headed with longing. Almost without a thought he lowers himself to his knees, he smirks at the sound of a quickly stifled gasp and wraps his hand around the back of John’s ankle, encouraging John to lift his foot. Sherlock slips his sock off and presses a lingering kiss to the top of John’s foot, smiling when John chuckles. He repeats the process on John’s other foot and then slides his hands up John’s calves, over his knees and along his muscular thighs. Sherlock can feel the slight tremble under his fingers as John reacts to his touch, he traces the seam of John’s jeans until his fingertips trail under John’s balls, moving up along the line of the zip. He can feel the heat of John’s cock through the thick denim and moves his face until he is nuzzling into John’s crotch, enjoying the warmth and strength against his cheek, his nose, his lips. Sherlock’s fingers tremble as he draws back and pops the button of John’s jeans, easing the zip down slowly. His eyes are fixed on the dark burgundy material of John’s pants as they come into view, he gulps when he sees that a damp spot is evident on the fabric, concrete evidence of the level of John’s arousal and attraction to him.
mind you, see why Sherlock was so taken with him.  She had thought when she’d been hired to seduce John that she’d hate every moment of it but he had been unexpectedly … sweet. He’d been a gentleman through and through, so much so that he would only drop the gentlemanly behaviour in bed after she had him thoroughly aroused, she had greatly enjoyed that, after all, it wasn't dissimilar to torture, the teasing and denial and teasing again until the poor man was sure he would die if he couldn't come
Bringing John's face down for a lingering kiss Sherlock poured all of his love, all of his tenderness into it. John sighed deeply, breathing a small 'perfect' as Sherlock pulled away and stretched to open the draw.  Quickly he grabbed a small tube from inside, pressing it into John's hand, before pulling John back into another kiss. John squeezed lube onto Sherlock's fingers, groaning at the earlier remembrance of them being inside him, his cock twitching in anticipation. Quickly John found himself flipped onto his back, a gasped laugh escaping him before being silenced by the gleam in Sherlock's eye.
John starts before being abruptly cut off by a vehement, ‘John!’
“It’s nothing, I got ….hurt but I’m healing now.”
"Good thinking John."
John's face broke into a wide grin and Sherlock's heart lifted in response. "Of course you bloody are Sherlock! I'd expect nothing less of you, tomorrow you can show your skills off. Goodbye Sherlock."
"Jesus, Sherlock." John smiles, a genuine smile that seems to light up their steamy little room. "William Sherlock Scott Holmes, I love you with all that I am and all that I will be. I will love you when we are nothing more than energy and dust. I will love you through all my life and into death. This is my vow. This is the vow of John Hamish Watson."
Slowly he pressed his fingers against Sherlock's wrist, counting silently in his head as he continued to visually assess him.  His pulse was unusually elevated but not worryingly so. All the time he was examining Sherlock, he was aware of being studied in turn, those bright eyes flicking over his face, taking in each detail, each blemish.
(John Watson? Your John? You saved him. I knew you would. Does he know what happened to you here?)
He had familiarised himself with Sherlock’s case after their meeting concerning Doctor Watson and had expected for him to be rather further along the road to recovery; he makes a mental note to have a word with the nurses to ensure that there hasn’t been some complications that would explain Mr Holmes’ condition.
John could feel the rush of relief flood over him, its touch like the frost kissed lips of a lover, fresh and revitalising.  "Any closer to a resolution? Can I help at all?"
Something to show how very much he cares.
"Mrs Hudson? Could you come up here?"  Sherlock's deep voice drifts down the stairs and Mrs Hudson sighs.  As much as she loves her wayward 'son' she really doesn't fancy walking all the way up stairs merely to make him some tea.
I would have said something; even if it lost me your friendship.”
“Sherlock.” John’s voice is gravelly, breathless and before he can say anything more Sherlock chases his lips for another kiss.  “Sherlock.  Love, we can’t do this here -.” His words are cut short as Sherlock presses their lips together again, his hips starting to undulate against John’s.  “Sherlock.”  John manages.  “We need to stop.  As much as I really, really want to carry on, this isn’t exactly a private place.”
"Sherlock." John will deny vehemently that he is whining but in truth he knows no other way to describe the tone that his voice adopts. He rests his weight back on Sherlock's thighs, cock standing proud.
“What did you do to him?” Sherlock demands, one hand quivering over John’s wrist, seemingly just moving from taking John’s pulse.
Sherlock is so used to being lost in his thoughts and carrying on with everyday tasks that he has not faltered in his step, arriving at the restaurant with his arm still wrapped around John.  John, used to Sherlock losing himself in his mind palace, simply guides him to his seat and sets a menu in front of him, surprised when Sherlock blinks and smiles at him.
John was momentarily stunned by the consideration being shown to him, shock making his words harsh.
John stumbles slightly at Sherlock’s words, this small falter is extremely gratifying for Sherlock.  To know that he has the ability to make John feel that way with just a simple touch, some breathed words, is enough to make Sherlock feel much more able to deal with the way their relationship is changing.  To know that John is equally affected by Sherlock’s touch, Sherlock’s words, as he is by John’s, is strangely liberating.  Their relationship will be one of equals, neither having more power than the other.  His own lack of physical experience is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things; it doesn’t make him lesser than anyone else; than John.  They will learn each other, together; learn how to make each other pant, gasp, writhe and sigh, over and over again.  The thought brings heat to his cheeks and sets his heart racing; it’s a different kind of high to that which he is used to but one he knows he will become addicted to.  An addiction, Sherlock thinks, that John will approve of.
“Yep.”
Sherlock closely observes him as he continues his walk.  Tall - approximately six foot, two inches; broad-shouldered and slim - suggestive of regular exercise;  dark skin with the first suggestion of fine wrinkles around his eyes and lips; dark softly waving hair that is threaded through with silver - indicating his age at between forty-seven and fifty-two.  His eyes, when he stops at the group and are close enough to see clearly, are a dark, warm brown.
John was wrenched from his blissful sleep by a loud thud and his name being shouted.   Without a second thought, John tore off his bed sheets and ran towards the voice. Sherlock's voice.  His name was being called out in a tone filled with such anguish and despair that John felt physically sick, bile flooding his throat.  John's heart was pounding with fear; what could be causing Sherlock to cry out in such a way? He entered Sherlock's room still at a run, not slowing until he was at Sherlock's bedside, his eyes locked on the writhing bundle of flesh and sheets on the floor. The source of the thud was immediately apparent; Sherlock had fallen from his bed whilst locked in the throes of a nightmare. The anguished cries started again and John was able to discern his name intermingled with 'God, no!' and 'Please, not him!"
"Why would any of that hurt my feelings?" John asks, empty sandwich plate moved to his side table.  He leans forwards, elbows on his knees, his face earnest.  "I'm not so insecure to think that the fact that I probably can't father a child makes me any less of a man.  I didn't want to be a father, hadn't really accepted the fact that I might be one.  Like you, I'm beyond relieved that in all likelihood I'm not going to be."
“Mmmm, delicious.”  Sherlock smiles, leaning back in his chair and swiping another piece of toast and some pâté, this time feeding himself, effectively breaking the moment.
"Bloody hell, will wonders never cease?" John barked out on a laugh. "You've slept and you've cooked.  If you actually eat something, I may have to rethink all those alien abduction conspiracies."  John's dark blue eyes sparkled with mirth before they both allowed their laughter to break free.
John’s thighs tense and twitch under the path of his tongue, the way John’s leg hair darkens in colour and density the further down his leg it grows, darkening from a pale gold to a dark honey blonde.
Will it just be you and I?
In whichever way you want.”
And that's all folks!
"Ta. Think I'll grab a shower while I'm in there."
All mistakes are entirely my own! Not Beta'd. Luckily I am a Brit so in theory it should stand the test of Brit picking!
“I enquired at the nurses' station.”  Mycroft states on his return, his voice soft.  “I’m afraid there’s no real update regarding John but they have confirmed that he underwent a CT scan and is in surgery.”
"He is and he did.  Moriarty is dead; there is no doubt in my mind about that." Sherlock was now mirroring John's position, the new proximity allowing him to catch the subtle smell of John's aftershave mingled with John's own distinctive smell.  Sherlock marvelled at how, even at such a serious moment, John had such power over him; simultaneously making him feel safe and energised.  Sherlock could see that John was already interested in how the story would unravel and realised, once again, how much he had missed having John to talk to.   "Once I arrived in Rome it was obvious that it was just some delusional fanatic who admired the works of our enigmatic consulting criminal and wished to emulate him. Honestly John, it was child's play to identify him." Sherlock waved his glass around in a lazy circle, punctuating his disgust at such a simple case.
"John?" Sherlock's voice was deep, still wrapped in the last caress of sleep, but there was a panicked urgency there that had John scurrying into view.
"Technically right Sherlock." John rubbed at the back of his neck, before running his hand over his face, trying to keep the fond smile away. " But as I remember it, we were bloody handcuffed together and running away from the cops! It was either hold your hand or have my arm pulled out of its socket! Really not my idea of fun!"  Pausing again, Sherlock could see that John was remembering the after events; events that led up to Sherlock standing on the roof of St. Bart's, the events that led to his 'death'. He watched as John straightened his shoulders and could pinpoint the exact moment that John made the decision not to dwell in the past. "And you, you bastard, had held a gun to my head in front of half of bloody Scotland Yard! I could plead I was in shock.  Didn't know what I was doing."
John stares blankly at the menu he had automatically caught. "You're going out? Let me grab a shower after you, wake myself up a bit, and I'll go with you."
“No!”
“You talk as if you care, Sherlock.” Mary snaps, her cool demeanour momentarily ruffled. “Do you even realise what you meant to John before you decided to vanish for two years?”
“Yes!”  John laughs, his face lighting up, turning towards Sherlock.  “The banker tried to make a run for it, got tripped up by the ballet dancer and face-planted straight in the stagnant fish pond!”  John’s laughter has become an endearing giggle and Sherlock can’t stop himself from joining in.  His deeper laugh mingling melodically with John’s.  “Jesus Christ, that water reeked!”
"Could... Could you help me into the bathroom please?" Sherlock glances at his hands rather than at John, hearing rather than seeing when John stands up, moving his chair to make a clear access to the small room that adjoins Sherlock's. He tenses when he feels a firm hand at his shoulder, alerting him to John's supportive presence. The hand remains just long enough for him to relax a little before John moves further along the bed, carefully untucking the sheets that encase Sherlock's long legs. Using the buttons on the bed, John raises Sherlock into a sitting position, before carefully easing his legs off the bed, one strong arm around Sherlock's back as he turns him until he is fully seated on the edge of the bed. John then positions Sherlock's arm over his shoulder whilst simultaneously ensuring that the morphine feed is gripped in Sherlock's other hand.
"I understand, love.  I'll be there right beside you, nose in the documents except when you need me to make tea, just like the good old days, hey?" John raises Sherlock's hand and presses a gentle kiss to his knuckles. "So, when are we to expect the twazzock then?"
"Oh God, John." The words are exhaled on a breath, his face appears troubled and  it's obvious Sherlock wants to say more, but the words are eluding him.
“A year or so ago I would have said no, not particularly, but more recently.”
Turning to face Sherlock, John is surprised to see worry etched into the expressive lines of Sherlock's face. What had happened in the house? What had he missed to be causing Sherlock such worry over him? Was he in danger? Was Lechner's killer at large? It took mere seconds for these questions to flash through John's mind and seemingly less time for Sherlock to know what he was thinking.
Gethin jokes. He visually checks Sherlock’s wound dressing, his face now serious. “All kidding aside, you really were incredibly lucky you didn’t re-open your wound with the stunt you pulled.
“I had half convinced myself that I had dreamed the events of last night.”  Sherlock admits, finally drawing slightly back.
“I’m sure your Gran would be proud of how strong you are, it’s not easy on the streets.”  Mrs Hudson pulls on a pair of thin latex gloves and dabs antiseptic solution onto some cotton wool. “Can I ask what happened to you tonight?”
Sherlock tries to arrange his limbs so that they are more comfortable and to relieve the pain in his forearm but on moving he becomes aware that he is tied securely to a chair.  A brief investigation with his fingertips and a study of the shape he is being forced into indicates an upright chair made from metal of some kind, any cushions that may have provided even minimal comfort have long been removed. His hands are forced behind his back and secured together with what feels to be plastic covered wire, it cuts into his wrists and he can feel the stickiness of drying blood between his palms. Sherlock concludes the pain in his forearm is either from a strain or a break, he moves slightly to test his limitations and almost vomits from the sudden flare of pain: almost certainly a break.  Sherlock closes his eyes and works on compartmentalising the pain; he will push it aside and deal with it at a later, more suitable, opportunity.  The pain starts to ebb and he is able to concentrate on how his legs are positioned. They are spread wide and his ankles have been tied with the same plastic covered wire to the rear chair legs, pulling his thighs down at an awkward angle.  Any efforts to escape will tip Sherlock straight on to his face on the concrete, causing him mild concussion at the minimum and he’d still be tied to the bloody chair for his troubles.  The final thing that registers is that he is still in the same naked state he had been when Mary had taken him.  The air in the warehouse is several degrees colder than the autumn air outside, bordering on frigid; depending on how long he remains in the warehouse hypothermia is as much of a danger to him as anything that the currently absent Mary may inflict.
Posting this chapter early as on my usual posting day I will be busy being a tourist in London.  Won't be doing any Sherlock related things, as such, (my kids would not be impressed!) but I am staying in Leinster Garden!
The question hangs heavy in the air. Mycroft's gaze is fixed on Sherlock as some silent conversation expressed only through their gaze and tiny twitches passes between them. Sherlock nods slightly before softening his gaze and returning his attention to Greg.
Sherlock tenses at John's words, he never should have said that John chose her because he knew what she was like; that was cruel and hurtful even by his standards. One day soon he will make amends to John for saying that, he knows now he was jealous of Mary having what he had always wanted.
We need to show him our continued support by attending this event he has organised.  You are well respected within your field and bizarrely I'm seen as something of a hero; by attending this event we will be seen to publicly endorse Mycroft and Mycroft’s actions.” John explains.
Sherlock instructs,
She had listened avidly to John retelling the events leading up to Sherlock’s fall from grace and his more literal fall from St. Bart’s.
Oh you clever lot! Guessing the twist (or at least some of it) ages ago!  I'd like to think it was my clever (eye roll) writing but I know it's just that we are an amazingly intelligent fandom!  I had huge fun reading all those lovely comments when you were guessing, I really wanted to jump up and down and talk it all through with you!  If you ever want a chat I am on twitter, dee@Thorntonsheart, just tag me or DM and I'll answer!
“The sea? I’m sorry, I don't understand.” Sherlock shakes his hand, his worried eyes on John, seeking answers. It pains him, the old ‘him’ Sherlock amends, to admit to not understanding something but he cannot make the connection with what John is trying to tell him.
"Were there any other experiences with men for you?" Sherlock really wants to ask about one man in particular but he bides his time.
Sherlock smiles.
“A brave speech, John my love, for a man on your own.”  Mary mocks.
"Is this where I should ask whether you want to talk about it?" John can hear the hesitation in Sherlock's tones, knows how hard it is for Sherlock to even ask the question and for the first time, in a long time, John finds he wants to confide totally in Sherlock.
Sherlock is reading through the newly found notebook. Pages full of his spidery writing lie around his feet and his pen races across his Moleskine as he translates the secrets that Empress Elisabeth consigned to their pages so many decades ago. His feet rest up on the dashboard and the bend of his legs makes the perfect rest for the books. His dark curls are unruly from where his hands have been running through them and his lower lip is chewed red. Sherlock in research mode is a Sherlock deeply absorbed. Which is why, when one long fingered hand reaches across and briefly squeezes John’s knee, he reacts with a gasp. This provokes a low chuckle from Sherlock, who continues with his work.
"You'll enjoy it, Mycroft. Men in well-fitted clothing, showing off their assets. Although, don't get too attached to the Sicilian, even if you can relate to him." Sherlock warns light-heartedly.
"Oh, god." John finally gives into the temptation of hiding behind his hands, granted it's only a slow swipe of palms over his face as he looks heavenwards, but the implicit meaning of the gesture is not lost on Mycroft Holmes.
Magnussen turns to look at a now wide awake Sherlock, his gaze a bizarre mix of amused and coldly reptilian.
John puts his glass down on a nearby table and shrugs out of his long leather coat, his blood now burning hot.
"Doesn't it seem odd to you that Lechner was walking around with a pocketful of dead fireflies?" As predicted, Sherlock rises to the bait, his quick silver eyes narrowing at John, exasperation clear in his features. "They're a clue John, a clue to where the jewels are now. Tomorrow we are going to visit Lechner's property here, locate the key to the code I found in the notes he made, and then find out where he has hidden the jewels."
For long minutes, they remain locked in each other's embrace. Light kisses are shared, tears of joy are silently wiped away and skin is smoothed. It is only at the sudden gurgle from the drain that they appear to remember where they are and what their original purpose was. They part to allow John to check the water temperature again and breathe a brief thanks for the unlimited supply of hot water in their flat before John helps Sherlock under the stream of water. In silence, John washes Sherlock's hair, running his short, strong fingers through the gently waving tendrils, carefully ensuring the shampoo and conditioner stays away from Sherlock's eyes. With quiet thoroughness, John washes Sherlock, rinsing his skin clean of their earlier encounter and sensitising Sherlock's skin to his touch. Sherlock reaches to return the favour and wash John's hair but the movement aggravates his wound and he sucks in a harsh breath. John winces in sympathy and quickly and efficiently cleans himself before getting out and grabbing one of the big, white, fluffy towels Mrs Hudson had obviously placed there. No chemical stains mar its threads, no burns blemish its colour. Gently, he encourages Sherlock out of the shower and dries him.  His touch is reverent and Sherlock sways into it, locking each touch and caress away for later investigation. John finally wraps Sherlock in the deep burgundy dressing gown that was hanging against the door before encouraging Sherlock to sit on the closed toilet. Swiftly, John towels himself dry and wraps the material around his waist. With quick efficiency, he collects his medical kit from under the sink and looks around the room, assessing the space and lingering moisture in the air.
The little impromptu get-together they’d had to celebrate Sherlock’s birthday, so many months before, doesn't really count as John had been furiously embarrassed about his break-down in front of Sherlock.  He was supposed to have been the strong one, the one with balanced emotions and yet he was the one that had been comforted by the so-called sociopath.  John shakes his head in an effort to clear it before grabbing a clean towel and his dressing gown and heading back down the stairs to their bathroom.
The words, ‘very affirming,’ in Sherlock’s rich voice play in John’s mind as he starts to lose his battle against sleep.
~~~~~~~
“But you want that with me, for it to be more?” Sherlock states, his voice drifting into a questioning tone.
“Mmmm,”  John sighs when they break apart again, his fingers trailing through Sherlock’s hair.  “As nice as this, I think we should head back in, grab some lunch whilst we can.”
Neither man hears when the door to their flat is unlocked, the door silently swinging open just enough to admit one person.
"John?" The hesitancy is clear in his voice and his fingers slow in John's hair. "What happens when we return home?"
He breathes heavily and finally stops his pacing.
"I want to taste the sweat from your skin; the saliva from your mouth." Sherlock's voice is a deep velvet richness and John can feel himself drowning in it. Hearing those words, in
He starts to lead the way to a private room when the squeak of a rusty wheel alerts them to the presence of another, uninvited, person.
Sherlock feels his eyes opening through no conscious effort of his own.  John is there, centring him, anchoring him.
"Oh, John!" Mary's eyes are bright with unshed tears and John allows it when she moves to press a kiss to his cheek.  Sherlock notices the way that John's shoulders twitch at the contact, worrying that Mary may have seen it too. No, her eyes are shut, the moisture of escaping tears clinging to her lashes.
Delightfully empty.
John's head whirls with thoughts and emotions even as his body moves through the waltz. The steps are now second nature to him, his muscles automatically moving them both through the simple routine. His mind is full of Sherlock.  The heat of his body, the way the simple flexing of Sherlock's shoulder muscles under his hand feels, the firm grip of their clasped hands. The distinctive scent of Sherlock is saturating each of John's breaths and he knows it is as close to heaven as he is likely to get; wrapped up in Sherlock, cocooned in his essence.  Smiling up at Sherlock, John is awed anew at his friend's ethereal beauty. Pale skin gracing features that would make Michelangelo weep with pleasure, full lips slightly parted, high, perfectly angled cheekbones and eyes sparkling with emotions that mirror John's own. Joy. Happiness ....... Completeness.
I decided whilst I was ‘away’ that I wouldn’t stand in your way anymore.”
He was still very woozy when I saw him last.
It's obvious Sherlock knows where he is going as he leads them directly to the crime scene. A quiet, semi wooded area, away from the main paths, the bright yellow police tape incongruous with the still-lush grass and late blooming flowers. Donovan sees them as they approach and lifts the tape ready for them to inspect the body. John notes that Sally still has not resorted to name calling, despite being on many cases with Sherlock since his return, and hopes that it will remain that way. Sherlock isn't always easy to work with, John realises this more than most, but he has never been the freak Sally accused him of being.
"Erm.  I think you've got the fundamentals now John. It's getting late."
“Bloody … fiddly little buggers…”  John mutters, finally looking down at what he is doing and making much better progress.  He pulls Sherlock’s shirt from his trousers and pushes it unceremoniously off his shoulders, letting it drop in a crumpled heap on the floor.  “Finally.”  The words are breathed against Sherlock’s chest seconds before warm lips start smothering heated kisses over exposed skin, eliciting heartfelt groans from both men.
Is rated M for later chapters.
“I would have it no other way.”  Sherlock narrows his eyes at John before announcing his first rule. “No sex on the first date, as a minimum, it would skew the data set.”  He raises his free hand, halting John’s anticipated protestations.  “Physical compatibility does not necessarily equate to emotional compatibility, you are looking for something long-term, not an easy shag.”  John hides a smile behind his mug, even after all these years he still finds it amusing to hear Sherlock’s posh tones drawl out such common vocabulary.  “Lust should not be mistaken for the possibility of love.  Masturbation in the shower before a date may help to address that problem somewhat.  Did you find it useful before?  I know it is something that you have always indulged in with a reasonable amount of regularity.”
“So, there’s nothing left to sort out.
Sherlock opens his mouth but his protestation is cut off at mid-point. "I have plans for you, Sherlock Holmes....". John kisses Sherlock, allowing it to deepen briefly before pulling back. "And I need you fighting fit for it."
"Holmes."
John fights not to let his jaw drop in shock when Greg leans over and squeezes Mycroft's lower thigh, letting his hand linger. John knew that there was interest on Mycroft's side but it is only now that John realises that Greg returns said interest. Mycroft flushes at Greg's touch but does not remove his hand, merely patting it before clasping his hands together once again in his own lap, looking very much like the cat that got the cream. A pampered ginger Tom!
"Is that going to be comfortable for you? Not too much pressure on your wound?" John whispers, sensing that Sherlock is already heading quickly towards sleep. Sherlock makes a small sound against his chest and John takes it to mean that Sherlock is quite all right where he is.
“God, John.
“Only yours.”  Sherlock retorts absentmindedly, his thoughts faraway on a cosy pub in Dartmoor, the sound of a ghostly hound baying in the distance.
"Those are the basic steps. Keep most of your weight on your toes. Again."
Sherlock looks younger too, his worries from the last few weeks wiped from his features as he sleeps.
The songs referred to here are;
Welcome to the penultimate chapter! I'm nervously chewing my fingernails in the corner! I hope you enjoy it.
“Hi,” It’s an inane answer but Sherlock finds it is all he can manage, that annoyingly reasonable part of his brain calling him an idiot, even as his lips curl into an answering smile.
Of course I give my permission.
“Is that why you were so confused when you first fully woke up?
The cold voice pulled Sherlock from his dark thoughts, suddenly surprising him that Mycroft had arrived unheard.  Sherlock turned to face his brother, pale eyes blazing and was gratified to see the taller man looking momentarily disconcerted. Mycroft focused his attention on the handle of his umbrella, swinging the length of it gently, before gazing up at Sherlock through lowered lashes.
Sherlock's breath has kicked up a notch and John's is matching it. Both men are utterly unaware of their surroundings, only of each other. A moan escapes John's throat and Sherlock flexes his hand hungrily against John's chest, feeling John's shirt wrinkle under his fingertips.
John carefully puts his glass back on the bedside unit and gives himself a moment to organise his thoughts.
"Right foot back. Diagonally back with left. Keep them a shoulder width apart. Right foot over to left. You've returned to the starting position."
"So you know how to snog exceptionally and I know how to shag amazingly. Christ, Sherlock, it's going to be quite the ride." John says breathlessly.
***********************
John shakes his head, still convinced that there is more to his dreams but unwilling to dwell on it currently. “All of your results and observations show that you are making an excellent recovery, John.
After finishing lunch they had decided to explore nearby Brighton, its classical architecture perfectly blending with the colourful shop fronts and equally colourful people.  Initially, John had debated on going for a paddle in the sea but had soon realised that although the air may feel unseasonably warm, the water would be very similar to plunging his feet into a bucket full of ice. That had been persuasion enough to leave the beachside and walk further in to the town.
Happy by my side
With the cool detachment that he has learned to employ in his roles both as soldier and doctor, John tucks his turmoil in to some deep recess of his mind, and turns his full attention on the man before him - absently observing that it is not only Sherlock who puts on a mask when events dictate.
(See the end of the chapter for
"The break-in was a ruse, designed to make it seem as if there was nothing new to discover there, but it was obvious that there
"No. I kissed a lot of people, male and female alike. The only time people complained was when they wanted to take it further and I refused. Luckily only a few ignored my 'no', but a quick, hard squeeze, twist and shove to their testicles was enough to put them off. Women, in my experience, have always been more understanding."
"Yes, John.  Death by sexual frustration.  Are you always this much of loquacious tease?"  Sherlock's words are gasped out, his eyes heavy with desire.
John glances back to see a very relaxed Sherlock sprawled in the bath, the tips of his hair floating in the water, his full lips quirked into a smirk.
"Er. Hi Sherlock. Did I wake you? Sorry.. I was just ....erm...." John's voice trailed off as a blush spread across his cheeks, his eyes briefly meeting Sherlock's own before becoming steadfastly fixed on the floor.
"Of course, Sir. Under what name shall I put it?" The receptionist is friendly, her English strongly accented but good and John is immediately put at ease. A few years ago he would have been tempted to chat her up, she's pretty in a homely way, sparkling green eyes, dimples that show when she speaks and warm chestnut brown hair. Now she catches his eye but makes no impression on either his heart or body, partly because he has been burned before, but mostly because his heart belongs elsewhere.
Sherlock felt his body responding again to the remembered heat between them and he let the moment take him over, his breath becoming shorter, shallower.  His eyes fluttered shut as images of a needy, wanting John flooded his mind; images that now merged with the memories of holding a warm, almost naked John against his own equally naked body.  Answering the needs of his body, Sherlock trailed his hand up the flat of his stomach and onto his chest, tracing over the areas where John had been pressed against him.  Desire flowed through him, its power unrelenting, pooling in his groin, hardening his flesh.  He ran his right hand over his neck, felt the frantic throb of his pulse against his fingertips, before running his fingers into his hair, wrapping them into his curls.  He allowed his left hand to drift over his body, gasping as it brushed over his nipple, the heat of his body searing into his fingertips, burning him with his own desire.  Swallowing deeply, his mind drifted further, imagining that it was John's hand trailing up his chest, his neck, over his full, lower lip.   Allowing a groan to escape, Sherlock traced a trembling finger over his upper lip, knowing how fascinated John was with his mouth, hoping one day he would have the opportunity to explore that fascination. He could almost sense John's presence, watching him touch himself or touching him with worshipful hands.  Achingly slowly, he trailed his left hand back down his neck, pressing more firmly over his collar bone, nails digging in slightly, leaving red trails over his chest and lower, onto his abdomen. He could feel his muscles flexing in anticipation, his penis now fully erect, throbbing and straining up.  The water droplets of the shower sent sparks of sensation through his overly sensitised skin, rivulets of water washing over his slender hips before running down his legs. With ease, he visualised John's reaction to him; wide open, arousal-darkened eyes, drinking in the view of Sherlock at his most vulnerable,  stuttered breaths escaping parted lips, hands caressing Sherlock's heated, eager flesh; arousal obvious, his erection sturdy, broad and proud, just like every other part of John.
“I don’t want to ‘hem’ you in John, but I can’t guarantee I won’t seek you out in my sleep.  I can sleep in the chair tonight?  Looks more comfortable than some of the mattresses I’ve slept on.  It wouldn’t be a hardship.”  Sherlock offers, meeting John’s gaze earnestly.
Sherlock nods, seemingly unsurprised at whatever information he has gathered.
Sherlock slides his hands up John's body, large palms splayed over John's heaving chest, the soft fabric of his t-shirt gathering in folds at Sherlock's wrists. John lets out an almost silent 'oh god' as Sherlock's fingertips brush over his hardening nipples. John removes his hands from Sherlock's body and raises his arms above his head. Silently imploring Sherlock to remove his t-shirt, a swift tug and the clothing is discarded. John lowers his arms, seemingly undecided on where to touch Sherlock now. The decision is made for him. Sherlock, deciding that he needs to feel John's chest against his own, wraps strong arms around him, pulling him close. The embrace could almost be considered chaste except for the long line of Sherlock's erection nudging insistently against John's pelvis, the tip just resting on the warm skin of John's abdomen. The kiss of skin against intimate skin pulls a moan from both men and Sherlock rocks his hips instinctively against John, rolling his hot face into the welcoming dip of John's neck. He realises now that he has dangerously under-estimated the effect of the touch of John's skin against his body.
is the most fascinating person to have ever existed. Slowly, he reaches for the shampoo, pouring some into a cupped palm before indicating with a quick finger flick for Sherlock to turn around. He eases Sherlock's head out of the direct spray of the shower and, taking a deep breath, begins to massage the shampoo through Sherlock's wavy hair. His senses are flooded with the citrus herbal smell of the shampoo and the silky feel of Sherlock's hair in his hands, it is so much longer wet than dry and John idly thinks he could spend hours just running his fingers through it. The suds form quickly in Sherlock's soft hair and soon the bubbles are running down Sherlock's back, John guides him back under the spray and runs his fingers through Sherlock's mane, rinsing the suds out. A soft sigh escapes Sherlock as John's steady hands trail through his hair, the first sound to leave him since his sheet had fallen to the floor. The noise seems almost momentous and John vows to draw more sounds from him.
Frowning, John rubs at the nape of his neck; he knows it's a self-soothing gesture, a fairly useless one, but he's unable to stop. "No. That's not possible. The jewels were inspected by experts, experts from the Austrian government, not ours. They passed all the tests; there was no question of their authenticity."
