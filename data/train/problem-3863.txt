Pulling up at Dean’s house, Gabe looked a little down, and that was not what Sam had been expecting from the normally rambunctious man. “What’s up Buttercup?” Okay, so Sam wasn’t as funny as Gabe, he never claimed to be, but it did at least make the other man smile just enough that he felt better about inviting him back. He didn’t want Gabe to think that he was just wanting to hook up after all the conversations that they had about his brother only wanting the same with everyone around them. It didn’t seem like that would be something that Gabe was looking for, at least that was Sam’s thinking.
Of course, the first one to be announced was Dean, but then again, Cas had never had any doubt he would be selected to go to the finals. The second one who was announced was Betty. Again, it wasn’t too much of a surprise, as she had been a finalist for the last ten years, though never being able to beat Mary or Naomi. She was convinced this was her year, and she once again stated that as she climbed the stairs to the stage. Then, to Cas’s total surprise, his name was called. He had made it to the finals. Of course, it had been mostly Dean’s teaching that had gotten him there, but he was happy to have made it, nonetheless.
That question seemed to catch Gabe off guard, “What? Um, no not really. I’m just honestly surprised at how they interact with one another. I guess what bothers me is that I’ve never seen Cas act that way around anyone, he’s usually so closed off. Dean, on the other hand, I have never seen him take anything serious, but he seems to be taking things with Cas very seriously. I guess I just wasn’t expecting that.”
“You just have to be careful until we can get this figured out. I know that you don’t know how to be subtle about anything, but if you don’t want the whole town finding out, then you are going to have to be.” Dean felt properly chastised and decided that they needed a topic change, and walked into the kitchen.
There were times Gabriel was a complete horn dog, or at least he came across that way. Sam wasn’t really sure if Gabe was hitting on him or if that was just Gabe in general, but it was enough to get him thinking more about the short little jerk than the conversation he needed to have with his brother. So, when he pulled into Dean’s driveway he had absolutely no Idea on how to deal with his mom and Naomi.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He tries to comfort me, placing a hand on my shoulder and telling me that I’m ready and that I can do this. I know we have practiced all that we are able to, so I push my fears down and nod. Then we make our way to the testing center. As we walk into the room, Lucifer is there. My stomach turns simply at the thought of being in the same room as him, let alone actually interacting with the man. I decide that I have more important things to focus on as I listen to Cas reminding me that they can see my hallucinations on the giant screens around the room, and that I need to take my time and work through each of my fears. I snort as I reply that if I’m too good they will kill me and if I’m too slow that I will die. He grins, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. He simply says right, and good luck. I wish that he could be in my fear landscape with me, but this is something that I have to do on my own.
Chapter 10: New Beginnings
I tried talking to him, but he made me feel about the size of an ant. He acts like I have done something to personally offend him. When I asked him a question he replied, “What makes you think that you can talk to me?” I couldn’t help myself, and my sarcasm came through, “Must be because you are so approachable.” He didn’t comment back, so I don’t think he hates me as bad as he acts like he does. I mean, he snapped on Benny when he made a jab at his name after everyone jumped into the hole in the roof. I’m not sure what the problem is, but I intend to find out. There are so many rumors about him going around, maybe he just likes to keep his privacy.
“Okay, so what do we do about it? I’m assuming that’s why you are here, that you have a plan and need my help.” Naomi was always a smart one and she figured this out fairly quickly.
We are lined up in four lines and people are getting it administered. I can’t help but to freak out a little. I have to find Cas, he’ll know what to do. I ask if anyone has seen him, but no one has. I go to look for him, but before I can make it out of the hall Uriel comes up talking about how I should have been first in line. He says that’s okay though and has someone come up and inject the serum where we are. He makes a comment about it hurting like a bitch, and that now I’m really one of them, and just walks away, leaving me standing there rubbing my neck and wondering what the hell just happened.
Mary, having heard what was happening with Naomi, decided that it would draw more press to the winner’s bakery if they passed on the feudal torch, so to speak, to the next generation. She herself had two sons, one who had gone to culinary school in France and was an excellent cook, and one who was a lawyer and definitely did not follow in his mother’s footsteps. The decision on who she would ask was an easy one for her; now she just had to convince Dean to do the bake off.
“Okay, as I was saying, we don’t want to have to hide. So, to me that says what we have means something. I know it’s quick, and not something anyone is going to approve of, but I think he’s different. He told me he had feelings for me when we were younger, and those never went away. If that’s the case Gabe, then he’s loved me as long as I have loved him.
Cas hadn’t meant his statement to be chastising, but it was apparent by Dean’s face that he had taken it that way. “I guess I just have an idea, and maybe a goal. What do I need to turn that into a plan?”
“You don’t really want me to do too well, though, do you Dean? If you teach me well enough that I win, you don’t get what you want out of this. If you don’t teach me well enough, then I don’t get what I want. This probably wasn’t the best idea, was it?” Cas really didn’t think Dean had thought this through. He really hadn’t.
I know that he is just avenging his wife, but it still feels good that he has my back. He goes around the corner first. This is the John Winchester that I’ve heard Bobby talk about. The warrior that went out past the fence and was banned for it. He just walked straight towards the guards firing his stolen weapon like he was born using it. I’m not going to waste the opportunity. We all follow after, shooting the guards as we approach the room. Once they are all down, I make my way around the corner, but as I look back I notice Bobby leaning down, over my father’s body. It seems I have lost him as well today. This will bother, I know it will, but right now I have to push on. I ask Bobby to keep an eye on Sammy and tell him that I’m going in. No one tries to follow me, but they don’t try to stop me either. I guess that is something.
We practice daily for the fear simulation. I have one that has me running up to my friends, only to be stopped by a glass wall. I look around and I’m back in the box that is filling up with water. As I’m looking around at the walls and ceiling, I somehow end up in a dark room and the friends that were just there are gone. I’m yelling for help and beating on the walls, but no one comes. When the water gets all the way to  the top I remember that it isn’t real. I use my finger and tap through the glass, just like I did the first time.
Naomi was determined though, and was still calling him at least once an hour to make sure he didn’t need her help. He may have needed it, but he didn’t want it. He wasn’t really sure he could handle hearing how badly he needed to beat Dean Winchester anymore in this lifetime, let alone during this bake off.
I don’t know why they decided to take me out of sight, around the buildings, but I’m very glad that they did. Just as they were about to shoot me, I was already kneeling in the dirt, I heard shots. The one with the gun goes down first, then one by one, the guards around me go down as well. I look up and over towards the trees and see the same woman that had been at the station when we were loading supplies. I see my mother running at me yelling. She seems afraid that I have been injured, but once she sees that I haven’t she takes several weapons from her coat and ankle, giving them to me. Then we take the weapons that the guards had been using and make our way further down the track. It hits me then that she is extremely brave. I state more than ask, that she was Dauntless. She gets a grin on her face and says that it suited her well today.
When I get back to the dorm area, everyone greets me with a pat on the back, or a good job. Everyone that is except Caleb, he comes up telling me about a story that has been released about my family. It talks about how there are problems in Abnegation, emphasized by both my brother and myself defecting. It went on talking about how there must be something going on there for all the children to be leaving their family and faction to go to another faction, even if their tests come up as Abnegation. That’s crazy, but it is one of the main reasons that I didn’t want to leave. That puts pressure on Bobby and Ellen that they really don’t need or deserve. They were wonderful parents, even to us, who weren’t theirs by blood. That’s just the kind of people they are. Bobby always told me that family doesn’t end with blood. This was always said when I was feeling down and like I didn’t really belong.
After Cas had tasted the many different items, they sat down at the computer to start on a business plan. “Do you have a plan or simply an idea? A Lot of people say that they have a plan when what they really have is a goal and an idea. It isn’t a bad start, but there is a difference.”
We catch up to the train as it is leaving the platform, and Cas trips the door release. Our little group runs to catch up and board the train. Charles is lagging behind this time, and even though the decision has to be hard for Cas, he helps his father board the train. I’m the last one, because I wanted to make sure that everyone made it. Cas goes to reach for my arm and I tell him that I’ve got it. He huffs, tells me that he knows I do, and pulls me up onto the train as well. We stand there for a moment on the outside of the train, just looking at each other, but eventually we climb inside with the others. He’s hugging me, and I don’t want to let go.
“Okay. I can’t say I understand how you feel about Dean, because I have never been very fond of him, but if you say this is important to you, then I support you. The biggest problem I see is mom. She is never going to let you be with a Winchester; not as long as her and Mary are still feuding. To her, the most important thing is the bakery, and that feud has kept people coming in for years.” Gabe felt for his brother, but he couldn’t see a way around their mother.
Meeting up with Cas was always something that seemed to excite Dean. He didn’t like having to keep this thing with Cas a secret, but he couldn’t deny that sneaking around was somewhat exhilarating. When Dean made his way around the side of the trailer that was still set up where they had been taking down the rides, Cas grabbed him and pulled him into a kiss that said it had been a lot longer than a few hours since they had last seen each other. Of course, they hadn’t been able to properly say goodbye to each other this morning, and that’s why Dean completely understood that Cas wanted to meet before the contest started and they had to appear to hate each other.
This guy is crazy! Cas looked like he was intrigued by me as well. That’s good to know. We are evidently going to be playing some crazy capture the flag war game. The bullets are mini sims that feel like you are really being shot by a bullet. At least there is some good news. Cas chose me for his team. Uriel thinks he’s trying to gain sympathy for when we lose, but I think he wanted me on his team for some other reason.
Dean left first, but he didn’t want to. They couldn’t be seen leaving together; hopefully no one was paying enough attention to notice it anyway. Walking up to his brother once inside the competition building, told him that he was wrong, and there was someone who was definitely watching them. “Dean, you have to be more careful. I saw you head around the side of the truck over there, and that wouldn’t have been a problem if Cas hadn’t gone that way a few seconds earlier. You know his brother is here, right? There are more eyes on the two of you than you think. Gabe started that way, and I had to distract him. You owe me, by the way.”
Of course, when we get back to the compound they want to start our stage two training. Seeing my mom, and her warnings are making me nervous.While I wait my turn, I am terrified. My leg is bouncing and I keep looking around the room. The first person has been taken back and I am concerned at what will happen when I go in.
Both of their mothers always emphasised how important it was to keep their recipe for the finals a secret, so they couldn’t believe Betty was talking about hers on the news like it was no big deal. That was, until Cas started yelling at the television. So, of course, that caused Dean to pay more attention to what was being said on the screen.
We are like the factionless now, we’ve left everything behind. We found ourselves though, and each other. Tomorrow we may have to fight again, but for now we will ride the train to the end of the line, and then, we’ll jump.
Pulling up to the house Naomi had to have known they were there. They had taken Dean’s car, because he honestly never wanted to go anywhere without it, but it was really loud and would definitely give away who was there before they even got in the door. This was why when they walked inside Gabe was surprised that his mother wasn’t there waiting to start in on them. “Mom? Are you here? We need to talk.”
He knocks me onto the ground again, but this time there’s a gun. I point it at him to start with, but I remember that it wouldn’t do any good that way. Everyone is surrounding us now, he’s made his way over top of me, but I have an idea. I turn the gun on myself. He takes the opportunity for what it is, grabbing the gun. I tell him over and over that it’s me, and it’s okay, and that I love him. He closes his eyes and goes to turn away, just like he did in his fear landscape, and this is where I lose if I’m not careful. I grab his face, turning his head back and tell him to look at me. It’s really me. Then, there’s a shift, the look of recognition crosses his face and he says my name.
“Right, no, you are right. I shouldn’t have asked Sam to lie for me anyway. It would definitely make things better if we could figure something out.” Dean leaned his head against Cas’s, and they just stood there breathing for a few minutes.
Naomi, while gathering ingredients for the day's scones,  slipped in the water that had built up on the concrete floor, hitting her wrist on a metal shelving unit in the store room, breaking the radius. Of course, it had to be on her dominant hand, and less than a month before the bake off.
Cas took it as his job to keep Dean under control, which was turning out to be a difficult task. “Dean, please just leave him alone. He didn’t mean anything by it; he’s just looking out for me. Why did you have to drink tonight, anyway? You knew we were supposed to be talking about our mothers and that Gabe was coming with me.”
When Cas mentioned the crust, Dean looked back to the tv. There, scrolling across the bottom, was what Betty had planned to make, and while the overall pie was not what Dean had in mind, the type of crust was definitely familiar.
Part four: Initiate
Cas finds me and tries to talk to me, but I just want to be alone right now. The guilt for causing him to kill himself is eating me alive and I just want to be able to break down where no one can see me. He follows though and tells me that he heard about Garth and that he is sorry. He knows that we were close before last night, but he missed the exchange in the commons earlier, he doesn’t know that I told him I would kill him. He doesn’t know that I flat out refused his apology. He doesn’t know that it was my fault.
After another round of staring between us he asks why I say that. I can’t help the chuckle that escapes my throat as I tell him that he already knows why. He’s been asking me questions that tell me he has known for a while, but I haven’t been able to tell him anything. I don’t tell him now either, but he nods, confirming that he already knew. I tell him that as soon as all the others find out that I’m going to be dead, but he interrupts me before I can say anymore. He tells me that he isn’t going to let that happen. This is another moment that I believe he sees something in me that I am trying to keep hidden. He has figured out my biggest secret, maybe he knows how I really feel about him as well.
“Sure.” It was, after all, what Castiel had been thinking anyway. He needed to work on his baking, just in case Dean wasn’t planning on helping him in the next round. It was the finals, and if he made it that far, Cas might just be on his own.
Dean still didn’t see Cas, but what he did see stopped him in his tracks, just as he was stepping off the last step. There on the couch was his gargantuan brother, sprawled out. That wasn’t what stopped him though. Sammy sleeping on the couch was something that he had gotten used to seeing every time his brother stayed over. The short little lump laying beside him, however, was definitely a new addition.
There, I ran into the very first person that I had to fight in our training session. He kicked my butt that first day, but I am able to take him down this time. I guess it helps when I have a tangible goal that I can see. It probably doesn’t hurt for me to know that if I don’t succeed I’m gone. There’s no way around that. I can see Cas and Uriel talking to each other down below. He just ran right in and gave us cover. He might be one of the craziest people that I have met, not in a bad way. He’s very protective, I can see that easily. He’s smart though too. It’s like he only allows certain people to see certain things about him. It’s really not a bad idea. I grab the flag once the guy is down and go out onto the platform in the building.
The factions were set up after the war so people know their role in society. Amity are friendly and always smiling, they grow the food that everyone eats. Erudite are smart, they are the teachers and scientists. Candor are truthful and are the judges and lawyers. Dauntless are brave and they are the protectors. Abnegation are selfless and they are the government. Bobby and Ellen are in Abnegation. That is why our parents left us with them as infants. They said that Sam and I were just babies when we were left, so they assume us to be twins. We look enough alike that we are definitely siblings, but there are a lot of differences too. There are enough personality differences that I am terrified that we will be split up after the ceremony.
They’re still sitting there as we leave the hall. I can’t think too much on that now. I have to make it in my new faction. I have to focus all of myself on making it in. I don’t want to be factionless. When we leave the town center, the other Dauntless initiates start running down the street. It does seem that they, we, run everywhere. We reach the poles where the train runs over head and they all start climbing. The only time I have ever been on a train was to load the food for the factionless that is taken deeper into the city. I haven’t been on one that was moving. The train doesn’t stop though. It just flies by, and they are jumping on. I have to run to catch up, and even then I only catch the last car before it passes a section of platform that is so deteriorated that I would have fallen through.
“Mom? Can you come in here for a minute? We really need to talk to you, it’s important.” Dean wasn’t sure where his mother was, but if he had to hazard a guess, she was probably in the kitchen doing something that her doctors wouldn’t approve of.
Before we can talk more about this, someone shouts behind me and she is gone. I can’t believe that I met my mother. She seems to know that I’m divergent. I wonder if that’s because she is as well. I need to be really careful. My parents have never come to me before about anything, so this must be really important.
Sam grumbled at this and turned to look at his brother. “You really are obnoxious in the morning, do you know that? It’s your fault we weren’t able to talk last night. You can at least allow me the time to be functioning before you start in on me.”
Apparently no one was surprised that the two of them were showing up together, and that kind of made sense because he was fairly certain that Naomi and Mary had ridden together and he knew for a fact that Sam and Gabe had left the house together. There was no reason to assume that they wouldn’t show up as a pair as well, it was only logical that Dean and Cas would also arrive together. The feud seemed to be a thing of the past and everyone was talking about their secret romance that Betty was sure to have perpetuated.
Part Twelve: War
Originally Castiel thought his family’s bakery was the best place to meet, so that is what they agreed on. They also both agreed they would keep this secret because there was no way their families would agree to them working together. Their mothers couldn’t even stand to be in the same room, let alone speak civilly to one another. Now, however, he was wondering if this was even a good idea at all.
“Come inside with me?” Dean knew that he should say no, he knew that he needed to make sure he got some rest for tomorrow, but he also noticed that Gabe hadn’t made it back to Cas’s house and he really didn’t want to walk in on anything at his own house. It wasn’t like he didn’t want to go inside with Cas, they had been dancing around each other both figuratively and literally ever since they started this.
“I see you watching our brothers quite a bit, do you have a problem with them being together?” Sam had learned that being blunt was usually the best way to get an answer. It left little room for someone to wiggle out of answering by directing the answer to something else that was said. He hoped that Gabe didn’t have a problem with them, because he was starting to realize that maybe his brother wasn’t the only one with a thing for a Novak, but he wasn’t going to risk the friendship that he had built with Gabe to find out. That meant that he had to see where Gabe’s head was before he told him anything about himself.
Winning the bake off wasn’t some magic cure all, but it did make it a little easier on both the Winchesters and the Novaks. It might not have been in the way that they originally had planned, but with their families not arguing anymore, it opened a lot of doors for possibility. Three years down the road and the families had undergone some changes. Not only emotionally, but financially and physically as well.
“Stop! It’s true, and obviously we haven’t said that to each other, but I know that’s how I feel. I haven’t been able to admit that to anyone out loud until just now, but I have loved Dean for over a decade without knowing he felt the same way. How can I not believe this is different? I know his reputation, and I know what our family thinks of him, but I can’t help how I feel, and if he feels the same way, then I can’t see a single thing that is more important.”
“I know, Sammy, but I don’t care what mom says. You were old enough when all this started, you should remember it wasn’t Cas who was the problem. He didn’t have any choice but to go along with his mom, just like us. He isn’t bad!” Dean didn’t mean to raise his voice, but his brother coming in and finding him laying on the couch with his arms around ‘the enemy’ had not gone over well, and Sam had been giving him a hard time since the second Cas left the house. Dean guessed he should be grateful Sam had waited that long.
The women described what they had tried so far, some of the ideas were shot down by the boys, but others seem to be taken well, they added them to the list and started working on making something that the people of Lawrence had never had before. It was challenging, because there are so many different ways to make pumpkin pie, but they had decided that the best way to beat Betty was to be very different and yet hold a little bit of that classic pumpkin pie taste with it. It was a challenge, but they felt that it was one that they were up for.
I find myself looking at his lips as these thoughts are going through my head, wondering what it would be like to kiss him. I look up and meet his eyes and it’s like he was reading my mind. He leans in capturing my lips with his own. His hands go up and encase my face, allowing me to feel safe, but at the same time, I’m terrified. He continues kissing me, running his hands up and down my back and into my hair. I finally give into the urge to run my fingers through his dark messy hair, and it’s just as soft as I imagined it would be. We continue kissing for a while, moments, hours, I’m really not sure, but I place my finger over his lips and back away. I don’t want him to think that I’m not interested, but I have never been with anyone, and I tell him that I don’t want to move too fast. I’m smiling and he’s smiling, and even if it bothers him that this is all I’m willing to do right now, he says that it’s okay. He smirks again and tells me that he already has his spot on the floor. This causes me to breathe out a laugh. I’m so glad that he understands, but I’m still afraid that he will go too far too fast. I know it’s irrational, he’s always took my lead, even when I didn’t realize it, but it’s something that is there anyway.
I go out ahead of the others, and I can tell that none of them are Dauntless, because they hang back and let me check that the coast is clear. I gather weapons from the fallen Dauntless that are littering the streets outside of the hideout. I get them onto the train and give them weapons. When we are getting close to the rooftop where we jumped the first day of initiation, I tell them to get ready. John, my father, asks what now. I tell him that he isn’t going to like it. I open the door and look at all of them, then as we reach the roof, I jump. They follow, one by one, Charles of course going last. We run across, until we reach the end and the hole that we had to jump through. I tell them that there is a net at the bottom, don’t think, just jump, then I do just that. I climb up and jump first.
Then Sam’s name is called. He placed a hand on my shoulder and looked into my eyes. I try to express understanding. I know he will not be Abnegation any longer. I hope he knows that I respect the choice that he is making. I wonder yet again if maybe he had the same problems with his testing that I did. I can’t ask though. He chooses Erudite. I knew that it was coming, but Lucifer’s grin is still enough to make me worry. He looks as if he wants to welcome Sam into his arms, but settles for a handshake. I really don’t like him. Bobby and Ellen are holding hands and they look so sad. Ellen tells me that she loves me. My family is not one to say those words. We aren’t overly expressive, but if they are going to be said now is the time, I guess.
He asks what happened to me last night. I’m really not sure what I was going to tell him. It doesn’t matter anyway, because Garth chose that moment to come up and try to apologize. He is crying and has cuts all over his face, but when he asks if I could ever forgive him, all I can see is his face as he’s trying to push me over the ledge. I’m angry and I’m scared and all I can say is that if he ever comes near me again that I will kill him. The friendship that we built while we were going through the first stage of training, has been completely destroyed by one decision. I tell him that he is a coward, while thinking that being scared is what is making me stand my ground right now. Maybe Cas wasn’t completely wrong about me after all. Garth simply looks at me with a sad expression on his face for a moment and turns and walks away.
Everything was fine until a friend of John’s was killed out in the fields. The Dauntless that was assigned to our area was assisting someone else and we were left vulnerable. After that, John hated Dauntless, and he hated the things outside of the wall even more. He would go hunting whenever he was able, which is how we ended up here. I just never could blame the Dauntless guard. It wasn’t his fault, but things happen and I just try to avoid John when he goes on one of his binges, then he just disappears for days and when he comes back, he is fine.
“Well, Sammy, to tell you the truth, he’s been shooting some really meaningful glances at Dean today. I just don’t want him to get hurt. I remember your brother’s reputation. I was in school with him, remember? And regardless of what he might think, not everyone in town thinks he’s quite as straight as he wants them to. Cas is just different; he doesn’t see the risks like I do. I don’t want him getting hurt, that’s all.” Gabe ended by repeating himself, and Sam saw that as very telling. He didn’t think that Gabe would be against their brother’s being together if he knew that Dean wasn’t just playing Cas.
Going into testing they line you up in alphabetical order. So Sam is, of course, standing beside me as we enter the doors that will determine the rest of our lives. Inside is Joanna, Bobby and Ellen’s daughter. She can’t show favoritism and I wonder how she was even able to conduct my testing. She says hello and leads me to a chair in the center of the room. The room itself is made up of mirrored walls. That is not something that I am used to, considering that we aren’t allowed mirrors in Abnegation. I look away, because I have been accused of looking in reflective surfaces too long and don’t want to bring trouble to Bobby or Ellen.
Dean was trying really hard not to laugh at Castiel; it was simply too adorable, and in the end, he couldn’t hide the snicker. “Maybe stir with the spoon instead of the mixer. Here, let me show you something.” And, just like that, Dean took over Castiel’s training.
Part Eight: The Red Line
Mary’s face was something that Dean really couldn’t read. He knew that she wouldn’t be happy about Cas because of the feud. He also knew that she wouldn’t be happy because of their fight when she found out that he was into Cas before, but he was hoping that her realizing that he was still into Cas and that nothing had changed would help her understand, at least a little bit, how important he was to Dean.
Waking up beside Cas was something that, while new, was also something that Dean just knew that he would come to love. The fluff of dark hair that was tickling his nose, the warmth of the body against his and the smell of coffee coming through the door that they either left open or someone had opened. The last was what finally woke him up enough to get dressed and go down the stairs.
Sam internally cringed at his mistake; he had forgotten Gabe hadn’t mentioned where he was staying. “Dean told me.” There was no use in hiding it. They were hopefully going to be having a serious conversation tonight that included all four of them.
Those of us that passed are now working. We have to unload the train and load it into trucks. Benny thinks that this is a crappy celebration, but I understand that it is supposed to help keep us disciplined. There is a blonde woman behind a stack of crates. She catches my attention and waves me over.
It turns out that what they had come up with was a whipped pumpkin silk with an almond bark crust and garnished with whole almonds along the top. It looked amazing, and with Sam’s idea of using almond milk in the pie, it was a little more healthy as well. Dean wasn’t too sure how he felt about a healthier pie, even if it wasn’t really all that healthy, but went along with it because it was definitely something different than they had seen in any of the past years competitions.
We pass a couple arguing with the Dauntless, at the same moment that a shot goes out. Cas grabs my arm having me continue. He tells me to just keep moving, that there is nothing I can do. He then asks me where my house was. We seperate from the group and make our way to the tiny house that was my home for most of my life. We enter with our guns raised, just like everyone else that is a part of Dauntless, but that is where the similarities end with us. The moment that we are in the door, the guns are down and we are searching for my family. We split up a bit and continue searching. When we still don’t find them anywhere in the house, he asks where else they might be. The problem is that I have no idea.
We climb down and join the others. Once we let them know where the other team is they look to us on where to go next. Cas even asks me what the plan is. I slip into the leader roll, one that isn’t that hard for me to take on even though it isn’t really something that I’ve had to deal with. It almost comes naturally, especially with him by my side. I tell them that we need to split up into two groups. I’ll take a group up the side while the other group engages Uriel. We get inside and they yell out that they can see us. We run, Cas leads one group straight into the fire fight. My group goes along the side up to the watchtower that I saw their flag in.
“Aren’t they cute? I wonder if this is how Sam first felt walking in here and finding us, or if he only let himself get mad. I can’t bring myself to be upset. Gabe hasn’t looked that relaxed in as long as I can remember.” Cas’s gruff morning voice was even hotter when he was trying to be quiet. Since he was still here, the thought that came to mind was domestic, and Dean had to have a taste of Cas this morning, being that he hadn’t messed things up with the other man.
Part Six: Capture the Flag
There were tables and vendors set up for those who were participating and those who were watching. It was almost like a part of the fair itself continued on. Dean was walking down one of the aisles, when he saw Cas talking to his brother Gabriel. Apparently, everyone was in town for the competition. He was honestly surprised Naomi hadn’t had Gabe step in for her instead of Cas; he was actually a baker, after all. It would have made more sense. Dean was rather glad she hadn’t, though. Without everything happening just the way it had, he probably never would have gotten his chance with Cas.
Just then Charles Shurley came up to us and asked if I was followed. I can’t help the incredulous look I give him. Now that I know what he did to his son, especially a son as wonderful as Cas, I can’t even stand to look at the man. He changes the way he words it, asking if there are soldiers outside. Ah, he’s wanting to get away. I tell him that no, it’s clear. Sam is crying now, saying that he should have believed me, and that he left as soon as he realized what was going on. He asks why Dauntless are fighting for Erudite. I explain to them that they don’t know what they’re doing, they are under a simulation. I tell them that I need to wake them up, and to do that I need to get into Dauntless. Charles says that it’s impossible, it’s a fortress, it’s not going to happen. He talks like he has any say in what I’m going to do. I look him in the eye and tell him that I can get us there.
I think back to Lucifer being at Dauntless and decide that yes, I need to be really careful. I’m also going to have to find a way to get to Sam and make sure that he is okay. I haven’t talked to him since coming here. I really need to fix that situation. I will find a way soon to talk to him.
It’s now been brought to my attention that he is right behind me and that makes me nervous. He says that we are high enough, but I disagree. We need to be higher, I can’t see the other team’s base from here. I start to climb again, but he stays where he is until I stop to see what he’s doing. I ask if he’s alright, but he just looks around and then down at the ground. He looks anywhere he can that keeps him from looking at me. I ask if he’s afraid of heights, well, more like tell him. He informs me that everyone is afraid of something. I honestly didn’t think that he was afraid of anything, and I told him this in return. When I turned around and started climbing again, he huffed out a laugh and followed me once again.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The choosing ceremony is tomorrow. I have no idea what I’m going to do. I have a feeling that Sam is going somewhere besides Abnegation. I definitely don’t want to be here if he is not. I love Bobby and Ellen as if they were blood, but I don’t think that I could remain in Abnegation without Sam. He’s the one that keeps me in line. He keeps me selfless. Without him I would probably be kicked out myself. I’d rather take a chance on a faction that suits me better, I just don’t know which one that is. I’ll spend what time I have left in Abnegation with Sam and Bobby and Ellen, and hope that something comes to me while I sleep. After dinner Sam says something kind of strange. He says that I need to think of the family tomorrow, but also about myself. I’m pretty sure he knows that I’m leaving Abnegation tomorrow and he’s telling me that it’s okay. Even with as gruff as Bobby can be he told us he loves us. I think he knows.
I keep to myself that they may, in fact, be my old family as well. The way things are going I’m having a hard time keeping away from the bottom of the leaderboard. The first time I fought someone, he was twice my size. Uriel set up new rules yet again, saying that no one taps out. We fight until someone can’t continue. I bet you can guess who couldn’t continue. I fought, but he fought dirtier. This landed me at the bottom of the board, not last, but close enough. After a rough day, Benny suggested tattoos. That is something that no other faction does, so I agreed.
I nod and that’s all it takes. He swings around firing at the guards that are still gathered around us. They scatter and Lucifer yells to finish it, and then tries to do something on the screen that they seem to be putting in orders for the sim. Cas is amazing, using bodies of the guards as shields, while trying to get to the ones that are running the simulation. I manage to get a knife from one of the guards, and I look up to see Lucifer looking at a screen with Abnegation lined up like a slaughter, with Dauntless spread out holding them at gunpoint. Whatever he is doing, he’s frantic, and it unnerves me. The Dauntless are having the members of Abnegation kneel. They are about to start murdering them all. I can’t let that happen, so I throw my stolen blade and land it in Lucifer’s hand. It lands square in the middle, and I tell him to shut down the sim. He of course says no, these people keep underestimating me. I look up at the screen and see Benny pushing Abnegation members to the ground, completely unaware of what he’s actually doing, and I snap.
I go down to the common area, where we eat, and find Benny. The first thing that he does is ask about the sweater I’m wearing. I wouldn’t dare tell him that it belongs to Cas. I would never live that down and that is the last thing that I am thinking about right now, even though the reminder does make me smile. I didn’t think that I was capable of that right now. I guess I was wrong.
“Okay, what do we have so far?” Cas was trying to get things back on track, Gabe was acting weird and Dean and Cas were off doing their own thing. Surprisingly enough their mothers hadn’t said anything and seemed to be working well together at creating a masterpiece. He, himself, had been too distracted trying to figure out what was going on with Gabe to be much help, but maybe they could all get their attention back on the recipe making. He could try to figure it out later.
Cas, Sam, and Gabe were all sitting around the island in the kitchen, watching Dean cook. If he hadn’t been doing this practically his whole life, he might have been a little self conscious. “Alright, guys, if everyone’s going to be in here watching me, we might as well talk. Or put on the tv, and we can see what’s on the news while I cook, then start when no one is distracted.”
Castiel, her son, was in the bakery and saw what happened to his mother. He quickly took her to the doctor, but the news was not good for Naomi. She would not be able to use her arm for at least six weeks, and that was if she rested it the way the doctor suggested. If she tried to continue the way she had been, it would take even longer to heal.
“Don’t forget, you owe me a night of spreadsheets and ledgers.” Dean hadn’t meant for that to sound so flirty; it had just happened, and he could have slammed his head into the door because it simply caused Cas to grin at him and do that little head tilt thing Dean found so endearing.
Cas was agreeing before Dean had even finished talking. He needed some time with Dean as badly as Dean seemed to need the time with him. “Let’s go before he gets back. He seems to be interested in your brother; maybe that will keep him distracted for a little while.” With that, they left the fair ground and headed out into the orchard.
When we got back to the dorm area, the first person that came out was still sitting there rocking back and forth, while we discussed what it was like under the simulation. Benny has a fear of insects apparently, and was explaining how he was completely covered by them, they were in his ears and his mouth, they were just everywhere. Garth starts talking about someone that was so panicked that he had a heart attack and almost died. Benny mentions that I didn’t seem to have a problem at all, even though I deny that and explain how awful it was they still don’t seem to believe me. Noone came close to my time, which they remind me of again.
“Come on, let’s win this bake off and we can spend as much time as you want together, inside the bed and out.” With his parting words, Dean stood up from the bed and started gathering his things that he had strewn around the room when they came in last night. Cas continued to sit in bed and sip his coffee, apparently Dean was going to get first shower this morning.
“You do know that this disqualifies you from this year’s bake off, right?” The announcer did not look saddened in the least with this information. “You need to go on now, and get off the stage.” Betty did as she was directed, but was very displeased with the outcome.
Dean leaned in, kissing Cas. He seemed almost as eager as Cas had earlier, but he wasn’t worried about this ending; he was just struggling with not being able to kiss Cas whenever he wanted to. “Come with me for a little while. We can go somewhere he won’t be able to find us.”
Now, though, he wasn’t really sure what to do. He had a cup of coffee for Cas that he didn’t want to get cold and there was another cup waiting downstairs for Gabe. He also wanted a chance to talk to Cas before they left for the final round. Deciding that he really didn’t want to wait, Dean knocked on the door. When the conversation seemed to pause he let himself in.
“I thought that you wanted to know where Gabe and I came into this, it may not be as exciting as Dean and Cas getting together, but we wanted to help bring our families back together. There was a time that we were all practically family and yes things change, but Gabe and I have talked about it, we really think that these two idiots over here love each other. They shouldn’t have to stay apart because of some feud that is not even between them.”
“Woah, Cas what’s going on?” Dean was trying to calm Cas down enough that he could actually talk to him, instead of just yelling in the direction of the television.
I ask him what he means and he tells me that he thinks I am lying to him. I don’t want to lie, but I have to protect myself. He’s the one that I wish I could tell the most. His blue eyes bearing into my own and I have to turn away. I ask him why he thinks that I would lie to him. He leans in and says that he’s going to ask me one more time what my results were for the aptitude test. I blink and lie to his face. I have to make him believe that my results were Abnegation. He turns away, like I have hurt him, and then tells me that it’s time for me to go. When I’m walking out the door, he calls my name. I look back and he tells me that Dauntless doesn't break the glass like that. I turn away and leave the room.
“Yeah, Dean wants the four of us to get together tonight and see if we can come up with an idea to try to get our mothers to stop hating each other. Evidently, that would help not only me and Dean, but you and Sam as well. I know that look, and that was a very lovely red that just ran all over your face when I asked about Sam, so don’t try to deny it.” Cas very rarely had something to tease his brother about - it was usually the other way around - so he was definitely going to take advantage of the opportunity.
So, I follow the other initiates and some of the Dauntless born a different direction. We go up into one of the old buildings, there’s holes all in the exterior and it definitely wouldn’t be inhabitable, but it has stairs that lead up to the top. There’s a zip line attached, and there are around thirty people that are standing around. I look over the edge, out at the city around. I can barely even see the city that we live in, I’m surrounded by the old city, the one that was abandoned after the war. This is the part of the city that only Dauntless and factionless get the chance to experience. “Come on it’s a short cut back.” One of the Dauntless born draws my attention back to what’s going on.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He didn’t know about the deal Dean had made with his mother, and Dean felt he needed to get them on a little more even playing field. “I know you do the business end of the bakery, and I thought if I help you learn to make pumpkin bread, then you might be able to help me make a business plan. I want to expand the bakery to be a full service restaurant, but my mother is a little stubborn. I need something to show her so she will at least talk to me about it. She agreed if I win, she will look at a business plan.”
“Well, this year has definitely been an exciting one folks. Don’t forget to tune into For The Love Of Pie that will be airing the week before Christmas, to see these guys talking shop and talking pie. Be safe, and we will see you next year.” The announcer always sounded so cheesy, like he wouldn’t see them next Tuesday at the shopping center as well. Cas giggled, but was pulled away by the smiling faces of his and Dean’s families. It was so nice that they were all here as a group and he wasn’t having to field the questions alone this time.
“Want to hear my recipe for the bake off. I was afraid to jinx it in case I didn’t make it to the finals, but I am now, so I want to show you.” At that, Sam was distracted, and all they had to do was wait for Cas to let Dean know what was going on with Gabe. Then, if he thought that Gabe would help, they would come to the house and talk with the two of them. If not, well, Dean still wasn’t sure what he would do if Gabe couldn’t be brought around, but he would figure it out if he had to. They could just work with the three of them trying to figure out what they would do with their mothers; only then they would have to decide what to do about Gabe, as well.
I say yeah, that I’m happy with Dauntless, but he asks about me coming to see Sammy. I tell him that I only wanted to talk to him. He asks if I’ve seen my parents. I get an icy chill any time that he speaks to me. I don’t feel like I can be honest with him. It would get my mother in trouble. I think that he may be referring to Ellen and Bobby, but just to play it safe, I say no. He tells me that it’s hard to let go, and that Faction before Blood is an important idea, but it is sometimes difficult to fulfill. He says that it goes against our human nature, and that our nature is exactly what we need to overcome. How can human nature be such a bad thing? I ask if he thinks that human nature is a weakness, and he says that it’s the enemy. That it’s human nature to keep secrets, lie and steal, and that he wants to eradicate that. He says that’s how we will maintain a stable, peaceful society.
She wanted to start repairing bridges where she could and saving the boys' chance at winning was going to be her start. To get there however, she had to mend a few others first, starting with Naomi. “I know that I am the last person that you want to talk to right now, but can you at least hear the boys out? Betty did them really wrong, and I’m not talking about coming to us, there is more. They need our help. Will you at least listen to them?”
Castiel thought for a moment, and Dean seemed to think that he was going to reject his idea, but that was not what was giving him pause. He had only seen the confidence Dean had projected to everyone for the last ten years. It caught him off guard to see a sliver of that friend he had grown up with peeking through. The Dean now rarely asked for help. It was something Dean’s mother thought was a sign of weakness. The Dean from ten years ago had been willing to ask Castiel for anything. They had been best friends, after all.
“You know Sam, you don’t have to win me over with cheesy comedy and sweets. It helps, don’t get me wrong, but just so you know, you don’t need them.” He ran his fingers over Sam’s waist as he walked past him into the house and it caused a shiver to run up Sam’s spine and also drew the attention of other parts of his body that he wished would behave right now.
“Speaking of Sam, you seem to have spent quite a bit of time around him lately, which is totally unfair, by the way. You two aren’t expected to perpetuate this stupid feud; yet Dean and I can’t even be around each other without someone being upset. But anyway, what’s up with that?” Cas couldn’t help but notice the blush on his brother’s face, and that told him more than any words from his mouth ever would.
I went to find Joanna, she was the first to warn me that I was in danger here, she also covered for me when my tests were inconclusive. She tells me again about her friend that did so well in the second stage training that one of the head Dauntless leaders came to watch him on the final day. The next day he turned up dead at the bottom of the chasm. She said it was the Dauntless leadership and told me that I couldn’t let them find out about me. I asked her, what if they already know?'' She told me that if they already know, then I’m already dead.
He goes out to a balcony that is attached to his room. It has a beautiful view of the city, but it is a testament to how upset that he is that the height doesn’t seem to bother him right now. I’m not sure that he wants company right now, but I can’t stand to see him look so upset. I take a chance and join him on the balcony and stand beside him. Instead of confronting him over what took place in his fear landscape, I ask about the fact that he only has four fears. He tells me that he had four coming in and still has the same four. He tells me that he keeps going into the simulation, but that he doesn’t think anyone ever loses their fear.
“Hello, Dean.” It was really all he could say. It wasn’t as if Dean hadn’t been here earlier in the week when he had almost set the bakery on fire. Twice.
She didn’t want the same thing to happen here, it was bad enough the way that she had reacted all those years ago when Dean had told them that he loved Castiel. Her saving grace at the time had been that Dean was too young to run off and do what he wanted without her consent. Now if she forced him she wasn’t sure what would happen, but the fact that he was here facing her told her that it probably wouldn’t go in her favor.
As much as Sam was a morning person, evidently he and the shrimp were up late last night because he was being a down-right grump this morning.
I have tears in my eyes as I turn back to Benny. He’s a wonderful friend, because he pretends as though he doesn’t notice. We do leave the common area fairly quickly and make our way back to the dorms. I’m explaining to him and Charlie, another friend that I have made over the course of our training. She is normally very bouncy with an upbeat attitude that I didn’t think anything could dampen, but I was wrong. She’s very serious now as she listens to what happened to me the night before. We hear a commotion and leave the dorm room walking back to the open area before the chasm. There are voices coming from there. When we get close, I can tell that they are pulling up a body and my heart drops.
Mary expected Dean to carry on the feud between the Novaks and the Winchesters, but Dean had no problem with Castiel. In fact, they had been friends up until their mothers decided that they hated each other, and his friendship was something Dean really missed. He would participate in the bake off and try his best to win, but he wouldn’t be involved in the family feud his mother was trying to push.
Finally, they are all down in the alley and the street down from it. We get to the end and I think my mom realizes that I’m losing it. She stops and comes back just watching me for a second and it all comes bubbling out. I tell her that I killed Andrea, I killed her. She hugs me and says that we need to go find my father. This is something that drags me from my stupor. I haven’t met my father, and even though the circumstances are horrible, it is something that I am looking forward to.
Someone that she knew had received similar results on their test. When it came to the second stage of training her friend soared. Like, they went straight to the top of the leaderboard. Then, the next morning they were found at the bottom of the chasm. She said that they would find me. She wouldn’t elaborate on who they were, but she seemed worried because I had ended up in Dauntless. I firmly reminded her that I chose Dauntless and that I was Dauntless. I would be Dauntless.
Part Ten: Betrayal
“Thanks, Sammy. Hey, actually that’s what we were talking about. Gabe is staying with Cas for a while, and Cas was afraid that if we both move on to the next round, we won’t be able to get together as easily. Do you think you could, maybe, distract Gabe again? Maybe even a few times? I’m not asking you to do this for a simple romp in the hay, but for actual practice for the competition. It may not even matter if both of us don’t make it through this round, but if we do, I would really appreciate the help.” Dean held the puppy dog's eyes for as long as could, but his brother's were better than his and finally he broke with a grin. He knew that he could convince his brother and soon Sam was smiling back at him.
“Besides, Gabe wants to talk to me later anyway. I’m pretty sure that it has to do with us. He was looking between us in a strange way this afternoon. Let me talk to him and see what he has to say, and then, hopefully, we can both come to your place and talk with you and Sam. It’ll give you time to talk to him again and make sure he is okay with us trying to end this whole feud thing.” He kissed Dean chastely on the lips and pulled away, even as Dean tried to deepen the kiss.
I sit up with a start, and Cas is behind me. The only thing that gives away how scared he was is the fact that his breathing is heavier than normal and that when he removes the electrode from my head his hand is shaking. I don’t call him out on it there, because I’m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that the rumors were true. I defended Chuck, Bobby and Ellen had defended Chuck, how could we have been so wrong? Cas is quiet as he cleans up the simulation room, and I am lost somewhere in my head, so I don’t interrupt that quiet until after we are back in his room. I’m really not sure how we got there, but I’m glad that I didn’t leave him alone. Only now that the adrenaline has worn off, does he look like he is about to break down.
Part Three: Choosing
“You know me too well, Dean. Now rest. We really need to talk to our brothers, but I really need you sober for this conversation.” Cas finally managed to get Dean lying down on the bed and under the blanket, but there was no way he was going to be able to untangle himself.
“Mom?” Sam didn’t know all the details about what went on with Dean and his parents before, but he could tell that there was something that both of them were trying to find in the others eyes. It didn’t seem likely that it was anything good, so he wanted to move the conversation along.
That’s it, I can’t deal with this alone anymore. I have to talk to Sammy, at least check on him. It’s been too long since I’ve seen him. I need to know that he’s okay. I leave through one of the back doors and take an alley that is rarely used. I jump the train, the way that Dauntless has taught me to, and I walk right in the front doors of Erudite headquarters. Sammy comes up to me straight away, he must be able to tell that I need a hug. He simply says, Dean, and then envelops me in his brotherliness.
Training isn’t just about fighting. There is also weapons training. It took a while, but I got better with a gun. Knives, I am awesome at! I can hit the target every throw, usually bunched together in the center. Benny tells me that it’s scary how good I am at this, but all I can do in return is laugh. He’s really not wrong. It scares me a little too, how dangerous I could be, but it’s also a good thing. I have to move up the board.
The distraction was proving horrible for Cas; he was never going to learn to make the pumpkin bread. Getting out of his head and concentrating on the bread was difficult, but would prove to be the best thing for him. Cas actually managed to make a good loaf, and was able to even reproduce it.
Being in front of a computer was where Cas was the most confident. He felt at home there, and it showed. Dean saw Cas light up when he was discussing loans and repayments and profits and how they would all tie in together. This was what Dean had been missing when he tried to talk to his mom. She was worried about the money it would take to add on to the building, with no certainty of how that would be paid back. This broke his plan down with graphs and figures and everything Dean had never thought about adding to it. He always just assumed his food would be enough to bring her over to his side, at some point.
I look around at the others that are sitting in the waiting room with me, and they look just as nervous as I am. That makes me feel a little bit better. I know that being a divergent is rare, so they can’t all be concerned with the same thing I am. I guess knowing that someone is going to be inside my head scares me, not only because I’m so worried that they will know that I am divergent, but also because I don’t like people to know what I’m thinking. I am not really what I appear on the outside, but people assume that I am and I let them. If they get a look in my head, that illusion will be worthless.
The three of them had been friends before the feuding began, but it had put a strain on Betty’s friendship with both ladies. She felt confident that she stood a chance this year with both of them out of the running, especially since she knew the reputation Castiel’s cooking ability had. The only one she wasn’t completely sure of was Dean, but she had been thrown off guard with Castiel making it past the first round.
Then we are in another room and I recognize it immediately. It’s Abnegation, and I immediately have a sick feeling in my stomach. I ask Cas why we are in Abnegation, but he doesn’t answer me for a moment. Then he stops, looking up at me, he says the last fear is your worst fear and that it lives in the deepest part of your mind. He’s walking again now, into another room. Once we have completely entered, I see Chuck coming down the stairs into the room and what little doubt that I had of what this was is crushed. I say, simply for myself because he knows this, “Chuck had a son. What was his name?” Then as if answering my question, Chuck calls to him, “Castiel.” It keeps repeating and there are now several Chucks around the room. We are surrounded by them. They are all holding a belt, like a whipping strap. He keeps saying Castiel and that he is just trying to help him. Then the next thing that I know he is swinging. Cas blocks blow after blow and when he is finally able to hit back, they all go down and then we are back in the simulation room.
“Jerk.” Sam was full on laughing and it made Dean relax. He could have this.
Naomi came down the stairs and never took her eyes off of Mary, who was still standing just inside the door. “Why is she here? I know we need to talk about some things, Betty came by earlier and I was very surprised at what she had to say. I’m guessing this is about that?” This last part was aimed at Castiel and he seemed to shrink under her glare, but Dean wasn’t going to have that, he was done seeing people talk down to Cas and he sure as hell wasn’t going to stand here and watch Cas’s own mother do it.
“Nice try, Sammich, but you aren’t nearly as funny as me. I don’t know. I almost feel bad for the way that I reacted to Dean and Cas. I mean, it isn’t like it’s been easy on them these last few weeks. Do you ever think about how unfair this town can actually be?” Gabe looked out the window, like he was doing some heavy thinking, and Sam didn’t want him to get any further into himself and become depressed.
It didn’t take long before they had a sort of decent loaf of bread. It wasn’t the best thing Castiel had ever tasted, but it was a lot better than any of his other attempts. Dean seemed to think it was wonderful, if the expression on his face was anything to go by. “Good try, Cas. Let’s try again. You’ll get it; I have faith in you.”
One of the other initiates, Garth, is having a really hard time at knives. Uriel tells him that he has to go get the knives that he just threw. They are laying on the ground by the targets that everyone is still throwing at. When he hesitates, Uriel tries to make a point. That if he is afraid to pick them up that he isn’t brave enough to be Dauntless. Garth makes the point that Uriel himself said there is a difference between brave and stupid. This doesn’t go over well with Uriel. He makes Garth stand in front of the target and tells Cas to throw the knives. If Garth flinches he’s automatically thrown out of Dauntless. I can’t stand by and let someone be bullied by Uriel, especially not someone that I consider a friend. Just before Cas throws the first knife I speak up.
Luckily, Dean agreed, and the two of them began to make their way towards the stairs. Cas wasn’t completely sure where Dean’s bedroom was, but he figured it was on the second floor, and since that was the way that Dean seemed to be leading him,  it seemed like a safe bet.
Jack looked like he belonged in both of their families and Sam had teased Dean and Cas relentlessly that he was meant to be their child, but they just weren’t ready for that yet. Once the restaurant was on its feet a little bit more they were planning on looking into adoption as well. They simply wanted to make sure that they were able to devote the time that a little one would inevitably need and they weren’t quite there yet.
Dean wasn’t even making sense with his ranting at this point, and Cas had tried to get him to keep his voice down, but by this point he had given up and was just letting Dean have his say. “You know, Cas, I don’t even know why they are fighting anymore. They both have their own successful bakeries. What does it matter that they went their separate ways for a while? They have spent more time arguing and hating each other than anyone ever should.
The two pies are presented to the judges, and for this round the contestants wait in the room while all three judges taste the two different selections. During this time, Cas noticed that Betty had her phone open to a picture of the recipe. The picture was of the recipe that he had been practicing with and it was in his handwriting. “So, Betty,” Cas started as he picked up the phone. “Is this the recipe that you were using? This one right here, that just so happens to match the one in my bag? The one that is written in my handwriting?”
“Where do you think you are sneaking off to?”
Her gossip seemed to have drawn even more attention to the pair than they were receiving before. Dean really hoped that it wouldn’t backfire on them. If they won the bake off, they would be able to play all this attention to their benefit, but if they lost it would bring all of the blame on them as well. He didn’t want that kind of stigma going into this new relationship with Cas. It was a good thing and he definitely didn’t want to disgrace it with a bad image before it had even really gone anywhere.
At the end, there was a little bit of a smirk shining through as Cas looked up at Dean from his coffee cup. Dean was certain that Cas knew what he did to him at this point. There was no way that he didn’t know how sexy Dean thought that the innocent look was. “Not if you don’t get your butt up and get your shower. We’re going to be late if we don’t get a move on.”
“Sasquach, have you seen my brother? He was right here when I went to the boys' room and now that he’s gone, there seems to be someone else missing too.”
It hadn’t slipped his notice that Dean had called him Cas. It was something that he had done when they were kids, and it made Castiel smile now. He hoped that eventually, and if this went well, they could eventually be friends again. They would just have to find a way to convince their mothers that it wouldn’t be the end of the world. If Dean even wanted to be friends after this.
“Sure, but I don’t know how much I would drink if I were you. He might be a little shit, but you are hooking up with his baby brother.” Dean wasn’t fond of Sam’s cocky attitude, but he let it slide. Besides, it might be his fault, at least a little bit.
“Well, first of all Betty should mind her own business, and before you go defending her you should know that she is the main reason that we are here. Besides spying on us, she has also been stealing from us. She took Cas’s idea for his pie and my idea for my crust. Then, she went on the news and announced what kind of pie she was making, essentially ruining our chances of actually using the recipes that we had planned or making us look like the thieves.” Dean wasn’t done, but it looked like Mary wasn’t going to be able to contain herself for much longer, so he paused to let her go ahead and get it out.
Evidently, Dean had let something slip about loving Cas; at thirteen years old, he was really only starting to understand what love meant and had no reason to keep his feelings from anyone. That was the worst fight he and his parents ever had, and it was never brought up again. Sure, Dean had gone a few towns over and indulged, and his time in Paris was freedom, but here in this town, no one knew of his proclivities. He wasn’t going to let his parents down now, not over something like this. Dean would make it through this agreement they set up, and then he would distance himself from Cas again.
Castiel just shook his head and looked back at the mess covering the tables and himself. “No, the bread seems to think that I have personally offended it’s mother and is now out for retribution. Any advice?”
“Yes, Gabe, I’m sure you have a lot you want to say, but please wait until I’m finished.” Cas waited for his brother’s agreement before he continued on.
Walking down the hall, I see Lucifer with several of his goons. There are rumors that he is leading a search on divergents. I again think about Sammy and if his results were similar to mine. I honestly hope not. With him in the middle of everything going on with Erudite and their hunt for divergents, if his test was inconclusive then Lucifer would have every reason to go after him. He calls me over and talks to me. Saying how proud he is that I know my own mind, even with my test results showing Abnegation. He doesn’t bring up Sam and neither do I. I don’t want to bring extra attention to Sammy, I guess I’m still trying to protect him from afar. This time however, I seem to have his attention. He looks me up and down and says that Dauntless suits me. I’m not really sure what that means. This whole interaction really makes me miss Sam though,  I haven’t seen him since the choosing ceremony.
Cas came up to me after he fought them and asked if I was alright. I wasn’t really, but said that I was and he took me back to his room. He gave me a shirt to put on, it was too big, but it was better than mine, which they had ripped in the struggle. He told me that I would be safe in his room, and that was what I really needed at the moment. I was just waiting on them to come bursting in the door. He was looking over my scrapes and cuts, cleaning them with a towel and water. It stung and I grabbed his hand. He stopped and looked at my hand laying on top of his. I pulled my hand away, looking down as I did so. Then for some reason I apologized to him. I didn’t want him to think that he was scaring me, even though he really was. My heart was pumping, and it had nothing to do with the idiots that had just tried to kill me.
“Fine, bitch. I’ll make the food; you get to go buy the alcohol.” And that’s what they did. Dean decided that they needed some burgers to go with their beer. By the time Sam was back from the gas station, the food was ready, and they sat down to eat. With all the stress that Dean had put on himself lately, it was no surprise that he was putting away the beer faster than the food. Sam would just have to keep an eye on him.
“Yes, Dean? I told you I would be right back. Trust me, you are going to want these. Otherwise, no one is going to want to be around you when you wake up. Not even you.
That lasted until Cas and Gabe actually showed up, and then Gabe pulled Sam off to the side to ‘discuss their problem with someone who wasn’t intoxicated.’ Apparently, Gabe didn’t like the fact that Dean was drinking, but that was too bad; it was his house, and he was going to have a few drinks if he wanted them, and there was nothing that the little shrimp was going to do about it.
“Hey, it’s okay. What’s going on?” Cas seemed to be a little hastier than Dean had expected, and he wanted to make sure something hadn’t happened with him once he had left Dean’s house this morning.
“Why? Would you want to start acting like mush? I mean is there something or someone that would make you mushy? Ah hell, you know what I mean.” Sam’s insides didn’t feel like there were butterflies, it was more like a swarm of hornets had made their nest in there and someone had kicked that nest.
“Yeah, well, my mom was able to help me practice the muffins. I’m afraid my bread is going to end up horrible. At least at the bake off there won’t be enough time for it to catch on fire. My mom’s going to lose the bakery, and it’s all going to be my fault. There is a reason I do the books and not the baking.”
I kept running, we were almost there. I get inside and can’t help myself, I completely break down. I only allow myself a moment though, I have to find the rest of my family. I walk through the warehouse and finally find them in the back corner huddled around a light. I ask where my father is, and a tall man comes up behind me, apparently he was hidden separately in case someone came up that wasn’t a friend. He says my name, but looks around. He asks about my mother. I can’t speak, I can only shake my head. The guilt is eating me alive. The devastation is clear on his face, but he still comes up and hugs me. Who knew that I needed this. That I needed my father’s acceptance. I can see Bobby and Ellen standing off to the side, and as I break my hug with my father, Ellen embraces me in the tightest hug I’ve ever encountered. Then Sam comes around the corner, and I’m losing it again. I feel like such a girl right now, because I can’t seem to quit crying. I am running over and hugging him as tight as I can. I look back at my father and tell him that she saved me. I pull away from Sammy and apologize, telling them all that she died saving me. My father tells me that if she died saving me, then it wasn’t in vain.
“Uh, we’re friends. He seems to care a lot about his brother, and about you. Sam’s not a bad guy, not to mention he grew up pretty damn good looking too. I don’t know what it is about those Winchester genes, but they make some pretty sons. Anyway, I’m getting off topic, What are we going to do about mom? Am I to assume that this big talk everyone keeps mentioning has something to do with that?” Jesus, Gabe hated it when he blushed. He just couldn’t seem to hide embarrassment at all, and he was a little embarrassed when it came to the giant moose. He liked being around Sam, and he hadn’t been lying about him growing up to look like a freaking model.
Yay! For those who made it through Thank You SO Much!!!! I hope that you enjoyed my little Slice of Life!
Danger isn’t something that they, we, think about too much. I guess if I think about it, we are kind of dumb with some of the stunts that we pull, but it makes me feel alive. Alive is something that I haven’t felt in a long time, if ever, living in Abnegation.
“Well, Cas, I decided that if you were going to help me put together a plan to show my mother, then you needed to know what I was wanting to offer in my restaurant.” Dean’s cheeks became a little flushed at that, and Cas thought it was absolutely adorable.
Cas snickered, but did as Dean had asked, heading to the bathroom to take his shower while Dean texted his brother and made himself another cup of coffee. He had gotten ready in the bathroom, so he really didn’t have anything else to be doing while he waited on Cas. While he was drinking it, he wondered what would happen today. He was hopeful that it would come as a shock to Betty that they would team up. Surely, she knew that they would have seen the broadcast and not be making the same thing.
“Hey, stop. We will figure this out. I talked to Sammy this morning, and he’s okay with us. He was just a little surprised, and I don’t really blame him for that. I think he might help cover for us if we need it, as long as we don’t abuse it. We will use the bakery when we can, and if we can’t, I’ll talk to him. Who knows, we may not both make it to the finals, and if that’s the case, it won’t matter anymore anyway.” Dean pulled Cas back in for another kiss. “Come on, it’s time to start. We will have time after we submit and before the judges come to a decision; we can try to sneak away again then.”
This runs right through me. It thoroughly pisses me off. I snapped back at him that I didn’t think that he even noticed because I saw him leave during the fight. I leave out that him leaving is the last thing that I remember before waking up in the infirmary. He surprises me by saying that it wasn’t something that he wanted to watch.
Dean wanted to expand the bakery to include other types of food. After all, he had spent five years in France, and he didn’t spend all that time away with the intention of limiting himself to making pies and scones. He had tried, on several occasions, to convince his mother they needed a full service restaurant, but she would never risk what she had built. Dean didn’t want to leave his mom to run the bakery alone, but he wanted to do more with his education.
“You are more perceptive than people give you credit for. What if it isn’t what you think it is, though? What if what they are doing isn’t what you think?” Of course, it was close, but Sam wasn’t going to say that. He had to get a feel for where Gabe’s head was when it came to their brothers. He didn’t want to risk giving them away, if it wasn’t something that he could handle.
Cas asks me how long I thought I was in the hallucination. It seemed like a long time, but I know that when you’re upset time slows down, so it probably wasn’t as long as it seemed. I tell him twenty minutes, but he says I was only there for three minutes. He says that is four times faster than the average. My stomach drops, so that’s how they find out about divergents in this simulation. He says that he’s never seen anyone do that well the first time, and it drops a little lower. Crap. He asks how I escaped the vampire, and tells me that the image wasn’t clear. I decide lying about this won’t work because he was literally in my head. I tell him that I just went into the water.
I pull myself from my musings in time to see a speeding person careening down the line. I watch as he puts his hand out, almost skimming the building. It was my son, Dean is definitely in his element at Dauntless. I believe that we both should have stayed in that particular faction myself. The boys have both grown up so brave. They would have loved growing up Dauntless.
“I can’t believe Betty would do that! What is wrong with her? I trusted her because she’s been friends with my mom for so long.” Cas was livid. He hadn’t even told Dean what he was going to be doing in the finals yet. There was only one way Betty could have found out what he was baking, and that was to be a freaking sneaky assbutt.
As I’m leaving there are guards that come up and act like they’re going to take me away. They say that I need to go with them. The hell they say. I have been trained to fight and I do just that. I’ve knocked them both back when I hear the voice that fills my nightmares. Lucifer calls out for us to stop. They fall back and he asks if I’m alright. I tell him that I’m fine, but end up having to follow him anyway. He leads me through a room with people attached to monitors who appear to be going through sims, but we find our way to a table and chairs and he tells me to sit down. I do and he surprises the hell out of me by saying that he’s happy that I came there today. This surprises me so I blurt out, you are? He ignores my question and asks me if I am happy with my faction.
Morning inevitably comes, even after a rough night with little sleep. Sam and I eat breakfast with Bobby and Ellen. They are encouraging, telling us that we shouldn’t be afraid of these tests. I don’t know why, they determine the rest of our lives. They have faith though, and that makes it easier for me to put our fate in the hands of the tests. Everyone seems well fit to the lives that the tests have chosen for them, so why can’t it be the same for Sam and I, even if we won’t be in the same faction. We can still see each other. I mean, it’s a city, we are bound to cross paths.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas read the look that I gave him as I had shoved Lucifer away from me, and he tossed me the injector already loaded with the sim formula. I inject it into Lucifer’s neck, telling him to shut it down and wipe the program, so that he can’t do it again. Cas is coming up and putting the commands into the system to have him actually do as I’ve said. Lucifer puts in the codes, and alertness sweeps over the members of Dauntless on the computer screens. I watch as Benny looks around in disgust at what he was doing, as it’s pretty obvious to everyone. Dauntless members are looking around in horror, and Abnegation members are hugging each other and crying.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Meh, shut up. We need to get some stuff done before we head to Dean’s. This place is a mess.” Gabriel couldn’t deny it, so he simply brushed it off and found something that he could throw back at Cas. The house really wasn’t messy, except for maybe the room Gabe was using, because the man really was like living with a toddler.
Part One: The Beginning
When they reached the front they realized that they had in fact caught Betty off guard. “What’s going on? Did someone drop out? There are only two tables.” She seemed genuinely confused, but neither contestant could bring themselves to feel sorry for her after all, her cheating was what brought them to team up in the first place.
I can’t stand by and let him shoot Cas. So even though he hasn’t moved a muscle, when Uriel releases the safety on his gun, I raise mine as well. This is followed by several movements. Uriel is now holding his gun to Cas’s head, Gordon has his to mine and mine is aimed at Uriel’s. For just a moment Uriel seems amused that both of us are from Abnegation and both of us are divergent. There is no way to hide it anymore, so he is positive. Gordon says that they can’t let a single divergent slip through. Uriel says that I’m not going to shoot him, and his smug voice is just too much as I tell him that he may just be overestimating my character. He tries to grab my gun, simply knocking it down from his head, and I fire. It’s only a shot in the leg, but it’s enough for us to get away from the two.
I walk through the door and Cas closes and locks it behind me. That would be something exciting, if it weren’t for the solitary chair that is looming in the center of the room. The only other things in here are a machine behind the chair and a workstation for Cas. No mirrors in here like the ones that were in our original aptitude testing rooms. It’s so sterile, and just plain, that it makes me uncomfortable. I don’t know if that is because I was already nervous coming in or if it’s meant to be that way to make you on edge for the testing.
“I think an idea, but I’m willing to work on a plan if you are willing to work on a bread?” Dean’s smirk was beautiful, but not something he was used to having aimed at him. It was one of the casualties of the feud and it was only now that he was realizing how horrible a thing that really was. It was so distracting that Dean seemed to notice, but luckily he didn’t call him on it. He simply asked when and where they were going to meet.
“You will want to be around me. I know you will.” That actually made Cas feel better; evidently Dean was starting to understand how Cas felt. That or it was just the alcohol giving him even more confidence.
Sam and Dean had of course grown up here, but Cas had spent a lot of time here as a kid before their families were torn apart. It was difficult for him to be back here, especially knowing that he wasn’t really welcome. He and Gabe hung back, while Sam took a seat on the couch. He was hoping that Mary would join him and that this would be a civil conversation. After all, it wasn’t Cas and Gabe that Mary had been feuding with all these years, it was Naomi. As it turned out, it didn’t really matter who it had been, they were Novaks and that was enough to get Mary going.
Dean would definitely have an advantage over Castiel, whom he knew wasn’t anywhere near the baker Dean was. He would simply have to make an amazing pie to ensure that he beat whoever they were up against this year, and he thought he had the perfect recipe.
When I come out of the simulation, Cas asks me how I did that. I’m a little confused at first, then he asks how I broke the glass. I say, I don’t know and that I just did it. He seems upset, parroting back to me that I just did it, like a question. He comes over, sitting down like we are best buddies and asks me what my test results were. My stomach drops again. I’m sure that I have been found out and Lucifer will be hunting me down now. I stick with the plan though, and tell him that my results were Abnegation. He’s rather smug when he tells me that he doesn’t think so.
Once I am in the chair, she hands me a strange, almost glowing blue liquid. When I ask what it is she just tells me to turn it up. She smiles a small smile as I do what she says. I close my eyes because it definitely is not a pleasant taste, but evidently it is necessary for the testing. Upon opening my eyes again, she is gone. The chair is also gone. The only thing left in the room is me. Well, me and the mirrors that is. Perhaps I am vain. I believe that is what this is. I try not to look in the mirrors, but they are all around me. I find myself, not a reflection, because I am facing away from myself. When the other me turns around the only word he says is choose.
John was so brave that I just knew that he would be staying with Dauntless. I hadn’t prepared myself for having to choose between him and my home. When the time came, it was not a difficult choice to make, but looking back now, I wonder what would have been different. John had chosen Amity, and while it did suit him in a way, it wasn’t a perfect match. I was lucky that I also fit in, to an extent.
“Sure, we can talk. It’ll be nice to get away from all of this commotion for a little while. I have a few questions for you anyway.” With that, Sam led Gabriel the opposite direction from where he had seen his brother and Cas head into the orchard.
“I have a proposal. What if we help each other?” Dean wasn’t sure how Castiel would react, but he didn’t seem too opposed to Dean as a person, so maybe it wouldn’t be as bad as he feared.
It’s more than frowned upon to be divergent. It would mean that I don’t fit in any one faction. The factionless have always been mostly made up of divergents and those that chose differently than the tests had indicated and were not able to complete the training in the new faction of their choosing. This is a cautionary tale that is told to children growing up, that way they know they should trust the test. So where does that leave me? I can’t trust the test. The test let me down. Now I guess I have to choose where I will be able to make it. I have to choose what abilities that I want to be my primary ones. This isn’t supposed to be this hard. I can’t even talk to Sam about it because if he is found helping a divergent then it makes his world that much harder, and I don’t want to cause him to be factionless because he was tossed out.
“CAAAAAS!!!!” Dean was now yelling from his bedroom, where Cas had left him while he went to get a glass of water and some Tylenol. He wanted to head off Dean’s hangover before it started.
Sam was agreeing before he was even finished, the nod of his head emphasized by his hair, which had grown out quite a bit since he had left for Stanford.
“Why did you run off and leave me to ride with mom alone? You know how she gets after one of these things, and it’s bound to be worse this year because she isn’t in it. I had to, uh, I had to get a ride with someone, and then I get here and Dean Winchester is pulling out of the driveway. What the hell are you thinking, Castiel?” This was not how Gabe wanted to start the conversation, especially after he had promised Sam he would try to be open minded.
I look around and place my hands on the glass. For a moment, I think of breaking it the way I did before, but then I remember that I can’t do that. They are all watching me, so I take my jacket off and use it to stop up the pipe that the water is coming out of. When I come out of it, I’m back in Cas’s room and he is congratulating me. He starts kissing me, but when I try to get him to stop, he doesn’t. He says, aren’t you Dauntless, and I fight back. Then, I’m back in the observation room for the final test. Cas comes up to me as I walk off the stage. I ask him to please tell me that he wasn’t watching that and he smirked, then asks if I want him to lie to me. Lucifer then comes up with his greasy grin and tells me that I’ve done well, but there is one final test. He lays a gun in my and my family comes up. Bobby and Ellen are there, and so is Sammy, but he’s in Abnegation grey, not Erudite blue. Lucifer tells me that I know what to do and all I can do is look back and forth between him and Sammy. I tell him no, but he says if you want to be Dauntless, do it. I look back at my family and realize that this still isn’t real, I’m still in my fear landscape. I raise the gun and fire.
“I do not want to go in there.” Sam and Gabe had been sitting in the driveway of Cas’s house for a while now, but with Dean’s car in the driveway, neither one of them wanted to go inside.
Working with Naomi, Mary remembered why she enjoyed baking with her so much. She was very particular about the way that she wanted her kitchen, but she had determination. Where Naomi was strict in her baking, Mary was creative, that’s why the two of them had worked so well together before. Mary would suggest something and if Naomi couldn’t talk her out of it then they would try it. These trial and error episodes were what made their recipes so good, they were different, but not so wild that no one would want to eat them.
It was Garth that they eventually pulled over the edge. Benny and Charlie look at me but neither says anything. I might not have wanted him near me anymore, but that would have been solved by him being cut and sent to live with the factionless. I didn’t want him to kill himself. The guilt builds inside of me until I can’t take it anymore and head back through the tunnel like hallways that are common in Dauntless.
“I’m sure that’s where he went; let’s go have a chat of our own, shall we?” Gabriel had a way of making just about anything sound suggestive, and this was no exception.
Factionless isn’t just a name given to those that can’t make it in their faction. It’s a name given to criminals that have been cast out of their faction for one reason or another. I was pregnant when John went out hunting. When he came back, the counsel was at our door within the hour. They said that he had left the city and that was unacceptable. He was given an hour to settle affairs and turn himself in. I panicked.
“Wow, Dean, I’m sorry. I just thought you got a little close and stuff happened. I know your reputation. You know this town likes a juicy tale, and in high school, you were who everyone was talking about. If it’s that important to you, I won’t say anything else about it. No, that’s a lie; I’m still going to harass you because that’s what little brothers do, but just know I don’t mean anything by it.” Dean knew Sam, and that was accurate. He would think that something was wrong with his brother if he completely stopped harassing him, especially over something as juicy as this.
He looked into Cas’s eyes, wanting confirmation that it was okay to tell his mother about them. After all, it wasn’t as big of a secret anymore. If they lied and continued hiding it would only be harder for them later and Dean didn’t want to do that. He wanted to be free to be with Cas however they saw fit, and it seemed that Cas was okay with it as well.
