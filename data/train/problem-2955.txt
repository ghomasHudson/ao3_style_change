“Dean?” Cas asked curiously as Dean leaned into his space and kissed him. Then kissed him again, opening Cas’s mouth with his own, pushing into Cas’s mouth the whiskey he’d just sipped. Cas moaned low in the back of his throat as Dean chased the whiskey and then pulled Dean onto his lap so that he was balanced on the same stool as him. Dean had his arms wrapped around Cas as he sat on him sideways, exchanging kisses until Dean started to find the day catching up with.
Cas’s blurry form stepped closer. “Um,” he called over the rushing water, “may I join you?”
Their spend washed off of them the moment they dared to pull apart. Dean looked up into Cas’s eyes, drawn in by how big they’d gotten. Cas pulled him close again and softly kissed his face and then mouth, before reaching for the soap.
Dean didn’t say no as he got up to get back to work, but he wondered if Cas would be okay with something like that. He knew Charlie would sell tickets and stuff. There’d be money to go back to Cas. Though as Dean thought about cutting those wicked toenails of Castiel’s, Dean wondered what else the guy did for money. The Ddraig hotel was in good enough shape, bar the east wing.
“Won’t your mom and dad be disappointed?” Garth said.
Hunger sated at a diner a few blocks over, Dean headed towards a nearby Walgreens. He had a mental list of what he needed to get to help with Cas, top of it was nail clippers and scissors—neither of which would work if soaking Castiel’s feet didn’t succeed in softening the toe nails. The main thing Dean was grateful for was that when he had seen Cas’s nails, aside from their impossible size, they appeared to not have any fungal infections. So Dean hunted down nail files as well—metal and cardboard backed files. Also on the list was a nice smelling bubble bath mix, because surely the guy deserved to have a bit of class? Though Dean did not go as far as buying any scented candles, because that would have been weirder than what he was already doing. The bubble bath ended up being lavender scented and promised it was made from the finest essential oils.
“I’m sure I can ice the house myself, why don’t you get started on the eggnog?” Dean said as he got the icing bag ready.
Dean stowed his cell and shrugged. “I’m still going to check it out.” He stood up and stretched. Through the store’s front windows he could see the first real wave of customers arriving. “Welp. Back to the grindstone.”
“Thank you, Dean.”
on next.
After hours of work, everyone gathered in the dining room, the table set with so much food, Dean felt giddy looking at it. Everyone was smiling and chatting, an air of happiness, of family, gathered around. Dean was still on good terms with his own parents, but he appreciated the found family he and Sam had managed to gather to themselves over the years in Sioux Falls.
“Thanks,” Dean said as the tray was set down on his bedside table. He sat with his back against the headboard and took the Tylenol. The cold water felt good against his throat.
It took some more calming words and a strong cup of sweetened tea to eventually persuade Charlie to believe that Cas was very much what he claimed to be and that he wouldn’t eat her. Then the questions about other supernatural beings came and Dean gave her the same talk that Cas had given him the other week. After the talk, she seemed calmer and more accepting of the impossibility of everything.
The rest of Dean’s shift went by in a blur until it was three in the afternoon and time for him to head on off to the viewing while two of their younger team members took over for the remainder of the day. He jogged out of the coffee shop as the mid afternoon rush started and headed to his car, a sweet ‘67 Chevy Impala, parked down the street. Dean drove the five minutes to head a couple of blocks over and parked up on another street. Putting money in the meter outside the apartment block, Dean looked up at the brown brick building—it looked like an old factory or warehouse that had been converted into clean, modern living.
Dean wasn’t panicking because he didn’t want to be out about their relationship, but the idea of a creature as impossible and immense as Cas being grateful to have Dean in his life? It made Dean feel like he could never deserve such affection.
One corner of the room, crowded behind a huge standing world globe was a rock that had a sword sticking out of it. That sword in the stone looked more out of place than the armor in the opposite corner.
Dean raised an eyebrow briefly at that, but nodded in agreement. “Sure, of course. See you in a while.”
Flying high above the sky, Dean could see the roads and buildings of Sioux Falls spread out beneath him like a giant patchwork quilt. He felt wind streaming through his hair as he rose and fell with the wingbeats of an immense creature, it’s gold and black feathers shifting beneath him along with its glittering blue scales. The creature’s long neck stretched ahead of Dean, and tilted this way and that as the creature changed direction. Dean tightened his grip on the creature’s feathers each time that the change in direction was more than he was expecting.
Dean dropped the keys and cursed as he accidentally kicked them under the car. “Dammit!”
And later that night he had one last gift to finish.
“See,” Dean said as they took the right he
“WOAH! WATCH IT!” Dean yelled. “YOU’LL BURN YOURSELF!” Dean slid off his stool and rushed over to Cas, ready to see badly blistering skin.
Glancing up from the obscure pentagram design he had just finished on one wall, Dean gave Sam a nervous grin. “It’s the final spell, Sam.”
“Right,” Sam nodded. “Well, anyway. Forget Christmas, you’ll come round for Thanksgiving, right? Eileen has big plans.”
With Sam gone, Dean’s break was over and he headed on behind the counter to join Garth.
Dean rolled his eyes, not that Sam could see him, gripping his cell phone a touch tighter than necessary. Things he’d been hoping to do on his Saturday off: lie in until 10 and then make brunch for Cas before spending another day searching for spell components that were harder to find than Nazi gold. Not talking to Sam.
Dean had been a little surprised to see Sam come into The Bunker that Friday morning. But not entirely, he was three and a bit days deep into the weirdest living arrangement he’d ever been in and had so far glossed over his new living situation with Sam when he was inevitably called each night. How else was Sam meant to find out what was going on in Dean’s life, bar showing up at the hotel itself once Dean was done with work for the day?
Her eyes went wide as she stared at Cas surrounded by Dean and Jack, and the nails protruding from Castiel’s slippers. Eileen felt no surprise at seeing Jack—they’d been introduced the weekend after Jack had been made flesh again, with Jack being dubbed a house guest and old friend of Cas’s who was staying at The Ddraig as he took a break from his college studies.
Dean turned to the source of the voice and faced a pair of open black lacquered, glass fronted doors, and headed in what appeared to be a sunroom of sorts. There was a cacophony of plants in the room, making the sunroom seem part jungle in some corners, all planted in varying types of ceramic and terracotta pots. He couldn’t see who had spoken to him and then looked towards a pair of open French doors and a man sat in a tall backed rattan chair, the dried strands again stained black. His back was to Dean, but Dean could see a tuft of messy black hair, and a vibrant crocheted blanket trailing from the man’s lap for over five foot from the chair.
Cas looked at him with questioning eyes and Dean gently pulled Cas towards him, bringing their lips together. Aside from the tang of tomato and garlic, Cas tasted of cinnamon and smoke. The kiss sent heat through Dean, making his toes curl in his boots as Cas returned the press of their mouths. The kiss was over all too quickly and Dean wanted to press back in, but he held back as Cas met his gaze again.
“Well, I have to at least make you some soup.” Sam smiled and got off the bed. “Try to rest, okay? And drink some tea.” He headed on out and left Dean to his thoughts.
Sam closed his mouth, and nodded firmly. The two of them trailed downstairs and argued over what they were going to watch. They were still working their way through Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, but Dean was in more of a film mood now that he was downstairs. Heading into the kitchen he asked Sam to create a shortlist while Dean popped some corn on the stove.
When Cas slammed the door to his rooms closed, Dean found himself thankful that they had had the foresight to put everyone else on different floors to the floor the two of them occupied. Cold fingers made hard work of removing clothes, but soon they were both naked and kissing and Cas was worked them towards his bedroom and the bed there.
Dean took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “What’s the deal with the damn ghost?”
Dean stepped beyond the hotel’s boundaries and beckoned Cas to follow him. “Cas, I think you can.”
“And his hand was really warm too.”
When he was finally in bed, Dean curled up on his side and found himself pulled into sleep easily.
“Dean?” called Cas from the bathroom doorway.
“Of course.”
“A blood moon?”
“It appears so.”
“Can I use the kitchen?”
But Dean was less worried about making the rent and more worried about his parents and little brother. His dad was showing no sign of wanting to slow down. Instead his dad had turned into a constant source of grief for his mother who was working extra hard to make sure John Winchester didn’t leave the house. He had lung issues thanks to his years in construction without wearing protective masks—he wasn’t 70, but emphysema was a pretty good reason to not get tangled up with COVID-19.
Cas set down the dishes by the sink and leaned back on the counter, crossing his arms over his chest. “I believe that he is here, because of a spell gone wrong. Normally, when the remains are destroyed, so is the ghost. And he was cremated, from what I could figure out at the time. But a trace of him remains, because of a spell.
“No one. Not even her longterm girlfriend.”
“Agreed. Please, continue.” Cas nodded.
“C’mon, you have got to see the coffee machine in this place,” Dean said, changing the subject, hopefully.
Dean thumped the grounds into an empty bean bag, ready to package up once full and set aside for customers to take home for their yards. “The tour? Uh, right. Yeah, not my kind of place. It was more pricey than I’d been expecting. And up too many stairs.”
And how Sam, looking rumpled in his shirt and slacks after work, could just be on point but just remarking about Dean’s apparent paleness—Dean didn’t know, but he cringed inwardly. “Yeah. I uh… um… think I might be coming down with something?” Because no way in hell was he about to tell Sam that he thought he’d encountered a ghost that afternoon.
Dean looked at the pancakes, as if seeing them for the first time, and hungrily cut off a mouthful and popped it in his mouth. He chewed and swallowed. “You could always warm them up for me again,” Dean teased.
Dean stepped up beside Cas and placed a reassuring hand on the small of Cas’s back. “I’m sure, together, we can think of something.”
Once Bobby was gone with the van, it was nearing three in the afternoon and Dean realized he was feeling hungry. He’d missed out on an offer of grabbing a burger in-between moving things around, because he’d been too excited about moving, but now he was regretting that choice.
Legs a little unsteady, the two of them walked over to the laptop that had been in charge of compiling book scans and translating them.
dragons are real… what else is real?” Dean asked, giving voice to his earlier thoughts.
Eileen didn’t faint once.
“Sure. See you… later,” Cas replied, eyes closing as he relaxed in the chair. He was like a cat or a lizard, the way he was enjoying the sun.
Facing Garth, Dean smiled and asked in a voice only Garth would hear, “Is everything okay?”
Dean’s fingers started to cramp under the weight of the supplies he’d brought up with him and he suddenly remembered he was standing in the middle of Cas’s rooms, staring at everything and saying nothing.
“Dean, your food will get cold,” Cas scolded, taking a bite of cake.
“I like the sound of that!”
“Wow, I think I’ll be able to actually find the place now.”
playing and all his mind wanted to focus on was the deliciousness of Cas and just everything about him. The door to his rooms were locked and Dean had to give up fighting his imagination and hormones.
“Flames can only do so much,” Cas replied, eyes flicking up to the sprinklers set high above in the ceiling.
Dean didn’t respond and was dimly aware of Cas walking around the car and getting in on the passenger side. Cas closed the door and the
“Bar the blip from thirty years ago, yeah.” Sam looked at his laptop screen and then back to Dean.
Cas gave Dean a sad smile. “The lady who used to do them for me, she passed away a year ago, old age. My nails aren’t normally as long or as hard as what you experienced.”
Cas muttered under his breath and leaned across the counter, holding his right hand out over the stack, palm down. Dean watched as Cas closed his eyes in concentration and then opened them again, pulling his hand away as he did. The pancakes were nice and warm again.
Heading on into the hotel, the sky darkening, Dean checked the sunroom and found that Castiel had moved from there. Unsure quite where he might be and realizing he should probably make sure he had Cas’s cell number going forwards, Dean ventured back up to the third floor and checked out the rooms on that floor. Heading past his own, he soon found a room with the distant tinkling of music, some classical piano that he couldn’t put a name to. Dean knocked on what looked like the door to the rooms.
Cas set the horns and halo on the floor beside them and then returned to Dean, claiming his mouth again with eager kisses and hands going everywhere as he got back into Dean’s space, once again pushing a leg between Dean’s thighs. Every shift of their bodies caused Dean’s growing hard-on to throb, and he could feel that Cas was similarly affected. Reaching out to Cas, Dean’s hand went to the fake wings he’d worn as part of his costume, and Cas shivered, breaking their kiss as his eyes rolled into the back of his head.
Once Cas could stand again, they found Sam and Eileen, and Jack, and Eileen was introduced properly to Cas, Jack and Dean.
“I normally found it… uncomfortable to watch what was going on,” Cas admitted. “So, I don’t really know.”
You knew?” Dean croaked.
But if they were working so hard to bring Jack back and unbind both him and Cas from the hotel, Dean decided that it would be right if he were to at least get to know the ghost—the young man—before they tried to bring him back from the dead. All Jack had done to Dean, after all, was just say “hello”.
Castiel opened the bathroom door. “Do you need me to do anything?”
Dean swallowed a bite of pizza, the combined taste of Canadian Bacon, pepperoni, Italian sausage, bacon, beef and mozzarella cheese exploding over his tongue. He frowned for a second in thought and then put his out of character hat on by placing his hand on his head. “Okay, so Hirst has no reason to distrust Ger, every reason to believe Ger is innocent. They did grow up in the same village together. So just so you all know, I’m gonna be pushing for us to continue the rescue mission.”
It took a moment, but Sam’s eyes widened as realization and understanding finally came to him. “They’ll be able to leave?”
Garth clearly had a girlfriend (or boyfriend) he wasn’t telling anyone about, which was fine. Garth tended to be very private about his personal life, and Dean suspected he was dating someone with very changeable shift patterns, like a doctor, nurse or fire officer, someone like that. Or maybe someone who worked in a local restaurant. Or had kids and unreliable childcare—any number of dating possibilities that meant Garth might need to shift when he took time off from the shop.
Beneath Dean’s hands, the top of the side board he’d picked up from Goodwill, slowly lost its terrible orange paint job and revealed the original turn of the century oak beneath. It was nothing special, but Dean thought it would be a good place to store board games and tabletop gaming supplies, in case he wanted Charlie and the gang over. It was Dean’s Saturday off again and it was feeling like the days were flying by since he’d moved into The Ddraig just two weeks ago.
Much of it was a clear fire hazard, but before Dean could say anything to that effect, he noted that actually there was good distance between the fireplace and everything else, and the ceiling had sprinklers and smoke detectors. He could lay off the lecture.
“We need a way to look at these books that’s not just me. I am almost blind to their insights now.” Cas took the sauce off the heat and set it to one side. There was a ping and he reached down to the oven, opening it and sliding a tray of garlic bread out.
“Oh, what?” Cas asked like he was coming out of a doze.
“Yes,” Dean repeated. He’d been at work an hour that Friday morning and had already dealt with two dozen orders from people who didn’t have “thank god, it’s Friday” as a mantra.
“Cas, I can’t cut your nails with regular stuff. They’re too hard. I’d start small! Like the bolt cutters.” Dean was beginning to appreciate why no regular podiatrist was able to help Cas in the past. And, Dean considered, he’d just been soaking his toes for an age and the longer they left it, the drier the nails would become again. If they didn’t get this done soon, they’d have to soak his nails again.
Dean’s high school experience, where he’d blazed a path for Sam before graduating (which Sam had distinctly not followed), had not only involved the odd joint on school grounds, but taking drama and subsequently getting a leading role for each major production. Wasn’t Dean’s fault if their old drama teacher had little to work with—few guys joined the club—and everyone saw how most of the straight girls in the class acted better when they were around Dean. As if it was some kind of audition to be his girlfriend, which it kind of felt like it was a lot of the time. And then the Fall of
Cas gave Dean a narrow eyed glare and Dean chuckled. Continuing to eat and browse, it was on the fifth page of the search he’d done on the auction site when he finally saw what he was looking for. A type of herb that only appeared in one part of the Italian alps. Praying that the order would come into the country with little trouble, Dean placed a buy it now bid and found his eyes watering at the cost of shipping the herb via a private courier flight. Thankfully, it was Cas’s money he was spending and not his own.
“I’ll try better the next time I really meet one of your friends. You’re right that there was no need for me to be so… abrupt. And I’ll try to do better by you. I know I pushed you away and that we’ve been dancing around each other these past weeks, but, well, you’re the first I’ve felt drawn to in a long time, and I didn’t think I would ever again, quite frankly. Still, I am drawn to you Dean and I think you’re here for a reason… after all, you’re the only one who can find The Ddraig without help. It must mean something. I don’t believe in so many coincidences. Do you?”
“It is.”
“Cas?” Dean said with a yawn and then scrambled back into bed, and away from Cas. “What happened?!”
“Hello, Dean,” Jack returned holding his hand up as well.
and the ballroom in the fictional Overlook Hotel. Shivering, teeth clattering in his mouth, he opened the door and peered inside proper, seeing that the space was similarly in a state of mid-repair and decorating. He wondered what kinds of events might have been held there in decades past and prayed that none of them had been dodgy New Year’s Eve parties with corrupt souls. But if Dean was being fair to The Ddraig, he and Sam hadn’t dug up anything on the place that was like the horror depicted in the novel of The Shining. The only knowable blemish against the place here was the unexplained death in the 80’s.
Looking over to Cas, Dean felt a surge of affection as he watched Cas sign with Eileen and Sam, having a full conversation. But while Dean was happy for Cas to be making friends, he had kind of hoped that he might be able to get a dance with Cas.
Dean licked his lips and glanced around the kitchen.
Nodding, Sam picked up his flat white. “Now? Yeah.” He threw back the last of the frothy beverage and set the cup down. “Well, I need to get going.”
“No. I am a dragon, bound here by magic.”
“I’m glad you like it… did you find the supplies you went shopping for?” Cas asked.
“That went better than I was expecting,” Dean said as he thought about stage two.
Dean averted his eyes and threw a towel around Jack, and then found himself hugging the young man along with Cas and Charlie as they all laughed with relief that the spell had worked.
“You know you got nothing to be embarrassed about, right?” Dean said as he readied a pair of goggles over his eyes. “Like nothing.”
Not wanting Sam to go running off, but very aware of the fact that Cas needed help, Dean turned to Jack and said, “Keep an eye on him, will you? I need to finish the spell.”
Garth inhaled deeply through his nose and then rolled his eyes. “Fine, fine.” He changed the topic of conversation. “You okay running things over the weekend with Aaron?”
A grin stole over Cas’s face and he placed his hand in Dean’s.
Putting the latest scanned book onto the shelf for books he’d scanned, Dean felt his cell buzz in his pocket. He pulled it out and saw Sam was calling him. Dean was a little surprised to be getting a call from Sam so late, and hoped nothing had happened to him or Eileen.
“Yeah, you do that,” Dean agreed.
“Dean, maybe we should go get Cas.”
Dean pulled out his cell and went to where he’d bookmarked the hotel-toenail listing. “Yeah,” he said, passing his cell over to Charlie, “this place.”
Dean asked himself as the grounds settled in the coffee maker and the kettle went on the stove.
“Huh, okay.”
Dean turned to face Garth, empty tray in hand. “Well, there was no way anyone was getting up them in one piece after a good night out.” Dean waggled his eyebrows.
“Do you speak either?” Cas asked as the two of them talked loudly.
Dean shrugged. “I don’t think he can leave the hotel. I think he might be agoraphobic, y’know? Plus, he’s had problems with professionals in the past, or that’s what it sounded like.”
“I don’t believe it… and you just have to cut his nails? This makes like no sense in our capitalist world. None whatsoever. And his toenails make no sense in human biology at all. I hope you realize that. No human would have toenails like that.”
“I’m heading into town to get those few things for your... feet,” Dean announced as he stepped around Cas’s chair, which had shifted to follow the direction of the sun. “Anything else you need?”
I need you to know that you’re still welcome at the house. Okay. And I appreciate that you finding somewhere so fast means that Eileen and I can live together so much sooner, without her having to worry about her own lease coming to an end.” Sam put a hand through his hair and took a deep breath before continuing. “You’re still my brother and I will be there for you, whenever you need me. I know a lot’s happened in these past few years… and I’m still here to support you, no matter what.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean greeted, drawing level with his new landlord-cum-housemate.
, Dean thought as he thumbed the pages of the lease.
“Cas, please, can you, just please!” Dean cried, sweat beading across his chest by this point.
“Now is perfect,” Cas replied, slipping the blanket from his lap and setting it to one side of the lounge. He stood and his impossible toenails stretched on ahead of his frame. “This way,” he said and shuffled onwards.
There was a buzzing sound and Cas palmed his own cell, quickly looking at the screen and then stuffing it back in the pocket of his ripped jeans. “Holler when it’s ready,” he added and got to his feet, heading for his room. The mug of peppermint tea left on the table untouched.
“- and I said, ‘You can’t call your cat the Fluid Conspiracy,’ but Mrs Richard’s boy, you know, Timmy, was less than happy about that,” Garth said, finishing a conversation Dean hadn’t even heard going on. It was something Dean had tried to alert Garth to a dozen times before, but this fact always seemed to end up being ignored.
Cas looked at Dean with shocked eyes as Dean put the call on speaker and held the cell in the palm of his hand.
What had been over a thousand books to begin with, Cas had managed to sort through, with help, to the ones mostly likely and likely to have information around what they were after, getting the total down to 400. But a lot of the books weren’t short and it could take some time to scan pages and verify they were okay, before handing them over to the database and translation program that Charlie had set up for the project. The three of them had put a lot of work into the project since Cas’s big reveal, with much of their free time dedicated to shifting through dusty tomes.
“It still doesn’t make any sense. Look, lemme check in with my contact down at the police department. I didn’t even know there was a hotel there in that part of town.” Sam finished his beer and then turned to the dirty dishes that needed to be sorted. Dean rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything, though he was secretly glad that Sam wanted him to be safe when he moved. It wasn’t like Dean had been in a good head space when he’d moved in just over a year prior, or the year before that when he’d lived on his own.
Cas smirked—
“That, Sammy, was magic.”
by the Beastie Boys started playing. Dean found himself wishing it was his day to run the shop, so he could indulge in his classic rock habit—though, if he was giving the station its due, it did sometimes play stuff he liked too.
Dean jerked awake and found he was hanging out of the side of his bed, only his tangled sheets stopping him from hitting the floor. Cas stood beside him, a perplexed look on his face as he held his hands out in case Dean did fall. Behind Cas was one of the many chairs from his own rooms dragged in to Dean’s, a book resting on its seat cushion. Morning sunlight streamed through the bedroom windows, the sky beyond a gorgeous blue—it was looking to be a nice day.
Then Cas shifted them so their bodies were slotted together, Cas’s length pressed against Dean’s. He pulled Dean into his arms as Dean pulled Cas into his and they thrust and ground against each other, their dicks slipping in the water as they rutted, sliding and pressing. Breaking for air, Dean’s mouth found Cas’s shoulder and he bit down in the flesh there, sucking as he did. Cas returned the bite once Dean was done sucking, head bending over Dean’s shoulder and mouth working the skin there, making Dean tingle all over.
Life was very different from when Dean had first found the listing for Cas’s ad. For one, Cas was now able to travel beyond the hotel and his rear claws were being kept naturally short. In fact Dean had been on many thrilling flights through the air, goggles on his face, Cas between his legs, as they soared across the countryside of South Dakota and beyond.
“Okay,” Cas replied loudly as well.
Taking the hint, Cas renewed his efforts as he bounced Dean on his lap, hips snapping upwards erratically as Cas drew close to his release too. The two of them panted and moaned, breaths hard to come by as they soared closer and closer to the edge.
Cas paced away from Dean and walked over to the other side of the room to face Dean. He was caught in a wide beam of moonlight, his shadow large against the pale wall. “Are you sure you want to know Dean? You’ll see things differently if you do. I don’t think you’ll be able to go back to how things were before.”
“Oh?” Dean set the remote down and took a swig of his beer.
Cas paled a little and swallowed hard. “Okay… you won’t be long will you?”
Slowly, Dean opened Cas’s bedroom door, sound slowly leaking through.
Cas waved a hand at the shelves of books that towered around them. “My library. This is what we’re looking to scan and translate.”
“Okay. Anything I need to know before I head in? Like, is anyone else living here?” Sam asked as he got out of the car.
Dean found a staff staircase and headed on upstairs. Making his way onto the second floor, he came out on a hallway that had lower ceilings than the first floor, but were still quite high. Small chandeliers hung from the ceiling at regular intervals, brightening the off white walls and the black detailing. Doors lined the corridor, with large spaces between them, indicating large, spacious rooms. Dean wondered why so much of the building was kept like a hotel if it wasn’t really being used as a hotel anymore.
But just as he was wondering if he’d walked into yet another ghostly encounter, an unfamiliar man’s voice called, “In here.”
, Dean concluded as he moved to serve a customer who wondered if they did some form of pumpkin spice latte—they did and it wasn’t sickening like big brand ones.
Soon enough, Cas had helped Dean find a foot sized bowl, which he filled with quite warm water and set aside some towels next to it. He had Cas soak his feet while Dean got the rest of his tools sorted and sent a message to Bobby saying he’d buy him some new kit, because Dean suspected Bobby wouldn’t want it all back again. Ten minutes later, Dean had Cas take his feet out of the water, and he dried his feet gently with a towel, patting the water away.
Dean reveled in the contact, body hungry for Castiel’s touch. Hungrier than Dean realized, as he pressed into each point of contact and slipped his tongue into Cas’s mouth. He tasted the fresh mint of Castiel’s toothpaste, and felt the heat that was always there at the core of Castiel’s being.
Dean may have not been running off to Sammy, but he still wasn’t comfortable staying at The Ddraig. “Must be lonely, but look—why is there a ghost here?”
Walking up the path to the apartments and wondering if this one, the day after being told he had to go, would finally be his new home—Dean tried to keep his expectations in check. He still wanted the universe to line up in his favor for once. It had been three years since Cassie, two since Lisa, and Dean really just needed the rest of his life outside of his work to start going his way. Heading to the intercom for the building, he pressed the button for apartment 3A.
“Yes.”
“Lead the way,” Cas said warily.
“Now’s really not a good time!” Dean called back, but before he could conceal Cas’s freakishly long nails or anything, Eileen had rounded the corner of the counter top.
“Want me to make breakfast?” Dean asked as they rinsed off.
“You know you should just get it over with and book your next appointment.”
“Sorry,” Cas apologized and worked to disentangle them, carefully removing his halo and then helping Dean to remove his horns.
“You’re surprised?!”
Eileen and Cas came into the kitchen and she beamed at Sam and Dean.
“Wait, you believe ghosts are real?” Dean pulled away from Cas and shakily got to his legs.
“You got it in one!” Garth grinned and went over to the laptop he used to run music in the coffee shop and set up the quirky, and very British, BBC 6 Music radio station he usually left it on, playing over the internet.
“I’ll see what I can do.”
“Dean?”
“Remind Aaron that Benny’s coming by with cakes not long before closing. One of you needs to make sure that the display case is ready for them. Oh! And it includes the new chocolate banana muffin recipe Benny’s trying out. Plus some more batwing cookies and spider mallow balls…” Garth took a breath. “I’m sorry Dean… I don’t know what’s gotten into me.”
If Dean had access to medical grade cutting tools—like surgical tools—he knew he might be able to make a difference, but there was no way he could get his hands on something like that.
“Well, he has been hanging out in what’s probably the warmest part of the hotel.”
“Not a dragon?”
As the kiss deepened, Cas’s hands became insistent in their exploration, every muscle had to be traced, every curve pursued and then as he trailed his hand down Dean’s front, Cas finally came to cup Dean’s aching length. Cas’s touch was curious as he brushed his hand down and then up Dean’s length, touch featherlight and teasing. Dean moaned into Cas’s mouth and chased the contact of Cas’s hand.
“Good morning, Viet-nam!” Charlie greeted cheerily, sliding her headphones down as she bustled into the shop. Dean was already reaching for fresh grounds to put through the espresso machine, as Charlie sidled brightly up to the counter. Charlie’s long red hair was bright against the green zip-up hoodie she had on with her jeans.
by Pink Floyd side two all played through and he hadn’t gotten up to change the LP to another album or to flip it back to side one. He’d been there for over an hour, boots off, staring up at the white ceiling.
“Look, I can, uh, explain.” Cas picked at his burger.
Heading into the ensuite, Dean took in the partially drunk glass of water and the bookmark between the pages of Cas’s book, which had shown he’d made significant progress through the novel. Dean for a moment wondered what Cas’s secret was to reading that fast, but then pushed the thought away as he hurried over to the tub and started pulling things out of the bag. He handed Cas a pair of goggles and a respirator, and helped him put them on. Then Dean put a matching pair of goggles and respirator on himself. Then, from out of the bag he pulled out an extension cord and ran it out to an outlet in Castiel’s room and then plugged a Dremel into it. A selection of Dremel attachments were set side in a box beside it. Then Dean pulled out bolt cutters of various sizes, huge metal files that were usually used in woodwork and a Japanese wood saw: he set them all down neatly on the tiles beside the tub.
Sam had been curious when Dean had decided to live with a roommate again, considering what he was earning at AquaWheels. But the breakup with Lisa had made Dean feel like he wasn’t ready to live by himself yet and he’d seen Cas’s ad. It had taken less than a week for Dean to move in and maybe he’d questioned a little, in his head, how Cas could afford the place, but the trust fund idea had settled in his mind early and he just kept reminding himself of it whenever he wondered too much.
“No idea. But it’s not like many people know about the place.”
“Oh my god!” Sam shouted hoarsely.
“Jack?”
“Yeah, I’m fine Sammy-”
If Dean didn’t have to handle another book after all of this, he could die happy—at least that’s how it felt after he closed up the tenth book he’d scanned that Friday evening. Dungeons and Dragons had been canceled because Dorothy had a bad cold and Charlie didn’t want anyone else catching it. Foolishly, Dean had supposed that making further headway on scanning Castiel’s library was a good idea. Further along, on a different row, Cas was helping him, scanning another section of books.
, Dean thought as he headed on out of his rooms and went back down the hall to Castiel’s. As he walked, he went over the tips he’d picked up, including which direction to cut. He was going to get Cas to keep his feet in the bath, as it would make it easier to deal with the shrapnel of what they were about to undertake.
Glancing back down to the impossible nails, Dean could understand that maybe the medical profession might take advantage of Castiel’s situation or decide to treat him like some kind of freak. He met Castiel’s eyes again and there was a sincere look there, begging for Dean to help.
Sam’s mouth opened, but no sound came out as he slowly slid down the wall, trying to make himself as small as possible.
Laying out on the gravel to get the keys, Dean fumbled under the car and finally hooked them before scrambling to his feet.
So, when Sam came over on Thanksgiving morning, Eileen in tow, he found Dean with a laptop and a tablet, the tablet with his preferred recipe on and the laptop monitoring an auction for griffin feathers.
“I understand.” The smile didn’t leave Cas’s face. It was a level of calm happiness that Dean hadn’t expected.
“How do you do that?” Dean found himself asking, breaking the companionable silence that had settled between the two of them.
“I could go for coffee,” Dean said as he waited for Cas to ask why he had come back into the hotel. Why his freak out seemed to be over or why Dean wasn’t somewhere else across the city.
Dean jumped as Cas knocked on his car window. It was dark now and Cas was wrapped up in a blue knitted sweater, something even in the light spilling from the hotel entrance, he was sure went well with Cas’s eyes.
The whole shift passed like there was something invisible between Garth and Dean, and Garth was visibly puzzled by it. Each time he tried to start conversations with Dean, Dean struggled to remain his useful cheerful self. When there was a real lull in the afternoon, Dean knew Garth was going to try talking to him.
Slumping back down against the mattress, Dean called through the door, “What is it?”
Wasting no time, Cas ducked down between Dean’s legs and held him open with his strong fingers, tongue teasing wet and hot. Dean whimpered as Cas’s tongue got past that first ring of muscle, determined and sending waves of want cascading through Dean, laving at the ring of muscle each time he pulled back before pushing back in. As he was pulled apart by Cas’s tongue, he suspected that perhaps a part of Cas’s dragon-ness was letting his tongue go deeper than a human’s would.
? Dean wondered as he finished with Cas’s left foot.
Ten minutes later, Aaron was on his way and Garth was ready to head out.
“What, is there something on my face?” Charlie asked, touching her skin.
“Sounds just peachy,” Dean replied. “Four on Monday it is.”
“No, I don’t think so… Is Wi-Fi included?”
“Well, he looked pretty human to me. I think I’m going to sign.”
Going into autopilot, Dean drove the busy roads of Sioux Falls as the working day began to end, and allowed his mind to be completely blank. He drove to The Ddraig, finding it with no effort and parked up like he normally did. It wasn’t until he cut the engine that he remembered he hadn’t put a cassette on or the radio like he normally would.
“Yes,” Cas caught on, “we could add another ‘search query’ to the mix,” he said with air quotes and a smile. Dean looked at that smile and felt his stomach turning at the sheer beauty in front of him. It had been weeks since their kiss, and still Cas was keeping his distance. He wanted to reach out and touch Cas’s face, but he held back, because he didn’t want Cas to pull away. Even though he might not.
“Seems like a good deal.”
“You can see ghosts too?” Dean rubbed at the back of his neck, as he tried to understand what was going on.
“You understand that until just recently I had no idea anything like you… anyone like Dean or Jack existed. Right? It’s a lot to get my head around and I want to make sure my brother is safe,” Sam replied.
“Yes I am and I do,” Dean gloated.
“I messed a couple up… and figured it would be better to just buy Bobby some new ones.”
“Any news on the house?” Dean asked after a sip of water.
Sam sat on the edge of Dean’s bed, face a picture of concern. “Do you think something at the apartment might have set you off? Gas or something?”
, Dean thought, and then caught the metallic gray of a closed laptop, settled against the feet of the chair.
“Would you like coffee with your breakfast?” Cas asked, back to Dean as he finished plating up the bacon. There were two plates waiting with scrambled eggs on it. There was also a pile of cooked spinach and button mushrooms, and a plate stacked with cinnamon toast. More than Cas could surely eat all to himself—
“Well, I mean, it’s not like the castle that gets used for things like LARP for
The four of them agreed it was fine and then slowly filtered out of Charlie’s place, heading out into the cool night air. Dean shivered a little and pulled his green jacket tighter around himself as he made his way to the Impala.
, Dean thought, reflecting on the size of the rooms he would have available to himself.
“See, what?” Bobby asked, looking around and out the windows, confusion clear on his face.
Cas stepped out around the bed, moving towards Dean’s corner. “Look, Dean, I am no threat to you.”
Cas gave a thoughtful, calculating look, eyes darting towards the roof of the Impala and then focused back on Dean. “It’s a blood moon tomorrow,” he said, like that explained everything Dean had seen.
A traitorous voice in the back of his mind supplied as they went and fetched the rest of his furniture.
“Excellent! I’ll come round tomorrow so I can check what we need to plan for! Thanks, Cas. Look I need to go now, but tomorrow… so long as Dean meets me. Bye!” Sam hung up.
“What is it?” Cas asked.
“Hmm, could have some kind of contamination. I’ll check-”
Dean gulped and opened up the moisturizer, the argan oil in it offering a light citrus smell and squirted a small amount onto the top of Cas’s right foot. Raising his hands, Dean gripped either side, sliding his thumbs through the white glob of moisturizer and started to push it around the lightly damp skin of Cas’s foot. Spread and push, spread and push. Thumbs circling and then his other fingers joining in as he worked the moisturizer to the sole of Cas’s foot and down to his heel and up to his toes. Then he started in on the joints around Castiel’s toes and a moan escaped Cas as he noticeably relaxed back into the cushions of his high backed chair. The rumbling moan traveled through Dean, vibrating through his core and dick.
Dean pondered ruefully as he stepped further into the kitchen.
“I know you’re a dragon,” Dean continued. “Can’t we just, y’know, try? Like, how will we ever know if we can work, unless we try?”
“Hey, I’m here to see the apartment?” Dean called out to the vast empty studio space. Now that he was looking over the slick white surfaces, he began to try and recall the rental ad he’d seen online. He must have seen the space was in his price range, right? But as he stared around the polished insides, with an open plan kitchen with what looked suspiciously like real granite countertops—he was beginning to think that maybe he’d been mistaken.
Dean gulped, worried about how Cas might take that observation, but Cas just smiled and stayed on topic.
“Ha, already? Okay, but I am in charge of pie.”
Dean laughed and took a deep breath. “Because I’ve never told Sam that I can see dead people. One other person in the whole wide world knows… my friend, Charlie. And that’s because I helped her with a haunting once. Well, as far as I could, which wasn’t much.”
“Okay, get this. It’s like this mockumentary style horror comedy… Like
“We’re out of Cap’n Crunch… again,” Dean lamented, eying the empty box on the kitchen counter with immense suspicion. He knew Cas thought that the cereal was like coating his tongue with noxious molecules, so Cas hadn’t eaten their last box. Staring toward Jack, who was eating a bowl of Wheaties and trying to look like he was enjoying it, Dean found that the younger man was blushing, up to the tips of his ears.
“Because, Sam wouldn’t have believed me.”
“Well, I’m sorry. I underestimated you.” Cas shrugged and turned away. “If you want to leave, leave, but I’m still going to make breakfast and fresh coffee.”
“I’ll fetch tea,” Cas suggested.
“Yes, and Jack was killed for nothing.”
That was the most Cas had said all day. Dean rolled his eyes and pushed back from his desk, locking his computer as he stood. He stretched, the loose jeans he was wearing threatening to slip from his hips, and walked over to the kitchen in their mainly open plan, loft apartment.
Dean swallowed awkwardly. It had been a long time since he’d even brought anyone back to his room at Sam’s, let alone spent a night in someone else’s bed. After the initial rejection from Lisa, he’d had a series of quick flings and then pulled back completely. Sam maybe knew that at least two of those flings had been guys, but Dean hadn’t been able to talk about it with him. While Charlie definitely knew and Charlie wasn’t saying anything. After going from one long relationship into another, and having both fail so spectacularly on him, Dean hadn’t been in a rush to find someone else to fill that whole significant other vacancy.
Sam gave Dean a skeptical look, but didn’t push the line of questioning any further. Spending a moment staring into their respective drinks, Dean was slightly touched that Sam had found time in his busy schedule to come in and see Dean. He knew Sam cared about him, but Dean had spent enough of his life wondering if maybe he was getting in the way of everyone else’s—something he’d been working on with his therapist since Sam had persuaded him to see one.
Sliding his cell back into his pocket, Dean gave Cas a long appraising look. “What makes you think that this is a good idea?”
and one we haven’t seen before…
Looking away, Cas became lost in thought. Dean waited, staying where he was and trying not to stare too much. It was kind of difficult and the tension between them had yet to have any further discourse after Cas had stopped the other week. Noticing Jack looking between them, Dean averted his gaze completely. The conversations between the Dean and Cas for the past two weeks had been many, but none had talked about the ways either of them looked at each other. And for as much as Dean caught himself looking at Cas, he kept catching Cas looking at him when he didn’t think Dean would notice.
Castiel frowned and then pointed towards a bedside table. “There, the Aaranovitch, if you please.”
Above him, Cas sighed and then sat down next to Dean. He scooted over to him and dimly, Dean was aware of arms wrapping around him from the side, of the heat of another body joining his own, the heat bleeding through his shirt and jeans. It was like sitting beside a radiator and that was what Dean needed after what had happened downstairs. Cas breathed with purpose and soon Dean found the rapid breaths he’d been taking slowly leveled out and he was breathing something approaching normal, his heart rate slowed back down to a more typical pace.
As he stood in the main entrance, Dean felt a weariness that made moving his legs difficult. Before he knew what was happening, Cas had swept him into a bridal carry and proceeded to take him upstairs. Dean protested at first, but then felt himself comforted and lulled by the heat radiating from Cas.
“Yes.”
Once the order was confirmed, Dean turned the screen off and started back on his stack of pancakes, now cold.
“No, but… This one isn’t like the one we used to bring Jack back, there shouldn’t be anything dangerous that can go wrong.” Dean shrugged. “At least not massively so.”
“The east wing, why?”
“I’m sure you know already, but Doctor McLeod is waiting on you to make an appointment.” Sam looked up from his drink. “She left me a message to remind you.”
Sam, Eileen, Cas, Jack and John were all in a den that Cas had set up in what must normally be a private reception room. So far, no one had killed each other, despite helping to put Christmas decorations up. It was Christmas Eve, and there was already a real Christmas tree in the hotel with presents underneath it. Stockings. A fireplace. Dean couldn’t quite get over how far they were pushing the Christmas thing, but with Cas and Jack having a lot of catching up to do with celebrating cheer and good will to all sentient beings, Dean had figured they should go for it. Everyone was staying at the hotel.
Dean liked Thomas and Mrs Henderson—he’d only met Thomas’s father once—but their brief time together always stirred a little something inside Dean. Regret and sadness mostly—regret that his ex, Lisa, had not only pushed Dean away from her, but also away from her son Ben, who Dean had gotten along with well. Over the past year, Dean had wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what had gone wrong. While he still wasn’t sure, Dean had a feeling. His instinct told him it was to do with how he had never been able to live up to Lisa’s needs—someone who could be there, mind, body and soul, twenty-four-seven. But Dean couldn’t do that, not in his old job when one callout had gone terribly wrong.
“Cheap tricks?” Cas’s voice bellowed as Charlie turned around. Dean blinked and suddenly it wasn’t Castiel the human in the room with them, it was Castiel the dragon.
And then Sam shouted from behind him, “What the hell?!!! DEAN?!!”
Charlie started to read and as she did her eyes slowly opened wider. “No rent if you cut their toenails?! What the frell?!”
But now as Dean pulled his keys out of his pocket and got into his car and checked his cell phone for new messages, sweat making his t-shirt stick to his back, Dean was thinking maybe it hadn’t been the pot. And maybe, just maybe what had happened when he was four wasn’t just some nightmare. Or all the other times things had been strange. Nerves tingling with unspent adrenaline, Dean put his hands up on his steering wheel and worked on his breathing.
Dean didn’t feel that much like resting, so he picked up his cell and started looking for rental listings that were less likely to be haunted. But ten minutes in, his head started to hurt and he put his cell back down on the bedside table and picked up his tea instead.
“Why do you only
Jack went through the near closed ballroom doors and Dean opened them to follow. As he stepped into the space, his vision was filled up with the sight of Castiel—only he was his dragon self and not looking at all like a human.
“Right, of course.”
“Dean?” Cas whispered, keeping his freak out as private as possible in the busy kitchen.
“You need the space so Eileen has a studio to work in, right?”
He couldn’t imagine what kind of rift could have happened, though Dean remembered a time when Sam and their dad were at each other’s throats almost every night. Still, they talked happily enough in the present. Even hugged—something Dean couldn’t have imagined when Sam was 16.
“I understand that you want to leave, but please understand, I didn’t know you would be able to see Jack or really sense him. Most people can’t,” Cas explained.
“What did you use in the past?” Dean asked.
“Yeah. That an original Gaggia espresso machine in the kitchens?”
, Dean thought to himself and then shook away the memories of the other day.
“He’s not going to hurt you!” Dean yelled over her. “If he wanted to eat anyone, he could have done it to me when I first stepped foot here. And he hasn’t touched a hair on my head!”
“Great. Garth said Benny’s swinging by before closing.” Dean finished making up the latte he’d been making before Aaron’s arrival.
“To his house?”
Everyone else soon got their non-pizza hands on their heads, except for Charlie, who was quietly watching the conversation unfold. Ash was playing a well-regarded tiefling wizard who was known to be a bit of risk taker when it came to magic. Kevin was a half-elf fighter of renowned martial skill, who tended towards neutral good, due to years as a soldier.
Back in the safety of his bedroom, Dean couldn’t think. He was laid out on the top of his bed, feet on the headboard, shoes off, an LP of
“Hey, they’re not all assholes. Jerk!” Sam said, with no real venom.
Silence stretched between them for several moments as Dean’s brain continued to whir through what it would be like to be institutionalized for speaking the truth. Eventually, he sat up and took a long sip of coffee.
“Thank you,” Charlie said with a smile. “So… you said yesterday you have a viewing after your shift today?”
He swiped down the listings page on his tablet, looking for something that met his criteria. It wasn’t like he was being too picky, but cost and distance was an issue. He could drive, but he didn’t exactly enjoy sitting in traffic.
“Yeah.”
“Merry Christmas, Cas,” Dean declared. He was about to say something else, but Cas pulled Dean into his arms and proceeded to kiss all thoughts and air away.
“How is it we can see ghosts?”
The front door opened, ringing a bell just as
Nothing happened.
but Cas had stiffened at the mention of family and then just shrugged. That was on Monday.
Garth came to a bit and slowly nodded. “Wisconsin.”
Dean thought about their earlier trips and where to avoid the end of rush hour. “No, I shouldn’t be. Think you can stay here while I get what I need? We can exchange cell numbers in case you get worried?”
“No one’s going to hurt you,” Dean promised, but the look Sam gave him didn’t say he believed Dean.
“Still not okay, Cas!”
Castiel had given Dean the down-low on all things werewolf that he could recall. Silver. Phases of the moon. Feeding on hearts. No cure that he knew of. Dean had talked him through it with understanding patience, while making sure Dean drank a cup of tea to help soothe his nerves (Dean would have preferred something stronger). The only reassurance Dean had was that Garth liked chaining himself up in his basement, which indicated he didn’t go around and try devouring human hearts on the regular.
Looking around the ballroom, Dean found a window with an open shutter. He walked across the immense floor and looked out at it to see the moon shining down in the night sky above. As he stood by the window, the glass started to frost up and Dean’s shivering grew harder.
Dean shrugged and finished booting up the coffee shop’s cash register, as they prepped for Tuesday. It was a technological wonder as far as Dean was concerned, running off an Android tablet, with a cash draw underneath and a small white boxy card reader that connected wirelessly. The cash register the shop had originally had been prone to periods of rebellion and just not working. A longtime coffee fiend and frequent customer, Charlie, had helped kit them out with the new system after witnessing a particularly horrific register malfunction. She’d also been the one to take Dean to the local emergency room.
“It’s amazing here! I didn’t realize how big it was on Halloween. But in the day, it’s breathtaking.” Eileen looked around, her gaze taking in everything. “Oh! Are you making pie, Dean? Sam always says you make the best pie.”
They had deadlines to meet after all, though Dean wondered if they’d be able to get enough machine staff together in time for the next prototype. So, Dean had been working from home for just under a week when the order started on March 24th. Working all sorts of hours.
“You don’t wanna walk around the block?”
“I don’t know.”
“Don’t know or won’t say.”
“Okay, okay. But thank you.” Garth finished setting out clean mugs and cups.
Cas smiled and leaned in, giving Dean a quick chaste kiss to this left cheek.
“Gift? Curse, Cas,
But, if he was taking a moment to be honest with himself—a dangerous thing—it felt kind of weird to be living with his younger brother. He was, after all, in his mid 30s and should have been striking out on his own and all those other societal expectations that breathed down his neck each time he visited their parents. Dean’s love life was permanently both up for and not up for discussion.
“Assholes to defend.”
Then Dean’s skin went icy cold and the hazy form of Jack appeared in the doorway.
Being a firefighter wasn’t exactly easy when you didn’t manage to save the day. It certainly wasn’t easier when you may or may not have been seeing the spirits of the recently departed being taken away by strange spectral beings.
“Uh…” Cas struggled to find something to say.
“You not feeling so hot?” Dean asked. Garth never took sick days.
It was certainly something he’d be bringing up in his next session with Rowena. Dean would have to adjust some of the language he used, so that Cas’s dragon-self was mentioned, but he was getting used to that.
“Uh, yes?”
“What is he?” Sam hissed.
Now, Dean would have just offered to carry Cas to a seat and get his tools, but at that moment Sam had decided that he and Eileen should take advantage of the key that Dean had given him at the start of the month. The doors to the kitchen slapped open and shut and footsteps approached from the far side of the room.
Eventually his feet brought him back to the sun lounge and everyone else. Dean took his spot on the couch and put his feet up, snuggling up to Cas when he and Sam finally appeared again, with drinks and snacks in tow.
“Right.” Dean huffed out a breath, cracking an awkward smile.
“My name’s Sam, not Sammy!”
Dean, do you remember last night at all?” Cas prompted.
“And so the spell backfired on them and you?”
The hissing bubbling sound of water cascading down the side of a pan made Dean let go and Cas jump away as he went to rescue the noodles. Dean stood back as Cas went to rescue the noodles and then went to drain the water, using his hand as a colander to stop the noodles slipping into the sink. In Dean’s chest, his heart hammered at what had almost been. Legs a little unsteady, he headed over to where he knew the plates and rest of the crockery they used was kept, and pulled out two pasta bowls and side plates. Dean set them down on the side so that Cas could plate up as Dean grabbed the side salad and some cutlery and headed into the dining room.
“I hope so,” Cas said. They stood like that for a moment, just looking at the books and then Cas turned, stepping into Dean’s space.
Dean set to work, turning on the faucet and setting the plug. He found the lavender bubble bath and poured a long dollop into the flowing water—it was a large bath, after all. He then kept his hand in the water, swirling the suds as they formed, and kept an eye on the water’s temperature as the bathtub slowly filled. The water got to a near scorchingly high temperature before Dean started to wonder if Cas could sense the temperature was so hot.
Evening was upon them and all Dean could do was think of each and every weird little thing he’d encountered over the years. Books moving around shelves at Cassie’s old place was one. His book collection on the shelf below Cassie’s had not been her sort of thing, but the books would somehow, when Dean wasn’t looking, manage to move themselves around. Falling off the shelves or being stacked up in weird ways on the shelves rather than having their spines facing out—and Cassie and Dean had been the only ones living in that house. They hadn’t tended to have friends over, preferring to go out.
And before Sam said anything, Dean could guess what was up for discussion. The timing—a year since Dean moved in. The weekend trip to Wichita with Eileen two weeks prior. The sudden interest in Ikea furniture.
Eyes going wide, Dean nodded dumbly as Cas made sure the shower door was closed. Then he stepped closer to Dean, pushing him under the water as he snaked a hand up and brought Dean’s mouth to his. The kiss sent a shiver of anticipation down Dean’s spine, making his dick throb. Kissing through the spray, Dean allowed himself to be pliant to Castiel’s touch as his hands stroked and caressed every available part of Dean. Smoothing down his arms, over his chest, across his buttocks, the touch slightly warmer than the shower.
Closing the ballroom doors behind him, Dean set down the lamp and began setting out what he needed for the spell. He was halfway through drawing a series of complex diagrams on the tiles and walls in chalk when Sam opened the doors and slipped inside.
Setting Charlie down on a long cream couch, Dean stood up and asked Cas to go get some water. It took some splashing and soothing sounds, but eventually, Dean roused Charlie from her faint. Though she started to yell when she saw Cas.
Picking up the book, he motioned for Cas to head on into the bathroom and he followed behind him.
But Dean could just about understand what the topic of conversation had been, so he nodded and said, “I’m guessing ‘Fluid Conspiracy’ is based on the whole ‘cats are a fluid’ meme, right?”
“Spacious?” Sam nodded to himself. “Well, I tried to stop by yesterday, but I think you’ve given me the wrong address. I couldn’t find it.”
Cas was like jelly in Dean’s hands, as he spread the moisturizer and worked it into the skin of Cas’s left foot. Low little breathy moans kept coming from Cas and it made things incredibly awkward as Dean worked at Cas’s foot in his lap. But he followed through with what he promised, aching as he did, and finished by putting the new socks on Castiel’s feet—a piercing sky blue like Cas’s eyes.
Though for Cas and Jack it wasn’t a rewatch, it was their first time watching the remake. So Dean made sure no one spoiled the film.
“I’ll get right on it,” Dean said and headed over to the laptop, mentally kicking himself as he did. He got the search query up and running, wondering what the hell a dragon would wear to a Halloween costume party. His time in The Ddraig had taught him many things about the supernatural world, but not their predilections for human activities.
“Sure,” Jack answered.
“Well, Cas, if you’ll have me, I’d be happy to be the newest tenant of The Ddraig.”
Not that Dean was there at The Bunker on Monday, because Cas had encouraged Dean to move in from the start of the week after a quick visit to drop off the lease. And Dean couldn’t blame him—he was still having difficulties with his nails. Dean had offered to cut them there and then, but Cas was insistent Dean moved in first so that Cas could show he would keep up his end of things. Dean had also been watching videos on pedicures and amateur podiatry in order to figure out how to deal with Cas’s nails and make sure his feet stayed healthy, in among packing his life into boxes.
It wasn’t Dean’s place to probe why the guy couldn’t leave, there was no GPS tracking anklet in sight. Instead he took a tentative step closer and said, “Hey, how about I check the place out and then we can discuss whether you want me as a tenant? Huh? How’s that sound?”
The sound of typing filled the workshop and Dean turned back to his sideboard project. Contemplating what grit level of sandpaper he was going to need for the wood once it was dry, Dean wanted to make sure everything was smooth and ready for staining. Just as he started looking at the selection Bobby had stashed in a drawer, Dean’s thoughts stopped as he looked back to Charlie. He stared at her until she stopped typing.
“You see, further into the east wing, there are energies that I can’t quite control or fathom. In fact, I can’t actually go quite near them. That I believe is where the spell was cast, or they tried to cast it. Jack was likely a sacrifice to power the spell.”
“Right? Anyway, I’ll give you the grand tour.” Dean cut the engine and got out of the car.
Cas gave Dean what could only be described as a death glare.
If there was a list of things Dean didn’t really expect to be getting phone calls about from Sam, this was one of them. “That was the first time you got drunk. And if I remember correctly, I had to hold your hair out of the way while you spent a good half hour throwing chunks over the back porch.”
“And I am thankful for Dean,” Cas said before closing the distance and pressing a light kiss to his lips.
Dean’s eyes went wide. “We are not talking about my damn love life!”
A fresh frown creased Cas’s brow and then comprehension. He blinked hard and stepped forward, each step leaving him shaking as he got to the invisible line that marked the end of The Ddraig and the beginning of the regular street beyond. He took a deep breath and then stepped across the threshold and stood right beside Dean for a second, before taking another step onto the sidewalk. Cas looked around, astonishment clear on his face.
“Morning, Char. Usual?” Dean asked.
“And you?” Dean pushed.
“Please ask Charlie to help… If Jack is amenable to her knowing about him. I… I will also tell her of what I am.”
Though as he looked at the space, Dean did consider one thing he might treat himself to, now that he had more privacy. But he would need to sort out address changes for all his accounts first. Forgetting unpacking, Dean settled down with his tablet, sat in the middle of the open living room floor, cell beside him, and started changing his personal information as needed.
Charlie closed her eyes and took a deep breath before opening them again. She cradled her latte between her hands. “At least wait until Sam’s found out if there’s any history with this guy or that place, huh?”
The following Monday evening, Charlie was driven to The Ddraig to commence Operation Scan All The Things. As Dean pulled up in his parking space, Charlie was already ogling the building beyond the car, mouth hanging ajar.
Cas shook his head in an empathetic no.
Silence, punctuated by Sam’s rapid breaths and Cas’s shifting bulk filled the air.
“Nope,” Dean said dejectedly as he backed out of a rental listing he’d been viewing. The place sounded like it wanted sex in lieu of rent. He looked for a report button, found it and was pleasantly surprised to find an option to report the listing as something like that. He hoped no one got taken in by the advertiser before the ad was dealt with.
“I missed something, didn’t I?” Sam asked, setting his laptop down and picking up his beer.
“Cas,” Dean begged, though what he was begging for, he wasn’t sure, until Cas’s mouth found his again and Cas forced his tongue past Dean’s lips. And then Dean was coming, spilling in-between them, crying into Cas’s mouth and shuddering as he did. Then Cas whined, body shaking as he followed Dean.
Sam declined an invitation to dinner by Cas when it came time for him to leave, so Dean found himself spending his first Saturday evening in The Ddraig watching Castiel cook in the hotel’s cavernous kitchen. Ten years ago, before he moved away to be with Cassie, if Dean had the shift off, he would have been out trawling bars back in Lawrence. Finding a lay had been easy and Dean knew he still turned heads—he was reminded of it almost every shift at The Bunker. He’d only let up on the drinking a bit when he’d gotten together with Lisa, but then he found himself finding excuses to head out when their fighting got too much.
Cas nodded. “Yes.”
And then there was Jack. The arrival of griffin feathers meant that they were finally ready to try and bring Jack back to the land of the living full time. Then stage two would be finishing getting the components necessary to get Cas and Jack free of The Ddraig.
Approaching The Ddraig, Dean could tell the moment Cas cast the spell, because as Dean approached the street it was on, Sam gasped.
“How’d you help?” Cas asked with a quirk of his eyebrow.
and drove downtown, ready to kick Wednesday in the ass.
Dean turned and walked away from the kitchen. When he’d first heard them talking, he’d expected Sam to give Cas just the usual talk, adapted for a dragon of course (not eating him being high on the list) but he didn’t expect Sam to feel that protective of him. At least not after asking Dean to finally move out. He had two people in his life now that wanted what was best for Dean, not for themselves, and Dean found he struggled to understand or accept that.
“It’s fine, I’ll make sure to add it to the grocery order later,” Cas said.
“I’m gonna try these first, okay?” Dean said louder than he would normally speak so as not to be muffled by the mask.
“Look, clearly, you’re… concerned,” Cas hazarded, hands up in a placating gesture. “But, Dean, please. I can explain or at least apologize.”
Dean huffed out a breath and looked to the clock on the kitchen wall above the refrigerator. “Oh, would you look at the time. Some of us have to work early-”
That bought a laugh from Cas before he continued more seriously, “But your brother doesn’t know about your gift?”
Dean was out and heading across the front yard before Sam could say anything else. He really did feel better. Whatever the previous afternoon had been, it didn’t seem to have permanently affected Dean, though he didn’t want to dwell on what he had experienced back there. Instead he got in the Impala, slotted in a Metallica cassette of
“The club have just gone to Northern Ireland. Belfast specifically,” Cas explained.
Dean let out a slow breath and said, “I’ll come to you.” He ended the call and pocketed his cell.
“You’re sure?”
Dean’s brain gave up and he fainted.
Dean juggled the bags he carried and walked over to the bedside table. The book in question was on top and called
Hello. I am looking for a roommate to live in my home with me. It is a former hotel and you would have one of the penthouse suites as your room, with access to the wider hotel and communal spaces. Yes, the rent is free in terms of monetary payment from you. See, my toenails have reached such an extraordinary length that it is physically impossible for me to walk now. This is where you come in: I need you, the applicant, to trim my toenails for me. And I know what you’re thinking: “Oh, that’s not that bad,” but I can assure you—it IS that bad. Using standard nail clippers on these babies will not suffice. You will need to use scissors—maybe even garden shears on them. Adequately doing so will equate to three months worth of rent. After which my toenails will have grown back to their current length, and you can trim them again for another three months of rent. They are going to keep growing. There is nothing I can do to stop it anymore. I have accepted defeat.
“Everything okay, Cas?” Dean asked.
Spinning round to look at Dean, Cas’s eyes grew wide and Dean saw how close he’d come up to Cas, but he didn’t take a step back. Cas gave Dean an awkward smile and an inquiring look.
“Your brother?”
A blush rose up on Sam’s cheeks and he ducked his head. “Yeah.”
“Dean you know, I can’t go beyond the walls!”
Sighing to himself, Dean went and found the open bread and put some toast on before fixing himself a cup of coffee. The domesticity of the whole situation was almost making him feel sick, but it was countered with how much he was enjoying being around Cas like this. Like they were two people who organized groceries and shopping together like a couple. That Jack was there to witness all of this almost embarrassed Dean, but he tried not to think about that too much.
Dean picked up the remote and paused the episode. “Hey, maybe we should start back at the start of the episode. I think you missed most of it.”
“Of course.”
“Yes?” Cas asked, turning.
Dean tried to go over everything that Sam had just said. “So, a whole lot of nothing?”
Dean glanced to Cas and met his concerned gaze. “Well it had his shape and hair… But it had big sharp teeth and claws. And it snarled… growled… like a really angry dog.”
Dean had showered and changed since his series of minor heart attacks. He’d even gotten some more sleep and then called Sam, asking if he wanted to come over. Dean had almost expected Sam to invite Eileen, but apparently she was teaching a Saturday art class. So Dean had headed on over to Sam’s, feeling a small twinge of regret mixed with frustration when he’d seen the place and then dampened down the moment Sam had gotten in the car.
When they finally pulled back to get some air, Dean launched a shower of snowflakes down the front of his borrowed beanie.
Sam was about to say something and then stopped, eyes focused on the bottom right of his laptop screen.
“Need me to get you anything after my shift?” Dean asked.
“Thank you. Now please, can you please leave me to the rest of my Saturday?” Dean thumped his head back against his pillows.
“Sorry!” Dean called from his end of the mattress, which was closest to the house.
Dean took his time getting to sleep that night.
Room for rent
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Cas persisted. He reached out and placed a warm hand on Dean’s shoulder. Slowly the heat from Cas’s hand started to warm Dean, and he felt like he was being dragged out of an icy lake of confusion.
brother got so bossy, and estimated it was somewhere between the first time Sam kissed a girl and making captain of his high school soccer team. Thinking more on it while Sam continued to panic on Dean’s behalf, Dean couldn’t decide if in fact there was a degree of causality there and that, in fact, Sam became bossy, which helped him become soccer team captain, which then helped him to kiss his girl, because “popularity” of some kind had happened.
Still, regardless of how much Dean worked, Dean had no idea what Cas really did when he wasn’t there at the apartment. And the more time he spent around Cas as the world outside came to a stop, the less he understood him.
“Dean, wonderful to hear from ye. So, ready to schedule your next session?” Rowena asked, Scottish twang renewed just that bit more, likely from spending time with family during her vacation.
“Yes, I am,” Cas said. “And you are?”
Dean nodded and then eased himself up into a sitting position, the blip not really registering. “Now that’s out of the way, think we can, y’know, maybe watch something? I’m guessing you’re done working for now, right?”
Opening his mouth to reply, Cas doubled up and then buckled down the side of the counter to land in a heap on the floor. Dean rushed from the coffee machine as Jack slid off his stool and they both ran to Cas’s side. For a brief moment, Dean thought some ill-effect from the spell work to help Jack had finally caught up with them, but then Dean looked down the length of Cas’s body, towards his feet.
“Then it doesn’t work... and we help you with whatever you decide after.”
“Cas, why don’t the wards seem to work on me?” Dean gave Cas a pointed look.
an iron stomach. Garth’s silver earring in the right ear phase—concern and best poker face. But that silver stud took on a whole lot more meaning in hindsight, when Dean considered it, because what had been passed off as it getting infected and healing over meant something else now.
“Cas,” Dean asked, voice quieter than he’d intended.
Sam huffed out a breath. “Because I miss you and I think it would be great.”
Taking his keys, Dean got out of the Impala and locked her up. Heading over to the sidewalk, he could finally see between the gates. A stony, shingle path laid beyond the massive gates and there beyond it was a hotel that looked like it was designed and built in the 1920’s. Its clean lines and shallow columns with scallop like details molded on, unmistakable on the pale mint green building.
and shook his head. “Some of us have scales and feathers. Like the dinosaurs. And human lore on dragons is, understandably, patchy at best.”
The high ceiling of the dining room was here as well. The room was packed with bookshelves on the floor and along the walls, all the same dark lacquered wood of much of the hotel.
“Already have a viewing for tomorrow afternoon.” And he did. Dean wasn’t stupid, he’d already started looking for somewhere new to rent, heading out to have a look at places several times a week between shifts at the coffee shop and his
, Dean thought ruefully as he loaded up the van with Bobby’s help.
“Cas, are you sure this temperature is fine?”
Dean turned a dial, and a jet of steam wooshed out of the steamer on the espresso machine. He glanced up at Charlie and saw her thoughtfully smile as she considered her answer.
Dean didn’t realize he was doing it, but he placed himself between Charlie and the door out of the library, in case she decided to run like he had.
“You need to let me know immediately at all if this hurts, okay?”
“Is Jack right, did you say something wrong with the spell?” Dean tried.
“I know.”
“Jack? Oh, he had an unfortunate death here… it’s complicated, but for some reason never passed over.”
Dean crossed his arms over his chest. “Trapped, in the east wing.”
“I don’t believe it,” he said after ten minutes of reading. He set the papers down and took a swig of beer. “There’s no way anyone would draw up a lease that is that good for a tenant. No way.”
“Right. Oh, am I allowed people over?”
“Wait, what?” Sam asked as he stopped beside the breakfast bar, beer in hand. It was Thursday evening, burger night, the pans from Dean’s homemade burger and fries ensemble were waiting to be rinsed and loaded into the dishwasher.
“Watch it, you idjit!” Bobby growled from the other end of the mattress he was shifting with Dean as they walked down the path to the sidewalk and the waiting van. Bobby was like a second father to Dean, had been ever since he’d moved to Sioux Falls. He’d been a distant figure to Sam and Dean as they grew up in Lawrence, but he was an old buddy of their father’s and they’d spent many a summer over at Bobby’s after they started to drive their parents mad. It wasn’t like the Winchesters could afford summer camp.
“Nah, it’s fine. Not like we haven’t watched this before.” Sam nervously ran his thumb down the side of his bottle. “But yeah, maybe we should pause.”
Cas turned, opening his eyes as he did. They seemed an even brighter blue in the late morning sunshine, if that were possible. He smiled warmly. “Hello, Dean.”
Cas took a sip of coffee. “May I ask why?”
Dean nodded. “Sure.”
“WHAT IS GOING ON?!” Sam screamed, on the verge of hyperventilating as he backed away to a wall, keeping everyone in view.
“Fine.” Dean sighed. “I’ll text you once I’m done.”
There was no hello or any other greeting, a buzzer sounded and the front door to the apartment opened. Dean headed inside and was greeted by a foyer covered in black and white floor tiles, and walls covered in small versions of what was on the floor. It was a little dizzying. Dean tried to ignore the patterns surrounding him and concentrated on making his way to the stairwell. He headed on up and found himself wondering if he would be able to make it all the way up the stairs after a long night out and with company in tow. Coming up to the third floor, he had to admit that he was glad he wasn’t looking at somewhere on the fifth floor of the building, as he really couldn’t see him making it up to an apartment that far after a good night out. The pristine tiles might end up being less pristine.
“Sure, Cas. Come on in,” Dean said, stepping to the side so that there would be enough room for Cas. He heard the rustling of a towel and then Cas pulled the shower door open and stepped inside.
“Dean,” Cas murmured, “I am fine.” He made no move to pull his hand away from Dean’s.
Dean’s heart started thudding in his chest, and his dick took embarrassingly quick interest. He and Cas had been taking things slow since Halloween, just keeping to heavy make out sessions for the past two weeks, with Cas wanting to make sure they didn’t rush things. Dean had been ready to dive head first into the deep end, but that wasn’t the way with Cas.
Dean went back to the table and waited five minutes, but there was still nothing. He started on his burger and fries, enjoying the herbs in the patty and prayed he didn’t have to reheat Cas’s food, because it definitely wouldn’t taste so good after. Fifteen minutes once he’d started eating, there was still no sign of Cas.
Dean settled on his knees in front of Cas’s feat. “I think she was going to find out something was going on at some point. She’s not stupid.”
“Cas is here on speaker. So, not sure how much you could make out, Cas, but Sammy here wants to use The Ddraig for a huge ass Halloween party.” Dean shifted. “He wants a big party. All our friends. Booze. Food. Costumes. What do you think?”
“What is your kind of thing, then?!” Dean demanded.
“She was wondering if you could bring some of that Nicaraguan blend you guys have at the shop?”
“Bobby Singer. I own an auto shop and salvage yard, on the other side of town.”
Dean thought to himself and scrambled back for his cell, shutting the timer off. He got to his feet.
“It’s spacious,” Dean said. Thursday night, Dean and Cas had agreed to have dinner at the same time and Dean had cooked up spaghetti and meatballs, which Cas had practically made sound like it was sex on a plate. They’d sat at different ends of a large dining table, nearly shouting to each other, but Cas’s response to the food had been obvious enough. They wouldn’t be having dinner together Friday night, as Dean would be heading over to Charlie’s for Dungeons and Dragons, but Cas had promised to cook something for Saturday. Dean had wondered how Cas was going to get ingredients for cooking and had then remembered that Cas seemed pretty adept at doing stuff online.
, he schooled himself.
Dean couldn’t see a lie, so he just remained where he was, because he wanted to be that close to Castiel. “Cas…”
“Thank you.”
“Right? It’s bigger than any apartment I’ve ever seen.” Dean walked over to the windows and looked down at the fountain outside.
During her second cup of strong tea, Charlie agreed that she would help them.
“Yep.”
“You don’t think the giant squid in the moat was too much, right?” Charlie asked as she lounged on a musty old couch that Bobby had set back in his workshop.
Cas was, as far as Dean could tell, a young twenty-something loner, who spent most of his time binging box sets, reading, playing videogames on his PlayStation, chatting online with random people, listening to random ass stuff on Spotify real loud in his room (with soundproofing that only just made it okay) and working at the bookstore on weekends. Conversely, Dean was 40 and normally spent his free time out at Bobby’s garage, fixing up his dad’s old Chevy Impala or hitting the gym at the office. Sometimes he played golf with one of the VPs, but that was only every so often. Like once a month.
“What will you say?”
But not once had Cas asked to shower with Dean and suddenly here he was, wanting to.
“He could see how much Cas cared about you,” Mary reassured. “You know that’s all we’ve ever wanted for you, right? For you to find the right someone for you. And if Cas is that someone, then he’s a very nice someone.” Smiling, Mary leaned over and kissed Dean on the cheek and stood back. “Now, how about we finish this house, hm?”
“Uh-huh. Not far from here. Apartment. Quite new. Comes furnished. I’m hoping it’s the one, considering Sam’s kicking me out.”
“Why didn’t you just get yourself new tools?” Sam frowned eyes focused entirely on Dean, making him feel like he was strapped to a chair, glaring light beaming down on him.
“Don’t worry about heading off as normal,” Aaron said as he finished tying his apron. “Ron has said he’ll come in to work with me. He doesn’t have any classes this afternoon.”
Before Dean could reply and remind him of the tea, Cas’s bedroom door closed and Dean was by himself. Sighing again, he stepped over to the kitchen, finishing his coffee as he reached the counter and set the coffee mug in the sink. Washing his hands again, Dean set about getting what he needed to make burgers.
“Sam, it’s good to meet you,” Cas said, holding a hand out.
“Dean, Cas, Jack?” Sam called out.
Sam stared at him with big, worried eyes. “Something could go wrong?”
“John seems to like Cas,” Mary said apropos of nothing.
“And you’ve read all of them?” Dean asked in awe, placing his beer on the table.
Dean considered, but the memory of Cas’s shadow was clear in his thoughts. The way his neck had stretched out and those wings!
“Oh…” Charlie looked back to Cas. “I, uh…”
Cas set the tray down on a trivet and Dean grabbed Cas’s left wrist, pulling his hand towards him. He was expecting the worst, but instead, as he looked Cas’s hand all over and stroked his fingers down Cas’s palm, Dean found no welts or blisters. There was nothing to show that Cas had just taken something from a very hot oven and held it with his bare hand.
