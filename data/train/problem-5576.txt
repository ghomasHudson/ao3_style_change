"Uhh, yeah," Peter stammered, his heart in his throat. "I'm—I was just looking… for the bathroom, and… yeah, I guess I got a bit lost."
Tony sighed as he studied his boyfriend, his beautiful blue eyes glassy and the fading sunlight bouncing off the lighter blond strands in his hair. He was just so unbelievably beautiful that Tony still didn't quite understand what he saw in him, someone who not only was almost the exact opposite in looks, but also a civilian. With the forbidden last name of Stark.
"Well, Fury is one of the best spies that ever spied, so if anyone can do it, he can," Tony said. "So it should only be a matter of time." He didn't add that ever since the whole Project Insight fiasco, Fury's name didn't really carry the same kind of weight and recognition that it had before, and that he might not actually be able to completely rid the world's databases of all traces tying James Buchanan Barnes to the legendary assassin known as the Winter Soldier. No sense in taking the wind out of Peter's sails unless it was absolutely necessary.
Peter chose to let that one slide. "Dad, we just spent weeks trying to figure out how these silly particles work on the off chance that they might turn out to be helpful whenever what you keep dreaming about is gonna happen, happens. And that's fine, you know it is. You know I love doing stuff like this with you, so it's fine. But what's not fine is this thing you've got going on where you feel like you have to carry all of this crap by yourself. This is exactly how you were after Loki and the Chitauri came, Dad, I remember it. You were obsessed with making your suits, and obsessed with protecting us, and—"
Silently, Steve poked his head around Peter's slightly open door, letting out a small sigh of relief when he saw that yes, Peter did appear to be sleeping peacefully, hugging his polar bear as usual with his favourite white noise rain sounds playing in the background. He tiptoed inside the room, reaching down to brush Peter's curls off his forehand, his heart leaping when Peter instinctively leaned into his touch. The boy had grown at least eight centimetres over the summer and his jawline had sharpened up a bit, but he still had the same round cheeks and full lips that he'd always had, so he wasn't done growing quite yet.
How on Earth was a guy who was so obviously gorgeous and seemingly great with kids—or at least, book-loving, awkward young teenagers—still single?
"But… the ship was all busted up. Quill even said so," he said to Dr Strange. "And since you didn't use any of your sparkly circle thingies, then how—?"
"It'd just be for the summer, Peter," Gwen repeated. "The internship is for ten weeks, then a couple of days on either end."
Taking a quick glance around the bus, Peter noted that all of the other students seemed to be engrossed in whatever they were doing and hadn't yet noticed the spaceship. Since he'd worn one of his Spider-Man suits under his clothes in anticipation of the museum being freezing—what was it about museums and their overactive air conditioners anyway?—all he would need to do is create some kind of distraction inside the bus and he should be able to slip away unnoticed.
But it was only about three seconds later when Peter felt the ice bolt race down his back again, just before an ear-splitting noise caused him to whip around. Peter stumbled as what could only be described as some kind of huge, flying metal demon swooped down from the sky and latched onto him with its claws, carrying him off in the direction of the frozen lake.
Peter blinked. That Saturday just happened to be the day before Valentine's Day, which meant he should probably get her some flowers or something as well. "Uhh, sure! Yeah, um… that's—that sounds great! Um—"
Retaking his place between his dads, Peter quickly began to fidget, wondering when the actual battle was going to happen. The team had been fighting before the portals appeared, that much was certain. But ever since they opened and everyone came through, it was like someone had pressed the Pause button or something.
Tony gulped as he checked the monitor. Bucky's heart rate and blood pressure were elevated but not dangerously so, and everything with the interface looked good.
Reaching for his cup of coffee on the bedside table, Steve caught a glimpse of himself in the small mirror, his brow furrowing with disgust at his unkempt appearance. His hair was the longest it had been in decades, since he was a boy, and the circles under his eyes were so dark that he looked like he'd been hit in the face multiple times by his own shield.
Steve let out a soft chuckle. "Yeah. I… uh… I have pretty good ears." He tucked Tony close, laying them both back down onto the pillows. "Did my alarm clock startle you? I'm sorry if it did."
"Ten, nine, eight, seven—" Steve started, his next word lodging in his throat as another Meridian aircraft suddenly appeared about a hundred and fifty metres directly in front of him, his eyes going wide as he took it in.
“Quiet, please,” calls the announcer.  A few seconds later, the cheers of the crowd fall silent, until all Steve can hear is the slight whoosh of the water as it washes over the tops of the gutters, and the thudding of his own heart.
“Uh huh.  I’m fine,” Peter said firmly.  If Papa was brave enough to go on, then Peter was going to be right there with him.  He checked the monitor, relieved to see that Papa’s vitals were doing okay.  “Everything looks good from here, so…”
"Colonel Rhodes," Tony explained. "We've known each other for years. He was my roommate at university."
"Steve?" Tony said over the comm, followed immediately by a repulsor blast aimed at the water monster's head. "Babe, is he breathing?"
And he'd be packing Tony and Peter off to Asgard, instead of sitting on their bed trying to stop shaking.
"And it's not like I need reminding about how awful Thanos is," stated Tony. "Not when he's been inside my head ever since the Battle of New York! But, on that note, the ship has already self-corrected its course from the hull breach, which must mean it's on autopilot."
Peter sniggered as he shook his head. "No, the book doesn't say. It does say that the so-called 'treatment' was never very successful though."
"No, we know that, little guy," Steve said thickly. His heart was beating a bit faster than usual too, Tony could tell. "It's just… something that Dad and I aren't quite used to yet."
Steve let out a heavy sigh, tipping his head back against the tub. "I hate that it's come to this. How can we have any semblance of a normal life if we're to the point where we need reconnaissance over our own home? Peter deserves better than this, Tony. We all do."
Tony shuddered, squeezing Steve's hand as he tried to not think about a tiny and sickly baby Steve trying to survive on the tough streets of Langara.
There were several other subject numbers mentioned in the file, all listed with various matter-manipulating abilities and all who were then terminated for various reasons, including Subject 141 who had demonstrated the ability to control fire, but who also ended up failing to capture Peter Stark-Rogers.
They took a three day break after that trip at Tony's suggestion, allowing Steve some time to rest and recoup—and punch a few punching bags into oblivion, with Tony's permission—while Tony tinkered around some more with the compass, using the data they had already collected to try and further narrow their area of focus.
It wasn't that Peter minded Grandpa's visits all that much. He had been correct when he'd told Dad that Grandpa really didn't have anything else to do. When he wasn't with Peter at the hospital he was either at their house—with only his whisky for company—or out wandering around in the streets, and out of those three choices Peter far preferred him being at the hospital. At least then he knew for sure that he was still alive.
"Captain Rogers," the man said, standing in front of the sparkling circle as if it were something completely normal. "I need you to come with me right now."
“Pardon me, Captain, but I am not currently interested in joining a conversation regarding your petty human linguistics!” Thor shouts in between massive swings of his hammer.  “Perhaps once we have retrieved the Tesseract?”
"All right, bud, I think we're ready to give this a go," Dad said as he tapped some final commands into his keyboard. "Everything look good over there?"
"Dad, he was pretty upset, and…" Peter shook his head, swallowing a cough. "He said something about it being the anniversary of when he was released from prison or something, but… he was slurring his words so bad that I couldn't understand most of what he was saying, and… I still can't believe he'd managed to walk all the way here, he was shaking pretty bad too."
“No, they're not,” Natasha says firmly.  She takes another sip of her tea, tilting her head as she swallows.  “But… now that I think about it, the new guy in the equipment room might be more your type anyway.  I’ll see if I can find out his name for you.”
“Thanks for getting off early today, Dad,” Peter says once they're on their way.  “I really appreciate it.”
But there was nothing there. There was nothing except the crackle of the fires behind him, and the shattering of his own heart.
And seeing both it and Anthony listed amongst other people who were supposed to be patriots was even more difficult. Howard Stark had turned out to be nothing more than a traitor, and Steve still couldn't understand how he had managed to be acquitted after his massive and hugely expensive trial.
"Dad!" Peter exclaimed as he bolted upright, his face flushing hot. "We don't—she doesn't, I mean, her entire family was there!"
"I'm here, sweetheart," he said, much stronger than he'd sounded before. "JARVIS is starting my approach now."
"Yeah, kinda like a back door that only certain people would know about," Peter said. "You told me that Dad said they undercovered a database that had all sorts of Langaran stuff in it, right?"
Peter's tongue poked out to wet his chapped lips. "Yeah. That sounds like loads of fun. Can't wait."
Steve was quiet for a moment, his mind swirling with the possible ramifications of Tony's theory. "And so you think they could eventually use these attacks as an excuse to come after us?"
As he swung closer to the ship, which was hovering over a street littered with destroyed cars and small fires, the HUD in Peter's mask started to focus in on what appeared to be two aliens facing off against both of Peter's dads and three other men, two of which were holding something that looked like glowing golden shields in their hands.
The woman's glare intensified, her fists clenched at her sides. "I've been in places a lot more secure than this one," she said, jerking her head towards the pager. "Why do you have that? Where's Fury?"
Peter frowned, only adding to his adorably disheveled look. He had needed a haircut since before they had left for Wakanda, and now, almost three weeks later, his curls were pretty much out of control.
Disbelieving, Peter read the section again. And again. And again, his mouth completely dry by the time he'd finished the third reread. His entire body was shaking, his hands clenched into such tight fists that his fingernails had broken through his skin.
And the fact that they were holding the vote at four in the morning only added more fuel to Steve's suspicions.
"What'd you find?" Tony said tersely as he came up next to Steve, relaxing only slightly when Steve silently took his hand.
"I know, sweetheart, but we owe it to him to help him get through this." A knot the size of a marble rose in Steve's throat, his own eyes burning with unshed tears. "We have to see it through, Tony, we have to!"
Slowly, Tony turned his head, gulping against the marble-sized knot in his throat as he studied the girl's androidish face. She wasn't crying—perhaps she was unable to cry—but her shoulders were sagged and her eyes half-lidded, like she was also grieving.
"Okay, okay, bad example," muttered Tony. He pressed his lips to Steve's forehead, the heat radiating from his sweaty skin almost scorching. "Look. Killian and Stane came after us because they both had a personal vendetta against me—"
"Danvers!" James exclaimed, snapping his fingers. "I knew there was a reason why your name sounded so familiar." He turned to Steve. "She was reported missing in the late eighties, some kind of crash that was classified way above my pay grade at the time. Real hush-hush stuff."
"Yeah, and how many goddamn drinks did you have before you hooked it up, huh?" asked Tony. "Well? How many?"
"George, is this really necessary for dinnertime conversation?" Mrs Stacy cut in. "We're here to get to know Peter, not to pester him questions about his parents that he probably doesn't even know the answers to."
Tony shoots him a frown.  “Really?  You're still going on about that when you're sitting there bleeding all over yourself?”
"No, I did not," Steve said firmly. He didn't add that it was he who had asked Shuri to keep Tony for an extra day or so, just to be triply sure that he was all right. "Now, please try and rest some more, okay?"
And then he'd proceeded to lie awake for over half the night, kicking himself for not inviting Tony to spend the night with him.
Since the aircraft were arranged in three groups of two Steve and Carol were the first to roll out onto the runway. As soon as they had both cleared the hangar Steve eased back, allowing Carol to go in front of him.
"Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change, Stark, no matter the circumstances," said Dr Strange.
"Well, I think that went as well as we could've hoped," Steve said as they exited the restaurant. He was still plenty nervous, but the steadfast support of his teammates along with having a solid plan in place had worked to alleviate at least some of his concerns.
If what they were potentially facing was as bad as Thor feared, then the entire team needed to be at its absolute best at all times. And that meant making sure that Tony slept more than a few hours every three days.
Tony thought as the sharp staccato sound of machine gun fire burst from the speaker. Apparently the Meridian pilots were being a bit testy today, which Major Lorne had already attributed to them being jealous of the Langarans' new toys.
His kid probably attends some snobby elite prep school too.  Growing up in Brooklyn, Steve came across plenty of kids with parents like that.  And he can just see one of those parents hunting him down simply because he’s a semi-recognisable name.
"Mmm, if you say so." Peter bit down on his bottom lip, glancing between Tony and Steve. "But how am I ever gonna be a hero like you guys if I can't keep from getting hurt every single time?" he asked, nearly tearing Tony's heart down the middle.
"Render is complete, sir," JARVIS said. "Would you like me to begin with the unit assembly, or run the diagnostic first?"
It wasn't fair. But at the moment, he didn't really care. If his guilt meant getting his husband and son back, then it would be more than worth it.
"I believe Master Peter has come to the realisation that it is no longer worth asking detailed questions regarding your missions, Captain," JARVIS said. "Since such questions only serve to frustrate him when he is denied answers."
“Yeah, sure, you do now,” Tony says worriedly.  “But how ‘bout when I mess your leg up even worse, and we’re still stuck down here?  Then what?”
Steve's heart lurched, ashamed of his selfishness. Just because Tony had more experience than he did with addressing senatorial committees didn't mean that he didn't dread it. "I'm sorry, sweetheart, I didn't mean to snap at you. Can you tell me now, though? Please?"
Steve glanced over at Tony, raising an eyebrow. He loved the fact that his teammates wanted to be there with them to offer their moral support, but only if Tony was comfortable with it.
"That must've been at the theatre," Peter mumbled, his heart thudding madly. He shivered, burrowing down even further into his blankets as he kept reading, trying to figure out why in the hell HYDRA was sending all these semi-enhanced people specifically after him.
“Yeah, yeah, okay, I get ya,” Obie said, backing towards the door.  “Don't bother the artist while he’s creating and all that.  Howard was the same way, so I’ll leave ya alone…”
"It's okay, buddy. I've got you," Dad said, over and over. "It's all over now. Oh God, Pete, I thought I was gonna lose you!"
“Sweetheart, it can wait till the morning, can’t it?” Steve murmured as he pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s forehead.  “It’s almost midnight.”
"So we just have to figure out where our timeline branched off, and then go back to just before that specific point," finished Steve. He shot Tony a quick smile. "Isn't that right?"
"Nothing much," Peter said with a shrug. "But apparently his mom found out that we're gonna have a new student starting in our class who's supposedly smarter than me."
"And you know that I'm not gonna do anything to hurt you," Steve gently retorted. He settled between Tony's legs, hiking Tony's knees up to his chest. "And the next time we do this," he said as he slicked up his fingers. "I'm gonna use my tongue as well."
Because Steve Rogers, aka Captain America himself, had somehow seen it fit to fall in love with Tony, a sentiment he had shared only a few months after Tony’s fateful flight through Loki’s portal, carrying the missile intended to wipe out the citizens of Manhattan during the Battle of New York.  After releasing that missile straight into the aliens’ mothership, Tony had fallen unconscious as he’d plummeted back to Earth, finally coming to in the middle of a debris-filled street.
And then there's the reality that despite his extensive background in swimming and his study of all of the best training techniques, and his experience with said techniques, Steve has never mentioned the possibility of becoming a swim coach.  He’s never talked about it, not with his friends and teammates, not in interviews.  He’s never even mentioned it in passing where it might’ve been overheard somewhere.
"Honey, your appointment with the surgeon's office is in a week," Tony said, just a hair shy of patronising. "That's a total of ten days with the cast, where most people would have it on for a minimum of three months, probably more. I know it's gotta be hard, but you've just got to be patient or else you'll just end up setting yourself back again." Tony let out a short chuckle. "Listen to me, I'm starting to sound like Sam."
Fury sighed, shifting on his fancy desk chair.  “Look, Tony, I know you won’t believe me when I say that we’re doing all that we can to locate Captain Rogers, but—”
"Ah, yep," Peter said with a nod. "See ya." He watched as Gwen walked over to the police car, giving Chief Stacy an awkward wave as they drove away.
"Yeah, but that's not really the point right now," said Steve. "I messed up, Buck, and Tony—he was really, really mad, and—"
Peter heard Papa give a sigh, and he opened one eye just enough to see the deep frown marring Papa's face.
Tony tilted his head, frowning. "Pete, there's only about a zillion different alien movies that you love, so pardon me if I'm not quite sure which one it is you're talking about?"
As soon as the Stacys were gone, Tony sank down onto the chair at his workstation, scrubbing a rough hand down his face. This was not at all how he had expected the evening to go.
"C'mon, babe," he added, pressing another kiss to Steve's forehead. "Let's just try and go to sleep, yeah? Nothing we can do about anything now."
He technically can’t forget anything, but it would still be nice to pretend.  Even if it’s only for an hour or so a day.
"Which tend to vary based on the quality of the pop culture references you can recite during a battle," added Tony. He pushed himself back from the table and got to his feet, placing his hand on Steve's shoulder. "So, tomorrow, then? Say… after breakfast?"
"Because Thanos knew you would do whatever it took to protect your planet," said Gamora. "I believe you would call it, killing two winged creatures with one chunk of fossilised soil."
"All right, sweetheart," Steve said as he slowly eased the throttle forward. "Let's see what you got."
Tony let out a chuckle from the driver's seat of their speedboat, shaking his head as he watched Peter's fumbling attempts to reattach the waterski to his left foot while still bobbing up and down in the lake about five metres from their dock. He and Steve had been skiing double for most of the afternoon, and Steve was now attempting to teach him how to drop a ski.
"Nope, it's two!" Sam called as he swooped in, aiming his legs like a battering ram just as another HYDRA soldier emerged from a broken-down car, an unlocked grenade still clutched in his gloved hand. Sam sent the soldier flying across the street and into another parked car as Steve raced towards the bouncing grenade, slamming his shield down on top of it just in time to contain the explosion.
“Yeah,” Tony forced out.  Then he raised his shaking right hand and knocked three times on Obie’s door.
Peter shrugged, his face flushing hot. He should've never told Papa about what Wanda had made him see.
“Uh huh,” says Peter.  He grimaces as he pulls himself out of the pool, flopping down onto the deck in such dramatic fashion that Tony bursts out laughing.
And, now there were two other people out there like Peter. A pair of siblings who had been found to be genetically enhanced from birth, and so far the only people to have survived Doctor List's experiments.
It took him a few more seconds to realise that none of the others had bothered to leave any credits behind for their drinks, something that brought a slight smile to Steve's face as he dug into his back pocket, peeling off the required number of bills and laying them on the table. He'd get them all back the next time.
Tony rushed out as about a thousand different emotions began warring inside his mind and body, leaving him so nauseous and dizzy that for a moment he felt as though he might actually pass out. With shaking hands he dropped the sketchbook onto the bed like a hot potato, his legs nearly tangling in the sheets in his frantic attempt to get to his feet.
With a heavy sigh, Tony grabbed the clothes Rhodey had left for him, shoving the standard-issue black cadet t-shirt over his head and pulling on the army-green pants, once again wrinkling his nose at the drabness of the colours.
"Copy that!" Natasha said as she and Wanda took off running towards the huge machine, followed by General Okoye. Ducking underneath a leaping war dog, Steve's heart fluttered as Wanda suddenly levitated into the air, bright red peals of light emanating from her hands.
Knowing HYDRA, they had been planning on nabbing Steve for a long, long time, and so would likely keep him hidden somewhere that wasn't already documented.
"Is there something we can do for you, Agent?" Steve asked in his Captain's voice, his hand covering Tony's on his arm. Tony could tell he was fighting the urge to step in front of him, which meant that his hackles were already up, which usually meant that something very
Grief that Steve was still attempting to push aside, choosing to focus only on Tony at the moment. They could mourn Peter together once he was back on his feet.
"All your fault," Steve breathed into Tony's neck. He hefted Tony into his arms, carrying him over to the couch in the corner of the lab and settling him on his lap. "This wasn't why I came in here, you know, ach tá tú dodhéanta seasamh in aghaidh."
"Oh yeah, like you've never faced the wrath of O'Brien before!" protested Chester. "I seem to recall a very distinct failure on your part to properly recite the Langaran Air Corps Code of Conduct when you first joined up. You're pretty damn lucky that the Colonel didn't boot you out right then and there!"
Which likely meant that the Soul Stone was still hidden deep underneath the Wakandan plain. And without all six of the stones, then…
There was a pause for a couple minutes while they both picked at their food, until Gwen spoke up again. "So, I found out some more stuff about Liz's dad, if you're interested."
Not when Tony was more personable and charming in their brief, hour-long interaction than Brock ever was during the entirety of their three-plus-year-long relationship.  And seemed like an excellent father to boot.
"Well, we wouldn't want the hotshot Captain to lose his focus now, would we," Tony said with a wink, even as he cupped Steve's cheek in his hand and kissed him again, forgetting all about the fact that he hadn't brushed his teeth or anything and probably had morning breath from hell. But Steve didn't seem to mind—or was just too polite to say anything—as he wound his arms around Tony and rolled so he was on top of him.
Papa locked eyes with Dad over Peter's head, quirking his eyebrow, with Dad's shoulders sagging in response.
For at least thirty minutes, Tony just stood there while Obie continued his diatribe, ranting and raving that Tony’s “shameful dalliance” was going to bring such a crushing wave of bad publicity to the company that it may never recover.
“Really?” Peter says warily.  “You're really gonna not answer my question ‘cause you’re too afraid to answer my question?”
And once the surgery was over, and Peter had given Steve a complete play-by-play of his Decathlon competition while his cheekbone and ribs were put back into their proper places and his left foot was rebuilt using pins and plates and screws and placed inside the largest cast Tony had ever seen, and once Helen was satisfied with Steve's level of pain control and Tony had made his follow-up appointment with the surgeon's office in New York, the entire team boarded the Stark Industries jet and headed home, flanked by two Air Force F-22s.
"Hey," Steve asked as they stepped into their gorgeous lofted bedroom, with the floor-to-ceiling windows offering a perfect view of the moonlight shining through the nearby trees. "Are you okay?"
"Very well. Then I am estimating it would take one week's time to complete the upgrade on all units, if in fact it is your desire to not deactivate them while they are being upgraded."
"New Avengers' facility? That must've meant the Compound!" Peter exclaimed, clapping his hand over his mouth a second later. He had already deactivated JARVIS for the night, not wanting to be bugged every three minutes about why he was still awake, but the last thing he wanted was to possibly wake up Papa, who Peter knew had not been sleeping well lately.
"Yeah. He's been my best friend for my entire life," Steve said. "He's the one who pushed me to ask you out."
"Yes, Captain," answered JARVIS. "Master Peter is currently sleeping peacefully, with all vital signs within his normal parameters."
Nor was he prepared to give in to his panic now.  He was Captain America, for heaven’s sake.  Not some frightened plebe soldier out on his very first mission.
As soon as Ms Sharon left the room Peter sniffed, swiping the tears from his eyes. It wouldn't do any good for Dad to hear that he was upset.
"Yes, and because of that, HYDRA took him and tried to convert him into one of their Winter Soldiers!"
"I mean, have you seen those arms of his?" Betty said. "Especially when he swings his hammer and the lightning comes out? I mean, they're like,
"But I don't want to be leaning on you," Steve added. "You've got all those bruises all over your back and I'm not gonna be making 'em worse by pressing on 'em."
I'm Spider-Man, damnit! I can do amazing things that no one else can do, and I could prove it to them if they'd only let me!"
In fact, they ended up getting there so fast that the SHIELD medics hadn't even finished resetting Gwen's separated shoulder by the time they arrived at the infirmary. Gwen had burst into tears as soon as she saw them, insisting over and over that Peter had risked his own life to protect her and that she probably would've been killed from her fall off the building if he hadn't managed to catch her with his web, one that he had launched at her right before he lost consciousness. Sam had found her dangling by one arm off the side of the building less than a minute after the second impact, quickly whisking her away to the infirmary while Bucky shimmied up onto the roof to look for Peter.
Peter shrugged, rubbing at his nose. "Well, yeah, but… nevermind. How was your day? Did you have another patrol today?"
They found Scott Lang lying on the padded bench in his cell, his hands folded behind his head as he contemplated the ceiling. As soon as he noticed Steve he shot to his feet, nearly tipping over in his haste to salute him.
"Yes, well, good day, Captain," Stacy said with a nod. Steve got the impression that he had more to say, but he had neither the patience nor the time to listen to him at the moment.
"He has a theory regarding the purpose behind the initial attack on Wakanda," answered Steve. "And if he's right, then we'll need to make that our main focus for the time being."
"Oh no," Steve choked out as he slumped back into his chair. "So it seems that Thor was right then? About the sceptre being one of those… infinity gems?"
"His vital signs are within his normal parameters, sir, aside from one small body temp dip down to thirty-two degrees while waiting for Captain Rogers and Mr Thor to arrive."
Because the war between Langara and Meridia had been waging for decades, longer than he'd even been alive, and for Tony to propose a program that would not only force the military to give up its super-secret potential weapon of mass destruction, but then take that weapon and offer it to the citizens of Meridia as well, Langara's sworn enemy…
"Ehh, actually I'm thinking it might be better for either Tony or myself to go in first," Bruce said. "That way if we sense an issue once we're inside we can make on-the-fly changes to the GPS."
“Yeah,” says Steve.  He read a few articles that referenced the same thing, including a couple that mentioned that Howard and Tony had a bad falling out regarding that weapons business that led to Tony moving out to New York.
"Okay, okay," Steve said, far too calmly for Tony's taste. "But sweetheart, it's only three thirty in the morning, and I'm sure that Peter's asleep, so—"
"Oh, I usually wind up going through at least five backpacks by the end of the year," Peter said quickly, fighting the urge to cringe a split-second later. "I mean—I sometimes forget where they are, or I—"
Peter bit down on his bottom lip. "Yeah, that sounds like him. He hates going to the doctor for anything, hates being fussed over, like he says. But are you sure he won't get worse? Dad doesn't get sick very often, he hasn't since I was little. But when he does, it tends to be pretty bad."
"It's gonna be okay, little guy. I've got you," Steve whispered as he pressed another kiss to Peter's hand, cradling it against his cheek for a moment before carefully replacing it under his blankets. Then he leaned back in his chair, raising his arms up over his head to try and alleviate some of the ever-present tightness in his neck and shoulders. Dr Cho had offered him a sleep aid as well, but he had refused, thinking it probably wouldn't work on him anyway. And while he was tired—more like exhausted, actually—he also knew there'd be no way he would be able to sleep.
“But, Daddy,” Peter said, his small, quivering voice tearing off tiny shards of Steve’s heart.  “Daddy, it’s not—it’s not that bad.  It doesn’t even hurt that much, and—Steve, he couldn't help it—he didn't mean to!”
“Yes, I am,” Steve said softly as he held out his arm to Tony, warmth spreading across his chest when Tony took it.
"Oh, they are still coming, Sir Buchanan," Thor said as an entire squadron of Chitauri took off towards them. With a rather evil grin, he raised his axe, summoning a series of lightning bolts that he brought directly down on their heads, knocking them flat.
"Oh, yeah!" Peter said, squinting to get a better look. Whatever it was was orange, moving quickly through the emptiness of space as it left a sort of fiery trail behind it. "It kinda looks like a comet? Are there supposed to be any of those coming through this area now?"
"But—" Tony sputtered, huffing out a frustrated breath. "Honey, I just… I gotta make sure that nothing can jeopardise Pete's chances of getting his surgery. He's—he's almost at the end of his rope, and because of that there's just a lot of pieces that need to fall into place, and—"
"Yeah, Papa, I promise I got everything," Peter answered, suppressing an eyeroll. Papa always hovered a lot more than Peter thought was necessary whenever Dad wasn't with them, as if he assumed he needed to make up for Dad's absence. Dad had received an emergency phone call from the Department of Damage Control about five minutes before they were supposed to leave, something about a possible security breach with one of the trucks in D.C. transporting artefacts left over from the Triskelion, if Peter had overheard correctly. Lately anything involving D.C. was enough to make both Papa and Dad extra twitchy, especially since the presidential election was only a couple months away.
A thought suddenly crashed into Peter's head like an out-of-control aircraft, causing him to gasp so hard that he started coughing again.
"Mmm," Tony said as he dragged his tongue down Steve's sternum, dipping it into his navel as he worked his pants down his legs. Steve tried to keep his eyes open, tried to watch as Tony pressed feather-light kisses all along the length of his cock, but he just couldn't. It had been too long, and Tony's warm, wet mouth just felt too damn good as it closed over his length that Steve's head fell back against the headboard, his hands fisting hard into the sheets as Tony practically swallowed him down.
"Well, I suppose that's not all bad," Gwen whispered back. "She's probably tougher than the judges will be at the actual competition, so if you think about it, our team should be a shoo-in."
"Uh huh," Peter said as he shuffled out of the room, with Tony's shoulders sagging once he was out of sight. He should've known Peter would ask him something like that, and he honestly couldn't blame him. He couldn't imagine what it must be like, knowing that someone had wrapped a noose around your subconscious and could tighten it at whim.
suddenly filled the lab, the adjacent building exploding like it had been embedded with C-4.  “Oh God, Bucky!”
Tony gave a nod as he turned on his heel, resuming his pacing. "Yeah, yeah, that's good. Just… why don't you tell all three of 'em to come up here when they get home, yeah? That'll save Steve the trouble of having to just repeat it all later. Oh, and get Barton and Romanoff on the line too."
"Seems like about half," James said, tossing Steve a grim look. "Is that what that lunatic said he was gonna do with the stones? Wipe out half of humanity?"
down out of the sky during their battle, Tony wasn't shocked to see that the ship had been hit in the fallout.
He drew in a deep, slow breath, smelling the salt in the air from the Mediterranean Sea just a few metres away and feeling his limbs grow heavy with it, almost sinking into the plush cushions of the lounge chair. He could hear Thor somewhere a bit further down the beach, no doubt telling Bruce and Clint yet another one of his grand tales of victorious Asgardian battles, while Tony and James discussed the latest upgrade Tony had made to James's War Machine armour, one that Peter had helped design. Peter had gone into town a couple hours ago with Bucky, Nat, and Sam to shop for souvenirs to bring home, which Steve assumed also would include a nice gift for his lady friend.
Normally that sight would've been bad enough on its own, but Peter knew from Uncle Bucky’s stories that that wasn’t even the half of it.  Because lying beneath those bandages and evidenced by the sickening greenish-black colour of his fingertips, Uncle Bucky’s arm was dying a slow, painful death.
A theory made even stronger when his name is announced as the defending Olympic champion, and it takes him at least three heartbeats to smile as he waves to the crowd.  A smile that Tony notices doesn’t quite seem to reach his eyes.
what if Peter—what if he never—if he never came into the store that one day?  I mean, what if he hadn’t—
"Well, then you should fit right in, right, Pete?" Tony said. "Maybe the two of you and the twins can build a functioning food replicator while we're down here."
"Well, there's not really much else to do here," Peter said, barely stifling another cough. "But I promise I'll try."
But even despite the outward lack of evidence, Steve had already been contacted by both Nick Fury and Pepper Potts, warning him that the team would have to hold a press conference once they returned home, if for no other reason than to simply reassure the public that the Avengers had eliminated the threat and that they were all still alive. To that end, Natasha, Clint, and the twins had already returned to the Compound so the twins could finish out their senior year of high school, and Bruce had left for the Tower just the day before, after taking a couple of days to de-Hulk with Thor's help.
It took almost three hours for the doctors to clear all the burnt remnants of Steve's gloves and boots from his damaged skin, soaking and re-soaking his hands and feet in a solution that smelled remarkably like oranges, for some strange reason. Steve had experienced minor burns in the past, while cooking or when he'd stayed outside in the sun for a bit too long, but they hadn't been anything like this. While the doctors worked it was all he could do to keep from whimpering, biting his bottom lip so hard that Tony had to work it loose from his teeth multiple times, warning him that he was going to draw blood if he didn't let go. Fluids and pain medicine flowed into two separate intravenous lines in his arms, but since the medical staff didn't quite understand Steve's increased metabolic requirements the medicine barely was able to take the edge off the pain, prompting Tony at one point to demand that the doctors increase his dosage.
The medic's eyebrows shot up as he swabbed Peter's arm with an alcohol pad while the second medic prepped an IV kit. Tony immediately reached for his son's hand; Peter absolutely
“Tony,” he said, almost a whisper.  “What we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.  You know that, right?”
“No!” Steve said firmly, shaking the thought free before it had a chance to take root and flourish.  That whole line of thinking wasn’t even his to begin with, so he’d never subscribed to anyway.  He didn't need to worry about “channelling his feelings” onto something else because he could control them just fine on his own.
"Nah, Danvers, Stevie knows that," piped up Bucky from his seat behind Steve. "It's just been so long since he's tried to court anyone that he doesn't remember how."
“Copy that.”  Thor’s arm tightens around Tony as they both begin to inch back up, with Steve keeping his hand on Tony for as long as he possibly can.
"Then it's a good thing I like to see you wearing my clothes," he murmured. He planted an open-mouthed kiss right at Tony's navel, briefly dipping his tongue inside. "Tell me what you want, mo grá. Ba mhaith liom tú a shásamh."
"Steve, Clint's getting the jet ready," she said, her usual slightly raspy voice even lower and raspier than usual.
“Oh, you know I love to do it, my dear Anthony,” she says.  “But only until you find a wife, hmm?  Or a husband, you know that’s okay too.  Because a sweet, gorgeous man like yourself deserves to find someone to love him.  Don't you agree, my sweet Peter?”
But even besides that, Tony then had to listen as Ms Roberts tearfully explained that the Stark Relief Foundation group in Sokovia had been attacked during the night, killing three of the aid workers and wounding over a dozen other people, including several injured civilians they had been treating from yet another targeted apartment building the day before.  Tony had immediately offered to send whatever they needed to help, and was in the middle of setting aside funds for transportation and funeral arrangements for the dead workers when Obie called him into his office.
"No," Steve said. He attempted a smile, one that he knew Sam could see right through. "Just…" He trailed off, unable to finish his sentence.
Tony impatiently tapped his fingers on the counter as JARVIS ran the simulation, his heart fluttering as a blurred and grainy image suddenly appeared on his monitor. He instinctively squinted, trying to bring the image into better focus, which only made it worse.
"Well, maybe to you it's not," said Gwen. "But for the rest of us the mere mortals, listening during class has been shown to be a remarkable way to actually learn stuff."
"Then you must understand, Your Highness, that your country may in fact be in grave danger," Thor said.
There really was no way for Steve to know, and since he wasn't able to make in-tunnel adjustments to his compass, there was no way he could attempt to go back a bit further to see exactly what had happened.
"Look at me, Tony," Steve said as he lined himself up and slowly pushed inside him. "Look at me while I take you."
"I won't," Steve said firmly. He caught Tony's hands, pressing both palms against his heaving chest, over his heart. "I won't, Tony, I promise. I love you so much, there's nothing I'm going to do to jeopardise it."
Reaching for the bottle of water he kept under the counter, Steve quickly downed about half of it, drawing in a slow deep breath through his nose once he’d swallowed.  He needed to get himself calmed down if he was going to be able to make it through till closing time.
"Nor will it be for awhile yet, little guy," Steve said sternly. His expression softened as he ruffled Peter's downy soft curls. "Did you remember to brush your teeth?"
The elevator doors had barely closed behind Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam when JARVIS announced that Dad was waiting to talk to him. Peter practically raced to his room, skidding to a stop in front of his viewscreen as Dad's tired face appeared. He was standing inside Uncle Thor's ship, which, Peter immediately noticed, so closely resembled the bridge of a Klingon Bird of Prey that there was no possible way it was a coincidence.
"A teenager is still a child, little guy," said Steve. "Even one that has his own car." He clapped his hand on Peter's shoulder, guiding him into the house while Tony gathered up their various blankets and cocoa mugs, depositing them in their appropriate places.
"Just try and relax, honey," he murmured as he pressed open-mouthed kisses all along Steve's length before finally taking as much of him as he could into his mouth. Steve let out another guttural puff of air as he started to move, his fingers weaving into Tony's hair to massage his scalp. It'd been over a decade since Tony had given someone a blowjob, and his jaw seemed to have lost all of its muscle memory, but from the way Steve was gasping and panting above him he didn't seem to care.
"Peter!" Papa cried as he grabbed hold of Dad's leg at the last second, preventing him from crashing into Uncle Bruce. "Peter, what're you doing here? You need to get back to the Tower!"
Papa had been having enough trouble sleeping for all three of them lately, and Dad didn't need to add Peter's nightmares on top of everything else that he was worried about.
"So, George Stacy told me that he won't be able to make it to the Mets game this coming Thursday," Sam said as he and Steve jogged to a stop outside of the Tower's main entrance. "Something about a school performance for one of his boys, so Bucky and I will have an extra ticket if you wanna come."
"What I believe you are trying to decipher, Thor Odinson, is whether or not Wakanda is the resting place of the gem you would call the Soul Stone," he finally said. "Is that correct?"
"Which means that you and I need to get into that kitchen before the boys take it over again," Natasha said to Wanda. "Otherwise, there's no telling when those pies will get done."
"Cap, we've got new incoming!" he cried as he swooped overhead, his dual guns blazing. "Looks like goddamn garden rotors!"
Or at least, he was for the moment. Ever since the water monster attack, Peter's nightmares had been flaring as well, with one of his most recent escalating so badly that he and Tony ended up having to summon Bucky to help contain him. Steve had been a nearly inconsolable mess once they finally got Peter calmed down and back into bed, to the point where Tony threatened to call Sam to come up and talk to him, only backing down when Steve refused to stop begging him not to.
"Wakanda forever!" T'Challa yelled, just before crossing his forearms in front of his chest in the traditional Wakandan salute. Bright silver-coloured claws emerged from the tips of his fingers as his helmet closed over his head, shaped to resemble a black panther.
"He's comfortable, Tony," Carol said, so gently that Steve almost hugged her. "He's not in any pain, both Sharon and Sarah have assured us of that multiple times. As far as Peter knows, he's just in a really deep sleep."
Natasha gulped as she pointed to the screen. "These are names, guys," she said, the usual light rasp in her voice even more pronounced. "Now, they might just be there to throw us off, but—"
I can’t wait to see what you guys think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"Deputy Chief George Stacy," JARVIS began. "Deputy Stacy began his career as a police officer when he graduated from the police academy in Queens, then proceeded to move to the Bronx where he was stationed for the last two decades, ultimately rising to the rank of deputy chief. He was transferred to the Midtown precinct approximately three months ago, but it is unclear if the transfer was requested or simply assigned."
Rumlow rammed the tip of the penlight into his wound. The pain sent flashes into his field of vision. Pressing the single button on the penlight, Rumlow said, “Delivery complete.”
“You need to sit up and take this,” Steve says, reaching to tilt Bucky’s head so that he can manage to down the medicine.
“No, the virulence has been engineered out of the vector.” Strange touches the large monitor and pushes through a few data slides. He gets to a cartoon of virotherapy. “Essentially, we’re using the virus as a tool. All of the damaging parts of the virus’ genome have been removed. All that you have is what we need.”
They become frantic and crazed in their pursuit. Bucking against Tony, Steve reaches up and pulls him in for a kiss. As their lips meet, Tony freezes and his body jerks and for one horrible moment Steve thinks that Tony’s heart has given out, but the hot flood of semen across his erection clears away the fear and doubt.
“Don’t give me that tone, Rogers. I don’t intend to have you seeing people tell me what I should and shouldn’t do. You don’t get it. I am not living in your world. I live in a completely different world. One that’s not made for me. Your world is made for you, I have to pretend every fucking day that I can handle this.” Tony puts his hand up. “Just don’t. Don’t test me on this one.”
“You’re right, this is better,” Steve says, not mentioning that penetration would surely seal the bond between them. It becomes unbearable then, the thought of deceiving Tony in this way. He is his guardian, his protector, would it be honest, would it be right to do this and not tell him? He sits back on his haunches, moving out of Tony’s touch. It doesn’t matter now, he’s less aroused – and Tony notices.
Nothing. Not a whisper. There’s a knock on the door and Tony goes to answer it. The service guard has a cart with several platters of food. The man offers his wrist to Tony, who taps the implant to pay. Then the guard wheels the cart into the room, doesn’t even give a glance to the omega in the corner on the rack. He bows and exits without a word. Tony looks after him and wonders if he’s going to be the only one talking tonight.
“I missed you too, Buck.” Logically Steve knows he’s talking to a phantom, but stopping, walking away – he can’t do it. “I want to find you. Bring you home.”
“Seeing the future has nothing to do with your eyes and everything to do with your brain, your mind. And you have always been astonishing in that regard.” He pats Tony’s shoulder. “Now, let’s get you situated. Mister Hogan will be round with the car soon enough.” Jarvis moves off to finish his tasks and Tony turns to watch him.
“Well, Nat kind of expected that. We’re all going to ground. Can you make sure our finances stay solvent?”  He hated to put her in the middle of this, but he wanted to ensure the safety and well being of his coven.
The confirmation runs through Tony and he lays his head down on Steve’s chest to listen to his heart. “If we do this, then I want to tell you I’m committed. I know you probably read a lot about me. This is not a one night stand. I don’t do those anymore. That was another me, that was a me that’s been gone for years. Today, tonight, I’m with you and for as long as you’ll have me.”
Steve presses the heels of his hands into his eyes. “God, yes. Okay.” He drops his hands and sees the bursts of white and lights all around him for a second. “Before he – before they got things under control, he was a madman during his urgencies. He tried to knot me. He wanted to bond with me. I didn’t have a choice. I let him because he was my friend, my brother.” He cringes at the analogy but it’s the only one that works. “He promised me as a kid, that if he’d been an alpha he would bond with me. But no matter what he did, it didn’t take.”
Throughout dinner, Steve relished the feeling, soaked in it. He smiled at Tony, enjoyed the moment, and wondered if the feeling expanding over him, through him, might be that he was falling in love.
Tony shakes his head. “No can do. I checked it while you slept. It’s more of a fake than the real thing. He put what he wanted us to find in it and that’s it. There’s no fly controls, no stabilizer, no real engine. It’s mostly just window dressing.”
“And you’re saying I shouldn’t let Tony get away?” Steve finished up the eggs and munched on the extra slices of buttered toast. “If you remember, we can’t really get away from one another.”
Cutting into the water with powerful strokes, Steve slices toward the beacon, the hand, the one hope he has to find Tony. He ignores the bitter, icy cold of the water. It burns it is so icy. He keeps his eyes sighted toward the hand, and then it vanishes beneath the waves again. Undeterred, Steve kicks hard against the current’s pull and approaches Tony. Only to have the water rip Tony from his grasp when he comes within inches of catching a hold of his jacket.
“You know, I think I liked you with enough debt to choke a whole planet,” Fury says. “And your team went to the Rims to try and settle that dispute all by your lonesome without any push from me-.”
They trudge up the hill. It’s not a long incline to the other side of the yard, but the piles of snow and the weight of it makes it a workout nonetheless. By the time they get to the top, Tony wants to strip. He’s sweating.
Tony clung to him, his face buried in Steve’s shoulder. He shivered and then turned his head. “I feel like Thor just hit me with his lightning.”
“You still know it?” Tony waves his hand at Steve. “Sure, if you still know it, I’ll give you anything you want tonight. Anything.”
“I’ll concede that. We might need it,” Steve said. He went back to Maria. “Make sure that we have a clear view of everything going on. Send it through the comms. Only one pack member actually needs to hear it, doesn’t matter who. If someone loses a comm, the other pack members can warn them one way or the other through the soul bond.”
Only the echo of the well answers him. His eyes adjust to the low lighting and he twists on the chain looking for any sign of Tony. A gut churning fear that Tony’s below the water, dead already, hits him and starts to search with his legs and feet – finding nothing but bones. Part of him knows this is all virtual, Tony’s okay. There’s no need to worry. If he’s not in the rim then he must have been booted out of the connection. He’ll get back in soon enough. Of course, Steve has no idea if it means Tony has to go through the first two rims alone again.
“I couldn’t.” Tony drops his gaze and Steve hates himself a little more. “Don’t do that, Steve. I couldn’t because it meant exposing myself, to the possibilities, being vulnerable to the potential of something so momentous – I couldn’t hope. Do you see? I couldn’t hope.”
“Leave us? Split away? Die? Why?” Tony stomped, and it echoed in the pitch black around him. “Why do you have to do everything alone? Why are you such a god damned martyr.”
Frank, the monster or prick as Tony thinks of him, puts a hand on Tony's chest to shove him out into the narrow hallway. "Don't think he's interest, John-boy."
The thought of being around all those scurrying ants in the R & D division frustrates him and he can only huff in response. "I can work here as easily as I can work across the country. Don't be a twat."
He listens to none of it as Tony brings his hand to cradle the back of Steve’s head and guide him forward. The first touch graces his lips like a dance of wind, it is light, and airy, and stolen. Yet, Steve falls into it as if it drags him downward, an undertow daring to draw him under the waves. He welcomes it. His lips are dry and he fumbles but Tony shows him, with a stroke of a tongue soft and surprising, glancing over his lips and urging him to open.
be punished. He should follow what his father and Estane had taught him – though his father was a beta, with the proxy alpha of Estane to secure his family’s rights. It caused a huge issue with the hierarchy but then Aria had Tony. Once Tony’s status was confirmed and that he was a Prime to boot – the power of the Council shifted over to the Stark family and to Tony. His father acted as Regent until Tony came of age. Now both his mother and father are dead.
Going down into the living room, he realizes someone is at the front door. It’s cold, and he folds his arms over his chest and peeks out through the blinds. Natasha.  The Quin Jet is setting in the middle of the newly cleared road.
“Are you sure, Bruce and I built Ultron?” It haunts Tony. He doesn’t often admit to it, that he actually questions he’s own judgement. “People died because of Ultron. Died because of us – of me.”
Tony vows to always be there for Steve. Always hold him steady. Because he knows if Steve has to be the strong one, always holding the world on his shoulders like Atlas, then he’s going to break. He’s not going to be anchored where and when he needs to be - the here and now. If Tony ever fails him, ever leaves him, Steve will be unmoored. Lost within the sea of time and space. He’ll have nowhere to go, because Tony is his anchor. If Tony’s gone, Steve is lost. Tony promises himself to never leave Steve, never let that happen. He promises.
Punishment. What use is it if the subject of said punishment doesn’t seem to dread it or care about it? Tony prides himself on his intelligence and his ability to maneuver around difficult situations. He doesn’t have much ability to read people though. Pep might be right – this omega might be more of a trial than he wants or needs. But he’d been so perfect, succumbing to everything Tony did to him in the bonding room.
“This is right? Tony, I guessed, right? Yes?” Steve looks up and sees that Tony passed out. He’s both grateful and worried. At least Tony’s spared the throbbing pain from his chest, but then it leaves Steve burdened with doubts.
An arc of electricity like lightning crackled over the armor as Steve called again for Hill to alert Thor – asking for help. If anyone knew what the hell to do about lightning it would be the god of thunder. The Iron Man armor went rigid and all sound – the revving of the charge, the whirl of the gears – silenced. After a few seconds, Steve eased his arms from around Bucky and said, “Tony?”
“There are legends, myths of the Prime pairing,” T’Challa whispers to him. He can hear him not far away, but still ever in the distance.
“A little more about your position. I mean I don’t want details, but it seems to me that you really don’t want to be here. I mean no disrespect,” Tony says.
“Don’t tell me to calm down. You know what happened the last time they tried this shit in Germany.” Natasha said as she stood up, phone in hand. “If we let them do this to us again-.”
“He talked to Sam I’m pretty sure, and he’ll probably end up talking to Nat,” Tony said and then for only a few moments he let the strings of their souls go from the din in the background to the fore. He heard Steve’s brass along with Sam’s strings concert together. “Right now still talking to Sam. Again.” Should he be worried about Sam? Was Sam gay? Had Tony ever seen Sam with someone? Of course, they hadn’t been around one another long enough to know, but shit, he didn’t know. Maybe Sam was making a move on Steve. Shit, shit, shit.
“Oh you mean the listening devices?” Steve smirks. “Don’t worry, Coulson’s on my side. He’s a big Cap fan. And very pansexual, I think they call it.”
“I didn’t think that was the point. You asked me to wear shoe that would make noise,” Steve replied as Tony leads him into the dining room.
“I don’t want that kind of publicity, Nat. You know what would happen with the prince if it was found out. So no. I’m not reporting it and will deny it-.”
Tony shook his head. “No, I don’t care, I don’t fucking care.” He battered Steve. Hit him over and again with clenched fists against Steve’s chest. The sobbing wouldn’t stop. “He killed her. He killed my mother, my mom.”
Steve laughs but it holds no joy. “I don’t know what that’s supposed to mean.” He taps the ash off his cigarette and takes another drag. “You could come home. I want to find you, bring you back. Help you heal.”
He doesn’t say – he didn’t even confess his true nature to him. He thanks the doctor, signs the required forms, and then a hospital attendant ushers him into a private room to wait. It doesn’t even occur to him to ask to see his husband before the operation. When the attendant leaves, Tony collapses into a chair and sits stunned for several minutes.  Probably his actual stupor deafens him to the door to the room opening. When a hand touches him, he jumps, but then settles as Natasha places her other hand firmly on his chest and pushes him back into the chair.
The V-Corps agents stood and watched him flounder about, trying to get to the side of the building. They mocked and laughed at him. He dug his nails into the asphalt of the roof and attempted to crawl, but he had no strength left. Nothing. His body felt dried out already. One of the agents bent down and grabbed his arm. Another took his other arm and they hoisted him to his feet. The hot roof burnt the soles of his feet as they marched him to the cross. He tugged and thrashed but nothing stopped them. The sun rose and as it did, every second bleached out his power, his strength ebbed away, until he was almost grateful when they knelt him in front of the cross, his back to the wood.
Steve followed Clint’s lead through the rain storm and into the shack, because that’s all he could really call it now that they were up close and personal with it. From the approach it looked like an ordinary cabin, but upon closer inspection the dilapidation of the structure became apparent. Clint jerked open the front door and they walked into a one room cabin that was abandoned. The fireplace to the one side had cracked stones and a broken mantle. Steve glanced at the single bed with its shattered frame and a crawling feeling went up his spine.
He agrees; he doesn’t need an audience for this conversation. Gesturing to the cushioned chairs, he leads her to them and once she’s settled, he sits as well. Elbows on knees, leaning forward but trying not to intimidate, Steve says, “How are you?”
“Share? Fury, really, you never share a damned thing.” Secrets and lies. A dossier with nothing worth it in it. “Damn it.” He puts his head down on the cot, as he kneels next to it. He keeps his hand on his patient, near his pulse point, just to make sure.
“You were assaulted Steve. That’s a grievous issue with the Escort Guild. I could lose my license if it gets out.”
“Son, you’re not making any sense,” Clara says. “Now why don’t you get to the part where you’re going to tell me what a dead World War two hero has to do with my dead son?”
He reached out and caught her before she collapsed to the floor. The pain streaked up Steve’s arm, the one grasped around Natasha. He didn’t even have to look to know what had happened– the brand marked him and would scar her as well. As the searing pain subsided, Steve gritted his teeth and said, “I’m sorry.”
While he mulled over Loki’s fate a tapping on the door roused him. He blinked away the stasis, happy that he’d had a good amount of blood otherwise it would be more difficult to wake. “Yeah?” He scrubbed at his face. He stunk like come and blood.
“Less fun,” Bucky says and taps his metal finger along the polished console of Steve’s commander’s desk.
His partner disrobed and settled on the cushions. He had looked closed off, beaten and bruised both mentally and physically. His body was riddled with injuries as if he had been in a gang fight. He had looked up at Tony and said, “What are you waiting for? Just do it.”
Steve kept his face as still as possible but for some reason his mind skipped to Stark – how he would throw out a few sarcastic remarks to the two supposed wizards or sorcerers or whatever they pretended to be. There were times that Tony reminded him a little too much of his younger self – which didn’t make much sense because Tony was older than him in age but not in years lived.
“Just a little report for you, boss.” Happy shifts on his feet glancing at Steve and then back at the prince. “In private?”
Even as Steve ordered him away, Tony felt his fangs grow with hunger. Shamefaced, he raced away to his workshop and spent the next few hours going over the specs for the new energy source he invented for Stark Industries. While Pepper funneled money to him, he shuffled new inventions to the company to keep it solvent and healthy. She patented all of them under her name and Stark Industries. Working on the reactor didn’t help him stay away from his own mind. It circled back to his hunger. Usually when he had a normal feeding – which was less than a pint of blood – he could go for a week or more without feeding again. He’d already had much more than that and his belly ached for it. Anytime he thought of Steve, his feeding glands salivated, and his fangs grew prominent in his mouth. What the hell was wrong with him? He took to raiding Bruce’s stash of pig’s blood and downed a few pints. It sickened him, but he managed to keep it down. He snuck it after Steve discovered him drinking a mug of it in his workshop in the middle of the night. Steve looked betrayed, but said nothing, so after that Tony made sure Steve never saw the mugs of animal blood again. Thankfully, Steve excused himself and went back to bed where he belonged.
Steve bends over to gather his supplies. “How would he know? You said he can’t read our minds.” He switches off the sterno burner, packs the lantern, and slips the thermos into his pack. He misses the shield but then he remembers the small clip on his cuff.
“Well, that’s all good. Neither do I. Means this thing is still working the way it’s supposed to!” Tony grins. “That’s our first step to going home.” Luckily last night when he accessed the arc reactor he didn’t cook himself, just the deer leg. He slips the arc reactor back into place and when he glances over to Blu. As Tony tugs his shirt back on, he notices the lion has turned away from him. Then he realizes what he just said.
“Are we more than friends, would you say, Steven?” Thor asked one day as they stood in the locker room after one of their work out sessions.
Following the lighted signs, Steve registers at the Offices of Residence. He’d applied ages ago for a residential status but that required proof of a job. Luckily for him, he spent some time searching for a job before he even thought about getting residential status. When the agent scans his implant at the juncture of his neck and shoulder, he grumbles but his eyes drift over Steve, loitering at his groin. Steve sighs.
“Well, that’s good because neither one of us are really interested in mystical demons. We have enough on our hands with the aliens and spy stuff,” Natasha said, mimicking Wong’s pose.
“I have seen him since,” she confesses and that does draw his attention. He looks up at her. “I contacted him, after – well, after. I wanted to know, to find out if he was okay. He’s a Prime Alpha. He was your alpha but he was our Prime. You know that right?”
“Okay, we get across the river, get to the cabin, spend the night and then decide?” Tony says. “Your friend, Sam, he knows what to do, right?”
“Well, that’s how I see it,” Steve replied. “I feel it like a physical manifestation. I want you to know, I’m not going to just walk out. Nothing is going to happen that will lead to that.”
As he zeroed down on it, Steve yanked his arm away and pulled the cuff over the brand. “The serum will deal with it.”
With a wild groan, Tony pushes deeper and hits Steve’s prostate. It startles Steve and he cries out as the coil tightens in his groin and the need grows. He loves the way the prince stretches him, fills him. He wants the prince to push him to his limits, it feels right and sinful. It’s supposed to feel this way – Wanda told him that once. The best sex should feel right and sinful at the same time.
Steve – that’s his name he knows it now – blinks a few times trying to calm the waves of doubt and pain. “You – you’re Tony.”
“I don’t think so,” Tony says, his eyes hold a dark mystery to them as if he understands pain and horror. “Look, I am sorry for bringing it up.”
“Are you sure, last time I ended up taking a header in a very public restaurant.” Steve puts the coffee down. Tony can tell he’s antsy to get out.
Tony lifted a lip which only served to remind Steve of an old, mean dog that lived in the alley way behind his tenement house where he grew up in the 30s. He never would have believed that he would feel nostalgia for that dog. As Strange left, the rest of the Avengers lingered with Fury watching over them.
“The soul pack is the connection of astral projections through the dimensions. Each person has a soul or astral projection. The soul pack is that connection of souls or astral projections linking them together so that one cannot exist as a whole without the others.”
“Yeah, yeah, go.” He watches the omega leave and there’s a part of him that wants to follow like a little lost boy hoping that his hero will listen to him, imprint his Viz-net card. But the man – the shadow of a man – is just an omega, nothing more.
“Well then go, who asked you here anyhow? Is this about Rhodes and the suit? Or the government trying to take my armor. You can’t reverse engineer it, I figured out ways for that not to happen,” Tony had said and sipped his coffee. His head throbbed and no matter how many doughnuts he ate his mouth still tasted of plaster. What the hell had he been eating and drinking during his party? “No one can take the armor.”
The warrior only smiles. His gaunt face and pale skin only emphasizes the hungry look in his eyes. “Is there a difference?”
“Listen to your Guide, my friends,” Thor responded. “It is all of us. We have expected him as leader to piece together our pack, to tell us how to bring such divergent people together not only as members, but as family as well.”
Tony extricates himself from the lion’s grasp and starts a fire. Blu tears away the hindquarters again for him and then walks out of the circle of light from the fire to enjoy his meal. His tail swishes slightly as he eats but he keeps the bloody mess out of his sight. With some practiced skill, Tony manages to cut some meat off the deer and impale it on a stick. He cooks it over the fire and then eats. He’s found some berries around their site, but he has no idea if they are edible. He’ll be happy to eat some fruit and vegetables again. When he finishes, he grabs the HUD again and connects to the comm port. JARVIS is online in seconds.
“Wait, wait a minute. Tony’s a grown man with his own ideas and own life you can’t-.” The anger suffuses through him. Suddenly he gets all the crap that Tony’s put up with since the accident. “Tony can make decisions for himself. If he wants this, then he can decide.”
A hand grabs his ankle, and he seizes the opportunity to slam the edge of the shield into Hulk’s face. The nanobots don’t disappoint. The edge penetrates the bone, cracking it and slices into the eye socket. Steve gags and pulls the shield away. He can’t do this. These are his friends. The image of Hawkeye haunts him again and he nearly loses his focus. An armored hand grabs him and drags him away. The Hulk topples down the jagged slope.
His soul burst out like a beacon, a signal for help as his body was lifted out of the train wreck and into the terribly blue and perfect sky. The energy enveloping him paralyzed any movement as he grit his teeth and his arms splayed out. He tried to focus on the young woman, but the crimson light surrounding him closed him off. He tried to bring his arms down and to his sides but she held him.
“Natasha called,” Clint said. As her mate, Clint would want to get out of Dodge as well. “She thought they might pull something like this. I was on duty-.”
“I’m gonna get out of here, this time.” Tony walks to the workbench and slams his fist down. “And you’re going to help me.”
“Don’t worry. That’s not metal fatigue. It’s the metal stretching. Adamantium does that as does vibranium. It allows ships to deal with the stress of different gravities without transferring it to the occupants.” Tony goes through a few final docking procedures before he adds, “It’s one of the reasons we’re at war with the Kree. One of their earliest incursions happened to be on a base rich with adamantium.”
“Yeah, he’s coming. Should arrive by mid-day. He was already in transit when he called,” Bruce says. “I think he might have some info about these seizures.”
She doesn’t raise her head when she speaks again, but stares blankly at her folded hands. “Capta-Commander, this is complicated.”
Silence falls over them but then Steven breaks it. “It’s not a myth. It’s recorded in history on the old world.”
“Later when I get a sense of where-.” He stopped. He already knew where. The scratching ache in his chest wasn’t going to disappear unless he did something about it.
Whispering, Steve replies, “I’m here for you.” He moves and shifts until he’s facing Tony, hovering over his lap. Bringing their lips together, he kisses intently, intensely. The prince’s hard callused hands roam up and down Steve’s back, but barely press against the bruise there from his earlier encounter with the shock rod.
“We sent him someplace to try and get help for Barnes,” Fury said. “We need you to know that Rogers isn’t well.”
All of them turned to watch as the gurney was lowered, and Tony’s undead corpse sought out the blood. How it scented it, Tony couldn’t tell, but there was a strange metallic taste that overwhelmed his spiritual form. Mesmerized by the creature that had been him only hours before, Tony shivered as the whisper of wind blew through the cell. No one, not any of the corporeal beings, felt it. Was it the winds to come and take Tony away – dissipate him from this world?
The cabin is eerily silent, except for the howling winds of the storm outside. Tony stands frozen as if the frigid temperatures solidified him. Thoughts barely formulate in his head, the cold creeps and slithers through him. He’d been only inches (centimeters he corrects himself) away from the love affair of his life and he ruined it. He deserves to break apart like ice on the top of a lake, cracking and splitting.
When he wakes, darkness, like a shroud, encompasses him. There are moments of confusion and bleak awareness before things around him crystalize. The thickness of the air feels like a flea bitten cloak, it bites and covers at the same time. Off to the side he hears dribbles of water dripping in a constant beat that’s neither repetitive nor slowing. He tries to figure out exactly why he’s been dumped off in this world of darkness to save Tony Stark, but that’s when a cloth touches the side of his face and a callused hand pushes down on the back of his shoulder. He hadn’t realized he attempted to sit up. He’s that disoriented. Becoming human will do that to an angel.
Steve jumps up from his bed, knocking his tablet to the floor. “What? He’s not supposed to arrive until tomorrow!”
“Yeah, that means that whatever you did in the future – which would be a different reality – would affect this new reality. That means that the reality where Steve’s a singularity affects this one.”
Steve picked up the papers of the file on Bucky again as he sat forward. He tossed them across the table. “And what about that? I’m ready to start putting it together, but Bucky’s part of the pack and what do I tell Stark? Does Tony really need to know that someone in our soul pack killed his parents?”
A whine catches his attention – a mechanical whine and then the platform shakes with energy and lights flash. The air around them shifts and smells of o-zone like a lightning strike. A figure appears on the platform and wavers a bit. Tony dashes for the steps but before he can get there, the helmet comes down.
“No, don’t do that,” Tony says. “It’s sweet and wonderful to meet someone so unstained by the world. I want to learn everything there is about you, Captain. I want to drink you in and feel you in my bones. I want to know that when I wake in the morning I’ve discovered everything there is to know about you.”
Her giggle drew him to look at her. Her attempt to wipe the smile off her face failed. “That’s just what Tony said. No one really knows where the power comes from. We know it’s cosmic but not how it works. Maybe the sun is just too close? That the power from it overloads us?” Natasha shrugged and then smiled wider. “Maybe Tony will figure it out.”
“I didn’t know,” Steve said and looked down at his battered body. “I didn’t.” He should have and that’s a fault in his leadership.
As he rounded the last flight of stairs, he heard the door to the garage open and the march of boots on the steps. Steve stopped and pressed his back against the wall. He looked up to see the camera focused on him. Grimacing, he flung his shield at it, shorting it out as the agents converged on his position. The first of six he managed to elbow in the nose with the sickening crush of the cartilage resounding in the closed space. The next two edged him up the stairs, but he wanted that as he quickly clicked the shield in place on his back, grabbed the railing, and kicked both of the men in the face. He found his footing on the other side of the staircase, closer to his destination. The last three agents surged down the staircase in a coordinated wave. Two jabs to the face and one kick got the first down and out. The second and third pulled out their shock sticks and Steve only shook his head. He pulled his shield onto his arm and crashed the edge into one agent’s solar plexus even as he tried to hit Steve with the shocker. He went down, gasping for air. The last agent stretched forward as Steve spun on his heels. The shock stick crackled, and Steve lurched down the stairs as the pain lanced through his side. He took advantage of the slide down and, turning, bashed the agent in the chest. He didn’t stop to check on them, just raced toward the garage and his motorcycle.
“You said.” The pain shoots through him and he swallows down the urge to vomit. “You said that no one soul can dismiss your power. No
Steve glanced at Natasha who had turned away from him. Bruce presented a danger and Steve knew it. The idea that Bruce might be under the control of SHIELD always lurked in the back of his mind. He understood that Fury might be trying to protect Bruce’s position. SHIELD already knew about Bruce – about his affliction and his membership in the soul pack. It occurred to Steve then that Fury stood between the exploitation of the Hulk by SHIELD and Bruce’s freedom. Times like these gave Steve hope for this century.
For a terrible second, Tony thought he’d died but then a scream from the adjacent corridor brought him back to the reality of his situation. He saw the rise and fall of Steve’s chest. It gave him the energy to move, to run, to find safety. Towing the gurney, Tony raced to join Natasha and Clint, stopping at the intersection of the corridors. He peered around the corner to find that Natasha and Clint had easily dispatched a half dozen more agents, though Clint clearly had a bullet wound to the shoulder that would likely make it difficult to pull the bow and Natasha grew ashen. Tony spotted several hits of the wooden spikes to her abdomen.
As they cross the open area near the barn, a child runs out of the house and waves to them. It’s Lila and she races to them as if they’re long lost relatives. Her hair is tied up into a ponytail and she’s wearing fingerless gloves, thick leather vembraces, and a matching vest.
“This way,” Tony says and shows the omega to the farthest branch of the hallways in the aft section. This area glimmers with his wealth. The beauty of the universe is designed right into the ship. It captures the glint and shine of the hyper-scape and when they are not folding space for travel, it highlights the starscape. When he glances at Steven, he sees that the man is impressed.
“Yeah, yeah, but he’s a Negro. If Schmidt threatens the town and Sam needs to defend it, if he ends up killing a white man, I can only hope there won’t be a lynching. I told him to sit tight and just watch. But I still worry.” Steve shakes his head. “I think I’ve let my emotions take control. Maybe I should have sacrificed- but it’s not my sacrifice to make.”
“This is not going to be easy,” Steve mutters. He doesn’t admit out loud that it’s about as clear as mud but contends privately that they’re in Ultron’s brain and not the other way around. He hopes.
He leaves the mansion, making sure not to turn back or listen to find out if his omega puts up a resistance or fight. He keeps his mind stalwart and his vision on the beautifully groomed shrubbery and flowering bushes. He continues forward, down the path toward the Conference building, counting the steps as he goes, trying not to think about how they will strip Steven of his jacket and shirt, how he will be tied to the old punishment post near the barns, how he will be whipped with a cane enough times to bleed.
Rumlow only snickered in response and then jabbed the skewer with a quick, stabbing motion into Tony’s chest. He gasped as the iron nail went through him, piercing him into place. Rumlow gestured for one of the other agents to come over and hand him the mallet. He pounded it in. Every stroke of the hammer was another agony, another step into hell. Tony didn’t need to breathe, he needed no air, but somehow being speared through stole his energy until he gulped and jerked against his bonds. Rumlow lingered for a moment, watching Tony. He smirked and arched his brow as he bent down to look Tony in the eyes.
“You shifted how you were sitting on the bed,” Tony says. “When I can see again, will you share it with me, Steve?”
“At this point, I don’t know what’s going on. We have to get this under control and that’s one of the reasons I came to New York,” Steve said. “We have the core Avengers, except for Thor who I think is still off planet. I don’t know. I don’t even know if the whole soul pack thing will work with him. But we have to – I have to get more of this under control.”
It was only three years ago he lost Bucky and downed the Valkyrie – at least by his counting. He doesn’t have much left of who he was anymore. Back then, he hid a lot of who he was, even from Bucky. Steve wraps his arms around himself, the cold creeps in like it always does. Maybe at one time, he might have had a chance to change the path he’d picked but not anymore. With a quick glance he checks on Tony, who seems to be sleeping. Steve will never know how it feels to sleep next to him, to listen to the rise and fall of his chest, to know that warm body close to him, how it means the world.
Bucky deposits him in the chair behind the desk and Steve releases a pent up breath. Doctor Banner, Clint, and another man – who stands off to the side in the darker corner of the front office – join them. There’s a moment of long silence and awkward surveillance where each of them are checking out the others.
He taps on the arc reactor. “This? Nope. Well, I was dying or could have died because palladium – not the best core in the world since it is super toxic. But I already fixed that. I wasn’t about to just – you know - let it kill me.”
Well, that confirmed Steve’s hopes that Fury might still be in play and may still be on his side, though he had no idea about the rest of the coven or their humans. How many were in cells like these? How many of the coven were chained to crosses on the rooftop baking in the sunlight? Just the thought of those crosses, of Tony nailed to one of them. sent Steve into a rage and he bucked against the manacles only to have them turn from chains to solid mass again, keeping him in place. He screamed and cried out.
“I hope not,” Steve says, and he must be turned away from Tony – looking out into the sea toward Greenland. Steve’s focus changes, “It’s cold here. Blustery. Riding with you – that was great. Now, this is beautiful but cold. I never liked the cold. Ma and me, we lost power one winter. Not because of an ice storm or anything. We lost it because we couldn’t afford the bill. We went three weeks with no heat in the middle of February. I thought I would freeze to death. I was only like ten or something. Ma cried at night when she thought I was sleeping. The idea that you could change all that. With cheap efficient clean energy? Tony, you’re going to save the world.”
“Is that what you think of me? As your captor?” Tony asked and he felt like his meal turned cold in his gut.
“Let’s move out,” Natasha said. She nodded to Clint and he went to the door, slipping outside into the corridor before moving back in and then gesturing to the gurney.
Getting down to the workshop, Tony presses himself up against the wall in the hallway. His eyes prickle with tears, but not from the memory of death – from the realization that he longs for Blu, he wants Blu. Blu is more than a lion to him; Blu is his soul companion. It terrifies him. He’s fucked up. He’s in love with an animal. He chokes on bile and races to his workshop locking the door.
“I don’t know,” Steve says. “I saw some wine. It’s white so it really doesn’t go with the beef stew.”
He thinks of his dream of being saved by the hero of the story. “Nat, I know I have to be my own hero, so don’t worry about me.” He doesn’t wait for her to reply. He leaves the brothel at the same time a creeping sensation chills his spine.
She turns to him. Her eyes are harder than he thinks they should be. “Tony’s always been overworked and overextended. I appreciate that you’ve spent time thinking beyond your most basic contract.”
He scans the area – he swore Tony left it here, but Steve cut him off. Maybe he’d moved it to somewhere on the porch or near the picnic table or target or even in the house. His own arrogance would be his undoing.
“Now, you interacted a little with the outside world and you found out that the world is filled with assholes.”
I was overwhelmed and so grateful to all of you who read and commented on the last chapter! These comments really helped me when I was going through this chapter and doing the revisions that my beta suggested. I also added a few additional words because of your feedback! Thank you for helping to shape this story and make it better!
Steve nods. Logan has always been a loner. Even when he tries to reach out and make attachments, they always unravel on him or he tears them apart, frays them to snap. It’s his way and Steve should be happy that the burden of choice has been lifted from his shoulders. It still fissures something deep inside.
Their banter keeps up for the better part of the morning until they drop off into a quiet and peaceful companionship. Every now and again Steve studies Tony when he's not aware, when his eyes seem focused inward rather than on the lengthening landscape before them. Marked on his face, Steve notices a clear and critical expression. He may spend much of his time acting as a casual flippant observer of the human condition, but Steve doubts the actuality of it. He doesn't say anything, only keeps his eye on Stark as they ride toward the lower plateau and the river below it.
“Getting undressed.” He still has his t-shirt on, surely Steve’s not so disgusted with him that he’s going to cancel the whole thing. He freezes. “Do you not want to do this?”
Steve whipped his head around to meet her gaze. Tears streaked his face and he growled at her, “I would never abandon Tony. Never! I would go through it again and again, what happened if it meant that Tony was safe. But he wasn’t safe. Do you get that? He should have been safe. That was my job.” He dropped his head back and covered his face with his hands.
Sawyer gestured toward the stone steps. “I have to admit. I kind of wanted to see you in the armor, sir. We expected you and all, but then again the air defense of this place is kind of crazy.”
He likes to be called Tony by his close friends. His closest friend in Colonel James Rhodes who heads up the Stark fleet. The prince has been on the front lines for years before his father and mother were killed. He had been injured during one of the incursions and nearly died but managed to construct his own augmentation – an artificial heart. That fact blows Steve away. How does anyone design and replace their own heart?
Steve rips his attention away from the beauty and focuses on Natasha. “I’m not a virgin if that’s what you’re asking.”
Raza turns to his crew and directs one of his soldiers to the wounded man on the floor. The soldier aims and shoots again, blasting the man’s head. He then drags what’s left of him out of the cave. After, Raza turns to Steve and they start again, this time it sounds like they are bartering, going back and forth on a final price.
“Don’t think about it, it’s not a sin to love,” Tony says and Steve relaxes against him, easing his body so that Tony has access. Suddenly, Steve’s lying against the pillows, the wires and mechanical toys, and other tools have been swept away. Tony’s intent and dark over him like a shadow encompassing him.
Steve shakes his head, his hands trembling as he grips the sides of the sink. “I don’t know how? I’m a soldier, Tony. You know that. That’s who I am. I know the physical fight, not this. Not the mental one.”
Tony translated for Steve. “It seems my newly changed Divini blood infected you and you’re changed now. We don’t know how but you’re not exactly who you were before.” Something dark shadowed Tony’s eyes. “I’m sorry.”
“Wakanda has something nicer, I think.” He tries to shrug but there’s no energy left in his body. “I had to- I went into heat.”
Happy waved for Sawyer to lead him and the guard nodded, his baby face streaked with fear. “I’m gonna lose my job, aren’t I?” Tony heard him ask Happy as they walked to the elevator.
Steve doubts that entirely, but he doesn’t argue. They separate but walk close to one another as they enter Prime Station. Tony eyes the crowds and Steve spots Happy not far off, he’s leading the way to the park. Steve suspects that only thoroughly vetted people will be allowed in the park with the prince. That seems a little overkill especially since Tony’s been roaming the station for nearly a week now. Steve wonders if that means some of the meetings, he hasn’t been privy to have been going off the rails.
“Omegas are the reason we’re in the situation we are in,” Tony comments and they exit the ship with a flank of guards. He doubts he needs them on this desolate planet. It took him years to get used to the guards following him everywhere again. After he’d run wild in the Lanes, he never thought he’d have to come back to the dictates of society again. Never say never.
Steve never hesitated. He slipped his arm around Tony’s shoulders and then bent and brought the other one under his knees. In seconds, Steve cradled him like a baby or a new bride. With fast steps Steve went up the narrow staircase, never bashing Tony’s head on the walls or the railing. Tony would have blushed – had he had the capability to do so. Steve brought him into their usual room when they were at this particular coven flop house. This was Tony’s officially assigned house according to the Vampire Registry kept by the V-Corps. Of course, his conclave kept it as a front and Tony actually lived elsewhere.  Vampires couldn’t own property, the dead had little legal rights, owning property wasn’t one of them. It just wasn’t allowed.
“I told Steve, but I don’t think he understood. Maybe he did. I don’t know. I didn’t have enough time before Ross came in with Rumlow,” Clint said and placed a hand over his eyes. “God, what did I do?” He dropped his hand. “You have to understand, Tony.  I am devoted to Steve. He had it right, I get that. But I had to trade my principles for my family. I had to save them.”
Blu sits with his back to him, pawing at the side of his face and ignoring everything he’s saying. Tony glares at the lion. He tosses the dead animals aside and rubs away the sticky blood from his shirt. Picking up the helmet casing, he trudges down the hill to get some water. At least he can fill his belly with water. He’s careful and drinks before he fills the helmet then, walking as if on eggshells, he makes his way back only to find Blu on his back rolling around and kicking the neat pile of armor pieces around their camp.
Tony smiles with a slight upturn of his lips. "Well, if that's the way you want to play it, Captain. What would you like to know?" He waves Jarvis over to serve them and Steve sits out of the way as the dishes are revealed, including steaming potatoes, corn, large cuts of beef, and ham, fresh fruits and dried ones as well. The wine is poured and rolls are buttered. "Thank you, Jarvis." He peers up at Steve. "Captain, eat and question, I'm ready."
“No, they were a minor family, just trying to get onto the Council. I never- the worlds outside – the worlds in the rim and the lanes – they aren’t like this.”
He frowns. It’s an old saying about weather, nothing more. He shifts and sits up; he can’t help himself. His bones ache with the cold; he feels old yet elated. It’s a strange dichotomy of emotions. Tony follows him, smiling with the same drunken look at Steve must have. Steve cups his face and asks, “No migraine.”
“He was a captain in the Union army,” Bucky supplies as Natasha leaves the room with an arched bow and a sarcastic smile on her face. When Steve waits it out, Bucky throws up his one hand and says, “Come on Doctor, we have to leave so the sweet little Sheriff can get dressed.”
Over the next hour, they talk sparingly, but Tony finds it easy and peaceful. He gazes out the glass doors watching the birds flitter about the bare trees. There’s a tree with berries on it that the birds pick at and flutter away with their treats. He doesn’t think he’s ever just sat and breathed, watched the world go by without worry about it. Of course, he admits to himself that niggling thoughts in the back of his mind prickle and poke through, but there’s something about the intimacy with Steve that changes his perspective. He’s never known this kind of closeness, where he feels perfectly comfortable. His worries melt away and he becomes – he is – he is just breathing, being.
The arch pulses with a blue white light as if reprimand Tony for his assessment of Ultron. “Don’t you recognize me, my dear maker. I am the Guardian of Life.”
He plummeted toward the floor of the atrium, only the thin disk of vibranium between him and death. Colliding, the impact rattled his bones and then shield vibrated so hard his teeth chattered. He did a second tiny bounce and then stilled. The whole of the atrium paused around him, all the agents and administrative staff frozen by the sight of Captain America laying on the floor. He didn’t have a moment to regroup. They would be coming after him. Pushing his fist into the floor, he hoisted his body up and felt every muscle ache and every bone shudder. How many bruises, strains, or fractures he might have sustained, Steve didn’t pause to find out. He staggered a step and then ran, full out across the atrium toward the parking garage. He needed to get to his bike and out of the Triskelion before they locked out the bridge.
“Oh!” Bruce put up a finger and hurried back to the lounge, only to bring back the bundle of papers with the print out on soul packs. “Here you go.”
Tony snickers. “If you’d known, if you’d known. I wonder what you knew then that caused you to not wait on a man with perfectly good money?”
Tony has no idea what the hell Steve’s talking about, but right now that’s par for the course. Shit, he’d even play a round of shitty golf – the fucking most boring game ever – if he could get out of this hell. “Well, your friend there said we have to get out of here now. I think she’s right.”
He stops at the right apartment and she points to the door across the hall. “You’re visiting my neighbor?”
Clint went up to the fireplace and placed one of his wrist bands to the stones. The image shuttered, and an elevator appeared. He keyed in the code and then they walked onto the elevator. As the doors closed the stones on the fireplace materialized again. Steve smiled ruefully.
“It’s my nature to worry, Tony. I worry about our daughters; I worry about you. I’ve been worrying about you since I met you.” He growls in his throat and Tony instantly is hard.
“Did you sleep well?” Tony asked. His hands were at his sides. He looked relaxed. His eyes, though, flittered around the room, jumping and skittering.
“You don’t have to worry. I’m here, Tony. I’m here.” With his whispers comes the realization that Tony will never be alone again. The structure of his life changes, he feels the old life disintegrating around him, crumbling and falling like an old empire. The walls, the foundation are swept away with Steve’s ministrations. With each kiss, and lick, and taste, his old life is undone and he is reborn.
A voice from the blistering wind laughs. “You don’t understand, dear Captain. In only moments I will have complete control of your autonomic system. You’ll be a visitor in your own body. You’ll watch paralyzed as I command every movement you make and every word you utter. His pitiful worm cannot destroy me. It cannot stop me. I have become you.”
"These semi-enhanced, I guess we're calling them. We've all been operating under the impression that they've only been coming after Pete with these attacks, but what if that's only part of their overall mission?"
And finally, there it was, the confession Tony had been begging and pleading for ever since Peter had woken up from his coma down in that Miami hospital. Tony knew that Steve had been struggling hard ever since then, but he had always outright refused to admit just how badly.
“Fuck!” Steve cried into the dim light of their bedroom, his eyes squeezing closed as Tony increased his speed.  He was barely hanging by a thread.  “Tony, I can’t—!”
"I'm sorry, Mr Beck, but that's my final word on the subject," Tony said firmly. He got to his feet and held out his hand towards Beck, who looked as though he would rather spit on it than shake it. "I'll let you know when I've completed my analysis of the holographic system."
"Just so long as all of this works," said Cam. "'Cause you know if it doesn't then O'Brien's gonna come down on all of us like a big bag of hammers."
It doesn't help that, for some reason, Tony seems utterly oblivious to his own charisma and charm.  And, how whenever Steve tries to bring up that fact, attempts to compliment him during one of their late nights tucked inside Tony’s lab when he’s tinkering and Steve’s sketching, Tony never fails to brush it aside, almost like he’s embarrassed.  Steve has heard him mention that he’s too busy to date, and while Steve can see that—he is a single father, after all, among all of his other responsibilities—he also secretly wishes that wasn’t the case.
Bucky remained frozen, still for long seconds, but then tentatively raised his arms and gently brought Steve into his embrace as well. The feel of Bucky in his arms brought back memories of the last time they embraced – right before he’d left Steve and shipped out. Tears stung his eyes as he hung onto Bucky and then buried his face in his neck. The soul waves pulsed a new beat as if finally coming into resonance. Bucky shuddered against Steve but didn’t fight it – in fact it felt as if he welcomed it.
He tries not to think about that first interaction with Tony – how he collared Steve, how he brought him to the presentation suite. How Steve knew instantly, the moment Tony knotted him that everything changed. Of course, Steve had obfuscated even then. Told Tony that he’d never really been with anyone but the USO girls on tour before – that it was his first presentation. He didn’t want to talk about Bucky – for him then Bucky had been dead for over seventy years. Why bring up what happened to Bucky and all of that hell that followed it?
“It’ll work its way out, Captain.” Fury edged a little on the side of the table, his leather coat creaking as he sat down. “The pack will work its way out, I mean. Eventually, souls will connect and you’ll just designate each person of your pack with a title, a function.”
“No, no, no,” Steve says and yanks off his gloves to slap Tony on his face. His fingers are numb, the cold air and the water do not mix well at all.
“Like I said, you need to stay still. And be quiet. I got us a hiding place, but I have no idea where we are right now. Who might be lurking, so to speak.”
Tony jolts as the makeshift sled bouncing over the bumps and then it hits him what Steve said and he tries to twist around, the shield spins in response. The landscape whirls wildly around him and there’s no stopping it. The shield seems to pick up speed as it lurches down the hill while spinning like a top. He has but one choice. He launches himself off the demented sled and rolls into the cold snow, happy to be free of the ride.
“Oh, sorry. Forgot. Don’t know why JARVIS only had partial information,” Tony says and frowns. They had been looking in the wrong area, apparently, thus the reason no rescue mission found them until Tony had been able to fix the communications link in the HUD. “Well anyhow, it’s good to be home.” He owes her an explanation and he starts to formulate one but she holds up her finger to stop him.
As he stepped up to the door of the penthouse office, it swung open to reveal the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Human Security. While Ross always looked aggravated, Pierce welcomed Steve into the office and offered a hand. “It’s an honor to meet you, Captain. My father fought in the 101st.”
“Touché,” Clint said but didn’t deny it or explain it. He crossed his arms over his chest and grumbled, “You see all the shit they dumped on the internet?”
“It’s as if he takes care of them,” Tony says and scans the single room. He glances at the door and imagines the woman across the hallway. The money.
Steve shook his head. “Not sure. It was kind of automatic before. Like I just reached out and suddenly knew where Natasha was or called mentally to Sam and he came.”
“Whatever you say,” Steve murmurs and his eyes feel heavy and his chest tight. He already has that muddy feeling, like linens woven into his brain. He knows it’s too late, he’ll be dealing with infection and fever in the morning. He doesn’t say anything, not because he wants to hide it, but because his tongue’s too thick and his gaze too bleary.
Taking a beer, Steve pushes past Tony and goes into the living room. “Well, I thought we did. I’m not so sure about what you thought.”
"Shield?"  He has memories of the disk, the shield he held in his hands, how smooth it was, how light it was for such a large metallic object. But all of those visceral memories are fake. "How can I help you, sir?"
“I’m not used to such fundamentalist view of my caste,” Steven says and still doesn’t drop to his knees.
“Once again, though, I am sorry I jumped to conclusions. I should have known better. Before we contracted with the Widow’s Brothel, we insisted on a full background check on you.”
"Yes, yes," Sharon said as she quickly detached the radiation hose and unsealed the container only a second before Peter violently jerked, gasped, and immediately began to choke.
“I sure think so,” says Steve.  “I honestly can’t believe no one’s recognised his potential before now.”
"Well, I don't know, little guy," Steve said, nearly backing into a particularly large display as another guy attempted to squeeze by him. "Do you know what kind of flowers your friend likes?"
replied the doctor, who while masked, gowned, and bent over the tiny, motionless infant lying in the incubator, was someone that Tony instantly recognised.
by the beginning of the year," Uncle Bruce said as Dad pulled his car onto the street. "She's already got the first draft undergoing review."
Peter mentioned that Steve won his first gold medal right out of college, which Tony figures would put him at about twenty-two years old here.
Dad let out a loud groan, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Nah, I'd really rather not talk about it, Pete. There's nothing you need to worry about anyway."
"Who are you?" he said in his Captain's voice, or at least what was passing for his Captain's voice with a tongue that weighed a hundred kilograms and a mouth that felt like it had been coated with a thick layer of rock salt.
“Well, I’m pretty sure that whoever owned it before me didn't quite appreciate its value, since I found it in a pawn shop,” said the man.  “Still cost me a pretty penny, but not as much as if I would’ve found it on eBay or something.”
Dad said, stating exactly what Peter was thinking. If the Meridians did have a spy embedded somewhere in the Air Corps, then that could mean whoever it was could also know about not only Project Phoenix, but JARVIS as well.
A loud snorting sound broke him from his thoughts, and he glanced over at Grandpa, barely suppressing a giggle as he shifted slightly and his mouth dropped open.
“Tony,” he says, so softly that he’s surprised Tony can even hear him.  He reaches for Tony’s shoulder, curling his fingers into his first at the last second.  “Tony, I—I’m—”
Around Tony, everything else was still and quiet, save for the occasional gust of breeze and the quiet sobs of the green chick—
"Captain!" Carol cried as she attempted to reach for the gauntlet before Thanos got to his feet, only for him to actually remove the Power Stone from the gauntlet, encase it in his right fist, and punch her directly in the face with it, sending her flying across the plain.
“All right!  Now that’s what I’m talking about!” Obie practically yelled once the simulation was over.  He gave Tony’s shoulder another hard clap, shaking him so hard that some of his coffee sloshed over the rim of the mug.  “So, how soon can I set up the meeting with the Joint Chiefs?”
"Shall I commence with rendering, sir?" JARVIS asked. "I do believe the diagnostics with the physical nanites will take several days."
The drive to the school passed in a blur, and before Tony knew it, he was forcing a plastered smile onto his face as he pulled into the parking lot, where Peter was waiting with his friends outside the doors.
"No. I'm gonna stay and help," Peter said firmly just as yet another suit flew in through the hole in the roof, aiming directly for Uncle Sam. Peter immediately launched another web, catching the suit around its neck as it flew overhead.
"No, no, you're right," Tony said as he pulled out his phone. "JARVIS? Has Pete left the school yet?"
The big hotshot pilot was not only hotter than hell, he was also a master cuddler. And that happened to suit Tony just fine.
"Yeah, we're not usually too big on plans," added Quill. He jerked his head towards Mr Clean—Drax, apparently—and Antennae Lady. "Not winging it isn't really what they do."
As soon as he was settled Grandma set down the tray, stepping back with a satisfied smile as Peter quickly dug in. She had made him biscuits and gravy, along with what seemed to be actual, real-life freshly-squeezed orange juice, something that Peter hadn't had in years. It all tasted so incredibly yummy that for the briefest of moments, Peter actually forgot that he was sick.
"Mmm," grumbled Peter. "It's nothing to be embarrassed about. My dad likes—or at least, liked—both girls and guys, and he's not embarrassed about it."
No matter the mission, the risk that someone wouldn't survive it was always there. Bucky's fall from the train had hammered that lesson home quite well.
"Whoa!" Peter exclaimed as his fingers curled around her arm, preventing her from hitting the floor. He immediately hauled her back to her feet, overcompensating enough that Gwen ended up planting her palms on his chest to prevent them both from tipping in the other direction.
"How can you promise that?" Tony asked, hating that he felt so helpless and weak. He was Peter's father, and fathers were supposed to be strong.
"Where the hell do you think he is?" grumbled Bucky. "It's not like this isn't important or anything."
Tony moaned as Steve hoisted him into his arms and carried him over to the massive bed, laying him gently down. He crawled up to hover over him, trailing his fingertips down Tony's cheek as Tony glided his palms up Steve's strong arms.
And the last thing that Howard heard before he was shoved into the backseat of the Safety Officers' car, was the sound of his wife attempting to comfort his son, trying and failing to hold back her own sobs of despair.
Peter nodded, keeping his eyes closed against the harsh late afternoon sun. "Yeah, that was probably him. The girl's name is Gwen Stacy, but I didn't really ask anything about her dad."
"Now, Петр!" Bucky said as they burst from behind their barricade just as the enemy appeared on their left. Before Bucky had even gotten the words out, Peter was on his feet, launching his webs at the target's legs and yanking down, chattering nonstop about how he was going to show it who was boss. The target immediately fired its booster, attempting to break away with Peter still attached as Bucky took aim, taking it out with a single shot to its chest.
"We'll be down in the procedure room if you need us," Sam said, clinging tightly to Bucky's hand. "It has an anteroom where Colonel Phillips said we could observe, as long as that's okay with you guys."
“That’s my boy.”  Tony pressed a soft kiss to the top of Peter’s head, ruffling his hair a bit before he headed into the kitchen.  He hadn’t been exaggerating when he’d told Steve that he couldn't cook, but he did at least know how to unwrap a bag of microwave popcorn and turn the thing on.  After that, it was up to JARVIS to make sure the stuff didn't burn.
"Mmm, maybe," Tony said. "I can't wait for you to meet him. He's impossible not to love, so you guys are gonna get along great."
"Tony! Oh my God, you're awake!" Steve exclaimed as he leaned closer, carefully cupping his husband's cheek. "How're you feeling? Are you in any pain? What can I do for you?"
"All right." Steve pressed another kiss to Tony's forehead for good measure before sliding off the bed, the strong muscles in his arms, back, and shoulders rippling deliciously. As soon as he'd crossed the spacious room to the bathroom, Tony flopped onto his stomach, burying his face into Steve's pillow and breathing in. It was an extremely poor substitute for the man himself, but it would do well enough until he came back.
But he didn't dare say that out loud. He had not taken the news of Gwen's upcoming summer internship well at all, and while he had apologised to her multiple times since then, he still felt guilty about not being more supportive.
Somehow, Steve doubted it. As he had told Senator Davis at the hearing, no one else could possibly understand Steve's perspective of crashing into the ice having recently witnessed the Nazi's rise to power, and being able to immediately recognise the exact pending signs almost as soon as he was defrosted.
"Don't!" Steve yelped. He winced, holding up his hand in apology. "Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. I'm just—I'm just—"
More tears welled in Peter’s eyes, dripping down onto his pillow.  “So, you're not gonna see him at all this weekend?”
“Morning, Nat.  Still too early to tell.”  After saying hello to Lorraine, Steve crosses the office to his cubicle and starts unpacking his croissant and apple juice, grunting in resignation when he hears the telltale squeak of Natasha’s chair as she rolls backwards from her desk.
Steve clears his dry throat. “Most of it.” Sitting up, he groans as his back creaks in response to sleeping on a grated deck.
“Dismiss me for what? For Tony having a seizure. Not even Doctor Strange could have prevented that!” Steve says.
He draws the reins of Shield’s halter and the horse simply follows, he only needs to lead the reins a tad, because Shield trails after him, much like a dog would.  She’s a nice rich sorrel color with some white markings along her legs. He strokes along her nose and she nays at him.
“For so long, I ignored the feelings inside. I pretended. But now I feel like I’m waking up from the ice all over again. Like for the first time I can see and feel what it’s like-.” He stopped, and Tony felt the tremor through him. “I’ve always been so sure of everything. Now I’m not. Now I see where I’ve been blind. A leader cannot lead unless they see. I see now.”
“Yeah. I’ll be back. Don’t take out any of the wires or tubing, okay?” Bruce lumbers out of the room.
Tony stopped him with a finger to his lips. “We do have shared life experiences, Steve. We do. I’ve wanted that connection too. Every damned day. I wanted it.”
“Well, tell me where Thor and Loki have gotten off to and I might be able to persuade Odin to take up the mantel of the war again.”
“Stop fidgeting, I can’t get your tie done.” Pepper unknots the tie again and flips up his collar. “Where are your glasses?”
Steve reaches back, grabbing hold of Tony at the same time he pushes his chair away from the desk. He flips Tony over his shoulder and onto his lap. He’s already hard. His erection presses against Tony’s hip.
“I’m glad,” Steve replied. “It’s good.”  Once he finished with the bed, he glanced at the open window. “Do you want me to close it?”
“No, just these dreams I keep having about-.” He swallowed down his pride, his fear, his anxiety, his revulsion, and yes, his excitement. “About Tony. The dreams – the real ones all involve Tony.”
Steve doesn’t loiter. He doesn’t have time, Clint’s right. The media circus is going to be a nightmare. They could have opted to not announce to the media that they were starting the clinical trials on the Pym nanotech, but Tony insisted. It was groundbreaking what they were trying to do. It could change the face of medical science. If they succeed, then Tony would not only get his sight back, but the world would have a potent new way to heal damaged brain tissue and nerves. It means a world of difference for people with spinal cord injuries, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and more. This advancement isn’t just for Tony’s particular case but be relevant to a number of other neurological diseases.
Tony puts the container down and grasps Steve’s hand, making the living god help him to his feet. He resists Steve’s encouragement, inwardly cursing at the man but at the same time curiosity blossoms, warm and expansive in his chest. The thought that Steve cares and wants to do something, even in the ridiculous, slightly insulting way, shines through to Tony. He can’t help but smile.  Steve leads him out on the grass, holding him like he’s a child just trying out new skates. Tony glances around; they aren’t the only ones here in this little corner of the park. Over near the next copse of trees, a couple next to each other but with their phones drawing their attention. Directly in front of them a group of elderly gentleman and women play chess. To the side, Tony can hear children playing, but the data detector of the glasses is too weak to pick up the signal. The chess players look a little cartoonish due to their distance and the issues he’s had with signal to noise ratios and resolution. When Tony looks at Steve, the scene resolves, and he can see the fine details of his personal assistant.
Tony had never been happier in Howard’s presence than at that moment. A moment that drifts away from him as he sits up on the cot in the middle of a cave in somewhere Afghanistan, his chest aching and his head pounding. He never did get to go on that Arctic Ocean trip. Howard went on a drinking binge and beat his mother and Tony. His mother packed their bags and they spent the next year in Italy until Howard came sniveling to her on bended knee. It happened that the company was in trouble and he desperately needed her money to fund it. The stock price had bottomed out. She was the only way to save the company. Maria and Tony.
“Now, you’re thinking this? Why not think that Schmidt is doing exactly as before. He wants to know me, I’m big news,” Tony says and even with the scarf over half his face, Steve can tell the man is smiling.
“There is no king or emperor of the Conclave. We are independent systems working together for the sake of all the peaceful regions of this universe. You’re not going to start this conversation with me again, do you understand?”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Just stop.” Okay he jumped to conclusions. “You can stop now.” He follows Thor out of the bathroom as his friend tosses himself around the room in faked anguish. “Just stop.”
This is Tony’s one chance, he crashes through the door and throws one of his Christmas decorations in the corner as Rumlow startles. He staggers away from Steve, who slides to the floor hitting the gun and taking it with him as he goes. Tony charges Rumlow with his gloved hand and grabs for the first thing he can think of – taking hold of Rumlow’s half hard penis and releasing the electrical jolt. Rumlow’s screeches and judders, then falls to the floor.
“What’s for breakfast?” Tony says and his chest aches. What he would do for some ibuprofen or a big bag of weed.
Those sweet memories of last night fade as he finishes getting ready for the day. He has to remember that because of what Natasha had done for Steve, he owes her to get his head back in the game and force his brain and heart to understand that he’s not in love. His body reacts to Tony – that’s all. It’s a good thing. He can do this. He nods, readies himself for the day, and steps out of the bathroom into the main quarters.
Heading toward his library, Tony tries to forget the worst of what happened and focus on the good. He should be preparing for the evening meal and the meetings to come. He needs to be on his best game, but he’s irked and he needs something to mellow his brain. Going to the workshop is his best option. He tugs off his formal jacket, hangs it on the back of a chair, and slides a stool over to the bench. He picks up some of the latest designs of the arc oscillator and studies it, but he’s failing miserably. He only wants to think about his omega.
Steve shrugs. “Well, maybe I was comparing it to Star Trek. I’d watched a bunch of those with Sam and Natasha already. A few with Clint, too.”
“Yes, it is. This isn’t something you should play around with Tony. Seizures can sometimes lead to brain damage-.”
Yanking at him, Steve had tried to pull Bucky away from the window. “Please, damn it, Buck. He’s not hurting me.”
His father snapped back. “Then tell them I can’t do it. I’m not Erskine. They want a formula I don’t have. Erskine’s notes are gibberish!”
“Let me and the pack horse go first, don’t tug on the reins. Let her watch the horse in front of her and follow. Sway with it, let your body follow the horse’s motion.”
Sam offered his hand when Tony didn’t accept the offer, he only shrugged. The refusal hadn’t changed the man’s demeanor at all. He said, “Nice to meet you.”
“No?” Thor staggers back. He turns his back on Steve. “But what of last night. Your warm arms. How can I go on?”
As their energies matched, Steve shuddered and pushed against Tony. For a second Tony thought that Steve might be trying to get away, but he only wanted more. Tony added another finger and shortly a third. Steve pumped against him, his cock thick and heavy against his belly. When he reached for it, Tony grasped his hand and together they stroked him. The rhythm of their hands together echoed the pulsing of their souls. It felt so damned good. Tony had a hard time remembering that this was just a dream, a fantasy, a wish.
Tiberius glowers at Steve. “Commander, Tony convinced me that it had to be you as a bodyguard, and that it had to be the Howling Commando to transport us, don’t disappoint me.”
Sam stared at him a moment longer, not moving and then it hit him. A smile spread across his face and he reached over to slap Steve on the knee. “Well, hot damn, you got it good.”
“Okay,” Steve mumbles and cannot help it that he’s hauled to Tony’s bedroom again, that his clothes come off far too easily, that he’s on his knees, between Tony’s legs, mouthing his cock.
If the lack of basic necessities didn’t mean death for a prisoner, the Raiders and Regulators might be the next to sentence a man to death. He’d interfered with the gangs, tried to stop the carnage and all he received in return had been a report to their captors. A peacemaker was not welcome at the prison camp.
“You didn’t finish?” Tony concluded. They walked the long block in the dark. The street lamps were insufficient to guide their way.
“Okay you want to ride with me. You could have just asked,” Steve says and shivers. His wet clothes are becoming stiff from freezing in the cold weather. He staggers over to Shield. It takes all of his strength but he’s able to maneuver Tony onto the horse. “Stay, don’t fall off. Hold onto the saddle.” He places Tony’s hand on the horn of the saddle.
“He is grown and willful.” Thor slams his mug down on the table upsetting some of the coffee pot but not enough to tip it over before Steve steadies it.
She reached over and clasped his hand, brushed a finger along his wrist soul mark. “Some times you need to let the leader go and allow us to be your pack. It’s not just about protecting us, Steve. You know that. Let us in. I can feel you pulling away.”
“Sometimes you have to jump right in or else you’ll never move,” Steve said, and he dropped to his knees in front of Tony. Steve leaned into him as Tony rested back on the couch. Tony cupped Steve’s face in his hands.
“Excuse me?” Steve said and, though he wasn’t dizzy the room oscillated, and he needed to swallow several times. He closed his eyes and covered his face with his hands. Maybe he was dead. Maybe he’d never left the room in the Triskelion. Maybe they’d finally electrocuted him to death. His mind was making things up. A teenaged girl thought she was Steve’s doctor.
Tony hears the radio with its static laced music fill the diner. It’s a small place, Tony can tell because of the acoustics. He always had a good ear, his mother taught him piano as a youngster and he took to it easily enough, though it couldn’t hold his attention much to her chagrin. The place isn’t full to capacity, Tony can tell due to the clank of silver ware and the muted sounds of chatting. “Small place, not a lot of people here. You come here often?” Internally he hisses at the cheap pick up line.
Coulson put his mug down on the workshop table, stuffed his hands in his pockets, and shrugged. “I’d rather not. I’d rather you take a look. They’re sending me because I’m a big fan of his, but I truly don’t believe it would impress him all that much. Now you, you might impress him, you might bring him back.”
Steve only shook his head. He had no idea. The last time he’d touched their marks together, it had been to help Tony heal. Nothing like this at all had happened.
Gripping the rail to the stair case, Steve says, “I’m going up for a quick nap, you watch the shop?” Bucky knows Steve doesn’t sleep well – neither of them do really considering the memories they have to haunt them from the war.
Tony could end it here and now. He didn’t have to be tied to this. Hell, he could call Iron Legion to him.  He wouldn’t though because that was insane and while Tony might live on the edge of sanity at times, he always ended up doing the right thing. Or at least he tried. “I’m not sure I can do this.” As he said it Tony realized he echoed what Steve had some last night in his dreams.
Steve nearly punches her, but Tony puts up his hands and smiles for the camera. He’s so attuned to the landscape around him he gets it right where he should be facing without the slightest direction from Steve.
“Steve, you can’t do this. You can’t. You do this, what will everyone think about Captain America? You can’t. You have a responsibility.”
Reaching for the water, Steve thanks her and sips it as she places the tray on the mobile table. She tries to offer him the crackers again but he refuses.
“I’m not talking about physical training,” Steve said. He looked at Tony and then scanned the rest of the team. “We’re a soul pack and we need to start acting like it. Tony has been able to manipulate the astral energies and I think we could do more of it. If we practice.”
“We’re the Avengers, an initiative to protect the world. You don’t think that’s important enough to bond with all of the members and put away your ideas of being a hero for a nebulous organization?” Tony tilted his head and waited, as if his argument couldn’t possibly be destroyed.
“As far as I can tell. Don’t worry; the nurses at Aunt Peggy’s house were able to get her to settle down-.”
“That bad, huh?” he says and allows Coulson to direct him to the small administrative offices of the docking bay.
Hope you enjoyed the fun in this chapter. The twists are starting to add up - what do you think is going to happen?? This is truly a fusion of Pretty Woman and MCU and SPACE!!!
Possibly a bad sign, but Steve refrains from mentioning it. Tearing down the fire blanket, Steve rolls it up and stuffs it into his overburden pack. The blustery wind hits him full in the face. He gasps as he talks. “Any-anything else?”
“No. No I wasn’t. I was reporting myself,” Steve says. His eyes tear. Tony gulps for air but can’t gather his thoughts to reply. Steve doesn’t seem to notice. “I wanted him to know, before he started all the pre-experiment research and testing. I wanted him to know who I was. That maybe he was picking the wrong person.”
“Maybe,” Steve said. “Not sure.” He got the hoody off as he drove toward Sam’s place.. The woman saw them stealing the truck, so how long they would be able to drive around without being detected was a gamble.
Tony watches from a far, his lips slightly parted, his eyes glistening and intense. Standing nearly at the shoreline, Tony gives Steve a wide berth. The water cradles Steve, lifts the weight of his newly sprung and healing wings from his back and he luxuriates in the feel of the water warm, yet offering a refuge from the stirring heat of the day. His wings unfurl further and he feels the ease and breath of them. He flaps them against the water’s surface and the glorious feeling of flight surges through him, as if he could take off at this moment.  He loses the splints as he moves as the need to fly comes over him. But he cannot, his wings are still far from healed. He settles back into the ocean and urges Tony to come closer.
This room is nothing like the prince’s quarters. The laboratory gleams bright and clean all the way up to the rafters. Steve drifts into the room, staring upward at the gantry and the support struts. It’s a marvel and Steve has to remember to close his mouth at the sight. Holographs illuminate the room with interfaces and schematics of things that befuddle him. It mesmerizes and captivates.
“Only if you want to?” Steve opens the oven and brings out the three loaves of bread he’s made. He doesn’t look at Tony again. He busies himself with the dinner preparations. “I just thought with the storm still raging, it might be nice to have to feel of the fire close.”
Pulling out his phone, he presses on her contact. In short order she answers, “Stark, you can’t even make it two hours.”
Before him a universe of stars linking up like neural networks appeared. It sparkled over them, a canopy of lights. Steve leaned back, gazing at the holographic lights. His lips parted slightly as he whispered wow. “What’s that?” He pointed to a conglomerate of stars.
Tony winks. “Because everyone thinks about the Caribbean when you talk about private islands. Sure, I have one down there, but I prefer the quiet one up in the Northern Atlantic in the summer. You’ll see.”
“Wounds?” Sam scrunched up his features and then flinched as the memories must have collided in his consciousness. He dropped back down on the table, closing his eyes and pushing the heels of his hands into them. “Gone crazy. The whole fucking country. Shit. I thought I was dead.”
Steven bows his head and crawls up to Tony’s side, slipping beneath the blankets and spooning up behind him. “Is this what you want or would you like me to be across the bed, not touching you?”
“I’m not even sure where they came from,” Steve says as he throws his toothbrush back in the bathroom and then joins Thor in the kitchen.
Bruce drags a knotted clump of wires closer and puts on his glasses. “I didn’t say you didn’t. This is your line of reasoning.”
“That’s not any of your business.” Steve cringes. That’s as much as admitting his feelings for Tony.
Natasha demanded entrance and he almost said no, but it was Pepper who smiled at him on that spring morning in late March telling him that he couldn’t avoid the consequences of his past. It ruffled him a bit to hear her put it like that – she didn’t like Iron Man, she didn’t like the danger it put him in and he could understand it, but still Iron Man felt like an integral part of who he would always be. It wasn’t something to be ashamed of.
Steve stopped him. “It’s not Cap asking. It’s Steve Rogers, the kid from Brooklyn with an attitude.”
Steve pulls out his phone and checks the time. “Go. Call Rhodes or Pepper. We need to know what to do in an emergency.”
, but this – with Steve – to Tony felt different, special, and in some freakishly nerdy way – precious. The best part was – Tony didn’t mind, he liked it – a lot. Red alert flags went up. He liked it too much. What if Steve didn’t want it, what if he rejected Tony. Fuck, maybe he needed a drink.
Steve lifted Tony’s head gently from his shoulder, cupping his jaw. “I’m never leaving you. That’s not what this is.”
“Let me get out of these wet clothes. Take a shower and I’ll be down. Okay?” Steve stands and puts his gloved hands on his hips.
Time passes they spend a lifetime together in only a few years. They battle together; they win together; they lose together. They never leave each other’s sides.
“Yeah, that happens,” Logan says and steps down into the living room. The way he walks down the few stairs teeters on falling but he’s always in control. That much is clear. “He had a seizure or slept for two days once. He’s not well.”
Of course the Elders of Shield might want to off him, but he doubts it. They have their own little piece of the pie. They control a huge portion of the economy of the Council of Worlds.
As if it’s too much to accept, Tony wavers and Steve catches him, leading him to the massive bed. Before Tony responds to his insistent push to settle on the bed, he turns and shakes his head. “I didn’t expect. I didn’t use the nanites. I’m not prepped. I almost never use-.”
“So he’s your bait to figure this shit out?” Tony asked. He regretted inviting her into his house. This was his safe haven, a place out of time and space for his time with Steve. Having her here and the rest of the coven dirtied it.
“Unfortunately, the Murray sisters don’t have a brother,” Steve replied and tapped the bar. The bartender responded by refilling their drinks.
“Oh I doubt that very sincerely, Captain,” Tony whispers and runs his hands through Steve’s hair. “You have that kind of blonde hair that gets like barley in the summer and dishwater in the winter.”
“Oh it’s Steve all right, but not really Steve,” Sam piped in. “This is a distraction. He’s trying to get us to leave him, get mad at him. Abandon him.”
“Get me some food and lots of it. Also a stunner, just in case.” Tony taps the frame of his glasses and slips them off. “Food is coming. Plus I’m going to shock you if you even attempt to assault me. I’m going to put it on the highest setting. It could kill you.”
Tony drapes the cloth on Steve’s forehead and disappears. It’s bright in the room and there must be a window open. He can hear the play of the ocean waves against the shore. Tony emerges from a door to the side of the room and brings a glass of water with him. He helps Steve sit up and his wings tremble.
The room is much like he last saw it, but the desk is littered with papers. He supposes that Steve must have brought some Avenger paperwork with him. He’s always been a stickler for reports. He goes to the lounge and retrieves his tablet but slows in front of the desk. He pauses – stopping to look. He knows he shouldn’t look. This is Steve’s private room. It’s an invasion of privacy and they just started a relationship that they both professed to be honest with each other. Something strikes him and he can’t help but look.
“Steve.” Tony hates to say it, but they need to stop the charade – at least in the mansion. “You don’t have to pretend, you know. You’re free to do whatever you want to do. You don’t have to stay cooped up here all the time.”
The words echoed in the large domed room. As he looked up to see a bald woman with milky white eyes and arthritic fingers standing next to the table. Dust motes float around her. “Excuse me?”
“It’s well fortified. Outposts here, here, and here. Nothing on this ridge as far as we can tell, but the mountain isn’t scalable so that might not be a way to go,” Maria said.
When Tony wakes up his eyes ache and he rolls over onto his stomach, realizing he never got out of his clothes. His teeth feel like they have a layer of guck on them. He groans and makes it to his feet, heading to his small ensuite. He sloughs off his clothes and gets into the small shower. The routine of the shower not only serves to wake him up but also allows him some perspective. Steve’s dealing with Barnes’ situation and his own sexuality on top of living a life he never planned. Sure, it’s been years since he thawed out, but everything keeps changing for him. That can’t be easily. Tony knows for a fact it isn’t. Maybe give him a break?
