He looks up at me with reservation, and crosses his malnourished arms across his chest. His 'shield' maneuver.
I genuinely smile at her this time.
''What?!''
''They just gave me antibiotics,'' and I frown at her, not knowing where this is going.
''It's consumption,'' I hold out my hands, palms up. Stare at them. Studying the ridges, the lines of creasing. Like a map. Like a highway. If you're on a road you don't like, you could just drive off onto a different road. But not when the road and the map is your body. When all of it is you.
''What do you want me to do? Ignore this? Pretend nothing is happening?''
''It's getting late, it's getting dark. At the end of the night, I can feel your heart.'' - Zola Jesus
Thanks again for the lovely and supportive reviews on chapter 41. You guys are the best.
A flash of hurt plays across his features.
''Nudge over,'' I command him, which - also miraculously – he does.
Just close your mouth and stop screwing up with every breath you take.
''Okay,'' I whisper.
John smiles and deposits 13 other cans into the cart.
''Of course he left. He wanted sex, and I hated it, and he thought I didn't care for him. I wouldn't 'put out' as much as he wanted, and-''
He had zeroed in on an issue I hadn't even brought up, and it happened like this:
“Ideally things like a DEXA scan – to determine current bone health and to reassess bone health and density as you progress. It will make a difference when calculating your target weight with greater accuracy as well as creating a more complete profile of health risks and relative strengths.”
Seeing significance in arbitrary numbers? Arbitrary things?
''For god's sake, John! That little kid is terrified, and he needs to talk to me. Now, apparently. And I don't care who gets that. The point is - I get that - and I'm going. Right this second!''
I trail Donovan to the break room, and she gives me a look - more sad than angry - before turning and leaving. Through the slightly frosted glass, I can see Sherlock's tousled hair and long neck. He's bundled up in his coat, and the rain-patterned glass is giving the impression that all his body is weeping.
So I'd rather play with his emotions than I would with his life.
''Okay. No John.''
Sat down on the floor. Muffled a cry because it hurt to sit on my bum.
Mycroft never drops any issue he feels is of seriousness, and nothing could be much more serious than what happened to Sherlock.
John takes a deeper breath, before running his hands through his hair.
I meet her eyes.
''1979,'' he mumbles in an odd tone. ''This was in 1979.''
Then the image before me solidifies into something understandable. I finally see.
''You're being selfish,'' I had gritted out to him in disarming vexation after Lestrade had left the room, equally incredulous.
I have witnessed him flinch before, too. When my voice rose, or on occasions when I seemed especially aggravated with him.
And they never bothered to ever bloody look. Not really. So I can't help it. I can't stop the words from bubbling out of my throat.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''So, it's done. For you. You aren't on an active case right now.''
And it should hardly matter. He's Sherlock's older brother. He should go to bat for his younger brother. He should be mad at me. But it still unnerves me. Heck, why do I feel this way? I feel like I backed over some kid's puppy with a car.
Because I never did. Think of myself as smart, that is.
One person shouldn't direct all their concern and focus on another. It's so overwhelming for the person of that focus, and too draining for the person cultivating that concern.
''Sherlock! Stop it! I need to clarify this with you-''
''I'm not anyone!''
My furtive glances. Trying to offer her little smiles that I knew still solved absolutely nothing.
It's never just the case that someone doesn't eat enough because they have a stomachache, or because they feel unwell. That does happen, of course. Physical reasons aside are legitimate, but readily addressed. Help is readily addressed. And a degree of fear is shown as to their weakening state when someone is otherwise psychologically healthy.
In our (admittedly) truncated therapy session together, I even got to witness the rapidity of his speech; his jumbled, frenzied way of speaking when upset. So, too, can I sense the pressure behind his writing as he races about with words and posts on his webpage - expounding about this substance or that substance, this assay or that titration.
I don't begrudge his inability to get this; I don't even know how to articulate what I'm feeling, myself.
"You mean - when you were small? When you thought you were a ghost?"
An emotional war is just another type of war. I've been in battle before and I survived.
''What else?''
''Can I have a tissue, please?,'' I ask quickly, not meeting her eyes, and refusing to answer her previous question.
John gives me a closed-lipped smile.
''It doesn't have to be that stereotypically obvious. There is a range. Symptoms can encroach gradually, and worsen under stress. It could easily include or cover aspects of his behaviour that people have written off as Sherlock being merely eccentric. But he may be sicker than we previously suspected.''
Or possibly, you don't want her to think that you were the victim of sexual assault.
'Best not tonight. S is under 72 hour compulsory hold. No visitors.'
My flatmate blinks quickly, scratches his cheek.
I take a breath, and determine the best course of action before proceeding.
I'm starting to realize that this is the likely reason why.
I am home with John.
In fact, for a good number of my patients the act of physical self-harm is psychologically soothing to them. They feel so completely conflicted as to their own worth as beings, that their worth is assigned to the acknowledgment or applause of others. Then, when that is withheld for whatever reason - the festering, damaged part of their self comes to the fore and convinces them that they can at least punish themselves (through bodily abuse) for their lack of success. For their lack of meaning, or ''worth.''
''Do you honestly believe that?,'' I ask, trying to keep the incredulity out of my voice. Because - could he really believe that? Is it possible that he could really be that far in denial?
Not my little voice, in my nightmares, that shouts out small clamorous cries for someone.
''No, I won't go away. I will stay right with you. I will not abandon you.''
Mycroft has pulled back a bit and has come to take the far end of the sofa that I now occupy. He's not looking at either myself, nor Sherlock, and he's equidistant to both myself and his brother.
''I don't need to look at the-,'' he murmurs.
I don't cry anymore. I can't.
The next kiss is longer and fuller. It's not quite as chaste, but it's also not racy. There is a definite romantic intensity, connection, feeling - that I haven't even felt with my sexual partners.
Sherlock's hands have grasped onto my wrists now and I can't help but take in how cold and clammy they are.
I want to fall asleep to this sound.
''Can I get you something to eat, then? Whatever you would like. My treat?''
''What is your concern right now, Sherlock? I can't do anything to help if you don't tell me.''
He licks his lips, and stills, hands worming their way into his pockets.
''When I was a child, it was a game,'' I state, feeling empty. A voice through the room, but no accompanying body. '''Don't wake Mycroft.' And I didn't, John. He'd sleep, and I had this power. And it was a good feeling. It made me feel good. The most observant person I knew, but I could do something like that and he couldn't see, couldn't hear, maybe couldn't even imagine it was a possibility. A blind spot.''
Certainly he knows that, too. Anytime I've said something that's wowed him - I don't think I minded the admiration.
Purse my lips. Note that they feel dry. Dessicated.
We step into a conference room. It's merely the four of us, which surprises me.
I suddenly find myself in front of a purple door, with a glass inlay in four different colours. The interior nightlight is causing beams of red, yellow, green and blue light to spill out into the hall, painting my body and the wall in various hued light.
Stress.
''Sherlock? It's okay. Just sit down.''
My throat is dry, and sore, and I wake up to the sense of constrictive pressure against my arms. A jostling, rushing presence.
''Why? It's done.''
So I call him. Once. Four times. Seven times.
''No, Sherlock - wait, it's okay, just wait- let's talk about this-''
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''And I know you won't want to, really, but I hope you'll tell me what happened to your throat. If someone hurt you, they are not going to get away with it. But I won't force it out of you. I promise you that; I will try to pay more attention to how you feel. I'm sorry I didn't hear you well enough before. I am so sorry if I contributed to your pain, or your anxiety. If I made you feel worse in any way.''
''I will try,'' he relents at last.
''Try again,'' I say gently. ''Just take a breath and then hold it right now.''
Sherlock's breath hitches.
I step back, alarmed.
Salty, tangy.
I turn from my back and move up on the chesterfield. John continues to stand rigidly, unmoving.
And that's so much worse than hating me.
Wellness.
''John,'' he starts, ''what I've seen with Sherlock these past few days - with that little boy, and with the mother? That's not Sherlock handling emotions badly at all. That's him knowing exactly what to do and say to make everything just a bit less of a horror show for that little kid.''
''It's none of your business!,'' he screams at me, and the rapid change in volume and demeanor has me scrambling back in shock. ''It's nobody's fucking business! It's my body! I get to do with it as I please!''
''Sherlock? Are you hearing me?''
The walls are painted an eggshell white and a pale pink-purple orchid stands out impressively on a circular table in the center of the space, obviously well tended for and almost supernaturally large. My eyes next trail the walls and catch an assortment of classic dietician styled posters intermingled with art work. I catch sight of a sculpture, all lean lines and muted colours as if inspired from a da Vinci sketching.
''Sherlock,'' I test softly, ''I don't want to have you like that. I'm not going to hurt you. Please...stop it. Stop this.''
''You 'suggested'? What does that even mean?''
I feel my face flush with the realization that he's talking about *me.*
''I want to help you, Toby. But I can't do very much if you won't speak to me at all.''
I look up in surprise then. ''I have tried, John.''
A little chrome plug-in kettle sits on a rotating disc, surrounded by a wooden container housing various green and white teas. I pick up one from the offering pile, and take the tea bag back with me as I sit down again in the waiting room chair, smelling the scent of jasmine as if the bag is a talisman meant to ward off evil.
His hands, suddenly, seem to tremble and when I glance up to his face, I can see that his mouth is trembling, too.
''You honestly believe that,'' he whispers, as if uncomprehending.
And who could blame him? If sex by force was the expectation - his very reality - even before he'd have a concept of what sex was supposed to mean to couple in a consensual sense - then certainly romance would seem foreign. A media construction to make movies seem poignant, perhaps. A falsity. The interplay and the words that adults use when considering a potential sexual partner might even seem abhorrent to him growing up with the views that must have solidified at a tragically young age. As a bloody toddler, really.
My exhalation is harsh. Strident.
(Opening your eyes won't change what John is going to do. Or change his ability to move closer to you).
''Oh, he's good at covering for it, John. But his mind works differently than ours, and I guess I knew he needed the help.''
----------------------------------------------------------
''I'm sure he doesn't! We expect too much from him, Mycroft! He's not all-seeing, all-knowing and neither are you! Just tell him!''
No one normal or sane wants to hurt. But I want to hurt...and...I don't want to hurt. I straddle both states of want and need simultaneously, and cannot find the words to express the complexity of living in my mind or of living with those thoughts. Additionally, I don't know how to tie that part down long enough so I can study it.
never, never, never, never.
''I don't have an issue with what you said, Sherlock. What you said you felt. I-I am glad you told me.''
Mock me for being weak, for being stupid, and then my form feels large and wasted all at the same time.
All I've done is rinse off.
''But not all of those cuts were old Sherlock, were they? We found quite a few recent cuts. No more than a few days old, by my estimate.''
''You're sick,'' I say, and my voice dries out. ''And I don't just mean that you have a duodenal ulcer. I think you know what I mean.''
''It's not a big deal.''
"Why?," I gasp. "What happened when he was 13?"
John is sitting on the corner edge of my bed and places the tomato soup to the side.
Even though they were counting on you to save them.
I have the strongest desire to pull Sherlock close to me, and hug him.
I can do this.
Patrick just laughs and chucks a licorice jujube at my head. He has a boyish disposition that comes out in overt playfulness though he never fails to make me laugh when he sets his mind to it.
Sherlock is holding onto his belly as if it's a blanket. Or an amulet. He's squeezing the flesh like a kitten kneads against its mother - what thinned out flesh it happens to be in his case.
And no to what?
As he leaves, the lamps from the outside parking lot flitter over his frame, and for a brief nanosecond he is encased in white light.
Yuri frowns, exhales.
in love with him!
And then I get it: his mind palace. His profound ability to delete or retain information as it suits his emotional state. He's always seemed so capable of just disregarding what he didn't wish to recall; I used to consider it a cute quirk. I used to believe that it was his means of choosing what to study, what to discard. A time saving device, a memory aid. Little more than that.
One of the things I miss doing with regularity is getting coffee at the little neighbourhood cafes. The ones lined with old metal dining sets along the exterior. Little wooden signs proclaiming hours, and soft coloured curtains that pull closed towards the end of the day.
Nobody could be that callous.
But he doesn't know.
Nothing could be that simple with him, could it?
I jot down a few questions in my journal.
He was more than stable.
A rush of air is expunged.
Pale blue eyes, the colour of early winter frost, rise up and hold my own.
---------------------------
Must be raw-tired by now.
Just voices.
I'll lose my mind if I go back to the clinic.
''So the Tesco's thing was legitimate?''
Yeah.
Mrs. Thiesen is shaking her head back and forth quickly.
I'm being shaken. The Martian is shaking me.
''Please sit back down. Please, Sherlock.''
I met Patrick when we were 22 and I was completing my last undergrad year at University.
I pull back further away from him.
"I don't need any help, John! Not from you! Not from some bloody so-called professional! Nothing is the matter with me!," and the snarl comes out all on its own.
''No. I don't want to do that,'' his utters so quietly, he's barely audible.
''Like someone has run over my innards with a lawnmower.''
I nod, slowly, knowing that I am caught. Knowing that lying will make it worse.
On that point, John does make sense.
"He loved Mycroft. He loved Mycroft properly. So did Mummy. Don't you see, John? Mycroft was planned, and he was proper. He was supposed to be here. They actually had to try for an entire year to have him! I was not supposed to be here. I never should have been here at all. I was the biggest mistake of our mother's life and the biggest shame of the entire Holmes' family."
Sherlock flinches. Actually flinches. Hesitates, and Yuri waits.
Then her arms are at my sides, holding me still. The entire Yard is staring, I am sure - and I push at her arms with my hands.
And being afraid of a physician in charge of his care.
He arched his hands down, as if needing the pressure of the table top. Pressed until he left smudgy damp spots - imprints - of his palms against the Formica.
The question so bare-bones, so in-his-face, that it leaves little room for Sherlock to hide. It leaves no room for shelter in words and meandering thoughts and displaced ideas. It's too blunt for that.
This time I ignore his words.
''No! You have no right to mock me about this!''
''You both want me to eat like everyone else, and sleep and talk and act like everyone else and-''
''Of course I screwed up! I know I did!,'' and then Sherlock stands up too quickly, dislodging his green house coat.
"That's the thing, though, Sherlock. You don't work off feelings. Certainly not exclusively. This case has been about leaps and jumps and intuition - and for you, that's strange. And you found this boy, and you found him when it counted, and we got to him in time, yes - but what do you have to support your suppositions?," Lestrade tries again, his eyes scanning my face - back and forth, back and forth.
''It hardly matters to me who you have sex with,'' he grumbles, suddenly putting his teacup back on its saucer with a slam.
He looks almost dejected, though the expression doesn't make sense given the way I am attempting to interact with him.
I should push John away; get him to leave.
''Mmm,'' I say in response. ''I think we should.''
Molly doesn't speak. Just puts her own cup back down on the coffee table.
''What made you stop?,'' I inquire, gingerly.
One striped sock peaks out from beneath Sherlock's trousers. They are off-white with grey lines. I didn't even know he owned anything with stripes on it in the first place.
He comes closer then, holds up a finger.
Two sugars, my ass.
''Teacup for you, then,'' I mutter amicably, and he takes the cup, and deposits it on the counter near his bed. He's since removed his green jumper and is back to just his pajama top now. Pajama top, and jeans - given that the rest of his stuff is still downstairs. He tugs at the edge of the top as if wanting to tie the stash, even though he's not wearing a gown at all. A holdover tic-like behaviour, perhaps. Something comforting.
Author's notes: I will be trying to write 500 to 1000 words a day. I generally get into a certain momentum when writing and I don't like to have the momentum disrupted, otherwise I notice that my writing suffers for it. The flow of the story is impacted.
If he’s heard me, he doesn’t reply - simply turns inwards until his face is nestled between the throw cushions, his lithe form starting to relax in the cool darkness of the space.
''I hadn't been able-,'' and he stops and takes a big breath, fresh tears wetting his eyes. So he shuts them, ''I had forgotten how I tried to rationalize it.''
Another word I hate.
''No,'' I say stiffly. ''When I was in clinic just a few weeks back. You were there when Dr. Riley pulled that stunt - remember? Well, after you left, another doctor came to speak with me. He was...okay.''
------------------------------------------
''Let myself?,'' I ask harshly, turning with a flourish. ''What is that supposed to mean?''
Not arousal. Something else. Something fuller than that.
My stomach is revolting from the sudden increase of pressure from food and drink, and I remind myself that I can not eat starches and get them up easily. Milk, ice cream, soup. Liquids, yes. Bread and crisps and food that clumps together in my belly? Much harder to void.
I close my eyes, press my hands against my thighs and take a deep breath.
"You absolutely need to, is that right?"
He's not denying the obvious but he's also refusing to treat Sherlock as weak.
Then I walk back to the fridge and find more magnets so that I can put the photo up in plain sight.
''You're definitely not drunk. I wouldn't kiss you if you were drunk.''
Suddenly he's pushing past me, trying to exit the room, and I maneuver to block his retreat. If I don't clarify some things right now, he's not likely to let me ever clarify them. He'll assume I think certain things about him that I don't actually think or feel. And our relationship will fester with those assumptions.
He's always seemed angry at Mycroft.
''I al-almost killed myself,'' he stammers, at long last. ''I should feel ashamed. I hurt you, and I hurt Mycroft. How can you even stand to look at me right now?''
But another part of me feels extremely protective of Sherlock's emotions, and his right to privacy.
''Do you want any cream or sugar for your tea?,'' she asks gently. ''I also have milk.''
"I don't get it. I really don't get it. Your behaviour has been-," I speak in low tones, inspecting the skin, and getting a butterfly bandage ready for application. As gently as possibly, I press the cotton to the wound and Sherlock sucks in his breath quickly, as if shocked by the sting of the peroxide. "Too shallow for stitches, so no hospital," I mutter. "It should stop bleeding soon."
"Mycroft was still at home," he adds a moment later. "He left for school, abroad, shortly before he turned 11 and a half, so I couldn't have been much older than three when it began."
''I know you love me,'' he whispers, breaking my stream of consciousness into fragmented pieces. ''I know you can help me.''
He looks at me with unconstrained intensity.
He bursts into tears.
He rises, then trots over to me.
'Paranoia may be a feature.'
Sherlock angles his head, and I know what it is: a defensive position. Not overtly defensive, but protective all the same. Protective to not let the pleasure splay across his features. Protective to not let me know how much the soft attentions of a rescue cat mean to him.
I can respect the fact that Yuri doesn't employ typical niceties by writing that everything is ''fine'' – and then I rise, turn on the lights, and hurriedly busy myself with covering the red leather bound book under a mound of papers and magazines. It feels safer to gloss over the unsettling works with innocuous things like New Scientist – than to let them stand out in prominent space.
I even start to make motion towards the macabre set of smiling bone when I hear the measured, if not calibrated voice of Mycroft swell back into the room. Sherlock once described his brother's voice as being 'marmalade and black smoke,' and at the time I had no idea what that even meant, but now that I consider it, I think I do. Mycroft is polite, almost old-fashioned in his precision and focus on manners, and yet put him a tough position where his stress is high and you won't see anger or fear or stress always play out on his face.
''No. You can't look away from this. Look at this report, Sherlock.''
I run my hands through my hair, exasperated.
''It's too dark,'' he cried, plaintively. ''I want- I want,'' he garbled, probably not really knowing what he wanted at all.
''Let's go, John!,'' Sherlock responds hotly now, turning on his heel, his boots already laced.
''Awww, come on. Stop doing this to yourself,'' and I turned him away from his corner of the sofa, wrapped him up with the rest of the throw. His face was streaked with tears and he pinched at his nose.
It takes about three minutes before I can bring anything up. When I do, I see the food I last ate come up first. Bits of mushroom and tomato sauce, chunks of neon-orange plastic cheese.
That he's not a sociopath. Nor is he damaged in any way.
''He did,'' I concede. ''Mycroft did. Speak to me, I mean.''
''Yes, you did,'' and I give him what I hope is an encouraging smile. ''But how was that wrong, exactly?''
Emery is 62 and he works at The Priory. He's worked there since his residency days, back in 1984.
''Can we talk?,'' I usher a little less forcefully. His hair is unbrushed and his eyes are cast in dark circles. He's also wearing goggles, and rubber kitchen gloves.
''For everything. For not judging me. Not once. For never making me feel out of place,'' he says in a breathless rush. ''And not taking my...callousness personally. Which it never was, by the way. I just - I think I pushed you away for a bit there, because I did like you. Not, you know - romantically - but-''
John's gentleness makes me want to cover my eyes with my hands and hide myself.
I gave him a terse smile. Truncated. Forced.
''Right. Well, he seemed unduly interested in talking to me. I take it, in some capacity you've mentioned me. Even just my first name?''
'Young man.'
Molly is finishing up when I rise to take her plate.
I don't sleep.
"She told me that she said that "making a baby" doesn't hurt. That it's only something adults do when they want to have a child, and that there is nothing bad about it."
For his inability to beat off this demon that has sunk its claws into his mind.
I glanced in the direction of the can, now half empty.
--------------
John's voice has taken on an edge, though. A tightness. I can hear the elevated frequency indicating upset.
"I don't think that's entirely true," I try, carefully.
But the man continued on silently for the next few minutes, as if my query had gone unheard. Suddenly, as we neared what could only have been his dormitory building, he looked off towards a grove of trees in the next courtyard and proclaimed, ''Sherlock. My name is Sherlock Holmes. And I, um, I read Chemistry.''
''I doan wantto disturb him,'' he mumbles, his stress much more apparent now. He's likely been skirting his ability to cope with his issues for a long time now.
''Don't seem what? Or seem what, as I know you really mean. So, say it. I seem like 'what'?''
''Are you being intentionally dense?,'' my voice grits like steel.
''Near enough.''
When the phone rings, I rush to it, eager to get out of the chokingly, now over-bleached bathroom.
''Fuck you, John,'' he says in contempt, before racing from the room.
''Sherlock was not deemed a danger to anyone else.''
It might not seem like the right time, especially as he's still so scared - and obviously still so sick - but he's trying to show the complexity of what's happening to him. Not just what's happening in his mind, not just how he feels emotionally about me - but physically how he might feel, too.
''Dr. Barrett is a beast,'' he gets out. ''I'd never forget his face.''
I smirk at the napkin, and push that off to the side, too.
I was a scientist, and as such - I only came into my own being, fully and with open interest, once I left the tiresome hurt of my childhood in the past.
And there it is, in a grubby red leather-bound tome: words, and even worse – images: a newborn with bruises covering her body, and on the next page – an older child, but not older by much – staring vacantly in my direction in stark black and white.
I-AM-SAD
When I finally gather the strength to look at my flatmate, I realize he looks bizarrely thrown by my admission. Almost frightened. He's shifting about on the balls of his feet as if he's ready to run.
"Why couldn't you stop, Sherlock? Tell me," and he wants to know, and he wants me to trust him, and I don't know what will make it go away.
“Yeah,” he sighs, “I know.”
''You're to have it, if you need it. Yuri wanted you to feel calm enough to attend sessions. He felt that given what has happened, how hopeless-,''
I close my eyes to contain my anger.
Sherlock's seen the worst of a person brought out for nothing more than willful delight in carnality. Between a parent and a child. And he was that child.
My eyes scan the pages, looking for some sort of connection.
''Victor didn't 'do' anything to me,'' I murmur, voice-low. Mostly spoken in my head, with very little exiting my mouth. ''I did it all to myself.''
''You said that,'' he says plaintively. ''Why did you say it?''
"He's at home! And he's feeling all this shame, right now! Someone should be with him!"
Realize that I'm torn between envy and an unnameable, swirling mass of emotion.
But he never says anything to the Martian.
“You’d be so hot if you were a time lord, Yuri,” he says in absent-minded affection before returning to his program. “You sort of have that whole, umm, nerdy librarian look going on anyway. But that could be upgraded into something utterly adorable with a bow-tie.”
Because everything feels too intensely while simultaneously feeling unreal.
He rushes out of the room and up the stairs. I can hear the rapid, light pattering of his feet and the swift, shlock of his door shutting behind.
"Perhaps the best thing is to just proceed...as normally as possible? And, since you are obviously exhausted - an early bed? No 3 am violin sessions, perhaps?"
"No, no, no John. You've got it all wrong. Mycroft was loved. Adored. No one ever laid a finger on him."
''Okay,'' I breathe, ''but we are staying in this room. Together. You are not going to be alone right now, do you understand?''
It would look odd and something worthy of yet another diagnosis.
-------------------------------------------------
I don't think he's talking directly to me any longer, and I stay perfectly still, not wanting to worsen John's tirade.
''It seems more removed,'' he says with a noticeable shake in his voice. ''The only option out of an array of options that I could live with, really.''
There it stands: a floral-print bowl filled to the brim with minestrone soup. Beside it, a diagonally cut grilled cheese sandwich on rye. He's even sliced a deli pickle and offset it slightly.
His lithe body, lanky and frail, is trembling now. His hands shake.
===========================
I-CANT-CRY
''Yuri thinks I have an attachment disorder!,'' he rasps, then glances at me, cursorily. His eyes are like X-rays. ''But you already knew that, didn't you, John? That's why you tried to cover up your discovery with mail order science circulations! As if that would throw me off track!''
''Yuri? What-,''
''Liquid courage,'' I supply. I had consumed a bit of brandy when I had texted him.
But I don't regret it one bit.
I put down the report, trying to keep my hands from clenching in either anxiety or anger. Or both, I'm not really sure.
It takes me a moment to realize exactly what I'm feeling.
I scan Sherlock's medical file in detail as Dr. Rouse continues to speak.
Something's happened, and as Sherlock glides to the door and moves out of my line of sight, I turn to the psychiatrist in question, confused.
My skin suddenly prickles.
''Oh, I see! He was a child, but even so - you couldn't treat him! Couldn't save him! So you want to blame him for his own tragic death, is that it?''
-----------------------
"It probably will just have to be something we navigate together. But later - not now. Right now I just want you focused on getting healthier.''
''If you are going to stop hurting yourself, you can get rid of the scale in your bedroom, for starters.''
''Both,'' I admit. ''The latter is making me more agitated about the former.''
Don't feel it. Don't feel it.
I need to get a grip.
''Hmm?,'' I nudge him gently.
Of course, by physical I meant sexual. Not careful touches meant to show concern or tenderness.
Which is a horrible thing to think, now. To realize I did wonder if there was something so unmovable within him that the harshest words and the most dire attacks would leave him more or less unaffected.
''Yes, my constitution!,'' he exclaims, ''I have a bleeding ulcer, Yuri. I can't just eat anything.''
''How does that help anything? You're not going to be my nutritionist,'' he says sullenly.
Even more obvious is the fact that I am the man he's looking for; my room is a single.
I always feel better after a shower.
What I find is a scale.
''That can hardly be a fair exchange,'' I say evenly, feeling momentarily distracted from my thoughts. My hissing, buzzing thoughts.
But I give him a brief smile of my own, then saddle on over to a circular Formica table, revelling in the screech of the plastic chair as it grates against the floor.
Petrified.
And how do ordinary people who have experienced trauma do this? How do they attempt to survey their emotional world – swirling with red and black and filled with a sharpness akin to the cut of glass or something awful like cloying pressure and a strangling ache – and separate the distinct emotions? How do they do it?
"Does he know that someone is coming to talk to him?," John queries.
Sherlock closes his eyes.
''I'm not that bad yet,'' he reiterates, and my musings shift and re-orient on our present. Us together, us together on the tube. The two of us, in now-time. Sherlock, 113 lbs and 6 ft 1, wearing too many layers, but somehow seeming so much better in the course of only three days. A Tim Burton leanness. Unnatural, but his eyes. God, his eyes. Not hopeful enough in himself, but hope that he turns on me. His lips, no longer quite so cracked. Making eye contact. Furtive eye contact. But trying so damnably hard.
After a minute or two I stop vomiting, and proceed to pant against the bucket, still holding it against my mouth with both hands. Molly, in turn, has wrapped her arms around my middle, and the thought of her touching me at all - even in kindness - makes me pull my stomach up, suck it in. The revulsion and the knowledge of what I am doing hits me, and I vomit again, this time bringing up only bile. Dry retching.
"You didn't do anything wrong?," I repeat slowly, as if trying to ascertain that - yes, that's really what he's said. "You punched a man, Sherlock! A child's parent! For all intents and purposes - a victim in his own right. You broke his nose! There may be real consequences here! There may be charges - do you even understand that?"
I realize, sadly, that he has taken my earlier inability to respond as - what?
''Like you have any conception as to what he needs!''
"I was at the park. I didn't want to wake you up with the noise."
''Also, I-,''
Sherlock presses both of his palms against his legs. He looks up, seems to freeze, and then repeats the motion.
One little nick, and it's all over. You just tug on the wires in the forearms and expose them to air, and all this sadness could go away.
However, now in my rare display of idiocy I've really shot myself in the foot. Because who in their right mind cuts up their legs? Or anywhere else? That, to be sure, wasn't something I did more than once. It was truly a muscle memory response. My hand grasping the straight razor I kept in the bathroom, and bringing it down against my thigh - almost something non-present in my actions. An anger at how I had been acting around John in general, my vast departure from my normal emotional façade disrupted - and then a lulling calmness in the welling up of blood as it started to peal against my leg and run in rivulets down the side of my skin.
Everything else about him was muddled up in the foggy air, distorted in wisps of whiteness and etheriality; a ghost realm of things not quite real, not quite fathomable. Not a world of happening things, of reasonable possibility.
My face flushes, and I look about the room, trying to determine if I can hear John near the landing.
''I don't need your backhanded compliments, John,'' Sherlock replies, evenly. Coldly. ''You can say what you think you must say to me without having to wrap your words in fluff to make it more...palatable to me.''
----------------------------
''I'm sorry,'' I wheeze, ''I'm sorry, Sherlock. I'm just-'' and it's then that I realize that my right hand is tremulous, shaking.
I pat his hand once to confirm the suggestion.
Probably to make sure I don't drown myself.
''Well,'' I exhale. ''Perhaps I could ask you questions. And perhaps you could answer them more…scientifically? Or, not scientifically, exactly, but more a simple laying out of all salient points?''
I do not ask for further permission, and beyond that – I highly doubt Sherlock cares what we watch.
''Definite steps? Can you give me an example of a 'definite step'?''
And perhaps, deep down, it could make sense. But only from the perspective of one who considers someone in the trap of such behaviour to be subconsciously flirting with death. To be, perhaps, prone to suicidal ideation.
We walk the 15 blocks back to his flat side-by-side. I give him a playful glance when he stops and gets another beverage on the way home. I do not remind him that coffee is no substitute for dinner, since I am assuming that John is already overlooking most of Sherlock's meals.
Sherlock suddenly looked uncomfortable.
The blue of his irises is a storm cloud blue.
''You don't get to tell me what to do,'' he huffs indignantly, turning back to the wall with a flourish. ''Besides, I need to sleep. Toby's being released in a few days, and he still won't talk. I need to get him to talk, or he might be walking back into a snake pit and the person who hurt him again might have access to him a second time.''
''I love him,'' he mutters, the pink of his face merging into something more intense as redness swims into his cheeks.
''That's ...that's everything?'' The crease-line along his forehead hasn't softened.
------------------------------------
''Well, Sherlock?! Which one is it?''
When we get to the intake counter, we are informed that we should take a seat – as an appointment is running slightly late – and that we are to help ourselves to a cup of tea.
Instead of letting myself fidget, I command myself to take in the room.
''It's not...wrong, Sherlock. It's not.''
''Is there any more tea?,'' he asks suddenly, a second yawn breaking forward.
Part of me suddenly feels very, very uneasy.
“What’s inside you that anyone could possibly hate? Hmm?,” I question gently. “What is inside you that deserves to be hated?”
Largely because I pushed him on an issue he couldn't face yet. Because I couldn't see that he had reached his limit for what he could handle.
Sherlock studies the questions, stares at his glass of water. Nods.
''He'll be okay with that,'' John says ambiguously. ''I'm sure he'll be, eventually.''
''Let me put him back,'' Sherlock responded tightly, and he suddenly seemed uncomfortable as I turned the pages. A piece of onionskin paper fluttered to the floor and I picked it up.
I can't.
''Sherlock,'' I hiss. ''Answer the question.''
''I overdosed on cocaine,'' I say breezily, as if bored with the conversation.
''Victor!,'' Sherlock started, an edge of hysteria had crept back into his words. ''I don't know how to do this! I can't just have some form of 'benefits' arrangement with you. I can't think of you like that.''
I smirk anew, pleased that he's bypassed the chastising stage entirely.
But it doesn't mean I am happy about those changes, either.
I startle at that; I've had very few people in my life speak to me so formally. And never a shrink with even a modicum of respect.
He stops talking all at once, his mouth clamping down around his words.
''Yeah. I can figure things out, too. I'm clever that way.''
------------------------------------
Sherlock ponders my words.
-------------------------------
The child looks miserable. But he nods.
''Dr. Pascal's office. Marnie speaking,'' a woman says easily, softly. I wonder if there is some sort of school where they train secretaries who want to work in psychiatrists offices. Surely most people off the street don't naturally answer the phone like Marcy or Marnie or whatever her name answers the phone.
-------------
That I am weak.
If I feel this pressing need to lance this poison from my throat, then what is Sherlock dealing with?
Still, some things have improved. I have been granted access to an electric razor that I can use whenever I feel fit. So I wash my face, then lather up some shaving foam, and go at sprucing myself up for my upcoming appointment.
Sherlock's recent purchases stand out in sharp contrast to mine, and I can't help but think - 'there is nothing of substance here. No wonder he's lost weight.'
"I'll apologize if that's not the answer you want," he adds a moment later, his frown deepening.
“Umm. Yeah. You’re doing really well. You’re keeping on target. Why? Did you think that somehow you weren’t?”
She looks to the floor, looking spent. Looking beaten.
''You are sick. It's a disorder. With eating. Can you admit to that much?''
The blood whirls through my head, making me dizzy.
''Right,'' Sherlock says with mock conviction, a waver in his words. ''Everything is in order. Everything is fine. It is. I mostly don't want John to be so concerned.''
This kid is coming out of a mild coma. They are not going to sedate him with a concussion.
------------------------------------
And Yuri told me that it was common for those to experience what he referred to as secondary alexithymia during periods of intense psychological stress.
Sherlock cannot continue his charade much longer. Angst-wise, the end is, well, not nigh' - because he'll actually be getting help soon. And that's important. But he's going to start improving, slowly but surely, starting next chapter.
We do not talk as the taxi navigates the labyrinthine corridors. I do not tell the cabbie the best way to avoid congestion near the Jubilee line, or that construction is occurring near Westminster Bridge Rd.
''Toby?,'' Mrs. Thiesen asks sharply, her eyes narrowing. ''What's going on in here?''
Because I cannot conceive of a reality where Sherlock, in totality, wants to be sick. No one would truly want to feel so cold all the time, to have such abhorrent stomach pain, to pinch and measure and agonize over the growing or receding flesh of their body. That would not be a comfort. That would be a relentless agony. A burden for which, I have recently learned, is partially responsible for the relatively high degree of suicide amongst those suffering from long term eating disorders.
(god it's such a horrible fetid, pulsing mess.
"She wants to see if you can get him to talk. He hasn't said a word since he's awoken."
"I cannot stop my idiot brother from discussing matters with you if he is so inclined, but is it too much for me to request that you do not look at me as you are currently doing?"
Greg leans forward, slightly. A show of support, I guess.
At some point shortly thereafter, I close my eyes. My eyes are burning.
''You are going to listen to me for once,'' I say more calmly now. An order. A command. Deadly calm. ''And you are going to do what I say. Show me.''
It's not really a laugh.
Yuri frowns quickly, then schools his face into something more placid.
The dishes sit in the sink, doused in a covering of cold water and stale bubbles. The water is cloudy from cream and remnant bits of food.
''I wanted tohurtmyself,'' he interrupts in rushed tones, words blending together.
And it's not like I gave him something to hold onto, something that offered that same degree of comfort or security.
''Okay, well - did you make yourself some breakfast...or-?''
But is that true?
I finally put the coffee back onto the shelf, feeling attacked.
''There is this scene, where this young woman is engaging with a character in the novel called the 'first talking robot.' It's meant to be, essentially, an artificial intelligence. And so this young woman, a student, is trying to ascertain the whereabouts of a secondary robot. So she asks the talking robot-''
--------------------------------------------
That made it even worse. The knowledge that I had gotten somebody else emotionally invested in my tiresome little life.
I realize his breath is coming faster too, matching my own.
''Yes - yes he is,'' I replied, engrossed with the man's quick stride, purposeful, as he came over slightly at last.
that only i feel confused about
Sherlock, on the other hand, looks strange.
Realizing that even if I couldn't spell it with any certainty, I could know what resplendence felt like.
''Overcome?,'' he repeats, his tone angry. Almost mocking now. ''I thought you said there was nothing wrong with me?''
''You were just a baby,'' and he sits up, his limbs trembling, ''what sort of monster rapes a baby?''
I deposit myself into the nearby loveseat - the one that Sherlock usually takes.
Sherlock's face contorts, and he pants against my shoulder, ''I will fight all of you! All of you! Never-''
''Why are you doing this to me?,'' I plead. ''I don't want it.''
''I really do love you, Sherlock. You know that, right?,'' and his voice sails across my head. A cloud on a dream landscape, and I am warm.
What caused me to stop, pause, and study the figure was not how he looked, exactly, but what he was doing.
It goes from seemingly disinterested and unconcerned, if somewhat irritable - to a mask of gargoyle-like rage in a matter of seconds. Without meaning to, I suck in a breath. A moment later I am jumping back at the sound of breaking glass.
''Which is possible. It's more than you are used to at one time, I think.''
The seagull is back now. Moving amongst the highest buildings. Untouchable by all. Free to go where it wants.
''You have given me a lot to think about,'' I ventured. ''So much that it's overwhelming to hear.''
''Sherlock...I'm not- You're not going to lose me!''
I close my own eyes, not knowing what to say. With an adult, with an adult whose not been hurt - it's so easy. It hardly matters what you say, then, provided you get to the truth.
''Sherlock? There is nothing else wrong, am I right?''
I bring my hands out of the water. My fingers are trembling.
''Don't lie to me, Sherlock!,'' John roars, and I drop the remaining bag. The bag full of blueberries, and cheesecake. Extra tins of ravioli.
What matters is that Sherlock goes to this meeting.
His eyes bounce back and forth in his skull, alarmed.
He could have walked away.
I give a hesitant nod, because the tension in the room right now is so thick it's almost unbearable.
''You are not easy to live with?''
My hands make their characteristic dismissive fashion of not really caring, not really being one bit concerned.
He does sound angry though, that much is true.
''Bisquick!,'' I shouted, pulling on the lead and Bisquick trotted back to my side where he licked his chops, looking bored. As if he hadn't just bitten the violinist. As if I hadn't just all but dragged him back to my side forcefully.
''It'll stop soon. You've had a shock,'' John says simply, his voice sounding oddly distant.
I can be honest with him, or I can avoid the question. But he asked for me to be honest, so I close my eyes and press against the table with my hands. It feels grounding. Firm. Pressing back.
Donovan sat stunned, watching the scene with an odd look of disbelief on her face, before removing her autumnal garment and passing it over to Sherlock.
''I think you need to hold onto him, John. I think you know what he needs more than I do right now.''
''This is going to bruise. Pretty badly. But I don't think you've broken anything.''
I feel my knee click and pop and stretch, as I make my way over to the kitchen - dumping my remnant tea into the sink. Stick the post it note on the fridge before I forget. Open the new - relatively clean - fridge.
But pleasantly.
My legs and arms feel laden with mortification. Can't he sense that?
Usually it takes a shift in some mental preconception that is skewed and full of self-revulsion for healing to actually begin.
''Remember, Lock. Don't over-think this. Just give your body what it needs,'' I murmured against his ear, and he started to move, then. Furtive little shifts, his eyes closed tightly, as if watching a terrifying film.
I put down the parchment and raise an eyebrow.
'Boring. - SH.'
And why did I have to isolate myself from John? He'd know how to handle this child far better.
Yuri's breath hitches, and he comes to sit down besides me on the sidewalk pavement, outside the little roan house with the number ''417 Ashkin'' on the door.
"I feel funny. I feel- John!," his voice contains a keening, needful sort of plea. But I have no idea what is going on.
''This little girl was sexually assaulted, and murdered and you just sit there-''
''I'm in love with you!,'' he spits, wiping at his eyes furiously. ''I can't be, I can't- and I can't do any- you're not even like that!- and I'm scared.''
It's so incredibly layered.
''John, it's a known fact that severe child abuse can cause...distortions in personality.''
Sherlock huffs and when he looks up at me again, it's with a faint anger.
What I feel can hardly compare to what he must be feeling, stifled or not. Ignored or not. Repressed or not.
''In essence, I would want to duplicate - as cleanly as possible - the same conditions of an enforced treatment scenario. But keep it situated within 221 B Baker Street. It would mean that Sherlock would need to be monitored. All the time. Until such time that I did not feel the slightest concern that he'd impulsively try to do something like this again. The overall treatment plan would likely not differ much to that of a sectioning, or a formal hospital setting. But he'd be at home. And he'd have you, if you feel up to the task of partially caring for him over the next few months.''
Also, I realize now that John Watson must have the patience of a saint.
How do I explain those feelings to my own brother...when I know the effort he invested merely to see me get well?
Not when he needs to hear this.
He broke the jar deliberately.
The elastic ripples obscenely, as normally they would have been pulled taut - only he's lost so much weight.
It's only then that I realize: the jar didn't just drop.
"Doesn't matter," I get out.
I asked him about this as well. To define wellness for me.
Words like: stimming behaviour.
I don't know what right is. Maybe I never knew what right was.
Not the adult I had been hoping for when Sherlock first started speaking.
I let my arm fall to the side of my chair, then squeeze his hand underneath the table. Lightly. Softly. A rallying show of support.
----------------
''Thank you,'' I say, fighting an urge to scratch the side of my face. It's one of my 'tells' for when I am feeling overwhelmed.
The gray eyes continued to flicker over my form, not quite registering the hurt that my brat of a dog had inflicted.
He sounds - in this moment - so unnaturally young, so insecure - that I do want to hug him. I do.
He doesn't ask about the boats after this point.
But his anxiety isn't lessened in that knowledge. In some strange, unfathomable manner - it's all the worse for the knowledge, perhaps.
''You are just going to find another convenient reason to skip another meal, to get even-''
The monotony of his activities, the acedic nature of this subsistence, the repetitiously boring nature of his disease.
''I don't want to stop it,'' he says, his throat choking on the words. ''I know you want me to, but I don't want to. I can't...,'' and his words break off - almost as if he's been winded and lost all the air from his lungs.
My stomach feels ready to split. It is grotesquely large now, whereas an hour before it lay concave, with my hip bones protruding. Now, the protruding bones are covered up by swollenness. By disgusting, assaulting bloat.
''A Dr. John H Watson?''
I stand up suddenly, my fingers curling into fists under my dressing robe.
Done. Done. Done.
This time I chomped down on my bottom lip to keep myself from outright giggling.
I can tell Yuri is piecing things together quickly, thank God, because he doesn't seem offended.
Sally snorts.
''My self analysis?''
I know this game. Intimately.
“Do you know what it’s like to feel something pulse inside you, and know before you open your mouth that you can’t even identify what it is? It’s just this pressure – and I know Yuri says they are emotions – but I can’t NAME them, John. Not because,” I swallow, “not because I am not trying to do so but because I don’t connect with them as if they are mine at all. They just sit in me, and they are nebulous and that, that-“
In another lifetime, looking at his face from this angle, I would have taken his expression for arousal.
And the body stills, his body relaxing - but only marginally. Still, it's a sign. A precursor that he may be able to confide in me if I-
so intimidating for him.
''Russian born, French adopted.''
''Oh what does it even matter?,'' he hisses, ''What does my assessment of John Watson's extreme idealism have to do with anything?''
I wrap my arms around his head and guide him to me.
Mycroft? He detests Mycroft.
I nudge his shoulder with my own solid one.
''Oh, dear. I'm not explaining myself very well, am I?''
The throwing of dishes. The screaming. The lashings of a belt when I was seven, after I had stolen money from my dad's duffle. I had wanted to get a Batman comic book and watermelon gum from the corner store - just like the other kids in my year three class. But we didn't have much money, so I didn't get an allowance. As a result, I 'borrowed' what I needed. I borrowed what I thought I needed - and got beaten for it. It was the first and last time I ever took something that didn't belong to me.
''He's talking,'' he whispers. ''Not much. But enough that we-''
''Norby, the Mixed Up Robot,'' I whisper, the smile refusing to leave from my face.
But I say nothing, and he leaves.
He made a screwed up motion with his hands, dismissive.
YOU-TOO
So I touch the glass and look at a man with sunken eyes, whom I do not find anything but ghastly, and I speak to him.
"He was extremely depressed with developments that he could neither avoid nor slow. I have ascertained that it was likely due to the normal sexual changes he knew to expect. He was not coping well with even the prospect of their arrival, apparently."
''Because it was ugly for you, Sherlock. Because it was painful, and it was cruel, and it was wrong. Very, very wrong. And it's all that you knew. So why should you feel any differently? When that's all you've ever known?''
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I watch Sherlock amble off, slightly crouched over. His face looks lined, almost hard. I almost want to ask him if he's okay, but I know he needs a bit of distance right now. He must feel like an overexposed nerve.
''I didn't know you liked sharks,'' I say dumbly.
''Well, fine is a good starting point, sure. But let's try to improve upon 'fine', alright?''
No, not like this at all.
So I press against the metallic cross-walk sign. Press the button. Ignore the shuffled, scraping sound from behind me.
''Did you figure out what you are, then?,'' I ask crisply, turning in a flourish to retrieve freshly made coffee.
''Psychotic disorders,'' and a shrill giggle suddenly erupts. I look up then, horrified by my reaction. ''You think Sherlock was psychotic?''
His lips are against mine, and they are soft - but neither completely wet or dry. They feel moisturized and I have the sudden urge to laugh against Sherlock's mouth. Because I don't usually think about things like lip wetness when someone is kissing me. And maybe it is just the alcohol, but-
'Talking about subjects unrelated to the established conversation.'
It's not like I haven't tried to apologize.
''What?''
Sherlock takes a sip of the sludge and makes a face.
''I'm sorry,'' he rushes, painfully fast. ''I know I look awful. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have to look at me like this, and-''
Nothing. No stored texts at all, either. From any point in the day since I left him at the hospital, which is actually highly unusual.
Sherlock moves towards the scale, and steps on carefully. As if he doesn't want to add too much of his body to the scale too quickly.
What scares me is that accompanying the red-flickering cross and the night and the wasted sense of hope I can suddenly recall a scent, too. A memory-scent of antiseptic. And a memory-taste of blood.
''Well, I am fairly confident I don't have a sadistic bone in my body, Sherlock. No,'' and as annoying as it is, I can swear Yuri is still smiling.
So the questions posed now seem all the more strange in their formality and their no-doubt false 'calmness.'
''I'm sick of this disorder in your life, and I guess - by extension - in my life. Because it is a source of pain for you, even if you don't seem to always acknowledge that fact. But I'll never be sick of you. I want you healthy, is all.''
''I can't have you - I can't have you monitoring every-''
I nod, resigned.
Sherlock closes his eyes again.
I suddenly feel like I've had the wind knocked out of me.
--------------------------------
"No, Sherlock."
He's not.
-------------------
Why do I feel compelled to discuss THIS with him when I don't even want to think of it?
------------------------------
------------------------------------------
I realize I am still wearing my hospital bracelet. I will need John to cut it off for me since he's confiscated the scissors.
Probably exactly the case.
I take a few seconds to get my bearing, to actually GET that it's actually Sherlock whose speaking these words. Not one of the children from our recent case from hell. And these nonsensical words feel wrong. They don't fit the puzzle that is Sherlock.
This time, I hear his swallow.
Sherlock is calmer than earlier, but the change from guarded and snarky to withdrawn and quiet is not a victory, either. He almost looks defeated.
(yes. oh god, yes, i am.
Of course he wouldn't want me calling his brother. I get that, I understand.
when i am their very definition of unwell.
I walk eight streets north and then proceed four blocks to my right, wandering on over to a small park. At this hour no one is around, and the street lamps shine eerily down onto the cobblestone that winds throughout the area. I walk over to a park bench and sit down, adjusting the violin, and getting comfortable before beginning to play. I choose a piece by Sarasate, and let my body play the music with almost manic rapidity. I put all my anger and rage into my playing, and the music suffers for it, I am sure; by the end of the 9 minutes, however, I am actually feeling emotionally lanced. Almost as if someone took a scalpel and opened a putrescent wound. Lighter, inside, maybe. Less constricted in my throat and chest and lungs. My chest feels open again, and I pull the violin closer to my cheek, closing my eyes and letting my hands proceed to work out basic scales. It's a meditative pattern, and I am soothed by the rhythmic motion.
Of course.
''There are things in my head, Yuri. They crouch down low, where others don't see, so I can hide them or ignore them. Often, I can. But it's - lately - they are swarming now, do you see?''
------------------------------------------
and is that not a mature thing to do?
------------------
I push the images away then, and watch John's mouth move - almost soundlessly.
Feel something sort of quietly doleful in my belly.
Of course, rage.
Right.
''So he didn't love me then, John! So no one ever did! Is that what you really wanted to hear me say?! That I knew he gave every indication of having used me, but I let it happen anyway, because he at least SAID he loved me? And I wanted that to count for something? Because-,'' his voice crumples, ''because I wanted to pretend it was true?''
''And I still want that pancreas you promised me,'' he adds quietly, waiting for my response.
I breathe out heavily. From what Greg had described - the vast amount of blood, Sherlock clutching at his stomach in pain - I had suspected as much. The details sounding like some sort of rupture.
Of best friend.
We pull up to the entrance and as the vehicle stops I see the door open to reveal Mycroft's presence. He watches me carefully, his face looking rather inscrutable.
But the scene before me has been terminated.
And yet there is still nothing.
So many names.
'STOP, STOP. NO! DADDY, PLEASE NO! NOO!'
''In the French language they say, essentially, that someone ''has hunger.'' They do not say that they are hungry, as we do in English. Even though hunger is a sensation and what we are is, essentially, sensating beings. That always made me a little antsy. I didn't want to be hunger or be fullness. I wanted none of it. I wanted it gone. I wanted all of those sensations to go away, and I still want them to go away. Do you see?''
''It doesn't feel very healthy, John.''
And it's true. I am decidedly not hungry. In fact, I feel a little bit sick to my stomach.
He knows it showcases anxiety.
And if purchasing a few books is too much for you...
Eyes intense but not haunted.
"Because I am your friend, Sherlock."
I suddenly feel enraged.
I weave my fingers through his own lightly; stroke his palm with my thumb.
''Are you even real?,'' I mutter, while the man stares back, looking more like a corpse than a man. I realize then that the man's lips are dry, so I open up the medicine cabinet and root around for some camphor salve. Finding the little red tin, I apply it over my fingertips and rub it over my lips.
Serves her right.
-----------------------------------------------------
Sherlock looks at me, his face watching, scanning.
It should count for something, right?
For John's benefit, I also nod.
"The event that triggered my brother most deeply was completely normal. To most others, it would seem to be almost innocuous, on the whole. It was the night my brother first experienced a nocturnal sexual response," Mycroft's voice is extremely soft. Barely above a whisper. "He did not deal well with the experience."
Not sure if that's a good sign or not.
------------------------------------
''And you're repetitive,'' I say dully. My chest is heavy. ''You did not go to see Yuri Pascal because I'm so-called 'sick.''
''Victor, I don't know. I don't know if I, if we, if I can-''
Sherlock's eyes are darting about; I realize he's as stunned by what he's just done as I am.
Not like I thought I would.
''Of course we could, but I should have realized. You're a jam man. I have a plum jam, too. And a raspberry.''
John is silent for a moment, before asking: ''the 'thoughts'?''
Sherlock gives me a shy smile.
''There is nothing I need to discuss with you that I cannot discuss in John's presence.''
Still, enough time has passed that I feel I should at least make an effort to reach out to him. Otherwise, he might take it as avoidance. As if I am ashamed OF him, and not merely trying to give him some privacy.
''Yeah?''
Probably exhaustion, but still.
Very little time, indeed.
''You haven't done anything wrong, you know. You haven't, Sherlock.''
Two weeks later
''Aside from informing you that I feel like I've been gutted by a lawn instrument?''
I decide to not address the fact that calling it a 'thing' denies the darker aspect of the entire situation.
I rub at my mouth with my fingertips. Both feel numb.
My fingers continue to glide over his skull; as his breathing regulates and his eyes flicker about indicating the start of REM sleep - I let my hands move to touch his temples, the ridges of his face, his cheekbones.
and give me a look, not stifling, not possessive, but knowing.
“Home before,” I mutter. “With the, umm, with the book.”
Then I nodded in a numbed fashion, disturbed that I could feel so much fear when nothing overtly bad or frightening was happening.
''Why would you actually care if anything helps me?,'' I mock. ''You don't even know me.''
----------------------------
John is staring up at me with a look of intense concentration and concern.
''Should I write down 'yes'?''
Sherlock blinks as if he doesn't understand the question.
I should really apologize. But I suspect that any apology I try to offer will result in mockery, and my nerves are frayed too.
I sit back down in my chair, and drag it closer to the table.
Toby looks up, studies me as best as he can. Part of me wonders if he remembers anything about that night. About how I picked him up, his eyes spasming in his small skull as if he were having a seizure. The animal-like scream in his throat as he pushed at me. John's shouting in the background for an ambulance. For the ''goddamn paramedics!''
''Did my psychiatrist actually text you? For heaven's sake! This is completely unnecessary,'' I hear Sherlock mutter, his voice pitched a little on the high side. He also has a flushed look about him. As if he's been screaming at someone, or else is coming down with a fever.
Sherlock has literally curled in upon himself.
But that primary alexithymia could become an enduring psychological trait, exacerbated by disconnection with others, repression of emotion, repression of self expression as it relates to emotionality.
He suddenly wraps his arms around his waist, and pulls back from me.
Because I won't reveal what Sherlock wouldn't want me to make mention of, even if he needs to face his past. Even if he needs allies that could help him. At the end of the day, the decision of whom to tell, and when, and how - all need to be Sherlock's.
"No," he growls. "No. Mummy had me see doctors. Quite a few. Nothing was wrong with me. I was just obstinate."
Sure, I want nothing more than to 'fix' Sherlock. But badgering him to talk about subjects that haunt him this greatly isn't helping and I need to step back. Try a different tactic.
''I have a person who is an extremely good listener. This person thinks I would benefit by talking to a professional such as yourself. I have promised my friend I would explore this possibility. It's more for his benefit than mine.''
Anyway, I am ‘allowed’ up to four of them per day, in six hour intervals, and because of my reticence, my general disdain for seeming as if I need them – I have tried to avoid them except in cases where my mouth is drying out, and my hands are shaking, and I feel queasy and sick. In fact, most of the time John is the one suggesting that I take one of the anxiolytics.
''I guess the answer is yes,'' Sherlock grins at me, ordering the paper bits into a little line along the edge of the table, before pulling up the menu.
Sherlock bites his lips, closes his eyes. Gesticulates with his hands.
And I came so close to confiding in him about what had been happening to me, because I knew he cared about me in an almost parental way.
Once I had killed it in my own mind, perhaps.
I had counted to 65.
Turning, I take in Lestrade's eyes. His kindly eyes and his face that looks over at me with hope and compassion.
''I don't think there is one right way to feel about this, and I don't think your feelings are wrong or atypical, either. But maybe, it's like...how I felt when I was a kid. When I was homesick. Maybe you always felt that pain, but you kept the emotions and thoughts to yourself, Sherlock. I think we all have this incredible way of surviving through pain, but we get through a lot of hard stuff on our own. Sometimes, it's about repressing certain thoughts, and certain feelings. Sublimating them with other things. Work - your work, the puzzles and riddles that keep your mind busy. That relentless feeling, of always having to do more, and everything about how you've lived for so long. Very little sleep, lots of mental stimulation - that's been your life for so long. Running from place to place with little time to process anything but the immediacy of a case.''
And I should say that I'm sorry. I should say something sympathetic.
Sherlock nods, but still glances about uneasily. Pockets the medication.
I let out a bark of bitter laughter and his blue eyes quirk up in hurt.
Seven abducted, six killed - by the time Sherlock had been consulted.
And then I thought of Mycroft, and I put the blade back in to dad's shaving compartment and zipped everything up.
Sherlock didn't just say he loved me.
''Fine,'' I say uneasily, knowing that given the mood I am in right now, anything in my stomach is likely to make me feel worse. Sicker, not stronger.
That makes me wonder...what else is he doing to himself, in the hopes that I will never find out?
The boy looks anxious.
''This is going to sting,'' I warn.
Cue the violins.
Five days after John rushes from my home with a look of sickening anxiety on his face, I get a call.
''Look in the mirror. You're losing weight! You haven't eaten much on this case, and God Sherlock - I get it,'' and his voice softens abruptly, ''I do. I've tried so hard to ignore it, but you don't look...healthy. You haven't looked healthy for weeks, and I'm concerned.''
''You are infuriating! I've been trying to talk to you for five days, and now you care?''
The man's face worked awkwardly, presumably debating if he should go his own way or if he should take me up on my suggestion.
“I don’t care if it hurts,” I reply quickly, not liking the assertion that I would somehow be afraid of a little medical exam. Even one that caused pain. “And as you can see – my potassium and electrolyte numbers are much better than they were when contrasted against the previous two weeks.”
==========================
I open my mouth to speak, then close it a second later.
''I got a carton of egg whites for myself. High in protein, easy to digest. It's a start, right?''
I sling my overnight bag over my shoulder and then go off in search of answers.
"What?"
It's positively hateful.
''As you can see, his results in many areas are dismal,'' the doctor speaks briskly. ''Heart rate, blood pressure, potassium levels. All abnormally low,'' and the doctor now turns to Sherlock, trying to meet his eyes.
''Why are you asking me that?,'' and here we have it. The two of us talking from a distance, in every sense of the word. I am reminded of a child's game of dodgeball - when both players want to run out to throw the ball, but are simply too afraid of being smacked to even attempt the throw. Of course, that's not exactly an apt analogy because Lestrade and Sherlock are on the same team. Only Sherlock may not see it that way when it comes to certain subjects.
A voice throughout my whole body, louder in it's silent rantings than John's pleadings and Mycroft's offerings and bribes.
"I only remember bits and pieces. I don't remember actually, well - I don't remember anybody doing anything to me. I just remember mostly the after. The breathing. My crying. Pain. Not being real."
"I need a shower. And I will need to stop by Tesco's first."
''No, I, I-,'' anguish peppers my tongue. ''It fits. It fits me so much! Don't call it a supposition when it fits! When it's something that makes sense, when nothing else does!''
Sherlock forces his eyes back to his violin.
I look at the bottle.
I try to ignore the burning in my chest.
Sherlock bucked at the sensation, and made a high pitched noise that caused me to grin widely.
I sigh and get to my feet, giving him an awkward smile as I enter the living room before depositing myself down into the loveseat and repositioning the Union Jack pillow. I try not to study him. Not overtly, at any rate. I focus my attention across to the battered wall. To the chrome yellow smiley face on the wall.
''Like this,'' he said, he voice a little more tentative. Softer. He opened the pages of the book.
''I cared for Victor,'' Sherlock amends quickly. ''I think I may have even loved him.''
This time I do close my eyes. I’ve always been able to talk to him more easily when I cannot see his face. When my voice feels removed from my body.
''Twice a week?,'' I confirm.
And when it leaves my body, like it did a few minutes ago, the inside of my being feels less padded and less numb, and for that alone: far less safe.
“Never again,” I repeat the mantra. Frown at the tile. “Never again will I hurt you.”
“You seem terribly excited for a beverage that you just had this morning,” I mutter.
I can't make it seem as if I am studying him. Keeping tabs on him.
I can still envision that evening, when I came around the train tracks - nowhere near water at all, and wasn't that already a clue that his attack wasn't the same as the others? - and Sherlock staggered back towards me, his face a white moon, with streaks of blood wetting his cheek.
Oh god.
His voice holds no brook of refusal.
"Of course when I was little! Mycroft never-," and he suddenly looks furious.
Yuri seems to muse over this for a bit.
“Alright. Healthier than that.”
The man in the mirror does not respond.
Damn it. Damnitdamnit.
And he is now?
I think of kindness - to receive kindness, or comfort - in a way I imagine some who are more puritanical might think about sex.
''Sally?,'' I question.
I swallow down a lump of sore regret, and suddenly feel an intense need to see my friend. To hold him.
And I do believe you can pull yourself out of the mire.
I glance at the clock. It’s edging to half-past twelve. I know John’s schedule well enough to be aware that he will be doing rounds at the clinic until nearly 4:30. And Sherlock is my only patient on Saturdays.
"We never spoke of it again - what he had told me, I mean. I chalked it up to his hysteria at the time. But I could clearly discern that even the mere prospect that the situation could repeat itself was extremely distressing to Sherlock. I did what I could to minimize his shame, of course, but I knew the likelihood was that it would continue to happen. Unfortunately enough for him."
It opens easily. Readily. And I try to dismiss the aspect of forcefulness here, knowing it is the lesser of two evils.
''Yeah, that's right. I do. For people who actually are looking for a psychotherapist. Not just looking for an alibi so they can get a friend or loved one off their back. I mean, I'm not going to play games with you, Sherlock.''
Mycroft nods in my direction, accepting my words as truthful.
But then I grew up and realized what a stupid thing that was to dream about.
He sounds apologetic, and all I can hear is 14 year old Devon talking to me in his wheezy rasp. Itemizing his list of 14 foods. All low caloric, and all sugar free, and all essentially nutrition-less.
**********************************************************************
I lather up the shampoo and run it through my hair.
Not to have my name bandied about over the phone, where anyone can see. Not when my name is regularly in papers. It would be too much of a nightmare to have my private on goings revealed to the papers where everyone can read about them. Where Donovan and Anderson and Lestrade can read about them. And while a doctor or receptionist would likely be in hot water for talking openly about a patient, I don't want to take any chances. Especially since a bothersome patient could just as easily overhear and be the blabber-mouth.
''Why did you fail to inform me that my brother had become emaciated, Doctor Watson?''
My goal is to simply slip out of the house, and get the kid strapped into the squad car, and then have the details of my actions explained to Mr. Thiesen at a later time.
''I'd like to establish the nature of the abuse,'' he said carefully, next. Null of emotion. ''Do you know how it would be classified? Was it emotional? Was it something else?''
Alexithymia.
''And changed, no less. I'm a man of stealth abilities,'' I say dryly, then kick myself for what that sounds like.
In essence, to grow up and to be okay.
In some weird way that I can't readily identify...everything is getting worse.
I keep my voice light and easy.
It would be foolish of me to assume he'd proceed in a typical way to typical therapies.
Mycroft's eyes still study the paper but I catch the hardening of his gaze. The taut lines at the corners.
''You forgot prostate,'' I say in icy tones, then wince at the reveal. ''Can't forget that one.''
''So - Harry. Why don't you two get along?''
Haven't you exposed your underbelly enough in the last few days?
''Dr. Watson?,'' and she tries to interrupt without interrupting.
Maybe, that's even how the very first dream began - as they started abruptly, shortly after I learned about Victor - but soon, they progressed.
Stuff like that.
I give him a terse smile.
I get up, briskly walk to the kitchenette. Find Sherlock's mobile, return to the living room, toss it to him.
“Sherlock, I need to ask: did your father rape you?”
''Okay. That's completely okay,'' I breathe, giving him a restricted smile.
Mrs. Hudson is watching me with what Sherlock would call her 'clueless' manner. Which is actually not clueless at all. Quite the opposite, really.
I maneuver myself between his bed and dresser, feeling more snug in the small enclosure of space.
''You don't want me to hurt,'' I reply, suddenly aware of the time, the date.
''Get what to stop?''
''This is...fucked,'' he hisses, and I flinch at the expletive.
''Started?,'' I gritted, suddenly wary. Suddenly hurt. ''Did John say somethi-''
His eyes dart back and forth in anxiety, but otherwise remaining centered on me.
John looks at me in confusion – then catches sight of the Moleskin notebook in my hands.
''Not going to happen. Lestrade says you're not to go speaking to Toby on your own. Not after the stunt you pulled with Dr. Barrett.''
...this text comes in.
''You can tell me. Come on,'' he says faintly, in the dark. ''It's okay to tell me.''
'Well, at least I know you are in good hands. Give Molly a hug from me.'
''It'll be after noon,'' I say dumbly. ''In about, umm, 45 minutes or so. If he calls back on schedule.''
Sherlock is currently the colour of milk, and I hate that this - not criminals intent on poisoning him, not bullying co-workers at the Yard, not the cruel speech of those who don't 'get' him, but a kind psychiatrist asking wholly carefully crafted sentences - could bring out such fear and anticipation of bad things, of dark things.
''Your mouth showed signs of inflammation, which could indicate a previous history of vomiting. Have you been recently been sick, beyond today?''
''I've said it before, and I will say it again, then: this is not your business!''
This time, I feel restricted from responding. To do so would break the spell.
I zip up my coat. Give a fast shake of my head.
''That woke you up, Lock. Feels good, huh?,'' I teased, stroked the skin gently, non-aggressively. ''You're almost there already.''
''It would be easier if it did,'' he mutters, finally replacing his glass with trembling hands. ''If we presented in assured units. Something solid. Something which can't be taken away easily.''
John sits up after a few minutes when he realizes that I need to be silent and process what he’s said, before he wanders into the kitchenette.
A glower at that comment is sent my way.
The voices were only ever meant for me, alone.
Sherlock’s hands are fidgeting with his coat; plucking the buttons before tugging on them.
This must be what they noticed, upon admittance to the hospital weeks back.
He threw it.
''Your neck must kill. You didn't fall asleep in a very good position,'' I reply, lamely.
And for what purpose?
I look up quickly.
I take a step towards the stairs, when Sherlock reaches his hand out to me - as if commanding me to stop, yet again.
Sherlock closes his eyes briefly and when they flutter open a few seconds later, I can see that they are swollen with tears.
''I've never seen him act like that,'' I say with a frown.
------------------------------------------
Sherlock swallows, seems to compose himself.
“Better?,” I query, tailoring my facial expression into something resembling professional equanimity.
John grumbles something else into the phone (I can't make it out. Not fully), and then starts to pass the phone over to me.
The slight comfort of not feeling overloaded with food has shifted, and a new anxiety is burrowing into the crevices of my brain.
Oh, Sherlock.
''My father. He-,'' he trails off, anxiously.
''Great. What do you want? I'll make you anything you'd like. An omelet? I can make you a cheese and mushroom omelet? Maybe with some toast?''
I spin around, uncomprehending.
Molly places the cuff around my right arm quickly and with dexterity. She squeezes the pump and the cuff inflates with air. Then, my skin prickles with tension and pressure.
''I could be,'' he whispers. ''Maybe this is exactly what I need. And you'd be in there, with me. Me and you, against him. You'd blot it out, wouldn't you?''
Mrs. Hudson knitted those for us, and if he stains them with ketchup, she's not going to be amused.
-------------------------------------
It's something. And it takes effort for him to do that much, and I can see it now. Not just a disordered way of being in terms of actions alone, but the fear: I didn't see that before, didn't understand that eating generated so much fear in him or for him. I thought it made him feel dizzy and light, in the way drugs and alcohol did. I thought, too, that it covered up his upset, and gave him a sense of control - and I'm sure that on some level, I'm right on those counts, too. Starving does all of that, and more.
And what had Yuri said?
What do I do now?
So sorry for the wait, guys!
''Can you explain it any better than that? I want to understand, Sherlock.''
The anger returns and I chuck my pillow against the wall.
My eyes scan the rows, based on subject matter.
''I...,'' and he points to his head. ''Too many thoughts, and-,'' I see him gulp-swallow air, overwhelmed. ''I don't-''
That hits its mark, and his jaw clenches under too-tight skin. I can see the bones of his skull pulse out against his temples.
But I'm fighting for him. Because I can. And because I can, I will.
But he didn’t.
''Yes. One last time. But we aren't dragging this out. It's not fair to Yuri. And you're finishing that yogurt. Then I want you upstairs for a check in.''
I turn away and shake my head.
------------------------------------------------------------
Three, if I drop the John. Two if I keep it really simple. Just a 'love you.' But when could I say something like that? When getting the paper? When watching a show? At Angelo's? After a case? Anytime I say it would sound wrong.
But ultimately, I do not want to head back to the flat without a distraction. If I have a project, I can put on my goggles, and tuck in my ear plugs, and ignore John until he stops his inane rambling and his over-the-top concerned pleading. I can work, and he can fuss, but I can remain distracted.
The type of stupidity that I fought my whole life against.
I didn't do anything cruel to Sherlock. Not really.
''Sick,'' and his throat moves again. I can tell that he's on edge. Anyone could tell that he's on edge.
I pad lightly towards the hallway and amble down the steps, feeling a tad deflated. I mean, with everything that has happened recently it would be hard to call this day 'happy.' I am relieved beyond all measure that he's been cleared to come home, and that he hasn't done considerably more damage to himself. But I feel a gnawing upset over his worry that somehow I would be 'enraged.'
He never once tried to stop my tirade.
I blink against the light of the setting sun. My limbs still tingle with relief.
Still, the tremulous movement of my friend in the chair has me concerned.
I stop.
Glancing towards the floor, I see that John is no longer resting in the sleeping bag, and fresh shame assaults me as I recall the previous nights events.
So I shouldn't reach for him. Not now, not with his rabid angry-hurt eyes imploring me to fix life, to make people kind, to negate all the predators in the world.
He's trying. It's something. It's more than something, really, because he's eating, and whether he went into the kitchen and got his breakfast in anticipation of my seeing this act or not - it's still something profound.
A compulsion to pinch the bridge of my nose and stave off my headache is increasing.
even john.)
He rubs at his eyes and I can sense that a bit of the tension has left his body. Not much. But some. It's a start.
His breathing starts to regulate, and I push my chair across the carpeting, closer to his own position. I don't want to crowd him, but I also don't want him to feel alone - or worse - as if I want to distance myself from him.
Carry on.
I have no interest in bulldozing through someone else's emotional past just because I can.
Normally, I'd say - 'yes, you're right, Sarah.'
''Please tell me those were a Christmas gift from a very young niece.''
And it was just the nanosecond click of a mouse. It was nothing.
“Not then,” he replies faintly. “But I don’t want to talk about that. I’m not ever going to talk about that – not even with you.”
My voice is shaking, and I'm sure I'm white-like-bone, but I say that much. I get it out.
''Not today! I don't mean today! But someday! Maybe even soon! You are going to find someone, and you will want to get married and have children, and probably a dog with a stupid name and do all those expected, boring, mediocre, normal-''
He's also not meeting my eyes.
And when he steps forward, I step back and away from him quickly, shutting my eyes against the onslaught that I suspect is coming. In fact, without realizing it, I pull my hands up and over my head and flinch into the wall - my body going rigid.
''So you didn't care for Victor, and-''
I swallow another taste of cappuccino. Try not to laugh at his admittance. ''But of course. Anything else?''
Now is not the time. Perhaps there will never be a time for me to broach the specifics of this disorder with him, and as it stands - it's likely not something that I need to discuss with him.
Still, I am trying my best to juggle a pretty hefty new workload, a recent move and other changes with my online writing projects.
Honestly, I don't know what will ever work for Sherlock. Even Mycroft's no doubt countless attempts to get his brother help, since childhood, have obviously not done the trick. All that money, all those resources, and all those no-doubt high powered shrinks haven't lessened the impact of what he had to live through, because that's what this is all about, isn't it?
------------------------------------------
I stop talking to the Martian. He never listens to my pleading.
Of course, I have no intentions of hanging up.
I cracked open a bottle of Bordeaux, and served us both a generous portion.
I let his statement resound without an immediate answer, before furrowing away my upset at his self-perception.
Molly hands me her mobile.
The elder Holmes looks up at me coldly now.
''Wait. Is that why you tried to get the morphine? Because of Yuri's...suppositions?!''
''I didn't see Yuri to discover that I'm not gay, Sherlock. I never thought I was gay. That wasn't the point of the meeting at all.''
Sherlock turns and gives me a tense smile.
''Uhh, well - I find him sort of beautiful. Aesthetically. And he's beautiful inside, too, but he'd laugh if I ever insinuated as much. I mean, he used to call himself a sociopath. High functioning, he said - but I mean if that's how he wants to see himself, that already indicates a problem, doesn't it?''
Sherlock frowns, looks off-put.
Which is a miraculous thing in and of itself.
''Mrs. Thiesen wants him to be there. When they...you know,'' I reveal quickly, feeling like we're both close to truths we're not ready to deal with this morning.
I turn around abruptly at that, knowing something has occurred with that simple proclaimation.
''John?,'' and his eyes are so intensely piercing. Sherlockian eyes, almost. Almost. Not quite.
He's still looking at me with that wary expression, as if debating the veracity of my claim.
------------------------------------
When I emerge from the darkness of the city tunnels, the light suddenly seems too intense for England. The cars are loud, the air smells smoky. And I realize my brain is trying to process everything. It's overreacting to sensory data now, much as it did when I was abroad.
“I hate him,” he murmurs. “He’s dead, and I still hate him. I just want- I want-”
''Open the door, Sherlock,'' John says, his tone resolute.
"Sherlock, I want to help you. Help you both-"
I want John to look like John, and treat me like Sherlock. Not like a stranger.
'Your brother is on the phone for you, Sherlock. We've had enough of this silliness, haven't we?,' and I nodded, sniffled. Grabbed the phone, and shouted into the receiver.
At any other time in my life, I'd perhaps have been too timid or anxious or plain shy to broach such a serious topic in the presence of others. But I know that Mycroft loves Sherlock more than I previously considered. I know that nothing I can say is going to make this situation worse, simply for the fact that Mycroft is present.
Sherlock's eyes close completely and I see his knuckles go white, as if physically pained.
But here's the thing that I worry about, sometimes.
I suddenly have an impulse to put my hand in a blender.
''And the haloperidol was overseen by several attending physicians. So it's likely that's accurate too, wouldn't you say?''
While we never discuss cases in any detail whatsoever for the obvious privacy reasons, he still checks in with me. He’s always been concerned by the possibility that one day I could burn-out. “Compassion fatigue” is the phrase he likes to throw around occasionally – usually after a rather draining session.
He looked back up to me, a little more openly.
I rise from the table.
Which could help with the physical symptoms, but which might take more out of Sherlock emotionally. It'll likely be difficult enough to get him to eat three times a day. If I were to encourage him to eat six or more times a day, I think he'd be knots every moment of his waking life. There would be no cessation to the emotional demands that this would place on him.
And that has everything to do with me, too. But I can't fixate on that right now.
Yuri's eyes catch my line of sight, and he shifts slightly from where he has now taken residence (which is a single person sized mustard yellow sitting chair).
''Sentiment, yes,'' he begins, putting the pajamas back down on the bed, ''I will get changed now,'' he adds awkwardly.
---------------------------------
''Why are you crying?,'' and he genuinely sounds perplexed.
Damn it.
Maybe it's this.
''Likely late,'' and the ginger haired man rises, gives me a slight nod. ''I am going to get one of those vending machine atrocities, as I feel at this time that some caffeine would be better than none. John, can I get you anything?''
I frown at the reveal: he's either nervous, cold, or both.
Next, Yuri had wanted to know when I had first noticed Sherlock's eating atypicalities (my word, again. I refused to call Sherlock abnormal, which was a word he bandied about with a self-depreciating tone).
This is something I have never discussed with him.
''Greg? I'm home now. I will talk to him in a bit. Try to get a feel for what's going on.''
“So you – your mind – was able to go somewhere he’d never think to look.”
He might need to talk about this, but he surely doesn't want what he perceives as 'pity.'
''Get in,'' I commanded Sherlock, and he did, all skinny legs and concave belly, and his long, dangling artist arms across his ribcage.
I just don't know how well any touch - even something I would deem incredibly safe, would go over right now.
I nod gruffly, not meeting his gaze.
“Why did you, I mean – why did you gave up your practice? To become a dietician?”
His voice sounds awkward. The parsing is strange - as if he's unsure what he's saying. Speaking in a foreign language, and testing out a sentence to see if it makes sense to a native speaker.
When the puzzle books and majority of the markers and colouring sheets have been removed from the bag, I bunch everything together and put it near his side table, so he'll have easy access after we've left.
I push against my legs. Needing to feel the pressure of something firm and solid.
And there was so little fanfare to that episode, too. He went in, spoke to doctors, spoke to Yuri, came home, and degraded further.
I never allow myself to get drunk. Especially not when I am upset. It's a rule borne of living with an alcoholic mother, and then becoming acquainted to alcoholism even more intensely through witnessing the growing up years of an alcoholic sister.
Following my twin's passing I lost our mum to a rare and aggressive form of cancer. She passed on Mother's Day. (I was resting beside her in her hospital bed. I hope it brought her some peace).
''Toby? I'm going to sit right here, by the door, okay? I won't force you to come out of there.''
Annnnnd....we are back to JOHN'S POV
"Even so, he won't make a sound. It's too premature to actually diagnosis him with anything, but the doctors think it's a result of shock. They are hoping they can get him to speak even a few words. To break through the silence."
I don't know if I succeed.
Because despite the many betrayals Sherlock's lived through, he felt secure enough to reach out to me. Through atypical means. In a way that could even indicate romantic affection.
''I took it to sleep. A reality that you are making increasingly more difficult right now by refusing to leave me alone.''
And if I am going to use any word to describe Sherlock's role in my life, I need to choose a word that's a good deal fairer than 'friend.'
''Sherlock. Don't,'' and the Don't comes out as hard, almost cold.
They possibly are.
Then he stands up, and pads to the bookshelf. Looks into the fireplace for a moment.
''Yes, of course - eating dinner. Eating a miniscule amount of salad. A most atypical situation!''
''Ahhh, Molly. Good. You're here. Always a pleasure,'' I express quickly, without sufficient enthusiasm. Though, to my credit I am feeling very tired.
''And you wonder why people like you.''
My lungs suddenly burn with upset, and I get up quickly.
I'm not letting some stupid melodramatic Sherlock antic impact my job.
Yuri had crouched low on his haunches, held it out to me.
I sniff it. It smells like John.
''And isn't that the crux of your problems? That you can't even see that you need someone to help you? That you can't even see that you need help at all?''
''It's fine. It's warm,'' he murmured, suddenly picking up my hands, and fiddling with my digits. Long, lean artist hands, and an expression of such childish naiveté, that I wanted to simply collide with him. Wipe that look off of his face. Wake him up, and know that I had been the one to do so.
''Hold on. One thing -''
He squints at the screen, shakes his head as a heavily tattooed 14 year old graces the stage, then turns back to me.
''What?,'' I say sharply. ''What are you talking about?''
''This thing must feel so itchy against your belly,'' I growled, and Sherlock shook his head at me, eyes still wide.
''I could do that, yes. I could probably even get him to come here, and I could probably even get him to talk to me. But what do you think is going to happen if he doesn't want to be here? Ultimately, I mean?''
-------------
I blink back weight and warmth and blurriness.
I can feel wetness all over my lap.
Sherlock nods against his pillow, his dark tresses clinging to his skull with sweat.
He pokes at the blanket again, his eyes trained on anything but me.
John puts his sandwich back down against his plate.
He had tugged his belstaff around his body, and pushed up in his chair - as if to leave.
''I-I don't know what to do. I don't know what's happening here; I thought this was just friendship,'' and his voice sounded high. Almost alarmed. ''I am not good with,'' and when he licked his lips, I felt a shiver go through my core, ''reciprocation in these matters. I won't say the right words, do the right things. And I don't need coffee. Not any kind. I'm okay.''
I bit back a spurt of laughter. Not that the sentiment was unusual for him. I simply was relieved he was eating at all and so his typical grousing had me laughing in a sort of exhausted relief.
"So Mycroft's father hurt you. But he didn't hurt Mycroft. Because Mycroft was - what? 'His son'? And he didn't see you the same way? Is that what you are trying to tell me?"
''No, I've got it. I'm good,'' and then I wonder if that's a sufficient response, or if a normal person would take such a response personally. ''Thank you for offering,'' I add a second later. I probably sound robotic.
I see a slightly glass-blurred Yuri press against the latch, and open the second and exterior door, holding it at such an angle that I can catch it easily with my fingertips.
Try to compose something that will make today better. Try to live up to my title of doctor, but more than that - of friend.
Sherlock looks up to me in confusion.
-----------------------------
The shadow child.
''No, don't get up. You just had surgery on your stomach. Your belly probably feels terribly sore right now.''
'I want John to know that I will get better. That I've been here before, and worse, and got better on my own. I want him to stop worrying. When he worries, it makes it harder for me to eat. And I don't know why.'
''Too high in sodium,'' I respond automatically. ''Bad for blood pressure.''
''The person I am trying to reach is a doctor I met in the clinic.''
It wasn't simply the fact that another little child had died.
And what's more - I can't differentiate if I like it or dislike it. His touch, I mean. All I know is that it makes me feel wrong. Ashamed, almost.
I moved his body with my hands until he'd become soaked by the spray, and then motioned for him to bend forward a few inches. He tilted his head.
Sherlock blinks, his eyes widen almost imperceptibly, and then he nods again - this time more hesitantly.
''Some of these problems - even feeling badly emotionally - are being caused by your refusal to eat enough, or drink enough fluids. Get enough sleep. Physically take care of yourself. They are not the only reason for why you feel so confused and scared. But they are related. You understand that, don't you?''
That auburn head is shaking at me. He holds up a finger and his eyes scrunch up in just a very vulnerable and imploring way; I stop my tirade mid-sentence.
Oh, we are back to JOHN'S POV.
''He's having head pain; I don't want to waste any time in having him see a neurologist.''
When I don't get a response, I open the door slightly - as it hasn't been locked.
''But don't you need the physical act, too?,'' Sherlock mutters, his knee jumping in staccato beats against the lino. ''Don't most people? Normal people? Victor said-''
My throat is tight, and I whisper the next portion.
And I know this isn't his fault. This is my fault.
''What is it, eh? You're dropping weight, dearheart,'' I muttered to his side, against his ear, and he pulled back. Microscopically pulled back.
I help him away from the toilet, and grab some tissue before he goes down in a heap.
------------------------
I almost choke on my scone.
Because It's back, and It hasn't been with me for a long, long time. Not like this.
''You know exactly 'what','' Sally breathes, harshly. ''My God - it's all over him. Like soot. Like...something worse, and you know exactly what I'm talking about, so do not play games with me. He could have a neon sign swinging from around his neck and it wouldn't make it any more obvious!''
John has returned, and I purposefully navigate around him in the kitchen. He's making himself tea.
''Watch it?'' I raise a brow in question.
The seventh abducted child.
I hate that.
''You should head to work, John. Who knows how long this will take?''
*No impulse controls (frequently acts hyperactive)
''You be in head with Lockie,'' he said, and touched his fingers to his lip again. ''Shssh.''
"Again - he's curious. It's normal. Especially at that age."
Catches me studying him, and gives me a terse grin.
the sense of complete and total isolation.
''Well, of course it is. Don't ask stupid questions. I know you're not stupid, John.''
"Does it hurt if you eat?"
Then John is up, and at the side of the bed, straightening the blanket up and over my body. Hands in my hair. Brushing my hair out of my eyes, which I close at his touch.
''Maybe - maybe we should sit down? I'm not good at these sorts of talks.''
His decline had been incremental, and as I lived with him - it was harder to see the shifting in his size and the dropping of the weight.
I did that. I did that, and they couldn't stop me.
Something that makes me want to grasp Sherlock's lapel and-
Tried to remind myself that he had always shown a fondness for coffee, and what of it?
A 'you can do this!'
I hesitate.
I ignore the impulse to remove my glasses and press against my eyes.
'You know what to do, love. Take off your pajamas and your pants,' the Martian hisses at me, his tongue reaching out to lick my neck. He's licking me, tasting me. Maybe the Martian wants to eat me. I close my eyes and push down my space suit. I pull everything off as the Martian asks. I even take off my wool socks, even though the Martian doesn't tell me to take off my wool socks. Mycroft made me the wool socks. He made them in a class called 'Home EC,' at his old school, and the Martian will get his slime on the socks. I want Mycroft's socks to be clean so I can put them back on again later when everything is DONE.
''Sherlock still with Mrs. Thiesen?''
I close my eyes and repress the anger. Anger at Donovan, or Anderson, or anyone who ever made him feel unworthy at some level.
There is no denying the self-recrimination now. His voice is laden with it.
He looks back up at me, and then down to his hands.
Rouse looks ill-amused.
My rage.
'Disrupted sleeping and eating patterns.'
''Do you want me to stay with you for a bit?''
''I don't want to care about someone else's opinion of me, John. Not if I have to be talking about things that...,'' and my throat feels swollen. ''It's hard enough to think about some of this stuff on my own. It makes me feel...well, you probably can guess it doesn't make me feel good. And if I get upset, I don't want it to be around someone who has any real respect for me.''
Yuri presses his fingers to his temples, his face cringing in sympathy.
NO-WORDS
''I do too,'' he attempts awkwardly, his body tense under my hand. ''I know it doesn't seem like it, but I want to show you that I can. Properly.''
''John, don't,'' he hisses.
''Yes,'' Mycroft whispers.
My breath catches in my throat.
He smelled.
''What?''
A knock at the main door is my only courtesy.
I stop, and repeat the parts of the body I need to clean. Stop and repeat.
I want to cradle my skull against my palms and weep. But not with Mycroft sitting less than two feet away from me.
Not really.
I stare at it while a tousling emotion skips about inside of me, and I don't know why.
“I guess I am off then. You need the shower first? I mean, you do look a tad on the crappy side,” Patrick interjects, pulling me out of my thoughts. “No offense.”
''I want to be alone in my room,'' he murmurs, his voice sounding robotic.
''Are you trying to express that you'll consider leaving if Sherlock doesn't change some of his habits?,'' I qualify, since Sherlock seems incredibly still and unwilling to talk, currently.
Unfortunately, he doesn't smile.
''Of course you're my friend,'' I breathe out quickly, relief flooding my veins.
“Look, Sherlock. This is going to be, as far as I understand it, much more efficient and far less unsettling than therapy. We’re going in, we discuss your current diet, your current health issues, we get a more detailed plan with additional target foods, and we’re out of there. Then we can do whatever we please with the rest of our day.”
Something I can't control, and I realize that there is some ancient fear yelping up inside of me.
I let myself read what I feel I must confront.
And I can't get my damn heart to slow down.
'you haven't done anything
But I've shouted and screamed at him and pushed at him.
Even the old remembrance of that pain could take me back to the edge, now. So I talk, even if I want to say nothing.
AUTHOR’S NOTES: This will be one of the last chapters in which Sherlock *overtly* struggles with a lot of his issues. (Are they gone? Of course not. The operative word is overt. But they won’t be so front-and-center after chapter 43). In fact, in a sense, this chapter is going to be the turning point for him and his obsessiveness with the next few leading to some pretty giant changes in terms of how he sees himself (which will be fleshed out in greater detail in chapter 43).
''What are you doing, V-Victor?,'' and he said my name as if he was trying to recall it, despite the fact that I had introduced myself to him only seconds prior.
Of course it must.
Just douse chips with malt vinegar. Ketchup. A smattering of sea salt and lemon.
What the fuck is wrong with me?
And more than that - he's angry, because he feels like he's failed Toby. Even though the truth of the matter is that Toby would be dead right now if it weren't for Sherlock.
"I mean, in my head - I became a ghost. I crawled up the side of the wall. And I looked down, and I could see I was crying. My body was shaking, and I was crying, and then I focused on the moon, and the blueness. The entire room was blue, John. My face, my hands, the dresser. My bear. And then I wasn't scared anymore because if I was a ghost, nothing could hurt me."
''Good,'' John supplies, securing the hold, securing the blanket around me. ''Not so cold now, are you?''
Things really are that dire.
"It hurts between your legs," I state after I've composed myself well enough to speak without Toby hearing my anger. "And it hurts, inside. Front and back."
''Take a deep breath, and hold it. Can you do that?,'' I interrupt, sensing that he's working himself up.
Cranberry juice. A bottle of Nyquil is off to the side, the blue-green syrup still semi-coating a plastic measuring spoon. I touch it, and determine it's been recently poured, then pick up the bottle.
My throat feels tight. Internally swollen.
''Mycroft would love your afghan,'' I mutter, giving her a mock sweet smile as she emerges from the hallway, holding onto a brown beast of a cat with enormous ears.
For the rest of the day, it doesn't leave me.
''I don't want you to take this away from me, because it's mine! It was my way of keeping it all...from falling apart in my mind. It was my ritual, and I never said I was open to being changed! And I do love myself! This was my sanity when there was NOTHING and no one and you have no right to take that away, John! Not when you cannot even ''conceive'' of why it helps me! Not when it bewilders you at best and terrifies you!''
I push past him, and make my way to my room.
I take a small bite of scone, swallow. Realize I'm actually quite hungry indeed.
The little voice in the back of my mind is telling me: this pain of yours is old, John.
I swallow down the taste of cloying Nyquil before responding.
For several seconds I am shocked into dumb silence.
Then it is dark. Sherlock's frail form is pushed far away from mine, as he is trying to give me most of the space on the bed. I tug lightly with his hand.
''Your intentions are good, and I appreciate your promise. But this is bigger than your intention, especially if you don't know why you did it in the first place!''
''What are you talking about?,'' I whisper.
''I wish I could say,'' I give him a very weak smile. It's all I can do at the moment. ''I know sometimes things hold onto us for a long time, and don't let us go. And then one day we wake up, and the rawness of something...that has hurt us for a very long time...is gone. Or diminished. But I can't tell you why that happens, or what makes one random day the day when it hurts less.''
Shortly after 11 pm, I ascend the stairs. Knock on his door.
''You need to call him back, for starters. It took all his strength to call you initially. And he won't call again. His bloody pride won't allow it!''
''Sherlock, no,'' John says firmly. ''Not now. We are finishing this trip, then we are having dinner, we-''
''I don't want to talk about it,'' and his voice is shuddery and sore. Barely exposed. ''Not with you or anyone.''
''When we get home, I want to run some quick tests. For myself, really, so it won't take more than a few minutes. Then a little late brunch for us both. Maybe some rest afterwards?,'' John tests, and his voice reverberates in my skull like music heard beneath water. Unreal, dream-like - but louder somehow for the distinction. ''Are you for a nap?''
It's quarter to five when I fully awaken.
In and out of here. That's my goal. A quick appeal to Lestrade about how I won't let my temper get the better of me again, and then off to Evelina.
Within a few days I was fairly convinced that he suffered from some sort of eating disorder – most likely bulimia with an excessive amount of exercise thrown into the mix - and the feeling of nameless dread, if not horror, was what prompted me to confront him one dismally cold evening after he had returned from a rowing meet-up, his alumni sweatshirt looking baggy and stained in sweat.
And I take a sip.
I sleep for another three hours, and rouse drowsily. I've never slept this long in my life, not in one day - and when I glance at my bedside clock I'm informed that it's past noon. I crack my neck, relishing the pop and the sudden rush of looseness, and then groggily rise. My hands ghost over my cheeks, my chin. They feel rough, sandy, and I grimace in distaste - remembering that I didn't shave yesterday. My hair also feels damp. Sweaty. I look down and notice an extra duvet on the bed. One that suspiciously looks like nothing I own.
It doesn't make sense. A sulk for a few hours. Until such time as we were able to discuss matters? Yes, I'd understand it. But things are getting weirder as time goes on. Not better.
His baritone voice reverberates in my head. The pressure against my hand has increased. It's not painful, but it's firm.
If voices could bleed, my voice would be bleeding.
Besides, sick or not, struggling or not: he needs his own space. I just have to ensure that the space is safe for him. That he can come to no harm while he decompresses and finds his equilibrium once more.
''You're scaring me! You're scaring the hell out of me!''
They are linked to a very real, very pressing need to have life be controllable and to be in that control.
''Not up, I imagine,'' my face morphing into a frown, I can just tell.
straight in my mind. the logic to show his errors
I look over at Sherlock quickly, something in my throat stopping up.
And he has to use the washroom first.
Another huff.
Sherlock crosses his legs, ties the sash on his gown. Stares at the yellow smiley face on the wall.
While everyone else bustled about their day, Harrison waited to be uncovered from his bed of leaves. Waited for someone to see his tiny outline against the rocks. Waited for someone to come along in rescue, before his remains could be pulled out on the tide.
I stare, consider the offer.
Instructing me to clear a space on the grass, to make sure there was nothing sharp in the immediate area.
-----------------------------------
I take another sip of tea. It burns my stomach and makes my body feel even more hollow and strange. I don't know if I like the sensation, or hate it.
It has a unique bite and an aroma I associate with my adulthood. It's completely safe.
"Is that when he had...hurt himself?," I get out my question in chunks of raw sound; Mycroft's gaze is pained when he meets my line of sight a moment later.
Because he's Sherlock Holmes.
I could understand the pinched look of sickness on his face last night, and this morning, of course. But the flash of fear I am seeing now has not been caused by my previous words. It's a different form of nervousness. More intense, if anything.
My fingers worm into my jacket pockets and glide over the old photograph with the torn edges.
Toby looks back up at me faster now, his teeth making deeper indentations into his bottom lip. His face is scrunched up by the request.
Suddenly Sherlock pulls back and I can see his eyes are owlish and red.
''Peas?,'' I query.
I am mute as I absorb the words.
''Good. Okay. What else?''
I head on over to Tesco's when I'm done work. An agitation resides low in my belly. I scan the magazine aisle, the junk food section. Chuck some tiger bread into my trolley, and go to place some drink mix as well, when I suddenly find myself staring at the glass and orange Ovaltine canister. The child on the canister is smiling. Her milk teeth are polished white, her hair in braided pigtails. The image winsome, wholesome. Like something from a 1950's Norman Rockwell painting. I return the canister to the shelf, suddenly feeling unnerved by the overly sweet image.
''I'm sure they are taking it seriously, Sherlock. Perhaps, they are taking several things seriously right now,'' I venture cautiously, curious to see if he gets my meaning. Curious to see how he'll respond.
I am splinters and static. He is movement and light.
''Stop it! STOP IT!,'' he hisses.
''I'm not going to leave, Sherlock. Certainly not for that. Don't be silly.''
The thought makes me feel the weakest and the saddest.
"I'm sorry I got so angry. I'll wash the floor in the morning, John. I'll make sure I get all the glass."
Everything I had given to me, in lieu of sustenance, was poisoned. And I was expected to grow up on it, and not have it hurt. And that wasn’t sane. It wasn’t!
My temples are throbbing with pain.
''That may be the case, yet-''
Mycroft looks down at his lap, refusing to meet my eyes.
Suddenly my chest feels tight.
I press my face in the sand and want to scream. But I don't.
And like that - just like that - I've been dismissed by Sherlock Holmes.
