He hears Sam sigh audibly.
“Dean.”
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean mutters. “Uh, guys? Wait up!”
“Dean,” Castiel says softly, and Dean wants to grab him and make him say his name, over and over, just like that, tenderly and possessively. “I still haven’t--”
He winces apologetically when Sam actually flinches because yeah, that’s not exactly a sensitive thing to say to the guy who’s actually watched you die about a hundred times.
“Sam, I am being so serious right now,” Dean says as best he can when his face is mashed into the table. “If you don’t stop asking me questions about what happened this weekend, I am going to punch you in your gigantic head. Do you hear me?”
“And here he is!” the man shouts, and Castiel cowers. “The civilian! Dean, goddamnit, what were you thinking?”
“Cas, my life isn’t-- you deserve--”
“Here’s some stuff they wanted you to have,” Garth says, handing it over. “Oh, and...” He reaches into the large bottom drawer and pulls out a large, tan mess of fabric, folded like a flag. Castiel can’t help the grin that spreads across his face as he takes it from Garth and tucks it under his arm.
“I can’t believe I’m going to be the one to kill you,” it says quietly, and with one quick motion, it slits Dean’s throat.
that flashes across Castiel’s face to know he’s crossed a line and spoken of the things they’ve spent years walling off.
“Why not?”
“I’m serious, what’s your deal with that dude?”
“Dean—”
No, no, he does
he wants to shout.
“Man, I used to want to punch Dean,” Kevin says, grabbing ahold of the wheel. “He never let me drive this thing. I
“Cas,” he says again, worried, but Castiel shakes his head.
The world looks the same. Charlie is smiling at him, rubbing her hands together as if to rid herself of residual power on her fingers. Castiel turns his head to see Krissy and Kevin at the table, their hands being wrapped up in splints by Garth.
Castiel wants to say, “You. This. Us.” Instead he just rolls over so that Dean is pinned beneath him instead.
“I did,” he said. “For a couple years. It was fine. But I’m bored, man. This is the longest place I’ve lived, ever, since Mom died. And I need a new space.”
“Garth!” he shouts.
Dean jumps when a chorus of loud barks resounds from inside the house (
Dean stops the car outside the house and Castiel moves to get out, but Dean grabs his sleeve.
“Wow, Cas, sure sounds like a barrel of laughs—”
Claire does find him, but unfortunately it’s in the hands of the three witches. They drag her in, handcuffed, by her ponytail and throw her on the floor in front of David.
Krissy whacks him in the chest. “He’s still too young,” she hisses.
“Um,” Dean glances around at his surroundings. The reason he’s vibrating is because he appears to be on some sort of vehicle moving at top speeds. “I think I’m on a train.”
“There’s the clearing where I brought my first girlfriend. She broke up with me three weeks later.”
It’s sadly true-- Sam had managed to find probably the only girl in the world who doesn’t have to stand on her tiptoes to kiss him, and Dean thinks he should propose on that basis alone. It also helps that she’s unbelievably smart, hilarious, and best of all: two months ago, Sam had told her everything about their life,
“No, he’s not,” Kevin says to her firmly. “He’ll always be too young to you. This is the sign we’ve been waiting for. This means it’s time.” He turns back to David.
“So how do you know Paul?” she asks, practically sitting on top of him.
“Could’ve been actual feds,” Dean points out.
Alastair’s eyes spark with flame the same way Lilith’s did, and then they slowly fade, but Dean doesn’t stop. He keeps bringing the knife down into Alastair’s broken body, now riddled with knife holes. He doesn’t stop when blood spatters his face, or even when Castiel gently calls his name. The look on Dean’s face is manic, animalistic, and Castiel can hardly see the boy who held him tenderly just the previous night. Dean keeps going, stabbing what used to be Alastair, until his arm strength fails him, and then he falls, in a slow arch, onto the ground.
“They’re mostly not very nice,” Ben interrupts, glaring at Aaron. “There are exceptions, of course. I’m sure Garth will tell you all about them eventually, he’s just waiting for the
Dean looks out at the road before him. It’s so dark; all Castiel can see is what the headlights illuminate directly before them. The rest looks as if it had been colored in by black marker.
“They took off into the woods,” Sam says. “You should go after them. Come on, Dad, let’s get Azazel into the devil’s trap.”
“Good,” Dean says again, his voice raw, his throat constricted. “Don’t.”
“I learned from the best.” Castiel’s voice is free of irony and it makes Dean want to reach through the phone and hug him, as chick-flick as it sounds.
“I'm an accountant that doesn't get paid like an accountant,” Cas explains.  “I work from here for my brother Michael’s advertising company. Accounts payable-slash-receivable.  If we're having a boring job competition.” Cas decides that Dean's smile is worth his awkward attempt at humor.
“Guess we’re weirder than we thought,” Cas chuckles, and Dean’s smile echoes his amusement.  “Wow, it’s like, a
“I’ll just be a minute, if you want to get us packed up.”  Cas nods and glances around the room. They don’t have much to pack in the way of clothes, but Cas shoves what they do have that’s clean in his duffle. Cas hears Dean and Sam bickering in the hallway and for the first time since all this happened, Cas wonders what’s going on with Gabriel and Michael.  Are they being held somewhere? Do they have any idea what happened to Cas? He feels like a complete asshole, all but forgetting about his family while trying to get to Dean. He considers at least texting Gabriel, his phone in his hand when he remembers how cautious Sam was when contacting Charlie.
after finally getting her back...
“No,” Dean shakes his head, wonder shining in his green eyes.  “I mean, no one I talked to about mating came close to describing anything that felt like this.”
“Gotta keep you on your toes,” Charlie giggles.  Charlie is an adorable, red-headed beta, and Cas' best friend.  Her scent is so calm and kind everyone immediately takes a liking to her, even if they can’t smell her quite like Cas does.  She wears her nerd status with pride and is a champion for any underdog cause she finds. “Just thought I'd check on you, you know, because you totally need babysitting, not because I’m bored out of my mind.”
“You.” Dean’s scent swells and he crawls away from Cas towards the center of the bed, staying on his hands and knees as he presses his chest to the mattress, canting his hips back in a blatant invitation.
“Michael took care of me, kept me fed and hydrated when I was lucid and… kept me from escaping when I wasn’t.   When it was over he'd do my laundry, and we’d both pretend it hadn't happened.”
“I can’t promise I’ll get it fixed quick, with school back in session,” Dean answers Sam.
“Hey, I noticed Jack seemed a little distracted in my class today, and I think my class is the only one that he actually enjoys.  Has something else happened?”
“Cas, we got wind of another body, we couldn’t just sit around-“
“Yeah, okay,” Dean snorts, “because that’s not unethical, or awkward, or anything.”
with Dean over a cup of coffee like in those trashy stories Meg reads, and his brain just won’t stop.  Naturally, Jack’s test had popped up and now things were nice and awkward, there was no way Dean would consider even going on a single date with him.  Not only was Dean way out of Cas’ league, he was the father of one of Dean’s students.
Dean’s so slick it’s running down Cas’ hand and arm but he can’t get enough of the way Dean writhes and moans, completely lost in his omega’s pleasure. For the moment he's forgotten everything else until the string of babbling from Dean coalesces into words.
“Go on, Sam.”  He gives Sam a little shove, and with one final moment of hesitation Sam walks inside the Roadhouse, a chorus of cheers greeting him as he disappears through the door.  Dean takes in a deep breath and forces it out in a huff, turning to get back in the car just as he hears the telltale
“If you’re sure you can handle it.”  Cas smirks as he climbs out of bed and Dean huffs a satisfied sigh, making no secret of watching Cas get dressed.
“He was arguing with the Novak girl, Claire, during my class period but nothing disruptive.”  Dean sips at his beer. “Why are you calling
“Layla?”
“I assure you, it’s not a kink,” Cas mumbles, his neck flushing red as Dean chuckles and presses a kiss to the skin.  “I was just…trying to assure myself you were okay.”
in his claim.  Dean stumbles back into his wall, letting Cas literally ravage his mouth while his hands rest helplessly on Cas’ shoulders.  A new pain sparks as Cas bites a little too hard at his lips, but he figures a little more blood at this point won’t make a difference.  He starts to feel a bit needy in spite of Cas’ weight on his injuries and the dull ache they cause, mostly because another ache is starting in his gut.
“Didn’t really picture you being a nurse,” Dean shoots back.  Sam’s gaze bounces between them, obviously confused, and Cas turns away to hide his embarrassment.
“You sure?” Cas is looking at him again, his face unreadable. “I mean, I don’t mind waiting.”
“That’s- I’m not-” Dean’s voice cracks and he clears his throat, bringing his voice back to it’s normal pitch.  “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“What I want you both to understand is we have a good life out here. We’re not the oppressed masses begging to be given a chance, but we know what’s happening in the country right now and we want to help.” Cas can scent Dean’s worry about his responsibility, the frustration he feels about this falling on his shoulders.  Cas reaches out to rest his hand on Dean’s knee, trying to soothe him as best he can.
There’s a family playing on the playground nearby, one of the moms pushing a toddler on the swing, the other mom watching a 6 year old climb the jungle gym. A cooler sits on a bright blue blanket, lunch waiting for them on the grass.  Sam’s mind flashes back to another playground, another set of empty swings rocking and food laid out and abandoned.  Of overturned bikes and unoccupied strollers, cars still running but no one to drive them.  Lily’s teddy bear sitting on the cot in the silo.
"Right, yeah."  Dean clears his throat, quickly changing the subject. "What you said earlier, about the, for lack of a better term, ‘outside world’ needing you…”  Layla lets the change of topic go.
“No, you’re absolutely right.”  Cas crosses his arms, staring at the table as he starts talking, unable to stop the words once they’ve started.  “Presenting is supposed to be a small change, a mild fever matched with a heightened libido for a couple days. For me… it felt like the world was turned
“I've got a day job to do, so I'm going to clean up.”
The contrast between the humidity, and Dean's stare, with the air conditioning inside, makes Cas shiver as he kicks off his shoes.  He stops in the kitchen long enough to put the eggs away before heading upstairs to shower. He gets the water running and strips while he waits for it to heat up.  He catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror, trying to see himself with Dean's eyes. He isn't toned into the perfect muscular body, but he's not slim either. His hips have this weird curve to them that he's never liked, but Dean must have seen something to look at Cas that way... Steam starts to catch on the edge of the mirror and Cas steps into the shower.  As he scrubs, he finds his thoughts drifting again to the beta downstairs and his soothing scent.
It’s usually dirty, gross, and generally hard labor, but the routine is comforting in its monotony.  The physical work keeps him in shape, and the focused repetition keeps his mind blissfully empty. Cas realizes that others may see his life as boring; Charlie’s hinted at it a few times, but Cas doesn't mind being boring.  He’ll take boring over bombardment with scents and judgment everywhere he turns.
Jack’s behavior has become tolerable, and Dean is relieved he hasn’t had to email Jack’s father again.  Totally, 100% relieved that he doesn’t have a single excuse to communicate with him in any way.
his phone but he shakily crawls back over to it, quickly deleting and blocking the email before he pulls up messenger.  With trembling hands, he pulls up Meg’s conversation and types.
“Yeah, okay tough guy,” Dean chuckles.
“My father is very controlling,” Dean explains, turning serious.  “Aggressively protective. I don't blame him for it, we lost my mom when I was very young and he had to raise me and my brother as best he could.”  Dean’s scent is darkening, and Cas regrets asking the question. “I'm not angry with him for it, though my brother always gave him grief. I know he wanted what was best for us.  An alpha protecting his pups.” Dean picks up their empty plates, walking them over to the sink. “I was suffocating, though. I needed to get away, do things my way for at least a little while.”
“Mechanical-wise she’s all good, but she needs some more oil."  Dean pats the car with a fond slap of his palm. "Baby's only thirsty."  Cas watches as a drop of sweat makes its way from Dean’s hairline, down the curve of his neck, to the hollow of his throat.
“Of course I do,” Dean scoffs.  “I know our circumstances haven’t been ideal...“
“Dean, I gotta get back to work, are you coming to get me or not?”
“Everything good?” Cas asks anyway.  Dean grins at him.
, and that’s the only reason he’s having trouble focusing.  It’s not that he’s picturing Dean in greasy jeans and a dirty t-shirt, bent over the hood of this particular car, sweaty and determined as his muscles bunch and-
gotten the crap beat out of you.”
“Mmhmm.  That's not suspicious at all.”
. It’s just above Dean’s clavicle, and Cas finds himself drawn to it like a magnet, baring his teeth and taking a deep breath before biting down hard enough to break skin.
here.”
"Hope a simple sandwich is okay."
“Yeah, I uh...that conference I mentioned to you…”  Dean seems embarrassed, though Cas isn’t sure why.
.  He was a father, and that was going to come before anything he would be to Dean.
“Her dead wife,” Sam counters, “and like I said, we were both lonely.  Nice to know that as soon as I get to Heaven I get to be judged by you again.”  Sam’s reply is snarky, but there’s a little bit of a laugh in his tone.
“Think about how messed up I was,” Cas sits forward in his chair, catching Dean’s eye.  “Then you found me and look at me now. Imagine all those other people, hyperosmiac or not, finally knowing what it’s like to be who they’re supposed to be.”  Dean meets his eyes, and smiles.
The world comes to a screeching halt.
“Dammit,” she whines.  “Guess I'll have to find somewhere else.”
“Jessica?"  Dean smirks.  "Yeah, I could totally see that.”
“Alright but next time, I’m driving.”  Dean whimpers at the flash of desire in Cas’ eyes.
“It’s fine,” Cas says with a small laugh.  Dean flushes but follows behind Castiel as they walk towards a small bench nestled amongst the flowers, just on the edge of the water.  “You seem a little surprised that this is what I’ve chosen.”
“You could use some beating around the bush if you know what I mean,” Gabriel mumbles petulantly.  Cas rolls his eyes, giving his cousin his patented heavy bitch face. Gabe’s head falls back with a frustrated groan.  “It's a joke, Cassie. You know, in the time you've lived here, I've seen more omegas than the number of times I've seen you smile.”
“Don’t wanna,” Cas grumbles, even as he extricates himself from Dean’s embrace.  He immediately feels colder, his body already missing Dean’s warmth. Castiel grabs his toiletries and makes his way to the bathroom, showering and brushing his teeth.  He decides to leave his stubble for now, liking how it looks, and makes his way back to the bedroom. Dean presses a quick kiss to his cheek as he passes by for his turn in the bathroom.
Sam turns slightly on the bench to face her, setting his coffee down between them.
“Wow.”  It's one word, but it seems to sum up all Dean wants to say.  Cas looks down at himself, feeling very self-conscious about how grimy he is.
It's so faint it's hard to find, he has to flare his nostrils wide and breathe deep, but it's there.
“Need anything?” he calls out.  Dean looks up and makes no secret about giving Cas a good once-over with his eyes.  Cas shifts on his feet, warming under the attention.
“Yeah, well, guns aren’t the answer to everything,” Charlie pipes up.
The crunching of gravel and the stuttering grumble of an engine that sounds like it needs serious help break the usually peaceful silence.  Bagheera flinches and bolts for the safety of his dog house, Sher Khan opting for the bushes that line the porch. Headlights come into view a short while later, and the car in question rolls to a stop right in front of Gabe’s house.  The headlights turn off as the engine does, and a string of curses in a deep male voice follows. In the dim light of the lone street lamp above the driveway, Cas can barely make out the edge of an older, dark colored car. The smell of exhaust and overheated metal wafts over to meet Cas’ nose.
“Fine, spoilsport,” she huffs.  “So, whatcha doing?”
“Sam and I handled it,” Dean snaps back, surprising himself.  “We’ve been doing this for a long fucking time, Cas.” Dean gestures at the blood.  “And maybe if you weren’t tearing me a new one you’d realize most of this shit ain’t mine.”  Cas’ eyes, still narrowed in anger, track over his body and the different injuries. Dean tries not to shiver under their assessing gaze.  Cas taking a step back to get a good look at all of him draws Dean’s attention to the small mirror on his wall. What he sees startles him.
“You know you love me,” she teases in a sing-song voice.  And yeah, if it weren't for her, he would have gone insane years ago, and she knows it.
“Oh, Castiel wanted to see you.  I believe he’s waiting for you in his room.”  Jack smiles, proud of himself for remembering the message.  Dean manages a smile back even when inside he’s grimacing. Of course this would be the
“I didn’t get to tell him, Sam!  He’s in that place, that
“Been trying not to,” Dean pats the cooler beneath him, "but it'll be nice to have something cold.  Thanks, Cas."
There’s a promise in those words and Dean doesn’t know if he whimpers from his injuries or from the twitch in his pants but the next thing he knows Cas is
“Well, it shows."  Dean sits up a little straighter, looking pleased with the compliment.  Cas tries not to but he finds himself watching Dean again as they eat in silence.  The muscles in his jaw, the flex of his bare arms and chest, his calloused hand as it grabs his coffee.  Even the spread of freckles over his cheeks is a distraction Cas wasn't expecting. Dean smiles at him, a knowing look in his eye.
“I have to find my friend,” Dean mutters, finally succeeding in getting himself off the couch and almost falling over in the process. “I need to talk to--”
Dean shrugs.
“Mind if I join you?” he asks.
“Oh, you’re not getting away that easy,” Alastair grabs Dean, clearly intent on striking him, but Castiel takes a running leap and fastens his arms around Alastair’s neck, bringing the demon down on top of him. Alastair scrambles up and is about to bring his foot down on Castiel’s face when Dean knocks him to the ground, and before the demon probably realizes what is going on, Dean brings the knife down right into his chest.
“That’s too bad,” Dean said. “Here I was ready to bitch about the weather.”
Dean didn’t know what he’d do if he ever saw Jack again. He didn’t know what emotion would win over the others.
“I used to have nightmares about you. About losing you,” Dean said weakly. “You disappearing into a lake or… or just flat out disappearing, leaving us. I never told him that.”
Dean looked at him nervously. “Cas—”
It nearly terrified Dean how much he
“Baby’s first burp! Well—” Dean twisted his head to the side, mouth pulled into a sideways grin that seemed to draw Cas’s eye. “This day just keeps gettin’ better.”
Dean could barely muster his own voice, “How weak?”
Sam watched Dean slowly make his way out of the library with something similar to guilt wracking up his spine, twisting his insides into knots.
Dean was so tired of hearing that from him.
Dean didn’t know how he knew. It was nothing but an instinct, a theory built off of a tethered feeling he couldn’t even describe. Just above his sternum, lodged somewhere deep, was this undeniable sense that there was something off about the whole thing. How Cas survived, how he escaped. This time coming back more damaged, his memory that spanned for millions of years erased.
Dean cleared his throat and stumbled further inside. Immediately, Cas moved to make room on the bed for him, stretching every which way and reiterating the fact that he was only wearing boxers and a t-shirt. Dean’s stomach dropped swiftly.
other than that, but the bubble retreated for the last time, and Dean slowly slid his phone back into his pocket.
“Look, just— go read the note, okay? I left it on your desk, it explains everything. We’ll be back in a few days.”
The rest of the week carried on in a similar fashion, Dean retreating to the shadows every time he was reminded that it wasn’t really Cas taking up the bedroom down the hall. It wasn’t really Cas walking around in pajama pants and eating pizza like it was just your average Sunday, and it was because of this that he didn’t understand Dean’s hovering, didn’t catch on to the jokes Dean made on the regular and had grouchily explained to him years ago.
The blood coated bowl rattled as he spoke, the streaks of violent purple shooting beams up the stretch of Sam’s bedroom walls, caging him in on all sides. There was a hissing noise, like the sound of a soda bottle being pried open amongst the heat of summer, and then the purple was gone and the swirling blood broke way to show a glimpse of fiery orange.
It didn’t take them long to find a diner somewhere deep in the Colorado mountains, the green neon sign flashing
He couldn’t let himself think about how he’d left Cas back in Kansas without even considering that he might just end up missing Dean as much as Dean knew he’d miss him.
It wasn’t until Dean had his hand on the front door that Cas finally caught up to him, his presence a gentle curl of fingers at the bottom of Dean’s jacket. Dean looked down at Cas’s hand and made his way up, eyebrows raised.
“It doesn’t hurt, right. Well, humor me then,” Dean didn’t wait for an answer. He reached for the sterile bandages tossed across the bed and took the seat next to Cas, blatantly ignoring the other man’s defeated sigh. Dean placed a great distance between them, no part of him touching Cas; he intended to keep it that way.
“Well, to be honest, I sorta quit my most recent job.  Kinda why I wound up out here in the middle of nowhere.”
Cas walks into the office he set up in his cousin’s spare bedroom, nothing more than a desk and a couple filing cabinets.  The only personal items were a gifted pencil holder and a picture of his younger self with his dad. It's one of the only things Cas has left of him after his mother purged him from their lives.  As soon as he logs onto the company server his phone starts playing the “Imperial March” from Star Wars. He feels a small pull at his cheeks as they soften into a smile.
“Let’s just get this cleaned up and get home.”  Sam shrugs with a wince, holding his left arm as he follows behind Dean.
hours and I would have been here.  Then maybe you wouldn’t have so arrogantly and
“Cas, you could have told me, man.  Before the threat of imminent death.”
“No, you’re not.  Not yet.”
Cas fluffs out the pillows and turns the sheets down, nodding in satisfaction as he examines the bed.  He freezes in stunned shock when he realizes what he's done. The blankets are fluffed and tucked into a sort of supportive ridge around the pillows, a little funnel that will cradle the person sleeping there.
It's also a relief to scent him, which is strange considering he'd spent most of his life hating his strong nose.  Cas realizes Dean's a beta, none of the musky alpha tinges to his scent. And then Cas has to remind himself yet again that Dean's sub gender doesn't matter, it's not like anything is going to happen…
“It’s
“You know, if you want, I could help you with your chores this evening?  The Impala should rest another day, and I don't want to invade your space without some kind of compensation."  Dean says it quick, hand running through his hair in a nervous tick. Cas swallows the swooping feeling in his stomach because
He pulls on his jeans from the day before, grabbing a clean t-shirt and tugging a blue plaid flannel on over top, not even bothering to try and fix his sleep mussed hair before making his way out to the kitchen.  The coffee can isn’t on the counter, so Dean goes into the pantry.
“Gabriel, I am a full grown adult.” Cas ignores Gabe's snort of laughter, “and I've been on this farm with you for years now.  I can take care of it while you're gone.” He raises an eyebrow at Gabe over his coffee and Gabe sighs, running a hand through his long, golden brown hair.
“A shine?  Charlie he hates me.”
“I do.”  Jack pauses for a moment, considering that answer.
They spend the rest of the night basking in their new mated status, falling asleep early and rising to watch the sunrise together.  Castiel washes their clothes and the soiled bedding while Dean makes them breakfast. Breakfast they end up eating cold when Dean senses Cas’ not so subtle appreciation of his ass and drops to his knees, Cas naturally returning the favor.  Another shower to clean up that mess, and they’re finally dressed and ready to go.
“Sorry to disturb your beauty sleep,” Sam scoffs, “but I need you to come pick me up from work in an hour.”
“You know,” Dean follows Cas out of bed, tucking himself in close, knowing his nudity would affect Cas.  “I did just take out a whole pack of wolves. Betcha I can handle one little angel.” Cas just smiles, tugging himself out of Dean’s grasp and moving towards the door.
“I know, man.”  Dean adjusts his grip on the wheel.  “Used to be booze and chicks after a hunt like this, battle scars and all.”
“Aw, you're not supposed to agree with me!” she whines.
“You’re so, so…”  Dean’s haze is drawn away from the macabre image he makes and back to Cas.  He can see Cas’ jaw muscles clenching beneath his skin, and in his balled fists Dean sees his fury starting to break.  After all these years he knows most of Cas’ tells, seeing as he’s been the cause for almost all of them at some point.
that he belongs to Dean now, and the thought floods every part of him with such elation he’s sure he’s going to break apart at the seams.
“He’s my son’s math teacher,” Cas admits.
It's soothing, listening to the muted sound of classic rock and Dean's singing voice as he works.  In a weird way, it's making him more productive, catching up on projects he'd been behind on for weeks.  His phone rings again, but it's only Gabe so he lets it go to voicemail. All his cousin would do is fret over the animals, and Cas doesn't want to try and explain his mood to him; Gabe wouldn't let it go as easily as Charlie.
but every new smear of blood has Dean’s heart racing and his groin throbbing.
nights.
floods into Dean’s scent as he leans forward, tongue tasting the entire spread of skin from Cas’ shoulder to neck until he settles on a spot just above the base of his neck.  Where no shirt collar will ever cover it. Cas whimpers his assent as Dean bares his teeth, his skin damp from saliva and sweat. There's a small burst of pain, then a weird sensation like warm liquid running through every nerve ending, starting from the bite and flowing outward until even the tips of his toes are saturated. Dean laps at his bite in a primal way, cleaning the wound and pressing his nose against the injured flesh while growling deep in his chest.
It helps that he loves Cas.  Cas whose frustration is driving him hard right now, straining the limits of the bed.  Cas’ end is approaching, Dean can tell by the tension in his back and the urgency in his grunts but Dean is unable to drop his hand to help himself reach the finish line at the same time.
“I know,” Cas sighs, hanging up the phone as she giggles.
“Wow, this is gonna take some getting used to,” Dean chuckles, gently brushing a hand through Castiel’s hair.  “I mean, dude, I can
“My bedroom door locks and I know how to use a shotgun,” Cas deadpans, hoping his face will match up to his bluster.  While that is a true statement, it’s not like Cas wants to use the gun. Dean stares in open-mouthed shock for a moment before he grins.
make Cas’ insides do a weird dance.
, swirling with arousal and love. Cas’ alpha isn’t fighting to drive him into a haze or clouding his mind this time, he knows with aching clarity what’s about to happen and it’s a bit terrifying but it’s what he wants.  What they both want.
and he was about to let him walk away.
in danger of being pummeled by an angel.  And not in the sexy way.
have you done, boy?” a voice booms from the house, and both of the brothers stop what they’re doing and turn towards it.  There’s too much emotion coming to Cas through Dean’s bond so he tries to shut down Dean’s flow to him and feed calm back.  He doesn’t think it’s working, judging by Dean’s scent which is anything
THEYVE MET WHOOO HOOOO
Dean leaves the windows open for good measure.
“We’ve been waiting for you.”  Dean’s scent gives off surprise as she gets closer.
“Not exactly the word I’d use,” Dean hums darkly.  Cas is surprised he's not more nervous, but he has to admit he kind of likes the attention.  Most people get a whiff of his overcharged ‘alpha-ness’ and turn right around. Having someone express interest was...nice.  Especially someone like Dean. Cas gestures behind him at the house with his free hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
surrounds them.  “Ugh, alright, we better get out of bed before I change my mind.”
It isn’t there either.
“But you just said-”
“What can I do for you, Mr. Winchester?”  Dean ignore the attitude in Jack’s voice.
“You did-“
, you shouldn’t even be this injured, you ass.”  Cas in his annoyance bites down on Dean’s nipple at the same time he thrusts his clothed hips into Dean, the fabric of his dress slacks pressing into Dean’s naked crotch.  The friction pulls a moan from Dean and a self satisfied hum from Cas, who continues his assault on Dean’s skin. Dean’s never sure which way things will go between them, as far as who’s being fucked, neither of them have a preference usually and it just depends on the mood.  Tonight it seems Cas is revved up and ready to
“No, I don’t want to be a bother,” Cas insists.  Sam isn’t going to let this go, so Dean figures he might as well step in.
“Hey, Cas, what’s up?” she asks, a cup of ramen next to her and an energy drink on the other side.  He raises an eyebrow.
“We’re getting old.”  Dean huffs a laugh at Sam’s words.
“Lucky, yeah.  Maybe Jack gave us back our weird God hero mojo.”  He stands to go wash his wound in the sink and Sam tenses, the mention of what happened with Jack the first acknowledgement he’s gotten from Dean that any of it happened at all.
I apologize profusely for taking so long but here it is at LAST!! The next update shouldn't be quite so delayed *nervous laugh*
“Exactly.  Which is why he wound up in heaven.  Anyway long story short Cas offered himself in Jack’s place if the Empty would let Jack go.”  Sam runs a hand over his face, unable to stop his half smile.
“Pleased to meet you, Dean,” she nods, shaking his hand.  She turns and offers her hand to Cas, who feels slightly intimidated by her.
“SAM WINCHESTER!  You best get yourself in here before your beer gets warm, I got some folks who are dying to see you!”  They both turn to look and see Charlie,
When Eileen finishes her coffee, the two of them drive back to the Bunker, the hallways and rooms silent save for the hum of the air scrubbers and the echo of their footsteps as they make their way to the kitchen.  Sam sometimes misses the bustle of having other hunters around, but now that everyone is safe from a vindictive deity they’ve all decided to find more permanent homes in this world, scattering across the country to make their own way.  They still call from time to time, there’s still things hidden away in rooms that Sam hasn’t managed to upload to the online database, but for now it’s just him and Dean and the occasional visits from family.
“No, he’s always pissed at you.”  Sam’s smirk is much too smug for Dean’s liking and he scowls at his brother.
“Give me a minute, I'll get your dinner.”  They meow again in protest when Cas opens the door, nudging them gently with his foot to keep them outside.  Grabbing the cat food, he fills two bowls and flips on the porch light before going back outside. He sets the bowls down and chuckles as the cats immediately go to work devouring the food.  “Greedy bastards,” Cas huffs, walking across the front porch to sit on the bench swing.
“We met in a grief counseling group, Dean.”
He goes to work making the bed, focusing on the task to help even out his scent again.  He hasn't been this all over the place in a long time, not since he'd started taking his current suppressors.  Was Dean on his own suppressors? If his meds are interacting with Dean’s it might explain why Cas can't level out his scent, or scent Dean at all.  Cas can’t think of anyone else on a prescription strong enough for that kind of side effect; it's not like he has experience with this.
he missed Dean's smile.  “Your headaches and mood swings have been better since being around me, right?  Things are easier to manage, they don’t put you on edge as much?” Cas opens his mouth to object and finds that he can’t, Dean has a point.  He’s so used to being alone in this he’s forgotten Dean has the same condition. Dean knows better than anyone the effects, and how they would have drastically changed since they met.  Sensing victory, Dean grins even wider, but Cas still protests.
Cas is standoffish?  He goes to bite out a retort, then stops himself when he realizes Dean is right.  It's what comes naturally for Cas, shutting down around strangers. Dean is watching him over the rim of his coffee mug, green eyes patient.
“Cas, what-“  Cas steps into his space and cuts off his words with a scathing look.
“I know, Jack.  But I think… I think Dean needs more time.”
God, what was
“Shut up, Sam.”  Sam smiles but falls quiet, and now Dean is sort of wishing the drive back was just a bit longer.  Sam’s right, Cas is
“Wait,” Sam says, piecing together the memories, “Cas wasn’t taken right away, obviously so there were terms to the deal, I’m guessing?”
“You could stop beating around the bush, then you wouldn't be here to smell me,” Cas shoots back.  He puts some fake, smug superiority in his voice, covering his slip in control the way he always does.
“Well, yeah, people with hyperosmia have heightened instincts and stronger scent responses.  Most alphas, as you know better than me, smell heavier, like a woodsy smell, abrasive. I don't know if anyone has told you, but you… it's like a sandalwood, it's… comforting.”  Just like this beta’s scent is for me. Cas shifts in his chair under Dean’s gaze.
“I guess I just always pictured you with me.”  His can feel his cheeks flush, embarrassed as fuck and ready to just turn and walk back to the Roadhouse, but instead of laughing or, well, saying anything, Cas reaches out to touch his forearm, gently encouraging him to sit on the bench.
“She tended to… disappear.”  Cas has accepted his childhood and moved on, but Dean’s scent is turning sour with genuine anger.
“This alpha’s name is Castiel,” Cas snaps.
“I like your name,” Dean blurts.  “It’s...different.”
“I didn't realize how much I needed that."  Cas surprises himself with the admission but doesn't back down from it.  “It's been awhile since I've had a good laugh. Or a reason to.” Dean finishes off his coffee, stands and starts clearing the table.
walking into the bunker library to find Dean slumped over the table, blood all over the place and an empty whiskey bottle next to him.  Miracle was barking furiously as he paced around Dean’s still form like he was trying to help.  Sam rushed to his brother’s side to see Cas’ name mostly carved into the wood of the table by their initials, realizing Dean’s knife had slipped and sliced his hand open.  Sam whipped off his flannel and wrapped his brother’s hand, but he had no way to stem the flow of tears running down Dean’s face.  Dean’s words echoed through the library, haunting Sam in the echoes of his own pain.
“You remember when Jack died, the first time?”  They share a bemused half smile at the fact that their lives will always need a clarifier for that.  “Cas went to get him in heaven while we worked with Lily Sunder.   Apparently, there were complications.”
“Shouldn’t you take Bobby?  Someone they know instead of a complete stranger?  I’m not equipped for all this political nonsense.” Ever since they got to Central the only thing that kept him from completely shutting down in a panic was getting back to Dean. Now that he’s here he never wants to leave this bedroom, much less march into a community of socially oppressed people like he’s some kind of hero.  Dean’s nose flares at the fear Cas knows he’s giving off, and his smile fades into something deeper, more serious.
Gathering up all the tests and everything he’ll need for the weekend, Dean decided to call it a day, stopping by the main office to check out and walking to his car to head home.
“Sammy, you picked up a chick who was mourning her dead husband?”
Jessica proves to be a very charming tour guide, even if she is a bit sassy. The square they’re in is the equivalent of downtown: the main community services, like schools and the governing body sit right in the center of town. The Civic Center where they stop for lunch is everything a community center should be; Cas can see many town meetings, plays, and other events being held there. People crowd around them a bit as they eat off of a community potluck, dozens of people with varying scents all crowding in to meet Dean.  Cas doesn't mind too much that he's mostly ignored, aside from a few curious inquiries from people. Dean is handling the attention well and it gives Cas a sense of pride. His mate is going to be something great to these people, and he can't wait to see it.
“No, it's fine,” Cas blurts, “you, uh, can come up to the porch.”  Cas turns for the house to hide his burning cheeks, hoping the whole serial killer thing isn’t true.  Now that he’s paying attention his own scent is a little pungent, and he forces himself to calm down. By the time they reach the porch Cas has managed to quell his panic.  Staying near the porch swing, Cas points at the power outlet on the wall by the front door. “You can use that one."
“Hey, can I get some help?”  It takes Cas an embarrassingly long time to realize the deep voice is talking to him.
A click and more mumbled curses, followed by the creak of a door that needs some oil, and the sound of the hood opening.  It’s quiet for a moment, then Cas jumps when the hood closes with a definitive ‘shit’ from the man.
Charlie calls to update Cas on the weird fugitive situation but she doesn't talk long.  Their supervisor Dick Roman made it into work on time. Cas and Dick have a not so great past, and as a result, Dick keeps a close eye on Charlie for no other reason than her being Cas’ friend.  A series of amusing puns on Dick’s name texted to him throughout the day keep him smiling at least.
“I've heard of that condition in betas, but an alpha?”  Dean’s eyes widen. “Your scent— that makes more sense now.”
thing.  Sam won’t ever forget the image of her bemused look and raised eyebrow, the words
“Dean Winchester.”  Cas can’t see where the voice came from, so he’s assuming it’s from someone behind the gate.
There’s a feeling all of a sudden, a whisper and a sense of not being alone, but just as quickly as it appears it feels warm, like family, and he
you…”  Cas is desperate to feel the same thing, to know what’s going on in Dean’s mind, and Dean smiles, his eyes opening to reveal almost black iris’ lit up in amusement.  “Okay, alpha, I know. It’s your turn.” Cas doesn’t have time to find it strange that Dean apparently read his mind before Dean is baring his neck, scent submissive and open. Cas leans forward, a little grunt of pleasure from Dean a small reminder that they’re still joined together, and presses his nose to Dean’s skin. He drags his lips and nose along Dean’s freckles, taking in the way Dean’s breath hitches when he finds a spot that smells
Because Dean’s always wondered this himself, and he could never seem to grapple with time long enough to get an answer. It all just blurred together, in the worst way, in the
“I just need some air.” Was all Sam said, no quick retort, no flustered laugh, and it only took an instant for Dean to feel his gut twist with apprehension.
And finally, Dean thought about Cas.
“It’s not so blank anymore.”
“Cas,” He gasped out, choking on nothing, and the silence finally fell around him. Dean opened his eyes, fear freezing in his lungs. “Cas?”
“Dean,” Sam frowned. “She’s here to—”
Dean didn’t really know what he was expecting to see as he pulled up to the only laundromat in Longmont, but finding Cas barreling it out with some old lady just outside the entrance definitely wasn’t something he’d been prepared for.
He swiveled his head over to Sam, wanting an explanation, but his brother’s eyes were loud in their unease, and Dean had no time to prepare himself before Patience was pressing two fingers to either side of Castiel’s head. Between Patience’s eyes closing and Cas’s flying open like worn shutters, a second passed, vibrations spilling into the air.
If he had just a handful of seconds against Dean’s years. If he could still recall what a nervous mess Dean had been as he’d slid the tape over to Cas in the middle of a diner in Ohio. How Dean’s gaze had never left the table top, and his hands had reached self consciously for the salt shakers even before Cas could take it and blink up at him with a silent question of
“Okay.” Cas said, giving one hell of a nod, eyes prickling with amusement.
He didn’t say anything for a moment, and then, almost too quiet to even hear, “It’s nothing.”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I had a senior citizen for a little brother. You maybe wanna turn the music up for the people who wanna live a little?”
“Shut up, Sam.”
“Yeah, we’re still on,” Cas replies with a small, close-lipped smile.  Okay, a grimace, he‘s grimacing, but he'd bear the outing for Charlie’s sake.
“Look, Sam was here, it was just a couple wolves, no big deal-“ Dean tries.
One sentence, and his blood runs completely cold, a terrifying panic gripping him.  He drops his phone, scooting away from it and falling out of bed, continuing to scoot till he’s backed into the corner of his room.  He hugs his knees, shutting his eyes and trying to breathe.
“Yeah, I suppose.”
Shaking his head he clears those thoughts away.  All of that is behind him now, left behind on Earth where he doesn’t need to worry about it any more.  Sure, his soul will bear those scars, but like Bobby said, time works differently.  Maybe here, if he lets himself, he’ll be able to heal where he couldn’t on Earth.  He continues to drive, heading in no particular direction, the road simply taking him where it wants him to go.  After a while he comes to a bridge and he gets the feeling like it’s where he should stop so he does, climbing out of the car and looking around.  It feels so
“Lookin good, Sammy.”  Sam’s well enough to roll his remaining eye at Dean which Dean takes as a good sign.
“Hey, Cas.”  His voice is thick, which is stupid because he doesn’t have a voice box to get crushed by nervously tense muscles as he tries to swallow his heart back into his chest.  Cas’ head tilts slightly, like he can
“Thanks,” Dean grunts as he stands, making Cas swallow hard, “but I've got to use a specific kind.  She's an older gal, she can't have just anything."
“Ah, makes sense.”  Cas stands there stiffly as Dean scrambles for something else to say, and when no words seem to come to him Cas fidgets slightly before picking up his bag.
“We’ve been out here a long time, Cas.  Long enough to have found ways to acquire more comforts than you might expect.”
“Dean,” Cas repeats.  “A lot easier to swallow than Castiel.”
“No, wait!” Dean blurts, pushing himself to his feet suddenly.  Cas turns back to face him with a bemused look. He has a dusting of stubble over his cheeks and shadows under his eyes, and he just looks
Dean nearly knocks his head against his own desk.
When they've finished eating what little they could with the stream of visitors, Jessica extricates Dean and Cas from the crowd, leading them back out onto the main street. It turns out the actual living spaces stretch much deeper into the forest, houses and bungalows going on for a few miles. As they walk, they pass by a thriving farm, and Cas immediately feels homesick at the smells of earth, animals, and fresh harvested plants.  Dean is there at his side immediately, nudging his shoulder, and Cas ducks his head with a smile.
“Is your brother Sam?” Cas asks.
Okay, full chapter, here we go!  Just some more character introduction and establishment, the next chapter things are going to start moving XD
“We uh, haven’t made it official but, yeah.”  Cas flushes and nods. “Name’s Castiel, or Cas.”  Dean's scent fills with affection and Cas does his best to ignore it before he blushes further.
“Huh?”
Cas sets the controller on the coffee table before heading to his room, setting his bag next to his laundry hamper and shucking his clothes, pulling on a pair of sweatpants and falling into bed.  As weird as his day had been, Cas was feeling torn between the kid in the living room and the man with the green eyes. Being Jack’s father would always come first, there was no doubt in his mind about that, but Jack was getting older, and in a couple years he’d be off to college.  Cas hadn’t wanted anything for himself since Jack had come into his life, but then he’d met Dean and suddenly he found himself
To all of you who kept asking and begging for updates— thank you for giving me the motivation to actually keep working on this.  I really wanted to write this story and I was so close to giving up on it, so thank you thank you thank you <333
Eileen responds, correcting him with a smile.  “Uneventful.  Boring even.”
“Not everyone sees it that way."
“Yeah me neither but, uh, yeah, kinda stuck with this one I guess.”  Sam dabs disinfectant on Dean’s wound, deciding to go for broke and try and get Dean to talk.
“No,” Dean snaps, pushing to his feet.  “No not this time, this time it’s different Sam.  This time he-”  Dean’s voice gets stuck in his throat, and he clears it, dropping his chin to his chest as he breathes through it.  “We were trapped, Sam, backed into a corner with no way out and that was it.  Death is pounding on the door,
Dean wakes up suddenly, disoriented to the point he almost falls out of bed.  He’d been dreaming about a bar, and about teaching Castiel how to play pool. It was a nice dream, and yeah, maybe it was a
“I've got a toolbox in my trunk, so I can get myself on the road by this afternoon.”  Dean's tossing some spices in the pan of sauteed veggies, grabbing the bowl of scrambled eggs.  “Don’t want to be in your hair any longer than I need to.”
“I assure you, the way we make love is not-“
“Oh, fine.  Hey, can I show you something?  I finished a client’s order last night all by my lonesome and a week early.  Want to make sure I didn’t miss anything.” Cas smiles. Even though it sounds like Charlie is bragging, he knows her well enough to know she's simply stating a fact.  Charlie is an artist with computers, and she earned her right to brag. “It’s the video for the Museum of History, and strangely enough there’s no one in the office yet to show it to.  I mean, when did I become the responsible one?”
“Come on, there’s a room where we can talk in private.”  Layla’s scent is warm and inviting, and Dean nudges Cas to get him walking again. They follow Layla down a long hallway to an office, a candle burning and giving off the scent of nutmeg and cinnamon. It reminds Cas of pumpkin pie, comfort food he and Michael used to bake together as kids, and immediately he's set at ease. The office furniture is soft and comfortable looking, Layla gesturing for them to sit on the couch as she sits in a chair across from them.  The coffee table between them is bare, but photos of the woods adorn the walls and make the room feel warm.
Yes guys.  This is real.  It’s an update.
Cas’ eyes are slits, the blue barely visible but still shining through them.  “I told you there were at least 15 members living there.”
is what Cas calls it; Jack knows it’s referencing a movie but it isn’t one he’s seen yet.  After discussion and the input of everyone involved they fix the glitches, and things have now stabilized into this replication of Earth but better.
“Guess it doesn't hurt to check,” Dean admits.  Cas leads him over to the garage, the metal screeching as Cas slides it open to reveal his car and the other supplies stored in there.  Dean barks out a laugh, grinning from ear to ear. “Wow, it's even painted gold. Were you a pimp before moving out here?”
“What's wrong with my car?” Cas frowns.  Dean clears his throat, trying to hold in his amusement, but Cas catches the mirth beneath the surface.
“Yeah,” Sam snorts.  “Now it’s booze and bandages.”  Sam picks at his torn sleeve. “You know, Cas is gonna be pissed.”
, like I had been blind and was suddenly able to see.”
“Oh!  Right, yeah, I, uh, combed through the County teacher’s handbook backwards and forwards, along with the teachers union contract...oh!  And checked for any previous civil suits filed in the county. Basically, there’s nothing there. You can totally go hunt down that DILF Mr. Milton!”  Dean’s insides are doing something weird, a mix of excitement and anxiety giving him a stomach ache.
sits down next to him.
“I kinda feel like I should get your autograph or something.  You seem kinda famous.”
Dinner that night consists of a movie (Tremors: A Cold Day In Hell) in the Dean Cave and Kansas City barbecue from a local restaurant.  They talk, they laugh at the awful movie, and for a brief moment it’s a little bit of that
As his stomach starts to grumble for lunch, he considers calling Charlie back.  Lying to her about Dean isn't sitting right with him; she's his confidant and like a little sister to him, and he never keeps secrets.  A small selfish voice in his head convinces him he wants to keep Dean to himself, at least for a little while longer. After all, Dean would be gone by evening, then he could talk all he wanted about the beautiful stranger without fear of being overheard.
Knowing it’s probably just another one of those annoying porn spams, something makes Cas open the email anyway.
“Need to show off your own amazing cooking?” Dean follows at a much calmer pace, refilling his cup with some ice from the freezer.
“Yeah, but Dean you gotta admit, this time he definitely has every right to be.”
“You sure you’re okay-“  Dean cuts Sam off with a wave.
“I’ll let you go, grumpy pants,” Charlie laughs.  “We still on for Thursday?” Charlie tries to get him out of the house at least once a week- this Thursday they're going bowling of all things.  Cas is already dreading the smell of the place.
“I know, Sam, look at it in all its ramshackle glory.”  Sam climbs out of the car and takes in the building with an appraising look.  There’s music coming from the building now, voices and laughter and Dean knows what he’s going to find when he walks in.  Friends, family, everyone he wants to see, and who wants to see him.  Except… “Wonder if Ash had a hand in making this new heaven,” Sam’s excited, eager to see everyone and he starts to walk towards the door.
“Family is family, though.  Can't help being related to them, just have to make due with what you've got.”  Something in Dean’s voice as he says that screams family drama issues, but Cas lets it go in favor of eating.  He hums, thrilled at the burst of flavor and shoving another bite in right after.
dream, too, but whatever, Dean couldn’t control his subconscious.  The harsh ring of his phone pierces his eardrum, and he grabs for it, jabbing at it with his thumb till he answers the call.
Dean is sitting on a metal cooler with his head bowed, the sweat soaking through his shirt and making it cling to his skin.  Cas catches Dean’s scent again, still very faint, but now that he's found it once it seems easier to pick it out of the air. Right now it's mixed with the bitter tang of frustration.  When Dean looks up as he approaches, his face breaks into a smile that Cas can't help but return.
about this anyway?”
They stumble inside the bunker an hour later to find Mary and Jack reading in the library.  It’s surreal still, having a family to come home to, but Dean hopes he never gets used to it.  Though he’ll never admit it to anyone he savors the warm surprise that spreads through his system every single time.  As soon as Mary looks up and sees them she jumps up and rushes towards the stairs with obvious worry in her eyes.
”  Cas snaps his hips up hard, grinding into Dean as he comes and Dean snaps, spilling over Cas’ fist and both their stomachs as Cas empties inside him.
“What do you mean, there’s no one there?” Cas asks, finishing with his emails and preparing to work on his spreadsheets.
“No, of course not,” Dean assures him.  “I’m just going over some lesson plans.”  Cas still seems hesitant, so Dean tries his best disarming smile.  “Take a load off, Cas.” Cas hesitates for a moment more before setting his bag down next to Dean’s table, dropping into one of the empty chairs.  Dean sits back down, pulling his planner closer to him so Cas has room to set his coffee down.
“No, I, uh, I’m waiting on my brother, he’s running a bit late,” Dean explains.
“Alright, you big strong alpha you, I leave my little slice of paradise in your capable hands.”  Gabe ruffles Cas’ hair and finally walks out the door. Cas runs his hand through his flyaway dark hair, though he has to admit it’s pretty pointless to try and fix it.  He stands to see Gabriel off, watching as his cousin’s old pick-up pulls out of sight down the quiet country road. Gabe is heading to Plant City for some sort of livestock and equipment show, leaving Cas to tend the farm on his own for four days.
**EDITED 3/25/2020
“It does?”  Cas is surprised this beta even knows about his problem, let alone understands it.
“What did you do?” Cas amends, taking a bite of his own food.
He will never,
“Hey, boy,” Dean chuffs.  Eileen follows shortly behind, handing him the medical supplies with a soft squeeze of Sam’s shoulder.
and it’s a sensation he’s still adjusting to, even after the few years they’ve been sleeping together.  Cas doesn’t do anything half assed, when he makes love to Dean it’s
Eileen brushes her hair out of her face so she can drink from her own cup of coffee, smiling up at him when she notices him watching.  It’s only been a few days, and although Sam continues to ask himself how to move on, he already has his answer.
and Dean isn’t complaining.  He isn’t ashamed to say he likes it rough and he knows Cas is able to be practically
Their drive away from the omega camp is just as quiet as their trip there. Dean is nervous but motivated, and in spite of all the uncertainty headed their way, Cas draws strength from the omega at his side.
May make some small edits to this chapter after it posts.
Cas climbs the steps out into the early evening, pausing when a few meows sound from the two tiny dog houses sitting on the porch.  A black cat and an orange cat climb out of the houses, tails in the air, demanding Cas’ attention. Gabe had fed them regularly enough they stayed on as mousers, and he'd managed to catch them and get them each neutered last year.
“Now, we go back to the Roadhouse and see your family.”  Cas pushes himself to his feet and Dean reaches out and grabs his hand, surprising himself in the process.
“Been doing it my whole life,” Dean nods, glancing at him in the mirror.  “You seem surprised.”
“Okay, so don’t get mad at me or anything but after our last conversation where you ‘totally didn’t’ talk about Jack’s dad I...did some digging.”
.  Dean begins to arrange his breakfast, and Bobby walks in, smelling of engine grease.
“Interactive literaturists,” she corrects.
Musky alpha arousal spread into the bathroom, and Cas’ hands are moving downward before he has a chance to stop and think about it.  He doesn't want to think about it, he just... wants. His soap slick fist closes around his hardening cock, the scent of his arousal thickening in the air.  Cas closes his eyes and lets his imagination take over. He feels Dean’s lean chest pressing against his, muscled arms around his torso. He sees himself bending his head to Dean’s neck, drinking in that glorious clean, sweet scent.  He imagines kissing Dean’s neck, tasting the scent at its source, getting drunk on it. His other hand reaches down to wrap around the base of his cock, his knot already forming beneath his fingers.
So instead, Cas laughs, a real laugh, that bubbles up from out of nowhere.  It starts small, but when Dean joins in it devolves into a fit of the giggles.
"We have doctors who know what's best for omegas, who know the difference between an omega and a beta pregnancy.  It's just safer here." Layla goes on to explain. Layla nods, glancing out the window. Cas follows her gaze to see two small children playing together at a park across the street.  Two women are sitting on a bench nearby, watching fondly, one cradling her swollen belly.
, just driving in silence and hoping for this
“And you’re totally sure there’s no rule I’d be breaking?”
“Something like that.” Cas glances over his shoulder when Dean steps out of the building, hitching his bag up on his shoulder and embracing Layla fondly.
Dean smells sweet, but not cloying and overpowering so like most sweet scents are to Cas.  Instead, it's refreshing, like a clearing away of all the other olfactory crap Cas can never shake.
“I do, Cas.”  He’s clinging tighter to Cas now, green eyes wide and scent strong and Cas sobs on his next words but he doesn’t care.  He’s needed to say them for so long but was afraid to even think them.
“Hey, Sammy.”  Dean’s voice is hoarse from disuse, but it’s more than he’s said to Sam since the hand cutting incident.  Sam turns and gets Eileen’s attention.  He signs for the medkit and she nods, turning from the kitchen to head for the infirmary, Miracle following happily behind.  Sam sits across from Dean at the table, his chest bursting with questions but he manages to keep them to himself.
“Gabe took a little longer getting out the door than he should have.”  Cas starts the task of digging through his emails, sorting out the ones to ignore from the important ones.
“You’re so stupid sometimes,” he breathes.  “You don’t think, you just…” Cas trails off as Dean reaches between them to undo his tie, pulling the now blood stained satin out from around his neck and dropping it to the floor.
“So, dating, all that jazz, never crossed your radar?” Dean asks, trying too hard to be casual.  Cas swallows hard, sitting up straighter in his chair.
Between ignoring Cas for his own sanity and getting ignored right back for the past week, Dean hadn’t exactly had time to introduce Cas to the Impala. The closest he’d gotten was shouting
But the words don’t come out like they should, not like Dean planned they would.
The music stopped abruptly.
Which— true. It was true. But Dean didn’t need Cas to know that.
“I don’t know, Sam. I was a little too freaked out to play twenty questions with the guy!” Dean loosened his tie with a grunt, eyes heating up. “Fuck,” He breathed, the feeling at the pit of his stomach all too familiar, the stench of the hospital clawing up a memory that immediately made  him double over, head in his hands. Dean had never mentioned it again, just like he swore he wouldn’t, but when his eyes met Sam’s it felt only inevitable that he blurted out, “This is Lisa and Ben all over again.”
Sam didn’t say anything else, but he kept his eyes trained on Dean, waiting for something. Waiting for
Dean staggered sideways, suddenly staring through anger so prominent he could feel it at the back of his throat, flaring behind his nostrils. There was panic too, mangled and distorted somewhere in the mix. That familiar wave of fear that had been following him around for days now, reminding Dean of everything Cas had forgotten, the feelings that had been ripped clean from him before Dean could even speak his own.
But then Cas’s questions got harder; revealing, forcing Dean to actually think and press into his own skin just to rip out answers.
Dean didn’t know what to make of it, but it did make him nervous. Made him stand there and look at Cas with wide eyes, unable to move, not
As always my Twitter is @ricochetdean and don't be shy to come say hi <33
Humiliated and drunk off white hot pain, Dean ended up getting cornered into his own backseat. He crawled over the leather with a pout on his face, dried blood making his face itch, and he honest to god whined when Eileen slid into the seat beside him and Sam took off down the road without even trying to be mindful of the new break line.
“You like nuts in your pie?” Castiel asked slowly, painfully innocent, and too many things had happened at once— Dean could barely keep up with it all.
Dean smiled wide and obnoxious, forcing Cas to sigh. It was almost like the old Cas, the way he looked exasperated and stretched thin until the moment his eyes followed the tilt of Dean’s mouth. Then, those eyes were crinkling around the corners with a shameful fondness he forced away immediately, and Dean was left blinking in a stupor.
But this hug wasn’t like the ones they shared before diving into the fire, uncertain whether they’d ever see each other again. It wasn’t all pressure and warmth, reluctant to pull away, determined to leave an impression; but rather gentle in a way that proved to be unraveling Dean faster than anything.
It was Cas remembering standing all night under a lonely street lamp and gazing at Dean in a pink hued bar on what they both thought to be his last night on Earth, but the memories were fractured where it mattered and in Cas’s mind Dean wasn’t a part of any of it.
Dean lolled his head sideways, teeth gritting with annoyance before all too easily slipping into a sarcastic smile.
Dean gave him the universal sign to
Dean sighed. “We’re a couple of dumbasses aren’t we?”
“We’re just wondering if there was anything found left at the scene. Anything that could explain what those people saw.”
Only Cas didn’t seem to think he’d get this far, and for a few dragging seconds he couldn’t think of a response.
embarrass me.”
Castiel shook his head, mouth pinching irritably.
” Castiel asked wearily. Dean sighed.
Dean looked up at her, grateful. He nodded. His head bumped against Miracle’s nose.
That was all Dean had said. All he’d dared to let slip.
Color rose in Castiel’s face, deep and honey-warm, and when Dean finally found the sense to drop his hand, it felt as though every knuckle weighed a thousand pounds. Dean curled his hand by his side, fingers creaking.
“We don’t know the first thing about that place, Dean!” Sam argued, no longer willing to indulge in the unreasonable.
Dean stood restlessly as Cas slouched with relief. The scar on his face caught the light as his head dropped, highlighting the patchy mesh of it, all torn skin and puffy blisters, and Dean felt the knot in his spine tighten impossibly more, the weight he carried there multiplying tenfold.
Emotions. He was feeling emotions. The same kind of feelings Dean woke up with and dreamed with and drowned in eventually, over and over again.
Castiel withered. “I’m sorry.”
Dean frowned. “Good?”
Twelve years. Twelve years of trusting and fighting and trusting again. Twelve years of forgiving the impossible and insisting it was all for friendship. Twelve years of loyalty blurring into devotion, attachment softening to love, giving each other everything they could save for a hand to hold and a mouth to kiss.
“Fuck’s sake…” Dean grumbled, squinting through the front windshield to stare at Cas who, unsurprisingly, remained unmoved.
Dean knew Cas was talking about him. About
Instantly, terror struck Dean cold. “Cas—”
still there nothing but a festering mess of red blisters and peeling dark spots.
“Let me make something clear,” Jack started, surprisingly intent with the way in which he withheld them, his eyes perfectly distinct. “I’m not Chuck. I’ve absorbed his powers, his essence, yes but— there is no replacement for God. There are some things I’ll never be able to replicate, and his power over the Empty is one of them.”
He said, “I know, sweetheart.”
” Dean said pointedly, waving a hand towards the angel matter of factly. “Get all uptight and weird everytime I mention Charlie.” And then it occurred to Dean, like a fucking hammer crashing into the side of his head, that Castiel was more than just his best friend. More than the celestial being who had saved him from damnation and given up his own world just to join Dean’s.
” Sam groaned, snapping his head back towards Eileen who was laughing sporadically now, a hand drawn over her mouth.
“God, that’s— that’s good. That’s really good.” Dean smiled.
“But it’s different now, isn’t it?” Castiel asked, and of course it was.
Dean shouldn’t have to think about these things anymore. He shouldn’t have to answer the kind of questions he’d expect to hear from a stranger passing through a bar, not from his best friend of twelve years who Dean had lived and bled and ached for since what felt like forever, since what
Dean didn’t know what he was doing. Never really had, but he knew what he wanted. He’s always known. He just never knew how to ask for it, how to reach out and take Cas’s hand like he was doing now.
He needed him back. Dean needed Cas to come back, and it was more than just an ever-glowing thought, a never ending mantra of
He smiled, small and tense, and mumbled, “Damn near spot on.”
“Because why?”
When Dean finally reached the door, something like fire burning beneath his skin, Miracle was already there pawing at the frame. His fur was damp from a recent bath, and he had a patch of suds clinging to his shoulder where someone hadn’t dried him off well enough.
“Me connecting with his grace fueled his memories. It opened the door. He’s progressing too quickly, this— this wasn’t supposed to happen,” Jack said weakly, guilt buried through the length of his voice.
Claire no longer held herself with a persona meant to be feared. She didn’t preen with defiance or stand with bloodied fists, simmering with a pain driven anger that erupted the second it was touched. Dean knew better than anyone what that looked like, and even from just a glance, Dean could tell that she wasn’t living just to prove that she could. She wasn’t that kid anymore.
After that’s put away, Dean was left with an odd sort of brewing in his gut. This hint of annoyance that stung no matter how hard Dean tried to wash it away, ignore it completely.
Dean suffered through the silence that followed. Sam sighed.
Whew— did you make it through alright? Dean and Cas’s relationship made mighty bounds in this chapter, but as always in supernatural, there’s something lurking around the corner. We’re getting closer to finding out what really went down with Cas in the Empty, but until then, I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments!
If Cas wasn’t going to be around for it, if they didn’t figure this mess out— none of it would matter.
She had her back to him. She couldn’t hear when he whimpered out, “Eileen.”
There was a crack of thunder outside, near enough to shake the earth and rattle silverware against pinched napkins. The lights flickered briefly, a distorted glitch, and when Dean’s eyes adjusted he looked up at the waitress to find her watching him intently, waiting for a better reply.
“That’s a load of crap,” Dean gritted. “You can’t sit here and tell me Jack doesn’t know Cas is back. He would’ve felt it. He might have even been the one to do it, who knows!”
Sam let out a terse sigh, apprehension prickling. He slowly closed his laptop. He knew how this conversation was going to go. When Dean locked himself in his room for days, his only source of company being a six-pack and a pair of headphones, he only ever came out looking for a fight; anything to get his blood pumping with something other than grief.
Everyone’s go-to badass lesbians?”
And for the second time that week, Dean breathed his truth and
Dean pulled out into the street not a second later, driving fast enough to send Cas crashing into the side of the door, hands flying out to clutch desperately at the dashboard. Dean’s first reaction was to laugh at him, his mouth dropping open to fit a massive smile, but then Cas let out this high pitched spark of laughter that made his lips curl and Dean was left struggling to breathe, gaping like a dying fish.
” Claire interrupted, her voice drifting in from a distance, but it wasn’t long before Dean started to hear footsteps closing in.
Cas’s smile was so sudden, so grand and so full that it nearly forced Dean backwards, the shock of it staggering. Dean didn’t think he’d ever seen Cas smile like that. No— no he hadn’t. He would have remembered. He would have remembered if it was anything like this. Sweet and honey warm, all the goodness in it reaching his eyes, crinkling his skin.
He raised his eyebrows at Cas. “You wanna shuffle em’ this time?”
“I’m not proud of it but... I stole these.”
“Warn us?” Dean snapped. “You never said it was gonna be like
That one word sent Dean straightening up in his chair, swallowing a wave of choking relief. “Cas? S’ that you?”
“Oh don’t lie to the poor bastard,” Lundy said with a throaty laugh. “You couldn’t save him last time, or the time before that. You’ve got quite the history of letting this one die. What’s one more time?”
Dean felt his breath catch in his throat, eyes growing wet.
Sam gave him a crumbled look, eyes soft and worried. He looked sad, Dean realized, and he quickly straightened up, clearing his throat to try and get the air back in his lungs.
“Buddy,” Dean laughed, surprising himself at just how genuine he sounded. He crouched down to look into the supply cabinet at the back of the room, speaking louder to make sure Cas could hear. “You look like you went twelve rounds with a brick wall and lost.”
“Just for the record, uh,” Dean hesitated, throat closing. He fumbled with the keys in his lap. “I don’t care. About your face I mean,” Castiel turned to him in the drifting light, head tilting fondly. “It doesn’t matter, okay? Not to me.”
Cas went eerily still, his face a blur of red and purple that simmered over his skin and made the striking vein running down the center of his forehead pulse like a lifeline waiting to give out.
“Figures,” Dean muttered. “It’s just our luck to have our star player sitting the bench.”
“Here you go, darlin’,” She smiled, and Dean grabbed the burgers with two hands, careful of their weight.
“You heard the man,” Dean said, squeezing Cas on the shoulder with a forced smile. “He’s been Doried.”
“You know what I mean. A different different,” He tossed Sam the water without looking, and the two of them swapped places, fluent and familiar with the way in which they brushed past each other. Dean sprawled himself across the bench, ignoring the sudden twinge in his back as he continued, “Like… a bigger different. Super different.”
He tapped at the same spot over his own eyebrow, lowering his voice, “Whoever did that to you better be six feet under.”
“Uh, he was touch and go there for a while,” Dean looked past the library towards the map room, half expecting Sam to stumble in from the hallway. “I ended up taking him to the hospital.”
“The end of you, you mean,” Dean said bitterly.
had always just been another alternative to
“That’s the only way we’re used to,” Sam shrugged, holding up his angel blade, and there was just enough of a confident rise in his shoulders for Dean to look at him and soften, his heart settling for a blissful few seconds.
“This guy, where is he now? What’d you do with him?” Dean asked heatedly, much more urgent than he’d been before.
“Alright.”
Then, softer, “I think you should try anyway. Think of something even the old me didn’t know about you.”
It was something Dean had gotten used to allowing himself, one of very few, but letting Cas get so close now when he didn’t know any better felt invasive and wrong, like Dean was taking advantage of the guy.
“Jesus, Cas. If I had a nickel every time a woman said that to me I’d—”
And even then, Jack’s smile was the last to go.
There was just something about having to drag a drunken father into bed at that age that made you unforgiving.
type of questions— Dean had never been asked them before.
“Dean,” Cas sounded breathless, voice caught somewhere at the top of his throat. He looked down at his own hand held in Dean’s, expression hopeful. “Why are we in here?”
is your life, and it blows on a good day, but pal—” He raised his shoulders, smiling bitterly. “There are worse places to be.”
His throat clamped up when Dean did as he was told, laying all the way back to rest his head on Cas’s lap. Dean took a deep breath, coughed up a laugh that sounded more like choking than anything, and looked up at Cas to already find the angel staring down at him, his lips parted and waiting.
There was a breath. Just one, and then they were moving all at once, suit jackets whipping behind them in their rush to stand.
“But let me guess, you do,” Dean pointed a harsh finger at him. “You think sitting down, shootin’ the shit and hugging it out is gonna turn things around, but it won’t,” He nearly left it at that. It would’ve been easy. But even with the rattle at the back of Dean’s throat, he managed to gather himself just enough to say, ever so quietly, “Crying about it won’t fix Cas. Believe me.”
Dean reluctantly tore his eyes away from Sam, forcing strength into his limbs and desire in his bones, the weight lifting with a choked-out grunt. Dean forced the bar up and exhaled, tightening at the elbows and straining at the thighs.
Dean raised his eyebrows, freezing where he stood. “What?”
“Even I know that’s not true,” Cas said, and it’s the same voice, the same mindlessly comforting tone that surfaced as a feeling in Dean’s chest rather than a rumble in his ears, and he flinched against the weight of it.
Dean gaped at him. “So…”
“With your stolen credit card?” She scoffed.
jump—
“Have a seat right over there,” Dean gestured to one of the infirmary beds pushed against the glass wall. He closed the door behind them. “I gotta find some real stitches. None of that dental floss shit for you.”
and Dean felt that light in his chest sizzle and gasp, bending around air, still burning on against all odds.
“Kaia?” Dean scowled. Claire’s grin only widened, her expression laced with a mischievous glint that instantly made Dean go bug eyed. “I mean, uh, as long as everything’s consensual, you know. I don’t judge.”
Eileen came running back from the restroom once she saw them, the surprise on her face quickly turning into irrevocable joy. Her smile was a soft pink shine in the sun, and her cheeks rose from the force of it.
“The angels are blaming me for what’s happened. I’m being hunted.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, the action even more dramatic up close. “I don’t just like you, Dean.”
Dean stared at him. “What do you mean?”
is,” Dean made a face and gestured to all of Sam. “Whatever’s going on with you? Cram it. We’ve got a case here.”
“Thank you,” Cas said, then, more aware, “I guess.”
“Sammy!” He banged on the door loudly, palm flat rather than curled. When there was no immediate response, Dean groaned and pushed his way inside anyway, “Yeah, okay—”
Dean went rigid. His throat worked slowly, “Recently? Or...”
It had started gradually, nothing but odd mood swings and a distance in his eyes that Dean couldn’t place. Almost like he was a million miles in the direction of nowhere even when speaking to Dean directly, his mouth moving without diction. But soon the switch became jarring, an illusion of night and day, and Dean could hardly look at Cas without trying to gauge what move he’d make next.
“Get down!”
“Damn right they are,” Dean said, “just wait till’ you meet Charlie. You two will get along great.”
“Come here, buddy, yeah— I know, I know. I missed you too, but I got somebody I want you to meet.”
“Fantastic,” Dean said, stuffing the chips into his jacket.
“Well we’ve been having a lot of that lately,” Dean muttered.
Dodge City had been their first case with Cas back, and when Dean found himself with Cas in his passenger seat, just his presence overwhelming, his cowboy hat astrew, fuck it if he
but Cas had trouble taking compliments. His body went rigid like a vibrating wire, mouth opening and closing in pointless beats, and even then, with Dean squinting against the fluorescents of the garage and still a little dizzy off gas fumes, he noticed the shyest beginnings of a smile breach the surface of Castiel’s face, growing so very slowly where it followed the trail of redness from his cheeks to his ears like a looping flush of warmth.
“It should be perfectly capable of holding our weight. I’ve seen you and Sam do the same,” He insisted, and then, giving Dean an adorably reassuring smile and an outreached hand, he said, “I saw this in a movie once."
Cas’s smile was gentle, joy mixing with disbelief. “I’d like that, Dean.”
“I’m feeling a multitude of things I’ve never felt before. Almost all of them unpleasant and it’s… terrifying.”
Cas didn’t seem to understand why his heart sunk the way it did. Dean could see it on his face, the crushing ache of a broken piece, unmendable, and Dean wished he could explain it to him.
Jack stepped up to them, apprehension clear in his eyes as he raised two fingers to each of their foreheads.
“Can I go back to school, Dad?” Sam asks. “I have a test tomorrow that I would love to not-miss.”
“Sorry. I, uh... didn’t mean. I mean, hey, if it’s your thing.”
“I killed them,” he states flatly. “How?”
He walks for an hour and he thinks about Dean. He thinks about Dean’s eyes, lit up by firelight, and Dean’s hands that touched every last inch of him as they curled up together. He thinks about Dean’s mouth, the way it pressed into him, pulled him closer, fell open in pleasure when he came, smiled sweetly at him as they fell asleep together.
“Dean--” Sam begins.
From John Winchester, that’s like a blessing of marriage, and Dean’s hold on his hand tightens. Castiel doesn’t have to look at him to know he’s smiling.
Cas furrows his brow and appears to do some quick calculations.
Dean realizes what he’s going to do about a split-second before he does it, and doesn’t even have time to call out, “No!” before the hoe is swinging and his whole world goes dark.
“Well, did I tell you
Bingo. There’s a sizable shed in the backyard of the house. It’s like a demon’s hostage dream come true. Only one entrance, so it’ll be pretty hard to take it by surprise. He does see a window, so he sneaks over to it, peeking carefully inside. Sure enough, Jude is tied to a chair, his face bloodied, a rag shoved into his mouth. He looks unconscious.
“I think I’m ready,” he tells Garth at dinner. “I really think I am.”
“Ooh, I like when you say my name. Say it again.”
“Hey,” Dean says softly. “I’m serious. I’m... you know me, Cas, I’m an idiot. I say the dumbest shit. I’m sorry.”
“Good,” Dean says. “I know it’s selfish, and I should tell you to go, get out, hitch a ride back to town, save yourself, but I don’t want to. I want you here, with me.”
Dean doesn’t wait around to hear the rest of Castiel’s speech. His insides are already burning in embarrassment and frustration; he stalks down the stairs, being careful not to make too much noise, leaving Castiel in the dark hallway.
The waitress comes then with their pie, apple for Dean and cherry for Castiel, and without a word, Castiel pushes his plate across the table and looks at Dean defiantly, as if daring him to reject it.
“Why?” Castiel asks, his eyebrows scrunching together, and Dean suddenly becomes completely incapable of having this conversation because
“I don’t know!” Castiel says desperately. “I’m... new to this, Dean! I don’t know how this works!”
Dean does not meet his eyes as he leaves, and Castiel watches him go, knowing that he will most likely never be that close to Dean again.
“You wanna take a drive for old time’s sake?” he asks.
After the first hunt, it’s like he can’t get enough. Every time Ben or Aaron or Kevin or Claire drop by, he begs them to come along. Sometimes, when Garth permits it, they do take him, and these are David’s favorite days. Ben especially loves having him around, because a sixteen year old kid can be used for a hell of a lot of scams, and while David isn’t thrilled about being bait or pretending to be injured to get money, he’s happy to help however he can.
“How’s Gina?” Paul asks eagerly. Since he was the one who set Dean and Gina up in the first place, he’s always the first to inquire as to the status of their relationship. Dean is positive that if he ever proposed, Paul would be first in line to plan their wedding. Sometimes when Paul looks at him, Dean swears he’s planning flowers and color schemes.
He doesn’t know how long he sits there and watches Dean, but the sky turns the color of a bruise and the forest is dark before Dean finally sits up, his arms trembling.
“Dean!” Cas says, shocked, but Dean is already out the door, down the stairs, crossing to the front door, the screen clattering behind him as he strides out into the yard.
“Don’t turn around, Cas,” Dean barks. “Keep your eyes on the trees. I’ve got him.”
,” he says forcefully. “If I sober up, I’ll over-think it and I won’ do it. I need t’go
“Jealous,” Sam throws back.
David pushes that thought out of his head. He’s only fourteen. He has time. He’s not going to worry about why he didn’t want to kiss the sheriff’s daughter.
Claire twists her mouth and fiddles with her sandwich. “He’s dead now,” she says. “He left when I was younger than you. But he was... he was a good man.” She grins at him. “It was a compliment, by the way. You’re growing up to be a very handsome man.”
Hours later, Kevin finds him curled up in the backseat of the Impala.
Dean thanks the man and checks his watch. It’s after nine-- way too late to go after vampires. They’ll be at their strongest in just a few hours; he can hear Dad and Bobby and Sam in his head, screaming, “
He walks home, needing the time to think. He’s done an excellent job of pretending that his life here in California has everything he wants. Granted, it has a lot of things he wants: Sam in school, a home that’s not on wheels, an honest, steady, paying job as a mechanic, but it’s getting more and more difficult to ignore the gaping, fallen-angel-sized hole in his world.
“I just... didn’t... expect you to call.”
“What?” he asks, rubbing his mouth.
“This isn’t very hard,” Castiel says.
There’s something in Garth’s eye, but he sighs and says, “Let’s say for sake of argument that they are.”
“Good morning June-bug!” Melissa and Dean chorus in equally sappy voices.
“Babe, it’s so early,” he says. “Go back to sleep.”
The recognizable flutter of wings.
“Where’s Meg?” Dean asks.
“Dead?” David asks. They all nod.
The taser goes off with a spark and Dean leaps aside to avoid getting barbecued. He’s had his heart fried before and he isn’t itching to try again. The rawhead goes down, twitching, and Castiel pockets the taser with a small smile before giving Dean a hand and hauling him to his feet.
“Thank god,” he says, “We aren’t even close to being ready. Here,” he shoves a flask at Castiel, “it’s full of holy water, it burns their skin. They have the power to throw us, but it weakens them, so they’ll only do it as a last resort. We’ve only got one of those daggers that kills them, and Dad has it, so the best we can do it shoot them until they fall into one of the devil’s traps, and they’re pretty much everywhere.”
He folds up the letter and sticks it in the pocket of the trenchcoat. Maybe he will go to college. It would certainly be an experience. Maybe he’ll go spend a year in Europe. It would be far different as a presumably normal eighteen-year-old, rather than a wave of celestial intent. Maybe he’ll keep hunting. Maybe he’ll just relax.
, old Cas,
He thinks briefly of this mother. He feels a pang of guilt that he hasn’t thought about her in days, wonders if she’s called the police. He wonders bitterly if she even cares. She has to care, Castiel thinks. I’m her son. This thought does not give him much reassurance. If his mother only loves him out of obligation, how can he expect anyone, especially Dean Winchester, to want him around?
Dean holds out the coat, bloodstained and crumpled.
“Slow down,” Garth puts his hands on David’s shoulders, which are quivering. “Do you really want to know what happened to Dean and Sam?”
“So, this sex stuff,” he says. “Do you, like... get off on it?”
Dean strides quickly to the door and shoulders past Castiel, clearly intent on leaving without saying another word, but Castiel stops him with a hand, a look.
The cover of the one Castiel has in his hands shows a woman in a low-cut red dress, slumped in the arms of a gleaming man. His nose is buried in her bosom and her nails clutch the bowling ball-sized muscles of his arms. He wonders at the way the woman’s head is thrown back in apparent ecstasy.
Castiel turns his head slightly so his lips ghost over Dean’s.
“You told me not to
“It didn’t,” he says. “Until I saw how much it
“I don’t hate you,” Dean spits, not meeting his eyes.
She programs it in and hands it back to him, the sharpness gone from her face. Dean peeks at the name: Alexis. Damn. Not even close.
When he wakes up, Castiel is downstairs cooking breakfast, and they don’t talk about it.
“I do, Mark,” Cas says. “I’ll make sure to call you next time I’m craving Jaeger.”
“Yeah, well, clearly you weren’t doing your job because I beat you to the nest!”
“Hey,” Claire says. “Don’t. I know you’re about to apologize for my dad, but don’t. Don’t. It’s... it’s okay.”
“Make me, Dean.” And the line goes dead.
Dean doesn’t even try to pretend he doesn’t know what she’s talking about.
David blushes and throws a potato chip at her. He’s positive, the way he was positive the night of his fourteenth birthday, that he should be feeling something right now. Claire is beautiful, tall and blonde, and while she’s not exactly flirting with him (her attitude towards him seems to be more like little-brother-I-never-had) she just called him handsome and shouldn’t he be
too close to the four-letter-word-he-does-not-think-about.
“No,” Dean replies stubbornly.
“Bossy,” Dean grins at him, but he doesn’t complain because Castiel ordering him around in bed is pretty much the greatest thing ever and all he wants is to fuck that sassy little look off of Castiel’s face.
And then John Winchester is back on him. “Well, civilian?” he says. “Got anything to say for yourself? Got any special superpowers we don’t know about? Besides being a good little bitch to my son, here?”
“Don’t do this again, Dean,” he says. “It doesn’t work. It didn’t work the first time, it won’t--”
“He’s right,” Kevin says. “Mostly they suck. But there was this one who really didn’t. His name was Castiel.”
“Castiel,” she says pleasantly, spreading her arms, “and Dean Winchester. Together again. How fortuitous.”
feds are on the case. Either way, he’s got to tread carefully, because if there’s one thing hunters and feds both have in common, it’s territoriality.
the way Cas is saying his name, laced with pity. He feels Cas lift his arm so he’s half-carrying him through the streets, and by the time they make it home, Dean just wants to sleep and forget any of this happened.
Castiel tries to keep himself from smiling, but he’s sure he fails because Sam laughs at him. He wants to treat this piece of news like it barely phases him (the way he knows it probably should), but he can’t help his relief. Whatever is going on between him and Dean may have happened fast, but it’s so big to Castiel, so all-consuming; the knowledge that Dean doesn’t just do this for every pathetic awkward schoolmate who wanders into his path makes him want to go into the next room, grab Dean, take him to bed, and make him stay there for weeks.
“D-dean?” It’s Jude.
When he slides into Castiel, cock coated with another layer of lube, Castiel shouts, and Dean stops, waits, while Castiel’s face screws up in pain.
) and it’s all he can do not to pass out from boredom and exhaustion. The first couple months working at the garage were exciting; Dean got to learn the insides of all different types of machines, and that was great, but now it just feels empty, robotic, like he’s just another tool on the assembly line. Fix the brakes. Clean the engine. Break it down for scrap. Over and over and over.
“Confused about what?” Dean feels like his heart is being squeezed. “Cas?”
“If that’s what you want,” Castiel says, wishing he didn’t sound so broken and desperate.
Castiel feels much safer after this, and a little part of him feels warm knowing that Dean can hear  him when he doesn’t speak.
, just like
“What are you talking about?”
“Cas!”
Dean gives the woman on the bed a long, loving stare and Castiel feels a tightening in his chest.
“I’ve been human for two years, Dean,” he says. “I know how to drive.”
David can feel himself shaking, but he forces himself to look into Charlie’s sweet brown eyes. A lock of grey-streaked red hair falls into her eyes and she tucks it away, smiling softly at him.
Castiel shoves him lightly.
“Do you want to come back to the cabin?” he asks as Castiel pulls on his shirt.
“We’ve actually known each other for a couple years now,” Sam explains, running a hand through his hair. “She’s in my class, and she’s older, like me. She has a kid.”
“I just need t’go somewhere,” Dean pleads.
“I want that,” David say, sitting up fully. “I want to remember.”
“Well, you’re a lot more sarcastic than I remember,” Dean snaps. “Been taking human lessons?”
. It’s in Nebraska, a tiny little town called Weeping Water near Lincoln. He checks his watch; he can be there by eight at the latest if he shags ass and leaves right now. He packs a quick bag and he’s on his way.
“Hello, Winchesters,” Meg says in a cool voice. “Isn’t this fun? We haven’t all been together like this since--”
“Sam,” he tries to say, but it just comes out a bloody croak. He closes his eyes. He thinks,
Katie tilts her head, confused. “No,” she answers. “I think I just… felt it. When she touched me. And she told me that if I needed her again, all I needed to do was call her name.”
“Why am I wearing a cowboy hat?”
And Dean managed to get nothing of a reply out before Cas was leaning forward and kissing him soundlessly.
“You never told me.”
“Wait,” Castiel stretched across the bed to stop Dean from leaving, something desperate flashing in his eyes. Dean looked down at him just as Cas’s hand met his wrist, and he was blown breathless by the sight of the sheets falling from Castiel’s shoulders, his torso unveiling itself for Dean’s frantic eyes. “Dean—”
“It’s not,” She agreed plainly, a fact she’d clearly accepted a long time ago. “But I know Sam, and I know you, and watching your best friend forget everything he’s ever known isn’t something you take lightly. Am I close?”
When Dean kept his focus on the coffee brewing in front of him, Castiel said, “I’m sorry.”
” She was angry, that much Dean could tell, but the way her voice broke apart at the end was harsher than any scream. His fingers tightened around the wheel, mouth hanging open— “
“And I think you’re lying,” Dean leveled Cas with a look, one he certainly knew was serious enough to make arguing seem out of the question. “The hospital had you on a shit ton of morphine, but that should be wearing off by now. The least we can do is give you some cheap ass pain meds.”
“I’m not promising anything until that girl of yours in there has a ring on her finger,” Dean quipped instead, smiling through the initial sting, and it worked at least. This time, Sam didn’t find any deeper meaning to the pull of Dean’s mouth.
"Wait, you think...?” He searched Cas’s eyes, sadness punching him right in the chest. He let out a tearful breath. “Fuck, Cas, you got it all wrong, I’m not uncomfortable. With this, or- or with you. Not at all.” Dean assured quickly, eyes wide and hurt, watching Cas’s vulnerability tilt on a balance beam of uncertainty.
Dean shuddered out a breath, chest cramping.
A quiet look of disagreement passed through Castiel’s face, head tilting to the side. He eyed Dean almost sadly, worry lines creasing around his eyelids, and Dean ached at the sight of it, all of it— every flicker in his expression familiar enough to bring him back to a diner and a feeling and a singeing mark on his arm.
He wanted the messy Cas. The grouchy Cas. The Cas who grumbled as he drove and scolded Dean without hesitation. The Cas who had bled and burned and ached just to keep Dean safe for all these years, and had become so beautifully human because of it. Dean had never wanted anything more or different or better than Cas— just Cas was more than enough, it was everything.
Dean swallowed around the truth once before speaking it. “No, actually. It’s, uh... it’s yours. I gave it to you.”
“I can imagine this is odd for you,” Cas said, tearing Dean out of his own head fast enough to have their eyes meeting abruptly. Cas practically withered under Dean, eyes dashing away. “My predicament I mean, seeing as we’re friends.”
Cas hummed. “
Slowly, Dean gathered a piece of cloth in hand and moved to dab some of the blood away. He was careful, more careful than he’d been with Sam in years when it came to hunting wounds, but the contact alone had Cas flinching away as if struck, lips curling as his head dropped. Cas trembled through a noise at the back of his throat; it was quiet, restrained, but Dean could tell from a mile away that he was white knuckling.
The old woman exploded in a light of blue, the angel blade driven straight through her stomach. Cas drew away from the light, head turning to the side rather than staring dead on like Dean had seen him do time and time again.
His voice rang against the silence, and Dean felt eyes flock towards him from all directions. He could hear Jody heave a disappointed sigh right in his ear, muffled and wrong, but it was a different voice that had him crumbling completely, eyes bursting with heat.
but Cas’s words brushed a part of him that reached out in response, ached for more reassurance. Dean huffed out a laugh to hide the fact that he suddenly felt like he was choking, throat tight, eyes glassy.
This was all Dean wanted. This was all he had ever wanted, Cas beside him in the passenger seat, content with simply being with Dean without the fate of the world forcing them together. Laughing, smiling, being so unapologetically human.
“Practice?” Dean asked, raising his eyebrows suggestively enough for even Cas to understand. “We can practice all you want, sweetheart. Cause’ believe me, there are some things you just can’t learn from a movie.”
“You can’t keep this up, Cas,” Dean said, stretching his fingers across the mug to warm them, needing that small comfort. “This strong and noble bullshit, acting like it’s all already decided and you’re as good as dead. It’s gotta
He didn’t make a move to stop. Cas simply kept working at the tricky shape of his chin as he asked, “Were you always this inquisitive and I’ve forgotten? Or is this a recent development?”
