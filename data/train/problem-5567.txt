“You okay, Steve?” Dr. Stark asks, lifting his hand so it’s no longer touching him but still close enough that Steve can feel its warmth. He lets out a breathy sound that he desperately hopes Dr. Stark will take as an affirmative, because he’s incapable of anything else.
“Not at all,” Steve said, stepping back to give him room to enter.  “My name’s Steve Rogers by the way.”
The first thought Tony had when he saw Captain America was that he wanted to climb him like a tree.  The second was that it was a good thing Captain America’s ass wasn't any rounder, because otherwise, Tony would've had to get down on his knees and bite it.  The third was that he was so fucking screwed.
“Tony,” she said, covering his hand with her own. “I hate to tell you this, but you are not a subtle person. You’ve done everything but write it across the sky. If he doesn’t know, it’s because he’s purposefully being blind.”
Now, however, the question was how long would he have to stay in this room before Tony would allow him in his again?
“Finished?” Tony asked, and the way he immediately abandoned his own plate told Steve he’d been eating mostly to keep him company rather than due to hunger.
They mate twice more before Steve falls into an exhausted slumber, and Tony wishes he could lay down next to Steve, but he doesn’t belong on land. He’d dry out if he spent all night there, already has a sunburn on his face from how long he’s been above water. It’s painful seeing Steve and being unable to hold him the way he wants, and it frustrates Tony to no end.
(See the end of the chapter for
He already knew that he couldn’t get around the law, but Stark might be willing to be his Dom in name only, especially if Steve could prove to him and Nick that he didn’t
, so—”
Anyone who was anyone knew about Captain America.
“And what exactly are
But Steve had to. He had to do it.
“I mean,” he stuttered. “That is . . .”
He looked away, flushing furiously if the heat in his cheeks was anything to go by, but he could still hear the rasp of cloth as Tony lifted up, pushing his jeans down.
The whole shitshow was Tony’s fault, and while he appreciated Steve’s apology, more than he could say honestly, he knew he didn’t deserve it.
Also, all the thanks to MetaAllu for the help on this chapter. Just all of them.
“Okay,” Tony said, and his mouth quirked at the corner, but it wasn’t happy, more resigned than anything, and Steve didn’t—what had he done? How had he managed to fuck it up all over again—
He watched as Loki grew, his muscles filling out and the clumsy awkwardness of a colt turning into the confident power of a stallion.  Long accustomed to the unforgiving climate of their planet, Jotun eschewed most clothing, save what modesty dictated, and there came a time when Thor yearned to touch that exposed flesh, to trace the scars that marked Loki as a warrior with his hands as well as his eyes.
you?”
,” and he was already shaking his head in denial.
“Sorry, I would’ve called,” he says and has to swallow—he’s
Speaking of which, does anyone have any suggestions as to what Steve should ask for next? ;)
“The situation isn’t ideal, sure, but you can’t tell me you think Tony would hurt anyone, even as a wolf. And there are honestly people who would
“What did I tell you about not being hung up on reciprocity?” Tony asked, standing up to shut the water off and then opening the shower door. “Trust me, I’m not one for quiet suffering. I’ll let you know when I want you to do something, alright?” Or he would anyway, when Steve was able to handle it.
“Ha!  Bruce owes me five bucks!” Tony said triumphantly.  Unfortunately, Bruce was in his lab, working with a team of SHIELD scientists to see how to fix them, but Tony would collect later.  Bruce had been out of town, so he was the only one of them that hadn’t woken up in the wrong body that morning.  SHIELD had subsequently flown him back in, but considering he’d spent years learning how to keep the Hulk under some semblance of control—knowledge that anyone suddenly dropping into his body would lack—Tony couldn’t be sorry about the time wasted in-transit.
“I expect you to follow me around from room to room. I’ve already had pillows put in the areas I’m going to be in, so you can lay on them when you’re tired or when I can’t play with you. You can choose to not use them, if you prefer, but they’re there if you want. There are also bowls for water and food in the kitchen. You don’t need my permission to get a drink if you’re thirsty, but if you’re hungry aside from meals, you’ll have to beg for treats.”
“We have some of the top geneticists in the country, and they’ve run the tests over and over again.  Unless either one of you have a twin that you aren’t telling us about, he’s your and Rogers’ son.”
The doctor drew himself up. “Unless it’s escaped your attention, Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers is still a member of the United States’ armed forces, an obligation which supersedes your contract. I can have you brought up on charges of interfering with—”
“Oh.  Well, could I just wait here then?”
But once it escaped, he couldn’t deny how much he wanted to know the answer.
“Feel better?” Tony asked once they were both barely picking at the food.
He’s so drunk on desire that it takes him a moment to realize that Steve’s noises could actually be a bad thing, and he drags his tentacles out with his hands when they don’t pull out right away. Steve’s wings thrash against the surface of the water in reaction, and he pants, “In, put them in, oh, please, Tony, Tony,” and Tony’s thrilled to comply.
He was so preoccupied that he didn’t pay attention to what Tony was doing until Tony was stepping closer to him and running hands through his hair.
“Hello, Steve,” Tony said from where he was sitting in an armchair. He set down his tablet on the table next to him and smiled.
“Hey, watch this,” Stark said after a minute, the only warning before he dived, plunging towards the water below, only pulling up when Steve could see the spray leaving droplets against his face shield.
His very naked cock, the towel having given up its hold sometime while they were kissing.
What Steve hadn’t been prepared for, however, was Dr. Strange.
It’s utterly wrong then that the fact that Dr. Stark has to be rough with him because Steve’s body is forcing him to makes Steve think even
to tell me what to do or how to do it.  Maybe you don’t understand that, or maybe you
“Okay. Then we’ll . . . try this out for a while. See if . . .” He trailed off. “Look, so I’ve got some things I was working on that I need to wrap up. You, uh, know where everything is, so I guess I’ll leave you to it.”
His fingers are already rubbing against Steve before he’s even finished talking, so Steve doesn’t get the chance to brace himself, letting a ridiculous squeak escape as what feels like a jolt of electricity shoots through him.
going to do with him?” Pepper demanded with Happy scowling at Tony behind her shoulder.
Captain America’s mouth tightened, but all he said was an unenthusiastic, “Hello,” and damn it, why couldn’t he be perky?  Tony could deal with perky.
I miss you, Tony.  I miss you so much.
If I do another installment of this series, I think we'll get to hear more from Tony. Steve kind of directed the show this time around, but I think Tony should get a chance as well, right?
“Steve, there’s a hostage situation,” Nick said, and Steve gave himself one second to be selfish and wish this had happened on any other night before answering.
another blow job.”
. Tony had seen the news reels. He’d seen
That thought gets swept away like flotsam in a current as he discovers the tip of his tentacle can actually dip
“Ask me,” Tony said, his thumb rubbing back and forth along Steve’s jaw.
“That would be Captain Rogers, Sir.”
Tony had been so apologetic and horrified, even as he stood there dripping coffee down his expensive fitted suit while Steve’s own clothes, a holey T-shirt that had seen better days and a pair of ratty shorts, had barely been splashed. Tony had ignored the slow destruction of his suit and used his single napkin to try and blot at a few spots on Steve’s arm. Steve had been immediately charmed.
that Steve had picked up along the way, interesting but ultimately unimportant, and what did it matter if they were in New York, or in DC, or if they were gone altogether?
“You can,” Tony agreed, managing to get ahold of him anyway. “I want to, though.”
“Are you alright?”
He put his head in his hands and settled down to wait.
“That’s not the point,” he said, because he wasn’t actually made of iron, so of course he’d had thoughts.
“Of course not,” Tony said, blinking slowly. “You should definitely get some sleep.”
It was Steve. Tony had decided a long time ago that whatever happened, he’d bear the pain of losing Steve just to have had him for as long as he could.
Until Tony rolls up the sleeves of his shirt.
He should spend them sleeping.
“But—”
Of course, Tony only has morning appointments on Saturdays, so they could always decide to grab lunch afterwards, maybe catch a movie or take a walk around, let the date run long and possibly …
“I didn’t—”
What if Tony needed help taking care of his back? Or what if he fell? Steve had put bandages on him in order to prevent ointment from smearing all over his sheets and clothes, but there’d been a spattering of tiny scabs from where the person Tony had gone to had broken skin. Not many perhaps, but too much all the same.
His hectocotyli are nowhere near as long as his tentacles, and they don’t have a single sucker on them, but in their normal state, the two of them together are significantly thicker than Steve’s cock, and Tony can change their length and girth at will.
But this? Steve had to have known how Tony felt about him, at least to some degree, even if Tony had never declared his feelings outright, so it would’ve been downright cruel for him to lie or exaggerate his own feelings.
Life is different in the Compound.  Do you remember the days right after the First?  People running, screaming; people dying.  I am trying to keep Them back, trying to keep you and everyone else in the Compound as safe as I can.  Yes, it’s dangerous.  We’ve lost a lot of good people here.  But knowing that you’re back there, you and Bruce and everyone else who’s looking for a cure, it keeps me going.  It gives me the strength to keep fighting so that we can have a better world and maybe get back to the way things were before.  One day.
No, no. They were—Tony wouldn’t—
“I already put your stuff in the closet,” Tony said, and Steve nodded, feeling a little pang of guilt for making him carry his bag. Tony had told him to pack light, however, so it wouldn’t have been very heavy, but he’d honestly forgotten he’d brought anything at all. He should’ve taken care of his things before they’d had their conversation. “As for the clothes you’re wearing, you can put them in the hamper, and I’ll take care of them before we leave.”
“Well, I would really appreciate it if you could take a look,” the stranger said, and he smiled.
“Tony, I—”
For a second, it seemed like the world had become white and silent. And then sight and sound came back to him in sickening bursts.
“I don’t think so,” he says, but it’s almost a question. He knows some omegas really like being bitten on their necks during their heats, but he can take it or leave it. The way he feels right now, though, the thought of some dark-haired alpha biting him, pinning him down and holding him in place as he’s forced to take his knot—
It's not a full sequel by any means, but it's a little bit of (angsty) something.
Steve wasn’t the type of person to lie about something like this. But he wasn’t the type to blurt out details about his personal life either.
—he asked Tony.
He just hadn’t realized how much waiting would be involved.
She slid from her seat, settling onto her knees, graceful and confident and so lovely that he felt a pang once again that things hadn’t worked out between them. If nothing else, he wouldn’t be in his current situation if they were still together.
Tony grinned. “Hell yeah, I am. But I have to get a few things ready first, and like I said, I still owe you something tonight.”
He hated the idea that he was always being observed, but if he were honest with himself, it was barely different than the way the Army or SHIELD had treated him after the Super Serum and then being virtually resurrected. There had always been people around, watching and assessing, and if Stark wanted to look at him in his bedroom, well, Steve remembered giving him permission to do so in their contract. He’d agreed to voyeurism and exhibitionism and a long list of things he didn’t know the definitions of, and it hadn’t mattered when he’d been standing there, numb and feeling betrayed. Steve told himself that it still didn’t.
Still. Ten months. So much could change in ten months.
“Okay, ears now,” Tony said, but instead of reaching into the bag, he paused and then brushed his fingers against the leather as if he were getting rid of a speck of lint. Except then he kept doing it, his movements gentling until he was almost stroking the leather, and there was something about the look in his eyes that made Steve’s breath catch.
It's my birthday (again--I can't believe I've had six birthdays over the course of this fic wtf) in a few days, and I thought, what better way to celebrate than to post a chapter! Yay chapter! Feel free to give me all the kudos and comments as a present! *hopeful eyes*
, which I highly recommend you check out!
They went downstairs, and Steve wasn’t sure why they were stopping by Tony’s lab, but he stood quietly as Tony opened the door, knowing he’d find out soon enough.
As always, I want to thank MetaAllu for reading this over. <33
“The only reason I’d leave would be to use the bathroom, but that’s right down the hall, and I’ll be back immediately. I even put in a mini-fridge, so I have everything I need for the day. That brings us to the next point: your nutritional needs. I’m going to give you water periodically, and every few hours—” hours?—”we’ll stop and feed you a shake. They’re not the most satisfying things ever, but you’re not going to want to eat anything heavy while we’re doing this.”
He could do this. He
He did shift a little restlessly then, but he stopped as soon as he realized what he was doing. No one had ever rimmed him before. He’d known that people enjoyed it, but it was like trying to explain why ice cream was so delicious versus giving someone an ice cream cone and letting them discover it for themselves. There was just no comparison. More than once, he’d thought his legs were going to buckle from how good it’d been.
“Oh, I told my parents years ago that I was gay.  Had to head them off at the pass about the whole grandkid thing.  Stroke of genius if I do say so myself.”
“It’s hard to look this good all the time, Nat,” Clint said unperturbed. “You wouldn’t understand, considering your unfortunate lack of looks,” he said, shaking his head sadly, “but for the rest of us, it’s a constant battle to stay this sexy.” He took a big bite of his sandwich, his cheeks bulging out.
“Got to clean everywhere,” Tony said, circling his fingers again and again, the muscle twitching in response. Steve always seemed to run a little warm, but he felt almost hot at the opening to his body, and Tony had to close his eyes for a second at the thought of being inside of him.
Steve closed his eyes.
“C’mon in,” he said gruffly.  “Unless you’re planning to stand there all day?”
“We were interrupted, so you can come as much as you need to.”
“Then shut up and take it.”
Their eyes met for just a second before Steve looked down and didn’t look up again.
He actually hadn’t intended to instate rule six for a few more weeks since he’d been hoping to establish more of a relationship with Steve first, but fuck that. After Steve’s reaction to his offer to give him some freedom, he could have rule six if he wanted to.
Okay, that’d been kind of foolish of him to assume Tony would be waiting in the living room just because he’d been there the last time he’d come back. Tony had a lot to do, and he wouldn’t put his life on hold simply because Steve had gone on a mission.
“Yes?” Steve asked. He knew it was important, and he didn’t think Tony would’ve wanted him to sit like this if he were angry, but Steve was suddenly filled with a sense of foreboding. What if Tony hadn’t liked—he arched reflexively as Tony found a ticklish spot.
Except then Steve’s shoulders began to sag in small jerks, as if his strength had finally given out, but he continued to fight every step of the way. “I don’t want to give you up.” His eyes were filled with something like shame when he looked up at Tony. “I want to be with you for as long as you’ll let me.”
He answers the standard “how are you doing today?” and “is there anything you want to mention to the doctor?” questions, and he tries not to fidget, but it’s hard to keep still.
“Can I get you something?” he asked in a hushed voice, glancing at the leftover food on the table, but Tony gave the barest shake of his head and started towards his bedroom. It was more of a shuffle than a walk, and Steve’s heart sank to the vicinity of his knees to see it.
“You think I don’t know that?  I am a
“I’m your son,” the kid in the weird futuristic armor who had suddenly appeared in his lab in a burst of blue light said again, and oh shit, Tony would recognize that expression that managed to convey annoyance, hurt and disdain anywhere.
It’s all Steve can do not to cover his face. He just, he feels like he should be apologizing for Bucky, but it’s way too late for that.
But whatever.  It was probably better in the long run not to have sex with Steve.  Virgins were a huge pain in the ass, dropping feelings left and right, and there’d be enough damn expectations being his first Dom—his first Dom, what the ever-loving fuck—because even if Tony didn’t
Tony was
He flinched, wiping the image from his head, and he desperately hoped that he’d managed to control his expression enough that Stark hadn’t noticed. Except then Stark kind of let his body become limp as he stared up at him challengingly, and he knew that Stark had seen after all.
The lights turned on as soon as they stepped past the doorway, and he guided Tony to the bed, trying not to look around. He’d never been in Tony’s room before, but he hadn’t exactly been invited, so it felt wrong to satisfy his curiosity. He focused instead on Tony and had him sit down on the mattress, finally letting go of him. He ignored how empty his hand felt and worked on helping Tony pull of his shirt—he’d seen at least two dollops of a combination of mustard and mayonnaise fall on it—but he was careful to leave the undershirt on.
Never mind some of the fantasies he’d had over the years.
“That’s a . . . very good question,” Pepper said quietly.
Except for how it was, and how Stark would be right there to witness it all.
“I thought . . .”
Or what if Stark had started thinking about what other possible reasons Steve might have had for reacting the way he did?
-----
“I’m sorry,” Tony rasped out, squeezing his eyes closed and pulling Steve tighter to him, fighting tooth and nail to keep his own tears back, because Steve needed him. Steve needed him, and Tony couldn’t fail Steve this last time too. “Steve—”
Steve went.
The point of this wasn’t to orgasm anyway, even if Tony had given him permission. Steve didn’t even want an orgasm. He didn’t deserve one. Especially not if Tony was going without. And yes, it would hurt if he didn’t come, was already starting to ache dully since it was so late in the day and Tony had changed his minimum number of orgasms to two—had changed more than that, but Steve had never told him or thanked him, had never thought to say that Tony made his life better just by being in it—but that was okay. Steve welcomed the pain.
Thank you to MetaAllu who was so hopeful in getting this chapter to make sense and for all the cheerleading. *snuggles forever*
He blocked Stark’s next strike, and the next, and the next after that, the two of them shuffling across the floor as they each tried to find an opening. He eventually managed to catch Stark’s hand, twisting it and shoving it against Stark’s other arm so it was pinned to his chest, consequently leaving his side vulnerable. Steve landed a quick tap before Stark could get free. Stark nodded in recognition of the hit.
He’d tried to do what she’d suggested, but it . . . hadn’t quite worked out the way he’d thought it would.
“Oliver?” she asked, her hand going to her lips. It was noticeably shaking. “You have him?”
the fact that he had somehow developed telepathy overnight.
Tony grinned. “C’mon. You must be hungry. Dinner’s almost ready.”
“Okay, so I grabbed these because you still looked cold,” Dr. Stark says, pushing two metal poles and holding an armful of what looks like blankets. “Why don’t you lie back, and I’ll put them on you?”
The kind who lied, albeit with the best intentions. The kind who ignored their Dom when he said he wasn’t feeling well.
Well, one of two good things, but Steve had nixed the first one in the bud already.  Thor had even said it’d be okay, because who was he to keep shield mates apart, but
He could feel the lump growing in his throat, and he tightened his grip on Stark’s arms, which was alright, because it was metal under his hands, and Stark would never know.
The slide of the elevator doors opening caught him by surprise, and he straightened hastily. He’d already asked JARVIS to not tell Tony he was back, but it wouldn’t be a very welcome surprise if Tony’s first sight of him was of him being melancholy. He took a quick breath and cleared his expression, stepping inside the penthouse.
Does he?
, because Steve’s been dating
Who said . . .
“Isn’t it?” The look in Steve’s eyes desperately asked to be proven wrong.
“It’s going to be okay.” It was an easy promise to give, because he was going to
“Where would the fun been in that?” she asked and closed the door behind them.
And why did he care if Dr. Reynolds was the one to examine Steve or not?
But then, Tony knew what about the effects of the serum; knew what Steve needed and always tried to give it to him, even when Steve hadn’t done enough to earn it.
Unless he’d tampered with it somehow.
“That’s between you and Captain Rogers.”
He hopes he didn’t hurt Dr. Stark when that happened.
He walked to Tony’s room.
It doesn’t matter how wet Steve is or how much he wants this, Tony’s so big that it requires effort for him to fit, and it feels like Steve’s lower body locks up as Tony makes a place for himself inside of him, the burn and the stretch incredible.
Dr. Stark just smiles, and maybe the drape won’t be so bad after all because at least Steve will be able to hide just how bright red he gets every time he sticks his foot into his mouth (it’s the only thing that’s going to be shoved into his mouth tonight at this rate, and that thought is way more depressing than it has any right to be).
“I know you do,” he said roughly, because even though they hadn’t worked out as a couple, he knew she loved him. Whatever else happened, he could always count on that. “Thank you.”
him at me, and he’s not going to forget—”
“You alright there?” Tony asked, his voice breathy, because even though he’d been half hard since seeing him in the doorway, Steve’s reaction had catapulted him to completely erect and desperate to get naked in the span of about zero point seven seconds.
“Shh,” Tony said, even though Steve hadn’t said anything,
For the prompts "It was a dark and stormy night..." (avengers_tables) and "Writing format: docments" (cap_ironman bingo).  I actually wasn't quite certain what the prompt Writing Format: Documents meant, so I just winged it.  Hope this counts.  >_>
Tony looked happy, he thought wistfully, taking in the broad smile, the flamboyant spread of his arms. He was wearing a tuxedo, if the bowtie was anything to go by, and Steve wished he were closer so he could see details.
A playboy? Tony thought
“Can I have the . . . ?”  He trailed off, but Tony understood, wrenching his eyes away.
Tony doesn’t mind that Steve’s … peculiar about this sort of thing. Even growing up, he’s always been more eager to go to a doctor than he maybe should’ve been, and he’s been known to masturbate a time or two (or twenty) after his semi-annual visits, but the doctors in his fantasies have always been faceless. Nameless. Until Tony. Until Tony had him on his table and proceeded to give Steve one of the most intense orgasms in his life.
“Uh, whichever one you’d like,” Tony said, because it wasn’t like he’d been
He’s not quite certain how much time has passed, his body still limp with pleasure, but he knows Dr. Stark is proceeding with the exam; he just isn't concerned beyond enjoying the occasional touch, wishing they'd last longer. His head is finally starting to clear when Dr. Stark says, “Okay, last part now," and Steve goes from dazed to alert just like that.
“Why do any of us have to do it?” Clint burst out and held up a hand when they both stared at him. “I just mean that there are people who would love an opportunity like this. I can get on the phone, and I bet with a few calls, we can find someone—”
“Have you found your other controller, Steve?” Tony asks, and he’s valiantly been trying to pick up Steve’s slack, but the game has respawned Steve in two different places, and Steve keeps dying before Tony can get there.
Tony deserves better than that, though.
to sub, not with him anyway, maybe not with anyone, not for a long time. And two looks didn’t change that, especially not when Tony was the only semi-familiar landmark that Steve had.
, a small voice asked.
“No, thank you,” he said, starting to clear the table.
“Sure, like this?” Tony said, adding more pressure.
Like an idiot, he’d denied it, and she’d told him he might not be in love with Steve Rogers yet, but he’d been in love with Captain America for years.
She smiled. “Do you mind if I catch up on some reading while you’re here?”
“I miss the real you,” he tells cat-Tony quietly, and cat-Tony butts his head against Steve’s fingers in reply.
whenever Steve had needed him, and it was selfish of Steve to want Tony to still be in New York, but he’d begun to think of Tony’s apartment as home. It didn’t work, however, if Tony wasn’t there.
There’s just something about it being Dr. Stark doing this to him, about Dr. Stark doing this for his own good … it’s messing with Steve’s head. His previous exams have never really been painful. They’ve been varying levels of uncomfortable, and he would rather not talk about the amount of embarrassment he’s experienced, but the exams themselves have never gone past that. Whatever his previous doctors might have thought about him, they’ve always been professional when touching him.
Except this time it wasn’t some unknown doctor touching him but—
“No,” Natasha said and turned back to Steve. “So does that mean I should expect to see you two in the news some day soon? Or are you keeping things quiet for a while?”
Dom, Tony.
There was a long silence, and Steve could feel his anxiety starting to peak again by the time Tony spoke up, his voice rough.
He raised his eyebrows. “No . . . I don’t mind.”
“That couch,” Tony said, hitting the wall, “that stupid, cheap Ikea couch you own is the first place we ever had sex!  Every time I go over to your apartment, I sit on that couch, and you come over and force me to cuddle, and there’s that dip in the middle from the number of times we’ve fucked on it, and it’s old and uncomfortable, but I always fall asleep on it, and maybe I don’t want to throw that damn couch out, Steve!  Maybe I want to keep it, alright?  And those curtains you were looking at?  The ones that look like they’re straight out of some damn issue of
Tony spent the next ten minutes getting dressed and saying things like, “Are you crazy? You’re so crazy. Why are you so crazy?”
He let out a slow breath.
And then later:
Steve just felt like he fit in his skin more around Tony.
Unless he didn’t really mean it.
He’d devoted a few more hours to looking for Bucky when Tony finally appeared, but it wasn’t the sound of Tony’s bedroom door opening that startled Steve but the sound of the elevator.
“When did you start drinking so much?”
I just want people to remember that when I responded to comments, I said I’d
Steve didn’t push him away, though, and while he did drop his chin against his chest, hiding his face, he also turned into Tony—not much—but enough that Tony took hope from it, however unjustified that might be.
“You say that, Pepper, but you’re not the one who has to live with him. Maybe what’s he’s actually doing is trying to lull me into a false sense of security, so that he can turn around and steal the schematics for the suit, sell them to the highest bidder, and then live out the rest of his life on his own private island surrounded by beautiful Doms eager to cater to his every whim!”
to say to convince her it wouldn’t work remained just out of reach.
On the day Peggy moved out, Steve stood naked in front of the mirror and looked at all the ragged lines running over his chest, arms and legs.  He felt like someone had taken a knife to him, slicing every inch of him open, and he didn’t understand how there wasn’t any blood.  He traced one particularly thick scar that ran over his chest, gritting his teeth against the pain, and remembered the first time he’d brought Peggy over to meet his family and all the teasing that had accompanied it.  He couldn’t imagine her scars ever disappearing, and in that moment, he didn’t want them to, didn’t want to ever expose himself to that much hurt again.  Once in a lifetime was enough.
Tony tried to cover his momentary lapse with a laugh. “So what, you were in the neighborhood and decided to drop in? Why are you
He sighed and closed his eyes, but he didn’t say anything to ruin Tony’s moment and even found his mouth twitching at Tony’s antics.
That resolution lasts for a whole two seconds as Steve unsuccessfully tries to release the death-grip he has on Tony’s belt buckle until Tony murmurs, “Condoms?” against Steve’s lips, and Steve nearly cries in relief.
-----
It felt amazing, better than it’d ever had, and it took an embarrassingly short amount of time before Tony was teetering on the edge of climax as Steve swallowed around him again and again. His hand came to a rest on Steve’s neck, and Steve moaned, the vibrations running up and down Tony’s cock as Steve pressed into Tony’s grip, silently begging for more. It made him want to forget his original plans. It was already going to be a long night after all, and what was life without a little spontaneity? He’d still end up using Steve to his heart’s content, because he wanted to, because Steve had given him permission to, and for once, Tony was inclined to believe him.
“More than once. And I never meant to, but I did it anyway, and I’m sorry.”
And how had Tony noticed Dr. Reynolds in the first place? Out of all of them, he was the one who needed an exam the most. He couldn’t possibly be finished already, could he?
“But because I wanted you to have the freedom to choose. Whether that was me, or being by yourself, or finding someone else, I wanted you to be able to decide for yourself.”
And Steve thought about it. Thought about how Tony felt in his mouth, how thick he was, how it felt when Tony fucked his throat, and how much harder and deeper he’d go when he didn’t have to be quite so careful. He thought about how good it felt to have something inside of him, how it made everything so incredibly better, and then he thought about being on his knees, his head pressed to the ground by Tony’s hand on the back of his neck, the nipple clamps jangling with each thrust—
He feels horrible, and he knows he’s a bad person for enjoying the situation, but it’s not like he has any other choice. He really did come in because he’s having problems, and he’s just trying to do as he’s told.
“There you go,” Tony said as his fingers finally came to a stop. Steve whined when Tony pulled out, but Tony shushed him, wrapping both arms around Steve’s waist and tugging gently.
“I’ll just do a quick visual inspection and then perform a physical examination for any internal bleeding. If you don’t mind lying back and scooting down to the edge of the table . . .” Dr. Reynolds pulled out stirrups from the corners of the table and frowned at Steve when he remained sitting in place.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony at least had looked just as surprised when they’d unmasked Steve, an expression of what Steve would’ve labeled panic passing over his face if it’d been anyone else.  He wondered if he should take any comfort in knowing Tony hadn’t meant to kill
“—get you ready.”
He couldn’t explain any of that without causing a scene that he desperately wanted to avoid, however, so he shook his head, a low, “I’m sorry,” slipping free.
Nick had used Tony’s desire to be an Avenger to start all of this.
He didn’t know how long he stood there, shifting his weight occasionally but trying to be silent in order not to disturb Tony. He considered sitting, but only for a second, because he realized the point wasn’t to be comfortable; it was to wait for Tony’s acknowledgment, just like Tony had waited for his. So Steve stood where he was, watching the ground, because he didn’t deserve to watch Tony, and he thought about being good, about earning Tony’s attention again.
“You becoming a part of the Avengers,” Steve told him, and Tony wasn’t the only one who could shout. “And getting rid of a Sub you never wanted.”
“Steve?” Tony said, not angry, no, of course not, but confused, and Steve didn’t know who was more surprised of the two of them, because he hadn’t meant to do it. It had happened on its own, and he could only be thankful that there were only a few other people in the hallway and they all had their backs to them.
“It would be my pleasure.” He waited until Steve leaned back to look at him before he said, “Come here,” taking a couple of steps toward the couch and sliding his hand down Steve’s arm until he could loosely grab his wrist.
Tony was already so cautious around him. He’d only just started initiating any kind of affectionate behavior in public instead of waiting for Steve to make the first move. Tony didn’t demand anything, rarely even asked, and Steve knew he was just trying to be considerate, but rather than reassure him, it had the opposite effect of making Steve feel like he was walking on eggshells.
, is the next question, but on second thought, it makes him sound a little crazy, and obviously that’s not such a huge issue right now considering he just dived at Steve’s door while yelling at JARVIS, but there’s no reason to give him even more fodder.
“That seems like it’d take a lot of energy,” Tony said, letting out a weak huff of laughter, “so no.”
The first time Steve fell in love it was with Heather Michaels who lived down the street.  He took her to see
Dr. Stark doesn’t—
Until he wondered
So, disclaimers. I have only been to see a psychologist once, so please take Steve's interactions with his psychologist with a grain of salt. Also, might as well throw this one in, I have never been in a BDSM relationship. I mean, I wouldn't mind having a sub on his knees at my feet, but as I don't want to leave my husband, that is probably never going to happen. I feel like I've warned about the BDSM thing before--if not in this fic, than in others--but for those of you who think I'm experienced in this, I'm really, really not. I am very interested in BDSM, however, but since I don't live the lifestyle, I will occasionally get things wrong. Hopefully that fact doesn't turn anyone off this fic, but if it does, then I understand.
If Steve had known Dr. Stark was the only doctor who could see him today, he might not have come, because he’s gotten a few inappropriate erections during his appointments with Dr. Edwards, but he’s never had one before they even got started.
“I did not,” Dr. Reyolds snapped, but it was the voice of a man trying to salvage what little dignity he could.
Tony’s fingers were
Out of the two of them, it was Steve who had a time crunch now.
He swore he could
Sorry for the spammage, guys.  Just try to get all these prompts finished.  Just 7 more to go.  *dies*
Steve’s breath hitched, and he squeezed himself a little, his other hand starting to slowly rub up and down his thigh.
“Hey, Old Man, I missed you,” Tony whispered into his ear, and Steve let out a shaky laugh.
“Wow.”
Steve faltered, his gaze darting to the side and then inching back in fits and spurts.
His old life had been taken from him, and while Steve could rail and rage at that fact, there was no one left to blame. With Tony, however, all the fault was his own, and it ate at him, all the things he’d given up, and never seemed to stop.
Steve glanced over at Natasha at the sound of incoming voices. The patrol was early.
He honestly doesn’t know if it’d be better or worse to have Dr. Stark move his robe to the side—both, it’d be both—so Steve does it himself, tugging the robe so his chest is bare, his nipples tight and tingling.
“Why?”
“Alright. Just think about what I said, though.”
Recovering. He searched Steve’s eyes, looking for any signs of pity or contempt, but all he saw was worry; worry and tons of guilt, and damn it, they were obviously going to have to talk about that, but just … just not right now. He couldn’t face the idea of sorting through it all, knew that if he tried in his current mindset, he’d start getting angry and defensive, had already proven that when Steve asked about his back, and that was the last thing they needed at this point.
Except then Stark had started talking again, and it’d been painfully obvious that he’d known the direction of Steve’s thoughts from the way he’d turned from him then, his expression becoming pained and tight, but not angry. He’d never once looked angry.
They flew for a long time, long enough for Steve’s fingers and toes to get numb, even with all the extra layers. He kept waiting for Stark to turn back, to say he was bored or he’d had enough, but Stark’s voice didn’t tire as he acted as tour guide, and his arms never faltered, not once giving any hint of letting go. Any nervousness Steve might have felt when they’d first blasted off into the sky had all but disappeared, and he felt safe, he realized. Secure.
,” he said, his shoulders hunching. “Or at least, I didn’t think about anything besides myself.” He’d do better, though, if Tony would just let him, he swore to himself, and tried not to remember how many times he’d made that same promise already. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
Word count: 740
“Steve …” It took a second for Tony to compose himself before he could talk, the relief making him almost sway in his seat. Fuck. Steve wanted to stay—
“I didn’t even
“Even if it means a little discomfort?”
“Dr. Reynolds was overzealous—”
Steve shivered, and he did look up then, Tony’s hand sliding down to cup his jaw.
himself—and it’d be like throwing a cup of water into the ocean really.  Whatever, that wasn’t important anyway.
He wished Tony didn’t have to close himself up in his study, though, but Steve understood there were things Tony needed to do to get ready, and he was grateful for the warning. There was a part of him that worried the reason Tony was doing it was because he didn’t want to be around Steve, but Tony had specifically said he could get him if necessary, so in all likelihood it wasn’t Tony distancing himself again. That had honestly been the hardest part of the punishment, the emotional separation, even though Tony had been in the same room.
Was this really the man he’d become? The type who kept pushing to get what he wanted, even when it hurt other people? He’d known that Tony needed time to recover, but instead of waiting, he’d kept trying to explain, to convince Tony he deserved one more chance, and Steve hated himself for it—hated even more the part of him that thought he should
On the other hand, if he’d thought he looked silly with the ears, then it had to be one hundred times worse with the muzzle on as well. It was so foreign to him that he couldn’t even picture what he looked like in his head. It didn’t matter. He knew it didn’t. But he still wanted to get a glimpse of himself in the mirror over the dresser. Just to see. Just to know.
“Thank you,” Steve whispered hurriedly and nearly sighed in relief as Tony touched him again, bringing his thumb into play and pinching the head gently, more fluid bubbling up between the two digits. It made things low in his stomach clench to see them on him, to know that Tony could have him this on edge so quickly from so little.
still angry.  I didn’t want to leave.  I don’t know if you believe me, but it wasn’t because I
“Tony, wait, I don’t—”
“Great, thanks.” Dr. Stark gives him a smile that’s worth whatever embarrassment Steve has suffered up until this point and sends a pulse of arousal through his body, which, okay, damn it, that’s no good, and Steve’s just going to stare down at the buttons of his shirt—
“I . . .” Steve let out an embarrassed huff, a shiver running all over him.  He rested his head on Tony’s shoulder as he said, “I might have made myself sore from-from—”  He took a deep breath.  “From masturbating so much.”
He broke off as Steve shook his head, the movement small but all too revealing. “Steve, look at me. Please.”
“But they’d believe you and I were together?” he asked.
Being on his knees is only slightly better for Steve, and he sways into Tony, his thighs shuddering as they try to hold his weight. Tony’s tempted to take it even further, but this is enough for now, he thinks. Maybe next time he’ll take Steve all the way down.
. He can go for short periods, and he’s practiced enough that he can even run for a bit, but afterwards, he needs a nap, because that shit’s draining.
Of course, if he’d waited on Tony, he wouldn’t have even had a kiss to remember right now.
“Love leaves marks on all of us,” his mom said and explained how every time people’s hearts were broken, scars would form on their bodies.  The more scars, the more you loved them.  They’d gradually get smaller until they were only thin, white lines, and falling in love again would help speed the healing process along, but they’d never disappear completely.
He could’ve used her advice now—about the kissing and other things.
on AO3) for betaing and answering my medical questions. You guys are wonderful. <3
“Funny you should ask me that question,” Tony said, and this was the very reason he’d opted for a voice-only call. It wasn’t that he felt more comfortable telling her when he didn’t have to see her reaction; just slightly less
Tony didn’t know what to do.
“Is that why you chose to contract with him? Because you knew he would be a good Dom?”
use it. Assuming he knew that safewords were for more than just scening.
“—a light breakfast and then use this,” Tony said, gesturing at a box Steve hadn’t noticed. “We’ll get started as soon as you’re ready.”
“But you’re his first Dom, Tony,” she said, ignoring him, and he’d known that telling her that fact had been a mistake. He wouldn't have if he hadn't been tired and frustrated and feeling cooped up; he couldn’t very well leave Steve in the penthouse to fend for himself, but he wasn’t used to staying indoors for so long unless he was caught up in a fit of genius. So yeah, maybe he’d had a few drinks last night and complained to Pepper about worrying he was going to screw things up, because it’d be so easy to do. But really, it was unfair that she was holding his maudlin thoughts against him.
ETA: I have never been in a bdsm relationship, and obviously there is a power imbalance here because of the set up of this fic, so please take everything I write with a grain of salt. This is not meant to portray real life.
When Tony had asked him to move in with him, he’d been so happy.  It was a big step, and they’d only known each other for three months, but it felt
“Just—” Steve swallowed.
“I’m glad you’re okay,” Tony said, breaking the silence and making Steve snap out of his daze as a wash of guilt swept over him.
“Tony?” Steve asked, glancing uncertainly over his shoulder at him, and Tony somehow found a smile for him.
He tried to keep most of his weight off of Tony’s legs, but Tony just rolled his eyes, saying, “Will you sit down already?” as he slid his hands up Steve’s back in order to grab his shoulders, yanking him down.
Steve set everything out on the coffee table carefully, doing his best to ignore the mess of guilt and nerves that made his hands want to tremble. It became exponentially harder when the first thing Tony did, before he sat down, before he moved around the table even, was offer him an opened bar of chocolate, and Steve realized that although Tony had gotten more than enough for the both of them, the
Steve became very still. “I see,” he said at last, straightening up, his voice curiously blank.
He had to resist the urge to touch Steve in order to offer some kind of comfort that, at best, Steve wouldn’t feel, and at worst, would pull him from his desperately-needed rest.
Steve walked towards the door, blinking until he could see clearly. Make coffee for Tony. He could do that.
And the milking! He thought milking might be the bane of his existence. It felt so good to start out with,
“Steve,” he said, quiet and aching, and then neither of them said anything for a while.
He always knew his relationship with Bucky was going to be temporary.  Bucky was a year older and had already accepted a job in Spain with the company he’d interned with over the summer. He had dark brown eyes and tried to teach Steve Spanish when they weren’t studying or messing around.  Even with the end in sight, Steve didn’t freak out when Lisa’s scars got smaller overnight it seemed.  He wasn’t looking forward to the damage Bucky would leave when they broke up, but he wasn’t going to waste the time either, not when Bucky was right there, and Steve could see Bucky’s scars fading, too.
"Make me some coffee, Steve."
“Do you mean it?” Thor asked, searching his eyes for the truth.
“How do you think
“Well then.”
For now, though, Tony had to figure out a way to let Steve know just how good Tony thought he was.
He’d always put Steve first, from the very first day when he’d taken on a Sub he hadn’t planned on and then gave him a list of rules that included telling Tony one thing he wanted every day.
“There’s nothing to apologize for, Steve. Really. Different people have different reactions, and one response isn’t more valid than another.”
“Try harder next time,” Tony told him, but then he sighed at the crestfallen expression on Steve’s face. “Fine. Let me show you how it’s done.”
They sat on the couch in silence for a long time, until some of the lines bracketing Steve’s mouth had finally smoothed out and Tony was confident that the worst of it had passed for Steve.
And there were those damn puppy eyes again. “Tony,” he said, and Tony could tell he wasn’t going to let it go.
For those of you interested, I am writing a Nostalgia AU that's a little less angst-filled if you want to check it out
“Ah, is my little puppy getting too excited?” Tony asked, and Steve would’ve shriveled up in embarrassment … if he hadn’t noticed that Tony’s voice was lower than it’d been a moment ago, if the hand on Steve’s back hadn’t seemed heavier.
“Within a month, I think, yes.” He held up his hand to keep Steve’s outburst at bay. “I’m used to going out on my own, and as my file no doubt told you, I don’t play well with others. It’s as much for my benefit as it is for yours. We’ll train together. It’ll be fine, you’ll see.”
Although … would he have recovered enough by tomorrow to hurt Steve the way he deserved? Should they wait even longer so Tony could—
The realization that he’d been wrong, that Tony was actively hurting … Steve hadn’t thought he could hate himself more, but he could. It was shocking by just how much. If he hadn’t needed to take care of Tony, he honestly didn’t know what he would’ve done, left maybe, walked away before he could add even one more transgression to the mountain of his sins, but that wasn’t an option at the moment. Tony had to come first.
“Number three is around meals. We eat together, or at the very least, we’re in the same room during meal times.”
“Right,” Tony said, licking his lips and watching Captain America follow the drag of his tongue, sweat beading on his forehead.  “I totally believe you.”
or anything; it’s just good to have a clean apartment is all, in case unexpected visitors decide to drop in.
Living alone had improved his cooking, so he was able to make pancake batter from scratch, and he cleaned and halved some strawberries, putting everything away in the refrigerator. He got the pans out he’d need for the pancakes and the bacon, set the table, and then he waited for Tony. And waited some more, trying not to be impatient, even though that had never been a strong suit of his.
“Get up on your feet now, but your head needs to stay on the ottoman,” Tony said after some interminable time, and Steve could hear how distracted he was, Steve just an afterthought, and he had to tell himself that it was because he was being punished, that Tony would want him otherwise.
“Almost two years now,” he said, even though it’d been closer to six months.  He pasted on a smile.  “But I’ve worked on cars my whole life.”
All my love to MetaAllu. <3
That wasn’t possible. But that didn’t change the fact that Tony was looking at Steve like he was … the word “precious” came to mind, but Steve discarded that thought almost immediately. “Cute” maybe. Although that still was hard to believe, and Steve was sure that if anyone else ever saw him, the kindest description they’d give would probably be “ridiculous.”
He shifts slightly, his cock rubbing against the mattress, the ache inside his body going all the way up his spine.  Of course, that just might make it better . . .
you did what you did, and you took your punishment to the best of your ability—”
He laughed at the question. “So damn much,” he said and had to take a shaky breath.

Steve was so warm. It was something Tony had noticed before, but it hadn’t mattered as much as whatever they’d been doing at the time, sparring or hugging or whatever. So what if Steve’s temperature ran a little high? With his face in Tony’s hands, however, with Tony’s tongue in his mouth, it was difficult to ignore. Steve was so fucking warm, and it made every part of him not touching Steve feel cold in comparison.

Even DUM-E hadn’t moved the entire time Steve had been cleaning, not even when he’d touched it hesitantly, the only sign of life a blinking light to show that at least there was still power flowing through it. Tony hadn’t said anything about it, but Steve knew he had a soft spot for DUM-E, knew that it was more than a robotic arm that Tony directed when needed, and Steve couldn’t figure out why Tony had left DUM-E the way he had. For a second, Steve had panicked that JARVIS had also been shut down or taken away, but then he remembered speaking to him on more than one occasion since he’d gotten back, and that worry, at least, had been quieted. But everything else …
The fucking machine just wouldn’t work, guys. I tried and I tried, and I rewrote portions of this chapter multiple times, but it just never felt right. Sorry for the people looking forward to it! I might add it in an epilogue one day instead. Assuming I ever get the end of this fic, and it doesn’t go to a million words, omg. >_> I mean, this feels really close. But I said that about 25K ago too, so...
Getting up to the fifth floor wasn’t too hard. They’d already hacked into the security feeds, and he had I. D. cards from the guards he’d taken out, so it was just a matter of running up the stairs and taking out the one person he met on the way.
Okay.
“Tell me if it hurts too much,” Tony ordered, putting his hands on Steve’s bent arms, and he lowered his head.
, get out to the public, I promise.  I've kept the secrets to the Iron Man technology, haven't I?  Please, Steve?  Let me.”
. He stared at himself in the mirror with wide eyes. Should he prepare himself?
“Pepper’s making me. I have ‘responsibilities’ apparently,” Tony says, and Steve can hear the air quotes.
Steve shook his head as Dr. Strange pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.
“What’s your safeword?” he asked and couldn’t stop the sharp smile that bloomed on his face when Steve answered.
He moaned, unable to contain the pain at the thought that Tony would be gone by the time Steve was dragged out of the ice again.
(See the end of the chapter for
He smiled, quite innocently he thought, when Steve looked over his shoulder at him, but perhaps not quite innocently enough if the the way Steve’s eyes widened were any indication. Still, Steve did it, taking a deep breath and resting his left knee on the tile, hesitating for a second before adjusting his stance to leave himself open without Tony even having to ask.
“Aha!” Tony said, twisting and shoving in order to take advantage of Steve’s momentary lapse in attention and his unbalanced position.
Okay, short chapter, but I'm just checking to see if people are still reading this. >>
“Why not?” Tony asked, looking baffled.
Swimming like this gets monotonous after a while. Since he’s above water, it’s just sun, sun, sun, and the Angel is still unconscious, so there’s nothing to do but watch him or the horizon and occasionally turn his head to check that they’re not going to bump into any debris. He’s made this trip a few times, admittedly underwater, but he can feel where he is in relation to the land, so there’s no danger of getting lost.
“I do want to.” More than Tony would ever know.
Fury stared at him thoughtfully with his one good eye for a long time before nodding and saying, “Alright.  Come with me.”
—he just couldn’t.
It takes a moment for Steve’s brain to catch up with what’s just happened, slowing down the quick, deft movements until it seems like Tony is virtually stroking his arms, and Steve stares and stares at the revealed skin, barely blinking.
“I’m not trying to—”
Okay. He could … he could handle this. He hadn’t planned on Steve finding out, but he could … he could …
“Just until tomorrow. I already have an idea that might work, but I need to think about it a little more, so if you don’t mind, I’m going to spend some time in my study to figure out the details. You can come get me if you need anything, anything at all, but it shouldn’t be more than a couple of hours, and I should be done in time for lunch.”
It wasn’t as if there were many options. Everyone had a job to do, and there hadn’t been any time to argue about who should do what.
“Look, I really missed you guys, maybe not as much as I thought I did before spending four days of being locked up in here, but still, a lot, really and truly,” it said, and Steve remembered that tired tilt of his mouth, the rigid line of shoulders that spoke without words that Tony wasn’t going to give up without a fight, “but I’m starting to miss alone time more, real alone time, not just time where it’s me and all the cameras pointing at me.”
“Nice,” Tony says as Steve gets out of orbit and realizes Tony must be doing patrols. They’re both too high-level for it to be exciting, but it doesn’t matter. He doesn’t really care what they do as long as they’re doing it together.
Steve was standing outside his door at seven in the morning when Tony—scratch that, when Tony’s driver came by.  He said good morning to Happy and peered into the backseat where Tony was sprawled, nursing a huge cup of coffee, sunglasses firmly in place.
(See the end of the chapter for
, or whatever it is you’re doing,” Tony said, rolling onto his side out of self-preservation. When Steve had offered to give him a massage, he’d been delighted and had already made plans on how things would segue into sexy times.
“Feel free to keep picking things up, though!” Tony said, slapping him cheerfully on the arm, and Steve couldn’t think of a response—to any of it—before he was gone.
-----
He felt exhausted down to his very bones, his thoughts cloudy and disjointed, but he was grateful for it, too tired to concentrate on anything, especially the person sitting across from him at the table.
Dr. Stark doesn’t, of course. All he does is exactly what Steve’s asked, stretching him open carefully, waiting until the tension leaves his body to lock the speculum in place.
Thor had nodded in recognition of the words, but even then, it’d been too late.  There was nothing he could hide from Loki, his feelings least of all.
Omg, this is so damn angsty. What even happened? This was an excuse to write porn. Idek.
Fuck.
?” he asked, his voice coming out strained even to his own ears, because seriously.
He feels like every muscle is clenched tight, as if he can keep the orgasm back by will alone, and he’s getting a cramp in his left foot from how curled up his toes are, but he can’t, he can’t, he—
He’d known to expect it, but it still hurt, Tony somehow speeding up even more, shoving his growing knot into Steve’s already aching hole, just to yank it back out again. It should’ve made Steve tense up and struggle to not jerk away, but … .
But while his head believed it, his heart didn’t, and he was finished and waiting by the elevator in record time, the need to check on Tony warring with the need to
Stark had warned him, “In the interest of full disclosure, JARVIS will know each and every website you go to and every keystroke you make. You see that camera?” he’d said, pointing to what might have been a tiny dot on the wall. “It’s recording us right now, and just like there are cameras in every room, JARVIS has eyes that see every piece of information that comes and goes into this building.”
Truthfully, so far, Stark hadn’t been acting too much
Don’t … don’t come out? Was he locking Steve in his room? Or was there a reason that he’d—
“What?”
He’d hoped to avoid doing it tonight, but he’d been a slave to his body’s demands his whole life, and that hadn’t changed even after the serum.
Tony lifts his head off the counter and looks at him with betrayed eyes.
Steve shifted in his chair and looked back towards the hallway one more time before moving the mouse. He let the arrow hover over the link for a few seconds, wondering if he should follow it or not. Stark had never said he couldn’t research him, however, and he’d already read the file SHIELD had given him before they presented Stark, and it was all public information anyway.
TW: This chapter really has Steve in a bad headspace, and he agrees to things because he feels like he can't disagree, even though he really doesn't want to. Please be aware and read with caution.
He looked at Steve, taking in the shadows under his eyes and the tense line of his jaw, present even in sleep. He supposed he should be grateful that Steve was sleeping at all since, according to JARVIS, Steve had barely closed his eyes for the past two nights. Steve might’ve allowed himself to be guided to Tony’s bed, but he’d been acting like an unwanted guest there ever since, keeping to the very edge of the mattress and staying glued in place throughout the night, watching Tony, almost always watching him, but making no move to touch him or lay closer.
“Other than an increased appetite for meat, no,” Tony said, waggling his eyebrows at Steve.
Even if it
“No, really. I know this is a wild and crazy idea, but maybe instead of talking to me, you should be talking to Steve.”
For the “Time travel” prompt of avengers_tables.
Steve should’ve said something then, had wanted to, had been tempted to lie and claim he’d already known that Stark would never use him like that. He rarely lied to himself, however, and he never lied to anyone else with the exception of the enemy, and Stark kept trying to prove over and over again that he didn’t belong in that category.
And the fact that Tony is making an effort to provide Steve something he so obviously enjoys …
His fingers twitched pathetically in the direction of a washcloth. “Pepper . . .”
Truth be told, it was what Tony would’ve done if their situations had been reversed.  There was something extremely satisfying in testing to see how far a person could be pushed, not to mention the fact that even forcing a punishment was a type of control, which Steve had absolutely none of right now.
“Um, something like that,” Tony said and initiated the program TENTACLES1.
“Yeah?” Tony said, and Steve could hear the caution in his voice.
But he didn’t, squeezed his eyelids together instead as he took a deep breath and then lifted his head and did what Tony had asked, squinting slightly at how bright it was in the room after the blindfold.
At SHIELD, it’d been incredibly frustrating to encounter website after website that was blocked to his access as he attempted to understand more about the world he was now a part of. That didn’t seem to be an issue at Stark’s, although Steve had apparently traded that greater freedom for even more supervision.
