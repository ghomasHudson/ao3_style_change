Although Sam has followed into the family business, he had always wanted to try his hand at something scholarly and was currently pursuing that dream at a school in Boston. Dean is on his way to visit Sam as a surprise.
Before Castiel reached the door, Sam spoke one last time. "Thanks, Cas, for talking with me. I didn't know I need to let it out."
Dean has barely registered what came out of the Angel's mouth before Castiel was halfway across the room with a foot on the stairs that lead outside. Before he could stop himself, he jumped out of his seat and grabbed Castiel's wrist and turned him so that they faced each other. "What are you doing, Dean?! Let me go! You're putting yourself and your brother at risk by keeping me here and I refuse to be the cause of more hardship between you anymore! I'm trying to make this easier for you. Don't make this harder than it already is," Castiel pleaded. He refused to look at his Hunter in the eyes because he wasn't strong enough to deal with all these emotions.
"And what does that mean, asshole?!" fired Dean. The Hunter cannot believe what he's just heard. Castiel must really be on a high horse to be talking that way to Dean. How many times has the Angel fallen for some ploy? How many time has Dean forgiven
Sam snorted into his food as Castiel let a small smile creep onto his face before it fell into a sad expression. "It is a shame, then, that I will only be enjoying it for one night," said Castiel solemnly.
Hardly two weeks ago he'd had the fuck of his life in the back of his car, and now he's here all on his own. No Angel in the seat next to him, and no little brother in the back seat to shoot disgusted faces at them in the rear-view mirror. What a life he's living now. He keeps a firm grip on his steering wheel and just races down the road.
"My apologies," laughed Castiel as he laid a kiss on Dean's lips. Grabbing his member, Castiel rubbed himself teasingly at Dean's entrance before finally pushing in.
"You guys are so screwed." The witch laughed at their predicament and squeezed harder on their throats.
"We learned some things about you though, didn't we, darlings?" teased Rowena. "For starters you were very sweet to everyone. I was completely unaware you were capable of gentility. It says a lot about your life, I think." The witch's smile did nothing but grate on Dean's nerve. "You were especially sweet on your handsome little angel here when he swaggered in to come to your rescue."
"I know that it's the mark of Cain..." Dean spoke. Sure, Cain had mentioned consequences, but he didn't get into detail and, honestly, Dean would have taken the mark regardless. There was no other way of getting rid of Abaddon, so what choice does he have? Consequences be damned.
The two brothers take their time walking around the campus (Dean leading Baby around behind him) and catching up on each other's lives when they find themselves in front of the classroom of Sam's History professor. When they walk into it, they see a figure at the front writing on the chalkboard. As Sam makes his way over, Dean hangs back by the door and studies the man from a distance.
"They're beautiful," said the Angel as he caressed the face of the figure representative of Dean. He turned to find the Hunter standing directly behind him and his breath caught in his throat.
"There is nothing that I could say that would change what you have already planned to do to me," answered Castiel in falsely even tone. If he was being truthful, he was terrified of what his siblings had in store for him. Angels were craftier than Demons.
“Whoa,” whispered Dean with wide eyes. He openly ogled at the trench coated figure still standing near the door.
"Sam, we may as well go to sleep. Kevin will be here soon, and the books will still be here in the morning," croaked Castiel. Hours of disuse had taken its toll apparently.
"Wow, Dean, we haven't done something that childish in forever, man," gasped Sam still laying on the floor.
"Sorry, who?" This asshole had to be pulling his leg because nothing of the past minute makes any sense. He has half a mind to just shoot the other man and continue with his life.
"I don't know. I like get a flash of something and then I snap out of it and then I can't remember what the hell I just saw. Fuck, I haven't slept in four days, but I've got to find Cas."
"Really we're going to do this? Now?" Dean growled. It was none of this rat bastard's business about his issues with Castiel. "Since when the fuck do you care? Did your heart grow three sizes when I wasn't looking?" When the Demon remained quiet, Dean couldn't stop what he says next, "You can't zap outta here, can you? Cain got you limp or something?"
"'Cause it's my job to know these things. Now, if anything happens, you know that Kevin's here to help and if he can't help you then you know that I'm only a few hours away, ok?"
Castiel turned his gaze back to the road and nodded. "Of course, Dean." He knew there wouldn't be a "later" to speak of, but resigned himself to silence anyway.
Dean grunted and stepped forward to slice through the tattoo on his brother's chest, a grimace present on his features. The Angel stepped forward to rub a reassuring hand up and down his lover's back just as Sam's body engulfed Crowley.
"I saw you, Crowley," he intoned while stepping out of Baby. "Back at Cain's. You dusted that undercard Demon, and then you just sat back and watched the main event. You knew. You knew about the mark, you knew about Abaddon and Cain. You knew all of it. And you played me. Why?"
"Is that budoir smile for me?" asked Crowley as he sat next to Dean. He gave a disgusted look to the dingy bar the two men had walked into 20 minutes ago. "This bar is a bust. Your prey, Gadreel, has left the building, if our preliminary search is any indication. So, it's time to move back onto more pressing matters-like destroying Abaddon," Crowley pleaded.
"It means that you are an idiot," Castiel sneered. "Do you even know what that mark does?" he asked while he gestured to the other man's arm.
"I honestly don't know. I just know that you and I have been skirting around this thing-this mutual feeling we have between us for too fucking long and this might be the only time I ever get to express it to you," Dean stated in a hurry as if afraid that if it wasn't said quick enough, it wouldn't be said at all. "I don't know if something will happen to me or to you and I never see you again, and I don't want to regret never having taken this step with you."
"I think you just had a panic attack, man." Sam is definitely shooting his brother when he sees him again. "Let's just relax today, alright? We've had a lot of shit happen over the past few days, we need a breather. Sound good?" They can cover more ground when they're not as distracted, and Sam really could do with some time alone to himself.
Dean can't hold back anymore and punches him. That smarmy dick's death has been on delay for way too fucking long. Crowley's talent seems to be in always making sure he is relevant, and it drives Dean insane. The taller man cannot wait for the day that he gets to rip the Demon a new one.
Dean couldn't take it anymore and with a growl removed Castiel's hand and plunged in rapidly. He didn't allow Castiel to get used to the feeling before he quickly pulled back and thrust forward forcefully. With a rigorous pace set, he leaned forward and kissed his Angel for all he's worth, hardly breaking for air.
Dean shook his head violently and focused a harsh gaze upon Castiel. The Angel was aware that the gaze was more in self-loathing than anything else, and that any anger isn't really being directed at him, but at Dean himself. "So you just let me carve into you for five years? Over and over?!" The Hunter was pulling at his hair at what could only be painful levels. His voice shook as he asked, "Why?"
Dean waited until the Demon was out of ear shot before he answered breathlessly, "Hey, sweetheart, you've had me worried all day. You never called to tell me when to come get you." Dean froze at the dark chuckle that came through the speaker.
“You remembered my name!” she said, giggling loudly. “You’re hot.” She whispered, and Dean could smell the mixture of alcohols on her breath. She wrapped her hands around his neck and leaned in, trying to kiss him. Dean turned his head and her lips fell clumsily onto his neck instead. Dean grabbed her hips and held her away.
Dean felt the head of Cas’ cock teasing at his entrance, making him moan and try to push his hips down onto it.
But this wasn’t once upon a time. He had told Cas that he would try to be…well, less reckless. And everyone else be damned, he was gonna do right by the angel this time. Dean blinked out of his revere and moved around the bed to put an arm around Castiel and pulled the angel flush against him, feeling the sudden need to be close to him. Cas made a humming noise in the back of his throat and let his head fall back against Dean’s shoulder.
“We have to go on the assumption it may be. We want to talk to her at any rate. Do you remember anything else about her? The smallest detail may help.” She shook her head.
in that way but oh, God he wanted to be. He wanted the gentle touches and the loving kisses even if he didn’t deserve them. “Cas, please.” he whimpered. He was already hard underneath the angel’s careful ministrations, and he was starting to get desperate for friction. Cas lifted his head and surveyed Dean with a soft smile before he started to move his hands again. He kissed Dean’s chest once more before covering the man’s mouth with his own in a sweet kiss that Dean enthusiastically reciprocated. Cas hummed happily and moved his hands to cradle Dean’s face while simultaneously bringing their hips together.
“Last time I heard, he was at Jefferson’s, killing his liver.” The way she said it made it clear this was a long-running fight between the two of them.
"I certainly hope so." Castiel teased. He didn't want to bring up the time, because they were almost late. He didn't want his time to with Dean to end. One day, maybe. One day maybe they wouldn't have to sneak blowjobs on their lunch breaks.
“But I do.” Cas said matter-of-factly, and damn it that didn’t send a wave of heat straight to Dean’s dick.
Dean smiled, excitement building his his chest as he willed the elevator to hurry. He wanted to see Castiel. The ride seemed to take forever, but finally he was in the parking deck and making his way towards his car. There weren't many people parked down this way.
“I have my car.” Amanda said. “And I’ll need it anyway. Since I’m supposed to leave with my daughter.” She said.
. He squirmed uncomfortably as Dean changed him. He didn’t really understand how Dean could be so nonchalant about it. Then Cas remembered that Dean didn’t see him as Cas, he saw him as a baby. And there was nothing
Gabriel sighed and rested his head on Sam’s massive chest. He focused on the steady rise and fall of the hunter’s chest, allowing it to lull him into a restful sleep.
So Gabriel threw back the blankets and mojo’d himself some clothes on before going to the door and opening it.
but he managed to get him up. Castiel hummed happily and they kissed the entire way to their bedroom. Castiel had his hands tangled in Dean’s hair and Dean tried to lay Castiel on the bed, but his boyfriend wasn’t having it. Cas kept himself wrapped around Dean, forcing Dean to fall on the bed with him. Dean couldn’t stop the smile that crept onto his face as he tumbled down on top of his boyfriend.
He caught his angel’s eye from across the table and it told him that Castiel was thinking along the same lines as Dean. Wordlessly, he stood up.
The final few miles to Casmiria’s place were tense, to say the least. Everyone was on edge, and Andrew looked downright scared. The rest of them, having done similar stuff before, were a little more calm. Andrew kept rustling his hands, which were tied with a black cord (the one, ironically enough, that would be used to bind Casmiria). Sam was staring out the window, Gabriel was staring at Sam (or out the window, Dean wasn’t really sure) and Cas and himself were both focused on the blacktop directly in front of them. Finally, they pulled to the side of the road at Casmiria’s house. Wordlessly, they all climbed out of the car. They stood there for a moment, just looking at the house.
“Thanks, Dean.” She stood up to make her way to his office. “Have fun.” She winked as she walked down the hall. Dean shook his head walked towards the door. Bobby caught him just as he was walking out the door.
that Dean couldn’t help but to moan along with him. It was too soon for him to get hard again but his dick sure was giving a valiant effort. Cas shuddered above him.
"Or we could share." Castiel suggested, stepping into the room just as Dean turned the light on. Dean almost swallowed his tongue.
“Dean, now. Please.” Castiel said, whimpering again. Dean scissored his fingers, trying to hurry up the slow process of prepping his boyfriend. Castiel groans and pushes himself down on the fingers.
“No! Well…not exactly. He just made me feel bad about it. So I’m apologizing for being a crappy person.” Sam sighed.
He felt like such a girl. Ever since him and Cas had started…well had started whatever it was that they were doing, Dean felt like he had barely seen his angel. He knew that Castiel was busy with finding Metatron and trying to lead his squadron of angels but dammit, a guy had needs.
“From being human. He will still have some…human traits. Such as eating, sleeping, using the bathroom. Things like that.” She wiped her hands off on her long skirt. “I’ll show you out. And remember, Dean Winchester,” She turned to him and raised her finger. “Keep your word, otherwise being an infant will be the last of your worries.” Dean rolled his eyes.
“You’re going to have to forgive the mess…with everything that’s been going on lately, cleaning just hasn’t been a priority.” Dean nodded, and Cas spoke in a low, calming voice.
“What was that?” Dean bit his lip, the harshness in Castiel’s voice sending chills down Dean’s spine. Dean swallowed.
“What if we were to take out the warding first? You know how those things work – if you change them at all, they become powerless.” Sam said.
“Cas, c’mon, man, ‘m ready.” he said, his hips coming up to meet each thrust of Castiel’s fingers. The angel must have decided that Dean had had enough because he pulled his fingers out and found the lube bottle again. Dean had to remind himself how to breathe as he heard Castiel slicking himself up.
He didn’t have time to think beyond that because at that moment, he flew across the room towards Andrew, who had just managed to get the circle cast. He was met by invisible force acting from the opposite way and looked around to see that it was none other than Gabriel that had kept him from crashing into the man. Dean fell straight to the floor, landing on his ass. He struggled to stand because the only two left standing were him and Gabriel, as Sam and Cas were both unconscious. Gabriel eye’s flashed as he threw Casmiria back using his angel mojo.
Cas feels Dean press against his back and wrap an arm around him. He must be doing this unconsciously, in his sleep. Why else would he hold Castiel like this?
“How did you find him yesterday?” Dean asked. Sam jerked his head towards Gabriel, who was sitting in the backseat ginning like the Cheshire Cat. Dean resisted the urge to roll his eyes once again. The pint-sized archangel was really getting on his nerves today, and the last thing he wanted to do was ask him for a favor.
“Gabriel? What the hell?” Dean said, wiping his hands on a dish towel. Instead of answering, Gabriel held out a black-haired, blue-eyed baby.  Dean took one step closer to examine the kid. Then he yelled to his brother.
“Come here, baby. Let me hold you.” Dean said, and Cas scooted closer. “No, turn around. Put your back against my chest.” Castiel complied, and turned around, leaning back against Dean. The man wrapped his arms around Cas and rested his head on the other man’s shoulder, sighing contentedly. Cas leaned his head back and nuzzled Dean’s cheek and put his hands on Dean’s, lacing their fingers together. They sat in silence for a few minutes, just enjoying being close to each other. Castiel raised their interlaced hands to his mouth and kissed him.
“Both.” Dean smiled and started to kiss his boyfriends neck. Cas moaned lightly and threw his head back, giving Dean better access. Dean smiled to himself and licked a stripe from the juncture of his boyfriend’s shoulder to his ear. Cas moaned and turned his head to give Dean a heated kiss, letting go of Dean’s hand in the process and tangling that hand into Dean’s hair and licking his way into his mouth. Dean took advantage of his hand being free and began to trail it down Cas’ stomach, pleased to find his boyfriend was already half-hard. As he took Cas in hand and began to stroke him, Cas thrust forward into Dean’s hand, breaking away from the kiss. Dean felt himself begin to grow hard and pushed his own hips forward against the small of Cas’ back, causing the other man to let out an even louder moan.
Gabriel was pulled out of his doze by an unceremonious knocking at the door. He grumbled and burrowed further under the blankets.  It took him a moment to realize he was alone. He sat up and looked blearily around the room. The bathroom door was shut and he heard water running, so he knew that was in there. Whoever was at the door knocked again, and Gabriel honestly considered just crawling back under the covers and leaving Sam to deal with whoever.
Dean wanted to point out that it was completely unfair that he was lying there completely naked and Cas still had his pants on, but the way Cas was looking at him rendered him speechless. The angel always looked at him like he was the most amazing thing he had ever seen, but the sheer amount of reverence in the Cas’ gaze made it hard for Dean to breathe. There wasn’t any way he deserved to be looked at like that.
“How about you let me decide that? Besides, it’s my price. You want to go home and have crazy sex with Cas? Give me Jo’s number, and I’ll do your paperwork and you can go home and make your boyfriend scream all night.” She waggled her eyebrows. Dean groaned dramatically.
“Dean I’m…Cas whimpered, and suddenly Dean felt Cas spilling down his throat. He swallowed best he could, but felt a little dribble onto his chin as Cas pulled himself out of Dean’s mouth. Two strokes later and Dean was coming all over his own hand, while looking up at Cas’ sated and wrecked face. Cas leaned down and kissed him, licking at Dean’s chin and assumingly his own come.
“Are you sure there isn’t anything wrong?” he asked him, keeping one hand on his arm so the angel couldn’t walk away. Cas sighed.
Dean nodded. “Uh, yeah. I mean, he’s already your brother, and seeing him as a child must be…I dunno, making you have some sort of paternal instincts? It happens.” Dean said with a shrug.
“Castiel.” Cas said, taking her hand. “But you can call me Cas.” Dean saw the surprise on Castiel’s face as Ellen used the grip to pull him into a hug. After a moment, Castiel even hugged her back.
Just then, the snapping of a twig alerted Dean to the presence of someone else. He whipped around, pulling his gun from his holster in the same moment, pointing it at the intruder.
“Yeah, I guess so. Treat him like any other baby.” Dean said, looking down and rocking the little angel gently. Cas wasn’t so sure he liked this yet, but Dean was much gentler than Gabriel had been. Then Cas noticed something, something that caused both Sam and Dean to wrinkle their noses.
“That’s all fine and dandy but we have more pressing matters.” Dean ignored the glare from Sam.  “Right now, we need to find out what we’re up against. For instance, how did she get her powers back?” Andrew looked up.
“I know. But women were all you were with for so long, Dean. And I know I can’t…” Dean shut him up with a kiss.
As Dean turned into the small parking lot, he felt a hand on his thigh. He glanced at Castiel, gave him a quick smile, and then parked the car. In the next second, he had a lapful of Castiel. Dean kissed him back with a chuckle, reaching down to let the seat back to give them both more room.
He was prepping himself. For Dean. Dean groaned and ran his hands over Cas’ shoulders and down his back. Cas breathing stuttered and he arched into Dean’s touch. Cas started kissing all over Dean’s chest as he stretched himself, and pushing his hips down into Dean’s stomach in search of friction. Dean could see Cas unraveling under his own ministrations and was struck with a bitter feeling that it wasn’t
. A soul that I saw struggling to burn brighter than the Hell Fire that almost consumed it. A soul that I nursed back to health in the only way that I know how: through forgiveness. And look at what you have done with that forgiveness. You have shoved it back into my face."
Dean places a hand near the angel’s face so that he can lean closer to him. “Hey, handsome. Big bird over there says you’re in the friend zone? Well, I don’t know what was wrong with past me because there’s no way I’d leave someone as hot as you hanging dry,” he whispers salaciously. He grabs the lapels of the coat and pulls the shorter man closer to him. His right hand begins to trail across the raven-haired man’s chest. Castiel’s breath hitches as fingertips dance across his nipples through his shirt. His hand continues to travel south until he cups the angel’s cock, which twitches in interest. “Were you a bad boy, Cas?” he breathes. “Is that why we didn't get anywhere?” he smirked. Dean immediately regretted the taunt because the sudden sadness that draped over the shorter man’s face. Dean faintly hears the sounds of scurrying and dragging accompanied with harsh whispers and the quick open and close of the door.
Mere minutes later the two men are crashing about the motel room trying to make their towards the bed. Kissing with their eyes closed was making that very difficult, however. When Castiel's legs hit the bed he promptly turns them around and roughly shoves Dean down on it. Castiel could see Dean's pupils dilate even further as he shivered. This reaction made him recall something he had observed over the years.
"'Sweetheart?!' Oh, how domestic of you, Dean! Castiel, if you weren't so screwed right now, I'd congratulate you."
The hunter ran his tongue along the seam of Castiel's lips and surged the organ forward when he felt the Angel gasp, winning the fight for dominance not long after. Just as it was getting difficult to breathe, Dean moved his attention to the smaller man's jaw. He reveled in the feel of stubble on stubble against his cheek as he ventured further and grabbed the lobe of Castiel's ear between his teeth. The man underneath him shuddered and thrust his hips upwards in response to the sensation.
"I-I know, Cas, I just...can you come within at least a day's drive from here so my brother can go see you? He won't admit it to me but I know that's what it is. He's got this ridiculous need to assert his manliness and "lack" of emotions in order to keep a facade that no one here gives two shits about. He misses you and he can't bring himself to say it out loud."
“Sucks to be that guy,” exclaimed the very guy being discussed. This was too much for Sam. He wishes he had someone else he could talk to besides Rowena right about now. Someone that could sympathize better with them and their cause and knows them in ways the witch doesn’t.
"What's wrong, Dean?" asked the Angel in a calming tone so as to ground Dean from his panicked state.
The younger Winchester looked around confused before settling on his brother's face. "Dean? I-I...I don't know if I'm ok," Sam mumbled as he gently pushed his brother away from himself and stood to walk past everyone.
That first swipe of the the Angel's tongue almost sent Dean over the edge. He wantonly spread his legs further apart and grabbed Castiel's hair with a trembling hand. "Cas, baby, that feels so fucking good, don't stop," he mewled.
But maybe it was for the best. If Castiel had stayed he might not have allowed him to leave at all. He begrudgingly got out of bed and just as Dean was walking into his bedroom, he heard his cell phone ringing. He ran over to it and caught it right before it cut to voicemail.
"Would you allow me to finish, beloved, before you come to the wrong conclusion?" Castiel asked, patiently running a hand through his lover's hair to calm him. He continued when Dean nodded, "Now, before I rescued you they didn't have a stable color at all. They would constantly shift all over the Angelic spectrum of colors and I was often chastised for it. It was quite embarrassing actually. But then I was called to do that which I was created to do. We laid siege to Hell and the constant barrage of Hell Fire turned them to black, and I couldn't have been prouder. I was still different from others but now they were a symbol of my devotion to the mission. They were a symbol of my devotion to
"Cas, what in the actual FUCK are you doing?" Dean angrily whispered casting a wary glance around him.
"Samuel," Castiel stated firmly, "you know perfectly well that I cannot return. I will not risk your safety."
Castiel didn't answer until after he sped up his rhythm a little and slowed it back down tauntingly. "I'll tell you what I did, Dean. I teased myself a little. Circling my rim with three fingers before plunging them in, and I was starting to feel so
"If the situation were reversed, you mean you wouldn't do the same?" Castiel asked dreading the answer.
"I was looking forward to meeting you, but now I've gone and given you the worst impression of me," he mumbles.
"Because, Castiel, it is not yet time for you to meet him. You are but a fledgling, how do you expect to protect him, hm? Gabriel has told me that you are neglectful in your studies, my son. Your ignorance could hurt your charge," He answered in a sage tone.
Castiel shook his head. "I don't think I should tell you. It's something you are going to have to remember on your own, beloved." The dark haired man hesitated before placing a soothing hand on his lover's back. Dean allowed the touch, and Castiel counted himself lucky. He knew that this peace was false. Dean would undoubtedly find a way to pour more hatred into himself and would lash out at Castiel as a result. Whatever Dean decides for their relationship Castiel will have to just accept. He couldn't help but sigh to himself. Had he not trusted Metatron he could have kept the burden of this secret off of the Hunter's soul. Now they will have to go through a time of reconciling who they are and what they mean to each other.
Castiel grabs his pillow and shoves it in her face, finally smiling when she yells about him ruining her eyeliner.
.” Castiel slides his hands around Dean’s neck, clenching his eyes shut in a vain attempt to keep his emotions at bay. Dean’s lips brush against his skin, sending a shiver down his spine, and Castiel wants to live inside this moment forever as the song ends, as Dean whispers in his ear, “
Dean deletes the message, then spends a few moments sitting on the couch, rubbing his thumb over the screen. It’s been a few days since the fall out at the Roadhouse, and Dean has spent most of those days curled up on the couch with the TV on for background noise. The gnawing sensation in his chest hasn’t gone away, nor has the whirlwind of self-loathing in his head, but it’s easier to deal with if he doesn’t do anything.
Meg, however, is pleasantly neutral about the whole situation. Which is especially interesting considering she had actually dated Castiel for a few months, and admitted later on, after everything ended, that she had started to have real feelings for him, to want things she knew he couldn’t give her. That had been the real reason for their break-up- Meg wanted out before she was in deep enough to get hurt.
Michael rolls his eyes and gives the door a final hard push, which sends Castiel back to the floor as the door swings open, revealing Dean by the window, wide-eyed and pale.
"That's first on the list. Charlie can sit on her Lord of the Rings box set, we're getting you through
He lands without catching himself, and is a little disoriented as he tries to take in his surroundings. The TV is on, playing the third Back to the Future film. Sunlight streams in through the bay window, and the carpet is soft beneath Dean’s hands as he sits up and takes a few deep breaths. He still has an erection, tucked in his jeans, but it’s nowhere near as prominent as the one from the other night, so Dean ignores it, rubbing his hands over his face instead.
“What?” She sounds hesitant, confused, and of course she is, because what kind of way is that to open a conversation?
Dean goes still for a tense second, then slowly leans away, green eyes darting over Castiel’s face. “You do know,” he says carefully, “‘getting lucky’ is more than just a kiss, right?”
“Of course she likes you!” Dean snaps, offended on Lisa’s behalf. “What makes you think she doesn’t?”
“And what the hell does that mean?” Castiel snaps. His shoulders and knuckles hurt from the tension of trying to keep his anger under control.
Gabe’s mouth tightens. “Still in the car.” He looks up, and the concern on his siblings’ faces must be clear, because he attempts to smile. “You save anything for us?”
Cas rolls his eyes, but he’s smiling still, tracing a finger around a flower petal. “You used to be so shy about your artwork. It’s nice to know you’re learning to appreciate your talent.”
Today, his companions are Benny and Charlie. Technically, Charlie isn’t a knight, but she gets cabin fever sitting in the library all the time, and volunteered to go have an adventure. She’s better company than Jo, cheerfully reciting everything she’s learned recently about summoning spells, letting her voice fill the silence as Dean and Benny keep an eye out for what is apparently a fucking vanishing cottage.
Dean blushes again, which makes her laugh outright, but he feels better, and adores his lovely girlfriend all the more for her understanding.
Then, he registers going up a flight of stairs, a lot of yelling and pounding, and that makes his head hurt so he tucks his face into the neck of whoever is holding him up and whimpers. There’s the smell of peppermint again, and the hand around his waist tightens its grip, but then he’s pitching forward, and there’s another set of hands cupping his face. He can focus enough to register his mother’s eyes, but not quite enough to recognize what that means.
Dean sighs dramatically and hands his sketchbook to Castiel, who eagerly flips through it. These drawings are far better than the ones in the wired notebook; they’re cleaned up and colored, and though Dean obviously leans towards a style that could fit right in with the comic book greats, it’s clear his hand is developing ideas of its own. Castiel recognizes a few of the people in the drawings, a broad-shouldered Captain America, a Joker with a jagged grin, but there’s a lot of experimentation within the pages as well. “Are you taking an art class?” Castiel asks softly, pausing on a drawing of a slice of pie, a pop of red cherries the only color.
So Dean clenches his hand into a fist and drops it to his side, gritting his teeth. From the corner of his eye, he can see Jo shuffling awkwardly; she’s aware of the tension, at least.
“Generally. The big stuff. Y’know.” Castiel tries to keep his expression stoic, but his devastation must show somehow, because Aaron actually winces. “Sorry.”
There’s a few restaurants on the edge of town, and one of them, if Castiel remembers correctly, is the pizza place that Mary Winchester works at. He’s hesitant to see her, considering he has no idea what she knows about his relationship with Dean and he’s not sure he could answer her questions even if she does… but he does know that she’ll let him dry off for a minute, and give him a chance to either wait for the storm to pass or figure out who to call to pick him up.
Castiel scowls, twisting to look at Aaron over his shoulder. “And have this conversation around Dean’s
“I do know what Dean is like,” Castiel says with a frown. “Just because you drink with him sometimes doesn’t mean you know anything about him.”
Mary finally approaches them, offering Castiel’s phone back to him. “That thing’s like a little computer,” she says. “I wasn’t sure how to hang up.”
“How do you think the story will end, Dean?” he asks, voice quiet enough that between the volume and the unexpected affection, Dean barely understands the words. Meg is watching him closely, but Dean can't read her expression.
Castiel goes back downstairs and finds Dean seated on the bed again, but now he’s wearing his old, paint-stained clothes, a sketchbook in his lap. All the candles have been blown out, leaving a faint scent of smoke in the air, and the overhead light has been turned on. Dean smiles at him as he approaches the bed, and Castiel smiles back.
Castiel can’t help thinking at least that’s a plus, and it makes him feel horrible. God only knows what his brother’s doing, if he’s even alive, and here’s Castiel feeling grateful that he doesn’t have to deal with those fights anymore.
Last summer, Dean had gently taken Castiel’s hand and clumsily, endearingly, confessed to having feelings for his friend. Fresh out of a very confusing relationship, Castiel’s heart had still soared and overpowered his disbelief and uncertainty. Honestly, how realistic is it that one boy could develop a crush on another, struggle to accept that those emotions may never be reciprocated, only to eventually find out that his crush had fallen for him as well? It’s like something out of a queer romance novel. It’s fantasy. Nothing more.
And just like that, it’s as if they weren’t just trading their family secrets back and forth, as if the shared moments of pain had never happened. They’re stomping up the stairs to take the television away from Sam and watch yet another movie, just like they have on afternoons prior. But something’s changed in the way Dean looks at Castiel now, and Castiel is fairly certain that it’s a good thing, that it’s reflective of their shared knowledge, and shared trust. If he could just figure out what, exactly, has changed.
Well, that’s a relief if Dean’s ever needed one. He finds himself laughing too, carefree and calm for what feels like the first time in ages.
“Shut up!” Dean drops his arms, his hands clenching into fists, and that’s when Cas finally takes a step back, nervousness ekeing in amongst the hurt and surprise in his eyes. “I never understood why you bothered with me in the first place, and I wish you never had! I’m never going to be some great artist, I’m never going to be better than what I am right now, I’m never going to college, and now that Lisa’s given up on me, I’m never going to be loved!”
They separate then, briefly, so Castiel can go upstairs, wash the dried sweat from his neck, and change into his own pajamas while Dean gets dressed in his. After changing into a different sweater, Castiel removes the unused condoms and lubricant from the pocket of his Northwestern sweater and takes a few deep breaths as he stares at the little packages. After a moment, he pushes them deep down in his suitcase. He won’t need them at school anymore, but maybe he’ll get the chance to use them over the summer. No reason to throw them away just yet.
Sam rolls his eyes. They called their father before they called anyone else, and he’d sworn he’d come to Sileas for the funeral, or as soon as he could get there. Both boys still have trouble trusting their father’s promises, even though he’s been clean and settled down for years now. Old habits die hard. “No,” Sam answers. “It was Lisa.”
They stay like that for a few moments, until Dean catches himself dozing off. Not the best idea on the back of a horse, so he clears his throat and searches his mind for topics of conversation.
Dean mewls at this rejection and rolls over onto his stomach, sliding his underwear down to his knees. He’s alone. Refused by an
“Yeah. I mean, when they first got here, it wasn’t so much ‘fighting’ as Cas being a gross, simpering, ‘Yes, dear,’ kind of boyfriend, and Meg getting off on it.” Anna makes a face. “And I don’t dislike Meg on her own, I’m just not sure how I feel about them together, because not too long ago, Cas started arguing with her. And again, I think she got off on the headbutting at first, but the last couple days have been pretty bad.” She stares at the ceiling, lower lip jutted forward. “I’ll be surprised if they last too much longer.”
But then, an hour later, Cas appears on Dean’s front porch, alone. He’s sweaty and nervous, wearing light blue running shorts and a thin white t-shirt, and as soon as Dean takes in this picture, his best friend with shifty blue eyes and dark, messy hair, he thinks,
The car goes silent. Castiel turns and stares out the window, watching the houses and the trees. He’ll be in LA tomorrow, sunshine and sand and heat, big houses and too many people. Then school in September, Long Island, surrounded by kids his own age and station. Maybe he’ll be better at making friends this year, after this summer, or maybe he’ll just spend his free time on MySpace, chatting with kids on the other side of the country. Maybe Lucifer will find him, let him know that he’s okay and happy and Mother shouldn’t cry anymore. Castiel suddenly feels burdened with opportunity, with awareness of how much time is laid out in front of him, and how much he doesn’t know about what’s written on the next page.
Dean makes a face that might be a smile if it wasn’t so clear that Castiel’s actions have hurt him, and really, Castiel needs to leave right now, or he’ll end up with a faceful of Dean’s lap in an attempt to just make that expression go away and stay away. “You promise? Don’t be a stranger this year, Cas.”
, it took about two hours for him to get back to the castle, so every day he’s traveled that far and started leading Impala around the woods. He took Victor with him one day, and Jo the next. He wanted to go by himself the next day, since Jo spent most of her time whining about the rain, but his mother had only given him a furious glare, and sent Jess to fetch a volunteer from the barracks.
Lisa’s eyes are wide and horrified, her mouth hidden by her hand. Victor is seated next to her, maybe a little too close, but Dean can’t make himself get worked up about that. He’s too zen after that fight. “What?” he says instead, leaning in to Lisa’s neck. She stands before he gets there and runs her hands through her hair.
Mary smiles slightly. “I never knew where to find you when you snuck out, if I was ever even home. So when Cas showed up at the Roadhouse last night and told me what was going on, Ellen let me go find you. If we’d been even a few seconds later, Sheriff Mills would’ve had you in the drunk tank. And then what, Dean? And that smarmy asshole,” Mary huffs, shaking her head. “He just would’ve dragged you down with him. He still might! But at least you weren’t caught at the scene. You still have a chance of getting out of this one.”
times, so you can shut the fuck up about it or I really will be mad.” Dean laughs and follows as Cas heads back to the door. “Do you want to stay over?”
“Yeah, when we were twelve.” Castiel can practically hear his eyeroll. “We held hands and kissed a few times and awkward danced at middle school socials. It was dating then, but it’s not dating now.”
Chuckling, Dean responds, “Well, heats suck and all that, but… that wasn’t really what I meant.” Castiel eyes him curiously, but Dean just rolls his shoulders and shoves away all thoughts of what’s waiting for him at home. “I think I’m done. At least, I’m through the worst of it, so,” he rubs the back of his neck, staring at his reflection in the water. “I should probably head back soon.”
is what he considers affection from his own flesh and blood, then it’s really no wonder he’s so drawn to Dean.
is disgusting. He doesn’t deserve Dean, and if Dean is done playing Castiel’s game, then Castiel can’t blame him for finally closing the door.
Missouri smiles and raises her cup to him. “I could say the same,” she says before taking a sip. Then, quickly, “Dean stop gawking.”
It means, Dean’s not straight. He loved Lisa, however long it took him to admit it, and he genuinely enjoyed having sex with her, but he can’t pretend he’s not curious about sex with Cas, and he definitely can’t ignore the fact that he has romantic feelings for Cas too. Whatever he is, it’s not straight.
They walk through the parking lot, one on each side of the bike. Dean is so preoccupied with the various expensive cars that the only reason he doesn't walk into one is because Cas grabs the bike's handlebars and steers them in another direction.
He knows that Cas was invited. He knows that Jo opted to invite Meg as well, since she’s staying with Cas and it would be rude to exclude her. When Dean balked at the news, Jo had just frowned and said that Meg was funny and obviously made Cas happy, so she can’t be that bad. Dean begs to differ, but has so far managed to keep that opinion to himself.
He’s never admitted that aloud before, and guilt rumbles in his chest when he realizes what he’s said. As much as he’s come to care for her, that was always the problem at the heart of their relationship: Castiel would never really love Meg, and she was smart enough to figure out why. He had
Alastair laughs, low and pleased. “Can you make it to Astoria by seven? This kid has a large basement. I’d like to see what kind of profits you can bring in.”
When Castiel arrives back at the bungalow, it’s already getting dark. He’d run all the way from the park by the elementary school, knowing there was no way he would make it home before Michael, but hoping that the sweat and shortness of breath would help with his alibi.
“Yeah, well, sitting around waiting for people to purify me through prayer don’t make for an interesting picture.”
Then, there’s a cool hand pressed against his forehead, and it feels so good that he whimpers, earning a soft shushing sound and fingers carding through his hair. It’s a nice reprieve, so Dean opens his eyes to finally see his strange, friendly alpha.
Winchester Castle is housed in a fortress, protected by a stone wall at least three times as tall as Castiel. It doesn’t do much to protect the towering castle, but once they’re safely inside the gate, Castiel sees lines and lines of wooden barracks all along the inner walls. “Is your army large?” Castiel asks, alarmed.
Naomi closes her eyes and tucks a lock of auburn hair behind her ear, her pearl earring glinting in the lamp light. “Close your mouth, Michael,” she chastises absently, and Michael catches his dropped jaw, immediately straightening his spine and lifting his chin in an attempt at control. “You heard what I said. It’s not right, the way I let my brother’s brand take over my life.” She sighs, her own carefully crafted expression relaxing, showing the tired lines around her lips and eyes. “I should have retired when Luke left. I finally decided to do so when Gabriel threatened to leave. Seeing the way Luke looked at me when he came back…” Her eyes open, gazing down at her hands, which turn over to expose the palms to the light. Castiel can’t remember the last time he saw his mother look this human. “Castiel looked at me the same way when I arrived here,” Naomi continues softly. “My children don’t trust me. And why should they?”
“Fuck you,” Dean snaps, but it’s weak. Because he’s weak. Because she’s not wrong. The memory of Cas coming to pick him up in Seaside flickers through Dean’s brain, and his hand is already pulling out his phone before he thinks of doing so. It’s only when Bela smiles that he stops himself.
“Everybody likes me more than you,” Cas says flatly, turning back to the window. It’s gray outside, and windy, leaving the water almost black, so Dean’s not sure what he finds so fascinating out there. It rains a lot in Oregon. It probably rains a lot wherever Cas lives too. So what?
Sunlight pours in through the little window near the ceiling, and when Dean turns his head, he can still smell Lisa’s perfume on his pillow, and the lingering scent of sweat and sex. He pushes all images of Cas far out of his head as he reaches under the blankets to grip his cock. Instead, he remembers Lisa spread out on his bed, the way she bit her lip and clung to him as he pistoned inside her. He comes when he thinks of the way she wrapped her legs around his waist and whimpered, and honestly, it’s a bit of a relief to know that he can still jack off while thinking of his girlfriend.
So Meg laughs. And Dean’s not sure if it’s mercy or cruelty when she says, “Straight boys are so predictable. You make one joke about their sexuality, and they just shut down.”
Of course, later, when Dean ends up nursing a black eye, bruised knuckles, and a split lip on top of a killer hangover, he might wish he’d taken Charlie up on her offer. Then, who knows how things might have turned out?
They slip in quietly, and Castiel only sees an empty room, so he tugs Dean along until they tumble onto the couch, giggling and exchanging little kisses. They fuss and fidget until Castiel is spooned up behind Dean, nose pressed into the nape of his neck, and Dean chuckles breathlessly when a stray hand settles on his belly.
“It’s raining cats and dogs, Cas.” Dean chuckles softly, but his brow is furrowed in concern. “I don’t want you to get struck by lightning or anything.”
Castiel takes a deep breath, surprised. The last thing he’d expected was for Dean to be so eager, right off the bat. His stomach swoops in a way that’s both exciting and nauseating, and Castiel is torn between trying to convince Charlie to help him break Dean’s plans, and tearing open his luggage to hunt down that dark blue dress shirt and the silver tie he wore to prom, the one that Anna and Meg said really made his eyes pop.
Once, several years ago, Dean made an off-hand, semi-serious promise to take Castiel to Cannon Beach in Ecola State Park, to see the Haystack Rock featured in
Their eyes meet, and Castiel finds comfort in it. On sunny afternoons, Dean is brilliant, blinding sunshine, but here under the stars, he’s muted grays and purples and blues, his eyes dark and lonely. His freckles are almost invisible, his lips seem somehow fuller, and longing floods Castiel’s veins. He wants to pull Dean close and pet his hair and feel warm breath against his neck, maybe hold him until he falls asleep. It’s impossible to say where this comes from, but Castiel feels it so strongly that he can’t resist at least reaching over to place his hand on top of Dean’s. Dean blinks then, staring down at their hands, before slowly pulling his away.
When Dean calls and invites Castiel to see a movie with him, he almost says no. It’s been a few days, but he’s still feeling bruised and tender from his conversation with Aaron, and his instinct is to push Dean away again.
“I know. Sorry.” he said in a breathless voice. God, he wishes the angel would just hurry up; it’s already been too long and Castiel’s teasing isn’t going to help him last long. Castiel moved so that he was kneeling between Dean’s legs. The man gasped when he felt the angel nuzzle his inner thigh.
“So how are things with you?” Sam smiled and opened his mouth to answer just as the bathroom door opened and Cas stepped out, stark naked, obviously intending to have some ‘alone time’ with Dean. He saw Sam and instantly blushed crimson.
Ellen laughed. “You’ll fit in just fine, Cas.” She said. “Now ya’ll come on inside, it’s too cold to be standing out her shooting the shit.” Dean hefted his bag once more and gestured for Castiel to go first, and they followed Ellen into the house.
ready.” he hissed, as Dean pressed on his prostate again. Dean’s eyes found his own, and it touched Cas to see the concern there.
"Sure. I haven't eaten yet today, so I probably should." Dean said, accepting the wrapped burger the Castiel handed him. He picked up his own burger, as well, though he didn't really want to eat it. Dean had bought it for him. He was definitely going to eat it.
“Oh, Cas. Yes.” Dean said, pushing himself up and down on Cas’ cock. The angel moved with him, taking one hand off of Dean’s hips and placing it around the hunter’s length, stroking in time with each the hunter’s bounces. Dean moved his hands to the angel’s chest so that he had better leverage. Castiel tightened his grip and started pump Dean faster. Dean bit his lip as he felt the heat begin to pool in his stomach.
The archangel whipped his head up to look at him and Sam held his hand out. Sure, it would be a little bit of a reach for Gabriel but Sam was positive that he was able to hold his hand. It was the most he could do for the moment, until they got out of this store and Sam was able to talk to him properly. Gabriel pursed his lips and pretended to think for a moment before he reached up and grasped Sam’s hand. Sam almost sighed. Now maybe the archangel would be at ease.
“You know what? Fuck it. I’ve spent too many nights crying over him, wondering why I wasn’t good enough.” She shrugged. “It’s because I don’t have a dick. He’s…he’s always been this way. I was just too delusional to see it.” She squared her shoulders, preparing to walk off until she thought of another thing. “You knew about me, didn’t you?” she asked, and although Castiel didn’t answer, he knew the silence was damning enough. Of course, he had known. The entire time. “You’re the worst kind of person. Didn’t your parents ever teach you not to play with things that weren’t yours?”
Dean moaned and slipped his hands under Cas’ shirt as he pulled it off not bothering with the buttons. The angel stopped kissing him just long enough to allow Dean to get his shirt off, and then he was kissing him again, sweeping his tongue along Dean’s bottom lip and then plunging it into his mouth. Dean moved his hands from Castiel’s hips so that he could unbutton the angel’s pants. Once this was accomplished, Dean plunged his hand down said pants and started to palm at Castiel’s erection.
Damn, he was in this deep. Deeper than he’d ever thought. He knew he loved Cas, but he hadn’t known that he loved him this much. Enough that Dean was positive he wouldn’t be able to make it if the angel wasn’t in the picture anymore.
“Get to the point, Sam.” Dean said. There was no point in beating around the bush anymore. It was just causing Gabriel more panic. Sam nodded and took another deep breath.
“Oh.” Dean said. “Well, I haven’t found anything either. Maybe…” Dean trailed off and glanced at Cas before continuing. “Maybe we should put this on the back burner for a while.” Sam lifted his head slowly and raised his eyebrows.
Or…well…maybe it was. It didn’t really matter. So what if Cas made him feel like he was in one of those cheesy chick-flicks Sam was always watching? It wasn’t anyone’s business but theirs. Dean shifted slightly, trying to alleviate some of the pain starting to shoot up his back.  He stood up and stretched, listening to the bones in his back crack from the movement. He’d been still too long. He sighed and glanced at his watch – it’d been four and a half hours with nothing. He was thinking about just going to find the others and calling it quits for today.
Castiel was forced out of his train of thought by a horn. The cars in front of him had moved up a fraction and the person behind Castiel obviously thought that the few scant inches would make or break their commute. Tempted as Castiel was to stay where he was, he took his foot off the brake and eased the car forward, hopefully satisfiying the person in the car behind him. He tried to get a look at them, but their windows were tinted so darkly Castiel couldn't see inside. Maybe he should report them for illegal window tints, he thought wryly, inching forward again as the traffic moved. At this rate, he'd never get to work on time.
“Eager.” he said, as he slipped one finger inside of Dean. Dean groaned and threw his head back, begging for more. Castiel bent over and started to kiss Dean thoroughly as he worked him open. Dean cried out and begged for more until Castiel was three fingers deep.
“I don’t like it.” Gabriel said. Sam blinked out of his thoughts and looked down at his toddler-sized boyfriend.
“Hmm.” Gabriel said, contentedly, reaching to find Sam’s shirt on the floor and wiping himself clean. He rolled over and did the same with Sam, even going as far as to take the condom off and toss it in the trashcan they had placed by the bed. With all of that done, Gabriel sighed and cuddled up to Sam.
“I’ve got you, Dean.” The angel said, and Dean felt a fourth finger work its way inside. Dean groaned and pushed against Cas’ fingers. Shit, if bottoming always felt this good why in the hell had they not tried this before?
The angel that had rebelled against heaven for him, the angel that would always show up when Dean needed him, the angel who had gripped him tight all those years ago and raised him from perdition.
“Because now I have something I care about, Dean. I have someone I care about other than you.” Sam said, surprising everyone in the room. Dean took a step back, almost falling over Cas. Even Gabriel looked mildly surprised. Sam whirled around and looked at Gabriel, then turned on his heel and exited the room, slamming the door so hard it bounced back open. Dean was able to see Sam stalk in the direction of his room before he finally succeeded in wrenching his elbow out of Cas’ grasp. Without a word, he followed Sam out, heading in the opposite direction. Gabriel let out a low whistle and Cas turned his head to look at him.
Gabriel hated being a toddler. He could feel himself wanting to overreact to everything exactly like a child. He was aware of his actions, though, so most of the time he could stop himself from acting like a brat.
…the little movements Cas kept making felt great, but Dean knew it wasn’t enough to finish him off. But he also didn’t want to lie just to get what he wanted – Cas didn’t deserve that. This left Dean at an impasse.
“Let’s see we have: bottles, pacifiers, formula, baby food, diapers, baby wipes, baby powder, and a teddy bear.” She said, digging through the items in the cart. “Well, boys, it seems the only thing you are missing is clothes. They are on isles one and two. I trust you will be able to find them okay.” She smiled and walked off. Dean immediately made for the isles, ready to be out of this place. Sam and Gabriel followed a few paces behind him.
“Yeah, the room got a little stuffy. I just stepped out for a minute.” Dean said. The elevator came and they climbed aboard. The woman was obviously interested, and if it hadn’t been for Cas, Dean would have probably gone for it. She got off first, winking at him, saying “Room 132” as she stepped off. Dean shook his head.
wasn’t going to be waking up anytime soon. This meant that they had one bed between the three of them. (Dean was all for throwing Andrew on the floor, but Sam
“You do that, and I’ll break your arm.” he stated, and then pulled the door open, hauling Cas out behind him. “See you in an hour!” he grinned.
Dean didn’t know how or when, but as they walked out of the hotel room that morning, Dean saw something that gave his mood a permanent up-turn.
“Say it for me, baby, come on. Tell me what you need.” Dean knew exactly what his boyfriend wanted, but he was determined to wait until Cas said it. He loved to hear his innocent little boyfriend ask. Call it a kink, but Cas asking for Dean to fuck him was one of the sexiest things Dean had ever experienced. Cas pushed back against him again.
“Umm, Dean?” Sam grabbed Dean’s shoulder and pointed towards the house the man had come from. The curtain was open and a woman in a bathrobe and curlers was on the phone, babbling and pointing at them. Dean cleared his throat.
“Are you sure? I don’t want to hurt you, Dean.” He said, pressing his fingers in again. Dean’s head hit the pillow again.
“Shower’s free.” He told Cas as he walked across the room to his bag. He could feel Cas’ eyes follow him as he crossed the room and he had to suppress a smile. He turned around and caught Cas’ eye. The angel’s eyes were black with lust, with the smallest ring of blue surrounding them. Cas bit his lip and nodded, moving towards the bathroom. When the door closed, Dean was just thinking that maybe he didn’t get clean enough in his shower and that he may need to go join Cas in his when he heard a knock on the door.
“Can you please stop doing that? Or at least…warn me or something?” She asked in a shaky voice. Her eyes were closed and her face was resting in her hands.
“God, Gabe, yes.” He mumbled. Gabriel couldn’t help but smile. He slipped his hand into Sam’s boxers and got his hand on him. He couldn’t see, but he knew Sam was already dripping with precome and he ran his thumb over the head, collecting the little beads and using them to ease the passing of his hand. He knew it would only take a moment until Sam took control of the situation.
“If you say so.” Cas said, kissing the hunter again. Dean responded for a moment but then pulled back.
“So, are we all going to go?” Gabriel asked as they were packing. Sam paused holding a pair of boxers.
“It’s because I’m the big brother, and I still think of Sam as a kid, I guess.” Cas pursed his lips but didn’t comment further. Dean drove into the center of the small town and followed the signs to the library.
“Come on, Dean.” Cas said, grinding harder for a moment and then backing off again. The angel brought his hand to grip his dick and looked at Dean as he started stroking himself. “You’re exquisite, and you do deserve this. Believe me. Tell me.” Cas groaned and quickened his hand.
They came down slowly, Castiel all but collapsing on top of Dean until the hunter managed to convince him that they need to clean up. The angel rolled off Dean in an uncharacteristically graceless move. Dean wiped his hand on one of their discarded shirts (probably Cas’) and then proceeded to remove them the rest of the way. That accomplished, he turned his attention to the angel, gently sliding his pants (and underwear) off and depositing them on the ground next to his own. He grabbed the shirt and made a quick job of cleaning both of them off.
First, he insisted on walking by himself. Then he wanted Sam to carry him. Then he wanted to ride in the cart. Sam didn’t know whether Gabriel was doing it on purpose or if being a toddler was actually affecting him.
Pushing those thoughts away, Castiel poured himself a cup of coffee, added sugar and just a splash of milk, and took a sip. He sighed quietly and sat down, opposite of the jacket to drink it. He could almost imagine that Dean was sitting across from him. He shook his head to rid himself of the image. Even if Dean had stayed the night, he'd have left as soon as they had woken up, leaving Castiel alone in the misery that was his apartment.
“Yeah, just…give me a sec.” he said, breathing though his nose. Castiel nodded and rested his head on Dean’s shoulder. Dean could feel the angel shaking with the effort of not moving. Finally, after what seemed like hours, the pain eased and Dean moved his hips slightly, making Castiel gasp. “You can move now, Cas.” Dean said, and the angel nodded, pulling out slightly and then pushing back in. Dean tilted his hips, encouraging Castiel to go in deeper.
“Alright, Sammy, let’s go and give these two some privacy.” Gabriel said before vanishing into thin air. Dean muttered darkly as they disappeared. Gabriel was getting on his nerves bad. Dean turned and went into the bathroom. He turned the water on in the bathtub and adjusted the water, making it lukewarm. The hunter waited until there was about two inches of water in the tub before turning it off. He quickly took the carrot-covered clothes off of the baby and sat him in the water.
"I saw you." She said. "Driving that old Continental that's parked outside." She glanced towards the door. "Dean's jacket, he forgot it in the backseat. He told me he left it at the office, but I knew better."
“No, they like how you perceive me to be. Your perception of me is vastly different from how I actually am.” Castiel said. “You see the best in people, Dean, and you always have. The version of me that you’ve built in your mind is the one that your family likes, they won’t actually like who I am…”
The angel pushed back against Dean, pushing them over until he was able to straddle him. Dean could see that Cas was already hard and leaking against his stomach and all he wanted to do was taste the angel.
Dean and Cas made their way hand in hand to Sam’s room, which was on the other side of the hotel (so nobody heard anyone else’s noises - Dean found out the hard way that hearing his brother get busy with his boyfriend killed the mood when he was trying to get busy with his. It didn’t seem to bother Cas, but Dean couldn’t get over it). Dean wasn’t huge on the whole ‘Public Display of Affection’ thing, but it Cas did, and so Dean sucked it up and held his hand. (He didn’t really mind - Cas was too attractive for his own good, and Dean liked people to know that the dark-haired, blue eyed man was most definitely off limits) Dean knocked three times in quick succession. (He had also learned that he should always knock – seeing his brother and Gabriel in some compromising positions had made him wary to enter any room without tapping on the door first) He heard a shuffling of feet and then the door was pulled open by a sleepy-looking Sam. He didn’t say anything, just stood aside to let them pass before shutting the door behind them. Dean shoved Sam gently
"Of course." Castiel went around to the passenger side of the Impala, climbing inside. Dean would never get over just how good Castiel looked in his passenger seat. Dean followed suit, starting up the car and driving away without a second thought.
“Take him and put him to sleep. When he wakes up, he’ll be back to normal. The side-effects should only last a few days.” Dean glanced up.
He isn’t disappointed. There were cigarette burns in the carpet and comforter was torn in three different places, and had been clumsily repaired. There were also hard water stains in the sink and toilet. When he pulls the comforter back on the bed, at least the white sheets are still white, and he determined –after a thorough search – that no stains were visible. Cas had watched him the entire time with a smirk on his face. He was used to Dean by now.
"God, why didn't you say something when I walked in?" gasped Dean. He can hardly remember what he did this morning, never mind a few hours ago.
"Ha ha, Dean, very funny," the taller brother scoffed even as he brought his big brother in for a hug. "I was really worried I was going to lose you again, Dean."
"Yes," Castiel murmured. He recalls that delicate soul that had been torn asunder because of its time spent in Hell. The soul that he loved with his entire being and watched slowly heal itself. The torture was a means to an end: it wasn't the
-one sick fuck!" the Hunter yelled through his fingers because he still couldn't look his lover in the eye.
"Aw come on, Dean. You know you've been dying to get out of here and I can take care of myself," pleaded Sam.
“Good,” Castiel says, in a casual tone that almost reminds Dean of his childhood tutors, when he would answer a question about math or history correctly. That strange moment of nostalgia is quickly driven away when one of Castiel’s fingers nudge his prostate, and Dean is all gasps and whines and pleading again, clawing at the ground under his hands.
, because Dean can feel like he’s in control for once. Like he’s strong. Like he doesn’t have to hold back his anger at Cas, at his Dad, his confusion about Lisa, his deeply-buried resentment towards...
Dean moves around the kitchen, taking pulled chicken, a few carrots, and an onion out of the fridge, then grabbing a couple carving boards from a cupboard and shoving one into Castiel’s hands. “If you’re gonna hang out in here, you’re gonna help. That’s the rule.”
“Hey,” he says, ignoring the way her hand cards through his hair, her thumb brushing his chin. “Hey. Lis. Cas.” He grins shakily, dropping the phone, but Lisa immediately grabs it and presses it to her ear.
“Dean is staying here,” Charlie points out, her tone indicating that this is a well-worn conversation. Castiel lifts his head, squinting at them.
It’s a miracle, really, that Dean could hold on long enough for her to make it, and he loses himself as soon as she’s done. It feels different, somehow. Maybe because of the way Lisa keeps whispering about how much she loves him, with her hands roaming in his hair.
Dean opens his mouth to argue with her, but he’s interrupted by scuffling noises on the other side of the fence. Ruby stands up and stumbles over to join the rest of the group, giving Castiel a smile when she bumps into his shoulder. He quickly puts an arm around her waist, to keep her from falling over. Both Bela and Lilith are glaring in his direction, but he ignores them - Ruby is just drunk. If they were better friends, they’d be helping her instead of enviously cursing her in their heads.
Dean raises an eyebrow. “Are you fucking serious?” He asks, deadpan. Castiel meets his gaze, but doesn’t respond, and Dean lets out a breathy little laugh. “Really?” He says, rubbing a hand over his mouth. “Seriously?” Castiel tilts his head, confused, which just makes Dean laugh again. “Okay, dude, no homo, but you’re hot. Okay?”
“Really?” asks Charlie, at the same time Jo chimes in, “I thought for sure you’d be a Duck or a Beaver.”
He has to be strong. Their situation isn’t quite as simple as saying yes and being in a relationship. Castiel could do that, and he absolutely wants to, but it wouldn’t be right. He’s still as scared of Dean as he is enamored with him, and he wants to be sure, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they’re both ready for all the baggage this relationship would carry with it.
Dean is out cold, snoring softly, unmoving as Castiel tries to stretch the pain out of his muscles. He wishes he could sleep like that. His eyelids are still heavy, and he rubs at them again, groaning softly. A glass of water sounds amazing, or maybe some hot tea if he can get away with it. Forlornly, he realizes that he should probably climb into the pull-out bed before Mary gets home, since one of her rules was that at least one of them should be upstairs during the night. He can make some tea, and hopefully it’ll help with his pain so he can go back to sleep.
They smile at each other for a moment, and Dean lets himself enjoy the feeling of weightlessness and joy that comes with forgiveness and a fresh start. Cas is the best person Dean knows, too kind for his own good, and even though Dean doesn’t feel like he deserves this, that’s not quite as overwhelming as it was last year. In fact, Dean finds he wants to deserve it, and really believes he can make everything up to Cas. And that’s a nice feeling too.
“Just trust me, Dean,” Cas says. His voice is pitched low, with just a hint of amusement. As if he knows something Dean doesn’t, and that just makes Dean bristle and distrust this plan all the more.
Gilda raises her eyebrows, smiling brightly, but Jo throws her hands up and scoots over to sit next to Dean. “I don’t get it,” she sighs, leaning against Dean’s shoulder. “This is out of my league.”
Castiel blinks at her, then surprises himself by leaning forward and resting his chin in his hands. “I’ve been told I’m a very good listener.”
Castiel reaches for Dean’s hand as the town disappears in the rearview mirror, and kisses his fingers.
.” She makes another, gutteral noise of disgust, making Jo and Lisa laugh, before handing the book over to Dean. “At least that kiss turned out okay.”
“All right,” Naomi says. “I’ll see you at six. Bring something you like for dinner, and we’ll eat it here.”
Dean winces and turns to Cas with a pleading look. Cas sighs, pulls Gabe close to whisper something in his ear, then grabs Dean by the elbow and starts pulling him out of the crowd. Dean stammers into the phone as they push through the consuming mass of teenagers, until things start to clear up and Dean can breathe again, feel cool air on his skin.
Castiel tightens his jaw, resolutely staring out at the ocean. Cars zoom past and gulls cry overhead, breaking the quiet. “He’s my friend,” he says finally, putting another bite of ice cream in his mouth. Chuck turns to him, but Castiel refuses to look back. Instead, he stares into his half-empty bowl, taking deep breaths.
Mary watches in fascination, but doesn’t comment as she takes the phone and walks to the other side of the room. Whatever she has to say to Naomi, Castiel won’t be privy to it.
. I’m…” He pauses, flustered, before coming up with, “I need to look at all the little threads and figure out what they do and how they’re important before putting the big picture back together again.”
“Eh, we got time. I’ve got another idea.” Dean pulls away, grinning crookedly as he gets to his feet and waits for Cas to do the same. “Roadhouse is probably a bad idea anyway.”
“Yeah, nah, that’s not happening,” Dean says, leaning down and pulling one of Castiel’s arms around his shoulders. “You shouldn’t have brought him here in the first place, I’m sure as hell not letting you pull your shit on him.”
“Great. Awesome. You, uh,” Dean swallows and manages a grin. “You’re actually here. I wasn’t sure-... I mean, I hoped, but, y’know, you’ve been hard to get a hold of lately.”
It's only now, with the lull in conversation  that Castiel realizes there's still music playing; he had heard it when Gabriel dropped him off, but now he's close enough to actually listen to it, to realize...
Cas isn’t the type of person to play games and force others through tests, so this probably isn’t something he’s done on purpose. But Dean could never live with himself if he left this building without trying one more time. It’s scary to think about, facing Cas one more time and trying to get him to understand something that Dean doesn’t even entirely understand himself.
“Stop doing that to me, that honesty thing,” Dean says, running a hand through his hair. “Gotta give a guy a warning before you drop a chick-flick moment on him.”
Victor laughs, shoving Dean until he bumps into Bela, who shoves him back towards Victor. Dean scowls and shoves both of them, setting Victor off balance so he falls, laughing, into the sand.
Castiel hesitates before closing the book, settling it in his lap as he leans closer to Dean. “My father writes novels for a living, Dean.”
When they’re both naked, they just sit and stare at one another for a while, taking it all in. Eventually, Lisa gets the giggles, and the ice is broken, and the next thing Dean knows, they’re kissing and touching, and sure it’s in the bed of his old, rusty truck, and anyone could come by at any moment and catch them, but none of that matters. Lisa is warm and soft and she smells like flowers and he could spend hours just touching her hair, but curfew is at midnight, so he forces himself to quit after just a few minutes.
The levy breaks. To Castiel’s utter horror, tears spill out over his eyelashes and onto his face, and his short, sipping breaths start to sound like wheezing sobs. Dean blinks in surprise, eyebrows climbing up his forehead, but he wipes the tears from Castiel’s face before pulling him into a warm embrace, and Castiel clings to him. He’s solid and safe and Castiel is tired and weak, so he stops fighting. He holds tight to Dean but lets go of his walls and allows himself this vulnerable moment. He’s crying in a way he hasn’t in years, since Lucifer abandoned the family, and he lets himself. He can’t speak, can’t explain why something he insisted on this morning now has him so upset, but Dean holds him up anyway.
Dean leans over and takes another deep breath. He’s days away from turning twenty, and he’s planning his mother’s funeral. A part of him knows that, if he asked for help, he’d get plenty of it. But then he’d have too much time on his hands, and frankly, he’d rather keep himself occupied than have to face reality.
Castiel sighs and rolls his eyes. “I went into rut a few days after you left, and my scent never went down. It’s so heavy
Still. When Dean knocks on his window that night, tells him, “I’m Dean Winchester and I’m here to rescue you,” before displaying DVDs of the original Star Wars trilogy, Castiel still smiles and lets him in.
You should know, being in Dean's head did a number on mine, especially at the beginning, and so writing this part was very very difficult. I questioned a lot of my decisions along the way, and I don't think I've been so critical of my own work since I started writing again, three years ago. So if you enjoyed this installment, please let me know. Comments and messages mean the world to me, and you guys and your interest in this beast of a fic are what help me move past what's going on in my head and keep working. I sincerely appreciate every single one of you and would love to hear from you :) Thank you for being a part of this journey. We're almost halfway there!!
It’s late, now. His family must be in bed, but Castiel is still reading, drowning himself in magic and owls and characters that will never leave him, that will always be there, on these pages. His phone buzzes next to him, drawing him out, and he blinks, confused, before picking it up.
“Dean, you’ve had a lot of people worried about you lately.” Mary reaches over, resting her hand on Dean’s shoulder. The point of contact is grounding, keeping Dean from drifting away, so he turns to look at her. “Did you know that Jo dropped by and asked for you? And Charlie?”
And now Sam was passed out in a crappy motel bed, and the air conditioner was loud as hell, and all Dean wanted was some ice to get his beer down from “sweltering” to “potentially drinkable”, but the
Dean actually kinda lost track of time down on the floor, watching Cas watch him, but then he remembered something he’d thought of the other night, when he’d been - okay, he’d been watching porn, but he’d actually been thinking about Cas, and things Cas might like, and he’d been thinking about one of those dumb porn things that he was pretty sure people didn’t actually
Castiel, who has thought of little else in the intervening weeks, asks, “What happened last month, Dean?”
“I mean we treat each other like shit,” Dean says.  “And then most of the time you leave.  And then you come back, and I know it's because I tell you I need you, and it's like, when it’s the job, heaven and hell and all that, yeah, I'm gonna keep asking, but with - with two people, with
“You think it’s easy to set up an op like this under Crowley’s nose?” the demon hisses, clearly straining with effort.  “It’s not.  I’m not as stupid as you think I am.  You’re not taking me down that fucking easy - ”
When he arrives at the bunker, Sam is in the library, a stack of books next to his computer.  “Hey, Cas,” he says.  “How’s it going?”
Dean woke up hours later, disoriented and naked, and found the bed next to him cold.  He stumbled down the hallway in a pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt from the floor and found Sam, eating a piece of bread with peanut butter, and Cas, sitting with his hands around a cup of coffee he wasn’t drinking.
“Well, now that I can’t, it’s very convenient,” Cas said primly.  He opened another box.  “Ah ha!  The chip clips!”
And then Cas tapped two fingers to Dean’s forehead and Dean felt a ribbon of heat run straight through him, straight - oh.  Straight to his dick.
The floaty feeling eased, but it left a kind of echo warmth in its place.  Cas pulled out but not away, slid to Dean’s side and ran a hand up and down Dean’s chest kinda soothingly, pressed soft kisses to the corner of Dean’s mouth.
The silence hangs.  Castiel thinks that, perhaps, things between them can go back to normal, or as normal as they ever are.
There are only a few minutes left in the drive when Dean clears his throat.  “Look, Sam wants us to talk?  Let’s talk.  I don’t know why Sammy has to insert himself into everything, but - ”
“Yeah, he likes cartoons and liquor and whatever,” Dean said.  “This is boring stuff.  Just, like, the crap it takes to be a human.  Shit he doesn’t have to do since he’s not one.”
Dean throws his hands up and looks around at the other men and women filling the barstools.  “Anybody willing to cover me one round?  Maybe two, but I swear, honest to god, I’m good for it. Left my wallet at home is all, I can go get it, even - ”
“My dad won’t step up, and it’s not fair for my mom to bear all this burden.” Dean says as Castiel admires a sketch of Charlie with elfin ears (or possibly Vulcan; he can’t tell the difference yet). Half of him is saddened by Dean’s resolve to play a role that’s not his; the other half is absolutely taken by Dean’s sketches. A child, probably Sam, kicking a ball around. Batman, Ironman, Luke Skywalker… Castiel stops short when he turns to the next page, gasping softly, only to have the notebook torn out of his hands. He glances up to see Dean glaring at him, clutching the notebook to his chest.
And when Dean drops Castiel off at the hotel, happy with just a lingering good night kiss, Castiel knows that no matter what happens in the future, at least they will have this memory to smile about.
So Dean dials Lisa’s number. She answers after one ring and sounds a little breathless when she says, “Hello?”
“You should go,” Dean says gruffly, stepping back and rubbing a hand over his face. “This doesn’t really concern you, and Bela shouldn’t have brought you anyway.”
Now that he has an actual day to look forward to, it feels like Cas is all he thinks about. He reminds himself of what Missouri warned him about and Anna helped him understand: that he can’t be selfish about this, can’t apologize just for the sake of relieving his own pain. But he still finds himself daydreaming about finally seeing Cas’s smile again, the way his hair moves in the wind, his gentle hands flipping through the pages of a book.
The words are in his head, beating around in his brain, but he can’t say them. He’s been told, again and again, that he’s wrong and he overreacted, and yes, Sam and Jess agreed with him, but they’re
“Charlie?” Dean grunts, tilting his head. There’s a red plastic cup in his hand, and his shirt is wet with what smells like vodka. “What’re you doin’ here?”
, and Dean quickly shoves it back where it came from, the same place where he keeps his memories of kissing Cas. Now’s not the time.
Nice like the warmth coming from Cas’s body, as he stands closer to Dean than is really necessary. Like the bubbly feeling playing around in Dean’s stomach, and the desire to touch Cas’s skin. Dean moves to loosely wrap his hand around Cas’s forearm, pulling him a little closer, and while Cas blinks, he doesn’t refuse. In fact, his smile grows a little, and Dean thinks they’re caught in a feedback loop of each other’s buzzing joy, just from being in the same space and on the same page again.
“Cas!” All the humor, sarcastic or not, is gone from Dean’s eyes. He’s almost pleading when he says, “I just wanted to see you. I was worried.”
Dean bites his lower lip, studying the cards carefully. The one closest to him features a blindfolded girl surrounded by swords. The one in the middle, that Gilda had noted, looks like a man surveying a crop of golden coins. The furthest card, Dean has to reach for, to study closer, turning it around in his fingers before he says, “This guy is upside-down.”
“Still,” Dean argues, tightening a clamp, locking the hose into place. “I was sentenced in February, I thought I’d be done way before school got out.”
That decided, Castiel starts carefully extracting himself from Dean’s grip. Dean whines once, as Castiel’s warmth finally slips away, but before Castiel can start to feel bad about it, Dean wraps himself up in the blankets and rolls over. Castiel smiles fondly, and goes to find something to wear. Again, he’s grateful that he brought his entire suitcase: it has leggings, gloves, socks, and his athletic shorts and hoodie, the latter two both in Northwestern purple. He realizes as he’s getting dressed that they hadn’t really washed up after the fun they had last night, but it only causes a momentary pause. He usually runs before showering anyway, so what’s the difference? It’s not as if anyone will be able to tell.
It’s awkward. Castiel eats a few spoonfuls of soup, barely tasting it, staring down into the bowl. On his left, Dean is a warm, sweet-smelling presence. On his right, John is tense and still emitting a threatening smell. The entire table is silent except for the clink of silver on porcelain, and the further the quiet stretches, the more awkward Castiel feels.
They’re quiet again, for a moment, as they start to climb the staircase. Castiel’s thighs are already starting to ache; he’s not sure he’ll be able to stand going up and down this tower all the time, and he wonders if the royal family have such difficulty getting to their own rooms.
However much of a relief it was to hear Cas’s voice, it’s even more of one to actually see Cas’s face. A quiet, distant part of Dean notes this as strange, starts to wonder if it shouldn’t be Lisa who brings this kind of comfort, but Dean quickly wraps himself up in the warmth and peace that comes with blue eyes and gentle hands, and the worry disappears. Instead, Dean smiles weakly and ruffles Cas’s hair when he gets close enough to touch.
“Don’t. Touch. Me,” Lucifer says with a scowl, ducking out of Gabriel’s embrace. “Michael’s not going to be happy when he comes home and sees this-”
They can see the light glowing from the dining hall when the Queen catches up with them. She’s a vision in blue silk, with blonde curls hiding her ears. Dean finds himself relaxing as soon as he catches her clean beta scent, peppermint and cream, and she smiles up at him, glancing back at Castiel, who merely regards her with curiosity. She’s wearing a hood instead of her tiara, so Dean gestures between them. “Cas, this is my mom, Mary. Mom, this is Cas.”
All the joy in Dean’s face immediately falls, but Jo lifts her head up, beaming. “What about the birthday girl?”
This book isn't even out for another month, if Dean remembers correctly. The big finale to the Apocalypse storyline is in here, and Dean's hands itch when he realizes he'll get to read it before Charlie and Becky. There's probably an unspoken rule about him not sharing spoilers, if this is an early copy, but Dean still likes the idea of teasing them about what he knows.
“Why? Should I?” And Castiel finally looks up at the slight tremble in Dean’s voice. Dean gives up a brief, counterfeit smile, and runs a hand over his face. “That bad?”
Before Castiel can attempt to answer, Benny pipes up, “If you were under arrest, we wouldn’t be standing here chatting, buddy. But I can still change my mind.”
Castiel’s fidgets with the sleeves of his shirt, half-hoping Dean will reach over and take his hand again, but also hoping he won’t, if only because this thing, these feelings they’re playing with, well, the longer they drag things out, the more they will hurt when it eventually ends. And Castiel going away to school might be an ending.
There’s a cliche about something making your heart melt, and Dean thinks he understands what it means when Cas fixes him with a grateful smile. Dean’s insides go all warm and he can’t help smiling back, until he realizes they’re standing in the middle of the lobby grinning at each other like idiots. That’s when Dean gently pushes Cas off towards the return desk, mentally shakes himself, and heads off for the Sbarro’s by the entrance.
Dean sighs, staring at his hands under the water. He’s pretty sure his heat is out of his system, and it probably wouldn’t be very difficult for him to convince Castiel to go ahead and knot him now, but if Castiel didn’t bite before, then he won’t bite now. Even if Dean asked to be bit and mated, Castiel would still be the voice of reason.
it, Dean,” he groans, because this is what got him into trouble last year. This, right here. It’s what made everything so bad back in 2006, and it’s why he fell so hard when they first met.
Dean forces himself not to look at Lisa, to keep his eyes on Cas. “Then I need to talk to you about something. In private.”
Dean huffs, reaching into one of the cabinets overhead, pulling out chicken broth and a bag of noodles. “My mom works three jobs. She splits her time between the Roadhouse, Fulio’s, and and the Seaside Cafe.”
“- we shouldn’t have to put up with more Dean and Cas bullshit on top of it,” Jo barrels on, ignoring the way Pam rolls her eyes. “I mean, you weren’t there last night, Cas. You didn’t see. We kept telling him you weren’t responding to our texts about the movie, but for some reason he got all hopeful about you showing up anyway. And then you didn’t.”
There's another explosion, in Dean's chest this time, and he barks out, "What the hell do you want?" which effectively wipes the smile right off of Cas's face.
It takes a moment for Charlie to hum sympathetically and say, “Well. Yeah. I know a little bit about crushing on straight people, but look how that worked out for me.”
Research was dull. Most of the missing people had lead boring, simple lives and went to work every day and came home to dinner and talked to their kids about school. Dean was finding it incredibly difficult to not just stare at Cas the entire time. The angel looked so adorable when he was concentrating as hard as he was. At least until he found the one outstanding exception in the victim list.
lord, I can handle it. Fuck me!” Cas cried out. Dean nodded and withdrew his fingers, spitting in his palm and lubing up his dick before pressing forward into Cas.
“Take me to bed, Daddy. Fuck me so hard I can’t walk tomorrow.”  Dean cursed, and tightened his hands on Cas’ hips and pushed his boyfriend back against the sink. He moved his hands down to the back of Castiel’s thighs picked him up. The other man wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist eagerly, simultaneously putting his arms around Dean’s neck. Dean moved his hands again, this time to his boyfriend’s ass as he picked him up. Dean had to strain a little-he wasn’t as young as he used to be and Cas wasn’t exactly light
“I saw you trying to push her away.” The angel clarified. “But…it does worry me, sometimes.” Dean turned towards him.
“Dean-o…you did research? Oh, be still my heart!” He said, and proceeded to fall to the floor, causing everyone in the room (even Cas) to roll their eyes at him.
“No.” Dean said, walking away from Andrew. Sam rolled his eyes at his brother. He looked at Gabriel, who nodded and was gone, only to be back 30 seconds later, with clothes in hand. Andrew watched all of this with a fascinated horror.
Castiel smiled and leaned down, his face ghosting over Dean’s lips. “No.” he said. Despite the proximity of his angel, Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
None of the rest of the guys were anything spectacular, really. The one who called himself Aaron was cute, but Dean found himself anxiously anticipating whatever Jimmy was going to do to him. (He also wondered what was with all these strippers having such
“Hey, baby.” he said, as he gestured for his boyfriend to scoot to one side of the bath so he could get in. Cas complied and Dean climbed into the tub and sat across from his boyfriend. He leaned forward and captured Castiel’s lips in a long, sweet kiss. Cas hummed and put his arms around Dean’s neck to keep him there. Dean couldn’t help but smile. His boyfriend pulled away after a minute.
Dean was faced a dilemma. He didn’t want a lap dance with any of the girls, but he was still on the edge about guys. Sure, he’d fooled around with a few in school, but he’d never really…well, come out about it. But maybe this was what he needed to get over Bela. Not a girl, but a hard-framed, muscled dude. Yes. The more he thought about it, the more his alcohol induced brain decided that doing just that would be a fantastic idea. So, he stayed where he was, watching as most of the other men left and then went to the bar. After about ten minutes, Gabriel came back onto the stage.
“Because Cassie isn’t going to let you. Trust me. I was the one he clung to when he was an actual baby.” Gabriel said, smiling a little. Dean grumbled, and started to put Cas into clean clothes, as the little suit and trench coat he was wearing didn’t look entirely comfortable.
“Exquisite.” he murmured. Dean felt Castiel grab the hem of his t-shirt and hike it up, exposing his stomach. Dean squirmed and tried to pull it back down. He was more than a little self-conscious about the softness around his belly that he couldn’t seem to get rid of. Castiel gripped his hand and pulled it away from his shirt.
“Forgive me if I’m wrong but…aren’t we supposed to go inside now?” Cas asked after a minute, causing everyone but Andrew to laugh. Dean clapped him on the shoulder.
“Let me finish, please. When Lisa told me what happened I freaked out. You weren’t answering my calls and I…I just had this feeling that something awful was going to happen. I couldn’t…I couldn’t stand the thought of losing you, Cas.” Castiel narrowed his eyes, scarcely believing what he was hearing.
“Are you alright?” he murmured, leaning down to brush his lips across Dean’s head. The hunter nodded.
Dean’s hands came up to cup Cas’ face, angling it up so he could kiss him deeper. Cas complied, opening his mouth the moment he felt Dean’s tongue run along his bottom lip. Dean kissed the angel eagerly, pushing him back until his back hit the wall. Cas grabbed Dean’s waist and pulled them flush against each other, not even a breath between their bodies. Dean moved his mouth from Cas’ and began to leave wet, open-mouthed kisses in a trail along the angel’s jaw, working is way down to Cas’ neck. Cas sighed and tilted his head up to give Dean better access, his hands finding their way under the hunter’s shirt and onto the smooth skin of his back. Dean groaned at the contact and his own hands started to roam all over the angel. When Cas felt Dean’s hands insistently pushing against his coat and jacket, Cas complied, pushing away from the wall and allowing his coat and jacket to pool at their feet. Cas gripped the hem of Dean’s shirt and tugged it off, tossing it to the side. The angel’s hands immediately found his own shirt and started undoing buttons with clumsy fingers. Apparently, it wasn’t fast enough for Dean. He grabbed the collar of Cas’ shirt in both of his hands and pulled, popping buttons everywhere in his desperation to get to the angel’s chest. Cas couldn’t say he minded – he could easily fix the shirt when they were finished, not to mention that Dean’s hands and mouth were moving over his newly exposed chest and that made it difficult to think of anything but
He thought. The elevator dinged, announcing his arrival on his floor. He steeled himself and then stepped out of the elevator, ready to face whatever was waiting for him inside the room.
Dean nodded. “And we have two days to figure out a plan.” Dean looked around the room and then back at Andrew. “Do you have any idea why she gave us until Friday?”
"Maybe not." Castiel said, bending down. "But there's plenty of time for me to fuck your mouth." Dean groaned at the thought, wanting nothing more than that right now. He pushed at Castiel, trying to get him off so he could get to his dick. Castiel chuckled, sliding off Dean's lap and into the seat beside him. (Dean absently remembered the food as Castiel pushed it off the seat but there are much better things right in front of him that he was able put his mouth on right now)
“Yeah, Dean isn’t one to just admit that he’s stressed out of his mind.” Gabriel nudged Cas. “He tends to take it out on us rather than to talk about it. ‘I’m fine, Cas!’” Gabriel said in a surprisingly good impression of Dean’s tone.  Cas smiled a little as he nudged Gabriel with his shoulder. Gabriel grins and then sighs.
"I just woke back up." Castiel lied. He'd been awake since Dean had walked out the door. "And I couldn't fall back to sleep."
“Hey.” Gabriel complained, making Sam stop. “I’m not going to be the only shirtless one. This is an equal opportunity relationship. Off with it, Gigantor.” Sam rolled his eyes but complied, shrugging his shirt off and throwing it in Gabriel’s face. The archangel grabbed it threw it on the floor.
Castiel knew he was worthless. He felt it every day, almost all the time. His feet carried him to the bathroom, and he opened the medicine cabinet like a robot. He was too chicken shit to shoot himself, and he didn’t know where he would get a gun anyway. And cutting himself would be too messy. He didn’t want to leave that mess for someone else to have to clean up. The painkillers he had left over from last year when he’d stretched a ligament in his knee while running would do the trick. He could take the rest and just…go to sleep. Never wake up.
“Please, Cas. Open the door.” Dean took a deep breath and closed his eyes, fighting back tears. He was such an idiot. He had managed to get the one person that was always on his side mad at him. He couldn’t even blame Cas for being angry at him. He deserved it. Dean squeezed his eyes shut tighter and balled up his fists. Why did he have to be such a fuck up? Why couldn’t he get one thing right?
about Cas. The angel is always on his mind. Castiel starts to rub him through his boxers and Dean can’t help the breathy moan that falls from his lips. “Answer me, Winchester.” The angel commanded in a low voice. Dean whined a little when Cas stops his ministrations.
Dean was awoken rather suddenly the next morning by someone banging on the door. Dean groaned and rolled back, burying his head into the pillow.
“You better have a good reason for knocking on my door at 8:00 in the morning.” He grumbled at Dean.
So why is there a sick burning in his stomach, twisting and churning until he was sure he was going to be sick?
Dean knew he should probably go ahead and wake Sam up and apologize to him and Andrew, but the pounding in his head and the little frown on Castiel’s face when he had woken up alone made him want to just crawl back into the bed and sleep. Castiel groaned and collapsed back onto the bed, wrapping an arm around a pillow and burrowing his face into it. That made up Dean’s mind.
“Sometimes, you two are so disgustingly in love it makes me want to puke. I mean, even when he’s doing nothing but complaining to you…you just sit there and smile and hug him and it’s so
“It was my mothers. My family is originally from England.” She gestured for them to sit down, more telling than asking, but that seemed to be her usual way. Dean sat in a chair as far away from the couch as possible, so she couldn’t sit by him or more importantly, Cas. Sam and Gabriel sat on the couch and Casmiria sat in the chair on the other side of it. She poured the tea into the teacups and passed them around. They all accepted, but nobody took a drink. She didn’t seem surprised.
“Good work, Sammy.” He said. Cas was showing his excitement by wiggling and making cooing noises. Dean almost dropped him.
“That is my boyfriend you are trying to sleep with.” he said bluntly. Natalie looked between them, her mouth open and gaping, and then she sighed.
All of this might not have happened if he and Lisa hadn't gotten married so young. Before Dean had figured out what he truly was and what he truly wanted. And it wasn't Lisa. He loved her, sure, but it wasn't in the way he should. Not in the way his daddy had tried to beat into him when he found that copy of
“Hannah said you woke up. How are you feeling?” Castiel looked around the room and the was surprised that the woman was nowhere to be found.
It was also nothing like the altar they had seen at Casmiria’s house. That one had been white marble. He cursed to himself. Witches were creatures of habit; they used the same ingredients, the same spells, all of it. So either Casmiria had drastically changed or it wasn’t her. God dammit.
“Good morning.” he said, stretching up to kiss him. Castiel didn’t miss Dean wincing at this action.
“I know that.” Castiel said. “But I am…worried. I don’t want him to get hurt. I feel…I feel as though I am the big brother in this situation, and that I need to care for him.” Castiel turned towards Dean. “Does that make sense?”
“Cas.” he knelt down and put his hand on the angel’s chest. He couldn’t detect any breathing. “No, no, c’mon, Cas, no you can’t have…no.” He put his fingers to the angel’s pulse point and could feel a faint heartbeat, but he still wasn’t breathing. “Cas, come on buddy, you have to breathe. Come on, Cas.” The heartbeat was getting fainter and Dean could tell. Gabriel and Andrew had gotten Sam up and they were all standing there watching. Dean was oblivious to them. Dean put his head on the angel’s chest. “Don’t die, Cas, please. I can’t do this without you. Please, Cas, I love you.” Silence. Gabriel and Sam exchanged a look. Dean was almost sobbing, clutching at the angel’s trench coat. Dean felt Cas’ chest rise suddenly.
Roughly ten minutes later, the three of them were standing on a busy street in Wisconsin. Dean looked a Gabriel.
“Probably 10-15 minutes, depending on how long it takes to cast the circle.” Dean was pacing back and forth, thinking hard about it. He turned towards Andrew.
“That’s why I came here.  I hoped you two would know.” Dean pursed his lips, thinking. Sam spoke up.
“Come on, let’s go see if we can’t find a library or something. I don’t want to think about what’s going on in there.” Dean started to make his way towards the Impala, trying very hard not to think about what Sam and Gabriel were doing behind closed doors.
“Me? Don’t blame me. I had to beat him off with a stick.” he grinned sweetly at Sam and popped a piece of what looked like butterscotch in his mouth. Sam rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything.
“Don’t – don’t you think we should let him sleep? You know, while he still can?” he asked, his fear evident on his face. It was clear he wasn’t ready to have Gabriel be awake yet.
“No. There is no way in hell that I am changing a dirty diaper.” Dean said indignantly, but less than two minutes later, Dean had Cas down and was attempting to clean him up. Cas hadn’t meant to do it-it had just happened. And he definitely did
"Okay. I apologize." Castiel said immediately, not wanting to upset Dean. His heart ached at the thought.
“I know you do, Dean.” Cas said, his eyes alight with fire. “I know you do.” And then Cas threw his head back and moaned, clenching as he came all over his hand. The sudden tightening of Cas around him was too much for his oversensitive cock. He came hard, filling Cas up and crying out wordlessly. Cas didn’t stop, rocking until Dean had fully ridden out his orgasm. With a wince, Cas slid off of Dean and stretched out beside him. With a sleepy mumble, Cas waved his hand and they were clean. For the third time tonight, Dean felt a surge of appreciation for angel mojo. He was too blissed out to want to move as Cas curled around him.
“Hello, Dean.” the angel looked somewhat nervous, as if he wasn’t sure how he would be received.  “May I come in?” Dean nodded and stepped back, still in a little bit of a daze. He couldn’t believe that Castiel was actually here.  The angel stepped into the room and Dean shut the door. He turned towards Dean.
His face wasn’t disappointing either. Strong, stubble-covered jaw, leading to slightly chapped, plush lips. Angular cheekbones, and the bluest eyes he’d ever seen.
Dean led the way into the house. He probably should have let one of the other two go first, considering he had Cas, but he didn’t think. Luckily, the witch (Casmiria?) had disappeared for the time being, leaving Dean, Sam, Gabriel, and Cas with ample time to take in their surroundings.It was actually charming on the inside. The entryway fell straight into a living room, which was clearly open to the kitchen. The walls were painted an off-white color and the floor was nothing but darkly stained hardwood. There was a cheerful looking fireplace in the living room and what (to the untrained eye) looked like a marble coffee table. Dean knew, however that this ‘coffee table’ was in fact an altar. It was one of the more elaborate he had seen, white marble, candles, the works, but nonetheless it was what it was. Casmiria returned carrying a tray with a teapot, cups, and tiny sandwiches on it. She immediately noticed their interest in her most interesting piece of furniture.
Once the plan had been hammered out, the four men went back and crowded around Andrew. Dean glared at the man.
He found it. Behind the couch, out of initial sight, was a black stone altar. It was draped in purple silk and was covered in black candles. It practically screamed ‘evil’.
“The only thing we’re gonna need your help with is that damn tree tomorrow. That’s why I keep you young’uns around so my old bones don’t have to do that anymore.” He clapped him on the shoulder and then sat back down. Now that the introductions were over, Dean walked up to Castiel. “Come on, I’ll show you my room.” He said, nudging Castiel towards the stairs. “We’ve been on the road for a while, we’ll probably just go to bed. Goodnight, everyone.” There was a chorus of ‘goodnights!’ thrown back at the two of them as they climbed the stairs.
“I’m already yours, Dean.” Cas whimpered, spreading his legs. Dean grinned and breached his hole, causing the angel to arch his back and cry out. Dean slowly worked his finger in and out, enjoying every gasp he got from Cas. When Dean pushed a second finger in, Cas almost screamed. Dean put his free hand over the angel’s mouth.
“You said you loved me.” Castiel murmurs sometime later. He knows that Dean isn’t asleep, the rise and fall of his chest is too irregular for the hunter to have nodded off. It takes a few seconds, but eventually he feels Dean’s hand under his chin, coaxing the angel to look up at him. Castiel meets his eyes, searching for some evidence of the truth in them.
“Let’s keep at it for a couple more hours. If they don’t show we can always come back.” Dean said. Cas nodded and turned around, putting his back to Dean’s chest. Dean smiled to himself and ran his hands down Cas’ arms, twining their fingers together on the angel’s stomach. Cas let his head fall back onto Dean’s shoulder and sighed contentedly.
“Oh, Dean.” he moaned into the hunter’s ear. Dean groaned and started to work his hand faster, using the other to push the slacks the rest of the way down. Castiel lifted his legs and let them slide off onto the floor. Dean adjusted his hand position and started to work Cas in earnest, riding the wave of moans that Cas was pouring into his ear. Suddenly, Cas put his hand on Dean’s and pulled him away.
“You should really stop talking.” Dean murmured, pressing kissing against the angels neck. Castiel gasped and his breathing started to become erratic.
Dean couldn’t help it. He laughed. Gabriel joined him after a moment, letting go of Sam so that he could get up. Sam sat up, muttering darkly to himself and rubbing his back. Amanda jumped to her feet, apologizing profusely, and tried to help Sam up. Sam, knowing she couldn’t help him, waved her off and got to his feet, wincing slightly.
“No, nothing at all.” Gabriel said, rolling his eyes in Sam’s direction and then going to cut on the television. Dean caught Sam’s eye and raised an eyebrow. Sammy shook his head and went to stretch out on the other bed. Dean kept eating but his mind was racing, wondering what in the hell could be going on between his brother and Gabriel. Eventually he decided to forget it. Sam was a big boy. He could handle whatever it was.
“More than okay.” he said, throwing an arm around the angel and tangling their legs together. Castiel smiled and returned his embrace, pressing a soft kiss to his lips.
"Oh!" Dean cried, his hands tightening to the point it almost hurt. But that was good. Castiel never minded hurting just a little bit. He and Dean had that in common. Maybe that was why they worked so well together.
With everyone else gone, it had just been him and Cas. Who was absolutely fine despite having his grace turned on him (again) by that witch. Dean was so relieved that he had just wanted to take Castiel to the hotel and show him just how much he appreciated him not dying. Cas had insisted on everyone going out to celebrate, however, and so Dean had agreed. They had all night, after all.
Dean hated seeing Sam like this. It lit up all his ‘big-brother’ sensors and all he wanted to do was fix it. There wasn’t anything he could do, though. They would have to get Casmiria to reverse the spell again before they killed her or else Gabriel could be stuck as a toddler forever. (Unless he grew up. Would he grow up? Hmm, good question.)
“Casmiria…she got to you.” Gabriel jerked back so fast he almost pulled his face out of Sam’s hands. “Don’t worry! You’re okay, I promise.” At this, Gabriel relaxed slightly but fear and confusion was still on his face.
“What, has your angel been starving you?” Dean asked, as Sam tore into the Chinese food. He rolled his eyes and flipped Dean off, unable to talk past the forkfuls of chicken fried rice he was shoveling into his mouth.
took that option away from me. So I’m going with the next best option.” He rolled his eyes and looked out the window. Dean walked towards the door and gestured for the other three to follow him. Castiel got up from the bed and followed them all to the door, still looking a little crestfallen.
“Why aren’t they gone? Shouldn’t they have healed by now?” Dean asked, tearing his eyes away from the mirror to look at Castiel.
“Don’t you think we should make the most of what time we have?” Castiel asked, and it threw Dean for a moment. Then he realized what Cas was trying to do, and busted out laughing.
"Are you hungry?" He asked. The food wouldn't be hot anymore, but it should still be edible. Most of it anyway.
The book was just beginning to capture his attention when his cellphone rang, playing some stupid pop song that Dean had changed his ringtone to as a joke. Ignoring the swooping sensation in his stomach, Castiel swiped his thumb across the screen, anticipaton curling in his gut. "Hello?"
He didn’t forget that this entire thing was his fault in the first place. If it hadn’t been for him, they would have never had to deal with this witch and they wouldn’t have to be risking their lives to take her down. He knew that they didn’t blame him for any of it, but that didn’t matter; he blamed himself enough for all of them.
A few hours later, Dean was roused by a knock on the door. He glanced at Cas and saw bright blue eyes looking back at him.
Dean shook his head. “I don’t wanna.” he muttered, throwing his arms around Castiel’s waist and burying his face in his thigh.
But he still had to do it. He cared about Sam, after all. And he knew Sam would be both angry and depressed after his fight with Dean.
Dean and Castiel had come back a couple of hours ago after disappearing to God knows where. (Gabriel is convinced they ran off for a couple of quick blowjobs in the Impala, but what does he know?) And now he’s here, watching all of the ‘grown ups’ (he uses that word sarcastically) interact with each other. Talking about plans and powers and probably fucking homeless people, who knows?
Andrew nodded excitedly. “My thoughts exactly! So I did a little research and…I know how she did it.” He looked blinked. “Or, well she didn’t do it, exactly, it was more of…”
Castiel was shaking by the time he made it to his car. It took him three tries to even unlock the door, and another five to get the keys in the ignition. He was stupid. Now everyone would know. He wouldn’t be surprised if someone had videoed it. It would be viral by the morning. And everyone he knew, his family, his co-workers…they’d all know what type of person Castiel was. A homewrecker.
“I offered to put him up in a room, but he said he had things to do.” Dean was about to reply when there was a knock on the door. He sighed and stood up.
“Cas, please. I’m ready.” Dean grunted. He angel stopped for a moment and then looked up at Dean, his expression calculating.
“This is useless.” Dean said, slamming his book and pushing it forward on the table. “Why don’t we just go hunt her down and force her to do it?”
too much time with Dean. I never thought I’d get to hear you say something like that.” Gabriel chuckled again. “Gotta give that one to Dean.” He chuckled again and clapped Cas on the back once more. “I’m gonna go find my hunter and try to calm him down.” Cas nodded.
So really, all they had to do was make sure that Andrew didn’t die in the process of killing Casmiria and everything will be peachy.
“Dean, we are going to have to scope the place out first. We don’t know what we are up against. You don’t really want to go in blind with guns blazing, do you?” Dean didn’t speak because yes, that was exactly what he wanted. He wanted to get his best friend back and that was the quickest way to do it.
No, there was too many ways that particular plan could go wrong. And too many things that would have to go exactly right for it to work. Ironically enough, it was the exact kind of plan he would have gone ahead with once upon a time. Running in, guns blazing, and attempting to force whatever it was he wanted out of whoever he wanted it out of. That used to be his kind of plan. Reckless. Foolhardy. High probability of dying.
“How about Sammy and I go and find her while you stay here and with baby Cassie?” Gabriel said. Once Cas was quiet again in Dean’s arms, Dean spoke up.
to look. I mean, maybe it was just because he had been a baby but to Dean, Cas was absolutely beautiful. Maybe it had taken Cas being an infant to make Dean see it, but hell, he was hot. Dean shook his head.
“Unless…what if we surprise her early? Tomorrow, maybe?” Dean said. He started to pace. “I mean, just because she gave us until Friday doesn’t mean we have to wait, right? We could always go early. If we catch her off guard…”
The entire world was fuzzy. His ears were buzzing and he couldn’t remember where he was. He opened his eyes and immediately shut them. Lights hurt, too. And what was that noise? That beeping. He wished he could cut it off. It was hurting his head. He opened his eyes and tried to sit up, only to realize that he was tethered to the bed. He reached up, feeling a tube in his nose. What in the hell?
Castiel was relieved when the work day was finally over. Most of the other workers had already left by the time Castiel clocked out, so both the elevator and the parking deck were deserted by the time he got to them. It was a little spooky, walking to his car alone, but he almost always stayed late. He was used to it.
“She said she was there for a moment and then disappeared. Long, dark hair, tall. Wearing a long-sleeved purple shirt with a corset and a long black skirt.”
“These feel nice, Dean.” Cas commented as he pulled on the boxers.  Dean flushed and Gabriel and Sam exchanged smiles.
He knew the end was coming quicker than he could ever imagine, the way it always did when Cas blew him. Dean didn’t know if it was because of the fact that Cas was an angel or what, but he gave the best blowjobs. Like…ever. Dean tightened his hands in the angel’s hair and thrust up into his mouth. Cas stopped moving and surrendered control over to him, making Dean groan as he thrust faster and faster, fucking himself into the warm, tight heat of Cas’ mouth. The sensation made him moan.
“Stupid bitch.” Amanda said, stepping over her body and into the room. Castiel blinked twice and managed to get himself up on one elbow. He watched the woman until he felt a warm presence at his side. He looked up and saw Dean kneeling beside him. He was a little bruised and dirty but otherwise okay. He looked worried.
Castiel indulged him for a moment, bringing his lips back to Dean’s and kissing him lightly, slowly rolling his hips to give Dean (and himself) a little friction. Dean groaned at the contact.
Casmiria struck out, using her power to push Castiel back a few feet. Before he could approach her again, she’s across the room and she has Gabriel in her arms.
Dean could already feel his orgasm building. He’d been close before, when Cas was blowing him, and now he could feel his thighs shaking with the effort of holding back. He let go of Cas’ hips with one hand and grabbed the angel by the back of the head and pulled him down for a sloppy, wet, passionate kiss. Dean planted his feet onto the bed so he could continue to thrust into the angel as they kissed. Cas didn’t seem to mind, if the way he kept breaking away from the kisses to moan was any indication. Dean felt Cas move to sit up and he dropped his legs again, letting Cas set the pace again. The angel rocked on his lap with his head thrown back in ecstasy. All at once, Cas stopped moving, leaving Dean trembling and on the edge. Dean almost cried out when the sensations stopped. He opened his eyes and looked up at Cas. The angel’s eyes were hard and blazing, like a mixture of fire and ice.
“Wait…you are going to help, aren’t you?” Sam asked, moving along behind him. Andrew looked back at him and smiled sadly.
“You’re so eager, Dean.” Castiel said as he hooked his fingers and pressed against Dean’s prostate. Dean moaned loudly, arching his back. “I love seeing you like this. So ready for me. So needy. Do you need me, Dean?” Dean nodded feverishly and let out a deep moan as Castiel pressed a third finger into him. The hunter hissed a little at the burn but Cas hooked his fingers again, causing Dean to quite forget about the stretch and burn caused by the angel’s fingers. “You need me to fuck you, huh? You want my cock in your tight little ass?” Castiel growled as he pushed his fingers into Dean faster. The hunter’s dick was painfully hard and all Dean wanted to do was touch himself but when he tried Castiel batted his hand away.
“Let me finish.” The angel nodded, and Dean took another breath. “Regardless of what happens tomorrow, I wanted you to know that I love you. More than I’ve loved anyone in a long time.” Dean smiled at Castiel, who took a deep, shaky breath before speaking.
“Relax, Cas.” He said. “It’s gonna be fine. No one is going to expect us to be social after riding for six hours.” He waited  until Castiel nodded at him and then got out of the Impala. Castiel followed him after a second, and Dean opened the trunk to get their bags out as the same time the door opened. He handed Castiel his bags and slung his own over his shoulder and slammed the trunk, already smiling as Ellen strode across the yard.
feel the bare skin of Cas’ chest on his. Dean kissed Castiel heatedly, and the angel responded rather fervently. Dean wrapped his arms around his lover’s torso and held the two of them together.
, that made me feel the way you do, human or angel alike.” Cas moved his hands to cup Dean’s face. “And until you force me to leave, I’m going to be here, and I’m going to be yours. I don’t want anyone else, Dean. I never have and I never will. You may be an ‘old, broken down hunter’ but you are my old broken down hunter.” Cas brought his forehead to rest against Dean’s and looked him in the eye. “Believe me when I say I love you, Dean. I love you more than I have ever loved another being. Believe that I would die for you.” Dean smiled slowly, and Cas could swear there were tears in the hunter’s eyes when Cas leaned in to place a short, sweet kiss on Dean’s lips.
They still had Cas, so they weren’t completely without divine intervention, but still. There was the warding that Casmiria had managed to find and put up on that damn cabin. He knew that Gabe made Sam happy, and all that jazz, and he was probably a horrible person for thinking this, but he always preferred that Gabriel be on the front lines rather than his angel.
“I know. I’ve heard a lot about you. You’re all this numbskull talks about.” Ellen teased,  releasing him.
“I know.” Cas nuzzled Dean’s neck. “But it’ll be alright, Dean. We’ll find the girl and stop whatever is taking people.” Cas reassured Dean, kissing him on the corner of his mouth.
“Yes, mom, right before I got in the shower.” Cas smiled and leaned in close to Dean, inhaling deeply and running his nose up Dean’s neck. The simple action made Dean shiver and he felt blood rushing south.
“Lots.” Dean managed. He was quickly losing his ability to form coherent thoughts as Cas continued to work his mouth over the sensitive skin of Dean’s neck. The hunter let out a breathy moan when teeth grazed his earlobe. Castiel slowly made his way back up to Dean’s mouth and kissed him hard, tangling his hands in the hunter’s short blondish hair and securing their mouths together. Dean’s head was so full of Cas’ smell and the hot slide of the angel’s tongue against his own that his mind was slowly losing control over his body. So it wasn’t entirely his fault when he ran his hands down the angel’s back to grip his ass and pull him closer, bringing their hips together. Cas let out a surprised moan as Dean’s clothed erection brushed against his own. Castiel chuckled and slid one hand out of Dean’s hair and down between them to grip Dean through his jeans.
“I’m sorry, Lisa.” Castiel said, the truth ringing in his words. He didn’t know what else to say. “We didn’t want to hurt you.”
“Fuck, Cas, you gotta…” he moaned as the angel pulled back and off, giving his head little licks as he gazed up at him.
“No.” Cas said, shaking his head. Everyone looked at him incredulously and he realized that he had just said a word. He got excited and tried to say a sentence, but much to his disappointment all that came out was babble.
Dean agrees, which is why evaporation, or some sort of magical spell, is the only explanation he can think of.
Castiel stares back at her for a long moment, then drops his eyes when his friends erupt in laughter, a joke he didn’t hear.
“Good,” Dean answers. He wants to say more, because he actually does like talking about painting. But a few weeks ago, he’d offered to send John something he’d done, only for John to stammer and give some excuse about Adam getting into everything and not wanting Dean’s art to end up ruined.
Overwhelmed, Castiel pulls Dean in for a kiss, if only to keep him from talking. Dean flails a little in surprise, but soon catches himself and happily returns the kiss, resting one hand on Castiel’s waist. He practically melts into Castiel’s touch, humming like this is all he wants in the world. And Castiel’s heart is pounding, but it’s not affection or arousal. It’s fear.
Dean looks up, meeting Castiel’s eyes. After a long moment, he exhales and sits back, flipping his sketchbook around to show what he’s been working on: there aren’t a lot of details, but it’s clear he was sketching Castiel, playing with the shadows from the sunlight through the window.
“I got shit to do here,” Dean says, pointedly taking a long drink out of his cup. It burns going down and he can’t help wincing a little before turning back on Charlie. “How’d you find me anyway? These things ain’t exactly posted on MySpace.”
“Okay, okay.” Dean lifts his hands in surrender, but he’s still grinning charmingly. “We’ll talk about the prince and baby stuff at dinner. For now, I leave you in Jess’s capable hands so that I can get cleaned up.”
“Sun’s up, tourists are out, time to go home!” she says cheerfully. Jo groans, flipping onto her back in the sand.
“Cas! Cas, you can’t let Dean keep you away from the rest of us, okay? I know he’s got, like, a million grand romantic gestures planned, but you gotta make a little time for your friends in between all the gross sex.” Castiel tightens his jaw and reminds himself that she’s probably just making assumptions, and fighting those assumptions won’t do anything to help his case. “Me and Charlie are gonna go to the park this afternoon, and Sam said he might come with, and both you and Anna are required to be there.”
“Your little boyfriend interrupted something very important, Dean,” and it’s Alastair’s voice, smooth and condescending. There’s almost no anger in it, just a sort of jovial threat. “We can’t have people thinking they can get out of paying their debts because some fool decided to play hero.”
Cas’s hand is on Dean’s shoulder, squeezing hard enough that it hurts, and Dean actually looks up at him, confused when he sees narrowed blue eyes and a tight jaw. "It's not your fault, Dean," Cas says, and he looks so sincere that Dean almost believes him for a moment. Then, he remembers the role he's played in Alastair's business. Yes, Alastair is the leader, the head of operations. He convinces potential customers to buy from him, has expanded to helping them find locations and food and entertainment... but Dean is the muscle. The one who enforces the rules and punishes kids who can't keep up with Alastair's demands. And now, Dean is part of the advertised entertainment - pay a little cash, watch the wild boy kick somebody's ass. If anyone gets hurt, it's because of Dean. Because Dean can't control himself. Because-
But she doesn’t respond, because she’s already up helping Jo and Ash pack speakers into black cases, and Castiel pulls his phone out of his pocket, flipping it open. There’s a text from Gabriel, sent somewhere around the same time Dean was explaining what the Millennium Falcon was.
Dean’s so surprised that he almost doesn’t hear Bobby come in from the garage. The bearded old grizzly makes plenty of noise, though, stomping his boots on the ground and grumbling to himself before he comes into view. He notices Cas immediately.
Castiel holds up a placating hand, nodding slightly. “I know. Better than you do.” He knocks on the car’s roof, jumping when the minivan behind them honks its horn, the driver waving in annoyance. “I’ll call you,” Castiel repeats. “Drive home safe.”
Dean takes a seat on his bed and covers his face with his hands, taking deep, shuddering breaths. It takes several moments for him to finally calm down, and several more before he works up the courage to open the envelope.
“Why should I?” Dean snaps. “There won’t be enough money for both me and Sam to go, and Sam’s got bigger dreams. He should be allowed to chase them, shouldn’t he?”
Castiel takes a seat on the sofa and reaches for a laptop on the coffee table. Dean takes the cue to sit next to him, close enough to see the screen. “So what’s wrong?” Dean asks. Castiel takes a deep breath and types in a MySpace address.
“So it’s up to you, but I’d like to put all this behind us. I’d like to have the chance to prove I can make things good again.”
Sheepishly, Dean leans in for a quick hug and mumbles, "Hi Mom, thanks for giving me a ride," while Mary smirks.
Missouri nods, like this meets her approval, and turns her attention to Mary: “Did you need to speak to me, Ms. Winchester?”
Dean glances at Lisa, takes in her knowing smile, before he approaches the bed and carefully reaches out to drag his fingertips through the feathers. The touch causes them to jolt, and the figure to sit up and turn around.
“It’s not Dutch Bros, but it’s not bad,” Aaron answers honestly. Mary reappears just then, and when she notices Aaron, her smile falters as her eyes widen. She glances back and forth between the two boys for a moment before putting the smile back on and handing Castiel a small, brown bag.
Honestly, he had kind of hoped that when this finally happened, it would be in his bed. And at first, as he crawls up beside her, he tries to talk her into waiting the five minutes it would take to drive down the hill and get to his house. Mary’s working tonight, after all.
Dean fondly scratches Jo’s head as he nods at Pam. “You take over now. Just tell me what it all means.”
“Not that I know of,” Mary says. “Dean, you were pretty out of it last night. That party was incredibly loud, and almost everyone there was underage and drunk off their ass. There are lots of people in town that might have made that call.”
His voice startles her, and the candle wobbles in its holder when she turns to look at him. A smile quickly schools her features as she shakes her head. “No. Thankfully. I grew up here in Winchester.”
Dean grins stupidly, ignoring the catcalls that are coming from either Jo or Charlie; he can’t tell when his head is swimming like this. “What?”
Castiel doesn’t want to spend a whole summer without Dean, because if he’s honest, it probably means spending a whole
“No homo,” Cas supplies, and they both laugh. The sound fills the kitchen, and between Cas’s voice and the smell of honey-mustard chicken baking in the oven, Dean feels oddly at peace.
Castiel tightens his jaw and stubbornly keeps his eyes on the grass. The wind is up, whistling past his ears and through his hair, and Bela’s shoes fidget back and forth as she waits for him to respond.
It’s still dark out, moonlight streaming in through the little window near the ceiling. The fan whirs overhead, and Dean takes a deep, shaky breath before he sits up and tries to reorient himself. His drawings and posters are hanging on the wall, his bookshelf overflowing, his desk in the corner, his phone plugged in beside his bed.
“I was having car troubles and heard from a co-worker that Singer’s was the best place to go. Was actually hoping to see you there, but you weren’t working, so I went to get some tea while I wait.” She adds with a soft smile, “I suppose this is just fate.”
“I’d think you, of all people, would understand that Mother and Michael shouldn’t control every aspect of my life,” Castiel whispers back, earning a shocked look in his direction. Apparently, no one expected baby Castiel to start rebelling, even in these soft and subtle ways. Choosing his own friends should be a given, not a secret, and it troubles Castiel that Lucifer seems to have difficulty understanding this.
“I think it’s for you,” she teases. Dean frowns and takes his phone back. The tiny screen is lit up with Charlie’s name, and he rolls his eyes.
“His mom works three jobs and still struggles, so Dean helps her out,” Castiel answers simply. “Not every family brings in hundreds of thousands of dollars every month.”
Adam is Dean’s half-brother. John’s new son with some woman named Kate. He’s four now, and Dean didn’t even know he existed until a few months ago.
Castiel can’t catch enough air to answer the question. He feels like his heart is going to explode out of his chest.
“Oh, I liked her!” Charlie says, smiling brightly as she exchanges one card for another. “She and I emailed a few times while she was at school.”
“I’d never forget you, Dean.” Castiel has known for a long time now - even if he doesn’t make it back to Sileas next year, Dean and Sam and the Goonies he’s met this summer will be etched in his mind forever. Two months, and he doesn’t feel like the same boy he used to be, and it’s all thanks to these rowdy kids and their open arms.
Charlie cocks a disbelieving eyebrow while Jo laughs outright. “Please tell me I don’t have to live through yet another summer full of sad little Bambi eyes and ‘
Castiel slowly moves his hips forward, the head of his cock catching on Dean’s rim. Dean gasps and jerks back against the friction, whimpering softly. “Alpha,” Dean says, closing his eyes and baring his neck. “Please.”
“I’ll talk to Dean and see what he wants to do,” Castiel decides. “I’ll come if he invites me, and if your dad and his wife are okay with it.”
“My granddaughter, Eileen, helps out at the store too, and she’s around your age,” Mildred is saying as someone arrives with her food. “You’d like her, I think.”
He’s here, in his room, with his book. Just as he was not even a month ago. How quickly things change. How easily people become embedded in your life. Castiel briefly considers sneaking out once everyone’s asleep, but of course he’d just get caught. Every time he’s stayed out late, he’s gotten caught, and if he pushes too much, they might just leave Sileas altogether and never come back.
“Is that what this is about? Darling, why would it make you so angry that Cas wants to date me?” She flutters her eyelashes at him, leans into his space with a coy smile. Dean sits up straight, kicking his chair back to put more space between them.
“Fine,” Dean says. Mary hums, like she wishes he would tell her more, but she should know by now that Dean doesn’t like to talk about his sessions. They sit in silence for a moment, as if Mary is hoping Dean might open up a little more, until she finally sighs and turns the radio on.
Dean flips his phone shut and tosses it aside. Words are getting tangled on his tongue anyway, choking him, and he feels like his face is on fire. He rubs a hand over his eyes and groans. He fucked up, probably. Logic is foggy and distant, barely visible through a red haze, but Dean knows that Cas isn’t some sex-starved asshole, and he knows that Cas isn’t stupid enough to fall for Bela just because she puts out.
Dean glances back at the gate, then puts a hand on Castiel’s arm, guiding him down the sidewalk. They’re on the south side of town, and it’ll be a long walk back to Dean’s place, let alone to the resort. Dean stays close, keeping his voice low. “I kinda made a deal with them,” he says after a moment of silence.
Castiel really does intend to keep his promises to Dean, to talk to him and not to run away. So whatever Aaron wants to say, Dean doesn’t need to know just yet. It’s not as important as making sure tonight is perfect.
Even the music situation is fixed when Dean finds a radio station that’s playing hits from the eighties. It’s not Led Zeppelin and it’s not Dashboard Confessional, but they find themselves singing and dancing along anyway, and Castiel can’t remember the last time he felt so simply happy and whole.
Dean pulls away first, and now he’s blushing bright enough that Castiel can see it in the moonlight. They continue to gape at one another, Dean’s jaw working as if he wants to speak, but Castiel manages to beat him to it:
Dean coughs a few times, then finally manages to say, “Would you say that even if there wasn’t a baby or a throne on the line?”
Sam sticks out his tongue at him, and waves at everyone else, ignoring Dean when he raises a middle finger in Sam’s direction. Castiel had asked Dean, that second night out at the arcade, why he and Sam were so close that they hung out together outside the house, and even blurred the lines of who was friends with whom. It struck Castiel as a little odd, especially with their age difference. But Dean had shrugged it off, asking if it was a problem, and dropping the subject as soon as Castiel insisted it wasn't. On that matter, Castiel has never met Dean's parents before either. They either go out as a group, or no one's home while they hog the TV. Castiel glances at the clock under the TV, and sits up as Charlie gets up to choose another movie. It's only early afternoon. What is Dean's mother doing home at this time of day?
Cas is dating some actor’s daughter. Of course, because it’s bad enough that Dean is wearing tattered jeans that are a little too short at the ankle, that he’s been too busy helping with groceries and Sam’s soccer fees to buy himself new clothes. They’re already at such opposite ends of the social spectrum: Dean is poor, going to public school in a small town, a little nobody from nowhere, and Cas goes to a private school in New York City, surrounded by other rich and famous kids, all of them on the fast-track to places Dean could never dream of.
“His family gives him quite a boost, I think.” She smiles at Castiel, and for a moment he thinks that fawning gaze is real. “His mother is part of the Adler family, you know, that preacher that comes on TV sometimes? But his father’s where it gets interesting.”
Castiel busies himself in the mini-kitchen, turning his back on his sister and deciding that silence is the best answer. Because he doesn’t have one for Dean yet. All that time at school, and don’t think he didn’t spend most of it thinking about Dean and their relationship and where he wants it to go. Well, Castiel knows exactly where he wants things to go - he’s known since the first time he left Dean behind and realized just how much it hurt to be apart.
Castiel blinks out at the ocean before glancing at his brother. “Do you think I’d be any good at it?”
“This is okay?” Castiel manages, trying to press Dean’s legs even tighter, give himself better friction. Dean nods frantically, biting his lip and clutching at the blanket closest to his head. Castiel thrusts again, hard enough to drive Dean’s hips back to the bed, and Dean gasps at the friction against his own dick. Castiel smiles at this, and leans forward, pressing his forehead against Dean’s back. “What’s my name?”
Castiel opens his mouth to respond, but Dean puts a hand on his arm, and grins at Naomi. “There’s a few people out there who can vouch that I’m very good company,” he says with a wink. Both of Naomi’s eyebrows climb towards her hairline, before furrowing in annoyance.
Missouri sighs, setting her clipboard aside and leaning back in her chair. "We've discussed this before, Dean. Cas doesn't owe you anything. If he doesn't want to hear from you, you should respect that."
Dean side-eyes him for a moment, then laughs, straddling his bike. “Your humor’s going to take some getting used to. Hop on.” Castiel hesitates, and Dean sighs. “You sit, I’ll stand, let’s fucking go.”
Gabriel makes a few distracting huffs next to him before finally shoving his shoulder, forcing Castiel to glare at him. “C’mon, I want to know what’s all this shit about Dean. Last I heard, you and Dean-o weren’t exactly simpatico.”
Instead, he manhandles her until she’s leaning up against the back of the truck, spreads her legs, and dives in to enthusiastically eat her out, until her fingers clench in his hair and she moans softly and comes with his tongue still inside her. Lisa seems surprised by this, and when Dean sits up, she just looks at him in confusion until he smiles, and she smiles shyly back.
“Look, a kid talks about facing his brother instead of his parents, his friend seems genuinely concerned for his well-being, I start getting a little concerned too. I’m not arresting anyone or searching your house without a warrant. It’s just a ride home.”
“Really?” Castiel whispers, pushing Dean’s gift back and leaning over to check Sam’s pile. He, too, has gifts from not just Naomi, but all of Castiel’s siblings, and his father. “That’s… actually really thoughtful.”
They stay like that until the film ends. Castiel’s heart is pounding as he carefully slides his hand out of Dean’s grasp, and they quietly make their way through the crowd, back out into the sunshine. When Castiel glances over, Dean shrugs and starts walking off down the sidewalk. Panic shoots through Castiel, and he hurries to catch up, even though part of him wants to take off in the other direction and pretend that none of this ever happened.
Now it’s Sam’s smell that sours, and Castiel is having difficulty breathing while John sits, serene as a baby centaur. “What if both of your sons had been omegas, your majesty?”
It’s not even that late, but sleep has to be better than sitting in the dark, thinking about things Dean can’t change. Cas will be here tomorrow, and maybe he can help Dean get through this somehow.
The cineplex in Seaside is packed with teenagers and young adults, grabbing snacks and saving seats for their friends while they wait for the new
Dean stares at his mother, as the gravity of what he’s done starts to hit him. He’s done it again - treated Cas like a villain when all Cas was trying to do was help him. Blamed Cas for things that weren’t really his fault; he didn’t really call the cops, and he didn’t force Lisa to break up with Dean. In fact, not too long ago, he was trying to help them patch up.
Dean takes another breath and checks the clock. He’s got enough time to finish dinner and set it aside for whenever Sam gets home. “Yeah. I can do that. Address?”
He can feel slick dripping down the backs of his thighs, and he switches to three fingers, knuckle-deep. It’s not enough, it’s not
“How much pizza do you have when you’re gone all day?” she asks, studying him with suspicious blue eyes. “That sounded like a phone call to a close personal friend.”
Everyone turns to stare at the newcomer, a short boy who hasn’t gotten rid of his baby-fat yet and is attempting to cover it up with a trim-but-impressive beard. One hand is stuck in his pocket, while the other leans against a black umbrella as he smiles at the table. “What are you guys doing here?”
Castiel would swear in a court of law, hand on the Bible, that his heart stops for a solid ten seconds. He even drops his phone in his surprise, the clatter way too loud between the tile floors and high ceilings and empty aisles. He bends down to retrieve it, checks that there are no more cracks than there were before, then turns to blink owlishly at Jo, who stands at the mouth of the aisle with a blue basket in her hand.
“That’s smart,” Castiel comments casually, and he doesn’t look at Dean as he climbs out of the backseat and stretches in the cool night air. He waits until he hears Dean slide into the driver’s seat before he gets back in on the passenger side, and stares out the window at Jody’s car as Dean pulls back onto the road.
Missouri, though, she smiles. Bright and wide in a way Dean hasn’t seen on her before, and she holds the frame in one hand while reaching out with the other to pull Dean into a hug. “You’re such a sweet boy,” she murmurs as he wraps his arms around her. “It’s nice of you to think of me.”
Maybe Castiel can’t perform. Maybe Dean can’t. Maybe he hurts Dean on accident. Maybe the condoms all break. Maybe Castiel reacts the same way to anal sex that he did to oral and this whole thing goes off the rails; after all, it is pretty gross when you think about it.
for continuing to beta this monster of a fic!! And to those of you who are still powering through this with me and kept pestering for updates: I love you! :) Hope this makes up for the last installment's mess!
Cas sighs, and for a moment, Dean feels guilty for trying to pile this on his friend. It’s his weight to bear, not Cas’s.
“I don’t know what to say,” Dean whispers. “She walked out after I fought that guy. What do I tell her?”
"You're being obtuse," Cas accuses with a frown. He pushes himself back away from Dean, accidentally jostling Meg off his shoulder as he does so, but he doesn't seem to notice her little pout. "If Harry dies, then where does that leave Ron and Hermione? How do they feel about Harry's sacrifice? What about Molly Weasley? Hell, what about Ginny, Dean? Are they going to be so grateful that it completely erases their pain and loss? Does Harry's sacrifice take into account how much it hurts the people he loves?"
It’s too simple. Too easy. It’d make Dean a loose thread, someone who knows too much and poses a risk. If Dean ever dropped off the radar, Alastair would absolutely send Ruby or Lilith off to find him and drag him back, and if he refused, then Azazel would send a message somehow. Dean’s in this too deep and he knows it, but he can’t resist that light in Cas’s eyes.
-” He stops himself and whistles. “You take care of that boy, Castiel, you hear me? You take care of yourself, but keep an eye on him too.”
,” Charlie groans, draping the book over her face in distress. “He’s almost as bad as Liefeld. But Loeb wrote it and it’s so good and I’m so
He leans back against the wall, taking in the scenery. Leaves are thrashing in the wind, and white-tipped waves crash against the empty beach. Even the tourists won’t risk a swim when the sky looks so angry. The air is thick and heavy, half sea salt and half that pungent nature smell that comes with a storm. Dean’s back is already soaked with sweat from the humidity. He actually feels a small pang of regret - this is the perfect weather to get together at Charlie or Pam’s house, play card games and watch movies while the storm rages on outside.
