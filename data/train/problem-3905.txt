Cas had been undressing for bed when he heard the gentle paps on the door. "So you've changed your mind and come to join," he paused as he opened the door, "me." His playful flirtatious smile soured into a cold grimace. "What do you want, Dean?"
Cas narrowed his eyes as he looked to Cain. "What's going on here? I told you that in confidence. What do you need me for? What is this spell she's talking about?"
Cas gulped quietly as he held Dean's eyes. "Someone like you then?" He whispered in the darkening room.
Dean rested his hands on Cas's hips, keeping their bodies pressed together. "I want so much more, Manny." He whispered back, "I just want you, always. For as long as you'll have me." He brushed through Cas's dark curls.
Hannah cleaned the tray and went to the door with it. “As you wish, my lord.”
"I've been thinking since I've found that circlet, Clary. You've been in Omundington for four months now. You arrived right after Prince Castiel's death, you have circlet that only comes from status." She went to get the bag stashed under the floorboards under their bed. She threw the circlet on the table as Cas wrote. "Are you Castiel? Are you the prince this kingdom has mourned for four months? Even the king?"
Cas hadn't spoken a single word since Dean ended their relationship. Seven long days past, and he simply drifted through the week. He sat on his bedroom balcony with a cup of tea. He didn't hunger for food, so he didn't eat. As Cain slept soundly at night, Cas laid wide awake, staring at the ceiling of their room. The king figured out that something was upsetting Cas, but Cain couldn't get Cas to speak with him. For a long week, his worry only grew more with every passing day. His bubbly, cheerful Cas paled and wasted away to a scrawny frame. Cain finally pulled Dean into his study before Dean went to his guard duty.
Dean had his arms crossed as he sat in the lobby area of the inn, watching Cain's affection with Cas. He had to talk to Cas. He had to tell him, show him, how sorry he was, how he regretted ever betraying Cas. He waited for Cain to retire to his room and made his way to Cas's room. He knocked quietly.
"I think I'll stay until I have to go. Wouldn't want Hannah to find us together." He smiled. Cas nodded and settled into bed, happy that Dean would stay if only for a little while longer. Dean stayed in bed until Cas had fallen into a deep sleep. When he was sure Cas wouldn't wake, Dean eased out of bed and went down to the barracks. He had made acquaintances with several men, but only one had taken a real liking to Dean.
“Come here.” Dean pulled him up roughly, putting his legs behind himself. “You’re not as innocent as you make yourself seem, are you?” He grinned, pulling his face into a hungry kiss, nipping his bottom lip.
She nodded, looking at the ring on his finger again. “He probably couldn’t go through that loss again.”
"It seems like you've forgiven me?" He asked hopefully, wrapping his arms around Cas's waist.
Dean nodded once, "I must leave in a fortnight with or without him. Cain needs to know the fate of his bridegroom."
Cain slowly woke up as Cas grabbed him, finally jolting awake when Cas called his name. He quickly lit a candle and looked to Cas. His face was red and twisted in pain; Cain pressed his hand to Cas's stomach, grinning as he realized what was happening. Cas grabbed his nightshirt and pulled him down. "I swear to god, Cain if you don't go find your physician, I will put you through as much pain as I am in now." Cain rushed out of the room and left Cas alone as he searched for the physician. Cas cried out loudly and clutched his stomach harder. He took a few deep calming breaths and focused his energy on vanishing from the room. He stood through the excruciating pain and appeared down in the barracks. "Dean... dean?" He called out weakly, grabbing an empty bunk's post as another contraction worked over his body.
Cas relaxed again; Dean did love him. He was the reason Dean was still here. "We've been over this, Dean." He laced their fingers together. "We'll have to continue this in secret for now." He sighed and pulled the blankets over them. "When do you start training with Alistair?"
Michael watched his youngest brother in confused awe, shocked that he stood up for himself, terrified of what he could now do. Cas left the room and returned to the throne room, leaving Michael behind. He stood from the floor, hands on his hips. He wouldn't let Castiel think he'd won. He exited the room a few moments after Cas did, pulling Lucifer aside before the ceremony started. "My dear brother, I do think our baby brother has become a serious threat."
Jess came over to the two brothers, patting her baby's back gently. She looked over the mark, glancing to Sam. "Perhaps moving to Eastden is actually better for us. Think about it, Sammy. We wouldn't have to hide in the woods anymore. We could still plan a rebellion, but safely for our children. We could give her a real home instead of a tent."
Dean slammed her against the stone wall, pressing his arm to her throat. “Your life sounds pretty valuable right about now. Tell me what you know.”
Cain stood in plain traveling clothes, looking around the room with a gentle smile. Cas had decorated his room with his own paintings. Cas painted the city, the forests beyond the gates, even the sunrises and sunsets from his balcony view. "Your brothers didn't mention you were an artist."
Dean peered into Cas’s deep blue eyes, searching for any hint of deception behind his words. When he couldn’t find any, he made a pained sigh as he looked away from those big innocent eyes. “But you’re the prince. You’re supposed to be just like the others.” He cupped Cas’s face, searching again for deceit. “You made this black-and-white world gray, Cas.” He pulled Cas into a soft, needy, urgent kiss, trying to fight the single tear that rolled down his cheek. He pinned Cas against the wall as they continued to kiss; Cas let him pin his hands above his head, too lost in Dean to care until the loud clank of the shackles interrupted them. Cas looked up at the bonds, then back to Dean, fear and confusion spreading across his face. “I’m sorry, Cas. I can’t wait for you to think of something that won’t work. I have to take my chance now.” Dean stole one final kiss, pressing his forehead to Cas’s, then started towards the door.
"What did you do to him?" Dean snatched Amara away from Cas, holding and shaking her by her shoulders. "What did you do?!" He shouted louder, but Amara only threw her head back in mad laughter.
Amara thought for a brief moment, looking Dean up and down as she did. "Court him. If he accepts your advances, I won't stand in your way. No matter the consequences." She cupped his cheek before patting his face with a smirk. "I'll write Cain about your decision to stay longer. Of course, I'll be discreet. Wouldn't want the entire Eastden army marching on my kingdom." She drew in closer, her lips just inches away from Dean's. "It's a pity you prefer Castiel. Your bloodline is strong, perfect for my kingdom."
Dean grinned as Raphael drew his sword as well. "Well either way, I'm going down swinging." Uriel swung his sword at Dean's feet in an attempt to knock him down, but Dean jumped back. He plunged the knife in Uriel's arm and twisted the blade until Uriel dropped his sword. Dean scurried to pick up the newly freed sword, quickly holding it over his head as Raphael's blade came down on him. He kicked the other guard off of him, holding the sword defensively. He started to back away from the gallows, ready to kill if he had to.
Dean covered his mouth, whispering "Cas..." before he shoved Cain aside and bolted across the room as Cas fell backwards off the balcony. Dean grabbed his hand before he went over and tried pulling him back over the balcony. Cain ran over and grabbed Cas's other hand, and together the two men pulled the prince back to safety. Cain sat with Cas in his lap and cradled him to his chest as Cas shook with desperate sobs. Cain couldn't help but cry with him, pressing gentle kisses to his forehead.
Sam pursed his lips, shooting Dean his familiar bitch face, "Dean, I can't go with you, but if you feel like you need to go, then go." Dean nodded and the two started back to camp. Dean smiled as Emma ran to meet him. He hugged her and picked her up. He held her on his hip, walking to their tent. "How would you like to go see a big fancy castle? We have to take Henry to see his mama."
Michael waved the guards away. "Two fifty since he maimed one of my best soldiers."
Noctis walked down through the empty halls, dragging his hand along the stone walls. He couldn't let too many people know his secret; Dean needed to know, so he wouldn't try to harm him again, but Lucifer didn't. He grinned as he raced through the halls and down the stairs to find his “brother.”
Cas hesitantly nodded and started picking at the blankets again. "One of the guards tried," he choked on his words and trembled under the blankets violently. He took another deep breath. "He tried to have his way with me, but Dean stopped him."
"Because I was blessed with good looks and irresistible charm." He chuckled and reached behind him to grip Dean's cock. "How else would I have the nefarious rebel under in my bed?"
"Well, I do have the youngest prince's favor; surely, he could pull some strings, order new loyalties, couldn't he?" A playful grin teased Cas and sent another shiver down his spine.
He smiled and leaned into her touches. “I’ve always wanted a mother.” He mumbled, a blissful numbness overtaking him. “She wouldn’t have let me be hurt.”
Cain finished his beverage. "I sent Dean for you, is that not enough?"
Cas's breathing hitched in his throat as Dean caressed his bare skin, and he arched into Dean's body. He ignored Dean's comment and tugged on Dean's hair to pull his face up. He held his breath as he looked those needy, demanding green eyes. "please. Just shut up and fuck me." He grinned, kissing Dean's lips to silence him. Dean grinned against Cas's lips, dropping his pants to his ankles. Cas lifted his hips and pulled his own pants down. Dean threw them aside, locking his lips with Cas's again. He pulled Cas's legs back to his hips. Dean gripped Cas's hip firmly, fumbling to his right for an oil basin. He dipped two fingers inside the jar as he kissed along Cas's jaw and neck, then pressed the two fingers against Cas's asshole, rubbing his rim slowly. Cas tensed as Dean touched him, biting his lip as he relaxed. Dean pressed his fingers in, gently pumping them in and out to loosen Cas up. He didn't want to hurt him the first time they made love after being apart for so long. Cas whined and twitched as Dean opened him up, squirming underneath him. He wanted more than Dean was giving him, and he knew Dean was teasing him. Once Dean was sure Cas was stretched enough, he reached for the oil again and coated his aching erection with the fresh oil. He closed his eyes as he rubbed his cock, and for a brief moment, forgot Cas was waiting for him to continue. Cas whined in protest as Dean pleasured himself alone, wrapping his leg around Dean's waist. Dean gripped his hip again, grinning to himself. "Sorry." He whispered and pressed the tip of his cock against Cas's entrance. He pushed inside, groaning at the familiar tightness and warmth of Cas, burying his face in Cas's neck as he slid his full length inside Cas. Cas scratched at Dean's back as Dean took him fully, a loud gasp escaping from his lips. He tangled his fingers in Dean's hair as Dean settled inside of him, pulling his face up so he could kiss those plump lips. As Dean kissed the prince, he started to move his hips in a slow, even thrusts. He moaned into Cas's mouth, a wave of grief, joy, ecstasy, regret crashing over him as he moved with Cas's jolts and twitches. He had to let Cas go and embrace Emmanuel. Cas met and matched Dean's moans, letting Dean find his pace for a few more thrusts before Cas needed more. He nudged Dean to lay down, and he did, letting Cas ride his lap as he got comfortable. Cas pressed his hands on Dean's chest, a devilish grin dancing on his lips. He slowly started bouncing on Dean's dick, letting him think he'd continue the slow easy pace Dean had set. When Dean closed his eyes, Cas seized his chance and sped his hips up in a wild frenzy. He dug his nails into Dean's skin, moaning loudly as he worked himself over. Dean groaned louder as Cas quickened his movements, arching his back as Cas scratched him. He looked up through hooded eyelids, eyes dark as ink. Cas met those onyx pools with his own glowing blue eyes, growling for dominance. The two grabbed and clawed at each other as they rolled in bed, fighting each other for control. Dean pinned Cas's hands above his head finally, slamming his cock harder and rougher into Cas's prostate, wanting to draw out those whines of submission.
Her smiled disappeared as she continued her makeup. "Tragic, really. I was worried sleeping with Dean would wake you up, but I put our connection at risk for his chance at happiness." She stood from her mirror, "Surely my life is better than yours. No pain, No sorrow. Only bliss, Castiel." She walked over to him and rested her hands on his shoulders. "As it should be."
Emma studied his hand for a moment before taking it, glancing back to the woman with a smile. "Maybe. Is it true you're a prince, Cas?" She turned her attention up to Cas now.
"Cas, you gonna come say hi?" he asks.
. It's in just
Cas looks down at his hands. "I'm sorry, Dean. My intentions were never to make you uncomfortable."
. It's in just saying it."
Don't get him wrong- Dean knows he's emotionally constipated. He is aware. But with years of thinking
Castiel loves him. He'd said it. Dean dares to hope, for once, that he meant it as in
"Knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you."
And he laughs. He
because it's all so absurd- he doesn't know if he's alive or dead, doesn't know what's happened back on Earth, and he can't tell which direction he's going. But not once do the thoughts
"Cas," he mumbles, and pulls back to get another look at him. "What the hell were you thinking?" Dean demands. "What
"Dean," Cas mutters, voice rough. "You're here- you're not supposed to be here. I wasn't supposed to take you, too."
It's really good to be home.
something. This is what they meant. Cas loves him. And Dean loves him back- he's pretty sure he always has.
He's always been great at fucking things up royally, hasn't he? Can't he do this one thing? Can't he (as selfish as it is, but Dean
All that follows is silence.
because he doesn't think he can handle that.
where is Cas? Is Sam here? Jack? Well, there's only one way to find out, so he gets up, opens the door to his room and goes out to the living room. And boom, there's Cas, Sam, and Jack, sitting on the couch, talking quietly. Jack looks up and nudges Sam, and everyone looks up with similar expressions of shock.
"You know, ever since we met and ever since I pulled you out of Hell-"
that scares him. Not only has Dean seen too many friendships end because feelings got involved, but with their lifestyle, when any of them could die in a moment? It would be so much worse to lose Cas if they were more. Although maybe, he thinks, it hurts worse
because Cas was ready to die thinking Dean didn't love him back.
He picks a direction and starts walking. And the thing about walking, especially walking to a completely unknown destination (except that it's where Cas is,
"How-" Dean furrows his brows, "How d'you know?"
And Dean does, Dean goes. He sprints in the general direction of the crying, and as he gradually gets closer, he starts calling- "Cas? Cas!" He's out of breath and a cramp is starting to form in his left side, but he keeps going, because
"Because someone came through here about five minutes ago calling your name," Raziel says, "And you, me and him are the only ones awake in the Empty right now."
Cas' mouth opens to reply, but before he can say anything, there's a tugging in the pit of Dean's stomach and everything goes black.
"I can get you out," Jack says bluntly.
Cas' happiest moment? And he's so busy thinking about keeping Cas
"You what?" he asks, the sinking feeling that usually signals something awful happening immediately after creeping into his stomach. What sort of deal could Cas have made? What would he have given away? And this is important somehow, isn't it?
that Dean is good.
"The last deal someone made
Maybe it's this thought that gets him going. He's exhausted, his heart feels like it's going to burst, and there's a tugging in the pit of his stomach that says
But then Castiel's hand is on Dean's chest, shoving him back. His back hits the wall with a thud just as blind panic forces him back up, back onto his feet. He sees the Empty is reaching for Cas, winding around him, but Dean absolutely will not stand here and let this thing take Castiel. So he reaches out and grabs Cas' arm. The angel's eyes go wide and alarmed just as the Empty takes him.
“That’s not the question is it.” Dean shot back. Cas let out an annoyed sigh, it was probably the 5th time he’s made this noise within the hour and Dean woulda called him on it too if he wasn’t interrupted by another loud clap of thunder.
“No-“ he whispered. Cautiously Sam made his way over to the table, and slowly lifted the white sheet that had covered Dean’s body, revealing his lifeless face. Tears welled in his eyes as he went to hold his brother's face. “No- no what happened. Cas what happened” his voice wavered as he spoke, and his body seemed to shake violently. His eyes never left deans body as he asked again. “Tell me what happened.”
Dean was rounding the corner of the bunker, heading into the kitchen when he heard Jack quietly singing to himself. He stopped when he didn’t recognize the weirdly upbeat number, usually he wouldn’t have given it a second thought, but the lyrics sounded weirdly deep.
“Well you know my perfect day.” Cas began, but Dean shrugged, encouraging him to continue. “While I agree with everything you said, if I had to be original and choose my perfect day it would be one where I could all my time outdoors. Nothing too extravagant, but just a relaxing picnic where I could listen to the bees, and drink expensive champagne.” Cas’s voice had sort of trailed off, he’d be lying if he wasn’t referring to one of the earlier dates Dean had taken him on. When they first played, Cas answered this question fairly similar, and Dean listened. For their half year anniversary, Dean or Michael had given Cas his perfect date. Dean also picked up on this, he looked away, ashamed. Because how could he forget? Things were so easy back then. But it didn’t have to be a somber memory! The relationship wasn’t over and Dean was sure he could salvage it.
“No, you’re fine. I was just wondering.” He muttered, to which he turned around and went back to his room completely forgetting what he wanted from the kitchen in the first place.
“What? No! No I wasn’t looking at you like
I couldn’t help myself and figured I’d write their reunions. I hoped you enjoyed my story, please let me know what you thought!
“I uh, I’m just looking at these lyrics, the kid was singin it earlier. I was trying to figure what it’s about” Dean muttered, his eyes darting from the laptop to Cas’s face, who looked as if he were in deep thought.
“Because of you? You’re special but not that special. I have been fucked up ever since I was a kid. This has always been my destiny, my story never allowed for a happy ending.” Dean was speaking fast now, his tone was aggressive and his words were sharp. Cas closed his eyes and looked down.
“I didn’t come all the way out here to burn your papers, I didn’t come out here to befriend a duck, I came out here for one thing which was to get over you.” Yikes okay, at least he was being honest. Dean opened his mouth as if he could say anything that could defend his actions but quickly came up short. “I came up here for one thing, but now I have to change the broken light bulb, and patch up the leaky ceiling, oh and the toilets broken, the service is faulty, not to mention-“
“I uh-yeah that’s the thing, I am so okay.”
“I uh- yeah, yeah me and Cas were uh, just discussing possible meanings.” Dean took a quick glance at Cas who just nodded. He was standing stiff, still at a bit of a loss from the progression of the conversation he was having with Dean minutes before.
“Yes! Yeah, yes I think so.” Dean had mumbled the last part, he was shifting again, his eyes darting to the ground as all the suppressed memories were coming back.
“Why does this sound like a goodbye?” Dean’s voice pierced Cas’s mind, derailing his thoughts only for a second that allowed him to wonder what if? What if this wasn’t a good idea? What if the pain of the other would outweigh the good that would come? What if he loved him back? The pain of delving into any of these would be too much, best to leave it unsaid, and keep powering forward. Dean needed to live.
A few more days go by and Cas works up the courage to make his way into the neighborhood where the Winchesters reside. Mary, John, Bobby, and now Dean would call this their eternal home, and Castiel almost turned around. He pushed on though, reminding himself that he couldn’t stay hidden forever, and he honestly did want to check in on Mary, he had cared for her so deeply. As he grew closer to Bobby’s residence, that’s when he saw him, the smiling, content rugged figure, climbing into the driver seat of that damned impala.
God the butterflies that gave the Winchester. Though on second thought that smile had always given him butterflies.
Cas took a slow step towards Dean, who had tears staining his cheeks, yet his face was stoic, and emotionless. The angel brought his hand up and gently pressed it against his cheek, using the pad of his thumb to wipe away a single tear. It was then when Dean no longer held back. In one Swift motion, the two were one. Their lips meet in almost a desperation as if Dean was trying to prove to himself that Cas really was there. When the two finally pulled away, he wrapped his arms around the angel and they stayed like that for a long time.
“I know, but we’re making this an authentic experience.” Dean let out a short chuckle of sorts “and in this case I’m sure you know that I am very much balls to the wall. If shit comes out shit comes out.”Cas let out a low hum as he practically cradled the whisky bottle.
Cas listens to Deans Voice mail.
“Oh yeah I’m totally good, I just didn’t realize how much this related to us-“ Dean cut himself off when he realized he had said too much, sure he meant for that to be implied with everyone who had fought for team free will, but right now, in a room with just him and Cas, it looked an awful lot like Dean had just admitted he had seen himself and the angel within the context of the song.
“Dean, you deserve love. You’ve always deserved love. I wish you saw you the way I see you.” Cas took a shaky breath before continuing “I heard every prayer, every apology, and I felt every single emotion you have had since I was able and I once again broke the rules for you. Because I can’t sit idly by and watch you kill yourself I won’t do it.”
“Jack.” Was all the angel had managed to choke out. His voice was weak, in fact his entire body was weak but none of that mattered because for the first time in what felt like an eternity he was with someone he loved. Soft silent tears fell down his face as he reached out to take Jack’s hand, who gladly took it pressing his other hand on top giving him a reassuring squeeze.
“I am real. I don’t know what to say to convince you of that but it’s me, and I can’t see you like this anymore. Ever since Jack pulled me from the empty I have been watching over you. And I wanted to be in your life, but you have to understand I couldn't. I could hardly bear to see you like this, and I had to come back because I can’t- I can’t let you throw everything away because of me.” As Cas spoke Dean let out an audible laugh, a crass, snappy noise that pushed out of the Winchesters mouth, causing the angel to wince.
do goodbyes, and you just- and I couldn’t even-“ he took a breath struggling to find the words “I-I told you not to do that again. Not to fucking get dead on me like that I don’t care, I told you not to do that again.” He let out a shaky breath, he didn’t realize he was beginning to tremble until he took a second to recompose. Cas was silent, he looked absolutely petrified, and heartbroken. “That being said.” Dean began shaking his head as a small smile crept onto his face. “I am so happy to see you.”
Him, the goddamned angel, the fucking man of the hour, Castiel.
“He’s dead. They both are.” A new voice seemed to enter his mind, a darker more sinister tone. Cas let out a sharp breath, the blade was nearly half way down his first wing and he could hardly process the pain he was feeling anywhere else.
(See the end of the chapter for
Yeah, it was hard. But Dean had Sam, and as long as they continued to do good for this world he would be okay. Things had actually begun to feel somewhat normal again when the boys got the vampire case. It didn’t feel like anything out of the ordinary, nothing special or strange, just a regular vamp nest who would go after families who lived out in the countryside. It wasn’t anything too difficult, it shouldn’t have been.
“What are you looking at?” Dean physically felt his soul leave his body, as he jumped so hard his knee hit the desk where his laptop sat.
“Times up boys.” Billy bent down and touched Dean’s shoulder, in which Cas saw his eyes shut, and his body grow limp and lifeless as he slumped against the wall. As Death disappeared it was only then that Cas could run towards him. He was quickly on the ground, his eyes still wide with shock as he pressed his hand into the wound. He should’ve understood, should’ve handled this like he had been able to every other time they lost someone, but this felt different.
“Are you alright? It’s okay if you’re not, I understand how this became much darker then I’m sure you anticipated.” Cas seemed to be rambling, well as close to rambling as the angel would allow. Dean just nodded letting out a cough as if he were clearing his throat, or maybe just filling the silence.
“no, no I’m past letting this go. If you said this to me three weeks ago? I would’ve walked away, but I’m tired of seeing you like this Dean.” Dean shifted in his spot as if the air around him was poking and prodding him like an itchy sweater.
It was perfect. Except for of course- Cas wasn’t exactly talking to Dean. Sure there were pleasantries! Quiet grunts of hellos and goodbyes, the casual “how are you” or “pass me a beer” was passed around quite often. The former spoken more by Cas, and the latter— Dean. But what was Dean supposed to say? “Hey pal, I know you’re gay, and that’s really fucking cool, but what do you expect me to say?” None of that really like it rolled off the tongue. Besides, Cas wasn’t exactly jumping through hoops to talk to Dean either.
“Cas, I need to tell you” Cas tilted his head, his brows furrowing as he watched the other seem to struggle to find the words. “I believe- I believe Dean is going to die soon. I can’t know for sure but there’s something different and the presence around him, well it doesn’t feel the same.” Jack let out the words softly and slowly as if to let the density of the situation sink in. Cas stared at him for a moment only to begin to attempt to push himself from the bed.
“Jack is dead. Dean is dead. I’m alone, and there’s no one to blame, but you Castiel. You- you were supposed to protect my brother I thought you cared about him! I thought you cared about us, but you fucking LEFT HIM ALONE AND NOW HES DEAD. Jack- oh yes jack is gone too, you see Cas, you can’t protect someone when you leave them and now they’re facing their own consequences. And with chuck still in charge, you know neither of them found their way through the “pearly gates” “ his tone was mocking, condescending punches that knocked Cas down over and over again.
“It’s you, ya son of a bitch.” Cas rolled his eyes. Dean always had a habit of stating the complete and utter obvious, that’s one of the first things Cas fell in love with, as annoying as it was. Well except, it wasn’t Dean, it was Michael. Dean was still staring at him, half expecting him to laugh or grunt or something but Cas was giving him very little. “You uh- you wanna ask the second question?” Sure Dean was a little on edge, but honestly he was  just impressed he got this far. Cas opened his mouth as if he were going to say something, but opted to stay quiet as he wordlessly took the packet from the other’s hand.
has a chance to get his perfect life back. Cas is looking at him expectantly, he looks tired and disappointed, but Dean knows he can fix it if he just pulls the right strings.
“Dean.” Cas physically cringed at the slip up. His nails pushed into the label of the whisky bottle and he averted his gaze only for a moment.
“Yeah, yeah I would. If I could be famous, I would want to be known for creating a giant cross country scavenger hunt that raised money for all kinds of charity organizations, weirdly specific but I think that’s why I like it.” He paused, “I also think I could crush in Survivor.” Dean watched Cas for a second, smiling even as Cas disappeared into the other room. A few minutes later, Cas returned with a single bottle of unopened whisky. He placed it on the table and unscrewed the cap. He plopped down on the old leather couch next to Dean. “I couldn’t find any glasses, well none that looked sanitary, but I figured the bottle would do.” Dean grinned, reaching over to take the bottle off the table before Cas could even get the cap off.
“Oftentimes yes. You knew that though.” Cas sighed, twisting open the cap. Dean simply shrugged.
Dean struggles with the loss of Cas, but all is soon forgiven.
“Billy attacked. I was going to sacrifice myself, I made a-a deal a while back to save Jack from the empty. I was going to take his place- I was going to go to the empty and take Billy with me to save Dean.” Cas rambled on, Jack looked at Cas as if he was crazy to even think about attempting to pursue that, but Cas pressed on. “Instead- the warding didn’t hold. She came in before the empty could-could take us. And she killed Dean. I tried Sam. I'm so sorry.”

A little late with the update, but here it is! (sorry for any mistakes)
Heaven needed to be fixed as well. There were so many tasks and Jack was starting to feel overwhelmed. First things first, Jack needed to make his home. His immediate thought was the bunker. That has always been his home, where he felt the safest. However, that would remind him of Sam and Dean.  He didn’t think he could handle that. After some thought he decided he would make a small cabin his home. The cabin he was born in. The place he met Sam and Dean, but wasn’t too attached to. That would be good. He would be reminded of the times he lived on earth, but would also be able to focus on his job. With that settled, Jack began. He quickly conjured the cabin and started setting everything up inside. He wanted to be ready for Cas. There was much to do and Jack was ready to get started.

Now they have a plan! Will it work? What's with the empty and the other powers? I have a general draft of the plot line but I'd love to hear what you all think!

As always, I hope you enjoyed the chapter!
I hope you all enjoyed the chapter!
In case it wasn't that clear:
Cas and Jack had been reviewing the progress on other worlds. The worlds without the same souls were easiest to bring back. They would visit from time to time to see the angels and let them know of the new god. Jack would explain his expectations and under what circumstances he would intervene. He planned to intervene very rarely. Jack wanted to place trust upon each world and their inhabitants. They get to choose how they run the world. Unless he got prayers for drastic change from 90% of inhabitants he wasn’t planning on enforcing specific plans. He would lay out the general guidelines he expected and then leave. Every once in a while he would visit the actual world, seeing the inhabitants to ensure that they are happy and had free will the way they were meant to.
I can’t believe that I finished this story! This had been a small idea in the back of my mind for a while and I’ve loved being able to expand on it. Thank you so much to everyone who has taken the time to read it! I hope you’ve all enjoyed the ride.

Jack just restored earth. Sure it was just this one, but that was because this was the earth he had spent the most time on. He knew there was much more to bring back, but it wasn’t as simple. Here he could remember and understand what the world was like and how it should be. Chuck didn’t make the other worlds the same. They were different and would require more time.  Jack wanted to gain the right understanding. He didn’t want to mess up restoring all the lost worlds, all the lost souls, all the lost life. He wanted to make sure each world, earth was going to be alright without him constantly holding the reins. He wanted every soul to have their own choice and destiny. In order to do this he would need to take more time. That’s alright, he had plenty of time. This earth was fine, this world didn’t need him. The same couldn’t be said for the hundreds and thousands of other worlds, so for now he bid Sam and Dean fair well and went off to start the great revival, to start his job as the new god.
“Why are you reviving other worlds? Didn’t Chuck do that to make the perfect one? Wouldn’t it be better to focus on just the one?” Cas tilts his head in confusion. There is no need to have multiple worlds now that Jack was god. It just didn’t make sense.

“It was the only way to stop Billie”
What do you think Sam is calling Dean for?
As always, I hope you enjoyed the chapter. I also love to hear what you all think of the story or if there is anything you would like to see!
Jack placed the empty cup down in front of him. “Somethings wrong,” Jack started looking up at Cas and Dean. “I can’t see or feel the newest world I revived.” Jack rubbed his temples trying to ease the frustration that was starting to build up again. “I can feel that I did bring the world back, I feel the presence of the souls of that world…. I just can’t see them or hear them. It’s like there is a wall or a dome around that world and only that world.”

I have rewritten this chapter and the next chapter so many times now but I think I finally have the general idea that I wanted. That being said, I apologize if it seems incoherent or if there are lots of errors. If things don't make sense please let me know!
Monica is back! Dean's little girl is back in his arms! But Cas isn't.... How long will it take to get his Cas back? What happened to our favorite angel? Is Gabriel back for good?
I hope you enjoyed the chapter!
Hopefully there aren't too many mistakes/errors. As always, I hope you enjoyed the chapter!
“I gave him a few days to think it over, then if he chooses he can come through a portal that will lead him directly to the cabin. I thought it was the best way to make it entirely his choice”
“The way I left, it was so abrupt and I didn’t give you a chance to know what was happening. I never thought I’d make it out of the empty again. I never thought I’d see you again.”
As always I hope you enjoyed the chapter!
“Do you think he’ll come?” Dean asked quietly. “Is he even hunting anymore?”
I hope you enjoyed the chapter!
“No, I was actually staying with Jack. You should join, Jack wouldn’t mind.”
Jack looks down, slightly embarrassed. It was one thing he had wanted to do but had been too scared to ask Dean since Dean had got here.
I know, I know. I made Sam a little oblivious. Don't worry, he'll figure it out soon.
“I’m glad he’s happy. He deserves to be happy. To have his own family.”
Dean nodded, understanding where the kid was coming from. “What about you? Are you going to be alright?”

Dean laughs, “You want to drive Baby?”
Sorry for any mistakes and as always, I hope you enjoyed the chapter!

“No Dean, we need to know a location to open a portal. Angels can’t dimension hop. I guess Jack can but he’d also need to know the location or he can get lost in the vast networks between all the worlds. Jack is still new to this and it’s too early for him to experiment with dimension hopping.” Cas explains. “We need to research, look through old scriptures written by Chuck to see if this has happened before.”
Jack frowned. “Yeah why?”
Something is going on with heaven and the angels... is this the thing that was causing Jack's seizures?
“Of course kid, let’s go. We could all use a drive to take our mind off things.”

Sorry the chapter is a bit shorter than the last few, I hope you all still enjoy it!
Sighing with relief jack starts listing his tasks, “Well, first I want to make sure this heaven is functioning smoothly. Too many souls were prisoners. We need to fix the system. Set up checks to make sure it won’t dismantle if I’m in other worlds. You will be the one in charge to ensure all the angels are on board and are progressing through the change.”

“What exactly are you two talking about?” Dean asks as he drops another book into the done pile. “Are you guys keeping secrets again? You know this never ends well for us!”
“It’s the only option I can think of. And we need to try it before you completely lose control or drain all your power to this unknown.” Cas responds.
So any theories? What's going on between Cas and Gabe?
“I’m still drained, but I don’t want to sit around the cabin waiting. Can we…” Jack looked longingly at Dean.
“Where have you been staying? With the angels?”
Disclaimer: I don't own Supernatural or any of the characters in the show.
“You should go visit him. I’m sure he’d like to see you!” Jack encouraged. “He didn’t call for me to save him so I’d assume he was ready to come here.”
A little visit from Crowley! What do you think? As always I hope you enjoyed the chapter and let me know if you have any comments/critiques!
“Hey Kid!”
I hope you all enjoyed the chapter!
I wasn't sure where to end the last chapter and start this one so I just put them both up at once. Hope you all like the story so far! Anyone have any suggestions?
I apologize for any grammatical errors. I am trying my best to catch them all but probably will miss things.

Another chapter has been posted! Will things with Sam go well? According to history- probably not. What do you think?
“Yes, he’s my friend too Dean”
Disclaimer: I don't own supernatural or the characters from the show.
Cas took that as his cue and reached out to Dean. The moment his fingers touched Dean’s shoulder he could feel everything. Cas immediately felt everything that Dean wanted to express but didn’t know how. All the pain, worry, regret along with the relief, excitement and happiness now that they were reunited. The grief he had felt on earth, the current fear that this moment wasn’t real. The need to be together. Everything.
As always, I hope you all enjoyed the chapter!

So they finally know Jack's secret... How do you think Gabriel will handle it?
Dean looks between Cas and Jack, his lips pursed. It’s clear that they both were stretching themselves thin trying to figure out what had happened to the other world. He himself wasn’t getting anywhere with his research. Seeing Sam honestly sounded like a great option. “Why don’t you ask him? Tell him the jist,” Dean waves his hands making random gestures, “ how you will have to change his memories and stuff. Then if he’s still interested he can come.”
“We haven’t found anything and this is the only way I can try to check in!” Jack cried. The pain was beginning to grow as the throbbing continued. “I can’t stop or else I’ll lose the balance between light and darkness. You’re right I am losing control but I don’t know how. No one else can handle this power to even split or share it. What can I do other than keep trying Cas?”

One more chapter left everyone!
Disclaimer: I don't own Supernatural or the characters in the show.
** Just to clarify **
Also I have been trying to keep this other world's backstory pretty vague, is anyone interested in what happened there?
The two of them drive over to Jack’s cabin. Jack was thrilled to have Dean staying with him. It was starting to feel like old times. Everyone missed Sam, but life continued. Jack would share his drafts of the worlds with Cas and Dean. When Jack and Cas would visit the other worlds, Dean would go out to visit his old friends, the other hunters and his parents. In the end, the three of them would always end up together in the little cabin. Some days they would play games, making Jack feel like a child. Other days they would sit down and watch the popular shows and movies from earth. They would work hard but also make sure to take some time to relax and have fun. This was heaven after all, if they weren’t happy here then they never would be.

So what do you all think?
“While we do that I’ll try to harness my new power. Start with the completely destroyed worlds with no human life and bring back the plants, and animals that had survived.” Taking a short pause Jack looks to Cas, “Please stay with me, or at least check in on me from time to time. I don’t like being alone. I don’t want to end up like chuck”
“Jack?” Dean asks once more, looking concerned again.

Sorry for the delay! I was helping my parent's move and it was a busy week.

Cas nods making his own mental list of the things he’d change and which of his brothers and sisters to entrust the changes with. Which ones to set as the new management.
So Jack began, starting with his trip with Sam. How they failed. How everyone disappeared, everyone except the brothers and himself. How Lucifer and Michael arrived, the plan they made to defeat god. And finally how he himself had taken on the mantle now.
So we are finally getting close to that vision Junior had way back when he was in heaven. What do you all think?
Dean spun around at that, “What?”

Cas gives Jack a knowing look. Jack accepts defeat and turns back to Dean, “I think we need to bring Sam here. He is the only hunter who has experience with spells. He may be able to create a spell to get us to the other world.”

Also does anyone have any suggestions for shows I should watch?
After the line break:
“So what’s the plan? Are we making a trip to this ‘other world’? Just hop on over, kick down a wall and hop back?” Dean asks.
I'm back!! Sorry folks, I was out of town last weekend and I didn't have my laptop with me. Now I am back and the new chapter is up.
“He’s happy Dean. It took him some time but you left him a great group of people to go to. He stayed with Donna for a while, helping her with some cases. Then he moved in with Eileen. They started their own family.”
Another little sneak peak at this Dean's past. I like sprinkling these in every one in a while. Is there anything else you'd like to see/learn about his past?
“No, it feels fine now, if anything it is trying to help me find the world. It senses the frustration within me and wants to ease the pain, find the balance. A balance that can be achieved once the walls are down from the other world.”
I'm working on making some of the future chapters a little longer, but for now what do you all think?
Hopefully others will read the story and give me advice as I navigate through this!
Dean stares at Jack, “What!?”
“I really don’t want to do that” Jack's voice barely mumbling. “I don’t want to do that to you, to Dean. To Sam.” He sighs. “You know he has a kid now? His own new family. I don’t want to ruin that…”
Cas and Dean are finally reunited! YAY! I've given Dean enough grief. It's time for those two to have some happiness Right? .... Maybe, maybe not... we'll see...
Cas hugs Jack one more time. “I’m not leaving you. Let’s get started.”

Cas’s eyes sparkled with comprehension. Jack needs to bring back the other worlds. When Jack had obtained this power, all the souls, burdens and memories came along with it. Poor Jack had gone through so much in his short time alive. Despite it all he was still trying to do the right thing by everyone. The task has gotten more difficult now that he is god. He had to help Jack. The Winchesters would be fine. Right now Jack, his son, needed guidance and assistance. He couldn’t leave Jack alone. Heaven may not be his home anymore but if Jack is making it his, he would do everything to make sure Jack didn’t lose control of everything as Chuck had. “Of course I’ll help Jack. What do you need me to do?”
“Kid!”
As always, I hope you all enjoyed the chapter!
Poor Sam, can't seem to escape the life no matter how hard he tries. Now he blames his brother for both their father's death and Amelia. Of course perspective is everything, from Dean's point of view he was doing what he had to do in order to protect his little brother. Sam... Sam may have had a different view of everything since he still was under the impression that his brother left him on purpose.
Cas turned and looked up as he felt a hand in his shoulder, “Go, visit him.” Jack softly urged once more. “He’s calling you, he wants to see you.”
“So how did you end up on the road? You were shaking. It looked like you were having a seizure!” Dean exclaimed, still confused about how everything was connected.

“Hello Dean”
Dean grips Cas’s trench coat tightly, scared that Cas might disappear, “Good. I don’t know where to go if you and Sam aren’t with me.”

Dean looked around, everything was bright, and peaceful. Nothing like hell or purgatory. “I guess I made it into heaven after all” he mumbled to himself. That’s when he heard Bobby. The two sat down and chatted for a while.
As always, I hope you enjoyed the chapter!
Cas shrugged, “You never asked. And there was nothing to worry about.”

Hello friends! Sorry for the late update, things kinda got away from me for a while. Hopefully this slightly longer chapter makes up for it? I feel like I should have split this into two different ones maybe? Oh well, it's all out for you now. :)
Disclaimer: I don't own the show or the characters of Supernatural.
Another small tidbit of Dean's past. I'm trying to drop in a few memories here and there. Also, how will the plan Dean made to get Moni out  of hell work? Will Sam agree or will everything go awry?
“I just mean that- ya know that uh- that we fight for eachother, all of us, to make sure we’ve got eachothers backs.” Dean was fumbling over his words, he was 1000 percent sure he was red as a god damned tomato, and his anxious stutters did him no favors. It was so stupid how one song got him into this god damn predicament.
he took another drink. His tolerance was nowhere near enough to handle the onslaught of emotions that had washed over him, urging him to make his way down to the storage room.
As Dean rounded the corner he had nearly crashed full force into Cas who had been listening in the entire time. Sam, who wasn’t far behind Dean, quickly stopped short when he saw the angel. “Cas- you know I didn’t-“ Dean had stumbled over his words as Cas took a slow step back.
“What?”
“Remind me this is real one more time” Dean whispered, still holding Cas in a tight embrace. He sounded vulnerable, something he would very rarely show again.
“Seriously Dean? You really think everythings normal? Trust me I have gotten used to your and Cas’s little fights believe me I have. But this? This has lasted way too long.” Sam took a breath to gage Dean’s reaction who seemed to have just been shrugging off the statement.Sam shook his head, his hand rubbing the bridge of his nose. “I know Cas scared us, but we got him back, he’s okay! Are you really still offended that he sacrificed himself for you?”
Now Dean was a man of great taste, which was why in his deep deep shame he was now hiding away so he could look at the lyrics, and analyze this shit in peace. As he read through the lines, he couldn’t help but feel as though it resonated much more it should’ve as he mind jumped to every moment in which Dean lost Cas in some time or another. Or the times Cas would lose him. It was never permanent, but in those last moments when uncertainty was all they knew, Dean always felt an unmistakable urge to hold tight onto the angel in their last moments, and never let go. Not in a gay way though,, no, no Dean didn’t swing that way.
“It’s okay if you still think it applies to you Dean, it’s a very natural response especially if you’re really engaged in the process.” Castiel was teasing him now, which only caused Dean to grow more red.
“Nothin Jack, Cas was actually just leaving.” Dean muttered moving to close the laptop but Jack was too quick as a slow smile crept across his face.
As Dean stopped the car, he took a second before actually stepping out, he watched Cas in awe as the angel seemed to struggle to find the strength to stand. And once he did he was making no effort to move towards Dean. Dean broke the silence when he slammed the door shut.
No. No no it couldn’t be. Could it?
I’m gonna try and post every Friday, but for now here’s chapter 2!!
“Yeah no of course not,” his voice was gruff, yet understanding. “Cas I’ve been thinking a lot about that night. In fact I don’t think I’ve been able to stop thinking about that night, and I want you to know I have never openly considered to be into- uh other dudes” he cleared his throat daring to look at Cas, who was now staring at him with such an intensity that only muddied Dean’s mind more. “I always knew we had a connection, different then mine and Sammy’s, different then I have had with anyone else. I didn’t know what it was until you- until that

“No I think you could’ve, because unlike you everyone else in the world decides to introduce themselves with a real name, and they don’t make up their entire past or they-“
She signed to Sam, who was quick to sign back-
“Maybe.” Cas said with a shrug as he gently ran his knuckle down the back of Crowley the duck, who didn’t seem as  opposed to Cas like he did Dean. “The name kind of fit him though, he’s a bit of a trouble maker, but I found him quite  literally lounging in my living room so I figured he could stay.” Dean was smiling now, he couldn’t help it, for a second things almost felt normal, with the exception of the break in ducks of course.
So Dean just smiled. Bringing the beer bottle up to his lips, and drinking in the feeling of purely being okay.
When Dean opened his eyes he was surrounded by the warm comfort of nostalgia, but nothing he could quite put his finger on, no one distinct memory, but rather nostalgia for a feeling he always longed to have. The air was brisk, the breeze soft and cool, and the smell of sweet summer mornings seemed to fill the air. It was beautiful, peaceful, and he had made it.
“I’ve always wanted you. It’s always been you.” Dean felt his voice waver, but pressed on. “You were the first person that really saw who I was, you were the first person I cared about who wasn’t my blood relative, you were the first confusing ass bundle of feelings that I was afraid to unpack. And I have missed you so goddamn much I haven’t been able to comprehend it.”
Cas’s breath hitched. He looked completely in shock, and Dean took his moment of bravery to do what he should’ve done years ago. He pressed his hand against the angels jaw, and in one swift motion pressed his lips into the others. Cas’s eyes widened, but soon fell shut as he melted into the feeling, his hand pressed up against Dean’s while the other rested on his waist, as if they had done this a thousand times. Everything felt right, and while both understood none of this would have been possible on earth, they also recognized this was heaven, it was okay to let go.
They saved the day, the vamps were dead, but something was terribly wrong. Pain shot through Deans stomach and abdomen, making it difficult to remain upright. Something had pierced into his lower back, and god Sammy looked so scared. Minutes felt like hours as the younger brother held him, trembling, and unable to keep himself composed. Of course Dean understood, he held onto his brother best he could and reminded him just how proud of a big brother he was. It wasn’t long until Dean was slipping, his vision growing dark and fuzzy, and with those simple words he allowed himself to drift off.
“Cas, it never mattered.” Any filter Dean had previously was gone, his voice sounded raw as he took a step closer to the angel. “If you didn’t look like this I can’t promise I wouldn’t have realized years ago, but either way it would’ve been you, it’s always been you. I have never
They were interrupted by a loud clap of thunder. Dean recalls the sky being a somewhat dreary sight on his drive up, but now it was much much darker. He was so enthralled with the task at hand that neither of them noticed that the sky had turned a dark grey, and the winds that had started to pick up. A single heavy drop fell onto Dean’s hand, then there were two, then three, and before Cas could open his mouth the boys were caught in a downpour. For the first time since Dean arrived, Cas was laughing, seriously laughing! Dean was laughing too, though something told him Cas was much more enthusiastic.
“Complete honesty?”
“Uh- go uh- go ask Sam.” Was all a flushed Dean could get out through stutters, to which Jack just shrugged and left the room leaving the boys alone. Cas opened his mouth to say something but Dean held his hand up to stop him. “Dont.” He muttered which caused Castiel to crack a very small smile.
It was quiet for a moment. The silence of the room allowed for Cas to be with Dean, and hold him until the world eventually ended. The stillness of the room almost allowed for Cas to forget, after all this couldn’t be real, nothing about this moment was real. Then he heard it, the soft buzzing of deans phone, oh.
The questions continue, and Cas finally starts to understand who Dean really is.
Everything had managed to work out just as it was meant to. Cas was back, and alive grace and everything. Jack, the optiminent, popped in and out for Bible sesh’s and beer nights. Sam had Eileen, who despite how classy the two may seem, were definitely not so reserved at night, to Deans despair. Yes everything was just as it was supposed to be. laughing and talking, the four, and occasional five (six if you counted miracle) reveling in the defeat of Chuck, and the start of a new world.
And with that Dean had kissed him again. The world seemed to melt away after that. Dean’s hands had found their way into Cas’s hair, and Cas who, while had grown and learned a lot over the past years, still struggled with managing self control as he pressed closer to Dean.
“Okay” was all he said, and with that the conversation was dropped.
“No, no I get it now.” Cas muttered “I needed to say it aloud but I understand.” He took a deep breath and moved away from the desk. “It’s a sensation I’m sure we both know very well, the feeling of sacrifice for those who you care for.” Cas was now looking at Dean with almost a softness to him, and it was causing Dean to get a bit fidgety. “To clarify, it’s like when you were going to give up your life to defeat Amara, or even when you were going to allow yourself to be trapped away forever with Michael because you knew at the end of the day it would protect those who are important.” He took a deep breath. “I believe It’s about one who would do anything for the person he loves.” The angel added under his breathe
“I have to- we have to go. We can’t stay here. I should save him, I can save him.” The words seemed to rush out of Cas in a low panicked manner. However Jack was quick to put a hand on his chest stopping all movement that had tore through the angel.
“Cas— he loves you. Romantically?” Sam was asking a lot of questions and it stopped being amusing a long time ago.
“Dean? You know-you know I miss them too, but they would want us to live out our lives. They would want us to-to thrive in the life we fought for.” Sam’s voice seemed to pierce his subconscious spiral, but he was right. Sam always was the smarter of the two. Rather than respond Dean simply nodded, and lifted the glass to his lips. He doesn’t remember when he switched from beer to whisky.
“I’ve really lost it huh.” Dean's mouth felt dry as he slowly looked up to see
“Shut up.” Dean was quick to cut him off. “I am so- mad at you, Cas. I can’t describe how angry I was- am, at what you did, how you left. You know I don’t do grand goodbyes, I
“What is that?” Dean asked, probably a little more blunt then was completely necessary, but the kid didn’t seem to mind.
“Yeah well, shut up” was all he managed, because right now Dean didn’t care about clever comebacks. He had Cas back, and that’s all that mattered.
Sam was here, but Dean was holding him back from the life he deserved, a life he always should have lived. Castiel was gone, dead, murdered. Then the kid, Jack, was living his destiny. But despite winning a literal war against god, the feeling of pure abandonment and guilt had never gone away.
Jack, and Sam had managed to get to the bunker in record time. There being no one on the road probably helped in that, but it didn’t make things any easier when the younger brother burst through the door. “Dean? Cas?” Sam called out, and the angel appeared from the corridor looking as though he had lost 20 years of his life. “Cas- Cas what’s wrong where’s Dean?” Sam looked terrified, the sight of Cas wasn’t helping, and Jack stood silent behind Sam. When Cas didn’t say anything, but rather glanced at the table where he had placed Dean, Sam nearly buckled to the floor.
“But Sam he’ll be alone, I-“ Castiel was beginning to panic again but Jack was quick to cut him off.
With Dean by himself he has nothing to do but finally face himself.
“Fine. Fine, right before Cas died, and went to the empty- he said he loved me.” Dean was sure he was mumbling, but Sam’s look of complete bafflement proved he was heard loud and clear.
“No no no please. Please Dean.” Cas moved his arms down, and before he could process what he was thinking he had managed to lift his upper half and hold him to his chest. All those nights of Cas wondering what it would be like to hold Dean, never once did he imagine anything as horrific as this. The angel's hands held tightly onto the lifeless body, his nose and cheek pressed firm into the top of his head. “Please, please I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry” he whispered rocking gently as though it would lure the other back to life.
That is if you are fucking real.” Deans spat out each word as if they caused him physical pain.
“If this is going to work you gotta answer honestly.” Dean sighed with a shrug, crossing his arms over his chest. Another moment passes and Cas shakes his head. He turned his back to Dean and suddenly let out an exasperated yell. Crowley the duck also let out a shriek purely to be a nuisance. Cas whips his head back around and looked the other in the eye.
“Hey let’s take it easy alright? You don’t gotta fix all this shit, not right now, and I know you’re probably doing it so you don’t have to worry about the bigger fish to fry, but speaking from experience I can promise long run? That don't work out too well.” The more Dean spoke the angrier Cas seemed to get. I mean sure he had every reason to be, but also Dean knew he could fix it. “Look maybe you don’t wanna kill Michael off yet, but I would like you to meet Dean? I uh I brought my passport.” Cas seemed to perk up at this.
“It’s about… premature ejaculation?” Jack looked confused as he continued to read on. Cas was also processing, he understood the term better than Jack, but putting it in the context of the song was difficult. That plus making the connection he was making with Dean earlier- oh. Oh wow.
“I think I’m struggling to understand where that came from” he muttered, a little breathlessly, which Dean had found unapologetically adorable.
“Dean,  let’s- let’s get you to bed.”
The more Cas spoke, the warmer it seemed to get. Of course the Angel knew how to put it into words, man can’t understand certain idioms, but he sure had his way with analysis.
“Dude, this thing you have between you and Cas? Whatever it is, figure it out. I could chop the first few weeks up to post god killing trauma, but c’mon, it’s Cas.” Sam had pulled Dean aside from what was supposed to be a casual pizza and beer night. Sam looked down at Dean, all condescending and knowing-like, Dean rolled his eyes.
“I can hear you in there! At least I think it’s you, I don’t know I’ve never heard you make that sound before, but uh can you please let me in maybe? Or open the door? It would be pretty sad to drive 20 something hours to only get eaten alive.” Dean sounded a bit more desperate now, he had been talking for a few minutes and he wasn’t getting much back, but what can you expect when your husband thinks everything he knows about you is a lie? “Seriously, Cas please, you got me begging and you know I hate that shit. Can you please open the door, I really need to talk-“ he was cut off by the sound of the door swinging open, Dean nearly falls but keeps himself up when he sees his husband all scruffy faced and disheveled standing directly in front of him.
You gotta understand I couldn’t just- I couldn’t just tell you everything-“ Cas was quick to cut Dean off.
“Cas, I know the last thing I deserve is your forgiveness, but I really want to explain myself, I really want you to get to know me.
“I didn’t mean for you to hear that Cas. You weren’t supposed to hear my little freak out, and you certainly weren’t supposed to hear the first things I’ve said of substance in weeks, to Sam, when I really should’ve been talking to you.” Deans words stung, why did they hurt so bad? Cas had felt pain, torture, both physical and mental. Dean’s rejection speech was not something monumental, but god did it feel like it was.
As Jack plunked in the question, and hit search, a few weblinks popped up, in which Jack clicked on the first one. Dean’s eyes scanned the first few lines, and immediately his eyes grew wide. His blood felt very hot, and suddenly he found his mouth to be full of cotton.
“Aw now tell me you didn’t forget! These aren’t just 36 questions, these are the-“
“Fine, but only because I know my consciousness will keep me awake if you get eaten alive.” Cas held the door open and Dean slipped in. The cabin was big but definitely run down. It was old, as it had gone untouched for far too many years,  off the beaten path yet still owned by the Novak’s Dean was surprised it was just a duck who had taken residence.
“Uh, yeah, I guess that makes sense.” Dean didn’t like how this was affecting him so much. Music always had a deeper connection to Dean ever since he was forced to grow up on the road. It was almost as if the consistency of a good song was the only real grounder in his life, and now he was getting caught up in a few lyrics in a stupid pop punk song.
Time had stopped feeling real. Days turned into months, which turned into years. There was no way to tell how much time had truly passed, but in the empty it didn’t matter. His wings were gone, taken away a while ago, the voices of torment only grew louder as new voices, voices of the innocents he’s failed reminded him how much he deserved this. He longed to hear Dean, something to remind him he’s alive, even if he was screaming at Cas, attacking him for every wrong thing he had ever done, reminding him how much of a failure he was, at least he would get to hear his voice. But Dean never came.
“It’s your fault. IT'S YOUR FAULT” the voice echoed through his head and Cas winced at the sound.
“Yeah uh, it is.” Cas gestured to him to keep going. “I mean not much has changed, but being completely honest, no shits and giggles, I have learned that you gotta live every day as if it was the perfect day.” Cas’s face had softened. “I know that’s the cheesiest thing I’ve ever said, but uh you never know what the day could bring, and tomorrow always has the possibility of being better than today.” Cas looked like he was about to take Dean's hand, but like the impeccable timing they had, both boys jumped when a large crash came from outside. The rain was coming down harder, and now the trees appeared to be toppling over as well. “Jesus Christ.” Dean muttered under his breath. “Uh here you go so I can focus on that and not the fear that my car could be crushed at any minute.”
