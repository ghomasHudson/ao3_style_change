Obviously unable to reply, Castiel waits for Michael to pull back his next punch. In the slightest, split-second of an opening, he drives his knee upward, lodging it into Michael’s gut. The angel lets out a surprised noise, distracted enough for Castiel to get out from underneath him. His suit is torn, he’s covered in dust, and he can feel blood dripping down his hot skin, getting tacky in the collar of his shirt. Standing to the side, mildly horrified at the crater Michael pummeled him into, Castiel does a quick check for Dean.
"Don't ever feel like you can't ask me for something," he replies. The raw honesty of those words nearly shocks him. "You've gone too long without being… cared for."
Fifteen minutes later, John leaves the room, looking like a dead man on his feet. Dean stands up, coaxes Sam into climbing onto his back, then approaches his dad to take the car keys out of his pocket. Without saying a word the three of them leave the hospital, a heavy cloud hanging over them all. Sam goes into the backseat, falling asleep again. John sits in the passenger seat without complaint, not even bringing up the fact that Dean doesn’t have his learner’s permit.
“This is my boss-” Dean says, immediately regretting it. He snaps his head up just in time to see Castiel opening his door so he can join the festivities.
"It's OK not to know how to feel," Castiel says diplomatically. "Sooner or later your two lives were going to intersect. I'm glad this was a tame reunion."
Castiel squints at the screensaver dancing on his monitor as he tries to place why that name sounds so familiar. Planting his elbows on the desk, his free hand cradles his head as he instead stares at the grainy wood of the surface, letting out an ill-concealed agitated sigh. “And?”
“Ah,” she perks up a little, patting Castiel’s knee. “Things’ll be taken care of, now! If the boys are willing to testify John could go away for a long time. Dean’s old enough to take care of himself, and Sam’s got an aunt and uncle that live in town.”
Dean bites his lip, his posture still tense. “He hasn’t done anything to make me think otherwise. He-” Finally, he makes eye contact. “He treats me like an adult, Cas. He asks my opinion on things, cares about what I gotta say. His lifestyle is kinda stuffy and fancy but he makes it fun.” He swallows, then clears his throat and says, “We haven’t even had sex.”
"Usually my friend Benny joins me, but he had just called me to cancel. He said that I should perhaps branch out of my “comfort zone”, as he called it, and try something new. You were the first person I saw."
“‘Cause that’s easy for you to understand,” Dean says, leaning back against his chair. “Doesn’t make it true. I’m just tryna have your conversation.”
Quietly, Dean noses into Castiel's chest hair. He knows he sneaks a whiff, but he won't dare make fun of him for it. "What can I do in return?"
He and Daphne have been together since high school. With her things just… clicked. Of all the rules and order his parents established for him, Daphne bent them - hell, broke them sometimes - and still managed to stay in his parents’ good favor. Something about her is magical, whimsical, yet sensible and grounded. She’s been perfect for Castiel, helping him open up and branch out and become comfortable with his true self. Over the years as they’ve been together and learned more about one another, they’ve held on and only have fallen more and more in love. Oh, they have their differences.
“Yes,” Castiel sets the tongs down a little too aggressively on the counter. “He’s my ward, but I’m not his father. He’s an adult. He can make his own choices- see who he wants to see, do whatever he wants to do. I have no place to lecture him on his choices.”
Sucking his lips between his teeth, Dean looks like he’s about to cry. “Y-you uh- you struck out there, buddy?” His lips tremble and quiver with the threat of laughter.
“Yeah?” Dean perks. He sits up a little, looking across the table at Sam, who can hear Castiel without the speaker on because Dean’s shitty phone has the reverb of a tin can. Sam’s got a smirk on his face.
“We live together. We moved in together before we even fully knew each other. We’re bound to cross the line sometimes. That’s another thing I won’t hold against you. Something I
“Things will fall into place once we all get out of here,” Sam says, though his voice is warm. “You and Dean will be fi-”
. She had marched right up Castiel’s front steps when he wasn’t home, knocked, and then told his parents directly that she was in love with their son and planned on marrying him. The bold declaration had thrown them off a bit, but like everyone else in the world, his parents fell for Daphne’s charisma and charm. She’d been welcomed into the family. They married at twenty, lived in Castiel’s parent’s basement until he graduated university, and then moved in together at twenty-five.
Castiel heads to the makeshift locker next to the office. It’s empty, the only other dancer on stage at this time of night Lisa. Her and Dean’s gym bags are on the same shelf. Idly, Castiel thinks he should get real lockers here if he’s going to continue on with the dancers. Grabbing Dean’s duffel, Castiel makes his way back through the bar silently, fully aware of the dark cloud over his head.
“He’s very at peace, y’know,” she says with a soft smile. She sets the glasses down to take Dean’s hands in hers, leveling his gaze. “Castiel has spent so much time alone. I think maybe he could use some company today.”
. Hooting and hollering and cheering and clapping. Dean’s cage looks like one of those tornado money machines as the lights to the rest of the bar return to normal, the DJ announcing “Whaddya think of our newest addition to the Cage Crew?”, the crowd responding with overwhelming positivity.
Dean slips out of the house when Castiel isn’t home. He runs the bar at night but he goes in during the day, too, to lend an extra hand or catch up on paperwork. He’s kind of a workaholic, actually, but Dean can’t really blame him. Nothing worse than sitting in a home, alone with the ghosts.
“So the existence of antimatter sorta makes the particle accelerator theory against ghosts, in this case, moot. Because even with your fancy thermodynamics sayin’ that ghosts cancel themselves out by being cold instead of hot, the fact of the matter remains: ghosts are made of energy and are the antithesis of matter, a.k.a. antimatter.”
This time, when Castiel reaches his hand out, he doesn’t stop himself. Dean reaches across the table almost shyly, their hands connecting, fingers slotting together. His hand are fucking huge compared to Dean’s, strong and worn from all the hard work he applies to every aspect of his life. It feels right to hold each other like this, even this small point of contact. He believes that Castiel means nothing has to change now. Dean’s not really sure he’s ready to break the bubble they’ve encased themselves in. But knowing that’s on the other side… what’s waiting for him when he’s finally comfortable enough to let it- that’s the thrill.
a question,” Dean says earnestly. Castiel peeks through his fingers to see honesty and determination shining in Dean’s eyes. “Do you believe me? And all the stuff I’ve told you?”
“Well,” she looks thoughtful for a moment. “They’ve lived in that house for… oh, shoot. Twenty years? I’ve been their neighbor for ten. The missus passed away about five years ago.” She frowns and clucks her tongue. “Ol’ John went for the drink, you know. I did my best to help out the boys when I could, but there was never any proof of what was happening. John’d yell, I’d think about callin’ the cops, then everything’d be quiet and I’d tell myself to keep an ear out the next day. Dean never came around whenever he had a shiner.”
let them in, ok? It’ll be the God squad trying to bring you back. I had a visit from Michael just now that I almost didn’t get out of.”
“Bye,” Dean and Sam chorus. They start walking away from the field together, Dean slinging his bag over his shoulder.
in a bar you must be twenty-one." He brings up his other hand to rub at his other temple. "You weren't even officially hired. I apprenticed you, more or less. Worked you without documents. With no paperwork, when the law finds out that I had an eighteen year old dancing in my club-"
In a blink, the man is gone. Castiel whips his head around the alley so quickly it tweaks his neck and he winces, rolling his shoulders. He looks down at his coffee and muffins, surprised to see them unsullied, and then lets out a shaky sigh. What on earth just happened?
He comes back to himself. He’s on his knees, sobbing, Dr. Barne’s hands on his shoulders as she keeps him from completely falling over. He’s clutching to the hem of her scrubs, nearly howling in his grief, his voice shattering and cracking. His entire face is wet. His body is hot. He feels faint. There’s no way this is real, there’s no way his wife and his son are-
“Yes,” Castiel says, returning his glasses to his nose. He frowns. “They’re… fuzzy around the edges. Like they’re moving, or buzzing.”
on Sam’s face. The smile that Dean helped coax back. Turns out that Bobby and Ellen only live a few miles away from Castiel, so Dean invites the brat to bicycle over any time he wants to visit. Their goodbye hug is sort of awkward, because it’s not really goodbye, but Dean holds him a little tighter anyway. Bobby and Ellen just raise their eyebrows when Dean says he’s moving in with someone, but other than that stay mercifully quiet on the subject.
Castiel squints, turning his head. Sam and Dean are seated in metal folding chairs at a card table, laptops and books in front of them. The warehouse is maybe five hundred square feet; a glorified storage unit, really. He’s on a couch, one of two, and there’s a mini fridge in the corner. “Where are we?”
Coughing, he sits up and finishes rubbing his eyes. Jennifer is gone. How long had he been asleep? As soon as he’s upright, the woman sits next to him. He doesn’t like that at all.
“Fuck.” He rubs his hands over his eyes. He has to get over this crush quick or he’ll sink. He’s more thankful to Castiel than he can even fathom and the guy is just so… frightfully earnest. If there’s a power imbalance it’s probably the power Dean holds over Castiel. He’s not an idiot. Castiel is looking for family, too.
Shrugging and failing at making it look natural, Dean picks up his sandwich again. “I guess. I don’t like the thought of…” He takes a huge bite to muffle his next words. “Disappointing you.”
Castiel gasps awake. His phone is ringing on his night stand. He picks it up, curling over his knees and putting his free hand into his hair. “What.”
John practically throws him up the porch steps. The screen door bangs open, the regular door being opened by a surprised Sam who quickly steps out of the way when he sees the warpath John is on. Sam throws Dean an apologetic glance; usually the kid covers for Dean if dad gets up before Dean gets home, but clearly something went wrong today. It’s not his fault. Dean hopes he’ll be alive later to tell him it’s alright.
“No,” Dean says reflexively. He buses some dishes, taking them to the sink. “Just some guy I used to know. Not really a fan. Can you take over his table for me?”
“Mm,” Castiel returns the carafe to the coffee maker and then rejoins Dean at the table. “It was an unfortunate accident a long time ago. I’m at peace with it now.”
They stay in the warehouse for a week while the world around them destabilizes. Sam and Dean have the place warded so well it could probably withstand an alien invasion. When the internet finally dies Sam says he has everything he needs, and Dean and Castiel believe him. Castiel’s grown fond of their presence, even if it is sometimes trifling, particularly Dean’s riffing. A bored Dean is a dangerous Dean, but when he’s bored there’s no more danger than that which lingers inside an annoyed Castiel.
Overwhelmed by a myriad of thoughts and emotions, Castiel takes a few deep breaths before reaching up and grabbing Sam’s wrists. He doesn’t know why, but that feels right. It grounds him.
Dean flies by the kitchen on his way to the front door, dressed in a pair of slacks and a button down. Castiel blinks at the blur his body makes, then sets down the butter knife he’d been using to cream cheese his toasted bagel.
“Too busy for it?” Dean queries. He leans forward again. “Or- hm. I bet you leave your dirty socks in the kitchen.”
“You ok?” Dean asks once he’s settled. His voice is gruffer than usual today, brows knit, and it could be perhaps because he didn’t sleep well, or it might even be an actual concern for Castiel.
Setting down his cocoa, Castiel walks around the island to stand next to Dean. He takes the mug out of the boy's white-knuckled grip, gingerly setting it on the counter and instead holding Dean's hands in his own.
“Why is it so difficult to find him?” Castiel wonders aloud. He moves towards the fridge, groaning in appreciation when he opens the door to see that Charlie had brought fresh groceries with her. Sometimes he thinks she knows him too well.
Lifting a hand to smack the man's forearm out of the air and away from him, Dean scowls. "Fine. Your customers are my johns at the end of the night and they pay me way better than you could."
“So, as you said, ghosts are pure energy, given the fact that they aren’t matter,” Dean says. Castiel is caught by the way his green eyes shine and dance. “So could we agree that ghosts might be a form of…
Castiel tries calling the number back, but an automated voice tells him that the number is no longer in service. Letting out a frustrated growl, he stands, tempted to trash everything on the table, but thinking better of it and instead turning on his heel, slamming his closed fists against the wall. Leaning forward he presses his forehead to the wall between his hands, trying to control his breathing. His eyes burn. His ears ache.
When Dean does, his eyes are so wet Castiel can see his reflection in the verdant depths, moisture clinging to his eyelashes. Dean rotates on the stool so he's facing Castiel, who holds their hands comfortingly between them.
Castiel reads up on things like wendigos and leviathans and rugarus and thinks… there’s probably a lot worse that can happen.
“Sure do,” Benny says, voice returning to a normal volume. “They’ll post Dean up, too. He won’t like it, he don’t like handouts, but they’re good people, and they’ll take care of him.” He puts his hat on his head, sending Castiel a small smile. “You let him stay over last night?”
did you think i would forget about charlie??? pls. the hottest queer joint in town, of COURSE she works there
“JOANNA BETH.” Ellen’s body jerks, a telltale sign that her toe connects with Jo’s shin, the girl yelping out in pain.
“No-” Benny suddenly shakes his head, fixing Castiel with a steady gaze. “This ain’t on you, brother. Ol’ John was bound and determined to go off the deep edge any day now. I know it feels like shit, Castiel, but you were there. And that actually made all the difference. Imagine if he’d gone alone? And John caught him like that?”
“The second you guys wanna split the bill let me know,” Dean says, pulling his notepad and pen from his apron with a grin to Ellen and Bobby. “I’ll make these two wash dishes in the back and y’all can enjoy an afternoon off.”
The area he’s led to has signs that indicate it’s the trauma and operation wing. There are people in chairs everywhere, with broken limbs or bleeding heads, generally miserable humans waiting to be seen for whatever trouble they’d managed to get into. He doesn’t see Daphne sitting in a chair, doesn’t hear her laugh or her “oh my God it’s not a big deal”. She’s not among the people waiting.
Dean was made to do this- to perform and appreciate himself while letting others appreciate him. Castiel’s best guess is that Dean’s closeted, or maybe even struggling with his identity. He’s seen it in enough people to recognize it.
Secondly, Friday means that Castiel’s puny, boring life gets injected with a dose of adrenaline. When he became an investigative journalist he thought he’d see more action; but the truth is, he’s responsible for taking down corrupt politicians, infiltrating the bad seeds in the police force, and exposing blackmail for the rich and privileged. Those actually aren’t very exciting, believe it or not. He’s never kicked down a door or aimed a gun at someone and told them to surrender.
“Why not?” Castiel asks, his voice soft from fear without his permission. “He’s been omitted from everything. He was never mentioned in the trial, hasn’t been mentioned since your case closed.”
He sees the swing before it happens. Today the boys are pissed and insulted, all their moves predictable. With his back to the lockers Dean takes them down, two at a time, swinging and kicking. He takes a few punches too, but these guys are bullies, not actually any sort of fighter. Dean’s wily and quick, using some wrestling moves to keep him on his toes as he takes them down. With one of the assholes left the gym coach finally comes into the locker room, drawn in by the sounds of yelling and lockers shuddering. He quickly moves to pull the boys off of Dean, yelling at them all to cool it and knock it off. He asks if Dean’s ok; fully aware that things look to be in his favor, Dean nods stiffly, reaching up to wipe his bloody nose.
Standing abruptly, Castiel curses and pulls his threadbare shirt away from his chest a few times, fanning himself with it. He’s biased. He’s obviously attracted to Dean, hell, he’s been
He’s a little paler than normal, but that’s because it’s almost winter and Kevin is much paler, his ivory skin only highlighted by his dark hair and eyes. Dean just always looks relatively tan thanks to his freckles. But Kevin put what he said is bronzer around the perimeter of Dean’s features, and he just looks… healthy, if a bit misshapen in a few different places. It’s nowhere near as detailed as some of the girls at school, but this is safe. Turning towards Kevin, Dean chews the good part of his lip.
The casual domesticity of their exchanges always manage to leave Castiel with that warm, expanding feeling in his chest. Dean is such a thoughtful, empathetic, kind young man, always ready to put others before himself--a trait Castiel knew he possessed very on in knowing him, especially upon learning what Dean has done in order to support his brother, but a trait that still sometimes catches him by surprise. There was a brief period of time when Castiel worried that Dean might suffer from codependency issues, given how he tends to latch onto people, but those worries were bypassed when they started falling into a better routine with one another. Dean is a natural caretaker. He’s not codependent. Castiel is fairly certain that if Dean were to be alone he would function perfectly fine; however, Dean is his best self when he’s able to shine with company.
“Dean,” Castiel’s hands rest on Dean’s shoulders, forcing their gazes to meet. Castiel’s eyes are warm, kind, his smile soft. He looks less like a tax accountant tonight, wearing nice jeans and a dark button-up. “You may leave at any time if you are uncomfortable.”
He bites all of those questions down. Buries them deep inside. One day, he might be able to ask those questions.
This isn’t really how Dean imagined this conversation to go. What did he expect? Flowers? A grand gesture? Holding a boombox on the front lawn? Honestly, this sort of… makes sense. For Castiel, at least. A grown man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and a guarded heart. And they aren’t any sort of conventional, anyway, what with the circumstances that brought them together and how they live currently. It feels fast and slow all at once.
Rubbing his temples, Castiel stands so he can be in front of the percolator when the light turns from red to green. “You’re saying it translates into a pre-biblical language?”
“Fuckin’ amazing,” Dean says with feeling. He very cautiously takes a sip of the coffee, then lifts his gaze to Castiel. “Whatcha makin’? Smells good.”
Standing up, Castiel swipes his sunglasses off of the table and puts them back on his face, turning his back towards Dean. “I have a friend,” he says, feeling marginally more calm now that he’s not facing the other man. He folds his arms tightly over his chest, uncaring of his unprofessional and closed off body language. His skull feels like it’s splitting open from the inside, his shoulders are stiff and achy, and he has to keep his eyes closed. Dean’s light is starting to fill the room. “She’s going to help me save you.”
“This morning’s incident had nothing to do with the club,” Castiel says. “As far as anyone knows, I was passing by and saw your father dragging you along and, as a Good Samaritan, called it in.”
He has this feeling of… nostalgia, deep within him, a pleasant acid reflux that creeps up his throat and spills dopamines into every crevice of his head.
He shuts the trunk with a slam. Dean doesn’t comment on it, but instead says, “You painted the living room.”
The hug isn’t unexpected, but it is surprisingly warm given the current temperature. Dean’s still in his threadbare pajamas and Castiel is wearing thermals from head to toe, and as Dean allows himself to snuggle into the older man’s embrace, he feels… safe. Safer than he’s ever felt before. He feels his eyes grow hot with tears of relief so he shuts them tight, squishing his cheek to Castiel’s chest.
Dean shrugs. “Enough to mojo yourself back to good health. You really gotta figure out how to use your grace on the battlefield, buddy.”
“Well- yeah, in a broad sweep. But the you, now? Your senses are just fine. Otherwise you wouldn’t have been able to find Dean.”
Sighing a little, Castiel takes a sip of the too-hot, too-watery coffee. “What do you think will happen now?”
Castiel’s jaw goes a little slack, his eyes widening. Dean’s never seen him look so shocked, so surprised, so…
A bit more expression leaks back into Dean’s features and posture, those spring greens bouncing all over Castiel’s face, before settling on his eyes. “Ok.”
Sometimes, Castiel is sure he could kill Dean. Add him to his list. Bury him six feet under. Dismember him limb by limb, digit by digit. Disembowel him while he watches, make him hold his own intestines in his hands while Castiel reads the encyclopedia out loud so he could, in all essence, bore him to death.
"I'm-" Dean points at himself. "I'm not your type?" He looks around the seedy establishment, watching the other dancers move around. They're all shapes and sizes and colors, some with belly scars and others with unwashed extensions. Some of them look absolutely coked out, others look totally disinterested in their task, and the overall atmosphere of the place just… reeks. And Dean - fit twink, pretty lips, and secret lover of ballet - isn't their "type". Makes sense. He’d be solely responsible for raising the class level of his joint. Still, though. This is the best this shitty city’s got.
“I’ve changed, Dean.” Michael squeezes his arms a little bit too tightly to be affectionate. “We both have.”
of anyone, let alone a man that can be as annoying as Dean Winchester, but his roommate does have a special place in the hole where his heart used to be. Maybe
He knows today is significant, for a lot of reasons. Maybe the wrong reasons, situational reasons, but… part of it also feels right.
“Benny,” Castiel breathes a sigh of relief at the sound of his best friend’s voice. “Care to come over for dinner?”
Dean throws his hands up. “I’m fucking nonbinary or whatever! Gender fluid, many pronouns, high heels on Wednesdays and car grease on Fridays. Jesus, you never
Everyone said something so easily, ranging from heavy to light. When all of their eyes settle on Castiel he feels himself fumbling and blushing, before blurting out, “Deleting dating apps.”
Exasperated, Castiel pulls away, wiping his brow with his towel. "Continue to deflect your feelings with humor, Dean. It's very healthy."
Jolting upright, Castiel’s heart leaps up into his throat, threatening to suffocate him. Looking around wildly, eyes wide and fingers gripping the cushions of the couch, he’s shocked to see no sign of Sam. No Sam, no graffiti on the floor- he pats around and then looks at the coffee table. No gun. No mixing bowl with strange, fragrant ingredients. Turning, he sees Charlie hedging into the living room looking entirely concerned and maybe even a little frightened.
His dreams intensify. It’s like a levee breaks one night, all sorts of memories gripping him. He dreams of leading some sort of crusade; he dreams of flying through hellfire, the sensation of appendages he didn’t even know he had charring and burning as flames lick across his celestial being. He dreams of gripping a man -
Sam bustles past Castiel. “God. He called because you’re here and you’re supposed to be dead. But he’s dead too. Then again, no one really
Dean allows a small smile. "I dunno, Mike. You have your pick of any dude with a real job and like, a 401k or whatever the fuck. I'm just a messed up kid."
,” Charlie interrupts, looking as though she’s enjoying her holier than thou moment, “and ask him where he is. If he doesn’t want you to meet him, he’ll let you know.”
He shrugs. “Not for myself, in any case. During the holiday season the restaurant has a seasonal menu and we do a luncheon for people experiencing homelessness, but I haven’t personally celebrated in nearly a decade.”
Swallowing to try and wet his dry throat, Castiel looks down at Sam, that vague familiar feeling cascading through him as he looks into those pretty hazel green eyes. This is familiar. Sam is familiar. This is safe. He… He has the same sensation with Sam as he does Dean.
Castiel’s gut swoops. He was literally just contemplating that yesterday, just wondering why he has no true images of his parents or any memories of anything before he started in college. And even his university memories are a jumbled flashback reel with no specific moments jumping out at him. It’s like the clearest memories he has are from the day…
He doesn’t know how much time passes before Castiel finally shifts them. He registers the ache in his lower body as the asphalt finally makes its presence known and then immediately feels bad. If it hurts him it’s most definitely hurting Castiel.
is award-winning and well known and Dean worked the same neighborhood in the slums but the men definitely came from all over. Holy shit. And this guy! Dean remembers him, now. Cocky, self-assured, God’s gift to man. A closeted dude married to some lady he complained endlessly about, even when balls deep. No wedding ring, but Dean knows his wife is a beard. No way would he leave her.
Dean shakes his head, smiling ruefully down at the table. “Nothin’ special. Just keep doin’ what I normally do.”
“Dean, this is- I’m-” Castiel stands as well, the pair of them fighting for words they can’t quite get out of their mouths. “I don’t want you to think I expect anything-”
Dean’s free shoulder shrugs. “Dozen? More? I dunno. Sometimes my dad puts me here, sometimes my mouth puts me here.”
“Oh?” John lets out a sarcastically curious noise. “He didn’t tell you, huh? Probably used one of his fake I.D.’s to get hired.”
"I didn't make any assumptions," Castiel says. He has a no nonsense way of speaking even when being kind. Dean… Dean likes that. "You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to. Your company for supper will be just as well."
Now a flush works its way over Castiel’s features, annoyance flashing through his veins. He stands abruptly, fumbling for his recorder and notepad. “I am not here for your entertainment, Mr. Winchester. I will not lose my standing in the journalism community to be some sort of last hurrah before you die.”
Dean rolls his eyes. He lifts a hand, wiggling his pinky in his ear. “Uh… yeah. Literally just said that.”
“Anyone who reads the news recognizes your name, brother,” Benny says placatingly. “You’re a damn good investigative journalist. They chose you for a reason.”
“But I’d at least have Daphne,” he replies. He finally takes a portion of salad, drizzling some balsamic vinegar over it and his baked potato.
Castiel can’t make it back to the prison until the following Friday. It’s been a little over a week since the first time he sat across from Dean Winchester, and he had toyed with the idea of it also being his last - but he’s
for how I treated you." He meets Dean's gaze again, blue eyes wet with honesty. "I'm so, so sorry, Dean."
On Mother’s day, he wakes her up with breakfast in bed. Scrambled egg whites, fruit, and toast; at this point in her pregnancy her palate has changed dramatically, Castiel sometimes forcing her to eat and being met with resistance that he takes in stride. Her mood swings haven’t been terrible, actually. Aside from getting overly emotional when she watches literally anything on television, she’s doing well. Castiel is a naturally doting partner, accustomed to spoiling her even when she pretends to be annoyed by it.
Collecting himself, Sam squares his shoulders and looks at Castiel straight-on, locking their gazes. “This life isn’t real, Cas. None of it is real. It’s an accelerated timeline. Can you remember your childhood?”
Ash and Benny leave the employee room just as Castiel enters. They pass with grins on their faces, but Castiel is mostly concerned about checking on Dean and making sure he’s alright.
Understanding what she means, Castiel stands up from the table. She stands, too, as he fishes his wallet out of his pocket and puts enough cash down to cover the food, drinks and tips. He then holds up his hands, halting her from grabbing her coat and purse.
“Mhm,” she crunches into her toast. “The walls are so bare. We’ll put up some cute pictures but i think I want a… shelf… for knick knacks.”
“-M’fine.” Dean interrupts. He turns around to rinse his glass and tip it into the dry rack. His jacket is still enclosed around him like armor, his bow legs wrapped in fishnets looking rather ridiculous beneath it. “Just wanna go to bed.”
“Yeah,” Charlie replies. “It was super weird. The last time I got kicked out of snooping on something was when I was checking to see if the NSA had my phone tapped. Spoiler alert: they did.”
“I’ll live,” Castiel tries to say sarcastically, but the facetiousness of his words plops onto the concrete in a gloopy crimson pile.
.” Wiggling out of Michael’s grip, he feels his heartbeat start to quicken. “I’m shitty food and lingerie and hair bands, Mike. You sayin’ you been tryna
Crowley turns on heel and leaves, walking around other desks on his way back to his office. The other occupants of the room look steadfastly busy, even if they actually aren’t, and a few people even send Castiel some murderous looks. They all consider him to be Crowley’s favorite, even though he feels more like his plaything at times, and all Castiel can do is shrug it off and ignore them all.
Castiel hangs up, nearly dropping his phone. He yanks the door of his car open, settling behind the wheel. He knows he shouldn’t drive in this state, but he doesn’t know who he can call on such short notice to drive him. Taking in a few deep breaths, he convinces himself that she had a little fall and was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure. His gut tells him otherwise, but his head needs to be clear, so he just focuses on a fabricated image of her lying on a hospital bed with her leg elevated, a brace on her ankle, her laughing and rolling her eyes and saying, “Honestly, I’m fine, they’re just overreacting because I’m pregnant!”.
good. He and Castiel don’t argue about anything; in fact, they live together quite seamlessly. Castiel treats Dean like an adult and Dean… well, Dean’s not sure how he treats Castiel. He teases him and makes fun of him but helps out when needed. He surprises him with home baked goods and annoys him by leaving his socks in the foyer sometimes. Dean sort of thought he’d get sick of the guy- after all, he’d lived with his dad and brother, but he’d avoided both of them at basically all costs, so no one really had a chance to get sick of the other (aside from John just being an ass in general).
.” He nods to Dean’s nametag. Dean used to give a false name on the streets. He feels slimy, now that Michael knows his real name. “I’m just here for a warm cup of soup.” He gestures to the seat across from him. “Care to join me?”
The rest of the day carries on uneventfully. It’s his first day wearing makeup at school and he spends half of it convinced everyone knows. No one treats him differently though, and every time he checks his appearance in the mirror he still looks perfect. Great, to be honest, but he’s trying not to fawn over himself and develop a weird ego for how he looks while wearing makeup. He’d followed a ‘natural’ makeup tutorial on YouTube, having bought pretty much all the products from the drug store with his allowance on his way home from Kevin’s. Natural makeup is fairly easy, but while he was doing it he couldn’t help but wonder how he’d look with winged eyeliner. Or perfect eyebrows. Or false lashes. He bought eyeliner and eyebrow pomade and false lashes but didn’t dare to actually use them.
Castiel looks mildly amused as he walks from his bedroom door to the kitchen counter that houses the coffee pot. “Good morning.”
The other thing Castiel feels, rather acutely: jealousy. It’s much less intense than the protectiveness, but it’s still enough to make him see red
Castiel presses his thumb to his lower lip, frowning. “I’ve never seen him before. He’d been watching me since I entered the cafe, but I didn’t see him among the patrons.”
Five seconds after he lands, he senses something flying towards him. Lifting an arm instinctively to block, the gust of wind that blasts in every direction from the sheer power of the contact of a fist hitting his forearm shakes the surrounding trees.
His existential crisis bleeds into Monday. He tells Crowley he won’t be doing any domestic reports this week, instead choosing to go over all of Dean’s files, making detailed notes of all the holes he can gather.
Dean flushes. “It’s not- it’s not like a perverted thing,” he grumbles, “but I uh. I guess I like… dresses and stuff. Dancing.”
“Dean, mostly,” Castiel sighs. “I’ll have nightmares about him killing me in the interview room, or I’ll have dreams where I’m…” he furrows his brow, trying to piece together his dreams with his waking brain. “With him.”
Everything dissolves from there to raucous laughter and needling. Castiel takes a moment to absorb everything; Ellen and Bobby jumping between joining in on the fun and reprimanding the kids for a swear word here and there, Jo truly being a sister to Sam and Dean, and of course, Sam and Dean themselves, their most vibrant when with one another. Somehow everyone manages to clear their plates and dish seconds between burning one another, and through it all, Castiel feels… tightness in his chest, coiling and expanding and coiling tight again.
This is it. He can take it or leave it. Hell, he can take it and still leave, just walk out that door. But Michael looks desperate, and Dean's dumb heart is beating fast.
...And he can go toe to toe with Crowley without pissing himself or killing him, so that largely helps.
Benny looks sharp in his uniform, his hat tucked under his arm and a notepad in his other hand. He chuckles warmly at Dean's usual advances. "Sure. Your dad is my biggest fan. Ready to give you away at any minute."
Sam falls quiet, but his grouchy mood matches Dean’s all the way to school. Dean drops him off, watching him disappear into the crowd, then lets out a sigh and rubs idly at the back of his neck. He shouldn’t put his shitty attitude on his brother. Sam’s a lot more perceptive than anyone wants to believe a ten year old can be, and sometimes they’re each other’s only line of defense. He’ll have to apologize to the brat later.
“That part’s anonymous, sir. Now, correct me if I’m wrong, sir, but it looks to me like you’ve laid hands on your boy.”
“Think about Dean’s life til’ now, though,” she says, her tone reasoning. “He’s been through so much, having a crush is probably like walking around Japan and not knowing the language.” Charlie, bless her, has been one of Dean’s best confidants. She knows everything he went through, and as a result, speaks good truths on his behalf. “It’s not that he doesn’t trust you or anything. I think maybe this is something he wants to try on his own.”
“Good job,” Dean claps his hands mockingly, softly so as to not attract attention. “I’m leaving now.” This time when he turns to leave, Michael lets him. He barely refrains from stomping up to the bar to put the order in on the iPad, then makes a beeline for the kitchen so he can get away from Michael’s lingering gaze.
Castiel puts his hands on Dean’s shoulder, turning him to his vanity. “Whatever feels right. Something subtle. Art galleries are for elegance and class.”
“It’ll only be a moment,” Castiel says. The door from the garage leads into the kitchen. There are some dishes in the sink, but the tile floor is swept and the dark granite counters are clean. Dean puts his duffel on a chair at the kitchen table as Castiel says, “Help yourself to anything”, and then heads off to the guest room.
As he looks around his bedroom, there’s a moment of disorientation. Is this his bedroom? It feels… off. He always has the curtains drawn over the windows, keeps it rather sparse, but it feels… wrong. Like there’s something missing by the door, like the books he has should be somewhere other than the shelves he’s hammered into the walls.
In the midst of it all, next to Castiel Dean catches his gaze, warmth and love shining in his eyes, contentment radiating off of him. Castiel feels himself bouncing it right back to him. Under the table Dean catches his hand, giving it a warm squeeze.
“Right,” Dean says shortly. He feels strangely elated that that’s how Castiel feels. Wrapping his hands around his mug, he licks his lips and talks into it again. “This isn’t, like, gonna reflect badly on you, is it?”
“Night, Cas,” Dean murmurs, the softness of his voice revealing that he’s already halfway to dreamland.
"Sometimes? One time real bad. That was the last time I'd seen him. The other day… he said he stopped seeing me 'cause he realized how he was hurting me."
The waiter drops off their menus and leaves. Dean does his best not to fidget, wholly prepared for Michael to get up and leave when he finds out how old he is.
“I just,” he lets out a little humorless chuckle. “I feel like an idiot. About last night. I’m sorry, I should have known.”
“Okey doke,” Charlie says, moving like molasses to exit out of the surveillance video and open up the screen that holds the encrypted message.
“I think,” Dean’s eyes might be dry but his words are all stopped up. “I think so, Sammy. We gotta… we gotta go see her, ok?”
“Does science disprove the ghost theory, or does it just say there’s no feasible way for them to exist?”
“Holy superheroes, Batman,” Charlie breathes, catching Castiel’s attention. She’s staring at her monitor.
by our clown of a president?” Dean says, some heat creeping into his voice. “Explains why he let the fucker go this long without any consequences.”
That’s one of the best things about Cas. Dean never feels like he needs to babble uselessly to fill any sort of silence. Silence doesn’t feel empty, between them. It feels full and welcoming and warm. It feels like acceptance and love. They’re halfway through their plates before anyone says anything, and Dean’s surprised that it’s Castiel.
Castiel finds ease in solitude, is one of those people who could be perfectly fine without human contact. He likes people well enough, but he could also do without. He supposes that’s why he’s been alright this past decade or so. He gets enough interaction with people at work, customers and employees, and being able to come home and have time to himself has suited him fine. He preferred it, even.
Are the highs the galleries? The museums? The fancy restaurants? Watching movies up here in his Crystal Palace while the rest of the world moves through molasses?
Castiel runs a hand through his hair, situating himself to sit better on the stool as he leans over the counter, keeping his voice private. “What do you know about Dean Winchester?”
The evening is quiet, enough cloud cover over the full moon to ensure no shadows are cast through the trees and along the frozen ground. Owls hoot, crickets chirp, various critters disturb the underbrush as they go to and fro. There’s an artificial sound scooting across the ground, displacing leaves with a
“Don’t panic, Dean,” she says calmly. “The clothes under your bed have needed to be washed for a while so I just thought I’d get them-”
Dean leans back in his seat, as much as he comfortably can while being shackled to the table and chair. He tips his head back and looks up at the ceiling, the curl on his lips faintly amused, maybe even a little reserved. “I’m gonna die, Novak. In three months they’re gonna shoot me to the moon. I know I ain’t a saint and that I don’t deserve much,” he drops his chin and levels his gaze with Castiel’s, causing the reporter’s stomach to swoop, “but I think the least I could get is a pretty face to see before I kick the bucket.”
“Like- did you go to church, did you study it in college… how’d you learn? And how much did you learn?”
“Cas, I mean it. M’not leavin’ without you again. All of us gotta break the cycle or else we’ll keep bouncing between different shitty realities until we
“You knew you were breaking the law the moment you called me~” Charlie sing-songs happily, before leaving Castiel’s room.
Castiel seems to register his true meaning right away. He swallows, holding eye contact. “Whatever you would like.”
Inside Dean’s room, Castiel opens the closet and starts sorting through some things. He pulls out a beautiful blue silk blouse that he’s only seen on the hanger, turning to Dean and holding it out to him. “Wear this with your slacks.”
Dean’s voice breaks their staredown. Castiel yanks the shovel and then cracks it into the ice, splitting the chunk and then brushing it away. Michael turns to Dean and looks… smitten. How can this be? Castiel thought that Michael was in the past. That he had managed to speak sensibly to Dean to get him to realize he needed to move forward in his life and not look back.
. A lone figure hauls a tied off tarp, nary a sweat breaking on his brow as he drags the heavy load through the woods. He’s strong, broad shoulders with an equally broad chest, wearing a plain t-shirt and jeans on thick legs as he makes his way into the darkness. His dark hair obscures his face, but the glint of his white teeth reflects over the ambient light of the night.
“Kinda easy to lose your fighting spirit when you’re in solitary confinement for literally every minute of every day.”
Dean’s eyes search Castiel’s face for a second, before they soften a fraction. “Thank you. I think this time- if you hadn’t…” He sniffles, trailing off. He clears his throat, “Anyway, thank you. He comin’ around any time soon?”
He’d been so good looking that Dean had nearly forgotten that he was paying some twink kid for sex. A Hollywood smile, shiny coiffed hair, and dressed to the nines. Definitely a sight for sore eyes. Things hadn’t started out all bad; he was a little aggressive and liked to call Dean names, but that was a walk in the park compared to some of the other stuff he’d gone through. But the more Dean saw him, the more their sessions started to spiral, until eventually Michael had beaten him so bad Dean had had to stay in the motel for two whole days licking his wounds. But he never saw Michael again after that, and then about two months later he met Castiel. He thought Michael might have come to his senses about seeing a prostitute for sex- it never occurred to him that Michael might have felt bad for how he treated Dean.
Letting out a little pained noise, Castiel pulls his glasses off of his face and presses his palm to his brow, trying to massage away the pain. Squinting through his lashes, now, he continues reading through the white hot burning sensation starting to spread through him.
“Uh huh,” Charlie replies. “So we’re not gonna talk about you turning into Iron Man? Or the fact that you totally kicked ass?”
Crazily enough, his relationship with Benny only strengthens. The guy saw him at his most vulnerable, and there’s something special in that; especially since Dean had trained himself up to avoid and be suspicious of all law enforcement. Figures that now Benny’s the shit, since he cuffed his dad and hauled him away. Ash is still weird, but a little less so once he found out how old Dean is. Not that he'd been a creep, but Dean thinks he's up to something sketch behind closed doors and probably knows better than to get near someone else who's tangoed with the law. The rest of the staff is welcoming and kind- Chuck is the daytime bartender, Meg is another waitress who honestly kinda scares Dean sometimes, but the icing on the cake?
He leaves, and Dean stares at his bag. There’s a full length mirror on one of the walls, so he turns to it to assess himself as-is. Plain clothes, plain face, plain hair. People of all sorts call him pretty, but he has a hard time seeing it when he’s like this. His heartbeat quickens the longer he looks at himself.
A breeze wafts through the pregnant silence filling the space between Castiel and Michael. Dean looks both uncomfortable and proud at the same time, whereas Michael looks ready to spontaneously combust.
Holding back a sigh, Castiel fusses with the rubber mats until they can’t be straightened any further. “I suppose so.”
Pausing in turning a page in his book, Castiel blinks a few times at the words he suddenly doesn’t think are in English. After a few more blinks, and deciding that this book is absolutely unreadable, Castiel glances up at Dean. “Pardon?”
Thankfully the waiter interrupts to take their order. Michael requests what sounds like a complicated salad, whereas Dean clumsily orders a foreign-sounding steak dish. No way in hell is he gonna skimp on this. Michael drips money.
“Only on nights I work here,” he replies. “Don’t want my dad to see me comin’ home like this. Stay at a motel, get cleaned up, have a good night’s sleep, then go home before everyone wakes up.”
Michael falls limp. Castiel gathers up the amputated wings, careful not to damage them any further, then starts the slow ascent up the curve of the crater wall. It’s difficult to move with a mountain of bone and feathers in his arms, but he’s determined. At the top Sam and Dean reach out for him, sturdy and solid and permanent as trees, gripping him with their hands and hauling him up. He drops the wings, their feathers shifting and fluffing softly as they part the tall grass to rest. He sags against the brothers, inhaling their scents; sweat, shampoo, gunpowder.
He snorts to himself as he gets dressed. In a way, Charlie sort of reminds him of Dean, and vice-versa. Maybe that’s why he can’t quite sort himself out; Dean feels… familiar to him, somehow. Once he’s dressed and cozy he leaves his bedroom and wanders back into the kitchen, where Charlie has extended the lip of the table and put up a barrier of books so they can eat without the threat of accidentally getting any food on Charlie’s tech. It’s a sweet gesture. Castiel doesn’t really feel like eating on the couch. She made homemade mac n’ cheese, and because Castiel knows Charlie he knows it’s the vegan kind, but he doesn’t really care. She’s a surprisingly excellent cook, considering how much time she doesn’t spend in the kitchen.
"I have my concerns," Michael admits, "but probably not the ones you're thinking of." Dean arches a brow and folds his arms, so Michael gestures idly. "Your father."
Even now, Dean can’t be sure that that’s why he stopped. There's still something lurking behind those pretty dark lashes. Michael’s words were sweet and sounded sincere, but did he mean it? Was he really, truly apologizing for how he treated Dean?
books, right?” Dean asks, amused. Castiel, after a period of adjustment, has grown fond of Dean’s easy attitude. If “fond” was an actual emotion he could be capable of. He’s not sure, yet.
what an encrypted message is. But why would there be anything like that floating around about Pamela Barnes?”
"Not- not literally," Dean corrects. "I had a bad night at the club and he let me stay over. He didn't… know my situation. Now I stay with him 'cause he's… probably the nicest person I've ever met." He meets Michael's raised brow with his own. "And he's straight."
“Bachelor’s in psychology,” Castiel says, and then continues. “Bachelor’s in criminal justice, forensic psychology, and law enforcement.”
“I’m starving,” Castiel says loud enough for Charlie to hear, going for distraction so Charlie doesn’t worry too much about the fact he may or may not have almost drowned in the bathtub. “Do you want to go grab lunch?”
Working at the grocery store soon wasn’t paying all of the bills. John stopped working, too drunk to even get himself out of bed except to eat, piss, and drink more. Dean had to come up with a way, quick, to earn extra cash.
The man comes to himself, getting back in Castiel’s space, although this time he doesn’t touch him. Instead his gaze burns with righteous fury, and when the light in the alley shifts, Castiel catches sight of an enormous, dark shadow protruding from the man’s back to cast on the building behind him.
John,” he hangs up. He has no idea how things are gonna work when John’s out of jail and finally comes home--home to the house that Dean and Sam have lovingly restored back to its warmth and glory from when their mom was alive, love in the air and comfort in every corner. In fact, it’s something that Dean actively tries
“No?” Michael asks with interest, too casual to be real. “Though I suppose he has his own life, separate from yours.”
Of course, Castiel notices the shift. "I… will throw it away?" He hazards, standing up and moving to the garbage can.
Victor opens the door, barking orders into the hallway. Castiel stays where he’s standing, wearing sunglasses in a dark room and not giving a single shit, his arms still folded over his chest as someone comes in with a hand broom and dustpan to clean up the mess. Someone else quickly replaces the fixture and the bulb, Victor and Castiel exchange a glance and a nod, and then Dean and Castiel are left alone again.
She sends him a measuring look, but ultimately ends up sending him a loving smile. “You let me know if that changes.”
Nearly choking on his apple, Dean forces himself to chew and swallow, holding his ground. “A little.”
After watching Castiel for a second, likely to make sure he wouldn’t try to flee again, Dean says calmly, “Release.”
“Shut up,” he chimes in. Everyone snickers into quiet. He looks around the table, pointing with the carving knife to each person--including Castiel. “Everyone say one thing they’re grateful for, this year.”
No one says shit about what their “supposed” relationship may or may not be, but he suspects that’s more out of individual self-preservation than respect. Castiel can be downright scary if he has to be. Besides, most people sort of treat them like father and son, and yeah that can be a downer, ‘cause he’s not a kid and he definitely doesn’t want to be Castiel’s son, but it’s also kinda… nice.
People at the restaurant know their situation, and while they get made fun of occasionally, Castiel takes it in stride and swiftly moves on… and Dean- well, Dean manages to get flustered like an idiot. Because he still has a stupid crush on Castiel, and it’s only gotten worse since they’ve been living together. He thought maybe there’d be some dumb habit the guy has, some gross thing about him that would turn him off and kill his desire but… no such thing. All evidence points to Castiel being perfect and if there was a chance of anyone making a fool of themselves and turning off the other, it’s gonna be Dean.
There are dudes into the fact he’s freshly legal, there are some dudes that pretend he isn’t. Every single one of his customers loves his long lashes and sweet mouth, though, so they can fantasize whatever they want about him as long as it ends with money in his pocket.
“Alright,” he finally concedes. “There is no way to prove or disprove the existence of ghosts so long as clashing theories and scientific experiments exist.” After a moment of taking in Dean’s nearly childlike excitement at his concession, Castiel finally thinks to ask, “Do
“No,” Michael’s wings rip free from his back, eight of them, shining gold and pearl with white feathers and glittering veins. He leves Castiel with an even stare, “You love
“Well-” Dean sounds a little sheepish, reaching a hand up to rub the back of his neck. “‘Course m’here, Cas.” A pause, and then a little hesitantly, “Can’t think of anywhere else I’d rather be.”
“We gotta-” he licks his lips, clearing his throat. His eyes burn, but he can’t feel any tears falling. His eyes are hot and hollow all at once. “We gotta go see her, Sammy.”
Castiel, whose eyes today are red and puffy and irritated no matter how many allergy pills he takes or eye drops he soaks into them. “Fine, thank you.” He replies almost curtly. He’d thought all night about how to steer today’s interview. The red light on his recorder blinks plaintively, a visual metronome for every second that passes in the presence of Dean Winchester. Folding his hands on the table, he meets Dean’s eyes as best as possible, but before he can speak he winces at a sudden onslaught of brightness, reaching up to cover his eyes. “Pardon me.” He says under his palm. He rubs his eyes a few times, then moves his hand away to regard Dean once more.
Daphne’s gaze turns soft and sweet, her pretty eyes sparkling. “You carry the weight of other’s burdens too readily, Castiel. What about your own?”
Sitting up, Dean scrubs a hand over his mouth. He takes a second to really, truly appreciate how he woke up today. Not a cockroach in sight, a bed that smells like fabric softener instead of starch and bleach. Hell, even his
Dean rolls his eyes, folding his arms over his chest. “You got lucky yesterday, y’know. Sucker punches are for pussies.”
Scrubbing a hand over his mouth, Dean chuckles a little wetly. “Go to bed, brat. Tomorrow’s the beginning of our new lives.”
“Ah, there h’is. Now, sir. I’m sure you can see how bad this looks, sir, so I’ll suggest that you come when I ask, and not when you feel like, because one of those situations will have a much more favorable outcome, sir."
Castiel’s jaw tenses. Deciding to call Dean on his bluff about wanting Castiel because of his looks, he asks again, “Why did you request me when my name wasn’t in the pot?”
Dean knows nothing about art, but as they start to make their way through the gallery, he feels two things specifically:
“Listen to me,” Dean says, his voice still gentle, inviting. Light bursts from his green eyes, blossoms from his chest. “You’ve never been able to do that before.” Castiel’s eyes narrow. Dean points up to the brand new light fixture. “The game’s changing.”
“At first I thought I was going to be mugged,” Castiel says, wrapping his hands around his own cup, allowing the warmth to absorb into his palms. That catches Charlie’s attention and she squawks out a “What!?” before Castiel continues. “But then he started saying strange things. And, he knew my name.”
All suspicions are laid to rest when Castiel creeps around the corner to peer into the living room. The furniture is neatly pushed aside, leaving quite a large space of hardwood floors. Dancing in the middle of the room is Dean, barefoot, dressed in yoga pants and a tank top, oblivious to the world as the music takes him over. There’s a sheen of sweat covering his flushed skin, giving away the fact that he’s been dancing for quite some time now. Castiel takes a moment to just watch him; how his body, stronger and healthier than ever, takes him through some complicated movements, and even up into the air. The music is instrumental, nearly orchestral with a smooth, rich bass line. Gripping his satchel tightly, he makes the decision to not startle Dean too much, or be discovered peeping.
He’s brought out of his thoughts by a touch on his arm. The nurse is sending him a sympathetic glance as he says, “Have a seat, Mr. Novak.”
Tonight Dean and Sam are sitting at the dining room table enjoying a casserole that Dean had excitedly whipped up. Cooking isn’t something entirely new, but once again, the novelty of being able to eat in peace with no pressure is mighty fine as the boys sit across from each other and kick each other’s feet under the table while Sam talks about whatever nerdy thing he’s read in his science book today.
Tensing his jaw, Castiel nods. “I’ve gone over all the police reports; I watched the trial; I did some of my own investigations. There are interesting… gaps of information.”
“It would seem so.” Castiel pulls two plates from the cupboards, sliding the steak onto each one. He catches the oven before it beeps, putting a baked potato on each plate, peeling away the foil and slicing through them with a knife to expose the fluffy insides. He sets the plates on the island, gathers condiments and the salad bowl, then stands opposite Benny and frowns at the delicious meal. “I’m… conflicted.”
Opening his eyes, blinking away the moisture on his lashes that could either be from the shower or himself, he lets out a slow breath. This is stupid. He can’t get emotional over a serial killer. He has a gut instinct, yes, but that doesn’t change the fact that Dean, and probably his father too, has criss-crossed all over the country killing… things? People? Castiel closes his eyes again, this time newspaper headlines flashing before his eyes. Animal attacks mysteriously stop, people no longer drowning in local lake, bank teller exonerated from robbing her own vault.
When Castiel stops going to work it’s as though his job just… disappears. No calls from Crowley, no e-mails from colleagues wondering where he’s gone. When he goes to the grocery store it’s almost like a video game that hasn’t finished loading. He can get food and other necessities, but the crowds around him don’t move very fast, and eventually he starts going to the self check-out because the cashiers don’t even
After doing his own brushing up on this supposed Enochian language, Castiel tells Charlie to print out a test page of the code for him. His eyes had fuzzed out while looking at the screen, so maybe he just needs less screen time in general? It would explain his splitting migraines and his vision going hazy at strange times. He must have hit his threshold for being in front of digital screens. He should have bought those expensive blue light glasses he’d seen at the store a few weeks ago.
When Pamela, eighties rocker hair, tattoos and sunglasses, had gone on the news and announced that journalists could put their name in a drawing in order to have a chance to interview the infamous Dean Winchester before execution, Castiel had scoffed.
“Well, that, and-” Dean shifts in his chair. “The guy… from last night. Used to be a customer.” He drums his thumb against the mug. “Like, a john. He got grabby ‘cause he’s pissed I’m not on the streets anymore.”
No one could fathom why he would admit to doing all of those horrendous things. No one understood why Pamela, hired to defend him, allowed him to be handed the death penalty.
Her hand flies out to hit him in the stomach. It doesn’t hurt, but he lets out a fake pained “oof” anyway, which delights and satisfies her. “If I’m near a wall or a piece of furniture I’m fine.” She turns back to surveying the room. “Just think, Castiel. One day this room will be full of a baby’s laughter instead of your old man bickering.”
“Angel blood is like…” Sam tries to find the words. “It’s the best vehicle for magic if you’re missing ingredients or needing the spell to be stronger than it actually is. And…” he sends Dean an uneasy glance.
Castiel clears his throat, stepping into the room. When Dean sees him he looks surprised, which is expected, and then he looks… ready to cry, which is definitely not expected. But he holds back, clenching his jaw and nodding towards Castiel.
The grenade and the rocket hit Michael’s back with so much force it first knocks the wind out of him, and then the explosion brings forth an agonizing, inhuman cry from the archangel. Castiel feels the flesh of his forearms sizzling and burning, the bones breaking with the explosion, but his head and body stay safely cocooned by his wings as he keeps his vice hold on Michael.
The ache in his eyes is dull. In his head he sees great, big, shadowy wings burnt into the ground, charred and blackened from battle and death. At the center of them he sees-
"When the accident happened… I could have very easily blamed God for taking her and our baby. But I instead tried to lean into Him, become a vessel for others to confess their burdens. It worked… for a while." He stared down at the countertop where his palm rested, flexing his fingers idly. "But I knew that wasn't the path God wanted me on."
It clicks. Michael is the old john that bothered Dean at work last month or so ago, the one that Castiel had--supposedly--talked Dean out of seeing again. Covering up his surprise by reaching out to take his hand for a shake, Castiel hopes his expression doesn’t betray his bewilderment. “Castiel. He didn’t tell me he was going anywhere.”
Castiel makes, what he thinks is, a positive noise. The nurse frowns a little, then pats his knee and stands up to leave.
. It’s like Dean is radiating the light of a thousand suns. Castiel can’t distinguish his handsome features, details washed out by the brightness coming from him. Golden beauty, Dean’s shining like a beacon. Castiel reaches shaky fingers into the pocket of his shirt, pulling out his prescription sunglasses, unfolding them fretfully before putting them on his face. It only helps a little bit. He turns his head, focuses on the wall closest to them- not bright. He looks at the door- not bright. He looks up at the light itself, hanging from an industrial fixture on the ceiling- also not bright.
Now, at thirty, with a baby on the way and house renovations slowly coming to a stop to accommodate the delicate senses of an infant, Castiel feels… settled. Not in a bad way by any means- not at all. He feels comfortable in his skin, enjoys his life in a way he never thought he could. His parents had been distant at best and disapproving at worst of any decision he’s ever made; he hates to use Daphne as a cushion but he tends to do so. She doesn’t mind. It’s another reason he loves and appreciates her so much. She doesn’t lord anything over him, she doesn’t belittle him. She’s everything a partner should be and he does his best to show her every day how much he loves her.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says. “The man has been removed and trespassed. Unfortunately, filing charges would be difficult, but we could try.”
“Huh,” Dean’s hands relax on the table, fingertips drumming an off-beat. “Y’got a skewed sense of justice then, huh? Fancy yourself a vigilante?”
He blinks, and is alone in the room once again. He’s only “seen” Daphne a few times before, usually at peaks of stress and anxiety, and while he knows it’s his subconscious entering fight or flight mode to preserve his mental stability, it’s still… nice to “see” her, remember her, and though her input is his own, she was always much wiser than he was. Listening to his own voice of reason has never been as effective as listening to hers.
They dated in secret all the way up to their senior year. They probably could have continued dating without anyone knowing until… well,
Turning around, Castiel smiles at his friend. “Pan-seared is a sorry imitation of what I can do on the grill.”
They exit the room casually. Castiel had been sure that the gunshot would alert the guards, but Victor stands there with a secretive smile, staring straight ahead and not looking at the pair as they leave. They stay low, just in case, peeking around corners and following the maze of the prison.
"I wish the accident hadn't happened, and that Daphne could be here with me today and I could be driving Jimmy to baseball practice and taking him out for ice cream. I wish I could fall asleep next to my wife, every single night- I wish that I could kiss her,
. Of course, the criminal justice system declared it an open-and-shut case, since Dean pleaded guilty and didn’t fight any of the charges. Other than pleading guilty, though, Dean never disclosed
“With your help and guidance, Dean’s come to a good place. If Michael is truly a problem, he would listen to you, brother.”
just… everything good all at once. A song that allows him to live in a world with no dad, no johns, and no stress.
“That’s the beauty of thrifting,” she says, her eyes twinkling. “You don’t know what you’re looking for until you find it.”
Castiel’s brows scrunch in confusion. The buzzer rings and their hour is up, Victor opening the door and walking to the table to start releasing Dean from his seat. Dean flashes Castiel a smile, Castiel’s heart skips a beat, and then Castiel is left alone in the room.
“I appreciate the offer, but seeing as how an apartment is temporary until I can buy a house, I’d rather not customize it too much.”
Castiel smiles softly. "One does not need to be a priest in order to preach love and kindness." He took another sip of cocoa, hiding his smile. "Daphne was agnostic."
“Daphne’d smack you left n’ right for lettin’ Dean leave with Michael.” Benny pauses. “Shoot, she’d probably go after them herself.”
not only am i leaving you with this cliffhanger but i also do not have reliable internet for the foreseeable future!
Swallowing past the lump in his throat, Castiel reaches up a hand to wipe it over his face and look at her with a wan smile. “Today was her first Mother’s day.”
Feeling awkward, Dean brings his coffee up for a sip. They drink their coffee quietly, but at seven Dean can hear his alarm start to go off in the bedroom.
converse but it can also be deduced that these men just… came up with a secret language, like a pair of toddlers. Also," he pulls up a different web page. "Spells? Magic?" He sends his friend a dead look.
“Hoy frack.” He can hear clacking on Charlie’s end, meaning she’s at her computer and furiously typing. “Ok. Ok, whaddya want? You know, one time I looked into the guy and saw some crazy stuff in some police records. But my system got flagged and I had to get out of that corner of the internet really quick.”
Taking in a deep breath, Castiel’s fingers twitch. “You once told me you killed things, Dean. Now you are referring to your victims as people.”
He dresses like he would any other day. He’s not out here to impress Michael. It’s the other way around, thanks. So he wears light jeans and a black Metallica shirt with his new leather jacket- one he’s still breaking in and fits him way better. The art museum is downtown and Dean hates parking Baby at the meters, so he takes the bus instead. He forces his foot to stop tapping, wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans. He’s been thinking a lot about Michael, replaying their old interactions in his head over and over again. He’ll know if Michael is up to something, today. He knows that glint in his eye.
“How was inventory?” Dean asks. He hadn’t really been a part of it; Castiel usually rounds up a few lucky staff to work a graveyard shift to get it all done without any interruption.
“Trevor neglected to tell me there was an incident yesterday,” the principal says with interest, looking towards Trevor.
“The bedroom is ready,” Castiel says, eyes landing on Dean, who’s standing at the sink and sipping on a glass of water. “The bathroom and laundry room are across the hall.”
The house stays tidy all week, but Sundays are the deep clean. There’s a door that always stays shut, the door that Dean knows leads to the unused nursery Castiel and his wife had started working on together, but Dean knows every other nook and cranny in the house like his own.
Castiel hums. "You can push furniture around in the living room and dance here, if you like. My hardwood floors are expensive enough to resist scuffing."
John squats down, his knees cracking as he looms over Dean, his voice dropping to a dangerous register. “I know when you pay the bills, too, boy. Your paychecks ain’t regular. You pay a chunk here, a chunk there. Sometimes big, sometimes small. I assume the little checks are for the blowjobs, huh?” His hand snaps out, fingers gripping Dean’s hair and yanking him up with a pained yelp. “Big checks are for bouncing on his cock, huh?”
“I ain’t got a restraining order against you but that don’t mean I won’t call the cops the second I see your face without an invitation.”
A sleek, black, 1967 Chevrolet Impala is speeding down a dirt road, kicking up rocks and dust and rocking its chassis as it barrels through and over potholes.
Once he’s standing to look at himself in the full length mirror hanging on the wall, Dean clearly sees himself to be as beautiful as he truly is. A nervous expression flickers over his face as he turns to Castiel, “You don’t think it’s too much? My date- um, he knows that I… like this, but we’ve never discussed going out in public.”
Nodding, Castiel sighs. “Yes.” Clicking on a different article, he scans a few sentences and then rolls his eyes. “A linguist has basically debunked this language as a farce. It’s not consistent enough to be considered an actual language to be communicable. It’s similar to English enough that people
“Because the Earth is no longer beautiful!” Michael suddenly shouts, a vein popping in his forehead. Wind gusts, his shoulders starting to distort. “Putting you and the Winchesters through those alternate timelines was the last hoo-rah of being amused by humans before putting an end to it all!”
“Is there a reason your boss is driving you home at seven-thirty in the morning?” John asks, venom in his voice.
All in all, it’s two weeks of bliss. John tries calling from the jail, but the second Dean hears the “
Not… that the thought hadn’t crossed his mind before. After all, Castiel is handsome, successful, handsome, kind, fit, nice, handsome, stacked-
The guard opens the door and gestures for Castiel to sit. Inside is a square, four-by-four table bolted down to the floor, flanked by two chairs, also bolted to the floor. There’s a D-ring welded into the center of the table and hooks for shackles on one of the chairs. Castiel sits down carefully in what he assumes is the guest chair, quietly taking stock of his surroundings. There are no windows, and a quick glance shows cameras mounted in all four corners of the room.
Turning around, John grabs Dean by the scruff of his oversized jacket, hauling him along. “You’re askin’ for a whoopin’, boy. What kinda shit are you gettin’ yourself into?”
“I love you, too. Go get that paint! I can’t be around paint fumes so I’ll probably stay out until you’re done. Call me?”
“I’m kinda waitin’ to see when they’re gonna let dad out.” He scratches the side of his nose, holding back a sigh as he picks up his fork. “Gotta get Sammy off to Bobby and Ellen’s before he comes home.”
currently decomposing in the tarp at a delayed pace thanks to the frosty air. Castiel doesn't really think himself a vigilante, as he generally had no rhyme or reason as to how he chose to express his… more creative self, but it was always nice when victims put a target on their back and practically screamed “KILL ME!”.
Dean drums his fingers over the table, feeling like a complete jackoff. How does he keep putting his entire foot in his mouth in front of Castiel? Castiel stands from the table, bringing the coffee pot over for refills. As he pours the steaming liquid into his cup, Dean says quietly, “I’m sorry about your wife.”
