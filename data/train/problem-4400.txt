Cas has the purpose he’s always wanted, has the kind of juice he hasn’t had in years, ever since he first fell from Heaven, ever since Dean ruined him—
The camp is still in disarray from the fight. He checks the cabs and beds of the two pickup trucks, kicks lightly at the bedrolls on the ground, the tarp stretched against the side of one vehicle like a makeshift tent. The door of the trailer is padlocked shut; Castiel wraps his fingers around the cool metal and wrenches it off with one hand.
"Guess I should be glad you picked up so much from Rowena," says Dean. He unzips his jacket. "Alright, let's get this show on the road."
Dean gets his legs under him, takes two staggering steps, collapses down to his hands and knees, tries to rise again and fails. Miraculously, he avoids the furniture as he drags himself towards the door. When Castiel reaches him, he fights like a wild thing, lands weak little blows on Castiel's arms and face.
Dean moves. He shoves into Cas's space, curls his hands in the fabric of Cas's coat, keeps plowing forward until he's walked Cas backwards into the wall of the shed. Garden tools rattle on the shelves at the impact. Cas stares at Dean with eyes so wide and dark that Dean thinks he might fall in, and live curled in the warmth of that gaze, forever.
. He thinks of Cas with dark veins bubbling under the skin, Cas with an awful, tar-stained grin. It isn’t hard to picture; god knows he dreamed it enough, after it happened the first time.
"Is it worth mentioning that I hate this?" Sam says as he steps over to stand in front of Dean, nearly toe-to-toe with him. They each put their left hand on the other's shoulder. Dean can feel the tension radiating from his brother, a coiled apprehension like a crackle of static energy.
Chuck's eyes are cold, even as his voice continues to affect joviality. "Whatever. Consider this a snack break, huh? Catch your breath, we’ll start again.”
Cas shrugs out of his coat and jacket, lets them drop to the ground. Dean swallows around the surge of want bubbling through his chest; he reaches out to Cas, fumbles at the front of Cas's white dress shirt, working buttons open with clumsy haste. He gets through about half of them before Cas loses his patience and yanks Dean's jacket off his shoulders, drags Dean's own shirt up until Dean has to acquiesce and raise his arms to get it over his head.
a blunt instrument. He's the hammer he once accused Cas of being, the gun leveled at the poltergeist in the dark, the jawbone-blade cleaving tissue from bone. He's the sword swung on marionette strings by the archangel. He's the best pupil Alastair's ever had.
"Trust me," says Castiel. "You definitely did." He leans down to nip gently at Dean's lower lip. "It's you," he murmurs into Dean's jawline. "It's all you. I can feel it."
Dean was made to break everything he touches. Of course Cas wouldn't escape unscathed. Cas was made to be something inexorable, something beyond pain, beyond hurt, beyond caring. Beyond love and all of its cutting razor edges. Dean changed that.
holy fire," Castiel whispers to himself, and in a split second he makes his decision, furls his wings in close, and launches all the divine intent and mortal flesh of himself through the green flames.
“There’s too many of them!” it barks over its shoulder, toward Cas, where the first leviathan is still standing. “Mark him so we can get out of here!”
, the water is freezing cold—and turns him onto his back. The angel's eyes are closed, his face gaunt and colorless. Dean pans the light down and breathes a sigh of relief as he sees a faint but discernible rise and fall to Cas's chest.
"Hey, it's cool, I like my job." She tosses back her pale curls, winks. "Doesn't mean I don't do a little freelancing here and there, if you know what I mean." She sidles closer, running her hand along the frame of the truck, tilting her head to show off the long clean line of her neck. "So? What do you say? My shift's over, you look like you got space up front there."
having to hover over you in case a fucking butterfly reminds you of the stupid angel and it all goes to shit? Do you have any
"Cas," Dean chokes out, his gaze suddenly coming to rest on Castiel, his expression alight with terror. "You can't be here. Cas, they're going to kill you, you have to go—"
Castiel whirls, stumbling in his haste to get to his feet. He puts his hand on the rain-slick tree trunk to steady himself, and blinks up at Dean.
"Nope, nuh-uh." She pulls to a halt, crosses her arms. "I don't do off-site visits, hon. That's how you get dead. Or worse."
the world to come into existence. This...this rejoining of being, is unprecedented in the history of the universe. And more importantly, it cannot
"Shut up, Dean," says Castiel. "I repeat, it was incredible, and so were you. Your soul is always beautiful, but being close with you physically amplified it. It's hard to describe how much I wanted you, how much I wanted to feel not just your physical body but your soul as well. Giving in to that, having that, was...indescribable. I just wasn't expecting the shared sensation to be reciprocal."
Cas nods, almost to himself. He looks back at Dean. "I thought it would be easier, for both of us, to treat it as a chapter that was closed. I thought maybe—if I could devote myself to rebuilding Heaven, doing something good, then maybe eventually..."
“Forgive us,” says the antlered fey finally. They clear their throat and continue, stiffly, “When fresh-cut pine is placed at this particular angle to the sun’s solstitial position, it acts as a beacon for our kind—typically this indicates a call for aid if emanating from an enclosed location.”
Sam is busy with his own phone but keeps looking at him sideways, between the constant chirping of his message alerts. Probably Eileen, although Dean wonders if he's also texting Cas. He wants to ask. It burns against his tongue.
Sam gives a little jerk of his head. He meets Dean's eyes steadily. His lashes are wet. "But there's so much—
They get Jack reinstalled in his old room, which doesn't take long. It looks exactly the same as the last time Jack occupied it. Sam doesn't think anyone's set foot in it since the day of the cemetery. Cas, maybe, but Cas has never left much in the way of traces. Sam can picture Cas moving through the room in the dark in that careful way of his, touching everything, disturbing nothing.
"Thank you," Sam says into Castiel's ear, his voice still wet like he's been holding a lump of tears in his throat the entire drive. And then, the words bursting out of him like waters overrunning a dam— "Cas, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry we couldn't get you out—"
And god, Dean doesn't regret it one bit. Because he'd gotten to be the one to take Cas back to the Bunker and feed him and dig up some clothes for him, and he'd gotten to be the one to teach Cas how to shave and tie his shoelaces and make his own coffee in the mornings. He'd gotten to do certain unspeakable, inevitably very loud things to Cas that Sam and Kevin gave him the stink-eye about in the mornings.
"Even if I could, time doesn't really...exist very much, in there." Jack shrugs his jacket on. It's the same outfit that he wore when he disappeared from that quiet suburban street yesterday, and Dean wonders if that's just the outfit he'll wear for eternity, now. "But I'd say it's approximately...not long."
"Why'd you wait?" Dean says. He's still on his knees, but his entire body is rigid, his spine like a knife blade. His soul is shrinking into itself, opaque like clouded glass.
. His chest aches, a grief so immense he thinks it might split him apart. He sees it mirrored on Sam's face, sees pain distort his brother's features as the memory knifes at them both. Dean makes himself face it head-on: he pries open the agony of it, digs into the raw fissure of loss until he thinks the sorrow might snap him in two. Chuck didn't put that grief inside his chest. Didn't set it off inside him like a bomb, spilling its blades and fire down his spine, up his throat. Dean doesn't know a lot, but he knows that much—this grief is his.
"You were trapped in a narrative tessellation—a set of nested sub-dimensions branching off from your original plotline."
, and the distance between him and Cas is measurable in yards instead of in miles, there's a distinct light-headedness rising in him that he identifies as terror. He has to resist the urge to dig his fingers into his own chest like there's a chance it might rip itself apart of its own accord.
never have happened before, back when his disciplined maintenance of the distance between himself and Dean was almost airtight, when the years of constant restraint had made it second nature to hold back from Dean's soul. His entering of Dean's mind a few moments ago wasn't a conscious reaction, just a knee-jerk answer to Dean's sudden pain, and that shouldn't have happened, Castiel shouldn't have
Castiel tries to speak and coughs instead; he tastes blood and realizes that he's bitten down on his tongue. Raz doesn't lift his foot; pain continues to shoot up into Castiel's left shoulder. On his knees, bent awkwardly at the waist to keep from pulling on the pinned wing, he edges slowly back towards his tormentor.
The streetlight over their heads flickers as something crosses over Cas's face, an indecipherable expression. Dean tries not to read too hard into it. The guy's
"You, " he says, his voice completely devoid of surprise. Like it's the most expected thing in the world for Dean to be there.
I was originally planning on having this chapter cover more ground, but the sigil-breaking scene ended up needing more space to breathe and develop, so I decided to let it have its own chapter to itself. More angst and h/c next update, as always.
"You're safe," Castiel says again. All the other things he wants to say crowd insistently on the tip of his tongue, and he holds them back with an effort. Holds back, too, the overwhelming desire to kiss Dean that surges up inside him with the force of a tangible thing. He lets go of Dean, finding the physical contact suddenly too much to take—Dean is so incredibly solid under his hand, he is
Dean opens his mouth, probably to make another stupid joke about why primordial entities shouldn’t skip onboarding, but his attention is caught by the dark shape swarming down the cliffside. Dry cedar scales crunch as the wendigo leaps the last few feet to the ground below. “Cas,” he rasps in warning. “Wendigo—”
Dean chokes. His hands are tangled in the front of Castiel's coat. Castiel can't remember exactly how or when they wound up there.
"Dean, there," Sam reaches for him as if on instinct, though they’re not standing close enough to touch. With his other hand, he points.
"They—left?" Cas squints around the room, holding the blanket against his now-unmarked stomach with his free hand. "The other people who were trapped here? Are they..."
Cas. It's all he can do to fish for his lighter with shaking fingers. His hands, so steady on the knife, are trembling now; it takes him three tries to finally click the flame to life.
"Not at all," says Castiel urgently. He stops beside Dean and puts a hand on Dean's arm. "It makes sense. Dean, what they did to you—"
. His whole body aches for it. But Cas’s hand just hovers in the space between them for a moment, and then drops.
It takes him a moment to realize the pain is gone. Miraculously, magically gone. He gulps for air and blinks up at Cas, who’s crouched over him, one hand under the back of Dean’s head, the other still pressed against Dean’s chest. Dean can feel the warmth of Cas’s palm through the rents in his ruined shirt. Strange, he thinks inanely, that Cas still has body heat.
Dean mimes zipping his mouth closed, but Sam isn't looking—he's bending over the knife, his lips moving in the syllables of a language Dean can't identify, his jaw knotting with effort. There's a low ripple of power that races around the room like a trapped wind, a glimmer of bright color in Sam's eyes that could be just a trick of the light. Dean wonders, not for the first time and not, he suspects, for the last, how much of that power is coming from the invocation of the spell and how much is coming from Sam himself.
"I know you know a lot about me," he repeats, stalling for time just once more. Just once more. And then he moves his arm, and he moves his hand, and he moves the thumb and fingers that belong to a body that has done a lot, including kill God, including turn tricks, including hustle pool, including be loved. He takes Cas's hand. "But you don't know everything."
, Sam!" Dean veers off the road. He drags Baby to a shaky halt on a scrub-edged swath of gravel just beyond the asphalt. Just a few yards away, the terrain drops off into a steep cliff; a battered wooden signpost labels the area as an Award-Winning Scenic Overlook. Dean barely registers it; his vision keeps whiting out with near-panic as his heart hammers against the cage of his ribs. Bile rises in his throat.
Castiel skims his hands upward, running them over Dean's shirt for a minute before curling his fingers under the hem and dragging it up to Dean's shoulders. Dean barely has time to shrug the whole thing off and fling it onto the floor before Castiel has his hands on Dean's biceps and is pulling him in, down,
"Cas," Dean rasps finally. The word ghosts out of him, barely audible. Then, "No. No, you can't be—he's not—he isn't—"
—to a standing position. Dean's legs give way almost as soon as his weight comes down on them; he stumbles heavily into Castiel, almost bringing them both down to the floor.
Cas's grip loosens and Dean feels his breath hitch abruptly. He's terrified, suddenly—afraid to open his arms, unclench his hands from Cas's coat. Afraid that this is some dream or memory or delusion. That if he lets go, Cas will vanish, smoke and memories on the wind. And Dean will be left, again.
Castiel stoops and halts the bottle's progress as it rolls across the cheap carpet. He twists the cap off and offers it back.
Dean turns to face Chuck, who is leaning against the Impala with his arms crossed, a pinched scowl contorting his features.
, Sam is there and he has a large metal trash can. Dean all but throws the lamprey-thing in and it contorts violently in the bottom of the bin, its body slapping against the sides.
"Thank you," says Castiel. This generosity is characteristic of Dean, who is always so conscious of all the small and vital details of survival, always wanting to provide for the people in his home however he can. Castiel runs a hand absent-mindedly along the edge of his desk. There's no dust on it, not even a slight layer, and Castiel has the sudden mental image of Dean cleaning the empty room, week after week with no hope of the occupant ever returning.
Castiel is so disoriented that he almost loses his footing, stumbling a little as his mind adjusts to its sudden jaunt into the dream space. This has never happened before—
Dean sighs and tugs fretfully at his amulet, the cool weight a familiar comfort against his fingertips. Well, why
Seated in the chair by the window, Castiel loses track of time. It's something Dean would have mocked him for once: the idea that Castiel could just sit quietly and allow time to pass as he waited for his next mission. He supposes he ought to be racking his brain for answers to the questions he has yet to resolve: why he can't heal Dean, how to contact Sam, when to leave this motel and head for the Bunker, if that's even the best place to go at the moment. It's easier, though, to just allow his thoughts to drift aimlessly. He watches the subtle movement of Dean's body, moving to the rhythm of his breathing, and the way the lamplight casts sharp shadows across the contours of his face. He thinks about the nights he'd allowed himself to confront the chance of never seeing Dean's face again.
Sam seems like he's tracking to the same conclusion, if his enormous eyes are anything to go by. His mouth has already settled into a grim line, like Sam's body has already identified and is reacting to the presence of danger, even if his mind hasn't caught up yet. “Something is wrong," he says, low and sure.
you came back, Cas?” Dean spits. “You think I care whether you’re here as an angel or a human or a goddamn force of nature? I fucking care that you’re alive! And I—I want you around, of
“You were good at that,” Dean says quietly to Sam, after the last of the fey leaves, the door good as new in their wake. Eileen and Cas are up on the landing, double-checking that all the warding is intact, Jack looking intently over their shoulders.
Dean swallows. The ravine, in Cas’s absence, is dead silent, and despite the warm sunlight Dean shivers suddenly. He looks over at the corona of ash still settling slowly into the cedar needles, where Cas had burnt the wendigo into nothing, just a moment ago. The charred odor of it, even from a few yards away, is suddenly too much—Dean can smell smoke, smell sulfur, smell blood. He puts a hand on his chest, where the skin is whole and unbroken, and feels a phantom rasp of agony under the muscle. The hellhounds are ripping flesh off his ribs—Alastair has him writhing like an insect, pinned to a lattice of bone—
hunger, the way his vessel did when it was human. It's foolish under any circumstances, and dangerous under these, when it's controlling him instead of the other way around, when it's making him
“Now,” Chuck is purring, and he almost seems to glow with barely restrained glee, “I believe we have another,
Sam gives a tight, cautious smile, which Dean supposes is as much as he can expect given the circumstances. Beside him, Eileen is wearing an identically wary expression—god, these two really are a pair, Dean thinks, half-fond, half-exasperated.
would you think that's something I'd want? And what the fuck gave you the idea that you had any right to—to—" He flings one hand toward the door, choking on the words.
, because Castiel recognizes him now. It's the dark-haired vampire from Dean's dream, the one who'd pinned Dean down and carved those terrible symbols into him. His hair is shorter, the close-cropped locks framing his face differently, subtly altering its shape, but his smile is just as mocking, his voice just as lilting. But that's impossible, it's
. He's saying words, too many words and too fast, but he doesn't know what they are, can't make sense of the garbled fragments his own mouth is trying to drag into shape.
"The story was a repeating pattern that restarted itself every time you broke its parameters." Michael glances off to the side. "Adam is...telling me not to bother trying to explain the metaphysics of it."
Cas is still lying on his side, his dark eyes peering up at Dean, his face wet with tears. He reaches up, the coils of darkness around his wrist and forearm shifting like black vines, and presses a hand against Dean's cheek.
Cas hauls Dean to his feet, and then Cas's fingers are out of Dean's mouth, and Cas's hand is on Dean's bare chest, pushing him back onto the hood of the Impala.
There's a long, fraught silence, and then Dean mutters something that sounds like a curse, followed by something about using the bathroom. He scoots off the bed, making for the side opposite Castiel even though it's farther, one hand holding the towel tightly around his waist. Castiel watches him go, watches the fluorescent bathroom lights flick on before the door swings closed, a physical barrier between him and Dean, one he finds himself grateful for at the moment. He feels in his pocket for the car keys.
of it was still there," says Jack, "it wasn't lost. But when I destroyed Michael, I burned off everything that...that made it
He doesn't know if he is praying. Dean is no angel, to hear his words. Or will he be able to hear prayers, now? Castiel thinks of Michael, ascending in a crescendo of grace and power, whipping like the heart of a star over their heads. And Dean, Dean turning to him at the last possible second, planting hope just as the faith which had always held Castiel steadfast to his side might finally be starting to wither—
"You aren't a victim," says Castiel. "You survived. What was done to you was—" He falters, overwhelmed by the atrocity of it all.
"Soulmates' names are written on the primary feathers," Cas says. His wings curve down over them, rain sluicing off the feathers, splashing onto Cas's hair, Dean's face. "I lost all mine when Metatron took my grace, that's why you can't see a name. But my wings were awakened. I had a name written, over and over—"
Dean tightens his grip on his own weapon. He can see all the vital points of Sam's body. All the places the blood rolls close to the skin. "Don't ask me that—" he says. "Don't—we have to remember—it's just us—"
Dean is certainly not breathing now, his mouth gaping desperately as he tries in vain to pull air into his lungs. The other two vampires crouch lower and pain explodes in both of Castiel's arms simultaneously as two sets of phantom teeth sink into the meat of Dean's arms. He scrambles over a gutted pickup blocking his path and at the same time he is on the floor with Dean, arching his back and fighting for enough air to scream.
vampires," Castiel says. He narrows his eyes. "But you're not just a vampire, are you." Pieces start falling into place. "You resurrected yourself. The sigils, the fire. You're a witch."
"I just think you should maybe come up here," says Jody. "I mean, if you aren't busy. I'm assuming we have some time before the next apocalypse, so. Yeah. If you want to swing by, or something, Dean. He's here."
The vampire leans to the side, out of Dean's—and Castiel's—field of vision. The vampires feeding on him raise their heads and shift their grips, letting the blood continue to run down Dean's arms unchecked. "You're gonna want to shut your eyes, sweetheart."
It’s nearly his height, but a lot less bulky, and he manages to duck past the blade, grab it by the shoulder, and hip-check it into the nearest wall before spinning to parry a slice from yet another elf-thing. It’s complete and utter pandemonium in the war room; he catches glimpses of Sam and Cas wrestling with a pair of squat bearded beings in leaf armor, and in a corner Jack is clobbering a wispy sprite-creature over the head with what looks like the left gable of his gingerbread house.
Dean seems pleased with the clothes Castiel picked out, and disappears into the bathroom to change. Castiel sorts through the frozen meals, now well on their way to being unfrozen, and squats in front of the motel's tiny minifridge to stow them away. He hadn't considered the fact that the freezer portion would be so cramped, and trying to sequester every meal package feels rather like a logic problem with no solution. He's huffing in frustration and trying to jam a container of half-thawed sweet-and-sour meatballs into a corner when Dean comes back out of the bathroom, smoothing wrinkles out of his flannel. He has Castiel's coat draped over one arm.
Six months, and now this. Castiel slips his blade back into his sleeve and begins to move cautiously through the campsite, stepping around the felled vampires that not long ago had been walking and talking and planning their next kill.
“It makes a certain kind of sense,” Cas says. “Chuck was, after all, the original writer of the universe, the one who was scripting out our lives. With him gone, there isn’t really a pre-written destiny for anyone, anymore. Only the one we each write for ourselves.”
"It's like—" He gestures vaguely. "It's something light. Shallow. Something you read at the beach because you want something easy, and then you never think about it again." He swallows and reaches for his beer to cover up the sting of memory because
"I know," says Castiel. He knows, he knows. He wasn't made for Heaven; he was made for this. He wants to fall and fall again, until there is nothing he knows so well as the man underneath him. "I love you, too."
There's a figure standing near the far intersection, on the corner of the block, their face hidden by shadow. Dean tenses. “Something we should be worried about?” he mutters tersely to Michael, not taking his eyes away from whatever the hell this new calamity is.
Cas is moving closer, speaking softly: gentle, lovely words that cut through the rhythmic clanging of Billie's fist against the warding. And all Dean can think is that he's so, so wrong.
The interior of the trailer is dark and dusty and smells like blood and bitter fear. Castiel steps inside, moving past a sagging sofa, setting his feet down carefully around scattered beer bottles.
"Don't," Dean says, craning his neck to stare sightlessly in the direction of the vampire. His voice cracks. "Don't,
Dean stares at Castiel for a moment and then exhales, the fight draining visibly out of him. His soul settles, though it still pulses with muted bronzes and reds.
. G-E-T. Y-O-U. O-U-T. Dean is utterly motionless beneath him, his head lifted as if he's trying to listen for the sound of the letters.
Castiel reaches out with his free hand and presses his palm against Dean's forehead. He waits to see the injuries fade, the torn skin knitting itself back together, but the rush of his grace is blocked by—
Dean barely manages to roll onto his side before he’s retching emptily, his lungs seizing up as his whole body contracts around the shudder in his chest.
"I'm going to drink from you now, Dean," Corin says, speaking slowly and clearly, as if to a child. "Just to remind you who you really belong to."
Dean thrashes, slamming his head against the edge of the sofa as he tries to roll onto his side. His mouth parts in soundless terror as he pants for breath.
“I...” Jack says. At least he’s stopped trying to back out of the room. He moves a few steps closer and then just stops in the middle of the kitchen, his arms hanging awkwardly by his sides. “I didn’t want to bother you.”
"Sure," says Dean. "Fine. Membrane dimension, whatever. You gonna tell us what the hell is going on?"
"Fuck off, Raz." Castiel rasps. He's too tired, and seeing Dean this close—the lines of his face, the green of his eyes—it's too hard.
Shiv backhands him across the face as he struggles to sit up. The blow splits his lip and knocks him back to the floor. His head strikes the stone hard, making his vision flashes white for an instant. Blood oozes in a thin trickle down his chin.
Dean remembers Chuck burning Michael to smithereens, that blistering pillar of fire by the shore. Remembers, too, that Adam had already been long gone. Exterminated. But that—had been a lie, he reminds himself. Chuck’s false narrative. Maybe Michael really had escaped Chuck’s purging of the Earth, and saved Adam as well, somehow.
"Don't look at them—they're not—they're—" His wings flare momentarily, as if in agitation, and Dean can't help it; his eyes track the movement automatically, riveted by the way the feathers closest to the top of the wing seem to shimmer as they move.
"Hey." Dean crouches next to Sam, grips his shoulders. Terror curls up and down his spine, because in truth,
, Sam." His heart is a raw, flayed thing. He thinks of Cas's face, upturned, shining with tears. Thinks of the way the Empty had gleamed and writhed, as it absorbed Cas and turned him into nothingness.
Sammy would go and develop a soft spot for the angel who was Heaven's original fall guy. But in other moments he watches color return little by little to Sam's face, watches Sam pause absently in the middle of a task and crack a smile at nothing at all, listens to the way Sam's voice goes soft at the edges when he says Gadreel's name, and he's glad.
"No," says Dean. Inexplicably, he has the bizarre urge to laugh, even though he also feels very much like crying. "No, we probably couldn't have."
“Oh, these are going to go great with the Christmas sweaters,” Sam crows, holding up his socks, which are emblazoned with tiny snowmen.
Dean doesn't complain, though; he's too grateful not only for Gadreel's presence slowly repairing the subatomic damage that the Trials dealt to Sam, but also for the fact that Sam didn't lay him out flat after waking up and immediately realizing that he wasn't the only one inside his own head. One heated shouting match—
and then he's off, the wound in his back bubbling a dark red, the rebar scarlet all the way down its vicious length.
The remaining tendril of the Empty reverses course in midair and dives at them. Dean puts one hand on the back of Cas's head and pulls it toward him, tucking it under his chin.
There's a figure huddled at the far end of the trailer, below a metal rail that's been affixed to the wall at about waist height. Castiel pulls to a halt a few feet away, his mouth going dry. He barely hears the clatter of his blade hitting the floor. He can see perfectly in the dark. He knows who he's looking at.
. It should be enough just to know that Cas is alive, out there in the world, not rotting in a void dimension because he died to save Dean’s skin yet again. But god, Dean’s selfish. He doesn’t want to do this without Cas. Even if it cuts at him, he doesn’t want this hollow victory where freedom means he never sees Cas again. He’ll—when they get back, if Cas is still there, Dean'll apologize for being weird about it. Maybe, if he’s not weird, if he doesn't turn this into a
They get a motel for the night. Dean burrows under the covers—it's chilly in the room, not much better than the damp night outside—and listens to Sam’s breathing even out in the other bed. They’ve been heading vaguely west and he traces out the map in his mind, thinking. Maybe they’ll skirt north a little, head up toward Washington. Change of scenery. Maybe all the way to the coast. That’d be two, maybe three days’ driving. Or find some cabin by a lake somewhere, take it easy for a couple of days.
He sees, too, that the sigils have been carved more than once; in parts the lines are ragged where the knife varied slightly in retracing the pattern.
They stop at a diner and Dean could swear the greasy, ordinary fare tastes better than usual. Maybe it’s because they came so close to, well, no more of
"Door's behind me," he snaps, and hopes they don't call his bluff, because no way can he and Sam take them all at once. "Get out. All of you. You're free, so take your chance while you can."
"And in the forest," says Cas, slowly and clearly. "And on the tops of mountains, and in the dunes of the desert, and in open fields in winter. And in storms, and under clear skies, and before battle, when it's courage I need, and after battle, when it's peace I want. And in all places that I have loved, and in whatever place I dared to call home at any given moment."
Castiel rolls over, putting his back to Raz. "Torture me if you will, but otherwise, leave me alone," he snaps at the far wall. He closes his eyes, expecting the creak of the cell door any minute, followed by some burst of pain, but after a long silence there is only the sound of Raz's footsteps, fading away down the corridor.
Raz looks irritated to be ignored, and he slaps his hand down on the next sigil. Castiel chokes on nothing at all, reaching up to claw at his own throat. Then, as Raz proceeds through the remaining symbols, he is able to breathe again, sucking in a huge gasp just in time for a wave of magically-induced nausea to make him double over, gagging. The last symbol drills into his head until light explodes in his vision and he collapses to the damp stone floor. As he loses consciousness, he can see the demon grinning at him, green eyes switching to black, easy as anything.
"Well, why the hell did you? Why d'you always have to be so noble?" Dean demands. "Why couldn't you be selfish for once? Why didn't you just
He tumbles into the bed, fully-clothed, and is asleep almost immediately despite the scratchy sheets and fairly anemic heating. He doesn’t dream that night, either.
He's stammering, his heart clenching inside his chest, and Sam just keeps looking at him with those huge sad eyes, and Dean's sick of it. He's
"Killed you?" Dean says, his voice hollow. "And you knew that, didn't you? You were just going to—die, and leave me there?"
Castiel remembers the vampire in question—a gangly man with long hair and a face set in a perpetual sneer. Castiel had cut his throat as he tried to rise from his place by the campfire.
Sam shivers, though not from the freezing rain that he can't feel. "I can't even imagine," he says honestly.
, Dean would like very much to sit here and continue this for a lot longer. Unfortunately, he is also, as he reminds himself with tremendous mental effort, technically still on a hunt.
“What are they arguing about?” Dean says to Sam under his breath, trying to leverage the argument as a distraction, since he can’t get an actual assist from Cas. “C’mon, put some of those sign language lessons to work.”
"Dean—" Cas wheezes as he lands hard on his back, as Dean comes down on top of him. The metallic coil of the Empty whooshes over their heads with a sound like cracking lake ice. "What—"
His hand, halfway to his mouth with the plastic spoon, trembles a little, and Castiel watches droplets of chicken broth splash back into the container.
Fuck. Dean hadn’t meant to say it. Hadn’t meant to let it slip out. He swallows, tries to stammer through a recovery. “I—we need your help. Sam—there’s some hikers who got hurt, he's trying to get them to the road. Will you—will you help?” He fights to keep the note of pleading out of his voice. He doesn’t want Cas to go. God help him, he knows Cas was never his to begin with and certainly isn’t now, but he doesn’t want Cas to go.
Castiel knows exactly what Dean was about to ask, and he also knows he doesn't have an answer for that question. After he carries Dean back to the bed, he hesitates, then pulls out his phone and dials. Sam's mailbox is full, not that he'd returned Castiel's calls before that happened. Castiel tries a few backup numbers, even though he knows there's no point.
He shuffles awkwardly in place, aware that he's standing in a muddy puddle that's slowly seeping into his boots.
"How's Eileen?" he asks, to distract Sam from the topic, and to distract himself from the gnawing pit of anxiety in his stomach. Something flutters under his ribs.
There's a brief but distinct pause. "I, uh," says Jody, and her voice sounds strange, like she isn't sure whether she's delivering good or bad news. "I think you guys should get up here."
"It's not up to you, sweetheart. You leave, we'll just find you, bring you back, and cut some of your parts off. But just in case, let's see how eager you are to escape when you can't see where you're going."
"Hey, shh," says Dean. He wraps his arms around his brother, presses his hands against Sam's shoulder blades. He thinks about Sam left behind in the Bunker, maintaining the spell while...god, while having to hold Dean's body up, most likely. "It's okay, Sammy. We're okay."
Castiel didn't really expect that, but he supposes he shouldn't be surprised. The Winchesters are nothing if not stubborn.
"Sure I can't get you anything else, hon?" says the server brightly. She'd raised her eyebrows when he'd requested just fries and now seems determined to sell him on something more substantial. "We got a great burger."
it? That you aren't a part of it? Well, you are. And the world exists according to a cosmic balance that
Relief surges through Dean, a crashing wave that makes his hands tremble suddenly. "Cas—?" He manages to reach up, manages to touch Cas's face. Cas is warm under his palm. Solid. Real.
, really, so many tiny sharp hopes, so many sweet staccato flashes of love and wanting, that it's almost overwhelming. But not in a bad way.
So he waves the server back over and asks for a box for the fries, and a burger and a slice of pie to go. He pays and tips the fries clumsily into the styrofoam container she brings him, already thinking ahead to the way Dean's eyes will light up when he sees the pie. Castiel will think of some kind of excuse for running out, something more believable than supplies for his truck, and Dean will enjoy the pie and maybe things will be a little better in the morning.
Dean looks at Cas through the gold motes of dust floating through the interior of the shed, and his heart hammers itself against his ribs with the same mixture of awe and fondness that he always feels, watching Cas. And with something more, too: a warm and winged thing, an awareness of something possible, immense and delicate and just within reach.
Castiel stretches out, folding his hands underneath his chin. Dean climbs onto his back, shoving the blankets aside so that he can straddle Castiel. Castiel exhales under Dean's weight; he resists the urge to press back into Dean, to flip them both over and pin Dean to the mattress. Dean's touch, his hands brushing against feathers on their way to the bandages, make him shiver. "
—in the thirty seconds before peacing out of existence and leaving Dean with—nothing. An empty room, and a mind blank with shock, and that cold feeling of panic tightening like a vise around his lungs.
Cas still looks mystified, which is fair. Dean supposes there's a lot of embedded cultural nuance here.
, listen—" Dean is holding Castiel's face urgently between his two hands, leaning in, raising his voice over Castiel's frantic pleading. "It's okay, it's
Raz is the last to leave. "The old King had a bit of a soft spot for you, Castiel," he says, pausing at the cell door as his companions vanish down the torch-lit corridor. "The new King has no such weakness. Trust me, beyond keeping you alive, we have no constraints. Think about that."
Castiel nods, glancing up at Dean as he shrugs out of his coat and suit jacket. He doesn't have a duffel to drop onto the bed the way he's seen Dean and Sam do countless times during or after hunts. His room looks as he'd left it, down to the book on the nightstand. A little lived-in, a little lonesome. It's comforting, almost.
"I don't want to hurt you," Castiel says, and there it is again, that gentle earnestness, and Dean's heart experiences a sweet pang entirely separate from the baser sensations preoccupying his dick.
Castiel lifts two fingers to Dean's brow, hoping he can do this much even if his healing is blocked. Dean swallows, his jaw trembling, his hands knotted together in front of him.
“Got Jody on the line,” Sam calls, popping his head into the kitchen. Dean turns down the heat on the potatoes and follows the sound of loud chatter back into the war room, where the map table is a mess of popcorn strings and gingerbread shrapnel.
"Heya, Cas," he says easily. He trades his empty beer for a fresh one. He's been drinking a little more than he should for a quiet night in (but he just got his indestructible liver back, so sue him) and there's a pleasant warmth suffusing his limbs.
." Dean's voice rises in pitch, breaking at the end of the word. "Cas you said you killed them all you said you SAID—"
“You want me to say it again?” Cas's voice drops impossibly lower, almost a snarl. The sunlight turns his eyes a blazing crystalline color, like they might start snapping sparks at any minute. “I love you. I love you, Dean Winchester. It
"I'm sorry," says the angel, looking contrite. "I didn't mean to let the memories spill over like that, into you."
"You're not going to break me," Castiel breathes into Dean's mouth, and the next thing Dean knows Castiel is kissing him back, hard, their teeth clinking briefly together before Castiel's tongue is licking its way into his mouth. Castiel's mouth is soft and his tongue is a reaching,
“Maybe...two days, to the coast? Pace we’re going?” Dean shrugs. “No rush, right?” They have the rest of their lives to live out however they want. How long has it been since some huge world-ending terror wasn’t looming them, overshadowing the future? Dean can’t even remember. Maybe they’ll redecorate the Bunker when they get back. Turn it into a friggin’ bed-and-breakfast. Hell, maybe he’ll learn to make croissants or something.
Cas is curled on his side, his eyes closed. There are dark tendrils winding around his forearms and ankles, like this...this
. He frowns, pushes harder, but it's useless. Dean's body shuts out his grace like a ring of holy fire, refusing it, refusing to heal.
"Yes, of course," says Castiel, who doesn't have any attention of asking for it back. "That was upfront payment."
"You can't be here," says Dean. A tear drips from his chin. He's crying. How long has he been crying for? "You're dead."
"They're not...presentable," he mutters, resisting the urge to tuck his face into Dean's neck. He can't imagine what the wings must have looked like when he'd first manifested them in the parking lot, without the shielding mercy of all this gauze. Tattered, mangled things, even before Corin's fire had infected them.
“I’ll find them,” Cas assures him. A shaft of the afternoon sunlight glances over his ring, makes it flash like a dewdrop of white fire. Dean drops his eyes. Suddenly he can’t bear it—the thought that Cas will find Sam and heal the campers and then vanish off to Death’s—
Castiel reasons to himself that the more environmental factors he can make familiar, the more normal Dean will feel. So he picks out clothes as close to Dean's normal attire as he can find, and even though he's purchased a few frozen meals he also stops by a drive-thru and gets a cheeseburger and fries. When he steps back over the threshold of the motel room with the greasy paper bag tucked into the crook of his arm, the space is immediately filled with the smell of hot food and cooking oil.
Dean lets out something that might be a breath, and might be a sob, and might be a word. He curls one hand into the fabric of Cas's stupid coat. He presses the other against the side of Cas's face, leans forward to touch their foreheads together. "Yeah, Cas. Yeah, I—yeah."
Dean stares down at him. "You got yourself out," he says, wonderingly. "And you found us, and you—and I—Cas, you shouldn't have

"We'll definitely be there," says Charlie. Dean shoots her a glare, and she shrugs back at him, her face still split with a mischievous grin.
"I think I loved you," says Dean. He watches a spasm of shock cross Cas's face, watches it crumple like a house of falling cards.
Dean doesn't move. He still has his head bent, his arms extended awkwardly over his head, his breath coming harsh and ragged. Castiel tips his head to peer up at the manacles, and grits his teeth in anger as he takes in the irregular rows of puncture marks scattered liberally across Dean's forearms and wrists. How long have the vampires been feeding on him? How long did they have him chained up like an animal, in the dark? What have they done to him, that he doesn't even recognize Castiel?

"I got my own ride," she tells him when he starts to gesture at the passenger side. "I know that motel—it's a
When Castiel opens his eyes it is to featureless nothing, a dim grey stretching on forever. He immediately closes them again. So this is it, then. He's dead.
"So...what?" says Dean, and he registers with painful clarity that his heart is suddenly skipping a beat, that there's an abrupt swell of panic making his throat close up. "You...you didn't mean it?"
furiously tidy up Cas’s already painfully sparse bedroom for no reason since its former owner certainly no longer needs it.
Castiel conjures up the memory of that younger Dean, angrier and yet somehow softer, less ravaged by the world. The insolent lilt of his voice right before he'd plunged a knife into Castiel's chest. "I don't think I picked up on that. At the time."
Dean thinks he can, sort of, see another version of himself, some past iteration of his psyche, taking this differently. A world diverging from this timeline like a tributary off of a river. There's a world, a path, an option, in which the
He only sees them for a moment, and then Cas whirls, putting his back to the counter as his horrified eyes find Dean's face, resting on the glasses there.
Castiel has crouched humble and lowly before the Host of heaven, and he has been drained dry and cast down to Earth by the Metatron, and he has felt Lucifer's crushing grip grind him into slow oblivion, but nothing has ever made him feel as small and helpless as the way his pleas bounced off Dean's determined gaze.
?" says Cas bluntly, and there's suddenly something very close to fury blazing in his eyes. "To disregard what
he might have the mental capacity to be unreasonably annoyed by this, because what the hell is this job entailing such that Cas always looks like he’s just extricated himself from a hurricane-force gale.
"They're going to kill you," Dean moans. He shakes his head limply on the pillow. His hand drags free of the sheets and tangles itself in the fabric of Castiel's coat. "Please, Cas, they'll make me watch."
“I will see all of you again, I’m sure,” says Michael. His hands have found their way into his pockets yet again. Dean has a mental image of Michael holding court in Heaven like this, wrinkled green jacket and everything, amid a sea of suited angels.
Dean meets Castiel's gaze and his expression hardens. He looks away, hitching the towel higher with one hand, until the knobs of his hips are obscured.
Dean coughs and nods and sucks in more air, tears squeezing out of his eyes as he struggles to inhale through a half-crushed windpipe. The vampire runs a hand down Dean's bleeding cheek and says, almost gently, "We're going to keep you forever, Dean. No more running, alright? Just focus on keeping that sweet blood of yours pumping. You'll last us decades."
Castiel doesn't say anything. Dean's cheek still rests on his palm, Dean's weight pressing down on his fingers.
been, all this time? He tries to fight through the spasm of fear and panic that's making his hands shake, but some kind of frantic clamor is starting up inside his head, drowning out every coherent thought with a ceaseless cacophony of
Sam stands outside the Impala, stretching for a moment before he slides in behind the wheel. “How much longer to Washington, do you think?”
He grips Dean's wrist as tightly as he dares, a fresh burst of anger curling in his chest as he looks down at Dean's arm, notices again the long rows of puncture marks, some of them heavily infected, and the raw lacerations peeping out from beneath the dangling cuff.
“Oh,” says Antennae, their face clearing, “you’re speaking of She-of-the-Rainwater-Brook-under-Oak-Leaves-in-the-Summerlight-of-Noon,” and they turn around and burble something indecipherable to the other fey, all of whom relax immediately.
"Uh—good," says Sam. He cracks a smile, a real one, something soft and tender that makes Dean's heart ache. "A little confused about where her car went. But she's okay."
Cas is standing in the middle of the structure, bent over a paper-strewn table. Sunshine is slanting in from the gaps in the roof and lighting up his hair, turning it white-gold at the edges. It limns him in radiance; he glows with it, warm and alive and solid and real.
"Please!" Cas screams suddenly, the word cracking midway through. Dean looks up just in time to see Cas's eyes fly open, pointed sightlessly at the ceiling. "
“Well, then,” says Dean. He can feel his pulse quickening, his worry tamped down by the prospect of a plan, a course of action. If Cas wants to leave them, that’s nothing new. That’s
"I just need to drop off the food," says Castiel hastily, lifting the bag from the diner. He can hear the low hum of the TV from inside the door. "And explain. He's not going to be expecting—er, you."
On his knees, Castiel pulls his wings close around him, as far from Raz as he can. It's not enough. "Please," he repeats, a ragged gasp.
. Driving your stupid little car on a highway with no end, having the same tired conversations and letting your thoughts carve grooves into your little skulls—

Sorry for the delay in posting this chapter, everyone! I've been trying to stick with a two week schedule but life has been hectic as anything lately and so I had to let an extra week slip by.
Dean feels his pulse mounting. He knocks his knuckles against Sam's wrist, soft enough for it to be unnoticed by anyone else. His heart is in his mouth.
"Okay, okay, hold still." Dean's fingers work nimbly at the bandages, unspooling the gauze in a long strip. Then he stops suddenly. Castiel hears a sharp intake of breath.
"It's not your abilities I'm worried about," says Cas quietly. He studies his hands where they rest, flat, on the table.
to do anything," says Cas, visibly pained. He looks at the ground again and Dean watches his hands curl into fists. "I
But when he shines his phone carefully at Cas's torso, there it is again, something large shifting under Cas's skin, distending his stomach as it goes.
It only takes a few seconds for Michael to claim his true vessel, but Castiel hears the thrum and howl of it long after Dean has vanished. He stares at the empty space where Dean had unfurled archangel's wings, feels the phantom stroke of Dean's hands leaving his face. Raises his own fingers, slowly, to touch his lips, where the taste of Dean's soul still seems to linger—his imagination, surely, this whispery remnant, the way his mouth remembers that torrent of jade and silver, cinnamon and smoke and autumn light.
"Alright, then," says Dean quietly. He kisses Cas again, gently, quickly enough that he misses the mark just a little and it lands against the corner of Cas's mouth. "Well—" A sudden surge of shyness leaves him tongue-tied, just for a moment. "—well, are you going to come home with us, you idiot?"
Dean's pupils are blown wide, a thin white ring showing around his irises as he struggles for breath, folded almost double as he is by the vampire's grip. Corin shifts his grip and actually
Dean holds his breath, reaching up slowly with one hand to lay it against the most uninjured spot he can find. Cas makes the tiniest hitching sound in the back of his throat, his eyes still determinedly fixed on the ground. The feathers feel silk-soft under Dean's palm, the rain running in cold rivulets down from the wing to drip onto his shoulder.
"Yeah, one of the vamps was a smoker. Blonde fucker. Had a stupid goatee, at least he did last I saw before they—" Dean makes an abortive gesture towards his face, his jaw tightening.
how many sub-levels under the narrative we are now? The quantum mechanics of it would blow your little monkey brain to smithereens."
Some time later, something clicks in Sam's head and he pulls back, catching his breath, letting his hands drop from the sides of Gadreel's face. Thunder rumbles far-off in the sky, but the storm is beginning to lessen, the rain becoming lighter.
Dean inhales sharply, and looks at Castiel for the first time since uncovering the sigils. "So then—"
"You're fucking welcome," says Dean. It doesn't come out the way he intends it—it comes out low, furious, angry. He hates himself for it immediately.
His voice dies mid-sentence, his mouth working soundlessly even as his face drains of color. Tiny curls of darkness leak down from his lash line, tracing their way over his face like tears.
"You won't," he says, and tugs Castiel's fingers off his hips, twining them with his own as he sinks
"He might have returned to the Bunker," Castiel offers, though he remembers the set of Sam's jaw when he'd left, and doubts it. "We should return to it, once you feel ready to leave."
. You walk out a door again, we'll find you and we'll cut all the skin off your arms and lick your blood straight off the muscle."
Dean isn't on the bed when Castiel returns, arms laden with bags, and for a moment Castiel experiences a sharp jolt of panic. Then he registers the shape huddled on the floor, wedged tightly between the bed and the bedside table. It's Dean, eyes huge and dark in the lamplight, arms wrapped around his knees.
"Goddamn right," Dean growls. "I can't fucking believe you. Jumping through that fire—the fuck were you thinking?"
“It will.” Cas rests his chin on Dean’s shoulder. “You are a very good baker. One of your many talents.”
"If it helps," says Raz off-handedly, "you can pretend I'm Dean." He drops his hand onto the curve of Castiel's left wing, gripping a fistful of burned nerve endings and torn feathers, and twists.
that Dean wanted, of course, it never was, and for Castiel to feel desire in this moment was just as foolish as every other moment of longing in which he'd indulged in the past—is what had led him to recoil, letting Dean fall heavily back onto the mattress, his head narrowly missing the headboard. Castiel had barely noticed in his haste to get off the bed, to get away from the almost irresistible pull of Dean's gravity, the dangerous throb of that dark blue undertow.
take the time to split hairs, even in a fucking hallucination. "But Dean, this is real, I promise you."
Cherry's expression softens a little. "Listen, hon. That was a sweet thing you tried to do for your friend, okay? Not your fault I wasn't his type."
Dean sets the blade down on the edge of the table, because his other hand needs to stay free to—god, to hold back the flap of muscle and skin he's peeled away from Cas's torso. The pale monster slithers and twists in Cas, moving endlessly,
it is new. He cocks a brazen eyebrow at Cas. Thinks to himself that all his bravado is probably wasted since Cas can probably hear and feel his fluttering pulse. “You’ll stay for the ride? Write yourself into my book?”
Dean. He is looking out of Dean's eyes at the smirk of the vampire on top of him, feeling the sharp ache of bruises blooming on his ribs, where the vampires had kicked him into submission—the memory blips through the dream like a flashback—earlier, on the deserted road half a mile from the camp, when they had caught up with him. He'd tried to run and they'd found him. They'd found him so
It's the street corner he’d seen glimpses of, at the edge of the highway, and then again in that motel hallway—the liminal space, Michael had called it. The spot where they first tried to offer Chuck their surrender. A cool breeze raises goosebumps on his arms; streetlights flicker behind Chuck, backlighting his thunderous expression. Dean sags against the Impala. The hood is still warm against the back of his legs.
Dean blinks and looks away and for a moment Castiel thinks he's going to brush this off too, say something else flippant and move on. Then he looks back at Castiel and says, low, "It's stupid."
Dean swallows hard, trying to block out the sound. He steels himself and slowly, carefully, he starts to pull. The thing in his hand wriggles as he gradually reels it out, wincing at the knowledge of what it must be doing to Cas. He has to fight the desire to haul it out hand over hand, get it out of his friend as fast as possible—god knows what the thing could be wrapped around, in there. Sam isn't looking anymore; his head is bent, his mouth by Cas's ear, lips moving, whatever he's whispering inaudible over the sounds of Cas's frantic agony.
"Was it my name?" Dean says cheekily, and then pulls Cas back down for another kiss, to show he doesn't need the answer. But Cas resists unexpectedly, bracing his palms against the ground on either side of Dean's head and staring down with those piercing, brilliantly blue eyes. Like he's looking at Dean's soul,
Dean's feet hit solid ground, Sam's arm a warm anchor point under his palm. He blinks his eyes open and staggers back, feeling his calves bump against familiar metal.
There's a clearing here, big enough that it doesn't feel claustrophobic, but the treeline is still near enough and dense enough that it feels hidden. Private. When Dean gets out of the Impala and walks toward the water's edge, he can smell pines and the damp scent that wind always carries near water.
having a phone. Certainly not more absurd than the Darkness wandering around their house and leaving bowls of soggy cornflakes in the sink. Still. He thinks about Cas pulling a fucking smartphone out of that black leather coat. Sending...fucking emojis or whatever to Sam and Jack. A lump rises in his throat, and he doesn’t quite know why.
Castiel be smug? Being the most popular guy in school has its perks. Castiel could have any guy he wants—probably any girl he wants, too, not that Castiel makes any secret of

Sam twists to stare at him, phone lifted in one hand, face streaked and blotchy with tears. Castiel goes cold all over—he can only think of one thing to make Sam Winchester weep like that.
He swallows past the lump in his throat and opens his mouth to snap that if she's telling the truth, then Cas was a moron for wasting his grace. Not like a bust kidney would've killed her kind, so he wasn't saving her life. But another one of the prisoners is speaking now, tugging their tattered collar down to show their throat.
Castiel runs; Dean struggles. Castiel is dodging around derelict vehicles and simultaneously straining against the hands that keep him spread helplessly on the linoleum.
, he thinks drowsily. He remembers Chuck’s pitiful groveling and a smile twitches the corner of his lips. Maybe he’ll dream about it tonight, relish the moment all over again.
"You—you can't," Dean says hoarsely. He blinks away a blurry film of tears. "You can't come to Earth without being summoned."
Castiel's cry of alarm is drowned out by Dean's choked-off shout, and the crash of the lawn chair tipping over as Dean tumbles out of it. He is thrashing in panic, his eyes round with shock and horror. The dream-Castiel follows Dean down to the weather-beaten wood of the dock, pinning him with its weight, one hand closed inexorably around Dean's throat.
"You are infuriating," Castiel says, and leans in close to kiss him. Dean sighs, his body relaxing instantly. He opens his mouth hungrily around Castiel's and Castiel breathes a spark of grace into him, sending it to Dean's hands and the still-raw wound at his neck. Dean gasps a little and reaches out to clutch at Castiel's shoulders and drag him still closer. Dean is shirtless too, Castiel discovers to his satisfaction as he pushes the covers out of the way; he wraps his arms around Dean, slots a thigh between Dean's knees. His left wing arches overhead, the feathers splaying.
Dean surprises himself with the laugh that bubbles up from him. He thinks he's only heard himself make that exact laugh when he's around Cas. "It was a compliment. All the best people I know are idiots."
It unbalances him; he stumbles, mid-blow, and the last vampire ducks around his blade and lunges for his throat, its needle-like teeth bared. Castiel sidesteps and catches the creature solidly on the forehead with his open hand, smiting it into oblivion as it careens past.
"Oh." Castiel blinks down at Dean. He slowly lowers himself onto his side to lie next to Dean. Lets one arm stay draped over Dean's chest, avoiding the release cooling on Dean's skin. "I'll fix it."
Dean enters the room, but he doesn't cross to the dresser to set the clothes down. Instead, he walks directly up to Castiel, so close he doesn't even have to reach out to pass the bundle over.
, and he can't do it. He's a coward and always has been but maybe Cas can be brave for both of them, one more time. "I need you to
"Yeah, thanks, that's fine with us," says Dean. Sam, the fucking nerd, has the audacity to look slightly disappointed. "Can you fucking get us out?"
There’s a sudden, subsonic shiver that runs through the night, passes through him like a tidal sweep of sun-warmed air. And the world...changes. There’s sound, motion, vibrancy. The rustle of some small animal ducking into deeper shadow. Dean breaks away from Cas’s gaze and pivots on the spot, staring at the moths flitting greedily around the streetlight’s pale glow, the cars suddenly gliding through the nearest intersection, the people locking up their stores for the night as though it’s only an ordinary evening in Lebanon, and not the day the world nearly ended.
Castiel closes the distance so fast that it feels as though he doesn't even take steps. He bowls the vampires off of Dean, their bodies suddenly weightless and insubstantial, and presses his palm against Dean's forehead. The trailer dissolves around them, blown apart as Castiel shreds the nightmare to hazy fragments.
Raz grins, a boyish expression that makes him look, for a moment, even more like Dean. "Wanna know why that is? It's because Asmodeus has your phone. Every time your boys call, he just slaps on his best Castiel voice and throws 'em off the scent."
Castiel starts to avert his eyes but finds them snagging on Dean's bare legs, the way the trenchcoat is rucked over the sharp angle of Dean's right hip. Dean is propping himself on one elbow now, still half-turned away from Castiel as he pulls the hem of the coat down to cover—
—Dean'll hear Jack’s voice floating out of the library sometimes, or catch sight of Jack rounding the corner ahead of him, or see Jack’s empty cereal bowls littering the sink. You’d think a deity could just snap their fingers and magick their stupid dishes clean, but nope, Jack is just as much of slob about dishes as Cas is—well. Was.
Sam takes a step forward, his breath hitching. "So—all of that—Lucifer, Michael, Jack draining your power—"
Dean tries to remind himself regularly that they saved the world, or at least helped. He reminds himself that Chuck is gone—that he’s
Dean's back is still arched, his chest heaving, throat bared as he rests his head against the linoleum floor. Castiel can see bruises mottling Dean's skin, and an ugly, mostly-healed gash along the side of his neck, as if a vampire got greedy and tried to rip open an artery.
Eileen blows a strand of hair out of her face and pokes at Cas’s wrapping paper disgrace. “I need to show you how to make an accordion fold,” she laughs, hands flitting demonstratively through the air. Her phone lights up, interrupting her. “Oh—the tree’s ready for us to pick up, Sam.”
"I could. But I'd rather not." Now it's his turn to hesitate. "They aren't a pleasant sight, these days." He doesn't feel like trying to put into words the shame of it, the revulsion he feels towards his own form.
Dean wraps his hands around the steamy cardboard sleeve and sighs happily. Shitty gas station coffee, best way to start a morning on the road. “Nah, didn’t dream at all.”
Cas peers up at him, squinting again. His bangs are plastered to his forehead and his mouth has a confused quirk that makes Dean want to kiss it. "You're not...you don't hate them? You don't think I'm—" His forehead creases and he drops his eyes from Dean again.
of it had left in him. Dean's soul reverberates like a struck bell, half-obscured by a patina of pain and fear but radiant nonetheless, as bright as it was the day Castiel first saw it, burning like a star in Hell's caverns. Castiel catches his breath and wonders at how it could ever have been hidden from him.
"—but I have to say it now," Sam pleads, looking up at Dean, "because I need you to know that it doesn't—that I don't—that it doesn't matter to me. It doesn't—it doesn't make me think
Dean makes a small, hiccupping noise, and any fire that had sparked under Castiel's skin dies out instantly. He can't imagine anything less sexual than this situation.
“We should go find Sam,” he sighs into the side of Cas’s face, where a hint of stubble is just barely discernible.
I'm so very sorry for all the long delays between updates, PLEASE forgive my irregular posting schedule and my snail's writing pace.

in Cas’s eyes, and it makes—it makes his chest hurt more, makes the longing worse, makes it bite deeper—
—had just stood. He realizes that he’s tensing without meaning to, bracing for a blinding flash, for some torrent of light and sound. Almost on instinct, he runs through the list in his mind. Cas. Bobby, Charlie, Donna, Jody, Eileen. It goes on and on. He remembers them all. The grief still aches in the space under his ribs.
"Cas," Dean manages once more, and then he comes, hips juddering up from the hood, his mouth open against Cas's jaw.
"Yeah, well, your endings are shit," says Dean. He closes his hand around Sam's arm and they step backwards off the cliff.
, he thinks dizzily, as Sam steps over Raz's corpse and reaches for Castiel's other arm. Raz is gone. The Winchesters came for him.
There are no gaps now. Instead, intermingled with his own dark pinions are feathers of iridescent silver, catching the light and reflecting it as dark glints of rainbowy color, an echo of the faint residue of Dean's soul still wreathing the rest of the wing with its soft aura.
Dean feels his legs give way. He buckles against the table, holding himself up, his mind going blank with overwhelming relief as Cas's fingers spasm with sudden life, as Cas's eyes flutter open and sharpen into focus.
They don't retreat, but they don't step back, either. It's disconcerting, how they're all staring—their faces solemn, their hands at their sides. They might almost be keeping vigil. Dean doesn't like the idea of that at all, and decides that making them tomorrow's problem is worth not having them in some weird-ass circle around him.
Castiel smiles, trying not to let pain twist the expression into a grimace. He cups Dean's face with one hand. The world blurs behind Dean, indistinct shapes, jumbled light and darkness. Or maybe death is just opening up behind Dean, waiting to take Castiel. Dean is still bleeding, but he'll be alright. He's safe. The void tugs at Castiel. It's a low roar in his ears, it's a long gleam of black sliding through his vision, and beyond it there is no pain.
Surprise flits across Corin's features, costing him a crucial split second. Then he opens his mouth, starting to lift one hand, but Castiel is
, that skirt, of course—twitches, eyes going wide, one hand flying up towards his own chest in an aborted motion that Castiel catches nonetheless.
"You're a coward," Dean says. It isn't fair of him to say and he knows it, but he's suddenly angry—angry at Cas, and himself, and Chuck, and the whole shitty mess their lives had been, right up until the shitty end. "And so am I."
He feels a tightness in his chest, as he says it. He hadn't wanted that, Chuck dead. Not really. Not anymore. But Chuck—Chuck had forced their hand. They'd had no choice.
"I—" Dean tightens his grip on the Colt. He can hear Sam struggling to his feet, behind him. "I—no. You're no danger to anyone anymore. We've already beaten you."
"By Lucifer, that was pathetic," Raz chuckles. "You're so desperate, angel. It shows on every line of your face. Does he know? Hell, he must. A blind man could tell."
smiling, since they entered the Bunker. His hand slides out to catch Eileen’s. Dean watches them twine their fingers together. It makes something tighten in Dean’s chest, to watch. It’s happiness, but not it's not
Basically all the blood in Dean's body rushes downward. Brain cells, exeunt stage dick. He swallows hard, one more time, and
"But I already knew. I think I've known for a long time. And I was too much of a coward to ever...god. Sam. I'm such a fucking coward. I
Cautiously, he extends his awareness from where it's still retracted tightly in his vessel's chest—pushes it out to his now half-splayed wing. It isn't ragged and broken the way he would've expected it to be, and he can't detect any trace of Corin's poisoning fire. The appendage is his own, unmistakably; it chimes with the sound of his grace, still closely tethered to his true form despite its physicality. And there, yes, is the silvery-white gleam of his grace, radiating out from blood vessels and feathers. But over it...Castiel stills, his heart skipping a beat that it shouldn't need anyway.
"You too," Dean says, fumbling with the buttons on Castiel's shirt. He takes a little too long with the first one, biting down on his lower lip in increasing frustration, and Castiel tips his head.
"Hey, yourself," says one of them, a blonde girl. Cheerleader Guy looks like he's about to pass out.
“I know,” Dean tells him, still feeling a little out of breath, like he's just run a marathon. "Me too, Cas—Cas, I’ve loved you for so
a power play to humiliate Dean, it was also a calculated tactic. Now he'll be too weak to fight even once they're out of range.
"I—you—" Cas pants as they break apart. His eyes are enormous. There's a smile curling the corners of his mouth, half-disbelieving, half-incredulous. "You—"
It’s a couple of days after that, still on the road to Washington, that Dean glances over at the forest flashing past beyond the highway guardrail. He looks at the kaleidoscope of sunlight, the trees whipping past, the empty breakdown lane—and something short-circuits in his brain. A bolt of white-hot nausea lances down his spine, nearly making him lose control of the wheel. He jerks the Impala over to the shoulder of the interstate and sucks air into his lungs, his stomach churning like he's going to be sick.
"The Bunker. Sam left the Bunker," Castiel clarifies. "Three months ago. We locked it up, he took the Impala and headed west."
Dean scoffs, pretending to dust flour off his jeans so that he has an excuse to look down. He can feel his cheeks getting warm.
Dean emerges, holding up the beers he retrieved from the fridge. "Well, we're about to have a drink, because if I recall correctly, we just saved the world. And then we're gonna go up to Sioux Falls, and we're gonna collect his feathery ass, and we're gonna bring him home."
The vampire, gloating, has leaned too close; Dean manages to snap his head sharply off the floor, slamming his forehead into his aggressor's nose. The other man reels back with a curse and Castiel feels Dean's grim satisfaction.
Michael purses his lips and looks between the two of them. “Do you understand what it means, that God absorbed the Darkness?”
Castiel lets out a sound that's half a laugh, half a sob. He's never been so happy in all his life. "Okay."
(Which is how Dean ends up chasing Cas around the kitchen, hurling handfuls of flour at him and trying to grab the cookie dough bowl back before Cas can get it to the sink.)
Castiel looks at the verdant ring surrounding him, at the fire's slow dance. The tactical part of his mind is spinning rapidly, calculating timing and weighing odds and making guesses, all in service to the directive the rest of his mind is screaming, a ghost echo of the order he received from Heaven all those years ago, on the day the angels launched their foray into Hell.
“You aren’t God anymore,” says Jack quietly. “You’re something new. You don’t belong to this world anymore, and it doesn’t belong to you. Neither do we.”
Castiel flips the blade around in his hand and offers it to Dean, haft-first. "One line should do it. To break the pattern."
"Cas," he says. He touches the side of Cas's face. Cas is shivering, though it can't be that he's feeling the cold. With his other hand, he takes the pair of glasses out of his pocket. "Do you trust me?"
"For a long time the only thing that kept me sane was the determination to make up for what I have done," he says. "I was obsessed with redeeming myself in some way. When I escaped and came to earth, I...I was ready to do anything,
Castiel lets go of Dean, shock whiting out his thoughts for an instant. Dean takes advantage of the lapse to twist away. He crouches on the bed and pulls the coat down over his thighs, facing Castiel with his jaw knotted defiantly.
Cas hums a little. He tugs one of Dean’s hands up to his face, kisses the knuckle of Dean’s thumb. “Yes. I meant it.”
, and Dean hits him with roughly the grace and force of a derailed train and tackles him directly into the stone floor.
The hour before dinner passes in relatively controlled chaos. Dean is busy shuffling dishes in and out of pots on the stove, running back and forth between the kitchen and the library to fuss with the place settings. Cas has won the tree location battle with Jack’s swing vote—Eileen darkly muttering about nepotism at work—and is now smugly assisting Jack in constructing a gingerbread house of dubious structural integrity.
"No," says Cas miserably. "Yes." He looks back at Dean. "I was afraid to—to face you, after what I said. And what you said."
“Apocalypse is over,” he hears himself continuing, with a forced cheer that sounds tinny even to his own ears. Sam is looking at him like he’s grown a second head. “I think we’ll be okay without Death hovering over our shoulders keeping an eye on us.”
“They went to take their cups to the kitchen,” smiles Cas. “That was quite some time ago, so I expect they won’t be making a reappearance.”
For a moment Dean allows himself to hope. It doesn’t make sense, but for just an instant he imagines the four of them getting into the Impala. Cas’s knees bumping against the back of the driver’s seat. His gaze meeting Dean’s through the rearview mirror, as Dean drives his family home.
What awaits Dean with Corin is a living hell, months or years of the same torment Castiel had found him drowning in those few days ago. Castiel doesn't know what other magic Corin has at his disposal, but if the original sigils kept Dean hidden for months until sheer luck brought Castiel close enough to find him, there's no telling how long it could be before Castiel is able to track Dean down again. It could be years. It could be longer. He can't let them leave. He can't let them leave, he can't lose Dean now, he
"Cas," Dean breathes immediately, tipping his face up. The dream-Castiel reaches out and gently cups Dean's face, strokes something invisible off his forehead. Castiel, watching, feels something clenching in his gut—how many times has he imagined touching Dean this softly? Watching it now feels invasive, as if he's watching someone else caress Dean's face, a stranger that only superficially resembles him.
. Gone. Rinse, repeat. "That was his grand deathbed confession, yeah? Lay it all out and then kick the fucking bucket."

," Cas says, the word coming out half-mangled. His hand clenches down on Dean's shoulder. He's hot and sleek in Dean's mouth and—god, Dean's imagination is good, but he doesn't think his dreams have ever done
"I didn't think it was really you," Dean rasps. He sags against the wall, his eyes never leaving Castiel's. "I thought—I thought they—" His face twists in terror, his gaze darting suddenly around the room like a frightened bird.
“Holy shit,” says Dean, and he steps forward, catches Benny’s sleeve to yank him into a rough hug. Feels Benny’s arm like a steel band across his spine as Benny hugs him back; feels the scrape of Benny’s stubble dragging against his cheek. Benny is solid against him, all corded muscle and the clean sharp smell of the forest, and underneath it the metallic undertone of blood, the violent terroir that clings to everything in Purgatory. God, it shouldn’t feel so familiar, but it does. Dean presses his palm against Benny’s shoulder blade, holds on for an instant.
“I...yes. I have no doubt you will,” says Cas. He nods, a slight motion as if confirming something to himself. He doesn’t meet Dean’s eyes, not really. “Goodbye, Dean, Sam.”
, Bobby had said), just enjoying the music, the shifting landscape outside his window, the hum and creak of the engine.
Castiel doesn't respond—he can't. He fights against the witchcraft with everything he has, and still he stands frozen, unable to even look Dean in the eye.
Sam looks pained for a moment, and Dean knows—can see it on Sam’s face, clear as day—that Sam’s remembering deaths he feels responsible for, the people he’s led into battle who hadn’t walked out again. But then he nods to Dean, smiles a little anyway.  “Thanks. That—that means a lot, coming from you.”
It strikes him that Cas must have known, too. The way Cas knew everything about Dean. Cas knew everything about Dean and he still—he still said those things—
"Come on," says Castiel. He moves one hand to skate his palm down his bare chest, his stomach, the fingers just barely grazing his waistband, before tucking it back into position behind his head and tipping his chin up toward the ceiling. "I'd be a terrible host if I got between a man and a dare."
almost, because—and his pulse is ratcheting up at the thought, juddering painfully in his ears—what if Cas is hurt? What if something happened to him in the Empty, and he's back but he's
A note on the chronology: so the timing of this fic is somewhat deliberately ambiguous. It should be considered set in later seasons, say season 11 or 12, but during a theoretical six-month period where nothing else is going on and no characters other than Dean and Castiel (and Sam) need to be taken into consideration. So I have altered canon to the extent that I created the 6+ month gap in which the story takes place.
and he, he doesn't hate Dean, and maybe it'll be okay. Maybe it will. He curls his fingers around Cas's hand.
and Dean wants to scream that there is nothing to know, nothing to tease out and unearth here, because how Cas—how Cas feels or felt about him changes nothing, it doesn't mean—it doesn't mean that
at him. Miserable, urgent, determined. "Okay, Dean. Whatever else—whatever else there is in the way—I just want you to know, it doesn't—"
, he realizes slowly. If he's to care for Dean here, without doctors, without his grace, he needs supplies. Not just medicine and bandages, but food, too, and clothes Dean can wear that aren't torn and dirty. He tangles his fingers anxiously around his keys, thinking. Eventually common sense wins out over his worry. The motel might be shoddy, but it
Dean remembers to close his jaw, but he can’t tear his eyes away from Benny as the vampire gets within reaching distance. If he were alone he’d wonder if he was fucking hallucinating, but it’s pretty clear Sam and Eileen can see the exact same thing he can. “They told us you got yourself killed.”
Castiel digs in his pocket, pulls out some crumpled bills. "Two hundred," he offers. "Up front. If you get a bad feeling at any point, you can leave."
"We're okay," says Dean again, and he's talking to Sam, and to Cas, and to himself, and to the new god in their midst, and—really, to the world at large.
"Good," Cas hums, still braced above him, and he sounds a little wrecked, himself. "You—" He kisses Dean's temple, the corner of Dean's eye. "—so good, Dean."
“Where are we going?” Sam says, bemused, at one point. They're crossing through familiar terrain—all low rolling hills, the same palette of golds and greens smeared endlessly out to the horizon on either side of the road.
