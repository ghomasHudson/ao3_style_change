"I am just as capable as any of your men," Carol said and pointed to the couple of guards that lay unconscious by the drawbridge. "And anyone in your position with their wits together, Lord Stark, would allow me at least a chance to prove myself as a member of their guard."
Tony sets the table for them and finishes cooking in time with Steve appearing in the doorway. Steve sits down with a grateful smile and doesn’t seem to be noticing Tony’s suppressed flinch when he takes a seat across from him–maybe because he’s preoccupied poking his omelet and taking a tentative bite.
Eyes brimming with unshed tears and betrayal, Tony is looking at him again. The question is almost inaudible, a whisper laced still with incredulity like he can't believe he has to ask it.
"That would appear to be the case, Sir. All my readings suggest that this is a nearly perfect carbon copy of Captain Rogers."
Let it be known that Tony will be the first to admit that his impulsive behavior doesn't always prove itself an asset. In fact, most of the time, it leaves him in less desirable situations than he initially found himself in, and that feat alone should be considered a small miracle.
“You’re serious?” he asks, just to be sure. Stark snorts and gestures up and down himself – his bruises have turned a greenish blue and he’s wearing an old, dirt-stained set of shabby linen clothing they bought off a shorter beta in exchange for their ration of nutrient blocks for the day. “Do I look like I can afford to be joking?”
"I know how to get into Pierce's inner circle, but l'll need a few things to fall back on and make myself credible," Romanoff says, getting to the meat of the topic right away. Were she anyone else, Steve would have assumed it's because she wants it to be over, but that isn't the case here. They're alike in that regard: both of them hate wasted time.
this world's Tony chose to come out here. Chose this, isolation and primitivity – both of which is relative, but especially for a man like Tony Stark who'd be used to towers and mansions, a house by the lake could be viewed as such – over luxuries that had felt safe and familiar before but served then as a constant reminder of his failings.
Steve makes an inquisitive noise through his next bite of pancake, asking for a reply. It crosses Tony’s mind that the unease prickling under his skin is something he should be taking a closer look at, but he brushes it away against his better judgement. Stranger things have happened, right?
Stark's eyes widen a fraction, just enough to communicate that the implications of what has been said leave him… not afraid, but apprehensive.
Then there's the rest, which doesn't help his case either. Your stomach is bound to appear bigger when you're sitting down–call him a liar, but even Steve's isn't perfectly flat–but this is really starting to gnaw at his pride.
Tony's first official act of the day is activating the coffee machine, which comes as a surprise to no one. He's leaning against the counter as he waits, stifling another yawn. Steve realizes he's stopped eating in favor of watching their interaction take place and is now watching
There's a moment of stunned silence. After, the man chuckles in disbelief and takes a long sip of his beer (to buy himself time while he thinks of an appropriate response that'll shut him up, Tony assumes) but when the blond eventually speaks up again, it's not to discuss further.
Tony can’t even crow ‘I told you so’ because the fear lodged in his airway threatens to choke him. Instead, with one trembling hand fumbling for the phone in his pocket and the other instinctively cradling his stomach, he prepares for what’s to come. He struggles to open the one single contact the phone came with, the simple task exacerbated by the sweat coating his palms, the unread message flashing at him and the prospect of imminent doom.
Tony has to look twice when they halt on a small elevation and the land below shows a sight that doesn't fit in with the rest, that is testament to man's intervention: a herd of roughly fifty cows, their brown and black coats standing out amidst the bright landscape.
His heart is racing with the thump of a racehorse’s gallop and there’s sweat pooling in the hollow of his throat. He doesn’t remember dreaming, but from the way his body behaves, he's most likely had a nightmare. One that didn’t stick to his conscious, thankfully. He doesn't want to know what his brain is capable of conjuring as a result of the past month alone.
Not even Sir Steven Rogers himself appeared to be capable of preventing Anthony's unfortunate accidents from happening.
“I'll never not love you,” Steve tells his unconscious form, gently undoing the bindings to gather Tony’s limp body in his arms. His pulse is unsurprisingly weakened, but steady enough considering the circumstances.
The reason being cleanliness and efficiency, which are the two primary principles he stands by. Some of the other mercenaries in their ranks find him unnerving to be around. Apparently, hIs practices are too clinical. Steve can't see how not taking prisoners is an undesirable trait.
Tony snorts in lieu of an actual response, although the little defiant twitch of his lips is telling enough. Steve supposes that's more than he's ought to hope for from the start. It's something, at least.
Even in the dark, he's able to see the moist gleam in Tony's eyes, and it tells him everything he has to know.
Rhodey notices, and offers cuddles (more than usual). Tony accepts (more than usual). Pepper, in a way of solidarity, offers as well, although she seems mystified about the concept, what with her being a beta and not partaking in the more odd aspects of the other two dynamics. In spite of all this, she’s always made an effort to put up with his moods and that’s more than Tony can ask for.
Tony has to do a double take at his stash, because there’s a lot more empty than filled bottles there than he anticipated. He even rubs his eyes, but the sobering (ha!) reality remains the same: there’s a little over sixteen ounces left. Taking the bottle out, he studies the sloshing liquid inside with pursed lips and thinks. He didn’t believe he’d gone all that far over his allotted rations in the past weeks, but it makes sense in retrospect.
The words die in his throat when he steps through the doorway to the kitchen, swaying a little as his legs cease their movement on the spot and he comes to an abrupt halt.
He wore a velvet doublet the color of wine and a black cloak trimmed with golden silk, and possessed a blinding smile, a demeanor so eccentric it should not have fit the room and the ability to produce unending strings of words at any given moment in time. He seemed every bit like all other high royals she'd encountered in her lifetime and nothing like the warrior they called the Man of Iron who struck down Thanos the tyrant on that fateful day.
It would have been beautiful if Tony wasn't cold, exhausted and ready for something with a high enough percentage of alcohol to warm him from the inside.
"No," he answers curtly, bringing the axe down on another log in the same uncompromising manner he has just rejected Tony's suggestion. He doesn't even have the common courtesy of looking at him.
. Tony’s tight like a vice around him, his body rocking back and forth with Steve’s every thrust. It’s good, and unusual. They usually don’t take this time when having sex, rather tending to come down fast and rough, pushing and challenging one another as they always do. It’s no surprise that replacing the urgency with something of a gentler nature feels like an entirely new level of intimacy.
"Here, let me," Steve says, very close, the side of his face pressed against Tony's. He's pretty sure the sweat that's making their skin stick together like that is his own, and why is he so warm all of a sudden?
Once lined up, Tony sinks down, carefully first and then all at once when his arms fail to hold him up. Steve grunts at the sudden, all-consuming warmth and pressure and reflexively bucks his hips upward, relishing in Tony's answering moan that all but gets punched out of him.
Steve's heart aches with a force that punches the air out of him as Tony curls back into himself, toward his injured limb. It could be the injury that is torturing him, the phantom pain or both. He's seen it often in the war, way back when, and the distant memories of fellow soldiers torn apart by landmines and cries of agony over extremities that were no longer there feel like a fever dream now.
Except – when he's climbed up the ladder, Steve hears him, clothes rustling, breathing hard and sounding broken little gasps that are probably suppressed whimpers. He smells him, too, and it's not the scent that carries everywhere but the one you just get up close, arousal spicy-sweet with musk underneath that Steve knows means he's wet and dripping with it.
moving, and everything that was of importance before evaporates into hot air instantaneously. The push is slow and tortuous and the stretch overwhelming in the best possible way, and Tony allows a satisfied groan to slip past his lips as he relishes the feeling of being split open.
Anyway – it's serene out here, with the lake, the winds stirring the almost barren trees and the sing-song of the birds that gradually dwindles as many of them travel south as fall progresses.
The herd is moving, agitation tangible in the air. A few of the animals pass Tony close by, fast as can be in the snow, their eye-whites showing and signaling anxiety.
Tony tips off the edge in a moment he hasn’t expected to fall–but he's pinching the head of his dick just so and Steve expertly hammers into his prostate like he’s installed a GPS tracker in there, and that’s everything it takes for the last stitch to come undone.
Steve snaps his hips forward a fraction harder. His next thrust comes at a curious angle, which has Stark giving a full-body twitch and his eyes rolling into the back of his head. The moan spills over his lips like boiling water from a kettle that’s been simmering for too long, and Steve feels warm validation pooling in his gut right alongside the already pleasant arousal.
wells up and spills over his lips next, varying in pitch and volume which seems to directly correlate with how hard Steve’s thrusts come.
He's only shaken out of his trance once the front door slams shut. Steve takes a steadying breath to combat the sudden dizziness. Then, he searches for Tony outside the kitchen window, quickly finding the man walking down the small jetty all the way to the end and taking a seat there.
It may go against his every instinct as a mother and every last notion of common sense within him but he knows deep down: he can't sit this one out. Even if by some miracle, he could turn his back on the situation and let the others handle it, the chances that there wouldn’t be anything left by the end but ash and dust are too high. That’s too grim a world to raise a child in.
The force of his climax hits Steve unexpectedly. Tony’s body tenses as he collapses face forward into the pillow, fingers fisted in the soft material as he shakes through it, going quiet after an initial, drawn-out groan.
Two of the people on board have a brown mop of hair, one of them smaller than the other. The tallest stick figure is blond and probably happier than Steve can remember himself ever being. It's ear-to-ear smile is almost mocking him:
Ah. The Lord smiled warmly. It seemed they had already formed a bond strong enough for the young man to be interested in his whereabouts.
The desperate turn cruel, not necessarily because callousness is in their nature, but because they are just that: desperate and thus willing to do anything for their cause.
He anticipated as much. They are (or, were?) the same person in the truest sense of the word, after all. Steve’s own emotions are all over the place; he can’t imagine what it must be like for Tony, being confronted with the spitting image of his husband and father of his child, knowing it’s not the same man he remembers loving.
She sat at the head of the bed with her legs folded to the side, creating a pillow. Her gray sweatpants were graced with a dark patch where the side of Tony's face was pressing into her thigh, mouth hanging open. Every once in a while, he would moan and more would dribble from the corner of his lips, a string of saliva soaking into the material below.
This is pure. The rapid rise and fall of Stark's chest, the tremble of his hands as he bats at Steve's spit-wet fingers around his limp cock, how his carefully crafted exterior crumbles and exposes the animalistic instinct of
Insignificant–at least that's what it should be, right? Two words. Unimportant. Speaking them out loud means nothing. It doesn't prove or change anything. So why is it so hard to meet Steve's one condition?
leave the matter to the wizard. If, you know, Strange hadn’t been dusted like so many others. Namely fifty percent of humanity. Which brings him back to their initial goal -- retrieving the Soul Stone from the godforsaken place that is Vormir. And really, isn’t
“Were they afraid? Afraid of what you are, what you’ve become?” he asks, not receiving an answer beyond a choked groan as he roughly twists his fingers around the man’s erection. “I know what you really are, Stark. You’re nothing to be afraid of.”
"You could make it up to me." He squeezes around Steve's dick and musters up a grin, although he doesn't have to see it to know it hardly passes as one.
It’s Tony’s turn to frown now. His huff is accompanied by the creak of the barstool as he leans back and promptly learns to regret putting more pressure on his behind. “I think my ass can testify to your being here last night.”
He’s slicked with only spit, and Steve presses bruises into the skin where he’s holding him open. The tip of his cock nudges Tony’s opening immediately–Tony hardly has time to take a breath and try to relax. Steve pushes in, and not slow either, opening him up with sheer force of will. And then just force.
It takes a while, but Tony's nearly groomed himself to perfection. He angles his face one particular way, arching his spine for no evident reason but dramatic effect as he shaves off a few of the less obvious offenders at the underside of his jaw. His towel gives up clinging to him entirely and surrenders to gravity, then – it's gradually been slipping loose for the past few minutes, so Tony keeps at his task and ignores it, now lying in a heap at his feet.
Tony. God, how he wished for that. It was more than he ever deserved, probably, but he'd wished for it. To call Tony his.
Tony thought that would be it. They’d finish, Steve would (reluctantly) pull out before the knot could take, he’d brush the creases out of his crumpled Tom Ford and pretend that would be enough to preserve his dignity when he walked out the door with wet stains in telltale places, smelling of sex and slick and Steve.
James saw him smile in a way he would consider lovestruck, almost timid, were it not for his friend's generally non-timid demeanor.
Stark is still huddled to the back of the wall, tension in every line of his body as he regards them. Whoever took his scrap of cloth didn't think to return it, and Steve has to admit – well, it isn't quite fair, leaving him bare during what is essentially an interrogation, but nobody's ever wasted a thought on fairness either when they crammed them into this place like cattle and pat themselves on the back for their compassion.
Steve is on him at lightning speed after that, sliding into the space between his legs like he belongs there–and hell, sometimes when he puts that eighth world wonder of a dick inside, Tony's inclined to believe that idea might just hold a sliver of truth. Steve pulls him flush against his body and spreads him open with one hand while he uses the other to guide the head of his cock in-between his already lube-slick asscheeks.
Wanted to be wrecked and desecrated even when there were so many things hinting at the inherent wrongness of the act, and he’s a sick bastard, isn’t he, fuck–
Tony's eyes wander around aimlessly, wide and glazed over as they speak to him, last consoling words for a man on the brink between life and death.
When you're used to the mild weather and many commodities of the east coast, Wyoming is like a hook to the chin from a guy twice your size.
Steve says, his gaze heated and intimate while his breath ghosts over Tony's still parted lips. "There's–so much fire, and brilliance and
Not in a hurry, he climbs down from his bunk at a measured pace, letting the others take the lead while he trails behind. Then, he spots Bucky, pushing through the people in the opposite direction and waving Steve to him when their eyes meet.
He gives Steve the shield back. Steve doesn’t have anything to return except for a stammer and an incredulous smile as he takes the familiar weight of it out of Tony’s hands.
"I am everyone," Yinsen repeats, looking just like he does in those dreams Tony sometimes still has, when he tells him not to waste his life over and over until the worlds reverberate like a broken record in his head.
Their plan works out. It's nerve-wrecking and every minute detail has the power to ruin their scheme, but they make it, with a slight detour to the 70s. Only Clint returns alone and guilt-ridden, the Soul Stone in his hand and Natasha gone.
If he wasn't already stiff with cold, his every muscle would go rigid now, as he processes what this indicates. His whole body aches with it, but Tony lifts his head nevertheless. He needs to know, just needs to make sure it’s only his brain conjuring up a hallucination that will comfort him as he’s about to go out.
Steve's smile changes a little, shifts, and it takes a moment for him to realize that the reason for the subtle reaction is himself, Tony, who now has a wry but genuine smile returning the other man's. He doesn't know when it happened, only that it has, and Steve might be indeed magical. Maybe Steve needs some sort of glitter-apparatus added to his shield, come to think of it.
Steve gathers saliva in his mouth and then spreads Stark’s cheeks to spit it out, watching as it drips down his cleft. He rubs the liquid in with two fingers, too impatient to start on one, unwilling to waste time on anything but the bare minimum. When he forces a third finger in much too soon, Stark eventually makes noise: a choked whimper that he stifles before Steve can properly savor it.
Now that he’s aware of his aching erection, not waking from his semi-conscious doze suddenly seems a lot more challenging than it previously did, but he thinks he can hold off for a little while longer. Float in the sleep-drunken haze while it lasts. Enjoy the feeling of Tony, close and warm and alive.
When he steps closer and holds the lantern up, the bloody patches in its gray fur become visible. It's still alive and breathing, though, even if the breath making its stomach flutter up and down is shallow. During every other pant, the wolf sounds a low whimper, and Tony feels suddenly sick to the stomach.
"We've made you feel good before, haven't we? C’mon, Tony. You remember. I know you do," Steve says, a strange lilt in his voice. The following sigh sounds rueful. "But I'm afraid we'll need something else from you this time.”
Who knew? Anthony Stark is still capable of aspirations other than the wish to wallow in self-pity until the end of his days.
Now that he’s got the time and space needed to look at his situation from a more fact-bound perspective, a few positives come to light. He could do without going back to SHIELD, of course, but if getting poked and prodded for a while and having a highly confidential heart to heart with Fury to prove the legitimacy of his identity will ultimately help convince them to get him back where he’s come from, that’s something he’s willing to take upon himself.
Rumors, those were one thing, yet a confirmation of the truth was of an entirely different nature. Folk liked to gossip, but quite enough of them would not like hearing (or, Gods forbid, seeing) that their dear Lord was truly as depraved as the town's rumor mills insinuated.
Looking at Stark's naked backside spread out before him (and it's a sight to behold for sure) Steve abruptly becomes aware of the throbbing pain of his erection still confined to his pants.
His voice has an edge to it, laced with something that Tony now, as he listens closer, realizes is not anger directed at him but Steve himself. The other man is rubbing his thumbs in even circles over the raised skin above Tony’s hip bones – two bumps that are significantly less prominent than they were the last time he checked.
"Hello, handso–oh–mmh, okay," he chuckles, breathlessly. Steve’s hands leave his waist and undo the knot in the cord holding his sweatpants up. "Okay, that's happening now."
She had never been interested in being a damsel in need of rescuing to make a knight in shining armor feel accomplished. If anything, she wanted to wear the armor and would rescue damsels if needed.
The next sensation comes in form of hands on his face and neck, gentle but insistent. Whoever is touching him taps his cheek, once, twice, and then harder a third time. It's unbearable. Even the thought of opening his eyes makes him groan with pain, yet this person seems determined to make him look into their eyes as he dies.
He needs to take precautions. Build failsafes. That’s what he does, what any engineer turned futurist should. Even if he doesn’t make it, he can still be of use. He can pass on the understandings he's come to, can mull over the details of the battle lost—if only for the sake of not going insane while they're trapped on this ship.
Most of the people are strangers to him, but he makes out flashes of familiar faces in-between. There's Peggy in her younger years, curls in her hair and red on her lips, Jarvis in his later years and one of his fanciest waistcoats, Ana with this small, subdued smile she used to smile out of pride and then -- Maria, just so very much like he remembers her, prim and proper and
It is second nature now: he will hear it getting closer, and he’ll shove himself between the other man and the closest attacker to shield him from the worst of it. Tony used to protest, vocally and elaborately, but that was before the incident when he almost got bit the first time around. After that, he saw that it was a logical precaution, a safety measure born out of necessity. Steve’s the only one out of the two of them with the privilege to risk a bite or two–or five, or ten.
because he's deeply mortified about just the knowledge that Steve feels that same sensation that greeted Tony when he put his hands there. It's fat, down there, and it wobbles when you shift it, and he knows lots of people have it.
When Steve hands it over to him, Stark cradles the sachet to his chest with both his bound hands (they haven’t gotten rid of the restraints but switched them to the front for convenience's sake) like it’s precious and then pulls it open to count the individual pieces inside. Finally, he blows out a relieved breath and directs his attention back to Steve, bag still clutched tight in his fist.
As he bent down and reached for her hand to press a delicate kiss to her knuckles, Natasha wrenched his fingers from her with a practiced move that had the man stifling a pained cry. She smiled pleasantly and Lord Rhodes on her left hid his laugh behind a sudden coughing fit.
to make that shot if you hadn't been about t'be torn t'shreds," he answers. Although his tone is markedly airy, there's an accusatory, almost angry undercurrent swinging in it, and his lip twitches up and down with a strange emotion.
Tony is loathe to see him this distraught, even after their falling out. Siberia should’ve driven the point home that the man's feelings didn't run as deep as Tony needed them to–and yet here Steve is, crying for him, proving him wrong. Tony joins, although the tears aren’t for himself but rather ones of joy as he understands Steve cares more than he ever believed possible, and ones of sorrow as the realization hits him that it won’t matter either way.
Detecting movement in front of him, the Captain raised his head only to be met with the other's midsection blocking his field of view. He did not get an opportunity to speak – Anthony climbed onto the large chair as well, moving with astounding speed as he placed his knees on either side of Steven's lap to sit down without a second of hesitation.
so effortlessly Steve doesn't think there's any chance he can possibly get on the man's good side ever again.
He never spoke the words out loud. They sound right but leave a bitter aftertaste on his tongue. He figures this is how missed chances must taste. Tangy but stale. Rainwater.
Well, his body hasn't ever done him any favors, so Tony isn't inclined to play nice now. Best things come in threes and all that. Literally. He'll get his (Steve's) three, consequences be damned.
So, what Tony says, finally, to give both of them some peace of mind before he goes, is something that Steve often forgets and needs to be reminded of. And now, too, it’s of importance–because Tony needs to know, even if Steve grieves for a long time, that he won’t clutch onto the emotion forever, even after it has long expired and has no right to exist any longer.
Tony had hoped, foolishly, that giving up the CEO position to Pepper would bring his number of intercontinental business trips down to a close zero, but no such luck. Hence he spent the last two weeks putting out fires–figurative and real ones–at their production site in Shanghai after something (multiple somethings) went awry in the robotics department and the whole place shut down as a result because nobody could quite figure out the
The realization hits him like a punch in the gut and takes his breath away in the worst way possible.
Steve thanks them both, Nat making off to her allotted sleeping quarters in the opposite direction soon after. Finally, he leaves as well, biding his friend a good night and casting one last glance at the miserable looking figure on the floor, guarded by Bucky who looms at the opposite wall.
it be Sir Rogers who accompanied him on his forays into the Far Lands. While the man kept an open mind and welcomed every voice that spoke up among the commons, not a soul dared to dissuade him from this.
out of the corner of his eye. He looks away hastily, continuing his meal. Hell, Tony told him to back off in the nicest way possible; he could at least
Steve doesn’t know if it’s idiocy, a fear of death or megalomania (or all three) that has gotten Stark so convinced being more machine than human is an existence worth striving for. Whatever it is–and it doesn’t concern him, Steve is only here to complete his task–makes him feel almost a shred of sympathy for the man when he catches up to him on the rooftop.
Maybe his expression is a little too fond, because Tony angles himself away from Steve just so and visibly closes off after that, shaking his head as if to get rid of whatever their interaction might have triggered within him.
Carol did not care for their approval in any case. She was happy about the camaraderie of the few that had reconciled themselves to her presence, but everything else did not matter long as she remained fit to serve in the guard.
Tony would be smug about and rub said development in Rogers’ face if a much bigger problem wasn’t about to arise on the horizon, one that consumes his every waking thought once he notices.
They were joined by Anthony's guards, one Steven Rogers, and another small party sent by the King that was James' to lead. The days of travel back to familiar territory appeared longer than those to King's Landing had ever been, although James mused this might stem from his own anticipation for what was to come.
At their core, they were not a family of highborn royals that had had riches and power laid at their feet from the very day they first fed at their mother’s breast, but rose to power by virtue of their ingenuity, resourcefulness and contrarian thinking.
The dead parts Steve might not like looking at, but he’s sure the most important bits of Stark have remained soft, pliable flesh. Human, even when the rest of him so decidedly refuses to be. And that’s alright–if Stark wants to shed his mortal coil, he’s free to. He just shouldn’t expect to keep his human dignity when he does.
gorgeous to a point Steve thought he felt his heart beat out of rhythm for a moment, like not even his enhanced body could cope with the amounts of dazzling, nearly ethereal beauty his senses were assaulted with.
Tony doesn't manage to keep anything down until a couple of days in, and even then it's just the smallest of portions of conserved fruit and the like. He almost seems reluctant to eat, which Steve chalks up to his fear of getting sick again until sometime later he catches him squirming on the bed, discomfort written in his pinched expression because of course basic human needs don't change even when you're bed bound.
and to everyone whose life has been impacted by covid-19 as well: be safe and hang in there! things are bound to get better.
Steve turns away from the scenery outside to find Tony looking at him, arms crossed and head tilted an inch to the side with the hint of a soft smile playing at his lips. "Woah, Plato," he comments, without any real humor that would ruin the gravity of the moment.
Tony isn’t out of the woods yet, and whether this last, desperate measure to save him will actually come to fruition is something he’ll only find out in the next few hours. Tony may live. Tony may die, succumb to his injuries. Tony–and this is the one possibility Steve wants to entertain the least–may still be taken by the disease, and he’ll have been right to condemn Steve for torturing him on behalf of a hopeless cause.
Tony speeds up his pace a little, bursts of pleasure zapping up his spine and exploding into small fireworks behind his eyes each time Steve’s cock rubs over his sweet spot, the loose circle of Steve's fist around him the perfect counterweight.
Sometimes a man just wants to get fucked like he’s 25, absolutely cockeyed and in the company of three charming gentlemen who are with him for precisely one reason, which is that they won’t be gentle whatsoever.
It’s not like Steve isn’t tempted (because he is), but he’s found that it’s good like this, sometimes. Tony takes a while to calm down and surrender to the slow, building pleasure pushing them ever so slightly toward the edge instead of chasing his release. When he does, Steve delights in the way the tension drains from his body and he slumps in his hold, arms and legs going limp as he gives up control, trusting Steve to not let go.
He had been fortunate; a fractured bone was an ugly affair, especially one in the ankle. The procedure of resetting the broken pieces was an agonizing one, both for the patient and, to some extent, the surgeon.
Tony's voice is quiet, subdued, like he's hoping Steve won't be able to pick up his words nor ask him to repeat them.
He presses a kiss to Tony’s neck, one to his throat and another to his collarbone, taking his time navigating the other man’s body with eyes closed. Tony utters a soft noise and stills his movements as he becomes more aware of his surroundings. Steve almost grumbles in protest, but the complaint gets stuck in his throat once Tony looks up at him over his shoulder, blinking blearily.
Steve takes his cock from Tony's hand and puts a steadying hand on his hip as he navigates it between his cheeks. The sensation of it dragging over his already irritated skin is good and familiar, grounding while also making both his stomach and hole flutter in anticipation. Tony manages to wait until the head has caught onto his rim, and then he lets himself glide down without any further ado. The sudden intrusion comes with a distant, familiar ache that Tony refuses to pay any mind. He hears Steve's breath stutter and moans in relief as he finally comes to sit fully in the other man's lap.
"What he said," Tony provided, voice like sandpaper, finger pointing at Clint. "And you know I wouldn't say that if the situation wasn't dire."
Steve swallows, mostly regarding the knowing look in her eyes, but nods. She'd know, of course. He couldn't imagine Tony keeping the true extent of their relationship from his wife in any case. It's not like it was that much of a secret, what they'd had back then, during the time Pepper and Tony were apart.
When Tony wakes, it’s with a ragged groan that violently rips Steve out of his trance where he’s been sitting next to the bed all these hours, only moving away for a change of clothes and to get a fire started.
"I didn't figure you this naïve, Tony," says another at his left, brushing a hand over his throat in a gentle threat. His breathing falters and stutters to a halt all on its own. Tony squeezes his eyes shut and tries to force air back into his lungs.
The omega retracts his hand and pulls his leg tighter against himself, seemingly reminded of his vulnerable state all at once in the face of Steve’s scorn. “See,” Stark lowers his voice and looks around, blinking against the lights overhead, ”your plan is missing one key component and without it, this revolution is over before it’s even started. If you’re lucky, you’ll get past the first few gates, but then? Next time a door opens, they’ll come prepared. And you’re going to hope they kill you right there on the spot, because everything that comes after is worse.”
“Time is nothing,” Tony tells Nebula, whose head snaps around to look at him from across the room. First, her gaze is narrowed as she evaluates what has been said. She tilts her head a little and considers his state of delirium before she decides the statement is worth responding to.
to such a degree is not sitting right with him. At least Steve remains Steve, at his core. Stronger, better, more efficient and some would argue more brutal, but it’s what was already there that has changed and improved.
spot behind Tony's ear and he shudders, whether it's because of the endearment or the physical contact nobody will ever know. "It's never been about who deserves who. You know I've also had to get that into my head in my own time, but at the end of the day, this,
"We need some space, both of us. I guess I should've listened when you asked me to leave in the first place but I'm…selfish, and when I was offered that opening, I didn't have the willpower to walk away. But I realize now that it's not fair to you, me piling my–my being here on you on top of everything else."
“Something’s… off, I don’t know what it is. He’s antsy. I don’t think it’s because he means to try something, but we should be on lookout.”
Bruce attempted to make quick (but precise) work of it, feeling along the mottled skin to evaluate the severity of the injury. Lord Stark only hissed and inhaled steadying breaths but not once moaned aloud, which he filed away as another positive.
He's magical like that. Or maybe there is no magic. Maybe Steve has just learned to read his moods and thought patterns like Tony has learned, studied and picked his apart in turn until here they are, still understanding new things about each other but running like clockwork most days. Snapping together like a well oiled pair of cogs. (And why does that sound like it's got double meaning? Tony is trying to be sappy here.)
If there was no smith available, he would forge the blade himself. If there was no knight to wield the sword, he would ride into battle alone. If the fight was not to be settled without a sacrifice, he would lay down his own life.
It was rough, frantic and without doubt more about creating an outlet for their feelings and frustrations than it was about the sex. Tony ended up bent over the conference table, fingernails scraping over the surface and scrambling for purchase while Steve shoved him up against it.
"How's she doin'? You both gettin' along?" he asks, almost deliberately avoiding any question regarding Tony's well-being. Tony isn't sure whether to feel grateful or humiliated.
Steve is and has always been so far out of his league it's not only tragically hilarious but also mildly concerning.
For all that there comes a day when Tony's arm doesn't require medical attention anymore, there is nothing to help the psychological wounds heal.
He figures it's now or never. After he has handed over the animals, he returns to address the man who's clearly in charge. "So, ah, we were wondering whether you'd be inclined to get us something extra for the next one."
The words are a magic spell that possesses him to tell the truth. In one smooth motion, he draws himself up taller, squares his shoulders. He draws in a deep breath and his right hand flexes by his side. Ready: for battle, to kill or be killed.
It's also mighty attractive, but Tony has every intention of shoving that thought in a very far and dusty corner of his mind. He doesn't mean to get any stupid ideas, up there in the mountains where he's alone but for Steve Rogers and his own thoughts that sure as hell aren't always of the genius sort.
There’s a distinct tremble in his voice. Tony can tell, if the way he’s looking at him is any indication. He’s still facing toward the hologram, but his head is turned to the side just so and he’s observing Steve from the corner of his eye. “It was, um. It was the other way around, here. Last time I checked, Nat was with Laura and the kids. Survivor’s guilt,” he says quietly, blinking a few times before he turns away again.
"Yeah. It's, ah, Carbonell," Tony is quick to answer, aiming to snuff out any suspicions they might have. "Rogers figured I wasn't pulling my weight, hence here I am. Taking over new duties."
Her make-up is spotless but her eyes are wet, and it occurs to him that she might be holding onto him just as much as she’s trying to comfort him with her touch.
Steve goes for the more obvious next. "He was taller. By that much, maybe," he says, holding his index finger and thumb about four inches apart. Tony voices a quiet
“We will,” she says. Nebula doesn’t say much, but the things she does say, she means. Tony likes that in a person, human or not.
A few minutes pass until they’ve both recovered from the effects of their orgasm, breath and pulse slowing in tandem. Stark isn’t really lucid and won’t be for the next few hours; he smacks his lips and hums in content as he presses his rear back. The movement shifts Steve’s knot in a way that makes them both suck in a sharp breath in near perfect synchrony.
Tony knew the question would come eventually. And here's the thing: he doesn't know. Probably not. This could be a suicide mission for all he knows, but here's another thing: Tony doesn't think he cares. He's got his whole life to rot and wither like the rest of Red Rock when he comes back.
He inspects the clothing, two button-ups and jeans that appear to be his exact size, swallowing around the lump in his throat when it becomes clear that this was part of other Steve’s wardrobe. Tony must’ve never gotten rid of it in the first place.
Steve feels his mouth run dry. That makes…. sense. He might not have been in contact with any omegas for a while, but he still should’ve known, should’ve been able to tell the signs. Not only his scent shifted – Stark also complained about being too warm despite the ever-freezing cold seeping in from outside. On top of that, he was constantly on edge, twitchy and irritable in a way that, combined, should’ve alerted Steve to what was going on.
Fury glances down at the papers on his desk another time and then his brows suddenly furrow a little, a micro-expression lost to most, and the corner of his mouth twitches minutely like he's spotted something that's of interest.
Perhaps, Tony thinks, muscles hurting as he smiles a delirious smile, Rogers will find his body and mourn, and the last drawing of Tony Stark in his sketchbook will be one of a frozen corpse. He will have regrets, will think about the many glances, the long moments and missed opportunities. In the nights, he will torture himself with the what-ifs, with the things that could’ve been had he only, with everything that would be different if they had acted sooner.
Tony isn't finished, that much is made obvious by his lips parting yet again for another semi-serious jab at his conversational partner. Steve doesn't let him get another word in, though; there's no need to argue over the exact intricacies of this arrangement. He can deal with it. God knows he's had worse.
It didn't take anything more for Steve to follow him over the edge; really, Steve didn't follow, he was dragged. There was no conscious decision made, nothing he could've done to prevent it from happening.
For the better part of their hearing in the throne room, Lord Stark had been arguing with the man as if His Grace was a simple commoner and not the highest of royalty. James had feared they would be throwing him in the dungeons any moment now, but he had not stepped in – as was expected of him.
24 days is his personal record for longest time taken to pin down a criminal on the loose, but seeing as the fourteen previous attempts Hi-dra made to apprehend Stark failed miserably, he reckons the result is acceptable. Pierce certainly seemed satisfied when he delivered his last status report.
he realizes with a jolt, staring up at the off-white ceiling in his obstetrician's office during the exam. It shouldn’t be much of a revelation–his body, his friends and the young omega woman currently prodding him can testify that he’s lived every single one of those twenty-five weeks–and yet the realization is accompanied by no small amount of disbelief.
His family would mourn him, for a couple of months. Morgan...she'd miss him, for some time, but Rhodey and Happy would step up to help her through the loss, and besides, she's four years old. For all it's worth, Tony doesn't remember the first four years of his life. Losing a loved one is hard, even if they were an absolute dick during their lifetime (thanks for that, Howard) but they'd recover. They--
"Do you want to tell me about it?" James asked, but could already see the other shaking his head in the corner of his eye. At least, this secret between them was no more, and for that alone he was grateful.
Natasha looked up and shook her head at him, nearly imperceptible but obvious to someone who knew what to look for. Either Steve's pinched expression revealed what he was thinking or she was the mind reader he'd long since suspected her to be. Then, she returned to brushing her fingers over the side of Tony's face, tracing the line of his eyebrow, the curve of his cheekbone and the edge of his jaw. She followed the impeccable cut of his goatee to his mouth, where her fingers promptly slipped past his lips.
He surely was aware of this, and yet, under the layer of flippant arrogance bestowed upon him by his father, Anthony Stark remained a kind-hearted and compassionate man who guarded his land and its people like the apple of his eye.
He hums in contentment and allows his head to fall back onto Steve's chest. His eyes slip shut, and everything that's left is the slowly building pleasure thrumming in his veins. A new, vigorous wave of it washes over him whenever Steve flicks his wrist at a particular angle or thumbs the slit just right. Tony notices his own lips hitch upward when the hot press of a hard line against his low back announces that Steve, for one, is ready and raring to go again.
is everything his vocal cords accomplish, although the sound might've been more of a howl if he wasn't gagged. After a couple of heaving breaths, he collapses in exhaustion, muscles going limp all the sudden.
As much as he’d like to, he can’t afford to disappear. Between the government, SHIELD and the Avengers, there’s no way he’ll be taking any time out soon unless he wants Ross and Fury joining forces to track him down. The thought alone is nightmare fuel enough.
He figures Tony’s given him the benefit of the doubt until the moment he picks up the knife–and he can hear the wooden handle groan with the force of his grip–because it’s only then that his expression truly transforms into one of pure, unadulterated terror, an emotion that washes over Steve colder like the ice once did those many lifetimes ago.
Tony contemplates forcing his eyes open just to be able to roll his eyes at Steve in the mirror, but finds he's too lazy to. Instead, he scoffs, unable to stifle the faintest trace of a fond smile. “Shut up. I already said you won this round, don’t push it."
he reprimands himself, clenching his jaw and crushing the glimmer of hope Tony's words have ignited in his chest underneath the metaphorical heel of his boot before he gets any stupid ideas.
Space is vast and cold, but Tony doesn’t fear it anymore–not in the way he has once dreaded the idea of it, looked upon it in his worst dreams and let it consume him in his most sleepless of nights. The terror that once might’ve choked him is gone, curbed and dwarfed by a reality crueler than anything his mind could’ve envisioned.
A deafening rumble from above shocks the both of them out of their embrace. They tumble backward, jumping apart, bemused at the sight of their surroundings.
“Lord Hammer, I have listened to you spew your lies and slander long enough. If you have quarrels with My Lord, I suggest you speak to him in person as opposed to besmirching his name while you eat and drink from his table and reside under his roof. Now, pray remove yourself from this room, or I will take it upon myself to remove you.”
"Yes," Anthony answered, in matter of fact. He sighed, eyes fleetingly squeezing close and fluttering back open again.
"You're one of those S'vjetian broads, are you not?" he inquired, baring his teeth as he smiled through a sip of summer wine.
“There,” Tony heaves in a rush of air, having barely gotten a hold of his bearings but already aware of the next problem heading their direction. He’s pointing to the roll-up door of what appears to once have been a body shop on the roadside.
It'll have to do. Tony’s standing by a tree and leans against it for support while he wrestles with cloth and buttons until he's managed to free himself from his pants. The cool air makes him suck in a sharp breath, but Tony doesn't acknowledge it any further. He can't wait anymore.
After old Master Yinsen had passed, the castle was in dire need of someone with all the qualifications necessary to take over his many duties.
Surprisingly, the extent of the examination is within reasonable limits. They draw some blood (six vials, to be exact), take his measurements (all of them), have him spit in a tube, do some basic strength tests (good enough stress relief) and finally match his profile against a picture of a man who he can only imagine is this universe's late Steve Rogers.
A vivid image of the Red Skull’s ghostly form flashes in front of his eyes, and Steve shakes his head quietly to himself. No.
timeline. He's still not entirely in the picture about the extent of the space stone's powers, and considering what it once did to the Skull, the possibilities seem virtually endless.
Maybe they would rouse the angry spirits of long-gone Starks woken from their forever-sleep to come down upon Anthony for disrupting their line of descent.
"Sorry, I was gonna say– Dinner's ready," Steve lets him know, coughing to paint over the awkwardness and the suddenly stifling temperatures in the room that have absolutely nothing to do with the heat crawling up the back of his neck.
, of course, there's the matter of piloting Iron Man, which should be one of his main exercise routines anyway, right? Wrong. Most of the heavy lifting the suits can do on their own at this stage, and the times he is actually needed and in it are few and far in-between.
Somebody sobs. It's Pepper, her body shaking as her head falls to her chest after she's kissed Tony's temple for a last time. When his legs buckle and he sinks to his knees, Steve understand it's not just her grief he's heard. His vision blurs through a veil of tears and his first inhale in what must have been minutes of holding his breath is an ugly, choked sob that shakes him in his core.
Lord Stark was said to have been close with his late physician and, naturally, felt reluctant to let an outsider slip into his role. Bruce understood these conflicting emotions that caused the man to keep him at an arm's length.
Stark, on the other hand… Nobody who’s alive today knows the extent of what he’s done to himself. Those people are long dead, or maybe wish they were. Stark has lived far past his expiration date, but he refuses to die with such vehemence that today he’s barely qualifying as living anymore.
Steve breaches him and groans a low noise somewhere deep in his chest, pressing wet, open-mouthed kisses along Tony’s jawline as he does. Tony utters a long-drawn moan as Steve splits him open almost torturously slow, pushing in inch by inch and savoring the delicious friction of Tony’s insides fighting against the intrusion.
Bruce tuned out the man's continued drivel to gather his equipment and supplies from the counters and cabinets in the chamber, returning to the two men right as the blond threw his hands up into the air.
is still up for debate.) Tony would be feeling something akin to happiness if he could still feel his body, but as it is, he doesn't think of feel much of anything.
Her tiny frame is standing in the door that connects kitchen and living room, barely filling out the space, eyes narrowed in a scowl. Everything about her demeanor speaks of Tony’s influence, but if he allows himself to look more closely, there are some typical Rogers traits, too. (The way she lifts her chin an inch in response to his stare, her stance ramrod straight as she meets him head on, arms crossed over her chest in a no-nonsense attitude and  inexorable determination that tells him she'll plant herself like a tree right here until she gets the answers she demands.)
He calls the man over for a refill and pushes his empty glass to the other side of the counter. Tony thinks he's overheard someone calling him Bill once, but the memory is blurry in his head and he doesn't have any desire to speak to the man any more than his desire for sub-par whiskey necessitates, so it doesn't matter.
Maria gapes at him when he slides it over to her. It's a rough sketch and not perfect by any means, but in her eyes, the uneloquent details don't stand out at all. "I'm hanging this in my room," she decides resolutely. Steve smiles. "I'm honored."
,” he taps his index finger against his temple, slow and deliberate. There's a manic sort of glee in his eyes. ”I know every mechanism, every circuit, every
And he doesn't know where that notion came from, is positive it wasn't there a moment ago, but now it is and he
He had just recently created a novel mixture of plants and herbs that would have a sedative effect upon inhalation, and was now looking to (rather deviously) use his newest patient as a test subject.
Some days, he manages. On others, he squeezes out a request for help between clenched teeth, and will look at the one hand in his lap as though the lack of its sibling is something he has to process all over again.
Soon, he'll take Tony and run. And one day, this will just be another among many close brushes with death.
, damnit) rounded pectorals that have lost the privilege of being referred to as such a while ago, because the picture you associate with the word isn't this. Steve has pecs, the Adonis. Tony, well. He's scraping by, so to speak.
His eyelids are still heavy, but he forces them open and immediately zeroes in on the long blades of grass brushing the tip of his nose. Steve sits up, brushing leaves and small twigs off of himself while he does.
Steve releases the skin on Stark's neck that he's bitten multiple marks into, temporarily marking the omega as his. He slings an arm around the other's chest, now stained with the man’s own come, and carefully rolls them both to the side, making sure to face Stark inward.
“So, the Stones. You needed them. To fight Thanos, right?” A muscle in Tony’s jaw ticks when he mentions the Titan’s name. Steve shares that sentiment.
And then, the body in his arms moves and his voice sounds like he hasn't been asleep for a while now. “I don’t care,” Tony snaps, and there’s some of that fire again. “I just wanted a choice, Steve. You didn’t even think it appropriate to let me get a word in before you put me on the fucking chopping block.” He spits out the last few words, and Steve just about has it in him not to flinch.
Carol spoke, indeed, though she chose to withhold the more unpleasant details of the encounter. "I decided to keep my observations to myself. They need not know I happened to come across this, ah, private scene," she finished, regarding the other woman with an expectant gaze.
Tony's intently staring at the wall next to him. He's biting his lip when he looks back at Steve, and shoves his hands down the front pockets of his pants. (Hands. It's always Tony's hands that'll betray his nerves first, so he makes sure he won't get tempted.) His gaze drops down to his feet again. Clearly there's something he wants to get off his chest; all the signs are there.
Through the deafening screams, he hears them, more and more zombies gathering outside the door and demanding entrance. The blood makes it worse, Steve knows; they're drawn to it like sharks. It’s welling up in fountains of crimson from Tony’s arm, the same way the tears do from his eyes, so much so he can’t tell where exactly he’s made the previous incisions.
It was difficult not to notice the cause for the rumors – for one, there was Anthony's peculiar behavior.
With the used rag, he wipes away the sweat collecting in the hollow of Tony's throat. As he gently turns his head to do the same for the back of his neck, Tony’s hand comes up and locks around his wrist in a grip that is feather-light, barely qualifies as one.
Pierce believes he's still the impressionable man he once convinced could simply work off his debt and walk away when everything's said and done. But Steve has evolved from a science experiment to a lethal force that is all the deadlier for knowing its worth, while Perce has stagnated and grown content with what he believes is a position of eternal power.
He leaves the next morning, suited up, all the stones secured in a bag and enough Pym Particles in his pockets he could even make a detour back to the 40s if he wanted. (If he wanted. Maybe.
He hopes the heightened temperature and the chills that occasionally shake him mean his body is fighting the local infection and not a first sign of sepsis–if it's the latter, there will be nothing for him to do but to watch Tony die.
What he mentioned about building the train proves true as well, in spite of how little they all initially believed it to be true. Looks like they fell for Stone's thorough brainwash just like everyone else did.
The man was one of Cannon's. Him and a few others patrol the woods during the less hostile seasons of the year, scaring off wolves and rustlers to keep the peace. He'd worn an amicable smile when Rogers came striding through the door of his hut, one that had flickered and disappeared when he spotted Tony trailing behind him.
To his immense disappointment, the flirtation doesn’t get the desired response. “Last–?” Steve’s brows draw together and his mouth falls agape as he forms the word with his lips. “We landed the quinjet fifteen minutes ago.”
"You, um. You get it, right? That's why I can't," Tony sniffs and fiddles with his sleeves, "I can't let Maria see you. And you can't stay here, no offense. It would just– she'd understand, I think, but she shouldn't have to, not after going through all of this."
Not that he isn't glad they got the matter resolved. The Maximoffs aren't off the hook, but that isn't what getting them under the Avengers' care was about in any case. As long as they have any say in it, these kids won’t be rotting in a supermax for the rest of their days–because the place is, if Ross' word is to be believed, as super-secret as its inhabitants are powered, and nobody who goes in ever leaves.
“Walls, FRIDAY,” he said, feeling Steve’s heated gaze follow him as he stood and circled the table. His A.I. wormed her way into the building’s systems in a moment and cranked up the opacity of what before had been transparent glass panels–not a moment too soon, because the second Steve picked up on the lock on the door snapping close, he all but lunged for Tony.
It's moments like this where he doesn't look changed; at this angle, his bad arm is hidden from Steve's view and the light makes him appear younger, those years he has aged in the past month alone suddenly gone.
He's cursed to watch without the ability to relieve the pain once more, and Tony is no soldier. But because he's the man Steve loves and this is something he
Steve watches Tony’s lips twitch with the knee-jerk urge to object, to maybe give a reply along the lines of
“I can, and I will. Leave, Lord Hammer. Please. Do not embarrass yourself in front of your people any more than you already have,” Sir Rogers said, his calm voice almost slipping into resignation.
“But you just won the lottery, because I know a lot more things Stone doesn’t. I can take you wherever you need to go
His brain might be conjuring up that next particular detail to comfort him in a situation that leaves little for him to be comforted by, but he thinks he sees a certain remorse in the tight lines of her features.
Lord Stark's good hand fiddled with his mount's reins, yet again reminding of that day they'd ridden out. Then he raised his head, gaze fixed to a point in the distance.
If anything, Maria looks more sceptical than before. In his defense, nobody ever tells you there might come a day when you’re going to have to explain the concept of a multiverse to a five-year-old, even if aforementioned child may very possibly be brighter than most her age.
There's a group of people in the recording, all in varying states of inebriation and some of them wearing pointy party hats. Steve's pretty sure he can see Natasha on the left and, of course, Tony, right by his counterpart's side.
They haven’t said the words. Yet. Not since – years ago, when the greatest concern on their minds was the Accords and not a Mad Titan erasing half of the universe’s life with a snap of his fingers.
Through half-lidded eyes, he observes his reflection, feeling distanced from the man in the mirror as though someone else is looking back at him. His counterpart is flushed all over, some strands of his hair sticking to his forehead with sweat, dick leaving a wet smear against his hipbone.
The silent, brooding rage toward a man not present rings in Stark’s voice and shows in his bloodshot eyes as he scrapes layer after layer off the final piece of Kronole in precariously calculated motions. His mouth and nose are hidden under the piece of cloth he’s tied around the better part of his face, protecting him from the fumes that have gotten Steve lightheaded more than once as he watched him work.
The answer to all the vaguely interwoven questions in her mind came in form of one Lord Justin Hammer the following day. She misliked that truth more than she could say; this man was what she had once feared Anthony Stark might be, yet many times the worse. His person in itself was intolerable, self-serving and presumptuous. His smile was an empty one and his quick tongue only spit lies and deception.
The smile on his lips drops, dead and gone, and the laughter in his throat threatens to choke him. Steve thinks he might have forgotten how to breathe. He can only stare, transfixed and unmoving, as Tony's beaten and battered form comes to rest behind a large piece of rubble like a dying animal slinking away into a dark corner to breathe its last breath.
Finally, after making sure that Tony isn't awake anymore, Steve stands up and pulls the brunet securely into his arms. When he walks, the boards croak loudly underneath his feet, but Tony only frowns in his half-sleep and exhales a shuddering breath into Steve's shirt. Steve carries him into the house and up the stairs into his room, wrestling with doorknobs and handles in his way but ultimately succeeding.
This is everything it takes to break his resolve. Tony is pleased. Steve pulls his fingers out, other hand spreading him open, and Tony knows he’s watching. His face is hot. Steve has barely grazed his prostate and the pull in his groin is already all too palpable. He clenches a little around Steve’s fingers as they slip out. Steve groans, deep in his chest, evidently at both the sight and feel of it. Tony knows how to make him weak alright.
Rogers hasn't noticeably gone out of his way to keep its contents secret, but Tony can definitely sense that this is something private, that there is a certain protectiveness he feels toward it. It means that in one way or another, there'll be answers in this book. Answers about this man who is so peculiar in the way he locks everything away behind a face that seems to know only the matter of fact. Answers Tony
Steve chuckles at the shameless display of need but humors him, folding his body over Stark’s to bridge the space between them and get a better angle before he begins fucking into him in earnest. Stark yelps, unprepared, as the first few thrusts crowd him into the mattress – then, he begins to meet Steve’s movements with his own, their bodies colliding with sharp, wet slaps. There’s a possibility he isn’t even fully aware of it: a litany of small, guttural
really, for the lack of a better word. While there's still clear outlines of muscle visible through his shirt, the shape of him is different, his edges less angular.
Maria doesn't pay him any mind, walking past as he sits there on the bench with that ridiculous novel about the ghost whisperer. In fact, she rarely ever takes note of his presence at all except when it's called for, like a thank-you for dinner or a good night after that. Steve's a simple houseguest, and that's that – one that's a carbon copy of her lost parent, but just a guest nonetheless.
He only grunts in acknowledgement when Tony slaps a ten-dollar-bill down in front of him to settle his debts, and then makes off with the money clutched in his fist. The guy's an asshole and doesn't particularly like him, yes, but since Tony's a regular and always pays up, the service is good enough.
being a moron and all, can obviously see that it will only take a mild blizzard and a new, heavy layer of snow to trigger an avalanche. Doesn't take a genius (or intricate mountaineering knowledge) to figure that out.
"I suppose – well, I would need to contemplate my final answer for a while, but if you are sure I am what you wish for in a successor, then I would be honored to accept," he said, congratulating himself for how expertly he'd hidden the waver in his voice.
They might've made enough noise to alert someone in the vicinity to their presence. He wonders how that looked from a distance–bouncing on Steve's dick, throwing his head back, sweaty in a way that had nothing to do with the sunny weather.
But then he gives Steve a quick once-over and cuts himself off when the old-school military getup takes him by surprise. Steve uses that opportunity to try and explain himself, or, well– explain that he doesn't have much of an explanation for any of this, either.
Tony's gone through enough himself, there's no need to burden the man with emotional baggage that's not even his own.
Tony squeezes around his dick at the next push and the other man's motions lose their uniformity, his hips snapping forward reflexively as he sucks in a breath. Steve tries to conjure up a disapproving glare, but he's fooling no one. Tony feels his grip tightening, sees the sweat pooling in the hollow of his throat and his face screwing up minimally in concentration.
He nods. It’s not like he knows much about childbirth, especially in this world that continues to defy all limitations he’s ever thought the human body had, but he supposes it would make sense, for someone of Tony’s age and medical record. Or, well– Steve has no way of knowing if that applies to this Tony too, but he’d wager it does, seeing as the events in both their timelines are largely similar.
Now, too, the man with a plan is on a quest to search for a solution to the problem, and–oh. Not complaining about that. His hand has reached down to wrap around Tony's cock lying against his stomach, once again limp.
Beside drawing, Maria has also helped him prepare breakfast multiple times, glad to find someone already up in the kitchen as she came downstairs. (Tony hasn't outright mentioned it to him, but he's definitely benefited from the fact that he isn't being dragged out of bed every day anew at what he'd consider the asscrack of dawn.)
"Man by the name of Cannon got his cattle stuck up there 'cause an avalanche went down and blocked off the pass. And
Once dawn broke, their small party packed up and prepared for departure. It was then that James once again found himself in the presence of Steven Rogers, whom had resided in their camp ever since the battle.
She had been following her heart's wants ever since, and she would not stop now. If she were to marry a man and give up her love for adventure in favor of a quiet life hidden away in a homestead somewhere, she might die of unhappiness. This was not what her mother would have truly wanted for her, she was sure.
Steve’s heard whispers they made adjustments to the serum since he received it. Why, he isn’t sure; he's learned to control himself since his first few assignments. And yet, the others tend to get an odd look in their eyes when he indulges in their requests to tell his story, the one of the lab and his final rebirth. They always seem awfully eager to end their conversation as soon as possible once he’s finished.
His Highness sent out carrier pigeons and messengers to spread the word and rally up what was left of Killian's forces. Rebuilding efforts would have to be begun in haste, and so as soon as dawn broke the following morning, both Lords, one born and one made, set off on the journey back to Mar'vill.
"It has to be–clones, or, or something in that ballpark, right? There's no other…" He starts typing furiously, pulls up reports and documents from missions past. "We thought we took care of their main operations, but what if we didn't, what if there's more?"
She makes sure he doesn't witness her presence, but he finds his body rearranged into a more comfortable position or covered with a blanket whenever he wakes up after having nodded off for a while. (The while grows longer every time.)
It’s a helpless, livid hysteria that seems like the brain’s natural response to the prospect of losing (part of) a limb, of being taken apart, brutalized so entirely against one’s will. Steve knows it’s something horrible to put a person through, and even if Tony pulls through, the look of utter betrayal in his eyes is something Steve thinks he’ll never be able to fully atone or stop hating himself for.
With fumbling fingers, he pulls the bottle out and the cork off. He doesn’t, as would be the sensible thing to do, fill his flask and leave it at that. The haze of his craving has him chugging the last remains of his supply, and when the final drop lands on his tongue, Tony blinks in bewilderment like it hasn’t all disappeared in his own greedy throat but dried up with the snap of a finger that he had no control over whatsoever. When the severity of the situation dawns on him, it takes his all (the fear of Rogers seeing and looking askance at him in his misery) not to smash the bottle on the floor in frustration.
As his aunt was said to sell some of the best pale ale in all of Hattam, visitors from within the castle walls were no rarity. Of course, nobody in the establishment ever quite expected the Lord himself to make an appearance, although others claimed he had, when in the mood for it, mingled with the commons many times prior.
He thought he would be different, when it came down to it. Steve thought he'd hold onto his calm rationale even faced with his greatest nightmare, but it turns out he's still every bit as human and flawed as the rest of them. Maybe more so. After all, the serum enhances everything, good and bad. And Steve's devotion to Tony knows no bounds, but neither does the depravity that comes with it.
Bruce instructed the man lay him out on the raised cot on the far side of the room so he could determine how much damage was done. As he carefully unwrapped the bandages, Anthony squirming with discomfort, he looked at Rogers still on the other side of the table and inquired, "How did this happen?"
Tony lifts both his hands to his hips and turns back around, maybe digging his fingers harder than necessary into the equally soft flesh there.
“Me,” Peter rushed to say. The Lord, understandably, did not believe him until he had explained the functionality of the device to him in an amount of detail that only its creator would be capable of.
As it turns out, joining a glorified coalition of neo-nazis gets you pretty far up on the UN's shitlist, so the initial skepticism was to be expected. If there's one thing Tony hates it's bureaucracy, but damn him if he's going to disallow someone the chance to atone for past mistakes. (Without redemption, what would he be? Just the man who killed the last generation of Maximoffs?)
Tony doesn’t think, because Steve gets to play vigilante on the other side of the ocean while he’s here
In time, Steve can push a finger in. With spit being the only lubricant, the drag is a lot rougher than usual; he watches Tony suppress a flinch as he begins fingering him in earnest. But with pain comes desire, and Tony bites his lip as the thrust of Steve’s fingers is joined by Steve moving his hips in the same rhythm. The implication that Steve could have him like this does something to Tony; he reaches up behind him to drag Steve down by his hair and seal their lips together forcibly.
“Do I really need to spell it out for you?” Tony asks suddenly, his tone exasperated but his eyes tired.
Steve knew he looked dumbstruck, like a fish out of water, but he'd just had one of the best orgasms of his life and he couldn't be bothered to employ more brainpower than the one needed to raise a single, questioning eyebrow at their audience.
They arrive at eight on the dot next morning, in trademark, inconspicuous SUVs with only the eagle emblazoned on the side of the vehicles indicative of their sender.
Except he's Iron Man, and his core is fucking Iron Man-grade, and his body should be Iron Man-esque too. Nobody without some proper abs, obliques and back muscles can pilot a half-ton, flying exoskeleton, so why doesn't he look the part? It's so far from fair Tony feels those traitors of tears stinging in his eyes again.
Steve purses his lips and rubs his neck, trying to quench the embarrassment flaring up. She's a Stark – of course he can't keep up, not in this regard.
He nodded. “Yes, thankfully.” James outstretched his hand for a formal introduction, “Sir James Rhodes, Iron Guard.”
Steve opens his mouth to argue, but Fury holds up a hand to silence him before there are any words spoken, and he begrudgingly follows suit.
Disappointment spreads in him, heavy as lead. Is that it? After all this, after they have danced around each other with this
Steve isn't sure whether Tony's trying to keep him from looking at her or the other way around, but he'll respect that decision. Considering how Tony has been staring at him, he should probably be grateful to not have been fried by his repulsors five minutes ago.
One look at him sufficed to determine what caused his pain: the ankle of his bare right foot was swollen with dark bruises underneath a makeshift bandage haphazardly wrapped around it.
The journey back to Earth, Tony realizes, is bound to take longer aboard the Benatar. The ship is in good enough condition, but the distance between the Milky Way Galaxy and this one is immense and possibly even greater than the human mind fully comprehends.
The words receive the desired response: Steve huffs a sudden laughter, and something in Tony that isn't Steve's dick swells and tingles pleasantly with the sound. Eventually though, his laugh trickles off and leaves only a subdued smile–Steve is aware he's only deflecting.
He's begun to dislike his body's infallible ability of self-healing. Who would've guessed Erskine could do his job
Yet somehow, it happened, and it kept happening, and it wouldn't stop happening. They had their ups and downs, probably more so than the regular couple, but Tony for one is giving them both a pass because they've got quite the shitload of baggage each but been putting the work in and coming out victorious regardless.
is not a question of morality, but one of cost effectiveness. A question easily solved, at least in his book.
While James' stories of his adventurous forays into amorous territory always made for entertaining conversational material, it one day struck him that Anthony never really did share anything of the sort himself.
Tony doesn't mind, although he does seem a little surprised when he looks up from the car engine that just a moment ago swallowed his entire upper body.
“–always will,” Steve finishes for him, lips twitching up and down as the pretend smile clings to the corners of his mouth with all its might but is overshadowed by the force of his breaking heart.
They would have to repeat it come another day, but he decided to let this sobering information go unmentioned for the time being. He moved to the adjoining room to store away his remedies, taking inventory of the ingredients left as he did.
, and although the gaping hole he leaves in his wake will take time to heal, his smile and easy humor do a lot more for all the people in the room than a forced, sober goodbye ever could.
In any case, Steve doesn't care as long as the final outcome is the same and there's less fuss made about it. The fur Tony is still clinging to falls down his shoulders and pools around him as he settles. Steve moves him around to open his zipper and free himself from his suit pants. As is always the case in Tony's presence, he's fully hard in a couple of strokes.
Except Tony's hand fists the front of Steve's shirt, clutching the material in a forceful hold, and his bottom lip trembles as he says, "It was you, that time."
The mirror shows them from the side; Tony drinks in the image presented there. Steve’s an unstoppable force behind him, skin glistening with sweat, muscles rippling as his hips piston back and forth in tandem with the grunts forced out of his lungs. His face is a colorful blend of emotions directly aimed at Tony.
just a little something more because the image popped up in my head one day and wouldn't go away (and i really need to stop thinking about it).
Steve winces, but doesn't avert his gaze. Tony's not wrong – it's different now, and he might make things worse with his good intentions. But then, he thinks of never quite being able to look away, never quite managing to say
And he thought he'd built up a tolerance to trouble in the noplaceville that is Red Rock. Apparently, no such luck.
. The solution. Strange said I needed to find the way, and I did my part. But you–” The itch in his throat gets too intense. Tony coughs violently to relieve it, and Steve’s eyes turn dark and mournful as if Tony was already dead. “You need to do your part, Steve. Promise me. Promise me you won’t walk out on me, not on this. Please. I need this. Steve?”
When gravity finally has Tony meeting the ground, everything fades into the background in behalf of the sudden, debilitating spark of pain shooting up into his body from a place low in his leg. He cries out despite himself, but manages to muffle any further sounds as the initial surge passes and only a continuous, hot throb in his ankle is left.
Over the past years, it was rumored he had found a love in the gallant Ms. Potts, steward of the castle and Stark's most trusted counselor. While the news of a woman steward were unheard of, a secret affair between a common carpenter's daughter and her Lord would be considered simply outrageous.
Tony groans a choked-off noise into his mouth. The pitch of it leaves Steve suspecting it to be a sound of pain rather than pleasure, so he aborts his movement and pulls out gently, patting Tony’s flank soothingly when the other man protests and shoots him a disgruntled look over his shoulder.
Whoops. Evidence suggests some of that may have made it past the filter. Honest mistake. Tony quirks an eyebrow at Steve in the mirror and does a lazy half-shrug to say, 'What? It's true, anyway'.
The physician had jumped from his seat the very moment the door swung open and was on his way to assess the situation.
The knowledge that the hidden barriers he's putting up are futile when it comes to Steve doesn't bring the once standard-issue dread with it. Incredibly, Tony has learned to accept that the whole package-deal of a stable relationship includes letting your significant other in, inviting them to figure you out and vice versa.
"Are you drifting off here or choosing to ignore me?" Steve asks, but it's not accusatory. His voice is soft, puffs of air still tickling Tony's ear, and his gaze travels from Tony's eyes in the mirror down to where he's stroking his thumbs up and down his skin.
"I want," Tony says, voice so hoarse he has to clear his throat before he can continue. "I want you, right now, inside, I–"
He's painfully aware he should've expected something like this from the beginning. It was Nebula, after all, who told him all about the circumstances in which her sister had died. She argued that Thanos wouldn't have laid a finger on his favorite daughter if it wasn't absolutely necessary, which led one to the conclusion that something happened on Vormir that inadvertently called for Gamora's death.
Steve grips his pen a little harder in annoyance and casts a glance at the pendulum clock on the wall opposite his desk. He has another five mission reports to go over and by the looks of it some bones to pick with three of the authors, whether figuratively or literally remains yet to be determined.
The knight cleared his throat to shed the all too telling rasp he knew his voice must have taken on – although it would do little to aid him deny Anthony's bold proposal, seeing as his body had already betrayed his interest.
was pretty comical, if Rogers' amused chuckle was anything to go by. (Tony remembers that noise clear as day, because he thought it somehow sounded the way honey tasted. It's burned into his memory, hoarse and low and warm. Rogers doesn't chuckle often, and he smiles even less, but when he does it's a sight to behold.)
There's something about the deep of the night that is more intimate here. Everything is still and swallowed by darkness but for the patch of land where they have set up camp, illuminated by the crackling fire. From nightfall until daybreak, the world is condensed to this small, freezing speck of earth, and they're the only people in it. Everything could happen here, and none of it would ever leave these mountains.
He pulls through, because it’s Tony, and if he can’t, who possibly could? Tony makes it out the other side, except his hollowed, bloodshot eyes talk not only of loss and defeat but also a bitter, quiet acceptance that scares Steve to death. He never thought he'd see the day where he looks at Tony Stark and has the broken shell of a man who once stood tall and proud even in the face of doom and destruction look back at him, but he finds out that there is indeed a first time for everything.
By the time he removes his fingers to slick his neglected (but still very much rock-hard) dick, Tony’s panting and his skin glistening with sweat. Steve shuffles closer, one leg between Tony’s, grabs his thigh and holds him open to gain better access. Tony’s fisting the blanket they’re still partially covered with and sighs with something akin to relief when the tip of Steve’s cock nudges his entrance.
Tony's eyes go from wide to narrowed in a matter of seconds and his voice is a hiss when he says, "Who the
Tony gasps, more out of surprise than pain. His fingers curl around Steve’s bicep and he shoots him a
Lying to himself seems like an infallible strategy until a particularly bad day comes along. Nine o'clock sees him almost getting caught by an unannounced visitor, which leaves him twitchy and irritable for the rest of the day. Pair that with swollen ankles, mounting back pain and a sudden migraine, and Tony is almost proud he makes it into bed instead of laying down on the floor somewhere and succumbing to fate.
It’s a word Steve has often been on the receiving end of coming from Tony, and on any other day, it would lead to a half-hearted argument that ultimately deescalates into bickering for the sake of it. But today is far from an ordinary day, and Tony’s voice has lost any airy lightheartedness it ever carried, familiarity replaced with fear in the face of Steve’s countenance and what it will be forever associated with in his mind.
Tony trails behind the group, keeping his gaze locked onto Rogers who is far ahead taking the lead, steering them out of the narrow mountain basin they found the herd in.
"See, it's never been a, ah, physical matter that has prevented me from siring a child. Some things would have just been easier if I had been born a woman." He paused. "And others much harder, I suppose."
It turns out Steve does not, in fact, need magic to do mind-blowing things. (But that's one of the things Tony already knew, didn't he?)
Victory comes with a price, as all things in life do. The universe wants for a tribute, and Tony Stark is the man who once again readily,
Needless to say, no representatives of the latter persuasion made it onto the train when the world did indeed go to shit and it ended up being humanity's last hope after all.
When Steve came close, his movements grew erratic. Not entirely uncoordinated, but rougher, chasing his own release. He bit down on Tony's neck, pressing his front flush against Tony's back, scenting him.
time to get here, Tony, you have no idea. Everything that happened, everything I did, it was all for you."
His pelvis slams into Stark’s rear with brutish force every time he drives back in, and he squeezes his eyes shut to relish the glorious friction and warm moisture of the walls gripping him.
The vein on his forehead, on a scale of ‘visibly protruding’ to ‘potentially explosive’ appears to have reached the upper third of that very spectrum, and Tony mentally prepares to take a few hits to his dignity to avoid escalating the situation.
Although the guilt taking hold of him is unreasonable, Steve can't help but feel responsible. It's hard not to, witnessing the way Tony muffles his sobs in his fist in a last ditch effort to conceal his cries and curls in on himself tighter with every tremble that passes through his body. He wants to put a hand on his shoulder, pull him close and provide comfort, but where before the intimacy came naturally, it now feels like an invasion of privacy.
have to freeze his ass off out here while Rogers gets to be inside – but then the other man dragged a chopping block out of the shed next to the outhouse, muttering some profanity or other under his breath, and began splitting the too-large pieces of wood stacked up alongside the eastern wall of the hut.
Only almost, though. This could arguably be considered the worst week of Tony’s life, and he does smell the part when Steve buries his nose in his neck and breathes in. No matter how bad, though, it can never be worse than the scent of rotten flesh. Soon, he’ll make sure to help Tony to a proper wash, so they can get rid of at least the temporary marks that have been left.
He repeats this process a second time before the telltale creak of the stairs alerts him to someone’s presence. The noise is almost inaudible, the person’s steps perfectly calculated – anyone else surely would’ve missed it.
"Are you alright?" Anthony inquired, not quite able to keep the amusement out of his voice as he regarded the boy.
This time, and all the ones to come, he’ll do right by him. Whatever that may mean, in the end. If it means to never even come close to touching Tony again, he’ll do it–with a bleeding heart, but he will do it. As long as Tony’s here, alive and breathing, Steve is going to cope.
In reality, Lord Stark spent the following days in and out of consciousness and although his life was no longer hanging by a thread, he was in no condition to interact with anyone longer than his continued well-being required.
The light is bright and blinding, and all he can make out is the outline of a person shielding him against the worst of it as they kneel above him. He blinks slowly, the process of moving his eyelids a difficult one, but with time, the picture of the person in front of him sharpens.
“Figures you'd be hungry after that performance,” Tony teases, smirking because he can’t help it. “Stud.” Steve rolls his eyes at him and presses a quick peck to his jaw, which is when Tony is blessed by a sudden stroke of genius.
This was not to say he hadn't heard about the rumors, of course. Even if he had tried not to listen, the whispers were loud even in a deaf man's ears. This was not a figure of speech – Stark's best bowman, a fellow named Clint who had lost his hearing at a young age, was in no way less aware of the things people told. In fact, he appeared to be one of the greatest conspirators inside the castle gates himself.
"I know, and I'm sorry, Tony, but– But right now, I think distance is a sensible solution until we figure out something else. It doesn't have to be forever," Steve answers, with resolve he doesn't feel. He mostly feels callous, and that feeling is reinforced once Tony's deathly glare crumbles and reveals the deep hurt beneath.
Tony, staring into his own distorted reflection that frowns at him from the remains of the amber liquid at the bottom of his glass, experiences a moment of clarity.
Looking past the obvious damage, it’s easy to tell he’s a first-class. Or was once; it would seem he’s been downgraded just recently. Blood there may be, but he’s got no real dirt or grime on him, his hair plastered to his forehead with sweat but not unkempt beyond that. His facial hair is meticulously trimmed as well, the edges on his beard precise to nearly impeccable.
Tony flinches when he hears his name called, dark apprehension taking root inside of him at the sound of Steve’s voice. It lifts into something cheery toward the end of his name. Too familiar, too much.
was a lesson. This is something else. Maybe it’s the universe’s good intentions gone bad; maybe there was an attempt to make something right, to bring two lost souls together through a glitch in the matrix.
Not too far from the shore, a small archway of white stone has sprung up from the previously empty patch of sand. It's the only discernible change as far as Tony can tell. Steve has spotted it too, holding out a hand to pull him upright. Tony accepts it, exchanging a fleeting glance with the other man to ensure they both have the same idea of how to proceed.
"I get it," he says, voice rugged it sends a shiver down Tony's spine, and turns away to fetch one of the hay bales.
Once he isn't preoccupied with the repeat action of lifting the fork, chewing and swallowing anymore, Tony returns Steve's not-so-clandestine glances. "What is it?" he asks in between two swigs of red, his lips hitching upward when Steve blinks and clears his throat, almost a little bashful.
was to be taken literally or not, because his disappointment would be immeasurable if Steve decided its meaning was to remain PG.
Steve grimaces in sympathy, unsure of whether he should ask how it went. Probably not, though, considering Tony's subtle but very telling reaction from before when he feared Steve might have caught a glimpse of him behind the façade. They aren’t there yet.
He can’t help but feel wrong for it, slipping into this man’s clothes that are like a second skin on him, like taking his place could be just that easy. There’s certainly no profound message attached to this gesture, especially since Tony’s provided him with the clothes without making a big deal out of it, but the thought still leaves a bitter taste on the back of his tongue.
Tony is determined to keep digging through the nothing until he strikes gold. The first minor problem presents itself when he digs and digs and finds… more nothing.
They had met only by happenstance in his Aunt May’s alehouse, where Peter had been helping serve patrons and clean crockery ever since he was entrusted to her care after his parents died. He’d been too young to understand back then, and so he was never told what had truly transpired on that day – he knew now they had found their end through another’s hand, and that was quite enough.
The knock returns and, before Steve can demand what justifies the disturbance, the door opens to reveal his secretary. Sharon would (attempt to) shoot him if she was aware this is how he refers to her in his head, but it can't be denied that this is precisely her occupation when she isn't infiltrating Hi-dra for a change.
Doc Lee emphasizes again how strong and healthy his baby is, squeezes his shoulder wordlessly when she catches his half-hearted smile and sends him off with a prescription to help with the headaches.
He allows himself to think it now: this was an act of love. A cruel one, but who’s ever thought love to be tender and selfless? At its core, love is an ugly, feral thing. Selfish, too–Tony isn’t wrong about that. But if he’s lucky, he’ll get the rest of his life to prove to Tony that it can be much more than this. It can be more than this (blood, flesh, bone) because it
“So, here's the deal: One night. We have a guest room you can use. I'm calling Fury today and he'll send someone to pick you up tomorrow. Hopefully. Nah, he's definitely going to jump at the opportunity when he hears about this."
Reality, on the other hand, comes crashing into him in a tidal wave of nonsensical truths and pulls him under, and there underneath the surface, he sees that it's all been but the tip of the iceberg.
“It’s fine, Tony,” Steve reassures him. He wouldn’t find a reason to complain in any case when Tony could just as well have run him off his property the moment he caught sight of him.
Steve's fingers curl around the glove, painfully digging into the metal. When he looks at Bucky, he sees him in a future with Sam, laughing and bickering and
Steve nods in understanding and he leaves the sentence unfinished, instead turning to exit the room. The wooden steps creak under his weight as he makes his way up the stairs, and then it’s silent.
” he moans, hastily reaching out behind him until his fingers find Steve’s jaw. The other man gets the gist, leaning down and crashing their mouths together in uncoordinated desperation that is all the better for its imperfections. Spit dribbles down his chin, the kiss not dampening the urgency but rather stoking the flames, fire feeding from fire.
The other man sighs, but although his expression shows annoyance, his body grows rigid at the implication that Steve isn’t taking him by his word. His hand moves to scratch the back of his neck but the attempt is thwarted by the rope tying his wrists to one another, and so he yields to the pull and aborts the movement.
"They didn't conveniently leave out our terms and conditions, did they? This is why I don't like being passed off to your secretaries. Middle-men are bothersome in negotiations."
Tony thinks he hears something muttered underneath the mans breath that sounds a whole lot like, “You’re a menace, Carbonell,” but he is already slipping away.
Sympathy is the wrong word. Pity, more like. Pity, because Stark looks like he didn’t expect this to be a possibility. He was so sure nobody would ever be able to match him it catches him off-guard now. Even so, he’s devising another plan; Steve sees it in that unblinking stare of his as he scans the immediate vicinity for a way out.
Steve's down to his forearm when it gets harder and harder to bend the pieces backward and rip them off. When one comes off with a gross crunch, Steve realizes why. The material sticks to Tony's arm, the parts that were partially melted have eaten into his skin and with every plate he removes another patch of skin comes off as well.
He puts down an extra sheet, a clean one, and moves Tony onto it. Next are the supplies, which he assembles around the other man’s unconscious body. His hands tremble when he unwraps the soaked bandages from the stump, a disturbingly detailed record of Tony’s every scream and plea replaying in his mind at the sight of the grueling injury. It’s still oozing blood, too, although the liquid doesn’t come in the copious amounts it did before. Steve cleans it properly this time, water and alcohol, puts antiseptic ointment on and wraps it generously in a few, fresh layers of cloth before elevating the limb with a bunched-up blanket.
It was thrilling. Almost addictive, really, which became evident when Steve studied his own reaction more closely – his every muscle was straining with the effort to hold back, rein himself in and not give into the wild, animalistic desire that wanted him to plunge headfirst into that too-good feeling no holds barred.
out of Tony after the other, the noises rising in pitch, getting higher and shriller and spurring Steve on to make it even better the next time around.
In the center of the room, the ceiling light turns on automatically without missing a beat and Steve blinks against the sudden brightness for a moment before turning his focus back on Tony who's still there, taking in the scene in silence. His hair is unkempt, strands pointing in every which direction and some of them curling at the base of his neck. The loose sweatpants and shirt suggest he's already been in bed when his A.I. alerted him to the
Tony knows she'll quickly run herself ragged at this pace, and he's going to need to come up with something if he wants to reach the cabin today; their ascend to the plateau will take another four hours if the words of the ranger who'd seen them off at the foot of the mountain held any truth.
Eventually, Steve regains control over his limbs again and pulls out gingerly. They’ve already made a mess, so it’s not like him watching the come drip out and down Tony’s balls does anything that hasn’t already been done. Tony chuckles hoarsely as he realizes what he’s doing, but bats his hand away when Steve tries to fondle the sensitive, swollen pucker of his asshole. Worth a try.
Infused with renewed determination, as though he’s shoved Steve Rogers aside and slipped back into Captain America’s boots, he gets up and walks to the box. He picks up what Tony's blurry vision identifies as the watch-like device and something even smaller. A vial, colored as deep a blue as his eyes. On his way back over, made in measured steps that reverberate in the too-large basement floor of the mansion, he tightens the strap around his wrist.
The first time Natalia Romanova saw herself face to face with the great Lord Stark, she near broke two fingers on his right hand.
To the young James Rhodes, the walls of the Iron Castle seemed vast and insurmountable, and the guards looked grim and frightening in their shining armor with polished steel at their hips. He would spend many weeks weeping and begging his mother to return to her father’s homestead in town until he begrudgingly accepted his fate at last.
There were various misdeeds she frowned upon; the love of two who loved deeply and genuinely was not one of them. If ever one found this secret true as she had and used it to bring harm to the men involved, she would be more than delighted to bring that wicked person down with her very own hands.
With a sigh aimed at no one, Tony calls it a day and pats DUM-E in passing as he exits the workshop. His concentration nosedived a while ago and he should put something on that burn. Steve's bound to get back home soon and if he sees it, he’ll scowl at Tony in that half-concerned, half-disappointed way of his and won't be persuaded into reunion sex until he’s played nurse.
Finally, after a few relatively relaxed but maybe a little too comfortable years, it has all accumulated to form… this. Him, Tony Stark of the present day, who is looking soft and vulnerable and not at all like he can hold his own in a fight against Villain of the Week.
"Don't bullshit me, Rogers," he hisses, voice tight and vicious with suppressed anger clawing itself to the surface.
isn't safe, and therefore Tony should be the one always on edge about the next time he'll fuck up (because he will). If it all crashes and burns, Tony will be the one to have triggered the detonation, in one way or another, and that's why he shouldn't be–
A pleasant surge of anticipation rolls through him as the head of his dick greets the man's entrance. Stark seems to suddenly be struck with the realization that what he's expected all along will occur in just a moment, and his hands reach out to fumble for leverage in front of him. A hopeless quest to escape Steve's touch. He must know there's no point in trying, yet he drags himself along the ground regardless before collapsing–face-down with a defeated grunt–into a sad heap.
Steve flips him over. Stark pants in both fury and immediate fatigue as he writhes on the floor while his body is arranged to Steve's liking, "At least have the
They were still far from the finish line – in the literal and figurative sense, seeing as Tony, for one, would only get to come once Steve would get to fuck him in earnest – but it wasn't as if anyone could even think to raise a complaint.
enamored thing. It is also when Steve looks at him that his erection gives a twitch within Tony, and
"So, tell me, how's this little adventure treatin' you, Mr. Carbonell? Everythin' you imagined it'd be?"
'Glorified blow-up doll' is what Tony called himself during one of his more lucid moments, and Steve supposes it's true but only in regard to his participation in the act. Everything else–from the feel of his tight, sucking heat to the sound of his desperate whimpers–is quite unlike an inanimate object.
His being awake is unmistakably courtesy of his daughter, because he's definitely wearing the look of someone who'd still be sleeping if he had gotten his way. There's an evident pillow crease across his cheek and his eyes are in the process of drooping close when Maria's excited voice hogs his attention.
You don't get to suck about half of MIT's dicks by virtue of your wunderkind title–even though a lot of them definitely got off on seeing the Stark kid, resident genius, on his knees. That position of power never was what it was made out to be, because anyone who put their genitals anywhere near his mouth was at
“Missed you, Tony,” Steve says. He's close, bowed over Tony’s back, his warmth surrounding him. The words have a reverent, desperate quality to them that makes something in Tony’s chest stir.
Not one to intrude on a scene not meant for him, Bruce turned away, averting his eyes and blocking out their voices.
Nothing that Peter had come to know of him in the past year even hinted at the fact that he was a bad man in any sense of the word – he did not need to know more.
Tony's gaze shifts away from Steve and up, where a still, clear lake makes way for endless sandy hills in the distance. It's eerily quiet but for the sound of the water. The sky is drenched in otherworldly shades of red and orange, and none of their surroundings seem familiar.
"Right. That's– good. Thanks for the heads-up," Steve answers, proud that his voice doesn't sound half as choked as he feels.
When there are only two left, the outlines of two humans manifest and the remaining pinkish dots melt into the center of their chests respectively.
“It’s all pretty complicated,” he says hesitantly, voice gentle in a way someone would speak to a spooked horse and shoulders hunched to appear as non-threatening as possible. “And I don’t really understand it myself. But I’m not here to hurt you, or Tony– your dad. I just need to get back home.”
No matter the time of week or the pressing matters at hand that begged to be attended to, Lord Stark
There's hands everywhere, voices in his ear, close, overlapping. One of the blurry shapes emerges from the mass. The man leans close and his hand comes up to lay over the arc reactor, and Tony’s heart pounds violently against his ribcage at the idea of being robbed of the device keeping it alive.
wanting to come home to your wife and daughter an egocentric motivation? It shouldn't be. He made a promise to Morgan, first and foremost. He promised he'd be there. Breaking that promise would be-- It would turn him into all the things he's always sought to avoid.
to keep looking. Maybe that something is Steve. Maybe it’s his private, sudden desire to witness himself fall apart on the off-chance that there will be something to discover that’ll get him to understand what it is that Steve
Next to him, Bruce and Clint moved to repeat the process from before, working with a practiced efficiency. Steve smiled gratefully at them when he caught their gazes by happenstance along the way. They still had about two thirds to go, and the both of them had been a great help so far – he really was thankful, considering him and Tony would get the most out of this.
Tears glitter in Not-Steve’s eyes. Tony wants to sink his fingernails into them. This man doesn't have the right to cry, not with the things that journal alluded to he did.
The next few evenings, he's alone in the cabin. Rogers doesn't encounter any predators during his stay at the camp but insists it's necessary they keep watch and isn't to be convinced otherwise.
They turn left at the next crossroads and the trail there is wider, enough to fit two riders comfortably next to each other. Tony pushes his mount into a faster trot to be on one level with the other man, trying not to let his discomfort show as Rogers looks over.
whatever comes out of his mouth. And right now, Steve's saying all these frankly outlandish things because he, his entire, too-good-to-be-true being, is convinced that this is what Tony is. Beautiful. Gorgeous. Hell, even perfect
The few things that survived Thanos’ onslaught on the compound get unearthed by the clean-up crew in the following weeks. Tony is digging through the remains, looking for whatever is left of the bots. Hopes against hope there is something to salvage.
Steve indulges in the fantasy for a moment: completing a mission, returning to a warm body already waiting, losing himself in it. Not having to be alone. Channeling his frustrations into something other than gym gear and adversaries, both of which leave something to be desired in terms of durability. Naturally, it would take time, but he can see Stark coming around at some point. Even that too-smart brain of his will come to the inevitable conclusion that there's no point in struggling and making life harder on himself when exemplary behavior will get him rewarded in various ways.
Steve is leaning over him, close again. The hand that previously held him open is now caressing the curve of his cheekbone, and Tony presses into his palm without a second thought. This is safe. It won't mean anything. This won't betray that Steve in him and those words coming out of his mouth are actually beginning to get the better of him.
There's the flurry of movement all around them, people shouting and running, yet Steve can only drink in the sight of Tony, alive and breathing as if he's never not been. It's okay, like this.
"I know this is something we haven't had before. Hell, we haven't seen an omega in years. But, Christ, people. We're
, without doubt," the blonde scowled in response to her lover's giggles, "but they are misguided. You won't do these foolish men any favors by allowing them to continue to think themselves safe. Talk some sense into them, will you?"
Of course, it's too late to pull up now. It's been too late for all of five seconds. All he can hope to do at this point is brace for impact and hopefully shield Steve from the worst of it. He knew the odds when he moved past the point of safe recovery.
It's not his right to feel blindsided, because he isn't. He knew this was going to happen – Tony announced they'd work with them from the get-go. As much as he wants to (wants nothing more, in fact), he can't hide out here forever. Not to mention that's not who Steve is; he might want to hide and pretend, but at the end of the day, he's going to go out and face the music. Get it done and over with, ugly as it may be.
Peter did not seem convinced, but dropped his objections nevertheless and waited to wave them off when they left.
for Steve. Tony being nice to himself helps get him off. That's where they are now, where Tony has gotten them, and… he can work with that.
but it goes a long way toward making him appear inconspicuous. Tony is pretty sure the only reason Steve didn’t shave it off earlier is to indulge him, which gives him all sorts of thoughts on how to make the most of this rare occurrence.
And perhaps, he isn't the only one out of the out of the two of them who is fighting tooth and nail to keep certain things under covers.
His finger is shaking. The other man raises a meaningful eyebrow at him, as if to say ‘There, you’re proving my point and contradicting your own’. He hasn’t budged an inch where he’s standing even in the face of Tony’s ire, and now too, his stance and face remain unmoving.
“I hate you,” he repeats, a hiss this time, and his body slumps, limply dangling from the metal framework of the shelf he's tied to.
Tony's gaze travels up from where he's been staring, transfixed, at a knot in Butterfingers' mane. (He'll have to brush that out later. Or cut it off. Depending on severity.) They haven't talked in what must be hours, and it's strange to hear the man address him so suddenly. His mind already begins to associate Rogers' low baritone with a feeling of comforting familiarity, which is, frankly, scary.
“Look at that.” Steve grunts as he quickens his speed, sacrificing long thrusts for sharp stabs. “Nobody's touched you since you made yourself this way, have they?”
And the moments-that-aren't happen occasionally, but after, they shake themselves out of it, brush off the dust and move on. Tony still hasn't voiced any regrets about allowing him to stay with them, and that's already a plus in Steve's book.
Not that Steve's ever really been on one (well, there was that weekend in Prague, but it'd been a business trip that Tony dragged him along for so he never counts it), but he figures this is what being on vacation must be like.
"Hey, big guy," he drawled, weak smirk accompanied by a wink. Big was– an understatement and Tony knew, but Steve felt like he'd never let him live it down if he pointed that out (even though it
He's looking at him like he's got half a mind to send him back where he came from. Suddenly, the thought of returning to the rats and the booze and the bed with the springs poking into his back doesn't sound appealing anymore.
With a satisfied groan, Steve bottoms out–and can only bear to hold out for a heartbeat or two before he starts rocking into the body beneath him at a slow pace that grows less measured with every time he repeats his assault.
The other man scoffs, his disgruntled stare solidifying. He crosses his arms over his chest defensively. “Yeah? Well,
Today, it’s late when they pack and leave the beach. The sun’s glowing orb melts into the ocean as they climb the cliffside staircase. On the way back to the house, there's bootprints on the trail that weren't there before, and Tony gets pulled out of his musings.
It's strange that Tony wouldn't build a failsafe into this suit like he's done with so many others. In case of emergency, he's always had multiple alternative energy sources ready for activation should the main arc reactor be damaged. Clearly, this one's been built for speed and maneuverability and therefore, protection and armor plating had to take a step back in favor of making the suit more lightweight, but something still rubs him wrong about this.
His anger at himself gets directed outward as he shoves the door open with a momentum that has it shaking in its hinges and banging against the wall behind. Noise is always the first thing that will get you unwanted attention, so Steve reigns himself in. Later, there’ll be time for guilt, for rage and self-loathing. Right now, it’s Tony’s fragile life that demands his attention, and Steve can’t fail him again. Not this time.
Today, he's writhing in the sheets, halfway to delirious, mumbling unintelligible nothings underneath his breath. Steve wishes he could take the pain in his stead. Were it possible, he'd have done it from the very start without hesitation.
“I love you too,” Tony whispers, quiet but just as sure in return. The words almost get punched out of him. “Always have–”
Steve smiles at him as he enters, sweat causing his running gear to stick to him in a way that makes Tony turn his head to watch him cross the kitchen. He presses a kiss to Tony’s cheek in passing as he fetches a gatorade from the fridge and then disappears upstairs without another word.
He noticed. Of course. The long looks and contemplative gazes wouldn't go past anyone, and Tony even less so. Steve figures he's always been a lot less subtle than he assumed he was.
Point being, they studied those paintings together and came to the conclusion that they weren’t perfect. Masterpieces, sure, but there’s no true golden standard that every single one of them can be compared and held up to because that’s just… not how art works. (Tony is pretty sure there's a metaphor about ideals of beauty somewhere in there.)
,” he implores, and it’s measured, now that Steve’s still across the room, a threat far enough away he can keep the arising emotions at bay for the moment being. Steve is done collecting what he needs, butcher knife in one hand and cloth in the other, flask of ethanol between his teeth.
The request is quiet. It’s how Steve gets when he’s tense: flat-voiced, no nonsense. (But then, who is Tony to say what is unique to Steve and what isn’t? As evidenced, he’s easily fooled.)
The words coaxed a deep, guttural sound out of the man whose eyes rolled into the back of his head as he swallowed noisily, grip on the ringmail spasming.
Tony lets himself drop down on a rectangular block of stone on one side of the arch, supporting his elbows on his thighs as he buries his face in his hands. When there's movement to his right, he lifts his head, one hand moving up to fist his hair.
Romanoff is the same as he remembers her: a flash of red clad in all black, wearing her tangy perfume the same way she does cool poise. She doesn't even bat an eyelid when the first face she sees isn't Steve but Tony, in his lap and naked, nor does she miss a beat when Steve invites her to sit on the chair across from him.
He hasn’t known that kind of serenity in as long as he can remember, has forgotten what it feels like, when everything
He's stranded somewhere in a thick broadleaf forest. The trees are painted in different colors and in the process of shedding their leaves. Strangely enough, a feeling of familiarity arises within him as he regards his surroundings. Steve frowns, tries to think of a place he knows that fits this description, but comes up empty. He'll have to gather more information before he's able to make an educated guess.
Although it's obvious the inquiry is an attempt at deflection, Steve lets it slide. For the moment. Tony isn't delusional enough to think this isn't bound to come up again during the course of the evening. At the time being though, Steve only meets his gaze in the mirror with a dark, heated gleam in his eyes that sends a buzz zapping through Tony, and slides both hands underneath his thighs to pick him up in a sitting position.
That hatred fuels him like it does them all, like it does Steve, and it’s a strange thing to bond over. An ugly thing to share, but they do. Share it. Feed from it, like they do from the tasteless protein bars they’re handed, every day anew, grab your share and run, and
"Let us take care of it, умняшка," Nat said softly, addressing Tony who had evidently been trying to suppress the sound indicative of his pain for a while. Steve felt a twinge of guilt, knowing he should've noticed sooner even through the hazy veil of excitement and lust.
In any case, conversations with Clint the archer often reverted back to gossip, which prominently featured Lord Stark and his rather gossip-worthy relation to Sir Rogers. Bruce was still of the firm belief that none of it concerned him, yet he was forced to fold when Barton inquired his opinion on the affair and insisted he answer truthfully.
you,” Tony wheezes through another sob, and there is more fervor in it than Steve expects. It’s honest. Stripped to his core components, there would be no way for Tony to lie. He hopes it’s the heat of the moment. He hopes there will be something left to salvage, after this. (But even if Tony does hate him for years to come, it’ll have been worth it, if he’s just alive.)
i did indeed fuck around with the civil war/infinity war timeline just to milk this for the maximum amount of angst.
It's hard not to eavesdrop on a conversation when your hearing is super-human and said conversation is taking place right next to you. Steve pretends not to listen while they exchange hushed words, the girl inquisitive and curious while Tony's grasping at straws trying to find an explanation for why exactly she can't interact with the person in the door.
Anthony, although he had yet to recover fully from his injuries, insisted they set out on their journey to King’s Landing only three days later. His condition didn’t allow for him to travel on horseback, so he begrudgingly accepted his place in the back of the wheelhouse a local merchant had provided them with.
Steve realizes what his ramblings are about. He holds a hand up, which promptly causes Stark to shut up and follow him across the room, where Steve pulls out a small pouch from behind the large stack of used cloth they’ll use to light the torches. Since nobody knew what their purpose was or why they were being sent, Steve collected and left them here, forgetting about their existence until just now.
He embraced the other Lord a final time. They had already discussed everything that called for it. James would return another time to the Iron Castle to gather is personal possessions and furthermore receive all the aid needed from Mar'vill in his efforts to rebuild Extrenia, the territory of the south.
The streak of red kicks loose an avalanche of unexplained need within Steve, its sight beautifully striking. He approaches the man, who rolls over and shuffles away like he can smell his intentions the way prey sniffs out a predator in the air.
Steve flings the severed limb away, shortly thereafter followed by the butcher’s knife. The counter is a single pool of blood creating individual waterfalls where it’s dripping onto the floor, forming another puddle at their feet. Tony’s slumped over, his legs barely keeping him upright, and his body shakes with sharp, hysterical cries and teeth-rattling sobs that have no beginning and no end. It’s a long string of continued misery of Steve’s doing.
“Yeah, I know. Sorry,” he answers and pushes down the swell of guilt as soon as it burgeons in his chest. No need to agonize about a lie of omission when there’s nothing substantial to hide. “That was one hell of a dream.”
“Harder,” he demands, taking note of how wretched he sounds and not caring in the slightest. Steve heeds the request immediately, and Tony squeezes around him to make the resistance that much better. “More, Steve, ha–"
Which model it is exactly Steve still doesn't know, only that it has no trouble going a breezy 100 miles per hour on a road that's marked at 50 while the built-in GPS screams at him to
“Well,” Steve mutters, leaning close so his breath will brush Stark’s ear. He gives a rough tug to the man’s cock and is rewarded with a breathy whimper. “Maybe I want them to hear.”
Against all odds and to his friend's evident astonishment, he listens to Pepper and brings in a team of professionals to advise him. Tony pretends to contemplate his options, but there’s no real decision to be made. He doesn’t need Steve for this. It’s the 21st century, people do the pregnant-and-single thing all the time. How hard can it be?
"And," Steve says, dark blue gaze twinkling with mischief just before he goes down on him again, "I think you know this is beautiful."
Tony heads back toward the remains of the giant, stony arch that towers above the mountain. It looks like it might've been part of a bigger structure once, like a palace. Vormir in itself is a visually appealing in nature, really, could've even been a profitable intergalactic tourist attraction if it wasn't for all the death and sacrifice.
“Thanos, the one from the past, he figured out what we were doing. Came back, tried to take the Stones.” Steve decides to get it over with quickly. Rip off the band-aid and it’ll hurt less. Figures. “Tony– he did it. We could've figured something out, I know it could've gone differently, but he just. It was down to him and Thanos, and he took the Stones and–”
Steve halts in his step and observes, the easy air about him gone as he takes the scene in. Tony might not be able to see him, but he knows it's this moment that his expression shifts into something equally puzzled and concerned, brows knitting and jaw squaring.
What's this supposed to be? A vision of death? Some interdimensional waiting room on the brink to afterlife? Feeling panic clogging his throat, Tony squeezes his eyes shut again and exhales shakily as he listens to Steve's faint breathing.
. It's so incredibly fitting, so telling of how Tony spent the last fifteen years of his life, and the way Pepper cradles it within her hands before placing it on the wreath talks of nothing but love and devotion for the man who traded his life for that of humanity.
"Too late to go lookin' for the herd now, we wouldn't make it back before dark," Rogers shouts at him from over his shoulder. "We'll have to go first thing in the mornin'."
His throat bobs when he swallows, hard, fingers twitching where he's laid his palm down on the counter. Steve averts his gaze before he gives into that incessant urge in the back of his head that so badly wants to take hold of Tony’s hand.
His complaints got stuck in his throat when Steve, still having him pinned against the tile as a side-effect of their play-fight, put all the energy he'd previously directed toward it now into a kiss more heated than the water had ever gotten.
He can't see Rogers and doesn't know where he's gone. Could be anywhere amongst the cattle, or maybe he's rounding the group to search the perimeter–
He should be happy Hi-dra wants him alive, or else he wouldn't even be getting the chance to partake in this exchange. The point is never to intimidate. Hi-dra doesn't have any reason to exercise their power for theatrics, they've long outgrown the need for show and dance. As always, it comes down to returns on investment–and they see fit to pursue Stark so relentlessly because they're aware of the possible reward.
Bruce's lips twitched with the hint of a smirk, and Clint rolled his eyes. The latter also was the one to say, "C'mon, man. We helped, now we want a proper show. Tony's gonna die of blue balls if you don't give him his time of day. And uh, me too, by the way."
Steve doesn't hold it against him. Then again, he's also not surprised when he sees the man drive up to the compound a few days later, nervous energy hidden behind a smirk and a fleeting mention of ‘oh yeah, and I’ve solved time travel, by the way’ because that’s just who Tony is.
Now, the unassuming piece of technology is just a reminder of something he’d rather push out of his memory entirely. But he can’t. It’s been bugging him for weeks (months) (a year) now. Nothing is out of the ordinary and it drives him mad.
And that's when he feels himself spacing out, strings of words falling from his lips without his permission or any conscious decision made, "I've always had a nice, ah, piece of ass, haven't I? Thighs too, that's all–all squats, baby. And I, mhhh, I haven't lifted he–ah–vy machinery all my life for no reason. I know it shows, in my back, and you always stare at my arms when I–that's why I keep wearing tanks around the workshop–"
Tony opens his mouth, stunned, and closes it again when the other man promptly goes back to his drawing. He bites his tongue. The man's devilishly handsome, intriguing
Steve swallows, nods, and approaches the last column of bunks, looking up. He doesn't know if Stark will even want him to – help. Heats are tough, but it's not that they can't get through them alone. Without any real relief, most of them just hurt; at least that's what he was able to tell, as an outsider. Steve already knows Stark can take a beating, and this probably shouldn't be all that different.
He's sure he'd been able to distinguish Tony's voice in the midst of battle. If he'd heard, he wouldn't have hesitated for an instant; he'd have done everything in his power to reach the man in time, share the burden of sacrifice. Maybe they could've had their happily ever after, together but apart.
The effect Tony had on him in any state would always be overwhelming, but he'd never been as attracted to the man as he was right then, gaze trailing from his flushed face and reddened lips over the graceful slope of his back to the swell of his ass, littered with traces of handprints and split apart by the overbearing intrusion of Steve's erection. It was almost– morbid, how this usually tiny, furled bodily orifice was dilated to accommodate Steve's girth. Some part of him hadn't believed it possible, but there he was, Tony in front of him and keening, wanton for more.
Steve's thumb massages his pucker, gentle at first but pushing past his rim every once in a while. Tony releases a long, satisfied sigh when he finally sheathes one thick digit in him and slowly fucks it deeper. He keeps grinding his erection against the sheets down below. Steve lets him. At two fingers, Tony groans, impatience and want intermingling. Steve doesn’t have it in him to refuse his silent demands; he gives him another one. It burns for a few strokes, which just stokes the arousal coiling in Tony's gut.
While Nebula navigates them through the boundless void of the cosmos, Tony occupies himself with other things. There’s no use in trying to identify their exact whereabouts, so he tinkers with his suit, assembles the leftover nanites until a somewhat functional helmet remains.
There's also the neat side benefit that the continuous pressure from the plug gets him hot enough his performance significantly improves when they're actually getting down to business. Win-win for everyone involved.
Not wanting to miss the bodily contact, Steve leans over him, blanketing Tony’s body with his own as he starts a quicker pace. It’s still not optimal, seeing as he can barely pull out without abandoning his initial position, but it’ll do.
He's a scam, isn't he? Hiding behind fancy suits (gold-titanium-alloy and Tom Ford ones) when behind it, all that's left is this. Hell, all of him is a lie. He hasn't been a playboy in decades, either. That tagline he made up for himself on the go doesn't really have that wow-effect anymore. Not that Steve would mind if he started using it again long as he swapped out that one particular part with "shitty-but-trying boyfriend" maybe.
life? That's… achievable. Tony won't want him around here forever, but he can imagine striking some kind of deal with Fury – a house, somewhere quiet, to forget about the guilt on the good days and make the regret sting a little less sharp on the bad ones. And in exchange, well.
Daylight wanes, and the shadows of the falling night begin to cling to every stone and every tree and every turn in the path before him. Behind every corner, every elevation, the trail keeps stretching onward.
They both contemplated this for a moment, the words settling heavy in the room, crawling away and squeezing in-between the cracks of the old stone and the graves within.
Steve shuffles far enough back on the bed he can maneuver them into a different position. It’s only for a moment, but as Tony gets on his hands on knees and Steve slips out of him in the process, the feeling of emptiness is overpowering. He’s become so used to the intrusion that now, his insides feel incomplete, open, stripped apart and dripping as he is.
"I think I'll manage," he says. It's only half a lie. "I'm not about to exaggerate my skillset, but I learn quickly. Just need someone to show me the ropes."
His friend looked off to the side and did not answer. He wore that same look of inner strife James felt he'd seen once before. He was taken back to their youth and that first time Anthony had allowed him a look at his true self.
“C’mon Tony,” he says, breath ghosting over his skin as he whispers into Tony’s ear. “Come for me, baby.”
There’s a light. And it flickers, shines through the storm sometimes clearly and sometimes not. There is nothing ethereal about it, nothing godlike. Not that he's ever believed in the nonsense anyway. The light's the same one he has, in the lantern that is always swinging from Butterfingers’ saddle, but the horse that’s approaching isn’t his and the rider sat on top–
Tony sucks in a sharp breath through his teeth when Steve's fist closes tighter around his shaft and starts working him in earnest, as opposed to the slow, lazy pulls from before. He brings up a hand to hold onto Steve's forearm–the one that's still cradling him against the other man's chest. It feels secure, limiting his range of motion in a way that is comforting instead of constricting.
"I was. I serve under Lord Rhodes now," she said easily, pulling a knife from her belt to impale a chunk of cooked mutton on its tip. Natalia eyed the man quietly as she took reasonably-sized bites from her meal, mirroring his previous predatory smile when the Lord backed away, looking disheartened at her display.
To both their dismay, the following years proved trying to their friendship, with their lives so deeply interwoven yet so far apart. The troubling times would only aid their bond to become stronger, however; in the end, they saw there was no helping the fact that they were not boys anymore.
God, he’d wanted to, but saying it would’ve felt like forcing himself on Tony when Tony might’ve not even been ready to hear or reciprocate the sentiment, and that was the last thing he intended to do.
Steve drops the glass, his fingers spasming and letting loose like his muscles have forgotten how to function in those two seconds it takes him to realize who's disrupted his nightly kitchen raid. The sound accompanying its untimely demise when it shatters on the floor is loud in the otherwise deadly silent room.
If anything, that gets Steve even more ramped up. After a last, heady tongue-to-tongue that leaves Tony lightheaded, he moves up on his knees completely, pounding into him at an angle that has him grazing his prostate once every few thrusts. It would never be enough for an orgasm, but it's just the right amount to keep him stimulated and enjoying the action through a low-simmering pleasure.
The last weeks were quite the journey, and this getaway isn't only the perfect opportunity to relax for a bit but a much-needed reminder that they'd do well to take some time for themselves more often. Tony doesn't want to have to wait for the next time Thaddeus Ross practically strangles him with red tape to go on a vacation again.
"Hey yourself," Steve answered, taken aback at the sound of his own voice. He used the time he needed to clear his throat to change their position, laying down to spoon Tony, still inside of him. "Was that good? Everything you hoped for?"
Tony sort of, kind of… implodes. He feels his own face being pulled into an angry grimace, and points an accusing finger at Rogers.
A dozen knights took part in the twelve challenges, the contests reaching from bare-knuckle fights to spear-throws and horsemanship. From his place far up on the tribune, bracketed by Lord Rhodes and Ms. Potts on either side, the resident Lord had a view of the entire arena, and he was visibly and audibly invested in the ongoing events.
," he says, voice dipping lower at the last word. Alright, he rejects Tony's thoughts on that one, that's not new. "This is amazing. Look at the fella I scored. You think that scrawny kid from Brooklyn ever thought he'd have more than a snowball's chance in hell of getting this?
She doesn't seem to intend to get hung up on the technicalities in any case, because her main concern is of an entirely different nature, "I heard you talk, and daddy said you'll have to leave again. I know he's sad. I don't understand why he wants you to go."
He noticed soon enough that it looked to be only slightly off from those the other knights wore. Not that the work had been done carelessly; it was quite the opposite, truth be told.
Steve keeps to the back. In any case, he doesn't believe he belongs there, between those people Tony considered family. He isn't sure what Tony considered him; not that, Steve is sure.
His voice is slow and calm in that very same way you’d explain something to a child, but there’s an underlying urgency. Tony snorts, affronted. The piece of omelet he just stuffed into his mouth is only half chewed but he swallows it anyway. Predictably, it hurts going down, and Tony pounds his chest with a fist to relieve the pain.
Their gasps and the wet slap of their bodies, the slide eased by Steve’s copious amounts of come, are the symphony of their pleasure, a filthy thing that makes Tony think
Tony doesn't bother to hide the sudden, nonsensical desperation in his actions. His motions are jerky and frantic as he reaches behind him and practically rips out the plug, tossing it across the bed. The discomforting emptiness he knew to expect is almost overwhelming and accompanied by the feeling of semen and lube trailing down the underside of his thigh.
Natasha did not have to think about with whom she would side, should the situation escalate into a fight.
A little undecided, he looks around the kitchen space for ingredients for a meal that would be easiest to whip together without making a mess. Tony did say to make himself at home, but Steve has his doubts whether that extends to cooking privileges. He hopes it does, because God, he could use a
Steve, though–Steve fucks his fingers in and out not even a handful of times before he pulls out entirely and rips Tony's pants down. Tony gasps, both in surprise and want, and willingly cants his hips up when Steve bows him further across the counter with a hand on the small of his back. Really, he has no choice but to obey, and that–
Next to his head, the wall is now branded with a fist-shaped dent. A mark that belongs to Steve, the wrong Steve, the
For all his philandering, Anthony Stark seemed to take remarkably little interest in the intimacies of women.
“Couldn’t wait any longer,” Steve says, as though their last time wasn’t just nine hours ago, and presses open-mouthed kisses to the back of Tony’s neck. There's a distant strain in his voice that gives Tony pause, but it’s hard to think with Steve’s hands down his pants.
Steve lays him out on their bed, located in what was once a living room. It’s a grand room with a high ceiling and a fireplace, which is why they’ve barely set foot in any other part of the house at all. Everything they need is here, and in case of emergency, they’ll be able to gather up all their belongings faster. It’s a survival strategy turned habit.
Whatever Rogers might've meant by those words – and Tony still has no way to tell, although he does have suspicions – maybe it's something that they have in common, that they share. Tony doesn't dare hope, but sometimes he catches the man looking, movement of his pencil paused as his eyes linger on Tony. Usually, he will avert his gaze as soon as their eyes meet and return to his work; on a rare occasion, they both remain frozen in place, staring as if it is a challenge, and it takes one of them to crumble and give for the moment to end.
Steve sits there for a few minutes debating what to do, Tony's shape warm against his side. It's not the only sensation he's suddenly acutely aware of: when he wipes at his tired eyes, the back of his hand comes away wet. He doesn't remember crying, but then again, he was so focused on his guilt and Tony's breakdown a meteor could've struck in the backyard and he wouldn't have noticed.
Something he does think about is the diminishing distance between him and Steve's falling body. His quick math is useful most of the time, but now, it just serves to remind him that no matter what he tries, he won't reach Steve in time.
Tony wakes with a headache pounding behind his temples that makes him wish he could drift off to sleep again.
Steve's barely visible, satisfied smile tells him he's been waiting for his resolve to break. What a vicious, evil, cruel man. And he wants to marry that guy. Yeah, Tony's a bit of a masochist, who knew? Everyone he's ever shared a bed with, sure, but that's not the point.
Tony doesn't look at him or react to his presence in any significant way, and so Steve makes himself break the silence.
"Who the fuck do you think you are, that you can–can come into this world and think it's yours to do with as–"
As it is, an ominous wind blows through the sanctum and the changing atmosphere pulls them out onto the street. Tony hands the phone to Bruce and goes to investigate. He and Steve, they've always picked the worst possible times. What’s one more missed chance?
Plus, there was the added not-benefit that every piece of clothing would pinch in the groin area if not tailored to his exact measurements, and witnessing even the ever-impassive Coulson do a double-take at the sheet where Steve had written his numbers down for that exact purpose was a whole other type of embarrassment Steve hadn't thought he had still in him to feel.
“Who are you?” a small voice asks just as he turns around frantically, ready to deal with the suspected intruder in his wake.
When he approaches the kitchen, the feeling of being watched doesn’t vanish; if anything, it grows into something even stronger, like eyes boring into his back. And yet, no matter how many times he checks, he can’t make out what triggered this sudden paranoia. Steve decides to get the sole reason for his coming down here over with and grabs a glass for himself. He fills it with water from the faucet and empties its contents in quick succession, swallowing the cold liquid down greedily.
He makes the mistake of turning his head and looking at the man, and scolds himself for it a moment later because he should habve known better than to think looking in those eyes wouldn't utterly wreck him. They're darker, hardly blue at all and pupils dilated in the dim light. For once, he's not wearing the hat, hair framing his features with an almost otherworldly shimmer.
He stops and exhales an exhausted sigh, as if the prospect alone has already drained him of all his energy. Then, he hums in thought. "Should've just planted something, huh?"
"I'm sorry this happened to you, alright? Parallel universes fucking suck. If there's a way for you to get back, we'll find it. But I can't–I can't have you here. You–"
– but when he actually arrives, it's not with his fist in Tony's face. Instead, he grabs him by both shoulders and draws him impossibly, indecently close, blue eyes flitting over Tony's features for some unbearable seconds that last forever. Tony's gaze involuntarily drops down to the man's lips, like iron being drawn to a magnet. He feels warm breath grazing his skin and desperately tries not to think about how easy it would be to bridge the remaining distance between them.
Naturally, Peter could not help himself. "How would… you be able to arrange this? Handing it all over to me, I mean. Surely it is not that easy?"
When Steve’s glance shifts and he avoids her gaze, she drops her arms, uncertainty and something else much more vulnerable blossoming in her changing features as she eyes him through the dark shadows the moonlight throws in the room.
Bruce soon came to know that the Lord had always loved riding, and he had always loved his horses. The man claimed he'd grown up on horseback, though it stood to reason that he had spent more time in the back of a wheelhouse than on the horse itself.
A wave of nausea is rolling in his gut, but Steve doesn't let it overcome him. With a deep breath, he clenches his teeth and keeps going.
He wore shabby linen clothes under simple leather guards strapped to his arms and legs speckled with dirt and blood, some of which appeared to be his own. A puncture wound in his thigh caused him to limp as he approached, face not even contorting in a way that would betray the pain he must have undoubtedly been in.
He can't explain it. Everything is more primitive here; if you happen to come from back east, it's like going a few decades back in time. For some reason, all is more filthy, too, except for the night sky. The crescent moon seems to glow brighter, and the dark of night is clearer than Tony can remember it ever being in New York.
After everything that’s been done to scar it so irreversibly, it’s still beating. That is no minor feat, even he has to admit. Tony can’t help the tiny smile sneaking onto his lips–just a twitch, but the movement speaks volumes in Steve’s presence, who is so attuned to his every micro-expression it should be scary.
When it's time to leave, Tony is nowhere to be found. Steve scours the entire house, heart racing, blood rushing in his ears, hands shaking and sweat gathering at his temple–and he finds him upstairs, in a smaller bedroom with a great window. He's facing the street and the city beyond, early morning light throwing pale, pastel shadows across his features.
The knight-turned-lord cleared his throat. "I hope he is good to you?" he inquired, voice free of judgement but with an edge to it that suggested consequences would arise for the man in question should the answer be no.
need some time adjusting to is how utterly gaping and open everything feels once Steve's gone. It's as though the man carved out some space inside Tony just for himself and now that its intended occupant is gone, everything that's left is a void.
Upon opening his eyes, Tony catches Steve lick what is presumably a drop of come off his palm. Which is interesting, because Tony is pretty sure he was still covered in his own a while ago, and now he's squeaky clean without either of them having moved for a tissue.
Anthony smiled, the strain in the curve of his lips gone, its existence only evident now that it had disappeared. "I am glad," he stated, audible relief proving his words true.
The knight remembered spotting him at the very front of the crowd that had come to watch Strange use his abilities to save Anthony from certain death, but had not paid any further attention to his rather unobtrusive looks.
–from his parents and Barnes to Thanos and the stones–didn’t happen the way they did just because. None of it was their doing, not really. They were just puppets.
There's a momentary stinging sensation piercing his chest, and it feels not quite unlike that initial surge of energy searing his nerve endings whenever he put the arc reactor back in its casing. Something is holding him down too, restricting his breathing with an unfamiliar weight that is entirely unlike the reactor. And it's--moving?
"Or, if you were feeling quite so bold, you may visit me at a later hour. Might be the high and mighty Lord Stark needs protecting in his bedchambers now as well. Who is to know what could possibly be lurking out there?"
Night time is more troubling. When Tony does fall asleep, it isn't restful for either of them. Same as the weeks prior, Steve's sleep is often disrupted by frantic movements and agonized whimpers uttered thanks to the hellscape that is the man's nightmares.
