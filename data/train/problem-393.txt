Sherlock sighs. “Can you please do something...with that?” He waves an annoyed hand at the deconstructed meal. “It looks like, I don’t know, some kind of botched pizza autopsy. it’s revolting.”
“Implants,” John says, hating the hurtful edge in his voice but unable to stop. “Those aren’t your memories. They’re Mycroft’s cousin’s.”
Sherlock doesn’t speak, but his breathing is shallow and rapid, and the hand on John’s shoulder moves to his hair, unsubtly pushes his head towards towards the prominent bulge in his pyjamas. John obeys the unspoken request gladly, pressing his face into his groin, rubbing first his cheek against the ridge of his stiff cock, and then his mouth, feeling the heat of it even through two layers of clothing. He carefully slides his mouth upwards, finding the head of Sherlock’s stiff cock, trapped in his pants and pressed upward, nearly flat against his pubic bone. He mouths and licks at it through the cloth, greedy and wanting, tasting a hint of bitter salt at the small damp patch of fabric as Sherlock writhes in silent pleasure underneath him.
“Louellen Tereschencko Andrews, to be absolutely precise.” She extends a slim, French-manicured hand. “With a mouthful of a maiden name like that, you can probably see why I happily took my late husband’s surname.”
John had almost choked on his drink at Sherlock’s words. “Really,” he said, aiming for polite interest and missing by a mile.
So he takes his time, slowly pressing into his body, opening him with the utmost care as he takes his cock fully into his mouth at the same time, giving him pleasure to ease him past the initial discomfort, the burn and stretch of using his body in this way for the first time. John lavishes attention on his prick, taking the shaft deeply into his throat, sliding his lips all the way to the base before pulling back, bobbing shallowly, lavishing attention to the sensitive crown for a few moments before taking him in all the way again, letting his glans push against the back of his throat. He takes Sherlock close to the brink; sensing the tensing of his muscles and altered breathing of approaching orgasm as he backs off, stilling his movements for a moment.
Sherlock sleeps through this quiet, heartfelt declaration; in fact, he sleeps soundly through the night, his long limbs wrapped possessively around John’s frame, sleeps deep and peaceful for many quiet hours, until midmorning light flows thick and bright through the bedroom windows.
when we do this. I take that very, very seriously. It was truly thoughtless on my part, and it put you in an unsafe situation.”
“You’re welcome,” Patricia says, with perhaps ten percent less dislike in her tone than earlier, which is far better than Sherlock usually does in these sorts of situations.
“Oh Christ,” he sighs, put upon and slightly overdramatic. “I look like a pensioner who mugged a member of fucking One Direction.”
He’s never been this completely captivated by any other human being. He can’t even fathom the idea of wanting or needing anyone else other than the man in front of him.
They lie still and gasp for breath together as the aftershocks spark and recede, leaving them limp and sweaty and spent. John winces and grumbles a bit when Sherlock pulls out, but huffs out a chuckle when Sherlock tugs his hair gently, tilting his head back for a proper kiss.
“You were made for this,” John murmured hoarsely. “You were absolutely born to suck cock with that mouth. You love it, don’t you? Nothing else matters to you right now, except having your mouth fucked.” Sherlock nodded and moaned around John’s cock, the vibrations sending hot shivers of pleasure up John’s spine. It was so good, dirty and vulgar and unspeakably hot and John knew he wouldn’t last much longer at this rate. He pulled out of Sherlock’s mouth with a wet sliding noise and took a deep, calming breath.
"To the contrary, Detective Figueroa, I have every right. British national John Watson was pursuing a dangerous international criminal under the express directive of the Secret Intelligence Service, and therefore clearly acting under a defined set of international extra-legal protocols which--"
“Green carnations and red roses?” Sherlock shakes his head. “Not the most aesthetically pleasing combination. Bit garish, to be honest.”
“Good,” John murmurs, as his fingers leave Sherlock’s hair, trace across his shoulder, caress his back. He briefly traces the scars that mark him there, then moves down to his flanks, touching and stroking his sweat-sheened skin with both hand, in gesture that can only be described as reverent. “So gorgeous.” He cups Sherlock’s buttocks in his hands, stroking, squeezing, kneading. “Your arse is...God. It’s fucking transcendent. I could spend my life thinking of what I want to do this arse.”
“I don’t know how late I’ll be out. Joe’s being a real git again and….” Mary shrugs, smiles, the lines by her eyes crinkling in a perfect display of cheerful bemusement. “Girl talk,” she says. “Relationship advice. You know.”
“You’re going to get in a state over this, aren’t you.” Sherlock’s voice is deep and scratchy and a touch… not quite annoyed, really, but there’s a definite edge of
“So are you,” he murmurs, and John has to kiss him, to capture those gorgeous reddened lips with his own just one more time before he straightens himself, taking hold of Sherlock’s slick hand.
“I admire the initiative you’ve shown,” says Anthea/Evelyn, “trying to slip in here at the crack of dawn for minimal pushback. Must have had to get up very early indeed. But you see, I never even went to bed, Detective, and I'm here to ensure, as I’ve repeatedly explained to your superiors, that this interview is not happening.”
John’s murmured words are soothing him, cooling balm alongside the pain, pushing Sherlock down deeper into his body, the sensations and feelings and needs of his flesh creating a cocoon around him as his breathing slows and evens.
He tries to rest, he really does. He settles his head back onto the thin hospital pillow and exhales slowly as he closes his eyes.
Johnson, seemingly flummoxed by this unexpected turn of events, does as he is told. He sits down in his desk chair, wide-eyed and breathing heavily.
John’s eyes go soft at that and the’re kissing again, the press of their mouths growing more heated, and Sherlock would absolutely be getting hard again if that was even remotely possible, which it absolutely is not.
“I don’t work here anymore,” he says, carefully neutral, the alcohol burning in his belly. “Give it to Donovan. She’s good.”
“I’m sorry, John,” Sherlock says quietly. “I truly am, but you saw tonight what she is capable of, and you are an unconvincing liar. If you had known for certain and she found out, she would have easily killed you without a moment’s hesitation. It was a huge risk involving you at all.” He looks down at the ground. “I
“Hey,” John finally says, kinder, softer. He slides his fingers down Sherlock’s arm, takes his hand, long fingers warm and dry in his own. “Look. I know you’re scared.”
sorry for not being completely forthcoming, but I will never apologize for trying  to keep you safe.”
John’s smile is replaced by a look of worry, of fear. He crosses the garden, kneels down next to Sherlock. “I’m here, love. Don’t try to talk.”
Any other time John would berate Sherlock at length for smoking in the flat, but right now he is profoundly grateful for anything, even tobacco, that will bring Sherlock a moment of comfort. In fact, John’s fairly certain he could use one himself.
Sherlock doesn’t need time to think. “No. I don’t want you to feel badly, I truly don’t, but I don’t want to give this up.”
“You’re everything to me,” John rasps in between rough, demanding kisses. “You’re my whole world. You’re my life.” He feels tears gathering in his eyes, threatening to spill down his cheeks; this crashing wave of emotion is terrifying, obliterating, and John wants to run but there’s nowhere left to go, nowhere left to hide so he accepts it, lets it wash over him, fill his lungs, drag him under without a struggle. “I love you,” he breathes, the words harsh and broken, almost a sob. ”Fuck, Sherlock. I love you so much.”
Many thanks to the patient and thorough Mycapeisplaid, who shirked her family gift-wrapping duties to sneak off and beta this chapter instead. <3
“I’m not scared,” Sherlock says reflexively, not even really trying to make it sound believable. “I just don’t want us slowed down by you having a health setback, or --”
The woman’s face shifts into a picture of caring concern. “Oh dear. The Versed sometimes does that. Do you think you can you sit up?”
(Two days ago, the live broadcasts had been replaced by a creepy robotic voice reciting long strings of alphanumeric code. Sherlock had written them down for an entire hour, covering both sides of a notebook page. He has theories. He’s looking forward to discussing them with his brother when the lazy git finally calls.)
(Waiting, ah, waiting is torture. But Sherlock suddenly realises that, counterintuitively, it’s a rather wonderful  kind of torture.)
“In fact,” Sherlock continues, “I believe you need to get me out of these wet clothes and into a warm bed. Immediately.”
She has a nappy bag slung over her right shoulder, and is holding an infant car seat by the handle in her left hand. She moves into the kitchen, sets the bag down on top of the center island and the carrier on the floor alongside.
Far from it, in fact. John is a doctor, after all, and a good one, and has seen far more in his life travels than Sherlock tends to give him credit for, experienced things that have honed his instincts to a razor sharpness.
“It certainly feels off. Possibly they recognized him from the papers?” Lestrade wonders aloud. “Whatever happened, it makes finding Sherlock all the more urgent. But now we have some good leads to go on. Somewhere between the location where Sherlock’s phone was found and the building where Travis McGinty died is where these men are being taken. If we can get that van on CCTV, we can narrow it down even more.”
you do for your own mental health, and I cannot stop you, but it doesn’t change the truth of what you’ve been through.”
“I don’t give a single damn about your business or your money,” Sherlock states flatly. “All I want is Maria.”
“Your class insecurity is showing, John,” Sherlock remarks, sounding very much the posh, condescending git he’s so very capable of being. John has a sudden, very real impulse to punch him in his patrician nose, but he’s got no desire to tangle with the US legal system at this juncture, so he settles for glaring at the back of his obnoxious neck as they go through the checkout lane and pay for the items.
They are the best Johnlock author friends (or any kind of friends, full stop) a girl could ask for, always endlessly patient and generous with their time, support and good advice.
“Well, then.” Mrs. Hudson draws herself up to her full five foot three of pure focused disdain and gives John a look that unmistakably says, Not bloody likely. She places a package of Chocolate HobNobs on the countertop as she shifts her gaze to Sherlock, her face softening into motherly concern.
In a moment John will remember for his entire life, he sits in the passenger seat, car door open for fresh air -- it’s going to be a warm day --  and feeds his daughter for the first time. Her dark blue eyes gaze intently at him as she gulps hungrily.
“John, I want to help,” Sherlock finally says softly. “More than anything. But you need to tell me what you’re thinking.”
The brushstrokes resolve into a painting, and suddenly John sees it, crystal clear and horrifyingly obvious.
“No, that’s wonderful,”John says with sincerity. “Thanks.” He picks up the paracetamol and pops them in his mouth, takes the glass of water to chase them down, then sets the half-full glass back on the night table. Sherlock crosses to the window and closes the heavy blackout blinds, sinking the room into shadowy dimness.
John does as Sherlock asks, stepping back so he can look at all of Travis McGinty. Frail. Malnourished. Skin colour the unmistakable waxy grey of death--
“The baby. Her name is Lily?” John quirks an eyebrow, gestures at the plant with a tilt of his head. “Bit on the nose, that.”
“Oh, Good Lord,” Sherlock murmurs, both needy and irritated, a uniquely fascinating combination John’s not heard but before but somehow knows he will again, and often. “I’ve never been so certain of anything in my entire life. I’ve been driven to distraction by wanting you for
“Absolutely. You would not believe what some people would do to get some, ah, quality time with a beautiful woman such as yourself.”
of lots of things, regarding you and me.” The slightest bit of lewd emphasis on the word leaves no doubt as to the kinds of thoughts he is referencing. “But this? No, not ever.”
Sherlock rises from his chair, not letting go of John’s hand as he helps him up, and John allows it.
The two sit for several minutes in damp silence, each man processing his own thoughts. John listens to the buzz and thump of power tools being brought to bear on the door situation.
Sherlock sighs. “Just the kind of thing that she loves to coo over. She’ll be planning the flower arrangements for months.”
John huffs out a shaky laugh, still gripping the sleeve of Sherlock’s coat. “You’re right. I overstepped there. That’s your area.”
“Where are the Budapest papers?” snarls the stocky, unwashed thug for the twentieth or thirtieth time in the past hour.
He wraps his arms around Sherlock’s slender waist; they hold each other tightly for a long time, entwined in each other, swaying almost imperceptibly as John weeps, silently, against Sherlock’s warm soft skin.
As he looks at her tiny hand holding on so tightly, John feels something in him come to life, a tiny bubbling spring of joy welling up from somewhere deep inside. Clear cool water moistens parched earth, creates an oasis where something new and good will grow.
. That skin job you VK’d at the Holmes Corporation, Sherlock? He disappeared. Ditched his tracking implant and ran. Didn’t even know he was a replicant, Holmes said. Imagine that.”
John doesn’t know if the camera is live or a decoy but decides to err on the side of caution, slipping away quickly and quietly into the shadows along the far side of the chainlink fence, scaling it--well, not
“Dammit, Sherlock,” John says with a sigh. He knows Sherlock was trying to do what’s best, keep him from harm. What’s done is done.
Sherlock obeys, raising himself up on one elbow, allowing John to bring the bottle of water to his lips. He drinks and drinks, then takes the bottle from John's hand and drinks some more. He’d had no idea how dehydrated he’d become.
“Yeah. I couldn’t pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like it here. Everything used up, falling apart before it’s time.” She chuckles a bit sadly. “Like me, I guess.”
“I left him at the Wawa off Route 33, if you can believe it. I didn’t, like, plan it. He went in to use the restroom and get some money out and I just. I knew this couldn’t continue. So. I got behind the wheel and drove off and I just…” Her hands flutter upwards, gesturing at nothing. “I just left him there.”
The inner walls and shelves have been cleared of grime and gore. A faint smell of Dettol still lingers.
Understanding Sherlock’s actions that day brings a whole other flavour of regret into the mix, but he’s truly not angry any longer. It’s come at a terrible cost, but John is grateful for that one small relief.
“Take care, Patricia.” John turns and leaves, tucking both drinks into the crook of his left arm to open the door with his right, feeling like a lout, grateful to leave the entire dishonest conversation behind him. He goes to the SUV, heading for the drivers’ side. Sherlock rolls down the window.
At first he fights them, a lifetime of reflexive conditioning asserting itself, but then he reconsiders.
“I really need to pick up your medication,” Sherlock says, changing the subject. “I don’t want to leave you alone, but we need to keep your antibiotics on schedule, and pain control works best if you don’t let it wear completely off.”
Sherlock turns on his side, away from John, and pointedly says nothing. John sighs and sits on the edge of the bed.
Sherlock snorts.“My father left his cardigan in the back of a cab. I’m sure Mycroft has the entirety of MI-5 combing the city of London for it.” He gracefully but not very subtly slides closer to John, crowds him against the side of the cosy, high-backed banquette and leans in close. “They won’t be here for ages…”
“Yes,” agrees Sherlock, and plucks the torch out of John’s nerveless palm before taking him by the hand. John clings to the comforting sensation, to Sherlock’s strong fingers weaving in between his own as he guides John down the steps and out of that awful, rotting, dying house.
Of course, saying that out loud would ruin the entire crystalline revelation of having an utterly perfect ordinary shag with his utterly perfect ordinary spouse, so he doesn’t.
,” Sherlock groans, but lets John wipe down his chest and between his legs, checking carefully for any blood or signs of damage and finding none. He tosses the flannel over the side of the bed and curls up behind Sherlock’s boneless, sweaty body. Sherlock turns his head back towards him in silent request; John obliges him with a kiss.
Of course Sherlock knew. Sherlock knew because he had been reading, learning, getting ready for the birth of John’s child.
“A more verbose manner of saying the ends justify the means,” Sherlock replies. “I have heard that refrain so many times, in so many different ways. Dressing it up in justifications never makes it true.”
John held a hand out to him and Sherlock took it  without hesitation, rising and turning to walk quietly into the bathroom. When John heard Sherlock turning on the taps to brush his teeth, he moved through the flat quickly, mapping a game plan, putting out supplies. Defenses stripped, emotions laid bare, subspace made Sherlock intensely vulnerable and needy; once the scenario began to unfold, John would not able to be leave him alone for even a moment.
“Take your time,” John calls out. “Well, not too long. And no undressing without me.” He ducks into the kitchen, fills the kettle. “I’m making a cuppa. Want one?”
A short while later, Sherlock is curled into a tight ball under the sheets, trying and failing to recapture elusive slumber when John speaks again, low and gentle.
John hears distant thumps and muffled voices in the distance. The police have finally arrived. Sherlock ignores the noises, focusing the white-hot beam of his attention solely on Lee.
After the show ends and the house lights come back up, John makes his way backstage, snatching up a discarded racing form on his way across the club. He hovers in an alcove, pretends to study the folded sheet as outrageously-attired chattering showgirls pass him by without a second glance
Sherlock’s hips thrust off the bed in stuttering, uncontrolled movements as he gasps and cries out; John raises his head, decides to take a chance before Sherlock’s flailing inadvertently whacks him in the side of his face with a lethally sharp iliac crest. He places his hands gently on the sharp ridge of hips, steadying him, fingers bracketing his lower flanks and thumbs pressing just slightly into the hollows on the inner aspect of his pelvic bone.
“I just want some horrible fried crap slathered in cheese. What could be more American than that? When in Rome, et cetera.”
Sherlock wonders briefly, then John slaps him again, a brilliant starburst of pain, making his eyes water. “No playacting at this.” He grabs Sherlock’s face and kisses him, hot and demanding, tongue invading his mouth for a brief moment before pulling away.
“You vile sodding worthless fucking bastard.” John lands a blow to the side of his head, just above his ear. “How
“No, no, no,” Sherlock sobs, a helpless, unguarded wail, a desperate entreaty directed at no one, at everyone, at the entirety of creation.
He rises late, feeling more rested than he can remember being in a while. Outside it’s the first truly pleasant day of early spring, the sky bright blue and the breeze warm. He showers, dresses, and takes a long, meandering walk. He allows his feet to take him wherever they wish until his arches are aching and half-numb, and after he sits on a park bench with a paper cup of tea, staring at nothing at all in particular.
“If I knew certain specific landmarks, type of house, location on the street, how hard would it be to triangulate that information into a productive search?”
Will he someday feel nostalgia, John suddenly wonders, for this long, strange, mostly horrible (but also, in parts, wonderful) journey? He decides he may, some day in the far off future, but he’s certainly nowhere near there yet. He shakes his head, files that entire train of thought away for consideration at a much, much later date.
“We are,” John agrees, and something in him really hears, really registers the truth in those three simple words.
Mycroft’s people have already come and gone. The baby’s room is empty, nothing left to indicate its former intention except the border of fat yellow ducklings, waddling in an endless parade around the perimeter of the room.
“No, it is,” John insists, refuting a point Sherlock hadn’t made aloud. “It is. It will be.” John takes a deep breath. “It’s like a part in a play, right? It’s just a role.”
Despite a year filled with bad life choices, John feels certain that tonight is still a standout moment in his long history of terrible decisions.
“He escaped prosecution, though just barely,” Greg reads from the laptop screen. “Her family stopped cooperating with the authorities, possibly in exchange for Lee relinquishing a claim to her estate. He was stripped of his medical license, though.” Greg scrolls down the page. “After that he dropped off the map. No information on his whereabouts from late 2011 until twelve weeks ago, when he obtained--” he picks up and brandishes the sheet of paper-- ”this. A business license for a commercial linen service.”
“That’s fine,” John replies mildly, stroking Sherlock’s hair, reveling in being allowed this simple, longed-for intimacy, gently twining springy curls between his fingers. “I like the way my name sounds in your mouth. That’s enough for me.”
“All right,” Sherlock says after a quiet moment, though his eyes are skeptical, his mouth pressed into a tight, downturned line.
“No lumps, bumps, weird smells or bedbugs,” John agrees. “Thank God for the British Government and God save the Queen.”
“Hopefully the cold will be taken into account by all I meet,” Sherlock says dryly, and it takes John a moment to catch up before he gets the joke, grinning broadly up at him in amusement  and relief and unguarded fondness. Sherlock’s lips twitch in the barest hint of a smile in response. He opens his mouth to utter another snarky rejoinder, but something on the other side of the room catches his attention and the smile on his face dies instantly.
The silence between the two men descends again, thick and oppressive, heavy with regret and doubt and terrible sadness.
, and the shivery pleasure in him begins to spiral, to build, and it’s been so long, too long since they’ve been together like this, naked and touching and --
The battered, creased photo shows two smiling little boys in swimming trunks, sitting on a flat grey rock on the edge of a rippling river.
Sherlock pulls his mouth off with a lewd slurp and immediately wraps his hand around John’s wet cock, stroking him fast and hard as he slips his otherhand between his legs, pressing against his sore, wet entrance. John gasps as two of his fingers slip inside, the pressure and stinging pain of it registering as a fierce, razor-sharp burst of perfect, filthy pleasure as fingertips brush across his prostate.
Sherlock sighs a bit as he closes his eyes, slides his hands across John’s back. He tilts his head to the side, encouraging John to continue his ministrations. “I’m thinking upright...  is perhaps not optimal...
The phone in his hand makes it more difficult to shut down the nagging impulse to send Sherlock a barrage of needy and neurotic texts demanding his immediate return, so John shoves it under his pillow, out of his sight but not too far away.
, compared to what they could have inflicted upon him had they so desired. Surely you’re so naive as to be willfully blind to that reality.”
“Give me that,” John snaps. Sherlock rolls his eyes but hands it over. John tears the paper in half, then half again, then grinds the tiny scraps under the heel of his work boot for good measure, mashing them into the wet pavement until the paper dissolves into pulpy shreds.
There are cigarettes in the toe of the Persian slipper. Sherlock shakes one out, takes it into the kitchen, lights it off the hob.
“Like selling babies,” John concurs, hating the way the words feel in his mouth. He takes another swallow of Gatorade to wash it away.
"Just great," John replies, adrenaline still coursing through his veins. He feels calm, almost cheerful. "Kidnapper was a lovely chap. We got on quite well. May go out for a pint later."
Music drifts up the steps, just at the threshold of hearing--some modern, dreadful easy listening pop, one of the Idol blokes or somesuch.
Katie bends down, retrieves the baby’s dummy where it dropped amongst the blankets, shushing her gently as she returns it to her tiny pink mouth.
In what will become a lifelong habit, Sherlock brings his thumb and finger up and caresses the smooth round stone that lay over his heart.
John slots his mobile into the player on the sitting room table. A song begins to play, something warm and inviting, lush horns and velvet backbeat. John turns to Sherlock, and even though his face is creased with sorrow his eyes are bright and warm.
John’s already reaching for the lube, pouring a slightly overgenerous handful to slick himself. Sherlock shifts, spreading his knees a bit wider. John reaches around Sherlock’s thigh, taking himself in hand, positioning himself at his wet, loosened entrance.
John misses London with a fierce homesickness, of course he does, but he’s developed a bit of an odd fondness for Philadelphia, and if there were one thing he would take back home with him it would be Wawa, with its fresh sandwiches and cheap, surprisingly good self-serve coffee. He pours two large cups for himself and Sherlock, adds cream to one and a revolting amount of sugar to the other, and fits them carefully into the paperboard holder. After a moment of thought, he turns to the doughnut case and selects two oversized pastries-- a chocolate eclair and a banana nut muffin-- before heading to the register.
“There hasn’t really been a good moment up until now,” Sherlock says by way of explanation. John gives him a querying look; Sherlock offers him the envelope.
“Excellent,” Sherlock says with a small, fond smile, then tugs at the hem of John’s shirt. “Take this off. I want to see you.”
One more day gone, and one more brick in the wall that’s been growing between them over the past eighteen months.
There are several foam takeout containers stacked on the small dining table, with a six-pack of Yuengling lager sitting alongside. Sherlock is already seated at the table, opened takeaway box of potato skins at his elbow, chewing absently as he pores over a stack of photocopied documents John doesn’t recognise.
John collects his thoughts, decides the best thing to do is to cut this entire conversation off before Sherlock gets himself any more tied up in emotional knots.
“So we have time. For once in I can’t remember how long, we have time.” He runs his hands up Sherlock’s back and across his shoulders, savouring the lean, hard feel of him under the thin material of his worn tee shirt. “Let’s just see how it goes. No expectations, no pressure. Just…” John drops his voice to a husky, seductive purr. “Tell me what you want. Right now. What do you want, love?”
“Don’t answer to him anymore.” John picks up the cup, drinks. The tea is weak and astringent, but caffeinated and blessedly hot.
“And your blog,” Atherton answers. “I am a bit acquainted with your detective, as well. Not personally, but more than a few gentlemen who pass through our doors have had dealings with Mr Holmes.” He leans forward, tilts his head conspiratorily. “Your friend has kept a considerable number of homeless individuals from starving or freezing to death, you know. Helped more than a few find placement in drug treatment programs as well.”
“Things could be different, this time,” John points out. “The last Moriarty... Sherlock, he was obsessed with you. Personally. Basically, he wanted to be your psychopath boyfriend. The new one, the new Moriarty, he may have the same name, but whoever he is, this Moriarty is a different man. He wants different things. Maybe he won’t come after you.”
“Why are you even bringing this up?” John asks, then in the next moment shakes his head and gives a soft groan. “You dickhead. You deliberately brought this up right before your parents arrived, didn’t you? So I would think about... that... all through dinner.”
John sags heavily into the nearest chair and rubs his eyes, sudden exhaustion flooding every cell of his body.
“For…” Sherlock shrugs, shakes his head at his own incoherent sentimentality. “I don’t know. For being here, I suppose.”
“So help me, Sherlock, I’ll do it.” John sighs, takes a sip of his coffee, tries another tack. “Honestly, you’re about to collapse from starvation. I know you…” he drops his voice lower. “I know it’s hard to eat right now. But you need fuel. Please, Sherlock.”
Sherlock curves forward to kiss him once, hard, before leaning back and placing his hands behind himself on John’s knees, indulging his exhibitionistic streak by wantonly displaying himself for John’s pleasure. The shift in angle makes John’s cock push harder against his prostate, making him moan louder than maybe is strictly polite for this time of day.
“I love denying you,” John rasps softly, “but I also hate it, because then I have to deny myself the very best part...” He pulls his fingers out of Sherlock ‘s mouth, pushes his wet hand into the cleft of his arse, smearing wetness there. “After I beat you properly, after I’ve taken you apart and made you scream, the best part is when you’re shaking and exhausted and hurting and I get to fuck you like that. That’s my favourite thing in the whole goddamn world.” He slips a wet finger easily into Sherlock’s hole, making him arch and gasp at the breach. “This hot little hole, just aching to be fucked. It belongs to me. Say it.”
? You and your weirdo boyfriend playing house with a baby. Oh, John. That’s just. Good God.” She shakes her head. “She was a mistake, an accident. You have to see that. We gave her life, but it was never meant to be. People like us aren’t meant for that kind of thing.”
“If there’s nothing else,” Anthea/Evelyn replies coolly. It’s not a question. “Have a lovely day, Detective.”
Dressed in a rumpled tan cardigan over a dark blue buttondown and brown corduroy trousers, the pale, blue-eyed man looks stressed, overwhelmed and more than a little exhausted. His bristly blonde hair is clumped into spikes, the bags under his eyes deep enough to pack for a week’s holiday. As John closes the door of the private meeting room, David’s eyes go wide and wary. He looks a bit like a cornered hedgehog preparing to fight to the death.
The only thing that could be worse than being here with Sherlock, though, would be not being here with Sherlock, being left behind again. That implications of thought snaps John out of his little wallow instantaneously; his righteous indignation fizzles away into embarrassment, and he feels like a right arsehole.
“Just like that,” John murmurs. “So good for me, my sweet pet. You’ll give me anything I want, won’t you?”
“I tried,” John says, feeling a little defensive. “Honestly, I did. I’ve just been laid up too long. I don’t think I can stand these walls for one second longer.” He shakes his head, breathes out his nose. “I’m going mad just lying here. I know you’re a bit concerned --”
Later, Sherlock will grudgingly concede that he missed a large part of what John was trying to convey in this moment. But right now, Sherlock is hurt and confused. He had been expecting praise and admiration from John, and instead--
John hesitates for a moment, feeling almost afraid, as if speaking the man’s name out loud will summon him, conjure him into reality like a malevolent Djinn.
“I know your posture says military, while your haircut, or rather your need of one, says it’s been a few years. The injury you suffered indicates you saw action, but you’re under one hundred seventy centimeters, which is the minimum height for Off-World volunteer military. You could leave Earth despite your injury, you have family Off-World--likely Proxima or Centauri Prime--but you refuse to go to them for help, maybe because of residual guilt over your profession. Not an ordinary policeman then, something more morally compromised. You’re here on the investigation into the four rogue Nexus 6 models that made it to Earth. So, you’re a blade runner. Which makes it likely a significant portion of your military experience involves putting down replicant uprisings. So: either Chicago or Los Angeles.”
John scans for a moment, taps the keyboard, selects a folder labelled S_HOLMES, MEMORY IMPLANT MATRIX, 101-151 INCL.
Granted permission, Sherlock gives in to his insatiable curiosity and swipes a finger through John’s semen, investigating it for colour, texture and, finally, taste.
Sherlock stands as well. His eyes leave John’s face, but his body language remains open. “Graham,” he calls over his shoulder. "Are John and I done here?”
The twin pleasures of John’s cock and hand both working him in tandem is spiraling ever higher, his bollocks drawing up close to his body. He’s approaching the point of no return, he not going to last much longer and he doesn’t want to, this isn’t about drawing it out, it’s about taking his pleasure, indulging himself, allowing himself to --
The next morning John is reading the G2 supplement, vaguely considering looking for a pencil and attempting the crossword, when Sherlock comes into the kitchen. He’s crisp and fresh, perfectly coiffed and dressed, looking none the worse for wear after staying up most of the night yet again.
,” the bouncer politely, and from the way Sonia looks up at the man and smiles, with warmth that lights up her brown eyes, John knows with absolute certainty the two of them are either already surreptitiously sleeping together, or will be very, very soon.
“We’re just so bloody ridiculous,” John says, and if that’s not the whole entire truth of what he’s feeling, well, it’s certainly a big part of it. “Trying to have, you know, a moment, with the firelight and the emotions, and then there’s a cramp and getting lube and being thirsty and--”
“So this...man.” That’s not the noun John really wants to use. “Alex Johnson. He’s involved in the current whereabouts of my daughter.”
The steady beep of the monitors does not change. His desperate attempt at communication raises not a blip from the equipment attached to his body, and the world-renowned consulting detective for once fails to notices something of import, distracted by heated conversation at hand.
“I wouldn’t... I don’t. Well, not with her. Definitely not with her,” Sherlock said, and John had wanted to know more, to clarify what that meant--but he was thoroughly embarrassed and flustered and dropped the matter instead.
He doesn’t think he sleeps, but he must have done, because next thing he knows he’s opening his eyes to morning sunlight and a short-haired, momentarily unrecognizable Sherlock putting the kettle on to boil.
“That’s my mom’s car,” the man protests. “She’s overseas. Visiting relatives. She’ll kill me if she comes home and I’ve--”
“That’s it,” John rasps, low and ragged. “That’s it, that’s perfect, oh Jesus --” He’s babbling, heedless of the words spilling out of his mouth as he loses himself in need and instinct. “Look at you, riding my cock like a perfect whore. You’re so good, you’re so good, so tight and hot and perfect for me.” He brings his hand up to Sherlock’s chest, tugs hard on the chain connecting his nipples; the clamps tighten painfully, biting hard into the bruised and swollen flesh, making Sherlock keen high and sharp at the sharp bite, the sensation something completely beyond pain now, blending seamlessly into incandescent pleasure as he pistons himself up and down, fucking himself steadily on John’s lovely, demanding cock.
“Stay here.” Sherlock repeats over his shoulder as he leaves the bedroom. John doesn’t love being ordered around in this manner, but he obeys, mostly due to his jeans still being only partway on.
Sherlock drops his eyes, bends to carefully untie the laces on his shoes, toes them off, takes them into the open wardrobe before returning to the centre of the room, standing first on one large slim foot then another as he removes his socks. He slips out of his slim two-button jacket, turning to drape it carefully on a padded hanger and return it to the wardrobe. He pulls his shirt tails out of his trousers, undoes his cuffs, slips each button free slowly but without self-consciousness or artifice. He’s not stripping or putting on a show, he is simply doing exactly what John tells him to do the way he does everything else in his life-- to the absolute best of his ability.
John nods frantically around his mouthful of hard flesh; Sherlock makes a sharp, bitten off cry and he’s coming, hips lifting off the bed, filling John’s mouth with pulse after pulse of thick hot fluid. John swallows every drop eagerly, greedily, gentling and slowing his movements as the aftershocks shiver through Sherlock’s body. He releases his spent cock, kisses the inside of his thigh, rubs gentle circles into the skin of his flat belly as Sherlock’s ragged breathing calms.
It’s clearly not intended for him. It’s a bit odd, to be sure, they’re usually more careful about this sort of thing, but --
Two mornings later, John wakes early to find Sherlock’s side of the bed empty and cool and the flat silent.
"You should not presume to tell me what I should and should not do," Sherlock says, voice flat and cold. "Ever. Again."
“Indeed it is. Consulting paranormal expert. I’ll need an assistant, of course. If you’re interested.”
“I’d encourage his interest in leptidoptery, but I would explain the environmental devastation of World War Terminus and the need to protect and conserve the last few living creatures of Earth.” He taps the ash of his cigarette. “Then I’d show him how to build a brilliant artificial butterfly.”
John comes back to reality, catching himself moonily gazing into the bathroom mirror with unfocused eyes, and he shakes himself out of his wandering thoughts, giving an eye roll and a bit of a laugh at his own foolishness.
Greg is pulling the laptop towards himself when Wiggins’ laconic drawl cuts in. “Christi Monroe. The pop star. He’s ‘er husband. Well, widower now, I suppose.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer with words, instead pressing his face into the crook of John’s shoulder in wordless gratitude for John’s forgiveness. They lie together like that for a quiet minute. Sherlock strokes the back of John’s hand with his thumb.
“I know,” John says in a soft near-whisper, even though it’s not quite true, he didn’t know, until this moment he hadn’t fully recognised what Sherlock had gone through, pushing away the terror and panic through sheer force of will in order to do what needed to be done, in order to find the cold clarity needed to walk into that building prepared to deal death to anyone who came into his path--and it was all just for John. To reach him. To save him, if it had come to that.
As he watches the flashing blue and red lights move down the street, John knows now he won’t be leaving here through the front entrance.
He makes his way carefully across the street--the damp, chilly rain is making his leg feel especially foul tonight--and slides gingerly into a vacant seat, leaning his cane against the leg of the stool.
“Oh god, stop it,” he says aloud to the empty room. “For fuck’s sake stop it, that kind of thinking doesn’t help anybody.”
“Stop bluffing,” Sherlock says with a dismissive wave of his hand. “No one in this room wants the authorities involved, let’s not pretend otherwise.”
Sherlock’s head snaps up at the word ‘partner,’ his pale eyes locking with John’s for a moment. John can’t help but smile at this impossible, brilliant man wrapped in a sheet and a shock blanket, and Sherlock responds with a smile of his own, genuine and full of promise.
“That got a little more, um, athletic than I was intending,” Sherlock says. “You’re quite sure you’re feeling all right?”
(The fact that Mycroft himself agreed wholeheartedly with this assessment is what keeps John’s conscience from eating him alive.)
He rouses once in a semi-panic, sweaty and disoriented, from another confusing dream he can't quite remember. The slanting sunlight tells him mid-afternoon. Harriet --
Sherlock strokes him slowly, a bit clumsily but with infinite care and tenderness as he nibbles and kisses the thin, delicate skin of his inner thighs.
After many long minutes John stills, pulls out of him completely, making him whine a bit at the feeling of emptiness.“I want to see you,” he murmurs, kissing his damp curls. Sherlock rolls to his side and dazedly watches John shuck the rest of clothing and arrange pillows against the headboard, fumble with the bottle of lube, messily re-slick his cock.
His life right now is an ongoing clusterfuck, and he finds himself unable to either back out or find a clear path forward.
“But I didn’t...I never thought...” Sherlock presses his lips together tightly for a moment. “When I understood what he intended, I wasn’t afraid at first. I was...incredulous. Angry. Outraged. Who was this person and what made him think he had some kind of right to...”
“Yes,” John gasps. “Oh god. Look at you. So desperate for it.” Sherlock’s jaw is aching and his throat burning by the time John stills, gasping, and pushes at Sherlock’s shoulders, bringing his head up and off his cock. “Understand something,” he hisses, wrapping his hand around his own shaft and stroking hard. “You’re my whore and no one else’s. Not ever.”
"Yes, sir," the assistant squeaks, but Sherlock has already moved on. “Come along, John. I’d like to get to Twickenham while the light is still good.”
“I just…” Sherlock trails off, sighs a bit, tries again. “This is wonderful. It is. But there isn’t...there’s still...It’s just that one orgasm doesn’t make everything magically better, you realise.”
, and not just when we’re like this. Out there in the world, when you puff yourself up and solve crimes and play at being a proud, arrogant peacock?
“I am very physically attracted to you. I am, I can’t lie about that. I very much would like to be physical with you, to share that with you, and I would be sad if we don't get to have that. But you need to know, Sherlock, I loved you with all my heart when I thought we would never be more than best friends. I was always willing to spend my life with you, eager in fact, for reasons that have nothing to do with sex or physical intimacy. So yes. I would stay here with you, forever.”
Lestrade gives John a pointed look, opens his mouth as if he’s about to say something, then closes it with a shake of his head. “Fine,” he mutters. “No difference to me, if it gets ‘em caught.” He turns away, flips up his collar, and steps into the street. John glances at Sherlock; Sherlock shrugs, just a hitch of one shoulder. John nods, and the two men follow Lestrade across the street.
Honestly, John would rather collect trolleys in an Asda car park than set foot in that clinic ever again.
“None necessary.” Sherlock swipes at his torso with the flannel, looks up at John with a smirk. “It’s fair to say I don’t mind at all.” He tosses the cloth carelessly toward the couch as John lowers himself carefully back down to the floor.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes, thrusting himself sleepily against the circle of John’s fist. John keeps the pace sweet and unhurried, drawing out the lazy pleasure of it, gazing down to watch their bodies move together, hushed and intimate in the sleepy morning light.
“Zip ties?” Sherlock asks the bleeding man on the floor in mocking incredulity. “What kind of amateur hour are you people running here? With the right technique, anyone at all can snap a zip tie.” He looks down carefully into the man’s face, and understanding fills his pale eyes. “Ah. He’s paying you in drugs, isn’t he? I see. That explains so very much.”
And always, hovering at the dark edge of his consciousness, is the desperate and useless worry for her well-being, that ugly ice-cold fear he can’t focus on for more than a fleeting moment or he’ll go absolutely howling mad and be of no use to anyone at all.
Sherlock nods, his head sagging downwards, nostrils flaring. John slides a hand into damp curls, pulls his head up by his hair. He gazes intently at Sherlock’s face, wet and wide-eyed, cheeks flushed deep with arousal behind the constraint of leather straps. His eyes are glassy and dilated, pupils black and blown wide. Tears run unchecked down his face, mingling with the wet drool bubbling over his chin and jaw.
He had, at some point, acquired the unshakable belief that a man like him could never be truly happy, that contentment and peace were something that happened to other people, to better, kinder, more deserving people.
He considers how he’d always told himself he was the more emotionally adept of the two, and he’s starting to wonder now if that hadn’t been an ego-protecting lie from the very start.
“No,” Sherlock rasps, harsh and desperate as he shakes his head. “I know what you’re really asking me for, John, you’re asking me if it’s okay to die, you’re asking me for permission, and no.”
He remembers making a decision, as Sherlock lay in hospital fighting for every breath. Pushing past a shocked assistant to drop a silver USB stick on Mycroft Holmes’ desk.
“Oh, oh, oh.” John rasps as the wave recedes, the aftershocks sparking and fading; too boneless to stay upright, he collapses onto his side next to Sherlock. “Oh
He and John fight more than occasionally, yelling and stomping and hurling of insults, and Sherlock never minds. Sometimes he even enjoys a good fight. He yells, John yells, everyone waves their ridiculous anger around for awhile and then it’s over and everyone feels better. It’s cleansing, cathartic. Usually the sex after is fairly spectacular as well.
But his parents remain, even as Mrs Hudson, as ever more in tune with Sherlock’s emotional needs than his own biological relations, picked up plates and tidied around them and dropped various hints that sailed over their oblivious heads. Sherlock finds he just...doesn’t have the heart to bluntly kick them out, as he would have done without compunction only a few short years ago.
John finds himself momentarily wishing Sherlock hadn’t left his side, but reconsiders as soon as Glenn lowers him carefully to the toilet. This is incredibly humiliating, and John summarily decides he’s had tolerated enough weakness and pride-demolishing vulnerability in the past few days to last him several lifetimes.
But the more John considers the more he sees that, no matter his other confused and uncertain thoughts, he has zero reservations or doubts about what he and Sherlock have become. They were always meant to be this way, and he knows it is Good, maybe the purest Good he’s ever had in his life. That’s the one single thing he knows for absolute certain, the one north star he trusts will guide them through this tempest and see them safely to shore.
“Is there any chance Patricia is involved in this?” he asks, finding himself hoping it’s not the case.
“No, s’ok.” John yawns and arches a bit, causing his arse to press into Sherlock’s groin. John chuckles, low and rough from sleep. “I guess you’re awake, then,” he murmurs affectionately, reaching back to stroke Sherlock’s impressive erection through his thin pyjama bottoms.
Sherlock looks at him, his hair in messy spiky clumps, pupils wide and dark. He’s unspeakably beautiful in the low, flickering firelight.
It’s a large city, so parts of it are of undeniably beautiful, and other parts of it are...quite rough and tumble, to put it kindly. But either way, the streets feel
”You’re not worth the ASBO,” he spits. “But know that if I ever see your miserable fucking face again, I swear to God I will cave it in.” He pulls out his wallet, throws notes on the table.
Louellen nods. “Of course. And when push comes to shove they deal in the wetwork, same as anyone else. They have a use for Maria, I needed to get her out of town for a bit.”
There is more of this story to tell (obviously), so check back in a bit and see how that's coming along.
“I know,” John says, in an exhale that’s not quite a sigh. “Just not happening today. Suppose I’ve slept too much.”
John thinks, because at this very moment the ceaseless sensory input is making him feel positively homicidal.
“Nice to see you awake, Doctor Watson,” he says, his tone genial yet crisp. “I’m Glenn, and I’m your nurse today. Pleased to meet you.”
“Shut up,” John says, but the tone is concerned and fond, not irritated. “You saw nothing. Anyway, the cavalry's coming, soon as they figure out that door or bust through it, but it’s going to be a few minutes. Come here, please.” He pulls Sherlock down to the floor and sits next to him, wrapping his arms around his shivering, bony frame.
“Occasionally,” Sherlock replies. “Not that often, in the past, but sometimes…” He’s the one embarrassed now, his cheeks colouring a lovely shade of bright pink. “At times... when you and I are, well, spending a lot of time together in close quarters, it may be... more than occasional.”
And it had been, for everyone, a thoroughly happy day. Lily is a happy child, an easygoing, blessedly sunny creature that brings joy to everyone in her orbit, especially Sherlock’s parents, her toothless smiles and delighted laughter a balm to their profound and sharp-edged grief in the wake of Mycroft’s death.
John shoves two fingers in his mouth. “Get them nice and wet,” he growls, “Because that’s all you’re getting.” Sherlock sucks desperately at his fingers, lips and chin growing wet with saliva, until John pulls them away suddenly and pushes them hard into Sherlock’s unprepared arse.
He wants, full stop. Endlessly, helplessly. When it comes to John, he always, always wants. And he’s willing to perform, to please, to do whatever it takes to get what he wants.
If there was anything else going on, Sherlock would have never even bothered to answer Greg’s texts, not even to say “Piss off.” There wasn’t, though, so he crankily acquiesced, muttering and complaining the whole while.
“Look at you,” John breathes, entranced. “You get off on this so much, don’t you? You’re an absolutely filthy pain slut. You’re a whore for it. You’re amazing.” He traces slow careful fingers down the crest of Sherlock’s hip, down into the crease of his groin, achingly close to his prick but not actually touching it. “This is the real punishment,” he murmurs,”isn’t it? You’re wondering if I’m going to leave you like this, desperate and aching for my cock.”
Harry was the first to leave; her relationship with her sibling is still in the rebuilding stages, tentative and awkward. She hasn’t yet got the hang of dealing with Sherlock without John as a buffer, and she’d bolted when it became obvious her brother was down for the count.
They make it halfway down the empty street before John turns away from Sherlock and vomits without warning, spinach and cheese and stomach acid pouring out of him and splattering on the pavement, the sound loud and violent in the silent predawn darkness.
John looks down at her in slightly shocked bemusement. Her eyes are squeezed tightly shut, her toothless mouth wide open as she howls her indignation at a loud and confusing universe.
Sherlock is unflagging in his enthusiasm, continuing his attentions to his nipples, biting and mouthing before again sucking with obvious enjoyment, as John gasps occasional soft oaths, his hips flexing minutely despite his efforts to stay still, his almost painfully hard cock pressing against Sherlock’s torso.
“I hate what you did to each other,” she continues. “Relationships... they’re a two way street, Sherlock. And the two of you? You both live for all that drama, you know. Sometimes I think you bring out the worst in each other.”
“Jesus, Sherlock, do you not realise--” John realises he’s getting loud, and makes a visible effort to modulate his tone. “Do you not realise that we are in a extremely posh restaurant waiting for your family to arrive for an extremely posh birthday dinner? How could you possibly think this is a good time to discuss--”
Sherlock shakes his head, then drains his drink, sets it on the bedside table and turns to face John, sitting up and leaning forward intently. “John. Listen to me. You did absolutely nothing wrong. You did precisely what I would have done in your position, and I don’t blame you.”
John is still for a moment, then gives a single, curt nod before walking away, leaving Mycroft Holmes to his cavernous shadows and silence.
Sherlock nods. “Mycroft got... in touch with David Foster." His eyebrow lifts a fraction, leaving John to wonder what kind of terrifying midnight kidnapping the innocuous phrase “in touch” might encompass. “The results were expedited.”
“It’s going to be all right,” John murmurs against his warm, slightly cracked lips. “I believe in you, you know.”
Mary laughs, hollow and bitter, the sneer returning to her face. “So you really think you could raise a child? With
John quirks an eyebrow and grins. “But I don’t literally mean here, in this flat. You’re still getting dressed and taking me out for chips, my dear.”
The woman goes silent and wide-eyed as the robber takes the gun away from her head and aims it at Sherlock.
“I’ve had McGinty’s body sent to Bart’s,” he begins. “Molly knows this is top priority, she started the autopsy immediately. I’ve also sent officers to the shelter to interview Rocco Napolitano and Timothy Atherton. Hopefully they’ll--”
John presses his thin lips together so hard they practically disappear. “Half hour. And I want a code that means everything’s okay, no one’s holding a knife to your throat or got you trussed up in the back of a van.”
He straightens his shoulders and does not break eye contact, staring her down, daring her to challenge the truth of his words.
John strokes him firmly but slowly, in rolling counterpoint to the slide and push of his cock. John’s got himself tightly under control, doling out his pleasure one sparking shiver at a time. It’s just on the edge of what he needs to tip over into orgasm, the torment of it unbearable and delicious at the same time, the tension winding tighter and tighter around his spine as John tortures him, bringing him to the very brink again before easing away, denying him release.
It’s terrifying and freeing. It’s the highest he’s ever soared, the closest he’s ever flown to the sun.
-- exhales, hard. She is silent for a moment before she speaks again, lower in volume but her tone harsher, verging almost upon bitter.
. I had moved on. I had deleted it. And then you kissed me, and you touched me, and I wanted you to, good God I wanted you to so much, but...I didn’t know. It’s so naive, so unbelievably clueless of me, but I didn’t know my body had held on to the memories my mind resolved to forget.
“Because I enjoy the other things we do,” Sherlock says. He keeps his voice carefully neutral, even though he knows John can see through to how unnerved this quiet, honest conversation is making him, how exposed he feels without flippant, flirtatious bravado to hide behind.
“I know you’re not feeling yourself, but I need to tell you something very important, and it can’t wait. Are you listening?”
John frowns. “Who on earth would send me a get-well plant with a pink ribbon, someone else’s name, and a fake address?”
He knows later he will keenly feel loss, and regret, but right now his heart is a stone, holding no warmth or tenderness whatsoever for her. He had loved Mary Watson, once, but she is long since gone. This woman in front of him is a complete stranger.
Sherlock nods, just barely, and the way they are pressed together John can feel his heart hammering away, beating wildly against his slender ribcage. He takes his hands away from Sherlock’s body and pulls back, putting a bit of space in between them.
Barring the whole Mary debacle, where he was fogged by grief and exhaustion, John’s instincts are seldom wrong--and as the days pass, John becomes increasingly certain he’s not wrong about this, either.
, but still we fall into the same roles, over and over again. You give, I take. You’re a martyr, I’m an arsehole. And we never even tried to change, not really. Even now, when we’re trying to…” Sherlock trails off, looks up at nothing, searching for just the right words. ”I want to be more than that. I want
He crosses over to where John is standing, book in hand. “What do you think, John? Can I open this piece of shoddy Amazon-dot-com rubbish in under a minute?”
“Are you going to sleep, you think?” John asks, before succumbing to the contagious urge and yawning himself.
John takes the gun, keeping it trained at the bloody, broken-nosed goon moaning on the floor. Sherlock crosses the small room, moves a stack of boxes aside, revealing a pile of large cylindrical parcels, rolled in clear plastic.
“Atherton confirmed that five more men that he knew personally have gone missing over the past eight weeks. All between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, all in relatively good health.” He turns to John. “The fiction of farm work in Yorkshire was a cover to explain the mens’ disappearances, but a flimsy one. If these men are still alive, they are here, in London, and they are
“Hmmm,” Sherlock answers, the syllable a low purr in his throat. He turns his head halfway back to look at John. John returns his eyes to his tablet, shamming rapt attention to his subpar novel, not wanting to spoil Sherlock’s act for Lestrade by appearing overeager.
Sherlock knows that on most days, John Watson is a calm man. Quiet. Reserved. Polite. Soft-spoken, even.
He pushes down a brief flare of irrational panic; surely he hasn’t gone very far, not in the middle of the night. He cranes his head, looks at the doorway; a sliver of dim yellow light is visible under the closed door. He just went to make a cuppa or find a snack or look something up on his laptop, then.
“I thought you’d like that one.” John gazed at the image before him, at the man now bound, blindfolded, plugged, and waiting on his bed. John would never abuse or mistreat him, never, but Sherlock wanted to give up power, to submit, to serve, and John was more than happy to oblige.
"Really," Sherlock affirms, underscoring the truth of his words with a none too subtle downwards push to John's head. John takes the hint, lowering his head back down between his thighs, pressing kisses to the pale delicate skin of his inner thighs, tracing the lines of his lean, defined muscles with his tongue, reveling in Sherlock writhing and gasping under his ministrations. Sherlock’s as-yet-ignored cock is a dark dusky red, so hard it's almost flush against his abdomen, bobbing against his concave belly with every shiver of his body, every involuntary flex and push of his hips.
Sherlock has always been enthusiastically indifferent to traditional modesty in the confines of their flat, and John has seen him many,
John considers for several long minutes, as headlights sweep past the window, each flash briefly illuminating the generic hotel framed art on the far wall.
To his pleased surprise, casual daily affection seems to stoke a fire in Sherlock, a hunger for touch and connection he had shut down so ruthlessly that John suspects he didn’t even know he had been starving for it all these years.
John stands, looks around the table at the still, shuttered faces. “You’re all going to let this fucking bigot speak for you?” he asks.
They go silent, words fading away as instinct takes over; they move together, the slap and slide of their bodies the only noise in the room save for the occasional moan or sigh. There’s no hurriedness, no urgency, no fear or worry or uncertainty, just the two of them, together, enjoying each other as time slows, stands still, the universe contracting to just the two of them joined like this, as close as human beings can be, making each other whole and complete.
"Nice of Mrs Hudson, but I’d have thought she’d go for something a bit more colourful,” John muses aloud as he returns to his book.
“My wife was… not what she led me to believe,” John says. “When she was found out, she ran. She sold the baby because she needed the money to hide from the people she wronged.”
“Hello again,” Sherlock says with a smile, and John realizes it’s the first honest smile he’s seen on that oddly lovely face.
“Evil runs bone deep in some people,’” Sherlock replies, a faraway, almost sad look in his eyes.“I know that’s a profoundly unscientific view to hold, but my experiences have never shown me any different. Some people are good, and some are...just evil. Full stop.”
“Rocco works for me at the shelter,” Atherton tells them. “He’s been with us a year. He’s worked hard to put his life back together, and he’s been nothing but reliable and trustworthy in the time I’ve known him. I’m tremendously proud of his achievements.”
John moves to the window, lifts the curtain with numb, bloodless fingers, watches Sherlock’s retreating back as he rounds the corner to Marylebone and disappears from sight. He pulls his phone from his jeans pocket; feeling like an even worse shit for texting Mycroft after Sherlock’s infuriated, appalled reaction, but there’s nothing else for it, not on this danger night to end all danger nights.
“John,” Sherlock murmurs, and takes hold of his upper arm, firm but not rough, steadying, supporting. “I don’t mind at all. I’d rather. Not that you need looking after, but--I’d rather, in fact.”
John laughs, low and quiet but utterly genuine. “From now on,” he replies, “You can ask me to kiss you absolutely any time you want.” He kisses Sherlock, not quite as erotically heated as a few moments before, but brimming with desperate, unspoken feeling. “Also, in the interest of full disclosure,” John murmurs against Sherlock’s flushed, swollen lips, “You should know you are allowed to kiss me anytime you want. And you never, ever have to ask.”
,” Sherlock breathes, and pulls him down into a crushing kiss, wrapping his hands around the cheeks of John’s arse and tugging him down firmly against his groin.
“Rejected sexaholic kills wife,” he begins. “A sex-obsessed husband was convicted yesterday of murdering his wife by deliberately driving their car into a tree at 84 mph. Ian Walters, 51, a driving test examiner and church treasurer from Swindon, Wiltshire, veered off the M1 after his wife, Tracy, asked for a divorce because of his insatiable demands….”
“Hungry?” Sherlock finally asks. “I’ve heard this part of New Jersey is renowned for the quality of its sandwiches. We passed a local deli that looks very promising, going by the signage and the position of the skips relative to the parking area.”
The pair slowly make their way back to the flat in the hushed, silver-grey twilight unique to a snowy afternoon, each holding a shopping bag, picking their way carefully across the slippery pavement.
He looks pale and wan in the light of the rising moon, and John sees, for the first time on this entire strange trip, the glimmer of uncertainty in Sherlock’s eyes.
“She’s primip,” he tells them, “thirty-nine weeks, advanced maternal age. Her injury shouldn’t pose a threat to the foetus, but monitor her pulse and BP closely. Stress-induced spontaneous labor is a distinct possibility.”
Sherlock stows the gun at the back of his waistband, pulls the burner phone from his front jeans pocket and flips it open. A few key taps later, a ringtone trills from under a handful of papers on Martinez’s desk.
The lock on the back garden fence is gone; the hinges swing freely, though the squeal seems loud in the silent night air.
Sherlock huffs, tossing the garment bag aside and opening the grey duffel, digging through the jumbled contents.
“You’re being punished,” John says with just a trace of a snarl. “Sluts don’t get cuddles, and I’m done with you for now.” He pushes Sherlock back with the flat of his hand. “Back to your place, side of the chair.”
“Agreed," Sherlock replies solemnly. "They’re not a biscuit, they’re a punishment. And then she left the way she came?”
“It’s scratchy,” he mutters by way of explanation, as Sherlock helps him pull the coverlet off the bed, tossing it haphazardly onto the floor. John arranges himself on the sheets, elbows and knees pressed into the mattress, underside of his cock rubbing deliciously against rough cotton, excitement and nervousness a hot heavy knot low in his belly. He closes his eyes, feels the bed creak and dip as Sherlock climbs on and repositions himself between his spread legs.
“You have no proof,” D'Annibale protests, but even as he says it John knows he’s not quite certain of his assertion.
“Please, love. It’s almost two in the morning, the sofa makes your back sore, and I am sorry. Truly I am. Please. Come to bed.”
“I’ve waited so long to touch you like this,” John murmurs into the damp curve of his neck. “You said I didn’t know, but I do, Sherlock. God, I do.” He slips his fingers under the band of Sherlock’s snug black briefs. “All right?”
The woman chuckles quietly. “If I was going to kill you, Doctor Watson, I would have done it long before now. Sugar?”
“Anything you want.” Sherlock moans, the exquisitely dirty words sparking a firestorm of arousal in his belly, the stirrings of an orgasm beginning to build low and hot in his spine. “Everything. You can have everything.”
Sherlock nods in approval. “I was hoping you’d be well enough for caffeine. I made coffee and found some bread for toast, when you’re ready.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer; instead he slides his hand carefully around the back of John’s head, cradling the base of his skull with a heartbreaking tenderness as his other hand presses the wad of blood-soaked cloth against the hole in John’s side.
“Come off it, Sherlock. You were taking pictures of me in that council estate getup. Part of your brilliant plan, I take it?’
One article of clothing at a time, he proceeds to help John get undressed, all the way down to vest and pants. John allows it without snark or complaint.
“I agree,” John murmurs, twisting his fingers in Shezza’s ratty, tangled curls and pulling him down for a kiss. A moment later he breaks away, pulling a face. “You could have brushed your teeth, though.”
John can feel Johnson’s glare on them as they leave his office. Sherlock pulls the door shut with a loud, careless thump.
“Walt Whitman,” Sherlock continued. “They named this bridge after him. He was from Camden. You wouldn’t think someone capable of that kind of art, that kind of beauty, could come from somewhere so…” Sherlock shakes his head. “Somewhere so.”
“Not the feminization part, and for the record I don’t find women’s clothing humiliating in the slightest. So I suppose It’s tactile thing, really,” Sherlock said with a shrug. “Silk, lace. Expensive fabrics. I like them. I would find it an interesting sensation.” Sherlock takes a pull of his drink, his cheeks gone a bit pink. “Being held tightly and... rubbed. So intimately.”
“You’re brilliant and talented,” John says quietly, fond amusement in his voice as he strokes reassuring fingers along the sensitive skin of Sherlock’s lower belly.
“All right,” he says at last. “Sit up, then, and face me.” The concern in his voice is now underlaid with a shade of his commanding tone. Sherlock hesitates for a moment, then obeys. John’s eyes are dark blue, crinkled with concern.
“Truly a pleasure doing business,” John says, smiling thinly as he shoves both the small gun and the holster inelegantly into his inside jacket pocket. “Sherlock, anything else to add?”
He stops mid-sentence as Sherlock looks up at him, his eyes pale silver in the torch’s flickering beam.
“I can’t,” Sherlock finally says, voice almost a whisper, and John hates how shaky and uncertain he sounds. “John. I can’t. You want me to tell you things that I--Don’t ask me to.
One of John’s hands comes up to stroke his hair, carding his fingers gently through dark curls as Sherlock deftly unfastens the button and zip of his jeans, yanking them impatiently down over his hips.
Louellen shakes her head, and behind her cool facade John sees the briefest glimpse of genuine sorrow.
“I love when you’re like this,” John rasps, his voice gone raw and ragged, his own demons set loose and running free. “When you’re crying from the pain, shivering and sweating, raw and open down to your very bones. When I take you apart like this I can see all of you, I can see and feel everything you are. You’re split wide open and you can’t hide from me like this, everything inside of you belongs to me and I love it.
A shower is non-negotiable; after he steps out of the tub and dries off, he swipes Sherlock’s spare dressing gown from the door hook. The sleeves hang comically below his fingertips, so he haphazardly rolls them up before making his way to the kitchen.
“Sherlock,” the woman’s voice says again, low and warning. “He would, and he can, and he will, so I advise you to consider your next words very,
“And that’s when Dr Murdoch assaulted me with the antique curio he kept on top of his filing cabinet,” Sherlock tells the DI flatly.
The look on Sherlock’s face at being so suddenly and obviously relegated to second place is priceless, and John thinks he may actually suffer an internal injury from holding in his laughter.
“Half when Doctor Watson has his daughter in his arms, half when we are safely wheels up and en route to London. Sent electronically from an unmarked Swiss account.”
John holds Sherlock’s glare for a moment before he rolls his eyes, shrugging a shoulder in acquiescence. “I don’t really have one, as such,” he grudgingly admits.
The back of John’s head slams into the bed, an involuntary moan torn from his lips as crackling bolts of pure pleasure race up his spinal column to explode in his brain.
“Of course, pet.” John comes back to bed, shucking off his jeans and pants before sliding his legs under the covers, sitting up with his back against the headboard. “Are you thirsty?”
“I know,” John says, far more contrite than he was towards Doctor Sheldon. Sherlock hands him a biro, and John begins to scribble his initials on the indicated spaces. “Sometimes, we have to do what we have to do,” he says, handing the papers back to the nurse.
Sherlock nods. “And you will. Talk to people. See if you can find anyone willing to go on record about the man in the white van.” He looks sharply at the pale young man. “Don’t go out in the streets, though. We don’t know how dangerous this mysterious man is, and I’ll not chance your safety.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “I’m not,” he murmurs, soft and a little sad, and it breaks John’s heart in two.
Sherlock settles himself in his chair. “Though I think, if I were you, I would just get rid of it. Throw it in the fire.”
“Yes,” John says. “Absolutely, yes. We don’t have to, you know, win any awards for acrobatic shagging, okay? I just want…” John traces the line of one sharp collarbone with his fingertip. “I just want to be here with you. I want to touch you. I want you to touch me. Nothing fancy. Just us, together. All right?”
John turns his hand over, interlaces their fingers together. He gives in to a mad impulse, bringing the tips of Sherlock’s fingers to his mouth, brushing them   across his lips. Sherlock's breath hitches just the tiniest bit.
With really nothing else to do and sleep still hiding out a million miles away, John gives in to the urge to check the news for mention of the events of Atlantic City. All he finds is a small article, barely two paragraphs, about an unidentified woman caught in the crossfire of a drive-by gang shooting at the Harrah’s parking garage. No names, or dates, or further identifying information.
Sherlock runs his fingertips between his pectorals and down his torso, his expression tightening briefly as he takes in the wounds on his belly, only just beginning to heal. He doesn’t say a thing, just traces his fingers around John’s injuries, close but not touching, intent, almost reverent, drawing slow, careful paths on his skin, across his ribs, down to his navel, lower.
“No,” he rasps. “No. It hurts, it’s so... full, so much, but it’s good. It’s going to be good, I know it is. Just go slow.”
“Red. Amber. Green.” Sherlock answers, eyes closed, his voice sounding distant and remote even to himself.
They stay like that for several long moments, breathing together, unwilling to break the fragile spell between them.
“Do you still want me inside you, love?” John’s unable to stop his hips from rutting gently against Sherlock’s long thigh, the tension tight in his belly and his balls achingly full and still-hard cock yearning for more friction, more pleasure, just plain
“Yes, John,” Sherlock gasped as he tried to thrust into John’s hand, the motion making him whimper in pain as the clips pulled at his flesh.
Solving a cipher hits the perfect reward spot in Sherlock’s brain. It’s a lovely intersection of challenge, logic, and success, with moderate stakes that don’t require massive exertion or costly emotional involvement, and it gives Sherlock the dopamine and norepinephrine reward he so craves at a minimal physical and emotional cost.
“Jesus, Sherlock. Stop. It. Now.” John gives a tiny involuntary gasp as Sherlock’s fingers begin to stroke the length of his rapidly hardening cock.
Sherlock steeples his fingers in his classic thinking pose, the effect only diminished somewhat by his current state of undress.
“Don’t be cruel,” Sherlock says. “I’m in a very vulnerable state right now. Maybe also a glass of water? And my laptop. A pillow, as well, if you don’t mind. I’ve got a lot of research to do, and I’d like to get started immediately.”
The man is being marvellous, he truly is, but the hovering is starting to grate on John’s pride --and nerves -- just slightly. John decides to take that as a sign of improving health rather than devolving mood.
“We’re no damn closer than we were yesterday,” John grumbles at he pokes dispiritedly into the congealed remains of a spinach and cheese calzone.
Martinez shrugs. “You seem like a happy couple to me, but hey, whatever. Your ass on the line, literally. How will she know who she’s looking for?”
“We’re off script, now, and taking it minute by minute. We need to deal with what we know, and what’s in front of us. At the moment, what’s in front of us is the corpse of Alexander Johnson.”
He hands the shopping bag to John, unlocks the car and gets behind the steering wheel without a moment of hesitation, starting the engine and pulling easily into traffic. He drives on the right side of the road like he’s done it his whole life. It makes John feel like he’s fallen into some kind of mirror universe.
The two men are ushered politely into the police cruiser; no cuffs, as they are honoured guests of the Metropolitan Police Department. Sherlock gestures with his head for John to go first, then slides into the car after him. As the car pulls into traffic John glances over at Sherlock, seated next to him, studiously avoiding his gaze.
Sherlock is watching telly in the recliner chair, his face drawn with tiredness,  pale eyes tinged with dark circles. He’s curled himself up somewhat awkwardly. making himself as small as possible, his arms wrapped around himself against the chill of the hospital air conditioning.
When the small plate was empty, John put it aside, reached out to Sherlock, tipped up his chin with his index finger and licked the traces of juice from Sherlock’s mouth. “I love you,” he whispered, and kissed him, soft and open-mouthed. Sherlock responded hungrily to the kiss, opening his mouth wide, welcoming John in with his hot, eager tongue. He tasted of oranges, and John lost himself in the kiss for several long moments as Sherlock whimpered, helplessly squirming against his restraints as he sought contact.
He shakes his head, chastising himself for entertaining lustful thoughts about his shivering, hypothermic lover.
John squints at him, momentarily confused, before the clouds part and understanding dawns: Sherlock’s not about to let him out of his sight for a minute if it can possibly be helped.
John nods, closes the cap and sets the bottle on the end table. He curls his right hand around Sherlock’s neck as he kisses him, his tongue slipping into Sherlock’s mouth hot and seeking as he slides the slicked fingers of his left hand into Sherlock’s cleft, finding his entrance with the unerring precision borne of long familiarity. Sherlock breaks the kiss with a sharp gasp as John slips two fingers in him without preamble, not hard but not quite gentle, either.
“I entertained the hypothesis, briefly, then discarded it. It seemed too outlandish, too melodramatic to be true. Or maybe I just wanted desperately to believe James Moriarty had been eliminated forever and for good. But in light of new information...it’s the only theory that fits the data.”
“No, John. Shut up. Don’t say that. Don’t say sorry. I’m just--oh, God. Thank God you’re alive.” Sherlock looks away briefly, exhales hard. “It was a closer thing than I really care to admit.”
“Well, then,” he murmurs, his warm baritone of his voice vibrating against John’s rib cage. “Glad that’s sorted.”
“I am going to find you,” John growls into the empty sitting room. “Just for the exquisite pleasure of strangling you myself.”
“So am I.” Sherlock pulls his head back slightly and gives John a searching look, chins folding up adorably.
He doesn’t take cases, though John can tell, by the expressions Sherlock makes and the timbre of his annoyed sighs, that Lestrade is texting him on a regular basis. As far as he can determine, Sherlock never replies.
John finds he’s not entirely certain if what he saw the night before was even real, or only part of another odd, disjointed dream.
with you. You're certain your life is about to end in that room. You wait for the bullet to the back of your head as you lie there, helpless, naked and torn and bleeding. You wait for it to be
The pair are silent for a moment, the awkwardness suffusing the room, making the air between them feel palpably thicker, heavier.
John stirs, stretches a bit -- he was about to drop off to sleep, no question -- and rolls onto his side to face Sherlock.
Greg scratches the back of his neck, eyes deliberately avoiding John’s. “There are other parties involved here, parties whose purview far exceeds the Met, you could say. We need to cover our collective arses, paperwork-wise, get our stories straight. But I’m certain you won’t be arrested.” His gaze finally comes to rest on John’s face. “Is that enough to go on for now?”
John sighs. “That’s not a real answer though, is it? I mean, I don’t know exactly how we’re going to navigate all of this, but... we both know what dishonesty and half-truths lead to. Lies always tear things apart, in the end.”
”But. There are notes. My area of research was extending the four year window for… certain units who were exceptionally useful or valuable.” Sherlock exhales, a soft pained huff. “It was was for me, I think. Mycroft assigned me research into extending my own life, and I didn’t even know it.”
“it doesn’t affect the test,” John replies neutrally, making the final calibrations to his equipment. “All right, I’m going to ask you a series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.” He exhales, modulates his voice into perfectly measured impassivity, a necessity for obtaining the most accurate results. “It’s your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.”
Well before his eyes can fully adjust to the dimness, a large, shadowy slab of man appears squarely in front of them as if from nowhere. He holds up a large hand, pushes it towards Sherlock but does not actually touch him.
Caldwell nods imperceptibly to the burly man at his side; the bodyguard steps forward, grabbing Sherlock’s lapel roughly. John leaps forward, completely willing to take down a man close to twice his size for daring to put his hands on Sherlock.
His constrained cock pulses, a dribble of precome smearing wet against the sheets as his heart pounds in anticipation of whatever creative torment John wishes to inflict.
“Zero-eight-one-zero-three,” John reads aloud. His mouth turns downward, his lips pressing together as his still-slightly-slow brain attempts to parse the information. “So the address on the envelope is incorrect.”
“Ordinarily, yes,” Sherlock says, “But we’re aiming to outrun, not outwit. Time is of the essence this morning.”
running just barely underneath. “The further we are from that lunatic, the safer we are. All other concerns are a distant second.”
Sherlock’s not under yet; the endless data streams are still buzzing and circling around in his brain, the chatter insistent, and the distraction of it keeps him from the task at hand, unable to do the one thing required of him when they two of them come together like this -- to
John pastes a smile on his face. It feels like a rictus of revulsion. Sherlock is right again; John is a terrible liar. He tries to soften his lips into something more passably natural.
“Be back in a little while to check on you.” Glenn gathers up a few last bits of paper, tissues and straw wrappings before he leaves, easing the door shut behind him.
Sherlock gasps and whimpers as the flared base nudges past past his tight, burning rim and seats fully inside him. His breathing goes ragged at the feeling of hot, insistent fullness, at the confusing not-quite-pain, not-yet-pleasure signals his body is sending.
Sherlock stands up, knees cracking slightly. John turns to his left, looks at himself in the mirror. Sherlock gives him a questioning look.
Sherlock sees something dark and feral there, emerging from the depths of John’s deep blue eyes. It makes him feel pinned down, helpless already under that unflinching gaze.
Sherlock is curled on his side, facing John, his eyes closed, the crows-feet that are beginning to etch themselves deep gone smooth and relaxed.
Now, finally, there’s no outside enemy here to tear them apart. It’s the two of them, doing the best that they can and there’s simply nothing to be done about it except muddle through as well as they are able.
Minutes pass without reply as John drinks a glass of water, showers and shaves. He pretends he doesn’t care that his message goes unanswered. He prints the image Sherlock sent him, jots down Sherlock’s number on the back.
“Yes,” John murmurs, kissing him again. Sherlock kisses him back, mouth soft and responsive, but John tell his brain is still whirring and clicking, still working through some delicate proceeding.
John busies himself by opening Gmail on his phone and composing a note Mrs Hudson as Sherlock requested. He finds the words shockingly hard to come by, his typing slow and painstaking even compared to his usual, the words he wants to use slipping out of his reach before he can pin them down. He blows out a breath in frustration.
Sherlock smiles at that, and moves in to kiss him again, making up for lost time, finding the lube and flipping the cap, slicking his fist before closing it around John’s cock, bringing it back up to full attention immediately, making John draw in his breath sharply. Sherlock works him up and down, just the pressure and speed John likes, as expertly as if he’s been doing it forever. That thought makes John wonder, fleetingly, to what extent Sherlock surreptitiously monitored his self-pleasure habits all those years, and the idea of that sends a fresh shower of silvery hot sparks of arousal across his nerve endings.
He thinks, briefly, of the early days of their romantic relationship, that amazing terrifying uncertain time when their love was undeniable but their hearts battered, their frayed emotional connection just starting to heal. He remembers how every moment of intimacy was heavy with meaning, fraught with raw desire but also terror and vulnerability and uncertainty. Both of them had treated each shared sexual act like a precious, fragile treasure, something that could be smashed to bits at any moment. Every touch and sensation and murmured word had to be catalogued, stored and protected at all costs, hoarded in fear of the day when it would all crumble into dust and stored memories would be all there were left to soothe the emptiness they both believed was their inevitable due.
If it weren’t for the cock ring he would have come untouched long ago, would have shuddered and spent himself against the tangled blue sheets, but the snug leather circles his shaft and bisects his scrotum, holding him snugly, the pressure making him unable to orgasm, keeping him on the agonizing precipice as John tongue fucks him, occasionally pulling back to bite or slap the swell of his arse or massage and stroke his trapped, swollen bollocks. Sherlock whimpers and moans, wantonly thrusting his aching prick against the tangled sheets.
Pinned as he is under the weight of Sherlock’s gaze, his desire for him a palpable, tangible thing, John can’t help but be a bit of a harlot, savouring the deliciously wanton, exposed feeling. He gives his prick a slow, leisurely tug, savoring the moment of delicious stretch and friction against his cock, then moves his hand lower, cupping and massaging his aching balls as he spreads his legs lasciviously wide for Sherlock, lewdly exposing his slick arsehole and feeling the cool air against the wetness there.
“I’ve had enough with the fucking cancer sticks for tonight. I can’t stop you, God knows I’ve tried, but take it outside for just ten goddamn minutes so I can breathe.”
It’s slow going; absent a pair of clippers, Sherlock has to rinse off the blade after every few centimetres of progress. Both men are silent, the sound of their breathing loud in the tiny tiled room as Sherlock focuses the entirety of his attention on this tiny, mundane task as if the fate of the entire universe hangs in the balance. His hair has gone spiky and clumpy in the humidity, and he chews unconsciously on his lower lip as he works, drawing the sharp blade across John’s skin, so very careful not to harm him or draw blood.
It’s a beautiful house where two successful, upper-middle-class professionals with large bank accounts would live out their pastoral Instagram-ready aspirations.
So put all that together and it adds up to... to John having absolutely no  idea what shape this thing between them would take.
Two forms lumber out of the darkness. One is about a metre high, dressed like a clock work soldier, with a white face and circle of rouge on its cheeks The other is over two metres tall, grey-skinned, red eyes glowing and a glimpse of pale fangs visible.
Sherlock peels himself off John’s back. John rolls over to find Sherlock is watching him, eyes raking him from head to toe, then focusing on his very erect cock with fierce, laser-focused interest.
“Text me,” Lestrade says before turning and leaving without another word, clearly anxious to get back to work on the case.
“So everybody knew,” John says, feeling a bit like he’s having an out of body experience. “The whole time. Everyone knew.”
“Would have to be, with all this booze to go with.” John holds up his glass in a mock-toast before draining the last of the ruby liquid. “One to three hours? Aside from getting pissed on Tesco pinot noir, how do you propose we pass the time?”
It takes Sherlock less than half a second to come to the same conclusions John arrived at earlier. “Okay,” he says after a beat, and John knows Sherlock is forcing himself to sound calmer, more sure of himself, his voice taking on the the not-quite-genuine placating tone one would use with a hysterical child or a desperate man standing on a ledge. “I’m on my way. Don’t move, don’t do anything.” John hears him swallow hard, forcing the fear down. “Promise me,” Sherlock says, and his voice quivers just the tiniest bit. “John. Promise me.”
“In point of fact, you’re cutting my hair. I’m assuming you’re familiar with a basic induction-style clipper cut.”
And if there was a blank space in the room, an emptiness hovering near the kitchen door where there should have been aggrieved sighs and mutterings about
“We’re that sure of ourselves, are we?” John says, the fond grin pulling at the corner of his mouth softening the archness of his words as his fingertips rub circles at the small of Sherlock’s back.
“What about you?” Sherlock murmurs, and John realises his still semi-erect cock is pushing against Sherlock’s thigh.
“You are drunk, my love.” John sits back on his heels, surveying his work as the logs catch and blaze, filling the darkened room with a warm orange glow.
The other two men, deep in discussion, don’t even notice his momentary mental absence. John seems to sense Greg’s lack of hostility and relaxes quickly. An hour later, as they leave for Croydon to re-interview Susan Cushings, it almost feels like it did in the old days. Sherlock finds himself hoping that perhaps everything can still go back to what it used to be, that they can still go home again after all.
The strokes come slower this time, but even harder, his body pitching forward with the force of each blow. Sherlock counts them out, his voice deep and hoarse, counts even as he swims in a red haze of pain and need, the fabric of John’s jeans rubbing against his desperately aching cock with every blow. He surrenders himself to the overwhelming tide of sensation, the dark and magical place where pleasure and pain overlap and become something exponentially greater, the endorphins and opiate analogs flooding his body. He’s incredibly high, soaring on something he never even knew he needed, something no needle could ever, ever match.
“Don’t you dare say you’re sorry, Sherlock. She’s protecting you. I deserved that. I can’t say I would do any differently in her shoes.” He crosses his arms across his chest, a gesture of self-preservation that belies his words.
“I don’t…” Sherlock hesitates. “I don’t know how any of this is supposed to work. I don’t know what to
John rises from the couch, crosses the room to his chair and grabs the tartan throw from the back before returning to his space on the couch, wrapping the slightly tatty blanket around his shoulders and reaching for the popcorn on the coffee table with his right hand.
He does not act on the impulse. Instead, he briefly closes his eyes, taking in a deep, calming breath.
The two of them are quiet for some time. John pulls out his phone, Googles for any news stories about abandoned newborns in Eastern Pennsylvania or New Jersey while Sherlock finds his way back to I-95.
The horror John feels is powerful, overwhelming, a sudden and sickening sideways lurch in his stomach. For a moment he’s certain he will vomit, but he forces himself to keep still, and a few seconds later the sick clenching wave recedes a bit, enough to allow him to breathe again.
Sherlock wants to reassure John but he doesn’t know what else to say, and his battered body is still clamouring for rest, so he falls quickly back into slumber, fingers still wrapped around John’s wrist.
“But you made a nice tidy sum off selling my daughter, I’d wager.” John doesn’t even try to hide the pure loathing in his voice, and Johnson has the good sense to at least look ashamed.
-- but it is airy and light, done in tones of grey and off-white. The furniture is some kind of farmhouse style, John supposes, a tall dresser and bureau made of reclaimed wood from a Welsh dairy barn or some such nonsense, the type of furniture that manages to look battered, worn, and hideously overpriced all at the same time.
She studies John, squinting slightly as she tilts her head. “She looks like you. I don’t even know your name.”
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson,” he says, and how he manages to sound perfectly serene and composed in such a compromising position, erection still poking insistently into John’s belly-- it’s quite impressive, really.
He remembers a class from his first year of medical school, about the use of preservative solutions during organ transport.
When he wakes, John is standing at his bedside, reading his chart. His face is grey with worry and exhaustion, bags etched deep under his eyes. Sherlock can see he hasn’t slept in days.
“Whatever you think is best,” Sherlock concedes. “Though, in the interest of full disclosure, I want you to know I find this all a bit...frustrating.” He can’t help himself from proving his words by taking one of John’s hands where it rests on his thigh and bringing it up to cup the hardness of his cock through his wool trousers.
He steals a glance at Sherlock. If he feels the same as John, he certainly doesn’t show it, looking as utterly cool and in control as ever in his perfect new coat.
, to just leave Sherlock be, so hard not to hover and fuss over the man he loves when Sherlock is so clearly shaken down his very bones, retreating deep down into himself and trying desperately to regroup, to reclaim his the place he’s made for himself in this world. But as much as it pains John to sit and do nothing, he understands, on an intuitive level he can’t quite put into words, that Sherlock needs time and space to work through these private struggles on his own.
In the end, in the final calculation, it’s all anyone has left to hold on to. And if you hold on to it tightly and don’t let go, it will see you through the worst of the darkness and safe to the other side.
Sherlock does as he says and John spoons up against him, propping himself up on his injured arm; it hurts, but not unbearably so. He presses himself close to Sherlock’s back; he can’t keep his erection from pressing into the hollow at the small of his back, and the friction and warmth against John’s aching cock is delectable, maddening. With an effort he pushes his own arousal down, out of his mind, dedicating himself instead to what Sherlock needs.
As if on cue, a startling screech of siren goes off somewhere behind them, making John jump in his seat. He and Sherlock turn in unison to see a cavalcade of flashing lights commence, along with a variety of carnival noises as a winning jackpot pours forth an avalanche of jangling metal, the coins cascading onto the carpet at the feet of a tiny, whey-skinned, late-middle-aged woman who frankly looks rather more terrified than happy at this turn of events.
“Apology accepted,” the other man replies, chilly and equally insincere. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients as well.”
One more secret. One more mystery. One more part of his life Sherlock hadn’t seen fit to share with him.
You win. I would love to have enthusiastic penetrative anal sex with you, okay? You mad, inappropriate bastard.”
And now there is a fourth, and despite the plethora of physical evidence it’s not adding up the way it should and despite John holding firm on eating and sleeping (he insists it helps, that it makes Sherlock work better, and John is always right so Sherlock complies, but right now he’s really starting to question) Sherlock is feeling the stress, his nerves irritated and stretched thin.
Sherlock turns on his side to face him. “A mad, larcenous, bastard who correctly deduced the probable course of our relationship, is what you mean.”
“At Patricia Hackforth’s favourite smoothie shop. She goes out for lunch every day at 1:30 pm, and she gets a wrap and smoothie here several days out of the week. Her filled punch card was on her desk next to her handbag. She’s planning on coming here today.”
“Are you all right?” John murmurs, kissing Sherlock’s sweaty temple, releasing his soft spent cock and surreptitiously wiping his hand on a shirt draped over a nearby chair.
“John, please,” Sherlock breathes. “Oh God, please, yes, please fuck me,” and John lets himself go, lets himself give in to the ancient howling instinct in the base of his brain and fucks him, deep and hard, hands gripping Sherlock’s narrow pelvis. He feels the pleasure coil itself at the base of his spine as drives himself into the hot slick channel of his body, over and over, while Sherlock’s slim hard body writhes in ecstasy underneath him.
He releases their joined hands and stands, brushing sand off his trousers before extending a hand to help Sherlock up off the ground. Sherlock grabs his shoes and socks, tucks them under his elbow then takes John’s hand, allows himself to be pulled upright. Unfolded to full height, Sherlock gazes down, hair rumpled and tufted, cheeks pink from the chilly breeze, eyes bright and pale even in the dim yellow light of the rising moon.
He is floating for what feels like hours but is likely only a few minutes when John folds the paper and sets it aside. He tugs on the leash firmly, pulling Sherlock to him. It catches him a bit off balance, and he wobbles on his knees to keep from tipping over. John looks at him, smirking a bit at Sherlock’s embarrassed, ungainly awkwardness.
Sherlock pauses his washing-up and looks at John, eyes carefully blank and patient. “If I recall correctly, you took care of me for almost two months when I was shot. Fifty eight days in all, not that I was counting.”
“What?” John asks. His blood sugar is up, which helps some, but the Dilaudid hasn’t quite kicked in yet and his incision aches and he’s still feeling way more than a little snippy after his pointless and disappointing lunch.
He remembers Mary in her satin dress, a jeweled clip in her short blonde hair, eyes sparkling in the candlelight as her pink mouth laughed, pale skin glowing and lovely, and his bloodthirsty desire for vengeance crumbles and disappears even as he clearly sees what he must do.
After the murderer is captured (no chases tonight, they caught him as he was working on his boat; the stupefyingly unobservant man hadn’t even heard them coming until Lestrade was practically on top of him and slapping on cuffs), Sherlock turns to John, feeling the buzz of a solved case trickling through his veins.
, dammit, and the delicious aroma of hot fried food is wafting in from the adjoining room--but the lean hard press of Sherlock’s clothed body against his bare skin is too completely intoxicating to resist, and he can’t seem to stop himself from pulling Sherlock down on top of him, their limbs tangling together, hands roaming freely as kisses grow wet and messy and demanding.
“Very possibly, but we don’t have time to explain it all right now,” Sherlock says, “We need you to help us. Katie has just erased all of her social media accounts, and Adam as well. They’re going to run, and our only chance of getting John’s daughter back is if you call her, right now, and find out where they’re going. Can you do that, Patricia?”
“You know who we've are, tracked us down, and you’re not looking to--I don’t know. Eliminate us? Take us out?”
