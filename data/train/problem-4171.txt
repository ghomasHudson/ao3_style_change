Strange, he's never felt bad about that sort of thing before. He chalks it up to sharing a bedroom with Dean while his dick is unattended to. By the time Dean emerges from the bathroom, Castiel is already tucked in. Dean putters around for a few minutes, setting his alarm and checking his phone. The city lights peek through the curtains and illuminate the white tee and maroon boxers Dean wears, yet another image for Castiel to file away for usage later.
While Castiel thinks it's probably true, he doesn't understand how Gabriel could know such a thing. He says as much.
before yanking it from the shelf. He settles onto the couch, and, with a deep breath, he opens the book and begins reading.
“Don't get any ideas,” he mutters, debating on whether or not he should actually allow Gabe to run the place for a bit. Deciding it probably won't hurt their sales anyway, he leaves Gabriel to it, shooting one last wary warning at his brother before ascending the stairs.
Castiel drives off, the threatening figure of Bobby Singer growing smaller in the rear-view mirror, and he only breathes easier again once they're off the property. Dean chuckles.
Dean wipes his mouth with his napkin and takes a sip of his wine to collect his thoughts. He's barely halfway through his first glass while Castiel is already on his second.
Dean is quiet for far too long that Castiel assumes he's fallen asleep, so Dean's voice startles him. “I'm really not,” Castiel hears him whisper.
They arrive back at the house just in time for a dinner consisting of homemade meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Mrs. Butters leaves at six, promising to return the next day at ten, so Castiel will be on his own for breakfast, but she wrapped some loaf and potatoes for him to take for lunch. Castiel finds it odd to have someone taking care of him like this, though it is not entirely unwelcome. He is used to the quiet and unseen maids in his Chicago penthouse. Not this cheerful and lively housekeeper.
Showered and dressed in slacks and a button-down of the day, Castiel heads off to work. The back alley is a learning process; the first morning, he makes the mistake of trying to drive out the same way another car is trying to drive in. His neighbor, an older man named Frank, yells at Castiel for five minutes about how the younger generation has no sense of direction, be it cars or running the world and a bunch of other malarkey Castiel disregards. By the end of the week, though, he's fairly comfortable at driving his Mercedes in and out of the narrow backstreet.
“Oh hush,” she scolds, but she gives a little twirl for his benefit. “You look pure brilliant yourself, Winchester,” she adds after a moment, approving of his suit.
Although, it seems that Dean had wanted him to stay. He'd been surprised when Castiel confirmed he'd be returning to Chicago, as if Dean had made his own assumptions. Not that it matters anymore.
“They have food,” Castiel points out, looking at the flatbread section of his own menu. “I suppose it's more selective than other places, but the online reviews were full of praise.”
He deletes the text, but he can't seem to exit the draft still directed at Dean's number. His glass is empty again, so Castiel takes a long pull straight from the bottle, enjoying the burn in his throat.
“Most likely? I'll leave it in my name but let you have free reign. Think of it as an investment on my part.”
Fergus's yellow eyes gleam in the dark room as Castiel climbs up into the area. The shades have been lowered, unusual since Rowena has so many plants and it's not even two in the afternoon, but the kitchen window allows for enough light that Castiel doesn't feel too weird. Is it ridiculous to think the darkness might have something to do with the demon cat?
. He supposes Cas might laugh and call it a good game, because why else does the angel keep spouting nonsense day after day? Surely he is waiting for Dean to play along, as this is the only conclusion Dean had reached after thinking over Sam's words the other day.
He wants to tell Dean that all of his problems could be solved by moving to Chicago and letting Castiel take care of him, but he can't say any of that tonight, not if he doesn't want to take away from the progress they've made. Castiel won't belittle Dean's struggle for success with stories of his own.
Although the auto shop keeps him busy during the week, he swings by for a quick lunch, and he spends hours there on the weekends. Rowena has that look, that she knows something changed between them, although she doesn't meddle again. She just smiles wisely and sips her tea, smirking every time Dean hangs around to spend a little extra time with Castiel.
Dean sloshes water all over himself at the sudden greeting, watering can clattering against the tile where he drops it. “Damn it, Cas!” But he's avoiding Castiel's gaze. “Rowena sent you up here, huh? Wants us to talk it out and whatnot?”
By the time he gets there, Rowena has already unlocked the front door and propped it open, a practice by which she refuses to budge. Although technically her boss, Castiel doesn't desire to get into a fight his first month here, so he allows it. Mollified somewhat by her explanation that, by having the door open, the ocean air helps to actually
They leave the restaurant hand in hand, and Castiel doesn't think he's ever had such a good time with someone before. Dean's touch sends warmth tingling through his veins as they cross the street to walk along the seawall's oceanside, hands swinging between them. They travel a few blocks, discussing mostly the store. Everything from the books to the coffee to the sales. They talk about Rowena and her love of plants, of Crowley and his demonic aura. Castiel shares a few stories from his childhood involving his siblings, omitting the finer details, and Dean tells him of several motel adventures with Sam, and Castiel has never felt so at peace.
“Yeah, that's the one. 'Where's Cas? Is he all right, is he ill?'” Gabriel mocks, though it is a poor imitation in Castiel's opinion. “And seriously,
Dean laughs, a rich sound that catches Castiel off guard. “Little shit tried to claw my eyes out the first time we met. He still pounces on my chest whenever he gets the chance.”
The man wakes with a start, flailing ungracefully before rolling off the sofa and onto the floor, knocking over several books on the nearby coffee table in the process. He stands quickly, glancing around to get his bearings before his eyes rest on the two men hovering. The man allows his gaze to roam from Gabriel's casual polo and jeans, to Castiel's suit and trench coat, eyes lingering a bit longer on Castiel than his brother.
“Sounds romantic,” Dean replies sarcastically, freeing the top few buttons of Castiel's shirt. “What about it?”
“What a view. You must come up here often,” Castiel says. He's not quite sure what to do with himself. He had sort of hoped Dean would snub him after Castiel never called. But he's also relieved, soaking in Dean's presence. Tonight he's wearing a flannel shirt and jeans. Although the jeans are tattered and old, at least the rest of him is fairly clean. Castiel prefers him like this, when he can stare at Dean's freckles uncovered.
“Buying a car,” Castiel replies, and he tries to ignore the salesman's greedy smile at those words. “Why do you sound–”
“How are you so good at this?” he envies, watching Dean make a perfect mocha frappé. “Were you a barista at one point?”
“I think you look downright tasty, Clarence,” says Meg, one of Rowena's friends who is in town for the weekend. She has been stalking Castiel around the store since Wednesday afternoon, dropping heavy hints that she's interested, no matter how many times Castiel tells her he plays for the other team.
Castiel stares dumbly at the man's pink lips while they move. His brain stutters. “I've... been here a month,” is all he can manage.
Dean rolls onto his side and locks eyes with Castiel. “Not that I expect you to do the same!” he amends. “I know Ro kinda shoved all of this on you last minute, and you could do so many more interesting things than watch me get dressed–”
until he's getting out of his car at the closest Target parking lot. Castiel swipes the little card from where it had been tucked behind the mirror on the visor. Squinting, he recognizes the Singer Auto logo and figures they must leave their business cards. A bit wasteful, in Castiel's opinion, leaving it where someone may not notice, and even if they do, there's a good chance it will go straight into the garbage can.
There's a small lot behind the row of buildings where he works; although getting in and out can take a while, depending on how many cars are trying to park or leave at the same time, he's grateful not to be parking on the street each day.
He turns back to Dean, whose eyes are hopeful and teasing, bursting blues and reds and greens dancing across his face. He's beautiful, and Castiel is stunned. Dean is handsome to be sure, but never has Castiel thought someone
“Ah, yeah... Couldn't get one since I didn't exactly have proof she was harassing me, so instead, I moved. I try to stick to the Texas circuit these days, though she still shows up from time to time. Redid my contract to end it after this year. Would have quit sooner but Sam's still finishing school and we need the money.”
“You're not sticking around for breakfast?” Dean questions, hoping Cas doesn't hear the ache behind it.
Castiel doesn't have a chance to answer, scrambling away from the hidden door as it opens seconds later to reveal not only Dean Winchester but the Scottish Fold, too. “Sorry, Ro,” Dean greets, still holding the cat, who, as far as Castiel can tell, seems perfectly content in the man's arms. “I didn't realize how long I slept. Crowley didn't want me to leave.”
, his mind supplies, and Castiel turns his body enough to hide his rapidly-hardening cock from Dean. “It's fine,” he manages, hoping Dean doesn't recognize the need in those rasped words. “I'd like to come if you'll let me.”
Castiel doesn't say anything until they've reached their suite on the seventh floor. “Smith?” he finally inquires, sparing a glance for the double queen beds as Dean claims the one by the window.
Castiel storms off, heading for the exit and the elevators, uncaring at that point if Dean is behind him or not. He is, of course, and is grinning like a fool.
Castiel can't imagine losing his mother so young. She'd always been the rock of the Novak family, looking after them all while running the corporation with an iron fist. And his father, while not as stern, especially after his health scare, Castiel can't picture him abandoning his own children. Dean must have been forced to grow up quickly.
Castiel invites him up to the front door. “I pay for the upkeep in exchange for room and board,” he reveals, unlocking the door.
and all, making the line sound less like a flirtation, and more like a bad attempt at understanding humanity.
Castiel doesn't know how to address most of that. He knows he's happy with Dean, but until Gabe said it, he didn't realize just how much he's
“Dude,” Dean admonishes, shoving the hurt back where it came from before Cas can notice, “my mouth burns just
Castiel frowns. “You're the one who said I'd finally gotten my head out of my ass, and now you're telling me you have doubts?”
His thumb strokes along the underside of Dean's wrist, and Dean sucks in a tiny gasp. Castiel steps closer, waiting for any sign that he should stop, but Dean can't seem to move, eyes dark and lingering on their joined limbs. Castiel slides his other hand behind Dean's neck as he closes the distance, their shoes touching. Dean's eyes meet his before lowering to Castiel's lips, and Castiel tugs Dean's head down to meet him.
Although the bookstore only occupies the ground level, the structure itself is three stories tall, and Castiel was wrong to assume them to be occupied by storage rooms. The stairs open up to a small but homey living room, stuffed with a couch, chair, and even more bookcases, all crowded around a tiny fireplace. The books here are even older and rougher than the stacks downstairs, but Castiel figures they are worn with years of love rather than neglect. Plants hang from almost every available space on the ceiling, and a very ancient, boxy television protrudes from the widest shelf available. To his right, Castiel can see a tiny bathroom beyond a small door, and to his left, a second staircase leads to the third floor, wiry and black and curved.
The rest of the show passes in a blur of colors and faces. After the event has ended, guests and staff are invited to attend an on-site after-party, and Castiel hears someone mention that's where the models have already been shuttled, so he follows the crowd.
Cas doesn't stay, and although Dean feels that pull, something that plucks inside whenever Cas departs, Dean doesn't ask him to either.  He just walks Cas to the front door where he can disappear freely outside the building's warding.
. Another of Galveston's flaws. The sand isn't pristine or white like beaches should be, and the water looks brown and disgusting. Castiel read an article detailing a woman's encounter with brain-eating amoeba in the ocean. No thank you.
. He snorts; perhaps it hadn't been so random after all. Gabriel hurriedly dumps it onto an end table.
He spends a painstaking amount of time researching and arranging the date. He scours the internet for the best restaurants in Galveston, eventually choosing and securing reservations to the Rooftop Bar atop the Treemont Hotel. He has his car washed, because even though Dean wants to take the Impala, Castiel is adamant that, as the one taking Dean out, he will be the one to pick up Dean. He frets over what to wear, finally deciding on a nice black blazer and navy button-down with his favorite blue tie, the one Anna says brings out the color in his eyes. Although he's trying not to be assumptive, Castiel stocks up on condoms and lube; even if they don't use them tonight, he's positive they'll come in handy at some point (preferably soon).
“Do you really mean that, Cas?” he asks, eyes searching. “You're not just saying that to get into my bed?”
Dean growls, pushing between the two of them and forcing Aaron's hand away. “Hey, watch it–” he warns, and even though Castiel doesn't require help, he feels another rush of warmth at Dean's protectiveness.
Castiel can't bear to be on the bed where he lay only hours ago with Dean, so he and Rowena crowd onto the single mattress in the second bedroom, huddled together eating ice cream and watching
One day, maybe soon, maybe tonight, he'll tell Castiel. Tell him how much he loves and appreciates him. But for now, he will wait until Cas comes back, comes back to
Although Castiel agrees wholeheartedly with that second statement, he frowns at the way Dean seems to think of Sam as the 'brains' of the family, as if he's not intelligent too. To be fair, Castiel didn't think so either at first; he recalls Dean first mentioning the GED and Castiel's subsequent sneer. Even if Dean isn't a genius, Castiel shouldn't have judged so quickly. Dean is clearly talented in other areas.
“You want a picture?” Dean asks easily, almost flirtatiously if Castiel didn't know better, and yeah, apparently he's been staring too long.
They close shop at five, Castiel helping to keep Rowena on a set schedule. He returns home around five-thirty to whichever heavenly dinner Mrs. Butters has prepared that day. She does the dishes while he eats, and although Castiel could retreat to the dining room for privacy, he doesn't want to create more of a mess for her to clean right before she leaves, so he chooses to take his meals in the kitchen and listen to the woman prattle on about her day and her family.
Castiel rolls his eyes and follows Dean into the hotel lobby. “I assume you've been here before then?”
Or when Dean calls Cas to discuss a theory during a hunt Sam had initially claimed would be an easy salt and burn. The phone rings three times before Castiel picks up, answering with, “This call may be recorded for training purposes.” Dean lets out a bark of laughter, startling Sam and the two people he'd been interviewing. After agreeing that demonic possession is unlikely in this particular case, Cas hangs up with a casual, “I gotta bounce,” and Dean's laughter comes back twofold.
to do. It had been Gabriel's genius idea to buy out a failing business and get it back on its feet. At the end of the year, Castiel can either sell it back or maintain some sort of ownership, whatever he decides. Upon hearing of Gabe's plans to have his brother run a bed and breakfast, however, Castiel intervened to have some input on his temporary endeavor.
Rejection doesn't happen often to Castiel, but it's happened before. He just brushes it off and picks himself back up, finds another willing participant for his bed that night, and never thinks of it again.
“That's impressive,” Castiel muses. He wonders why Sam is off at an expensive law school and Dean is living down in Galveston working on cars. “Did you go to school there, too?”
“I thought that was before... I thought...” He shakes his head and looks to Castiel desperately. “You just... seem so happy here. I thought you'd decided to stay.”
me to leave?” Cas challenges effortlessly, like he'll slip away and never mention this again if that's what Dean wishes.
Before Castiel can ask, Dean remarks, “When I said I wanted to go out together, I was thinking more, like, an actual meal, you know?”
“Of course not, Dean, I just want to take care of you,” he argues, heart clenching at the betrayed look on Dean's face. Why doesn't Dean understand that Castiel just wants to make him happy?
Castiel bites his lip. “Why not? I like you Dean, I like you a lot. And... I've been thinking about it. It would be good for you to come back with me.” Dean's expression blanks, and Castiel grips his hands tightly. “I have a nice penthouse apartment with plenty of room for both of us,” he insists, talking faster as Dean's face remains emotionless. “I go to a lot of functions and charity events, we'd get you some really nice suits... My family would love you. And you wouldn't have to worry about your ex or modeling. You wouldn't need to worry about school or working... or Sam's tuition, you'd never have to want for anything again.”
They do just that, making a quick detour to the hotel room so Dean can wash his face and use the restroom. Castiel does the same, and he also loses the expensive suit jacket that makes him feel overdressed next to Dean, who's wearing a simple polo and slacks now that he's done modeling.
“Sort of,” he answers with a grin, bouncing on the balls of his feet. “My GED doesn't allow many options, but I'm trying to get a certification.”
“Did you?” he asks roughly, throat catching. He's never really felt like this before, never really cared what other people thought of him. “Buy it, I mean.”
“Ignore him.” Both men turn to see a short blonde heading over. “Dean only believes in cars and music that came before 1979. Besides, Galveston isn't exactly big; I doubt he's burning through miles.”
Once Dean is led away to get dressed, a staff member directs Castiel back to the ballroom for the event. There's still an hour to go, so Castiel orders a drink from the bar and people watches. With half an hour left, Bela the reporter drops onto the stool next to him.
make his pants suddenly feel tighter, and Dean sucks in a huge breath, hoping to put any amount of distance between himself and Castiel, who apparently still has yet to master the concept of
His cart is soon bogged down with food, presents, and copious amounts of alcohol. Dr. Alder recommended cutting back on the liquor, and Castiel
“Yeah, only went back for my GED later to appease Sam. I had to pay bills and set aside funds for Sam's college tuition. We were in New York at the time, so I tried to push him towards Cornell or Columbia, in-state tuition, you know? But he was dead-set on Stanford, so I started working several jobs.”
Dean snorts at the greeting but chooses to interpret it literally. “Yes, we've got eggs, bacon, waffles, sausages... If you want toast, get it yourself but don't expect the damn machine to cooperate.” He jerks his elbow in the direction of the coffee maker. “Hey, there's a fresh pot if you want some.”
As it is, the weather is fairly cold for Galveston this time of year, the highs hugging 70 degrees, but more often than not, dropping between 65 and 60, bolstered by the sea winds.
Then there are other times that leave Dean more confused, such as when Cas brings a collection of hexed Christmas ornaments over for Sam to lock away in a protected box. He dumps the tin container currently housing the dangerous trinkets into Sam's awaiting arms and marches across the library to where Dean relaxes in an armchair, watching episodes of
“Lucky for me, you're here,” Castiel replies, hands fisting into his fiancé's hair and tugging him down for one of many more kisses.
Still, Castiel allows himself to admit the home is beautiful. He doesn't care for the local plant life; he's never been a fan of palm trees or sago bushes. At least he won't have to look at them much; he assumes he will spend his days either inside, or over at his new workplace.
He takes a beer from the fridge and stomps back to his room, trying not to let Sam's ideas rattle around in his mind.
Rowena breathes a sigh of relief. “Good. I'm glad to see you've come with confidence because you're going to need it. The dark witch is here, too.”
Castiel orders a Texican Old Fashioned, which looks like a really fancy name for a modified whiskey, and Dean requests a water. Perhaps he'd prefer something off-menu?
It's been two weeks since Cas fled the bunker with nary a word, his only source of contact being short text messages sent to Sam's phone. Dean doesn't offer an explanation, and thankfully Sam chooses not to ask.
Rowena explains how her father purchased the property back in the '70s after the two emigrated from Scotland with dreams of opening a seaside bookstore (he wasn't rich enough to purchase along the seawall, she elaborates, but this location offered more tourists looking to shop). Mr. MacLeod ran with the nautical theme, featuring books mostly on boats, the beach, sea life, etc. However, this didn't exactly incite a booming business, so they had slowly expanded to include travel books, fiction novels, self-help... The business was badly damaged during Hurricane Ike in 2008, and sales were slow to recover ever since. Mr. MacLeod passed away a few years ago, leaving Rowena to suddenly inherit the place.
Castiel thinks he might enjoy going backstage at a fashion show. “I'd like to come... if that's okay? They let random people behind the scenes?” That would never fly at the firm; it sounds like a security nightmare.
,” Gabriel reminds, discarding the bottles into the garbage. “You're supposed to be taking care of yourself, baby bro. Not damaging your liver.”
Those breathy moans make it extremely difficult for Dean to spend time moving elsewhere, but he eventually pries himself off of Cas, grabbing the angel's wrist and dragging him down the hall towards his bedroom. Well, it's not so much dragging as it is leading, since Cas proves just as eager as Dean.  He shoves Dean against the wall next to the bedroom door.
Hadn't Cas just agreed the sex was great, and now... he was regretting it? He supposes technically Cas had said
“Yeah, but...” Gabe whistles. “If what you've been texting is true, you've had what, next to nothing since moving here? I don't think you've had this much alcohol at once since... Hell, since you and Balthazar ended years ago!”
“I hope you like tea,” comes Rowena's voice from across the room where the living area extends to a cozy kitchenette. “It's all I have.”
Singer Auto is only a twenty-minute drive, probably less during non-holiday hours. The shop is easy to find, set back just off the main road. From looks alone, Castiel would have never come here; the place is rundown and dingy, with broken cars and parts scattered across what appears to be a salvage yard. However, Rowena's good word spurs him forward, though he remains somewhat apprehensive as he pulls up in front of the main shop. Further back, behind more cars, sits a small house, and Castiel wonders if Mr. Singer lives there.
Their food is ready sooner than Castiel expected, and Dean leaves and returns with a huge tray of food. Although the music and noise from the other customers bothers him at first, Castiel learns to tune it out in favor of Dean's smooth vocal cords.
Weaving their way around to the back of the store and still finding no one, Castiel starts to suspect his new coworker to be an unreliable type. They'd phoned ahead, letting her know they would arrive soon, but the woman is nowhere to be found. At the very back of the shop is a secondhand section, along with a few chairs and a couch.
Sam is out for his morning run, and Dean is making breakfast, skillfully flipping pancakes over the griddle when Cas finally shows his face again. It's been a few days since his last appearance, unusual since he's been dropping in more often than not lately, but he isn't harried or injured, so Dean doesn't wait for an explanation.
“Dean, I...” Castiel creeps closer, emboldened when Dean stays put. “I just wanted to apologize. You were right; I didn't stop to think or ask what you wanted out of our relationship. I was selfish and narrow-minded, seeing only one outcome.” He stares at the patterns on the floor, but he feels the weight of Dean's gaze. “And I didn't mean to say what I did...
“Dean,” he exclaims, surprised by the sudden appearance of the very man he's been trying to avoid all night. “I, erm, didn't think anyone would be up here.”
Castiel wonders if he is intruding on Rowena's private rooms, but then he remembers Dean probably lives here, too, and the thought is both comforting and sour. Reluctantly, he climbs the stairs to the third floor.
, but that sort of life... it's just not for me. I got into modeling for the money, and now that Sam's practically done with school and my debt's almost paid off... I want out. I love working on cars, and I'm really good at fixing them up. I want to work and earn my way, not mooch off you.”
He doesn't understand why he's in such a... mood. The store is looking better and better, and they even had a slight uptick in customers over the last few days. Castiel hasn't yelled at or fired anyone, so he's confused as to why he's constantly developing a headache.
“You leave Rowena out of this,” Dean's voice responds, Castiel's heart soaring, and he can just make out the shapes of three people in a secluded corner.
The sound of cheers and hurrahs reach their ears, and the fireworks are exploding one after another, signaling the start of a brand new year.
Dean hands off the still-attacking cat to Rowena, earning a few scratches of his own, and then Dean's at his side, checking over Castiel with worry. “Shit, he got you pretty good,” he says, examining Castiel's chest that is covered in red, angry marks. “I don't think you'll need stitches, but two of these could use a bandaid.”
“Is that what Rowena does?” he asks, speculating if that's why she always volunteered. It would be a nice chance for her to visit old friends or favorite places.
Dean takes a few paper towels, tentatively reaching for Castiel's chest. Between the two of them, they pat Castiel dry soon enough, although he still feels a bit sticky. Dean's hand lingers at his waist, towel rubbing skin that already dried.
“So...” Dean says, eager to change the subject at this point. “What brought you all the way to Galveston from... Illinois, was it?”
was the one to assault her. It was a lengthy and hard process for Dean, who had next to no one on his side. The only thing that saved him was the lack of proof; there were no fingerprints aside from her own on the weapons, and security footage of their apartment revealed nothing. Dean could only guess Amara had wiped the tape of her attack, but she couldn't fake video of Dean attacking her. The case eventually settled, with Dean paying thousands of dollars in legal fees and contract rewrites. He didn't have enough on Amara to get a restraining order, so he dropped off the New York modeling grid and moved down to Galveston with his uncle, working off the debt and Sam's remaining tuition.
Castiel can make a cup of coffee; he's been doing it for the last twenty-something years. What he cannot seem to do, however, is make a latte, or anything other than black.
Castiel's thumbs smooth over Dean's collarbone, and he unwillingly pulls back with a final nibble on Dean's ear. The man looks completely and utterly
“Sam can polish off an entire plate of shrimp kisses. One of the few non-salad foods he will wolf down. Kid drags me here every time he visits,” Dean says fondly.
? I don't fall in love; I don't do relationships. People don't want that with me. Dean knows I'm not here forever, so he understands this can't go anywhere. Which means that he, like everyone else, just wants their fill and then they'll move on.”
“Lucky for me you're here, then,” he replies, wetting his dry lips in anticipation. Dean's eyes track the movement, and Castiel leans in, nothing weighing his conscious down now.
Castiel is pulled into a warm embrace, Dean's arms a stronghold around him, never wanting to let go again. He sighs into the hold, hands grasping at the material of Dean's sweater. God, he missed this. He buries his face into Dean's neck, inhaling the man's scent and the smell of facial products (and oh, how he can't wait to wipe it all off and see Dean's freckles again). His own neck is wet with tears Dean can't control, clinging to Castiel with such ferocity that he revels in it. Dean loves him, too.
. She's sorting through the latest mass estate purchase, deciding which to keep for the secondhand shelves and which will be donated. “First edition!” she squeals, setting it aside. “Ninnies, the both of you! Just take the boy out on a date.”
They sample all of Galveston's eateries, occasionally returning to The Spot or another one they prefer, but generally, they try a new place every week. They explore museums and visit Moody Mansion, Castiel marveling at the architecture while Dean snorts at the frivolity of the rich. And if he lies and claims the housekeeper is working late to clean the house so they can't head there after... Dean will never know, simply accepting it and inviting Castiel to watch another movie on his couch instead.
understand why it's necessary. He'll never admit it to Gabriel's face, but he's glad Gabe is the brother he's closest to, can't think of anyone better.
It's not exactly easy, a conscious effort on his part, but Castiel manages to keep his distance all the way until December. He catches a glimpse of the man every now and then; it would be impossible not to. Whenever he does see Dean, he's covered in grease and ripped flannel, wrapped as unappetizingly as the first time they'd met. Unfortunately (or fortunately, if Castiel is a masochist), Dean's current state does nothing to deter his mind from providing fresh memories of Dean in his suit, reminding Castiel of what's hidden beneath the grime. When Mrs. Butters begins questioning his long showers in the morning, Castiel takes to rubbing the fantasies out at night when he's alone, not wanting to get caught by his innocent and unassuming housekeeper.
There's a loud rumble outside, Rowena muttering about 'that infernal car,' and Castiel really hopes that means Dean is here.
Dean gapes at Castiel for another moment, before he dissolves into laughter. “Oh my God,” he chokes, slapping his knee. “Cas, what the fuck?”
“Baby bro, you don't even realize how much Dean-o has affected you, huh?” Gabe leans forward with his elbows on the table. “You look happier than I've ever seen. You're more relaxed, the lines are fading from your forehead. From what you've told me, you're trying new foods you used to avoid. You're going out and having
“So, Dean, who's your new, more polished friend?” she purrs, a light lilt to her words. “Where's the stuffy redhead?”
Cassie, you haven't picked up a book for pleasure reading since... well, for as long as I can remember, since we were children at the least.” Gabe smirks. “You're an actual
Castiel wiggles beneath the unfamiliar sheets, sighing loudly. As much as it pains him to be away from the office and miss an entire year at the firm, he
“Hi there,” Dean flashes a flirty smile at the concierge. “I need to check in. Reservation for Smith.”
He's chosen dark pinstripe pants with black shoes for the evening, paired with his deep gray shirt and black jacket. Underneath the blazer, he has a black waistcoat (too much black is never a negative, in Castiel's opinion). A red tie completes the look for just a flash of color. Rowena had nodded approvingly upon opening the door for him, while Meg animatedly licked her lips.
Because Castiel wants to take Dean with him. That weekend in Houston proved Dean could fit seamlessly into Castiel's lifestyle, and he intends to take Dean back with him to Chicago in October. It will take some effort; Dean has shown he isn't easily won over. But if they can make this relationship work, Castiel has no doubt in his mind Dean will follow him home.
. The two women here should have joined them an hour ago, having closed the shop early, but Rowena is waiting to see off Dean, and Meg is just admiring the view. Castiel would have preferred Dean pick him up from his house, but Rowena demanded Castiel uber to the store so that she could have final approval on his wardrobe. As if Castiel doesn't dress better than every islander combined.
“It was no trouble at all,” he lies, thinking of the hours he spent on Google. But really, that doesn't matter. Dean is unimpressed, and Castiel simply won't have that.
Dean rolls his eyes, returning to Cas's original question. “It's sirloin steak with garlic butter and roasted potatoes, obviously. You sticking around for dinner today?”
Now that Castiel knows Dean and Rowena have some sort of relationship, he predicts it's only a matter of time before they run into each other again.
This year, Castiel will have to miss out on the big event, but he won't be stuck at home. MacLeod's is hosting a get-together for staff and regulars and friends, and Rowena basically threatened to drag his ass there herself if he didn't show.
“Or what, you'll attack me again?” the woman laughs, cold and chilling, and this must be Amara, Dean's ex-girlfriend. “That didn't work out so well the first time, did it?”
Humming, Castiel looks up directions. He's pretty sure Discount would check the tires for free, but he's also overdue for an oil change... and since when has he been pressed for funds?
on his computer. Dean has only just tugged out his earbuds and grinned knowingly at the angel before Cas plants a gentle hand down onto Dean's laptop screen, closing the device. Raising his other hand into Dean's personal bubble, he forces the hunter to lean instinctively back. “There's my bae,” Cas all but croons. Then he boops
Over half an hour later, Castiel is back on the road thanks to the help of a good samaritan. He's not exactly late, not yet, but he's pushing it. His clothes, however, emerged from the tire change worse for wear. When he pulls off the freeway for gas, he stuffs the grease-stained clothes into the trunk and throws on hastily-grabbed things from his duffel, a pair of lounge pants, a tee, and a maroon hoodie. He doesn't have enough time to change again, although he has a feeling he'll regret showing up to a fashion show in sweats.
Cas says nothing else for a while, and Dean is too embarrassed to meet his eyes so he just keeps his gaze focused on the rumpled bedsheets.
“He doesn't hate wealth, but there are people in Dean's past who've hurt him, and he associates money with them. One person, really, his ex-girlfriend, a woman named Amara.”
“I told you about my ex. It's just... Seeing her frequently at these events gets to me. I know it sounds stupid and unprofessional, but... I'm at the end of my rope, Cas. Especially without a restraining order, she bothers me incessantly.”
And isn't that typical of Castiel, considering Dean's feelings before his own. It's actually rather sweet, but Dean fights back his blush. It won't do to falter now.
They don't get out of bed until Dean finally drags himself to the bathroom for a nature call the following morning. He brushes his teeth and combs his hair, freshening up a bit before returning to his bedroom. Cas has actually managed to fall asleep, and although Dean wants to joke about the angel being worn-out from their after-hour activities, it's more likely Cas
They drive up the interstate and into Houston. Dean informs him that tonight's function is merely a dinner, and tomorrow Dean will be working, but Castiel will have entry to the event, although he's more than welcome to explore the city if he chooses.
“I see you've met Fergus,” Rowena introduces, gesturing for Castiel to take a seat on the chair. She places two colorful mugs of steaming tea on the small table and settles in beside the cat. “Fergus Roderick MacLeod. He doesn't take kindly to strangers.”
. A good chunk of the audience must agree, for Castiel hears several gasps, and a few women even swear.
“Yeah... and?” Dean doesn't even care, does he? The boats on the ocean begin to shoot off fireworks, and midnight must be fast approaching, but Castiel can't even enjoy it.
Turning his head marginally, Dean finds Cas staring intently at the pan of herring. If the angel wasn't resting his chin against Dean, he imagines Cas would have his head cocked in that adorably befuddled manner.
“Excuse me?” Castiel is at a loss. His car is very valuable, new, and has all the latest features, but Dean's acting as if he drives one of the hunks of junk from the salvage yard.
! You seriously think that wasn't the truth? Do you really think he wants you checking in on him so often?” As Castiel tiptoes closer, the figures come into view. Dean has his back against the wall facing down Amara and another, a tall, dark-haired man. Amara is sultry and gorgeous, and Castiel suddenly remembers why her name sounded familiar: the story made national headlines, Victoria's Secret model abused by boyfriend. Castiel never read those sorts of pieces, so he hadn't known Dean was the accused. It's no wonder Dean was so hesitant to share his past; the majority of the press and people alike had been on Amara's side.
The girl whistles. “Wow, you have it bad.” Which only ticks Dean off further. He yanks her ponytail.
Grumbling nonsense, Castiel lays his head against the cool table. “What are you even doing here?” he asks, vaguely recalling what day of the week it is. “You don't fly in until Friday.”
So Castiel takes the rest of the afternoon off and returns home, staring down the looming bookcase. He doesn't have to read them all today, just start with one and work from there... His fingers trace the spine of
told him, but in the mess of this week, Castiel had forgotten. “Erm. You two have fun,” he says, even though he has no idea where they're going and tells himself he's not interested.
Dean's laughter is gradually fading into small chortles. “Hell no, Cas! Ro is great, don't get me wrong, but she's not really my type. And I'm pretty sure if we were rooming together, Crowley would have already killed me in my sleep.”
Dean hoots with laughter. “Nah, Sam's my brother. He was here all winter break when I first moved. Sam's a huge nerd, loves books, that's how we met Rowena. Those two really hit it off, and when he went back to California after the new year, Ro and I kept talking. Didn't anticipate becoming best friends with a crazy plant lady, but she's pretty awesome.”
Slumped over in said couch, is a man who apparently decided a private business is a good place to nap.
The man stares, then barks out a laugh. “Riiiight. Follow me.” He strides on bowed legs from the secondhand section back into the main part of the store, Gabe giggling after him and Castiel struggling to reclaim the situation.
They take walks along the beach, Castiel with his shoes on and Dean carrying his in hand as his toes bury themselves in the warm sand. Dean rolls up his pants and wades through the water, picking at the shells until he finds a smooth piece of sea glass and tucks it into Castiel's pocket with an adoring smile. Castiel gives in, taking off his own shoes and socks, allowing the cloudy water to wash over his feet. It's completely revolting, but entirely worth it when Dean's entire face lights up with affection, tackling Castiel into the surf and completely soaking them both. He's mad for all of three seconds, when Dean's thumb curls against his cheek and he kisses the pout off Castiel's lips, tasting of salt and soda.
The kindness in that question breaks the pieces Dean has been holding together, and they come out in one hushed, quick breath.
outfit. He's silent and staring for too long though, and the man clenches his jaw. “I see,” is all he says, and Castiel feels an ounce of guilt for his blatant judgment.
Mrs. Butters arrives just before ten o'clock, and she usually finds Castiel fresh out of the shower after completing his morning run. Jogging is one part of his new schedule that Castiel is completely on board with. He used to run in college, but that had stopped soon after working for the firm. Occasionally, Castiel had made it to the company gym, but he detests working out in front of others, not exactly being a social body. But this? Jogging up and down the streets, or running along the seawall and feeling the ocean breeze on his arms? Further points in Gabriel's favor.
“Whoa.” Castiel glances over his shoulder to see Dean's eyes wide with childlike wonder. “Your housekeeper is the pancake lady!?”
“This may be the secondhand corner,” he snarks, eyeing the man with complete disdain, “but you're still not allowed to desecrate the written word.”
“Best spot for looking at the fireworks,” Dean informs, pointing at the little dots on the waves, boats where the city will shoot off the rockets. “Everyone's probably heading to the seawall right about now, but this is the place to be.”
Rowena clearly worked hard to get where she'd been; how did she just abandon it all to come run a failing bookstore left to her by her father? Castiel can't comprehend it. He'd been forced into a year of 'taking it easy' by his doctor and Gabriel, and he'd nearly had an aneurism leaving Chicago. He can't imagine giving up his lifestyle permanently, to come do something as mediocre as
Castiel doesn't make a habit of listening to people's life stories; he finds such things pointless. He wonders if he does so now because he has nothing better to do, or if the old woman is actually growing on him.
“Ok,” Carmen said, grabbing his hand and pulling him up. “You’re changing your pants and we’re going to the hospital.”
He leaned the bike against the wall in the locker room. Ash sat in the corner beside the coffee machine.
Dean grinned and nodded. He had an urge to give Cas a big hug, but didn’t think he’d appreciate all the dirt and sweat.
He wanted her to go, to stop touching him, but he didn’t want to be mean to her either. “I don’t want it though,” he said.
He looked uncomfortable, probably wondering what kind of dumbasses didn’t have even the most basic health insurance. It wasn’t their fault they made too much money to be on Medicaid but not enough to afford private health insurance. They weren’t going to choose paying for health insurance over paying their phone and cable bills or buying groceries and gas. “Oh, uh, well that’s not my area, so I’ll have someone from billing come see you,” he said before he and the nurse made a quick exit.
Dean even talked about it with Mia, something he’d never imagined talking about to another soul, and she had some suggestions for staying in the moment with Cas and not flashing back. He thought her suggestion of both of them talking through everything face to face while Cas was fucking him would be a huge turn-off, but the opposite turned out to be true.
Dean could ordinarily inhale half a pizza in a matter of minutes, but the pungent meat and cheese smells and the sight of all of it only caused him to wrinkle his nose in disgust. “No thank you,” he said. The TV was on a baseball game, but the images seemed blurred, the sound distorted and blaring.
They took their clothes off again and snuggled in the blankets in a way Dean had never done with anyone. Sure, he and Carmen hugged and had sex and fell asleep in each others’ arms on occasion, usually when she got wasted enough to loosen up, but being pressed naked, face to toes, this long with another person and not having sex was new for Dean. He started to talk. Talking like this was new too.
Dean doesn't know what he expected would happen after enacting upon this rather ridiculous plan, which constituted of nothing more than
, they're an improvement upon his trademark scuffed boots. Black slacks hug his thighs and hips nicely, the material pressed and crisp. He's wearing a dark blazer over a white button-down shirt and–Cas's throat dries–a charcoal pinstripe waistcoat. The top buttons of his shirt are undone, drawing Castiel's eyes again to the smooth expanse of Dean's throat. His face is scruff-free, skin clean of all dirt and grease, and Castiel thinks his jaw might have landed somewhere on the floor.
The following day is a whirlwind of activity that leaves Castiel exhausted, even though he hardly does anything.
Dean grins. “Well then, come on up!” Fergus screeches unpleasantly, but Dean merely picks him up and disappears back up the stairs. “Get up here, Cas!”
of energy spikes through Castiel when he molds his mouth to Dean's. The man's lips are just as soft as they look, pliant and plump under Castiel's own slightly chapped ones. Dean lets out a little hum of contentment, angling his head to deepen the kiss. Castiel shifts in his seat, needing to be closer, and his hands wander into Dean's hair, tugging his face nearer. Dean sighs into it, his own fingers latching onto Castiel's jacket, and Castiel fluidly slides from his chair straight into Dean's lap. Dean gasps in surprise, but Castiel takes advantage of the moment, slipping his tongue past Dean's parted lips and licking his way inside. Dean quickly gets with the program, tongue eagerly pressing against Castiel's. Castiel curls his fingers around Dean's hair tightly, eliciting a moan, and he uses his grip to tilt Dean's head back, breaking the kiss and trailing his mouth down to Dean's bare throat where he sucks the skin between his teeth.
If Castiel thought Dean was hot before, that first suit has met its match. The forest green of his jacket brings out the color in Dean's eyes, and Castiel forgoes politeness in favor of ogling. Dean's wearing a pale blue shirt and a navy printed tie finished off with dark pants and brown shoes. Actually, Castiel muses, the suit by itself isn't that interesting, and considerably cheaper than his own, but it's completely transformed by the man wearing it.
“'Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast,'” Dean quotes, pitching his voice lower to match Castiel's gravel.
“I'll be gone before you wake,” Gabe reminds him as they shuffle into their pajamas. Castiel's are navy with buttons, while Gabriel's boxers and shirt are bright yellow and pink and dotted with mini donuts. “And you better not wake up, you hear me? You need to sleep in. Dr. Alder said you need at
isn't hot. Thankfully, Sam doesn't notice, sitting at the table and poking at the suspicious omelet his brother had scrounged up, although he does peer at the angel with concern.
Castiel opens the door for him. “I read it's very nice. I have reservations at the bar on the roof.” Dean's eyebrows go up, but he follows Castiel to the elevators. They are seated quickly, and Dean stares at his menu questionably. Castiel can agree the place doesn't offer a wide selection of food, but they have enough, and the dimly lit atmosphere of the rooftop is pleasant.
“Dude, I haven't seen you in weeks, since you called in sick,” Dean says, sliding down to sit properly on the stairs. “Did you catch the flu or something?”
“Actually we flew,” Gabe explains, eagerly accepting his cup of tea before shoving two cookies into his mouth. “Shipped all of Cassie's things down to Houston first, then flew in, rented a few cars–well,
Castiel retreats to the kitchen, trusting Gabe to let himself in. Mercifully, there's some Aleve in one of the drawers, and Castiel downs two with a tall glass of water.
She nods. “I thought about selling completely, but...” She gives a small shrug. “It's all I have left of him. I wish to hang on to it a little longer.”
“Cas?” Charlie asked with a frown on her face, “I don’t know anyone called Cas, and I know most people in this school.”
A biromantic, asexual person is romantically attracted to people of multiple genders, but experiences little to no sexual attraction.
“Hey Cas, Do you want to come to Benny’s party tonight?” They got pulled out of their thoughts as Dean kicked their feet from the other side of the table.
They had started dating his brother in college when Sam was only seven and they and Dean had practically raised him after his father died in a car accident when he was nine, seven years before.
There were many advantages to people now knowing about Cas and Dean, as well as knowing Cas is Sam’s sibling.
"Hey," Dean said reassuringly, leaning against the counter, "it's fine, my parents totally understand, you know they love you both like their own children."
Lisa shrugged, "I guess we could ask if they like anyone on staff? Say we are trying to figure out if the English department all get along? I don’t know, just think of something."
Dean sighed as he left the house, he didn't mean to be snappy with Sam but it hurt that he wouldn't trust him, didn't believe he was telling the truth, didn't believe Cas was real.
"Thanks Mum." He thanked her while pulling out his phone, pulling up his group chat with Cas and Gabe.
They quickly strode over for a hug before heading back to the shelf they'd been restocking as Dean walked in.
They were finally able to detangle themself from Deans grabbing hands and walked out his room, “Bye Dean, sleep well,” They whispered softly as they left.
They didn’t grow up in a loving household, they didn’t grow up in an accepting household, they thought it was normal until Dean came along and loved them so viciously they saw real love for the first time.
Cas places his knife and fork neatly on his plate. "I'm married, why would I take anyone except Dean out on a date?"
They hid the fact that they weren’t a dude. They hid the fact that although they didn’t mind he/him pronouns, they didn’t make them happy in the same way they/them did. He/him just wasn't, it wasn’t quite them. They hid behind exaggerated gender norms and a fake macho man persona.
Dean just smiled, “Come on, the back garden is usually quieter, it's also where the cool kids hang out,” The wink at the end led Cas to decide Dean meant himself by the cool kids. They snorted at him before setting off through the battlefield that was the sitting room.
He walked through the house, spotting his mum in the sitting room, "how were they?" Mary asked without any pleasantries.
It didn’t take too much coaxing to get Dean from the party to his dorm room, the real problem was leaving again, Dean was apparently a clingy drunk.
“I. Didn’t. Lie.” Dean gritted out between clenched teeth. “They are real. It’s not their fault they had to cancel, they have a life as well.”
No, they didn’t have time to stare at the man sitting opposite them, they needed to work on their paper. They dragged their eyes away from Dean and forced themself to continue writing.
They always found that hard, to see young children growing up with happy lives. Don’t take it the wrong way, they were very happy for the children, they were just sad.
Of course, the best part of everyone now knowing Cas had a husband, was the lack of whispering from the seats in front of him in english.
"Wait, go back, I'm confused." He admitted, "Cas isn't a girl," Gabriel shook his head, "and he isn't a boy."
“And yet her life never seems to line up with ours, you sure she isn’t just dating you for a laugh, she never makes time for you.” He knew he had gone too far, even before Dean slammed his brakes on, pulling the impala to a stop at the side of the road.
Pulling out their phone they considered not for the first time whether cancelling would be better. Dean would be disappointed but wouldn’t he be more disappointed if they embarrassed him in front of everyone at the party?
Sam thought he should groan and make a fuss at the sheer amount of fluff going on round this table, but he was much happier with the image of Dean and his spouse being sappy then the mental image he'd been hot with earlier of Cas and Zachariah on a date.
"He doesn't." Dean said with a sigh. "Cas isn't his sister, they're his sibling. His sibling who is late?" He directed his question toward Gabriel.
This time Marve started, "Professor, do you know Professor Hanscum?" She asked, a seemingly innocent expression on her face.
"Cas' brother, you know, the one who's shift they were covering today?" Dean knew he had mentioned Gabriel before, Sammy just never seemed to listen.
They snorted slightly, “I tried to tell him before, before I knew it had a name, but back when I just knew I wasn’t a guy. He didn’t want to hear it, he just told me liking womanly stuff didn’t make me less of a man and wouldn’t listen to what I was trying to tell him.”
“Hey Babe, hey no it's ok. They’ll understand.” Dean walked over, his phone pressed against his ear, a fond smile on his face, “You go help your brother, we can just rearrange. Bye. Love you.”
Dean smiled happily from his perch on the porch at the sight of his partner and brother laughing together. After a rather messy beginning they had really hit it off, they were both such nerds.
Sam was once again pulled away from his phone by Dean coming back down stairs, "I'm off," he said, throwing on a coat as he reached the door.
He slowly walked to the car, digging the car keys out of his bag so he could open the car and wait in there for Cas to finish up and join him.
It wasn’t brought up again for a while, Dean was still trying to process the new names he suddenly had for the parts of them they always thought were broken, they were still trying to process the fact they apparently weren’t broken at all. Cas was content to let them have all the time they needed to get their head round their identity, but always made sure they knew they weren’t alone.
There was the added bonus that Zachariah couldn’t harass Cas after school, as Sam would be there as a witness and Professor Alder wasn’t quite dumn enough to insult Cas right next to one of the students. He still could at lunch or break, but there were more students around then and so Cas had a much more enjoyable time at school, not being harassed half as much.
"He was wearing a pin that said ‘fuck your pronouns’," Cas replied with a grimace. "He even came into my classroom to show it off."
Dean shook his head, he really hated their parents, "of course. I'll check with my parents but you know they always have time for you, we are having a barbecue next Saturday, Gabe should be ungrounded by then right?"
He flinched as he got clipped around the head by his Dad, “He don’t be mean, you don't know the full story.”
Sam nearly snapped the ruler he was putting in his pencil case he was gripping it so hard. He hated the image that was just planted in his mind of his sibling on a date with Zachariah Alder. It was disturbing.
Dean made a notice of protest about being called an idiot but was smiling, happy to see two of the most important people in his life getting along.
Sam rolled his eyes, hiding a smile behind his reply, he could see the students in the room looking between them trying to figure out how they knew each other.
Cas sat up straighter, pulling out of Dean's embrace slightly. Dean let out a grunt of annoyance at losing his personal heater. "If I told them I was married. They'd want to know all about my husband. And they would eventually figure out his surname and they would ask about why you share a surname. I didn't want you to feel uncomfortable or have to tell the other students you're my brother." Cas looked over at him seriously, face alight with passion. "I wouldn't do that to you without asking first."
Cas sighed as they resigned themself to write their paper. No more procrastinating. I’ve got to get this done today. Their paper didn’t actually have to be handed in for another week but they knew if they put it off for any longer it would get buried underneath all their other work and then they would never get it done.
Dean was his brother. Did he not trust him? Was he that untrustworthy? They always told each other everything. Why didn’t Dean trust him with this?
He still didn't know how he managed to meet such a perfect partner, and he still had to pinch himself everyday that they liked him, not regardless of his flaws, but because of them.
Shaking his head he dragged himself out of his musing, grabbing his book out his locker, “I’ll see you guys later, I have to get to chemistry.”
Now eighteen he lived in a small house with Dean and Cas, studying at the local college. Dean, now twenty eight, was an engineer and Cas was an English teacher at Sam's college.
Sam could see the obvious love his brother held for this person and felt bad for thinking Dean had made them up.
“Take that back or get out.” He hissed. “They have a hard life. Harder than you can understand. They don’t have the freedom you have always had. It’s not my place to say, not my place to explain. I love them and they love me. So live with that or move on.”
After the career fair Sam had a five minute break before his English class. It had already been decided Dean would wait a few more minutes before coming in to reveal himself.
There were a few mumbled answers, a few yesses, a few nos and a whole lot of indistinguishable groaning.
"I'm non binary." Cas stated calmly. "I don't identify fully as a boy, or a girl, I'm just me." They looked down at the ground, "I'm sorry."
The last thing they were expecting was Dean to come flying from the other side of the table and to tackle them into a big hug. “Im sorry Cas, I’m so sorry, please know they are wrong, every part of you is valid and it's their fault they don’t get to see the wonderful person you are, because of their own lack of information.”
“So we do,” Cas smiled slightly at Dean, “I hope your parents were more accepting than mine.” At Dean’s wince Cas realised they may have overstepped, “Sorry, I’m not known for my social skills, we can talk about something else,” Stupid, why would Dean want to talk to them at all, “or nothing at all, if you don’t want. You came here to work” They were rambling, “I should let you work,” They finished quickly, trailing off at the end.
Amara cleared her throat and then said, “Well, I...uh...guess I should get going.” She started to leave and then turned at the kitchen doorway, twirling her hair. “If you change your mind, Dean, just…” She left the sentence unfinished and turned to leave.
“There was this electricity between us the moment we met, wasn’t there?” Cas asked, raising his own hand to Dean’s face and mirroring Dean’s movements.
The noise stopped and Carmen emerged from the bathroom, opening the door without a sound and gathering her things with great care.
“I think we have some apples,” Cas said, his smile brightening. “Would you like one? They’re fairly round.”
Once Benny was out of sight, Amara slipped her hands into the soapy water over Dean’s. “Here, let me help you with that,” she whispered, entwining her fingers with Dean’s.
“My bicycle,” Cas said calmly, as if speaking to a distressed child. “Today is my day off. You can ride it to work. It’s not far, is it?”
Despite the ache in his jaw, Dean was relieved it was out in the open. “I’m sorry, Carmen. And I’m sorry to Amara too,” he said in all sincerity. “Where are you staying?”
“Wow,” Dean said, trying to imagine a reality where he wasn’t afraid to confront his past. His life felt now as if it were divided into before cracking his head open, and after that. In the before, he’d used booze, weed, sex, and Baby to avoid thinking about any of the crap he’d been through, but in the after he felt both better and worse. Everything seemed suffused with light now; it was like he was already starting to know what it felt like to“see the beauty in everything,” as Cas had said. But like he’d told Cas before, it was like all the darkness he’d been shoving down his whole life was right around the corner, and it scared him. He didn’t know what would happen when he ran into it.
She gasped, clutching at her chest in shock when she looked up and saw him lurking in the dark, watching her through the glass. When she recognized him, her scared face morphed into a coy smile and she ended her call and unlocked the door for him.
Dean studied Cas for a bit, and Cas didn’t look away. “You must have had a weird upbringing, the way you talk,” he said. “You don’t sound like a regular kid.”
They cleaned up and got dressed, and Cas prepared a feast of round vegetables and fruits for Dean: peas, radishes, cherry tomatoes, blueberries, an orange, and of course, a beet. Dean felt a pang of guilt, thinking of how Carmen had bought anything round she could think of. Cas offered to cook some of it, but Dean said he only wanted to eat them raw. Cas made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for himself and watched Dean work through all the colorful spheres on his plate.
The next morning, Carmen sat Dean at the table and wrapped a comforter around his shoulders as if he were sick. She plunked a plate of eggs, hash browns, sausage in front of him and said, “Eat.” Dean eyed the plate with distaste.
She finally said, “Well I don’t know what to do about him anymore,” and her anger seemed replaced with sadness. Dean knew he should feel bad. He knew he hadn’t been giving Carmen a lot to work with lately. But he also didn’t really feel bad about anything. He felt more calm, more himself, than he ever had.
“Dean,” she said, placing a hand on his arm even though Benny was right there. “Your wife is having a meltdown in the bathroom.”
Cas retreated into the house and came back out with a bowl filled with three shiny red apples. The sweet juiciness flooded Dean’s mouth when he took his first bite. Cas set the bowl down on the step and sat beside it, watching as Dean worked his way through all three apples and left the decimated cores in the bowl. After he’d swallowed the final bite, Dean looked Cas in the eye and said, “Thank you.”
“I’m gonna fuck you now, Dean,” Cas rasped in his ear and then removed his fingers. Dean listened to him opening the condom packet, and a few moments later, he pressed the tip of his slick cock in, guiding himself with one hand while gripping Dean’s hip with the other.
Dean let his mind drift, his eyes getting heavier. He wondered idly if he should stub out his cigarette before he fell asleep and set the whole house on fire, burning himself up just like his mom. He felt leaden with sadness. Cas appeared above him, a look of concern in those otherworldly eyes. “I wish I could help you,” he said with aching sincerity.
He almost asked if any of them could give him a loan, but he knew none of them had that kind of money. He only knew one person who did.
He worked up his courage and walked into the office to find Meg standing over Crowley’s desk, messing with some papers. The boss wasn’t there. Meg hung out with the crew sometimes, but she was basically a bitch and dressed the part, with her tight black jeans, pyramid stud belt and tight Slayer t-shirt. He didn’t know if Crowley was fucking her or what, but he couldn’t have hired her for her cheery receptionist demeanor. “Whadaya want?” she greeted without looking up from whatever she was doing.
Hannah grabbed a kidney-shaped bowl from a nearby shelf and shoved it under Dean’s chin just in time for him to throw up into it. Carmen was beside him now awkwardly rubbing his back. He didn’t think he could stay conscious much longer.
Dean thought of what that would be like, his mother still being alive but turning her back on him. “Sorry man,” was all he could offer.
“How’re you ladies doing?” Dean asked, realizing Cas was going to stay silent. He’d relaxed a bit once he saw that neither of them were primed to claw his or Cas’s eyes out. They seemed...happy.
“He just got off an ashram,” Dean explained. “I mean, he’s like, remember when they found that little person out in the woods?” he asked. “Wolf boy?”
Dean looked off to where the sun was starting to sink low on the horizon. He thought for a moment of how to explain what was in his head. “I don’t know,” he said. “Everything’s so weird lately, like my head is filled with light, you know? Like nothing matters, but in a cool way, not in a depressing way.” That was the best way he could explain what was going on with him.He touched the still-healing scar on his forehead. Carmen had pulled the stitches out with a tweezer the night before and it felt good to have it uncovered.
Dean put his dick away but started to laugh harder. He stumbled back to the nest and lay down, his laughter settling down to a few chuckles. Cas sat beside him looking confused. “Even piss looks beautiful on this shit,” Dean explained, and Cas smiled.
“Well, I don’t know, cher,” Benny placated Carmen, “but I think she’ll come around.” He patted her hand and then looked at Dean. “What is that?” he asked, looking at the beet.
He thought about how to answer because he didn’t know. Everything else just didn’t seem like food. He told Cas as much. “And I just don’t feel hungry,” he added with a shrug.
Sam’s mouth did some more anxious contortions. “I’m just trying to wrap my head around him being Carmen’s twenty-year-old brother and being with you now. You gotta admit it’s strange, Dean.” Sam had never known Carmen well, so Dean didn’t think he could be that upset about them splitting up.
“Why?” she asked, as if she really couldn’t understand what was going on with him. She knew what the car meant to him, but she still didn’t care that Baby was gone.
“Yeah?” Dean said, squinting at Cas as if he’d see him better that way. It seemed like Cas was the only one who saw him lately. Dean smiled into Cas’s benign gaze, and Cas smiled back.
“Just a little bit of blow,” Benny repeated, rolling his own eyes. Unspoken between them was the thought that here they were, just talking, laughing, and getting high, and now they had to deal with these coked-up drama queens.
Sam answered with a panicked, “Dean, are you ok?” Dean cringed at the implication that he would only call if he was in jail or dying.
“People tend to ‘flip out’,” Cas said using actual dorky finger quotes, “if they don’t feel safe or know what to expect. Cas got a dreamy look on his face. “But when they do, the experience can be incredible,” he said. “It’s like I could see the beauty in everything, including myself, and I could let go of a lot of negative energy. I would never have left the ashram if I hadn’t had that experience.”
Dean didn’t feel like he could walk and talk at the same time, so he waited until Cas settled him seated back in the nest to say, “I think I’m ok.”
“I’m very sorry to hear that,” Cas said, lowering the book to the table, his sympathetic eyes meeting Dean’s, which just enraged him more.
The first time Dean opened his eyes, he was blinded by pain. He thought maybe he heard a voice, but the knife through the center of his skull made it impossible to discern what he was hearing or seeing.
They looked at each other in silence for a long time, and that’s how Carmen found them when she got home, staring into each other’s eyes with silly grins on their faces.
Dean rolled his eyes, waiting for whatever stupid thing she had to say. If Amara had coke, that meant she was sharing it with Carmen, and Carmen always got all weird and angry on coke. Because Amara came from money and owned her own business, she always had the expensive drugs.
Dean had no idea how to respond, and didn’t want Carmen to think he was weird for staring, so he turned off the tv, got up, and headed to the bedroom. He hoped Castiel had an air mattress or something because all that was in the spare room that Carmen led him to were Dean’s weights and Carmen’s crafting shit. Now that he thought about it, he realized they’d never had an overnight guest before.
“Mhm…” Dean agreed, closing his eyes and relishing in the warmth radiating back and forth between them through their clothes and skin like mild electric current. Behind his eyelids he saw himself from above, except he was some kind of otherworldly creature growing out of the Earth, his body covered in swirls of many colors. Was he awake or was he asleep? His legs became a long tail covered in iridescent scales of blue and green. His arms became fiery wings. Over and over, streams of color poured out of the top of his head and turned in on themselves like a kaleidoscope. And through it all Dean felt at peace.
“You’re an idiot,” is all Carmen said as he got dressed in his nicest black button-up shirt and his only tie, the one he wore to his dad’s funeral five years ago. He felt a sudden wave of nausea, but gulped it down as he fumbled with the knot.
Since Amara had refused to give him money, Dean hadn’t even thought of asking anyone again. “Maybe,” Dean hedged. He had a lot to think about.
Dean went out on the front porch and kicked the plastic chair there down the steps. Then he picked it up and bashed it on the ground several times, but it was too sturdy to break. Just another symbol of his impotence.
He picks Dean up at seven in front of the auto shop. He wanted to pull all the way up to the house, but Dean said there could be spare car parts around the yard that might destroy his wheels. There's another man standing with Dean when Castiel pulls up; Bobby, he assumes. He rolls down the window to wave at the man while Dean gets in on the other side.
The restaurant they dined at in Houston was even more expensive than this one, so Castiel doesn't understand. But as Dean shifts in his seat, looking self-conscious in his dark jeans and flannel next to Castiel's sleek blazer, he realizes... Dean's uncomfortable.
It ends up being a ten-minute wait for a table, but they're able to get one outside on the balcony looking over the ocean. Castiel peers closer when he notices the fencing on the porch. “Seagulls,” Dean explains.
Cas is quiet after this. His face pales, eyes darting away, but the sheets are being pulled back and Cas is rising from the bed before Dean can finish deciphering the expression. He feels Cas's skin recede from his hold, and Dean sits up anxiously as Cas picks his clothing from the floor.
“Och, that stubborn ass?” Rowena drawls. “He won't come out of his room; Bobby called me and asked if I knew anything, so I came to check in with you. Dean won't come out of that house until he's good and ready, and you looked like you could use a friend.”
Like when Cas arrives at the bunker just in time for movie night.  He settles in between Sam and Dean on the couch with little more than, “Wassup, homies?” Sam merely cocks an eyebrow, but Dean chokes unattractively on his beer.
he's not quite ready to name, he has no idea what to do with them. Past experiences dictate that he should ignore them, sweep everything under the rug and pretend nothing ever happened, chalk up Cas's behavior as little more than an oddity. But that, he knows, would be a disservice to Cas. Castiel doesn't speak without meaning to, he wouldn't yank Dean's chain for kicks. These encounters, however frivolous they may seem, surely have merit to Cas.
Dean was in the kitchen cooking tea, Cas glued to his side, their face buried in his neck. Cas was always clingy, but especially so after a long day of school.
If Cas was real, how come he didn’t know what she looked like, how come he didn’t know how old she was, didn’t even know her eye colour, her eye colour, anything.
Cas wasn’t quite sure when they had caught feelings, and they didn’t know what to do with their feelings now they had found them. They caught themself staring at Dean more than probably acceptable, and sending what their friends called Heart Eyes Dean’s way at the smallest thing.
They didn’t have any lessons together, due to their very different degrees, but they often met in the library, or after a bit in their dorm rooms, to work together, or to just hang out. Sometimes Dean’s friends joined them, to watch a film or play cards. Sometimes Cas’ old school friend would drive the half an hour to visit them and they would play video games.
Just then his phone dinged with a text from his group chat conveniently called “The imaginary girlfriend”
Now that Lisa and Marve had realised Cas did not, in fact, need their help to find a partner, they had moved on to their next victim, who luckily was not married.
Dean, looking confused, turned to Sam for an explanation. "I'm guessing you know what they were asking."
“Wh- what?” Dean didn’t kiss them, but he didn’t pull back either, his eyes were filled with confusion, as if he’d heard them but couldn’t compute their words.
Glancing back down to the table they laughed softly, “It’s not that I don’t want to come out, not really, more I already know they won’t accept me, they’ve had too many conversations around me about how everything about me isn’t valid, about how trans people should go the therapy, how non binary people don’t exist and gender neutral and neo pronouns are too confusing and shouldn’t be used. They even think asexuality is a choice and aromantic people are psychopaths, and it hurts, to hear them discuss what I am, without them realising its me, and to speak so negatively.”
"No, I'm sorry," Sam had to apologise, "I was out of line, both by saying you don't exist and by assuming you were a girl, and then that you were a boy. I should have realised Dean had never called you a girl, I just… never thought it would be anything else."
The lesson flew by and everyone did indeed finish their work before the end of the lesson, leading to Cas letting them all talk for the last 15 minutes of class.
It was only an hour later, and two pages through their paper, when Cas got pulled away from writing by a voice, “Hey is this seat taken?”
It was actually when they were cuddling on the sofa that Dean finally got the courage needed to speak, what could they say, they felt bravest buried in Cas’ arms.
It had all the resources you could need for revision or an essay, the coffee shop in the back corner meant they could get their caffeine fix, and the all hours opening times meant it was the perfect place to pull an all nighter before a paper was due.
Cas took a deep breath in. Here goes nothing. “Did you mean it?” Ducking their head they forced Dean to make eye contact with them. “Did you mean what you said?”
Cas smiled slightly, “I’m glad your mum accepted you.” They dragged their coffee towards them, taking a sip of the now cold drink, they didn’t particularly like cold coffee, but caffeine is caffeine. “I actually,” They stared at the table, not wanting to see Dean’s expression when they told him, “I actually never came out to my family.”
Dean snuggled closer to their chest, “You’re so warm, and nice, and pretty, and handsome, and gorgeous, I really like you.”
Sam didn't even try to stop his momentum as he threw his head into his hands with a slam. "Ugh don't remind me."
Pulling them fully onto his lap, Cas kissed their forehead before responding, “Of course you aren’t broken, you’re you.”
From where Sam sat, he couldn’t quite hear the conversation Dean and Cas were having, but after living with them both for a long time he recognised all their tells. Although Cas was happy it had gone well, and although they had found it funny, they’d had enough of the stares and badly hidden whispers. They were ready to go home and would probably be overly clingy all evening.
Cas always knew, he saw it in their molecules while putting them back together. Saw it in their very being who they were.
“No you don’t,” Dean suddenly said, shooting straight up, nearly falling off their lap, “Not like I wish you did. I love you, but I will only ever be a friend to you.”
“I think, I think you were right.” They whispered, barely loud enough for Cas to hear, “About me not being broken, about me just being slightly different.”
Cas let out a deep sigh and, still sighing, made a big show of plodding over to the table and heavily sitting down in a chair. "I see how it is," they grumbled.
"Great," they said with a smile. "Now I know it's last thing on a Friday but the quicker you finish your work the quicker we can all be home, and I can spend my weekend ignoring you."
Sam could already guess what he was going to say, “Let me guess, Cas very sadly just called last minute to cancel on us. Just like last time, and the time before that.”
Cas, sweet, oblivious, darling Cas, just looked confused. "Why am I taking him out to dinner? Are we having a lunch meeting?"
Gabriel had got an A in Biology, and his parents decided it just wasn't acceptable so he had been grounded until his grades were back up. That left Cas to cover his shifts at the shop.
Cas' answer was cut off by a family of three coming up to buy their shopping, as Cas rang up the shopping Dean made eye contact with the small daughter sitting in the trolley, who was giving him a very wide smile.
Dean didn’t know Cas knew, not for a long while, not until they were dating. After purgatory, they had finally realised Cas might not always be there, and they decided they couldn’t live with that. So they kissed him, made him theirs in the way they were already wholly his, and never looked back.
"They are ok, Gabe's grade slipped to an A so they were covering his shift. Can they both come to the barbecue next Saturday?" He asked, pretty much already knowing the answer.
"You know you don't have to ask," Mary said, shaking her head at him, "they are always welcome here."
Marve scowled, pulling her chair closer to her desk with an earsplitting screech. "Come on, it's Professor Novak, we have to find the perfect person for them. They deserve it."
He walked over to the Impala, leaning against the boot as he waited for Dean to get out of class and drive them home.
That was decided then, they had about half an hour to get ready for one of the biggest conversations of their life, well, it certainly felt that way anyway.
As much as Sam was joking about Dean’s girlfriend being imaginary, he had never met this ‘Cas’ Dean was apparently dating. Dean claimed they had been dating for nearly six months but Sam had never seen head nor tail of her.
Dean groaned. "What did he do this time?" Safe to say, no one in the Winchester/Novak household liked Zachariah Alder.
They waited until everyone had food and was eating, and then decided they had procrastinated enough.
Dean had brought Cas over to introduce them to his friends, his friends who still hadn't fully got over the fact that Cas did, in fact, exist."
“My ‘imaginary girlfriend’?” Dean asks, starting to walk out the door to the impala, “There’s nothing imaginary about them. And yes, they are coming round after school.”
Although, from the way Dean was practically leaning over the desk to be closer to them, he wouldn’t have any complaints. That's just the sort of people they are.
For one, Sam was able to stay in the classroom with Cas while they packed up, instead of having to go to the car to avoid suspicion.
Their stickers weren’t particularly special, spider man with trans flag colours Charlie got them after forcing them to watch every single Spiderman possible -although after the second there wasn’t much forcing left to do- angel wings in the non binary flag colours, a slice of cake with the ace colours, and a dragon wearing a cape of the demi romantic flag.
"But she isn't your sister?" Sam continued. He was confused, he felt like they were trying to tell him something but had no idea what.
Sam took a step back in surprise and looked around, taking another step back at the hostile faces of his family.
Sam didn't really know what they were talking about, but he did know Marve and Lisa had been working together to set up teachers all around the school for weeks. He enjoyed sitting in English and listening to their plotting.
They quietened down for the start of the lesson, and Cas started teaching, only to be interrupted halfway through talking about an extract but professor Hanscum, Jody, coming in to ask them something. Jody was another teacher Sam knew through his siblings. She lived near them and would babysit Sam back when times were rough, so Cas and Dean could both work without worrying about childcare.
“'Excuse me Sir, you’re wrong. There are no electrons. Because I can’t see them.' His science teacher will hate him."
And it was there, from a few feet away he heard Lisa whisper to Marve, "He's kinda hot." They both giggled while Sam tried not to gag.
Sam smiled from where he stood in the doorway. He loved to see his siblings happy. He remembered a time, back when they'd all first started living together when funds were tight and Cas and Dean had been stressed all the time. He had been a bit young to understand all they were doing for him then, and didn't understand why Dean was working so many jobs as well as getting his engineering degree and why Cas was never around to play. But they had made it work, and stayed together, united through it all.
Cas smiled brightly up at him, "it's ok, I know it's a bit hard to wrap your head around at first, let's start again,"
Jo: Idk man, if she exists why did we only start hearing about her a few months ago, why have we never met her before, how come we only learnt her name this morning.
Cas was frozen, Dean was hugging them, they hadn't been hugged in ages, but slowly they returned the hug, pulling him closer and wrapping their arms around his waist. It was nice.
He also didn’t hold much stake in her coming round after school, every time he had tried to meet her in the past something always came up, Dean making excuses for why his girlfriend always cancelled at the last minute.
But one night, while cuddling in bed, Cas finally confronted them. “Why do you hide who you are? You are beautiful, all of you.”
Damn they really had fallen hard, all Dean had to do was look at them and they felt affection unfurl in their chest.
They glanced at the pile of clothes on their bed; jeans, suits, dresses, skirts, clothes in all colours of the spectrum and beyond. They must have something. Anything.
Sam sat down into his seat with a barely concealed grin. He loved pranks, especially when he was involved.
"What do you mean?" Sam was confused why would them telling the class he was married make him uncomfortable?
"I'm so sorry I had to cancel," Cas started, "but we need this money. If Gabe and I ever want to escape to Uni, we need the funds."
The careers fair was finally upon them. Sam was happy that after today he wouldn't have to listen to Lisa and Marve planning on setting his sibling up with teachers from all around the school.
Cas looked rather shocked at the question, and they stared at her for a few moments, blinking in confusion. They tilted their head to the side, tapping a rhythm on their desk. "Yes?" They answered, still sounding confused. "He is my colleague and I work with him. Why do you ask."
The party was in full swing by the time they arrived, People dancing and drinking everywhere, the air full of sweat and laughter.
This wasn’t the first time one of Cas’ friends had forced them to watch a film, and Star Wars wasn’t bad. The best thing though, was Dean cuddling up to their side, he was warm and it filled Cas’ stomach with cliché butterflies when Dean dropped his head to their shoulder again.
One night Cas was over in Dean’s dorm, they were alone and perhaps sitting closer together then strictly necessary.
"My day was kind of boring," Sam replied, "I had a math test, learned about molecules in chemistry. Not much happened."
“No, you can sit there.” They say instead, looking back to their paper, reading the last sentence to find out where they were going with their argument. They could see the person place down their books out of the corner of their eye.
The day was finally here. Sam was excited, Cas would be coming over in less than 6 hours, or more, wouldn't.
Cas had had enough. They pulled Dean closer until their lips were just brushing as they spoke, “I think you should stop speaking and kiss me.”
They had tried to explain it to Sam a few years ago, but they had barely started before Sam had just signed and said, “Dean, liking ‘Womanly Shit’ doesn’t make you any less of a man. It’s fine to like what you like, grow up dude.” He just didn’t get it. They had tried a few more times, but they could never get the words out correctly, and Sam could never understand.
Mary and John all flinched slightly, so slightly Sam almost missed it, and he just passed it off as them being surprised as being called out.
Dean sighed softly, “Can we do it this evening at dinner, I don’t want to chicken out, I just want it out in the open.”
Cas snorted, a lot was a bit of an understatement, they probably forced Dean to drink 2 liters of water in the space of half an hour to sober him up.
He was pulled out of thought by Cas coming to sit next to him, a wide, bright smile gracing their face.
Sam just sighed, somehow Dean had managed to pull his parents into his lie. Pulling out his phone he shot his friends another text.
Sam had to bite his cheek to stop him from bursting out laughter at that. He had listened to endless rants about how useless and horrible Zachariah Alder is. Cas couldn't stand the other English Professor, not least because he always made sure to make a pointed remark about how "they them pronouns are plural" and "being nonbinary is a choice." It had upset Cas at first but they had learned to ignore him.
Lisa was already sitting in her seat and turned to Marve when she walked in a few minutes later, "What about the engineering guy?"
Garth nodded his head to the side, weighing up the option, "he seems very smitten, which I'm not sure he's good enough of an actor to fake, although the fact none of us have ever met her is a big red flag in the possibility of her existence." He continued to ponder his options, "Meh, could go either way." He eloquently finished.
After a bit, Cas reluctantly pulled back, “As much as I like hugs, I still have an essay to write, and I don’t think your work is going to do itself either.”
“Hey Dean, wait,” Dean sighed, pausing at the bottom of the staircase, waiting for his little brother to catch up.
Dean decided to cook lasagne, not too difficult to cook so they wouldn’t ruin it if they got distracted, but still one of their favourite meals.
Anyway. Sam believed Dean most of the time, but this girlfriend lie was stupid, it wasn't as if Sam cared if Dean had a girlfriend or not, he only cared because he was obviously lying.
The careers fair was on Friday, and Sam's class was going in for the second to last lesson of the day, Chemistry. That was conveniently the lesson before English, with Cas.
“He still doesn’t believe I exist?” Cas asked, wiping their tears away. Dean had told them before about Sam’s disbelief in their existence and it always made them laugh.
Dean fake gasped,  "I try to do a nice thing for my baby brother and this is the thanks I get. I came all the way here for you."
Dean seemed to finally pull himself out of his stupor as he surged forward, pulling cas into a kiss.
Cas’ words stuck with Dean for days afterwards, although they weren’t quite sure if they believed it, could there be others like them?
Marve just laughed, "we're not that desperate, not yet. Also I don't think the engineering guy would be a good fit for Professor Novak."
For a long while they didn’t respond, they just buried their head in Cas’ shoulder like an ostrich with its head in the sand denying what was coming. “Because I’m broken.” They whispered.
Their heart hurt, beating too fast in their chest, Dean didn’t feel the same way, did he? No. He didn’t love them. He was just drunk, right?
Dean was leaning against the impala, and he would have looked completely relaxed if it wasn’t for the awestruck expression on his face. “Cas,” He almost whispered. As if he suddenly remembered himself he cleared his throat before continuing, “You look very beautiful Cas.”
“We, um” Dean started, “We match,” He gestured to his own computer as he spoke and Cas noticed the stickers, a Spiderman trans sticker just like theirs. He also had a pair of cowboy boots in the bi flag colour and a piece of pie saying “Pie is better than sex” in ace colours.
By the time they had asked Cas' opinion on Professor Moseley the psychology professor, and if they thought she was pretty on Wednesday Sam was ready to scream, "THEY'RE MARRIED!!".
“I don’t understand,” Sam started tentatively, shooting a scared look towards Cas who was glaring at him, daring him to say something mean, “But, I don’t feel what you feel. You do. So I’ll take your word for it. I’ll mess up, but I’ll try.”
Cas, being ace, didn’t find people hot. They never really understood what people meant when they said people were hot. They liked Dean because of who he was, not what he looked like.
People didn't know Cas and Sam were siblings as it just never seemed important to bring up. Cas treated him like any other student. They had always been his sibling, but had become his legal sibling two years before when Cas and Dean had finally got married.
"I like your flower crown sunshine, suits you." Dean murmured quietly so as not to break the quiet that had settled in their corner.
They made eye contact from across the room and Sam made his way over. Luckily he already knew what he wanted to do with his future, so he didn't need to pay attention to the fair.
“Oh, you're an angel,” she squeals, pinching his cheek. “Flattery will get you everywhere!” The woman looks over to where Castiel stands by his car with caution. “And you must be Cassie!”
Gabe stays the night, bunking with Castiel so they don't dirty unnecessary sheets, although there is a tiny second bedroom on the third floor, housing a single bed that looks too small for even Gabe's height.
Dean smiles down at him reverently, eyes soft with love. He leans down to capture Castiel's lips, and Castiel melts into the kiss, pulling him closer as his free hand cradles Dean's jaw.
a homewrecker. Especially Rowena, he could never do that to her. Despite their differences... and her demon cat, Castiel does genuinely like her as a person.
the shrimp kisses, even if it's only one bite,” Dean demands. “Jumbo shrimp, stuffed with pepper jack cheese, all wrapped in bacon. It's fan-fucking-tastic.” It sounds more like a heart attack, but Castiel can't say no to Dean's eager and excited grin.
the electricity bill, Rowena tries not to run the A/C often, and has instead set up several fans around the shop. Summer months, she tells him, yes, she runs the bloody thing all day. But once October settles in and the air is slightly cooler (though still warm by Castiel's standards), she opts to save money.
“Garden Center?” Castiel asks. It seemed an odd shift from gardening to books, but it would explain all of the plants.
“She, uh, usually comes with me,” explains Dean as he slides under the covers. “I gotta be at the Versace room by six. From there, it's a lot of standing around, waiting for someone to direct me to the correct location for hair and makeup. Finally, they'll bring my outfit and dress me up like a Ken doll, and then eventually, I'll take a walk, show off the goods, and be done.”
The server brings out the drinks, and Castiel says they'll require a few more minutes before ordering. Dean is staring at the menu, but Castiel notices his eyes are glazed, lost in his own thoughts.
know about Castiel's position or his family's firm, or how wealthy he is. Dean doesn't know he's rich.
Throwing his coat on over a sweater and some slacks, Castiel punches the address for Singer Auto Repair and Restoration into his GPS. The sky is cloudy and dark, with rain in the forecast later. Castiel doubts winter here will be anything like snow days in Chicago, but he doesn't want to be out late nonetheless.
Ms. Rowena MacLeod, nor can it be her deceased father from whom she'd inherited the financially troubled business. Eyeing his tattered flannel and mismatched socks that peek out from under ripped jeans, Castiel wonders if the man is homeless and had wandered in through the open door. He certainly looks soiled enough, Castiel thinks, judging from the black streaks across his skin and the stains on his shirt.
Shoulders lax with the apparent relief of having evaded Dean, Cas releases an undignified shriek when he finds the hunter leaning against the exit.
, and then gave out his phone number. Is this supposed to mean something? Did Dean take care of the bill so that Castiel would then feel obligated to call? Is this supposed to be a bribe? Castiel is not unfamiliar with those, either. Lower-ranking Novak employees have approached him before, promising sex in exchange for promotions. Not that Castiel ever agrees to these offers.
Dean is quiet when they get back to the room, stewing over internal thoughts Castiel can't hear. He grabs some sleepwear before disappearing into the bathroom for a shower.
A handsome man taps Castiel on the shoulder, and he thinks the man may have been one of the models. “Yes, actually,” Castiel replies, “I'm looking for Dean W–
The rest of the evening and all of Saturday follow a similar pattern. Castiel opens the shop on time, but he doesn't bother to prop the door open or even switch on the
“You drove all the way from Chicago?” she marvels, leading them into the kitchen and gesturing to sit at the table. She brings over a fully-laden tray, a genuine 19
He removes his lips from Cas's, grinning when the angel tries to follow. “Hold your horses, cowboy,” he chuckles, though Cas is far from amused, rolling his hips against Dean and causing the man to choke and stutter. “J-Jesus, Cas! I'm just saying we might want to continue this somewhere else... where Sam won't be able to walk in.”
want to,” Gabriel says, handing over the single duffel bag Castiel has brought. “What if he's not worth it?”
“That's acceptable,” he continues. “As you're undoubtedly aware, I'm only here for the next twelve months, October to October, and then I'll be heading back to Chicago. Within that time, we'll work on getting your business back up to speed.”
Dean pats her on the back, and Castiel gives the woman a one-armed hug, his other hand refusing to let go of Dean's.
He jumps when he turns and finds Castiel standing so close behind him. “Ah, yeah, gotta lock him in the bedroom so he doesn't follow us. Ro hates when he gets out.”
“A few times,” Dean says, glancing around warily before moving to the front desk. He looks almost nervous, uneasy in a way that Castiel has never seen before. Something has his back up, and Castiel keeps an eye out, too, although he's not sure what he's looking for.
Castiel just shakes his head. “I don't see the point. Everything ends.” He shrugs. “And I'll be gone in nine months. It would be a waste of time.”
“Personally,” Dean informs him, leisurely approaching while still keeping himself between Castiel and the door, “I think you should finish what you started.”
Ah, well. Talking to Dean is still better than the throng of strangers down in the shop. And it's not like he could avoid Dean forever; he may as well accept it.
No, Dean sneaks off, up the stairs and out of sight, hiding in the shadows by the front door. He's not about to let Cas pop off so easily again.
Half an hour later, the Mercedes is parked out front and Jo calls him over to the desk to sign a few forms.
Castiel has gone back to running the bookstore, acting as the manager with Kevin and a few others as part-timers. Rowena still helps out every now and then, but she's usually busy running the new gardening center next door. When the little candle shop had gone out of business, Castiel and Gabe both helped her secure the space, transforming it into a one-stop-shop for all the gardening anyone could ever need. Crowley seems to love the new space, and he can often be found dozing under the warm lights next to the plants.
Rowena's other two friends, the extremely chipper Donna and the twitchy, timid Oskar, are already upstairs and binge-watching a show called
thing, not seeing Dean. Out of sight, out of mind, and all. During the day, it's easy; even if his mind associates Dean with the bookstore, Castiel is so busy he barely has time to think of stupidly sexy mechanics. The store is seeing a steady increase of customers, for a variety of reasons. One, the store is finally organized and books are much simpler to locate. Another, Castiel talked Rowena into adding a gardening section. He thinks it will be a perfect combination of books and her love for plants. Castiel's latest addition to the shop is the student area, a corner devoted to local university textbooks and supplies; Chastity may be annoying, but her visits raise a point, and a good percent of their latest sales come from students, so the idea pays off.
Gabe smirks, because while he does care about his brother's well-being, he's also an older brother who loves to dish out shit. “Half-past noon, Cassie! You've been dead to the world for a while, it seems. Rowena mentioned she couldn't get a hold of you when I dropped by, so I figured I'd check here next.”
So instead, he resolves to treat this as the best he'll ever have, as Cas has certainly ruined him for anyone else, now that
These days, Cas strolls into the bunker's kitchen while Dean is preparing dinner, nothing too fancy just steak and potatoes, but Cas slides his hips right alongside Dean's in front of the stove and says, “What's cooking, good-looking?”
Come closing time on Friday, Castiel has convinced himself he's merely still upset over Dean startling him the other day upstairs. He takes out his feelings on the register, slapping the bills harder than usual. Rowena left nearly an hour ago to go get ready, and so Castiel was left to close shop. The front door opens and Castiel swears; he'd shut it but neglected to lock. If he hadn't just closed the register, he'd be happy for the business, but at this point, Castiel is still frustrated for no good reason and just ready to go home. “Sorry, we're closed,” he grounds out to the customer, not sparing them a glance. “We open tomorrow at–”
“Me and Ro?” Dean chuckles, tears in his eyes. “First you think I'm with Jo, now you think I'm dating
“Rowena never told me where we're going,” Castiel admits, changing the topic. “She said you would tell me.”
“They dated for nearly two years. But during that time, Amara revealed her true colors,” Rowena says, contempt evident in her voice. “She only allowed Dean to take her out to expensive restaurants, and she manipulated him into buying her all sorts of pricy jewelry. When he tried to resist, arguing he needed to save money, she accused him of cheating, blaming his lack of cash on spending it with other people. Slowly, she began driving away all those Dean considered friends. She started controlling his modeling schedule, his diet, his hobbies. She wanted to be the only one in his life, and she was extremely jealous of his close relationship with Samuel. I think out of everything, she hated Dean sending Samuel monthly checks for school. She felt that was money Dean should be spending on her.”
Although Gabriel can be a handful, Castiel is grateful he spent Christmas here. Otherwise, the holidays would have been long and lonely. Generally, Castiel is always incredibly busy around this time of year with work. And if he's not working, he's attending holiday galas and spending Christmas Day at his mother's mansion with his siblings. New Year's Eve is the big Novak Corp end-of-year function, and there's always an open bar and more than enough single men looking for a midnight rendezvous.
“All right, go on and scoot, you little newt,” Dean chastises, flicking Castiel's ass with a dishtowel.
Dean laughs and gestures for Castiel to join him near the edge of the roof. “Yeah, she loves plants. Used to be a botanist, one of those people born with a green thumb.”
to move? He'd assumed all along that Dean enjoyed the lifestyle his modeling provided, and maybe at one point, he had. But Dean now... Dean is happy working at the auto shop. He's excited about getting certified and restoring old cars. He likes hanging out with Rowena in the bookstore. He enjoys taking Castiel around Galveston and showing him the island. Dean is happy here, how did Castiel not see it?
Fuck, that was the wrong thing to say. Castiel holds back a whimper and rolls over onto his other side so there's no chance Dean will see anything he's sporting.
know Dean?” he answers mysteriously. “He's around here somewhere, can't get rid of him. I'll help you look!” The man speaks of Dean discourteously, and Castiel immediately decides he doesn't like it. “I'm Aaron, by the way. I was the one in the black Valentino suit.”
The boisterous laughter that escapes Dean startles him. “Fuck no,” Dean answers, checking the mileage on the car and writing it on his clipboard. “That's Jo, she's like the little sister I never wanted.”
Castiel, in turn, lets himself drink in the stranger, six feet of freckled skin and perfect cheekbones, topped off by gorgeous green eyes. Too bad these features are hidden under all of the dirt, or Castiel might consider himself interested.
“Gabriel!” Castiel admonishes, thoroughly embarrassed. Rowena is clearly unimpressed, eyeing Gabriel with a shrewd expression.
“You can watch the shop whilst your brother and I discuss affairs elsewhere,” she declares primly, slipping back up the long staircase and evidently expecting her new boss to follow.
“At ten, I'm aware,” interrupts a smooth voice that Castiel has come to associate with his headaches. He finally looks up, and immediately wishes he hadn't.
in that flat but soft voice, the one Cas seemed to reserve solely for Dean. He must have mentioned it once, offhandedly said something like,
are involved. Dean will still go out for a lay to combat the loneliness, but he knows it will never be like
Castiel nods. “Yes, he left me with some rather large trust issues, I'm afraid. I thought it was best to distance myself, to keep things strictly physical in the future, and I did for a long time. But you proved me wrong. I found myself wanting to know you better, and I really enjoyed our talks, the time we spent together. I just... wanted you to know that.”
Humming gratefully, Cas wanders over and pours himself a generous cup. Dean smirks; maybe Cas is more worn-out than he would have guessed.
“Yes, and that's why I'm here.” Not liking the judgment being cast his way, Castiel drinks his tea out of politeness, pursing his lips at the black flavor, but it would be rude to ask for honey. “Tell me more about the store.”
“Yeah, I assumed you'd be there at this time. When I didn't see you, I expected Rowena to swoop in all worried. But no, instead it was your bible-thumping boyfriend who started asking all the questions.”
Fuck it. Castiel hasn't wanted someone this bad in years. It may have something to do with a lack of options in this town and how the bookstore doesn't exactly attract the sort of people Castiel generally meets at parties. He hasn't had sex in months and it's clearly showing if he wants to fuck a high school dropout. Fucking inconvenient.
“No, I mean,” he gasps when Dean shifts his hand, “I mean... I need you... I need you to come back with me. To Chicago.”
Dean on the nose with his index finger. Dean's brain must malfunction, because all he can manage is a high-pitched sort of wheeze.  And Cas pulls away, returning to Sam's side and advising him on the best way to handle the cursed decorations. It's over so fast, Dean isn't quite sure it even happened at all. At least not until Cas bids them farewell, merely nodding at Sam. Then, eyes crinkling, Cas smiles at Dean and declares, “It's been a treat, parakeet.”
“Dean finally discovered she'd been screening his calls and telling his brother that Dean didn't want to speak to him. Dean confronted her about it, about everything, and she... let's just say she didn't take it well.”
before, not like this. Dean paid his bill because he wanted to do something nice for someone he likes. And that someone is Castiel.
Dean checks them into the ballroom, where many round dining tables have been crowded into the area. Across the back of the room sits a large catwalk, and Castiel's eyes immediately go to the posters hanging from the ceiling.
Dean sighs, seemingly frustrated. “Let's just get this over with,” he groans in resignation, the door banging shut behind them.
It's the beginning of September when Castiel finds Dean on the rooftop of Rowena's apartment, muttering to himself and picking fights with the plants. “...can't believe she talked me into this... can't she water her own damn plants... friggin' rainforest up here, I swear...”
“Stop while you're ahead,” she advises. Her attention drifts to the book Gabe is still holding. “In need of Jesus? I'll say.”
“You know,” Sam says thoughtfully one evening after Cas has left following yet another strange salutation of,
“Get to the Woodlands,” she hisses quietly, as if she's trying not to be overheard. “We're at a last-minute event at the Hilton, I'll text you the address. Get here before seven and I can get you in!”
“I don't. But I take care to dress for the occasion. And I'm just a guest,” Castiel gestures at Dean, “I probably shouldn't outclass you, but no one told me anything before we left.”
He saves Dean's number without sending a message, throwing his phone onto the bed in frustration. Fucking Rowena. Yeah, Dean's probably doing a lot of that. Fucking Dean. That's what Castiel wants to do. He wants to fuck Dean, long and hard, quick and dirty. His mind provides tantalizing images of Dean bent over the hood of the Cabriolet, his jumpsuit pooling around his knees. Castiel struggles to remove his boxers without getting up, but finally, he extracts himself from the chair with limited mobility. He wavers on his feet a bit, hand clumsily palming at his own dick, and he shudders at the touch, imagining it's
“I gotta disinfect them, 'k?” he says, removing the little bottle first from the box. “'S probably gonna sting.”
Dean shakes his head at Castiel with disapproval. “Treat your car like you would a lady. Don't neglect her.” He scowls at the Cabriolet again. “Even if she is a Mercedes.”
Dean's strokes are hurried and messy, clearly out of practice, but Castiel chants his name just the same. “Dean–
Castiel supposes Dean could be referring to a car show, but he already said it isn't for Singer Auto. Just what second job does Dean have? He doesn't get the chance to respond, however, when they pull into a Marriott hotel parking lot. Castiel's jaw drops. He isn't unused to glamor, but he isn't used to pairing glamor with
“Sounds to me like you're missing out,” Dr. Alder muses, collecting the test results and stacking them into a folder. “Why don't you just read them?”
Three days later, Castiel is nearly finished organizing the secondhand shelves. He's separated the books into fiction and nonfiction. From there, the fiction is alphabetized by author, while the nonfiction is sorted by topic, then author. It isn't until his stomach rumbles loudly, that Castiel acknowledges he needs to stop for lunch. Upon learning Castiel brings his food every day, Rowena has been allowing him to keep his lunch in her refrigerator. Of course, this means that every day, Castiel has to pass through her living room to get to the kitchen.
, and Castiel feels a hint of pride as he admires the deep flush to Dean's skin and the faint mark on his neck. He quite prefers Dean's skin marred with bites than automotive oil. He looks down to find himself practically straddling Dean's waist, Dean's hands resting upon his hips, and he's fairly confident Dean can feel the press of his erection through their pants.
“Why would Cas need to get my attention?” he mutters, scowling at the appliance as if it had personally offended him. And in Dean's defense, it
