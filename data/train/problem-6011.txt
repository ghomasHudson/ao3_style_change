"No," Tony mumbles.
He hangs up without offering Tony time enough to compose a rebuttal. Maybe Tony did ask for it; maybe he's been asking for it all along. Steve always said that Tony was awful at looking out for himself.
Green Thumb, afaik he mostly stuck to scaring teenagers who tried to vandalize the community garden. he probably didn't need to register but he did anyway.
"You've been rude before," Sue says. "You've even been mean. But you've never been cruel."
"And here I thought you said that thirty was over the hill. How old are you again?"
"More weight," she agrees. "Every time they asked him the question that could save his life, he refused to speak except to ask for more weight." She pauses. "It's somethin' to think about."
"Do you remember when you were drinking?"
BIRCH: Did she? I'm flattered. I'm a big fan of Ms. Potts.
BIRCH: What do you find most difficult about working with Tony?
Friday:
"If you can't handle it—"
NB: About an hour. Little more if you're headed downtown.
TS: Mutants and miracles.
Or a resistance: fighting brainwashing, aware that his mind was not inviolate but unable to stop the violation, when the only thought that had lent him the strength to endure had been his certainty that the minute he gave up, Steve's life would be forfeit—
But sometimes—
Happy's not doing much. He's knocking around with his hands in his pockets, looking at the armor like he's a bored tourist in a museum. Happy likes to act like he's less than he is. For all his boss knows, he believes it, genuinely believes that he's just a washed-up pugilist with face of a bum, the talent of a hack, and the luck to get a girl too good for him. He's wrong, but good luck convincing him otherwise.
"I thought so," Friday says.
"'Us'?" Steve says. "You're twice as removed as I am." He's around the next corner, crossing in front of the crumbled hole that was once an exit to the southeast conference room. "And worse, you keep calling yourselves Avengers. Like you're not twisting our legacy." The next corner—now he's ten yards from Tony. There's no door on this wall. Nine yards—eight—
"You invited yourself over in the middle of the night expecting that you'd find me up, and hey, gold star, you were right. Which means I have no room to judge. Comparing me to Doctor Doom, though…"
"I trust you," Reed says. "And you trust her. A record could… ah, that's wishful thinking."
He pilots his body to the top of the tower and lets himself into Steve's room.
TS: That depends on your definition of natural. It sounds arrogant, I know. The thing is, we're already moving in that direction whether we realize it or not. We might as well give it a name and try to keep a hand on the steering wheel.
TS: I'm fine.
New tack. Keep up, Cap. "Do you ever think about what would happen?" Tony says. "If one of us turned rogue, got brainwashed… we've built quite the cabal."
BOWMAN: What you'd expect. Resistance to a number of diseases, fixes for more common debilitating factors—poor eyesight, for instance, and dementia.
"I am, too. Sometimes I look at him lying over there in that bed, and I think about him never waking up, and that makes even angrier. Happy says we should just be glad he's
. There's no special regard there, just a bug, just a yearning that Tony hasn't yet patched.
Tony's hand drops away.
Here's the causal chain: a small group of politicians incited by a less small collective of lobbyists decided that costumed heroes and extra-legal peacekeepers needed more government oversight. A minority of the public—those who remembered the string of brainwashings, defections, and bad decisions that shadowed groups like the Avengers—took notice of the initiative. Finally, a series of statistically improbable disasters (a hostage crisis, the PR and existential nightmare that was Stamford, some kid
TS: He's kidding. He likes to play up the grandpa act.
"You won't believe me when I say this, but I will miss you." Her face softens, her eyes soften; the crease of her mouth goes lax. "You're brilliant, Tony. You were my friend. For a long time, you were my friend; and I don't have friends. But this is my legacy, and that's worth more to me than you. It's worth everything."
Tony doesn't fall in love because he wants to fall in love. Tony falls in love because he doesn't have a choice. He loves Steve quietly, faithfully, because it's one of those disgraceful qualities he can't figure out how to cut out of himself. He loves Steve even when it hurts. The hurt is how he knows it's worthwhile. Pain is the only currency the universe understands. For Steve Rogers, Tony has paid dearly.
Sometimes he keeps himself so busy that he doesn't remember how tired he is. It isn't a temporary tiredness, the kind of thing that can be solved with a nightcap and a nap; the exhaustion he carries is set in his bones, has been accumulating there for a decade or more. It's the kind of tiredness that leeches the meaning and the color from the world around you, the kind of tiredness that smothers every want except the want of a soft, grey end. Tony's
Is it any wonder he loved Steve?
HH: I still say that's nuts.
"Please," Tony says. "Don't make me say it."
BOWMAN: Something like that.
"Did we ever what?" she says, and her tone is even sharper than her glance, it's granite, it's glacial. "She's my best friend. We aren't like

"Steve Rogers is an American hero," Ralston says. "If he won't compromise, then maybe this committee needs to reconsider its purpose."
When it's all over, he becomes first aware of exposure. The whisper of air against the soft skin of his cheek is like a slow tender graze from the fingers of someone beloved. A yoke sits oddly over his shoulders, constricting, tight and then lose and then tight again as he shifts: a shirt, a jacket. There are shoes and socks on the other side of the room. His feet are bare against the floor, his toes fragile and alien. The watchword is vulnerable.
"I—we're discussing this when I get back," Steve says.
He doesn't bother changing into pajamas of late—not, strictly speaking, that he ever did. These days, though, when Tony sleeps, he sleeps at regularly scheduled intervals, four hours every other day, and he sleeps stripped down to his underwear, usually on the cot in his workshop. When he's not in the country, he takes other measures, but on American soil, there's nowhere safer.
"Just a moment, boss," Friday says. "Their security is excellent."
"You said I don't matter."
"Right. Pass whatever information you can along to Captain Marvel. Carol, I'm about three minutes behind you. Keep your eyes peeled. Forty-three at large."
"Your problem," Steve says, "is that you're an optimist who thinks he's a cynic. It's a dangerous combination."
without me."
"You've fought alongside some of these people for years. Your friendship with Steve Rogers alone is notorious for its... intensity. I'll concede that we need to play softball, but it's crazy that we don't have more intelligence. This underground is operating right under our noses."
Cap bares his teeth, heaves. Sucks in a deep breath and spits out, "Electromagnetic pulse scrambler. Nick Fury's boys developed it back in the day. Weren't sure if it would be effective skin-to-skin after Extremis, but we figured it wouldn't do anything unless we cracked the armor."
HH: What's the other answer?
He still has this. No matter how the rest of his world fractures around him, he still has the armor and the joy of flying it. That sensation of freedom and fear tangled together lives in a pit behind his ribs; nothing else touches that spot, and if he dies in the sky, he'll roll up to the pearly gates and confess with complete honesty that it was worth it. If nothing else he did in his life proves worthwhile, he'll still have the memory of flight.
BIRCH: You've also cultivated friendships with a number of other superheroes.
"Go ahead," Tony says. "Enlighten me, Cap."
The kid gives him a long look out of dark eyes and then drops his gaze back to his screen. "A more interesting question is why you came here alone and defenseless, without the profanity of your armor. Someone stupid might accuse you of having a death wish, but I think that you really just want to save me. Poor Yinsen's son, made an orphan by terrorists. Maybe if I
DAEDALUS: Some people are still going to die. Even after all those trials on superhumans….
He's flinching now. He can't write it out; some things are apparently too deeply ingrained in his nervous system to be overridden.
DAEDALUS: I don't pay attention to politics. I have no idea.
"So what you're saying—" Lila waits to make sure he's done bickering with Rhodey, as if he could ever be done bickering with Rhodey. "You're saying that you make consumer electronics to pay for your research guys to develop weird stuff."
Steve is with him when he emerges into Maya's cathedral, and Friday, too. If Tony were wearing a hat, he'd uncover his head, because that was what you did—you humbled yourself in the face of the divine. The ceiling may not soar and the walls may not be ringed with silent knighted sentinels, but Tony feels the same instinctive expansiveness that sparks from his own workshop.
Captain America dodges. Barely. There's blood streaking down his jaw.
CB: Sure, if you want to put it like that. Have you always gotten along so well?
Steve used to joke about it; things got rough, he asked if someone had an eight-foot block of ice he could crawl into. He was joking, but the joke was about escape. Tony, who often joked about escapes, wondered if some part of Steve meant it, if he missed that cool remote place, missed the armor of the ice. Steve was probably joking, but Tony didn't want to bet on his ability to read Steve.
She is, because it's going to hurt, and at the moment Maya Hansen is very interested in hurting Tony Stark. He can't say he blames her.
He sits in front of his liquor cabinet, and he builds a What If.
That's why they wanted him here. The rest of it is just a powerplay; they don't need Tony to show up in person to tell him about Camp Hammond, the registry, the prison. What they need is a gesture that allows them to believe they're in charge. That's what this is. It's a chastisement, a reminder that Tony might be the one with his hand in the bird but HomeSec are the ones holding a cleaver to Tony's wrist. They want to flagellate him with Steve.
"Is this something I'm going to regret agreeing to?"
Dugan says.
The blaze is on the horizon: a red smudge against the sharper lights of the city. Behind it he can pick out the flashing strobe of fire trucks.
PASSIVE MODE //
ROGERS: He does it more often than you'd think, although you're sharp. Most folks don't catch it.
She sighs dramatically. He hadn't built that into her, either. "I suppose I can tolerate it from you," she says. "What's on your mind?"
and if Maya doesn't
"I think we owe it to what we were to try," Tony corrects. There's a cracked picture hanging on the wall behind Steve. A grinning Hank McCoy has his arm thrown over Simon's shoulder while Carol mugs for the camera behind them. It's crooked, tilted almost forty-five degrees above level.
"Looks like," Friday agrees.
"I'm furious."
Boynton's principal sin was introducing the Registration Act. His subordinate sins, of which there are many, consist of the usual litany of greed and moral pliability combined with a keen interest in excising the useful portions of the SRA (medical coverage, mental health support, access to training and support services) and inserting inflammatory replacements (mandatory disclosure of powers, for one thing). Tony's never been sure of the degree to which Boynton was aware the Tony was acting against him; Tony is a consummate professional, always dressed in a suit and ready with a handshake, but Boynton's puppetmasters possess both deep pockets and deep secrets. Tony is here, right here, at this exact moment, because he wants Boynton to see his face. Understanding is too much to hope for, but Tony has planted the seed of understanding, and in another three or four years, after he's had time to sit in his solitary cell and contemplate his choices, Boynton may come to a realization about the architect of his misery.
"You're sure it's a she?"
JV: Tony.
But Tony isn't wrong: he knows what's coming, he just lacks the words to make Steve understand. Tony isn't Mordred; he's Cassandra, and Troy is burning. If he falters now for lack of conviction, he might as well have laid down in the snow and let himself die all those years ago when his heart was fighting a losing battle against addiction.
"Progress isn't some blind god you can appease with enough sacrifices."
"You know what your problem is?" She reconsiders. "Well. You know what one of your problems is? You sold out. I remember when you were original. Now you're just treading water."
One of Tony's passions is miniaturization. It's a driving problem with the armor—all those bells, all those whistles, and he still has to carry the bulk of it around in a briefcase. He's come up with a dozen alternate methods, of course, and all of them are integrated into the Model 29; he can call the armor to him as either a whole or in modular pieces, he can tell it to assemble itself around him, he can even store a part of it inside the core of his bones, but none of that is really more than a terminal line of upgrade on a device that is already hopelessly out-of-date. He needs to scale it smaller without losing any of the strength or adaptability. He needs to make it more flexible, more responsive to a wider variety of crises. He needs to build himself into it.
Of course, after all that primordial nucleosynthesis came the dazzling part, the stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the fun heavy elements: carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon. All those luminous stars still tick-tick-ticking away in the heavens are actually crushing themselves heavier and heavier as they blaze. The biggest stars, the ones that explode into supernovas before they collapse, produce iron.
JV: Did he.
ROGERS: It gives you exactly the amount of credit you deserve. You're a hard person to know, but the reward is more than worth the effort. I've always thought…
he says.
Here's one dream:
"Boss?" Friday whispers. She's always in his ear, a better conscience than he deserves.
Extremis had restructured his mind so it resembled a neural computer more than the flesh-and-blood product of uneasy evolution. He could write code for his brain. He could send and receive wireless signals from his cortexes. He could think in parallel processes that put the Cray Jaguar to shame. And then came the Mordred to his Arthur, armed with shining code of his own, to crack open Tony's skull and spill his secrets on the floor.
"Maybe you do," Steve says. "Always with the crystal ball, never with the mirror. You don't have much time left, Tony. How are you going to use it?"
BOWMAN: As long as you don't get distracted planning your escape to the Grenadines.
Tony takes a wiff off his armpit. It's…
And behind that door?
When Tony was a kid, his dad would take him to the gun range. This was after he'd gone off to boarding school but well before college; he was big enough to shoot a .45 without being knocked on his ass, but not big enough that he'd learned his face was as much a mask as any iron helmet. Howard started him on a .45 because in his father's pantheon small-caliber arms were akin to toys. "Anything below a nine millimeter doesn't have enough stopping power, son," was Howard's refrain, like they were both going to war, like Howard didn't have his own private security, like the only consideration was how much damage a gun could do to a man while remaining cost-effective to produce.
SR: He did. After Patton called him an unpatriotic anarchist.
Pepper moves to a different state. He didn't expect anything else. The Richardses reunite and go off to do whatever it is Richardses do. Rhodey stops calling. He called and he called and he called, left all these messages that Iron Man plays back inside his head—
"I know."
When he has to sleep, that's where he sleeps; and when he doesn't have to sleep, some dreaming piece of him is still and always in that cathedral to engineering.
JV: I have one of his sketches framed in my office. It was that A-line evening gown with the side slit that I designed for Wanda from one of my earlier collections. He drew her wearing that with this gorgeous pair of Saint Laurent earrings.
"What's the survival rate?" he grinds out.
"Idealism," Cap says. "Not delusion."
"Sit," Steve says.
"More weight," he says.
STARK: Huh.
"Nebraska?" he asks.
But that was years ago, and he's lost the metaphor, or maybe the real conclusion is that Tony over-identifies with all fictional people and under-identifies with all real ones.
you an explanation. Okay, try this one on for size: I'm doing what you told me to do, Cap. I'm owning my problems. I'm taking responsibility."
"Imagine if you were being stubborn about this," Tony snaps. "Oh, wait, never mind. How am I supposed to explain it, Steve? You can't tell me you don't see the need for regulation. Springfield, Stamford, the Young Avengers—they're great kids, but they deserve more than a slapdash training regimen whenever we can make time for them. The American public saw a need, and their duly-elected representatives enacted a law to meet that need. The rest of us only get to decide whether we serve the law or dictate it."
"Just think about it," Pepper says. Her eyes shut. There are tears streaking down her cheeks now, collecting along her eyelashes until the weight becomes too much; it's the first time he's seen her cry since she got the call about Happy. Even now, it's remote. Whatever part of Pepper is engaging with this present reality is hidden somewhere far out of Tony's reach.
Iron Man opens his eyes. Twelve blocks away, in a private hospital room, Happy Hogan's heart monitor flatlines.
"You were a child then," Tony says. "You're all grown up now. Time to have a little faith in yourself."
"I'm thinking," Tony says slowly, "that the delta waves serve as an indicator. What's this?" He touches one of the spikes on the graph.
All he has to do is gather a little information and get out. Easy. Done. With enough evidence to construct a timeline he can convince—
HP: He saved my ass a lot.
"That's an exaggeration," Byrd says. Byrd is Tony's favorite. He's a battleaxe. He's a skeptic, and he doesn't like Tony. Respects him, maybe; but doesn't like him. "We are interested to hear your assessment of how the application of the SRA is going."
If these are his last rites, he can think of worse ways to go. At least he gets to talk with Steve; he can't think of anything better than talking with Steve. Steve won't go away no matter how many ways Tony's tried to drive him out. He won't leave Tony alone, because Tony doesn't really want to be left alone. If the only way he can have Steve is to let his mind be haunted, then he'll throw open the doors and invite the specter in.
She's in the visitation room when he arrives. They have her chained to the table; he isn't sure why.
Clint's expression turns a little mulish. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out his phone, and tosses it across the table to Tony. It's cracked. It's also dripping wet.
to see what Steve had drawn. Tony always did want to see. He still wants to see.
He's late to the meeting. He knows because Carol tells him. Cause and effect in a nice little chain—why can't everything be so efficient?
"What I'm getting at, handsome, is that you're abusing your position as Captain America. This is not a bloodless conflict, but it would be less bloodless by orders of magnitude if you hadn't dragged every twenty-something with a knack for heroics and a poster of the Avengers on their bedroom wall into
, they had other preventative measures built into them beyond what guarded against psychic attack, too. Chemical or viral attacks would have been picked up by the armor's sensors. Anything biochemical or biomechanical was almost out of the question.  Magic wasn't. Tony hated magic, but it wasn't out of the question. And if the armor was hacked, there was still a man inside the tin can who would remember—
Tony's palms are broad and calloused, his arms hard with lean muscle, but his wrists have always been too delicate to belong to a man who doesn't flinch. When they had taken his gauntlets, the soldiers' hands were around his wrists. They hadn't touched his skin, because he still wore the undersheath with its golden lattice of peptide chains, but he'd felt the pressure of their fingers like manacles nonetheless.
"He did it," Tony interrupts. "Hill showed me the footage. They were at an altitude of thirty-thousand feet. If the helicarrier didn't have emergency force shields, the entire bridge crew would be in the hospital from the decompression."
TS: Which isn't as much fun for a desk jockey as a super-soldier. He's been teaching me to fight on and off for years, and I still have trouble keeping up.
L. Samson
Tony has always walked close to the border of transhumanism. There's an argument waiting to be made that he transgressed that border years ago, first as an accident in the pursuit of staying alive, and then later deliberately, as he put control chips and psychotransmitters and artificial hearts inside his body. Extremis blew those doors wide open. What's the next step? What's the step beyond that, and beyond that?
Thank you.
It's a What If; it has no bearing on reality. Tony puts it away. He has a six-mile drop to worry about.
BIRCH: Call me Cora. Tony, I'm not sure I'd want to know what you would name your autobiography, so I'm sticking to the script Ms. Potts gave me and saying no.
JV: Hush, Tony. I wasn't being accusatory. I'm actually surprised it wasn't you.
BOWMAN: Of course not.
At 6:03:21, Iron Man leaps, fires his repulsors, comes down hard with a punch aimed straight at Captain America's weak shoulder. Beneath the the thud of impact and after the snap of bone, the sound of bone shards grinding against each other is barely but crucially audible.
"Do you remember what happened last time?" she argues. "I threw a temper-tantrum and nearly harmed Ms. Potts."
"It's not your fault either, Cap. Don't beat yourself up about it."
"Okay," Tony says. He's numb to it. Nothing can shock him anymore; this might as well happen. "Any idea where Hill went?"
He wonders what Steve knows about sin. Steve grew up Irish Catholic, twenty-five thousand days ago.
He's in favor of the SRA. Says that if the proper authorities had taken a little more interest in his case, early intervention might have prevented the mental break that led to all those deaths."
What about him?
DAEDALUS: They're going to hate you, you know. Paint you as a villain.
"So that happened."
Terrifyingly, Friday hesitates. "It appears to be… dormant."
They'd asked him to take his armor off, and he'd told them yes and then held still without struggling as they stripped him. He didn't fight. It was an entirely consensual encounter. Nobody can remove the armor without Tony's consent.
we all know it's a murder dude
"Ha ha," Rhodey says dryly. He, like Tony, is used to Friday's sense of humor; she's a little more pert than some of his other AIs, and a little sharper for it. Tony, improved beyond human limits, interfaces directly with his suit, without the lag time of translating reflex into body movement into armor response. He thinks; the armor moves; it's a superior solution. Rhodey still requires a software intermediary. For the past few years, Friday has served that purpose.
In 1945 Steve Rogers, through a combination of factors that made lightning strikes look common, was lifted outside of time. Some decades later, he was pulled from his rest and made to resume living in a world of linear cause and effect. Tony can't imagine the shock of that, can't imagine how badly Steve must have wanted to return to sleep. When he'd passed, it only seemed fair to return him to the one place he'd known peace.
Why does all of this seem so urgent?
> EXECUTE PROGRAM? [Y/N]
A pause, and then Friday says, "That's quite a list, boss. Shall we get started?"
DAEDALUS: What are you going to do when we're done?
There's about half a second of hesitation on her face before she answers, "Garage."
HP: When we showed him how to pop popcorn?
"The kind you're legally entitled to wear." A pause. "Colonel Rhodes called. He wanted to know how you're doin'."
ROGERS: Tony.
Tony doesn't have to be better if he can make the armor better, but he made himself part of the armor, so that means he has to be better, too.
He's so tired. In the end, he just wants to be done, however little he deserves that escape.
"Make that three," Tony corrects.
STARK: Fair enough.
"I changed the message," Iron Man says. "At 9:38 last night Barton purportedly made a secure broadcast containing the route his convoy would be taking between the Senator's hotel and Ryker's Island."
all by himself.
We'll absolutely continue to apply the law fairly across the board. If breaks that law, then yes, they'll face consequences. Next question.
"Two weeks," Rhodey says. "She and Dad came up from Georgia. Dad said he was tired of me spending all my leave bumming around his house."
TS: Shucks.
"You and Victor, always with your armor."
"Last night you mentioned somethin' about neurological feedback in the armor. I have some ideas on that point," she adds. "And… there's the hospital, boss."
It happens fast. Maybe forty-five seconds elapse from the time the helmet comes down over his head. Maybe less. No more than a minute.
Steve heaves a sigh. "Always knew you only wanted me for my body."
Tony yawns. It isn't planned.
"I'm starting to think you're right," she says. "You clearly have no idea what it's doing to him to have to fight you."
There's a pause like another loaded gun.
HP: Fuck it's freezing.
"Boss? Are you back with me?"
"That he wouldn't listen to me at all."
She waits for him to catch his breath and wipe the blood from his face, and then, sounding amused, she says, "Go ahead and ask."
He looks up at Pepper. Pepper is looking at Happy.
"Have you ever been enough, Tony?" Steve asks. "What you are, what you do, who you choose to be—has that ever been enough for anyone?"
BIRCH: Go on.
You can't put it back in the box. You can't fix
STARK: Happy.
The third catches him in the head. So does the fourth.
Steve sighs, folds his sketchpad, and tosses it on the coffee table. There's a city-scape half-finished on the opened page, the same one-hundred and eighty degree view that Tony can see right now if he glances past the TV. Steve had been on a diplomatic envoy, some favor to SHIELD that Hill called due, and now he's here, drawing, in Tony's living room. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio.
Thirty-three days ago, Tony poured a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black down the sink in the kitchen behind him. He didn't drink any of it, not even when a single gleaming drop fell from the mouth of the empty bottle and ran down the curve of his thumb. The seal on his armor is impenetrable, maintaining a complete artificial atmosphere in its confines. Iron Man is its own world, a bubble set apart from the rest of the universe, an absolute division between what is without and what is within. Despite that, Tony can smell whisky on the back of his tongue and the roof of his mouth.
And, you know, what he wants and what he deserves have always been the same thing. At the root, that's the problem. He just wants it all to be over.
Cornfield murder
Rogers shifts. "You know," he says, "when I came out of the ice, you only wanted to show me all the good things about this time. I used to think you were trying to sell me on the future, but that wasn't it. You're so fixated on how things could be that you can't look how things are in the eye."
She frowns. "We picked him up yesterday. He's being held in an isolated cell three decks below."
"And you look like someone who should be selling pharmaceuticals to terminal cancer patients at a four-hundred percent markup," says Maya. Maybe another of the things that Tony likes about Maya is that she doesn't like him; maybe not. It's hard to tell what she likes that isn't a laboratory empty of other people or an eight-digit grant. "Where is it? Did you
There is nothing in the world that beats flying; Tony's in love with excess, but nothing beats this. He could throw millions of dollars at every attraction the universe has to offer—there are a lot, and he's tried most of them—and even the fastest cars driven by the most gorgeous models piled on all the fame in Hollywood on top of a flawless reputation on top of his mom on top of Happy on top of Pepper on top of Rhodey on top of his workshop on top of the Avengers and craven dreams of chivalry and Steve's presence in his bed and not having once had a cavity sitting where his heart should be—
The worst part is that no matter how hard Tony tries to keep his attention on Messner-comma-Georgia's blackened skin, Steve sits like a gravity well on the edge of his vision. He's never not wanted to look at Steve, even when Steve hated him, even when Steve was beating him to death. He can't fight that instinct, and so he looks up, and so he sees the expression of mocking, condescending pity that sits on Steve's face. What a fair-skinned blue-eyed boy Steve is. Jesus, he's a handsome man. When he plants his feet, not even the heaving earth can make him move; that's the strength of his conviction.
TO: Ben Urich <
NB: The statistics are against him, but this isn't really a normal case. We don't run up against many of the…
Maya came to Tony and said someone had
No. He did this for Steve—
"No." Steve drops his shield on the table, plants his hands at the edge. Without realizing it, they've taken up opposite ends. "This isn't about abiding by the law. You may be able to convince the rest of the country that you're toeing the company line, but I know you better than that." This is going to hurt; whatever Steve says next, however he assesses the content of Tony's character, it's going to hurt.
TS: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.
That's bullshit, of course. Tony has better reasons for not sleeping.
"Good enough." He scrubs one hand over his face and beard and then hauls himself to his feet. "It might take a while, since we're removing part of your core architecture, but it shouldn't hurt."
Tony looks away, not at the body and not at Steve. "How much I love you," he says.
SR: He's good at fooling people. Makes them think he likes attention.
"Anyone ever tell you that you're too clever for your own good?"
Pepper has told him more than once that he's full of it. She says that he's trained himself to work under suboptimal conditions and that the only reason he thinks he functions better when deprived is that his blood sugar's so low he's hallucinatory. Tony usually counters by pointedly drinking coffee in her direction.
TS: Way to lay it out there.
, then Tony doesn't either. Doesn't care. That's fair.
Stark's support, meanwhile, is what guarantees success with both the country's citizens and with the superhero community. I agree that he is a polarizing man, but he enjoys a broad popularity and a keen understanding of political maneuvering and the importance of public image. We cannot lose him. Richards will no doubt defect to his family before long, and Van Dyne is uninterested in a leadership role. Col. Jackson will continue to work to bring Pym back to the fold, but although he has written enthusiastically in support of our cause, I suspect he will remain, for the time being, retired.
Something in his chest seizes—certainly not his heart. It's just muscle and tissue, it's just a fear-response. "I don't wear the armor everywhere, Maya."
"You're joking," Steve had said.
And even the psychological dependency might be beyond her. On a basic level, Friday's needs are simple. She needs a purpose, she needs engagement and stimulation, and she needs better hardware. Tony has the last point covered and does his best to keep a handle on the first two; even he isn't quite so heartless as to birth a new sentience and then leave to rot on its own. That's what makes it beyond her. She doesn't understand black and white, all or nothing, she doesn't understand that the only way to cope with needing to control everything is embracing the nihilism of being out-of-control, she doesn't understand that you have to fill up the constant cavity in your chest with
"Sure," Tony says, and he takes a seat and watches as the Secretary of Defense pours him a drink.
NB: Sure thing. Let me grab a cup of coffee for her, that girl lives on caffeine. Can I get you something?
"Good to know you're still alive in there," she says. "I thought I was playing all these old recordings to an empty shell."
He was traditional. He was conservative. Carol understands the mindset. And part of Tony, part of Tony has always wondered if this might be one more way in which he and Carol are the same—
Hill eyes him. She's wary but curious—she might even sense his roiling anger, but she's reserved enough not to mention it. "I thought you didn't drink anymore."
• 6h ago
Carol and Tony are within spitting distance of the same height—one of them a hair over six feet, one of them a hair under. The added height of the armor does nothing to remove that equity.
At 6:03:18, Iron Man seizes Captain America by the shoulder and flings him into a helicopter. The articulation of movement is transcendent: in his arm alone, a hundred thousand processes go into simply bending Iron Man's elbow, closing his fingers, and compensating for the weight of a well-built man in tactical gear. Iron Man doesn't stagger, because Iron Man's creator long ago mastered directional force, because Iron Man doesn't budge an inch even while firing a high-density muon beam right down Captain America's gullet.
SR: Bleeding-edge business?
He steadies himself against the base of a statue, forces himself upright, clenches his fist to check the function of his hand. All his fingers still move. His head is bare; his hands work. He'll be fine.
"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy," Tony says, because he knows a little something about taking a blow to the head.
He's forty feet in when he meets his first casualty. Eighty feet, and he meets someone living, someone bleeding from the temple and coated in dust and soot and she's wearing an employee badge clipped to her shirt and he remembers her—Shonda—he met her once on a tour. She's the head of security—
want." And then Tony really starts to get it, what it's like to go up against Captain America, what facing down Steve Rogers means: one second Cap's standing there, talking, and the next he's slamming a fist into Tony's side. He catches it on his lower ribs. Despite the protective sheath of his underarmor, he feels—hears—no: some amalgamation of the two, like the way a low bass vibrato is felt with the entire body—he
And then Steve comes into the garden.
"Excuse me," he says, and leaps into the air. "I have a dinner date with the president."
Where the Avengers live there is light and shadow. The light spills out of the kitchen; he can hear voices in there, Carol and Jan, Rhodey and Clint, Peter laughing at himself. The old is gone, but there's something special here, too, something new and bright and enduring in this reincarnation. Tougher, maybe, too, more grounded and less heady, but that's the price of experience and the knowledge of grief, because there
Could be any one of them. Could be a freak accident. Tony's always inclined to believe the former, but his luck is rotten enough that it could easily be the latter. That's eighty of his people trapped in a building with no way out—eighty of his people in his city, and he hasn't visited that plant in over a year, he has no idea if the safety inspections were being performed to his standards—
DAEDALUS: A standardized version? What's in it?
DAEDALUS: I wouldn't have thought you of all people would take the other side of this argument.
STARK: It's funny you think I'd be insulted by that.
Her voice low and very tight, Carol says, "Senator Boynton's name is attached to the bill."
Tony's in New York, a temporary retreat to lick his wounds. It's a moot exercise. Really he just needs a moment in the one place where he feels most like himself.
"He's also brilliant," Reed counters. "And the two of you share a certain… ideological obsession."
Tony Stark shuts his eyes. Some echo of what he was begins to pray.
"Someone could make an argument that what you do isn't science but magic." At his sharp look, Friday shrugs. "Just sayin'."
He starts to dive, dropping his airspeed and his altitude simultaneously. He's still flying well above Mach 2, but he can't keep traveling twenty-eight hundred feet per second while he's buzzing Manhattan. His fault—he was flying subsonic when Friday alerted him to the problem. Or is that better? He can make it to DC in less than ten minutes no problem, but he was taking his time, using the flight to work through his agenda for tomorrow's briefing with Maria Hill and draw up some outer dimensional schematics for Project 42.
"Ladies and gentlemen of the subcommittee," he says. "I know you're busy making sure the country keeps on tickin', so I'll keep my remarks brief.
Kooning sighs.
, but Reed's playgrounds are interdimensional physics and cosmic flow theory. For all that, though, the whole spectrum of emotion is as much a mystery to Reed as it is to everyone else. Grief is unfathomable.
He hasn't touched Steve for two hundred days. The last time he touched Steve, he was trying to beat him to death because the Mordred of the twenty-first century found a backdoor pass into Tony's brain and hijacked him body and soul. Tony cracked Steve's collarbone, tore off his ear. Crushed his trachea. That Steve isn't dead by Tony's hand is a function of blind awful
Maybe dying at Steve's hand isn't such a bad way to go. Maybe, if Steve thinks this is what he deserves, it's even right. He didn't calculate this outcome, not his behavior and not Steve's, because his problem is that he had to be told what Steve was born knowing.
"We could move him, you know, if you think a different environment would be better." Nothing. "You should take a break. Shower, sleep, eat something that isn't served on a styrofoam plate. I'll stay here as long as you—"
SR: We can't all be young hooligan whippersnappers like you.
Tony sits. He sits exactly this far from Steve: close enough to steal Steve's warmth, but not close enough that any part of Tony is touching any part of Steve. "How was Madripoor?"
"Why doesn't SI sell artificial general intelligences?" Lila wants to know. That's another thing he likes about her—not just that she never cuts him a break, which is a quality shared by all his favorite people, but that there's no end to her questions.
"Your shot went wide," Howard said. "Don't flinch before you fire."
"Ulfius says he's looking for a wizard because his king is wasting away for want of a woman, and the beggar says, well, hey, I know the guy you're seeking. Thou seekest Merlin, but seek no further, for I am he. And then Merlin says, if your king will give me what I desire, I'll give him what he desires."
"And this?"
"I don't need as much beauty sleep as a nonagenerian."
Those are the facts. The eagle-eyed are left to read between the lines of what has been
And Tony hears it: the unmistakable whine of micro-repulsors. There's no sound like it in the world.
Iron was fine, but what happened to all the lithium?
There's a certain state Tony can reach under the right conditions: a luminous state that almost approaches grace. Pain is a crucible that purifies him until all that remains is the kind of clarity known only to mystics, the kind that lets him hear the signal in the noise. Trauma is not something to be endured but rather something to be embraced as the genesis of revelation. So let his heart be carved away, let his armor be taken, let all those deaths sit heavy on his shoulders: Tony not only can but needs to suffer. He deserves it. Doesn't he deserve to be brilliant?
JK: I am sorry, Tony. For what it's worth.
STARK: Hey, she said 'most difficult,' not 'worst.' Deep, right? Have I mentioned that he hides the TV remote?
"Business as usual," he says, because even SHIELD is an industry. "Something I can help you with, sir?"
The tower. His tower, for the Avengers.
He's circling the table now, going the long way around… trying to herd Tony away from his armor, maybe, or maybe just trying to intimidate. He paces past the door to the foyer, turns the corner, and starts down the long side that faces the library.
"Engineering always looks opaque from the outside. Clark's third law."
Sometimes he talks, sometimes he
And last, he opens the door to Steve's room.
"I'm not going," Tony says.
Here's one of them: Rhodey swings by at the end of a long day and brings his niece, Lila, with him. Tony has a vested interest in Lila.
BOWMAN: Don't tell me you're having second thoughts.
Osborn unnerves people. He appears, at first glance, like nothing more than a reasonably-fit businessman on the far side of middle age: educated, erudite, genial. And then something about the eyes strikes you—or the slow slide of his too-wide smile—or the way he watches you from behind his glasses—and you become aware that you're watching a foreign consciousness manipulating a person-suit. The uncanny thing is that he can charm you anyway, get inside your head, anticipate and twist your own thoughts. Iron Man has always been mildly fascinated by him; and repulsed, too. Is his psychosis a tragic reason or a convenient excuse?
SR: Advanced technology?
"Friday?" Tony says. (This is later.) "Wake up and get to work. I'm not paying you to sleep on the job."
JV: Tony? What are you looking at?
A kingdom for his armor, that's how Tony wants to use it. Not this armor, this armor that Maya breached, this wet sack of armor that Tony wears like a suit; he wants his real armor, the dry hard strong armor, the shell that made him better. Now he's missing half an ear. That's why he got rid of ears on his real body. You never knew when someone was going to tear one off.
"How do we fix this?" he says. "One hundred things. Let's go."
Dugan's voice draws a grim line.

BIRCH: He's happy?

That fraction of a second is all the opening Rogers needs. He gets his legs up and jackknifes, catching Iron Man high in the chest. When Rogers comes up swinging, he's holding the shield again. The first swing takes Iron Man in the side. The second knocks him off his feet.
SR: Wish I were.
TS: I'm in the middle of an important investigation—
Tony rolls over, swings his feet to the ground, and sits up. "Where?"
NB: Hell, if you can figure out what happened we'll appreciate yours. Grif's a good guy. Kind of a grouch, but a good man.
His hand falls open.
SR: We haven't.
"A piece of work to make sick men whole," Tony answers.
What was his alias?
"Then you'll face arrest and a prison sentence," Iron Man says.
"Funny," Steve says. "Could've fooled me. I've heard enough." He picks up his shield, doesn't bother yanking his cowl over his face.
JK: Do you really want to get into that? It's all here in the paperwork.
Once upon a time, Tony had a secret identity of his own. Now it seems like he was impossibly young: but that Tony wasn't naive, that Tony had taken his knocks, that Tony knew that sometimes it was better to draw a line between what
The final indignity is sneaking half a mile through a cornfield on foot in the dead of night. He trips more than once. If he had one of the Stephen King novels from Maya's prison library, maybe he'd have a better idea of what was coming for him; or maybe he'd just be able to name the thing that comes out of the dark before it eats him. This isn't how he thought he'd go. What's he even doing here? If the sun were out, he'd be able to pick out the bulk of the helicarrier where he left it parked six miles over Nebraska. Unless Danvers or some other, less principled power had moved it, although either case is equally useless to Tony. But maybe if he can—if he—
And it looks like
—and unlike Steve, who passively gambled on an unknown formula, Tony built this transformation himself. He understands it from the ground up. He sees what's coming. He makes it happen.
BIRCH: He's ardent, in how he defends you to the press.
"What are you lookin' for?" Friday asks. There are no cameras in the bedrooms, so she doesn't have eyes on him.
"How's..."
Despite all of that, when he saw Steve leap out of the helicarrier six miles above the ground, he thought he was having a heart attack.
HP: And this way no one will know where his body is.

TS: I am the armor.
"Anything," Tony says. "You name it."
This, here, is the real violation, but he's already violated Steve's memory in so many ways that one more incursion isn't going to damn him any more deeply than he's already damned. Anyway, Steve used to love to share his sketches with Tony—not to the point of handing over his whole sketchpad, but always with the half-eager, half-shy expectation that Tony would
Please contact the Box Elder Police Department with any information.
He sees her on the CNN feed the next day; someone managed to get footage of her diving into the East River to rescue a kid and his moms after they lost control of their car and went sailing off the Brooklyn Bridge. That's because Carol is a hero. She got into this business to save people. Iron Man—Iron Man is a failsafe.
Tony closes his eyes and absorbs the blow. There's the kid, not yet twenty, sitting on a pier, cracking into Tony's brain with a notebook that looks like it was cobbled together from dumpster parts, doing what men and women with exponentially more resources have been trying and failing to do for years.
"I don't care. The Foundation PR team is supposed to vet news sources and then communicate a list of approvals to whoever's hosting one of our appearances. I'll have someone's head on a block if they aren't doing their job. What did they hit you with?"
"The cornfield kidnappings? Is that what they're calling them?" Tony says, and then, "Of course it's occurred to me."
"She's probably going to recognize a lot," Tony says.
"Yes, sir," Tony says.
"Go," Cap says. "Carol, you're with him—we'll meet you there. Jim, you want in on this one?"
"You know she's not gonna stop talking about this for the next month," Rhodey says. "If you needed someone to hero-worship you, though, couldn't you have hijacked a different guy's niece?"
Senator Boynton (D - NY) introduced the Superhuman Registration Act to the 109th U.S. Congress. It passed through both the Senate and the House with unprecedented speed; Friday had staged an entire holographic production of Schoolhouse Rock's "I'm Just a Bill" to either cheer Tony up or piss him off—hard to tell with her. The president had signed the act into law in the early days of summer. A matter of hours after it passed, Steve Rogers, in one of his usual unintentionally iconic displays, had announced his decision to resist Registration and go underground. Neither the announcement nor the resistance were peaceful. He and Tony haven't spoken since.
that Tony can only fake. Until now. Now he's just a lonely insomniac playing chess with another lonely insomniac in the middle of the night while the world outside sleeps, its sole respite from their planning.
STARK: Trade secret. He's smarter, but I'm a better multitasker. Don't tell him I said that.

If he's going to turn himself in, he'll have to destroy the armor first—maybe all the armors, since almost all of them have wireless arrays he can use as rudimentary controls, even if none of the previous models allow for the symphony of concordance he can achieve with the Extremis model. He'll have to destroy the Iron Man first, and then he'll have to notify Hill and tell her… tell her…
was spotted in the skies over Connecticut by Carol Corps member @warbird77. She appeared to be flying escort for some kind of military transport. No mention of her in the news—too bad Sally Floyd's AWOL.
"Sure, Tony," Steve says. "You might not matter, but they do. Sixty-three percent. Seems to me like you ought to step up and take responsibility."
The big problem—not so much for Tony, but he has an idea—is ammunition. Everyone wants to know how War Machine can fire what amounts to four hundred rounds per minute from what is essentially a shoulder-mounted Gatling gun, but that's because they lack any kind of creativity. Tony partially subverted the problem with energy weapons, but Rhodey continues to insist on some kind of physical projectile, and Tony, because he's an obliging kind of guy, obliges.
and what has been
Most of the damage is the result of Wanda's final, desperate battle with Doctor Doom; neither the Mansion nor the team have been right since, not in Tony's estimation. The Vision died that day. So did Scott Lang. Clint was critically injured and spent weeks in the hospital, months in recovery. And Wanda left; no one has seen or heard from her since. Maybe she's alive. Maybe she isn't. The rest of them were about as useful in that fight as a butterknife in a shootout; Wanda was the only one with enough power to hold Doom at bay, but the cost to her had been unfathomable.
SR: Guess I told you that one, huh.
. He never protested when Howard took him to the shooting range, for that reason and because Howard rarely bestowed attention of any sort; he also had the fascination of a child and of an engineer with force, and there wasn't much that Tony had encountered that was more forceful than a lump of metal propelled with explosive power at a thousand feet per second. He was young.
There's no one here, per the cameras; he didn't want Friday interfacing with the network, because there's no telling what Maya considers reasonable security measures within her own domain. She guarded her work with all the brutal, artless ferocity of a junkyard dog. Tony, who once hunted like animals the men who stole his designs, can't fault her for it.
STARK: Even when he isn't serving as the Avengers' chairperson, the media expects him to take responsibility for the team. It isn't fair, but people demand a lot of him, and you said it yourself—I do get into trouble.

"Okay," Tony says, and then after too long a pause, he adds, "Thank you," because it seems like what he's supposed to say.
His chest is whole, no bone-punch circle; his fingers are here; his face is fine. The nightstand beside his hospital bed holds an earpiece and a glass of water. When he reaches for the glass of water, his hands are shaking, which is a reaction he thought he'd coded out of himself. Tony Stark 3.0 may be close, but he's not here yet.

"You can't tell me you aren't angry at him. He could have come to any one of us for help."
TS: I keep telling you: if you want a real challenge, you should let me wear the armor.
TS: Nothing. Just something I've been thinking about.
He goes to his workshop.
It is. Registration is the law. We—superheroes, peacekeepers, Avengers—don't get to decide what's legal. We only get to decide how we're going to comply.
Socks and shoes accomplished, he collects a hat and then upon second thought retreats back to the bathroom to shave. Without the cover of facial hair, he almost doesn't recognize himself. He can't remember the last time he met his own eyes in a mirror. He can't remember the last time he
This is a new iteration of the team. After… what happened last fall, letting the team fall apart had been more an inevitability than a choice. Steve had been the one to come to him, to tell him that the world needed the Avengers, and Tony had agreed, because the secret is that Tony will always need the Avengers just as much as the world, has always needed the Avengers more than the Avengers need him. Any effort he makes to keep his distance is marked to fail before it starts.
It's the same old dance. Reactive, predictive, preventive, prescriptive. How do you react to what's coming? By anticipating it. Once you anticipate it, how do you respond to it? By understanding it. Once you understand it, how do you prevent or even change the outcome? That's the million-dollar question.
BIRCH: Is it a coincidence that all three of them have been or currently are on Stark Industries' payroll?
"Three dead, two seriously injured."
DAEDALUS: Will they live through that?
TS: She's definitely not my gal. Pretty brilliant, though.
He takes a step onto the grass and halts there, caught in a chiaroscuro between the shadows of the Mansion and the diffuse sunlight of late afternoon. Something hits Cap like a shock; Tony can read it in his face. It's a realization:
He builds the best kind of What If. He starts with his hand, his right hand, so he can do the fine motor work with his left. The hand is an ideal test site: should any part of the process fail, he can replace his fingers or palm or the whole entire thing with a conventional prosthetic while he revises and replicates his process.
was going to happen—
PASSIVE MODE //
"We couldn't risk them getting that close to detained resistors," Iron Man says. "Or let them into the Negative Zone complex—they could be weeks in there before we'd find them."
Tony builds a symphony of justification. The third movement goes like this:
He's in the old Avengers suite. Nobody lives here anymore, except for Iron Man, who sometimes haunts it like a ghost. The sink is so spotless he can see his reflection in it—almost like Jarvis was here again to clean up behind the cavalcade of heroes who saved the world on their stomachs. Instead, now, it's only spotless because Avengers Tower is empty.
It was still raining, and Cap's six pallbearers looked just as soaked and miserable as the horse that came before them. Of course, the weather didn't really matter; they would've been just as miserable on a balmy beach with clear skies and warm winds. Misery likes to travel. You'd recognize most of those pallbearers if you've picked up a newspaper in the past decade: King T'Challa, Ben Grimm of the Fantastic Four, Colonel Carol Danvers herself, and of course Sam Wilson, Cap's partner. The fifth, less recognizable but no less pedigreed, was Rick Jones; the sixth was a man simply identified as a 'friend.' He looked to be about Cap's age and was no less miserable than the rest.
"Then what is it about?" Sue's suddenly ferocious. "Tell me, Tony. Make me understand
"Password, boss?"
HH: Right.
"Danvers is right," he says. "We need to shut the problem down before it progresses any further. Hill, you're still detaining Barton?"
TS: What is it?
"I don't mean that," he says. "But get Kooning to get Hill off our backs. I need time."
"Because it was better than being Tony Stark for one more day," Steve echoes. "So you sat down in the snow to die." A pause. He continues gently, so gently: "It's a shame it didn't take, isn't it?"
TS: Here, give her this, it's the specs for hardening the building against EM pulses.
At the doorway, Stevie twists around. "Coming?" she asks.
to let the most advanced military applications in the world fall into the hands of
STARK: I don't follow.
"Boss?" Friday whispers in his ear.
"I have a few tricks of my own." He lets the underarmor leach out of his skin; even shutting the armor down can't cut him off from the nano-fluid stored in his bones. It's based on a redesign of some old contracting work he did with Askew-Tronics back when this kid was still in diapers; the original product was susceptible to control by hostile A.I., but Tony's made some upgrades. If it won't stop a projectile—and it should—then the healing factor he wrote into himself with Extremis will take care of any subsequent damage. "And I don't think your program's all that sophisticated," he continues. "Don't get me wrong, you've still managed to outperform most of the global brain trust, but you can do one thing and one thing only. If you were capable of making me dance like a puppet, Gorlovich would already be a smear on the pavement."
"Why are you here? You're here because you're futurists. You're here because you think that the human condition can be
Tony answers by typing into his phone so he doesn't give someone the right impression that he's crazy. DON'T HAVE ONE.
DAEDALUS: Paving the way to a brighter tomorrow.
It is my opinion that Director Stark
"It's what he'd want," she continues. She's so calm about it. How is she so calm? "There's no reason to drag this out and make him suffer. You can make it an equipment malfunction. Or not; you can fool the monitors. Maybe he just… fades."
ROGERS: I made my peace with that a long time ago.
"Clear," Tony announces, and he eases himself around the next corner.
Steve looks wary, but Tony doesn't wait for him to answer. "I fabricated an identity, contacted the Miami branch, and started selling patents to Stark Industries. Small stuff at first. Better circuitry for coffeemakers, that kind of thing. Dad didn't figure it out until I sold him the design for an ECCM subsystem to go in his latest surface-to-air missile. He was angry, but in retrospect, I think he was also impressed at how brazen I was."
He spends the rest of the meeting redesigning the phone in his head. See, that's the thing: what Tony builds is not, generally speaking, for consumer use. It's too much, too big or too small, too flashy or too utilitarian, too expensive or too complicated. Over the years, he and Pepper have worked out a system. Tony invents, and Pepper sweeps in behind him, picks over his workshop, picks out what's new, what's marketable, and what's going to be relegated to the toy pile. Tony understands this system; he goes in the toy pile himself, being too much, too flashy, too utilitarian, too expensive, and too complicated for general consumption.
SR: We may not be a family team in the same sense as the Fantastic Four, but the Avengers are a family.
DAEDALUS: And you think this will improve our chances of survival.
hovers somewhere between the realms of abstract concept and fairy tale.
"Aw, did you watch the Disney movie too many times?" Tony teases, and then, when Steve looks blank, says, "Don't worry, we'll watch it together. I thought Merlin was a hero when I was a kid, too. Maybe he knew Arthur had to be born, though. Maybe he didn't see any other way."
"I'm not thinking clearly." The admission costs him; he couldn't have confessed to anyone other than his holy ghost.
cancer? What about your unfortunate ability to forget your mom's birthday? What about pain? What about
All prelude. He no longer feels concern, because concern is the province of men who flinch. Tony can't afford concern. He's sitting on the bank of the Rubicon right now, and across the river is Camlann, and if Steve were here listening he'd laugh at how Tony mingles history with myth. Mixing metaphors, that's what he's doing. It's another glitch, one of those abhorrent structural defects that comes with being human.
He can't get the angle right, so he tugs up his pantleg and assesses the geometry again. In a few minutes, Maya's going to trigger a missile attack on the East Coast. His saving grace would be that he's safe in the Midwest, removed from Atlantic affairs no matter how anchored he might be, but in this What Is he'll die anyway thanks to Maya's taste for immolation.
Tony's anger is like his old bum heart. It flares wildly, a pure white starscream that quickly refracts into the acid green of shame and the ceaseless violet of grief. Tony doesn't have the energy to sustain his anger for long. He doesn't have the power to direct it outwards; it always collapses inward on itself. The red light of his anger can never escape the black hole of his despair.
"You can't," Tony says.
"Anything for you, Tony," Steve says, and then his big hands touch Tony's leg: one braced just above his ankle, the other around his toes. At least if he's going to die, he gets to die with Steve touching him.
