“Tony, it´s okey. We´ll just shower and then you can rest again.” He slowly moved his hands down my body before he sopped at my thighs right under my buttocks. I arched my back and whined in his skin as he gave me squeeze before he went into a sitting position with me on his lap. Steve gave me a warning growl. I pouted at that because things wouldn´t have gotten heated in the first place if he hadn´t made a grab for my ass. Steve just smiled at me and hoisted us up from the bed before he made his way to the bathroom.
“Hey, hey, calm down. I´m sorry, I didn´t intent to insult you.” I stepped closer and layed a hand on his shoulder. “Of course you are strong. You´re even one of the bravest and strongest man I know. You saved the world, Tony, multiple times. I´m proud to be your friend.”
“Try to sleep, Tony. It was an exhausting day and you didn´t get much sleep lately.” I gave up my fight against his grip and decided to just let myself have this moment as I knew it wouldn´t last very long until Steve would see what a mess I was and leave me behind to get the live he deserved. Besides Steve´s lap was also very comfortable and it just seemed easier to stay where I was.
“You both reek so stop complaining and get closer together.” My arm brushed against Steve´s and before we could do much more, Nat had pulled the sweater over our heads. I got my arm in the left sleeve and Steve got the other one. The sweater was in a pale pink and had words sewed onto it ‘This is our get along shirt’ well jokes on us. I glared at the team who all tried and failed to hold in their laughter.
Tony woke up several times last night, dreaming about his dad and waking up shivering. He could slowly feel his headspace creeping up on him, but he refused to play Little. Now he was sitting in another boring meeting with Natasha, Steve, Clint and Bruce. He sat between Steve and Clint and across from Natasha and Bruce. Steve literally carried him to this stupid meeting, because Tony refused to leave his bed this early in the morning, after all he wasn't able to sleep that night and he was still tired. Now he sat there just in the clothes he had slept in meaning boxers and a shirt and fought to keep his eyes open. They just discussed some stupid things and Tony didn´t even understand why he was sitting here talking about rules for the kitchen ( Yeah, that´s the most important thing the Avengers had to talk about), instead of inventing new weapons or going back to sleep!
I was a disappointment. I remember those words nearly every day. Howard telling me over and over again.
“Ok, baby.” Daddy tickled my tummy one more time before he lifted me up and sat me on his hip. It was kinda scary, because daddy was so big and I was so high up, but he was strong. I knew that, because he Captain´merica and he was a hero, so he would never ever ever let me fall down. But I still put my arms and legs around him. Just to be sure. After all it was still scary.
Yeah and I managed a second chapter today. I kinda like the story because it´s kinda cute. Yeah mostly fluff. ( How often can I write Yeah, before it gets awkward?)
“Sorry, Steve. We didn´t know you bonded. We would never try to take your omega, shield brother. We´re truly sorry for this misunderstanding.” As soon as they were out of sight Steve maneuvered me out of my sit and crowded me against the wall. His eyes were still red and fixated on me. I gave a small whimper and presented my neck towards him almost automatically.
Steve growled "I want to hear nothing but my name when we're like this. You're mine." Oh god Steve was so hot. He moved his hips faster and leaned down to leave hickeys on my skin.
“Lunch. I said you would stop skipping meals and I meant it.” He sat up and put his arms around my neck.
“What do you want, omega?” I rubbed my nose over histhroat. His scent glands were already swollen. I gave a small lick over them still making a rumbling sound. Tony gave a wet gasp. He let me worship his glands for a moment. Falling apart as I switched between sucking and licking.
I gave him an high pitched whine as answer. Steve got on his knees behind me and spread my legs farther apart. I felt so good completely put in place by him positioned as he liked. I tried to push my ass outwards a little bit and I heard his intake of breath as I did so.
Tony kept his eyes closed but wrinkled his nose and pouted adorably probably because I didn´t let him go back to sleep. I smiled. My cute little boy. He already had me wrapped around his finger.
Some minutes passed before he rinsed the product out and started positioning me. I felt the weight of his big hands settle on my shoulders and he directed me to stand with my front to the wall and my backside pointing towards him. A shudder passed my lips as his hands slid along my arms before they took hold of my hands and placed them on the wall. I felt his body against mine as he leaned forward and pressed his face against my neck so I could feel his warm breath ghost along my skin as he spoke in a deep aroused voice. “Keep your hands there, okey baby?”
I shut the alarm off and lay an arm around my sweetheart. I gently pulled the stressed baby closer and tried to soothe him.
I cocked an eyebrow and talked back angrily.“Yes, Clint. I wouldn´t have mated with him if he didn´t wanted to.” I left the room to prepare vegetables and some meat. After I finished I went back to my room. Tony was still sleeping peacefully.
“You kept care of me all day, strong Alpha.” His nose touched mine and our mouths were just inches apart.
After some time Clint and Natasha went to their rooms too and left Steve and me alone. Suddenly Steve turned his head and looked at me.
“That won´t happen. Go to bed, Tony.” His voice was soft but I stayed strong. Why did I even allow him to have the only door which Jarvis couldn´t open. Damn it.
“I`m fine. I think I´ll go down to my lab and finish some things.” I stood up, but he grabbed my wrist.
Daddy turned us around and lifted my shirt up. Then he leaned down and blew a raspberry. I couldn´t hold my laughter. We played for a while and when daddy stopped teasing me, I had tears in my eyes. It was so much fun.
We went to the kitchen and I started making breakfast. I expected him to sit down on one of the chairs and wait for me to finish, but he stood near me the whole time. I made bacon with scrambled eggs and gave him most of the food. No one could tell how many meals he already skipped.
“But the plan went perfectly, we had it all decked! Until you decided you knew what was best for the team, changed the plan and nearly got killed!”
Before he could get any sadder I scooped him up and held him close to my chest. “Shh, it´s okey. I´m here baby.” He hid his face in my shoulder. I started rocking him in my embrace. He got quieter until the only thing I heard were sobs.
I started fidgeting. Were there any projects I needed to finish. Well SI would just announce our next release in two weeks. What about updates for the team. Maybe I should give Nat something as an apology, but she was the one who brought me into this situation. Ugh, damn. Why was it so freaking quiet. Math, math will help. Easy. 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 “512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536”
He dreamed that night, but not about the aliens attacking the world or seeing his best friend fall down the train and he wasn´t able to save him. No, he actually had a good dream. He saw his mother smiling and laughing as they sat in their kitchen with family and friends. Even tough they never had enough money, she always managed to make the best out of every situation andof course he also dreamed about Tony.
“Eat up and you´ll get your reward.” I started feeding him small bits an he kept making those cute little moans while eating. He finished within five minutes. I lied the plate on a small table and captured his lips.
“When I started cooking. I stopped for some minutes to check on you and you started clinging onto me and didn´t let go.”
I looked back down at my baby and decided to bring him a pacifier. I found some on the internet which were made for adults and they were even avenger themed. I sat down next to my boy. The bed sinking in a little bit at my added weight and gently pulled his thumb away from his mouth. He frowned and tried to move with his head after his thumb, but before he could suck on his finger again. I rubbed the pacifier on his lips. He opened his mouth and accepted it.
“Tony, why do you already feel the need to annoy me. At least try to make this work.” Once again I was at the receiving end of one of his ‘Captain-America-is-disappointed-in-you’ glares and I didn´t even intend to get on his nerves.
I opened my eyes as I heard my distressed baby cry out for me. My alarm clock had gone off, as I usually would have gone for a morning jog and already stood up at 4, because I didn´t need much sleep. Since my baby hadn´t gotten much sleep in the last days, it clearly had woken him up too early and Tony surely didn´t like it at all. Tears welled up in his eyes and he started wailing. His face turned red and he sniffed.
“You aren´t…ah…tired?” I said the words in one hot breathe against Tony´neck. He shuddered in response.
Steve growled louder. “Don´t look at my omega.” He took some more steps and his growl increased in volume. If someone didn´t act fast, this situation would end very badly, with a possible code green.
I groaned. “Clint, come on I´m an adult. I´m the head of an industry which owns millions a day. Do you really think I´m gonna watch a movie with you.” The thing was I really didn´t want to watch movies. I wanted to go into my workshop and invent something, then I would drink til the sun rise and I could start again.
“You two have been fighting for months. I don´t think you ever had a normal conversation. In order to change that we´re going to try something. You two will spend the next 24 hours together and if you fail to stay together in this sweater well let´s just say you really don´t want that to happen. Now come here.”
“Let´s sit down Tones. It´s going to be just another boring day. Completely normal. There´s nothing for them to see.” I rolled my eyes and stuck my tongue out to Clint. We sat back down on the couch. Steve took a book from the side table and started reading.
"Beutiful." He did nothing but look at me. I tried to move my hips and get some friction but Steve was faster and held me down. He leaned over me and grabbed something out of his sports bag. Steve moved down on me and finally he licked one beautiful stripe over my aching cock. I nearly came then and there, before I had the cvance to stop him I felt a pressure around my hard one. I looked up. A cock ring. "Steve, not." I whined.
I knocked on the closed doors, but there was no reaction. I waited some minutes and tried to get a glance of Tony trough the glass, but because the lights in the workshop were dimmed down and there was no guarantee that he wasn´t in one of the side rooms of the lab or around a corner, I wasn´t able to see him.
I snapped out of my calm state as a loud growl ripped through the calm atmosphere. I looked at Steve. With blood tinted eyes and tensed muscles his whole being screamed danger. I felt a whine escape my lips and tried to follow his gaze to see what was disrupting this domestic moment.
We followed Clint and he stopped in front of a big hall. “Here.” He gave us some bags and pointed to another room. “There are changing rooms. Come back when you´re ready.”
“So you´ll wake me up?” Please don´t, I kinda enjoy being snuggled up with you in bed and just resting.
I got to work. Tony refused to look at me while I got him out of his clothes and into a diaper. I might or might not have watched some videos on how to change a diaper. I got him into an old shirt of mine which was very soft and too big on him and left his legs bare. Of course Jarvis got me also some onezies but I would leave them for later. We would start small for the beginning.
I grabbed his shoulders just to have something to hold on. What the hell? I thought I was supposed to be the playboy and now he managed to overwhelm me. But I still wanted to feel more. I grabbed his shirt and shoved it up. He let me but before I could do more he had my hands pinned down against the couch and my shirt torn apart. He held me down with one hand and moved the other one over my abdomen. I shiveeed and panted hard.
“Yes, just yours.” He came closer until I could feel his hot breath on my skin. “Only yours, always. Don´t want anyone else, just you.”
“See something you like?” He stopped right in front of me an looked intensely into my eyes. My blood started rushing downwards and I nearly growled. My inner-alpha demanding to mount and claim the willing omega.
Tony looked at me unbelievably and I gave him my best I´m-being-honest expression. “C´mon, I don´t have all day, Ironman.” (It broke my heart inside. OMG my sweetheart looked like he was going to cry, but I had to do this.) Tony dropped to the floor and started doing the push-ups.
Oh, that felt good. He started massaging harder. Kneading my cheeks and occasionally pulling the skin so that my hole stretched around him and I made more moans.
It was friday night, movie night, and the team was sitting on and around the couch. As soon as I sat down Tony crawled into my lap what gave me the opportunity to pet and cradle him. He didn't seem to mind it at all and already started drifting off.
I didn´t saw Tony for the next four days until team training on Friday. He even missed movie night on Wednesday. Natasha told me that we should better get our act together or she would make us. That was slightly frightening but I brushed it off and just gave her a bowl of popcorn.
“I´m happy too, Tony.” Steve laughed and hugged me tighter to his body. His strong arms keeping me close. Yeah, shit forgot he could hear what I thought. That´s gonna be funny.
“You´ll be mine Tony, forever.” His eyes turned red and I shivered again. His hands held me in place.
I´m sorry if it´s a little late. I just wanted this chapter to meat my expectations (maybe they´re a little low, I mean I eat green food and yes it´s green because I bought it probably years ago.)
“NO! You brought me into this room. You gotta bring me out, right now! Not staying in the same room with this... thing.”
“I … want to feel you inside me, please...ahh there. Want your knot and your claim on me. Please, alpha, ahh…” Tears already started to form in Tony´s eyes. I leaned up still pinning him down with one hand on his trembling stomach and shoved my pants and sweatpants down. Tony´s gaze fell immediately to my cock. I was already hard. Surprise. I got down to Tony again and started pulling the lingerie from his body. It was beautiful but I needed him to be completely naked for the first time.
“You know what, alright. That´s just what I´m going to do.” It took Steve one second to get his left arm around my waist and he stood up. It happened so suddenly I had to sling my legs around his middle to keep me from falling down.
I felt something in my mouth. When did I put it there. I tried to suck on it. It felt…good. I said hello to daddy but my voice sounded funny. But I wanted to say hello to daddy and that didn´t work while having the thing in my mouth so I grabbed it and sat it between us and looked up at daddy.
“Don´t be, Tony. You went trough a lot. It´s just normal to feel like this.” He gave me an encouraging smile. I tried to smile back.
After more minutes he pulled his fingers out. He stood up and got naked as well before positioning his cock in front of my hole. He looked into my eyes and pushed all in in one long and slow thrust. His cock was longer and bigger than anything I've ever had inside of me before and it still burned even tough he prepped me, but at the same tim it felt better then everything I've ever felt and I knew that he ruined me for anyone else. He was the only one who could make me feel this way.
It lasted an hour. Every time one of us moved we moaned and come shot from my cock between us. I mewled and whined the whole time. Caressed in Steve´s lap. With his pole stick shoved deep inside me. I felt so hot and kept unconsciously rubbing my body against his muscular wide chest.
Tony looked upset up at me, but before he could start crying, I grabbed the toy duck I had mentioned earlier and gave it to him. He curiously started inspecting it and while he played I had the chance to wash him. When I finished I grabbed a towel and my baby boy out of the tub and dried him. I put a diaper onto him and brought him back into my bedroom where I sat him down for a minute to show him one of the onesies.
“Alpha, please.” My legs were shaking and I took hold of his shoulders trying to get him closer to my needy form. “Shhh, I got you. It´s okey, I´m just gonna clean you. Keep calm. Goog, you´re doing so great Tony. So good for me.” I preened at his praise. After the situation settled a bit he reached for a bottle and started massaging the contents into my hair. I purred as I figured out that it was his shampoo he was using and that I would smell like him. Surely with the mating bite too no one would ever mistake either of us for available. No. We both took our claim.
A third finger worked his way into me. Steve still held back and I pushed my bidy back against his fingers until he helb me down once again.
I sunk forward and Steve easily caught me in his arms, before he slowly lied back down and pulled a blanket over our forms. I gave him some more whines and moans as the movement shifted his knot inside of me and it ended up steadily milking my prostate. I got one mor dry orgasm and passed out afterwards.
“Stop it!” He grabbed my hand and held onto it. I tried to pull it back but there wasn´t enough room and he had an iron grip. “Start acting like a grown up.”
Steve's hand dusappeared between my cheeks and one finger started rubbing against my hole before pushing in.
Natasha started talking again. “I didn´t want to do this but something has to change. Clint Code:alpha379” Clint left the room and a shiver ran through my body. Bruce and Thor sat down on another couch watching everything interested.
I didn't hear someone coming in, but I looked up when I felt a familiar weight sink into the couch right beside me. Steve sat a gym back down at the floor and gave me one of his brilliant smiles. He looked happy but there was also something else in his expression. He wore a tight shirt and kargo shorts(ugh i thought we already talked about those) i still don't know how he manages to look so hot in those.
“You´re going to eat something, Tony. Breakfast is the most important meal and you are already way too skinny.” He blushed just as cute as yesterday.
Steve kissed my forehead. “Don´t worry it already stopped.” He lifted my ass and pulled his cock out of me. I moaned. Come went slowly out of my hole and on Steve´s thigh. He put his arms around me and I closed my eyes. My body was sore and I was really tired. I immediately fell asleep.
Tony smiled at me. He was so cute, blushing like he had anything to be ashamed of. I would spend every single night of my life sitting here with him just to see this smile and it wasn´t one of his fake ones he showed the press. No, this one was one of his beautiful smiles which showed his true emotions which just were true Tony. The warm feeling in my stomach spread. He´s the most lovely person I knew. He deserved to be taken care of after everything he did for us. He was truly a hero. Even tough he always tried to play it cool I knew what an amazing personality he had, caring about us the same way the team cared about him. Always doing everything to save everyone. He would even pay with his life. Sometimes I just wished he would give himself more credit for all the wonderful things he did and kept better care of him. I didn´t know what I would do if I would lose him. The battle of New York still haunted my dreams. Seeing him lying there I felt as if my heart stopped beating for a moment. But I shouldn´t think about that now.
I murmured “You´re already my everything, sweetheart.” and gave him a peck on his head before I closed my eyes again.
He needed the time to be shown he was worth it and that he deserved to be cared for. That he could trust me and at some point the whole team (well not like I would ever exchange the caretaker-role with anyone else, not even someone on the team. Tony´s MY precious boy). That it was the right thing to do to accept his little headspace and how good it would be for him.
It’s not an exaggeration to say it feels like they fucking deep-fried his arms and legs in hot, sparkling oil. It burns something terrible, and Tony’s screaming before he can mute the helmet’s speakers, before he can stop the world from knowing just how bad it hurts.
“No,” he countered. She was right. She couldn’t be around him for much longer, not if she was going to live the long and lovely life Tony wanted so badly for her. It burned like hell in his heart but he knew he was doing it to protect her when he said, callous and cold, “I don’t see why you can’t. Door is to your left.”
Tony leaned forward, still not brave enough to shut his lids like he should for a proper kiss. But in hindsight, that was for the best.
“I bid you farewell, then.” He hears the demigod exit the room, quietly humming the same Asgardian song of victory he does after every successful battle. Steve can’t help smiling beside himself. It’s endearing is all, even if he’s gonna be hurting for a few hours.
Without any hesitation, he blasted down through the floors by sheer force, feeling the carpet and ceilings shatter around him, unphased because that was his fucking kid, who gives half a shit about whether or not there’s an iron-man shaped hole?
Tony can breathe Tony is always breathing he’s always breathing when Steve watches him work in his shop and breathe over the comm line in the middle of a mission and he’s breathing in Steve’s dreams when he leans in to kiss him like he can’t in real life and what
“Hey— be careful, okay? The buildings rigged to blow at the moment, Macgyver, so just chill out.” Cutting the power to his thrusters, Tony lowered himself onto the roof
Bruce nods. Though Steve interpreted it as a simple affirmation, it was apparently a cue for Clint to remove the puffy white straps on his wrists. Steve feels the ache settle even deeper in his chest when he sees how shaky the usually rock-steady hands of the archer are. When his arms are revealed to the dim, med-bay overhead lights, he can see the mottled shades of blue and purple where he must have pulled too hard on the restraints. But Steve doesn’t really care. Doesn’t even really care if they heal. Doesn’t really care about much.
He rockets up into the sky, feeling the armor shift around him to make the aerodynamics optical for his ascent. It’s an addictive feeling, though he won’t admit just how much he loves it. In his experience, when he admits his feelings, they usually get ripped away.
Peter, Rhodey, and Pepper are just getting out of the car when he and Steve emerge from their quaint little abode, hand-in-metal-hand.
Just a moment of peace. Sixty simple seconds. Because that’s all Tony can have before JARVIS’ voice crackles over the speakers, uncharacteristically quiet.
“JARVIS, I swear to God, I’ll dismantle your software if you don’t just tell me what the fuck is happening!” It’s an empty threat, of course, but Tony’s patience is running thinner by the minute. His head is throbbing like a bass riff in a club he’s way too old to be at, and he just wants to wrap it up so he can go home.
Like a broken bone that would never be set was forced to heal in a new, awkward, not-right-this-was-never-supposed-to-happen shape.
Tony’s strained breath is the only sound in the otherwise silent room he’s being held in. He counts his inhales, counts his exhales, and holds it because there’s just nothing else to do. He even gets up to forty seconds before stars dance in front of his vision and he has to breathe again.
They’d gathered back those stupid fucking stones, Bruce had snapped those big green fingers, and they were there. The world was coming alive with faces Tony had never seen but knew from the reactions of those around them that they weren’t ever expected to be seen again.
He doesn’t like to think of the dark. He doesn’t like to think of this cold achiness— so similar to the pressure of space and nukes, and Afghanistan caves. So he thinks of other things.
“When’s the last time you slept, Shellhead?” Natasha asks, making him jump a little as he comes out of his thoughts. Jesus, maybe they’d find him a little faster if Tony could just fucking focus for once in his goddamn life. “You don’t look so good.”
“We can’t breathe,” he whispers to her, as loud as he can through his empty chest. He closes his eyes because everything starts to spin and swirl and make no sense anymore. “Tony… I can’t breathe!”
Tony didn’t move, even after they left. He watched them drive off into the distance, staring at the wheels and the bumpers and how together the whole machine was. How alive the people inside it were.
howdy, y’all🤠🤠🤠 thanks for your patience! i’m very, very unhappy with how this chapter turned out but that’s the way it goes.
He’ll just have to tell him when he wakes up. When, not if. Because Steve can’t stay awake, but he also won’t make Tony cry a second time. He just won’t.
She was unmoved. For the briefest second, her face was a blank slate. Then she exploded, “Can you cut the bullshit act for ten fucking seconds? Or are you physically fucking incapable?”
Tony isn’t breathing in his dreams. He’s bloody, bruised, purple, veins exploding from his face in violent shades of green and blue. Not to mention his eyes— the eyes that move, but never blink. A dead man’s eyes.
“Pete? You okay?” Tony asked, tentative. When there was no response, he continued, firmer, “Peter? Come in. What’s—“
“Tony,” Steve amended, a small grin quirking up the corner of those very, very kissable lips (that he for sure, for sure should most definitely not be looking at because that is so not going to happen because even if Captain fucking America wasn’t straighter than Clint’s goddamn arrows, he definitey wouldn’t be into a man with a history like his.)  “What I’m trying to say is that I’m sorry. All that stuff that I said to you when we met---”
“Comin’ up behind you, Mister Stark!” the kid called, whooping while he swung past way too fast for Tony’s liking around the skyscraper.
That’s not to say it hadn’t been a close thing. It’d taken hours of careful planning, lying, and collection of inconspicuous but volatile ingredients on Tony’s part. But he’d played Baldie like a fucking fiddle in the end.
thank you all for being with me through my first ever marvel fic!!! i had an absolute blast writing it, and if you have requests or ideas for my next fic, i’d love to hear it.
He’s laboring the day (or maybe night, he’s not really sure) away in his workshop, sewing together a new kind of fabric for Bruce’s uniform with the utmost concentration when Steve walks through the door— not holding his notebook in hand.
He’d loved Steve for a long time. Maybe his whole life. Sometimes it felt like longer. And for a while there, Tony had himself fooled that maybe America’s hottest super soldier (full offense intended to the man who murdered his mom) could love him back.
“How?” Steve demands in response. He knows he should wait; should take a breath and pull it together, but Tony’s dead and he just can’t. “It’s not like we ever told him! He saved all of our asses a million times over—“ he has to stop, release the choked sob crawling it’s way up his breathless lungs. “He saved all of our lives, and we didn’t even say thank you— did we?”
And he really loves it now in the dead of the night, as he’s crawling out under the bottom of an iron-barred window, ribs scraping up on the cement when he finally squeezes in tight enough to fall through the open gap. He hears his body hit the ground more than he feels it. Adrenaline is a funny thing.
“Hang on, kid!” he’d yelled, hoping the speakers were loud enough to carry his voice through the raging wind. He doubted it, but he couldn’t stop himself. Peter had to know he was coming, had to know he wasn’t going to die, had to never feel the same demon Tony did, and never understand what it felt like to break all the bones in his body against the hard cement. “Almost there!”
It was impossible, and it came with side effects (namely a homicidal Titan and his unfortunately large army.) But they’d done it anyway.
Steve loves Tony so much it aches, because Tony keeps his promises. The genius closes the distance between them in a millisecond, and all Steve can feel is the stinging relief of his scalp as it’s absolved of Ass Clown’s grip. And then the wonderful, musical noise that is the whir of the repulsor being fired and that fucker’s scream.
Then he felt Steve touch him. Felt the same old flame of love and pain engulf him. Felt Steve hold him up by the waist and by his arm, keeping him secure. Safe.
Protocol Snake Skin was something they’d built together after Tony’s first breakthrough with nanotechnology. At Peter’s command, he could remove the suit and apply it to fit over whatever person (or object) he wanted to cover.
The genius, though inebriated off his ass, wasn’t a complete idiot and therefore wasn’t convinced. “Then why— why didn’t you ever call me?”
“Just tell me what I’m looking at, J.” Things were tense at the tower right now, and he didn’t want to ask anyone for help. Even breakfast, a notoriously enjoyable occasion amongst their team, had been a strained thing when he left from it this morning to attend a business meeting. A business meeting that, evidently, wasn’t worth waking up at the ungodly hour of seven a.m. for on account of the fact that no sales were closed and he was dragging himself and his ruined, expensive suit from the bloody sidewalk.
“Isn’t this workshop technically in a basement?” Clint thankfully pipes up before Tony can spiral completely out of control, voice muffled by the couch cushions where he’s laying.
“It was a car crash,” the officers informed him after getting out the initial “Your parents are dead—sorry!” speech.
However, those good deeds don’t change the fact that sometimes (every time), when Steve wakes up from a nightmare, he finds his blankets ripped to shreds. Or that he’ll casually crush coffee mugs when he picks them off the counter, simply because he wasn’t thinking about controlling his arm’s muscles in the moment.
Her breath hitched a little, and Tony felt his fragile, unfortunately existent heart break when she whispered, “Promise me that you’re not going to regret it in the end.”
Steve is about to undoubtedly make a very, very witty, not at all pathetic reply, but (thankfully) doesn’t get the chance. Because, rather abruptly, there’s a deafening boom, and an Iron-Man shaped hole in the wall.
And Tony’s just watching him with those dead man’s eyes from behind a sheet of glass; a sheet of glass that Steve can’t destroy, no matter how hard he beats on it. His hands ache and bleed, but the glass doesn’t break.
Tony saw him. The scene was silent. Serene. Peter was freshly out of the suit, if the ends of the armor retreating from his fingertips were anything to go by. He was kneeling, coaxing the metal around the black package in the corner.
“I loved him!” he yells, and fuck it’s really hitting now. The weight of what he doesn’t have anymore, sinking down through his skin, crushing his organs, flatlining his heart. He thinks of Tony’s smile, and he thinks this is what it’s like to be buried alive. “I loved him— and he’s never gonna know! I can’t fucking tell him! I’ll never get to tell him!”
“And I hate not having a crowd of adoring Americans to welcome me home,” he shot back, grinning although he didn’t really want to. He was thinking of Yinsen. His last words weighed heavy on Tony’s mind, try as he might to think of anything else. They were gonna make him do something crazy. “Call a press conference for me, would you?”
But Tony understands people say things they don’t mean in the heat of the moment and he doesn’t hold it against Steve. Steve, who tastes like fresh water. Steve, who slips into a Brooklyn accent when he’s flustered.
Sliding all his vodka bottles out of view onto the floor beneath his bed was no easy task to accomplish in just a few seconds, but he’d had practice over the thousands of dorm searches over the years.
Rushing to finish deactivating a delicate explosive is rarely, if ever, a good plan. But Tony could say without a doubt in his mind that he was the most desperate he’d ever been, and he finished in a fury as a result.
“Don’t,” Tony broke in, voice cracking. He couldn’t take it. He could apparently take a lot more than he thought, but he knew without a doubt in his mind he couldn’t fucking handle this. “Don’t tell me you love me because—“
He also sees the incredible beauty, too. He sees it above all else. The big, brown Bambi eyes, the thick and glistening lashes growing just above and below them, the perfect curve of his chin and lips.
They all laugh a little, breathing in the thick pine air on each inhale, and revel in how everything just feels alright.
“How are you feeling, Tony?” There’s a click of some buttons behind him before his bed is elevating into a reclined position; finally bringing the world into focus. The doctor bustles around, checking his IV’s (he didn’t know he had IV’s, god fucking dammit he hates IV’s.) “Hopefully a little less concussed?”
It was a short flight, and so he hardly had any time to pull himself together before they were landing on the balcony, but he did his best. Took a deep breath, attempted to quiet Death who was screaming her want in his ear. She wanted the boy in his arms. She liked him.
“Karen, activate Snake Skin protocol,” Peter murmured, not trying to speak over Tony’s deafening protests, beyond justifying himself. He’d made up his mind. And Tony, elbow deep in a bomb that would blow instantaneously if he stopped what he was doing, was powerless to do anything but shout.
And when Tony felt death budge past him like someone slipping through a crowd (headed for his Peter, headed for his sun and stars), he didn’t think. He just flew as fast as he could, until his hands were around the kid, cradling him into his armored shoulder, clutched tight in his metal hands and they were racing towards the exit.
JARVIS’ voice is clear as a bell (Jesus, he could use a volume adjuster) when it comes through the display. “Sir, you appear to be suffering a mild to moderate concussion and several first degree burns. I’d advise you immediately contact the team for back—“
And Tony is so goddamn pathetic, because he calls Fury right back to demand answers for how long he’s going to be gone.
Tony couldn’t imagine a kingdom. Maybe he was just too young, but looking at the box that was supposed to hold Jarvis’ body underneath the ground, he couldn’t see it in his mind’s eye.
Falling out the twenty story window while Tony watched him, as if in slow motion; the kid’s innocent eyes blown wide, face an expression of pure, instinctual terror. The face of someone seeing death.
Most of the days Tony was very calm and he stayed cool even if you told him you broke his table because you jumped out of the vents and had a bad landing(Clint) or that you broke something because you used too much strength(Thor, me, Peter, Wade, the X-Men, etc.) I think you get what I'm trying to say, but there were still some things he was a little bit too protective over. For example the couch.
“Yeah, but you need to understand that even a brilliant and talented genius like you needs to eat and sleep.”
It took me a moment, but Tony waited. He would always wait for me. I stood up with him still in my arms. I would never let him go again and I wouldn´t ever have to. I felt his legs go around my waist and his mouth giving me kisses all over my jaw and then down my throat. I walked out of the living room and headed to my room. Soon it will be our room.
Steve returned his attention back to Tony who already closed his eyes. Steve sighed. Why didn´t Tony just accept his needs?
I turned my head to the side and looked back at the room. I started feeling a little bit colder and shuffled closer to Steve shoving my legs to my body rolling up like a cat. Steve took the blanket from before and spread it over me. I watched the dust grains move in the air drawing their paths through the room. Some minutes passed and I heard Steve sigh and he moved one hand over my eyes. I had no choice but to close my eyes. He started massaging my temple with his thumb.
She loved me somehow or she had hoped I was the key to let Howard give her the time of the day. Give him an heir and get loved for it.
I can´t let Steve see me like this. Maybe there was still a chance that he didn´t figure it out. Maybe I could save our friendship. I needed to save it. I can´t let him figure it out as soon as he knew he would be disgusted and leave me. I needed to get my act together and never let him see what a mess I am again.
“Come over here.” He held his hand out to me and I couldn´t deny him anything when he looked at me like that. I took some steps forward and wanted to sit down, but a hand grabbed me and pushed me flat on the couch with my head pillowed in Steve´s lap.
Steve hugged me. I immediately felt safer. His warm body covering my smaller frame perfectly. “I´m so sorry. It´ll get better, I promise.” My eyes started to get wet. I tried to stop but Steve already recognized it. “Oh Tony, don´t cry, sweetheart. I´ll help you. We will find a solution, I promise.”
He wore a blue t-shirt which sat tight on his body. I was able to see every single one of his muscles. I asked myself how it would be to touch his skin and feel his muscles under my palm.
“Tony, stop doing that. Of course it´s my business. I care about you and I just want your best. Tony...just let me help you.” He looked up and stared into my eyes, searching for anything saying that this was a joke, but i was completely honest.
Most of the team was outside doing some shopping or whatever they are doing. I grabbed a hot mug coffee and just sat down on my couch. Finishing some designs on my tablet and watching a movie in the background. Just to have some sounds.
“Steve?” Why did my voice sound so vulnerable. Steve turned his head to meet my eyes. I freaking blushed. “How are you.”
Not gone as in dead. God, if that were true, Tony doesn’t know what the hell he’d do. No, Steve’s gone as in taken. As in a month ago, Steve went in for a stupid, stupid, not-fucking-worth-it SHIELD mission and didn’t come back. As in Fury called a meeting and told them maybe Steve wasn’t ever going home; his whole strike team was found dead in an alley but Steve’s body wasn’t there, Tony, so he might be alright, Tony, he has to be alright so you have to keep looking, Tony.
“Cute?” was his eloquent response, because most of his consciousness was split between the two objectives of remembering how to push oxygen into his lungs and trying to memorize the perfect blue of his unrequited love’s eyes. Oh, God. He was fucked.
He had hoped to catch Tony before he left for his shareholder and sales meetings today, though Fury tripped him up with other plans. He had wanted to apologize for being a bad friend recently (he’s just been in a lot of pain, though he’d never admit that’s why), thank him for not throwing Steve out on his ass for his asshole behavior, and tell him he loved him. Even if he couldn’t tell him just how he loved him, he wanted Tony to at least know Steve loved him as a friend. Tony just always has this look in his eye, like he doesn’t know.
Steve left in a hurry, before he even gave himself the chance to give into temptation to change his mind (think maybe it could work, maybe they’d find a way around the fact that he’s essentially a glorified, fully loaded weapon), scurrying off like the frantic, wounded animal he was. Didn’t find enough courage in his sick, heaving heart to so much as look at Tony while he choked on a bullshit goodbye. He just booked it the hell out of there.
“You’re a real funny guy, Stark,” Baldie had snarled, sounding for the first time like he wasn’t smiling. It didn’t give Tony the satisfaction he thought he was going to get. His disappointment was immeasurable. “You know what I think is so fucking funny?” When Tony didn’t respond, Baldie just pulled harder on his hair, jerking him to the left like he was a fucking nascar driver’s steering wheel. “Answer me!”
Because they could. When Steve wanted it so bad, and he respected their opinions so much, they stood a real chance at making him turn around and kiss Tony like he had any idea how to.
Tony’s just beginning to think he might not even make it home; has to stop, wrap one shaking hand around screaming ribs and press another to his pounding temples to keep from losing it completely. Fuck, it all hurts like a son of a bitch, and he can hardly stand against it--- let alone keep going. But then he looks up at the clean, night sky. Sees that the Avengers tower is so close.
He just took off towards the tower as fast as he could, desperate to get them both on solid ground, but slowed their speed when he heard Peter’s small hitching breaths and whimpers.
Strangely, there’s an edge of nostalgia to it. Somehow homely. Or, as homely as not being able to breathe can be.
See, the thing about living with extraordinary people, is how extraordinarily stressed out they can all get. And recently, things have just been getting worse and worse for everyone. Bruce has been a shade too green for a few weeks now amidst his failing experiments, Thor uncharacteristically quiet as he wrestles with family issues in wake of another Loki incident, and Natasha seemingly awake at all hours of the night—unable to sleep and unwilling to answer why.
Steve crosses the floor like a man possessed, rounds the corner of his desk so he’s standing over a frankly shells shocked Tony. He drops to his knees as if his legs were made of lead.
“Don’t,” Steve cut in, and Tony wasn’t trying to look at him, promise (he knew he had a tendency to stare when it came to Steve), but he sounded genuinely upset so the genius just couldn’t stop himself. Imagine his surprise when Steve, who usually didn’t much look up from his sketchpad during their talks, was staring back at him; jaw tensed in concern, eyes like two circles of blue, passionate flames. “I hate it when you do that.”
“I’ll um, I’ll stand,” Steve says, knowing if he sits that he’ll feel even more unsteady and unprepared. He tries to take a deep breath through his nose and out his mouth, but it doesn’t do much good. He’s not sure he wants to know, but he asks anyway, “What’s happened?”
“Jesus Christ, give a fella a little warning!” he exclaims, settling a hand on his chest and feeling the pounding pulse there. “You scared the hell out of me.”
“Right, yeah, sorry,” he scrambled, ducking his head, trying to spare whatever rapidly dwindling pride he had left. In this way--- in this one small, insignificant way--- he hated Steve. The guy turned him into an absolute idiot; outstripped his wits with just a few well-placed words, a glance at that earnest expression and he was fucked. It was self-esteem-problem inducing.
Seen more of it than he can say. Delivered it. Brushed it off his own shoulders a thousand times. The Grim Reaper has been an old lover for his whole life; breathed her dark breath into Tony’s face, been the first and last kiss on his lips, taken the air right out of his lungs. Easy as anything.
He’s more than a little concussed, right about now. He doesn’t need to be responsible for a second detonation today.
Steve found him, and for all his credit, he didn’t cry. Just kneeled beside him, put one big, warm palm on the side of his face that wasn’t burned and the other where the arc was. Held him so steady. Laid the softest of kisses on his unmoving mouth.
And that gets to Tony— being shut out (never mind if that’s hypocritical of him.)  It hurts especially because Steve had never shut him out before. They’d grown together over the past couple years like trees in a compact space; twisting up their wounds until the other’s branches could cover them. Steve had held Tony’s hands in the kitchen when they shook at one in the morning after a nightmare. Tony had made a million home adjustments (the heating bill was outrageous) to make sure Steve was never cold enough in his bed, all alone, to be reminded of the ice. They comfort each other, they talk to each other, they take care of each other.
“That’s real sweet, sugar,” Tony says, a false note of humor in his voice he hopes they don’t detect. He doesn’t think any of this is funny, his head fucking hurts, goddammit. “But I think you’re gonna have to get in line.”
“In all honesty, I think I was looking for Howard when I met you,” Steve had admitted, eyes adamantly trained on the pencil he was flipping much too quick for comfort through his fingers. “I just wanted--- I don’t know, maybe it’s stupid. But I just wanted a piece of the past, y’ know? Something like home.”
She took it rougher than anyone other than Steve, but it was to be expected. Tony was her true friend— someone she more than loved. She trusted him. After every selfless thing he’d done for her time and time again; building special holsters for the guns next to her bed so she wouldn't wake up with a hand cramp from holding one, buying out the ballet studio close to their tower and relocating it somewhere else so she wouldn’t ever be reminded of her less-than-stellar childhood, redesigning her battle gear again and again to better protect her, needing her as more than an asset but as a friend, she trusted him.
But he feels some asshole’s hand press down heavy on his chest, pushing him back and effectively erasing his hard-won progress in getting vertical.
“Yeah, pumpkin!” he asks, wiping the sleep from his eyes. Goddamn. He loves his kid. He really does. But he also loves naps.
Something he does think about too much is how fucking stupid he is. Well-intentioned, definitely. But stupid nonetheless.
“There are children in the building, Tony!” Peter interrupted, and oh fuck. Oh fuck. The kid never called him by his first name. But then, an audible calm came over the comms. Tony knew what that meant. Peter was calming because he had an idea. An idea Tony was going to hate, no doubt. “I’m gonna cover the bomb with my suit— it might be enough—“
Tony didn’t look up from where he was making some much needed repairs to his mask. He didn’t want to see her face, read the premature grief there. See himself in what he thought was so beautiful. “Then go.”
The yelp that came from Tony was involuntary, as was the shout that followed when Baldie pressed his other hand against the side of his neck— searing the skin there. “What?” Tony gasped in desperation. A pause filled with just pain, pain, pain. “I don’t know!”
It’s a nice thought, but he still wants to be realistic. They probably won’t be that hurt personally. It’s not like Tony himself is too much to lose.
Just a clench of Steve’s unnaturally big hands could shatter a finger, or a face, or an arc reactor. It’d only take a single millisecond. One miniscule mistake. And Tony would be the one to suffer.
He truly does. He always has, and he always will. From the bottom of the city’s rat infested streets to the tip of its energy-insufficient towers, he loves it.
For the first time in his life, Tony was braver than her. Because Peter belonged to the living. He belonged with Tony, and his Aunt, and his friends. In that moment and any moment after that could endanger the loss of that, he was stronger than death. Better.
“It’s time to go to sleep, Tony,” Steve said, laughing a little, the sound wet. A callback to all the nights they’d spent side by side. All the nights Tony had felt safe.
The funny thing is, a lot of parents have told Steve over the many years that he’s been a national icon (undeservedly in his opinion) about how they use him as a role model to their children. A beacon of good behavior. Of following the rules. Of exemplary morality.
The anticipation is terrible, twisting in his gut. But Tony’s face doesn’t change. His lips barely shift to make room for his words. “Steve, we’re taking you off the sedative now.”
And Steve will smile in amusement; always offer these starstruck mom and dads polite thanks for thinking of him that way.
And Tony wondered how he thought anything had ever mattered (his own mortality, his worries about heaven and hell, whether or not life itself was worth the pain of living) before this, because it was crystal clear to him in that moment that none of it meant anything if death caught his kid before Tony did.
So Tony screamed at Death, because none of it made sense and god damn it all if Tony fucking Stark, the great and terrible genius, couldn’t make sense out of reality. He begged and he begged, wondering how the fuck something as awful as this can happen and no one ever gets to know why.
“Right away, Sir.” Tony knows he’s not imaging how cold the AI manages to sound. Goddammit. Now he’s gotta apologize to a computer (why the fuck he had to make him so sensitive, he’ll never know)— but later, because he’s already wasted precious time. “A detonation occurred roughly two moments ago from the first floor of the building shortly after your exit. It’s reasonably assumable that the bomb’s effects were intended for you, but were unsuccessful.”
But they put a cast around it. Because they were the Avengers. They had to pretend, at least publically, that they weren’t aching just as bad or maybe even worse than everyone else.
Rhodey would go with him quite a lot. He’d only ever met Maria in passing if she came by to the apartment for Tony, and a few times at school funding events that she philanthropated at. But he came with Tony; drove him in his new car that Tony bought him (Rhodey gave in pretty easy when Tony started talking about the safest models at the dealership) and stood a few feet back while his best friend talked to his mom.
“He knew, Steve,” Clint says. The archer won’t look at him; tears falling freely while he gazes off into an unspecified distance. “He had to have known we all loved him.”
But then the Accords had happened. Civil war. Siberia. That fucking shield stuck in his aching chest only to be wrenched back out till he was defenseless.
There’s a somber silence at that. Because they didn’t. They’d nod a little, say “this’ll work” when he built them a new invention that’d be the only reason they didn’t get killed in a mission next week, and dump their shit on his desk when they needed it fixed.
“No!” Tony yelled, a visceral panic filling him at even the thought of his kid exposed, open to the explosives, eaten by the fire or blown through the windows. “Abso-fucking-lutely not! Do you hear me, Parker? Don’t you dare—“
And they definitely wouldn’t have made him an idol to their poor, impressionable kids if they saw Steve leave with no explanation out the door. Past his questioning teammates, wondering why he was so fleeing the joint in such a rush (Bruce was cooking Thai, and everyone stays in on Thai Thursdays.)
And when Tony tried to tell him he didn’t have to save him, that he wasn’t worth the trouble, Rhodey would say something like, “If you stopped making trouble, then there wouldn’t be any trouble,” (Tony knew he didn’t really mind keeping him alive, it was just seeing his friend be sick all the time when he didn’t have to be that bothered him) and keep on taking care of poor, alcoholic Tony like there was nothing to it.
They don’t say so in such direct words, but it’s clear by how they all attempt making transparent excuses about why their presence is required in the common room rather than where they should be sleeping in their beds, seeing as it must be after midnight.
“My mom—“ Tony choked out through lungs that had never felt more unsteady. Jesus Christ, the whole world just shook and fell apart. “My mom is—“
He could usually almost always be found being Tony’s best friend. (And his secret, unrequited love interest but only Pepper and Rhodey needed to know about that. Don’t judge him— a man’s got to complain to someone about super soldiers that look impossibly kissable with helmet hair and a tattered uniform. God.)
But when Steve bites his lip a little too hard and Tony gives an involuntary hiss, Steve summons the strength to pull back— still breathing hard.
“Tony---” the genius choked out, because what the fuck else could he do? “Please, uh… Don’t, um. Don’t call me Stark. Please. Call me Tony.”
“Because if you’re lying… This is it, you’re my. You’re gonna be my only hope, Steve, because I love you and if you don’t mean that you love me then. Then when I find out I’m gonna—“
Tony’s screen was then filled with diagnostics he hadn’t ordered. Sent over from Peter’s AI, he realized.
But Tony gets it. He does. He’s not very likable to begin with on first impression, and he can only imagine how much more annoying his presence can get over time. Hell, he should know since he has to live every miserable day in his own company. He knows firsthand just how easy it is to grow to hate Tony Stark and just how impossible it is to love him. Frankly, it’s nothing short of a miracle Pepper and Rhodey have stuck around for as long as they have. (But he stopped telling them that, because it made them so sad for some stupid reason.)
Tony had believed his whole life that luck favors the prepared. Anyone shocked to know he had a plan in place for this kind of situation didn’t know him at all.
And not just the kind of day where Fury keeps him overnight and into the morning in his office to run over the same mission report he gave an hour ago upon his arrival, an intern spills cold coffee on his pants, and he misses Tony like fucking crazy and won’t even get to see him until he gets back from his business trip in three goddamn extra days— though that all happened today, too.
“Don’t worry,” Tony placates, remembering just how awful some of the green concoctions his old friend made could taste. “Maria is on a real cheeseburger kick lately.”
“I’ve been raising him for years,” Jarvis cut in, all the usual courtesy from his tone gone. Just leaving an angry, angry man. “And I’ve loved every moment of it. I don’t stay at this job for you, Howard.” He let the first name of his employer out like a curse before adding, “You’re a piss-poor excuse of a father and Anthony deserves so much better than either of us. But so help me God. I’m better than you.”
“And I seem to find the happiness I seek,” Tony continued, reveling in the feeling of Steve’s strong arms dipping them low. Knowing what that did to Tony (God, wasn’t he entitled to hourly reminders of just how buff his boyfriend was), hearing the audible little gasp he did at the move, Steve grinned. Cheeky bastard.
Regardless, the life he thought had ended went on. He built himself an iron arm, married the man he loved more than anyone else, and, well—
He wraps a gentle hand around his neck, draws him in close. For all his intelligence, the genius is still incredibly slow to see what’s coming.
Tony takes advantage of the distraction, huffing a weak chuckle that masks the sound of his strangled breathing (which is starting to feel paper thin.) “Yeah, alright, smartass. No one asked you.”
“I’m afraid I don’t understand the question, Captain,” JARVIS responds, a questioning lilt to his response. “I believe you’re verging hysteria. I’m contacting immediate help before you can harm yourself.”
“No, do tell me just what the hell I’m supposed to do in this situation. I’m open to suggestion,” Steve spits. Bruce looks taken aback, though he quickly schools his expression into resignation. When Steve looks around and sees everyone else has done the same, staring at him with a vacant look, it just makes him impossibly angrier. How can anyone not be angry right now? “Because I have to live the rest of my life without him. We all do. And I don’t know what the fuck I, or any of us, have to do so badly in the face of that.”
He just has to quiet the little voice in the back of his head and in the bottom of his heart that agrees with him, “you’ll survive. but how long without him are you going to want to?”
And then Baldie was off him, backing up and smiling again. Tony could hardly see through the water that’d accumulated in his eyelashes; staring blearily at the man.
And not just the kind of bad day where nothing seems to go right, he’s tired and angry, or Clint falls out of the vent in his workshop, lands rather ungracefully (meaning he completely faceplants) onto his glass table, and destroys the intricate project he’s been working on for the past five hours. In fact, the day he’s having sucks so much that that little scenario sounds like heaven right now.
Tony looks so tired. And yes, worry maybe shouldn’t be the first thing that Steve feels when he sees the face that he’s missed more than anything else (maybe it should be relief, or attraction, or at the bare minimum: happiness), but worry is what he feels nonetheless. Those big, Bambi eyes are wide; awake and alert— but in the worst way. The way he looks after he’s woken up from a nightmare, and Steve can’t truly comfort him or goad him back to sleep. Because what he’s seeing isn’t just some stupid dream. It’s wholly, and awfully real.
And Pepper had smiled. Her eyes were red-rimmed, but loving when they looked right through him. Right at the new man he was when death came calling for him once again.
The mistakes of the past came back to visit like old friends. He could never turn them away— inviting them into his mind whenever they came knocking.
“Can he breathe?” Steve finds himself gasping, out of his control. He really can’t get air into his chest right now, and all he’s thinking about is whether or not Tony feels the same. Because Steve is worried about him because he has to worry because Tony is still alive and can be hurting. He can still be alive and not be breathing. “Can he breathe where he is, Jarvis?”
Tony, admittedly a little ashamed at not noticing before, really looks then. There’s fatigue engraved deep in his friends face; like he’s aged decades in days. A greenish hue covers his cheekbones, and the wrinkles lining his forehead are overly pronounced.
Turns out Baldie is enhanced. He could see the inhuman, orange glow radiating off him even in the dark of his cell. Something to do with AIM and extremis bullshit, but he spends very little time analyzing it. He just doesn’t really think it matters too much.
“I detect heat signatures from a nearby location, Sir. All are in possession of heavy duty firearms.”
“No,” he said, slow and calm. The last thing Tony wanted was to argue with her. He wasn’t angry in the slightest, just sad they’d become friends. Because it was going to ruin her when all this shit finally caught up to him, if she didn’t leave now. “I set this path for myself. This is my life’s work. I’m responsible—“
“Because we don’t need one,” the bald, strong man says, stepping forward in the formation, closer to Tony. It’s a tad suicidal, Tony thinks, and he only thinks he’s even crazier when he has the audacity to smile. “We’re still en route to Plan A.”
The run is long on his aching ribs and lungs; each breath marked by an uglier sound than the last one produced. An inhale sounds more like a muffled scream than an exhale, which sounds similar to a sputtering engine.
Though the haze of the sedative makes it difficult to fully comprehend much, Steve still makes an effort to look around at his team and examine them. (Tony would call him ‘mother hen’ and laugh and Steve would relax a little, remembering how capable they all are of taking care of themselves. But Tony’s not here. He’s never gonna be here again.)
Tony’s crying, which feels wrong. Like seeing the sun rain on earth, and it’s not right. Steve has to set it right.
“I was wrong, Stark,” he started, brows furrowed in an apologetic crease, one hand coming up to rest on that incredibly, magnificently broad chest. Jesus Christ, he sounded so painfully sincere. “And I’m---”
Steve doesn’t feel his knees hit the floor, but he hears it. It’s an off-tempo beat to his fruitless gasps; like a drumbeat that doesn’t belong and
Not if he wanted to see Steve again. (Who’s he kidding? Home doesn’t mean shit if Steve’s not there.)
Tony’s luck appears to be never-ending tonight. No one stops him and asks him just what the fuck his problem is, even the policeman he knocks shoulders with on fifth street. Apparently, not a single person wants to talk with the (supposedly dead) Tony Stark. Then again, he hasn’t seen his reflection, and can’t imagine the black bruises he can feel throbbing on his face are very helpful to identifying him.
But Tony wasn’t lucky. If he was, he wouldn’t be leaving flowers by his mother’s headstone every Sunday of the year.
“Tony---” Rhodey had said from somewhere above him, a cautionary edge to his voice. But Tony was angry. And he wasn’t even anywhere close to done, yet.
“Fuck you,” Steve spits once the hacking recedes enough to drag a breath in. God, he’s shaking so hard, he just might fall into pieces. Tiny, sick pieces. “What did you--- what did you do to me?”
Tony couldn’t take any more pain than was already on his plate. It gnawed at his bones every waking moment, making him wish so fervently that he’d been turned into ash floating on the wind, too.
“Pep,” he tried to whisper, but his lips were far away. His whole body was far away, and drifting farther each moment. “Pep, I…”
And didn’t he fucking know that? Didn’t he know how he wanted to earn a little domesticity for himself some day? Love a man enough to marry him and maybe have a kid to top it all off like this is some fucked up fairytale sundae? He wanted it in the soul of who he was, but he couldn’t have it. Not after everything he’d done.
The world comes into focus slowly, sluggishly, in the way it only ever does when you’re waking up from a restless sleep. Steve can do nothing but wait, wonder how he lost Tony in the space of his own head, and watch the ceiling tiles sew themselves together above him.
They haven’t kissed since the night Tony came back from the dead. The two haven’t exactly been avoiding one another, but now, almost every exchange between them is a little awkward. They dance around each other with careful steps. And it’s not awkward with regret— more like awkward knowing what could have been in every interaction. Knowing Tony could be kissing Steve over pancakes and coffee. Knowing he could hold him close if things were different.
His friend’s face flickered with comprehension. Like he could make sense of it, even though Tony couldn’t. Sympathy spread across his features, too, but Tony couldn’t make sense of that really either.
“You’re okay, Tony,” Pepper assured, breaking him from his thoughts. She didn’t tell him he would be, or deny his logic because neither of them were idiots. They both knew he was right. “I’m not going anywhere, I promise.” There was a pause, and Pepper went still. “Tony? Can you just promise me something, though?”
“Alright, kids. Practice is over with that little bomb trick. It’s game time now,” Tony says, bringing up his hands and locking his knees in preparation for a fight. When no one makes a move, Tony laughs, the sound bitter and mocking. “Why don’t you fuckwads ever have a Plan B?”
It broke every stupid fucking string in his heart to not lean in with Tony— no, he had to hold himself back when all he really wanted was to grab the man Steve was so desperately, awfully, wholly in love with by the waist, hold his face achingly tender, tilt up the stubbled jaw, be the one to pull them in so close they could taste the kiss before their lips even touched, make Tony feel wanted, make him feel loved—
Peter told him as much, though Tony couldn’t thank him. The stones had taken their toll. He was just a man, in the end, after all.
“Jesus Christ.” There’s the sound of clinking that sounds suspiciously like the metal casings of the injecting paralytics he designed for her last week, but when he tries to get up, she just shoves him back down with a frankly worrying ease. “I didn’t want to do this, but you’re not gonna sleep any other way.”
He didn’t know what exactly they police were there for, though he was confident it couldn’t be helped by seeing a liquor store in some apartment ridiculously nice for a kid his age.
“What did we do to you?” Ass Clown repeats, obviously amused. Then, before Steve can even get his bearings, there’s a gloved hand threading through his hair--- ripping him up onto his knees. He has to bite his tongue so hard he tastes blood to narrowly keep from crying out. “Consider yourself HYDRA’s charity case. We fixed you, Stephen.”
“Sir, this is for your own health. To my records, you haven’t slept in over ninety-six hours for a period longer than fifteen minutes at a time. I’m simply protecting you, as I was designed by you to do.”
“Yes, Sir. I am well aware.” And at least the AI sounds satisfied when he answers so Tony knows they can get some actual work done now.
Steve feels concern— the first thing he’s felt that wasn’t grief in days— for the man. Wonders for the first time why the Avengers didn’t want to look for a body. Wonders where Tony has been.
Then, before Tony could even get his bearings, Steve got up from his seat on the couch, walking over in what can only be accurately described as an angry march until he arrived at the workbench and slid to his knees so they were at eye level.
“Captain, it would be preferable for you to sit down before I share this information with you,” the AI says, voice more somber than he’s ever heard it in the two years that he’s called the tower home. Steve’s blood runs cold. JARVIS should have apologized. He always apologizes when he scares them. He doesn’t ask them to do something. He’s never done that. “I’m afraid this may be difficult for you to process, and risk for injury should be minimized as much as possible.”
A man of his word, Tony pulls back the heavy curtain of his eyelids. Blinks at the lights and ceiling above them. Recognizes the ceiling tile. Medbay, he thinks.
He remembered thinking, ‘this better be a clean fucking blow and a fast death, Rogers— I think I’ve earned that much.’
Tony struggles beneath her incredibly heavy hand (Jesus, what’s she bench pressing these days?) to no avail. He resorts to pleading pathetically fast. “C’mon, Nat… I just worked out this new location algorithm— let me run it just once and then I’ll go to sleep, alright? It’ll just take a few seconds.”
It’s a good thing he’s selfish. It’s a good thing he wants to live to see Pepper and Happy’s wedding, welcome Rhodey back home, have JARVIS tell him Natasha finally got a good night’s sleep, watch another mind-breakingly boring nature documentary with Bruce, fix Thor’s armor for the fifth time that month, make Clint a new quiver because fuck, that thing is old. Even if they don’t want him there, he wants it enough for all of them combined and then some.
And when Tony didn’t get up, when Death was pressing her bleak lips to the side of his face and he was too weak to do anything but cry, Rhodey just picked him up on his shoulder and carried him home.
“Yeah, Pep?” he said once he finally gotten the handle on the sniffles. Jesus, if she wasn’t one of his very closest friends, he might be making a beeline for the window out of mortal shame right about then. Still considered it.
But then he stopped hating Tony. Tony, who never left the bedside of whichever Avenger had gone and got themselves nearly killed during that week’s mission, even when his phone was ringing off the hook with other work (fully aware Ms. Potts would eviscerate him for ignoring it later.) Tony, who never let anyone want for anything (Steve once found a year’s worth of canvases in his room after offhandedly complaining to JARVIS that he was out of them one day). Tony, who was endlessly selfless, kind, and brilliant. Steve didn’t stand half a chance in the face of all that beauty.
Tony’s been counting the days. He should have been back this morning to see him off before he made the three-hour trip to see the stockholders that don’t give a shit about him. He should have been back this morning to tease him lightly about his dumbass monkey suit, but ultimately see through his snarky act and see just how stressed he was about the whole thing and give him the hug that he’s not brave enough to ask for but needs nonetheless.
“Don’t be a baby,” Nat chides, and then there’s an awful, sharp pain crawling up his elbow into his veins. He goes to yelp, but realizes with a shock— he can’t. The sound is too heavy, like the rest of his body. So, so heavy. And cold. So heavy and cold it feels like it’s gonna sink through the floor, and his eyes start shutting involuntarily against it. He feels one of Natasha’s hands wind up in his hair (God, have her hands always been so warm?), twisting it to the side followed by the sensation of her fingers on the side of his neck. Held there for a moment. Evidently satisfied, she calls, “Little help, guys?”
“I’ll call Pepper. She probably wants to talk to you,” Natasha finally speaks, breaking the awkward silence Steve was admittedly unaware had been permeating. “Arrangements have to be made eventually.”
“I don’t— I don’t understand,” Steve says, shaking his head. It doesn’t make sense. “Tony, where are you?”
“You’re alright, bud,” Tony said, trying to keep the shake out of his voice from the leftover adrenaline and just failing. “You’re fine, we’re fine, I promise. We’re almost home. Almost home, just hold on, okay?”
“Steve,” Tony interrupts. Steve goes still, eyes wide and searching. Tony can feel his heart hammering up against his chest; fluttering in his throat. “Do you really mean that?”
Tony’s been in about a dozen hostage situations, and the one thing they all have in common is how fucking annoying they are. And terrifying. But mostly annoying as shit.
Tony shifts modes, smiling in earnest now even though he can feel his stitches strain at that. “Brucie Bear!”
Her footsteps echo on the floor for a few seconds, coming closer and closer, stopping when he can feel someone standing above him on the couch.
He can’t really feel himself fall from his kneeling position. The numbness comes quick, efficient, brutal. Like he’s being anesthetized by his own brain taking pity on him.
It’s been a few hours since then, now. And Tony’s still hurting something awful; but at least he can let his tears fall freely, knowing no one can see them in the pitch black space.
Steve loves him and Steve can’t bear to have loved and lost him he can’t live through that and because Steve’s not dead Tony’s not dead
The blood that’s crusted around the corners of his mouth aches as it’s pulled into a smile. God, he loves Tony. That’s all he has to know.
Somehow, some way that Tony was beyond being able to wonder about, he ended up settled on the couch. But when he tried to curl up into himself; muffle the pathetic sobs of pain into their snack-stained cushions, Rhodey wouldn’t let him. He picked up Tony’s head, slid into the seat, and then laid him back down on his lap. Reached for his shaking hand and held it in his steady one.
“You--- you shouldn’t be in here!” Howard had slurred in a rage, getting to his feet slowly but surely. “You… You never, never listen! I’m gonna-- I’m gonna make you listen!” Tony was too afraid to move, even though he had time to. He just stood stock still till his dad wound clumsy hands into the lapels of his shirt, shook him around something awful. “What the hell do you have to say for yourself?”
“You know I can’t,” she scoffed, voice strained. He chanced a glance up at her then, and was met by an angry, tear-filled gaze.
And that hurts. Though Tony would like to preserve his pride— say he’s a man of reason and knows logically that they have to do it sooner rather than later. But it still smarts like his ribs when he takes a breath to think of how sad it all is. He came from a family that didn’t love him, though he searched high and low for their affection (studied every subject to please his father, learned Italian for his mom) and still came up short. At least he can say he was honorable with the Avengers. He loved them for no sake other than to love them. He protected them, cared for them, built for them, lived for them— and never once asked for or expected anything in return.
“I’m sorry,” he said. He couldn’t even cry, he was so afraid. “I’m sorry, sir. It won’t happen again.”
But a weapon can’t love Tony Stark. Someone as dangerous as Steve shouldn’t even be allowed in the genius’ vicinity, let alone share a bed with him at night.
“Steven, please be calm. Banner means you no ill, nor do I or anyone—“ Thor interjects. But Steve isn’t done yet. He’s so furious. He doesn’t even know where the fury comes from— but it’s strong. It’s brutal. It’s as bad as the sadness and then some.
“You miss me, Pep?” Tony asked, strutting off the plane that carried him from a cave in Afghanistan (his own personal hell, really) back to Malibu (his own personal heaven.)
“Wonder where she got that,” Steve muses sarcastically, slipping a sinfully beautiful glare Tony’s way.
“No, you won,” Steve says, waving him off and going in search of his abandoned water bottle. “Fair and square— you kicked my ass into next Sunday.”
Everyone trusted JARVIS. The AI was infallible. He was the voice of reason, and everyone knew it. They’d believe him when they told them Tony was dead. Unfortunately.
Tony looks so incredibly lost for words. For once, it seems the genius doesn’t have a clue what to say. Steve would feel smug if he could feel anything other than relief and love and joy.
But, like any bruise, it has a center. You can press on the edges (in Steve’s case; his loneliness, fear of being an unworthy leader, knowing he can’t ever really go home) and it’ll be far less painful than if you apply pressure to the middle (his unrequited feelings for Tony, grief for his friends, shame in how he’s handling it all.)
The bed he’s been lying on moves then, shifting him up from his horizontal position into a reclined sit. It’s a little more dignified. Not that Steve really gives a shit about that or anything else right now.
“JARVIS, where am I hurting at?” he says, flipping his helmet on over his aching head. He can already feel the dramatic goose egg raising in the back of his skull from the spill he just took on the pavement. It was a sudden explosion, and as unexpected as unexpected explosions can be. The force had knocked him onto the hot pavement like he was a blade of grass in the wind, skinning up his hand and banging up his brain.
Steve feels like he can’t breathe again; like he’s breathing with Tony’s dead lungs. Like he’s just a kid in Brooklyn again, having lost both his parents, his parents. He’s homeless again— because without Tony, this is nothing but an overpriced skyscraper in the world’s shittiest city.
He thinks he hears the elevator door open, and he knows it does when several voices fill the room but he doesn’t really care because he
“No,” Steve blurts out, shaking his head. It doesn’t make sense. It makes absolutely no sense. “No, no… You--- you made a mistake, Jarvis. That can’t be…. That’s not…”
“No, we don’t,” Peter agreed, sounding confusingly smug. When Tony looked over at him questioningly, he was met by the spider suit’s happy white eyes. “But I do.”
And Tony had fixed it. Because Tony had loved them. And he had died believing the team didn’t love him just as much back.
Tony was never really good with the quiet, which was in part why the anger he felt nearly killed him at times. Death was quiet. He shouted for answers, pleaded for a reason. He could get his father--- the man had it coming for more reasons than one. But his mom? She was a victim that never even got out from under the claws of her abuser. She didn’t even get the chance.
“Steve, look at me,” Steve hears Natasha’s voice in his ear, sees her black socks on the hard floor, feels his face pressed on the tile and wonders how he got there and then doesn’t care when he remembers that neither he nor Tony can breathe.
Because it reminds him of being young. The deja vu hits deep beneath his diaphragm, washes through him in every gasp (no matter how much he inhales, the air never quite makes it past his lips) until it dawns in a blinding light on Steve’s mind.
“You don’t touch Anthony again, Mister Stark,” the other voice spat, furious. “Or I swear to God---”
Pepper had never lied to him. Pepper loved him too much for that. And he knew she knew how much he loved her.
Of course, JARVIS’ defense mechanisms are still running as strong as ever. They’re not especially vulnerable or lacking the protection they had last week. They’re still safe.
It’s Tony’s turn to look confused then. The genius tilts his head, shakes it a little which ruffles his hair (that would have bounced with the movement if it wasn’t matted to his head with sweat, and— blood?)
“No,” she agrees, leveling him with an exasperated glare. She looks tired; slumped up against the walls, shoulders slouched. She’s been looking for too long, too. “But we also can’t be running ourselves into the ground, now can we?”
“Anthony, are you alright?” his mom asked, looking down at him with the corners of her lips turned down in concern. Like how Jarvis had always looked at him when Tony was sad, and it made him ache in a way he didn’t understand. He stared at the rain pouring off her hat like a steady stream, just trying to breathe. “Do you need to go to the car?”
Steve reaches with limbs that act on their own accord, hardly in control of himself. He pulls an unexpectant Tony into his arms, hugs him tight against his chest, drops his head into the mess of Tony’s hair and just breathes.
“You guys can all head to bed,” Clint says abruptly, unexpectedly. It’s the first time Steve’s heard him speak in days, and even Thor, who’s been steadfastly ignoring everyone’s eyes (no one has to ask to know he’s feeling guilty for not saving their shellhead) looks up in surprise. The archer is still trembling, but he put his hearing aids back in. Steve would be happy for that if he could feel anything other than what it feels like to have loved and lost Tony fucking Stark. “My arrows need polishing. I’ll stand guard with Steve.”
Steve turns to look at her, prepared to level her with the most angry glare he can muster. But he just feels his heart sink impossibly lower in his stomach. Her face; so usually perfectly expressionless and trained, betrays a fraction of the grief she’s often hiding (which is unprecedented for the assassin.) No one that didn’t know her would be able to tell, but Steve— who’s sketched her a million times over— can see the stress held in the near undetectable purse of her lips, a small crease in the space between her eyebrows.
“I wish you the better of the luck next time, brave Captain,” Thor says from above him when he leans down to offer his hand. Steve takes it, albeit grudgingly, and is pulled to his feet. His whole body protests, bruises rippling when he moves. It’s all he can do to suppress a groan. “Perhaps it was for the waffles the great Anthony so valiantly prepared for me this morning that I bested you today. Be fair to yourself. You were not of the same advantage.”
And none of these objectively shitty experiences even holds a candle to whatever the fuck Steve’s problem is recently. The man, who’s long since gotten over his (in Tony’s eyes, well warranted) initial analysis of the fantastic “Iron Man” character, usually can almost always be found in Tony’s workshop, sketching and laughing and keeping Tony company that Tony didn’t even know he needed.
The physical ache isn’t such a big deal, really. He’s been hurting for a long time now, and it’s near impossible to separate the sources of throbbing weight in his chest. They blend together perfectly; one big bruise that doesn’t differentiate from his emotional, mental exhaustion and the complete smackdown a thousand-year-old Norse god just hand-delivered to him. It all hurts on one perfect, indistinguishable pitch.
I sighed and stood up. I was sexual completely frustrated and went to the door and laid my head against it. Protectiveness meaning he would lock me in and try to keep me safe even though we were in probably the safest place on earth.
“Are you waking up, Shellhead?” I could hear the smile right trough Steve´s soft barritone. I opened my eyes and looked straight at Steve´s chest. Boy, what a sight. We were standing in the kitchen. He carried me with one arm under my butt and the other one preparing something to eat. My arms were around his neck and my legs on either side of his waist.
I suddenly remembered yesterday. Fuck! How could I mess up that bad? What was Steve thinking about me now? Would he tell the others? Kick me out of the team because I acted like a freaking child? I was already at the edge of crying. Okay, calm down Tony. Steve wouldn´t do that.
“It´s not the forties anymore, I get to make my own choices! Sometimes it´s necessary to change the plan!”
Just I don´t know leave a comment. I might just got three comments on my stories but I just love reading them and I get every time so excited that I could jump right out of my skin.  (Maybe don´t picture that in your head.)
He started pushing his cock inside of me. It was huge. Oh god was it huge. And he did it so slowly. It felt amazing. My mouth watered.
“Yes.” I kissed him and shoved him closer, until our upper bodies were completely aligned. When he rubbed over my cock again and I felt this damp spot by his hole through my trousers I wasn´t able to hold back a moan. He smirked and continued to do so. “Tony.” The pheromones in the room got even stronger.
“No, he´s probably going to give me a lecture on how to treat a genius. So you gonna come to breakfast with me?” Tony nodded.
"We don't want for any of that junk to get on your perfect precious couch, right?" With that Steve my dear and friendly Steve love of my life stood up and left the room to prepare dinner.
“Oh. Just go without me. I´m not hungry.” He tried to make him self look smaller and looked down at the floor.
I was completely open and at show for my alpha. My hole fluttered and clenched around nothingness. I felt something wet leak out of me as my walls tightened. His cum or some of my slick. Steve must have seen it too, because he leaned forward and picked it up with his tongue. His tongue followed the trail up to my hole. Numerous sounds left me as he started rimming me. At first he just circled my hole, but then he started to push his muscle inside and eat me out, what made me feel so unbelievable vulnerable and open.
I prepared myself mentally to feel his cock inside of me. It wouldn´t be that bad, right? When he started rimming me I nearly cried out. That wasn´t exactly what I expected from the pure captain. To get down on his knees and do something as dirty as to lick an omegas hole. After one lick over my cock from base to head he moved and took his big cock in his hand.
“This is dumb and boring.” Tony whined. “I wanna leave. Where is Thor? Why can he just leave and we have to do this. Fury can go fu-”
“Keeping your room free from anyone who could harm you. Now go to bed I promise I´ll keep you safe, dear. You´re supposed to sleep.”
I nearly passed out as I finally released without my cock even having been touched. I wasn´t completely aware of how Steve dried and dressed me and praised me throughout everything.
I watched him as his sleeping body at first bit some times onto it before he started sucking. I stroked his face and after that pulled him back into my embrace under the covers.
Steve started breathing harder and his cock jerked some times befire he buried it deep inside me and started coming. His hot seed shot deep inside me. He always came a lit another side effect of the serum and he loved filling me up. Steve had stopped moving but I was still hard.
I opened the door to the living room just to find Steve sitting cross legged on the couch reading a book. His hair was still a little damp and he cuddled himself into a large blanket which was red white and blue with silver stars all over it. I remember buying it for him as a joke some months ago.
When I woke up daddy had his arms around me. He was so warm and cuddly. I slipped closer and hid my face in the fabric of his shirt. I smelled like my daddy and I immediately felt safe and at ease. It was sooooooo cozy. Much better than my teddy bear. But don´t tell him that or he´ll get sad.
When the last movie ended Steve stood up and carefully carried the genius to Tony´s room. Tony stayed quiet and let himself be put under his covers. Steve turned to leave the room, but a voice stopped him. “No, don´t leave!” He turned to face Tony again. The man had wide eyes and looked shocked. “Hey, it´s okey. I can stay.” Steve sat down besides Tony on his bed. The mechanic immediately scooped closer and held onto him as if he was afraid that Steve might decide to leave again. Steve originally hasn´t planned to sleep in Tony´s room, but his eyes just fell close after some minutes and the heat the other man provided was just too warm.
“There, there.” He opened my door and closed it behind us. Steve sat down on my king sized bed and kicked his shoes off. He did the same with my shoes and leaned back against the headboard. I was still sitting on his lap with my head leaning on his chest.
Steve´s sleeping form grumbled and frowned. I made my run before he could wake up. Running down to my lab.
“No!” Steve looked at me surprised.Fuck, I didn´t intent to say it that loud. “Sorry, Steve. I didn´t mean to scream. It´s just...I...”
“Not gonna spend the night alone.” Tony´s lips covered mine. I grabbed him around the wast with his hands around my neck and started kissing him too. His lips were soft and it was an overwhelming feeling like electricity running from where he touched me through my whole body. I felt him moan into the kiss as I took control and sucked his bottom lip into my mouth. He pressed our groins harder together as I shoved my tongue into his mouth. He tasted sweet. When we broke apart his lips were already kiss swollen. I worked my hands along his sides over the soft material of his underwear.
“Just for me, sweetheart. Don´t worry I´ll take care of everything” he said as he pulled my pants down and positioned me over his cock. I held onto his shoulders and looked into his now nearly black eyes as the tip of his cock slowly breached my rim. I moaned out loud as he kept pushing until he bottomed out and I whimpered against the skin of his shoulder. I was able to feel his pulsing member deep inside me. His hands settled on the back of my thighs as he started to lift me up again just to let me slide back onto his cock. He grunted.
Sure enough there were Bruce and Thor standing in the door like they were just about to enter the room but stopped dead in their movement. They stood there like statures and looked at the two of the with shocked expressions.
“You look exhausted Tony. Why don´t you go get some sleep?” He looked concerned and a crazy feeling started to spread in my stomach as I got his whole attention.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah, Tony. Com´ere.” He patted on the free place next to him. Should I really sit so close to him? Did he forgot to think about how close we would be? “I don´t bite.” I sat down next to him still trying to leave some inches between us. Steve sighed and reached one arm out. Before I could do anything, he had his arm around my shoulder and pushed me into his side. I don´t know if Steve saw me blushing, if he did he didn´t say anything. The time went by and it got darker as we watched some movies. I got really tired, I didn´t know when I last slept. Most of the others already went to their rooms. Just Clint, Steve and Nat were still here. Clint and Nat discussed something about the film and Steve sat next to me and just watched the movie.
“Biggest mistake. Your mother failed you. Not worth being my son.” It hurt like a cut with a sharp knife and I still tried. Built complex robots in an early age. The best grades. Tried to be the best son but still disappoint couldn´t stop disappointing.
Tony showed up for team training completely sleep deprived. I watched him stumble out of the elevator. He yawned, but he still tried to fight it. I decided that it was probably for the best to not let him fly in the suit right now.
I opened one of my side drawers and pulled out a bag with cute diapers which had adorable cartoon duck pictures on them. Jarvis had told me that Little Tony had problems controlling his bladder, especially during night time. When I approached him again he opened his eyes and looked suspicious at the diaper. “Tony, are you okey with diapers. I won´t make you wear them, but I think it would be easier for you than having an accident, sweetheart.” Tony blushed and looked away again. He gave a small nod. “I need a verbal answer, baby.”
“Well thank you for making a big mess out of our tactics! What do you think would have happened if Nat didn´t get out in time?! You would have gotten her killed! Stop being so selfish and start acting like the man you pretend to be!”
I removed the dirty diaper and wiped him down, before I powdered him and put on the new diaper. When I came back from putting everything away my boy already went back to sleep. My heart swelled as I saw him looking so peacefully and sucking on his thumb. Maybe I should try a pacifier. At least they were cleaner as a thumb and I didn´t want my little boy to get sick. There was also the chance that he would stay in his headspace when he woke up in the morning if there were more factors making him feel small (e.g. a diaper, a pacifier), because if there was one thing I knew than it was that he needed to be little for some days.
Right now I have no idea what will happen so it´s up to you. If there´s anything you want to see just write it down below and it would actually help me a lot, because I have no idea how someone thinks about the story who isn´t me and what they would like to see next. Even if you want me to write GOOD smut i´ll even try to do that.
How was he able to be so quiet one moment ago we were in the middle of an argument screaming at each other at the top of our lungs and now he was terribly calm. No, he wasn´t fooling me, he just held it all in, such a vanilla guy. I wanted to scream at him. How could he just stop reacting to me. I hate being ignored. Idiot. The others started having conversations or went into other rooms leaving me alone with the muscular boring grandpa. Ugh….
I smiled at least I could make this fun. “Oh, cupcake there are a lot of people who will tell you how much of a grown up I am.” I winked at him. He started blushing furiously. Well, don´t mess with the queen. That´s what you´re gonna get.
“Now, how´bout we get you to sleep. You must be really tired.” Tony groaned what made me chuckle. I really had a cranky baby in my arms. “Let´s go.”
“You´re mine.” His voice was far lower than normal and it made something in me snap, because I instantly started to leak as I reacted to his dominant alpha pheromones.
“No! Don´t leave.” Steve stopped and sat back down. Tony had buried his head in his shoulder and started shaking.
I took him over to the bathroom and started to fill the bathtub with water. He fuzzed a little bit as I took the shirt from his head which was now covered in food and sticked to me and his diaper which he had clearly used. He stood naked in the middle of the bathroom. I turned around to grab some shampoo and shower gel and when I turned back around. I saw his naked bottom escaping out of the room. How did he managed to move so fast and quiet I didn´t even hear my baby. I gave chase after him and it took me nearly three minutes before I catched him around the middle and had the giggling boy in my grasp. To prevent further escapes I directly sat him into the bathtub which had filled during the passed time.
And Tony just rolls his eyes, kisses him quick (for no other reason than just loving him) and pulls them inside.
It feels like it’s somehow been both hours and seconds when someone with a low, scratchy voice speaks from beside him: “Are you with us, Cap?”
“I love you— I’m so sorry,” Steve sobs. He doesn’t know when he started crying, gets the feeling he might have been the whole time, but he can’t stop. He can’t stop, and he’s so sorry.
Of course, ever the pragmatist, he’d built and planted another small remote bomb on one of the guards during a shift change. The detonation, other than worsening a few of Tony’s first few burns from the initial explosion, was successful. No one lived to follow him out of the building, at least.
Tony knew from the way his mom had flinched that there was no hope of escape. He’d have to endure this. And he didn’t blame her. Not when he smelled like the beers Tony brought him to try and calm him down. Not when she once made sure Jarvis would read him his bedtime story for two straight weeks after Howard chipped her jaw (that had been a bad one.) And not when she spent over fifteen minutes covering both their bruises with makeup, albeit spending more time on her face than his, before they left today.
She almost left. Not out of self interest or lack of work ethic, but because Tony really was killing himself. Pepper was many, many things (most of them wonderful). Stupid wasn’t one of them. She saw straight through his armor, both literal and physical; saw the death creeping up over him like ivy in a garden.
He was just eight when he first felt it. It came upon the rain and the wind, pounding up against his jacket, splashing from the mud getting all over the dress shoes Jarvis had shined just a week ago. Sang a little song to Tony while he did it, laughing when Tony laughed. Just a week ago.
Not a day goes by that at least one person on the team doesn’t pull Tony aside in a hallway, catch him before a briefing or find him in his workshop to tell him that they appreciate him and all he does for them.
“What?” Howard laughed, as disbelieving as Tony was hearing it. “You… You think you could do better, is that it? You’re gonna raise him right and—“
“Give me a target, J,” Tony says, engaging the flight facilities of the suit. Call him an adrenaline junky, but he still feels a rush of exhilaration as he lifts into the air, even after all these years. God, there’s nothing quite like it. “I want something to shoot at.”
So when he saw Strange raise his hand, let him know this was their only chance, Tony didn’t think twice.
“I lost the kid,” were the first words out of his mouth. As if they’d been sitting under his tongue all this time, waiting to be understood. Nebula tried, but she didn’t quite get it. “I couldn’t stop him, I…”
“Dad!” Maria calls, jostling him from where he’s sitting curled up on Steve’s lap. He ignores his husband’s huffs of amusement as he pulls himself upright, but apparently not fast enough for their human tornado of a daughter. “Dad! Dad! Dad!”
“I’m very much above ground, Nat,” he says; flashes a smile that feels as brittle as it is fake. Her face softens a little in response, but that just puts Tony on edge. Softness from Natasha means pity— and pity means defeat, means she thinks Tony should stop when she knows very well he can’t stop and—
It’s been a few months since they were all last together— life is busy for just about everyone except Steve and Tony, who’ve decided they’ve donated enough for the cause to earn the privilege of taking some hard-earned time off.
Once, about six months after the accident had happened and Tony was beginning to overcome the very worst of the grief, they’d come to visit the cemetery. It began the same as it always did; Tony telling his mom how things were (even if things were objectively awful, he’d say he was doing alright) and giving her the general “love and miss you” speel.
Apparently, Captain America eats all his greens (Steve can’t stand asparagus), and obeys all the laws (Steve might be the most treasonous fuck in the country), and most importantly: he never runs from anything. Captain America faces his problems head on. He feels no fear.
“We had to restrain you,” Tony interrupts, still staring at Steve with that vacant expression that Steve’s seen on the corpse of every open-casket funeral he’s been to. “So don’t be scared.”
Satisfied, she finally smiles. Tugs them both in for a warm embrace that just makes Tony feel so impossibly whole.
Tony spotted him instantaneously, plummeting through the sky, limbs flailing, screaming, nearing the pavement with every wasted second. Without a second thought, he shot the suit’s thrusters down, angled towards the ground Peter was so rapidly approaching.
He’s just coming around to realizing how there’s two very connotations to the word found when reality slips out from beneath him like a cruelly yanked rug.
And maybe he should cut himself some slack, considering the mission Fury sent him out on had gotten him kidnapped and tortured by some jacked-up HYDRA thugs for a month, but fuck that.
“How’s it going over there, Mister Stark?” Peter’s voice abruptly shouted over the comm line, startling Tony almost bad enough to fuck up the intricate bomb disassembling he’d been doing without even thinking about it. He didn’t even remember getting into the building. Jesus Christ. Steve should have another shot at killing him. He’s practically useless, at this point. “I’ve got two down, working on the third.”
Everything including the materials to make the shitty little blade-bomb-all-in-one Tony had stabbed through his heart (Tony doesn’t want to admit it, since it makes him sound like the villains he loathes so deeply, but seeing Baldie bleed was so fucking satisfying).
And sitting in the dark (JARVIS must have turned the lights off out of courtesy) all by himself in this big room, Steve breaks.
So Steve musters the impossible strength (ignoring the irony that this must be his weakest point) to look up at him. At the light, one last time.
“Sir.” JARVIS’ somber, calm voice (and oh god, how he’d missed him, couldn’t wait to see him soon in that kingdom they told him about when he was a kid) echoed in his comm ear. “It’s a pleasure to be with you now.”
The kid was rambling nonsense in the same way he always did, asking dumb little questions about his hair and what he’d been doing but Tony just grabbed him.
“Look, Mr. Clean,” Tony said, patience skipped right past the wearing-thin phase and right into the if-not-for-the-laws-of-this-land-I-would-have-slaughtered-you mode. “What do you want from me?
“Take a lucky guess,” Peter said, humor evident in his tone. “Look, Karen has cleared them. They’re standard, and they’re not anything fancy. We can just get everyone out, go in, cut the right wires, and make it home in time to watch the new—“
He didn’t know at the time how funny it was. Didn’t know how funny it was that his past self sat there in a little, yellow car, crying quietly into the sleeve of his jacket when the taxi driver wasn’t looking about being something so stupid as too strong.
Thor, always the booming, loud center of the room is uncharacteristically silent; glaring at the floor beneath him with arms crossed, like he’s trying to hold himself together. Clint’s whole body is shivering, convulsing in strange patterns, and he’s removed his hearing aids. Steve doesn’t have to ask to know; Clint can’t bear to not hear Tony’s shitty rock music from three floors down with the infallible tech that Tony built for him when complained once (just one time, but that’s all Tony needed to do something kind for anyone) about his old aids. Natasha’s (who Steve’s seen take multiple bullets and not cry) standing against the far wall; eyes closed, but with a steady flow of silent tears leaking down her face like a river.
“Don’t bullshit me, Tony,” she cuts him off before he can even get into the meat of his excuse, voice as sharp as the dagger she keeps in her left shoe. “You just fucking collapsed in front of me, so don’t try and pull the wool over my eyes. And about Steve? I believe you. I don’t think he’s really gone, either. But I can’t— I won’t lose you finding him. I just won’t. Am I clear?”
He really wakes up then; tries to lift himself up from the bed where he’s lying down, attempting to get his elbows beneath him, ignoring the ache in his ribs as he goes.
“We could deactivate the bombs?” Peter suggested, pulling him out of his less-than-satisfactory self-reflection. “You get the ones on the top and I’ll—“
Out of morbid curiosity, Tony turns a little to Natasha. He sees her perched on the windowsill; hands tucked in close to her chest like they’re cradling her heart. Her eyes are red rimmed, hair a wild mess. She doesn’t look away from his gaze, like if she does he’ll disappear. Next to her sits Clint, bow in hand, watching out the window with a protectiveness unlike even his usual paranoia.
“Everybody’s here! Get up!” With that, little Maria Margaret Rogers-Stark takes off like a bat out of hell towards their little cabin door.
He had the life, if only for just one fucking moment before he was going to lose it, that he’d wanted years ago when he knew this was how he was going to die.
“Why? Why not, Tony?” Steve questioned, sounding fucking heartbroken and way to go Tony you’re about to make Captain fucking America cry. “It’s true. I mean it, I love—“
“Cap,” Bruce says. And there’s so much in that nickname. There’s worry, reproach, pain, concern, grief. How Tony used to say it when he had to tell him something hard to hear. It makes him ache even more. “We’re just worried about you. These are hard times for everyone; I understand that. But you have to—“
“Captain.” Steve jumps nearly a foot in the air at JARVIS’ abrupt interruption from his thoughts; robotic voice coming loud and strong over the speakers.
“Nothin,” Tony shrugs, pulling on the boots he keeps tucked beneath the couch because he’s domestic like that now. Once he’s got them good and laced, he turns over, kisses Steve on his stupidly beautiful bearded mouth and gets up. “I’m just happy. That’s all.”
He chuckled his eyes now back to their normal colour. I keep forgetting that he can tell what I´m thinking. “You need your rest, darling. We got time for those kind of things when your well rested.” He pulled a blanket over me and gave me another kiss. My Alpha took his shield from the wall and left the room. I stared at his backside , till I heard the key turn in the lock and I finally processed what just happened. What the hell! Did he really just lock the door when things got heated?!
I closed my eyes just concentrating on the feeling of his fingers moving over my skin. His fingers drew circles as he moved his hand farer down the back of my neck. His touch just too shy of touching my glands. I smiled to myself. I will miss these moments. As soon as he finds a mate he will surely stop being so affectionate. He will be a great and loving partner and his mate would be perfect of course. Someone who is truly worth Steve´s love and time. Maybe a beautiful and smart omega women who will give him a bunch of cute little super soldier babys. He wouldn´t have the time to think about me anymore. He would meet her on one sunny day asking her out on a date and then asking me for advice on how to dress and how to woo her and I would help him. I would stand by his side as he married her and smile at him not showing how it broke my heart to know that he would never be mine.
“It happens that alphas get really protective over their omegas the first few days after they´ve bonded.”
I bit my bottom lip and Steve slowly captured my lips and started a long and dirty kiss. Right as he slid his tongue around mine he pushed another finger inside. I broke the kiss and moaned. A small string of spit was connecting our mouths.
“Alpha ...” Tony´s belly grumbled and it was obvious that he was still hungry, I would have to wait some more. I reached out for the plate and took a fork.
“As much as I would like to let you in, Sir, doesn´t want to be disturbed right now. I´m sorry Mister Rogers.” The AI sounded sad.
“Steve….Ahhhlpha!” Tears streamed down my face he met my sweet spot everytime. He tried to sooth me with his hands which were rubbing over my sides. His eyes were dark and he opened his mouth slowly.  I craned my neck and exposed my throat with the scent glands which were sitting heavy under my skin. He closed his mouth and his teeth pierced right into my bonding glands. I felt thousands of things. I was able to feel the bond between us the arousal shooting through my body the tingling in my limbs and so much more. I screamed as I started coming right between us and his knot swelled. His come started filling me up. He was still biting into my neck.  I trembled. It was an overwhelming feeling. Steve´s name was the only thing on my lips. He let go of me and looked at me.
Nobody knew that Pepper and I broke up. I knew it was coming and it was probably for the best. We both saw that we wouldn´t get anywhere with this relationship and it just caused problems.
“Are you sure? You look really tired. Just finish the things tomorrow. Now better go to sleep.” That was the moment I saw red.
I already felt the wetness between my cheeks as Steve kissed me. I went limb and closed my eyes as his hands found my ass and started pulling me closer and moving my hips in circles over his groin. I groaned. “Steve. Ahhh, Alpha!” He nestled on my neck.
“Sir, has gone to his lab.” Steve sighed there was no way Tony would let him go down there. He already stood often enough in front of closed doors. He could also use the time for something better.
On that day my dream was completely insane. Like OMG I´m so embarrassed. If I ever told Steve about it he would never let me live it down, or maybe not. I mean he´s a very cute ice perfect alpha. Ok, I think I´ll just start telling again. My dream was about a sheep. It had the softest an mos comfortable fur i´ve ever felt in my entire life. Together we lied in the grass and looked at the sky. This must sound stupid and please don´t forget that I´m a genius but the sheep smelled like home and safeness.
Jarvis told me that Tony hadn´t slept this entire time, exactly what I´d planned. Even tough the thought of him not caring about himself again made me feel kinda sick.
“Daddy.” He got louder. I turned my attention to him. He took my hand and moved it. “Bye, bye kitchen.” CUTE. I repeated his sentence and had to do everything in my power to not start crying at how adorable that moment just was. Tony looked happy as I did what he wanted. I couldn´t but kiss him on his head for being so…. unbelievably loveable.
Tony might not seem very strong, but he is, I promise. i just like the idea that he can let his guard down and let someone else take care of him.
Taking him in my arms every time he had nightmares. I decided that it was time to start making lunch. I went to the kitchen and locked the door so that no one would have access to my mate or interrupt his sleep. I met Clint and Bruce in the living room and couldn´t stop myself from growling. They were both betas and could easily take my mate, but not if I had a say in this. They were watching TV and looked up as I entered.
“You both shut up.” Natasha glared at us. “Sit down.” Surprised I looked from her to Steve. In my anger I didn´t even realise that the rest of the team was also in the main living room. Natasha tapped with her foot on the ground. “Now.” She said calmly but I knew that we were in great danger if we didn´t do as we were told. Steve and I sat down on the couch keeping a big gap between the two of us.
“Aah, you jerk. That´s not fair.” Clint rubbed his leg and kicked him right back. Tony threw a pen at him, but Clint leaned to the side and it felt on the floor. Of course it broke, leaving a sea of paint on the new marble floor.
Steve and I stood eye to eye with our chests nearly touching each other´s. We breathed hard and I gave him my best glare. Even though he was some inches taller than me I didn´t feel intimidated.
“Steve, can we change?” I turned to Tony. He was holding a pink t-shirt and shorts with a label saying “mouthy princess”. I laughed. Tony and Clint had been “pranking” each other since they became somewhat close to friends and both already ad their share in getting on each others nerves.
Tony slowly started to calm down and I recognized that he needed a diaper change. Maybe that must have made him uncomfortable. Tony snuggled closer into my embrace and closed his eyes. I sighed and carefully lifted him up. He gave me a small whine but quieted back down as I cooed him again and rubbed his back reassuringly. I got the changing mat I´d bought and placed it on my bed before I sat him onto it.
Waking up the next day was surprisingly pleasant. I kept my eyes close and snuggled closer to the warmth coming from beneath me. With my face lying on Steve´s bare chest, I was able to feel his breathing and hear his heart beat steadily. I robbed a bit upwards and drowned my nose in his neck.
“Those are extremely private information about sir, but after what happened yesterday, I think I can just tell you, after you must have figured most of it already out. But I trust you to not use it against Sir, if you do I will harm you in every possible way.”
"Shh" Steve kissed my thigh. "It's okey. I've got you." Steve waited some minutes until I calmed down and then he moved my thighs apart and spread them. He grabbed the lube and out some on his fingers before warming it up.
“Steve, I want to bond with you. I want to be yours.” I stopped breathing. My mind was screaming “Omega” and “Mine” and every other thing just stopped. Tony was perfect and I loved him for what felt like ages. We just had our first kiss some minutes ago and it was the best feeling I ever had in my whole life. I would do anything for him. And now he said he would like to bond with me. Wanted to have the strongest of all connections with me. I felt like crying but the arousal stopped it from happening.
“They wouldn´t have been in danger if you had just listened to my orders? Why do you keep disrespecting me?”
My smile broke and I stopped purring. Maybe I could still have him once in a while but could I really ask for that when I knew I didn´t deserve him.
“Mine.” Steve´s eyes turned red and he growled again. I felt my hole now steadily producing slick preparing for what would be coming. I was 100 percent sure he was able to smell how willing I was. He was so damn hot, fuck. He smiled and put his hands on my ass before he pushed me closer. So HOT! Steve lifted me up and positioned me on his hips his hands kneeding my ass while my back was pressed against the kitchen wall.
“Ye-” Suddenly he pushed his hips forward hard and hit my sweet spot. Electricity went through my whole body. “Aahhhh!” I don´t think I’ve ever felt as much pleasure as in that moment. I closed my eyes and felt a whine escape me. Steve growled satisfied and thrusted his hips always meeting that spot deep inside of me. Every time he pushed in the pleasure was overwhelming and when he pulled back my walls clenched around him trying to hold him inside of me already missing the feeling of his cock filling me completely even though I knew he would shove push back inside the next second. I wasn´t even able to move my hips. Steve was completely in control setting a punishing pace not like I wasn’t enjoying it. I would make him fuck me every day from now on. My body was hot and sweaty and everything was just wonderful. I felt our scents fill the room and everything ranked of sex. The scent of willing omega and claiming alpha.
“Rhodey won´t like to hear that you´re boosting my ego.” I gave Tony a smile. It was nice to see that he calmed back down.
I remember sitting cozy in the kitchen in one of his sweaters drowning in his scent with him feeding me pieces of fruits and spoonfuls of my favorite cereals.
Steve took mercy on me and started pullingc my pants and underwear of until I was completely naked underneath him.
We got comfortable in the bed with me supporting his head while I feed him the bottle. At first he refused and gave me some bewildered looks but as I told him that there was no way he would get around this, he allowed me to give him the bottle.
"Steve, oh." I said between moans as it pushed in and out of me. Soon after a second finger pushed into me and they weng all in to the knuckles before he started moving them in scissoring motions. I screamed when he found my prostate and instead of pulling his hand away he pressed against itt harder. It felt so damn good and overwhelming I felt tears on my cheeks.
We spent the next two hours playing dodgeball. Afterwards mostly everyone left giving Clint angry stares (or a kick in the guts, Natasha). Thor said he would go to Asgard for some days and the others just went to their family and friends, they said they had enough of the team for the day after the ´wonderful´ game. That left just Tony and me.
All I wanted now was to finally come but the cock ring wouldn't let me. I felt like I was going to explode with pleasure.
“Ok, Tony.” Steve gave me a kiss and stopped my process of thoughts. ”We should shower, baby.” Wait, was shower a code word for sex? Oh, that was so hot, but I was still sore. I moved my legs a little bit and tried to get feedback from my poor little hole. Well yeah, a little sore, I mean I wasn´t in heat right now but if he wanted to go again, I wouldn´t mind like at all.
I hope no one stood to close to our rooms, because we surely made a lot of noise. And it felt so fucking good.
Maybe it was time to show Tony how weird his protectivness over the couch was and I already had a plan.
I looked at the floor and felt the heat rising in my cheeks. I really spent the whole night in his arms. He didn´t get much sleep.
He took some steps into the room, barely able to keep himself on his feet. Everything inside of me screamed at me to run over to him and gather him up in my arms to bring him into his bed…just to sleep! But I stayed strong at least for now.
It was fun to see him make his ‘serious’ face as he decided if he should take a bath or not. It looked ridiculous and I nearly snorted out loud. It´s indescribably how it feels to see my boy be that happy. I let him stay the whole time I prepared breakfast in my arms and rocked him slightly. He giggled the whole time. I placed everything on the table I even managed to find some orange juice.
“I´m sorry for what I did on the field. I didn´t mean any harm.” An arm grabbed me and pulled me into Steve´s side.
Steve´s hands stopped and his scent changed slightly. I opened my eyes just to see him already looking at me with a concerned glance.
"Please. Steve, please." He would know what I meant what I needed. He kissed me again and started playing with my nipple. At the end of it I was a whimpering and moaning mess.
“Why do you still wear clothes, Tony?”I grunted against him. “I should just keep you naked all the time. You could stay in my room. I would provide everything you need and no one would come too close or look at you. You´re mine and I could keep you safe so easily sweetheart. Would keep you open the whole time. Would make a plug hold my come inside of you the whole time, could just slip right into you whenever I wanted.” I felt a wet spot starting to grow on Tony´s trousers.
Suddenly he stiffened. "Barton, I swear if you get any of that junk on my precious couch you'll be the one to try find another one as perfect as this one!"
“I love you, my sweet little omega.” I was exhausted and went completely limp as Steve’s cock kept spurting come inside of me. I looked at him saw the smile and a hint of blood on his lips and his beautiful blue eyes which looked proud and were full of happiness. I was so unbelievable happy. I never loved someone like I love Steve.
The post-battle-adrenalin was still rushing through my veins. Although we BOTH ranked of sweat and were in need of a shower I was willing to spend the next hours arguing with him.
I considered making a run for it and spending the rest of my days in Mexico with false papers, but I knew Natasha would find me. Even Steve hesitated for a moment before he stood up. We stood side to side in front of Nat. I guessed I should try my luck one more time.
"Let's find out." He crashed his lips onto mine. He held my waist and I put my arms around his neck to get him closer. He licked at my lips and tried  to get entry but I denied him. I would have the power. "Tony!" Steve growled, but I kept my mouth shut.
“Why are we here? Not that I´m not enjoying being carried around, but last time I checked I was on the…couch?”
“Ok, Tony. Let´s get something to eat.” It took him some time as I pulled him out of his “daydream”.
The disgusted look I got when I came home after a night with a woman. Just wanted to get loved, to feel cared for. It didn´t matter after some time it was just another thing he ignored. Howard never loved me and he won´t as long as I was a disappointment and he died before I could prove myself to him.
What the hell is wrong with me? I´m a full grown ass-man and wanted to act like a damn baby. I´m a mess and far too emotional. A completely disappointment. Stupid piece of shit.
“Did the mean alarm woke you up? Oh, baby. It´s okey. Shh…I´m here.” I pushed some strands from his face and kissed his forehead. “I know, sweetheart. It´s okey.”
(AN Before you say that´s creepy, remember it´s Captain wholesome and nothing he does can be anything but cute or just good ;) )
“Sleep, Tony.” I watched him close his eyes and after some minutes his breathing had evened out. I never imagined he would be mine. I never thought he would feel anything for me. And now he was sleeping on my chest. With my mark on his neck and no one other would ever touch him. I spent the next three hours watching him sleep.
“Good morning, sweetheart.” I felt the vibrations of his groggy morning voice and a hand starting to pet my hair. I lifted my head meeting his piercing blue eyes and purred lowly. MINE. My bondmate. I was bonded. To. Steve. I never thought I would have this.
My belly started to hurt. Steve was still coming and it worried me a little bit. But I better didn´t let him know that. I knew that my stomach was already blown with all the cum filling me.
“I love you too.” I kissed him again. His cock was still filling me up and his knot wouldn’t go down for the next fifteen minutes.
I didn´t slept again that night. Steve stayed with me the whole time. He kept saying calming things and rubbed his hand over my neck near my scent glands. I knew he just did it to calm me down, but I couldn´t stop thinking that other people would think I was taken. How long would his scent stay on me? As soon as the sun raised I got out of Steve´s grip. An inner voice telling me to get ack into his arms.
“There are better things we could do.” I winked at him. Oh I would get banged with his red white and blue popsicle.
When I started this work I had the story already written, but like in a really really bad form, so i´ve been just working on rewriting it, making it longer yadyadada like you get what I´m trying to say. I didn´t really change anything about the plot or so.
I grumbled but nodded. Somehow he managed to prepare our dinner with just one hand while still keeping me pressed to his side with the other hand. I´ll deny everything later and probably clean Jarvis’ video footage.
I hoped you enjoyed the chapter now that we finally got some action. I mean I love fluff but C'mon we´re all here for the smut.
“Tony, look at me. We´re here. You´re safe, okey. I´m not going anywhere. I won´t let anyone hurt you, okey?” I nodded. Something made me believe him and I felt safer.“Oh, Tony. It´s alright. I´m here.” I didn´t realize I was still crying. He pushed my head in his chest and put his arms around me. “Not letting anyone hurt you. I promise. It was just a dream.” I put my arms around him and sank into his body. Steve was there. He would save me no matter what. (Please just ignore Civil War :) )
“Yes, for lunch. There won´t be any skipped meals anymore and you gonna sleep enough, okey? If you don´t, you won´t like the consequences.”
"I think he went down to Bruce's lab or asked Clint for help and got a bucket full of green slime and dumped it right over my head."
“Daddy.” For a moment I thought I did something wrong, cause daddy stopped moving and didn´t do anything and I worried, but the my daddy lifted me up onto his chest and I could see his large smile.
I looked around the room and recognized that the blinds were down in order to make the room darker. Has he planned to get me here? Steve layed a hand on my head and started massaging my skin again. It calmed me down immediately and I started purring. Damn omega nature.
Dum-E entered the living room with a plate full of fast food in his metal claw. Steve would have prefered something healthier as he knew Tony already ate enough take away when he even ate something. But because he wasn´t able to leave Tony alone right now the food had to do it. He still noted that he would cook something healthy for Tony within the next days. He took the plate, luckily Dume had also brought a fork.
After dinner Tony went straight to his room. He was so lovely I wished I could keep him in my arms for eternity. I stayed in the living room and sat down on the couch. Jarvis switched on the TV for me and I started watching the news. Of course not before I asked Jarvis to call me as soon as Tony got any kind of nightmares. Five minutes after Tony had left the room, I heart a door open and footsteps coming closer. I looked up to see Tony walking to me.
“No, you´ll manage.” His arms were shivering and I knew that he was close to tears. Two more minutes and he broke. He sat down on the floor and started crying. He finally was in his headspace I hoped that it was the last time I had to break him to get there.
Our two dorks get into a small argument because one genius thinks he´s a machine and maybe he´s alittle bit embarrassed.
“You´re gorgeous.” He leaned down to scent my neck right where the bonding spot was. My scent glands itched under his attention. An excited feeling went through my whole body. His hips moved faster and faster just bringing me more pleasure and I was already close. I was already chanting his name between moans and whines while he made grunts and growled. I felt the sound vidrate where he sucked on my neck.
Ok, back to the chapter. you´re all allowed to leave requests I´m open to everything. The next chapter is probably goona contain Steve´s alpha instincts acting up.
After some time Steve positioned us so that I was lying on top of him with his hands rubbing over my butt-cheeks.
“No! Help!” I couldn´t breathe. I needed air. Why was there so much water? Why didn´t they let me back up. I felt tears running down my face even though my head was already under the surface. They grabbed me harder and started screaming too.
Steve sighed and looked at the other team members. “Ok, I think this meeting is over.” He stood up and picked Tony up. Tony refused to get back down on the floor. Steve just carried him to the living room in the Avengers store and sat down on the couch with Tony on his lap. Tony crossed his arms and avoided his eyes.
“I´ve got nightmares and I know it sounds stupid, but I can´t help it. It got better when I started to go out with Pepper, but some months ago it got worse and nothing helped. Then we broke up and I just don´t know what to do.”
I opened my eyes and snapped after air. My lungs were burning, but I slowly started to get everything back under control. It was just a dream. Oh god, what was wrong with me? As soon as I calmed enough down to get my heartbeat back on a normal beat I recognized that I was still sitting on Steve´s lap. Steve. He was looking at me and those were his hands on my shoulders. What would he think about me after everything that just happened.
Me screaming “harder” over and over again taking everything he had to offer and the going straight over the edge as Steve started to suck at my scent glands. With me tightening around him I pushed him over the edge as well. He pushed a deep as he could into me once more and the base of his cock started swelling until I couldn´t move away even if I wanted to.
“Tony and dad.” I felt anger burn inside of me. Tony´s father always treated him bad and because of what? Because Howard was jealous? If I had known what kind of men he was I would have given this man quite the beating.
“You look gorgeous. Open up for me, sweetheart.” I nudged his thighs and Tony spread his legs and sat them up. I looked at his hole.  It shivered under my gaze. Slick came spurting out of it. I took a hold of his ankles and leaned down to lick over his hole. Tony tasted soamazing. I could spend days eating him out. I would save that idea for another day. I shoved my tongue deep into his hole. Tony squirmed and his whole body pressed upwards and I needed to hold him down. His cock was fully erect and I licked over it too.
“Clint!” Tony groaned. “I´m not playing your stupid games.” Clint didn´t even listen and just pushed him into the changing room. I followed Tony and Clint went back to the big hall. I opened my grey bag and looked inside. I pulled out some blue and black sport clothes and knew we were in for trouble. It didn´t get better, at least for Tony.
“You jerk, let me down. That´s not how Captain America is supposed to behave.” Steve hummed and walked over to the kitchen.
“Nat, darling look…” She gave me one pointed look and I closed my mouth and swallowed. I looked at Steve who still seemed slightly angry. Nat made us sit there for what felt like hours until Clint returned. He carried a big shirt and gave it Nat.
I didn´t stop and just started sucking harder. He squirmed underneath me and I had to hold him down. His eyes were completely black as I gave a short glaze to his face.
“Do you like my robe, Steve?” I grabbed the seam of his panties and lightly dragged them upwards so that they rubbed over the omegas hole and cock. Tony whined and the sweet scent of slick filled the air. I growled. His body was already preparing for me. I would treat him so good. A knot pumping him full of my cum my mark on his neck while he would be making those sweet sounds in my arms. I loved him so much. I would protect him forever.
“Mhh.” There was a good smell and my arms were around something warm. I got closer to the warm feeling.
“Tony, I´m not going to discuss this with you. It´s an easy rule: No coffee, alcohol or energie drinks while being little, and don´t try me on this one baby. It´s for your own best.”
"Oh and what would that be?" Steve took a look into my eyes and hummed as if he was thinking about an answer.
“Tony.” I sat down beside him. “Time to wake up.” Tony opened his shining brown eyes and started smiling immediately.
“C´mon, don´t be mad. Are you still tired? You can sleep if you want. Or do you want to eat something?” Steve didn´t understand what was wrong. He already had a suspicion on what was going on, after Tony acted strange more often within the last weeks, but he would keep quiet until he could be sure. He decided to just motivate Tony to eat and then to go to sleep. He wanted to stand up and tried to sat Tony on his feet, but the mechanic started clinging to him.
I was fast asleep. I don´t know how long it took me to get my first nightmare. I was back in Afghanistan. My arms were tied and I was kneeling in front of a bucket of water. Two guards held my arms another man was standing in front of me.
“I don´t care. That´s what you get for ignoring me.” Steve looked at me with an dumbfounded expression. I huffed. “Deal with it, Roger.”
No! Don´t you dare start crying, now. Like you don´t deserve to feel the pain. I´m a Stark. I´m made of iron. I caught the tears with my sleeve and sat up.
As members of the team started reading out battle reports Tony sunk deeper into his chair and fell asleep. He woke up to a laughing Clint and a Natasha who threw paper balls at him. Tony responded with a groan.
There were a lot of things Nat expected when she walked into the living room. But she would have never guessed to find the boys sleeping on the couch. They were cuddled together with Tony halfway sitting/lying in Steve’s lap and their arms around each other. She picked out her phone and made a photo. Oh, that was going to go on the fridge.
I made my way out of his room and down to the workshop. Natasha gave me a suspicious glance as I walked by, but I just shook my head and she let it drop for now.
He lifted me up and carried me bridal style to my room. I hid my face in his chest and let my tears flow on his shirt. A little bit ashamed for letting my guard down that easily. He patted my hair.
“Tony, baby I need you to listen to me now very careful. Can you show me your beautiful eyes for a moment.” I waited until he turned his head and I had his whole attention. “You´re not a mess. You´re the most kindest and smartest baby I know and you´re my hero. Howard was never able to be as perfect as you are and don´t let anyone tell you it´s wrong to let others take care of you and be vulnerable. I promise you whenever you feel the need you can come to me, no matter if you´re big or little.” Tony had big eyes and a blush on his cheeks. Shy he shoved his head back into my neck. I patted his head softly while my other hand still hold him securely under his butt.
“Don´t like sleeping.” He stared into my eyes for a moment longer, seeming to tell I was lying. He frowned but didn´t ask about it.
I took a long breath trying to get back to sleep. It worked very well until my pillow moved. I had to try very hard to stop myself from screaming. My eyes flew open. There was …Steve. OMG. Wait no…
“Go!” Steve´s voice was angry and held a clear warning. He moved and stood right in front of me his gaze still on them. My omega brain screamed panic at his movement but took also pride in him defending us and swooned a little bit at our mate.
I leaned back in the couch and pulled out my phone. I tried to concentrate on the things I was doing but my mind kept drifting back to Steve. We managed to stay like this for about an hour before Steve´s stomach growled. Right, supersoldier metabolism.
“I´m not skinny.” A frown appeared at his forehead. Ok, I met a sensible spot. “You know how much force it takes to work in a workshop or to be Ironman? Just because I´m an omega doesn´t mean I´m “skinny”. We´ve earned rights since the 1940s ´you knew that, Steven?”
Of course my mother loved me, at least at some point I guess. But she too, wanted to get loved by Howard, didn´t care about my love. But when I was really  young there were times when she would pick me up and play piano for me or speak to me in soft Italian.
“Slowly, Tony.” He leaned down and kissed me. His hips started moving and if it wasn´t for the kiss. I would’ve screamed and moaned. I heard my wet walls squelch around his manhood. His lips turned into a smile.
“Hmm, Guess you´ll have to take a bath little-one to find that out.” I looked at daddy and considered it. Water was bad but mrter duck sounded fun. I tried to look like I was making a big decision and hummed before I broke out into laughter. Daddy chimed in.
“Ohh.” Damn it. Steve sighed. Oh come on, whose idea was it to let the alpha hear the omega’s thoughts. Now it´s just easier to stop me from everything. Fuck.
(Steve is a sheep. Guess I´m the first one to compare human perfection to our dorkiest animal. But that´s what fanfictions are for.)
“Tired.” He heard the sleepy voice mumble. “I know, but you have to eat something. You can sleep right after. Just eat, please.” Tony didn´t stop frowning but he opened his mouth and accepted the food. He almost managed to eat the whole plate before he started to refuse and hid his face in Steve´s shoulder.
Well, now I´m at the point where my template ends and I´ll actually have to come up with new ideas and i´ll be completely free with what to write.
“Yes, alpha, please.” I eagerly sucked on his big long fingers and coated them in my spit. Before long he pulled his fingers out of my mouth and let his hand slide into the back of my pants. He looked into my eyes as he slowly sank a two fingers in my hole and started moving them around.
“Still missed you.” He sat down on my lap and rubbed his ass over my groin. I felt my erection grow and he started sucking on my neck.
It was so cute seeing the baby wake up and looking completely confused when he found the pacifier in his mouth and it made me so happy to hear him call me daddy. I couldn´t but not tickle him to make him laugh that beautiful laughter of my cutey.
“Holy crap!” Everyone´s eyes turned to look at him, but Tony couldn´t care less in that moment. He just jumped up and tried to hide behind Steve and held onto the bigger men. His face was completely pale and his eyes were wide.
Everything was happy and perfect until suddenly the sheep was gone. I started calling for the sheep. I gave him the name...Uhhh....I called it Steve, okey? Stupid mind makes up stupid dreams. I called for Steve and then the sheep returned. I didn´t wanted it to leave me again so I clinged onto it and didn´t let it go. The sheep tried to get me down, but it didn´t work out.
“Tony,” Steve had gasped in horror, looking around at the frankly incredible amount of empty bottles rattling against each other on the floor. Even Tony was a little impressed with himself. “What did you do?”
His crying is so loud that when he hears the elevator door open again, he hardly registers it. He can’t bring himself to stop the tears, even though it’s embarrassing as all living hell. It’s probably just Natasha, Steve reasons. And Natasha misses him too. She’ll understand.
“Worry about yourself,” Steve responds. The same kind, teasing smile slowly grows itself back onto his lips which Tony is very suddenly reminded of kissing. “I’ll get him if he’s gone too long. You just get some rest.”
Steve turns to look at him, hoping he can convey how dumb that fucking question was through facial expression alone, but stops short when he sees just how deep the sadness is etched into the doctor’s face. Dark, bruise-like shadows fall under red-rimmed eyes; bitten lips pursed into a tight line on the verge of quivering.
Didn’t stop until FRIDAY finally overwrote her protocol to allow in one worried-out-of-his-fucking-mind-are-you-kidding-me-tony supersoldier.
“JARVIS?” Tony had asked, slumping onto his desk where he could comfortably thunk his head against the edge.
“My kid is— my kid is dead. Your best friend—“ Tony felt Steve’s fingers try to pull away, but he was weak and drunk so he held tight, “is dead. Vision is gone and. And we— we lost. We lost.” Steve was silent, waiting for him to continue, still not quite understanding. “After we lost this much I can’t— I can’t lose you, and it’s so funny because. Because I already lost you, haven’t I?” Tony watched as his ex-lover’s face fell, unguarded and vulnerable. He looked so soul crushingly sad that he almost regretted speaking his mind. But he knew he was right. He just wanted to hear him say it. “Haven’t I?”
“Oh, God,” Steve says. It becomes a mantra, something he can’t stop saying because oh, god. Oh, god. Tony is alive. “Oh, God. Thank God.”
thank you so much for your support on the first chapter!! this is my first ever marvel fic and it’s been so much fun writing it.
And Tony’s heard just about e-fucking-nough of this, so he clenches his wrist to fire the repulsor, killing the idiot where he stands.
Steve jerked back like he’d been fucking shot, springing up from where he’d been kneeling so fast that it made Tony’s head hurt just washing it. Not a strip of skin on the man wasn’t flushed violently red.
“Yes! Yes, okay, I’ll get the thingies on the bottom, you take the top!” The kid, cheerfully bouncing, swung out a web and vanished at being given the all clear.
“Don’t you fucking ‘Miss Potts’ me! You think— you think that what you do only affects you? That other people don’t give a shit?”
He’s been able to breathe since the serum, is what’s so funny about that. The serum took care of his asthma, you see, and he never struggled for breath after that.
“Tony,” he coughs, hardly intelligible but he just knows down to the soul of who he is that the other man will understand. “Tony, I—“
Exiting the suit required him to let go of Peter for a second, and in that second, the kid tried to collapse. Tony caught him before he could, slinging him up into a bridal carry, predicting and thus far not being made upset when the action was met by weak protests.
Some place where the bald man smiles, and says, “everyone thinks you’re dead Stark. And no one gives a shit.”
Pepper was the next to arrive, and she didn’t say much either. Just her classic, “Oh, Tony.” A watery grin that was somehow as sincere as it was sad.
“Yeah,” Tony managed, clearing his throat a little, still in shock that Steve gave enough of a shit about what Tony thought of him to try and explain something so trivial as first impressions. “I wouldn’t sweat it, Cap. I know I can be a real dickbag---”
It’s a game to keep him from thinking about what he knows. Because when he thinks about that, his already shit mood gets impossibly worse.
But Tony was feeling a little more angry than usual that day. And he looked over at his father’s headstone; saw that someone had placed cherry-red roses on Howard’s tombstone.
“Are you certain, Sir? I could contact Rogers for assistance. He has recently arrived at the tower and appears to have nothing scheduled.”
“I can’t watch you do this, Tony,” she’d told him one night when he came home with bullets embedded in the suit. “I’m not gonna stay here and watch you die. I won’t.”
Steve falls to his knees. He’s covered in blood and self-inflicted bruises, but it doesn’t hurt anything like how he used to hurt. There is no stomaching this. There is no rhyme or reason. This doesn’t blend. If only he’d known how lucky he was then. When the love of his stupid, worthless life was still breathing beside him. He had had no idea what it was to ache.
“You—“ he has to stop to pant, pupils rolling into the back of his head for one glorious moment, but he somehow manages a smug smirk that raises every hair on Steve’s (now pencil-thin) neck “—you— can’t.”
Fuck. This is how he dies. Not in the blaze of American glory during some righteous battle, but on the floor of New York’s seediest hotel. Having an asthma attack like he’s just that sick kid from Brooklyn again.
He thinks maybe Steve loves him. Or, no— did love him. Loved him. Past tense. But then Tony must have peeled off too many layers; exposed the most broken parts of himself between their lazy workshop days, failed missions, and post-nightmare discussions. And that’s not Steve’s fault.
“And who the fuck are you?” Tony snarls, shifting his left-handed repulsor to him. But the man doesn’t even flinch. Doesn’t react in the slightest. Tony feels a chill run up his spine.
“Tony, I—“ Steve begins, rattling Tony from his thoughts. “I want to tell you something. Something I’ve been thinking about for a long time.”
“What’s happening’, Cap’n?” Tony asks, trying to keep the annoyance he feels from his tone and only narrowly succeeding. “Did Clint get stuck in a vent again?”
Because he’d won. He had the most wonderful son (Peter), the most caring family (Pepper, Rhodey.) And he had had the best love. He had Steve.
Tony was older when death next came knocking. He was eighteen and stupid; drinking down his demons just to vomit them into his unreasonably high tech toilet (MIT wanted him to redo their plumbing as community service for all the hell he raised there) the next morning.
And as he stood over Jarvis’ grave, knowing no one loved him like that anymore, he cried. His father would punish him for it later.
JARVIS alerts him to a screen notification that indicates the arrival of the cops, so Tony finally feels comfortable enough to turn around and get some sweet, sweet preemptive revenge for the migraine he’s about to be nursing for the next few days.
Steve tilted a little, making some of that beautiful, golden hair fall into his face as he laughed. “You’re rambling.”
Held his kid tight, and knew every sacrifice they’d ever made to get to this point was worth it. Because Peter was in his arms. Safe. Sound.
And he wants to tell Steve the truth. Wants to tell him how he loves him. Wants to be ready for the day that’s really his last. Wants to die with no words stuck in his throat.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony said on impulse, and good God was he going for the record for how many times he could interrupt Steve in a single conversation? “I said some things about you, too. Things that I didn’t mean. Well, I mean, I did mean them then but--- I don’t mean them now. I suppose I never really meant them, though. I just didn’t know you, you know? Not that that’s an excuse, but---”
And Tony supposes he has the rest of the team. They’ve become a family of sorts— as dysfunctional as shit, but still a family. They care about him enough— at least as a teammate— to want Tony to be well. He doesn’t know if they necessarily love him (conveniently omitting from his mind the fact he knows with all his soul that he loves them, because that shit just hurts) but they don’t want him to die.
Steve and Tony got off on the wrong foot.  It wasn’t anyone’s fault, and it didn’t exactly take a prophet to predict that a man from the 1940s and the world’s leading futurist would have a couple of compatibility issues.
“We won, Mister Stark,” the kid had cried, holding his good hand (though he couldn’t really feel the pressure, he was comforted nonetheless.) “Dad— We won, Tony. We won…”
“You’re so funny, Mister Stark,” Peter said, deadpan, though Tony could hear him working a little faster over the comm line. “Anyone ever tell you that you should be a stand-up—“
“I just—“ Tony started, only to break off in giggles. Didn’t they always say that laughing was in really close proximity to sobbing one’s ass off. “This is hilarious, isn’t it?”
“Save it, Steve. You’re going to be just fine, don’t you dare tell me ‘just in case’ or I’ll kill you myself. I swear, don’t test me.”
And Steve has seen so many people fight for breath in his life. He saw Dr. Erskine spit up blood from his lungs (dead), watched Bucky gasp in the winter air when he fell (dead), witnessed his mom pass on from tuberculosis, choking up oxygen till her last day (dead).
So that night, and every other night that Tony tried to pull himself back from the grief by running into the arms of whatever rager was being thrown, Rhodey waited. He stayed up into the wee hours of the morning, even if he had school the next day, to take care of Tony. He put water down his throat, food into his stomach, sleep into his brain. And he didn’t say anything. Even when Tony was screeching profanities, crying out, “Maria!” in the dead of night, throwing up on Rhodey’s shoes, he was silent. Steady.
Steve, though— Steve understood, if the cracked falling of his (beautiful, beautiful, so much more beautiful than any star) face was anything to go by.
“No, you need to get out of here,” Tony demanded, voice much steadier than he felt. They didn’t know how strong the bombs were, whether or not the protection of their uniforms would save them. And he would never, ever take a chance if it was a bet on Peter’s safety. “I’m almost done with mine, I’ll deal with yours, just get the hell out of—“
Peter came next, and he was young. It was only natural to be scared. Confused. Tony once felt the same, what feels like a million years ago.
Rhodey didn’t try to make sense out of it for him. He didn’t try to put any of it to words, and Tony loved him for that. When the whole world came up to him (in grocery stores, at parties, mid-funeral) wanting to know just what the hell the world was going to do without their best weapons supplier, Rhodey was by his side to give him the only genuine answer: no answer at all.
“Tony,” Steve began, and wasn’t that a fucking gut punch to hear his name, spoken in the voice that was once so righteous now so broken. He looked at Tony, and he looked at him with breathtaking grief. “We lost—- we lost. All of us.”
Rhodey came first, landed soft on the earth, flipped up his face plate. He was so steady. Strong. Silent. Just as he’d always been when Tony needed him to be. He didn’t try to talk. He knew there was nothing that needed to be said, no words that could be put to this. They both knew what one another meant.
“Aren’t you old enough to be calling me Tony?” he asks, just to be an asshole. He knows Peter’s answer.
There’s a deeper darkness beyond the inside of a closed eyelid. There is a darker, more peaceful night after the moon has dimmed her light.
Tony can’t speak. He can’t smile, or cry, or ask why the AI sounds so somber when everything’s alright now, because Steve’s not gone. He’s found. Tony found him.
Anticipating him, because it honestly felt like Steve knew Tony better than he knew himself most days, he closed the gap between them; pressing his lips ever so softly against Tony’s in a gentle, loving kiss.
“Don’t talk back to your old man. I’m feeble and tired,” Tony shot back, but there was no real heat in his tone. He loved that kid like he was his own (and wasn’t he, by now?) Peter knew it, too, if his light laugh crackling through the comms was anything to go by. “So what’s your plan, kid?”
“I get my hours,” he says, waving her off with a shaky, admittedly overly-caffeinated hand. “We can’t be having siestas all the time, now can we?”
“My mom,” Tony blurted. He didn’t really feel like he was in control of his own mouth, but it moved anyway. “My— my parents. They, uh. They…” And for all his genius, he couldn’t get the words together in his head. It didn’t make sense. It didn’t click right. All he could get out was, “It was a car crash, Rhodey. And they… They didn’t—“
“Will you go look for him if he’s not back soon?” Tony says, looking to Steve. “I think I’m entitled to worry.”
He finds Tony’s staring at him like he’s the sun; like he’s having a world altering epiphany or being born again under a new god.
And the guy that was losing his goddamn mind with happiness earlier goes flying across the space from a well-placed repulsor blast.
“You know, Dad, the most pathetic part of all of this is I’m grieving you, too. Mom makes sense.” He shrugged, as if making an allowance. “But you? You fucking hated me.” The laugh that ripped out of him was acidic; burned like bile, but it was all kind of funny, wasn’t it? Funny in the way that isn’t funny at all? Funny in the way that it hurts like hell every waking moment of his stupid life? “You hated me and wished I’d never been born, both things you legitimately said to me at some point--- and I still want to see you one last time.”
He’s not forgetting now, though. Now he knows. It’s practically all he knows. He’s learned the hilarious lesson. Earned penance for his prior lack of humor about the situation by constantly aching in a way that only the weakest of the weak do.
That thinking makes him feel cold again, but a blanket comes a short while later, feeling sunwarm and soft as it goes across his shoulders. It helps with the chill, and it makes him feel heavy in a way that’s so pleasant, his will doesn’t stand a chance.
The suits spreads itself up his body from his wrist watch at his command, covering him in the familiar and comfortable armor. Lights flash in front of his face, verifying identity before the schematics explode in front of him to show all available information about the situation.
“Please, take your time, Stephen,” Ass Clown taunts, and fuck if it doesn’t make him feel so much worse to know the man who just took the only part of his life that was remotely valuable and destroyed it is standing right there above him, and Steve isn’t anywhere near strong enough to make him pay. He’s too weak. Nothing special anymore. “You have an abundance of it.”
He was afraid. Afraid they’d change his mind. Afraid Natasha would tell him he was being irrational, Thor would say he’d bet his hammer that Steve couldn’t ever hurt Tony, or Clint would drop his class clown act for just a minute to talk him down from the ledge he’d built just to jump off it.
And Steve is so pathetic, he races to his shaking feet at that, presses his hands up on the glass, blinks tears from his eye so he can see his mouth move— hear him speak just one more time.
He can’t quit coughing, even when stiff hands are yanking him up so the wet, copper taste spills over his lips instead of the back of his mouth, and he doesn’t want to open his eyes, as cowardly as it is. He doesn’t want to see pity in Tony’s beautiful face. He doesn’t want to feel the shame that comes with it before he dies.
Steve loves him like he hasn’t loved anyone else his whole life long. This was his chance to prove it, the great, big moment of truth: choosing between Tony’s safety, and Steve’s happiness.
And it was worth it, because Tony heard a voice. The voice that made him invent time travel, shift realities, move the world over just to hear it again.
They always have him sit on the inside seat of every restaurant they go to, like they’re united by the common goal of standing between Tony Stark and whatever danger could crawl through IHOP’s door at six p.m.
Tony just clenched his face, shook his head, rocked slowly in the chair because if he didn’t move— if he didn’t do something, he’d break. And he couldn’t break yet. Not if he wanted to be home.
Steve looks frantic then, sputtering, “I know that it’s bad timing and I should have told you a long time ago because Tony, I’ve loved you for a long, long time and then I lost you and I thought I’d never get to tell you but I—“
“You’re distracting me from reaching sonic speeds while I’m disassembling my sixth bomb,” Tony lied, having just reached the floor with the next detonator, hoping to shift them back to focus through Peter’s compulsive, competitive need to be the fastest.
“No, it’s too risky,” Tony interrupted. God, what he’d become. His younger self wouldn’t recognize the paranoid old man that Peter (because Jesus, the kid was a danger magnet and if anything happened to him, Tony didn’t know what he would do)  had made him. “We don’t know if that’s even possible.”
“Look, Miss Potts,” he began, finally throwing the mask onto the desk. His hands were shaking. Fuck. He was trying to do the right thing. He’d done the wrong thing for as long as he could remember, and he had to make it right. He didn’t have a choice. “I just—“
“You think they’ll bury the armor, in place of your body?” Baldie had asked, still wearing that stupid fucking smile. “I just hope they can make do, is all.”
Tony, who Steve lost two days ago. Tony, with bruises and blood and dirt and mud all over him. Tony, wearing a horrified expression that doesn’t make sense because he’s breathing.
“What?” Steve cuts in, voice like knives and steel even to his own ears. He knows objectively, somewhere in the very back of his brain, that talking like this to a man who transforms into a ten-foot, green rage-monster when upset is probably a bad idea, but he can’t stop himself. He’s angry. He’s so fucking angry. “What? What do I have to do? What the fuck do you want me to do, Bruce?”
“Go back to sleep, Tony,” Nat interjects. There’s no room for argument in her tone, and when Tony turns to look at her, her face doesn’t betray any weakness of conviction. “Thor will be here when you wake up. We all will.”
“I don’t think you’re the one holding the bargaining chips here. Which I understand may be a foreign concept to you,,” Ass Clown says, smile audible in his tone. “Don’t you want to know---”
There’s a sharp stabbing pain the same arm Natasha is holding, and then a low burn that spreads up his shoulder. It hurts, but not as bad as the pain in his lungs which is only getting worse, and worse, and worse and
Maybe it’s because Howard didn’t set the best example; spending damn near every minute in his office. Or maybe it’s because Tony doesn’t know who he is without his work. Or maybe it doesn’t matter at all why he can’t seem to just give it a goddamn rest (which is what he’s tried to tell the many, many unsatisfied therapists he’s had over the years.)
“You can rest now, Tony,” he whispered, smiling through the tears that streamed through the dirt and the mud of his face. “You did so well.”
“Don’t,” Tony near shouts, shaking himself out of his stupor. Fuck, he thinks. Pull it together. “Run it for me one more time.”
Baldie’s grin got impossibly bigger. “I wanted your head on a stake to start with. But now, I reason, why can’t I have more?”
“Only a little,” she’d laughed. The sound was sweet like the strawberries she was allergic to, and Tony felt almost overcome. He wasn’t supposed to have heard that laugh ever again. But he did. Because he lived. God knows why, but he lived. “I hate job hunting.”
“First priority is getting these idiots out of here,” Tony tells JARVIS under his breath. “Police have already been alerted?”
Tony hangs his head. God fucking... The only times Steve doesn’t bring his notebook are the times that he’s either gonna lecture Tony, try to get him to go to bed, or inform him of the time. None of which Tony particularly cares for.
He loves New York, because the three people perched on a dumpster behind him hardly spare a parting glance when he takes off running from the building he must have been held captive in for (two, maybe three? it’s hard to keep track) days. No one here gives half a shit if your hands are caked in blood, your face dripping sweat. They’re like wasps; if you leave them alone, they’ll leave you alone.
“Really, I’m fine,” Tony insists. And because Tony is still concussed and dumb as hell and his humor when he’s like this straight up sucks, he says, smirking, “You only wish I wasn’t.”
Tony couldn’t maintain his grip. And he tried. He tried to hold on, but an airborne desk slammed into his side and it shook him so hard he couldn’t feel his hands and
Steve barely gets to his feet, legs shaking with the weight of his body. With the weight of hope because
To Steve’s credit, he didn’t do anything but smile. So warm and patient that the sun could take notes and learn from him.
“Heaven, I’m in heaven,” Steve had sung along, swaying them back and forth. He shifted Tony’s hand till it was resting over his chest, and Tony couldn’t think of anywhere else he’d rather be. “And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak.”
“Hold my hand, Mom,” he’d whispered to her, remembering all the times Jarvis had done the same for him. Comforted him when he was scared. It was all Tony could do to just try to stomach the sadness when he thought of how Jarvis should have been holding his hand, but couldn’t anymore. His palms were a Lord’s kingdom away, or so they told him. Tony pled, because he didn’t know what else to do, “You’ll feel better, Mom. I promise. Just hold my hand.”
“Captain, I advise for you to take a deep breath,” JARVIS says, calm and quiet, sure and steady. If Steve didn’t know better, it would be like he was being made fun of. He’s asking him to do the one thing he can’t.
He wondered for a while how they managed to pry him out of his armor (the thing is damn near indestructible, he should know, he built it that way), but that’s something else Tony knows now, too.
“Let’s give Steve some space, guys,” Nat ends up saying— sounding only a little bit strangled. A little bit like the world is ending. She gets up from the sofa, touches Clint on the shoulder, gathers Bruce and Thor on her way. It’s obvious her intent is to take care of them before herself as she herds them all into the elevator. And even though Steve has been nothing but cruel tonight, she says in all softness, “We’ll see you in the morning, Cap.”
“In the parking lot to your left, sir. There appears to be five heavily armed targets in a vacant lot on the twenty-second floor,” JARVIS says, breaking him from his thoughts.
The sobs wrack him in earnest; ripping up through his aching chest and out his stupid mouth that’s never gonna get to kiss Tony goodnight, never gonna get to say he’s sorry, never gonna tell him that sometimes when he watches Tony work, he thinks for the first time since coming out of the ice— he’s gonna be okay. Because Tony is dead. He’s dead.
“It’s okay.” Thick tears rolled down her cheeks, slipping into the corners of her smiling mouth. “We’re all gonna be okay, now. Thank you, Tony.”
The weight of the stupid, stupid teenager that he loved so much was the sweetest thing in the world as Tony careened them away from the waiting scene of EMTs and police officers. They didn’t need that.
He’s usually too tired to do anything but fall into the black abyss of sleep when he finally gets the chance; just an empty void where he rests. Peaceful. Quiet.
They’d know it, too, if they could have seen him practically flying up the stairs; leaping across them five at a time. They’d never have told tiny Tom to be brave at the doctor like Cap is if they’d watched him pack his duffel bag so hard and fast he ripped half the clothes before the zipper got pulled up.
It was by chance that Jarvis saw him limping through the halls (he was supposed to have been gone hours ago, home with his wife and cat.) And Jarvis, because he loved him in all the ways his father didn’t, hadn’t been angry with Tony. He’d just picked up the crying little boy, hushed him gently, tucked him into bed so incredibly carefully and said, “I’ll be back in a moment’s time, Master Anthony.” He even shut the door soft when he left.
He’s drenched in the comedy gold of it all; the great, all-mighty Captain America— reduced back to Stephen Rogers: a five-foot, one-hundred pound asthmatic who can’t even fight a cold, much less the injustices of the world.
The small family laughs the night away. They talk about Peter’s internship awkward moments, Pepper attempting to navigate the rescue armor, Rhodey’s idiot coworkers, Tony and Steve’s coincidentally best and worst parent moments till they’re all shedding happy tears. They talk all the way up until the early hours of the morning, and Maria’s fallen asleep in the crook of Tony’s neck, drooling down his shirt.
God, if Banner asks him to one more movie night when they clearly don’t really want him there, he thinks he might turn the tables and Hulk out on Bruce.
He gets the feeling that the Tony on the other side doesn’t want it to break. (And fuck, if that doesn’t make it hurt somehow impossibly worse.)
And Steve loves Tony like he’s never loved anyone his whole life long. But it’s not enough to keep him here— it’s just not.
“... That is vastly superior, thanks, I agree,” Peter said, obviously trying to get a playful rise out of him. Tony smiled despite his best efforts.
There’s a silence filled only by his airless crying. Tony breaks it abruptly, without warning: “Steve.”
