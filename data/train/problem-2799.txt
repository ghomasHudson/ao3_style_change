"I need to call Uncle Bobby to ask him to send a tow truck."  Dean pulled out his phone and looked at it in disgust. "No bars, Cas. How's your phone?"
Dean started to retreat toward the gate between the properties.  He said in a low crooning voice, “Who wants a bright red, shiny apple? Bowser wants a bright red, shiny apple.”
Lightning struck near the Impala again. Dean swerved and the Impala careened into the ditch. Castiel pitched forward through windshield, while Dean's chest was bruised upon the steering wheel. Dean opened the door and staggered into the rain until he saw Castiel laying in the ditch, partially submerged in the water. Blood dripped from Castiel's forehead where the glass from the windshield had sliced him. Dean tried to pick Castiel up but slid into the mud and fell. When he couldn't find his footing to stand, he crouched in the water holding Castiel's head above the current. Dean shouted fruitlessly at the sky, "Chuck, you son of a bitch, what the hell are you doing?"
“If you had listened to Henry, he would have told you he was a horrible father. He set all the wrong examples. Dad, I’m not trying to hurt you. I’m just saying, I need something else.”
Dean shook his head, "No, I had no clue. I wonder if anyone has been paying the taxes or if the place is even still standing." The last time Dean had seen his grandfather, he was ten. Dean was now approaching thirty-five.
Sam snorted, "You were pulling your hair out in frustration because the kids caught one of the sets on fire the other day. You almost had to call the fire department."
"So, what do you think? He can come to stay in the third bedroom even before I move out. He agreed to the rent that we discussed when we talked about renting the room." Sam looked at him earnestly.
“Not trite. Maybe a little optimistic. It’s one of the things I like about you, Cas. You see the good and the silver lining in things. I might be a little more jaded.”
Dean glanced over at the charcoal grey pants and jacket Castiel wore. He had a dark-colored shirt with a tie that again matched his eyes. “Looking good, Cas.”
They continued to reminisce about their childhood pranks while eating breakfast. After they were done, Castiel rinsed the dishes and put them in the dishwasher. As they were preparing to leave, Castiel asked, "Want to go to the farmer's market with me? I need to set up my booth there. Jack will join me after his movie is over. It will give you a chance to meet everyone. The Saturday morning farmer's market is the 'in' place to be."
"Not telling me that you have the most awesome roommate ever. Cas is amazing. He laughs at all my jokes. He brings me Snickers ice cream when he comes to visit, and he gave me a Princess Leia t-shirt for my birthday. Unlike you, who totally forgot my birthday. Cas is about to replace you as my best friend because he offered to be my handmaiden at the next LARP event if you are unable to fulfill your handmaidenly duty."
Dean replied, "Sam found that years ago on a case. I didn't even know we had it still. Let me see it."
Castiel smirked, "Dean, this is the part you say 'I know.' Princess Leia responded with that after Han said it first."
A whistling noise erupted from back the trunk of the Impala. Dean jumped up startled, "What the hell?" Light came from the seams of the trunk.
“I’ve only been here for a little while, Dad. It takes time to fix twenty years of disuse." He added pointedly, " Maybe if I had known about it earlier.”
Dean sighed ruefully, "Until a week ago I oversaw marketing at my dad's publishing company. But it was time for me to move on and find my own way. So, I'm between jobs. I only found out a week ago that Henry left me the place."
Castiel stared at Dean, stunned. After he regained his composure, he said, "Dean, I think I might have taken advantage of you when you were younger. I… I have no explanation. I'm sorry."
Castiel rubbed the back of Dean's neck. "It's ok. No harm, no foul. I have snacks in my backpack. There are some cokes in your cooler. There are trees to go behind if we need to pee. You have a couple of blankets in the back seat. We can just sleep in the car until morning. Then we can hike until we get phone reception. It's ok. It will be fun. Like a sleepover."
Rufus’s face softened for the first time. “He knew it was your dad keeping you away when you were younger. He was never mad at you. He wasn’t mad at anyone. Just sad. Your granddad was a good man, Dean. Not a soul in this town will say otherwise. He sure was a terrible fisherman though. Always wanted to catch that wily catfish in the lake and never did.”
Chuck let go of Jack and said, "Ending this story. It's a hack job and it's time to ditch this draft."
"Instead of playing fifty questions in the barn, why don't you meet me up at my house in forty minutes. Maybe you could get some shoes on.” He looked ruefully at Dean’s feet. “So far, you've avoided the cow paddies that the girls like to leave behind willy-nilly. But shit happening is a thing that occurs several times here daily. Colonel should let you cross the yard now without attacking you on sight. Roberta is on the front porch, but she probably will sleep through you coming."
"I worked with Kelly. She edited my books, and we became friends. She got involved with someone who turned out not to be a good person. He's in prison now. I offered to marry her and adopt Jack when she told me she was pregnant. We figured if I were on the birth certificate, he'd never be able to try to get custody of Jack if he ever gets out. She moved here and we got married. She had the baby. Nobody was the wiser. It was mutually beneficial because Claire would get a mom; Jack would get a dad. We'd have a perfect, stereotypical family. Only, breast cancer happened and took Kelly from me. Kelly and I were extremely close friends. She was family.”
"Fixing cars works for me. I could use a damn apprentice if you don't mind getting your hands dirty," Bobby said dryly.
He pulled the lawnmower out of the shed and cleaned it off. When he tried to start it, it didn't even try to come to life. Dean muttered, "Figures. The gas probably evaporated years ago." He pulled out his phone and started a list: paint, hinges, nails, gas, two-by-fours. It was going to be a lengthy list. He frowned. Maybe buying a new lawnmower would be easier than trying to resurrect this dinosaur. He grumbled about being thwarted in his first attempt to be productive. He turned and his eyes fell on the truck. He smiled before going to his car and retrieving his tools. Fixing Henry's truck would be a good first step so he could haul around everything he needed to repair the place.
"How would you know? You usually need a set of parents to have children. Kelly died when Jack was four. Breast cancer. Six years ago, now. Jack is ten and Claire is fourteen. They like to test my patience sometimes, but they're good kids." Castiel gestured for Dean to sit down while he poured two glasses of orange juice before sitting across from him. "Help yourself to the French toast."
Castiel smiled at him wryly, "I was so full of righteousness I wanted to make a big entrance so you would be suitably impressed before I told you God had work for you to do. The sparks, the lights, the thunder, completely unnecessary. But since you couldn't hear my real voice without dying, I wanted to impress you in other ways."
"I sent him to the cage that he locked me in. I'm tired of his tantrums. All he ever does is whine about his work. He didn't want a sister; he wanted a therapist. I'm so tired of him," she shook her head. "I thought he enjoyed creating, but all he really enjoyed was having things his way. I'm so over that."
Then, his mom Mary died, and the visits abruptly ended. Dean sighed. It had been years since he thought of those summers that his mom brought him and, later, Sam to the farm. After his mom died, his father had neither the time nor the interest to take the kids to see their grandfather. At first, Dean would call Grandpa Henry every month or so, but his dad removed phone privileges after he was late to the dinner table once too often because he was talking to Henry. A few years later, John casually mentioned that Henry had died the previous year. Dean had never had the chance to say goodbye. Hell, Dean didn't even know how Henry died.
Dean Winchester strode down the hallway of his family's publishing firm. He entered his office and angrily slammed the door with a resounding thud behind him. He took a couple of deep breaths. He ran his fingers through his short sandy hair in frustration and was startled when his brother cleared his throat behind him.
Dean grumbled, "Who is this guy you want to offer our spare room to anyhow? And why do we have to do it at the carnival?"
Sam rolled his eyes, "I've told you dozens of times about stuff we were doing. You just don't listen."
"Hell, no. I just think we got here despite ourselves. We sort of really sabotaged each other a lot."
Castiel almost choked on his beer before sputtering, "Me and Charlie?" He laughed loudly before saying, "Rowena, her girlfriend, would turn me into a frog or something if I even looked at her." Castiel pointed to a small, willowy redhead in a corner who was talking to a tall blonde woman. "That's Rowena. They've been together for years. They met in an online forum and started to date virtually. Rowena moved here from Scotland, and they got together in real life."
"He doesn't want us to do chores Sunday mornings," Claire responded. "When Mom was alive, we'd go to church. Dad doesn't take us anymore, but he wants us to relax and be thankful on Sunday mornings."
When the smell of popcorn and grilled hamburgers wafted over to them, Castiel suggested, "Sam, Dean, you want to get some lunch?" Without looking back Castiel started to glide his way across the crowded fairgrounds. He worked his way through the crowd effortlessly, while Sam and Dean struggled to keep up.
"His brother, Gabe, manages the carnival. Cas is just helping him here this weekend while it's in town. You'll do fine with Cas as your roommate. He's a teacher too. You can share teacherish things."
"I think that is because they thought it was funny too but had to appease Adler by grounding us. He's still around and is still a jerk."
Castiel and Dean stared at each other across the library table. Castiel with his brow furrowed said, "I healed Sam? I don't remember that."
“I made up my mind, Cas. My life is here. You and I – we deserve our chance of happiness together. I’m not sure where the road is going to take us, but I know I want to be on that road trip with you.”
Dean nodded and said, "Thanks for the invitation. See you in a bit then, Cas." He walked a wide circle around the Colonel but made it safely back to his own house. He took a quick shower and dressed in faded jeans and a well-worn green plaid shirt.
Now that the hysteria had left him, he could think over the events of the night objectively.  Pam had said that Sam had likely had a lung infection for weeks, which meant the little shit had been keeping it to himself and lying to Dean about it.  Why the hell would he do that?  He knew how easily something like that could turn dire.  He’d been there for all the talks, all the discussions, he KNEW all it would was one untreated infection, one bad bout of the flu, pneumonia, almost anything attacking his already immuno-compromised system and… that would be it.  Why would he lie?  Why would he keep it from Dean?
Bobby had apparently had enough.  He slapped his hand down on the wooden table before them.  The sound of it startled the brothers and they jerked upright anxiously.  “I may be old, Dean, but I’m not in a nursing home yet!  You expect me to believe you’ve just been relaxing somewhere in the South without a care in the world?  That you’ve basically retired like some kind of snowbird to Florida?”
Bobby huffed at him in irritation and scratched under his ball cap.  “Fine.  What do you want me to know?”
The boys had grown up in British Columbia for their whole lives, so seeing totem poles dotting the landscapes were as common as the trees.  Frequently topping the giant hand-carved monoliths were native depictions of thunderbirds.  Dean wasn’t all that familiar with the teachings of the First Nations, but the image of the creature itself was one he knew quite well.
And with that, he grabbed his duffel and ducked neatly under Cas’s outstretched wing.  He was so excited to finally be able to see his brother that his only thoughts during their bizarre interdimensional space flight were of home.  As such, he was woefully unprepared for the change in temperature.
His fingers closed around the cool handle of a revolver and he felt a little of the tension bleed from his shoulders. Ok, he had a gun, now he just needed to see this thing so he could take a shot.
Bobby’s eyes widened in surprise before narrowing again suspiciously.  He glanced between Dean and Sam swiftly a few times before reaching towards a large kitchen knife near the sink.  Sam was at least quick to intervene at this point and stepped swiftly back in front of Dean.
“Yeah, point taken.”  Dean muttered.  Apparently that was all he was going to get out of him on the subject.  Oh well.  “Anyway, you wanna watch a movie or something?”
Dean sucked on his upper lip slowly, thinking about how to answer.  “I think… you’ve got too much free time now that you aren’t dying.”
The bizarre air currents that licked at his cheeks had also changed from cool and biting to something warmer and drier.  He closed his eyes again as the feeling of it was drying his eyes out.  Surely they would reach their destination soon?  He didn’t know anything about birds, especially not mythical, no one’s ever heard of them birds.  But, he DID know that there weren’t any birds at the South Pole.  He frowned and racked his brain for a moment.  Well, he didn’t THINK there were any birds at the South Pole.  Fuck, he should have paid more attention in school.
“Find something better out there?”  Bobby asked, though from his tone, Dean suspected that he wasn’t counting on it.
Dean and Sam both chuckled and just like that, the mood eased in the kitchen.  Dean was grateful for it, yesterday had been more than emotional enough.  He’d like to spend the rest of his time here laughing and relaxing.
Bobby stepped closer to Dean and rested one of his large, rough hands on the man’s shoulders.  They stayed like that for a moment.  Neither of them was very good with words, but they understood each other perfectly.  Dean appreciated the comfort his surrogate father was offering and he relished the feeling of it.  Bobby clapped his comfortingly a few times before stepping away.  He nodded to Dean with an uncomfortable half-smile before nodding his head towards the stairs.
Dean grit his teeth in anger and reached blindly into the trunk for something else. His finger caught the sharp edge of a knife and he ignored the pain that bloomed in the digit in favor of gripping its handle.
He awoke the next morning before the sun had risen.  That wasn’t unusual for him but it was potentially problematic for life in his new home.  But as soon as he sat up in bed, the soft light from the wall sconces lit and he was able to look around his room curiously.  Everything looked the way it had when he’d fallen asleep last night.  He checked the mattress and the floor for any signs of disturbance but there was nothing.  He scrubbed an anxious hand over his face and yawned loudly.  So, it had been a dream last night.
He hadn’t realized it before, but he had been worried about the bird.  He was glad to have him back safe and in his line of sight, and if he was touching him more than necessary, well, that was just to make sure he wasn’t injured anywhere else.
“No, Bobby, I’m fine.  Just want to make sure Sam is okay if, ya know...  Something happens.”  Dean explained lamely.  He knew he had a cold resolve on his face and the steely determination in his expression was making Bobby uneasy.  But, Bobby hadn’t ever been one to push so he decided to trust that Dean knew what he was talking about.
The bird shook out his great feathered head and pinned Dean with a dark blue stare. It made Dean's skin crawl to be under the scrutiny. The creature didn't have any discernible pupils, at least as far as he could tell since it was dark as shit. Its eyes were a mix of blues that would have probably been beautiful if Dean had seen them literally anywhere other than on the large bird monster that still might eat him. Its feathers were an interesting blend of grey, black and white. It was a shame it was so dark, he would have liked to have seen it properly.
He clicked a few buttons and a movie began playing on the screen.  Dean adjusted himself back against the pillows surrounding him and tilted the screen towards Castiel.  “How’s that?”
“I’m just saying, in case you need it.  And I’ve got the number for the garage written down as well.”
“Well, my computer is in my room.  How comfortable is it for you to stand?  I don’t imagine you could like, sit on a couch or bed or something?”
Dean thought with an eye roll.  At least Bobby hadn’t managed to stab him first and ask questions later.
It was several hours later and Dean was staring out of one of the windows tucked into an outer wall.  This place had no business being this fucking massive.  He’d thought he had been going back towards the entrance to the building, not that he wanted to see the edge of the cliff again, but to help with his mental map.  Apparently, he’d missed a turn or something.  Since it was currently daytime, the sun seemed to light the halls well enough.  Though, Dean did notice sconces built into the walls that would likely illuminate once night had fallen.  Similar sconces had been in his bedroom and adjoining bathroom.  This place didn’t seem to have electricity, so what powered the lights he didn’t know.  Probably Cas’s mojo magic or whatever.
“Why don’t we start with something with a simple plot and good music?”  Dean asked once they’d reached his room.  “This movie gets a bad rap because it’s so goofy, but if you just watch it for what it is I promise it’s hilarious.
Dean eventually turned off the faucet, once the water in the tub had reached nearly to his shoulders.  He closed his eyes and did his best to relax the tense muscles in his shoulders.  Without really noticing, he managed to slip into a state of half consciousness, allowing himself to feel really calm for the first time in… probably ever.
He swallowed anxiously and took a sip of his scalding coffee.  He focused on the feeling of the drink as it burned his tongue.
Dean gave Sam’s shoulder a final squeeze before releasing his brother.  That was all there was, he was saying goodbye whether Sam realized it or not.  He turned from his brother then and headed silently up the stairs and to his room.  He wasn’t sure what else to do with himself, but he couldn’t keep looking at Sam.
Nothing but the sounds of a warm summer night drifted to him. The tension didn't leave his shoulders however. John may have been a deadbeat but he'd been putting hunting lessons into Dean's head both literally and figuratively. So, Dean knew better than to ignore his instincts.
The sensation of moving through the air wasn’t quite what Dean expected flying would be like.  Admittedly, he was terrified of heights and flying especially, so he had his eyes closed for a long time.  When he finally opened them though, out of some sort of grim curiosity, he was surprised.  He could see glimpses of the Earth below, but they looked more like framed photos on a wall rather than anything he was truly experiencing firsthand.  He knew he was held tightly against Castiel’s side, though he wasn’t sure how.  The bird didn’t have hands to hold him but the sensation of safety was there nonetheless.
They’d all spent the last few days lounging around the house, Sam would occasionally leave to go run miles around the property which completely flabbergasted Dean.  He was happy that Sam was healthy enough to do so though, but Lord why?!  The first time Sam had returned from a morning run Dean had nearly flown at him with an inhaler in hand.  It had taken a few minutes before Sam had calmed him down enough to remind him that he didn’t need it anymore.
He sat upright to put his socks on and replace his boots correctly. He scrubbed one hand down his face when he had felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle. He was on alert immediately. He stilled and listened.
She nodded to him kindly in greeting. “Dean, Mr. Singer.” She shifted the stethoscope around her neck. “You can go in and see him now.”
Dean heard the voice echo throughout his skull and he shook his head to clear it.  Dean hurried forward to open the door but there was no need.  The door flew open on it’s own and banged loudly against the entryway wall.
Of course this whole process had been a complete nightmare for his brother.  Not only did Dean, his primary caregiver, and likely best friend, completely disappear, but Sam was now living in a body that didn’t feel like his own.  Sam had been inside his thin and failing frame his entire life and to suddenly be given a body that was it’s direct antithesis… Dean couldn’t imagine the depersonalization that Sam had been trying to cope with for the last few months.  And while Dean didn’t regret doing what he did, he did feel guilty that he hadn’t been here to help with the fallout.
He would just continue to fade before Dean’s eyes before he was just… gone.  And there was nothing Dean could do about it.  This wasn’t a werewolf he could hunt, it wasn’t a shifter he could kill, the genetic disease inside of his brother couldn’t be fought by Dean.  It couldn’t even be fought by medical doctors for long.  Everytime Sam had one of these attacks, Dean always wondered if this was the one.  If the infection in his lungs was going to be the last one.  If this drive to the hospital was going to be the last one he’d make with Sam.
“Woah, woah!”  Sam said quickly and raised his hands defensively.  “I checked him out already, it's him!”
Castiel’s strange bird face frowned and seemed to consider Dean’s words for a moment.  He shuffled his wings against his back and proceeded to speak without preamble.
He watched Sam out of the corner of his eye that morning.  His brother was putting up a brave front, but Dean would tell that he was exhausted.  He’d somehow managed to live a life’s worth of pain in his 20-odd years on the Earth.  The weariness in Sam’s shoulders only hardened his resolve.  Whether he became a sex slave or not, he would do what he needed to for Sam’s sake.
Instead, he attempted to focus on the feathered body and wing of the creature surrounding him.  Castiel’s feathers were soft to the touch, and while Dean was freaked the fuck out by the look of him, he would admit that he was beautiful in a David Attenborough, “Planet Earth” kind of way.  He resisted the urge to run his fingers along the covert feathers at the top of Castiel’s large wings.  He didn’t know him like that, hell that could be a mating signal or something for the guy, and that was territory Dean was NOT getting into.
He had grown used to the dry, hot days in the desert.  He wasn’t sure what the temperature there was but it was somewhere between Satan’s Anus and a volcano.  The weather in BC though… well, that was a completely different story and he definitely should have worn a jacket.  He hadn’t been thinking much about the progression of time since he’d been at the clay mansion.  It was a sort of liminal space that existed outside of time.  But it was apparent now that some months had passed since he’d left.  It had been summer when he’d gone with Cas, but judging by the temperature change the longer they flew, it was winter now.  February maybe?
And just like that, everything returned to normal.  Dean hesitated a moment before looking around in shock.
“Well, your savings won’t last forever…”  Bobby hedged politely.  “Besides, you never were one to lounge around needlessly.  You were always moving, always gettin’ into something, even as a boy.”
“Now, you may not be the brightest man alive, but you’re definitely smarter than this.  Why haven’t you made an attempt to hunt this thing?  Surely you could figure out something and then make your way back home!”
Dean sat ramrod straight immediately. His eyes were wide and confused for all of five seconds before he realized where he was. He rubbed a hand against the back of his head where Bobby had smacked him with his ball cap.
“You may wanna wake your daddy, boy.  He’ll wanna see you off.”  Bobby called as Dean retreated from the kitchen.
Dean closed his eyes and looked upwards.  He held a hand over his mouth and felt himself frown tightly.  It took him a few moments to get himself under control so that he was able to speak without choking.  Dean stood from his chair and crossed to sit on the edge of Sam’s bed.  “I know, Sammy.  I am too.  God, I am too.”
He was lonely.  Cas was fine company if he had to admit it, but he missed hopping in Baby and driving to the local bar. Missed flirting with waiters and waitresses and getting lucky.  Missed just sitting around in silence with other people and watching television. Fuck, maybe he was REALLY lonely.  He shook his head to clear it.  The sun was almost below the horizon now and he needed to get his game face on.
Dean’s arms fell to his sides and he swallowed anxiously.  “Are you- are you serious?  Like, serious serious?”
“Well, if it isn't the Singer boys! You know, I was just thinking the other how much I missed your handsome faces.” She winked at Bobby and Dean and Sam both rolled their eyes.
The doctors had told them they were lucky...  Dean didn’t feel particularly lucky.  It was true that Sam’s life expectancy was years longer than what it could have been. But, he was 22 now and Dean had watched in dismay as year by year, Sam’s health deteriorated.  He knew that Sam wasn’t going to get to live into old age, he likely wouldn’t even get to touch on middle age.
been in an accident, he’d been in hell.  Sure before that he’d been in a car accident, a semi had hit the impala with him and the boys inside.  He didn’t think what was going on now had anything to do with that though.  The evidence of ‘no demonic interference’ was clear in front of him.  Did he take the gift that was given to him?  Tell her he didn’t remember.  They would obviously state he had amnesia.  It would be easy.
“You won’t ever be able to leave this island, Castiel.”  His insides twist slightly at this but he still feels sure of his position.
“I’m right here, John.  Been here the whole time.  I love you too.”  She leaned in and he eagerly melded his face to hers, still crying like a damn baby as their lips met.  His hands went to her hair, he could smell her and taste her again.  It was better than heaven or hell, this was real.  The woman he loved, alive again and in front of him.  When she pulled back he could see the smile on her face, he could see the lines of aging he didn’t remember since they never got to grow old together.  He loved them just the same but yearned for the years he had missed.  He got lost staring into her face, those beautiful blue eyes.  So kind and loving. “Do you remember what happened?”  She sat back on the bed, giving him some space.  Once upon a time she had known him so well, known how easily he’d gotten lost in her.  Regarding what she said though…
They were everywhere.  However this had happened, it had spiraled quickly and John had been too busy with Mary to even pay attention to the signs.  He should be mad at himself, but he knew he couldn’t have done anything differently.  They couldn’t find anyone and every place they went was more dangerous than the last.  No Harvelle’s, No Singer’s, No Campbell’s, No Winchester Seniors.  One by one his entire family had crumbled.  They checked for Cas’ family too, but they were pretty spread out and seeing as the phone lines had gone down he had no way to know about any of them.  They had each other, a most unlikely pair.  At least Cas wasn’t completely useless, what with all that fight training over the years.  After searching for anyone they knew and coming up dry, they headed back to the Winchester house.  The silence was deafening and someone how they came to the silent agreement that they would rest tonight and in the morning they’d get to work.  John found wood in the garage and the shed to nail to the front windows, Cas got to work using the dining room table to fortify the back door and windows.  When they were done John grabbed sleeping bags from the basement and they both passed out on the floor with weapons next to them.  Neither wanted to sleep on the couch that still had Dean’s blood on it.
“I want to ask Dean to marry me.  And I don’t necessarily want your approval, as I find that an antiquated ritual.  But I wanted to let you know... and if you had any suggestions, that would be greatly appreciated.”  Mary’s hand flew to her mouth and stifled a small gasp.  John froze and stiffened slightly.
“I didn’t pick her boy, it just happened.  You don’t choose who you fall in love with, you just get to choose whether or not you fight for them and stay.”
“What’s the situation with the tumour?”  Jess asked, coming up to sit on the bed next to Mary while Lucy slept quietly in her car seat, no idea of the family turmoil around her.  “I am a nurse after all, I’ll make sure you get the best.”  Mary reached out to grab her hand and squeezed it.
A cry of pain sounded from the front of the house and it turned into a scream.  John jolted into action, grabbing a shovel off the ground and he ran to the front of the house.  Cas was in the back seat of the impala, three zombies surrounded the car… and one had his leg.  Cas cried out again, trying to kick the thing off of him, John swung at the other two clawing at the classic car, smacking their skulls open with a sickening crack.  On the second one the handle splintered, so John broke it over his knee as he came and shoved the fractured handle up through the chin and into the head of the undead woman making a chew toy out of Cas’ leg.  It was over in a few moments.
for fuck’s sake.”  He paced away from John, kicking up leaves in his frustration as he got louder.  John didn’t know how to argue with him, his own world hadn’t gone to shit quite like this and it would be so easy to give into that voice telling him to give up.  He felt cowardly for even thinking it, or maybe he was more cowardly for not being able to do it.  “I’m gonna go get something from the impala, I think he’d like it.”  Cas shuffled around the corner of the house back towards the front since they’d boarded up the back door.  A deep sigh left John and he shoved his hands in his pockets,
“He only promised to stop using TINY ducks.  Man, you’re an idiot.” Dean couldn’t stop laughing, Sam’s facial expressions were priceless and he just couldn’t wait to recount this all to Cas and laugh about it all over again.  This was gonna go down in history. The bathroom door slammed signaling Sam’s departure, but Sam could still hear the final bits of Dean’s laughter in his wake.
as Cas effortlessly drops the trenchcoat from his form, then the suit jacket and sets them down neatly off to the side.
He thinks he can hear Sam yelling, and then he sees his favorite giant slicing into the thing munching on him so that’s done, then Dean is kinda staring down at him horrified.  Dean wants to tell him so many things, ask him so many things.  Plus his mom is nearby too, and at least if he has to go out he gets to do it with them here.  He knows they’re okay, and that’s more than he’s had in a year.  There’s only one other person he wants to see right now.
“He knows who I am, and who he is.  But he’s unclear about where he is, and he doesn’t remember the accident.”  The doctor hummed in thought.
“Can we listen to it?  And maybe… if you have any ice cream?”  John chuckled lightly and reached in the freezer.  The power hadn’t gone out yet, so everything in there was still good.  He remembered how him and Mary had shared a bowl just last week.  She’d only managed a few bites in the short time she’d been awake and still managed to get it on his nose.
“Okay, okay.  This is the same way Bobby and Ellen reacted, but I’ve got a plan seriously.”  Charlie held up her hands, babbling super fast as she tried to explain.  “The place is basically an entire city.  Tons of back up generators hidden on the property, plus it’s this massive cement structure so we don’t need to worry about it’s integrity long term.  Tactically we could set it up for really easy defense, and in a place that big we could easily grow our group, start really trying to live in this dystopian future.  Biggest challenge would be clearing the dead out.  But I think I have a plan for that too, but you’ve got a better mind for that than me.  I’m just a nerd with a plan and a freaky retention rate for unnecessary facts or floor plans.”  Charlie said that last part with an eyebrow wiggle that made Dean chuckle just a bit.
“Well, thanks for believing in me at least.  Now go get ungross then come find me so we can plan.”  Charlie smiled evilly, as if they were planning a prank war and not the biggest move their group would ever do.  Dean shook his head at her antics as he headed into the bathroom.  They didn’t have running water, but he could still rinse off in the tub with a bucket of water and some soap.  It was February now, almost March.  If they moved fast they could get to the Mall when the bozos were still slow.
Even Cassie was there once in a while, the only one who knew him from before.  He’d thought for a while they might have something again, she kicked ass and she was gorgeous.  Cassie was, as everyone around him reminded him, perfect for him, but what they didn’t understand was Cassie deserved better than him.  Not that he hadn’t tried, he just couldn’t seem to find it in himself to give her his whole self.  He’d loved her once, he knew he had, but these days that didn’t seem to be an option.  His heart just seemed like a proverbial ache, always there and present.  Proving yet again why he kept an emotional disconnect where he could, he didn’t know if it did any good.
“Let me hold that fucker while we eat and half a rabbit is coming your way.”  Dwight easily passed over the weapon in exchange for the food, taking that as invitation enough to sit down.  “These arrows… they reusable?”
“So you gave him the bracelet?  Bet you didn’t even say a word.”  Charlie prompted, but he could hear the smile in her voice.  Dean huffed out a laugh.
about a boy.  Both of our sons are starting families.  You should be proud of them.”  John sighed and leaned his forehead against his wife’s.  Despite the weirdness of this universe, the peace was like a balm to his soul.  Even the mild discomfort of his son dating (And soon to be engaged to) another man, was nothing compared to the life he’d led them through the first time around.  He had never believed in second chances before he came here, but he was thankful everyday.  Somedays he even wondered if in this place he’d be able to die of old age, peacefully in his bed.  It was a fool’s dream before, hunter’s never got that old.  But now…
Cas leaned into Dean and put their foreheads together, grabbing Dean’s hand on his cheek and holding it there as his breaths came in shaky gasps.  Then after a moment to regulate his breathing, Cas pulled back and looked Dean in the eyes.
“Uh, Hello.”  Said a familiar voice and Dean turned to find Jack, his awkward little wave, smiling at them.  “Glad that worked, otherwise he would have been stuck in heaven.”  Cas got to his feet and went over to stand in front of Jack.
When he had pictured his future, or his ideal relationship, or anything like that it had always been with Cas by his side.  Always within reach.  Even now in this apocalyptic wasteland, 7 months since the flood that had taken the two most important people away from him, it was hard to imagine any type of future.  He continued on, because doing anything else would be a disservice to their memory and their love for him.  Even when it felt like some days he was just existing, he’d push himself forward, reminding himself to live.  They’d talked about it, back in the early days of the apocalypse, the what ifs in case they lost each other.  Sam had told him to find someone to protect, so he’d found a group.  Cas had told him to let people in, had hammered it into him really.
“I think these two need to decompress.  Shower.  Sleep.  Whatever men do.”  She elbows Sam to take everyone else’s attention then manages to shove Dean and Cas off down the hall.  “We’ve got it handled.”  She gives them a wink.  “You two behave.”  Then she turns around and marches back down the hall before either of them can reply.  Dean glances back at her with a wry, content smile.
October was when things got harder than ever.  The boys were always around, Mary got thinner even though she was still beautiful.  She ate less, slept more, the doctors prompted him to start thinking about moving into a hospital, but he wanted her to stay at home for as long as possible.  So he set up for hospice care. When Mary’s charts dropped he had machines brought in.  A nurse came by three times daily just to check everything was going okay.
He walked casually back into the other room, hands stuffed in his pockets.  His shoulders were hunched slightly towards his ears.  “Running water?”  He asked once Castiel was in view.
Dean had a feeling that the older man didn’t believe him, but before the conversation could progress any further, Sam’s larger than life form stumbled into the kitchen.  Dean raised his eyebrows in surprise at his kid brother and watched as a series of emotions played themselves out across his face.  Fear, happiness, disbelief, anger, then happiness again.
He plated his food once he was satisfied that the chicken had cooked enough.  He may be angry, but he didn’t want to be angry and have salmonella on top of it.  He refused to look at Castiel as he stomped his way to the table and took a seat.  He bit into his food without waiting for it to cool, which burned his mouth and caused his irritation to double.  His lip curled and he took a large swallow from his water only to discover that it was now empty and he needed to refill it.
The sky overhead had darkened considerably and Dean frowned as he watched a bank of clouds roll across the sun.
“You’re a jerk, Dean.”  Sam muttered against the fabric of his shirt.  His voice sounded small and weak, almost like it had before Dean had left when Sam had been in the hospital.
“You won’t do anything.”  Dean finally said in exhaustion.  “If you do, Cas will likely reverse whatever magic he’d used to heal Sam.  We’re going to enjoy my next 3 weeks with each other and then you’re going to say goodbye to me.  There will be no more discussions about it and there will be no more fights about it.  Understood?”  Dean said with a sharpness to his voice that he hadn’t ever used with either of them before.
Dean thought frantically.  Sam’s coughs had picked up in volume and frequency.  That was what he’d been trying to figure out.  Normally, his breathing treatments made him cough for a while in the evenings but this sound was different.  This was strained and there was a note of pain under each of the gasping breaths he could hear coming from Sam’s room.
Dean cooked himself something simple and savory, not really caring what it was.  Eating dinner without Sam still stung like a dull knife, but he was getting better at coping with it.  He was about halfway through eating when he heard the click of Cas’s talons on the floor outside.  He met the birds eyes levelly, and continued chewing the large bite of food in his mouth.  The two regarded one another for a moment.
Dean made an “Ah!” face. He had been wondering how long it would take for them to get around to the reciprocity section. Nothing was ever free, especially miracle cures. “Which is?” Dean prompted.
Normally, she would laugh politely at his joke before escorting them to Sam's room. This time however, she simply gave him a tight smile before gesturing behind her down the hall.
Dean needed to step forward, needed to say goodnight, needed to say goodbye, needed to tell Sam that he loved him and that everything was going to be okay.  The words were there, there were on his tongue, but he couldn’t seem to force them past his lips.  He managed to take a shaky step towards his brother and reach out a trembling hand to rest on his shoulder.  He couldn’t leave it there long, he knew Sam could feel the tremors in his hand.
Sam just shook his head in reply, unable to answer around the hacking cough spewing from his chest.  Sam pulled his hand back from his mouth and Dean frowned when he realized that Sam had a handful of mucus and blood.
Dean swallowed and pulled a crumpled piece of paper out of his back pocket.  On it was a list of all of the house utilities, mortgage payment, and miscellaneous bills, when they were due, how to pay them and how much they were.  He’d also listed the bank account information that all the money came from for them.  He hoped it wouldn’t be necessary, but he’d included a list of all of Sam’s medications, his doctors, and anything else about his condition that might be important.  If Castiel held up his end of the deal, Bobby wouldn’t need this but… it really didn’t hurt to have all of this information in one place and another person in on what needed to be done.  He honestly should have done this years ago.
Based on the few items that were scattered around the debris on the floor, Dean was guessing that this place used to be a church or something.  And now that he could see her crazy ass, he could tell she was wearing a habit so she had apparently been a nun or something.  Whatever she was, she was NOT happy that he was here.
“How about you?  How was work?”  Sam asked politely.  He’d settled himself in a beat-up stool at the kitchen island and was leaning on his elbows.
“Dean…”  Sam’s voice was choked with sadness and Dean searched his brother’s face as tears fell from both their eyes.  “I’m scared.”
He had found and salted her bones as soon as it had gotten dark but apparently those weren’t the only things keeping her here.  He should have been scouting the area out more during the day instead of watching the townspeople like a fucking creep.
Dean hadn’t known what he was expecting.  Surely, something… MORE than what lay before him.  The place was spacious, sure.  The ceilings were high and the hallways were wide, likely to allow for Cas’s large form to move more comfortably around the space.  There were rooms along the hallways, Dean peeked into a couple and they were equally as spacious as the hallways.  He followed Castiel down a series of halls that connected to one another with grandiose arches.  Dean was impressed by the sheer size of the building around him.
He hurried back inside and tossed on the boots he’d toed off in the entryway when he’d gotten home that evening.  Luckily, he still had his sweats on so he had pockets for all the items he needed to snag.  He grabbed the pill bottles sitting on the kitchen counter and stuffed them into the pockets of his pants.  He grabbed a pair of socks sitting on top of the hamper near their washer and dryer, he doubted that they matched but that didn’t matter right now. Those went into his pockets with the pills.
Dean grinned wide enough that it hurt his cheeks and he practically threw himself at Cas.  The bird was surprised by the sudden attack and uttered an uncomfortable ‘oof!’ as Dean’s arms tightened around his neck.  Tears were still running happily down Dean’s cheeks and he buried his head into the soft feathers of Cas’s neck.
“Cheers.”  Dean said gruffly as he took a larger than necessary sip of the scalding liquid.  He immediately hissed painfully through his teeth and inhaled a few sharp breaths to try and soothe his burnt tongue.
Sam had the decency to look guilty and Dean eyed him in irritation.  “I’m sick of having this conversation with you, Sammy.”  Dean said quietly.
Dean pursed his lips thoughtfully at the assorted items before them.  He had cooked his entire life for Sammy, they’d had dinner and talk about their days, they were good memories for him.  Though the meals he made usually were a lot simpler to make.  Most of them just popped in the oven for a few minutes.  The thought of Sam sitting down to dinner right now, with no idea where Dean was caused a pang of regret deep in his chest.  He frowned at himself and clenched one of his hands into a tight fist.  Having dinner with Sam was only going to be memories now, he wouldn’t be making new ones…
“It’s been 6 months, you little shit!  We’ve been worried sick!  I’ve got the Hunter network from here to Juarez looking for you.  Hell, John has been driving across the country like a maniac looking for clues on where you ended up.  And then you have the nerve to just pop in like ain’t nothin’ happened?!”
Dean raised his eyebrows in question at Sam and then Bobby.  The two men looked a little uncomfortable before Bobby gave him a tight smile.  “How’d ya sleep, boy?”
He chewed anxiously at his lip.  The sun was setting and he was hungry.  His headache from earlier had bloomed into a full blown migraine and Dean realized now it was because he hadn’t had any water the entire day.  He was dehydrated and it was causing him a good deal of pain.  Castiel hadn’t told him the repercussions of being out of his room at night, if there were any, but Dean didn’t feel like risking it on his first night here.
Dean met Cas’s eyes and the two regarded one another silently for a time.  Dean gave him a crooked smile and blushed slightly.  He felt silly all of a sudden and ducked his head while he gathered his plate and took it to the sink.  He could feel Cas’s gaze on him while he walked, but instead of irritating him it made him feel glad.  Maybe they were finally coming to some sort of understanding in their relationship.
“Not now, bud.”  Dean said simply in an attempt to end the tirade before it began.  John would swan in when he felt like it and not a minute before.  No sense worrying about it over breakfast.
The creatures brow furrowed at his new stance and Dean prepared himself for an attack. The bird only tilted its head to the side though and Dean tightened his hold on the knife. “Would you just fucking attack me already!?”
“Why would you do that?” Dean asked to try and buy himself some more time. He had eased a hand into the trunk and was rooting around for a gun. He knew he had a couple in here.
“Now, local teachings are different from those in the rest of the Americas, but most have a similar theme.  It’s even made its way into pop culture as a type of cryptid, like Bigfoot and Loch Ness!”  Sam continued.  Native culture had always been an interest of his and Dean wasn’t surprised that he knew all of this off-hand.
Dean woke some hours later, feeling groggy.  He could function on a crazy sleep schedule, but he didn’t like it.  It threw his
He clicked in response to another of Dean’s exclamations.  Regardless, he was on his way to being free and clear of the mortal trapping.  Just a few more months.
He pulled out his homemade EMF detector and twisted some of the dials on it. He walked the perimeter of the ruined shack and watched as the hand swung back and forth over the readings. This place was hot alright.
He brushed his teeth quickly and peed in the bizarre toilet.  It did flush though, so that was nice.  He wasn’t living in luxury but he definitely wasn’t roughing it here either.  He yawned widely and debated his options.  He was staring into his open duffel with a frown.  Did he change into sweats?  Or go to bed in his clothes?
“Cas?”  Sam asked eagerly.  “It’s name is Cas?”  Sam was already scribbling the name down on a spare sheet of paper.
Dean simply grunted in reply and walked around his brother to use the toilet.  It was too early this morning for melodrama.  Besides, they were likely in for more screaming matches today so might as well save their energy.  John was nothing if not tenacious after all.
He finally tossed his dishes in the sink and stomped out of the room.  Whatever.  He’d just walk some laps around the mansion and maybe do some pushups later.  He didn’t have Baby to work on any longer when he was in a bad mood and it filled him with restless energy.  He didn’t know if he was going to be able to do this indefinitely.  He’d been prepared for torture, not this endless procession of time.
Despite his joy, he was a little disturbed to realize that he missed Cas’s presence.  That seemed to be the only thing missing from this happy little reunion.  He could just picture Cas’s somber face sitting across the breakfast table from him while he ate his marshmallow cereal.  He grinned to himself, now that would be a sight to see.  A giant bird sitting in his childhood home and enjoying a casual breakfast with his brother and surrogate father.  Regardless of how silly the thought was, it kept a small smile on his face while he finished his coffee.
Cas let out an indignant squawk at the pressure around his chest and one of his wings.  Dean pulled back just far enough to grin up at him with his most boyish smile.  Cas tilted his head softly and regarded Dean with one of his bizarre blue eyes.  The two looked at each other thoughtfully for a moment, mere inches from the other, before Dean seemed to realize where he was.  He took two large steps backwards so he could put a respectable distance between them.
“Hey Bobby!  Got a minute?”  Dean asked casually.  Sam had excused himself to go do a breathing treatment and now was Dean’s opportunity to talk to Bobby without fighting with Sam.
Bobby was red in the face.  He was furious but Dean had known him long enough to know that he was trying to cover up the fact that he was terrified.  Dean’s sudden disappearance had been harder on the old man than he’d anticipated.  The shimmer of tears at his surrogate father’s eyes finally did him in.  Dean stepped forward while Bobby was mid-rant and wrapped his arms snuggly around the old man’s shoulders.
The bird took a shuffling step backward to allow him room to pass onto the porch.  It lifted a large wing and gestured for Dean to step against him and under the wing.  Dean took a small step towards him before he halted stubbornly.  “Not yet.”  He said quickly.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief as they managed to get all the way down without injury.  They walked slowly out of the house and Dean managed to lock the door behind them with one hand.  He helped Sam to the passenger side of the Impala and all but leapt over the hood to reach his door.  Sam rolled his eyes at Dean dramatically before he started coughing again.
Dean reached under the bed and snagged a bottle of shampoo from his duffle.  He stood in front of the tub in his socked feet and frowned at it in irritation.  There wasn’t anything for it, he needed to get clean and he could keep putting it off, the situation wasn’t likely to change.  May as well just suck it up and deal with it.
Dean shifted uncomfortably in his seat.  “I am.  Really.  I know it’s odd, but Cas is nice, I would even call him a sort of friend… I mean, I’m bored out of my mind most of the time, but I’m okay.  I’m safe.”  Before speaking with John, Dean could have said all of this with confidence, there was a seed of doubt in his mind now though.  But, Sam didn’t need to know that.
The feeling of being watched left him. Dean felt a shiver chase down his arms and he shook them out in irritation. Jesus, was he THAT out of practice? Had nothing really been there? He narrowed his eyes over the hood of his car towards a long line of trees adjacent to the hospital. Nothing moved within their branches and he sucked on his teeth thoughtfully. He needed to get back to Sam. He didn't have time for fucking make believe monsters his sleep deprived brain was trying to conjure.
Dean tipped his fork at the bird in a half salute.  Cas shuffled towards the table, doing his best not to bump into anything as he traversed the space.  He settled himself across from Dean and shuffled his wings into a more comfortable position on his back.  He watched silently as Dean continued eating.  This was a situation they’d been in many times, so Dean completely ignored his companion.
Sam shoved a hand through his hair to rake it away from his face.  He was twenty-two and broader than Dean had ever been, but he was thinner than he had any right to be.  That was a side effect though, even with the occasional feeding tube he wasn’t absorbing his nutrients like he should.
She turned an eye to both Bobby and Dean at that last part.  They all knew what Sam’s prognosis was, and no matter what doctor they had talked to, Sam never came out on top.  He was dying, it was just slow.  And from the sounds of it, Sam had been lying to them for the last couple of weeks about his health.  Dean had been so busy… he should have been paying more attention.  Shit.
There was silence in his head and Dean frowned.  Was this like a radio that Cas could turn on and off?  How the fuck did this work?
“I remember better than you do!”  Dean knew that he was raising his voice, but his emotions were all over the place right now.  “Of course I remember!  I spent our whole lives listening to him and learning all of his lessons because you couldn’t be bothered!  One of us had to be responsible.”
Dean just stood staring at Castiel. He'd never seen eyes so blue. Castiel returned the gaze with one eyebrow arched. Dean must have lost time for a moment because Sam cleared his throat.
Dean's brows furrowed, "Why did all of you go through all this trouble? You didn't know if I'd ever come back. It's been a decade, and I was just a kid. I'm surprised anyone remembers me."
Castiel frowned, "I did that once! Jimmy called me mid sandwich making. Are you ever going to forgive me?"
“If we go further, I’m in it for the long haul, Cas. I don’t want to start something that I can’t finish. That’s why I stopped us last night.”
Castiel started working side-by-side on the fence with him. Dean could swear Castiel kept sneaking peeks at him as they were working.
Dean pulled Castiel him. He started kissing him tentatively but grew in intensity as they became more comfortable. Dean murmured, "Cas…"
Castiel shrugged, "You live, and you learn. In this case, I learned a hard financial lesson, as well as grew trust issues."
After Castiel tilted his head at him, Dean said, "John Lennon. The song Imagine. I'm going to have to make you listen to more music than just Led Zeppelin."
“Kelly loved this place. Not for his company, of course, but the food is delicious. Kelly sometimes wanted something different than the hometown cuisine available at Harvelle’s, the diner, or the pizza joint. You only have three options in Falcon Bay. I honestly had hoped Crowley had forgotten me.”
Jessica opened her purse and took out a business card, “Rufus Turner is the executor of your grandfather’s trust. He manages the bank here. He’ll be able to go through the trust with you. If you need any more legal documents drawn, I’m happy to help you. Henry paid my grandfather a lump sum for handling things, so there won’t be any charges.”
Dean followed him into the dining room. Two pizzas were cooling in the center of the table. Jack and Claire smiled from where they were seated when he entered.
When they pulled into Crowley’s parking lot, Dean looked at Castiel dubiously. While most of the buildings in the town had a simple, homey feel to them, Crowley’s was ostentatious. It had columns in front of the door and a fountain bubbled on a marble terrace leading to the front door. “Not for nothing, Cas, but this place kind of looks like a bordello.”
He felt a tinge of jealousy. He scoffed at himself because he barely knew the man. They were playmates as kids and he was smoking hot, but he was also straight with two kids to show for it. Roberta started whining, looking in Castiel's direction. Dean let her lead him back slowly.
Amara extended her hand towards him. A thin wisp of energy emanated from her hand and infused Jack in a soft glow. A moment later, a bright flash of light temporarily blinded them as Amara consumed Jack's grace. Amara smiled, "There, now you are a real boy."
"Charlie? As in the ‘person who helped me set up my electricity’ Charlie?" Dean smiled at her warmly.
Dean said more emphatically, "I've been conned," as he wondered to himself just how Castiel would look in a fireman's uniform.
Castiel found Dean sitting relaxed against the tree on a hill to the bunker, looking up at the stars. Dean said, "Hi, Cas," without looking up. He knew who it was by the swishing of the trench coat and the sound of his footsteps, plus he could always feel grace emanating from Castiel whenever he came close. He never asked Sam if he felt it. Sam would overthink it and try to figure out what caused it. Dean preferred to think of it as his angel detection radar, but it only ever worked with Castiel.
Taking care of the Impala over the years had made him more than a passable mechanic.  Gordon had asked him why he didn't just take the car to shop, but Dean enjoyed working on it and getting his hands dirty. He lost himself working happily on the truck.
"About time you came back, you damn idgit." Bobby's smile belied his words. "Welcome home, boy." Bobby had aged a lot since Dean had last seen him. His hair and perpetual beard had greyed, but his eyes sparkled with mirth as he grinned at Dean.
Castiel pressed his forehead against Dean and growled in a low voice, "Only sometimes are you loveable. Other times you are annoying, and I want to throttle you. But I do love you. You're my family."
Dean listened as Castiel's breathing deepened and he began to snore softly. He smiled to himself. He rubbed the Impala's dash fondly. "Thanks, girl. You're always looking out for me."
"Well, I would say selling my soul for Sam was my best decision, but it probably wasn't. But you, you taught me to have faith and that I deserved to be saved."
Jack suddenly doubled over in pain. Sam tried to punch Chuck in the face but was sent flying backward against the Impala.
“Never. He flirts with everyone, but he takes a particular delight in tormenting me. Mostly because I blushed. Kelly thought it was funny, but I never enjoyed it.”
Things with Castiel were different. He would be all in. It wasn’t just a relationship between the two of them; it was the whole package. The kids, the town, the cows, Roberta, even the goose.
Dean growled at him, "What? Why didn't you tell me about them, Sam? Who were they? I'll go break their kneecaps."
Dean laughed mirthlessly, “I guess my leaving did something to my dad. He’s now okaying the project that I had been promoting before I left. I think he’s bribing me to return.”
"Don't worry about me, Dean. You deserve to live your own life and stop having to clean up Dad's messes. You just do you. I'll cope."
Castiel huffed a small laugh, "I was a total dick. You weren't wrong. I just can't understand how I could be duped by the archangels. God didn't want you to do jack. The archangels just wanted to jump-start the apocalypse to get our Father's attention. I had doubts then. I should have listened to them."
He said, quietly, “I better take you home, Cas. You wake up early in the morning.” Neither of them talked on the drive home.
"I was about to dance with Dad so he wouldn't be the perpetual wallflower. But now that you are here, you can help save him from becoming one with the wall." Claire looked at Dean hopefully, "Dad can line dance like no one's business. He's got two left feet when it comes to slower dancing. Good thing you have cowboy boots on."
Dean glanced at him, "For what?" He pulled two more bottles of beer from the cooler, opened them, and handed one to Castiel.
"A long vacation. You, me, and Sam on a beach with toes in the sand. We'll wear matching Hawaiian shirts and drink those little fruity drinks with umbrellas in them."
“Well, it won’t help to wish now. I don’t have time for all this Hallmark crap. I had Sarah draw up the paperwork to transfer the trust to you. You just have to sign it on the way out.”
Ellen poked him in the ribs, "You behave. You get free beer. I'm sure you want to keep it that way."
"He runs the Novak farm now. I helped him load his goods to take them to a farmer's market today. It was awesome. He sells cheese, honey, eggs, and…" A laugh interrupted him. He asked grumpily, "What's so funny, Sam?"
Castiel smirked, "Well I said it, so it must be true." Castiel opened the passenger's door and told Dean, "Your chariot awaits, but we must load the other passenger first." Castiel slid the seat forward and whistled, "Come on, Roberta." The elderly bloodhound stood up and shook herself off slowly. She leisurely walked towards them. When she got near the door, she looked at Castiel expectantly. He sighed, bent over, picked up the dog, and put her in the cab in the cargo area. "She's dreadfully spoiled."
Dean stopped in his tracks. Castiel was dressed is a poet-style shirt, leather pants, and high boots. His hair was in complete disarray, but that made it very appealing. He bit his lip; he was gorgeous. His cheekbones, the chiseled chin, the five-o'clock shadow even though it wasn't noon yet; all of it gorgeous.
After Castiel headed back to the gazebo, Claire stood there with her arms crossed looking squarely at Dean. "Ok, Dean. I approve of you dating my father but there are some ground rules."
Castiel dropped the peach, grabbed Dean's arms, and tried to pull him close. Dean protested at first, "My clothes. You'll get dirty."
Sam snorted, "Only in small doses, bro." Sam turned to head to the Ferris wheel. "That's Cas, handling the ticket taking."
"Well, he hasn't missed a day at the farmer's market in over ten years, so I don't know why he'd stop now."
When they entered the restaurant, a woman wearing an elegant black dress with her raven hair pulled up in a tight ponytail seated them in a corner booth in the back.
The drive to Oregon was uneventful. After Dean turned from the two-lane highway onto the dirt road leading to the farm, he slowed the car to a crawl as he traversed the rut-ridden road. Cursing under his breath, he wished he had thought this through and rented an SUV instead of driving his classic '67 Impala down this atrocity of a farm road. He would need to get the road graded and fresh gravel spread before he drove down it too often.
Dean rolled off of Castiel, while Castiel swiveled to sit up. Dean said, "It just doesn't seem right that a former angel of the lord is going to need a hip replacement soon."
Castiel smiled at him sadly, "I've taken care of her since she was four months old. She's Jimmy's daughter. He and his wife, Amelia, were killed in an auto accident. A drunk driver smashed into them on their first date night after Claire's birth. Worst day of my life when Jody called to tell me about Jimmy. I got on the next plane down and never left. It takes a village to raise a child, and this village helped me find my way. I adopted Claire legally. She knows Jimmy's her biological father, but I'm all she knows. Mom had planned to move to Florida before Jimmy died. He had taken over the farm, and she was ready for new adventures. After I found my footing, I encouraged her to go."
"Everyone is so busy that they don't take the time to just enjoy the moment. Everyone's on their way to someplace else and it's hard to talk and connect."
“So, you are what? Thirty-five now? So, let’s say at age twenty, you didn’t think to call up and say, ‘Where’s my grandpa buried?’”
Castiel worried his bottom lip before saying quietly, "Yes. Always. Since the first time I saw your soul."
“You wound a man to the quick. I’ll bring you a great bottle of wine on the house for old time’s sake, Cassie.”
"Yeah. We went every summer there with Mom. You probably don’t remember it very well. You were pretty young when…" Dean trailed off. The visits to see Henry Winchester stopped after their mother died in a fire. John had neither the time nor the inclination to take his sons to see his estranged father. Many of Dean's happiest memories as a kid were those summers, free of his father's expectations and free to be himself. "Can I see it?"
"The customers know the price. Just ask them. I swear ten minutes max. And no stress if you get a price wrong. It will all work out. I can catch them next time."
The door opened behind him, and a teenage girl and a younger boy emerged from the house. The girl was dressed in a black leather jacket, jeans, and Converse sneakers, while the boy wore shorts and a purple hoodie. Both had blond hair and blue eyes. The girl appraised him knowingly, "You’re Mr. Winchester?" She blew a bubble with her chewing gum.
Jack and Claire were playing a video game in the living room when they arrived. Dean sat down to watch them as Castiel left to take a shower. By the time he emerged from the shower, Claire and Jack had co-opted Dean into playing with them. Dean was immersed in the game with the kids and didn't notice Castiel's arrival.
“It’s ok. I like it. I sometimes think I should try something else. I think that’s why I’m here. I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up. I’m kind of old to be deciding that now I suppose.”
Castiel disagreed, “I don’t see it that way. Every day is a blessing. It’s a gift. Maybe that seems trite to you.”
“Bowser came to visit me this morning. I lured him home but he’s back over there now. I don’t mind him visiting but I don’t have fences to keep in animals like you do.  So, I was afraid he might wander into traffic or something.”
Chuck laughed, "Exactly what is that supposed to do to me." He hurled Dean into a tree and turned his attention back to Castiel.
Dean surveyed the crowd until his eyes fell on Castiel standing near the opposite wall, talking to Claire. Jack was playing a video game on his phone while sitting on a stool behind Ellen who was manning the food buffet. He headed in Castiel's direction.
“We have to keep going, son.  Or they’ll come back just to kick our asses.”  Cas laughed through a sniffle as tears dropped down his face, John couldn’t do it anymore, he couldn’t give in that far.
To say little of it, it was loud.  But once the hole was made they were able to block off the chunk of the left wing not blocked by benches.  Didn’t change the fact that the loud truck echoing in the mall, plus the chorus of growling noises seemed a cacophony determined to draw even more.
“Because you’re the best fighter, and the smartest one about tactical advantage.”  Charlie said with an eye roll like it was totally obvious.  “Both Bobby and Ellen trust you with their lives.  Hell Dean, this entire camp does.  Your opinion means something.”  Dean wanted to scoff at that but he couldn’t, as much as he liked being trusted he couldn’t help the part of him that said everyone was making a giant mistake about that.  He hadn’t been able to keep his brother or best friend safe, and who was this group by comparison?
