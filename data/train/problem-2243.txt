“You will not sleep the day away when we’ll barely get to see you for it!”
Sherlock spends enough time in his Mind Palace with this John to recognize him straight away, but he’s uncertain why he’s here.
Watson leans forward, placing his elbows on his knees and his hands over his mouth, “Oh my God,” he whispers in horror.
“To watch,” Sherlock said without hesitation, “I want to watch.”
“Where’d you go?” Holmes asks gently.
Sherlock must agree that it’s eerily apt to their lives, but…
looks at him - and notices the trance-like state Sherlock is in. His worry grows, “What are you doing here?”
“Not a problem,” Greg smiled lustily before lying back on his sofa after locking his door, “so…what are you wearing?”
Watson winces beyond his control, “It has to be in there, doesn’t it? If this was?”
“I had them in my possession for awhile,” he lies instead.
, you arse!” John yells as he stands from his chair to confront his friend, “So you what? Decided you didn’t want to do the mission and off yourself instead?”
“There
“I never said you had to stop.”
This…
“Holmes!” Watson scolds.
“Well, at least you learned not to keep leaving me outside of situations like this. There’s that bright side.”
“No you didn’t.”
Sherlock is speechless at the admission, how tender it sounds coming from his sleepy mouth. The other answers were all honest, so it’s reasonable to assume that this is, too. Simply because it’s hard to believe doesn’t make it all that less likely, does it?
“How?” John asked while raising an eyebrow as he moved to help Sherlock up off the floor, noticing that Sherlock seemed to be wincing in pain.
“From what I’ve gathered, it is just a small piece of evidence in a case against the Moriarty of their time, a section of the case dealing with his stalking of their Sherlock Holmes.”
“That one,” Sherlock insists with a snooty roll of his eyes, “if we must. I can at least find some embarrassing anecdotes for the next time you drag me out for one of your football and perving events with Lestrade.”
John nodded his head while biting his bottom lip, even though an answer wasn’t exactly required considering that his cock was rushing to fulfill the request. He was fully hard in seconds, and a bit light headed for it.
The morning of this case Holmes and I were sitting at our table, drinking tea and reading, while our feet discreetly played against each other out of view. It was a risk we dared not take most of the time, but my companion was feeling a bit sentimental that morning, and I have never been known to refuse him much of anything.
“We can talk about this,” John said.
“With a romantic, intimate intent,” he amends with a roll of his eyes.
After watching Sherlock and John’s intense non-verbal communication, Holmes speaks up again.
dead.”
“The pool,” Watson whispers himself, covering his face with his hands.
“There’s no guarantee that it will work the other way,” Mycroft insists, growing tired of the argument.
John shook his head playfully, hyper focussed on Sherlock’s arse as he spread the cheeks wide and used his dry thumb to stroke around the opening softly, keeping it gentle in order to sensitize Sherlock to the feeling. Sherlock jumped, whining low in his throat as a mottled blush began at his cheeks and worked its way down to his chest. His legs kicked out and he inhaled deeply, attempting to calm himself as John prodded and circled the area, never pushing in, but just getting Sherlock used to his touch.
He places it down gently and reaches for the coin in front of John to compare. This one, never having been in a protective case but clearly placed in pockets amongst other valuables, is shoddier looking. The background is black on both sides, one with the symbol for Her Majesty’s Royal Armed Forces, the other with a symbol for the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.
“Want to talk about it?” John asks gently, not placing any pressure on him to do so.
“Presumably Moriarty was behind all of these cases prior to his demise; he wouldn’t have any reason to record anything that he wasn’t directly behind.”
Sherlock shakes his head, “I don’t know, it seems impossible.”
On screen, Sherlock and John dissolve in to giggles. They discuss why they’re in their current location and make a joke about Mycroft being the queen that sends Holmes and Watson laughing, as well. Sherlock, true to his petulant form, stoutly refuses to put any clothes on until Mycroft has nearly left him standing naked, holding on to a semblance of control by demanding to know who his client is.
“Hmm? What? No. No not a case just...research,” Sherlock said, “regarding masturbation.”
He pauses and John’s arms tighten around him as he fights tears. He knows very little about Sherlock’s childhood prior to Hogwarts, but he remembers that scrawny little boy always at the same table of the library, studying books that were almost bigger than he was.
“Oh. Of course. How disgusting,” Sherlock grimaces, “During an intimate encounter, then.”
“So?” John asks while beaming proudly before pulling a deeply-sighing Sherlock Holmes feigning resistance towards the middle of the dancing crowd.
Sherlock nods in understanding, “I think it will be nice, though, to hear a bit more about what it was like for you, before you came back to London.”
“John?” Sherlock asks, confused by the length of complete stillness.
John is looking down at the case with the same confusion as Sherlock before they lock eyes, “Where did you find this?” Sherlock asks.
“Penis,” Sherlock completed the statement, a playful smile obvious in his tone.
“Yes,” he answers.
They are lost within each other when the music slows. John looks uncertain now that a distinctly romantic song is their soundtrack, not wanting to push Sherlock in to anything but also not wanting to lose this closeness. Sherlock quells John’s fears by offering his right hand in invitation with a confident smile, but his eyes show his trepidation. John alleviates Sherlock’s fears by willingly grabbing his hand with a genuine smile.
Zach laughs at that, “Well...he’s
“Why is that so incredibly difficult for your pea-sized brain to comprehend? You’re supposed to be a doctor!”
Sherlock watches John fall deeper in to sleep, cataloging how long it takes (an impressive four minutes and 12 seconds) and how he situates himself. John has fallen asleep on his back, head facing away from Sherlock, and his mouth slightly open. He doesn’t snore – like John has told him that
Holmes breathes in deep through his nose, the reminder that his going after Watson was no coincidence. Watson is the heart to his brain, a matched set from the very beginning.
“Did you need us for something?” Watson asks, similarly to what he asked Anderson upon his visit earlier.
“This one is new, you know,” Sherlock points out casually, using his right forefinger this time to point out a dark freckle on the back of his left hand, almost perfectly centered between forefinger and thumb.
Sherlock chuckled deeply, seemingly tickled by John’s question, “Yes, John. I have a foreskin.”
“Yes,” he says aloud anyway.
“He says it’s for a case,” Holmes defends.
As of late, I have frequently found myself looking back on our acquaintance with this new feeling of pain and wrongness in my gut. I cannot help but come to the unfortunate conclusion that I may have not fully understood what I had until I no longer did. Until I lost you to her.
Sherlock lightly traces his lips over John’s right cheek, up to his brow where he simply takes in his scent, before mirroring the tracing on the left cheek. John can’t breathe, can’t
The pair enters the flat, removing coats and placing them on the rack as normal. As though nothing is at all different. They silently ascend the 17 steps to the flat where John sits in his chair while Sherlock begins to pace while thinking.
“Never have I ever,” John whispers, eyes on his own fingers as they play with Sherlock’s shirt buttons, “undressed another man.”
Sherlock glances quickly over at the woman to see a look of shocked resignation on her face. She knows what’s coming, just as all of John’s former girlfriends knew it would happen at some point. He’d feel sorry for the honesty roulette having landed on her turn, but it can’t be helped; this must end
More flashes of newspaper articles detailing Moriarty’s release and speculation of how it even happened. Then a flash forward to two months later. John is at the ATM, having difficulties with his card, when an unmarked black car pulls up behind him and he gets in.
- thinks that he is attractive.
Sherlock’s cheeks suddenly bloom with a blotch of colour before he gives a half shrug, “When am I to have ever attempted it? I’ve never actually
“Most men would use their highest ranking coin to their advantage, to always get more drinks. But not you.”
“I'm sure I won't,” Sherlock huffed, taking his tea and strolling into his bedroom, slamming the door behind him.
,” he stresses, then opens his mouth to do so, but finds that he actually can’t explain it because everything he thinks to say sounds ridiculous. Holmes smirks triumphantly.
“I know,” Watson assures with a small smile, “but do you see what you should have done now, in hindsight?”
Sherlock smiled demurely, turning his head away in embarrassment. The uncharacteristic shyness lasted just a brief moment before his confidence returned and he pulled John over him for another deep, passionate kiss.
He never would, obviously, but the sentiment carried through regardless.
Both men shudder at the memory of the discovery of the DVDs. Moriarty - as obsessed with Sherlock Holmes as he has been since childhood - had apparently been filming them since their very first meeting. How he even got some of the footage is unthinkable. Then, not only did he film them, but he created a bloody soundtrack and theme song, turned it in to some kind of creepy TV show.
“If he’s anything like me, he’s trusted Sherlock since the moment they met.”
“Are you taking your coat?”
“You’re amazing,” John praised with a content, sleepy smile.
like this before.
“Yes, and it’s a habit that you really must cease. We’re quite lucky no one has taken advantage of this fact to take you hostage yet.”
Watson smiles, albeit a touch sadly, and places his right hand over Holmes’, “You’ve already apologized. It’s in the past,” he reassures him.
It’s Holmes’ stomach that drops this time. Sherlock couldn’t even stand to look at the piece of furniture that John had claimed as his. He’s been so desolate, he’s been in denial, he’s…heartbroken.
John schools his face into a non-threatening, open, accepting curiosity, “Sherlock,” he starts gently, “what
Once the food is cleared and the speech given, the tables are pushed to the side and the dancing begins. Sherlock and John stand along the side merely observing the crowd as they sip their champagne. Once their glasses empty, Sherlock offers to grab them new ones and makes his way to the bar along another of the walls.
John shook his head, smile unfailing as his eyes grew somehow more tender than before. He moved up the bed to lay beside him and pulled him into his arms before reassuring him, “And just when have you ever been
John is silent as he gathers his courage to vocalize a question he’s not entirely certain he wants an answer to, “What the hell do you
Holmes performs a suffering sigh, “Oh alright, fine! No, I had fully intended to go quietly until you showed up,” he admits.
“How? How could he consider for one
“Do they mean
Holmes smirks in return.
“Oh my God, what is he doing?” Watson asks in horror, unable to believe what the evidence is showing him.
“Mmm,” Watson hums, feigning indifference to the statement as he makes a show of turning back to the telly, but is already contemplating shaving once this little marathon is over with. Honestly, the things we do for love.
John was nervous, laying his feelings out like this to someone as inexperienced with a broad range of human emotions as Sherlock, but he knows people well and knows Sherlock even better than most. If the detective was completely uninterested, he would let him down gently again, just like that first night at Angelo’s.
, while at the same time the writer in me wanted to believe in its literary value. I was a man at war with himself, and uneasy for it.
taking hold.
John gulped loudly but nodded with a tentative smile, “Right. Not sure I’ll be able to...perform on command, but I’ll try. What about for yourself?”
Sherlock gracefully stands from the floor when he hears the door close, folding the ring in to his right fist as he takes her seat. With a confused rumble, the restaurant resumes its noises, trying to cover the awkwardness of an unanswered marriage proposal.
Molly arrives at the flat per Sherlock’s request to help him out with cases as John continues to see more patients. Both appear a bit bored by their routines. In fact, John is longing for something interesting so intensely that he actually accuses a patient of being Sherlock in disguise, trying to pull his beard off, but it’s real.
“I think you’re mixing up Agrecius and egregious.”
The knife digs in a bit deeper and John can’t help the pained grunt that is pulled from him. He doesn’t really believe that Larry will kill him, but he sure is making things uncomfortable.
“From him? There was no question.”
“I didn’t...I didn’t recognise the signs! In my defence I have only had one orgasm in my entire life; it’s not easily recognisable to me! That pleasure before may have been a fluke,” Sherlock insisted, using his fingers to wipe away the strands before wiping the mess on the bedding, “I wasn’t aware that it would happen that quickly.”
“You’re not...
John calms himself down to appease his friend, “Then let’s watch them and find out,” he insists calmly.
At the bar, Sherlock and Zach stand side-by-side waiting on the drinks. The pub has gotten busier since their arrival, but not overly so.
John kept his hands moving up and down Sherlock’s shaft, keeping hold of the base to ensure he wasn’t pushed too far down, but also to keep up a regular rhythm. Sherlock’s cock was twitching and throbbing with need and John hummed happily as he popped it back into his mouth and sucked around the tip.
“But what next?” John finishes for him knowingly, “But was it a mistake? But will it happen again? But do we regret it?”
humorous.”
we?” Holmes asks, returning to his patronizing tone.
Sherlock stops his pacing to face him, ten feet separating them, “Enlightening,” is all he says.
Sherlock’s right hand goes to the back of John’s neck to pull him down until their foreheads are pressed together as they share the same air, his left grasping firmly around John’s bicep. They continue this way, thrusting sensuously against each other with no real sense of urgency, until John determines that they’ll need a bit more stimulation to climax. He drops his right hand between them, so that his left can still support his weight, and grabs Sherlock’s cock through the silky fabric.
Back to 221B where Mary places the flash drive down next to John for the first time. Mary reveals that A.G.R.A are her initials and John’s face contorts in to a look that is so done. She says her whole history is on the stick and asks John not to read it in front of her, because he won’t love her when he’s finished. He places it in his pocket with a huff.
“He doesn’t
Sure, it wasn’t a flat-out declaration, but a declaration all the same. Personally I’m just proud of myself for not waxing poetic about how you were…are…forever will be…that famous happy ending for me that they talk about in those stupid romantic movies.
“Why not?” Sherlock asks, still calm as his heart breaks.
“I know, but…” John starts nervously, biting his lip as he debates how to ask without sounding needy, “I asked you to tell me again in the morning,” he settles on a reminder.
After voicing the opinion, he accepts it as truth. This entire collection of footage has been devoted to Sherlock and John, any women (of romantic interest or not) merely an accessory. Holmes is worried that Watson may have made this same connection after his statement, but one look at him proves that he is too distracted by John and Mary to have really heard him.
If John didn't know Sherlock as well as he did, he would not have noticed the tightening of his muscles and the fight to keep his face impassive, “Dull,” he repeated.
“Yes, there was no skill to it like this shows, he was merely hoping for fate to keep him safe. It worked many times before, and I am glad you came along for me.”
Mary gets a text about John being in the fire and immediately goes to find Sherlock to help. She mentions that she recognized it to be a skip code and Sherlock gives her a brief calculating look before focusing again.
Watson laughs.
John cuts off his rambling with a fond shake of his head, eyes shining with adoration as his left hand lands gently on Sherlock’s cheek, guiding his full attention to him, “It’s perfect, actually.”
John mutters about telegrams in a tone of dawning realization and Sherlock latches on to it as if it were a cue. He belittles the tradition of reading them before proceeding to quote the cards with complete disdain, then throwing the rest to the table one at a time.
Sherlock looked up from his microscope and towards his friend on the sofa in an accusatory manner, “What do you mean you don’t know? You’re supposed to help me through this!”
“I saw stars,” Sherlock explained, “Galaxies of them, sparkling and clear.”
. John had started to have filthy dreams which left him right on the edge of a spectacular orgasm the moment he woke up. He no longer had any interest in sex with women, just the thought of Sherlock's long fingers wrapping around his erection was enough to get him off.
Glugging his scotch, Sherlock nodded quickly and stood up, swooping into his bedroom and closing the door once more, leaving John feeling helpless and saddened in the kitchen. He had thought getting Sherlock to agree to go would lift some stress from both of their shoulders, but he had been wrong. He went to his own bedroom with a heavy heart, remembering his new-found knowledge of Sherlock’s past.
Sherlock doesn’t wait long before beginning to move. They have shared this dance countless times and he knows the steps by heart.
,” he says defensively.
John nods, “They instruct you to always keep it within reach. Just in case.”
John sighs heavily, closing his eyes and clenching his fists to restrain himself from going over to physically reassure his best friend. He opens his eyes and instead asks, “Did you clean up the classroom before you came here?”
John smiles up at Sherlock, who still appears entranced by John’s face, and says, “Yeah, so have we,” then turns back to Angelo and says sincerely, “Thank you.”
Sherlock is shocked in to silence as he takes in this information. He clears his throat slightly before asking, “Did I snore?”
“I’m going to go to the bottom of the bed,” John whispered, kissing Sherlock’s nose in an intimate gesture, “and we’re going to get started.”
Now, I
John looks at him curiously, “Of course it was. You disagree?”
Sherlock’s palm encasing the ring begins to sweat as John simply stares at him like he’s about to cry.
John simply smiles sleepily before he turns on to his right side, leaving room behind him for Sherlock to join him. His bed is smaller than Sherlock’s, but it’s certainly big enough for two. Sherlock stands gracefully before situating himself behind John, also on his right side so he’s facing the other man. There is, as usual, a small expanse of unclaimed space between them; a neutral void where the rules do not apply. Sherlock reaches his left hand across this space to place the backs of his fingers against John’s spine comfortingly. He feels John breathe in a deep breath before letting it out slowly, the tension leaving his body.
They release a relieved breath in tandem when Sherlock and Mycroft appear on screen.
Mrs. Holmes tapped Sherlock on the hip and tutted, “Uncle Rudy was a lovely man. He always bought you thoughtful gifts.”
On screen, Sherlock is again attempting to talk to John about the case, but the shorter man can’t think of anything else besides him being in a relationship. He’s hung up on it.
At the hotel, Moran tries to make his escape but is stopped by police at the elevator.
“Yeah, well, I’m tired,” he bites out and doesn’t pause again until he’s in his room with his door closed.
Watson reaches for the remote and pauses the shot from this new camera.
Holmes tsks and rolls his eyes.
Sherlock’s hands twitched in thin air as John quickly opened the flies of Sherlock’s trousers, pulling them down to his ankles before kissing the inside of Sherlock’s thighs gently. In their previous sexual escapades, John had discovered how sensitive Sherlock’s thighs really were; whenever they were touched or caressed it was an immediate switch for Sherlock’s arousal, goosebumps sparking across pale skin which seemed to lead directly to his cock. John smiled, kissing the silky soft skin and giving it a playful bite as he took Sherlock’s prick from his boxers and gave it a few warm-up strokes, thumbing across the plummy head and smearing the plentiful precome.
“But what?” John asks, slightly exasperated. He was only trying to do what Sherlock had suggested; keep him
“Mmm,” Sherlock said, but he was frowning with concentration, “Odd. Not unpleasant, but not exactly comfortable, either.”
They stood staring at each other for another half a minute before Sherlock abruptly took off towards the door.
John, on the other hand, is a bit more social by nature, but mostly he’s just a people pleaser. He wants to be a medi-wizard, and he is charismatic enough to do so, but he honestly envies Sherlock a little. Sherlock is so confident in who he is that he can’t be bothered if anyone really likes him, he’s brilliant enough at what he does that people still begrudgingly admit that he’s right.
“That’s why I needed to create this potion. Not to know what love feels like, but to know truthfully if what I was feeling for you was it. Well, it is and I’ll tell you something I didn’t expect: love bloody
She laughs coldly, “I knew you’d see reason.”
that Sherlock is planning is not going to work out the same way his own return did, Holmes can plainly see already. He wills his counterpart to not do this but to walk away and take some time to think of a new plan.
“Ah,” his smile only seemed to grow somehow, “he’s a good man you’ve got there. I can’t tell you how happy I am that you’ve found someone to take care of and appreciate you.”
“And then I miscalculated and ruined everything,” I say aloud to no one, my disdain for myself radiating through me.
grievously injured. I’ve hurt my wrist,” Sherlock admitted with a wince as he held his left arm up to show John, “I think it’s broken.”
“More than weird: unnerving, even.”
“Yes, John,” Sherlock breathes out heavily, longing to bridge the small gap between them.
Sherlock looks at him curiously, aware of this exact exchange happening during their very first cab ride together all those years ago, “John, are you aware that you’ve already used those words before?”
“Holmes.”
“No, I didn’t mean
“Who?” Sherlock shuddered, “Who would lower themselves to sleeping with that bag of arseholes?”
“No shit, Sherlock; that’s the first place I looked.”
He sits up and wearily pulls the small journal to his lap, his hands shaking. He opens where it specifies.
Hope you caught/enjoyed the parallel of Sherlock/John deciding whether to watch the movies same as Holmes/Watson did in the last fic!
“I don’t actually care,” Watson smiles sweetly at him.
John, meanwhile, was clearing away the various objects from the kitchen table. He had an insane idea of actually eating at the table, but now was regretting his decision as he looked down at a beaker which seemed to be growing its own mutated lifeforms.
John moaned and bucked harder again, “It’s…intense,” he repeated, at a loss for other descriptors, “So good. I don’t know what else to say…”
“Oh, these Americans were so idiotic;
“Shhhh,” Holmes cuts him off, feeling something different about what’s playing out but he can’t yet put his finger on it.
you done?”
They take off their snow-covered coats and gear. The snow storm had come in suddenly, unexpected as they were working on their most recent (outdoor) case. They were close to being done, but they still found themselves out in the elements for an hour more before Sherlock would allow them to leave.
No more words are needed and they eventually fall in to a peaceful slumber, Sherlock’s head and left hand resting near John’s beating heart.
“It has been a bit weird, hasn’t it?”
“You’ve watched me. Just...do what I did,” John responded nervously, unsure whether he could actually help him the way he knew Sherlock was asking. Playing dumb was a bit of a necessity at times with the younger man, now being a perfect example.
Holmes fights a smile, but he’s decidedly pleased that his friend finds his parents endearing, even if he himself refuses to outwardly admit that he agrees.
“The guy who is retiring?” John said, flicking his eyes to the mantle.
John brings Greg up to the hospital room, but they discover that he’s gone missing. John and Greg involve Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson in a desperate attempt to locate him, while Mary questions the less usual suspects for clues (Anderson and his woman friend). Molly comes on screen and admits that Sherlock has been staying with her.
“That?” he gestures to the TV, “Please, Mrs. Hudson deserves so much better than a man who uses her to cheat on his wives.”
"Entertain me," Sherlock demands.
Without so much as turning around or slowing his gait, he shouted back, “You are looking for two wealthy brothers. One has a cane with a handle the shape of a wolf’s head. It’s the murder weapon.”
Sherlock’s brow furrows, “March 31st,” he corrects.
John smiled warmly again, “I know, and I very much plan to bugger you senseless,” his smile turned into more of a leer, “but it’s not all about hard and fast.”
On his way to the most prominent of the rear ones – a large, dark freckle mid-back just to the left of his spine – he strays to kiss the scars. There are only five remaining: the proof of Sherlock’s time away all those years ago. Proof of the precise lengths he was willing to go to protect John. John’s heart swells with love and regret every time he sees them. How he ever missed that Sherlock cared this much for him is beyond his comprehension. That he ever thought this man to be an unfeeling
John moves his attention to Sherlock’s left middle finger, between the first and second knuckles, and places a kiss on the freckle there. He notes with a touch of sadness that it, too, is fading. He trades the left hand for the right, kissing the freckle on the knuckle that will keep getting lighter until there’s no trace of it left. He kisses the even lighter one on the ring finger, followed by the slightly darker one near his wrist.
“You spoil him too much,” were her first words upon sitting down.
Next came Sherlock’s inquiry of, “Who painted the kitten?” to which John replied with such conviction, “The dog walker. Had to be.”
When Sherlock lifts his hands to hesitantly land on John’s hips, the older man breaks away. John sits on Sherlock’s lap, not quite in the right position for them to feel the other’s arousal, and lowers his hands to Sherlock’s chest.
“You look,” he trailed off, in search for the right descriptor, “sad.”
“I hate that no one will ever know that you are mine,” I admitted quietly, feeling ashamed at my selfishness.
Sherlock leans down to be able to hide his still-embarrassed face in John’s neck before whispering, “John,” in a tone that’s completely new to both of their ears.
Sherlock locks eyes with him a bit guiltily, unsure what to do now that his consciousness has reclaimed its hold. To his horror, Sherlock’s hips thrust forward of their own volition, reminding both men that their erections have not abated one iota. They both moan and John can’t help himself as he dives in to claim Sherlock’s lips with his own, his right hand moving from his cheek to the back of his head to hold him tight. Sherlock moans deep in his throat as John pulls slightly at his hair, same as in his dream.
“Fine, but I liked it. Will you do it again?”
“Can’t,” Sherlock said with a shake of his head and a mischievous smile before lifting his left arm pointedly, “my wrist is broken, remember?”
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s heart gave a particularly painful ache at the words. He shook his head and admitted on a whisper, “We’re not actually together.”
“I didn’t know for sure,” he admits.
“You mean for me to join you?”
“Mary would have hated my facial hair,” Watson points out.
“Are they really cataloguing each book by hand?” Watson asks a bit later as Sherlock and John begin going through the book collections of Van Coon and Lukis.
John waves his hand unconcernedly, “Same thing.”
“Attractive,” Sherlock chuckles from beneath him.
“How does it work?” Sherlock is completely enthralled by John’s information, and he doesn’t even really realize that he’s still holding John’s Armed Forces coin in his hand, running his fingers over it reverently.
Irene texts Sherlock, letting him know that she’s not dead, and both John and Irene are surprised to hear the text alert moaning nearby. Sherlock strides out, unsure what to make of the conversation he just overheard. He arrives back at Baker Street and notices that the door has been forced. He deduces that Mrs. Hudson has been dragged up the stairs against her will.
for two bleeding minutes so he can fall asleep.
; their ideas ensnared my muse and it had to be written. By which I mean "thank you" (I turn in to a bit of the Sherlock sometimes).
; you have no idea why that would be a bit not good, do you?”
The next thing Sherlock registers is sitting in his chair next to a blazing fireplace in their living room. John is standing not too far from him wearing jeans, a brown belt, a plaid button-up, and a red cardigan. John’s hands are in his pockets and he’s calmly looking at Sherlock.
Watson’s stomach drops. John is bored, missing the adventurous life he had before Mary. The life he had with Sherlock. It’s odd to think about how you – in a different dimension – can have such a drastically different life based on a few timeline changes.
Sherlock, John, and Mary follow Sholto to his room where Sherlock shouts through the door that he’s not safe in there. Sherlock doesn’t know how the killer does it, but Sholto demands that he figure it out before he’ll open the door.
“And really, ‘Holmes and Watson’ sounds classier than ‘Sherlock and John’.”
“Nope,” John insists, sighing and getting up, “You’d have burnt my stuff.”
different, “Right.”
“Berk,” John scoffs and begins to travel kisses along Sherlock’s jawline and down his throat, finding all of the small erogenous zones which Sherlock had no idea existed before this moment. For example: there is apparently a spot just to the left of his adam’s apple which makes his leg do a funny twitch thing.
It’s only a few minutes before the other three men walk through the door together, laughing loudly.
“You…” Watson starts shakily when the opening credits begin, but has to swallow thickly before continuing, “that happened to you?”
terrible; I’m sure I could tolerate it for a bit longer.”
it, Sherlock; you’ve done it once. That’s not mastering it…that’s just once,” he reiterated.
Sherlock gave him one of his
John lifts his right hand, wanting nothing more in his exhausted, frustrated state than to smack his best friend in the face.
Sherlock swallows thickly and sits down, trying not to look as nervous as he feels.
Once he was showered and shaved, John knocked on the adjoining door to Sherlock's bedroom, pushing it open and stepping into the dark room, made darker by the black-out curtains.
know that the Earth goes around the Sun?” He asks honestly.
Sherlock’s eyebrows rose in shocked confusion, his stomach fluttering with a strange excitement at listening to something so intimate. Ever since John had returned to Baker Street, his masturbation habits had been quite rare. To be precise, he typically indulged in the act every fourth or fifth day now, as opposed to every second or third before The Mary Incident (Sherlock refused to remember that it was, in fact, a marriage), and John had just had a wank in the shower yesterday.
“Are you not going to say it back?” Sherlock asks. It sounds robotic because of the potion, but the aching in his heart at the thought that his feelings aren’t returned radiates through him, hatefully reminding him that he is human.
“Those stories are not like that,” I negated sadly.
This story honestly took me nearly a month to complete. I think it was just hard for me to think of John in a situation like this and all the emotions that went in to it.
Holmes looked incredibly confused, as well as concerned, “Good lord, what is it?”
They watch as John has what seems like his first conversation with what they would both consider to be the real Sherlock, with his outlandish demands and making John text a murderer without so much as an explanation first.
Sherlock’s eyes shoot up to John’s in fear. He’s so scared of ruining things, going too far, asking for too much.
“I see the solar system is making a comeback,” Watson observes with amusement, though he knew it was coming.
“How does that even happen? Aren’t there people around?” Holmes questions, confused by this variant from their own timeline. He met Kitty, certainly, but it wasn’t in a men’s restroom, for crying out loud.
“They deserve this, too.”
,” Holmes insists, as though insulted at the notion.
Holmes clears his throat uneasily, “Yes, that’s right. I had forgotten. My apologies.”
“Then why are you so worked up?”
When Holmes turns his head to lock eyes with him, the look within them is incredibly vulnerable and sad, “Yes,” he whispers.
“Frightened of what?” John asks in honest shock.
They may be more than the marks on their bodies, but John can’t help but love every tiny detail about this crazy man that he is proud to call his.
“No, because I didn’t try to make a joke of my return. Because I apologized sincerely from the start. Because I didn’t lie about us nearly dying to force you to forgive me!” His voice rises steadily with each sentence until he’s looking intensely in to Watson’s eyes.
to even continue watching, much less someone else, as well. But he can’t communicate this, so he says nothing as Watson reaches to start the DVD again.
big,” he chuckled.
“What, by making him think they’re about to die?!” Watson is once more offended on behalf of his counterpart, “Jesus. Sherlock is almost worse at this friendship thing than you are!”
“I’d rather not,” Sherlock responded, looking straight forward as his eyes followed the progress of the car.
“What the
John moans quietly at the sight before him, his already incredibly hard cock pulsing at the trusting, submissive pose. It’s always like this: it starts off with John having every intention of taking this slow, worshiping him for
“Sherlock and you sent John and me to the scene because you didn’t deem it interesting enough to leave the flat for.”
Sherlock's eyes flicked to John, his mouth opening before shutting, “I don't know him.”
“Oh my God,” it’s Holmes’ turn to whisper. Without thinking, he places his left hand over his mouth in shock, his right blindly reaching out to Watson and grasping his left forearm strongly. Holmes turns to look at him, but Watson’s eyes are glazed over with painful memories and he doesn’t notice, “My dear Watson,” Holmes whispers to him, a portrayal of his loss for adequate words.
“John?” he asks, uncertain and a bit frightened.
“No!” John shouted, clenching his fists at his sides, “This isn’t appropriate. Can you not just let this drop?!”
John huffed, rolling his eyes and settling back in the seat. The rest of the journey was tense with an awkward silence until the car rolled around a small bend in the road and onto a private, winding driveway.
Watson breathes deep, “It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, losing the two people who meant the most to me in such a short span of time. I wanted to give up so many times,” he closes his eyes briefly as he swallows, then opens them to admit one last thing: “But I knew - even dead - that you would call me an idiot for being so weak, so I pushed on.”
“Yeah,” John agrees, a bit disappointed. He wants to blurt out his feelings; grab his face and kiss him hard. It seemed so easy in his head as he allowed himself to imagine taking that final step, but reality is uncertain and Sherlock’s face gives nothing away in the cold light of the day.
“It is what I mean,” Watson says with relief, glad he’s not the only one feeling it, “so what’s different?”
Interesting.
“But when
didn’t do it.”
“How…?” Watson starts, but doesn’t finish.
“Good of you to notice,” Watson huffs out, the sting of jealousy returning slightly.
“Not actually a compliment,” he admonishes, but is still smiling.
“See?” Watson points at the screen, as if John saying the words makes his own thoughts on the matter more valid.
“Damn! I thought for sure we’d get at least two rounds from the table!” Bill mock-pouts, “Looks like it’s just you, Zach.”
“I am so sorry,” Holmes apologizes with both voice and sincere eyes.
Watson descends the steps the following morning to find Holmes still sitting on the couch in a thinking pose. He by-passes him and makes his way to the loo before making tea for the two of them.
“That’s what I keep you around for, as my chauffer,” Watson smirks and Holmes fights his own with an eyeroll.
John sniffs while moving his mouth in a small circle, making his nose twitch from side to side. It’s adorable, but Sherlock won’t mention it.
“He’s not flirting, he’s just being friendly!” Watson argues.
Mycroft explains the West case, Holmes and Watson watch in amusement as John and Sherlock undermine him in the smallest of ways to annoy him, and they head out to a case with Greg which is familiar to them.
John smiles in return, offering his own hand in greeting, “John.”
When you’re ready to speak to me properly again…
go,” he smirks.
Sure enough, Sherlock fumbles for words for the first few moments. Moriarty took this opportunity to place in flashbacks to others talking to each other about Sherlock needing to give a speech and read telegrams in front of a crowd if John asks him to be his best man.
The next three days have them fairly well consumed in a case. Not a dangerous one, but it offers many opportunities for Sherlock to admire his companion in a new light. Sherlock watches as John exercises his wit and performs some deductions, but best of all: he exhibits his strength by forcing the suspect against the wall and threatening him in a low tone.
Holmes and Watson both have their brows creased in confusion. In their timeline, they had snuck in to the house thanks to the housemaid (Holmes’ fiancée) and had gotten in to the study. However, before they could find the letters he was using to blackmail Lady Smallwood with, Magnussen had returned with a woman. They didn’t have any direct dealings with Magnussen that night.
“Sherlock!”
“Love potions can create the feeling in anyone who takes it. It creates lies. Veritaserum negates lies.”
“Well, it’s a TV show, isn’t it?”
Sherlock is looking at him hungrily again as he crawls his way closer, “You still need release,” he states huskily, and the words should
“I…what?” John tries to process the situation.
Sherlock shakes his head before nudging their freezing noses together in a quick Eskimo kiss, “Don’t stop,” he whispers in return, a plea.
“I think I need to lie down,” Sherlock mumbles, eyes roving unfocused and his face paling rapidly.
“I think about this freckle,” he says of the mark near his adam’s apple, “and about how sensitive you must be near it,” he places a light kiss to it and causes another moan to be ripped unwillingly from the lanky man below him.
“The fire,” Watson breathes in remembrance.
John looked up from the paper and turned his head to the left to see his friend, “I’m not really sure,” he admitted.
Watson stares at the side of Holmes' face with open affection that he quickly covers, “Careful now, your heart is growing again.”
John tilted his head to the right as he considered, “I think so? I don’t have any reasons to avoid them.”
There is a theory which states that whenever something is lost or misplaced (such as your keys), it has been transported to that same location in a different dimension. If it is not moved, after a time it will return to its proper dimension, which is why it is possible for you to find something in the exact spot you’ve already looked in and it will suddenly be there. The concept is a little fuzzy on what happens if the object is moved from the spot, but it is generally agreed upon that this is how possessions become lost forever.
Holmes turns to him on the couch and honestly begs, “Please don’t make me do this alone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How did they get in to the actual murder site to film about the actual murder?” Watson asks, but knows – just as with the few times before already – that there is no answer to be had.
And John looks like he’s about to cry again, “Damn right we would,” he says firmly, eyes blazing so that Sherlock has no choice but to believe how strongly he feels about it.
“I hate you,” Sherlock mumbled, although John wasn't sure if Sherlock was aiming that at his father, or John himself.
you killed her, or was that a fact that came to light later?” He asks innocently.
“Which part?”
“God,” Holmes breathes out as realization dawns, “he’s absolutely right.”
“I was...well...I was...” Sherlock stammered, then cleared his throat, “I thought I might try that self-fellatio technique. Since we have now mastered masturbation.”
“I really dislike this game. Can we desist?” Sherlock shouts back through a mouthful of toothpaste.
did, I just know that
Watson turns from the image of Mary rushing in to the hospital to instead look at his friend, “Because John was in danger,” he states, the only question in the statement being born from his own insecurity about why that would be.
Holmes finds himself once more wishing he could slap his alternate self. Honestly, could the man be any more bloody obvious about his feelings? He’s helping plan the entire wedding, worrying about details that the happy couple aren’t even concerned about, simply so that the day can be perfect for John. Holmes understands his thinking: if John has chosen to be with Mary - and not him - then he will do everything he can to make it a day worthy of the man. He would do anything for John to be happy after all that he’s put him through.
which I had been interested in viewing,” he reasons.
“Yeah,” Watson agrees simply.
John is still panting, but slowly getting his breathing under control. His muscles ache from being tense and he stares tiredly at the ceiling instead of Sherlock’s eyes because he is just so mentally and physically exhausted. Once he calms, Sherlock finally speaks.
“No. This is Mummy’s house,” Sherlock responded, but John could see the strain slowly building once more.
Watson lifts his left hand to stop him and shakes his head slightly, “No, that’s not the point I’m trying to make,” Holmes gives him a quizzical look, “Doesn’t it seem odd to you that Mary would know it?”
“Sorry?”
Sherlock sighs heavily before finally meeting his eyes, “For the sleep experiment,” he elaborates in an
“He’s yet to pull out your baby book,” Watson tells him, “but I assume that that’s coming shortly. Natural progression and all.”
open right now with how heavy his lids feel.
John hasn’t had to comfort someone having a nightmare before, like others have done for him, but he knows some basics. Without needing to worry about PTSD in Sherlock’s case, he makes a decision. He sits on the cushion next to his friend, not yet touching him. He lays his right hand very lightly against Sherlock’s left shoulder, the whisper of a touch. This appears to drain the worry from Sherlock, but replaces it with an intense sadness.
Holmes finally faces him, “Any number of things could have been happening there, but it wasn’t anything intimate, so stop jumping to conclusions,” he turns away as he finishes.
“The DVDs
Placing one hand on Sherlock's hip and holding the other tight, John smiled and began to move in a gentle box step. It wasn't fancy, and John knew he would never get invited onto Strictly Come Dancing, but he could make do for tonight.
” Holmes imitates himself, then responds to himself in a higher tone, “
“Don’t start making assumptions about me and your brother like others do about Sherlock and John,” he chides lightly.
Holmes nods and presses play.
The videos - presented as three separate series - were discovered in Moriarty’s possession once Sherlock and the government had finally caught up to him. It saved Sherlock from going on the probable suicide mission and leaving John, but at what emotional cost? Mary has been indicted as an accomplice to Moriarty and the baby has been proven to be his, not John’s. So a newly single John is back in 221B, but again: at what cost?
“Why would I have touched them?” Comes the indignant reply from the bathroom, “You know they offend me.”
?” Holmes asks defensively, just as Sherlock does a few seconds afterward. Watson smirks in triumph, as if that proves some sort of point.
bored,” Sherlock sighs and then stands up, “I’m going to find things to burn.”
Holmes rolls his eyes and Sherlock swallows thickly, nervous. He has spent so long avoiding deducing John’s feelings because he doesn’t want to find them absent. But this is giving him hope, which is absolutely terrifying.
People think that I’m an asshole because I hate people or don’t understand human nature, but the truth is that I understand it
“No, he’s not,” Holmes says in a way which ends that particular debate.
This is the way Sherlock wakes up: John in his arms, their legs entwined intimately.
Sherlock and Mycroft are outside the house smoking. They discuss why Sherlock hates Magnussen (praying on the weird and different), an offer with MI6 (that would prove to be fatal within about six months) that Mycroft wants him to turn down, and then an uncharacteristic declaration of brotherly affection.
“I thought you were talking in
He pulls back far enough to agree, “Okay.”
“No,” Watson shakes his head resolutely, “There’s a difference between thrill seeking and choosing to love a hired killer.”
Sherlock finally exits the bathroom and comes to the living room, “It’s not like they’re the originals; they’re not completely inept.”
Your average seventh year at Hogwarts typically spends their evenings studying with their friends until extremely late, then going to bed once their tears have abated. Graduation is nearly upon them, and they could never have even dreamed this stress level up. It makes their fifth year OWL prep seem mild.
“Tell me to stop if it’s too much,” John whispered, his hand moving to stroke a lock of hair away from Sherlock’s sweaty forehead.
“Ooooh,” Sherlock whined, his legs going slightly weak, which sent his fingers grappling at the hallway wall, “John -- John should we not…take this to the bedroom?”
Watson groans in aggravation, “Oh Jesus, I had nearly forgotten about her.”
Moriarty enters, the voice they haven’t heard in nearly four years grating around in their skulls like nails on a chalkboard. Holmes and Watson grimace in distaste.
I imagined that I could love you; the way my heart ached for you could leave no room for doubt any longer. I imagined that I could open my heart to you, because you already accepted it for all its coldness and locks. I imagined that I could open my body to you in a way I have never wanted to even attempt with anyone else, because you were the first person to care enough to make sure I actually took care of my transport. I imagined that I could be happy with you, if only I could convince you to stay by my side.
“Hello,” he smiles in return.
“Hmm,” Greg nodded and ran a hand through his grey hair, “So…John said no?”
“Jesus, give me strength,” John whispered to himself before marching to his room, collecting his bottle of lubricant and two clean flannels for afterwards. He went to Sherlock’s room and stood awkwardly in the doorway, looking at Sherlock lying back with his black boxer-briefs slightly tented already. John averted his gaze, despite the picture being burnt into his retinas, and then walked to the side of the bed. He pulled off his jeans until he was clad in just his boxers and a shirt before sitting tentatively on the bed.
Sherlock fights back another surge of hope.
Lestrade didn’t indulge like this very often, mostly because he was always on call and didn’t have time to stretch out his self-indulgent wanks, but this time the most recent case was over and he wasn’t rota-ed in until the day after. He lay back on his sofa and put in his favourite Busty Asian Babe’s DVD and pumped some hand cream into his palm with an excited wiggle.
“I love you,” he repeats, just as easily. Behind the bit of glazed-over calmness, Sherlock is freaking out. The veritaserum is potent enough to get him to only speak truths, but is diluted enough that he can still register what is happening. He will remember everything.
“Yes.”
“It’s an unorthodox move,” John admits, blushing slightly at the sentiment of it all; it’s just a coin, afterall. But it’s not really
They exit the building to face a throng of reporters, then the screen fades out before fading back in. There’s a random looking room with a bunch of random looking things all around, then there’s a screen that shows Sherlock pulling John from the bonfire on a loop, Mary yelling his name. Then a pair of eyes, watching it avidly.
Holmes is confused by the reaction; he obviously wasn’t involved in this conversation so doesn’t know where this is going. He watches avidly as John becomes choked up, unable to speak past his tears. He tries to start (
“This is preposterous,” Holmes spits out as Sherlock shows up, “this is akin to those bloody Bond movies you enjoy making me watch.”
offend you; they’re bloody stalker footage. But our lawyer is going to kill us if we lost this case evidence.”
Holmes goes in to a pout, “No,” is all he says, leading Watson to assume he’s correct.
Sherlock blinked but allowed himself to be pulled through the crowd onto the dancefloor. A few other couples had joined in, but they were the only same-sex relationship in the room – not that it bothered John – but it did worry Sherlock.
“Well, Jesus, why didn’t you say that before? I could have been feeding you up all these years that easily?”
“Weren’t we singing
certainly isn’t in love with his best friend? He’s not sure he could do it.
“What is your plan?” Sherlock asks calmly, though inside he is frantic with the need to get John out of harms way.
Holmes looks down and away, the guilt flooding through him, “I couldn’t take you with me; you had a wife for us both to consider.”
“Ugh, the beard
John and Mrs. Hudson go upstairs to the flat and John has difficulty taking it in. Mrs. Hudson opens the dusty blinds; she couldn’t face letting it out, but she also couldn’t face going in and keeping it clean. John admits that he’s got some news and Mrs. Hudson immediately thinks he’s dying. He admits that he’s met someone and he’s finally moving on, prepared to ask them to marry him. Mrs. Hudson is at first confused about it being so soon after Sherlock, but then gets very excited.
“I think you’re overestimating how much sleep I’m actually getting when we share a bed,” John counters defensively, “I’m the one who tells you what happens in the night, in case you’ve forgotten.”
“John…” Sherlock says, at a rare loss for words.
Larry groans pathetically from his fetal position on the ground and Sherlock rushes forward to kick the knife out of his reach.
“I know,” he had agreed quietly, “Why should we have to hide? Life is far too short to live in such fear; never a breath you can afford to waste.”
The rounds continue, each man drinking deep and filling up their glasses until the bottle is half empty and the men become rather tipsy and loose lipped. They stop for a break to eat and then burn the carriers and most of the extra cardboard which the delivery driver had given them, but it doesn’t last long before the room is colder than usual. The brief heat simply serving to make everything seem much colder than it previously was.
I will never have you back the way I once did, and I have no one to blame but myself. If only I had realized the signs for what they were before it was too late…
“In one word, what is your work?” He asks with his heart racing, needing the clarity.
"John!" Sherlock scolds with a defiant crease to his brow.
Sherlock rolls over on to his back and John is granted a small ray of hope, for Sherlock has stopped snoring in this new position. John sighs in relief as his eyes fall closed, ready to take full advantage of the situation. If he can just fall asleep before Sherlock starts up again, maybe he’d be able to ignore it.
“Oh god,” John moaned, knowing there was no escape from his orgasm as Sherlock climaxed intensely, spilling between their bodies in thick pulses whilst his insides clenched and throbbed around him. John kept his eyes open as best he could as he reached orgasm, coming with a harsh cry of Sherlock’s name as he came hard, filling Sherlock with his come and shivering with the sensation.
John turns away briefly, laughing, and Sherlock gives him a subdued smile in return.
“No, don’t pity me,” John orders crossly. He hates pity for doing his duty to his country.
“Where would I go?” John asked in confusion before realising that Sherlock meant the eye contact that they were making. John made a concentrated effort to keep his eyes on Sherlock alone, opening his expression so that Sherlock could see his true feelings.
John rests his hand more solidly against the shoulder while whispering “Shhh.”
“No, this is different now,” Watson points at the telly almost accusingly, “we never separated.”
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock says slowly, his hand slipping from John’s thigh from mere lack of control; his arm just loosens and the contact breaks. John takes it as a heartbreakingly bad sign, “You who have known him assume we’re together, but John’s always touting vehemently about how he’s not gay.”
Next come the flashes of various cases they either took or dismissed; they are all familiar to the pair. John and Sherlock bicker in the morgue about whose website is more popular and Sherlock storms off in a strop, leaving John and Greg to look at each other in confusion.
Mary demands that John run Sherlock so he knows that things won’t change between them once they’re married. John goes back in to the room and begs Sherlock to find an interesting case for them to work so that he isn’t driven crazy by these wedding details that he doesn’t care about. They agree on The Bloody Guardsman and Mary gives them both a thumbs up, having been working both boys to take the other out on a case.
the other man. He leads John to lie on his back with his mere predatory dominance, his desire-filled eyes locked with John’s. He straddles his hips, feeling desirous; John may have just spent ample time worshiping his body, but now it was his turn to do the same. He holds John’s cock steady as he slowly lowers himself on to it.
“John wouldn’t let me watch him. It was either you or my brother and...well...I’d rather be ignorant of what deviance my brother indulges in,” Sherlock explained cooly, “So, come on,” he gestured vaguely towards the sofa cushion still covering Lestrade’s modesty, “on with it.”
“But I want…” Sherlock trailed off all on his own, still a bit shy in expressing his direct wants at times.
Back to the Holmes residence at Christmas, Mary snarks at John about actually talking to her today, the first time in months. He pulls out a flash drive with the initials A.G.R.A on it.
“Did you invite Sholto to your wedding?” Holmes asks.
, dammit! While he originally thought he might not be able to find sleep due to the awkward situation, he finds that sleep finds
“My dearest Watson, there is nothing you could say to me that I would judge you harshly for. I know the good man that you are; there is no danger here.”
“Holmes!” Watson hisses at him with a glare.
“No! John please…” Sherlock hummed, suddenly tilting his head softly, “I...I have no other source but you. You’re the only person I know who would, and I trust you. You won’t laugh at me and --”
John smiled widely and twisted their bodies so they were closer to his bedroom than the stairs. Pushing Sherlock through the doorway, John manhandled them until Sherlock was resting with his back to the wall and John’s strong, muscular thigh between his legs.
“It's bigger than our flat,” John joked, nodding, “It's fine, yeah, thanks.”
“Yeah, but…”
“Hello,” she smiles at John.
John obliges, pausing briefly to place a kiss to a small freckle on the underside of his jaw first, before continuing to one of the most prominent of the freckles. John feels as though the one slightly to the right of his adam’s apple should have always been his favorite due to its ability to draw his gaze to the tantalizing expanse of sensitive flesh there. But it doesn’t land at the proper location; so instead of being a marker of Sherlock’s most sensitive spot, it instead acts as a decoy.
“Not to me,” Sherlock had admitted with a grimace, pulling that face that showed he was genuinely frustrated at the gap in his knowledge.
When you’re ready to come home…
“Then why am I here?” John grumps as he glares at the taller man.
Sherlock gets a text from Moriarty and goes to the roof to meet him. Their discussion here is very similar to the one Holmes and he had when Moriarty appeared on the trail once Watson had gone. They both amounted to one thing: Sherlock Holmes must die to be able to save anyone he cares about.
They discover that Janine has passed out (Sherlock briefly entertains the ridiculous idea that she fainted from the sheer joy of his proposal) as well as one of the security guards. Sherlock smells Clair-de-la-Lune and knows that the attacker – must be Lady Smallwood – is still in the building. He leaves John with Janine and continues upstairs.
“Oh, God, you bloody…” John started to attempt a curse at the man, but the brilliant pleasure was simply too much for his mind to try to multitask a false insult
“Calm,” John whispered, deepening the kiss and rubbing a hand up and down Sherlock’s stomach and chest, “I’m going to touch you now…”
“I’ve still never quite figured this one out,” Watson says, “
“Sherlock!” John shouted, seizing up and throwing back his head as his orgasm burst over him and left him wrung out and shaking. Semen glistened on his stomach and when Sherlock pulled back, he did so tentatively before looking at John with a grimace.
“How long could we have been doing this for?” John asks.
Angelo shakes his head, “No charge, for the food
With a heavy sigh, I replaced the letter to the table and moved to ask Mrs. Hudson for a late supper and cuppa. That night, I slept uneasy.
John gets back to 221B and discovers, just as Watson had when he returned to the hotel, that there wasn’t any medical emergency. The wave of fear knowing that he had left Sherlock Holmes alone, vulnerable to attack, sets John Watson back in to motion to return to his friend.
“Not sure I want to know how they have sex,” Sherlock grimaced, scooping more of John’s come up between his fingers and rubbing it together, “But they’ve been intimate for a while.”
“That building…that room.”
“Good?” John smiled, marking a deep purple bruise into the skin of Sherlock’s chest.
And that, dear reader, is a moment I would like to never forget but could never dream of immortalizing in The Strand. I just hope that whenever it is that you are reading this, you can accept the love that Holmes and I have held for each other these many, happy years.
“There's a school reunion,” John continued, reading out a little part, “combined with a surprise retirement party for a Professor Ellis.”
“I think he was trying to make you jealous,” Sherlock says, still thrown off-kilter by the blatant flirting. He hasn’t been hit on like that since college.
"Unsurprising," he says, standing from the fireplace yet again to reclaim his chair, "We're going to need to check Mrs. Hudson's flat for more wood soon."
Mycroft tells John that Irene is really, truly dead. John heads up to the flat, file in hand, to deliver the (fake) news that she is in the Witness Protection Program in America.
(Can't tell I love musicals, can you?)
“No,” he stresses truthfully, “why would I?”
They spend the rest of the ride in a deep intellectual conversation about varying forms of punishment and torture of the past. Some things, they agree, could be brought back (like public floggings), but some are better left at rest (like the iron maiden).
John wakes up in the unlit bonfire - groggy, disoriented, and unable to move - and attempts to call for help but can’t.
tasting Sherlock’s mouth. With a quiet moan of disappointment, John pulls back after a few short moments, but he can’t help but place a small peck to the lips in apology as he moves away.
?!” Watson fumes.
someone!”
"I am
“Oh, is this where we're going for the reunion?” John asked, watching as Sherlock nodded in silence.
“Work to do,” Sherlock insists halfheartedly. His brain wants to continue, but his body is forcing him to rest after his mistreatment of it.
This shocks John. He’s known for years that he’s in love with Sherlock, he just kept tamping it down because Sherlock’s not in to that sort of thing. He’d rather have him as a best friend than nothing at all, “You didn’t
but his thought was cut off by a sudden, slightly louder moan from the other side of the door.
Or would you simply turn and walk away?
Sherlock moans loudly, managing out an, “Oh,
Sherlock promised them both silently.
“And scare him off?” he scoffs, “No, thank you.”
“Boringly human,” Sherlock responded, rolling his eyes, “but it’s fine; I know you weren't being malicious.”
John shuts him up with a kiss, relishing in the feel of Sherlock melting into it in submission with a tiny moan. John entwines their legs further, but winces when he feels the slick discomfort of his Y-fronts. He pulls back reluctantly.
“This isn’t exactly the surgery!” He snapped, eyes challenging him back before he realised the picture that they made at the moment: two grown, mostly-naked men talking about how to wank properly.
For a moment they simply stare in to each other’s eyes, coming to the unspoken understanding that, platonic or romantic,
After the rocky start, Sherlock turns suddenly very serious about how truly wonderful a man John is and that Mary deserves him. The sentiment sends that familiar sense of unease through both Holmes and Watson’s stomachs, though they still can’t place why. By the end of this portion, everyone is in tears as Sherlock attempts to move on to funny stories about John.
“Alright what?” Sherlock asks, looking apprehensively at the glassware that separates them.
John and Mrs. Hudson have a quiet conversation about the history of Sherlock’s love life.
The four strangers go slack-jawed while John merely smiles brightly at him, shaking his head in amusement. Sherlock can’t help but smile back at him.
John smiles at his understanding, and the feeling of hope that they may come out on the right side of this after all, “Tell me again in the morning, then.”
The fact that he’s standing outside the door of John’s single room at 2:30 in the morning, drawn there by the potion, is undeniable proof.
Sherlock and John move to question the little girl once Greg and Sally have finished, but the little girl starts screaming as soon as she sees Sherlock, planting the first seed of doubt in a few minds. As Sherlock peers out the window, lights across the way come on to reveal I.O.U. painted on the windows. When they leave the station, Sherlock gets in the cab alone, leaving John to catch his own.
Sherlock comes to the house pretending to be a photographer; they cause a ruckus of confusion before heading swiftly off of the premises. Sherlock gives his findings to Greg. John becomes frustrated with Sherlock, realizing that he knew the answer for much longer than he had let on and just let an innocent woman sit attached to a bomb for no reason.
“I’m sure you can help me with it in the morning,” John grinned, kissing Sherlock’s head.
“Theme song. There’s a theme song,” Holmes points out needlessly.
Neither Holmes nor Watson can look away, entranced by this perspective of one of their most life-altering moments as friends and colleagues.
“I know, silly boy,” she tutted, walking to engulf John in a motherly hug that momentarily had John remembering his own mother, “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Watson.”
Watson inhales sharply to see the mirror image of his late wife come on screen. He was curious at the beginning of the “episode” when John mentioned getting married, but he had secretly hoped he wouldn’t have to see her on screen.
You move to hug me, but I can practically smell the panic and regret rolling off of you in waves. You wanted to hug me, yes, but you also needed to hide your face from her as you gathered yourself. I am safe and would never judge you for that. I’m not certain the same could be said for your wife.
With a tinge of melancholy, the pair finally separated from the other. Sherlock, his heart aching at being so close to John without it being real, sadly asked, “Has an acceptable amount of time passed where we can leave now? I think I’d rather like to go home.”
His phone rings and he begs Sherlock to come help him, but Sherlock merely asks him questions about what he’s seeing. Once he admits that he can see the hound, Sherlock lets him out of the cage. John is incredibly upset by the proceedings, fighting back tears as he proclaims to Sherlock about what he saw. Sherlock tells him that he didn’t actually see it - only what Sherlock had set him up to perceive - and that they’ve all been drugged.
is yet another shared thought that neither man dares to voice.
“No, now that I see how it truly effected you,” he negates, “not my brightest plan, was it: placing a former soldier in what appeared to be a life-threatening situation?”
“Exploring,” Sherlock shrugged.
“John shouldn’t have come back,” Holmes intones with fear. Surely there’s no way Sherlock can follow through with what he needs to with John right there.
“Yeah, he was always a bit pickier when it came to men. Once he got his sights set on one, all other men disappeared for him,” Zach insinuates with a pointed look and a smirk.
anyway,” Greg smirked, “but you know, two men sharing a urinal trough, you’re bound to look.”
John opens his eyes, all sleepy and amused and content, and says, “You may have turned me down that first night at Angelo’s, but I’ll be damned if I’ve ever met a man who could draw my attention from you.”
“What, this other Holmes and Watson?”
we think you’re together? Jesus Christ, you two fit better than most married couples I’ve seen!” Alan adds with a smile that adds a silent
Watson places his face in his hands with a groan.
After nearly five minutes of this, Sherlock huffed in annoyance before removing his hand from his pants and looking at John with a mixture of anger and defeat, “It isn’t working, John,” he said, almost as an accusation.
“No,” Watson admits, “not for a while now.”
Holmes and Watson watch with rapt attention as Sherlock and John argue over Sherlock’s humanity. It’s one they had themselves, around this time, because the healer in John Watson cannot comprehend the complete lack of empathy that is apparently found in one Sherlock Holmes.
“You mean does John, like me, not see the point in getting a license because of all the convenient public transportation that’s available?”
“Oh thank God, there you are,” John mutters, flushed with arousal.
“Even if I did sing or hum, I certainly wouldn’t do so to some drivel like
Elsewhere, John walks in to one of the labs by himself, looking for clues, and Sherlock begins his experiment. Once John’s eyes are accustomed to the dark, Sherlock turns the lights on as bright as he can and blares an alarm to throw off his equilibrium. John tries to get out of the room but Sherlock has deactivated his card for the moment. He is trapped, and suddenly the lights go out and the alarm stops. He hears movement and spots a cage that appears to have been forced open at the bottom. And then he hears the growling.
“That’s Sherlock, not me.”
“You’re worried about ruining a friendship and a business relationship; I get it. But, Johnny...your guys’ mutual chemistry is off the charts. You are both so ridiculously fond of each other it’s sickening,” he jokes with a bit of smile to lighten the mood, “And honestly? I think you’re a fool if, at our age, you’re letting some stupid fear like that keep you from possibly being happy.”
“Anything interesting?” John asked, taking a sip of his tea, “You've just finished a case; you can't be working on another already.”
“Are you quite alright?” Holmes asked in concern, and I was shaken to realize that I had not even taken notice of him moving back towards me.
“Bedtime. You've been asleep since the opening credits of Star Trek started,” John sighed playfully.
“Holmes, what
John laughed, great belly laughs that shook them both, “Jesus Christ, Sherlock, do you think that’s what I want to imagine, too? You shitting on my knob? No! But it’s easier to push down rather than tense up. That’s a fact. Now…push down and it’ll help.”
“That man is completely psychotic, and I feel extremely fortunate that he is no longer a factor in our lives.”
I would love to hear your thoughts via comment, kudos, or constructive criticism!
?” John frowned, confused, “Why did he visit brothels or glory holes?”
“John, I think you’re becoming irrationally worked up over this whole situation,” Sherlock responded calmly.
John’s face falls serious, “Will you run off without me at crime scenes?”
John rolls his eyes as he walks over to the fireplace, appeased to notice that Sherlock at least changed into dry clothes as he asked. He notes that they don't have much fire wood, but it should last for a few hours until the power comes back on.
“He managed it by placing what is surely an unhealthy number of nicotine patches on his skin. Would you rather I tried that?”
John swallows thickly as he pulls him closer and entwines their legs. He places his lips against Sherlock’s wild curls before whispering vehemently, “I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.”
Sherlock looks up and gives him his
Smutty smutty smut!
Holmes quirks a half smile, “Did Mary think I was a liar?”
It was definitely an odd challenge for me (much like the first part, actually), but I hope you can enjoy it.
Lestrade laughs at how truly Holmesian of a speech it is until his likeness appears on the screen briefly. The oddity of the situation catches him off guard enough to sober him.
John felt terrible and reached to entwine their fingers, resting his other hand on Sherlock’s thigh with a soft smile, “I’m sorry I’m a terrible boyfriend.”
“Do you trust this stranger?”
John smirks, “Well, you never know with Mrs. Hudson.”
Holmes sighs as though put upon before replying, “Yes, but if it’s a video about Jupiter, why are they playing
The cabbie drives them to the school, but he did have to lead Holmes in by gunpoint. Then the bottles appear.
“Mmm?” John acknowledged his request for attention without opening his eyes.
So here he lies next to the only man he’s ever loved and yet will never have, because the truth of the matter is that he doesn’t
“Yes, but if he was concerned about production value, making it look like a legitimate show rather than stalker footage, he would do whatever it took.”
Watson flushes deeply, “Bloody hell, stop it.” The idea that Holmes has ever considered what the size of his penis might be is absurd…and a bit arousing.
“Are you honestly telling me that you don’t know the answer to that yourself?” Watson asks, truly confused. It’s terribly obvious, isn’t it?
“Which reminds me,” Mr. Holmes said as he reached down to another album, pulling it open and showing John a collection of newspaper cuttings and photographs put into one album. Sherlock and John were in each photo, sometimes with Greg, other times by themselves. Sherlock sometimes was wearing his silly hat but John noticed that in every photo, it seemed that John was staring up adoringly at his friend.
He had been asleep two hours when he heard a loud bang and a groan from below. Throwing himself out of bed in just his pants, John took his stairs two at a time and threw open the door to Sherlock’s bedroom, finding the detective sprawled naked on the floor blinking in shock.
(See the end of the chapter for
he knew that he had played right into the other man’s hand.
“I...well, yes...I just thought…” he stammered ineloquently through his embarrassment.
In the car, Sherlock and John discuss Dr. Stapleton’s secret genetic experiments on animals, including the rabbit.
Sherlock bit his lip, looking between John’s eyes and lips before he gave a single, tentative nod.
It takes just 30 seconds for the snoring to start again, and John closes his eyes tighter as he fights honest to God tears of frustration, sobbing quietly at the injustice of the world. He rolls back on to his left side and quickly settles his hand on the other man’s cheek once more while performing a near-silent shushing sound.
“You're only sorry because someone has called you out,” John said, looking back at Sherlock who was looking wide-eyed and stunned, as was the group of men who stood around awkwardly, “You're a coward. A coward and a bigot and you should think about your actions.”
“And for a long-term flatshare,” David adds with a kind-yet-knowing smirk, “you’re really telling us you haven’t ever...that you aren’t…?” he trails off suggestively.
“More exciting than our version but, yes, overall I would have to agree,” he responds, standing up to place the second disc in the player once they discover that there are only two “episodes” on the first one.
As John lay panting on his bed, idly moving his fingers through the traces of his release with a small smile, Sherlock was paralyzed with want. He had never in his entire life been this aroused, of that he was certain, and he had no real idea what to do with that information.
“Alright, you miserable arse,” John huffed, twirling his finger and smirking as he came upon Sherlock’s prostate. John flicked his eyes up to watch Sherlock’s reaction as he stroked his finger over the sensitive nerves surrounding the prostate, not pushing on it directly but certainly enough to stimulate it and cause pleasure, not pain.
Holmes selects
Watson sighs heavily and gives Holmes an apologetic look before turning to their landlady, “Mrs. Hudson, we can explain.”
“Why are you so afraid?” John finally asks sadly, “Can’t you see that they’re right, genius?” the joke comes across as weak since he couldn’t even muster the hint of a smile to go with it.
“Good,” John huffed, putting down the phone with a click of a button and then dropping his phone to the side, rubbing at his face tiredly.
Watson nudges Holmes, who is nearer to her, and the younger man stands to take the tray from her hands to place it on the coffee table. At the same time, Watson drags his chair over to be nearer the couch and gently guides her down in to it, her eyes still fixed on the screen.
Reaching for his phone, he dialed a number and waited until Mycroft’s nasal voice came over the speaker, “Detective Inspector.”
to be my best friend?” He asked with trepidation, subconsciously pulling away from John.
“No,” Holmes scoffs, “as you say: you were married.”
Unlike this alternate Anderson, he really had nothing to do with driving Holmes to fake his death so is still working closely with New Scotland Yard.
“Oh please, what reason would I have had to be cordial to that man?”
“Ugh,” he grunts in aggravation, “how many signs that I wasn’t alone did I overlook before I realized? They’re so obvious!” He had, in fact, overlooked all of them and gotten in to an altercation, just as Sherlock did.
“Coin check!” Bill proclaims before forcefully placing the metal object on the table. He then sits back with his arms crossed over his chest, staring between them all challengingly.
He chuckled humourlessly at the predicament he got himself into before pushing open the door to the lavatory.
, genius,” John elaborates, eyes still resolutely closed in preparation for sleep, “I’m far too tired to deal with your
Sherlock walks in to the restaurant later that evening and pretends to be a waiter.
“We don’t have to continue on,” Holmes says cautiously from the entryway separating kitchen and living area, “If you don’t feel up to it, I mean.”
We never cuddled when you had a girlfriend. It wasn’t anything we ever discussed – hell, we rarely ever even mentioned the fact that cuddling was a thing we did rather frequently – but it seemed proper not to confuse things in that way. But inevitably the relationships all ended and I would return to your arms when you’d call out.
John’s eyes shoot open in embarrassment at having been caught, his hand pulling from himself quickly in reflex, “Sherlock…shit, sorry.”
“Watson!” Holmes yells after him, not wanting to leave it there. He hears the door close loudly and whispers, “I’m sorry, John,” though no one is around to hear it.
“Oh please, you’re clean. You’re a doctor and a regular attendee at the sexual health clinic,” Sherlock scoffed before gesturing absently.
Sherlock bit his bottom lip as he huffed out a breath through his nose, trying desperately not to make any noise that would alert John to his presence. Sherlock notoriously disregarded social niceties, but that doesn’t mean he wasn’t aware that this whole situation was a bit Not Good.
Nodding in agreement, Sherlock lets his hands fall to John’s hipbones, holding tight over the denim of John’s jeans. This can’t possibly be happening. This is a dream.
“I suggest you leave my flat right now, before I shoot you in the face,” Lestrade warned.
“I don’t bloody know!” Sherlock practically shouted, “It’s impossible.”
of the conversations we have could fall into that category,” Sherlock smirked in return, causing John to laugh and Sherlock to smile in relief.
John is Sherlock’s only friend, not only because Sherlock tends to rub people the wrong way by making observations about them that they’d rather he wouldn’t, but because he strongly believes he only
Holmes’ stomach drops when he sees her, more confident than ever that Sherlock needs to abandon this idiotic plan.
“They’re not even showing the wedding?” Holmes asks.
“Still…” John trailed off and then shrugged, “So…did you learn much?”
“Not a very sympathetic depiction,” Watson says with distaste.
other one?” Watson asks Holmes, “Do you…
“Oh for the love of god,” John mumbles under his breath with a blush, “at ease. For the millionth time: I’m not Abraham bloody Lincoln.”
The hansom ride was silent as Holmes and I sat with a respectful distance between us, Inspector Lestrade facing opposite and clearly trying not to appear as though he were uneasy. It has been my suspicion for some time now that the Inspector is aware of the true nature of mine and Holmes’ relationship, but he has had the good grace to neither mention it nor refuse to request our services. Much like our dear Mrs. Hudson assuredly knows the truth and has not kicked us out of the flat; in fact, she seems rather more pleased than at the start of our acquaintance as her smiles have only grown fonder throughout the years.
“Is the fire still lit under the cauldron?”
Watson, honestly,” he feigns haughtiness but his small smirk gives him away.
Over the years Sherlock welcomed him as an equal (mostly), was humble, pretended to die to protect him, stood next to him at his wedding to a woman Sherlock didn’t quite think was right, said the kindest words he’s probably ever spoken of another human being (in front of a crowd, no less!), shot a man, helped him figure out what was going on with his wife, and proclaimed his love when he didn’t think John was listening.
Watson desperately wants to point out how nice it would have been for Holmes to remember that before
There’s a flashback to Sherlock telling David that he needs to limit his interactions with Mary from now on so that he’s not a threat to John or his happiness. You know, like all good friends do when their best friend gets married. Right.
“Not like this,” he says quietly, his eyes portraying his sadness and apology. He hopes Sherlock can see that it isn’t a refusal of the feelings, just the circumstance that he’s placed them in.
“It’s from a musical,” he warns as he thumbs through his phone trying to find it, “not a great one; this is really the only song I like from it. It spoke to me.”
“Yeah. Until I discovered that contact shuts you up. Kind of wish it would do that again, honestly. Sherlock, I’m so tired.”
And now you ask me if I ever think about it? You? Us?
Sometime later, John wakes to the sound of his name being shouted, along with other sounds that don’t quite seem to form real words. He rushes downstairs to find Sherlock still on the sofa. The younger man is slouched awkwardly and is obviously in the fit of a nightmare.
“You were a little boy! You didn't know anything of that life…well...except what Mycroft was found doing. But I don't even think you understood it. You were so innocent,” Mrs. Holmes said, stroking a hand through Sherlock's curls, her eyes going soft.
They silently turn back to the men on screen. Sherlock moves from a kneeling position on the floor to sitting in one of the seats. John stands a ways off, fighting with himself as he grabs on to the support poles. Sherlock apologizes for ruining his future with Mary and begs John to forgive him for everything. John is angry until he sees that Sherlock is holding back tears.
She continues on, telling a story about her own best friend and chief bridesmaid who left the wedding early and how they never really saw each other after that. Sherlock appears agitated by the story and demands - quite firmly by the end - that she acquire him some biscuits. She leaves and Sherlock spends some time looking at John’s armchair with a saddened, contemplative look on this face before moving to his room to change.
Sherlock and Molly head to a case in the basement of a building where a skeleton sits at a desk. It turns out to be nothing more than an old display setup of Jack the Ripper, but throughout it, Sherlock keeps hearing John’s voice in his head and he responds aloud.
Holmes performs a small, genuine smile of gratitude before looking back to the telly.
Sherlock and John head down the stairs to talk to the press.
“Tedious,” Holmes intones tiredly once his brother is gone, letting go of Watson’s hand and slouching back in to the couch. He lolls his head to the right to look at Watson’s face, brow furrowing as he sees the excitement in his unfocused eyes. He sighs wearily, “No, Watson.”
“Can’t believe you got lost!” One shouts while slapping another on the arm.
“So you wanted to create a love potion that what? Makes you realize and face the one you love instead of letting you falsely love just anyone?”
“Are you always this vocal?”
girlfriends,” Watson says with true relief.

Flash to John and Mrs. Hudson in a cab, heading to the graveyard. They talk near the grave about how angry they both are at him (
“Well he
certainly different,” Holmes points out, chest aching for Sherlock, knowing how foolish Sherlock's feelings for John seem with this new information brought to light.
As Holmes was leading us away from the crime scene, Inspector Lestrade called to him, “Mr. Holmes?”
“Alright, John?” Sherlock feigns calm while in his chest his heart is racing. John is too tired to completely comprehend the fear in Sherlock’s eyes, “You were talking in your sleep.”
It starts in abruptly, John talking to his therapist.
“Please,” he asks quieter, desperate.
Watson falls gracelessly on to the couch, slouching in bewilderment and unable to wrap his brain around this situation.
John eyes him suspiciously for a moment but is too tired to keep it up. They had been on this last case for three days with hardly any sleep at all and he is
the way you do; all I can tell you is that, having seen John in action plenty during our service, you haven’t been counted out the way you think you have.”
They watch Sherlock spruce up the apartment after John makes an off-handed comment about the clutter. They watch Sherlock celebrate another murder – not an uncommon thing for Holmes to do – before waltzing out the door.
“Alright, but if it’s stalker footage, then why are these clients and random people who aren’t Sherlock and John so prevalent?” Watson asks.
“Thank you,” Holmes smiles.

“He’s been taken care of,” she sneers.
“Uuunng!” Sherlock moaned, hips rising of their own accord at the feeling, his eyes closed against the pleasure.
“I should have known it then,” Holmes berates himself.
John flounders for just a moment, “No, I didn’t actually
“Zach said that, in your army days, you would set your sights on a man and all others would disappear.”
“It’s about
too, trust me,” John chuckled, “but our first time like this, I want to take it slow; show you how much I love you.”
John and Greg precede Sherlock out of the building and they discuss the detective’s possible Asperger’s before Greg disappears to talk to the local force. John questions Sherlock about how what he saw compares to a normal dog a couple might own, and Sherlock admits that it couldn’t have been the same thing. They need to get back in to Baskerville.
“How much do I owe you for the food I ordered and didn’t eat?” John asks, suddenly remembering that he had come here on a date with someone else.
“But,” John cleared his throat, “I think I’d rather just...cuddle for now.”
“I’ve met them now, and they are remarkable people,” Watson negates before goading him, “and I think you’re smart enough to know that.”
As soon as John’s hands trailed away from his own again, Sherlock let out a deep breath through his nose and raised his hands to cup John’s face so he could kiss him hard. John moaned deep in his throat at the contact, raising his hands again to grab at the lankier man’s sides without thought.
They both watch as Mycroft claims his one undercover job as being arduous, tedious, and in honor of praise. Sherlock’s face speaks volumes about how much he wants to point out all that he went through over those two years himself; how he knows how hard going undercover is, how noisy, how dangerous…but instead he holds his tongue.
“Please,” was all Sherlock could say in response.
?” Holmes asks, not entirely serious. Watson still flushes with affection at the knowledge that Holmes has memorized so many of the “ridiculous titles” he’s come up with throughout the years.
“Nice of you to care,” Watson smiles at him, knowing that caring has nothing to do with it.
“Watson,” he admonishes in a slightly embarrassed tone, causing the other man to slowly right himself.
“Truth or dare? Kings? Never have I ever? Spin the bottle?” He ends with what can only be classified as a good-natured leer. The scandalized look on Sherlock’s face makes the joke completely worth it, and John can’t help the laugh that escapes.
John smirks in triumph, his hands coming up to frame Sherlock’s face as he slowly moves his mouth yet closer. He stops when their lips just barely touch, a teasing caress that promises more but isn’t nearly enough, “I know you would,” he whispers before pulling back.
“No!” Sherlock dropped all pretense for a moment as he pulled strong enough for John to fall on top of him. As John smiled down at him affectionately, Sherlock couldn’t help but blush at his obviousness, “I mean,” he cleared his throat, loosening his hold as he nonchalantly ran his hands over John’s arms instead, “your company isn’t
Sherlock doesn’t register the words past the sound of his pounding heart in his own ears. He finally finds the wound and recognizes that the bullet merely grazed the skin on the inside of the calf, so while it is bleeding freely, it’s only a shallow wound that isn’t life-threatening.
“Absolutely, Mrs. Hudson; thank you,” Watson says, feeling embarrassed by what she’s seen.
“Mycroft...I can’t just...you can’t expect me to take the matter into my own hand, so to speak,” he said in regret. The guilt was returning to his gut, but there are lines that simply should

does – but simply makes little puffing sounds every fifth breath, and he’s bound to drool on his pillow.
Sherlock shakes his head with a flirtatious smile as he kneels next to John, “The loo is freezing, you’d just torture yourself,” he reasons before leaning down to kiss John sweetly, “I don’t mind, just tell me what you need.”
Mycroft, Mary, and the bodyguard walk away, leaving the two standing awkwardly, unsure what to say to each other. Sherlock tells John his entire name, incase John is looking for baby names. John swears they’re not naming their baby girl after him.
“Eight people now,” Holmes informs the other man, “nine if you count Mortimer who clearly thinks it after what he’s just said.”
“Yes. I rather like that; maybe our Mrs. Hudson would let me switch to that nickname,” Holmes smiles.

“Yes. That,” Sherlock agreed, dropping his now throbbing, red-tipped and leaking cock against his stomach with a wet thunk, “So,

looks with a tinge of disappointment at his stupidity, “Like I don’t know what turns you on,” he scoffed.
die at John’s wedding, but it’s perfectly fine to make him watch you fake your own death, eh Sherlock?” Holmes chimes in sarcastically.
Holmes sighs, “Of course I have.”
All John had wanted to do when Sherlock returned from the dead was to never let him leave his sight ever again. But Sherlock caught him at an awkward moment that - while not a completed marriage proposal - could not be undone and John was angry at him for leaving and John had grieved for so long and…
John easily reads the challenge in Sherlock’s eyes because, even inebriated as he is, he’s very good at reading other people’s emotions. He’s also very good at reading
I had no idea I could allow myself to feel this much regret.
“You forgot to get the post,” John grumbled, putting the letters on his chair whilst he moved to make himself tea, subconsciously moving to make Sherlock one, too.
The look on John’s face when he sees the ring is beyond words. The look is an actual feeling inside both Holmes and Watson’s chests instead. It’s crushing.
the game anymore, is it?”
Only two more chapters to go... we wouldn't possibly tease you by drawing out the lure of smut would we?
?” Sherlock chokes out, heart rate speeding up of its own volition.
He growls as he claims Sherlock’s lips again, this time hungry, insistent,
“Of course I am, but…” he trails off uncertainly.
“A Chinese circus? That’s just ridiculous!” Holmes sounds almost offended at the idea.
Sherlock thinks he has Moriarty outsmarted, that if he can find that key code and erase Brook that he need not die at all. So Moriarty shoots himself in the head, leaving Sherlock no option but to jump so that the criminal’s remaining allies didn’t shoot John, Greg, or Mrs. Hudson.
“You’re the one who wanted to drink scotch to warm up,” John reminds him.
“Well, John is definitely more physical than you are; he sure is hitting Sherlock
“That’s all?” He asks with a hint of a challenge.
“I feel as though those could be your famous last words,” Holmes teases.
Sherlock moaned again as his back pressed against the wall, his hands finding John’s hair as the older man’s head grew lower with each passing button. Only when John reached the top of Sherlock’s trousers did he speak again.
And now you have a baby and any hopes I ever had of feeling your arms wrapped around me, your chest pressed to my back once more, are shattered.
“That would soothe you?” He asks with genuine curiosity.
“God, the way he’s put this whole thing together is almost masterful if it weren’t so twisted,” Watson admires begrudgingly of the “show”.
Sherlock then attempts to bring John in on the terrorist case he’s been assigned by Mycroft, but John is still a bit too salty to agree straight away. One more bout of Sherlock’s arrogance earns him a headbutt to the nose.
“We’re not together,” Sherlock says calmly with a shake of his head, the words seeming to burn John as he finally removes his hand from Sherlock’s leg.
“I’m sorry, that was poor timing on my part,” Sherlock apologizes.
Sherlock is pacing the apartment carrying the harpoon now sans blood. He is on edge from no cases and no nicotine, but John is doing a remarkably good job of ignoring him. Sherlock starts throwing things around looking for his cigarettes, stooping so low as to even beg John to allow him just one.
“You hum when you think I can’t hear you,” Watson insists, which is true.
“Yeah, mine too,” he agrees.
“Are you quite certain?” He challenges him.
“Jesus,” John mutters while rubbing his tired face with his left hand, but neither says anything more. It takes a full two minutes before John nods his head in resignation and turns towards the stairs to his room.
Please take a second to let us know what you think, via comment or kudos! We love to hear from you all :)
“Good,” Sherlock said around John’s shaft, seemingly talking to himself as he began to stroke the bottom of John’s prick in time with his mouth. He was doing well,
Watson holds it together for a solid three seconds before he begins laughing heartily.
“Yes, but…”
John kisses the freckle on the ear before pulling the entire lobe in to his mouth, teasing it with his tongue and teeth. Sherlock moans and tilts his head slightly to the left, allowing John more access and subconsciously directing him down towards his neck.
John raises his eyes, the apology only lasting a moment before they turn dark with want again. He lowers himself yet further, kissing the freckle to the far right of his belly button, just above the hollow of his hip. It’s the closest one to Sherlock’s cock, and by far the most alone-looking without any fellows within a foot of it.
It’s been a long while since they’ve had a case of real interest and excitement – of the “chasing criminals through the streets and staying one step ahead of danger” variety. The thrill of those cases always keeps the nightmares at bay, because his mind doesn’t need to relive the war to remember the adventure.
“Not your brightest moment, Watson.”
Sherlock hummed and held John steady as he began to lick and caress the tip of John’s cock with his tongue, drawing shapes and symbols onto the frenulum which sent John’s body into overdrive as he arched his hips and moaned.
Sherlock blushes, “Right,” he agrees, “because you’re a doctor, and that takes a very skilled mind to…”
Watson laughs, knowing that feeling all too well. It would appear that all John Watsons avoid playing Cluedo with their Sherlock Holmes with the same veracity with which most other humans avoid playing Monopoly with their family. The game always lasts far too long and is infuriating.
“Stop talking, John,” Sherlock responds and goes in for another kiss which rapidly turns heated with a deep moan and a touch of John’s hands up and down Sherlock’s torso. Although still dressed, the touch is almost too much and Sherlock stumbles in his kissing, his body shivering and trembling.
“I didn’t know he was gay,” John said, frowning and wondering why Greg had never mentioned it on their various drinking and moaning meetings.
John is silent as he gathers his courage to vocalize a question he’s not entirely certain he wants an answer to, “What the hell do you
“Make one more move and I will shoot you where you stand, I swear to God,” the threat comes from behind her in a dangerously low tone that Sherlock knows so very well.
tone.
“What if it alters the future?” He asks and then blushes at how idiotic it sounds.
“John?” he asks quietly again.
John can’t help the chuckle that escapes before he agrees, “Yeah, it does, genius.”
John raves once more about how all he would have needed was one word to know that Sherlock was alive and he would have been okay with everything. Sherlock asks him to promise he won’t tell anyone he’s alive yet, and even amidst their yelling fight John promises without a second thought. Because it’s what they do: protect each other.
“She doesn’t quite know him as well as she thinks she does,” Holmes agrees, “She’s close but…there’s too many generalities and assumptions.”
“Look, you two are good together. But, if you’re not interested in him, I’m more than happy to give you an alternative option,” he flirts with a wink at the end before picking up two of the glasses and walking back to the table.
Sherlock finally looks at the other person in the room - who he had assumed to be Lestrade - only to meet the cold eyes of John. He has a gash on his right temple that appears to have finished most of its bleeding, a bruise forming near his left eye, and a split bottom lip.
My heart leapt at the endearment and I knew that I could not continue living like this, ever wondering if there was maybe something more between us than friendship.
“Ditto,” Holmes says, because he sees the direction this is going.
“What is ‘Kings’ and ‘Never have I ever’?”
“Your what?” John grinned, almost forgetting the anxiety in the pit of his stomach.
“John,” Sherlock whispered in that way that the doctor had never heard his name uttered by a single other soul before him; equal parts reverent and awed with a dash of timidity, “are you always this romantic with your partners?”
With a heavy sigh of his own, he finally turned onto his back and stared at the ceiling, remembering Professor Ellis. The older man’s kindness was all that got Sherlock through that blasted school, honestly, and now he was retiring?
Drugged Sherlock is back in the motorist crime scene with Irene as she walks through how it must have happened. Then Sherlock appears to be transported back to his bed where, of course, he’s actually been the entire time since she broke in to his room at the flat.
“He was trying so hard to give John the clues he needed to piece it together himself, so he wouldn’t need to spell out every last detail and hurt him,” Holmes marvels at his counter-part’s sentimentality.
I (Goddess) would like to take most of the responsibility for this taking absolutely forever to update. It's a very weird, busy, stressful time of year for me in real life, but it's finally settling down again. One million apologies from us both <3
Sherlock explains that hound may be an acronym instead of one word before he spots Greg in the pub. Greg pretends to be on holiday, though he’s clearly just come back from one.
“Get every little detail right?”
Watson laughs and Holmes looks at him crossly, “It’s not
“You two get married and not tell me about it?” Lestrade jokes, looking at the screen which has Sherlock and John centered in matching outfits, Mary and Janine on either side.
come in my lap and kiss me all within the last five minutes.”
“I still can’t believe you didn’t let me meet your parents while they were here,” Watson admonishes.
Sherlock looked up at John, shaking his head and then inhaling, “I was an odd child. My parents were -- well, you’ve met them. They’re good people, but we were isolated in the family estate. For the first years of my life I was home-schooled by my private tutor along with Mycroft. We learned Latin and Greek and we were allowed to follow our passions. Mine was science, Mycroft’s was law and politics, but once we reached the age of 11, our parents insisted that we attend a local school. Obviously it was private, expensive in fees, but good for education and social standing.”
“I feel like I might vomit,” Sherlock gagged, “Lestrade is allowing himself to be – defiled by my oaf of a brother. I thought he had sense…I thought he at least had
John closes his eyes and shakes his head, “I can’t do this,” he mutters before turning on to his right side, his back facing the other man, and attempting to just end the day.
And then he kissed me.
“Yes, I’m here.”
Watson chuckles once, looking at the floor with a small smile, “No. She thought you were certifiably insane, and me for following you, but she believed in you.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Watson asks, offended.
!” He chuckles slightly before expanding on the thought, “The fact that you liked what I was doing so much that you couldn’t control yourself? I have to say, it’s doing some great things for my ego at the moment. And I meant it, Sherlock: it’s bloody sexy.”
,” he spat out, more angry at himself and his lack of control than anything.
, for fuck’s sake.
Sherlock shrugs nonchalantly, “Nightmare must have taken more out of me than I originally figured,” he lies, hoping that John’s empathy will drop the conversation now that the nightmares have been brought up again. John notoriously avoids the subject, possibly worried that it will cause one to occur.
“I do!” Sherlock insisted, his hands scrambling to reach for John to pull him closer so he could hide his blushing face in the crook of John’s neck, “I just…what I mean is…it’s never...not before. Like this.”
“In a sheet.”
was a mistake. It’s a really long, complicated story, but I thought I had lost Sherlock forever. There was no more him, and I worried there would be no more me if I didn’t try to move on,” he admits quietly, looking up shyly at David. Most soldiers, he guesses, go through a phase of being worried they may not be able to go on, so he knows David gets it.
Sherlock moans loudly, having always been appreciative of light dirty talk. Too much is…well…too much, but small statements like that encourage Sherlock that he’s making John feel good, which is all he strives for.
“I...John...oh!” Sherlock shouted, ejaculating forcefully and without much warning.
Holmes rolls his eyes instead of answering, returning to the couch in a bit of a huff. Watson follows, stepping sideways between the coffee table and the other man’s obnoxiously long legs to reclaim his seat to Holmes’ right. They push play.
“Good God, is
John subconsciously wraps his arms securely around Sherlock and smiles as he finally,
By the time John enters his friend’s room, Sherlock is under the covers on the side furthest from the door, messing around on his phone. Sherlock pretends not to take notice of the other man joining him on the bed, and John tries not to blush at the odd feeling of domesticity.
“Ah, yes,” Holmes says quietly, not looking at him. Watson tells himself that he imagines the sad lilt to the response.
“Come on,” he says gently, pushing Sherlock from him slightly, “make a quick trip to the loo, put the few remaining burnables on the fire, and then come back,” he walks him through the process only because he can tell that Sherlock is still a bit offline, “Yeah?”
With a purse of his lips and a thick swallow down a surprisingly dry throat, he turns back to the letter he wrote in anger and is surprised to realize that he can barely read the words, as messy as they are from emotion.
you bastard.”
He lifts his head on a deep inhalation and naturally holds himself in straight-backed soldier stance, though still seated. He looks around the room at the boxes, and his curiosity nags at him. There’s so much he knows about Sherlock - how he likes his tea, which dressing gown means which mood, which book holds a picture of his family from when he was young - but there’s an entire history that Sherlock had hidden from him. A past he knows nothing about…so
Sherlock and Molly leave the client’s flat and part ways with the agreement that such a day will not happen again. Watson wants to add that it won’t happen again because Sherlock has John and doesn’t need Molly, in any way whatsoever, but tamps it down because of how jealous it sounds.
Sherlock clenched his hands before tentatively climbing onto the bed, head on the pillows as he rested against John’s warm side, turning to kiss him gently. He noticed that his hands were shaking, his heart pounding in his ears, and he momentarily thought he might faint or throw up. Neither of which would be conductive to a good first time.
Greg shouts
turn this in to an experiment right now. Just…
“You will make an excellent medi-wizard with your ability to be so coherent immediately after waking.”
Watson merely moves his head and arm towards him so he can see the front as he finishes reading the back.
“So, at the risk of being essentially turned down once more, I’m going to ask again,” Sherlock starts nervously, but allowing John to see the sincerity in his eyes, “John Hamish Watson, will you accept this ridiculous life we lead over all others and marry me?”
John is in Mycroft’s office, learning all the details of the case Sherlock has sweet-talked him in to taking with one small compliment about being his best man.
“Doesn’t quite fit,” Holmes negates, still smiling.
“She implied that you were dead,” Sherlock whispers without moving.
John fidgets and surprises Sherlock with his next go, “Never have I ever kissed a man.”
he?” Holmes whispers when Lestrade is across the room grabbing a chair.
John stands from the floor, journal still firmly in his left hand, and walks to Sherlock’s bed. His heart aches with pure affection for this man who has gone through so much for John, all while allowing people to refer to him as a high-functioning sociopath. He still has no idea why Sherlock is the way he is - if he was born this way or someone made him this way - but he loves him all the same.
“Fuck me,” John breathed, looking out of the window at the large stately home, “Is this your house?”
The first couple of lessons, I lead so that you can learn the pattern, and I relish in being able to pull you close to my body with my arm wrapped around your waist, your hand clasped in mine. But I almost prefer when you lead, because you pull me close like you desire me and lead with such a commanding presence that shouldn’t really surprise me as I allow myself to exist only now, within these moments that feel so right.
“No you weren't; you were drowning it out with your caterwauling,” Sherlock grumbled as he took his seat at the table and sipped his coffee.
“Should we watch the last disc then?” Sherlock asks instead, ready to delete this entire day from his memory. The hope he had felt upon leaving his room has once again been replaced by fear and doubt.
They continue to search for the discs but are unsuccessful, and they begrudgingly head to their berating half an hour later.
They start the next episode:
Sherlock is pretending to kidnap John so that the police let them go.
“Ten people,” Holmes tells him with a smile.
As they walk the block to the designated pub, coats pulled close around them to combat the chill, John is clearly nervous and Sherlock is uncharacteristically quiet. When they walk in, John looks around and spots Bill sitting at a table by himself, looking down at his phone with a beer in front of him.
With a few playful nips at John’s lips, Sherlock shifted to remove John’s vest and sweater. The younger man, however, possesses nowhere near the amount of patience the doctor has at the best of times, much less in a moment such as this. Compared to John’s gentle, slow movements, Sherlock was downright chaotic and rushed. John smiled affectionately at his enthusiasm.
“No, of course not,” he looks towards the side of Holmes’ face, “but in the future.”
“I’m sure Mrs. Badcrumble would be offended,” Watson jokes.
The next day, as Sherlock reviews the footage, he’s a bit surprised by what he finds. Physically they stayed close, even doing what most would classify as “cuddling”, but it’s the talking that catches him off guard. John had of course mentioned that he talks in his sleep at times, but Sherlock was unaware that
the best use of our combined body heat, to trap it in a small space,” he agrees logically, slowly crawling towards John’s make-shift burrito blanket.
While Sherlock moans in disappointment, John is already moving his face to the right side of Sherlock’s neck, his hands falling away again.
Back to Sally where she’s explaining to Greg exactly how she’s believing the story that Moriarty is weaving (without realizing it herself). Greg doesn’t seem convinced because, like John, he knows that Sherlock may be socially inept, but he doesn’t have it in him to commit the crimes he solves.
“An Einstein theory is
“Probably an actor obtained for the shoot.”
“Whatever it is, nothing
Sherlock allows himself to be drawn in with a shy, besotted grin. He’ll argue about the idiot comment tomorrow.
“Oh God,” Watson breathes.
I can honestly understand why you moved on – why you
John thinks the emotions being permitted to shine through means that the potion is hopefully wearing off. The pain in Sherlock’s voice leads John not to hesitate before standing and moving towards the bed. He stands at the side, looking down in the wane light to simply stare at his face for a moment. It’s heartbreaking and he fears he may be losing him.
He calmly picks up the pen and turns the page, starting over.
“What?”
John pulls back with a wide smile and runs his right hand through Sherlock’s hair tenderly. The look in his eyes says it all without words: he’s more than pleased with the entire situation, but they’re both too tired to do anything about it tonight. Sherlock moves his body closer to John’s and arranges them in a most pleasant fashion.
“Magnussen,” Holmes whispers with distaste.
“What do you mean you have
Just then another woman approaches the pair to talk to John.
Watson shakes his head and placates him, “No need to have guessed it. What kind of cock-sure maniac
“Because secretly you want to be,” Watson replies.
So you have to understand that when I came back and realized how stupidly optimistic I had been in all of that – to have found you engaged to some fucking
John moves to the bar with a roll of his eyes as Sherlock and Bill move to sit. It’s a long rectangular table with three chairs on each side, and Sherlock follows Bill’s precedence by placing his coat on top of the table beside theirs. Bill reclaims his seat on the end closest to the door, Sherlock directly across from him, and when John returns with their drinks, he sits directly to Sherlock’s right.
“John, please,” he begs again, more adamant this time as his cock aches to be touched again.
“John, it's been twenty years. He's probably forgotten all about it,” Sherlock grumbled, refusing to meet John's eyes.
Holmes pulls away just enough to separate their mouths, foreheads resting against each other’s, and whispers, “No, no more running. Not unless you’re following.”
“Yes.”
“Well, I say we watch them. Aren’t you intrigued?” Watson asks.
When the older man’s eyes begin to close again, Sherlock rushes to ask, “John? Can I ask you just one question?”
for an easy way to keep up with any new stories from me or just to chat; I'd love hear from you :)
We solve a murder, save a life, and I can almost believe things are normal again before I have to perform that fucking piece you made me write for you. I watch as you dance with her and imagine that we looked a hell of a lot more natural at it than that.
John finally looks at him -
They stand awkwardly, waiting for the other to reveal what was so enlightening, but they’re scared that somehow the message was different.
Raz leads them to the skate park. They wander nearby looking for clues; on walls, in the tube, and then finally John finds a large clue on a brick wall. It’s gone by the time John is able to bring Sherlock to it, and then Sherlock grabs John to help him remember the pattern, whatever good he thinks that will do. Then John pulls out his phone and shows him the picture he took.
Holmes shrugs, “Don’t know yet, but I get the feeling that I’m not going to like it.”
"I wouldn't say I prefer it - there's still no comparison for a new book smell and flipping the pages - but sometimes I want to read a thousand-page Stephen King novel without carrying all 1,000 pages around."
The comma, as every educated man such as Holmes and myself knows, is used as a breath of sorts for the reader. In this context, I was no longer the dearest of Watsons, but his dearest whose name is Watson.
Once done with that, Sherlock moves on to his speech, first broaching the topic of John asking him to be his best man. There’s a flashback as he describes it which shows Sherlock frozen, unable to properly process that he is John’s best friend.
“But how am I supposed to have accurate records for the experiments if we’re both asleep during it?”
“A little too much for having to remain quiet,” he admits, locking eyes with his friend who finally sees the tears in his eyes from holding his laughter in.
to undress John; to have the experience for the other man to call upon because those are the rules of this game, aren’t they?
“Sherlock,” John whispers, his eyes wide and the hairs on his skin standing up.
Sherlock is in the middle of rapidly deducing the mother/son pair to prove that he’s fine (the manic tone shatters his credibility on that matter more than a little) and then he’s uttering the words Holmes has been dreading hearing.
“Yes yes, fine,” Holmes concedes, hand waving dismissively as he returns his attention to the telly.
Holmes smirks, “No, not really,” he admits, “but it was preferable to that,” he gestures to the telly just as the camera pans back to them lying on the stairs of Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson comes out of her flat and is surprised to see them.
John is sitting at a table in the pub with Mortimer, trying to get her to talk about Henry; though, as a doctor himself, he knows there’s very little hope to learn anything from her due to doctor/patient confidentiality. They continue to talk and subtly flirt until Dr. Frankland appears out of nowhere and infers to Mortimer that Sherlock and John are dating.
Sherlock sighed, “John, before you begin having your tedious sexuality crisis, can you please help me with my protrusion?”
John sighs, “Sometimes I think he might, but then I remember that he doesn’t feel things that way and tell myself I imagined whatever it was.”
John’s head moves back a little in surprise, “Of course.”
“Are you alright if we remove our pants? I don’t think either of us would relish trying to get them off once everything has dried.”
After what feels like hours of Sherlock trying - and failing - to fall asleep, John turns on to his left side, now facing Sherlock. The other man was just in the process of debating if he should just call it a wash for the night and head to the living room to play his violin instead.
Holmes smirks, “’Simpler times’ may have been a better choice of wording.”
John’s arms wrap around him instinctively, protectively, “You haven’t ruined
to stick your nose back in where it didn’t belong,” she spits with disdain, stepping forward as he reflexively takes another back.
“You’re going to sleep four nights in a row?” He asks with a skeptical eyebrow raised, as this would be an unprecedented event.
Truth is, Holmes is feeling as though Sherlock is rather showing their matching hand regarding their feelings towards John Watson, and he’s not certain he wants

” as his right hand comes up to grasp the back of John’s head to hold him closer. His hips jerk reflexively upwards while his left hand presses John’s hips down, causing the older man to moan in to his neck as their cocks rub together through the fabric of their trousers. It’s not a spot with a freckle, but John doesn’t stray from it until he’s driven Sherlock mad with desire and has left a mark of his own on the milky expanse.
gay; at least,
His heart literally stutters in his chest and he feels a bit feint, “Why haven’t you told him?” he asks with his eyes closed.
Sherlock huffed out a breath and focussed what blood was left in his brain on speaking, “My penis has never been like this,” he said, gesturing to his crotch which was still rudely tented, “not for this length of time. I haven’t...touched myself for a long time. Many years.”
“Watson,” he greeted almost in relief.
Sherlock’s brow furrows in confusion. Why would John write a letter instead of texting or emailing? He thought that John was staying away by his own volition, but this letter makes it sound like it’s somehow out of his control.
over a dead body, that John realizes that Sherlock loves him the way that he has always loved Sherlock.
“Here,” Sherlock answered for him, scooching over to his left and leaving plenty of room for John on the right side of the bed. When John gave him an inquisitive look, Sherlock merely shrugged and explained, “It’s your prefered side of the bed.”
John smiles brightly and closes his eyes briefly while he allows himself to believe the words for the first time in his life. He opens them again, “I love you, too, Sherlock.”
it mean?” Holmes asks quietly.
Sherlock checks if John’s alright, Moriarty grants John permission to speak but he doesn’t. Perhaps as an act of defiance or merely not trusting his own voice, he simply locks eyes with Sherlock and nods.
John couldn’t help the moan at the mental picture of Sherlock, one day, using the knowledge he’s about to learn on John himself. He rushed to get some of the lube onto his left hand before moving it to his cock willingly, grasping hard as his elbow lightly brushed against Sherlock’s side for a fleeting moment.
Sherlock, Mycroft, and a bodyguard are standing beside a plane as a car pulls up. Mary and John get out of the vehicle, and Mary makes it to Sherlock first. She gives him a kiss on the cheek and promises to keep John in trouble.
With a heavy groan and a herculean effort, John was able to gently remove himself from inside and on top of Sherlock before settling onto his side and dragging the lanky man close again.
So here they both lay in the same double bed. Sherlock is actually asleep on his left side, his back towards John, since the case is solved. John, for his part, is lying on his back glaring angrily at the ceiling while his fists clench at his sides.
“How do they know this? How could they possibly…” He can’t finish the frightening thought, but Holmes picks it up.
“No,” Sherlock said grumpily, pulling the cover over his head.
Sherlock, John, Mary, Isaac, and Wiggins make their way to St. Bart’s so that Molly can perform a drug test on Sherlock to see if he really did partake in drug use. She slaps him when it’s proven that he has.
didn’t snore then. But, had he even slept during that case? John’s brain tries to think of the answer to that, but he can’t definitively say one way or the other, especially with Sherlock loudly snoring next to him, breaking his concentration every few seconds.
“Are you wearing jeans?” John asks before he can think about how it would sound: like he had been checking out Sherlock’s arse. Well, he
John accompanies Sherlock back to Baker Street from the tarmac while Mycroft escorts Mary back to their home to rest. John is of course concerned about Sherlock having overdosed himself, and Sherlock is of course ignoring that and remorselessly allowing his mind to move quickly through the evidence to discover his own next step in regards to the Moriarty conundrum.
Watson groans quietly as he places his right hand on his face and closes his eyes for a moment. Could John be any more obvious about his possessiveness of his best friend?
Watson smiles broadly as he replies, “I know.”
be a comforting revelation.”
“Is he alright?” Watson forgets his anger in an instant, concern taking over.
John shook his head, still smiling, and dropped his head to kiss Sherlock again, “Alright, git,” he whispered fondly, nudging their noses together briefly before moving to support himself above his body once more.
As mentioned at the beginning, this was a request fic, which I'm willing to entertain doing again. So if you've got an idea (or just a trope you really love that I haven't touched yet), feel free to message me or find me on Tumblr!
“I don’t…” Sherlock shakes his head shyly, “I want to...but I don’t know how,” he practically pleads for John to take pity on him and just instruct him on what to do without making him continuously admit how inexperienced he is. How no one has wanted to touch him or be touched
John spluttered, pulling back and glaring at Sherlock as come dripped from the tip of his nose and his chin, “Seriously, Sherlock?”
“Alright, let’s just assume that your Sci-Fi story is true,” Holmes says.
“Come on, let’s get you to the bed before your legs give out,” John ordered gently while assisting him.
Next thing they know, John leans too far forward in his chair and places his hand on Sherlock’s knee to lever himself back up. John looks at his hand for a moment before removing it and lifting it in a carefree motion.
to kill - anyone besides Bainbridge. It had been an interesting, exhaustive case that took them four days to solve, but they had managed it.
” John cried out, throwing his head back and freezing solid as he sprayed his stomach with pulses of pearly come.
The first page:
Mrs. Hudson interrupts the moment.
And then it hits Holmes why Sherlock wouldn’t be able to stay serious, and it makes his stomach drop while his heart aches in sympathy. Of course, Sherlock Holmes has never been very good when it comes to emotions of his own and now, not only has he been in near complete isolation for two years with no friendly human contact, but he’s returned to find that his only true friend has moved on with a woman that he plans to marry. He keeps putting himself out there for John to show that he is truly sorry, but he’s terrified of letting it go too far. He’s in love with John but doesn’t dare to let him see it. So he deflects with humor when their conversations become too deep, too close to the truth.
There’s no answer for it, so they simply watch in rapt trepidation, no words exchanged for many minutes.
The group of four arrives at the boarding school and immediately begin speaking to the House Mistress. Sherlock throws her shock blanket from her shoulders and demands to hear her story, then softens at the end of it and admits that he believes her, but he merely wanted her to speak quickly.
” Sherlock asks in shock as he pulls back from John, unwilling to believe that he hasn’t ruined everything after all.
Watching John’s rhythmic breathing was enough to lull him in to sleep last night, but he’s just not tired enough for it tonight. He huffs a breath in aggravation knowing that he is bound to lie there listlessly all night.
he thinks as he fills their glasses and begins the game, “I’ll start simple. Never have I ever stored a severed arm in the bread bin.”
love,” Sherlock corrects, “I just never thought I would experience it myself.”
well actually. The bloody genius. Of course it wouldn’t take long for him to master this.
“Are you ready?” John asked, cautiously pulling his hand away from Sherlock’s bum and wiping the lube onto the bedding as he stroked up and down Sherlock’s thighs, “You’re in charge; whatever you need.”
Mycroft is shown talking to some colleagues – members of the same council who questioned Magnussen at the beginning – and convinces them that sending Sherlock on the MI6 mission (which he had just recently asked him to refuse) would be the best course of action.
“Good God,” Holmes intones with distaste, “is John going to flirt with
John smiles widely at him before moving on to the right side of the church, “St. Illuminatus - the founder of the Illuminati conspiracy. Interesting that he holds such a place of high honor.”
jealous, though hiding it alright.
Sherlock bit his tongue to stop the moan which threatened to escape. The pleasure which he received from John’s praise had always been an intimate, almost physical, thrill. Feeling like he was pleasing John had softened him slightly when he dealt with victims' families, or when he showed off with his rapid-fire deductions.
To which John simply interlaced their fingers to lead them along, “I assure you it is not.”
instead
Holmes looks at Watson, remote in his hand, “This appears to be the last one. Are you ready?”
John’s unease and jealousy are practically palpable, and Watson isn’t doing much better while watching it. John attempts to play it cool and stay calm as he questions Sherlock about his girlfriend, but his eyes have always been obnoxiously easy to read, and this close up the act is impossible for either Holmes or Watson to miss. Sherlock keeps trying to talk to John about Magnussen and the case, but John is incapable of moving on from the girlfriend thing. Janine comes out, sits on Sherlock’s lap, and flirts with him before inviting John over for dinner and kissing him before leaving for work. The look on John’s face, when Sherlock can’t see him, says everything.
