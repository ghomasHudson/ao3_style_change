Castiel spat blood onto the pavement, "Sorry to ruin your ending, but it's our lives."
"What's wrong, Cas? I told you this story before. I just never told you how broken you were in it. I did that to you. Future me did it anyway. I kind of kept you at arm's length for a while because I was afraid I'd break you. But we made it past 2014, and you are still relatively you; not popping pills or having orgies."
They continued to reminisce about their childhood pranks while eating breakfast. After they were done, Castiel rinsed the dishes and put them in the dishwasher. As they were preparing to leave, Castiel asked, "Want to go to the farmer's market with me? I need to set up my booth there. Jack will join me after his movie is over. It will give you a chance to meet everyone. The Saturday morning farmer's market is the 'in' place to be."
Dean regretted taking the backroad back to their small town. He should have remained on the highway instead of driving through the twisty, dark, overgrown road. He wanted to show Castiel a favorite fishing spot where he and Sam used to go when they were young. With as dark as the night was, Castiel wouldn't be able to see it anyway.
Castiel responded, “I like you too, Dean.”
“This is a one-horse, crap town that will probably be buried under a housing development for the rich and almost famous in less than ten years. There’s nothing for you here, Dean. There’s no future. This isn’t the life for you. You need more.”
Dean huffed his way to his bedroom and returned with a vintage Princess Leia Star Wars toy in its original packaging and handed it to Charlie.
"Did we? Did I? We did all that?"
"Go ahead, Cas. I'll try to hold down the fort."
Castiel nuzzled his neck. "Yes, yes, it was."
"Hi, Benny. This is Dean Winchester. He's in town for a while," Castiel responded.
Dean stared intently into Castiel's eyes for several moments before saying, "You're a hell of a lot better roommate than Sam. You can cook. You clean the kitchen. We like the same shows. We can grade each other's students' papers if we run out of time. You're almost the perfect roommate except for…" Dean trailed off.
Dean hesitated before patting the nearest cow. "Hi there, Britney. Nice to meet your acquaintance. Who's Bowser?"
"If you ask around, I'm sure others can also share their stories about him with you. Everyone knew him. He always missed you, Dean. However, he wasn't alone. He had all of us, especially Cas. And speaking of the devil, there he is with Jack."
“Breathe, Cas. Breathe.” Castiel stared at him, panic rising in his eyes. Dean put his hand on his shoulder to steady him. “Cas, you are the best father I know. Those kids adore you. And I had a nanny that took me to all those soccer lessons and so many extracurricular activities that I barely had time to do my homework. Do you know what I really wanted?”
The pig looked up at him, and Dean could swear it smiled.
"Technically, we haven't yet."
"Everything ok, Cas?" Dean asked concerned.
"She was enthusiastic about your cooking skills earlier." Dean grinned.
After one final tug of his tie, he went into the living room. Castiel sat cross-legged on the couch watching Star Trek on the TV. Castiel smiled at him as he entered the room, "Hi, Dean."
"Would have been good information to have before now, Cas," Dean growled.
“You too, Dean.”
The man patted the cow fondly and said, "Thank you for the milk, Taylor. I both appreciate and love you."
Castiel shrugged, "You live, and you learn. In this case, I learned a hard financial lesson, as well as grew trust issues."
Castiel tilted his head, "Do I get a say in this?"
Dean smiled sadly, "I wish my dad would have let us keep in touch with him."
Dean responded, “You don’t just have two kids. You have however many cows, dogs, ponies, pigs, chickens, and geese you have around this place as kids.”
"What do you do for fun? You work and you go to night school. You haven't even been going to Charlie's game nights. She is getting really mad at you. I think she's going to come kick your ass soon."
When Dean got back to his house, he stiffened as he saw his father sitting on the Impala smoking a cigarette. John was uncharacteristically dressed in a leather jacket and boots instead of a suit. Dean walked out carefully into the yard and said, “Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?”
"Cas is an English teacher. He studies poetry and English literature. Flowers mean things. Lots of things. You give different plants to convey different things. Marigolds kind of mean depressing things. We don't want that." Charlie tapped her finger on her coffee cup lid.
"Just keep laughing it up, Sam. Maybe, I'll call Sarah and tell her how beautiful it is here and invite her for a visit. The Falcon Bay magic will work on her and she'll want to live here too. Lord knows you're so whipped that you'd live with her no matter where it was."
Dean protested, "I like flannel."
"I took advantage of you."
Amara repeated the process she did with Jack. When she was done, Castiel stood up gingerly as if he was checking himself to see if anything was broken. Amara said, "I healed you too. My work here is done. There will be no more apocalypses. I will not let Heaven or Hell intervene. I've seen the value of humanity. Goodbye, and thank you, Dean." Amara disappeared.
Dean looked at him blankly. When Castiel finished singing the song, Dean said, "I'm so lost." He wondered where this conversation had gone awry.
"But I'm your sap."
Dean smirked, "I still say it's oatmeal raisin, but whatever." He bit his lip to stop from laughing as Castiel sputtered in indignation. Castiel held a few things as absolute truth and would wax endlessly and poetically about his viewpoints. The viewpoints included his favorite Avenger (Wasp), his favorite Star Wars character (Leia), his favorite pizza (anything that didn't have pineapple on it, and his favorite cookie (the aforementioned snickerdoodles). Dean loved to poke at any of these to get Castiel started on a rant, just do he could see how hot Castiel got when he was passionate about something.
Castiel tilted his head, "Sam told me about your girlfriend, Lisa. He said you two were together for five years, so I assumed."
"I've angered God. Chuck may be deciding the be wrathful."
After they finished at the market, Dean and Castiel loaded the truck with the remaining wares. Jack chattered about Scooby-Doo while they drove home. After they unloaded the truck, Castiel asked, “Would you like to join us for dinner, Dean? I made spaghetti last night and just need to reheat it. It’s nothing fancy, but it’s filling.”
“That seems kind of hopeless.”
Dean barked out a laugh, "Ask Sam about Benny. I was with Benny for two years before he met Andrea. Love at first sight. I was hurt at first, then I realized she was his soul mate. I was the best man at their wedding."
Dean patted his shoulder, "I feel you, Cas. I'm in a slightly better spot because I teach an elective, so most of my students chose my class versus something else. I still get kids who want to drift by."
When he didn't find him in the house, he looked in the backyard. Castiel obviously had been busy working that morning because his garden was full of a variety of plants. He spied Castiel relaxing next to a basket on a blanket under the shade of an old oak tree in the yard.
Dean choked on his jerky. "Not for nothing, Cas, but last time someone called me their man, I got laid. So you might want to watch your wording there."
Dean looked impressed when he saw it. It was one of the books in a popular science-fiction series published by an indie publishing firm. Understanding dawned in his eyes, "You're C. Novak? It’s one of my favorite series."
"You got to promise me something too, Cas."
Dean frowned disturbed, “This place never changes.”
"You don't have to babysit me. You can go with Charlie. I can entertain myself."
Sam nodded in agreement. "The margins are really thin right now, Dean. I don't think the company can afford it."
"Well, we're both men," Castiel said softly. A loud crashing noise emanated from the house. Jack's voice called out, "It's good. I'm not hurt."
Understanding flashed across Dean's face. "You're trying to protect Jack, so he doesn't get in trouble. I get it. I have a younger brother too."
"Dean and his family are under my protection. He will always be under my protection. He understood me and brought me peace." Amara glared at Chuck. "I like this world. It has Kino, spas, and massages. Flowers. Music. It's my favorite."
"I got your back on this. But, Dean, don't do anything crazy."
Castiel nodded. “I understand.”
"How's sheriffing going, half-pint? Dean said gruffly.
"Go Team Free Will," Dean started the Impala and pulled her out on the road, "Cas, this is where
Castiel hissed, "Claire."
"Honeybees. The garage is on the other side of the beehives. They never sting Dad, but Jack and I aren't supposed to go into the hives without protective equipment. He doesn't use the car that often. We usually all fit in the truck."
Dean shook his head, "No, I had no clue. I wonder if anyone has been paying the taxes or if the place is even still standing." The last time Dean had seen his grandfather, he was ten. Dean was now approaching thirty-five.
He lost track of time, casting the line and then slowly reeling it back in. The repetition was relaxing. He was startled when he heard, “Hello, Dean.”
He pulled out his phone and called Sam, "Hey, Sammy. How's it going there?"
"Jess is a nice girl, but I think she's more Sam's type," Dean responded.
"I'm sor…" Castiel trailed off. "I didn't mean to."
Castiel responded smugly, "Nothing is too good for my man."
Castiel found Dean sitting relaxed against the tree on a hill to the bunker, looking up at the stars. Dean said, "Hi, Cas," without looking up. He knew who it was by the swishing of the trench coat and the sound of his footsteps, plus he could always feel grace emanating from Castiel whenever he came close. He never asked Sam if he felt it. Sam would overthink it and try to figure out what caused it. Dean preferred to think of it as his angel detection radar, but it only ever worked with Castiel.
"Stop it, asshole." Dean pulled out his angel blade.
Dean took a step toward him when Claire's voice broke in, "Umm, Dad. Not to interrupt, but you locked the door when you came out. Do you have the key, or do I need to knock and wake up Jack?" Claire looked at them both guiltily.
Dean bit his bottom lip. "Maybe."
“He was someone here too, Dad.”
Castiel smirked, "Who do you think I learned it from?"
"Thanks for sharing that, Jody. My dad hasn't mentioned Henry since he told me and Sam that he had died. We learned the hard way not to ask."
"He deserved it!! He told us to get the ducks out of the town’s fountains. We were kids. We tried to put them in the basket of our bikes, but they flew out. The next logical place was to put them in Adler’s truck. We figured he could just drop them wherever he pleased."
Dean watched Castiel's hand on his own. He stared at Castiel as he was trying to get a read on him. Castiel squinted and looked at him, tilting his head. Dean was vaguely aware of someone approaching the table but was startled when a woman hugged Castiel from behind.
"You don't need to dress fancy, Dean," Claire added. "just something like jeans and a shirt with a collar will do."
Dean said more emphatically, "I've been conned," as he wondered to himself just how Castiel would look in a fireman's uniform.
Dean sighed heavily. He walked into the kitchen. His brows furrowed when he saw a fresh loaf of bread and a bowl of fruit on the counter. He opened the fridge and found milk, cheese, butter, and eggs. He glanced in the pantry and saw a variety of staples neatly sorted on shelves. Either someone was living here unknown to Dean or someone had gotten it ready for him. He guessed the latter. He wondered if it was Ellen. She had been his babysitter all those years ago when Henry and Mary would visit the neighbors. She always fussed at Henry and brought him fresh produce and pies from her parent's business. The Harvelle's Roadhouse was the happening spot in town. Not that there was a lot of excitement in this town, but when there was, it usually happened at Harvelle's.
Charlie jumped up and down excitedly, "You found the Leia I was missing for my collection!" She smothered Dean's cheeks in kisses, and repeatedly said, "I love you," to him about a dozen times.
Jack nodded sagely, "Makes sense. I'll take Roberta for a walk." As Jack picked up the leash, Roberta let out a sigh and stood up slowly. She begrudgingly followed Jack, even though it was obvious she'd rather be taking a nap.
“Did he agree with the projected revenues? Promoting the books through different marketing avenues? Focusing on digital publishing?”
Sam said, "Well, should we go see Mom?"
Claire added, "We're both perfectly fine."
"Oh, you were asking why I hadn't closed the peanut butter lid."
"They aren't bad, Cas. I’m more a Zeppelin or Seger kind of guy, but that song is awesome."
"Dad, Claire called me twerp again," Jack whined beseechingly at his father.
"I never understood how he found Falcon Bay. He's from Kansas. He started the publishing firm in Kansas City and moved it to LA in the '60s. And then he left LA to come here, in the middle of nowhere, from my dad's perspective. Dad won't talk about it."
Castiel sighed and called out warmly, "Hello, Sam," as he snapped his fingers, changing Sam and Dean's clothes as requested.
Charlie added, "I concur."
Dean's mind derailed at the possibilities of sleeping together, but he quickly reined in back in. As he put the tools away in the trunk again, he thought of every gross thing he could think of to calm down the twitch in his pants... The eighth-grade teacher with the really horrible breath -- Zachary should not be a teacher in this or any other reality. The time Sam dog Bones ate a frisbee and threw up for two days. When he opened the car to get back in the car, he realized that Castiel had made two nests out of blankets -- one in the front seat, and the other in the back.
He stretched and stood up. The trench coats and suits were long gone; now his uniform was jeans, no shoes, and a Led Zeppelin t-shirt. He wandered to the kitchen and placed the photo album on the kitchen table before grabbing a peach from a bowl of fruit. As he took a bite, the overly ripe peach sprayed juice down his chin. He turned as he heard Dean enter the house. Dean's hands were covered in streaks of grease, his work pants stained in oil, but he never looked happier. Spotting the juice on Castiel's chin, he leaned over and licked it off. Castiel looked offended, "I’m not sure if that was supposed to be disgusting or sexy."
Sam slid into the passenger side as Dean restarted the car. Sam asked curiously, "This isn't your happy ending?"
Castiel put his hand on Dean's left shoulder, "I need you to promise something, Dean. I need you to promise me this."
“Well, that’s good news then, right?” Castiel asked woodenly. “You’ll get what you wanted.”
"Yeah. Dad expected us to follow him in the business, but I think there's something else I'd rather do."
"I care a lot for you, Cas. I'm not sure you know how much."
"I have to load the truck, but I don't want to impose on your time."
"It's risky," Sam replied.
"You are the first person in my entire life that called  me calm. Gabe's name for me is whirlwind. Jimmy tells me he got all the brains, and I have all the energy."
Dean ignored him and approached the water. He said quietly, "Cas, get your feathery ass over here. We got some unfinished business."
Castiel raised an eyebrow, "Yes?"
Castiel tilted his head. Again, the words seemed familiar. "Dean, I don't… something is going on."
"We're bickering like an old married couple. It's good to have you back, Cas." Dean ruffled Cas' hair. "You were gone too damn long."
Dean took of a bite of the peach Castiel was still holding. "Both?"
Dean nodded and said, "Thanks for the invitation. See you in a bit then, Cas." He walked a wide circle around the Colonel but made it safely back to his own house. He took a quick shower and dressed in faded jeans and a well-worn green plaid shirt.
Dean put the lid firmly on the peanut butter and dropped it on the blanket next to Castiel. He clenched and unclenched his fists. "I asked for one little thing."
Sam waved happily to Castiel, "It's good to see you, man."
Castiel smiled at Dean widely, "Ok, ask me anything. Let's catch you up on Castiel 101."
Dean turned to see Castiel walking towards him. As soon as Dean caught his eye, Castiel face's transformed into a wide smile. As he approached, he called out, "Hello, Dean." He stopped in front of Jody and kissed her cheek, "Claire and Kaia are off on an adventure. God knows what trouble they'll get into this time."
"Nope. You're still the guy who leaves the lid of the peanut butter."
“Look, Dean. Don’t make any snap decisions. Think it through.”
He stared at Dean with a terrified expression, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I should go. I can get Jack and leave."
A few minutes later, Castiel called from the fence, “Are you ok, Dean? I heard yelling. I don’t mean to intrude.”
Dean looked over his shoulder at Castiel, “Hey, Cas. How’d you find me?”
Dean replied defensively, “I wasn’t worried. He didn’t have to leave me anything. I don’t deserve anything. I wasn’t here for him.”
He said in a friendly voice, "Yep. Nice to meet you. You can call me Dean."
"I hope that's ok, Cas. I was careful not to let him get hurt."
Castiel arched an eyebrow, "Twenty cents and that's my final offer."
Jack exclaimed, "Aunt Charlie!!!"
"Not yet."
"No, you and I have always and will always share a much more profound bound." Castiel eased away from Dean and stood up. "You should get some sleep. We don't know what happens next. We need to be vigilant."
"I have no regrets about rebelling. I much rather be down here with you than with the angels. Humans are much more likable. I obviously wish I made better choices on the journey about who I should trust." Castiel met Dean's eyes and they stared at each other for several minutes.
"Claire named her when she was four. She wanted to name her Bobby after Bobby Singer, but Bobby wasn't so hip on that. So, we named her Roberta. Claire calls her Bobby when Bobby's here just to annoy him. She excels at trolling people."
Dean glared at Sam, "Don't always believe what you hear."
“I got kind of tired of kids picking on me because of my freckles.”
Amara looked at Dean. "That was a mistake on my part. No, Brother. Once you locked me away for destroying your playthings, now I'm going to lock you away, so you don't destroy them." Chuck levitated in the air, struggling. Their eyes met and it was apparent that there was a battle of wills going on between the two. After a moment, the mark on Amara started to glow. Chuck screamed as the mark transferred to him. After a moment, Chuck disappeared.
"Yeah. We went every summer there with Mom. You probably don’t remember it very well. You were pretty young when…" Dean trailed off. The visits to see Henry Winchester stopped after their mother died in a fire. John had neither the time nor the inclination to take his sons to see his estranged father. Many of Dean's happiest memories as a kid were those summers, free of his father's expectations and free to be himself. "Can I see it?"
Dean whirled around to see Ellen heading in their direction. She had been sixteen when she had babysat him; she now would be pushing forty. Ellen said, "Well, look what the cat dragged in. How are you doing, Dean? Is Sam here?"
The DJ announced, "It's that time for the special dance of the evening. Grab your special someone and let's get started." Blake Shelton's song, 'Austin', started to play as the lights dimmed.
"You're an awesome brother, Dean."
A voice behind him said, "That's about how far she goes, boy. Now, it’s naptime."
Dean cleared his throat and broke the silence, "It's all water under the bridge. At least we got Jack back."
Castiel dropped the peach, grabbed Dean's arms, and tried to pull him close. Dean protested at first, "My clothes. You'll get dirty."
Dean protested, "Dude, this was on the best sellers list."
Dean snorted, "You all do know we are right here, while you are planning a wedding."
"No, no. It's fine. I just… I think Claire might be setting us up," Castiel smiled ruefully.
Sam looked at them, "It looks like you inherited Grandpa Henry's farm. Did Dad ever mention this?"
Castiel turned slightly red, "Amelia, don't freak him out. I haven't moved in yet."
Jess giggled, "At the rate you move, we'd be here 'til you were fifty if we don't plan it."
"Well, you told me never to change. But I did."
"No reason to be sorry. We'll get home. We don't have work tomorrow."
John flicked his cigarette to the ground, “Love what you’ve done to the place, Dean. It’s got a real Americana feel to it.” Although Dean had done considerable work cleaning up the place, the farmhouse still looked tired and worn. He imagined seeing it as his father currently was. From his dad’s point of view, the place was probably a complete shamble.
“I’ll talk to you later, Sam.” After Dean ended the call, he walked over to Castiel, “Sorry, that was Sam.”
Sam asked, "What do you think about it?"
Dean looked into the simmering pot. "Did you make the sauce from scratch?"
Charlie flung herself into Dean's arms. "I missed you, dork."
“Part of me, really, really, really regrets stopping.”
“If you had listened to Henry, he would have told you he was a horrible father. He set all the wrong examples. Dad, I’m not trying to hurt you. I’m just saying, I need something else.”
Castiel looked worriedly over his shoulder, “Doc thinks she’s just a little under the weather. She gave me some vitamins for her.”
They walked out of the restaurant to the Impala. Castiel took the passenger seat, while Dean slid in on his side. He said softly, "You ok, Cas?"
Castiel sighed. "Very well. I know when I'm outnumbered."
Dean looked at him skeptically. "If you say so."
"All forgiven?" Dean asked Charlie hopefully.
Jack smiled, "I'll taste Cookie Crunch again without my powers."
Dean waited for a moment and when Castiel didn't continue, he asked, "What was the last time, Cas?"
Dean strode over to him, "See something you want?"
"Cas, that won't work on me. Sam's should trademark that face."
Castiel looked at him alarmed, “Dean, your jacket!”
“He wasn’t. He was cremated and spread across the lake near your old fishing hole. You’d have known that if you had asked.”
"Yeah, well that's not going to change. You deserve much more than I have to give."
Dean smiled. "All of the animals are your dad’s favorite. Why didn’t you ask him for help?"
Dean was sleeping soundly when he was startled awake by a rooster crowing. Dean slipped out of bed and stumbled to his feet. He crossed the threadbare carpet to the window he had opened the previous night. He pulled on it several times until it slammed shut with a satisfying thud. He started to head back to his bed when he heard the dulcet tones of Olivia Newton-John singing outside:
Castiel shook his head in resignation and looked at Dean, "You sure you want to go with us? This is the tip of the iceberg of their shenanigans."
"I'll be there! Unless you prefer Cas instead."
Dean headed across the lawn perplexed. He thought that Castiel had been coming onto him the previous night. Maybe Castiel was embarrassed at his daughter trying to set him up with another man. Maybe he was misreading the previous night and Castiel was straight. That sure made having a crush on him that much harder.
Castiel laughed, "Is that the name kids are calling it now? Nice try, Amelia. But I'm just the consolation prize."
Dean and Castiel burst through the front door of their house, laughing and giggling. Dean has his arm slung around Castiel's shoulders. Castiel looked at Dean with shiny eyes. Dean threw back his head and laughed louder. Castiel looked at him, "What's so funny, Dean?"
Dean laughed nervously as he started to blush. "Ok. What's your favorite book?"
"If you got the credentials, talk to Donna. She's new here from Minnesota. But she fits in just dandy. She's the principal." Bobby suddenly yelled, "Ellen, come see the idgit!"
Dean looked confused at Castiel, “Did you and him…? Were you…?”
Jessica shrugged, “It’s just the way things are here, Dean.”
“Is there a bill in there for your services? You took care of everything for years.”
Dean said jokingly, “What was it you said the other night, Cas? Do you see something you like?”
Crowley gave Castiel a knowing look, “I always told myself that you weren’t exactly straight. I said, ‘Self, have you ever noticed how Castiel stares into your eyes. I think he likes you.’ Of course, I would then answer myself, ‘Well, Self, what isn’t there to love?' And now I see you with this handsome fellow, and I realize I missed my chance. Well, unless he’s amenable…”
Then, there was the offer his dad made. Dean put everything he had into the company. He was proud of the work he had done; it just wasn’t his passion. It was more like a puzzle to solve. If he’d never had come to Falcon Bay, he would have leaped at the chance to finally be able to drive the project the way that he wanted. But now, he just wasn’t sure. He needed to sort himself out.
Castiel looked up at the ceiling, "It's sometimes disappointing when you realize your students don't really care about being in your class. It's a requirement so they try to power or bluff their way through it. Finding a student who actually likes reading Sound and the Fury is a rare occurrence. I really think I'm just wasting my time most days, and I should stick to teaching them grammar instead of lit. But I have a reading list I have to cover."
"No, he's still living the high life in Los Angeles. I needed something else in my life."
"Come on, Dean. Don't be late," Sam Winchester said as he pulled his brother, Dean behind him through the crowds.
"I think that is because they thought it was funny too but had to appease Adler by grounding us. He's still around and is still a jerk."
Dean grinned, "I kind of bat for the other team, Ellen. Your daughter will always be safe with me."
"Amelia, meet Dean, I'm going to be his new roommate. Dean, this is Amelia, she's my twin brother, Jimmy's, fiancé." Castiel looked at Amelia fondly.
They ate in companionable silence for a few moments before Castiel said, "So, you now know I live on the farm here and I have two kids and an overabundance of animals. Did you have other questions?"
Castiel smiled at him wryly, "I was so full of righteousness I wanted to make a big entrance so you would be suitably impressed before I told you God had work for you to do. The sparks, the lights, the thunder, completely unnecessary. But since you couldn't hear my real voice without dying, I wanted to impress you in other ways."
Castiel hesitated for a split-second before retorting, "It's Sunday. This is my Sunday best."
Castiel looked into his eyes, "Will me being Clarence Nova change how you think about me?"
Dean mused about his day. "I found Cas. Remember that friend I had as a kid."
Charlie laughed. "I claim the role of best man."
"’We’ didn't say anything about names. You said. I'm so, so sorry Jack that I called you twerp. I should be terribly ashamed of myself," Claire said dramatically.
“You’ll never wear out your welcome. I love my kids, but there’s something to be said about spending some time with people my age.”
Dean replied, "Wish my dad had had that opinion."
Castiel looked like he wanted to argue the point but slowly nodded. As Castiel reheated the spaghetti, he said, “I’ve told you quite a bit about me, Dean. What’s your story? Why did you come here now?”
Dean hesitated, “I don’t know, Sam.”
Castiel tilted his head, squinted his eyes, and looked between them. "Sam's got you beat on the hair, Dean." He reached a hand up to ruffle Sam's hair. "I wish my hair would do that. Instead, I just get this mess." Castiel waved a hand to his hair.
Sam nodded, "They are like this after a week; imagine how they'll be after a year of living together."
“Not at all,” Castiel responded. “Life is too short, Dean, not to do something you enjoy.” Castiel looked away with a pained expression, “Jimmy had all these big plans to change this place into an orchard and vineyard. He talked to me about it at least once a week. He was close to breaking ground on the orchard when he was killed. And then, Kelly… Kelly left me too. Find your passion, Dean, whatever that is, and go for it.” He smiled at Dean sadly, “Nothing lasts forever.” Dean hugged him, pulling him close. Castiel melted into him. They stood there quietly for a few minutes before Castiel cleared his throat and stepped back and said, “Could you call Jack to dinner, please?”
"Did you just Han Solo me, Cas?"
As he approached his house, he blinked in confusion. Charlie's beat-up yellow Gremlin was parked in front of his house, as well as Jess's Toyota. He smiled. Even though he was dead tired, his red-headed geek friend was one of his best friends, and he hadn't seen her in months. Although he also realized that she was going to be extremely pissed off at him too. He parked his Impala and hurried to the door.
"We should have stayed retired instead of going werewolf hunting. I never really realized how much I kept you and Sam in good repair all those years."
Dean stared at the hand on his knee before answering, "Like I said, water under the bridge, Cas. You did your best. We all had to make terrible choices. What was it you once said? As long as you made mistakes for the right reasons, it's all that matters."
“Seriously, thirty-one?”
Dean smiled at Claire praising her father, "He'd probably say he's the lucky one."
"Purgatory would be ok. We could take on Eve and defeat her and the leviathan. Then, we could move into a nice cave. We could figure out how to make beer and barbeque critters." Dean snaked an arm around Castiel's waist, "We could live a relatively nice life in Monsterville."
As they started to dance next to each other, Dean leaned over and whispered, "We can sneak out after this song if you want. Claire's got a real talent for putting you on the spot."
Castiel turned his attention back to stargazing, "I wouldn't change a thing. You, Sam, Jack, and Mary are my family. I love all of you. Well, I would have avoided Jack losing his soul if I could."
"I love you, Dean."
Taking care of the Impala over the years had made him more than a passable mechanic.  Gordon had asked him why he didn't just take the car to shop, but Dean enjoyed working on it and getting his hands dirty. He lost himself working happily on the truck.
Castiel leaned towards him pressing their foreheads together, "You give me so much more than I need. Going to Hell was the best decision I ever made. Well, it was an order, but rebelling was all me."
In the distance, they could see that Castiel had arrived at the food court. He was already ordering when the others caught up. Castiel handed them cold sodas before saying, "I ordered a bacon cheeseburger for you, Dean, and a chicken sandwich for Sam."
"Why are we out here, Dean? We'll wake up the neighbors," Castiel said loudly before clamping his hand over his mouth. He spread his fingers slightly and whispered in a low hiss, "Case in point."
Castiel appeared behind them, "Be nice. Both of you. I'll pick up Jack from the movie when it's over, Claire, so you can visit Kaia afterward. Don't tell me about any kissy faces."
After the meals were handed over, the three of them sat on a picnic table in a corner of the food court.
Dean growled at him, "What? Why didn't you tell me about them, Sam? Who were they? I'll go break their kneecaps."
"Worth every bit of us getting grounded," Castiel laughed.
"Well, I don't speak goose."
Castiel smiled, "I was the lucky one. Henry was a wonderful man, Dean."
"Umm, so how did you two meet?" Dean asked.
Dean leaned over and whispered into Cas' ear, "Who said you can never have the one thing you wanted?"
"You aren't wrong, Dean." Sam chewed on his lip thoughtfully. "The market for physical books is dying and Dad won't fully commit to digital publishing. The company is becoming a dinosaur. Dad thinks eBooks are a trend." Sam rolled his eyes.
Dean and Sam watched the river from a bridge for a few minutes. Both were quiet as they processed everything that had happened.
“Did I interrupt something?” Sam asked. Castiel rolled away and walked over to the car and sat on the fender.
If you love me, let me know
Castiel interrupted, "Charlie, Charlie. Give the man some air. He's going to be here at least for a while, so you don't have to say everything so fast in a single monologue. Besides, I'm your bestie."
"Well, Grams says to always follow your heart. She's pretty wise. But I better go cut her off from the punch bowl now. She's getting a little feisty over there." Jessica pointed across the crowd to where an older woman had a group of men around her, talking to them animatedly. "She might start a bar fight again. You never know with her."
Castiel brushed his lips against Dean's lightly. "We should head inside."
Castiel cleared his throat. "I hate to bother you kids, but we need to be on our way to the dance.”
Castiel looked off into the distance as he answered, "Claire."
Dean interrupted him gently, "I like veggies, Cas. It's all good."
Castiel sighed. "Because you had those cut-off jean shorts when you were playing basketball with Sam in the back yard. You are very distracting in those."
"Instead of playing fifty questions in the barn, why don't you meet me up at my house in forty minutes. Maybe you could get some shoes on.” He looked ruefully at Dean’s feet. “So far, you've avoided the cow paddies that the girls like to leave behind willy-nilly. But shit happening is a thing that occurs several times here daily. Colonel should let you cross the yard now without attacking you on sight. Roberta is on the front porch, but she probably will sleep through you coming."
"I appreciate you looking after him. After Mom died, Dad was always too busy to take us there during the summers. I think Henry and my dad had a falling out before I was born. He never wanted to see him. I just wish… I know I promised to come back the next summer. I wish I had been able to do that. I'm happy he had you."
"What? What did you do? I mean you rebelled but that was a long time ago."
Jack looked up at Castiel with an earnest look, "What about ducks?"
"You two do pull off amazing feats. You always surpass my expectations. There are been no other humans like you in all my millennia. You're special, Dean, I hope you know that. You have more heart than any other man I've met. That's what pulls us through."
Castiel looked confused before adding, "Assbutt."
"You just saw the good in everyone."
Castiel tilted his head, "I did tell you I was oblivious."
"Just in case you see my daughter Jo, you're too old for her. Just keep in mind that I have a loaded shotgun."
Dean started to retreat toward the gate between the properties.  He said in a low crooning voice, “Who wants a bright red, shiny apple? Bowser wants a bright red, shiny apple.”
Dean sighed, "I'm a terrible person. Even more reason to be careful with Cas."
Dean sat up, “That’s awesome. Did you just make that up?”
Then again it just depends on
"He runs the Novak farm now. I helped him load his goods to take them to a farmer's market today. It was awesome. He sells cheese, honey, eggs, and…" A laugh interrupted him. He asked grumpily, "What's so funny, Sam?"
Sam responded, “I swear I didn’t tell him, but he found out you were in Falcon Bay. He lost it for a while; he accused Grandpa Henry of poisoning your mind. Yesterday, he started to have me do some additional research into your proposal to answer some questions that he had. Then, today, he approved the whole thing.”
Dean struggled to catch his breath, "If he doesn't kill me first. Does he run like you?"
The pizzas were covered with an assortment of vegetables and smelled delicious. Castiel looked at him doubtfully, "They both are vegetable pizzas. Everything on them is something that I grew here on the farm. You might like meat pizzas better…"
Claire glared at him, "Happy to see you too, old man."
Dean interjected, "I'm standing right here."
“So, I didn’t have a lot of time for chitchat. I was busy providing for you. I made sure you two had a roof over your head and every opportunity at your disposal.”
"I just got engaged to Sarah. I just don't know…"
Dean's first impression was that the house seemed much less dusty than it should be. It looked remarkably clean for a house that had sat unoccupied for over 20 years. He pulled sheets off the couch and side chair. He saw the daisy patterns on the couch and smiled. He could feel tears building up behind his eyes as he remembered the last time that he'd ever seen Henry was on that couch. Mary arrived to pick up her sons after an extended stay. Henry wanted to walk Dean to the car, but Mary insisted that he stay inside because he had twisted his ankle helping Dean and Cas make a treehouse. Cas sat next to Henry with a solemn, grief-stricken face as they said their goodbyes. Cas promised Dean and Mary he would take care of Henry for them while they were gone. Dean promised he'd be back the next summer, but... He never came back until now.
Castiel stared at him, "You're not mad?"
"Yep, I'm ready to get carried away," Sam agreed, grinning widely.
Dean shrugged, "That works. She was the only Skywalker that had her shit together. And she became the General. I'm good with Leia."
Dean sighed, “I’ve been working at the family business since I got out of college. It’s not a bad job. I didn’t choose to work there. Dad assumed I would, and it seemed like a good career choice. It might be different if Dad let me work on the projects I wanted to. I have some ideas to change the business, but Dad doesn’t like change much.”
Charlie stared at him wide-eyed. "No, absolutely not. No way, no how."
"I always enjoy our talks together. Let's do that."
Castiel pulled back, squinted his eyes, and said, “I wouldn’t be averse to a donkey. They’re great guard animals.”
Castiel repeated, "It's no big deal."
After he finished, he wandered into the bathroom. It gleamed spotlessly. Fresh towels were on the counter. The shower had shampoo and body wash in it. A new toothbrush and toothpaste were placed next to the sink. "Well, whoever you are, you sure thought about everything. I'm going to bake you a friggin' pie. You're awesome."
John put his sunglasses on and got in his car. He said, “Goodbye, Dean.” Dean watched until the taillights faded away down the road.
"My daughter's bloodhound. I need to finish milking the cows, but I make a mean French toast. You'll love it. We can catch up then."
"About time you came back, you damn idgit." Bobby's smile belied his words. "Welcome home, boy." Bobby had aged a lot since Dean had last seen him. His hair and perpetual beard had greyed, but his eyes sparkled with mirth as he grinned at Dean.
Dean gritted his teeth and enunciated each word clearly," Remember…to…put…the…lid…back…on…the…jar." He emphasized the word 'put'.
"A couple of Cain's craft beers, Benny. Dean needs to taste some real beer. He's from LA."
She punched him in the arm again, still glaring at him.
Castiel chided her, "It's not like that, Amelia. He really is my roommate. You know the type that you find in a newspaper to share an apartment with."
Jack hugged Claire tightly, "I'm ready."
"He taped me upside down on a basketball hoop at the park when I was five after stealing my pants. Jimmy had to cut me down."
Sam waved a large manila envelope, "You might find this interesting. I found this with your name on it from a law firm in Falcon Bay, Oregon, in Dad's safe. Isn't that where Grandpa Henry lived?"
Dean winked at Castiel, "It made me need a cold shower more than a cold beer."
Dean responded, "Deal.”
Castiel pursed his lips, "Yeah. Like I never heard the story about how you bought Sam fireworks and set them off when you were kids because your Dad was on the road again."
He pulled the lawnmower out of the shed and cleaned it off. When he tried to start it, it didn't even try to come to life. Dean muttered, "Figures. The gas probably evaporated years ago." He pulled out his phone and started a list: paint, hinges, nails, gas, two-by-fours. It was going to be a lengthy list. He frowned. Maybe buying a new lawnmower would be easier than trying to resurrect this dinosaur. He grumbled about being thwarted in his first attempt to be productive. He turned and his eyes fell on the truck. He smiled before going to his car and retrieving his tools. Fixing Henry's truck would be a good first step so he could haul around everything he needed to repair the place.
Castiel looked at Dean, "I think your phone might be in your pants from yesterday. We did get undressed in a hurry. You probably forgot to charge it."
"I just don't want you to be uncomfortable."
A whistling noise erupted from back the trunk of the Impala. Dean jumped up startled, "What the hell?" Light came from the seams of the trunk.
"I'm all for the flirting. But we are roommates too. So, at some point, we might want to decide about what we want us to be. Best friends, roomies, or something else."
"It's not so hard when you are used to it."
He was packing up the last of his personal effects when Sam returned. "So, get this, Dean. I called the law firm and talked to the daughter of the original lawyer, Jessica Moore. She says that the estate has been able to cover the taxes all these years. They contacted Dad several times when Grandpa Henry first passed away. Dad told them to keep it in trust. If you'd ever wanted it, you'd show up. But Jess said it is a bit run down now. No one has lived in it in 20 years."
Dean's brow furrowed. "Why would I be uncomfortable?"
Dean responded carefully, “Yes, unless you don’t want it to be?”
Castiel gave a short bitter laugh, "Yes way. I wrote my first novel in college. It sold. When I graduated from college, I authored a new novel every summer while I taught. I always kept my writing on the down-low, because its themes are not for minors and somewhat controversial."
"I was such a dumb ass."
Dean smiled, "Well, Sam was twelve. Let me call him. He'll want in on this action."
"You still help him out when he needs you."
"Don't worry at least 90% was complimentary, but it's the other ten percent that is more interesting." Castiel winked at him awkwardly. Dean pondered who had taught him how to wink because it wasn't the way any other single person on the earth winked.
"Hell, no. I just think we got here despite ourselves. We sort of really sabotaged each other a lot."
"You were comfortable with them. And towards the end, you were just phoning it in for Lisa. You were looking for a reason for breaking up with her. When she complained about how much time you spent with Sam, you took that and ran with it. Breaking up was really the best thing you could have done for Lisa."
Castiel impulsively hugged Dean, "Thank you so much, Dean. This is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me."
"Why not?"
"Well, if you don't think your dad will mind, I could sure use some assistance here," Dean smiled at Jack. "Someone needs to hand me tools." Dean walked over and retrieved a crate that was next to the carport wall. After testing to make sure that it would hold Jack's weight, he put it next to the truck. "There, now you can see too."
“Oh, yeah.” Castiel directed him to a slightly larger town about fifteen miles away.
"They are making progress. We've got a basic script, and now we're doing auditions to assign parts. I'm trying to come up with some ideas for the sets. I like to give them a basic premise and let them run with it. Here let me show you." Dean pushed the stack of papers toward him. "These are just rough doodles; don't judge them on artistic merit."
"Who said I was straight?"
Ellen poked him in the ribs, "You behave. You get free beer. I'm sure you want to keep it that way."
Dean was full of regrets at the time he missed spending with Henry. He should have fought his father harder to come back. He could have figured out a way to sneak here. All the 'could-haves' or 'should-haves' percolated in his head. Truthfully, Dean knew there wasn’t much he could have done to get John to bring him here. John was dead set against Henry. Whatever wedge had developed between the two men was too insurmountable for them to overcome in Henry's lifetime.
Dean thought about the turn his life was about to take. It would be a new adventure but he definitely wanted it to be with Castiel. “You're amazing. Don’t ever change, Cas.”
"That didn't usually turn out well."
"Cas, slow down. Wait a minute."
Castiel shrugged, "The only way for Jack to get me out of the Empty was for me to become human. I've made my peace with it. However, I think I will endeavor to avoid pancakes." He frowned at his half-eaten food.
After a sleepless night, Dean walked outside determined to do something useful around the farm. It seemed overwhelming. Although the major things had been taken care of over the years, the yard was a jungle of weeds and rocks, the paint on the house was falling off in large flakes, and the carport looked like it might cave in at any minute.
“What’s the catch?” Dean growled.
"How'd you find the hens?"
Bobby rolled his eyes, "Yes, ma'am. See what I put up with, Dean?"
"Catch up in a minute, Cas," Dean called after him.
Claire responded, "Twerp, if you name every animal we'll be here until tomorrow."
"You're my little bro. Of course, I'll worry about you. It's my job."
"Well, from what Henry told me, the publishing firm was burning him out. He was a victim of his own success. He wanted to sell it, but your dad didn't want to, and he'd inherited your grandmother's shares. Your dad and Henry reached some sort of agreement where the publishing firm paid off Henry and your dad took over. It caused a wedge in their relationship because there was some sort of expansion that John wanted to do that Henry didn't. I think it involved tabloids. It was a long time ago."
"Sam called the station. You missed the check-in call last night. He couldn't get you on his phone."
"You talked to Gordon about quitting?"
Sam dodged a vendor with arms full of popcorn while he answered, "You're a teacher and you don't fit that stereotype. He's a couple of years older than you."
The door opened behind him, and a teenage girl and a younger boy emerged from the house. The girl was dressed in a black leather jacket, jeans, and Converse sneakers, while the boy wore shorts and a purple hoodie. Both had blond hair and blue eyes. The girl appraised him knowingly, "You’re Mr. Winchester?" She blew a bubble with her chewing gum.
The crowd erupted in unison, "Dean Winchester."
Dean knelt next to Castiel, who was still crumpled on the ground. Sam helped Jack to his feet. Amara looked at Jack. "I don't think I can leave him like that. He's far too dangerous, and I don't want him to break Reno."
Dean sat back down heavily in his chair, "Figures."
Castiel winced. “Has it really been six years? Kelly passed away.” He trailed off awkwardly.
Castiel shifted in his chair and pulled another paper from his stack. After a moment, he offered, "If you want me to, I can take a look at the script and make edits."
Dean smiled and agreed, “That sounds like a plan. I’ll drive. Do you want me to pick you up around seven?”
Dean shook his head, "Nope. I suspect Eileen will be a long before we know it.  You and Eileen had your happy ending, now it's my turn.  Get in the car."
Castiel stopped dancing, "Really?"
"California girl born and bred. I got my law degree at Stanford, but I moved here a few years ago to be closer to my grandma, Mildred. She's getting on in years. I realized if I didn't come to spend time with her, I never would have a chance. Don't tell her I said that though or she'll try to ground me."
Chuck rolled his eyes, "Not Hell. Just me."
Dean raised his coffee cup and toasted, "To new beginnings."
Jess, Sam's tall, willowy blonde girlfriend piped up, "It's not a birthday present, Dean, if you forget to give it to them."
"Won the lottery?"
“So, Henry was the better dad? Is that what you are telling me?” John snarled.
“I’m sorry, sir. I didn’t know about the trust until last week,” Dean said apologetically.
Dean huffed as he tried to keep with Sam's long strides. Sam ran every morning; Dean would rather sleep late. Dean gulped in air, "Can you just slow down a little bit, Sam. You're going to give me a heart attack before I'm 40 at this rate."
"Everything you've gone through because of me. She tortured you because of me," Dean sighed.
O.o.O.o.O.o.O.o.O.O.o.O
"Let's not. Don't ever change, Cas." Dean met Castiel's eyes and they lost track of time. Dean didn't really understand what this weird dance of a relationship they were having was, but he knew that he didn't want it to stop.
Dean felt guilty as he said, “I… I don’t have an excuse, sir. I guess those summers seemed so long ago that I sort of forgot about things here except as a nostalgic memory. Where is he buried?”
"But ducks," Jack protested.
Amelia responded, "Oops. Sorry, Cas, thought you were Jimmy." She sat down next to Castiel, apologetically.
Castiel smiled at Dean, "Tell me which day is most convenient for taking you shopping."
Castiel arched an eyebrow, "How are they doing with that?"
“You are part of the family business in LA. The Winchester name means something. The brand means something.” John curled his fists belligerently. “I’m not going to keep this offer open, boy. If I leave without you today, don’t ever return begging to come home.”
Dean touched the grey at Castiel's temples. "Still, seems like you got a bad deal. You traded immortality for a broken hunter with a GED and a bad attitude."
"Entirely too much. I just made this very awkward."
Dean could feel Castiel's hot breath on his face. He asked quietly, "The same way you love Sam?"
Dean went back into the house and got a box of Cheerios. "Try this."
Lightning forked in front of them with an explosive roar; light and shadows danced across the hood of the car. Dean exclaimed, "Holy crap, that was close. I’d pull over but I'm afraid this area might flood. I don't think I've ever seen rain this hard."
Dean felt relieved. He as picturing Castiel Novak as a guy who taught preschoolers and would also bring colds and things from the kids home. He was a high-school drama teacher, so they should have things in common. "Hey, Sammy?"
Dean looked at him seriously, "Cas, you've been driving me crazy ever since I met you. It has nothing to do with what you told me tonight. You're perfect just as you are. The humble English teacher who wields a red pen with impunity. Novelist who writes incredibly deep supernatural and spiritual works. The dude who talks to bees that wander into his path. The guy who can carry Sam like a sack of potatoes. Those are all you."
Dean frowned, "Ok, that's different, but I can respect that. How about a tv show?"
"Thank you."
The goose waddled through the door and looked at Dean mistrustfully. "Hold out your hand so he can sniff it, Dean. He's got to learn to trust you."
“Why’d he change his mind?”
Castiel leaned forward gingerly and kissed Dean without brushing their clothes together. They both tasted like a peach. Dean rumbled, "Actually, I’m going with sexy."
"At the end of the day, we can only do our best. The next day we try to do better."
Dean was sketching set pieces for the play his students were working on at the dining room table when Castiel came into the room with a pile of papers. Castiel asked, "Will I bother you if I use the table too?"
“Dad greenlit your project! You can start the new romance book line. He’ll give you full editorial and marketing control over it.”
Castiel squinted and scanned in the dark. His eyes lit up when he saw a plumeria in a newly landscaped flower bed. "Dean, is that a plumeria?"
"They look like great kids." Dean followed Castiel into the house. "Where's your wife? I'd like to meet her."
He paused before going into Henry's bedroom. He wasn't sure what he'd find. He wasn't even sure what Henry died from or if anyone had cleaned out Henry's belongings after he passed. He sighed deeply and pushed the door open. A large brass bed stood in the center of the room. Unlike his room, most of this room had been stripped clean. A pile of fresh linen sat on the end of the bed. A note on purple parchment paper sat on top of it, "These are clean. Welcome home, Dean."
"Thank you, Cas. It was much better than coming into a dusty mess. Did you and Grandpa Henry stay in touch then after I left?"
Jack batted at Claire, "Last week the only one who saw Dad was us and the cows. And Bowser. And Roberta. The Colonel. Penny…"
"I had feelings for Benny and Lisa," Dean protested.
Dean snorted, "And you gave me faith. I owe you."
Castiel turned to head back to the barn when he saw Dean. He scurried over, “You should have asked for help with that. This fence isn’t your responsibility. It’s mine.”
You'll never know what went well
“You too.” Castiel smiled nervously. He seemed uncomfortable.
"Who's going to teach me to trust him?" Dean grumbled and hesitated before offering his hand to the goose. The goose leaned forward to sniff it. Dean yanked his hand back after the goose suddenly honked loudly.
"What's the point, Cas? He's got his own life now. He's got Jess. What more does he need?"
"You have kids?"
Dean pondered for a moment, "I have a box of cereal in the house. Think he'd come for that if I shook it?"
Crowley patted his hand consoling, “I’m sorry for your loss, Cas. Now, who is this handsome fellow? A coworker?” He smiled at Dean charmingly.
Sam nodded, "Worst morning person ever."
“You wound a man to the quick. I’ll bring you a great bottle of wine on the house for old time’s sake, Cassie.”
"It could be worse. I don't leave the lid up on the toilet. As it turns out, I was a bit in a hurry to get to the backyard." Castiel padded the blanket next to him, but on the opposite side of the offensive peanut butter.
"I told them I wanted a place where men danced. I meant with each other, not on stage. I'm afraid I didn't word that very well for the girls."
Castiel bickered, "It was 95 degrees yesterday. I was sweating just looking at you."
Castiel tilted his head, "Except for what?"
"What's that for?" Dean grumbled as he rubbed his shoulder.
Dean's mind went places it shouldn't before he answered, "Umm, yes?"
"I'm just picturing you in overalls, a flannel shirt, a John Deere hat, and a piece of straw hanging out of your mouth."
Dean looked down at the ground. “That’s what I’m trying to figure out, Cas. This place… I was pretty low when I came here. Before I can go much farther down that road with you, I think I need to figure out me and what I want.”
Sam crossed his arms in mock anger, "Yeah, Dean. What Jess said!"
"Perhaps, we could time this better next time, Dean," Castiel sighed. "I'll go get Jack." He tossed the keys for the car to Dean. "Can you start her please and we'll get him home?"
"12 years ago today, we met," Dean said softly. "You came into the barn and scared the shit out of me and Bobby."
"He doesn't want us to do chores Sunday mornings," Claire responded. "When Mom was alive, we'd go to church. Dad doesn't take us anymore, but he wants us to relax and be thankful on Sunday mornings."
"Wait, does that mean you're Han Solo in this scenario and I'm Leia?"
“Did I do something wrong?”
“No, Castiel. Your signals are fine. It’s me. I’m unsure.”
"He can't be that bad."
Dean looked at Castiel hopelessly, "I don't think they get the concepts of roommates."
"You might enjoy working on the play, but it's still work and stressful. Cas will be good for you."
“What’s there to think about? You said what you wanted. I gave it to you. End of story. Let’s go back to LA now.”
Dean mentally kicked himself as he followed him. The table was set for two with a heap of French toast in the middle. "I’m sorry, Cas. I didn't mean to…"
Dean just stared between Castiel and Sam.
"You mean the drinks like Crowley used to drink? No thanks. I don’t like those. The rest sounds wonderful. I've never really gone to a beach just to enjoy being on a beach. The world is different when I'm with you."
"Grams is magic. Come talk to her sometime. See you later, Dean."
Castiel slipped into the car, “Not a problem, Dean. I just finished getting dressed a few minutes ago myself.”
Castiel smiled at him, "I’m old. Once in a while, I deserve to be sappy."
Castiel abruptly murmured, "Excuse me," before he walked in the direction of Claire and Jack.
Dean blushed, "Thank you. You aren’t so bad yourself."
The skies suddenly parted and the sun came out. Chuck stood on the road, perfectly dry, in a relaxed position with his hands behind his back. "Hello, Dean."
"You just do you, Cas. Because you are awesome."
Sam snorted, "You were pulling your hair out in frustration because the kids caught one of the sets on fire the other day. You almost had to call the fire department."
He tilted his head at Dean quizzically and said in a deadpan voice, "Oops."
Castiel answered relieved, “It’s a date.”
After sufficient oohing and ahhing over the gift from everyone present, Castiel said, "I won't turn on you, Dean. That gift was of sufficient quality."
Castiel said through gritted teeth, “He’s my date, Dean Winchester.”
"He should sell. He's rich. You and I could find something else."
"I guess I never had a real safety net. I had to raise Sam after Mom died and Dad bailed. I had to be his brother, his mother, and his father, all rolled up in one extremely overprotective package." Dean looked at his lap, forming his hand into a fist and then relaxing it, before starting over again.
"Hey, the girls picked the strip club not me. And you…" Dean started laughing hysterically again.
"Yeah. It's good to see him again."
Dean asked, "Students getting you down, Cas?"
Castiel smiled, "No worries, Jack. I'm too busy to do anything besides the farm and my writing."
"That’s a reasonable request. I'll take it under advisement. And Cas?"
He spied his old bicycle buried under some crates next to the house. He pulled it out. He'd learn to ride on this bike and then taught Sam a few years later. The bike was rusted, and the tires were tattered, but the memories were fresh in his mind. Dean thought of all the bike rides he took with Cas around the town.
Dean's brow furrowed. "It's a plant."
Dean wished the world would suddenly swallow him whole. It had just popped out. He tried to figure out a way to turn this into a joke.
"You did not take advantage of me. I wanted that. I just… I didn't think you wanted that."
Dean looked at the bear. It was the color of Jack's hair and wore a yellow jacket that looked like one of Jack's. "It does kind of look like him. Even has blue eyes. I'll get him for you."
Castiel smiled at him crookedly, "Yes, yes. I did."
"I took woodshop in high school. Grandpa Henry also may have taught me a thing or two."
Jody said, "They're good kids. They can't cause any more mayhem than you and Dean did when you were little."
“The family business. I put everything into it for you and Sam. Did you think I worked those long hours because I liked it? I wanted to leave you and Sam something to be proud of. Something that mattered. I did it all for you.”
Chuck said smugly, "I happened. Cas, I ignored it when you ruined the first ending for this story. I told you when rebelled and brought Dean back to the house, that you were not part of the story. What did you tell me -- we're making it up as we go along? I don't particularly like that. My characters are supposed to do what I want. I had the perfect ending for this world, and you screwed it up. But I was like, what the heck, let's see where the story takes me now. It's had some hits and misses. The whole British Men of Letters storyline, the Leviathan, not great, I know. But, man, I thought I had nailed this ending."
"And you have that goofy dog now that keeps staring at me." Dean glanced over at the German Shepard who wagged his tail. "There's something not right about that dog."
"He's why I couldn't get you to come with me before. He has your heart. That's how I found you. I'm going to give you what you need."
Dean stammered as he entered the office, “I’m sorry, Mr. Turner.”
Bobby retorted. "I need a t-shirt that says, 'Will work for beer.'"
Castiel smirked, "Well I said it, so it must be true." Castiel opened the passenger's door and told Dean, "Your chariot awaits, but we must load the other passenger first." Castiel slid the seat forward and whistled, "Come on, Roberta." The elderly bloodhound stood up and shook herself off slowly. She leisurely walked towards them. When she got near the door, she looked at Castiel expectantly. He sighed, bent over, picked up the dog, and put her in the cab in the cargo area. "She's dreadfully spoiled."
Without hesitation, Dean answered, "Yes."
"Dude, you've taken care of my house for years. I think I can help you load a truck."
"I don't think so, Brother. I like this world. I don't like you too much though."
Castiel grunted, "Jack, run."
“What did he die of?”
Dean said hesitantly, "I thought about being a teacher."
"And just like a fledgling, he'll need you to pick him up when he falls. I moved away from everyone when I was 22. I went my own way; marched to my own drummer. When everything fell apart though, I went to Jimmy and clung to him like a barnacle. He's only ten minutes older, but it makes him the older brother. I don't really know where I would have gone to lick my wounds if Jimmy hadn't been there."
Castiel shook his head. "No, it was my choice to rebel. He just set up the conditions. It's like one of those Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books that Metatron smashed into my head. Chuck set up the conditions, but we ran our own race. Made our own choices and mostly they worked out."
"There's little I would change on this wacky joyride we’ve been on, Cas. Except for some people we could have saved and didn't. Charlie, Bobby, Kevin, Mom. But I'm damn glad you’ve been by side through all of it."
They walked in companionable silence through the trees on a dirt trail. Castiel cautiously began, “Dean, about last night…”
"Can't you just find him when he crows tomorrow? Don’t chickens go home to roost?"
Castiel put his hand on Dean's knee. "You are very forgiving. You forgave me for unleashing the leviathan on the Earth, for deceiving you about Crowley, for being tricked by Metatron, for letting Lucifer in…"
He wasn't sure how long he'd been working when a young voice asked curiously, "What are you doing?"
"I need to call Uncle Bobby to ask him to send a tow truck."  Dean pulled out his phone and looked at it in disgust. "No bars, Cas. How's your phone?"
"You're annoying."
"If I don't make through this, promise me that you'll let me go. That you'll go live that life you described for both of us. All I want is for you to be happy. You deserve that, you've given so much. Please promise me. We can't save everyone, my friend."
Chuck cleared his voice, "The winner of the most romantic dance is Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester. You get the fifty-dollar gift card for a romantic dinner at Crowley's. And welcome home to Falcon Bay, Dean."
Castiel held up his hands in mock surrender, "You do you. If that tie helps you, who am I to judge. It's just… Why did you buy that tie, to begin with."
“I made up my mind, Cas. My life is here. You and I – we deserve our chance of happiness together. I’m not sure where the road is going to take us, but I know I want to be on that road trip with you.”
"Scooby-Doo is the best. I'm envious," Dean replied.
Castiel grabbed his hand, intertwining his fingers with Dean's despite the grease. "Dean, I rather spend the next fifty years with a bum hip to be with you than a thousand years in Heaven. There's nowhere I'd rather be."
Dean called out shakily, "Good night, you two." He walked quickly into his house and closed the door behind him. He thought again about the body Castiel had hidden underneath his loose work clothes. It was going to be a long night. He was so screwed.
"Snickerdoodles are the ultimate cookie, Dean. I told you I will brook no arguments about that."
“This place? Your grandfather’s pipe dream? He had it nice in LA. He was someone. People looked up to him. Why he ever thought to come here to live escapes me. He left a small hick town to go to the big city, why in the hell would he ever go back?”
Castiel looked at him distressed, "Everyone in the town thinks we're a couple."
Dean glanced over at the charcoal grey pants and jacket Castiel wore. He had a dark-colored shirt with a tie that again matched his eyes. “Looking good, Cas.”
Jody patted Jack on the head, "Ask your dad about ducks sometimes. It's his story to tell."
The front door swung open and Claire stood there in her sheriff uniform. She took their disheveled appearance and groaned, "Are you two making out on the couch again? Eww, just eww. Don't you have a bed upstairs for that?"
"We've both been flirting with each other. Neither of us bright enough to know the other was flirting." Dean laughed. “We’re a couple of smooth operators.”
A deep voice behind him said, "Please forgive the Colonel, he doesn't like unannounced visitors."
Castiel protested, "I haven't. But that may change based on the quality of the birthday present."
Castiel got out of the car to join him. "Everything ok, Dean?"
"You didn't try to stop him?"
Castiel rubbed the back of Dean's neck. "It's ok. No harm, no foul. I have snacks in my backpack. There are some cokes in your cooler. There are trees to go behind if we need to pee. You have a couple of blankets in the back seat. We can just sleep in the car until morning. Then we can hike until we get phone reception. It's ok. It will be fun. Like a sleepover."
"Future you," Castiel looked confused.
Castiel looked up at him, "Am I bothering you, Dean?"
"No worries. I'll try it. I’m always up for a new adventure." Benny stifled a laugh as he poured them their beers. Carrying their drinks, Dean and Castiel walked over near the wall and out of the way of the dancers in the center of the gazebo. Dean impulsively asked, "Are you and Charlie seeing each other?"
Dean kissed him, rolling partially on top of him. They let their hands and lips roam as they sought to frantically explore each other’s bodies. As Castiel’s hands landed on the top button of Dean’s jeans, Dean suddenly pulled back regretfully. Things were moving too fast. He said, “We better stop.”
After having some bitter words with both Gordon and his father, Dean's week passed in a whirl. He moved his furniture into storage and turned in his apartment keys. He purchased a new phone and gave his new phone number only to Sam. Finally, on Friday, he loaded his clothes in the car and started heading to Falcon Bay. He looked it up on the internet and the population of the town was up to 1,500 people. Dean had lived in Los Angeles his entire life where there could be fifteen hundred people in a club in a single night. His memories were of a sleepy little town, nestled on a lake. There were a few dozen farms in an area surrounded by forests. When he was a kid, the town seemed full of adventure and promise. The adult version of himself just wanted a quiet place to figure out what the heck he wanted to be when he grew up. He laughed at himself. Better late than never.
Dean carefully took off his shoes and hung his feet over the edge of the dock into the water. The small fish in the lake nibbled at his toes. He carefully opened the box. Inside was a set of index cards. Each of the cards had a newspaper clipping of a house glued to it with notes in small spiderly handwriting next to it. Under the cards was a picture of his grandfather standing next to a woman with his arm around her. Dean stared at it for a long moment. He had never seen a picture of his grandmother, Josephine, before. John didn’t have any pictures, and Henry had never shown him any.
Dean reached a hand toward Cas and then paused. "Do you think you could dress us in board shorts and tropical shirts like in that show Magnum PI that I made you watch? Sam too. No shoes."
Dean frowned, "I don't have work boots. I'll need to get some if I want to help Cas."
“You talked me into it, Cas, but I’m going to do the dishes for you tonight. I have to earn my keep somehow.”
Castiel opened the basket and handed Dean a wrapped sandwich. "It's a double bacon cheeseburger with extra onions." Castiel peeked in the basket again before pulling out a cold beer and a piece of pie. "This is cherry pie, but there's also an apple in the fridge if you prefer."
Dean laughed, "That's not too difficult. Sam is the size of a moose. It would have been a better dare to have Castiel try to do it."
“I literally thought you’d never ask.”
Dean put his hand on top of Castiel's, "When we get on the other side of this thing with Chuck, what are you going to do? Stay on Earth?"
Claire made a face. "Double eww. I do not need to know anything about your sex life. Sam said he and Rowena are in Rio now." Sam had graduated with a degree in archaeology and anthropology. He and Rowena traveled the world looking for at and interesting antiquities. Sam loved to travel; Dean had become a homebody. Claire asked, "Have you heard from Jack?"
"No, Dean. I'm quite sure you…" Castiel stopped as he saw Dean start to smirk. "What's so funny?" he demanded.
When the smell of popcorn and grilled hamburgers wafted over to them, Castiel suggested, "Sam, Dean, you want to get some lunch?" Without looking back Castiel started to glide his way across the crowded fairgrounds. He worked his way through the crowd effortlessly, while Sam and Dean struggled to keep up.
Dean sighed, “I hope the apple thing wasn’t a one-time trick.” He returned to his house and retrieved some wire and posts to repair the fence. He was working on the fence when he saw Castiel and a woman in a blue jacket emerge from the barn. They talked for a moment before the woman went to her pick-up truck to retrieve something. After handing a package to Castiel, she drove off.
Charlie blinked several times. "You give great gifts but that might be the greatest gift ever. It gives him an incentive to stay there with you for one thing. It has a permanence to it. It shows him that you want him to make the house his home. It's thoughtful because it's one of the things he likes. You didn't need help from your wingman, handmaiden. You had this handled. So, what are you thinking?"
Dean raised an eyebrow, “Actually, I think the opposite. I don’t think there’s anything for me in LA. I prefer my life here.”
"Almost a lifetime! It's so good to see you."
Dean adjusted his tie once more as he looked in the mirror. He used a small amount of hair gel to spike his hair up a little and then almost undid it until he decided that it was fine. He changed clothes about five times before he settled on blue slacks and a black jacket with a pale pink tie. He wondered for a minute if he should change the tie out for a green one but panicked when he glanced at the clock. He rushed outside to the Impala and could see Castiel waiting on his porch in the distance.
"Of course, Dean!!! You're the best." Charlie turned around to show the others the present.
After deciding it would be creepy if he stared longer, Dean walked over to tap him on the shoulder. Castiel jumped startled before turning around to look at Dean with a wide smile. "Hello, Dean. I hope you like spaghetti. I took liberties in the kitchen. I hope you don't mind that."
Castiel internally shuddered, "Even there, Dean. I’m personally hoping for Purgatory."
Dean looked down. It had been a gift from Gordon, and Dean knew it was expensive. He had never really liked it anyhow. He just shrugged, “It’s too warm for a jacket. No worries.”
Claire was half under the truck with only her lower legs and purple Converse sneakers poking out. As she pulled herself out from under the truck, she hit her head on the frame. "What? Ouch! Easy there, I'm just looking for our rooster."
"You sure know how to make an entrance, Charlie."
"I want to retire, Cas. I mean it. You and me, Sam and Eileen. We just get two houses side-by-side in some generic small town. We mow the grass. We have backyard barbeques and invite some of the neighbors. I get to work on cars. And you…. You do whatever it is you want to do. Raise bees? I don't know."
Dean frowned, "I’m working with the kids to put together a play. That's fun."
"What made you decide to leave Boston?"
The drive to Oregon was uneventful. After Dean turned from the two-lane highway onto the dirt road leading to the farm, he slowed the car to a crawl as he traversed the rut-ridden road. Cursing under his breath, he wished he had thought this through and rented an SUV instead of driving his classic '67 Impala down this atrocity of a farm road. He would need to get the road graded and fresh gravel spread before he drove down it too often.
“All my cows are special, but Taylor I hand raised from a bottle because her momma rejected her.” Castiel looked at her concerned.
"I'm gay."
Castiel looked befuddled as she took off. He slowly turned to Dean, "Sorry to have bothered you."
Castiel had grown up impressively. He was much smaller than Dean back in the day. He and Cas had been inseparable whenever he came. He had been much shyer than his twin, Jimmy. Jimmy didn't seem interested to spend time with Dean, but Castiel had immediately bonded with him. Half the time, Castiel slept over at Henry's when Dean was there. Cas let Dean lead their adventures, but he always had his back.
Ellen smiled, "You two were the cutest little pair. Always getting into mischief. I thought for sure you were going to cause Adler an aneurysm. Whenever a kid causes trouble in this town, he still brings up your exploits."
story really begins."
"Spill it, Dean. Don't hide behind your pie." Charlie folded her hands together and perched her chin on them.
Castiel flipped through a photo album while he sat on the front porch of the house at Singer and Sons Salvage. He smiled as he touched each picture: Sam and Rowena at Stonehenge; Jack and Claire on a mule ride down the Grand Canyon; Mary and Bobby sitting in front of a Christmas tree; Dean and Castiel sitting in beach chairs in matching Hawaiian shirts, sipping fruity drinks. The last five years had been a blessing. Living an ordinary life in an ordinary little town was the best ending he could dream of.
Charlie, Sam, and Jess said loudly in unison, "No."
Dean snorted, "You had to take it there."
The pair approached the car carefully. Dean opened the trunk and stepped quickly back. Something was glowing deep in the bowels of the weapon cache.
“No. I want to do this. I think we just need to talk first.” The sudden ring of Dean’s cellphone shattered the moment. “Dammit, we can’t catch a break,” Dean said grumpily.
Castiel nodded, "Hip."
Dean pondered who Inias was? A former roommate? A former girlfriend? He paused in thought again. Maybe a former boyfriend? It would be interesting to find out.
"I'm good. I just got back in town. It's been a long time."
Castiel pointed to a bear, "It's just that bear reminds me of Jack." The two hadn't seen Jack since he deposited Castiel in the library of the bunker after rescuing him. They weren't sure when and if they'd see him again.
Dean shrugged, "But who's keeping track?"
"You didn't think so at the time."
When they pulled into Crowley’s parking lot, Dean looked at Castiel dubiously. While most of the buildings in the town had a simple, homey feel to them, Crowley’s was ostentatious. It had columns in front of the door and a fountain bubbled on a marble terrace leading to the front door. “Not for nothing, Cas, but this place kind of looks like a bordello.”
Chuck laughed, "Exactly what is that supposed to do to me." He hurled Dean into a tree and turned his attention back to Castiel.
Dean frowned, "I just mean we can hang out and not talk, but it still feels like we're together."
Castiel appeared with a fluttering of wings. He looked at Dean warily and said without emotion, "It is good that you and Sam made it here. I hope Heaven is to your liking. Jack and I worked diligently on it after he pulled me from the Empty."
Dean acquiesced, "That does sound pretty bad."
"But then you would never have met Cas." Claire walked over and hugged Castiel. She patted Dean on the head to avoid the grease. She waved as she left, "Don't do anything I wouldn't do. And call Sam!"
"You too. How's your life going?"
“You could never intrude, Cas. My dad is just one noisy son of a bitch.” Dean strode over to the fence. “Can I kiss you, Cas?”
Dean signaled for the waitress to bring them their check. "So, Cas. Where do you want to go today?"
Sam looked at him doubtfully, "Really?"
Sam laughed, "Yep. That's where I go on Saturday mornings. Cas and I do a ten-mile run. It's fun."
Dean snorted, "Then maybe Dad needs to sell one of his houses or cars and reinvest it in the company."
"Jody!"  Dean walked around the booth to hug Jody Mills. He looked her up and down. "You're the sheriff now?"
"Can I refuse you anything?"
“On you, yes.”
Dean crossed his arms and watched the large animal for a moment. “So, Bowser? How do I get you to go home?”
“I wish I had known him better.” Dean’s eyes shone with unshed tears.
Dean snorted, "I can't even imagine how much time it takes you to do all of this."
Dean surveyed the crowd until his eyes fell on Castiel standing near the opposite wall, talking to Claire. Jack was playing a video game on his phone while sitting on a stool behind Ellen who was manning the food buffet. He headed in Castiel's direction.
“Then you better give me directions to this place. Otherwise, we’ll spend the evening in your driveway.”
Dean looked at the chaos in front of him. He whispered, "Amara, please. If Chuck is back, so are you. Please help me. You owe us that much. Please. I'm begging you." Dean stood and started to move towards Chuck.
Dean responded, "Remember when I left my beer on the counter last week and it got warm before I retrieved it?"
Castiel started working side-by-side on the fence with him. Dean could swear Castiel kept sneaking peeks at him as they were working.
"I can fix the house," Dean said firmly.
Castiel whispered, "I tried to tell you we were entering the dance for the most romantic couple of the evening, but we were kind of um… caught in the moment."
"What are we? Twelve?" Dean grumbled.
Castiel poked him in the ribs, "Then strap on your wings, sweetie, because I'm going to send you flying."
Castiel ran his thumb across the face of the bear looking away. "You know, you are the only one who ever gave me anything. The cassette tape, this bear, the clothes I'm wearing. I owe you everything."
"Look, Sam. It's the right thing to do. You know that and I know that. Also, it's a growing market. We need to think towards the future."
Sam let out an exasperated sigh, "The name is Sam. Dad's in a mood. Nearly bit off my head twice. Sarah is unnerved by your leaving and keeps asking if I’m going to leave too. How's the country life?"
Castiel rolled his eyes and cut him off, “I can ensure you, Crowley, that I never particularly liked you.”
Castiel changed the subject as he grabbed Dean's hand, "Tell me something embarrassing about Sam, let's even the score."
"I don’t get it, Sam. Why can't I get Dad to launch the LGBT romance book line? I got the numbers, I proved the viability, but he won't listen. He never listens." Dean slumped heavily in his office chair, defeated. Whenever he wanted to try something different or take a new approach, his father slammed the door shut on it. He felt like he was hitting his head against a brick wall repeatedly.
Dean thought back to Castiel's twin brother. Jimmy had been very gregarious and active, while Castiel was quieter and more subdued. Jimmy was so full of life and had been fearless when they were kids. Dean said sympathetically, "I'm sorry for your loss, Cas."
Dean eyebrows furrowed together, "How did that become daddy issues?"
Dean took the box and left. After signing the paperwork, he drove to his and Henry’s favorite fishing spot. They used to sit there for hours, along with Castiel, waiting for that one big fish Henry always talked about catching, an ancient catfish that he’d often see that always outwitted him. They never caught it, but the hours spent in each other’s company was its own reward.
The two danced slowly long into the night. Dean hoped this would be the first of many midnight dances.
Castiel responded, "Dean…"
“His heart. He had a heart attack. It literally darn broke on him. Sometimes, I think he just cared too much. He’d take in every stray that crossed his path. He took in the whole town. When the school needed a baseball diamond because the old one burned down, Henry paid for it. When the library had a book drive, Henry would buy every book on the list for them. He practically raised Cas. Don’t worry. He left some money for you too.”
The man pinned Dean in a glare, “The name is Rufus. My father was Mr. Turner. Now, why in the Sam hell did it take you so long to get your sorry ass back here? You know how much crap I had to do for you for the last twenty-five years?”
"I sent him to the cage that he locked me in. I'm tired of his tantrums. All he ever does is whine about his work. He didn't want a sister; he wanted a therapist. I'm so tired of him," she shook her head. "I thought he enjoyed creating, but all he really enjoyed was having things his way. I'm so over that."
