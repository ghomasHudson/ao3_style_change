“Ramble On, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, 1969.” Cas looked like he was remembering a fond memory, it’s probably one with Dean.
But the cherry-on-top, the creme de la creme, the pièce de résistance, the light at the end of this god-forsaken tunnel: was when Claire was asked to prom by a junior. God bless Kaia Nieves.
I'm not how well this fits into the October/Water prompt, but I try. Also, the part about Dean sticking his feet into a stockpot with warm water and Epsom Salt is a thing that happened to me! I'm a tall woman (6'1"/1.85 m) and I wear a Woman's size 10 in the U.S. sizing and when I went to Alaska over the summer, my feet got bitten by some bug or spider thing. My feet swelled like crazy so we tried soaking them in warm water and Epson Salt and by the end, I was sticking my feet in a huge stockpot because it was about the only thing I could stick my plank-sized feet in. I have good foundations. Also, my feet are fine now! Though one ankle swelled up on the flight home, which was weird, but it's the ankle I've sprained twice so *shrugs*.
Also, if anyone has advice on how I can hurry this along or around this, please, I'm begging you. Help me.
Sorry! I didn't want to put up the next chapter without my friend checking it, but we got it done and the next chapter! I tend to leave words out.
On great days, Dean would be able to walk around with little to no help, his hands would not shake and be able to grasp things well, and he wouldn't be in pain.
When Jack came along, the car wasn’t the most ideal in terms of the backseat; well, none of their cars were, so Cas got an SUV. This time Dean helped him find the car and they settled on a nicely taken care of Chevy Equinox that wasn’t too hard for Dean to get into.
I like crafts and creating things. This was all I could think of, but I love it. I can see them being a royal family for Halloween, God, it's beautiful.
Castiel looked around and found two steps up that led to a hallway where a door was ajar and headed in that direction. As he neared the door, he heard whispered voices, then he heard Sam tell Dean that he’s getting them and it will be fine. Castiel jumped at least two feet and flattened himself against the wall near the door that Sam stepped out of two seconds later.
Dean was getting tired of the hospital and Sam had his hands full of grumpy Dean. All Sam could do was thank Chuck that Dean was finally able to leave in two weeks to a small split-level home Sam found a couple weeks ago. He had shown Dean some photos and it had Dean’s stamp of approval on it.
There were tears too. They came from Dean’s eyes, plopping into Castiel’s dark hair. There was blood in there too.
Emma is 13 and Jack is 11, he is proud of them too. They are doing amazing things, but Dean expected them, Claire almost didn’t happen. Dean thought they lost her at one point during the pregnancy, another when she disappeared to do teenage dumb shit, and there have been incidents where Claire could have died.
Yeah, so. School slapped me in the face with a dead fish. I procrastinate and I'm lazy, forgetful. And I've been slapped with a dead fish. I'm so very behind on this, it's October 25th and I've just started Day 6. *cries inside*
When Castiel entered the Winchester brothers’ home, he was surprised to see it not look like the Bunker in any way. It was bright, open, and airy. There were dark hardwood floors and baby blue walls. The couches and recliner were nice and not cheap looking, and looked immensely comfortable. Sam lead Castiel farther into the home, the latter of the two noting that it was a wide open floor plan, easy to navigate.
Sam walks down the hallway wondering who it could possibly be. No one said they were visiting and everyone but Charlie calls ahead so they don’t surprise Dean. Is it his boss? She knows he doesn’t work today. A neighbor? No, Dean faked a seizure once to get out of a party and since then they all avoid them like the plague. So Sam is the one who nearly has a heart attack when he opens the door that perfect Thursday afternoon, but at least it’s not Dean.
“Look, babe. I was in a dead sleep! I was cozy, I was in a deep slumber, it was nice! You can’t blame me!” Dean is now piling his plate with bacon with some pancakes that Cas has finally figured out how to not burn.
), but they were in some form of a committed relationship with Gabriel, Eileen, and Rowena too; Cas really understands it, but Dean just sees they all love each other and just goes with it. They live together and do other stuff together, they’re happy about it. As long as they’re happy, treating each other well, and their kids are happy and loved, Dean’s more than happy to accept their relationship. Sammy’s happy and no one is hitting each other - maliciously.
Also, in the last chapter, an edit was made after posting when I realized I left information about Dean being on oxygen was not in the final chapter. There is more information about that in that chapter.
But, when Sam rolls up with a truck that has a hot tub in tow and says happy anniversary you fucks, Dean does cry. He’s still getting used to people giving him nice things and people helping him, still getting used to the idea that he deserves nice things.
I love to read and I fucking L O V E libraries. I work at the one at my university. I'm posting while I'm at work, but don't tell anyone. Shush. It's why I know about library classification and catalog systems. Academic libraries tend to use the Library of Congress and public libraries tend to use the Dewey Decimal System. The more you know! (Psst, I'm in America if you're confused. Still confused? Ask me in the comments and I'll respond!)
Hello! This chapter is from Dean's Point of View and is basically what happens in the break of the last chapter. So that means, HOLY SHIT DESTIEL IS HAPPENING IN THIS CHAPTER MOTHERFUCKERS.
Of course, they had seen this coming. Claire came out and told them that she was dating Kaia (they’re the same age, Kaia just skipped a grade or two in middle school, Dean doesn’t know the semantics); and, BOOM! Dean was Claire/Kaia endgame. He’s so endgame that he (Crafty McCrafterson) made the tuxes they wore to prom. Dean got to happily (and playfully, Dean and Kaia got along amazingly) give the dad talk to Kaia, one has to make sure all parts of their firstborn is intact.
Lifting Dean’s upper body up off the bed and resting him against the headboard, Sam tried to ignore the fact that he could feel Dean’s spine through his sleep shirt. Sitting next to Dean on the bed, he smoothed Dean’s hair to the side with his fingers, having stopped putting gel in his hair long ago. At the feel of Sam’s fingers, Dean stirred and sleepily slurred “G’d m’rnin’ S’m”. Dean opened his eyes a little more, showing Sam his green eyes while squinting to get Sam into focus. Six months after moving into their home, Sam had noticed Dean squinting like crazy and took him to an eye doctor where it was confirmed that without corrective lenses, Dean was nearly blind. Sam figured it was Cas’ light flashing when he died.
this is the last of these chapters that are already written. I have yet to write the rest. it will get finished at some point.
Again, I'm so deeply sorry that I didn't finish in October, but I don't want to leave this unfinished! I've really hit a good spot in writing this right now and I'm excited for the coming chapters! Today (11/5/19), I'll post two chapters, days 7 and 8. I'm still writing!
Remember to check out winchester-reload on Tumblr and JackieDeeArts on Instagram and Twitter I believe!
That’s how Sam found him. Passed out, covered in severe third degree burns. Clutching a dead, bloody Castiel.
Castiel leaned against the wall of the Winchester’s bathroom as he earnestly and feverishly prayed after seeing Dean three years after he... he died and left. He returned, once again, wholly human, with the tiniest amount of grace that could heal nothing he wanted to. He was no angel, he was going to age, with Dean. He might have enough to take away the pain, just for a little while at a time, but that pain will come back. He can never take it away completely. Dean had told him it was fine, that it was okay that Cas couldn’t heal him. It was fine that he could only ease his pain, it was more than enough. Dean said that him being here, alive, was enough.
Ever since Dean had that first fall, they became more frequent despite their best efforts, though it’s not too frequent. But it’s enough that 2-3 times out of the year Dean is using a wheelchair because he’s busted something or relaxing around the house because he has vertigo problems every once in a while. The vertigo part is new and they’ve notified his doctor and now it’s a waiting game of adjusting medicines and treatment programs. Cas thinks his iron levels are low among other things, but he has a Ph.D. in literature, so what the fuck does he know.
Cas' gorgeous wings burned into Dean's chest, down his arms, into his hands. They burned his legs too.
Sam just wanted him to wake the fuck up so they could talk about Cas, instead of bottling it all inside. But Dean, of course,  is way too stubborn to wake up just because Sam has his 'glorious mane in tangles’, as Dean would kindly put it.
It had been four months  since Dean had woken up to what felt like a stranger's life. Their lives had changed so much, and it was hard to decide if it was good or bad. They no longer hunted, they couldn't. Dean couldn't.
The kitchen was Dean’s dream: a fancy stove, a huge, stainless steel fridge, granite countertops, and a farmer’s sink. It was beautiful, all light gray and white with a pale blue backsplash that complimented the baby blue in the living room. Altogether it gave an aura of calm over the entire room.
I hope you liked it! I get inspired by fics I read and this was inspired by a series where Cas is a single parent to Claire and starts to date Dean. Claire and Cas have this elaborate (to me) skincare routine that they get Dean into. I love it so much, it's from the 'Family of Three' series by ArielAquarial. Check it out!
hi yes please don't hate me, i procrastinated posting this because i couldn't remember the timeline for this thing but FUCK that. so so so many things have happened since March 2020 holy shitake mushroom!!! i'm a non-binary lesbian now so, it's been wild. also i apparently likely have adhd so that's a thing (it's BEEN a thing, don't let me lie). anywho, i have other chapters of this to post AND OF MY OTHER FIC (shock. awe.) so please enjoy!
AHHHH I'm so sorry for this *massive* delay. College is literally making me it's bitch, I have very little motivation and inspiration, and I'm having difficulty liking what I've written. I doubt I will ever think my writing is any good but holy moly crapola there are a lot of people who like and enjoy this fic? Like what? Why are you reading this? (tell me below, I am a little bean that needs love to grow) I am literally flabbergasted. There are 66 (lol!!!!!) subscribers right now, 107 kudos, 12 bookmarks, and 2082 have looked at it (I think that's what hits are) and that blows my mind. I never ever thought this would happen and just- holy fucking shit. I love all of you.
), then he got that glint in his eye; Dean was too far gone to really notice it. But everyone else did. Disneyland is rough as hell when your body is basically Steve Carell yelling no when your kids want to every. damn. thing. It’s rough as hell even without arthritis.
And of course, he would wait until Sam looked presentable, and smelling like fruit, to wake up. Fashionably late.
Dean really wanted to drive Baby down, she doesn’t get driven long distance much anymore because Cas worries about the Impala’s safety in car accidents with three kids and the love of his life. Besides, Dean was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis a few years ago and it really hasn’t gotten any better, so Baby’s seats aren’t comfortable on long trips for Dean. For starters, Cas has never seen Dean, or anyone for that matter, use a seatbelt in Baby; he will go to the grave still calling that a safety hazard (
I've been in a rut lately. Someone left a comment on my longer fic that made me feel bad because they didn't like it. Which, is fine, speak your mind. But please be mindful I'm not a writer for Supernatural and this is a fanfic, as well as an Alternate Universe (so is my other one), so if they seem OOC, it's because this isn't canon. But it's how I wrote it. Also, that's the first fic I've *ever* published and this is my second, so if it's rough, that's why. Sorry if I seem ranty, I've just been a little unmotivated since I saw that comment. Also, I'm not going to delete it. I always stand by my truth (dear God, I'm a booty guru) and I feel I won't be truthful if I can somehow remove that comment.
Half an hour later, Dean appears in the kitchen downstairs wrapped in his robe and bleary-eyed, clearly brought in by the smell of the bacon Cas just finished cooking.
So of course, around noon, Sam is tucking Dean in his bed and hoping Dean will actually sleep and have nice dreams. But sometimes the dreams are what he wanted with Cas and those are worse than the nightmares.
Bother me on your local shitshow of a social media site: Tumblr! The same username, just search for 'ismiratriforce', no capitals.
Anyway, in July, they drove down and spent two weeks with Sam and Co. before helping them pack up for the move. The first week they stayed in Disneyland in a hotel (remember, Sam has made the good bucks) and they had a hot tub. Dean nearly cried when he sat in it for the first time. His rheumatologist had recommended warm water therapy, so, back home, Cas had filled stockpots, the only thing Dean’s ginormous feet could fit in, with hot water and added Epsom Salt to it and they helped his feet. They did have a bathtub for Dean to soak his whole body in, but it’s a shower/tub combo and Dean is not a short human. His shoulders are pretty bad sometimes and no matter how much he wiggles, he can’t get them underwater while comfortable.
Castiel stepped out into the living room in an attempt to calm down, when he realized that Sam was not back from talking to Dean yet. So Castiel made a split-second decision.
Damn it. Dean spends way too much time indoors for it to be healthy, and Sam is getting concerned. But he hates arguing with Dean so as per usual, Sam sucks it up and lets Dean barely leave the house.
But what scared the absolute living shit out of Sam was the worse days. Dean could sometimes get out of bed, but it was into a wheelchair. If he even tried to walk, his legs would shake terribly and buckle underneath him. He couldn't even hold anything, it would fall out of his spasming, weak hand. And Dean was in such agony, there was no number to describe it. Sam saw Dean crying once, the indescribable pain was so great. Sam cried with him that day too.
“Sammy, you’re a fucking genius. God bless the Moose of California.” He’d mumbled from the corner of the tub Cas had dumped him at. Sam had looked at him amused (
Edit 2/15/2018: So after a panic attack in the middle of the night, I realized that something I had put in was not in the story and I apologize. I use Google Docs to write, then I just paste it in; I had edited offline and thought the changes had saved. It hadn't. The thing that's missing was something about Dean having oxygen. I actually had that panic months ago and I finally had the courage (and time and motivation) to change it. Sorry about that.
There was a little bench next to Dean’s door. Sam shoved Castiel down to sit on it, then plopped himself down with flailing limbs and flopping hair.
And later, when the hot tub is installed and Dean is sitting in it with Cas, Sam and Co. making supper and distracting kiddos; yeah, this is good. This is right.
I did some research into Rheumatoid Arthritis (i.e. I read the Wikipedia page) and among other things and warm water therapy is a real thing for patients and some doctors recommend using a hot tub or a jacuzzi. Some saying with supervision and if they can afford it, a personal one to avoid contamination from other people's germs. So I thought that would work for the prompt!
“I wanted to, needed to. You deserve this, you deserve more. You’re welcome.” The hand shifts from Dean’s shoulders to the short strands at the base of his head; squeezes his neck gently.
This is probably my best chapter so far in my opinion and the most emotionally heavy, I think. I literally just wrote in a day because I had a lot of time (cheers) and I think it's so good.
Taking a moment to himself, he basks in the view of his husband, who’s sleeping next to him. Through his alarm, lucky bastard. Dean always seemed to sleep through any rock so-
“Tell me, Sam, damn it!” Castiel’s hands were clenched into fists and he was holding himself back from pounding against Sam’s chest with them. He was terrified and furious at himself for leaving Dean and allowing him to get hurt. Castiel wasn’t sure if he could handle it if he was the one that had caused Dean any pain.
Dean wakes up two hours later groggier than he was this morning so Sam puts him in the recliner they have in Dean’s room angled to the window, letting Dean look into the garden. Sam sits in the other one next to Dean reading, drinking tea, and making sure Dean’s okay.
Anyway, *flips hair*. Don't really have any inspo for this so here's my gift to you. *whispers* It's a piece of shit, tbh.
I hope you enjoy it and let me know about it in the comments (I sound like a YouTuber *shudders*)! I know very little about being the army, though I did a little research, and I know nothing about alcoholism. The main inspiration for this was from various fics I've read in the past and the latest album from The Lumineers, III. Go take a listen, it's amazing to listen to and the story behind it is so good.
He’s currently on his 56th season, Cas on his 57th. But what he’s most proud of is the fact that his oldest, Claire, is in her 15th season and he’s alive to see it. She’s in the marching band, in the drama club, speech team, and is the president of the art league. God, he’s so proud.
“Hey, Cas, uh, I’m going to go tell Dean that someone wants to see him, and then I’ll come get you, alright?” Sam sounded hesitant, even afraid, as if he was worried about Dean and Cas’ well being, primarily Dean’s.
I feel so bad right now about this. But I will try to complete it. I will do my best. The draft for my art history paper is turned in and the final draft isn't due until December 3rd (*jumps in pure joy*). I just have a few midterms to do for that and then my three studios. Yay. So it may not be completed until November? Ugh, I hate myself.
When I was a kid, we would go grocery shopping on Fridays and we would eat in the restaurant there. I absolutely adore pancakes and would always ask for Minnie Mouse pancakes and they would make a Mickey Mouse head and make a bow on top with two slices of bacon and make a face with whipped cream I believe. I'd happily eat it with a lot of syrup, which I still do eat pancakes with a lot of syrup. It's one of the most favorite memories of my childhood, even though it was most often with my dad I had these pancakes.
Pushing Dean out into the hallway, he began telling Dean about what they might do that day. Maybe go outside to their little garden or down the street to the park because it's such a nice day out, wouldn't it be nice to enjoy it?
Sure, if your aesthetic is dying in a car accident and leaving a widower and three kids or severely injuring yourself more; giving yourself more disabilities. Go ahead, Cas will watch.
I’ll make you dead. Rest in peace, fucker.” He rolls over to place his back to Cas and immediately starts snoring.
I'm deeply sorry that it's now fucking December. I never meant to do this to you or myself. I'm debating on stopping here or finishing and was wondering what you thought - please let me know! Also, if you don't like implied/mentioned mpreg, sorry for that as well. I didn't know how else to write. I also updated the tags because I realized Ruby was in the massive multi-tag and I'm pretty sure I didn't write her in. If I did, I'll add her back in. I'll also add the implied mpreg (which this may be the last time I mention it) so if anyone doesn't want to read that, it'll be excluded in the ao3 filters. By the way, happy holidays? I will probably also change the title to something witty like, "Suptober 2019 (and some change)" or "Suptober 2019 that goes into November. And December. And January at this rate."  I'll try not to end up in January, luckily, break starts after next Friday (Dec. 13, currently Dec 6) and lasts a whole month. I should definitely have the time. Yay!
Dean stood from the porch swing to go down the steps, leaning on Cas heavily; he’s crying the whole way as he walks to his brother. Still crying as he tips sideways and falls into Sam’s hug.
Castiel was crying, how could he not be blamed? If he had seen the demon beforehand, this never would have happened. He and Dean could be married, maybe even had a family and retired together. But they didn’t. Pulling himself as together as much as he can, it was akin to putting shattered china back together, he asked Sam if he could go see Dean.
Dean let out a choked whine as he shifted his hips, silently begging Cas to fuck him but not sure what to expect next. He nearly collapsed from relief when he heard the cap flick open on a bottle of lube.
Watches the rivulets of sweat drip from his face to pool in his collarbones when they spar. Hands him a bottle of water and watches him drink.
Sam’s calculating eyes follow his line of sight and he only looks mildly surprised when Eileen asks candidly, “Castiel, are you jealous?”
With Cas pressed up against him like that, Dean felt every muscle in that toned, gorgeous body. His upstairs brain instantly checked out of the conversation to make way for little Dean. He’s imagining his hands peeling off that stupid trench coat and watching land on the floor in a pool at his angel’s feet. He’s stripping the rest of Cas’s clothes, ditching a trail of wool and polyester on the way to his bed. He’s picturing Cas underneath him, coming apart at the seams under Dean’s calloused hands and eager mouth. He’s so into the fantasy he nearly missed Cas’s question.
Cas’ mouth pressed soft kisses up Dean’s jawline until he reached his ear. He whispered again, his breath ghosting over Dean’s ear, sending chills down his spine.
Before Dean’s orgasm could rip through him, Cas tightly circled his fingers around the base of Dean’s cock to prevent him from coming. His fingers retreated as his mouth pulled off of Dean’s dick with a pop. One second, Dean’s about to have the best damn orgasm of his life and the next he’s just...
“Do you know how scared I was, Dean?” Cas fumed. “Hearing you pray for me, barely conscious...finding you hurt and alone?”
The future is dark no matter which path he chooses. The idea of never having Dean as a partner, as a lover and a friend — knowing that Dean wants something else, something other than Cas, that Dean knows he
Sam glanced over his shoulder, face scrunched in confusion at the lack of heavenly wrath in the backseat.
. Guests leave, so they get the best attention while they’re around. It’s a human custom. An unspoken rule.
Before long, Dean was achingly hard. He’s got 170 pounds of heavenly wrath grinding in his lap and damn if that doesn’t go straight to his dick. Dean moaned into Cas’ mouth, hands fumbling with the buttons of Cas’ shirt as the angel continued his own brand of torment.
When he’d recovered enough, Dean rolled them to the side, spooning Cas and placing feather-light kisses all over his neck and shoulders.
Before they reach the back door, Castiel swings Dean around until his back slams against the wall, knocking the wind from his body. Castiel’s eyes are alight with anger and a spark of fear courses through Dean.
If Dean thought Cas made pretty noises earlier, he certainly wasn’t prepared for the gasps and moans coming from that mouth right now. Dean palmed himself through his suddenly uncomfortably tight jeans. His mouth, still holding the piece of ice, moved to Cas’s nipples.
Cas hummed with pleasure, sending vibrations through Dean's dick. Suddenly a cold, slick finger circled Dean’s furled hole and dipped in without warning. Dean’s surprised yelp quickly turned into another groan. Cas pumped one finger in and out of Dean’s ass while his mouth and other hand worked on his cock. Before long, Dean was a panting, writhing mess.
“So anyway, I think I’ll grab a motel room and stay here for the night. I think…,” Sammy paused, causing Dean to refocus. “I think I have a few more questions for the librarian anyway.”
Dean unexpectedly reached out and grabbed the front of Cas' shirt and pulled him close, pressing their lips together in a hard, heated kiss. The angel let out a surprised squeak but melted at Dean’s touch and kissed him back fervently. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas and turned them until the angel backed up against the Impala with an
Having seen the entirety of the house in all its luxurious glory, Cas and I make our way back outside and meander over to the marble fountain.  I sit on the edge of it, breathing in the fresh air, listening to the warm breeze gently rustling the leaves on the trees all around the tranquil village.  Cas takes a seat next to me, heaving a small sigh.  I don’t hesitate to intertwine our fingers and rest our hands on my leg.
I stay silent and force myself to stare right back at his cruel face.  If this is it, if I’m going to die at his hands, then I refuse to break down and give him the satisfaction of an easy win, no matter how petrified I am.  If there’s one thing he can’t have, it’s my dignity.
Okay I'm big dumb.  I just remembered that creating a series is an option and you can subscribe to a series instead of individual stories or an account.  So there's another option LMAO.  I could file this story under a series instead since it's going to be one in the end anyway.  Sheesh I apologize if my rambling is too confusing.  I'm still a bit of a newbie when it comes to the functions of AO3.
I’m still struggling to comprehend everything that’s happening.  If it weren’t for Cas’ reassuring presence, the soothing pressure of his hand squeezing back against mine, I would be convinced I’m living in a dream, a different world.  Thinking about the past, all the crazy events we were part of throughout the course of a few weeks, makes my head spin with a flood of dizzying thoughts.  The reaping seems like centuries ago.  The tribute parade, the training, the interviews, the Games themselves, seem like centuries ago.  Even the Capitol feels so far away that it might as well be a figment of my imagination.  For a fleeting moment, I’m terrified that this
When Cas nodded, thoughtfully humming his appreciation, Dean took that as an invitation to release him from his grasp and take a step back. “Now,” Dean started with a deep breath, giving Cas’ shoulder a soft squeeze, “how about I get you that drink I promised?”
As the days trudged on, Cas’ well-being improved little by little. He kept watching movies with Dean. He kept eating the delicious soup and other easy-to-eat meals Dean prepared for him. He kept resting and taking his medicine and drinking his fluids. And whenever Dean was busy making food or generally just not paying attention, Cas would research nearby ranch houses up for sale. Most of them looked old and run-down, but truthfully, those only intrigued Cas more. The mere thought of renovating a dilapidated house in the countryside with the love of his life, making it their own, made him feel far better than any dose of medicine.
“What can you do?”  My burlap sack has reached its breaking point, so we start piling the seed heads into Charlie’s.  “It’s out of our control.  You’re doing everything you can right now, and that’s keeping me distracted, even if it’s just for a few minutes.”
The next time I wake up, it’s early evening.  I was out almost the entire day.  Shadows pool onto the ground, line the walls of the hollow.  The nighttime birds begin their songs.  Insects chirp and buzz.  The hot, muggy air has started to cool off.  The pain in my head is almost unbearable, still throbbing with every heartbeat.  My stiff and sore body aches more than ever.
Right. Pushing the past away, Sam quickly put the braces on Dean’s legs and back. He wasn’t going to walk today, but having the braces helped with managing Dean’s pain levels and Sam would do anything to help his brother. Gently placing Dean in his wheelchair after checking the oxygen, which Dean had playfully named ‘Little Impala’, he grabbed Dean’s glasses off the nightstand and carefully arranged them on Dean’s face, adjusting the nasal cannula underneath. Sam beamed at Dean, who weakly smiled back.
Sam let out a big breath and ran his hands through his hair. “Alright, um. When you were stabbed, I guess you started to fall and Dean caught you. You told him to let go, but he ignored you. When your grace burned and your wings flared out, Dean got severe burns on his torso, arms, and legs. I took him to a hospital.” Castiel looked at Sam in surprise because for them hospitals tended to be the last resort. Neither had been to one in years. “I had to, there was no other choice. It was more than what we normally could handle, and it was pretty bad for a bit. He was unconscious for three days and when he woke up - God, Cas, God - it was-it-it was like he wasn’t the Dean I remembered. I thought he was okay, but then the pain started and there was a week, one week where he was fine, but at the end of that week, something happened inside his body overnight. I'm not sure what happened, but when I visited I had to call the nurses because he was in too much pain to even reach the call button. After that they put him on so much pain medication he was barely functional. Cas, his pain is chronic. How bad it is depends on the day or how much he’s worked himself up. And, he has scars, scars in the shape of your wings. I know you wanted him to let go, but Dean is stubborn, he didn’t want you to die alone. He wanted you to feel loved in your final moments. Don’t blame yourself for any of this, you are not at fault for Dean’s injuries, got it?”
“Now that I have your attention, let’s chat,”  Cresh sneers.  He’s so much heavier than he looks.  “So tell me, Winchester, where’s your boyfriend?  It’s not like you to go anywhere without him.  I was hoping this could be a party of three.”
Caesar Flickerman has been the host for as long as I can remember, and it shows.  His skin has faint traces of wrinkles, but clearly the advanced techniques of Capitol surgery have kept him as young as they can.  Despite the faded lines on his face and the near-imperceptible bags beneath his eyes, his energy and enthusiasm is far from old and aged.  He always changes his color theme for his hair and suit every year, too, and this year, it looks like he’s decided on a pastel green.
I still remember the first day I met her.  It was out here in these fields, a day or two after she’d essentially harassed the granary owner into letting her work.  She was set on harvesting her first set of seed heads by herself but didn’t quite know where to snap them off.  I happened to be in the area, so I offered to show her the best place to snap them.  After a short lesson, she’d already gotten the hang of it.  I was about to leave when she called out to me and asked if I wanted to be friends.  I barely knew anything about her, of course, other than her bravery and tenacity, but she seemed like an interesting person.  Who was I to deny her harmless request?
The two of us continue down the row of wheat stalks collecting seed heads as the breeze picks up and the sun’s intensity bears down on us.  It’s getting hotter by the minute, but with someone here to keep me company, the heat doesn’t seem quite as insufferable.
“Lucky for you, I brought an extra bag.”  A proud glimmer shining in her eyes, Charlie unrolls another burlap sack and opens it up.  “Man, where would you be without me, Winchester?”
As he stood and stretched the sleepiness out of his muscles, Dean spared a glance at the alarm clock on his nightstand. It was just past seven in the morning. Surely Sam was already up. Hell, he’d probably gone out for a jog
It’s not always like Charlie to get sentimental, but I appreciate it nonetheless.  It’s reassuring to hear that you’re doing the right thing, and that you’re doing it well, too.  I don’t really have a choice in the matter considering my family’s circumstances, but it doesn’t bother me in the slightest.  I like my work, and it promises them food.  What more could I possibly ask for?
Ten years ago—I think, but I was still a bit too young to remember for sure—following the death of President Snow, the next president proposed a new rule to spice up the Hunger Games.  We thought it was going to be something terrible, but as it turned out, she just wanted to allow two victors to win if they came from the same district.  Something about supporting new alliances and persuading teamwork and whatnot.  I don’t mind it—it’s definitely better than having to kill someone from your home—but it doesn’t change the fact that you’re still forced to participate in a televised fight to the death.  It just slightly increases your chances of winning, and I mean ever so slightly.
Cas goes to his room to change out of his pajamas.  These thirty minutes are bound to fly by, so I make haste to change into something presentable.  I’m in the middle of rinsing off my blotchy face when Cas returns.  Thankfully, the cold water evens out the color of my skin, little by little, but then I wonder if it’s even worth it.  There’s no doubt I’ll be crying at the train station again when we’re reunited with our families.  Still, I suppose it doesn’t hurt to start with a clean slate.
“I’m freezing,” Cas practically whimpered. His shivering was getting worse, more violent, and he couldn’t ignore the thin layer of sweat gathering at his hairline. It didn’t make sense, considering how cold he was, but he knew he felt awful and strange and queasy, and he wanted it to stop.
What little adrenaline that began to subside when I realized I was safe and sound instantly makes a return, this time much stronger than before.  I push myself upright.  I think I’ve stopped breathing.  Only thirty minutes until we’re back in District 9.  Only thirty minutes until we can see our families again.  Only thirty minutes to prepare for what comes next, and I’m struggling to decide if I’m beyond ready or wildly unprepared.
I’m not sure what happens then.  Some animalistic survival instinct takes over, completely overwhelms me.  Maybe a bit of anger and hatred, too, for everything he did to me.  I stab him again and again and again, long after I hear the cannon signaling his death.  And I don’t stop until I look down and see all the splattered blood that isn’t mine covering my hands.
“Well, where is he?” Sam asked, his laptop and newspaper now completely abandoned in favor of worrying about his friend.
My stomach churns when a wicked smirk twists its way onto Cresh’s expression.  “Wait, let me guess,”  he says, taking the cold knife away from my throat to sweep a strand of hair from my forehead.  The sharp blade hovers dangerously close to my eye.  “He’s sick, isn’t he?  That’s why you were here rummaging around like a bull in a china shop.  Looking for medicine, I presume?  How sweet.  Such a shame he’ll never get it.”
This is it.  This is where it all ends.  He’s going to torture me until I die, and I won’t be able to return to the hollow with the medicine like I promised.
It’s not that I absolutely despise living in District 9.  It has its perks, like the beauty of the rolling hills and open fields, for example.  It’s just difficult and scary at times, what with always having to fear whether or not you’re going to get to eat every day.  As a kid, I always wondered why our people are constantly struggling to get enough food if we’re the main source of grains for the entirety of Panem and the Capitol.  Turns out, we don’t get to keep a lot of the grains we harvest.  It just gets shipped straight to the Capitol.  I think that’s where my abhorrence for that bizarre, far-off place began.
“It’s like you read my mind,” Dean said with a grin, drumming his fingers on the edge of the counter. He was sure Sam knew he was teasing, but he still wanted to make sure his brother knew that his offer was greatly appreciated. “Thanks, Sam. Really. I guess I’m just a little overwhelmed with this. I’m not sure what to do.”
I rest my hand on the small of Cas’ back as we make our way toward the end of the station.  The cameras follow us, although they do keep their distance now.  I’m glad.  My legs are wobbling so much that I’m afraid I might trip and stumble to the pavement.  That would be embarrassing.
I struggle to open my eyes, focus my foggy vision on the boy sitting on top of me.  No, I can’t let myself slip under, no matter how desperately my broken body wants to.  I can barely think through the torment that’s overwhelming me, but I have just enough willpower left to remember what I was doing.
As the collector takes our burlap sacks away to the storage room and Charlie heads home after giving me another tight hug, I feel a pair of eyes looking at me, boring into the side of my face.  Turning around, I see a dark-haired boy my age watching me from the edge of the field, not paying one bit of attention to the wheat stalk he’s trying to harvest.  The moment our gazes meet, however, he instantly drops his head and returns his focus back to the seed heads.
But no, none of those things are what roused me.  When I completely come to, when my numb senses struggle to return to normal, my blurry vision focuses on Cas, his concerned expression as he crawls to kneel at my side.
But when we push the gate open and step into the village, its appearance is nothing like the letters would allude to.  Although the cobblestone path is cracked in places, it’s still rather intact and spans the stretch of the village.  Twelve massive houses—more like mansions, really—line the path.  Six on one side, and six on the other.  They tower so high and look so pristine and untouched that I can’t stop my jaw from dropping at the sight.  All of them are dark and silent, seeing as no one else lives here except for Bobby, but that does nothing to alter their grandeur.  I haven’t even stepped inside, and I already know that I could probably fit three of my family’s old houses into one of these mansions.  I can only imagine what waits for us inside.
Bobby appears again, reminding us we have even less time to get to the Justice Building than before, and we have to leave Charlie by the train station.  As we turn to follow our mentor for the second time, she tells us she’ll be right down front, cheering her head off for us throughout the ceremony.  Coming from Charlie, I’ll expect nothing less.
The back room, at the far end of the corridor, is a posh study, filled with bookcases and plush chairs and a stationery desk and fancy windows so tall that it lights up the room with a warm glow.  Cas perks up when he sees all those books.  I remember him saying he likes to read, so he must be in hog heaven in this little library.  Maybe now that we have time, I’ll have to get back into reading, too.  Suddenly I’m giddy at the thought of us sitting in this study together, cuddled up in one of the chairs, sharing a book while it rains outside.  Yes, that sounds perfect.
As I search, I see a lone sword tucked away in the corner of the Cornucopia.  It isn’t as long as the ones I practiced with during training, but I don’t hesitate to grab it.  I might need it for later.  There’s a clean knife on the ground, too.  I take it for Cas.
“Thank you, Sam,” Cas said, quite frankly in awe of the assortment before him, but Sam wasn’t done just yet. He was still digging out one more thing from the grocery bags.
The sweltering sun beats down on my back.  I can feel the sweat rolling over my hot skin.  There isn’t a single cloud in the cerulean sky, nor is there any shade for me to cool off under.  It has to be one of the hottest days of the year, yet here I am, snapping off wheat seed heads with my scratched up hands like my life depends on it.
As usual, the score reveal starts with District 1 and works toward District 12.  I’m not surprised when Cresh pulls a high score of ten.  I must clench my fists without realizing, too, because my attention is startled away from the television when Cas gently pats my forearm.
Now it’s my turn to decide on an approach.  I’m fresh out of ideas, so I won’t be of assistance.  I’m not bold and arrogant like the Careers.  I’m not hilarious or witty.  I’m certainly not flirtatious or coy like Rowena seems to think so.  I’m just me, plain and simple.  I don’t know how we’re supposed to translate that into a specific behavior for the audience, the deranged people who will practically be leaning out of their seats to get to know us before they watch us fight to the death on live television the following morning.
It’s about a twenty minute walk from the Justice Building to the village.  I’ve never been there myself, but I know of its location, the peacefully secluded area surrounded by lush trees and colorful flowers.  When Cas and I reach the old iron gate protecting it from the rest of the district, I find myself gazing up at the once-golden metal letters spelling out
Charlie and I are about halfway through the row.  The main building where we store our harvested grains is steadily coming into view.
With a deep, shuddering sigh, hoping to ready myself for what’s to come, I nod my head.  “We shall.”
But as the reality of the situation begins to fully sink in, I realize just how conflicted I feel.  “I’m not sure,”  I admit to him.  I’m ready to see my family.  I’m ready to be home and far away from the Capitol.  But am I ready to live a relatively normal life again after everything that happened miles behind us?  That I’m unsure of, and it’s unsettling me.
Once Dean filled up another glass of water, he started the short trip back to his room, significantly cooled off and feeling much more awake than before. And thankfully, when he opened the door and tiptoed back inside his dark room, Cas was still asleep. In fact, he’d hardly moved an inch during Dean’s absence, and he remained virtually motionless aside from the rising and falling of his chest as Dean quietly set the new glass of water on the nightstand, right next to the empty one.
Beside him, he heard Dean try and fail to stifle a sleepy chuckle. “Oh, man, I forgot you’ve never had a human sickness before,” he remarked, the amusement clear in his tone.
To an outsider, her words might seem harsh, but I’ve known Charlie for years.  We poke fun at each other all the time, and seeing her flash me a smirk as we near the end of the row only solidifies that layer of our friendship.
“Dean, you’re a wild card,”  is what he ends up saying.  I don’t know if I should relax yet or not.  “You were valiant when you volunteered for your brother.  You were ferocious and slightly risqué at the parade—well, both of you were.  You seemed diffident before training started, but then you got yourself into a fight with a strong Career tribute and stood your ground.  Then you managed to pull a nine for your training score, and on top of it all, it seems you have a soft spot for your district partner.  I don’t know what direction to take with you.”
“Of course,”  she replies.  “You really think I’d abandon you and my favorite little adopted brother on the most stressful day of the year?  Not my style, Winchester.  That’s just cold.”
OR if you just want to check back in from time to time and skip the subscriptions altogether, that's totally cool too!  Do whatever's easiest for you!  I'm not here to pressure you into doing anything.  I'm just here to entertain with my words :)
My mother has never worked a day in the fields in her life and probably never will.  She made and sold jewelry when she was younger, and although she still does when the materials are handy, it’s not always enough to support us and put food on the table.  Materials and metals are nearly impossible to come by, and even if she manages to sell a ring here or a necklace there, it’s so spread out that the money is gone long before she makes another sale.
Cas groaned, flopping over onto his back as the realization washed over him. A fever. Of course. The uncomfortable chills, the ache in his body, the building pressure in his head. He should’ve known. They were the classic symptoms of a fever. But then again, as an angel, he never had to worry about getting sick. He’d experienced some terrible supernatural maladies before, sure, but a human fever? This was new to him, and he already hated it.
As I turn around and accept a firm hug from Cas’ father, I see my parents sandwiching Cas in a hug of their own.  I can’t help but smile at the sight.  They kiss his head, rub his back, shower him in just as much appreciation and gratitude as his parents are with me.  The air is ripe with love and affection, and I’m not taking a second of it for granted.
Trying my best to focus on the tranquility of the wheat field, I toss a handful of seed heads into the burlap sack at my feet.  It’s starting to get full.  Just a few more rows of stalks, and I can call it quits for today.  I’ve probably sweat out every last bit of water in my aching body by now.
Cresh retrieves another knife from a belt on his waist.  This one looks even sharper than the other.  “Now, where were we?”  he muses, his sadistic grin returning.  “Maybe we should cut up your lips next.  No more kissing your boyfriend for you.”
“Amazing, darling!”  Rowena gushes.  I can’t hate her, though.  She’s just doing her job, trying her best to make sure we do well for the audience.  “All the ladies are going to go
“Ugh, gross,” Sam said, wrinkling his nose, but despite his exterior display of disgust, there was no hiding the faint twinkle of amusement in his eyes. “All right, I get it, I get it. I’ll leave you guys to it. Holler if you need anything.” He managed to make it to the door with the rest of the groceries in hand before he whirled around and pointed an accusatory finger at Dean, who was still buried in the crook of Cas’ neck, pressing kisses to the sensitive skin, this time because he wanted to and not just to scare Sam off. “And don’t get up to anything crazy. Cas needs to rest.
“Breakfast,” Sam proclaimed with a grin, handing Dean a container with two blueberry muffins inside. He then pulled a shiny red apple from the bag and gave it to Cas. “Just a little something-something to put in your stomach since you probably don’t feel too great. I’m sure you’ll be able to bug Dean into making you some soup later, anyway.”
I fight to keep myself awake and conscious as I move my right arm back toward the pocket on my leg.  I stare Cresh down the entire time I do so.
Bobby stares at the two of us for a while, rubbing his chin and seeming to be deep in thought.  “I’m trying to decide how to present you both,”  he finally muses.  “Castiel, you’re shy and quiet but clearly pack a punch with those knives.  We could either go down that route and present you as reserved and fierce, or we could just play the timid card the entire time because a lot of people find that adorable.”
“I hope so.” With one hand, Cas pulled another blanket off the back of the couch and threw it over Dean’s legs, then made haste to nestle against him. Dean was always so comfortingly warm and cuddlesome. It was amusing, and silly, but Cas couldn’t help but feel like a cat sometimes, always morphing into whatever shape he had to in order to curl up right next to Dean. But it was lovely, and Dean never objected. “Are you ready?”
had breakfast already, because he was one of those kinds of people. The kind Dean sometimes wished he could be, but sleeping in was something he just couldn’t bring himself to sacrifice, especially now that he had someone to always wake up wrapped around. That was definitely a big part of it.
“Only a few more minutes until we’re back home,”  Bobby says, letting himself into the room.  I don’t mind, though.  After all the effort he went through to help keep us alive, he can do whatever he wants.  “How are you boys feeling?”
Congratulations!  You've reached the end of the story!  First off, I just want to thank you all profusely for taking the time to read this.  This story has 100% been my comfort story during the first half of 2020.  I probably would've gone insane without it.  I started writing it in January, finished it in May, and finished uploading the chapters here in September.  Every step of the process has brought so much happiness and joy to my life, and part of it has been all thanks to you lovely people!  So thank you so much!! (and prepare to hear that a lot throughout the course of this final update)
Great.  Now I’m just angry.  Why is this interview even necessary?  It’s three minutes of pointless questions.  Why should we waste our time making ourselves look pretty and presentable just to please the people who will only be cheering for our deaths the next day?  I know it helps with attracting sponsors, but it’s disgusting.  They’ll pretend to like us then, but that will undoubtedly change in a heartbeat when someone bigger, someone stronger, strikes us down in a clash of weapons and brutality.  They cheer for bloodshed, not who we are as humans.
all a dream, and I’m going to wake up in my room in the Training Center, prepping to head to the arena all over again.
It only took a second for Dean to react, but even that felt far too long. He scrambled to flip over and turn the alarm clock around so the numbers couldn’t be seen, then hurried to pull the trembling Cas into his chest. “It’s okay, sweetheart. The time doesn’t matter,” Dean soothed, but he struggled to mask the crack in his voice when Cas’ hot tears instantly soaked into his shirt. “Don’t worry about the time. We can sleep in. We’re not going anywhere tomorrow. We can stay in bed all day if you want, yeah? How does that sound?”
When Cas made no effort to move again, completely drained and exhausted from all the coughing and shivering, Dean gingerly carded his fingers through Cas’ damp hair. “I’ll go get you something to drink,” he said at last. “And maybe bully Sam into going out to get you some medicine. Medicine will make you feel better, too.”
As weeks worth of stress and uncertainty finally begin to melt away, I can’t help but chuckle.  “I promised I would, didn’t I?”
Panic overwhelms me.  Everything is happening so fast.  Cresh is still writhing on the ground, my switchblade protruding from his stomach, and I hear pounding footsteps approaching.  My left hand is still pinned to the earth.  I can’t move it, can’t get away from the scene before the other boy from District 1 finds me.
Silence.  I stare him down, ever so slightly slide my arm toward the pocket on my right leg.  This time I barely even flinch when he cuts open the skin just beside my eye.
The softness in Dean’s voice gave Cas the courage to glance up; what he was met with was a shimmer of pure sympathy and care in Dean’s beautiful green eyes, a shimmer so bona fide and gentle that it almost made Cas want to cry. “I love you,” Cas borderline whispered, squeezing Dean’s hand.
“Dean!”  my little brother Sam cries, and no, it’s not a hallucination, because I see him running toward me, arms outstretched and face slick with tears and moving as fast as his legs can carry him.
So yeah!  I think that about wraps it up.  Let me know if you want to stay subscribed to this story so I can publish a sequel notification chapter in the future, or if you just want to subscribe to my account so you get notified whenever I publish something new.  Or if you're not interested in a sequel and don't want to do either, then no biggie!  You do you :)
My trembling fingers wrap around the hilt of the switchblade as Cresh traces my lips with the tip of the knife.  I slide it out of my pocket.
Something about the way she throws her arms around and squeezes the life out of a wide-eyed Cas makes a delighted laugh bubble up in my throat.  He looks so startled, so shocked by her unexpected embrace, but it doesn’t take long for him to relax and return the gesture.  Seeing the two of them together after I told Cas in the arena that he and Charlie would be great friends makes me smile so wide that my cheeks hurt.
So Dean laid there, motionless, listening to the quiet sound of Cas’ raspy breathing, sincerely hoping his angel was sleeping well, until finally the heat became too unbearable to ignore. Pressing his lips together in an attempt to keep himself from making any noise, Dean slowly wriggled out of Cas’ slack grip on him and got out of bed, mercifully not disturbing Cas in the process. He was still out, a thin trail of drool pooling beneath his cheek, and he stayed that way even as Dean crept toward the door and slipped out of the room, into the blissful coolness of the hallway outside.
Cas shrugged, glancing back and forth between his nightstand and Dean’s until his narrowed eyes finally focused on the fresh glass of water. He swallowed down a few big gulps, drew as big of a breath as he could without risking another coughing fit, then returned his attention to Dean. He still looked half-asleep and rather out of it—probably exhausted from the unpleasant night, too—so that gave Dean an idea.
Before he turned to make his way to the kitchen to get Cas a fresh glass of water for when he woke up, Dean cast Sam a teasing grin. “You sure you’re doing okay, being left alone for this long?”
The hallway outside was cold and barren, just like usual. Another perk of the ridiculous bunny slippers was that they kept Dean’s feet warm from the frigid tile and concrete of the bunker. Especially now that winter was on its way, Dean was becoming increasingly more grateful for them and all of their adorable absurdity. The sound of them scuffling across the floor was the only sound in the otherwise silent corridor as Dean continued toward the kitchen, where he usually found Sam drinking a cup of freshly brewed coffee or one of his bizarre health drinks. Dean didn’t catch a whiff of the delectable aroma of coffee from down the hall, so it must have been a health drink morning.
your water,” Dean said with a grin. “Now go. Shoo. I want a movie loaded up and ready to go by the time I get there.”
“Man, I feel like it’s been forever since I’ve seen you!”  Cresh chuckles.  He’s coming back, tossing the fallen containers aside to reach me.  I don’t have time to think.  I grab one with shaking hands and hurl it at his chest, try to scramble away before he can get me and hurt me and kill me like he’s wanted to since the beginning.
“Hey, you don’t have to apologize,” Dean interrupted, but his tone was anything but harsh. “I remember how miserable I was the first time I had the flu. I was unbearable. And I was
It turned out to be a great plan, and an even better day. After Cas won the battle against his initial morning fatigue, Dean helped him take a new dose of daytime medicine, which went to work on making Cas feel better much quicker than he expected. By the time he’d eaten the piece of butter toast Dean had made and brought to him, his incessant urge to cough had decreased drastically. And it was easier than ever to ignore his aching body when Dean set his laptop on the foot of the bed and loaded up
I return his smile, so overwhelmed with emotion that I’m not sure how to process any of it.  I stay leaning against his forehead, trying to let everything soak in, trying to let my mind slow down and take in what’s happening.
Dean shrugged, humming a quick noise of nonchalance as he rubbed Cas’ arm. “Eh, even if I do, it won’t be the first time I’ve had a fever,” he reassured. “Don’t spend your energy worrying about me, sweetheart. I’ll be okay.”
Thinking about him makes another confusing burst of warmth trickle through my body.  He said he liked me, more than a friend.  I think about all the times I caught him looking at me, all the embraces where he held onto me like he never wanted to let me go.  And the way he dodged Caesar Flickerman’s question about if he had feelings for any of the tributes.  I was probably the answer.  I suppose I had an inkling, deep down in my subconscious, that there was something more to the glint in his eyes whenever we exchanged smiles, spent time together, but nothing could’ve prepared me to hear those intimate words come directly from him in such a grave moment.
“Hey, he won’t have to bug me,” Dean protested when Sam shared an arch glance with Cas. “I was already planning on making soup, because I
Cas must sense my nerves.  As the Peacekeepers send us on our way, he slips his hand into mine and flashes me the most reassuring smile he can muster up.  But I know he’s nervous, too.  I can see the uneasiness glimmering behind his eyes.  This is the first time in weeks that we’ve been free to do whatever we please without being toyed with like puppets on a string.  Now the strings have finally been cut, but with it almost comes a sense of helplessness.  While we’re not entirely free—no victor ever is—there’s no longer a schedule controlling our lives.  So what do we do?  How do we spend our time?  How do we start living normally again when a couple weeks ago, we were terrified we would never even leave the arena where twenty-two other boys met their ends?  It’s all so overwhelming.  I don’t know how to wrap my head around it.
Ten wasn’t too bad, Dean thought, lifting his shoulders in a shrug when his foggy brain processed what Sam said. “Cas did,” he muttered, upset by the mere memory of how miserable Cas had been. “He was up coughing his lungs out until three.”
No matter how many times Dean heard Cas tell him that, it never failed to make his heartbeat quicken and his stomach do all kinds of somersaults. Once a statement uttered before a thankfully impermanent but nevertheless terrifying goodbye, and now a statement uttered spontaneously throughout their day-to-day lives, always relaxed and carefree and full of genuine warmth and devotion. Sometimes it still boggled Dean’s mind that the fantasy he always dreamed about was actually real, and he was living it right now.
Since there weren’t many people working in the fields today, Charlie and I receive extra for braving the intense heat and bringing in a couple of hefty burlap sacks full of seed heads.  It isn’t much, just a few small loaves of bread and a ration ticket to trade in the market for a generous serving of lamb stew and a can of beans, but we’ll take anything we can get.
“I’ll ask again,”  Cresh goes on.  Suddenly I’m not afraid of the knife he has pressed against the side of my face.  Newfound determination courses through me, stimulates my numbed senses.  “Where’s your boyfriend?  If you tell me where he is, I promise I’ll make your death a tiny bit quicker.”
Where he was going, Dean wasn’t entirely sure, but he kept walking until he reached the library, hoping and hoping that Cas wouldn’t wake up while he was out cooling off. As he stepped into the library, he found Sam sitting at the table, his laptop open in front of him and a newspaper sprawled out beside the lamp.
Side note for future readers: If you're reading this when the sequel has been published, there'll be a link somewhere in this chapter!  Probably at the beginning so it grabs your attention.  We'll see when the time comes :)
“Good idea. Staying hydrated is one of the best things you can do when you’re sick,” Sam agreed. He drained the last little bit of his health drink, then stood to set it in the sink. “I could run out and pick up some medicine, too. I know you probably want to stay here with him, and I need to make a supply run anyway, so…”
do. Keep him hydrated. Make him some soup. Cuddle with him. You know, lovey-dovey boyfriend things.”
Cas just stared back at him, silent, contemplating his words, eyebrows ever so slightly furrowed with confusion. Much to Dean’s dismay, Cas didn’t seem to be picking up what he was putting down. That meant Dean was just going to have to come right out and say it, regardless of how heavy his tongue felt in his dry mouth.
If looks could kill, Dean probably would’ve been obliterated on the spot. Cas stared him down with the nastiest glare, his indignant eyes narrowed into dangerous slits and his jaw clenched and his nostrils flared. He looked, quite frankly, ready to murder for a cup of coffee, and while Dean understood where he was coming from—he got cranky without his coffee, too—he didn’t want to risk dehydrating Cas when his sick body needed all the fluids it could get.
Rowena is on her feet again.  The congratulatory praises echo through the air, and I give a wide-eyed Cas a hefty pat on the shoulder.  We both pulled great scores for people who just started training a few days ago.  Being fast learners has its perks, doesn’t it?  I’m proud of him for braving the weapons and stepping out of his comfort zone.  He should’ve gotten a higher score than me for his incredible accuracy with the knives, but an eight is still remarkable.  He deserves it.
Dean practically inhaled his muffin as the movie played on. Cas, on the other hand, ate more slowly, his upset stomach not doing him any favors. He kept drinking his water as much as he could, taking the juicy apple one bite at a time, then munching on the muffin in between. By the time he finally finished his food and water, he was only feeling marginally better. He was still shivering, albeit much less aggressively. He was still nauseated. His head still hurt, and his body still ached, and he was so dejected that he felt that way that he wanted to completely curl up into Dean’s side and go right back to sleep. He didn’t even want the last few sips of Dean’s coffee anymore. That was how he knew it was bad.
Hi. Hello. I just wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly grateful I am for the insane amount of love and support I've received on this story so far. Wednesdays and Saturdays have become my favorite days of my normally crappy weeks because I love putting out new chapters for all of you amazing people. Seriously. Every single time I get a new comment, my mood is boosted for the rest of the day. It makes me ridiculously happy to know that so many of you are enjoying this story that I love so much. It means the world to me and more.
Thankfully, our lighthearted conversation returns.  Some of the tension built up in my heavy chest ebbs away as we share another chuckle.
When Bobby turns his attention to me, a wave of apprehension swarms my mind.  Don’t say provocative.  Don’t say provocative.
There are small numbers inscribed on both of our keys, and the numbers match the ones adorning the grand columns in front of the houses.  But, since almost all of them look identical on the outside, we decide to just check out the interior of mine.  We walk along the cobblestone path, passing by a beautiful marble fountain that doesn’t appear to be active—or at least not currently—and trek up the front steps to my new home.
Rowena starts off our session by making us walk lines in the living room so she can adjust our posture and correct our footing to make it look like we’re sauntering with self-assurance.
So when Dean, saddened by how miserable Cas still looked, didn’t hesitate to crack open the seal on the bottle of DayQuil—Sam’s advice be damned—Cas gratefully took the little plastic cup that came with the bottle. Dean poured the correct dosage into the cup, then with a faint trace of a smile, told Cas, “Bottoms up, buddy.”
Cas’ face flashes on the screen next; everyone quiets down in an instant.  “And Castiel Novak, from District Nine, with a score of…”
Dean, still half-asleep and his eyes so squinted they might as well have still been shut, didn’t seem fazed. “Then c’mere,” he mumbled, blindly reaching out to pull Cas closer to him.
I don’t have long to decipher his meaning.  He looks to Cas again, whose face is ever so slightly tinted pink.  “I think endearing and bashful will work well for you, especially if we sprinkle in just a bit of confidence and ferocity to spice things up.  How does that sound?”
And on the right, formatted identically to my locket, is a picture of me.  I barely even recognize myself.  I look so much younger, so much happier, more at peace than I’m sure I do now.
The pain is immediate and beyond excruciating.  A long, howling scream rips apart my throat.  My eyes squeeze shut, head tilts back as the sound of my own scream echoes in my ringing ears.  Hot blood gushes out of my punctured hand.  I can’t move it.  It’s pinned to the earth by the knife.  My entire arm has gone numb, consumed by unbearable agony.
So, I'll be back for the next update on Saturday, July 11! Until then, hang in there, stay frosty, all that jazz. Love you <3
He asks us some of the same questions Rowena did so we can practice our new attitudes, but I end up snapping most of the answers back at him.  I don’t mean to.  My mind is just crowded with thoughts of the audience and how sick they are in the head for encouraging things like this.  I’m not mad at him or Cas.  I hope they don’t take my sudden hostility the wrong way, so I try everything I can to push my feelings aside so I don’t turn this entire practice session into a sour environment.
Cas rolled his eyes, but a smile stretched across his face nonetheless. “Any requests?” he asked as he backed up into the hallway and stuffed his hands into the pockets of the hoodie.
“Speaking of late sleepers,” Sam went on, completely ignoring Dean’s remark—as per usual—as Dean filled the pot with water and measured out a good amount of coffee grounds, “where’s your better half? Usually he gets up with you, or at least around the same time.”
Probably taking the day off to prepare for what’s happening tomorrow.  I can’t lie and say I didn’t consider it, too, but I can’t afford to skip a day of work.  I can’t afford to miss filling my quota and not receiving my much-needed payment of food and money.
With that thought in mind, and with heat flooding his cheeks, Dean’s face split into a soft, doting smile as he turned to glance back at Cas lying in his bed. “Love you more.”
“Well, they should do something about that,” Cas grumbled, another short coughing fit making his whole body tremble. “And it isn’t working, either. Did Sam get the right stuff?”
I think I did really well.  I was nervous and botched the first few sets of moves, but after that, after I brushed off the initial jitters of being watched and judged, I showed those people I’m not someone to be messed with.  I’m pleased with what I did down there.
At first Cas didn’t say anything—Dean just assumed he’d nodded—but then he spoke up as Dean grabbed the doorknob, his voice already sounding small and thrashed. “I love you.”
