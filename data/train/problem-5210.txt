“I don’t see what you could possibly have, but I’ll entertain you.” Dean gave a small smile before walking to the trunk of the chevy and popping it open. Castiel watched as he pulled out a false bottom and saw the gleam and glitter of weapons in the moonlight. Dean reached knowingly through his items before he picked up a bag of something and closed up the trunk, keys clanging together as he quickly locked it. He came back with a bag of what looked like salt.
“How did he die?” Castiel gave an askance look to Dean, but kept his head forward to look out the windshield. The city was behind them now and he could see they were a few streets at most from the church.
“I don’t recall.” Sam stood up and went to the kitchen. He made Cas a quick sandwich which mainly consisted of peanut butter since Dean had slowly depleted the jam supply. Cas thanked the Winchester and began to eat. Cas licked his fingers of the peanut butter and was surprised to find it so sticky. It’s made of peanuts, but no butter Cas had ever seen was this sticky and bitter tasting. He wondered why they felt a need to lie to the masses about the name of a product. He thought that ‘liquid peanuts’ was a better name. Humans. He finished it off and Sam was staring at him with a curious glance. Cas felt better, but his eyes were droopy and felt dry. He rubbed at his eyes, but that didn’t help.
“Good night, Cas. And happy new year.” Cas gave a small smile before nodding slowly.
“What?” He turned to face Sam. Sam stared at his brother.
“We should check out that hallway, while Dean stays here and keeps watch.” His mouth moved on its own despite him resisting the movement. Dean gave Sam a funny look but turned around and scouted out the area. Cas moved stiffly as Sam led the way to the hallway. Cas tried to resist, but each time he did the pain tripled. He watched as Sam checked the few rooms that were there. Cas tried to fight it once again and this time he got half a second of free will. “Sam-!” Sam turned around, but Cas lost control again and pointed to one room that they had already checked. “I thought I saw something move in there.” Sam tilted his head but walked over anyways. He stepped in and looked around. Cas could feel the joy from whatever was controlling him. He thought about Dean and how he would feel if something happened to Sam and Cas fought for control. He managed to blink his eyes. Sam turned around to come out of the room, but just as he was about to leave a large black shape emerged from the ground and towered over Sam with snarling teeth. Cas took his last bit of energy he had and fought against the pain and launched himself at Sam. The monster dived down, and Cas shoved Sam behind him as the Inugami opened its mouth as wide as possible. Cas didn’t have time to attack before the sharp pain of teeth dug into his throat and pulled back, its mouth dripping with blood and Cas falling to his knees. Sam threw his rocks at the Inugami and it snapped its jaws at the incoming projectiles, but it got hit in the head and made a mechanical howling noise. It disappeared into a cloud of smoke. As it disappeared the room shook, sending rubble down on Cas and Sam.
“Tell me what you request, Dean.” The gravel in Cas’ voice was thicker as he could see sweat start to trickle from his hair line.
“We’ve been catching up at Bobby’s when I’m not off with Bobby taking hunts, or I’m working on cars for some cash.” Castiel remembered the large sum of cash that appeared in the offer plate one day after his sermon. Castiel could tell from how it was given and from spending time with the man that if he brought it up he probably would have denied any accusation thrown his way. Instead Castiel found himself staring dead center of Dean’s chest. The light of his soul flickering as he spoke about various things. Dean got quiet all of the sudden and Castiel caught his eyes. He was staring at Cas with a apprehensive glance. “What?” Cas looked back down at his chest before back to his eyes. Dean followed his eyes, staring down at his chest then back to Cas’ eyes.
“Sam, move.” It was the first acknowledgment to either of them since news of the sister. Cas watched the exchange with a weary glance.
“Tell me.” Dean took a moment to stare at Cas. He seemed to be processing what it was Castiel wanted from him. Dean finally stood and Castiel led him out of the booth. He was nearly overwhelmed by Dean’s closeness and the smell of him filling his senses. He turned and led him back to his kitchen. Castiel pointed to the kitchen table which Dean took as invitation to sit down at. Castiel filled up his kettle and set it on the stove to warm up. He sat in the chair opposite of Dean. His kitchen table was so small if he reached his legs out he would have them tangled into Dean’s. He instead tucked them under his chair, his hands twitched to hold onto something and he tried not to let his eyes linger on Dean’s hands for too long.
“The owner of the first dog said her dog would bark at something in her backyard, but when he went out to see who it was there was nobody back there.” Sam pointed out a diner and Dean pulled in. “Eventually the dog stopped barking but would run to that same area of the backyard.” They all exited the car and hurried to get into the diner. They didn’t want to get stuck in the heat. When they entered everyone’s, head turned to them. They looked suspicious of the newcomers. Dean, Sam, and Cas were hushed into a booth. Cas and Dean squeezed into the old booth that smelt like lemon pledge and Sam stretched out opposite of them. Soon the diner mates were eating once again, but if Dean looked around, a few of the people would stare blankly, almost accusingly at them.
“No.” Castiel waited a moment to see if Dean would expand anymore on that, but after a short silence he figured that was all he would get.
“I don’t see why not.” Dean seemed to visibly relax. Castiel wanted to ask him why he seemed so tense in his presence and yet offered to follow him around, helping him, as he did this otherwise menial task. Instead he settled on the less antagonistic question, “What kind of shop does your uncle run?” Dean had a glint in his eye as he brought up his uncle. He had a faint smile on his face and Castiel couldn’t help but notice the faint dusting of freckles on the man’s face.
Dean had been eager to spend the moment away from his brother. They were in the middle of a case and every turn felt like a dead end and Sam was being particularly annoying about the situation. Dean had told him that he would be going out for a drive to try and clear his head. Sam had barely looked up to acknowledge his departure as he continued to comb through John’s journal and what ever he could find on the glacial internet from the motel. He had tried calling Bobby a few times, but that had led to a few more lectures than either of them were particularly in the mood for. Once they had eliminated that whatever was killing off the inhabitants of this town wasn’t a demon or an angel they were left basically on their own. Castiel was busy with the civil war in heaven and had made few appearances to speak with them. Dean tapped on his steering wheel as the forest of trees stretched out on his right, the moonlight flickering between the treetops. Dean hummed softly as Bob Seger played through the stereo. He had the window down and was enjoying the summer air in the little Mississippi town they had ventured into.
“You feeding a small country, Sam?” Sam took off his tie and sighed. Cas couldn’t see around the half wall, so he decided he should attempt to awaken. Sam’s gaze flickered to Cas. Dean looked over at the rising angel. His shirt was unbuttoned to the last button. Dean looked back at Sam with a questioning glance.
“You need to come down here. To the house of the victim.” Cas hung up and continued to help Dean. They continued to fight for a few minutes before the sound of a truck pulled up and Sam came rushing in. He saw the scene in front of him and Bobby followed soon after. Dean looked over at Sam in confusion and as he did, so a demon swung at Dean making him double over. He didn’t have time to react before the demon swung again with a knife in his hand and slashed Dean’s stomach. Cas watched in horror as Dean fell to the ground in a puddle of blood.
“Can I tell you something, if you promise not to tell another soul?” Cas moved his hand from the edge of the partition and leaned against the wall separating them, lowering his voice so that Dean would be the only one able to hear it. There was still the distant drumming of fireworks going off in the city, he ignored them to listen intently to Dean. Dean didn’t respond, instead he moved until Cas heard a soft thud on the other side of the wall. He knew that Dean was leaning on the same wall he was leaning on.
“Ghosts are pretty common, not all of them are aggressive like that though.” Dean leant back and moved his hands to his knees. “Just about anything you can think of is out there.” Dean went on to tell him of all the creatures he and his brother ever hunted. Whenever he talked about his brother his voice was dripping with grief. About halfway through his explanation the whistle from the kettle went off and Castiel got up to pour himself and Dean some tea. He did them up rather nice and came back, offering Dean the cup. He looked at it apprehensively, but eventually gave it a sip. His voice changed a fraction and Cas could tell that he enjoyed it more than he had originally thought he would. He continued shortly after and he went on until both of their cups were empty and Cas was leaning over the table listening to him. After what felt like hours, Dean had summed up just about everything he had ever encountered. He stopped to look into his cup longingly. Cas knew that he wasn’t staring at the cup looking for more tea.
“Cas, Cas! Fuck me, Cas.” Cas’ hold on his hips kept him from thrusting wantonly into the angel’s mouth. The pressure on his hip was firm, but not overwhelming, he wondered if he would have a bruise of the angel’s hand later. Dean lifted his legs up, unable to resist the building pressure starting near his hips. “Cas, I’m close. Cas! Oh fuck!” He had expected the angel to stop what he was doing, but he found that the angel only increased his ministrations. Dean watched with lust blown eyes as Castiel nuzzled into his groin as his cock hit the back of the angel’s throat and it was enough for him to grunt out his release. Cas continued to give subtle licks and pulls with his hand and tongue as Dean come down from his climax. The feeling of the angel’s mouth and hand milking him would keep him occupied in his dreams for months to come. Finally, as he regained his composure and pulled his hands free from the iron grip he had on the dock, Castiel lifted his head up with what Dean could only imagine was a smug look.
“You idiots! You were supposed to keep him alive!” A familiar accented voice yelled. Cas turned to Crowley as Dean slumped to the ground holding his stomach. Crowley walked forward to Dean, grabbing the knife from him, and stabbing the demon that stabbed Dean. Crowley stepped back as Cas clenched his fists and yelled in anger. The house shook and the windows broke. Crowley covered his ears and ducked. Cas yelled out an anti-possession spell and Crowley disappeared out of the house. Sam and Bobby put their hands on their ears and hit the floor. They closed their eyes as wind roared around them, sending glass on Bobby and Sam’s backs. The other demons weren’t so lucky. They shook and convulsed as Cas continued to recite the spell. Blood poured out of their eyes and they crouched on the ground begging for mercy. Blood continued to pour out of their eyes as they vomited out black smoke and fell to the floor. Cas came back to consciousness and looked down at Dean. He crouched down, crying as he watched his hunter slowly die.
“Yes, Dean, I believe to be ‘decent’.” Dean turned around and Cas was sticking one foot into his sweats. Dean shuffled and debated waiting until Sam got out to change, but with gooseflesh all over his body and his chattering teeth he didn’t think he could allow himself to wait that long.
“With how the busses are around here, you would be better off walking.” There was a gruffness to Dean’s voice. Castiel wondered where he had acquired at for a man as young as he was. He looked at Dean next to him and saw something swing slightly on his chest as the car moved along the road. A necklace hung low on his chest; it must have been the shine that he had seen in the confessional all those months ago. Castiel let the car fall into silence as he watched the buildings on either side of them pass in a blur. He had no specific place in mind, he just planned on looking for any bulletin boards he could find that would let him post his fliers. He knew some of his parishioners ran some businesses around the city, but he didn’t know the lay out of the city just yet to know if he could get there in the time allotted today. Eventually, Dean pulled off to the side of the road, parking along one of the many lines of parking meters.
“What is it you need, agents?” Cas fixed his coat although there was nothing wrong with it. Dean watches as Cas tries to situate himself and he puts a hand on Cas’ shoulder. Cas looked at Dean and smiled. The father watched the exchange and relaxed a little. “Do they allow office relationships in the FBI?” The man chuckled and put Caleb down. Dean and Cas looked at the man. Cas was confused, but Dean looked sad.
“Sorry about that, buddy. I know how brother’s can be. Is he younger or older?”
Sam could see his brother sweating and straining as they continued down the road. Sam stopped, but Dean forged on. “Dean!” Sam called after him. Dean seemed not to hear him. His breathing was strained, and his legs were weak, but he wouldn’t stop until he had put Cas to rest like a real Winchester. Sam ran after his brother and stopped in front of him. Dean had a scowl on his face. He tried to move around his younger brother, but he wouldn’t have any of it.
“Dean.” Castiel groaned into the man’s ear as he felt a white hot burst of energy implode from with in him. He was followed shortly after by Dean as he let out a breathy moan, his hand and stomach getting covered in their release.
On the day Castiel was expected to leave Michael had made an appearance. When they looked at each their veils lifted and Castiel felt himself steeling his nerves for the meeting. All former pretenses were dropped as their true forms seemed to fill up the space of the church.
He was a Catholic, he knew about demons. He knew about exorcisms. He had hoped to go to the Vatican sometime in his life to research more into it. But having heard it in that way from someone who didn’t consider themselves overtly religious in the structural sense but rattled off several sins that took understanding of the Sacrament not found outside of people within the clergy or the See had his bones nearly stiff with a knowledge he wasn't privy to.
“I have to go. If I’m gone too long, they’ll send someone.” Dean nodded as he sat up and started to put on his boxers. Before Dean could get out of the car, Dean heard the flutter of wings. Dean looked at the spot where Castiel was previously standing and rubbed the back of his neck. He closed the back door and hurried to get clothed and head back to the motel before Sam started to worry as well and called every hunter in a forty-mile radius.
Dean pulled away for breath but rested his forehead on Cas’. Cas continued to pepper Dean’s lips with little kisses. At the side of his mouth, on his bottom lip, on his nose, until finally back on his lips and Dean hungrily kissed Castiel back. Cas groaned again and moved his hands under Dean’s jacket.  He popped the buttons open and slipped his hands under the shirt and ran his hands all along Dean’s chest. Dean moved his hand around to the front of Castiel’s pants and wrapping his hand around to slide beneath the pants, grabbing Castiel’s ass. Cas jumped slightly but pressed himself to Dean anyways. Dean backed up to the bed and sat down. Cas took off his coat as he straddled Dean’s lap. Dean squeezed the angel’s ass and ground his hips into Cas’ pelvis. Cas gasped and moaned. Dean kissed Cas’ neck and nipped at the skin there. Cas rolled his hips against Dean’s tented pants. Dean groaned and kissed Cas, hard. Cas bit down on Dean’s lip and Dean moaned. He ran his tongue over the hunter’s lip and continued to kiss with fervor. Dean moved his hand to the front of Cas’ pants and shoved his hand down Cas’ underwear and gently grabbed Cas’ erection. Cas bucked into his hand and whimpered when Dean simply held him.
“I hate to be rude, but I have to finish cleaning up around here and then see if I can’t fix this window before I head back to sleep and perform my sermon tomorrow morning.” If Dean was offended by his bluntness, than he didn’t show it.
“Yes, Dean. I am perfectly fine.” Dean shook his head. He looked sad. His hunter looked sad, for him. Cas felt something tug deep inside him and he scrunched up his face in confusion. Dean leaned back in his chair and rubbed his hands over his face. He made weird motions with his hands in exasperation.
“Dean?” Cas looked at Dean in worry and confusion. Dean started to get angry and sternly whispered Cas’ name. Cas felt his heart rate decrease and become subdued. Dean looked forward again and his face shifted to surprise and joy. He wrapped his arms around Cas and held tight. Cas held him as well and Dean fell back with his angel. They lay on the bed for some unknown time before Dean whispered,
“I don’t know about cold spots, but my bedroom is almost freezing regardless of the weather.” Castiel finally supplied. Sam reached into his jacket and pulled out a handheld device. He put his hand on Dean’s shoulder before he started wandering around the church, weaving his way through the pews. Dean led him to sit down in one of the said pews. Castiel was on edge by the entire exchange, but followed his direction anyways.
“Gone, searched the whole town for her. Sounds like she dropped dead somewhere in the desert.” Bobby replied. Dean nodded and began to gather up his stuff. “Dean,” Bobby started his voice soft. Dean ignored him and continued to pack up his belongings. “Dean, stop.” Dean was almost done when Bobby stood up. “Boy, listen here! You’ve got one more night before we hit the road. The only mode of transportation you’ve got is me! So, sit your ass down and get some rest.” Dean ignored him once again. Cas watched as he tried to leave, but Sam blocked the door.
“It’s been a while, Michael.” Castiel couldn’t help the way his wings twitched when speaking with Michael.
“Dean!” Cas yelled. Dean didn’t even look. He kicked the bed frame and Bobby got up. He inched his way closer to Dean until Cas thought the older man would bump into him, but he moved right through Cas. Cas stood still looking terrified. That explained it. Dean continued to have a panic attack and Bobby had to wake up Sam to hold him down. Cas stood, numb to everything around him as Dean was wrangled onto the bed to calm down. Cas’ world fell away to blackness and he spun through an infinite nothing as he wrapped his brain around the idea that he had died. He remembered throwing himself in front of the Inugami, then it went black. He woke up sometime on the ride back to the motel. Dean was holding him, and Bobby and Sam were unusually silent. Cas didn’t have the energy to wake up fully, so he resorted to falling back asleep. Cas felt something wet drip down his coat and a sudden fierce pain in his neck. Reality came back and they all looked over in shock and horror. Cas tried to say something, but blood bubbled up to his mouth and contorted his words. Dean ran forward, but Sam and Bobby held him back.
But something niggled in the back of his mind. Something quiet and loud at the same time.
“Yeah, see you.”
“Don’t let the cold scare you off, it’s lovely around here.” The Bishop opened the door and let Castiel walk in before him. The door led into a narrow hallway where there was another door at the end of the hall. “The last priest used this area as storage, but you can do with it as you see fit.” Castiel merely nodded as they walked front to back in the hallway. There was a pew every few feet, seemingly kept there on the chance there were more people than usual. From the accumulation of dust on the wood, he would guess that they hadn’t been needed in some time. They approached the second door, and the Bishop went through, allowing Castiel to follow. There was a desk to one side and a few lamps around the room. It was an office of sorts with a bookshelf behind the desk and on the wall beside it. There was a single window that attempted to let in the dim light of the snowstorm around them. Castiel watched as the flurries came down much heavier than when he had arrived. The windowsill was quickly accumulating a veil of white as the storm raged on just outside. It was slightly warmer back here and Castiel was eager to feel the tips of his fingers again.
“I haven’t been to town all that often, only to get groceries.” Castiel followed behind at a brisk pace before he caught up to Dean. Dean’s necklace bounced off his chest while he walked. It reminded him of a fetish he had seen once in the reliquary of one of the many churches he had been in.
“Dammit, my seats.” He sped off and headed back to the hotel. Once they were parked, they all made a mad dash for the motel room, but Sam got in first and swiped the bathroom from Dean. Dean groaned and started to peel off his wet clothes. The cold was soon to set in, so it was best to get into dry clothes as soon as possible. Cas stood at the door, still dripping wet. The droplets landed in his eyes and he shook his head to try and get his head dry. Dean stopped as he was about to remove his belt. He looked over at Cas. “Cas.” He said in exasperation. He walked over to his duffle bag and began to pull out clothes. He was in nothing, but his pants and he ran a hand through his wet hair. Drops flew everywhere. Dean finally grabbed what he wanted and walked over to Cas. He handed him some clothes and motioned for him to strip. “You need to get out of those wet clothes.” Cas shrugged off his coat and it fell to the floor with a wet sound. Dean walked over and to his own pile of clothes and hurried to take his belt off.
“Was anyone here late last night?” Castiel looked at Deacon Neil with a narrowed glance. Deacon Neil turned and pointed to the candles on the edge of the altar. Castiel saw a few candles were knocked down and it looked like they had marks in them, like someone had grabbed them with untrimmed nails.
“Cas?” He dropped his rubble and helped up the angel. Cas looked around in confusion. He looked back at the hallway and he thought he saw something move. Sam looked in the direction of the hallway. Dean walked over, his head pointed to the sky, looking for a way out. Cas went to move away from the hallway when an intense pain overcame him, but he couldn’t scream or cry out. He stood perfectly still as the pain consumed his whole body. Then without his command his body moved towards Sam.
“Dean.” Was the most that Cas could get out. Dean didn’t move when Castiel walked into the booth, closing the door behind him.
“You get used to it eventually.” Castiel walked to the corner of the street, the four light poles each getting their own flier. He was kind of glad Dean decided to tag along, the ones that needed taping was a hassle with only two hands. Dean was almost eager to help as he hastily got everything ready while Castiel held the paper to the pole. They had missed the first cross walk light, but the second one they strode across to the other side, repeating the process for the four light poles on that side as well. Dean didn’t even complain when they crossed the street several times to post fliers on every pole on each corner. Once they were walking along the sidewalk once again Castiel took the moment to prod a little more into the man next to him.
“What about her? She’s dead. Now get off my property.” Sam put his hands out to calm her, but faster than any of them could react; she pulled the hose out and sprayed them. Sam sputtered as he got a mouthful and Dean ducked his head. Cas stood there in confusion. She continued to spray them until they ran to the car. Cas still hadn’t moved, so Dean ran back and dragged him by the collar.
“It’s complicated.” The man nods.
“You don’t need to, but what if you just laid with me?” Castiel looked at the open side of the blanket. He watched, Dean’s face getting redder the longer he took to respond. Castiel eventually stood and began taking off his shirt and slacks. Leaving them folded in the chair. He stood bare with the exception of his boxers before he slowly slid in to the open side of the blanket. Before he was completely settled Dean had his legs wrapped up in Castiel’s. Dean threw the blanket over Cas as he joined Dean on the pillow. It was a twin bed and only allowed for the barest amount of space between them. Neither of them seemed to mind though. Dean threw his arm around Cas’ middle. Their foreheads grazing against each other as they found comfortable positions. Dean closed his eyes satisfied with being so close to Cas. Castiel watched him as his breathing started to even out and his face relaxed as he began to fall asleep. “You can be my guardian angel while I sleep.” Dean’s voice was groggy with sleep, but he had enough energy to give a smirk before he was completely asleep.
After the call was made and the dispatcher promised that someone would be on the way to check in on him and take his statement, Castiel got to work cleaning up the shards of glass littering the ground of the nave. He had changed into more presentable clothing and was busy sweeping along the stone floor of the church when the thundering knock sounded at the front door. Castiel had gotten most of the glass picked up and in the trash, so he headed over to the door to let the police in. Two uniformed officers took their hats off as they stepped into the church. Castiel led them over to the broken window that he was currently attempting to clean up. The open chest left untouched.
“This is me.” Cas straightened in the confined space. “I am Castiel, angel of the lord.”
He would often stay late in confessional in case Dean would come by. But each night the confessional was not graced by the man who had upturned his entire life. His faith. His entire worldview. If ghosts were real than did this prove that the god he prayed to every night was also real? Did it prove that nothing else was real? What else is there? What roamed this earth that hunted humans and terrorized the masses? Castiel kept the line of salt at his door and his windowsill. If he disturbed it he would find himself fixing it with a fresh row of salt. He thought the encounter with the ghost would renew his faith in Christ, but he found himself pulling from it. He still prayed and he gave his sermons with just as much passion as before, but doubt settled in his heart. It was something heavy and dragged his feet with every step. He was surprised it didn’t lengthen his shadow. Castiel found his voice was laden with the doubt whenever he would pray in his room at night. His collar felt tight on his throat and sometimes he would find himself taking it off while he sat in his office.
“Uh, sure.” He let her in and hoped she ignored his state of undress. She looked around the motel room. He sat down at the table and offered her a chair, she continued to stand.
He looked up to the heavens and wondered how often Castiel looked down at him. He didn’t even know if they could look down like that, every time he had been in heaven it had been just an accumulation of rooms. The train of thought was a dangerous one as he felt his cock twitch in his pants at the thought of Castiel looking down on him, spread eagle as if he were presenting himself on the hood of his impala for the angel to reach down and claim once again. Dean took a deep breath and decided he had been out long enough if Sam wasn’t going to worry he had gotten himself attacked by whatever it was they were hunting. Dean hopped off the hood of his car and walked around to the driver’s seat. Before he opened the door, he put his hands on the hood of the car. Something compelled him to clasp his hands and put his head on seam of the door. He took a few deep breaths before he began to speak,
“I was admiring your necklace.” Cas stated before they reached the group of people waiting for the crosswalk sign to turn green. A few people lowered their voices when they saw Castiel, but he gave them a small smile when they looked back at him. They’re volume didn’t resume, but the continued on with their conversation.
“So, what…” Dean didn’t seem to know what it was he was asking. His face was still slightly flushed from their activities in the confessional booth. Castiel couldn’t seem to take his eyes off the man. Every time Dean’s eyes attempted to rise and meet his, his face flushed brighter and he went back to staring into his cup.
“You know I’m not good at these chick flick moments,” Cas tilted his head slightly. “You don’t seem alright.” Dean smirked awkwardly. He put his hands on the table. Sam stood up and stretched. He grabbed the car keys and walked to the door.
“Father Freely, can we go outside and run around?” One of the kids spoke up once the clamor had died down. A few kids perked up at that. Even some of the kids that were sitting reading strewn out on the pews and on the ground.
“Cas.” Dean’s voice was breathy as Castiel entered his space. There was plenty of space for one, but now with two Castiel was standing between Dean’s spread legs. There was a shine to Dean’s eyes that hadn’t been there a year ago.
“They’re constantly knocking things off of the altar and I can hear them scratching at night.” Castiel watched as Dean’s face went completely blank as he listened to Castiel’s explanation. Dean’s arms tensed a little once he finished, but didn’t say anything else as Sam seemed to be listening with one ear while he finished taping up the tarp. Castiel watched as Sam sealed off the last little crack and Castiel stepped back from the ladder to let Sam get down. Castiel grabbed the ladder and walked the short distance to put it back into the storage closet. When he returned he saw that Sam and Dean were speaking in hushed tones close to each other. They stopped when they saw Castiel coming back. Castiel continued walking until he was past them and picking up the loose change on the ground to place into the nearly empty chest. He closed it as best he could and dragged it to the side of the aisle. It was still relatively heavy despite it having now been cleared of alms. The brother’s watched him as he set it back to it’s rightful spot and turned to thank them for their help.
“You’re the FBI guys that stopped by my house yesterday?” Dean nodded. “Is now a good time to talk?” Dean looked down at his appearance. He cleared his throat and Cas looked over at him. He made a motion with his eyes to get dressed. Cas walked back to the bathroom and shut the door.
“He heard me.” Cas looked in confusion at Dean. Before Cas could ask anything, Dean pulled Cas’ mouth to his and kissed him hard. Cas reciprocated and pulled Dean closer to him. As close as humanly possible. Cas could taste the tears on Dean’s lips. He broke away and Cas could feel his heart beating wildly in his chest. Dean opened his eyes and as they adjusted to the dark his face froze in horror. “Cas?” Cas nodded and held his hand out. Dean looked around and fussed with the blankets. Cas called out,
“I have no idea.” He saw the door to the bathroom open and Dean grabbed some clothes. “But that just makes me what to stay more.” Dean walked past Cas as he exited the bathroom. Dean reached back and pinched Cas’ ass. Cas jumped and looked back at Dean to see his wicked grin disappear behind the bathroom door.
“I did too.” Castiel was only momentarily taken aback by the confession. They stared at each other for a moment before Dean reached up, grabbing as the buttons of Cas’ shirt. He pulled himself up and crashed his lips to Cas’. Castiel took no time in reciprocating, cupping Dean’s face as they continued to kiss. Dean pressed his whole body against Castiel as Castiel’s tongue swiped against Dean’s lips. Dean let out a stuttered groan which Castiel took as permission to delve deeper. He tilted his head, moving his hands back to thread at the nape of Dean’s neck. Dean let go of Castiel’s shirt and wandered his hands to Castiel’s hips. The tentative swipe of Dean’s tongue against his seemed to spark a frenzy in his mind. Castiel moved his hands from Dean’s nape to his hips, pulling him flush to his body.
Six Months Later
was a strip club that specialized in the red light sort of extravagant.
“I usually perform as a cowboy, but I think I might mix it up for you and wear an old officer uniform for you.” Castiel thought about the cuffs and fiddled with the zipper on his pants.
“Castiel?” Dean was looking down at him with concern and fear. Castiel closed his eyes for a second and everything came flooding back into clarity. He opened his eyes again and Dean had backed up a bit, the fear drowning out the concern at this point. Castiel stood up, shook out his wings, and laid a finger on Dean’s forehead.
“Castiel. Good to see you’re back.” Michael held himself differently than he did when he was under the guise of Bishop. Castiel had to admit that he did as well.
“Yes.” The conversation didn’t last long after that when Mrs. Hanson came strolling in as best she could. Her daughter and grandson following her. Her grandson was holding something, but Castiel couldn’t see it from his angle. Michael made his way around the other side of the nave to leave out the front door. Castiel walked down to meet her at the edge of the pews. She gave him a warm smile as he joined her.
“I open up your slacks letting your cock free itself from your boxers.” Castiel openly groaned this time. “I rub it against my tight ass.” The man on the line was definitely having a hard time as Castiel could hear his breath pick up on the other end of the phone, probably holding the phone against his shoulder. Castiel lost the ability to speak and simply moaned into the phone. Thankfully someone had put on some actual music in the bar to drown out Gabriel’s one man karaoke. “I slide down and grip your dick in my hands as I lick the tip.” Castiel was so close. His breathing was rapid and he could feel his back cramping from the position, but he didn’t care, so long as this stranger continued to whisper in his ear. “I slide my mouth over your hard prick. I suck on the tip before taking you deep into my mouth.” Castiel couldn’t last any longer. He came all over his shirt with a soft groan. The man on the other end panted and after a minute there was a quiet grunt followed by a sigh and had Castiel not just came he would have from the noises the other man was making.
“Thank you, Dean Winchester.” Castiel got out, gathering his stuff in his arms, stepping out onto the sidewalk. He started to walk away when he heard Dean calling after him. He turned and saw Dean wrestling with the parking meter. He was shoving quarters into the machine haphazardly.
“Fuck! Cas, give a guy a warning before you say shit like that!” Cas’ eyes seemed to glow in the moonlight as Dean looked down at him.
“She’s better off with her mother than me anyways.” Castiel can’t help the way his voice drops when he talks about Claire. Castiel watches as Dean’s hand makes a twitching motion before it settles on the table again. They sat for a moment, staring at each other from across the table. Castiel watched for the smallest movements in Dean’s face. He was sure Dean was doing the same thing. Castiel slid his eyes over Dean’s shoulder to glance at the clock. He noticed the time and looked back at Dean. His face was slightly red, but he didn’t say anything to address it.
“It says that it can possess people and make them go mad.” Cas looked at Dean, but Dean continued to look at the computer screen with intense concentration. It was as if the computer screen had suddenly become transparent and Dean was trying to read the words on the page.
Dean held Cas under the protection of blankets. He had been awake for an hour or so before Sam lifted the blankets. Cas was starting to stir as Sam closed the hotel room door. Cas groaned and surfaced from the blankets. Dean loosened his hold around the angel. Cas looked around in confusion. He finally noticed Dean lying underneath him. He slowly blinked his eyes and then half-lidded them at the green-eyed man. “Dean…” He tilted his head and Dean’s eyes roamed Cas’ face. Cas was trying to distinguish what he was feeling, as many different emotions rattled around in his brain.
“Father Castiel Novak.” Castiel was able to grab his hat before it fell to the ground, but it did dust the ground with a fine white dust before it melted into the stone of the steps. “Your Excellency.”
“Whatever she’s like, I’m sure she’d be happy to see her father.” Cas’ heart clenched at that before he focused on the road ahead. Cas folded up the map, putting it back in the glove compartment. He slid his hand across the bench seat, holding it out with his palm up. Dean looked out of the corner of his eye at the display and quickly reached down to grab Castiel’s hand in his own. Castiel squeezed his hand as he did so.
Dean carried Cas’ body out of the truck and into the motel. Bobby and Sam followed close behind. Dean sat Cas on the freshly made bed and stared at him. Bobby and Sam looked at each other and walked outside. Dean didn’t even notice that they left. He continued to stare at Cas. He moved to the other bed and sat down on the edge. The tears poured silently from his eyes. He put his head in his hands and sobbed. His heart ached like it never had before. He ran his hands through his hair making it sit up in funny angles. He looked back at Cas and closed his eyes until his head hurt from the pressure. He opened them again and looked at Cas, but he was still dead on the mattress.
“Eleven months since my last confession.” He gave a mirthless little chuckle. “I’m not really getting any better at this, am I?” He leaned forward on his knees. Castiel watched him from his spot on the bench.
“I was sleeping before you rudely woke me up.” Dean ignored everything else that his brother had said to him. “I’d like to get some more sleep before I go find out what is going on with this family.” Sam scoffed.
“What happens now?” Castiel let his curiosity pique for the moment. As if outside of the church he would allow himself to play into whatever it was these boys did for their line of business.
“Dean, if you’re here for confession, this will be the moment in which I say that it’s a little too late.” Dean took a glance back at the other man before he shook his head stiffly.
“Can I call you ‘Cas’?” Castiel opened his eyes at the sudden question.
"Who is he?" Castiel knew the man in question wouldn't be amongst the clergy, but he couldn't help but dart his eyes between all the faces to see if he might recognize the man that the Bishop was describing.
“Hello, Dean.” Dean looked around nervously as he took in Castiel’s sudden appearance. The angel was about four inches from the edge of the dock and watching him as if he had suddenly grown another head.
“Dean!” Dean ran over with is pipe and stood in a ready stance. Sam had fist sized pieces of rubble in his hand and held more in his arms. He had his hand ready to throw. “I don’t think we killed it.” There was more movement and a murky blackness oozing out of the corners of Cas’ vision. The voice came again, and Cas shook his head. He thought he heard words this time. Something along the lines of ‘Take…. Sam’. Dean continued to look for the source of Cas’ distress. Cas spun around trying to see if there was someone he wasn’t seeing, when the voice came again, clearer. ‘Take Sam to the room’. Cas looked around at the mall of sorts. He could see a hallway branching off of the main room. He turned his back on it and it felt like he was hit in the back. He fell to the floor and Sam ran over.
“Hmm?” Cas hummed. Dean growled out his name again as Cas used his other hand to gently massage Dean’s balls and wrapped his fingers around his dick. Dean lay back and keened at Cas’ touch.
“Good, that would be a hard one to explain to Sam.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, clearing his throat. “Oh fuck, what am I going to tell Sam?” He muttered as if more to himself than Cas.
“Do you want me to call your mother or your father?” Caleb sniffled a little as he started to gulp down more water. Castiel waited while Caleb finished the glass.
“Father forgive me, for I have sinned.” Castiel was silent as he listened to Dean continue, as if through a semi-clenched jaw. “I think at least.” More sounds of movement before a soft thump alerted Castiel that Dean had leant his head back on the wall along with Castiel.
“Uh, yeah, Cas?” Dean felt his skin began to flush as Cas seemed to squint and look at him more intensely. His blue eyes nearly disappearing in shadow as the sun beamed down a top his head. Dean swam up to the edge of the dock, figuring that Castiel had arrived to tell him something case related.
“Do you have handcuffs?” A hum in response. “Use those.” The man on the other line took a second to respond, leaving Castiel in suspense.
“No, Dean are you suggesting that I am being…haunted?” Castiel let the disbelief and confusion drip heavily from his mouth. His back was aching from the way he had pressed himself into the pew. The line of questioning had made him as uncomfortable as if they were discussing his own personal sins.
“Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself earlier, I’m Sam Winchester.” Castiel nodded and gave a thin lipped smile as he shook his hand back. “My brother told me a little bit about the new priest in town, but he didn’t tell me your name.” Castiel saw the tips of Dean’s ears flush red at Sam’s comment.
“Hey, Caleb.” Castiel made his voice soft as the child started a little at the announcement of Castiel’s arrival. “Come here, son.” Castiel knelt down and held his arms out for Caleb to approach. The small boy took one glance at his outstretched arms before running into them, crying louder now into Castiel’s shoulder. The boy was no more than 8 and his parents were active in the church life. They usually sat in the front row, always arriving the earliest of all his parishioners. The boy was pretty outspoken and he had even started bringing his own bible to mass. The boy was shaking in his arms despite the heat of the day. Castiel picked the boy up and held him close to his chest as he walked out of the graveyard. He made sure to shut the gate on his way out. He saw that everyone was still grouped together on the yard. The children’s eyes wide as they took in the scene. Castiel made a movement to indicate that he was going to go inside with Caleb. The young boy was still crying softly and sniffling into his shoulder as they got inside and Castiel went all the way back to his kitchen. He went to set down Caleb, but the boy grappled at his shoulders, his hands looking for anywhere to grab that would stop Castiel from setting him down.
He had heard everything, and he would be lying if he didn’t confess that the constant relocations were a burden on his mind even now as he wandered the columns of the church. Castiel thought over the lines for his mass tomorrow. Bishop Shurley had trusted him to this one on his own and Castiel was human enough to admit when he was scared. He held his hands tightly behind him as he approached his office. There were a few people still sitting in the pews from the day’s sermon and he could Deacon Neil wandering around the aisle, speaking softly with people as he passed. Castiel waited at the end of the aisle for Deacon Neil to approach him.
Dean somehow managed to pull out Cas’ shirt and undo his belt. He reached his hand down the front of Castiel’s pants without hesitation, feeling Cas’ own straining erection. The weight and heat of it in Dean’s hand was nearly enough to send him over the edge as he felt his toes curl at the feeling. He instead bit his lip and let out a loud keening noise as Castiel removed his mouth from his neck snap his fingers and his clothes were neatly piled next to Dean’s.
“Was it anyone who is apart of the group?” Castiel grabbed the empty glass of water and set it in the sink before he sat back down. Caleb’s face was back to it’s normal color and he looked calmer.
“Carey!” Caleb stirs in Cas’ arms. He rubs his eyes and sees his fathers’ hugging. He crawls out of Cas’ arms and runs to his parents. Dean walks over to Cas and they watch as Carey picks up Caleb and they hug. Carey looks at Cas and Dean.
“Thank you, the both of you.” Castiel kept his eyes firmly glued on Sam and not once trailing to the man who was still standing nervously behind him. “I am going to –“ He stopped himself. He had no idea what he was going to do, but he knew he wanted to step away from the scene and remove himself from whatever had just happened. He carefully picked his way to the back hallway and making his way to his bedroom. He stopped at the line of salt lining his doorway. He decided to leave it as he crossed over and shut the door behind him. He quickly stripped down until he was in just his boxers, the humidity of the storm making it impossible to sleep in anything else. He decided to pray one las time at the edge of his bed before climbing into bed, throwing his blankets over his bed randomly. He listened to the wind and the rain beat against his window for a few moments before he felt himself drift to sleep.
“Don’t worry about it.” Castiel leaned on the edge of the counter, the landline in the kitchen being attached by a cord. He rubbed his face with the hand that wasn’t holding the phone and took a deep breath. “What’s the purpose of this phone call?” Castiel didn’t mean to sound as rude as he was, but he had been abruptly woken up and he would have to hurry to get ready for summer camp with the kids. He only had a week left until all the schools were off summer break. Castiel heard a distant voice on the other line before Dean returned to speak with Castiel.
“I think that would be a good idea, Father Novak.” Deacon Neil walked past Castiel as he started to make his way down the other side of the pew. “Might I suggest a potluck. It gets awfully cold this time of year and there’s always people in need of a warm meal.” Deacon Neil gave a small glance over his shoulder and Castiel watched him as he continued on. Castiel gave a nod, more to himself than in response to the Deacon, and he walked to his office. The minute he saw the several extra pews in the hallway leading to his office, he knew he wanted to put them out in the nave with the rest of them. He had hoped that if people saw the introduction of the other seats, they might start to fill them. Castiel let his hand drift onto the wood of the pew as he passed by. His fingers catching on the poppyhead. He had made sure to keep the dust off of them while they were back here. The row of windows along the hallway to his right had a habit of dredging up much more dust than was typical in the rest of the church.
Dean stood up, his hands in fists at his side. He stared down at Cas’ lifeless body with such vehemence he had hoped that it would stir the angel back to life. “Cas, what the hell!” He yelled. “Why?” He paced along the side of the bed. “You had to go and get yourself killed! After everything you would be so frivolous with your life!” His anger turned into tears. “You left! You said you would always come when I called, but now what will happen when I call you?” He turned to Cas who still sat lifeless on the bed. “Nothing! There will be no response!” He fell to the floor next to the bed. Sobbing with his hands in his lap. The anger leaving him. He closed his eyes and hung his head.
“Where’s Agent Smokey?” Dean cleared his throat and looked around.
“Angels having intercourse with humans is only frowned upon if they could result in a Nephilim.” Dean’s mind was whirling as his brain tried to comprehend the words coming out of Castiel’s mouth, but he could only focus on how his pouty lips were forming words. “And last I checked; males cannot conceive within the human species.” Dean groaned; the words barely being absorbed by his lust addled mind. Dean merely nodded and used the moment to twist them around so that Castiel was currently pressed against the door of the Impala. It was Dean’s turn to press into the angel. His thigh coming into contact with the equally aroused cock in Castiel’s pants. Dean’s mind short circuited for a moment as he seemed to process the information fully. Castiel was turned on. Castiel was turned on by him. Castiel was fucking hard and it was because of Dean. Growing impatient with Dean’s seemingly short attention span, Castiel reached over to grab at the door handle to the back seat and threw it open. Castiel shoved Dean forward and spurred the hunter into action. Dean went around to scramble into the back seat, leaning over the console to push the seats all the way forward. Dean saw Castiel out of the corner of his eye start to take his tie off and hang it over the door handle. Dean hurried to turn the car off completely, plunging them into darkness, his eyes slowly adjusting to the moonlight.
“Have a good night, Dean.” Dean stuffed his hands in his pockets as he turned to face Castiel.
“Eh, sorry I’m late, Padre.” The man had a gruff voice and he sounded slightly winded. Castiel was intrigued more so by his sudden appearance than the lack of formality.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hanson. I’m sure there will be people more than happy to have them for the season.” Mrs. Hanson held her bag and bible close to her chest as she let him push her down the aisle. A few people got out of their way and Castiel nodded to them with a closed mouth smile.
“Looks like whatever it was is earning the dog’s trust.” A waitress came by and clicked her pen. She gave a forced smile and Sam, and Dean returned the sentiment. Cas put his head on the window and closed his eyes for a second.
after you get laid.” Sam shut his laptop and rubbed at his eyes. Dean stopped humming for a second as he finally caught what he was doing. He went to the bathroom to brush his teeth even though he was sure that Cas had made sure every part of him was clean, he just wanted something to do with his hands.
“Don’t look.” Cas closed his eyes as Dean put him in a standing position. Too soon Dean’s arms removed themselves from Cas’ chest and he heard Dean rustle around, putting clothes on. Cas continued to stand in front of the door with his hands on his pants to keep them from falling off. His eyes still closed until he heard Dean gather up his clothes. Cas cleared his throat to get Dean’s attention. He wasn’t sure if he had it, but he proceeded to talk.
“A few years back an old man died in there of natural causes. It’s been on and off the market several times in those last few years.” Carey stops and thinks for a second. “I think his name was Earl Stampean.” Dean grabbed Sam’s laptop that he took when he ran off and searched Earl Stampean in the Berlin obituaries. Earl came up with a picture. It was of the same guy that they saw earlier. He looked for where he was buried and found the name of the cemetery. Dean grabbed his phone and looked at it before putting it away.
Castiel would be plagued by nightmares for months after the brothers had left his church. He had woke up that morning to find everything had been righted. Castiel couldn’t even find any scorch marks on the stone from the fire. He wanted to believe that he had dreamt the entire thing up, but as he walked to the lectern he saw that spatula sitting next to a single note. The quick scrawled
“This is Agent Smokey and I’m Agent Bandit.” Dean motioned to Sam and himself. The sister didn’t budge. Dean cleared his throat and covered his mouth with his fist.  “I’d like to – “She didn’t let him finish.
“What’s he like?” Castiel figured the best way to get Dean to open up about himself was to ask about someone he cared about. He could tell from the look of the man standing next to him that he was unaccustomed to dealing out information so close to his heart. Dean’s stance shifted as the crosswalk light turned green and they began to walk.
“I’m fine, Dean.” Cas reached a hand out across the table. Dean felt his heart begin to race, but when Cas grabbed his father’s book, he felt like berating himself for acting like a schoolgirl with a crush. Dean cleared his throat and stood up to stretch. Cas couldn’t help but sneak a peek at Dean as his shirt rode up showing his lower back and his muscles. Before Dean could notice, Cas went back to looking for anything relative to the case.
Sam woke up slowly. The sun hit his eyes and he looked over to check on his brother. The bed was stripped and empty of his older sibling. Sam jumped up looking around. “Dean.” Sam called, there was no answer. Sam walked around the small motel room. He saw the mound of blankets on the couch and approached the pile with wary. He pulled up the blankets, apprehensive with the whole plan. He looked in and Cas was entrapped in Dean’s embrace, sleeping soundly. Dean was awake, however, and staring at Sam with a glare. Sam jumped back not expecting him to be awake. The blanket fell back on them and Sam held up his hands, walking away. He popped the top to a beer and took a deep swig. His stomach growled in hunger. He looked in the small fridge and pulled out some leftovers. There was a cup salad that he hadn’t eaten, he decided on that. He hurried to eat that as he got dressed. He decided to go on a run to give the two on the couch some alone time. He debates his decision but decided that it was the best course of action. Sam grabbed a key and hurried out before the day became too hot.
“Dean?” Sam was sitting down on the old tile. The floor was littered with dirt and other substances Cas didn’t particularly want to think about. Somewhere something fell and they all looked over, alert and reaching for weapons. There was a patting noise and a slur of curse words. Cas continued to look in the direction of where the noises came from. He felt in his sleeve and was shocked to see his angel blade was gone. He turned to Dean who was looking around and yelling.
“The sister wasn’t home, so we can start their fir – “The car careened to the right, causing it to flip. Dean cried out and Sam held onto the seat. Cas touched both of the boy’s arms and tried to teleport them out, but his powers fizzled. He looked at the fear and shock on Dean’s face and being unable to help him and he tried again. Still no reaction. The car hit the asphalt on its roof and continued to roll. The window next to Cas broke, sending glass into his arm, but he ignored it and continued to try and teleport them out. The car rolled once again, and Cas saw the door on Sam’s side open and Sam was thrown out the side. Cas reached out to grab him, but his vision went black he lost consciousness.
“Fuck, Cas.” Dean barely managed to get out before Cas descended on his lips again. Castiel couldn’t help grinding his pelvis against Dean’s as he so badly sought the friction to ease the tension in his slacks. With the first roll of his hips Dean went slack and bit his lip, but it couldn’t stop the lewd sound that came out of his mouth with every rock of Castiel’s hips. Castiel could feel his skin start to tingle as his oncoming orgasm was fast approaching. He could tell from the way Dean’s face was shifting that he was close too. “You’re going to have to cool your hips if you want me to last any longer.” Castiel stopped his hips for a moment as he leaned in to nuzzle his nose at the junction of Dean’s jaw and neck.
“I- “ Caleb started, he hiccupped halfway through as his tears finally dried up. “-I thought I saw someone. They went into the graveyard.” Castiel kept his face neutral even though his mind was racing with thoughts. “When I got in there they disappeared and then I went to go back and someone grabbed my arm and pulled my down.” He gasped out as he help his arm against his chest. Castiel shifted slightly as he held his hands out for Caleb to put his arm into them. “That’s when I screamed.” Caleb looked worriedly at Castiel before putting his arm in Castiel’s outstretched hands. Castiel looked over the boys arm, but he didn’t see anything that would indicate that the boy had been grabbed.
Months passed without another encounter with Dean Winchester. The haunting confession a distant memory as the summer months were almost in full gear, which usually meant many more events to contend with. He was more than happy to have his hands busy with his ever-growing clergy, by the time Easter arrived he had people in every pew of the nave and busting at the seams in the gallery. It had been so many more than he had anticipated and while he hadn’t had the same size following mass after Easter, he did put good to the extra pews that had been previously stored in the hallway to his office. His eyes swept out as he took in the many faces of his parishioners. He tried to ignore the way his eyes couldn’t pick out Dean Winchester from the large gathering. His prayers usually consisted of all of his parishioners in need, but he found he was praying a certain man’s name far more often than he did anyone else. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t worried about the man. After his confession, his mind began to race at the thought of what kind of business that the Winchester was involved in and thus got his brother re-involved in. He had dealt with members of gangs, he had briefly spent time in New York City, but there was some kind of conviction in Dean’s words that resonated with him that wasn’t the same he had heard from the words of current and former gang members. His brain was like a drain with the two words ‘monsters’ and ‘demons’ circling around, forever circling, but never following down into the drain.
“Excuse me!” Cas yelled to get the man back on the phone.
“That means we were wrong.” Castiel stood stock still at Dean’s words. “I’ll get back to you tonight.” Dean hung up the phone again and Castiel put the phone back just as he heard the door to the hallway open. Castiel wiped his hands on his slacks again before he left the kitchen to approach Father Freely in the hallway. He didn’t want anyone stumbling onto his bedroom while there was a line of salt sitting at the doorway. Castiel shut the kitchen door on his way out and opened the door just as Father Freely  was about to knock on the door. He had his hand poised above the door and Castiel gave him a tightlipped smile causing Father Freely to put his hand down.
“Thank you, Padre.” Castiel leant back, having moved forward to create a more earnest approach to this man. Whatever emotions Dean had grappled with seemed to quiet on his side of the screen.
“I’m a lawyer for a large company.” The man on the other line hummed.
“She took our weapons!” He quieted down and rubbed his face with his hand. “Cas, Sam, do you remember what happened?” They both shook their head. Sam sniffed and moved his hair out of his eyes. He stood up and began to look around. Something else fell and they all turned. Dean ran to a pile of rubble and yanked at something. Cas saw something move out of the corner of his eye. He turned his head to try to catch it, but it disappeared again. There was a cry of accomplishment; Cas looked over to see Dean wielding an iron rod about three feet long. He swung it to test its weight and seemed to be satisfied with the outcome. Sam whipped his head around and tensed up.
He had listened to the voicemails from Bobby and Sam. The first few were angry at being left in BFE, Nevada, but they progressively became more worried as he didn’t call back and he didn’t show up to pick them up. As far as he knew they were camping out in Sioux Falls at Bobby’s place. After that he stopped listening to the messages. Dean had been across the board in the last three months since the car was fixed and he didn’t plan on stopping now. His phone rang, but he ignored it as he usually did. He took it out and threw it in the passenger seat, but instead of hitting the seat it landed in someone’s lap. Dean glanced over and saw Cas.
“Do you dance often?” Castiel’s mind whirled with the implications that ‘dancing’ may entail.
He would admit it had been a long while since he had had this kind of sexual encounter. His first was in one of the high schools his dad was always dropping him off at. He had been a rebellious youth with a curious streak in him. He didn’t think his next encounter would be a literal soldier of god. Dean nodded to let Castiel continue and he picked up speed once he got the clear from Dean. Dean was gripping the leather of the seat hard enough he was sure it would be permanently indented with his fingernails long after he was done.
They arrived in New Hampshire in record time. Dean ordered a one bedroom and went inside. Once he was inside, he threw his bags on the couch and stripped down to boxers and a t-shirt. He locked the door before grabbing Cas’ hand and walking to the bed. He lay down with his angel and Cas curled up next to him. Dean was asleep before Cas could get comfortable.
“The long sleeves today Father?” Castiel wanted to ignore the question, but he instead took his time chewing before he answered.
“Cas!” A voice called out and something was swinging through the boy in front of him. Timothy let out a cry, something that didn’t belong to the body of a young boy, as he dissipated into smoke. Castiel stared with wide eyes at Dean who had a metal bar of some kind in his hands. Sam wasn’t far behind him. Something was beeping sporadically and Castiel was so confused he could barely focus on a single thing going on around him. With the church now covered in darkness the only light was from the occasional crack of lightning before it was dark again. Dean approached Castiel as he was still prone on the dais. He gently grabbed his arm that he had put up to protect himself. Castiel let himself be pulled up by his forearm until he was standing mere inches from Dean. His eyes were wild with concern, but they had a hardness to them that he had never seen in the man’s face before.
New Year’s Eve had arrived sooner than he had anticipated. He sat in the confessional as he listened to the fireworks go off in the distance. He had his eyes closed as he reflected on the past year. His head in his hands as he leant over his knees. He had led an extra long sermon, going until well past ten to ring in the new year. It had drained all of his energy and the only place he seemed to find any reprieve was sitting in the confessional.
“You’re being really homophobic right now, Sam.” There was a twinkle in Dean’s eye as he teased his brother. Castiel watched out the window as they pulled out the parking lot and headed down the street, turning up the music as he did so.
“No, this is my last week as a priest.” Castiel dragged his nails down Dean’s back and any opposition that was on his tongue quickly faded from thought. Castiel adjusted them so that he had one knee on the cushioned seat and the other leg holding them in place. Dean reached out now that his hands were free to do what they like. He started pulling at Castiel’s shirt, tugging it out of his slacks. Castiel found he couldn’t get enough of Dean’s lips. He nipped and licked and stole away Dean’s breath with every connection. Dean let out ragged grunts and groans as he kept getting distracted from touching Castiel’s skin. Eventually he was able to untuck his shirt and feel all the way up and down Cas’ chest. Cas broke their kiss to let out a breath moan as Dean’s fingers grazed his nipples.
“What is my penance, Padre?” Castiel moved his face back from the screen. He crossed himself and sent up a small prayer to the Holy Father before he responded.
“Sam.” His voice was gruff with emotion. Sam held his hands out to carry Cas, but Dean sneered at him and pulled Cas closer to him. His clothes were soaked with blood and sweat, but he continued to walk in the blistering heat. Sam looked at Dean with a blank face. But his eyes bore holes into Dean’s head. Dean kept strong. They heard the familiar sound of a car off in the distance. They both looked over and saw the familiar fender of Bobby’s blue truck. He pulled up next to them and looked ready to say something but saw Cas and shut up. Sam opened the back seat and Dean climbed in, carefully situation Cas in the back seat. Sam jumped in the front seat and they sped off to the nearest town.
“Are you okay?” Dean asked, his voice a little strained and he was heaving as if he had been running. Castiel was so focused on trying to calm his heartrate that he didn’t respond to Dean. Sam put the EMF reader back in his pocket and started to walk around the church, his eyes scanning around the darkened building. Castiel could barely see Dean in front of him until a bright flash of lightning lit up the room and Castiel saw Timothy standing in the middle of the pews just as Sam’s device blared alive. Castiel’s eyes went wide as he pointed to the boy behind Dean.
“We’ll have to get home to do our research.” Sam pointed out. He was writing in a notepad. Castiel mentally jotted down the name in his mind for him to see if he could pull up any information about the young boy as well. He had surely not buried the lad, so he was unsure of the circumstances surrounding the young boys death. They walked back through the graveyard and Castiel saw the black chevy glistening in the warm summer moonlight. He stopped on the sidewalk before the front doors and stared at the two brothers.
“Does your arm hurt now?” Castiel set Caleb’s arm back on the boy’s lap before moving to sit in the chair next to him.
Dean didn’t care if Sam made fun of him for it later, he cared that Cas was no longer going to freeze because he didn’t know how to take care of himself as a human. After several minutes Dean, himself, was able to relax and be consumed by the need to sleep.
. By the nine month mark Castiel had been consumed with grief and fear that Dean would never grace his dais again. He had finally spoken with Bishop Shurley and told him of his desire to leave the cloth. He had been adamant that he would like to see Castiel stay, but the guilt, fear, and restlessness in his bones weighed too heavily on him. Despite that, Castiel agreed to stick around at the church until they had found his replacement. Deacon Neil had been upset about his news, but he had a kindness in his eyes he hadn’t seen directed at him before. He was sad that Castiel would be leaving, but he knew that this path wasn’t what the Lord had intended for him. Castiel thanked him for being a friend and the old man grumbled something before leaving. When Christmas rolled around he had almost accepted the inevitability that he would never see Dean again. He only had a few more days until he wouldn’t be priest anymore. They were bringing someone in from across the pond and Castiel could feel the restlessness in his bones only excite the closer he was to his final day. The restlessness coupled with the realization that he would never see Dean again had him all to eager to leave this town and never look back.
“I’m just glad you didn’t bring her here.” Sam said once he looked up from his laptop. Dean looked at Sam for a moment before squinting at him.
“What do you wear when you perform?” Castiel was curious, but also wanted to know what he would be looking for when he visited his mysterious ‘good time’.
The following morning Castiel told Deacon Neil that he was taking care of someone and wouldn’t be available for most of the day. When Castiel gazed upon the old man’s face, Castiel could see a shimmer of another feature just under the surface. Like the Deacon was wearing a veil and the face underneath was sleeping just underneath. The other figure’s face had their eyes closed and didn’t recognize Castiel when he placed a hand on the Deacon’s shoulder. Castiel spent the rest of the day alternating between eating and speaking with Dean. He seemed in no rush to leave. He barely even wore more than his jeans as he paraded around between the four rooms behind the church. Castiel would be lying if he said that the sight of Dean with hickeys all over his chest and neck parading around half naked didn’t have an effect on him. It had led to several more hickeys appearing before Dean’s body throughout the day and one or two times with the man pinned against the wall like a fine art museum.  His sweaty chest and euphoric expression would fit in along side any painting within the Louvre.
“Father Novak, glad to see you!” Castiel let Father Freely into his kitchen, he started to grab another plate, but the other priest seemed to guess his intentions. “No, I’ve already eaten, thank you for your generosity.” Castiel put the plate back and finished plating his food.
“Hey Cas, I know you’re busy up there, but I just wanted to phone in and – “Before he was able to come up with some mediocre reason for praying to Castiel, there was a hand on his shoulder, spinning him around until he had his back pressed firmly to the door of the impala and Castiel pressed to his front. The sound of the bull frog must have masked the sound of Castiel’s wings and subsequent footsteps as Dean didn’t hear him approach until he had his hand on his shoulder. Whatever attempts he had made to eliminate the erection from previously had been thrown to the wayside as he was instantly hard as he felt Castiel’s body flush against his. Dean subconsciously opened his legs to bring Castiel closer to him, which the angel had obliged. Dean’s hands shot out to grab at Castiel’s coat out of habit. Cas’ face was inches from Dean’s and he had a hard time looking directly into the stormy eyes of the angel. “Ca-“ He couldn’t even get words out before Cas was pressing further into him making him bite back a groan. His erection was pressing hard into the angel’s thigh and Dean felt his face flush at that.
“And what would you say?” Castiel slurred over the words. There was a pause, Castiel thought he could hear the man breathing.
“Did you have business in the city?” Castiel shifted the basket from arm to arm as the wicker of the handle dug into his flesh. Dean put his hands in his pockets, his face a little flushed from the heat and he could see a sheen of sweat break out on his forehead. The collar of his short sleeve shirt had a few drops of sweat on it.
Dean heard the fight downstairs and ran down the steps his feet barely hitting the ground. He saw Cas and the ghost fighting in the hallway. He couldn’t do anything at this point because it would mean that Cas could get hurt as well, so Dean went into the kitchen and grabbed Caleb and his father. He took them in the car and drove off.
“Hey, where you going?” Dean looked slightly disheartened before his face seemed to collect itself and a curious look came over his face.
“Watch it!” Sam mumbled something and got out of the impala where he proceeded to stretch out his long limbs. Cas folded up the map and set it on the seat as he got out of the car. They grabbed their stuff and checked into the motel. Dean walked in followed by Sam and Cas brought up the rear. The motel was decked out in cacti statues and little cacti on the wallpaper. It smelt of sweat and dust. Cas breathed in the smell of chemicals and tilted his head as he looked around. There were two beds and a couch. Dean threw his stuff on one of the beds and promptly grabbed a beer. He grabbed one for Sam as well. He popped the cap for both and chugged his as he handed Sam the alcohol. Cas sat down on the vacant bed and turned on the TV.
“What’s your name?” The little boy didn’t stop smiling.
“Welcome to St. Liza, Father Novak. I am Bishop Michael Shurley.” Castiel let his hand fall to his side as the Bishop turned his head to indicate for Castiel to follow. “We’re excited to finally have you here.” Castiel tried not to think that the comment was directed at his late arrival.
There were a few raps on the door before the sound of the door opening. Sam poked his head in and looked around. He didn’t see them anywhere and was worried they had gotten out. Sam looked over the little half wall by the door, over to the couch and saw them laying there. He sighed in relief and carried his stuff into the room. Then he noticed the bed.
“I don’t know.” Sam seemed disappointed with that answer, but leant back in his seat either way. Cas looked over at Dean. He had a faint smile playing along his lips as they drove down the road.
The voicemail ended. Cas held the phone in his lap again and looked at Dean.
“After everything,” Dean wrung his hands over his knees. “I- “He choked on his words. They looked painful to get out. “I need you, Cas.” Cas somehow knew that those weren’t the words he was going to say, but he took them anyways. “You stupid angel.” Cas shook his head.
“Have you spoken with your brother about this?” Castiel sometimes wondered if his life would have been different if he went around helping people without the reputation of the priesthood. He could do this for people every day if he were a psychiatrist or a counsellor. Part of him had always been interested in helping people, it was just what avenue he would use to get there. He heard Dean take a deep breath before answering.
“I seem to have scratched myself rather roughly in my sleep.” Castiel set his fork down before he undid the button at his wrist and rolled his sleeve up just an inch to show the marks on his arm. Father Freely leaned in to inspect them with a curious glance.
“We got this, Father, we can clean up here.” Sam offered. He looked more sheepish about having made a mess in the church than to have purged a soul from this world.
“I’ll check out the sister’s house. You and Dean see about the other woman.” Cas pressed the open button just before the timer was going to go off. He took out the burrito and finished it in a few bites. Sam continued to watch the angel as he walked to the door. “But first,” He put his hand on the door handle. He watched as Dean came out of the bathroom. “You two
“Cas.” Dean attempted. Cas still didn’t move. Dean reached down and grabbed the top of Cas’ knee. He squeezed. Cas jolted awake. His startling blue eyes looked around for a second. Dean ordered Cas a burger and extra French fries. Cas blinked a few times as the waitress walked away. Cas barely caught a glimpse of her face, but it didn’t look human. It was like a dog. Cas shook his head and looked back at her, but the image was gone. He wondered if it was his imagination. Dean and Sam shared a worried glance. Cas took a few drinks of his water and looked at Dean.
“It’s been a rough couple of weeks.” There was a creak from the ladder as Sam shot a glance back at the men below him before he resumed his task of fixing the window. Castiel didn’t notice the shared glance between the two brothers as he closed his eyes for a moment. “I’ve got rats that I can’t seem to get rid of.” Castiel let out a sigh as he opened his eyes and this time he saw that Sam and Dean were sharing an unreadable glance between them. “And now this.” He looked down at the empty parish chest as he finished talking.
“What are you doing here?” He said through the open window. They hadn’t discussed this before he left the other morning before Castiel was to leave the church.
“Rather dirty, even for human standards.” Dean nodded. When he got his breath back, he motioned for Cas to follow him. They went back out to the car and took a deep breath of the dry air. The heat of the day was rolling around and sweat broke out on Dean’s forehead. The two walked to the car and once inside Dean promptly removed his jacket. He started up the car and went to check on Sam. Sam was sitting outside the house looking hot and tired. His tie was loosened, and Dean saw sweat bead down his brother’s brow. Dean turned the AC on in the Impala. Sam started walking to them as they rolled up. He slid into the back of the Impala with a sigh.
“You may confess in any form you’d like with me, so long as you trade me your name.” Castiel opened his eyes and turned his head to look at the dark figure behind the screen.
“I never learned how to swim; I fly.” Castiel’s hair was dripping water down on Dean’s face and he had no choice, but to stare up at the soaking wet man in front of him. Dean rubbed the water off of his face, partly because the water was tickling him, and partly because he wanted to hide his embarrassment.
“You’re surprisingly clean for having just gotten laid though?” Dean looked at him from the mirror in the bathroom. “So, you showered at her place or it was someone who could, say, make you instantly clean with a snap of their fingers?” Dean tried to hurry and spit so he could attempt to defend himself, but Sam was too fast. “You don’t have to lie every time you wanna go out and see Cas.” Dean gagged as he swallowed some of the toothpaste.
Dean cleared his throat, trying to clear away some of the tension, “You were cold last night. I got you a blanket.” Cas looked around at the blankets currently wrapped around both of them.
Dean collected himself to the present. “So, what are you saying? Dog catcher gone rabid?” Sam didn’t even look at Dean’s failed attempt at a joke. Cas watched the two converse in silence. He was content with sitting in the back, which smelt of Dean’s after shave, cheeseburgers, and the musky tang of leather. He looked around at the car and saw a balled-up piece of trash. Cas quietly put the cheeseburger wrapper in the to-go bag. Sam and Dean continued to bicker as the car pulled out and they started off. Cas had other modes of transportation – flying, bus, etc. – but he always enjoyed the way he felt when he landed in the back of the old Impala. He listened with one ear as the boys talked about the new case and the other ear was caught in a daydream. Dean had said something concerning the angel and Cas turned his full attention to the brothers. “Anything suspicious on your Angel Radar?” Cas tilted his head to the side and squinted at Dean.
“To look for a bus stop.” He said it as if it was the most natural course of action. He turned once again to start walking away, but Dean’s hold on his shoulder only tightened. He looked down at the hand on his shoulder, which was enough to have Dean take his hand off of him as if he was burnt.
“Good.” They stopped so Castiel could reach down and place a flier on the side of a newspaper box. Dean was looking away towards an open parking lot beside them. Castiel grabbed his basket again in his arms and continued on. If he was going to get any more out of Dean, he would have to play his game. They continued to walk in silence for a few more streets before Castiel sat down on a stray bench and cracked open the water bottle in his basket. He offered the bottle to Dean. Dean took a look at it, hesitancy written over his face before he grabbed it from Castiel and drank about half of it down before looking over guiltily at Castiel and handing it back over. Castiel finished up the last of the water before putting the empty bottle back in his basket.
“You didn’t have to get me anything, Mrs. Hanson. A goodbye would have meant just as much without the gift.” Castiel started to open the wrapping paper and placed the garbage on the pew next to them. He set the box down to help him pull out the gift inside. Hidden amongst the wrapping paper was a beige trench coat. Castiel let his fingers graze over the fabric before Mrs. Hanson’s eager expression had him slipping into the coat. It settled nicely over him and he had to admit, he liked the way it hung off of him. Castiel smiled and held out his hands for Mrs. Hanson to take. The older lady had tears in her eyes as she looked him up and down.
“Oh.” He turned around to look at the clock on the wall. “Thanks.” Castiel didn’t know what else he could really say to Dean. He didn’t know what the boys had done exactly to give him the all clear, but he decided that whatever it was seemed worthy enough for Dean to call him at 5:30 in the morning.
“Why didn’t you fly out of there then?” Dean shot Castiel a smoldering glare, but he couldn’t hold it when he noticed that Castiel’s eyes weren’t on his, but rather trailing down his body. Dean’s breath hitched in his throat as Cas’ eyes didn’t stop at just his chest. They continued well past his navel and seemed to stare for a long while in the vicinity of his flaccid cock. Finally, his eyes trailed back up to look at Dean who was certain his face was a sheet of red. Cas’ eyes darted around his face, settling a few times on Dean’s lips before making their way back to his eyes.
“Eleven months.”
“What? Why?” Dean sent a look to Sam. He sighed dramatically before getting out of the car, leaving the door open for Castiel. Sam got in the back, pouting as he did so.
A few minutes later Sam walked in the door with cheeseburgers and burritos. He poked his head in first as if to check to see the coast is clear. His eyes looked around the room to see both Dean and Cas at opposite ends. He figured it was safe to come in, “I didn’t know what you guys wanted, so I got a little bit of both.” Sam set the food down on the table, taking his salad, and walked back to his seat to continue research.
“I don’t see how that’s relevant to this current situation.” His normally icy blue eyes were shadowed with lust as he stared at Dean mere inches from his face. The intensity was making Dean want to squirm.
“That’s gotta be it, hurry Sammy.” Dean had his back to them, but looked over his shoulder to investigate the jacket. Sam grabbed the jacket from him and set it on the stone floor. Just as he pulled out a container of salt and what looked like matches Timothy’s figure popped up between Castiel and Sam. Sam let out a cry as he was suddenly thrown back, knocking into the column closest to them Castiel gasped as he watched the scene. Dean turned and threw the metal bar at the boy. Sam slowly picked himself before he ran over to dump a large portion of salt on the jacket as the metal bar Dean threw narrowly missed Castiel and went right through Timothy. Castiel looked down at the metal bar that landed just before his feet with a clatter. He watched it while he saw Sam light the whole pack of matches, suddenly throwing the darkened church into a faint glow. He dropped the matches on the coat and the coat went up in a blaze. From behind Castiel he heard that cry again and turned on his heel to watch as Timothy went up in flames behind him before disappearing completely. Castiel dropped to his knees once Timothy had disappeared and began to pray quietly into his cross. His eyes closed, clenched so tight he might have a headache later.
Castiel leaned over to kiss at Dean’s chest, before speaking, “Are you going to make it a habit of thinking about me while you get yourself off or would you prefer me to just take you every time you got the urge instead?” Dean arched his back as the words registered in his brain. He felt his balls tighten once Cas was done speaking and he had to bite his lip to prevent himself from coming.
He found himself dwelling on how just a few days ago his brother had been soulless and how the entire experience had left him immensely unsettled, but his mind was barely able to focus on that when the only images that were coming to mind were of the blue-eyed angel who had helped save his brother. He opened his eyes and rubbed at his face as he tried to dispel the way his blood started to boil at the thought of the trench coat wearing angel that had nothing to do with the heat of the summer night. Dean looked out into the water and watched the fireflies’ flit to and fro in front of the head lights, their lights going invisible in the car’s yellow rays. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the bright blue orbs of the angel looking back at him and it made his pants tighten at the thought. He groaned as he adjusted himself in his jeans and shifted his feet on the hood of the impala. Dean ran a hand through his hair, his imagination running wild as his other hand gripped his thigh.
Castiel was careful when he walked around his rooms not to disturb the salt line that was sitting at the doorway of his bedroom like it was some sort of ghost itself. Dean’s phone number burning in his pocket like it was a flame. He occasionally caught himself playing with the paper while he was working. When he caught himself doing it he quickly removed his hand as if the paper had in fact burned him. Castiel had been curious about the boy buried in the graveyard  and he remembered the boy’s name just as the sun was falling down below the horizon. He remembered the death date and began looking around the several volumes of records kept by the church. He was thankful that the last priests had been so keen to keep records. Castiel found the years he was looking for and searched for a while, figuring out the sorting system the previous priests had in place. He stumbled on the obituaries, his eyes racking over the several names. Finally, Olivers, Timothy jumped out at him and he read all he could on the little boy who had passed. After the initial comments on the boys life there was a note about his death. The words made Castiel bite his lip as he read from the yellowed paper.
