The barrister nodded once. “Quite right. And with Mycroft’s statement to shortly follow, Mrs. Holmes’ plea may change.”
Sherlock had turned his attention back to Finn and John. They were all having fun splashing in the water as the little boy finished his ice cream. Greg couldn't help but think about the little girl, though. “Well nothing can be done to take Finn away, can it?”
“There wasn’t a case,” the DI said it with conviction even if he was starting to doubt his own eyes.
If Sherlock tried to lean back into the thrusting of the fucking machine, it meant his whole upper body had to move. The chains hanging from the collar pulled and tugged against Sherlock's nipples.
“But me…” all five men turned to the door to see Mycroft enter. “I’m not shocked easily but when it comes to Sherlock… you better hope John isn’t the one who decides what to do with you. Hello, sir,” he said, grinning slightly at his Dom. He wrapped his arms around him briefly but made sure to check on his brother as he did so, he seemed content, for now.
“You will give me a suitable answer, pet, or you can go back to copying that dictionary. How far did you get? D?”
"Trouble," Mrs Hudson said, stepping forward. "That's all Frank ever was, except in bed. He was a wonder there."
Sherlock dropped his head. Back to ‘boy’ again and it wasn’t even said in the same soft, pleased tone he had used earlier.
Sherlock shifted slightly, but otherwise didn’t respond. He seemed to be coming out of Panic, but he wouldn’t be out of it fully for a few more hours, at least that was John’s experience. It very rarely occurred and usually he already knew the cause, but now he needed to know what had forced him into such a defensive mood. Once he knew, the same mistake wouldn’t happen twice and he could begin to bring Sherlock back to the ‘real world’. Panic had been explained to him by a previous sub like it was similar to sub-drop, that was another reason for aftercare. John wondered how often this had happened to his pet and what the consequences were when it did. It didn’t really bear thinking about.
John looked back. "Oh, let them have their time together. We don't give them enough. As long, that is, as they keep coming this way."
"I thought I was going to need to split that up like I did those first few days," John said, running his hand over Sherlock's red and warm arse. He helped Sherlock back so he was sat on his knees beside the sofa. "I suppose you have had those lines to keep you busy. Have you learnt your lesson, do you think?" He asked, jerking his head at where the notepad was on the floor.
John pulled a small black box from his pocket which looked like a TV controller. With a flick of the switch, the box undid the force holding Sherlock’s feet to the floor. The Dom reached out, grasped Sherlock by the scruff of the neck and pulled him inside, kicking the door firmly shut behind him.
John made a point to rest his hand at the small of Mycroft's back, in Sherlock's view. "Shame your brother is so well behaved, Sherlock."
The tension between them that could have been cut through with a knife was lifted as Greg smirked. Sherlock sighed in relief.
For the first time in his job, John felt like he should feel guilty. He didn’t, however. He couldn’t. If he did, he would never punish the boy again. Sherlock had deserved it. It wasn’t like he’d forgotten to be respectful. He had come without permission. That was a major broken rule for any Dom and that was the usual punishment that Doms issued. Although he strayed quiet a distance from normal Dom behaviour in many aspects of the Dom/sub interactions, there were some things that had to be done in the correct way. It didn’t mean he had to enjoy it and it didn’t mean he couldn’t offer aftercare. Sherlock should know that, after every punishment they’d spent at least an hour together afterwards, but the lack of wanting comfort now was worrying.
Deciding that his Dom was being rather petty, he rolled over and covered his head with his pillow. As if that would actually achieve anything except making the Dom mad.
Mycroft let his head fall back against the cross. This was all they needed, their little sister and Irene becoming best friends, pals, mates. He looked over at his brother, hoping to see Sherlock pulling a Houdini.
Each cane stroke was the same distance below the one just before until he had six perfect lines across his arse.
Sherlock automatically went to crawl, but John grabbed his collar and pulled him to his feet. He waited until their two guests were out of the room before he leant in and nipped at Sherlock's ear. “Good boy. I'm proud of you. Now go straight in and kneel in your usual spot.”
He sat and stared into his half empty coffee mug. Deep down he knew he shouldn't have left Sherlock, but he had seen no alternative. How could he look his sub in the eye when he had been the one to find the evidence that had damned him? The evidence that meant he wasn't his anymore. There had to be a way to fix that, fix the bloody law.
The DI looked down at his sub, his head was bowed, much like his brother’s. He didn’t ask if the older man had anything pressing at work, he wouldn’t be here if he did, but it was also about time they went out for an evening again. “Yes, I think we will.”
"Wha- Is there a case?" The doctor batted his sub away, not awake enough to really think. "Did Greg call?" He sat up, rubbing at his eyes and groaning.
“No. I mean… I am but I can’t stop thinking about her either. So yes. We probably should see what Finn thinks.”
John held the door for Greg as the Superintendent carried his boy from the room. "I never would have dreamt that one day I would find Sherlock's brother adorable, but there he is."
Mycroft couldn't help but feel proud of his brother. It hadn't taken him long to work out what Irene wanted, nor do it.
Greg smiled, but of course the government official couldn't see that. He turned on his heel and glanced at Sherlock. "You do realise your boy is watching mine, right?"
It made both of them jump in surprise when the door was pushed open and Greg came in dragging Mycroft by the scruff of his neck.
Greg had started the process of restraining his own boy with a golden rope. He quickly had Mycroft's wrists bound together and to the collar he wore.
It was almost as if Sherlock had gone into shock. He just stood there, blinking, then a tremor set in.
“The more you fight this now, the worse it will be for you. That rope will keep getting tighter as will the weights. Behave, calm down and I will let you down. At which point I will deliver your considerable tally, you will apologise to me, and we will go and have a nice conversation with your brother who will no doubt be in a foul mood after waiting for his petulant brat of a baby brother to get his head on straight. For several hours I might add.”
“Good, pet.” He leaned over to kiss the detective, on the lips this time. He made it gentle as he was determined to separate himself from Sherlock’s past experiences with arsehole Doms, especially this unnamed one.
"It's our wedding. We don't have to invite anyone you don't want to be there." John crossed over to him and rested his hands on his shoulders. "It's entirely up to you."
John slouched down in his seat, appreciating how talented Mycroft's hands were. "If he's this good at massaging feet, how good is he at a full body massage?"
Eurus held out her hand for the device. She didn't recall obtaining it, but she had just ordered whatever she had seen on the TV. The device was heavy and she liked the idea of Irene putting it on Sherlock. Handing it back to the Dominatrix, she skipped over to her brother. "I can't wait to see it on you, little big brother."
“I’m nervous. What if I mess up? What if I do something that angers you? Or worse, disappoints you?”
"She should have pled guilty from the beginning," Mycroft said darkly. "But she's only ever thought of herself.
Sherlock shrugged. "Whatever it is, it doesn't appear dangerous." He sucked in a breath. "Unless we're not meant to think they are dangerous." He turned and looked at the thing. "We have been so focused on what these things are that we haven't asked why they are here."
"Oh, it's not about the power. It's being able to do things for the people you care about and not having to worry about the repercussions."
John wanted nothing more than to sit and hug his boyfriend for hours on end, but it wouldn't help unlock Sherlock from his head.
“Yeah,” the sUnited responded, but he was already engrossed in reading the case notes that the DI had given him, making sure to ignore anything that that pain in the arse Donovan had written. He had always found that no matter what the case, the Sergeant’s views were always biased.
His ruined orgasm squirted into the tube at the tip of his cock, his come squirting through the sound and dribbling out the end.
“Don’t-” Sherlock tried, but John shook his head as he smacked the bed with it, trying to get his attention.
"Ah," Sherlock said in realisation. Despite the look on the older woman's face, the detective found himself still not wanting to make this easy for her.He tried to jerk his head away, but her grip was too tight.
Sherlock remained calm and quiet when John entered the room, not kicking up a fuss until the Dom came close.
Sherlock looked down at it with a forlorn look on his face and sighed the sigh of the long suffering.
After a moment, Sherlock nodded, if only to get Mycroft away from what he was sure would be a bollocking if he said no to the proposal.
As he climbed the stairs to place his new under clothes in his chest of drawers, he noticed his bedroom door was ajar. He always shut it because Sherlock wasn’t allowed in there and a closed door was a lot less temptation than an open one. He didn’t lock it however, John had always had a level of trust with his subs, and they always responded better to the trust working both ways. Him not locking the door to his bedroom meant that the subs stayed out through choice; through the will of not wanting to upset their Dom. He wanted to believe he could trust his pet, but as he loomed closer to his room he was finding it less and less likely.
Sherlock smirked this time, he should have known John wouldn’t be mad at him for the weird race across half of London. He glanced over at the copper talking to the Californian man. “I’m sorry, sir. But…” he inclined his head. They were being pointed at now.
“No, sir. That wasn’t the worst bit. He would carry me to my room afterward and drop me on the floor and the bubble I was in suddenly… disappeared.”
He had plenty of time to think about what his Dom had said throughout the day, from the things said in anger to the more gentle things said as the day wore on.
“Now, pet.” This time it was an order and the frame of mind Sherlock was in, he wouldn’t argue any further.
John glanced at the tray on the coffee table and shook his head. “No. That will be everything, thank you Elsie.”
Sherlock stayed on the stool in the kitchen as John saw Mycroft and Greg out. He had been happy to see his brother, and he had enjoyed the night before like he never thought he could at this age.
“Think what you like, brother-mine, I would never put you in harm’s way for the sake of drama, as you put it.”
This time Sherlock didn’t stop himself making sound around the gag. He didn’t know what was pressed up against his arse but it was big, hard, cold and round. And he didn’t like it.
"That sort of money wouldn't touch the sides in your account, why was Anthea so bothered?" Sherlock asked with his new found freedom of speech.
Sherlock hurried to the bedroom and got rid of his clothes. He didn't just ditch them on the bed, he folded them and left them on the chair, then hurried back to the doctor.
It wasn't like he had to plan a way back in this time, which was where he had shot himself in the foot a few weeks ago.
In next to no time, John was back holding his boy and the two now arrested Doms were against the back wall, their arms pulled back and cuffed behind two poles for suspension bondage when the building was used for its actual function.
"But it would make me feel better. Please." He let himself lean on her and went so far as to rest his head on her shoulder, hoping to manipulate her. It seemed to work as she nodded once.
"No, you're not." They hadn't been here when Sherlock had first got here, in fact it had been weeks into the contract before he had allowed them back. He hadn't thought the sub would be able to deal with them.
"Do you know why you're being punished, submissive?" John's voice took on the formal punishment tone that Sherlock really didn't like, the old punishments were hardly casual but he made himself sound so detached.
"Oh, god. Sir, please. Not long, sir," Greg admitted. He knew John was going to push him until he broke and then he'd end up behaving as badly as the brothers.
“Thanks, Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock hugged the older lady to him for a moment before he did anything else.
“Look, it doesn’t matter!” Sherlock couldn’t understand why he suddenly didn’t want to talk to the older man, it wasn’t even the conversation that made him tense, it was just being here, in his comforting arms in general. “Victor would cane me severely and Wilkes would lock me in my bedroom for a week. After the normal punishment. There, discussion had and it is really not that big of a deal.”
“You’re not playing the numbers, you’re playing me. Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill? Is it a bluff? Or a double-bluff? Or a triple-bluff?”
Eurus appeared on the screen. "You idiot! Can't you control two men that are surrounded by guards? What use are you?"
“Sherlock laughed so hard the juice he was drinking at the time came out his nose and went all over the sandwiches.”
John brushed his hand through his hair again as he worked feeling back into the younger man’s arms. “Should have calmed down quicker then.” He rolled him over so he was more comfortable. “If you had fought me much longer I think I would have needed to sedate you.”
Sherlock tried to look innocent to no avail. "I don't know what you are talking about," he said haughtily.
“Not tired anyway.” He climbed out of the car first and opened the flat door. He ran up the seventeen steps, ditched his coat over the kitchen table and knelt beside the armchair John had taken earlier.
“Yes, sir,” he sobbed again. He was still in Panic, even if he was at the edge now, so he no doubt saw the reminder as a threat of punishment later. “I understand.” John wasn’t entirely comfortable with him addressing him like that, but the last thing he wanted was him thinking he was being turned away, now, after how good he had been.
Mycroft shoved his hands under his bum to keep himself from removing the blindfold. The Superintendent noticed. "Problem, pet?"
“I think your brother was expecting some sort of witty retort. That doesn’t happen anymore, does it, boy?”
“I’ve known him for years. I train the subs that he needs for work. Or I did… before I took you on.”
"Thanks for getting me in trouble," Sherlock shot at his brother. He jogged over to the Doms without looking back.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “You can tell him when he gets here. For a 3 year old you’re too excited for this!”
The brothers eyes met amidst Mycroft's thrashing. Is was Sherlock who looked away first. He had gone bright red with both anger and humiliation. He couldn't stand that his brother was seeing Irene do this to him.
"It's what my nephew wants to play. Besides, I doubt very much that he's learned the concept of money, let alone the maths required for the game." Mycroft winked at Finn. "Besides, you have to decide what you and John want before I can do anything."
"Oh, Myc, just wait until I tell Greg." John withdrew his finger from the sub's hole. "Hang in there, boy."
The Holmeses both looked down at their restrained members. The way the other two men just wandered about without much thought for their lack of… arousal, made them pout and frown.
Sherlock’s issues were solved when John let go of his hand before they were in sight, the Dom had seen the dilemma written on his boy’s face. “I said I didn’t want to make things difficult for you, pet.”
The sub struggled not to move, but it was a difficult position to maintain. Despite what John had said, he struggled to go back to 'normal'. He'd managed to be perfect for days. Why bother being not perfect now?
Sherlock bowed his head, resting it on the Superintendent's hip. The blasted machine was hitting just the right spot. He groaned and shook, unable to put together a coherent thought.
With a heavy sigh, the older Dom pulled his phone from out of his jacket pocket that was on the coat rack in the corner and dialled his sub's number.
Sherlock’s hands reluctantly fell away from the chain, but clenched so hard his knuckles went white.
Eurus seemed almost disappointed by the answer. She paced around both brothers, pushing Irene out of the way. "I intend to get a decent reaction from one of you. Irene, take big brother to their cell. Leave Sherlock with me."
Tentative hands unclasped and slowly he reached over for his favourite thing, grinning widely when his hands clasped around it and he could feel it beneath his fingers.
“What’s this one?” Finn asked. He’d given up keeping up with Siger and had sat in the shallow part of the water, making his grandad pause with him.
Siger was grinning at the doorway by that point, Finn in his arms. He couldn't help but chuckle at his son's treatment. The way Martha treated him was nothing like his ex wife had done. She was playful with how she handled him and would never really hurt him. But not only did Sherlock seem to be resigned to it, he seemed comfortable with it despite the uncomfortable situation.
Sherlock smiled up at his brother who was still stood ankle deep. "Why don't you join us, brother-mine?"
“Always, Sally,” he smiled politely and lifted the tape, he stepped under and then held it up for his Dom.
Sherlock felt a pang of guilt in his chest, but he ignored it. He had still ended up on his knees. It didn’t matter if he was tied to the table or not.
“He’s alright, Sherlock,” he nodded his assurances at the same time. “He’s fine. Been busy at work, very busy, in fact.”
"Good." John climbed out of bed. "Will you help me make sure Sherlock eats something? What do you think he wants?"
Sherlock caught sight of him and his breath hitched in his throat. He looked down quickly, trying to recover, as he felt subspace creep around him. Given the Dom’s height, Sherlock always saw his suit as an extra offence when it came to being authoritarian, with a tie he just looked… well, gorgeous was the only word he could think of.
John grabbed his shoulder and spun him around to face him. "No more hiding." At that, the detective made a whining sound and tried to duck his head but his Dom caught him by the chin and didn't let him. "I said, no more hiding."
Sherlock nodded his head, to keep himself distracted from the fact the Dom seemed to be tying the rope to the bench. It was odd, but he seemed to be enjoying the feeling.
Sherlock moaned his complaint and tried shifting to get John to touch him in a more satisfying place.
"Ta." John slipped down so he could sit on the floor with his boy. The whole time, he kept his fingers moving in Sherlock's hair.
"Indeed. Now, lay across my lap and show me that pretty arse of yours. I have the urge to spank it." John laughed at the Superintendent's expression. "Problem boy?"
When he came back from the boot he was holding two padded blindfolds. He threw one to the backseat that John caught and he tied the other around Mycroft's head.
The sub stood and then held his hand out for his Dom. Eyeing it warily the doctor took his hand and Sherlock pulled him to his feet.
Sherlock was knelt beside John at the table, feeling distant. The routine so far this morning had been identical to yesterday. Well, John’s part of the routine had been identical. Sherlock had decided that sulking when his Dom arrived at 7 was not the best way to go to the toilet. He also didn’t bother tugging at the cock cage when he went to the loo and let John wash him without a fuss. Because of this, his tally was only as low as 7, surprisingly small given the preceding days events.
Sherlock shifted against him, moaning slightly as something touched his cock. It wouldn’t be anywhere near as painful as it had been a few hours ago but that didn’t mean it would be completely desensitized. In a way the Dom felt it and tensed when Sherlock grumbled something again.
"Hello?" Sherlock said. "My fiance thinks he knows you. What is your name?" When no answer forthcoming, he turned to John? "See. Nothing. It's not some spectre from another realm."
He performed several tests which led him to the conclusion that the things were real for a given value of real. He hadn't really doubted it, but it had been remotely possible the things were a mass hallucination.
“No!” John barked, his tone was not to be messed with. “You do as you are told, boy! And that you need to learn.”
Sherlock inclined his head, reaching forward to grab the folder. “Yeah?” He perched back on to one of the arms of the sofa, his eyes flickering over the top page, taking in anything of relevance.
Another pointed glare from the army doctor. He was not giving Sherlock an inch. Sherlock realised he wasn’t going to at all, that was what this whole relationship was about.
John grabbed him by the curls and pulled him up straight, then he pressed his foot into the back of his leg, knocking him down to his knees.
Sherlock Holmes, who acted emotionally like a teenager – the mood swings, the sarcastic comments - was in fact nearly 24. He was slouched in one of the chairs, in Dom Doctor John Watson’s rather large front room, his long legs spread and one foot tapping against the wooden coffee table. He was trying to think of a way out because he knew for a fact the front door was out of the question. There was no doubt that his bloody annoying git of a brother would have placed one of his men on the front door, if not one, then two. They would have no qualms in throwing him into the wall until the Dom appeared and took over.
Greg was immediately taken aback. For a start, Sherlock was knelt as comfortably as what Mycroft would in the same situation and another had he just called him
He quickly snapped the cuffs around his wrists that Greg had given him out in the corridor, well aware they'd be needed. Then he grabbed him by the arm and spun him around.
"Yes, sir," Sherlock wasn't against the idea of playing, he was against the idea of playing with his cock in a cage and his arse flaming red hot.
The detective yelped around the gag and threw his head back as John let the flogger fall intermittent with the superintendent's.
Sherlock’s face is absolute manic delight as he glanced up at him. “Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake.”
“I’m sure the girls can figure it out,” Greg said with a chuckle. “The amount of this stuff they have at home is immense.”
“I don’t need a leash, I know how to stay in a bed by myself.” He didn’t know why the idea of a leash was so demeaning, all subs had them.
"He did what you wanted!" Mycroft yelled trying to get to his feet. He couldn't bear to see Sherlock just hang there, not struggling, defeated.
"That idiot woman!" Sherlock spat. "She's determined to get herself killed, though I don't know why I should care."
The detective shook his head, “John won't mind.” Even so, when he knocked on the door it was tentative.
“Hmm,” Greg seemed to ponder, amazed at the changes in one Sherlock Holmes. “What can I do for you?”
John smiled sadly, he should have known. Without wasting time, John scooped his boy up and carried him into the house. "Oh, pet, I wish you'd told me you'd hurt yourself. We wouldn't have had to sit through Irene yapping away."
At about 6am, Sherlock got to his feet and whacked the cell door with his fist. It hurt, but he didn't care. He'd worked out the shift change over was 7am, the guy outside the door would be exhausted.
"But-" Mycroft cut himself off before his complaint could fully form. From the looks the two Doms gave him, it was a very good thing he had closed his mouth when he did.
As me making it perfectly clear that this is a DOM AND SUB UNIVERSE doesn't work or the fact that I have made it perfectly clear I don't want BORING OPINIONS from the people who CHOOSE TO READ SOMETHING THEY KNOW WILL OFFEND THEIR LITTLE EGOS doesn't work or the fact I DONT CARE what haters think does not work I have decided to name and shame them as a last resort.
John didn’t answer just waited. When no polite response was forthcoming he went and grabbed a chair from the kitchen and took a seat by the door so he could watch him. He was still breathing heavily.
“20, sir,” he said immediately. He was not going through 60 with any paddle, he was an emotional wreck as it was... but he knew the second he saw his brother he would be likely to lose it again... he couldn’t face it.
Obviously noticing the internal war Sherlock was having, John inclined his head. “Wise choice, boy.”
She just pointed upstairs with her frying pan, not bothered by the bright pink case and then turned to go back into her flat.
The cage soon followed, wrapping Sherlock's cock up snuggly as he fixed it to the sound and then the cock ring around the base of his sac.
He got himself into position and began his usual evening spanking. After 5 strokes, he had to remind his boy that he should be counting and ended up starting from the beginning.
Sherlock lurched up out of his seat, but Irene shoved him down face first on the table. She pressed his arm up his back and twisted his wrist slightly.
"Yeah." Greg followed John into the kitchen. Both men knew the brothers needed to talk, even if they did so without uttering a single word.
“I change my plea,” she said quickly. There was clearly something in Siger’s testimony that she didn’t want the whole world to hear about.
John shrugged. "If attention is what he wants…" He walked out of the bedroom and across the cottage to the wet playroom.
After a minute or so she began banging on the door. “Out, Holmes!” What was he going to do in 1 minute? Get stuck in the toilet, he snorted at the idea, knowing Donovan's level of intelligence she probably thought that was likely.
Sherlock grabbed the wrist that held his collar. “Fighting me won’t make this easier.” He glared until the boy let his wrist go.
"Alright, then." John started washing more private bits of his sub and soon Sherlock's cock stood up tall and proud. The Dom stroked it a few times, watching his pet's face closely.
The detective worried as they walked towards the crime scene. He loved holding John’s hand, it made him feel equal in a way he had never felt with a Dom before, but he didn’t know if he could keep hold of his temper if Donovan started making comments about it. If he couldn’t keep on top of his temper, he would disappoint John, the only Dom he had actually cared about disappointing. However, he was faced with a dilemma, he didn’t want to let go of his hand because he didn’t want to upset the older man either. He didn’t want him thinking he didn’t like it anymore because he really did, even in public it wasn’t bothering him like he thought it would.
The Dom dry washed his face, taking several deep breathes while leaning against the rear wheel arch.
"It's never aimed at me though," the way Sherlock said it made the statement sound more like a question than it should have done.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock agreed, he daren’t not. John clearly didn’t know who this man was apart from a fellow Dom and he had just lied about how they knew each other. He knew from experience that he daren’t interrupt the man. He had a temper of, well… he was never calm, in fact, this was the calmest he had ever seen the other man.
“Hide,” Sherlock said quickly, and the pair of them scrambled into the front room and under the table.
Sherlock’s head jerked from side to side in what looked like a painful motion. “No, sir. Please… please don’t make me go. I like it here, sir. I like it with you.”
Sherlock snapped his head around to look at his brother. "I'm not!" At that precise moment, Irene's foot impacted his ribs, sending him sprawling.
“Now as you’ve been moderately well behaved, I am going to give you a choice. You can have the total amount of your tally tonight at 7 pm or I can halve it as it is and give you half now, but I will use the slightly worse paddle than I would usually use for routine punishment.”
Greg paused by the shoe rack to slip out of his, by now rather uncomfortable, shoes. It had been one hell of a day.
It was his brother who appeared at the door. “You're amazing with him,” he offered once he knew John had shut the bedroom door behind them to help the boy get changed.
“In the front room. What’s going on? What’s with the missed calls? And the tone of voice?” John didn’t know which answer he wanted first, but any would do and he needed to get it all out.
Finn struggled to get down so he could watch what John was doing. “Step back, little man, this thing fizzes since Sherlock tried to dry my trainers in it.”
John shook his head with a smirk, "I don't want to wake him up too soon or he'll wake up in brat mode."
Ben suddenly burst out laughing, he had nothing left to lose, his best mate and his recently acquired job gone to shreds in seconds.
He jumped to his feet with ease and took a few paces back. He paused, listening for sounds of the Dom again. Content that there weren’t any, he took a run at the door and just as he reached the threshold he jumped.
John gave the detective's cock a sharp smack with the crop. "Get out of your Mind Palace right now! I want you to experience everything I do to you."
He shushed her and waited until he and Sherlock were out of earshot. "He's had a tough few years. We can talk about it at home, but for now, don’t treat him any differently than you would any other little boy, yeah?" Beth frowned, watching finn closely.
She glanced at the phone which had started ringing again. For the third time in under a minute. “Is it about to get worse?”
He threw himself back on the sofa and tucked his feet up beneath him so he could try and focus on his Mind Palace again.
Sherlock looked up in shock, groaning internally as the plug shifted. When he made no move to comply, John gripped him by the curls and pulled him upright.
The detective just ducked his head and the Dom huffed. Mycroft was nodding reassuringly though, maybe soon the sub would talk.
"And if that isn't enough of a threat - that you know I will stick to - how about 5 instant slaps with the strap?"
Mycroft frowned at his little brother, trying to see what was different about him. All at once he understood: Sherlock had turned into complete putty, his usual abrasiveness completely absent for the moment.
Mycroft felt himself getting hard as Greg kissed him relentlessly. He didn't stop even when Mycroft began to struggle to breathe. Just as the sub's vision began to go grey at the edges, Greg pulled back. They both stood there, panting for air.
The kneeling detective didn't move. His leg had hurt, but knelt on it like this was agony, on top of the fact all he seemed to be doing was embarrassing his Dom, letting him down despite all his intentions not to. He glanced at Kate from under his curls, but she was looking down also. It made Sherlock think that the other sub likely didn't have permission, something John seemed to have overseen.
It appeared as if he was trying to put more weight onto his feet. John once again wasn’t bothered and used his cane to prod the back of his sub's knee and knock him to the floor. He hit the ground with a gentle thud and then yelled out something that John couldn’t quite catch, but whatever it was it was angry. The Dom needed to get on top of this. Fast. He gripped him by the back of the neck and pushed him face down. A hook appeared in the floor and John reached around, kneeling at his sub's back to clip it to the collar.
“Until you earn it! I will refer to you as ‘boy’ or ‘pet’ depending on the attitude I receive from you and the level of cooperation you offer. Now, rule one: when I enter a room you are in, you kneel. And you kneel without fail. No matter what you are doing.”
“Am I going to have to make you put your head in my-” John cut off as a mass of curls moved over from one side of the bed to land in his lap.
Sherlock woke the next morning before any of the others. He rested his cheek on the palm of his hand and enjoyed watching his Dom sleep. He knew John would find it a bit creepy if he knew, but he didn't. He never did, that was the beauty of it. All too soon he was bored, he rolled over and jumped on his Dom. "Wake up, John! Wake up right now!"
She had an evil glint in her eye as she called out; “Oi, Freak, I want a word with the organ grinder, not the monkey. That’s you by the way,” she added.
"Come on, boy," he ordered, getting to his feet and helping Sherlock up. "Time we went to the den for a while."
The younger man was speechless, “Well, I guess we should head back upstairs.” He ruffled his sub’s curls and then realised how dangerous that could be, but his boy just skipped back to the door humming to himself. If anyone asked him if he skipped, there was not a hope in the world that he would agree.
When he was done, the sub turned to stare at him, rolling his shoulders, his arms were stiff, but nowhere near what he was expecting.
"I've got him!" A very wet and laughing John said as he sat up, pulling his sub up with him. He had a spluttering Sherlock by the dripping curls.
"Shame you've been such a naughty boy, Sherlock." The thrashing increased tenfold at those words. "Oh stop being a child," Greg clipped him on the back of the head. Greg picked up the pegs and put them back on Sherlock's cock. "When you get your arse calmed down, I'll start again."
John sat down on the bed and dry washed his face. "I haven't stopped loving you and I never will, but I can't let you keep doing this to me. I don't want to be the... the bad guy all the time. I can't take it anymore."
When a waiter came over to take their order, Mycroft was rather surprised to see that Sherlock didn’t look embarrassed about where he was knelt, he didn’t look shifty, just straightened up slightly. He just spoke to the young man in a calm manner, ordering John's for him.
Photographs had been the last thing on Mycroft's mind. He had been thinking of her so called skills as a dominatrix and how much he didn't want to see them put to use first-hand.
Greg groaned more and shivered with the renewed sensations. The shade of red that he turned was spectacular.
The boy's head jerked up to glance at his Dom, he frowned in confusion, he didn't like that tone of voice. How could John say that? He was sorry.
"You're track record is against you, 'Lock." Mycroft grasped him by the wrist and held on tight. "Now behave like a good boy. No more running."
"At least I can make you more comfortable." He ran a hand down to Sherlock's ankles and started on those ropes as well.
This time, clearly seeing the fact he was bondage free as enough of a reward to behave Sherlock crawled towards John’s bedroom and towards the bed.
“You should be licking and hollowing out your cheeks, Sherlock, the gag does not prevent that.” The doctor sighed heavily. “You can be as quick or as slow perfecting this as you like, but pointing out the obvious, you don’t like it much so logic would suggest GETTING ON WITH IT!” John ended on a yell making the younger man flinch.
By the time the bath was finished, the entire bathroom was a complete wreck. There was water and bubbles splashed everywhere. Sherlock did manage to find some dry-ish towels for them to use to dry off with, then he sent Finn into the bedroom to get dressed whilst he used the towels to soak up most of the mess.
Finn was already on his feet and out the door. But John yelled ‘no’ too loudly, concerned the boy was about to charge out onto a busy street. The affects were instantaneous. Finn charged into the bedroom and out of sight.
It took a matter of minutes to locate one that stayed away from windows and magnets and even less time to descend. He jumped to the ground and rolled before hopping back to his feet. Yes! He skipped down the steps and sat on the bottom one. He’d done it, he had actually done it, he had beaten Mycroft! That had to be 3 up!
He got carried away in his thoughts watching his sub on the screen. He would need to speak to Mycroft at the nearest opportunity.
Sherlock rested his head against his arm and hid in his Mind Palace. He could ignore the feeling of humiliation in his cock, even as John began nudging it with a riding crop.
"No apology, no play time," the doctor said sternly. He refused to let himself be moved when the little boy's bottom lip began to tremble. "It's your choice, Finn."
Sherlock looked for something to throw at the doctor. The Union Jack pillow was close by, so he launched it at John.
The muscles in his jaw worked for a moment before he finally made himself growl out, "How can I please you, mistress?"
When John realised how tired his boy looked, he knew it would be another slow day, maybe subspace would tire him out enough to make him sleep.
So here the brothers were, beside one another, their hands above their heads as they were marched towards the governor's office in Sherrinford. He didn't know why they still had to put their hands up, they were never armed, maybe it was the sense of defeat Eurus wanted.
Sherlock dropped to his knees away from John, looking down at the floor between them, “I’m sorry, sir. I’m sorry. Please don’t leave me, sir. I’ll be better. I like it here. I'm good here. I’ll be better, sir. I promise. Please don’t make me leave...” Sherlock was sobbing now and John couldn’t help but gather him in his arms and hold him tight, like one might do with a small child, because that was exactly what he was like in Panic: a child.
Sherlock leant forward and snagged a piece of toast from the tray and then realised what he had done and glanced nervously at the doctor. “It’s alright, pet. I’m glad you’re hungry.” He smiled before devouring not just one piece of toast but three and an apple.
"Oh, do grow up, Sherlock Holmes." Mrs. Hudson reached under the table and snagged the detective by the ear, then pulled him out from under it.
At that, Finn jumped off the stool and ran to John. "But I need you!" he said, arms outstretched and demanding to be picked up.
Greg let out an obscene moan and grasped Mycroft's head, pulling it in close. He came down his sub's throat with an absolute look of sheer bliss on his face.
Douglas paced towards the pair of them, he scowled down at the kneeling man. “Fucking hell! Sherlock Holmes. It’s been a while.”
He didn't want to argue, so the detective sipped at it. He understood what John was saying and, yes, perhaps his Dom needed to stay on top of his temper, but wasn't it Sherlock's fault for rousing it in the first place? No matter the angle one looked at it, this had been his own fault. John must know that too, deep down because... "You haven't called my anything but Sherlock since I unpacked your bag." As soon as he had said it, he ducked his head.
Greg just squeezed him tighter, it wasn’t the first time he had brought it up and he wasn’t wrong. But none of them could explain it, it was just a part of him that maybe, if they worked at it, would become a distant memory.
“Do you want me to start quoting the law at you, Donovan?” It would have been quite amusing doing it at a police officer. “Until my submissive has been charged with anything, he is still my submissive! You will bloody well take me to him or I will be speaking to my solicitor. You are, of course, aware who Sherlock's brother is?”
He knelt up where John had previously specified and tried to keep his movements slow with no jerks to prohibit the moving of the chains beneath his clothes. The problem with focusing all his attention on the clamps was the occasional brush of the new butt plug across his prostate. He could feel the beginnings of an erection attempting to swell within its tight confines.
"The ghosts?" he asked, getting a weird affirmative noise In his head. "You know what they are?" He received the same noise and the screen turned to a picture of a metal man. "You've been scanning that space thing too. Are they dangerous?" he asked. The reply he got was almost immediate and overwhelming in its affirmation. His first thought was, John.
“If you’re well behaved, I’ll let you down here, and the better you are, the more equipment you can have from the cupboard.” He indicated a cupboard in the corner that was locked in a similar way to his cuffs.
She reached between them and pulled on the chain that connected their cocks. Both of them grimaced and made sounds of pain.
“I’m taking this one back to Baker Street,” John interrupted them. “He’s going to fall asleep pretty soon.”
“Do you remember us, shitbag?” Ben hissed in his ear again. Sherlock hated that, it was just another way to be ‘on top’.
The government official snapped his head back around and glared at her. If she could have read the thoughts in his mind, she would have been terrified.
This time Greg slapped him. "I've told you several times to shut it. John, could you fetch a gag please?"
He rang off and sighed, he would check all the rooms on this floor in order. The only room with anything of significance with what Mycroft had just said was the one next to Sherlock’s.
He walked out of the front building, already in full dominance mode, it was like he already knew what his friend was going to say.
Sherlock couldn't work out why she was turning away to speak. He could still hear her even if he couldn't see what was in her hands. It was easily deducible.
It reminded Sherlock of that day all those years ago when he had first come to Sherrinford. When he had smashed up that coffin after putting Molly through hell.
"You played with her too. On family holidays. At home. At the weekends. You even played games with our tutor, winding him up with your nonsense."
Sherlock continued sucking on the cock as if it was John's fingers, only to make the point that he could if he wanted to.
"Doesn't work that way, mate," the DI said, his voice rough with sleep. "He's your sub. Do something about him."
He realised this Domme was probably a little - or rather a lot - harsher with her sub than John was with his. The detective was instantly glad of that. And the guilt rose up again.
“How often do I get John on his own these days? Without Finn or Sherlock within 10 yards. And anyway… I didn't think your brother would believe me.” Greg looked a bit sheepish about his last statement.
John had just stood there for the entirety of the conversation watching his sub with amusement. He hadn’t gone too far and had been rather subtle with his accusations, well rather subtle when it came to Sherlock, and these two new people that his boy seemed to know quite well both had deserved it.
Sherlock was scrambling in his left coat pocket in search of what, John didn’t know. Suddenly he was waving a warrant card at the windscreen of the cab.
All John did however was bend down to pull a small cap out the tip. Then he fitted a small bag to the end of the cage.
His arms weren’t aching yet, but there was more of a strain than normal because of the way they were pulled back and he was under no illusion that he would be there for a lot longer than a quarter of an hour.
“What happened, Sherlock?” The Dom repeated. He would get an answer, even if he had to force it from the sub.
The detective screwed his face up in confusion as his brother's Dom entered the cell, where was his brother? “What this time?” He grumbled. “More fake evidence?”
Between the happy look on Finn's face and the lopsided smile on John's there was nothing the detective could do but agree. "Very well. We're engaged." He kissed John, then stepped back grinning, surprised at how happy the prospect made him.
It has come to the point in this story where the people who like it outweigh the people who don't. For that reason I intend to carry on, as I have said in previous chapters, but for the haters let me make this perfectly clear.
“We've come to check up on Sherlock,” Greg said. He had hold of Mycroft's hand. The older man was stood a little behind Greg, with one hand behind his back.
"Hmm, good boy," John whispered still nuzzling into his shoulder. He kept it up a bit longer, then grasped the fleshlight and pumped it a few more times, a bit more vigorously.
They all headed out the door and took the path down to the beach. The wind blew, causing Sherlock's curls to wave around wildly. Greg and Mycroft walked hand in hand. John walked next to his sub, close enough for their arms to brush together from time to time.
John caught his chin in his hand. Sherlock didn’t resist as the doctor sought his gaze. The Dom searched for a moment before letting him go and cupping his cheek instead, apparently happy with what he found. Remorse, guilt and a touch of… fear? The beginnings of submission. John smiled.
Sherlock blinked away tears of relief as he knelt by his Dom. The last thing he wanted to do was draw attention to himself.
John took hold of the younger man’s hands and brought them down behind him to rest at his lower back.
The detective didn't argue, but he knew he wouldn't sleep. As soon as John went to sleep, he was going to sneak out of the bed.
Moriarty snorted. “DI Lestrade is one hell of a man to get close to in his department, but we all know his infamous baby brother is where Mycroft's heart truly lies.”
Greg watched the kneeling detective for a moment before nodding once. “Well Mycroft? I think it’s time to come out of this silly mood. Panic won’t do you any good.”
The Sergeant rolled her eyes, so much for an interview, she thought to herself as she slammed the alarm. The uniformed side of the force could deal with this tantrum.
"Oh, Finn, I'm not angry," John said, crouching down beside him. "I was just curious. I didn't know we had them is all."
The Dominatrix walked over to the chest and, with a leer at Sherlock, opened it. "Oh, these can be fun." She picked up one of the dildo shaped gags. "I rather like this one."
Sighing heavily, John let Greg take control and the Superintendent threw the younger man into the wall. It startled Sherlock so much that he actually went still. The olater Dom took advantage of the fact and threw him over his shoulder. "To the playroom?" he asked.
He didn't do anything, just looked like he was ready to chat. The guns weren't bothering him at all? Sherlock laughed, they were more similar than he thought.
Sherlock stopped himself from frowning, keeping his annoyance of the older man’s enjoyment of the situation to himself. “Am I going again, sir?” He asked quietly; resigned and slightly out of breath.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. This was the first Dom he could speak to like that. He would have had his arse beaten so bloody with any of his previous Doms. He was so glad he could speak to this one as if they were on the same level, even though he knew that the older man tended to have the upper hand. He was getting used to that idea now. “Being rude, sir? That’s not like you.”
He quickly applied them and joined them together. He ran one chain from the pair down his chest and to his cock cage and he ran another chain up to his collar. By doing it like this John hoped, Sherlock's movements would be more fluid, but he wouldn't be so quick to act, having to first think through the consequences.
"Suck," the doctor ordered as he thrust two fingers into his boy's open mouth. "And make me believe you want to."
John managed to get the boy across the room and onto the bed, it took a lot of manoeuvring as the brat did not stop fidgeting the entire time and trying to lift Sherlock when he wanted to be lifted was such an easier feat.
Sherlock had been with the professional Dom for three weeks and improvements had been seen in nearly all aspects, but only slightly in some compared to others.
Each burglary had been planned, each one had been a practice, and it was clear from the deaths in the third that he was escalating. But was the escalation planned? Or was it contingency... no witnesses?
Several hours later and John had decided he wanted to walk along the beach again and Greg seemed to agree.
He saw the dildo. He was sure Irene wanted him to fetch at once. Getting it out of the trunk was a much more difficult task. He dropped it twice before he was able to get a firm grip on it.
Finally they pulled apart, but this time Eurus stepped towards Mycroft. She grabbed his chin and tilted his head from side to side, up and down. "Playing ball?"
Greg could no longer thrash around on the Dom's lap, which meant he couldn't rub his cock against his thigh either. He had to focus on staying still to stop from hurting his arms further.
The sub ducked his head again, this was ridiculous. He knew ducking his head was a bad idea when he could see what his Dom was doing and that made him even more uncomfortable. He sighed in relief when the washing machine beeped and John got to his feet.
“Oh, yes, Mrs. Hudson, if that is okay? I live a way out of the city and he needs to be here for this case.”
He replied 'no comment' to the remainder of Donovan's questions. He couldn't see a way out if he answered them in any other way. All they would do was dig his hole deeper.
A few feet away, Greg and Mycroft were chatting quietly to one another, whatever Mycroft said made the younger man laugh.
When the detective looked at his Dom he was wincing as if he would be in trouble for getting it wrong, but John was frowning in confusion.
Before the detective could make a snarky comment, John shoved the gag back in his mouth. "Have fun. I'm going to check on Greg and your brother."
That was enough for the Dom and he immediately moved to untie the hook from his collar and release his feet. The boy was clever enough to leave his hands behind his head.
Grabbing the leash off the hook, he made the necessary attachments to the wall and then clipped it onto his collar.
"I'm going to try a lot of new things today. If it becomes too much, I want you to snap your fingers. And I mean it, Sherlock. Tell me if it gets to be too much."
"Ha! He's been begging for this, literally. You're the one who pointed it out." John thumped Sherlock alongside the head. "I daren't back down now."
"Do you not find it cute when they do that? Glare at you like they think it will make a difference… apart from making things worse."
Sherlock’s feet snapped apart with a surprising jerk, and he struggled to find his footing. John’s grip on his neck tightened before he could think of running. His wrists, however, stayed locked behind him.
Sherlock rested his head on Mycroft's shoulder. "Thank you, Myc. I'm sorry you're here, but I'm glad to have you with me."
A month later and not a lot had changed. Finn still slept between them, they’d tried several times to get him to sleep on his own but he was having none of it. It was inconvenient to certain bedroom activities and their routines had to be changed regarding said activities, but both Sherlock and John agreed that the young boy's peace of mind was worth it.
“Put some enthusiasm into this, Sherlock, or I’ll truss you up in front of a fucking machine and not let you come for hours.”
Greg followed him, stopping only long enough to pet Mycroft on the hair and order him to follow. When they got to the other room, John had already started selecting the rope he was going to use. He bound Sherlock's arms behind his back, joining his wrists to the collar, then he attached the winch to his wrists and began to pull him up. It left Sherlock somewhat upright, but bent over with his legs uncomfortably spread.
"Good boy." John took Sherlock by the arm and urged him to his feet, then he guided him from the bedroom.
"I know that, sir." Sherlock took a sip of his hot chocolate, his eyes closing as the flavour burst over his tongue.
“I’ve mentioned it before, Sherlock. The contract is 3 months, but subs aren’t always ready by then. As a professional Dom I have a responsibility for you. I can’t kick you out after 3 months and take on another sub until you are ready.”
The doctor chuckled. "It's a good job it's not cold, boy, that might have made you jump a little higher."
He sighed in relief when the phone was answered on the fourth ring. He waited out the deductions of the older man and then spoke himself. “Yes, Mycroft, he’s gone, I was with him and then looked up and he was gone. What is he? A child?”
"Hello dear," Eurus said, pacing the room and pecking Irene on the cheek. The Dominatrix made herself stay still for it. A fact Sherlock didn't miss. Only Eurus could mistake such a reaction for affection.
John was quiet while they ordered the ice creams and set off back down the beach with a special ice cream carrier for so many people. “This girl. How old is she?”
With obvious reluctance, Sherlock opened his mouth and let Irene thrust the dildo in as many times as she wanted.
With his Dom's permission, Sherlock came, he came so hard he fell onto the doctor on his way back down.
Sherlock's face looked resigned, but the two Doms didn't trust it. The brat had spent the majority of the day with that expression on his face, the rest of it he'd been pissing around.
John nodded. “We will do this a lot when I’m busy in here and you haven’t got anything to do. It’s a way to calm you down and keep you settled. You may also find subspace in the future just from this. And just because you didn’t get the paddle, it doesn’t mean aftercare can be avoided. Subs tend to ‘drop after punishment. They need to know they’re forgiven and so do you.”
Sherlock glanced down at his cock still trapped in its cage and then to the Dom who held the remote like it was the most powerful thing on Earth.
Sherlock was fairly well skilled in the art of fellatio and John didn't want to think about how that knowledge or expertise came about. The bondage and the blindfold clearly kept Sherlock calm enough to focus on what was happening, enough to maybe enjoy it himself... When he figured that out for himself that was. And he wasn't going to come until he had.
When Sherlock's sobs had died down he shifted his head slightly in John’s lap, a much hated past time several weeks ago.
Finn struggled until the detective set him on his feet. Then he sat down. After a moment, Sherlock and John sat down either side of him in the shallow water. The small waves rippled around them pleasantly.
"You've been good for me, Sherlock. Don't make it about being perfect. Just... Fuck. Just do your best and we'll be okay."
"No," he held a finger up to stop the boy from moving. "I need to check your leg properly. No more kneeling on it."
He tugged at his collar and pushed, playing with it under his fingers. Sherlock tensed and John heard a broken sob cut off at the bar of soap. He released the collar making sure it was still tight to Sherlock's neck.
Eurus smirked and ran her hand down her brother's chest. "Good boy, Mycie." She fetched her glass of wine and held it to his lips.
His sister crossed back to him, clearly unhappy. After staring at him for a moment, she turned on her heel. "Leave them. Maybe a bit of cold will get a better reaction from them both."
Mycroft nodded, blushing slightly. "Sherlock, I know I've apologised. But what I did was wrong. I'm not angry with Gregory for punishing me, do you understand that?"
“So you are going to be the good British citizen and offer some advice,” Sherlock assumed. It wasn’t a difficult conclusion to come to.
"It wasn't sugar cubes and caffeine tablets." John swatted him with the riding crop again. He couldn't believe Sherlock was still struggling. The pepper enema had to be driving him mad by now. He walked around and crouched in front of his boy. "If you want that plug out, you're going to have to do better than that."
John smacked the back of Sherlock's head as the detective made another move towards his zip. "Greg, you may have to find a place to pull over. If this one doesn't behave, I may need some gear from the boot."
Sherlock's hand paused at the head of his cock and ran his thumb over the head, pausing to dip the tip of it into his slit.
Positioning the machine just so, John pushed the dildo right up against his pet's entrance. He looked up so he could see Sherlock's face, then he flicked the machine on.
Sherlock was about to ask what he was supposed to be writing when he saw the top line had already been filled in.
“Time for some fun, shitbag, now you enjoy this fuck… it’ll be quick, but I'm due back at work in half an hour. Douglas can take over and we can have some real fun later.”
In unison, Sherlock and Finn stuck their tongues out at the Holmes brother. A chorus of ‘Sherlock’s bombarded the detective.
The government official nodded his head a few times, relishing in John's light touches. The doctor paused at Mycroft's hole, poking his finger inside. The sub squirmed as much as the rope would allow, wanting to push back on the finger, but not having any leverage.
"I'll plug him up with ginger," John decided. "Would you go get me a large piece?" he asked the Superintendent. "I don't want to take my eyes off of him, not even for a moment." Sherlock's glare increased thrice fold and it made the doctor laugh. "You are being a very very naughty bratty sub." He couldn't help it, the Dom leant forward and placed a kiss on Sherlock's forehead. The detective tried to jerk away, but John wouldn't let him. He growled through the gag and John laughed once again. "Mycroft, come here," John pointed at his feet.
Sherlock's eyes widened and he tried to thrash, then groaned as his arms were pulled slightly further up his back.
Knowing she had apparently done the right thing in Eurus' eyes, Irene snorted. "I don't care if they are too tight, if Eurus wants them that way, that's the way they will stay."
He shivered slightly and knew he needed to find a jacket of some sort without going home. Damn February weather. He closed his eyes momentarily before they snapped open again. He needed to change his clothes, but couldn't afford to just walk into a shop. He was sure he he'd been on the news... a charity shop though, a charity shop often had stuff left on the door during closed hours. Perfect.
Sherlock watched his brother for a long while. “I want it so loud mother hears it and gets to know what she is missing.”
When John was done he put the paddle down, Sherlock was whimpering softly and had been since the 15th blow, which was 25 theorhetically. The Dom had known how much the paddle hurt submissives, of course he did, he had just never done it without knowing the punishment would be over straight after. And the thought of that, hurt. A lot.
Greg grasped his sub by the scruff of the neck. "That's two slip ups, boy. I haven't given you permission to use my name."
The doctor clocked him on the back of the head. "No. Shut up. I don't know what has got into you but we are on holiday!"
“Oh, I am more than aware of that. But that is not the point and you know it!” he knew to stay with me. Have a car search for him, the longer he is out of my sight the deeper trouble he is in. He God damn knew not to run off!”
“Right now, you’re thinking I’m too clever?” John laughed, “or you’re too stupid that you didn’t realise before?”
Finn didn't know what to say. He looked up the beach towards where his grandad has settled next to Mrs Hudson. "Why?"
The sight of Sherlock had it's effect on the Dom. John was finding it difficult to keep things simple as he had sworn he would. His pet was so enticing.
“You escaping wasn't part of the plan, Sherly,” came a nearly familiar voice from behind him. It was Irish... it was familiar, from a few days before.
Back in the ordinary main room, Greg regarded the boys. "One drawback to having them cuffed is they can't unload the car." He sighed. "If you'll keep an eye on them, I'll do it."
Sherlock barked out a laugh. “Why? You’ll get bored of me in a few days and send me back to my brother. That’ll be just what I need after you for a few days.”
Greg gave a grunt of surprise. "I thought you weren't going to do that kind of thing with him for a while."
John stood for a moment more before realising that the cab, in London traffic, wouldn't have got far. He snatched up his laptop and began to type.
The sub flinched and went back to staring at the carpet beneath his feet, he hated the punishment side of the room, even the carpet was less friendly than the other side.
John had heard only the last part of what his sub had said, but he had a good idea what the rest might have been. He sighed. His boy’s logic was not wrong. Was it ever?
John squeezed his eyes shut but wasn't stupid enough to stop himself swallowing Sherlock properly as he came. Sherlock's hot come hit the back of his throat and John actually sighed at the familiar taste.
Sherlock turned his head, trying to pull his wrist free from the Dom again and not succeeding. All he did was manage to knock his Dom off balance momentarily.
It was a measure of how much things had changed between them that Mycroft didn’t snipe back. He patted Amy's ankle. "Just so. For a time, anyway."
“Well, your wrist needs a few days to recover and you are incredibly bruised all over. It is going to be a few days before we play again. You’ll spend those few days in bed-”
The doctor returned to the living room, his hand cradling the back of Finn's head. "We can go now. Everything's fine."
John couldn't believe a punishment for the brat was now based on something they had covered so many times before. They'd had this very conversation mere hours ago.
He leant back against the wall and closed his eyes, trying to work out where he was and where he could go. Going to John's wasn't an option, he still didn't know where he lived.
"Love the enthusiasm, boy," Greg laughed. He leant forward and shoved his fingers into Mycroft's waiting mouth.
Sherlock knelt in the middle of the playroom, his hands behind his head as he tried to keep his posture perfect and only watch the Dom when he was directly in front, not shift about to see him, which was harder than he thought.
“Pet, pet, Sherlock, hey,” he sat with the sub sideways on his lap. He felt guilty, Sherlock hadn't been in Panic for so long which was likely why it had hit him so suddenly.
“No!” He wouldn't listen to that crap on the best of days, he didn't have the time or patience for it today. “I've got no idea what's going on. Why have you arrested me?”
“Yes, sir,” he whispered, but his voice was muffled by the bed as he pressed his face into it, thinking it would help.
The government official cleared his threat. "Yes, sir. I always think about you, sir," he added in his own Dom's direction.
John sat back on the bed and shuffled up so he could see the whole room. His gaze dropped to his kneeling sub. He thought of tying the now-extended leash to the wall, but he always was a fan of the personal touch. He also liked the idea of being able to tug Sherlock over whenever he felt like it. It would no doubt teach the boy that submitting wasn’t a bad thing. If his Dom was happy the sub would be happy and if the sub was happy so was his Dom.
"It's a coffee, Irene. Do get over yourself." John glanced down at Kate, wondering how she stayed so... within the lines that seemed to be forever changing with Irene as a Domme.
"You aren't coming in this thing, boy," John shook his head. "I told you earlier if you want to come you'll do it untouched."
Seeing Sherlock's eyes roll, Irene gave his cock a twist, causing the chain to pull at the same time.
"Now!" She barked, slapping him and sending him sprawling. With his hands cuffed behind him, he had no way to protect himself.
Before he was fully under Sherlock began to fight again, shifting and bucking as much as the restraints would allow.
When the younger man realised that John was following he let his hand go and charged up to the cab. But he was too slow and it pulled away before he got a chance to talk to the passenger.
Sherlock sat on his by now normal chair. It had been a few days, but John still insisted on him using it. And he still tied him on it just as tightly. The dildo was no bigger than the first time he had sat on it, but it felt smaller to Sherlock, having got used to the feeling. The uncomfortably full feeling. It didn't help that his cock was still locked away, so he had that uncomfortably full feeling from both sides. John had only allowed his cock from the cage for a period of a minute while the Dom washed him and that was the most frustrating minute of his life.
"It's okay, pet." John smoothed down Sherlock's curls. "I didn't realise how much it meant to you and I certainly didn't mean to hurt you."
Sherlock felt awful just watching his brother and his Dom. This was his fault, he didn’t find himself heading back towards Panic. He found himself feeling nothing but shame.
“Why would I ask you what reward you want if I had no intention of giving it to you?” The Dom was confused, yet interested in how the sub had made that leap.
“You did. You could have behaved the first time and then you wouldn’t be stuck like that. That is what I said about submissives sometimes being the strongest. You going along and behaving makes me happy, in turn it’ll make you happy. Doing what you are told as a submissive makes you stronger than you think. There’s a lot of trust involved in relationships, boy, and therefore relationships are built on trust. From what you’ve already said so far you’ve had no reason to stick around, trust will change that. But it’s a two way thing. So what are you going to do the next time I order you to stay somewhere?”
Something inside him knew that was more to do with the fact he wanted to protect Sherlock than it had been to protect himself. When did Mycroft ever do anything to protect himself?
Mycroft popped off of his Dom's cock and looked over his shoulder at his brother in disbelief. Without ceremony, Greg grabbed him by the ears and turned him back around, guiding him back onto his cock.
John shut the detective up by wedging the end of a sausage into Sherlock's mouth. "Be quiet and eat that."
Apart from the little metal tubing being on the other side of the room, it appeared as if Sherlock had attempted to obey John’s demand, but got bored halfway through. From what his brother had said he wouldn’t put it passed him.
Without saying anything, John took his hand and squeezed it. He willed all of his love and support to travel through that connection and fortify his boyfriend.
“I know, sir. I’m Sorry, sir,” Sherlock repeated. “But it’s kind of shot up a lot in the last few hours.”
“I-” he did want a cup of tea. It sounded like a great idea and would more than likely bring him out of this floaty bubble, that felt similar and yet so far from subspace. But he was warm, and comfy.
Irene left the guard to his job. She decided Eurus could be the one to say when Mycroft had had enough. Making a show of it, she walked to the chest and rummaged around for quite some time in an effort to build up some suspense.
Sherlock froze where he was and watched the Dom in the doorway who stood with strong arms linked behind his back.
The two women must have been gone quite some time because Irene had not only painted Eurus' nails, she had fixed her hair and done her makeup as well. Their sister had even changed clothes. Eurus looked beautiful in the way a cobra was beautiful.
The detective shot his brother a look when the women weren't looking. In that brief moment of connection, he was able to reassure his brother that his subservience was for show.
His phone buzzed and he glanced at it with a heavy sigh. He left it buzzing to itself and held the mug up. “Can I get a refill?”
John smiled. The Superintendent had such a tender, loving look on his face. "You know, you're a real softie."
The detective’s head nodded minutely. He stood like that for a long while, holding him until he decided to remove the hood and the gag.
The detective had no idea why he thought they would head to the den next, he'd done nothing in the last 72 hours to even suggest time in the den was appropriate or something he had earned. He had been on his knees over an hour while John reorganised the whole attic. It was like the doctor was deliberately finding things to move. He soon realised they were heading to the Dom's office. At that, he sighed. How boring.
Sherlock was trying his hardest not to get annoyed with both Doms complete obliviousness. With a deep breath and pointedly not looking at the DI he turned back to the body, pointing. “Back of the right leg, tiny splash marks on the heel and calf, not present on the left. She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don’t get that splash pattern any other way. Smallish case, going by the spread. Case that size, woman this clothes conscious, it can only be an overnight bag.” He squatted down again and examined the back of the women’s legs again, trying to process any alternative, he couldn’t find one. Sure, he stood back up again. “Now, where is it? What have you done with it?”
He pointed to the men in the corner with one hand and patted his sub’s arse with the other. “Hop up, pet.”
Irene let her eyebrow raise briefly but as soon as Eurus turned around her face was a blank mask again. "Should we let him down?" She asked, ignoring the fighting Mycroft.
“How do you know he’ll let me?” Sherlock was hoping for something that this Dom knew that he didn’t.
John pretended he hadn't seen it but secretly he was extremely pleased, he had known from day one this sort of bondage had calmed him somewhat, those early days when he had left him cuffed to keep him still. He removed each of the buckles as quickly as he could, then he slid the armbinder down off his arms.
"My poor little big brother. Did that nasty woman hurt you?" She helped him sit, then examined every inch of him.
Sherlock focused his attention back onto his Dom’s cock. He didn’t want him putting the tally up anymore, not with that new paddle he had been introduced to a few days before.
There he was, his sub, his brat. The trouble was. There was a 20 foot gap between the window they were looking through and the window Sherlock was the other side of.
Mycroft's body clock was all out of sync by the time his sister and Irene reappeared. Way out of sync.
"John, I suggest we find our seats." Greg opened the door to the courtroom and held it for the others to enter.
When they reached the top of the stairs, John settled them on the sofa, but Sherlock shifted around, falling to the floor on his knees beside the Dom. Of his own choice, that was either completely new or not good…
“I could have put you under in the den, but that won't happen now. It'll have to be the playroom, I can't trust you not to need punishment.”
“I do believe I told you to do the washing up,” the Dom said, answering the unasked question as if he knew what his sub was thinking, but he didn’t elaborate.
The Superintendent saw the smirk on his boy's face around the gag and he gripped his hair tighter than before. "Get back in the corner," Greg repeated, releasing him once again.
After a further half an hour of searching, he checked the window one last time, to put his nerves at ease, if only slightly and then rang Mycroft. He picked up on the second ring.
"You'll do what I say, when I say. You won't hesitate or deviate. You will be respectful to your brother and address me and Greg as sir at all times, Sherlock. At all times."
Greg gasped and fisted his hands where they lay between himself and John. He couldn't decide how he felt about the fleshlight at this point. It wasn't as good as the real thing, but he needed it if it was all he was going to be allowed.
Irene had stepped back to the side of the room with Eurus once again. She had a full glass of wine in her hand.
"Not much. Trauma was interesting. But I was a GP before I started doing this full time." He reached out and ran his hand through his kneeling sub's curls. "Somewhat less drama at a local surgery. Much more boring." John sipped his coffee while watching his boy. He was knelt as perfect as he'd ever seen him.
Back to being stubborn again, Sherlock folded his arms once more. “For all you know I might not really need to go.”
It was less than 10 minutes before Greg arrived, flashing blue lights on his unmarked. The area car pulled up behind the DI and set about taking over the citizen's arrest John was carrying out.
Sighing, Mycroft stepped forward and helped him take them off, swapping them over without his bad foot ever touching the floor.
John held his hand out as a reward and his sub gladly took it, willing to accept any comfort the Dom was willing to give out.
The non sequitur caused Sherlock to look at the doctor oddly. “Okay. Are you feeling quite alright, John?”
“So what do you do at these crime scenes, then?” John tried to turn the conversation around slightly rather than reprimand him.
"Interesting." Sherlock approached the apparition eagerly. "Don't be ridiculous, Hudders, that's an it not a he, as I have already tried explaining to John."
Eurus sat down gracefully on the floor, then looked up expectantly at Irene. The Dominatrix took the hint and sat down next to her.
John winked as he got to his feet. He paced to the corner and gripped his kneeling sub by the curls, yanking his head back.
Almost immediately, John had Sherlock’s arm locked up his back again and shoved him into the wall. “Your behaviour is unacceptable. I will punish you how I see fit. You DO NOT get a say in it.”
"I'm hardly old enough to be your daddy, Lestrade." The detective got a three and moved his counter, huffing at falling behind already.
Mycroft grabbed his brother's arm, unsure what he was meant to be doing to help. All he knew was that every move he made hurt like hell.
“So I suppose we’d better start again, if you can’t remember the number?” John offered, he wanted to know what Sherlock's reaction would be.
He glanced at his fellow officer. “That is a shame. I apologise for my officer’s attitude. Go and wait in the car,” he added to his sergeant.
Greg and Mycroft got in the front seats, the DI sliding behind the wheel. Mr. Holmes and Mrs. Hudson got in the black sedan that was parked behind them.
The detective's eyebrows drew down as he tried to imagine it. "I'm not good at empathy, John, you know that. Would you... explain it to me?"
John hugged him. "Absolutely not. You have reason to celebrate. You stood up for yourself against a woman who hurt you and now she's going to pay the price for what she's done. I'm proud of you. We all are."
When John returned, he held the spreader bar, the same spreader bar he had used that first time. He strapped the cuffs around his thighs and placed the bar between them, pushing his knees apart. He was pleasantly surprised to see that the sub had recognised the term of address and his hands were behind his head rather than behind his back.
Sherlock covered his ears in dramatic wilful ignorance whilst John pretended he had gone temporarily deaf.
Sherlock closed his eyes. “I’m sorry, sir,” he whispered. He didn’t know how he could go back to ‘that’ person when ‘that’ Sherlock upset John so much.
They cuddled for about an hour, John continually rubbing the spot that made shivers flitter through Sherlock. The detective continued to make the noise that sounded like he was purring. John didn’t comment, just made sure he kept dragging the noise out of him and smiled at the top of his sub’s head.
After feeding Sherlock every mouthful of his breakfast (he wouldn't have had to eat it all if he had done it himself) John got to his feet and stretched. He double checked his phone and then moved to untie the detective from the chair.
The sub rolled his eyes and looked down at his cock. Who wouldn't be in a difficult mood when put in such a situation.
Sherlock pushed himself to his knees and the Superintendent grabbed his wrists, cuffing them behind him.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, but headed to the bedroom to get dressed. He didn't want everyone making a fuss over him. Things were bad enough already.
Their sister looked in the direction Mycroft had been taken for several long seconds before she turned back to Sherlock. "You know the routine. Strip, then get back on your knees."
“Whatever I say, you’ll hide and not allow me to have it, sir. You choose.” Then at least I can't blame myself.
Greg laughed. "Alright, but I won't go easy on you just because you asked for it. I'm going to make it hurt."
There was enough aggression in those two words that the sergeant just nodded her head once and lifted her radio up. “Freak’s here, bringing him in.”
John snatched up the cock cage next, the sound already part of it. There was a long silver chain that ran from the tip of the sound, Sherlock was trying to figure out what it was all about before he found out the hard way.
The thought that his brother might have seen this before him was infuriating. He was preparing what he would say to his brother the next time he saw him when he suddenly knew Mycroft had never been here. He didn't know how he knew, but he did. It was like the knowledge had simply appeared in his mind.
The detective glanced over his shoulder, still smirking, he winked at his Dom. “Well, so is Sergeant Donovan.”
Sherlock felt himself getting jealous, so he directed his gaze out to sea. The last thing he needed was to be caught glaring at his brother and Greg.
Mycroft had clearly missed the entire conversation and Greg sighed. He used the government official’s loosened tie and pulled him to his knees, then he took the seat Mycroft had been forced to vacate. He brought the kneeling sub’s head to his thigh and gently ran his hand through his thinning hair.
John didn’t bother trying to get Finn's input on bathing suits. He found a light blue one with dinosaurs on it and knew that it was the one. He also found a matching towel and got it.
“Yeah. It does that too. Since Sherlock experimented with ice, door keys and the waffle machine. You’d think since waffles are the only thing he will eat without complaining that he would leave the thing alone that makes them.”
Several minutes later, they heard the buzz from downstairs. It was immediately followed by Finn yelling joyfully and running for the front door.
"That's none of your concern," Greg replied, knowing that his pet would be able to deduce how John and Sherlock were getting along regardless of what he said. "You should be more worried with how you spoke to me earlier."
With that, Sherlock’s hands moved from behind his head to behind his back, for some reason it always felt like he was being watched more when he was in the ‘easier’ position. The Dom crossed the room in a few paces and ran his hand through his kneeling sub’s untamely curls.
His glance at Mycroft still hanging from the ceiling renewed his efforts to be good. If they were perfect, Eurus' temper would be aimed at Irene.
John was incredibly relieved that the detective was trusting him again, or at least willing to accept comfort. He had stated from day one that comfort would always come after punishment. Always. That however, left his curiosity unsatisfied. After what had happened with Wilkes he was determined to find out as much as he could about Sherlock’s past in order to prevent the past repeating itself, even if it meant dragging it out of him. He would not be responsible for any more harm coming to his sub in a way that was uncalled for, physically or emotionally. He knew he had to ask questions, some were going to be difficult and some the sub would not want to answer, that didn’t mean he could get away with not answering though.
John watched the internal war occuring and smiled, it was good to see him fighting basic instincts. He took hold of Sherlock's cock and ran his hand up and down, using the quickly forming precum as lube.
"Pet, look at me," he ordered, trying to find a comfortable position to be able to look down at the boy but not seem intimidating at the same time. He doubted Sherlock would be intimidated by him ever again, but Panic was a funny thing, it crept up out of nowhere and often hit hard and fast, he didn't want to inadvertantly trigger his pet into a Panic session when there was so much more useful things they could be doing with their time.
Getting blasted with cold air, the detective turned back to face the console. There was a large black round thing opening up. Floating metal things, flying out. "What the hell?"
"Oh, Sherlock, you don't sound happy to see me." The dominatrix got up and came around the desk, stopping in front of him. She ran a finger along his jawline. "I'm disappointed."
Fetching a ball stretcher, the Dominatrix approached Sherlock again. She turned and held the device up for Mycroft to see. "I can keep adding weights to this until he's begging me to stop, then I can add more."
Slowly, ever so slowly, Moriarty reached out with one hand, pointing the gun at he kneeling sub. With the other he flicked the camera on, activating the live feed.
“You don’t have to,” John said, suddenly unsure. “I just thought… you can stay in the lab if you want. It’s yours. I just want to make sure you’re eating enough and you’re in bed at night.”
Sherlock had the sense to look ashamed, something else Mycroft found rather confusing as well as amusing. As he reached the doctor, he handed him his walking stick, then settled himself just in front of him on his knees.
John could see clearly that the boy was just going to argue with him at every opportunity. He was fine with that. He knew yesterday had been too good to be true and he knew this sub was going to be difficult. It was what Mycroft had warned him about after all. At this point in time, he didn’t really care why the brat had attempted to escape again. He had assumed they had formed a connection yesterday and he was positive that was genuine and not some performance. Nobody could ‘pretend’ to be that scared when he went into Panic.
He dived behind the boxes, tucking his knees up to his chest and making himself as small as possible. They passed him, unaware of his presence and he sighed in relief. He watched as all the soldiers dispersed in different directions and then crawled back to the door. He froze as he saw a bunch of men trying to shift the blue box on to a pallet. He managed to sneak into the room and hide, watching for nearly an hour until the pallet was raised up and taken from the room. He'd passed the point of following the Doctor, he chose to follow the box.
“Wow, someone’s been trying to tame you,” Benjamin filled in the gaps with a hearty laugh. “A quick fuck is all you are worth, even you know that, isn’t that right, freak?”
The doctor embraced his husband and kissed him. “Good. I think that’s good. Talking, I mean.” He released Sherlock. “We can talk about it tonight unless he's too tired.”
He started to take a bite out of one, but John slapped it out of his hand. "Greg! What are you about, telling him that?! You know how he is!"
“You don’t want it to be so. Neither do I. But he ran for a reason and beyond having had enough at mine, I don’t know another reason.”
"Until I've decided you won't lie to me anymore and that the sentence there has drilled it into your head that your health and wellbeing is my number one concern."
John's back had begun playing up by leaning over to tap on the plug. So instead he'd grabbed a crop and began patting the plug with that instead of his finger.
Mrs. Hudson reached over and rubbed the only part of Finn's back that was exposed. He was such a dear child.
John took the few steps up behind him, his breath hot on the back of his neck. He tensed, not daring to even think about turning around.
John swore under his breath. Being involved with someone as literal and logical as Sherlock could be trying at times. Hell, it was exhausting.
It was so endearing that John stopped what he was doing, wrapped his arms around him and simply held him.
"I'm going to touch you in a minute. I will stroke you for 30 seconds. If you can control yourself I will let you have a proper orgasm at the end of it. If you can't, I'll change the dildo to the fucking machine and milk you dry. Say yes master."
John glanced down to the pair of pants he was holding in his hand. He had collected them from the bedroom floor after last night. “These aren’t for you, the washing hamper is in here.” He dropped them in it.
“You stay there and drink the rest of your tea, I’ll go and get the case notes, ok?” The Dom could read his boy like a book.
The sub dropped back to his knees and crawled slightly behind his Dom as John walked through to the dining room.
John groaned, dumped his beer on the unit and rolled to his feet. He walked the few paces to his sub and toed his cock. "What was that, boy?"
“I thought bringing them in would clear your name. They were covered in the blood of the guy in that jewellery store.”
John was glad that the sub at least seemed to think on it before he nodded. Then, at the sound of the door, John handed Sherlock the crutches. "Come on, pet."
The sub froze. The paddle was something he would definitely prefer to avoid. "Only if you want me to want it, sir."
Sherlock tried, he really did try to get his leg to cooperate, but as he tried to stand it gave way completely.
“He’d wet himself.” Mycroft didn’t sound spiteful, more apologetic. “He got punished for that and only after that did the bastard let him out once daily for the toilet.”
“Good. She does what I do. Obviously I do not see her as competition given her gender. We met on a dominance course a while ago and have kept in touch. She's far sterner than I am, so I warn you, behave. She won't hesitate to punish her own sub if she brings her along and I won't hesitate to punish you. Is that a problem?”
Without being asked, Mycroft assisted John in getting the cuffs on Sherlock. As soon as they had been closed around his wrists, the three men stepped back from him to see if he would calm down. The look on his face, clearly said otherwise.
The detective could sense the awkwardness and wanted to end the conversation as quickly as possible. “Welcome to London.”
"Well my boy clearly wants something harder in his hole than my fingers. But he certainly doesn't deserve my cock." John removed his fingers altogether. "I don't imagine you have anything I could use that fits with the jungle theme?" he asked the Superintendent.
Finn giggled. He agreed with Amy. Sorting the legos was silly. She smiled at him and they giggled together. Then before anyone could stop him he reached out and pushed all the piles away, knocking the stacks over into a heap.
Sherlock froze. “It’s only a legal thing, Finn. You’re our son now just as much as you will be once we’ve signed the adoption papers.”
John laughed, “I’ve been a doctor for many years, boy. By your expression when I first came in and the way you are holding yourself now. You are desperate. So I think if you don’t want to humiliate yourself even more than you already are by acting like a child, you should swallow your pride and obey me.”
“I know you are, boy, but that doesn't change what you did or why you did it. So close to the time before as well.”
The DI pulled out his own cuffs and placed them in John's hand as the doctor moved forward to hold Douglas, not that he was struggling much anyway.
He glanced at his brother and saw Sherlock was just resigned to the whole thing. That wasn't he way this was supposed to go, they were meant to fight back. They were meant to be strong.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock agreed. To be honest, he would have agreed to anything if it meant his Dom no longer being angry with him.
John examined his arse closely, touching the edges of the strap marks that laid across his sit spot. "Have you got something to say to me?" John asked when he was content there was no lasting damage and he hadn't broken the skin.
The pair of them bumped shoulders and walked out into the water where they paddled around together for a bit undisturbed. Every now and then, one of them would spot a shell and pick it up thinking either Finn or one of the girls would like it. Amy had mentioned wanting to make a necklace out of shells earlier.
The older man pointed at him, anger clear in the gesture as well as the look on his face. “Now look, whatever you’re trying to imply…” he trailed off and Sherlock grinned.
Irene followed the detective's gaze. Seeing what was happening, she tutted. "No, no, no. That will never do." The Dominatrix crossed over and placed a hand on the guard's arm. "Your stance is all wrong and the way you swing the crop-" She shook her head. "Let me give you some pointers."
"I'm sorry, sir." Another tear leaked from his eye, but he still didn't snap his fingers. "You should do whatever you see fit, sir."
Sherlock wandered into the living room next, his blue dressing gown hanging off his shoulder. "You need your own photo album or you'll wear that one out," he said as he dropped into his chair.
John smiled at him and ruffled his curls. It was the first time there hadn’t been a look of upmost hatred in his eyes as the form of comfort happened.
As he delved through his Mind Palace, he could see how the cases had escalated and the pattern developed. He had soon come to the same conclusion that Mycroft clearly had to put him in such a state.
"I don't want them on the benches. Sherlock is already hurt enough at your hands. They will be punished, but not in that way."
Sherlock got to his feet, dislodging the hand that John had on his knee. “It’s a case? You’ve brought me a case?”
They would need to stop at the shop for some toys for the boy. Couldn’t have him on the beach without swim trunks or buckets.
John took several deep breaths, absolutely positive the woman had divulged information she wasn't meant to.
Sherlock doubted he would fall asleep but he leant against the Dom's leg, revelling in the comforting presence that he probably didn't deserve.
“Sherlock… What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out. Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Please come?” John spoke it out loud as he read it, becoming more confused as he went.
Maybe they had turned the corner, in more than just the discipline sense. Sherlock had never shown much interest in the sexual side of the submissive/dominant relationship. The thing was, it was one of the primary functions of said relationship, yes, there was the discipline, the respect, the caring, but play... Playing was huge.
The doctor stared at it for a moment and then looked over his shoulder at Sherlock before he burst out laughing.
Greg had walked off several feet because he had lost it completely. He bent over double laughing. God, Sherlock was a handful. Thank God he belonged to John.
The government official was actually in a t-shirt and a pair of shorts that Sherlock was fairly sure had been robbed from Greg.
Both Doms stepped back to watch as Sherlock shifted and moved, making a point of suckling on the fake cock in his mouth.
But no telling off came nor did the strap. Instead John sat back beside him. He placed two tablets into one hand and a glass of water into the other.
This chapter is unbetad and I only read through it once as I wanted to get it out there so please ignore mistakes, they're all mine!
“But, sir!” Sherlock complained, trying to force his cock through John's hand that had stopped stroking.
"Mm hm." The doctor kept working quietly, finally tying off the rope, then he got a new length and began tying oneif his boy's legs to the bench. When he started on the second, he spread his boy's arse wide. He reached between his legs and pulled his caged cock down to hang over the edge, tgen he ran a length of rope through the tip and attached it to a hook on the bench. "There. Much better." John circled around in front of his boy, the gag back in hand. He waved it in front of Sherlock's face. "Open up."
In relief, what was left of the soap just fell out of his mouth, but the taste was still there. It was still there and it was awful.
“What?” Greg asked, his tone sharp, he was still unimpressed with his sub’s performance earlier in the day, despite now running his own fingers through his hair.
Irene felt paralysed. She had been domming them when Eurus had gone mad and told her to stop. She decided she'd have to be careful. "Place your foreheads on the floor."
Then, after a moment or two, John was clearly setting up the ropes for the suspension. He held Sherlock’s hooded head in his hand for a moment before winching him up. He thrashed only momentarily until he realised he was in the air... flying.
At that, John had expected his sub to move, to mimic Mycroft and drop position. But he didn't. He stayed perfectly straight. The Dom couldn't help another small smile. He let Sherlock stay in position a bit longer as he played with his curls, wrapping one around his finger.
This time, Sherlock didn’t respond, and he didn’t fight when John forced him to his knees, finally releasing his arm as he attached the leash to the wall.
"I said, be quiet." He set him on his feet when they were outside and dragged him towards the ice cream parlour.
Sherlock glanced between Irene and his brother. He didn't know who had it better. Eurus and Irene were difficult to choose from.
"Well you had to be at some point. You've got one Holmes hanging from the ceiling and the other knelt at your feet."
“However if you orgasm without permission, pet, you will be punished as I see fit. The tally will not come into it. I am warning you now, if you think the punishments you have recently experienced are bad, they will be nothing in comparison. I use the method of punishment that other Dom’s do when this rule is broken and if you haven’t experienced it you will know of it, am I right?”
"Hmm. I hadn't thought of that, but I think you're right." John tied the rope that dangled from Sherlock's cock to the weight on the floor.
He shoved his sub to the floor by the door, his hand pushed into the handle of the leash. He began tapping at the code for the alarm. Sherlock huffed as his wrists got closer together, his contract cuffs joining to one another behind him.
The doctor eased the nozzle into his sub's hole, working it in until it was at just the right depth, then he removed the clamp, letting the fluid flow into him.
John put his hand under the detective's arm pit and pulled him to his feet. Sherlock ignored the pain in his leg and held onto the table when his leg gave out, but John had already turned to pay and when he looked up Irene was watching him, am eyebrow raised.
Sherlock jolted and sprung back from the Dom as the door slammed open and 5 people charged in. The only thing John paid attention to, though, was the detective as he gagged when his collar snagged on the leash that still tethered him to the ground. John felt another rush of guilt flood over him. He had basically tied him up and handed him over. He moved quickly to release the leash to at least attempt to prevent further injury and the boy shuffled into the corner backwards as fast as he could.
"Hmm… maybe after a difficult day at work. Or a bad case." He sat up straight and extricated his feet from Mycroft's grasp. "That's enough, boy. Go sit by Greg." He thought Sherlock had behaved quite well, so he decided to give him a small treat. "Sherlock, come lay your head in my lap."
The government official let his head fall forward and hit the corner with a thud. He felt like his cock might explode just from being teased.
Mycroft stretched his neck and looked in the car door. When he saw his brother's predicament, he had to turn away to keep from laughing. He knew that would be highly inappropriate. "Causing trouble, is he, sir?"
The DI’s mouth opened a few times and then closed. “Er, no thanks it’s just a quick one. How are you doing, now?”
Sherlock’s eyes flickered up to meet his Dom’s. “It’s me, pet. Not that dick from Uni. I’m not going to do anything we haven’t previously agreed to and I certainly won’t do anything further if you safe word.”
“Good point,” John tilted his head on one side regarding the older Holmes for a moment before turning his attention back to his own. “I’ll have tea. Do not make yourself one and do not poison your brother’s. Go.”
Sherlock looked away, towards his brother. The youngest Holmes reached up and gripped Sherlock's curls in her hand.
Thank you for all the comments over the last couple of weeks, they have meant a lot, I thought about replying to them all separately but there's well over 100 so once again, here we are!
When the car pulled up, John grabbed his sub by the scuff of the neck and dragged him bodily from the vehicle.
"Do what you did before," Eurus demanded. "Make Mycie act out." She shoved Irene between herself and her brother.
The sub gave a heavy sigh, then knee walked to the corner John had indicated. He faced the corner and tried to settle in for the wait.
The boy’s head snapped up, clearly wanting to argue. When nothing came out of his mouth, the Dom smiled.
Happy both of their boys were cuffed, they dragged them through to the next room, this one was beach themed and on the other side of the room the glass doors opened out on to the real beach.
He wouldn’t have been able to hear them, they were talking in hushed voices by the door to a busy and loud corridor, even Sherlock’s super hearing wouldn’t have been able to hear that.
John's hand was at the back of his neck, the pad of his thumb rubbing softly. He hadn't felt a touch like that in days. It was a relief. He hadn't realised a few weeks ago how punishment could be not physical and still be successful in curving his behaviour back towards the outlined agreement in the contract.
"Ow- sir," the sub said, a pout clear in his voice. He'd only been worried about his brother and John.
The three of them came up with a plan and began their search immediately. Greg had even drawn in a few handfuls of officers to travel out to John’s for the search.
The detective stumbled for some resemblance of control. He’d just have to behave really, really well and then John wouldn’t want to get rid of him and he could stay here. He was finally ready to admit that he wanted to be here and he had thought John wanted him too.
“I do get to tie you up when I feel like it, I’m your Dom. But none of this is without your consent, you know that so there is no reason why you can play that card with me.”
Sherlock took the doctor by the hand and pulled him towards the building. “I’m sure Sally came around for a nice little chat and just happened to stay over…” he glanced at his Dom who was trying to hide the smile on his face. “And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.”
That was complicated. John hesitated to go into detail, but Sherlock was his usual blunt self. “Her parents were being mean. And no one wants to take her, but we can. We can give her a good home.”
The doctor ignored the shower that morning and instead got back into a suit again, he had been beginning to relax around the sub, having no need to put up a front.
The Superintendent led John through to where their main room was to dump their bags. They took a while so when they came out were surprised to see Sherlock trying to get some friction to his cock through the cage bars.
"You're sister is fucking insane," the Dominatrix hissed quietly. In a louder tone of voice, she ordered, "Crawl around the room, junior."
“Why didn’t you tell my men, Sherlock?” Greg asked. “They could have dealt with it and you wouldn’t have gotten into trouble.”
"He wants it rough. You can't get much rougher than what he got this morning." Greg's face lit up. "You could always use a cane on him."
John spun him over and smacked his palm down on his arse before Sherlock had a chance to get comfortable. "You will not like the next few days. You will not enjoy them. But you will bloody well learn to not disrespect me, your brother, Greg or yourself. Now count, with respect."
A quick glance over his shoulder and he was out. Well, he wouldn’t go as far as to say out. As soon as he was over the threshold of the Dom”s front door, there was a noise that sounded like an alarm blaring and a jolt that ran up his ankles. His feet had snapped together and joined at the cuffs and some invisible force more powerful than gravity held him in that exact spot. His wrists were tugged behind him and joined together, his rucksack dropped and forgotten. He yelled loudly, the Dom had got the better of him. Again!
The blond Dom closed the door behind them and Sherlock immediately dropped to his knees. “Sir, I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. I didn’t-”
Siger mock winced. "You just had to say it." He broke into a smile. "I actually like the sound of it."
The corner of Greg's mouth twitched up, but he managed not to laugh out loud. "You cheeky bastard." He slipped his thumb into his boy's mouth and Mycroft immediately started sucking. "I didn't tell you to suck," Greg growled.
Sherlock knelt upright, he had to be in his 'pet' position because of the way his hands were tied but John didn't seem bothered.
"Sorry, Eurus," his fingers moved twice as fast on his buttons. As he undressed, he let his clothes fall to the floor. When he had finished, he immediately dropped to his knees as ordered.
Sherlock shrugged as he took a seat, he didn’t see why not, but he wasn’t about to say that out loud.
"Of course, you'll learn more when we are alone. My brothers only have a few hours left with us, then the fun can begin. For now, get on your knees, Mycie."
“No. Subs have just as many human rights as Doms do. Just because this guy was a dick, it doesn’t mean you’re below anyone. And aftercare comes after all manner of scenes and sessions not just punishment.”
Mycroft's move had put him just the other side of the ladder, meaning he'd missed the ladder to row 6.
It was one thing to be tied up like this. It was another to be completely ignored in the process. He dropped his head.
Sometimes having a sub, whilst being a professional Dom was very difficult. It was like hearing a toddler swearing and having to tell them off while trying not to laugh.
Mycroft ducked his head and Greg yanked it back up again. He kissed him roughly, taking his lip between his teeth.
After several long moments, the Superintendent pulled back and looked his friend in the eyes. "Let's go find your Dom, alright?" he asked. At Sherlock’s nod, they started walking towards the other two men in the distance.
John glanced at Sherlock immediately concerned. Sherlock got to his feet to pick up the boy, but he moved away from the detective, wanting John instead.
“If you feel like you are about to be pushed over the edge, you resist and ask permission. If I say no, you continue to resist. Is that understood?”
Sherlock’s mouth was wrapped around the usual ball gag, if it wasn’t there, he’d be panting like mad. Instead he stared at the floor as if that would help matters.
Before Sherlock could respond, a familiar couple stepped in front of them. Despite the short stature of the Domme in front of them, her presence loomed.
"Yeah, Finn," Beth said. "We'd like to help." She was sorting the blocks by colour whilst her sister rolled her eyes.
“Good boy,” John praised, running his hand through his curls. “Well done for not just going up there. An oversight on my part, I apologise.”
Yet again, the previous night Sherlock had laid awake, staring at the ceiling when something dawned on him. He had escaped John's house. Unless he found out that Mycroft had designed the security on the doors and windows in the Yard as well as his Dom's, getting out wouldn't be a problem. That place was a fortress compared to this station.
Mycroft regretted his stupidity all the time after falling for Moriarty's games and putting his brother in such terrible positions.
The detective walked over to the man lying down on the floor, he was barely moving but alive. “Was I right? I was, wasn’t I? Did I get it right?”
“You, with the gun, take three steps to the right.” The man directly behind the kneeling Dom moved as specified once again and Benjamin could see him out of the corner of his eye.
John wasn't tempted to scream even though the thing was definitely creepy. "Why don't you come away from the door," he said uneasily.
"I know. He's such a brat. It's a shame he is so gorgeous and intelligent, or I would leave him here permanently."
John scooped Sherlock up in his arms. "You need a shower, pet. Desperately. We'll get one together."
“Yes, sir,” he whispered as a response. His own mind was drifting off to the events of the day in order, and then got stuck on that plug in his arse and the… thing inside his cock.
The doctor laughed, then realised Mycroft was being perfectly serious. "That's a little inhumane, don't you think?"
“Thank you, sir.” There has been no need for the Dom to do that  he had every right to fetch a glass of water and pour it on the floor in front of him, making him watch.
The detective glanced at John again as if for confirmation before opening the door and stepping inside. He paused almost immediately, wanting to back out but knowing John blocked the door.
"Yes, sir." Sherlock managed not to growl, but just barely. He was pulled to his feet and uncuffed, then he was cuffed with his hands in front of him. The guards lifted him up and hooked the cuffs over a hook in the ceiling, then stepped back.
When Greg came across the next roundabout, he went around it a total of 7 times, causing John to laugh. "Oh, come on, they'd be able to work out what exit we took and know where we're going. Prudence and all that."
John pulled a new stool out from a side cupboard. It was a lot lower than the first one John had tied him to.
Greg returned shortly from their bedroom where their stuff had been dumped and returned with a different gag than before. This one was dildo shaped and rather largish. John accepted it gratefully. "Ta." He moved to put it in Sherlock's mouth, but the detective twisted away. "Boy, do you really want a cropping this early in the game?" Sherlock didn't duck away the second time, but he didn't open his mouth. "My boy is most definitely in brat mode. It's clearly his favourite mood today. But I don't fancy using the crop. Greg, any suggestions?"
He stared at the floor, trying to work out what the hell was going on as well as what his next part of the plan was. His life had been going relatively well, for him at least. He had found a Dom that understood him. Yes, John could be an annoying prat sometimes, but there was no doubt the older man cared for him. It didn't matter it was a training contract, it was good enough for now. But these shoes were found by John? The evidence that was enough to have him charged by the police. That made no sense. He really hoped it hadn't been on purpose. Part of him expected it was... or maybe it was Mycroft's plan. He hadn't seen him since he'd bailed the station in a hurry. Everything always seemed to go wrong when everything was going right.
“I don’t want to focus on my breathing,” Sherlock grumbled trying to pull his hands out of John’s grip, but the Dom stopped him.
“I've had specific instructions from Sherlock's Dominant to keep you away. I have to respect that until he is charged with anything. Out.”
The detective thought long and hard for several minutes. "I want the wedding. I want it for Father, for Mrs. Hudson, for Finn, but I want it for us. I don't want to look back and regret not doing it."
Mycroft just let his eyebrow raise. "You haven't just shown your brother mercy, why would you show it to some random woman?"
John glanced down at his kneeling sub and smirked. “He hasn’t said a word since we got here. And we got here a while ago.”
That made the doctor look around in search of it, he shook his head in confusion about to ask his boy as well but he was off again.
“Fine,” John sighed, keeping his tiredness out of his voice. It had been difficult keeping Sherlock under tight control, he was still sleeping with him, but was cuffed and tied to the headboard every night. Something he hated, but hadn't yet commented on.
Sherlock had the sense to look slightly ashamed and John watched the blush creep up his neck behind the collar.
Irene stepped forward and took her hand. She had long since learnt whatever Eurus wanted, she got it.
“Don't tell me to calm down! You've got my submissive in a cell!” He had a right to be mad, he'd kept his head straight while seeing Sherlock, he had to, but now it was getting on top of him and judging by the rumble the filing cabinet had caused echoing through the air it was obvious.
Mycroft heaved his brother to his feet, spinning him around and twisting his arm up his back. "I'm not about to disappoint Gregory and John." He started marching him towards the chip shop.
Placing each item in the correct drawers with precision, his gaze skittered around his room using the reflection of the mirror to watch for movement. He didn’t know Sherlock was still in here. He knew he had been, but whether he still was or not wasn’t an answer he could currently give. If he was still in here, the only place he could hide would be…
He picked up a Wartenberg pinwheel and kept looking. Moving a crop aside, his fingers brushed a flogger. Greg grinned, dropped the pinwheel and picked up two floggers, one for himself and one for John.
John shook his head. “Stop being so dramatic. Mycroft will start getting controlling if you block him out completely.”
“Sir? You said I’m fine now. We don’t need to use the bed anymore.” It was where he’d been punished in the evening. John had made him comfy and used his hand. He also hadn’t done it for the first few days after he’d been hurt.
Quietly seething, Sherlock complied. John didn’t open his mouth once, and each time it got to putting away each dish he just pointed mutely at whichever cupboard it belonged in. It wasn’t long before Sherlock was pissed off with the way he was being treated, but when he went to open his mouth and his Dom caught his eye, he froze. This was his own fault. He should have known by now that this Dom would find a more inventive way to punish him than just the paddle this time round. At least this would be over soon and painless. Sherlock couldn’t recall if he had ever been punished painlessly before, but he knew if he had it was rare and a very long time ago. He had probably still been a child.
Together, they entered the building and made their way towards the courtroom. They stopped just outside.
