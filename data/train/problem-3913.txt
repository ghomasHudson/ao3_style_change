Castiel kept his gaze on this Dean he was close to him at the moment, looking at his features it felt odd. The man’s face was softer, he looked better, the wounds as if they were never really there. This Dean's skin looks healthier than his own dean which looks tired. Cas wants to use his grace to make it better, whenever he has the chance to heal Dean, his dean, He always ends up healing the tiniest of wounds. As for what this Dean now whispered brought what the Angel assumed to reality the richer Dean loved that other Cas. He heard the soft whisper and knew right away, he could ask without any fear. His lips creased into a gentle empathetic smile and tilted his head a bit to look at the man's face a bit better “This other me, your Cas, what happened to him?” He asked; afraid of the outcome, typically his Dean would get angry by such a question. The Angel hesitated for a while, but this is not Dean, well..his Dean
Dean looked over at Jack, he didn't expect the kid to join him at the table. Quite honestly it's the opposite of what you'd want to do. Sit here and ponder about how to defeat someone who can control all of space and time. Dean was in the middle of typing on his keyboard when Jack asked that simple question “I don't exactly know, I don't want any of us to take it but it doesn't look like we really have a choice do we?” Dean stopped typing and glanced up at Jack “The last time I remember, Amara and I had this weird- uh attraction to one another I didn't exactly understand it at the time but it was hard to resist her. Sammy was supposed to take the mark from Amara but that didn't work out in the end.” Dean placed his elbows onto the table, he seemed affixed on trying to find different ways out of this but he doesn't even know what he's suggesting at this point, god has played them more than he can count, He doesn't exactly understand what is happening at this point but this needs to be done.
Jack listened to his father that initially had a planned out map with Billie, do her trials, get stronger and then combust into celestial mist destruction, basically a god bomb. This would include Amara in the whole plan, but after he spoke with his family, the plan to lock him down might actually be the only way to do this.
Dean listened to the angel's whole speech. He doesn't understand why Cas was now to tell him this, out of all the times he's heard every single word Cas said. He gulped deeply while the angel continued he doesn't want this to go like this. He’s heard stuff like this before and he knows this is a goodbye of the sort... in many cases, he had no idea what to think at this point. The Hunter didn't want to hear this now, not now and not yet. Dean's eyes were got glassier and glassier by the minute he tried to hold back his own tears he saw Castiel cry for the first time...real tears with how happy he was, and how big he smiled is going to haunt Dean for the rest of his life.  He knew where this was going and he couldn't stop it. This made Dean feel even more useless when it comes to these problems, it's how vulnerable Dean feels which is what he hates the most. Dean didn't look over when Cas placed his hand on his shoulder, he kept a strong hard gaze on the angel for a long time. The words that came out of Castiel's mouth sounded genuine, he's never thought about himself this way, and no one has ever told him. The only thing Dean was able to manage to get out was a deep exhale, he didn't have anything to say in response.
The Angel parted lips in an endeavor to explain how he is more worried about their plan, for Sam, for Dean..For jack what will happen once god is locked away? But the truth is freedom comes first, running around as restrained mice will never give them freedom. His bad thoughts were now ignored when he saw Dean turn to wash the dishes, and noticed how callously he moved his body. Cas admired Dean, he is a piece of art. That gives the angel shivers and some of the biggest smiles. “All I want is for you to earn your freedom Dean, Sam's, and Jacks too...everyone's, I will be there for you, all of you.” He has hope, he believed in his family that the plan will work. Right, when Cas was about to get up Dean walked away Dean gave a pat on his shoulder which caused Cas to shiver. He always deep down enjoyed whenever Dean could cradle his cheeks and hug him, he would be able to feel the soul he fell for. Castiel erased these thoughts and got off the table, he needed to get ready for what is about to come
The Hunter is amused that Cas would remember. Of course, he liked to introduce different types of films to Cas “I know he isn't but god the ending was something... The game of thrones ending was worse anyway” Dean turned back around and he decided to clean the plate instead. He picked up some soap and scrubbed the plate down with some soap and water. “I know, but I do believe this plan will work. Jack is ready and it looks like Sam is ready and I'm sure we will get our freedom and once we do we can finally go on vacation.” Dean thought about this for a little while, he feels this is such an unrealistic state of mind, but this was the only thing that kept him hoping at the moment. He didn’t want to do this plan in the first place but it's the only way they can get their freedom. Dean supposed he should get ready anyway, after he cleaned the plate he placed it neatly back in its original position along with the other plates. Dean started to head toward the steps of the Kitchen, before Dean left he gave the angel a firm shoulder pat before he finally departed. The plan should be in motion in the next couple of hours. Dean is confident this will work out and by the end of this, this will all be a bad daydream.
Castiel said he took a few steps toward the center of the room. He entered the demon trap and he’s a few steps away from Dean. He inhaled, and his breath was shaky,  his eyes already started to build up with water..but somehow the angel smiled “I know…” Cas dryly gulped and took another shaky inhale “I know how you see yourself, Dean...you see yourself exactly like our enemies see you..you're destructive, and you're angry, and you're broken, you're daddies blunt instrument...and you think that hate and anger is what..drives you, you think that’s who you are..” he paused focusing on both Dean's eyes it's not. And everyone who knows you..can see it, everything you have ever done the good and the bad, you have done for the love he empathized, and gasped out a sob, the smile on his lips remained that is who you are..you raised you little brother for love, you fought for this whole world, for love..that is who you are...
Castiel watched the hunter frown with every word that came out of Angel’s mouth. He knew he broke Dean, made him feel fractured like porcelain; sensitive, one singular poke and it could crack. It's how Cas portrayed Dean's heart...shattered hundreds of times to just be poorly put back together. Castiel's eyes frowned as well, he watched him get off the chair. The look he gave him, crashed everything inside the angel. He noticed the droplets that gathered in Dean's eyes, the reflection of mirrors like lights passing through them. He knew, and it made the guilt stronger than ever “Dean-” he tried to speak as he got off the chair. The Angel looked at the man walking away before he even had the chance to reason with him; ask him what he thought of, what this even meant. Castiel loves the hunter, he always had been the main part of his celestial life, his immortality that he so much desired to end for the sake of this righteous man who just walked away from something Cas knew was his fault “I'm sorry Dean…” he is pretty sure Dean didn't even hear what Castiel just said, and it's for the better this way..this way they are safe
Jack cocked his head to the side gently as he looked at his dad in disbelief, it's almost amazing how vivid his emotions are for even the angel that has lied before, lied again, and he believed each and every word. Jack deeply knows exactly why Castiel acted the way he did back in the storage room, and with what he can understand more from signs Dean was giving is that Castiel might as well given Dean no hope just so they contain a "professional and friendly relationship" even when both of them want each others touch, they crave it, Jack might be born just a few years ago but that doesn't change the fact he is more than that when it comes to age.
Castiel kept his hand locked with Dean's..he has not even realized what he is doing, he allowed himself to be happy for this short period of time, or at least he thought it was. From now and then he's grip his palm on Dean's as some sort of sign that gave out closure, love even...but he shouldn't do this whatsoever under any circumstances cause too much happiness, the hope of being with Dean will soon be the end of him, cause even with God gone, the deal with the empty remains intact, but he cannot help and think of how nicely their hands fit together, how his fingers kept bumping over the hunter's veins, how rough get gentle they were, it made the angel happier every second, his instinct screaming, beaming with joy...until he felt the trigger point that woke the Angel up, the most wonderful feeling he could ever ask for,
The two brothers from a completely parallel universe were passable to trick god when thinking they were at the bunker. Since the case is done the original Dean and original Sam having a drink with their alternate universe selves. After their small talk, it was time for the other two to actually leave this world. Dean was close to the staircase with Sam and the other versions of themselves. Even though the alternate universe versions are greedy, needy, and a bit annoying. Dean fairly had a good time learning about them, and now it was time to say goodbye to them.
That little spark of hope died. This was where Cas would reject him in the most nicest way possible.
Cas told her it was okay. Dean had the urge to slap her. Or slap him. God, he just wanted this over with.
Dean telling Sam to cut his hair. Late nights where the boys just sat in the living room and drank and drank. Slightly burnt burgers or takeout. Hunting.
Dean grabbed a small stack of paper, quickly scanning through it. “Nah man, this is just shit like tax returns.”
Dean nodded. “That was because we got into a fight. We were cleaning up when dad mentioned Matt. Asking if he was gay. I told him I didn’t know because I was scared shitless.”
Of course, Dean still wouldn’t believe he was an angel. He shook his head. “Nah, man, you can’t fly. That’s the most childish thing I’ve ever heard.”
Bobby snapped, “take the angel, leave the angel. I don’t give a damn. Just please stop fighting in my kitchen.”
“He’s kind of like a father to me and Sam,” Dean said. “So he’s got some serious protective issues. Don’t mind him if he seems all pissy that you’re here.”
Of course, it wasn’t long before Sam barged into his room shouting, “dude, you need to wake up, it's almost four.”
“Uh.” The amusement in Sam’s tone died, replaced with concern. “Wow, you really don’t look good. Are you sick?”
Despite telling himself not to, Castiel found himself looking at Dean’s table, observing how he was with Sam and Jo. So at ease. So comfortable.
Sam walked into the room. “Dean! Bobby says he’s found some lore on- oh.” he stopped. “There is an angel in the living room. Right. Okay.”
The ride to the roadhouse was far from quiet. Bobby kept fussing about Sam’s poor driving skills, and Dean was begging Sam to put on Led Zeppelin.
Dean was the one who lit his dead ass on fire. He watched that damn ghost burn, along with his bones. He was certain there was nothing left haunting that Church. But better safe than sorry.
All he had to do was take out his angel blade and the kill could be so quick, so swift. Dean didn’t have to feel a thing. All Castiel would have to do is will his pain away. And that would be it.
Uriel did nothing as Castiel stormed out of the guest room. He searched the living room, the kitchen, and the other bedrooms. There was no sight of Dean. Or Sam, or even Bobby.
The woman’s smile didn’t falter. “It’s okay dear, he’s right. I am getting pretty old but it is no bother because I know I am closer to Heaven,” she said.
pulled Dean out of his thoughts. Sure was a random ass thing to say. As if he could even be interested in a hookup right now.
Bec said nothing about his snarky tone. “I went to church the next Sunday. Everyone was so polite and didn’t judge me despite my skepticism. Faith had tracked me down. It also filled the void in my heart.”
Dean and Cas made their way past the living room and down the hall. Dean opened one of the bedroom doors cautiously, praying that it wouldn’t squeak. Thankfully, it didn’t.
Castiel ended up staying with the Winchesters for the rest of the evening. Dean forced him to help him with the dishes while he talked about Bobby.
“I’m tired of this stupid curse. I’m tired of this stupid headache, and I’m tired of keeping my feelings bottled up because I worry that they’re unwanted.”
“I think uh, well, don’t tell any of this to Dean, okay. He’d be livid. Just, keep this to yourself. I mean it.”
Dean pushed himself backwards a little too hard and he stumbled, landing on the floor awkwardly. “Sam, I think my legs stopped working.”
Dean’s eyes grew wide at the suggestion. “You don’t really think that, do you?” He turned to Castiel. “Do you have wings?”
Uriel sighed. “We are not made emotionless, Castiel. We are simply told we do not feel them. How else do you explain Zachariah’s impatience? Lucifer’s anger? Gabriel’s need for entertainment?”
Uriel had told him humans were difficult. They were given answers, then they didn’t know what to do with them. Castiel had thought he was exaggerating, because of course humans could simply understand the concept of angels. But it turns out Uriel was right. Humans were more difficult than Heaven let on.
Castiel hadn’t considered that before. Dean didn’t have to know why Heaven sent him. “That is correct.”
Dean grabbed a set of keys out of his pocket and tossed them at Sam. They fell a few feet away from his brother.
Dean barged into Sam’s room, only to realize a little too late what had happened the previous time he went into his brother’s room unannounced.
“All right, we’ve got larger problems,” Sam said, interrupting them. “Bec thinks someone broke her house into or something, so you need to go right now.”
A few moments later Sam came back outside and got in the car. “Okay, I checked. It looks like we’re good.” he started the car. “Dude, you okay?”
Oh, Castiel had never heard of that method before. He planted a quick kiss on Dean’s forehead. “Does that feel better?”
Castiel shouldn’t be here any longer. He’d just confront Dean another time. There were too many people here, perhaps all hunters, who all seemed to care about Dean a great deal. He didn’t want to have to defend himself from them whilst also completing his job.
The two left the bunker and headed for the Church. Once they got there, Sam insisted Dean stayed in the car.
There was no one around them. Just trees. Thorns. And a dead, decapitated vampire a few feet away. It would be easy to kill him.
Jack wasn't wrong about the world now feeling more empty than it used to. It's so weird that everything is so quiet now. Not necessarily quiet but more- less chaotic it's nice for the most part but sometimes Dean misses the thrill he missed them all working together “Oh, I would already know. Fate isn't on our side anymore and god doesn't have any control of us anymore. It's nice though” Dean paused, he got himself another drink before chugging down the small amount of whiskey he had beside him, the hunter really has a hard time trying to let go of this whole crush" thing. He feels like he's being tossed right back into grade school about that crap, he finds it stupid to take the time to do this at this point “I- look, Jack, I've tried... a couple of times but I never get the chance too.”
The other Dean took a minute, he realized what he said out loud. It didn't mean to come out that way, he should tell Cas what happened to his version. This could explain why he's so overcome with the emotions he's feeling, a feeling he's been missing for a long time. This Dean can't tell him at this point since it’s already out in the open. Dean took a deep breath before he looked at Cas with another gentle smile, their eyes piercing into one another. Their souls wouldn't connect because this was this world and they have their own, but he was more than willing to tell him. “The Mark of Cain, I'm sure you're familiar with it”  Dean started to fidget around with his hands and fingers out of being nervous “I possessed the mark for a while and I've had it longer than I could remember, there are times I wish I didn't accept the offer about it or given the choice. I took it because I couldn't stand anyone else having it at the time”  Dean explained, “After a bit of time the mark took a toll on me which in that time my angel and I were... you know.”
Dean, still half asleep considering he isn’t a morning person at all when it comes to the light of day. He managed to make coffee for himself. The Hunter turned around and leaned his back onto the table, he took a couple of sips of his freshly brewed coffee. Dean is still trying to process a lot of what is happening, the conversation he had with Jack last night and this morning with the plan finally being put into motion. Dean wondered how that would go, He can't necessarily think of the finer things in life at the moment but at most, at least everyone is together for now “Eh, I don't think Jack would do anything if you woke him up. Sam doesn't really receive wake-up calls from you either” Dean took another sip of his coffee “That's good.” He looked at the angel before taking a step closer to the table, he looked down at the done and well-made breakfast...well he might as well take some since it's being offered. With that noted, Dean picked up a plate and well took a little of what was there; he'll be mindful of Jack and Sam if they wanted any in the long run or maybe a little later. Dean finished getting himself a serving of the pancakes before he took a seat, and rubbed his eyes for a second. He thought about the question Castiel just asked. “Could be better.” Dean looked up at Cas while taking a bite of whatever the angel made... well actually it was good. Not that Dean specifically has any taste in anything.  “Somehow when you have god playing Thanos and all I was able to sleep.”
Castiel was unsure of how to react to the other version of Dean. What confused the angel was how his soul wasn't as bright as his deans are, and he could see that quite easily. As if something was missing from the alternate Universe Dean, a piece in him that was crucial for his whole living...something happened, and the way those emeralds were losing their vivid colors, almost empty, Cas can tell something is missing, the angel felt empathetic. Cas is now lost in this Dean's despair, he could feel the want in them and it hurt Cas so much, however, felt off with this Dean. This Dean looked at him so wrong, it almost felt intimate. “Yes...?” Castiel replied with his eyes squinting, and his head tilted gently to the side, he had soft features, and doing that made him look even softer. The Angel is fine in this universe but The Empty will soon take him too, somewhere a lot deeper than the bottom of the ocean.
Dean came to the main part of the bunker and looked around a little, finding the angel wasn't anywhere near the map table or in that area specifically. Dean went back to the kitchen to get himself something to eat since he didn't get to eat anything that night. Finally, He did spot the angel quite literally in the middle of dealing with being tipsy “Cas-” Dean started, with he rubbed his eyes roughly, he smells the alcohol, probably already can indicate that he did drink a bit the other night.  “What are you doing here?” Dean sounded a little concerned, but then again they're still trying to put their differences aside. “I thought you went on the case with Sam and Jack the other night,” Dean mentioned while he moved a little closer to Cas
Compared to what Dean had, Cas's hands were still somewhat big but his fingers were a lot skinnier than his. Dean closed the gap and kept his hand interlocked with the angels. He liked that their hands fit perfectly with one another...he's probably enjoying this more than he should, with this the hunter thought that Cas is reciprocating in a way, would it be safe to go a little further? Dean still has yet enough courage to gain from these small gestures so in return after their fingers clasped with one another they left it there for a good majority of the movie. Dean decided, he started to move his thumb across the angel's knuckles typically this would be an affectionate thing you wouldn't necessarily do with your friend or best friend. Dean was a little hesitant when making this decision but he hoped that Cas wouldn't mind.
One piece of it was gone because Jack took a small bit of it. He thought to himself he might as well. The hunter got a utensil from the kitchen before he served himself a piece, would it be considered rude to do this? While Dean was in the kitchen he left the popcorn for Jack to have if he wanted it. He sat back down at the table with a piece, he thought for a minute before he decided to actually eat some. It was good, very good. Dean tried to shove the thoughts he's had for a while in the back of his mind for the last couple of hours, it never worked. He finished the pie slice that he got for himself along with a slip of liquor. His thoughts really only got worse after the first couple of hours just of lounging around at the table.
With the plan put into motion, the hunters are ready for what will happen next. The plan was simple: someone takes the mark, maybe with a little help of Amara which in that time Dean was able to convince the darkness to aid in their plan. They only needed Jack and Amara to do this, they are the only two who are able to lock up god once and for all. Death is still after their asses too, one way or another they’ll have to take care of Billie as well. Dean already messed up on his part since he initially agreed to work with her, Jack. Since he already was part of some plan; to turn into a bomb was the goal to blow up God but in the end. Team Free Will 2.0 decided that plan wasn’t going to end well, not that either of their plans would work well in the first place but this sounded a lot better than the original one.
Dean did watch how Cas was in the main part cinema, he looked at him a couple of times. The angel is indeed very inquisitive when it comes to new places. really the only places he would show the angel movie is in his "Dean Cave" other than that he hasn't done much else. He didn’t look at Cas when the angel glanced over at him, he's trying to figure out a way to juggle this big box of popcorn- actually, he might save some for Jack later if he wanted any. But after some time the movie started playing once the lights dimmed down fully.
He had a hand on Cas's shoulder for a second before he moved in to simply kiss Cas on the cheek. Now that was a bit more far fetched than what he thought he was going to do. The temptation to do it on the lips lingered but he understood this wasn't his world, and he didn't belong here. But seeing this version of Cas made Dean finally believed that there are other worlds. He got really lucky to see the Angel living one last time. The Richer Dean pulled away from the Cas after pressing his soft lips onto the angel's cheek. “I hope the world treats you better than it did to him.”  Dean moved fully away from Cas finally he gave the angel one last smile. If his brother and he didn't leave any sooner Dean probably would have a harder time leaving in the first place. Dean glanced at his brother and gave him a nod; a queue that should indicate they should get going
The Richer Dean looked at the Angel and nodded softly, he's happy that he'll keep safe. “I'm glad you will.”  The Other version of Dean didn't move back from Cas quite yet. He's still looking deeply into Angel's features trying to get the best and last possible chance he'll ever be able to see "him" again. This Dean trusts that Cas will not lose the ring. Though they aren't together in this world he can at most feel happy enough he was able to give him it. One way or another, universe by universe, only if he could control time or go back. He would’ve kept the Mark of Cain on him. The everlasting regrets and wishes this version of Dean is going through, he wishes he could undo all of it. “I loved him you know…” Dean said quietly to Cas individually, he wasn't sure if the others could hear it clearly but he hoped no one else did
Castiel raised his hand gently, and made it go back as his lips parted, his posture was awkward, shy even as he took a few more steps to sit at the table, he didn't look at Dean yet but decided to try and talk with the hunter, even with the ambiance being very complicated “as you said..I don't sleep, so I thought to come here and read a few books…”  truth is, he deep down feels slightly worthless now, but at the same time, this is good...Jack can make angels or awaken the ones that died, he could try to fix heaven a bit..and maybe just maybe but Jack isn’t God, Cas could try helping him out..but as of now, he doesn't even have wings. After many hours since what happened with Billie, he turned to look over at Dean, blue eyes trying to connect with emerald ones but it was like seeking for a magnificent thick forest in the middle of a cement city
Richer Dean looked at the angel. Wait, he's seen him before... Why does he look familiar to Dean? He got a better look at the somewhat small angel that wore a long trench coat. It reminded him of his boyfriend. He doesn't know the name of this man who so happened to walk randomly in so he isn't quite sure, but he's certain it is him... Richer Dean stunned of course, by this appearance due to the fact he hasn't seen Cas since he had to bury him in a Malak box, this Dean was the one who had to put him six feet under the earth’s crust with no return. The Richer Hunter doesn't even know if he is alive, but beforehand, everything was so good... it was really good before his angel became crazy because of the mark, he didn't have any other choice at the time so Dean had to do this. Richer Dean was getting emotional by the sight of Cas. He remembered the last look he gave to Dean before taking the mark so willingly. He didn't want his angel to take the mark but Cas volunteered so easily because Cas loved Dean, he loved him so much the Angel couldn't bring himself to have Dean deal with the mark “Cas?” He said quietly while staring at the shorter angel
The Angel didn't move much away from Dean, he allowed him to come up to him even closer. Cas felt his hand being dragged out of his pocket, and the way this Dean touched his hand made him shiver because he imagined his own Dean touching him this way. His own Dean's rougher from the punches he gave, and the years of guns he had to hold, the experience of wrath and war, the blood that he spilled. Somehow they still felt almost the same, almost but so far off. Since this Dean's hand felt softer, more intimate. Was it the skin or his emotions making the gesture a lot calmer, former, and even loving? Cas shivered again after something cold touched his skin in the center of his palm. When this Dean removed his hand away from the tiny object Castiel observed and he felt stunned...was this a ring?
Dean's thumb gently caressed his knuckles and that alone made Castiel huff out a shaky breath as he felt his skin crawl and shiver, his cheeks got warmer but nothing else was said. At that exact moment, Castiel dragged his hand away from Dean's. Slithered out of the most wonderful grip he will ever have and remember. He looked away from the screen now and on his lap, he gripped his own hand that held Dean's just moments ago with his own another hand. He tried to devastate himself just in case the empty won't show up. what is he supposed to say now? apologize? there was no point...what hurts the most is the fact Dean is trying to reciprocate emotions for him that Cas never thought the hunter had
Billie expected Dean to pick a fight with her and she didn't back down too much. She expected Cas to barrel towards her but it's Dean this time. She's spoken with Dean so many times about death in general... this wasn't the way Dean's story is supposed to end. Truth was, the book was altered yet again because the Winchesters will not follow the plan. They never do, and what should she expect from the Team Free Will. If it meant killing the Winchesters to become god then so be it.
The plan was already in motion so there wasn't a chance of going back from this. However, he was able to nick Billie's arm without a lot of trouble. It actually worked, he tried to push her back that wouldn’t last for a long time. Because Billie is right there, and she's angry, there's no need to go into Death's library. Sam and Cas already had a visit; they weren't able to check the book. Dean knew that this was a dumb idea but it was the best one he had at the moment. The hunter didn't want to drop the scythe but even so, he can't keep a hold of it. Dean was frantic but subtle with his movements. He moved back quickly but wasn't sure of what to do next. Dean still looked for ways, they needed enough time for both Sam and Jack to do whatever they needed to do. He looked over to Cas, Dean took a deep breath before he turned back to Billie
The Nephilim’s head tilted a tiny bit to the side with a confused look, the frown oddly familiar to his father's frown, and the movement of his head were identical, scarcely enough that it looks copied “Godzilla, didn't we watch that movie?” He didn't know there was more than one movie about the same exact subject, but either way, he is interested to watch it. With a bright smile Jack gave his dad a nod before he left his seat “I will go dress up then,  also I'd love to drown myself in popcorn too if you do not mind getting me some.
The hunter gets up from the table and he lets go of Jack's hand. “Well it is almost three in the morning, and you should get some sleep” Dean suggests, he knows that Jack doesn't sleep much but he's still human. Dean is done for tonight he just hopes that he'll be able to at least try to talk to Cas. It's a bit hard right now, but he can't continue to go radio silent over this. It's been way too long
Jack didn’t expect Billie to show up, he should have expected it, he should be prepared but he can't fight her back. He needed to hold his powers for what he and Amara were about to do and the idea was simple, to lock god up. He’s stronger than any other Archangel so he needed to have faith otherwise all of this will all go in vain. He remained silent and waited for the signal, his eyes though fell on Cas, he looked furious, and that made him worried.
At this point Dean realized the tear rolling down his face. He quickly wiped it away and set his guitar back on the stand.
Hey guys, I know it's been a while since our last update, but we're back for the summer and updates will become more consistent. I need to send a shout out to my dad who helped sapphic_writer and I when we had to write the car scene in this chapter. He picked the car and year for us and any mechanical car issues that Dean and his employees deal with at the shop. The pronunciation of the character name Ligeia is Lye-JEE-uh.
“Oh,” Samson paused, then said, “Is that why you were mad at him? Because he was going to people heaven?”
“Oh yes, I’m congratulating my granddaughter on her engagement. She’s to marry a delightful young man. You look a bit like him.”
“He had no right coming in here and harassing you. He acts blindly and causes chaos, and expects me to be okay with it. Well, I’m not fucking okay with it. I’m not okay with him bulldozing his way into my problems and making decisions for me. I shouldn’t have to be concerned about whether or not he’s going to give out my information when I’ve got so much shit happening that I don’t know where to turn anymore. I thought I could trust him and he threw it all in my face.”
Thank you all for reading and sticking with this story! We appreciate you and love all the comments that you guys send us :)
“That’s irrelevant,” Said Castiel. Although he could’ve answered with tons of traits that caused him to like Dean. How he played the guitar. The way he sang (Dean really did have a good singing voice). Most of all, Cas loved how caring Dean appeared to be. Regardless, if Dean had only talked to him for the sake of wanting him to stop crying, Cas couldn’t put aside the fact that Dean had gotten him through a very rough time in his life. He had been there for him when no one else(except Balthazar) had bothered to check up on him.
Balthazar went to respond but stopped. A puzzled expression crossing his face then more laughter bubbled out of him.
After a few hours of pacing around the apartment with his music back on near deafening volumes, Dean was starting to feel trapped inside himself. Everything was a swirl of his own mixed thoughts and emotions. He was relieved when he heard Cas’ door shut, maybe talking to someone will keep him from feeling like he’s going crazy.
It didn’t seem as if Balthazar was going to accept Cas’ words. He kept watching him with careful eyes as if Cas was going to break at any second, and as he kept searching for a sign of weakness, Castiel made sure to keep all that he was feeling hidden. It wouldn’t do to have his brother see how close he was to the edge of breaking down. After a few more seconds of silence, Balthazar seeking out a reason to deny his brother, and Cas maintaining his resolved composer, the older brother finally gave in.
Thank you all for continuing to follow this story and we hope you enjoyed this newest chapter! The next update won't take so long I promise. Feel free to comment and let us know what you think :)
A shiver rolled through him as the memory of how it had felt to be left alone forced its way to his mind. It had slipped past the cracks in his barrier and another chill went up his spine. He felt as if he were being engulfed by the memory. Desperate to escape the feeling, Cas held out his hand towards Balthazar. The first hit he had taken did nothing for him and he couldn’t stand to keep feeling this abandonment any longer. It was only the beginning of what had happened once Dean had left and Cas wasn’t about to relive it.
He made himself up a sandwich for lunch and made sure to bring a bottle of Dayquil with him just in case. When he patted his pockets, looking for his car keys, he started cursing under breath. He stood there for a couple seconds scanning the room wondering where he could’ve possibly left them. He didn’t have the energy to start moving everything around or to crawl around on the floor to look under the couch. His legs still gave him some trouble when he tried to move too quickly. It would cause waves of pain rising up as far as his torso and slamming down to his ankles. This left him with only with two options: hope that the keys were somewhere on the cluttered nightstand or walk all the way to the flower shop. Cas looked down at his wristwatch and saw it read 7:40. Both options left him being late to opening the shop. It was tempting to just crawl back into bed and try again tomorrow, but what if Balthazar decided to pay a visit? He would see Cas wasn’t there and start a whole nother search or be smug because he was right in thinking that Cas wasn’t ready to go back to his life. Balthazar would come to the apartment to see Cas either way and did he really want to have another round of arguing about Dean when Dean himself could possibly still be right next door?
Rowena shook her head. “There isn’t exactly a cure. The spell does what it is intended to do. Make you tell your truth.”
Jo smiled. “Relax man, I was kidding. But maybe your boxers are all twisted up for a different reason.”
He knew he could charm this woman out of her pants if he wanted to. But when he imagined being in bed with her, the fantasy fell flat.
he tried to say, but instead he blurted out what had been on his mind, “I’m sure you know a lot about faith in your less youthful days.”
“Sorry,” Castiel apologized, not sure what he was apologizing for. He then processed this information, that Dean found him attractive, and a suitable partner (at least for sex, anyway), and something tugged at his gut again.
Dean Winchester was unlike anyone, human or angel, he has ever met. Yet, that didn’t mean he loved him. He hardly knew him.
The ride to Bec’s house was mostly peaceful. Cas kept asking questions. Such as whether they had any other leads or whether Dean’s curse had any other negative effects.
Sam opened his mouth, probably to make some snarky comment, when a familiar blonde entered the Church.
Sam didn’t get a chance to say anything because the sound of shattered glass resonated throughout the home, startling Bec.
“When someone questions their faith, there is always a reason. What hole in your heart, Dean, do you believe needs to be filled?” Bec asked, turning to Dean.
Bobby seemed delighted to have help in the kitchen. Sam mostly teased his brother about Castiel. And Dean, well, Castiel knew how happy Dean was that he decided to stay.
Right, questions. Their whole cover. Dean attempted to come up with a suitable question to ask her, but he couldn’t think of anything.
Dean leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to his neck. “Cas, you’ve been driving me crazy for weeks.”
“Yeah, was at the bar, was talking to me,, She was hot, you know, as witches should be I guess. And nice. Too nice.”
Uriel nodded. “Oh, of course. It is not often angels form such attachment, especially to humans, but it is not unfamiliar to me.”
“I do not understand. Why is killing an insignificant human in our best interests?” Castiel asked. It wasn’t his job to ask questions. It was not Zachariah’s job to give answers.
He grabbed the angel blade and tossed it away from him. Then he grabbed Castiel and pulled him off the car. Castiel slipped on the wet grass, stumbling. Giving Zachariah the opportunity to pin him down.
Sam raises his hands up. “Every time I try to say, ‘oh I don’t know about this, Dean,’ he does it anyway.”
“I do not understand you, Castiel.” Zachariah sighed. “I was trying to avoid all of this. Now you’re making it more difficult.”
Castiel has never shown a human his wings before. It was an act of vulnerability. Trust. But he had no other choice. Dean wouldn’t believe him any other way. Not that Castiel needs him to. It just might help Dean understand that there’s a greater good, and he is a part of it.
Castiel considered reporting back to heaven and requesting Uriel’s insistence. Then he remembered what Zachariah had said and figured this would be a failure. He’d have to kill the man without the help of another angel.
The ghost in that damn Church slashed Sam’s leg. Dean stitched it up and bandaged it as best as he could but Sam’s been limping since they left the Church.
Castiel had a choice. Dean Winchester and his friends, or Zachariah and the angels. It was hardly a choice at all. He pulled out his angel blade.
The bartender was no help. “Sorry, I don’t remember her,” he said. He passed an old man his drink and grabbed another glass. “Though, blondes aren’t really my type. I’m not sure if I would have noticed her.”
Jo sighed, “wow, you two are toddlers. Dean, what happened to Cas being the most interesting person you’ve ever met?”
The two exited the living room and proceeded down the hall, where they found Cas standing uncomfortably near a shattered window, shards of glass strewn across the floor.
“Sam’s shampoo is actually pretty nice, and I tried it a couple of times,” Dean said. It was the truth.
“Well, she was definitely Sam’s type. He’s the one who noticed her.” Dean said. “Hey by the way, Sammy, who was that redhead you were talking with, by the way?”
Rowena shrugged. “Something you’ve kept to yourself for a long time. Perhaps from yourself too. Something that eats you away at night. Something you’ve longed to say for years. That is a big truth, Dean.”
A small voice in the back of his head told him he could try talking to them. Maybe gain their trust. And
“I’ve spoken with Uriel recently. He does not want to interfere. He says something is supposed to happen, and I’m not going to kill him.”
When Sam returned with fast food, Bobby and Dean were knocked out cold. Dean was leaning against Castiel, drooling on his shoulder, and Bobby was only halfway up on the couch.
Dean shrugged. “Bobby’s in the front right? Then sure. I can sit in the back. Is the back okay with you, Cas?”
Castiel expected questions about heaven at some point. He just didn’t know how to answer. Heaven was not what most humans had expected or hoped for. What was he supposed to tell him?
“Of course I have doubts!” Dean yelled impatiently. Wait shit, no. Dean hated this damn truth spell.
“Gee uh,” Dean’s face became much more flushed. It relieved him that Cas was sitting in the back and couldn’t see him. “Thanks.”
The car ride back to the bunker was silent, but not in a peaceful way. Dean felt like he was being suffocated by the tension in the air.
“Holy crap, if you say this is some sort of great destiny thing, you can take your little prophecy and shove it up your ass,” Dean said.
For a brief moment, Dean was content. Not exactly at peace or whatever the fuck. But it was out now. His truth. It was over with, and on the plus side the world didn’t end. Until he realized Cas was still there, and Cas hasn’t said anything yet, and oh shit why hasn’t he said anything? Is he disgusted? Is he-
Bobby snorted. “That’s sure one hell of a way to put it. I’m not tryna accuse Dean of being some twelve-year-old girl, but everyone sees how much he’s into you.”
“Pfsh, I got her handled. Nothing a little swooning and romantic music can’t fix,” Bobby said. Then, he leaned closer, whispering, “you’ve seen the way Dean’s been looking at you, lately, have you?”
Dean looked at Castiel. He understood. He closed his eyes, focusing. Soon, the woman’s screams abruptly stopped.
“Cas, man, so I need your opinion on something, you being an angel and all. Credit card theft. Bad, or nah?”
Dean was starting to think he may have made a mistake. Maybe Sam was right, and she wasn’t the witch who cursed him. Perhaps she was just an innocent girl he was currently threatening.
Dean had been used to fixing himself. He reshaped and redefined himself until he was considered flawless in John’s eyes.
Sam wasn’t stupid. He knew. He knew Dean and Cas went somewhere last night, and he knew they were different when they returned to the bunker. They seemed more steady. More certain. Definitely more
Damn it, Sam was right. Of course it’d be Hella sketchy if they made small talk with a few  members, said they were searching for faith, then just up and left.
“Well, they’re sometimes the replica of someone’s happiest memory. Or, it’s what that someone has always dreamed of.”
Castiel shook his head. He was sure this nagging prick at his skin is what humans would call frustration. “I do not understand what gives off the impression that I am homeless.”
That didn’t help Cas feel any better, as Dean had hoped. “I’m sorry this is happening, Dean; if there was any way I could stop it, I would.”
Dean knew that his brother would never judge him for who he was. Cas would never judge him, regardless of whether he felt the same way. It seemed as if John’s shadow was continuously  following him around, telling him he had to be his perfect son over and over. His tenacious son. His masculine son, who remained unfazed by the weight of emotion. His son, who is straight.
Bec smiled, like she was recalling a pleasant memory. “Well, I was in a really awful place after college, with college funds, and it was difficult to find work. Then my parents recently split. It felt like my world was collapsing around me.”
“God speaks through us in many ways,” Bec said. “We are his story,” and isn’t that a little too close to the truth? “Sometimes he sends us signs, and somewhere deep inside us we know. We just have to listen.”
Castiel found Sam outside. He was sitting on top of a rusting car, as he looked up at the sky with a wistful expression. When he noticed him standing there, he jumped.
“Hey. No, don’t tell me you are responsible for me,” Dean said. “It’s not your fault I have to go through this, okay?”
Dean kissed a trail up to his earlobe. He kissed, and sucked, and Castiel was starting to feel funny.
Dean explained Cas was a friend who was also interested in faith. Cas wasn’t happy about it, but Bec wasn’t bothered and invited the three boys inside.
“We’re going to the roadhouse,” Dean said. “Oh, wait! You’ve never met Jo and Ellen have you? You’ll love them, they’re great!”
“Yeah, well. You have Dean right now. Who knows how much longer that’ll last, with his job. Don’t waste your time doubting.”
“She’s over there.” Sam pointed at a group of women. “She hasn’t stopped looking over since we got here.”
“Dad talked to me about it the next day, while we were finishing up that werewolf hunt with the two kids, remember?”
“Anyway, they haven’t taken many victims yet. Just this one teenage girl last night, according to Rufus. Should be an easy kill.”
Zachariah waved his hand. Dean gasped, and was thrown away from the car. He landed a few feet away on his back.
Castiel felt slightly offended by that and he gave Dean a wounded look. He tilted his head, “do you not like my coat?”
Dean felt woozy when he stood up. Which is odd. One drink sure as hell isn’t enough to get him buzzed.
“Sam informed me that Dean finds me arousing,” Castiel replied stiffly. His stomach swooped again as he said the words out loud.
Rowena opened her eyes. Her hand fell to her side. “You’ve definitely been cursed, alright. A Truth Spell. Those can be very tricky.”
Dean’s energy had led him in a cluttered room with old books, a tattered couch, and the reek of alcohol.
He seemed bashful as he said, “Uh, hello Dean. I just wanted to check in on you because you stated earlier this morning that you weren’t sleeping well and-”
He settled on Cas’ shoulders. And Cas was pulling him closer now, and is it this normal to feel so light headed? And-
Ellen came out from around the counter, her hands on her hips. “What the hell have you done now, boys?” she asked with a head tilt in Castiel’s direction.
“Please, Castiel. You were always heaven’s tool, but I didn’t think it was this bad.” Uriel pinched his forehead. A human gesture of frustration. “Look, it is not heaven’s way. It is simply Zachariah’s way. He learned of the upcoming future.”
Dean swiftly unlocked the door and carefully stepped inside. The house was so dark he almost ran into a wall.
He wouldn’t lie. She was pretty. Blonde, short, tight tank top. Definitely Dean’s type. And yeah, she was definitely looking at him. It’d be easy to woo her with a drink and his classic, charming smile. He just wasn’t in the mood today.
Bobby shrugged. “Well, I guess we’re keeping him, then. Guess you always had an angel on your Christmas list, huh?”
This was not going to be as easy as Castiel first presumed. He did the next best thing. He left without another word, leaving the brothers alone in that restaurant, completely dumbfounded.
This time Castiel wasn’t able to repress a smile. Dean was genuinely amusing. He wasn’t sure how he was supposed to feel about that.
“So, why Dean anyway?” Sam asked one night when the four of them were sitting at the table, eating dinner that Bobby tried to cook up.
That night, Dean left his hotel room. Probably to get some fresh air. That’s when Castiel appeared. Dean jerked back, clearly startled.
San sighed. “Forget calling Cas.” he grabbed Dean and helped him up. “Go get some sleep. I’m not about to babysit my drunk older brother.”
Castiel could sense the brothers. Their energy was a lot stronger than other humans Castiel had sensed. He followed that energy, which led him into the midst of overgrown woods, where the shorter brother swung a machete at a feeble man. Blood splattered on Winchester’s face as the man’s body fell to the ground, headless.
He could leave right then. No one would have to know he left, or if he would be coming back. Eventually a new angel would come and finish his job for him.
“Oh uh, my brother does well talking in person,” Sam said, catching on. “Is there anywhere we can meet up?”
Castiel never had to see Sam, Bobby, or Dean again. He wouldn’t have to try to identify that feeling he got when Dean smiled, or when he was close enough that Castiel could smell his shampoo.
“Oh…” Castiel grabbed on to Dean’s jacket, clenching it tightly. He was pulling Dean closer, when he should be pushing him away.
Sam called Rowena the next day. “Got anything on the curse? Oh, Okay. Right. Well, let me know if that changes. Okay.” Sam hung up.
Zachariah gasped in pain as someone shoved the angel blade through his neck, blood gushing out onto Castiel.
“Anyway uh, his mom told dad about it, because she was a bitch. Told dad he had to be careful because I was getting close to her son, and she thought he’d give me his disease or some bullshit like that.”
“No. I would not try to change what is, what should always be.” Uriel looked up at the night sky. “I hear them arguing. They know what is to come. But do not worry, Castiel. Soon they will accept what can not be prevented.”
“I don’t know how, nor care, but Zachariah knows that you were always going to fall for a human. For Dean Winchester. So, he had to have him killed. Why he sent you of all angels, I have no idea.”
Dean kept his eyes shut and pulled the covers over his head. He only had three drinks last night, yet somehow he ended up with a hangover from hell.
“That’d be really helpful,” Dean said. Haha, a truth in his lie! “Where can we find you?” Did that sound too creepy? Probably.
He didn’t go unnoticed though. As he made his way towards his car, Cas popped outside asking, “where are you going?”
When anyone brought up heaven, the first word that came to mind was tiring. Yet to humans it must not be as tiring as it is to angels. Castiel had been stuck in heaven with his brothers and sisters for centuries. There was nothing but endless white walls, and angels bickering left and right.
“Dude, I see that look on your face, and if you’re about to tell me you think my brother is hot, I’m going to dig a grave and bury myself alive,” Sam whined.
Castiel got better at hunting, cleaning, cooking, and according to Dean, he got better at kissing, too.
was that about killing me?” Dean asked loudly. “Possible concussion might be messing with my hearing
Luckily, Sam saved their asses. “We’re just curious. Growing up, we weren’t really introduced to religion.”
“Gee Cas, I know,” Dean said. Unfortunately for Dean, even his private thoughts were true, and he was forced to think about Cas’ charming head tilt against his will.
Dean looked confused. But he looked more terrified. “Uh, what the hell is going on?” he threw a hand over his mouth. “Angels can’t like, punish me for saying shit like hell, right? Oh fuck, I just swore. Damn it, I just swore again.”
“But first, you know I love you too right?” Cas asked, his voice painfully gentle and painfully sincer, and holyshit-
“It looks like someone tried to get in, but I hope we scared them off,” Sam said as he and Dean returned to Bec, who was still standing in the living room, terrified.
The brothers didn’t seem thrilled when he walked up to their table and sat down by the taller Winchester.
“It’s not a problem in the least. Is there anything I can bring you, like water or tea? We have coffee.”
“No way me too! A couple of weeks ago this girl came in that I thought was pretty cute, and Dean went up to her and said, ‘my friend thinks you’re cute.’ I wanted to shove my dagger down his throat,” Jo said. “Well, I mean I didn’t cry about it-”
“Well, it looks weird.” The shorter brother took a large bite out of his burger. “You ain’t going to be picking up chicks looking like that.”
switched the light on. The room was messier than the rest of the house. Unorganized stacks of papers on the desk, on top of a coffee table, and shoved in the corner of the room.
Perhaps he did feel something for the Winchester. Love, or maybe the start of love, affection, admiration. Whatever he felt for him, it hardly mattered. Uriel was bluffing. And Dean was supposed to be dead.
“I heard that!” Bobby yelled from across the house. “Don’t think I’ve lost my ears, boy. I’m not letting you get all lazy and dependent on that angel.”
“Buffer,” Dean added. “Also kind of ugly, from battles and shit I don’t know or to scare away humans, but you just look really pretty.”
“Would you take this seriously for one moment?” Dean said. “Who knows what crazy ass side effects this curse has!”
“Good. I ain’t ever seen no one else that boy has been head over heels for.” Bobby slapped Castiel’s back. “Good luck.” he pushed Castiel forward.
Castiel shouldn’t be spying. But now he was curious. He hadn’t realized there were other people in Dean’s life besides his brother. Now he wanted to know more about Jo and who she was to Dean.
Dean gave up. Now, there was only one solution. They were running out of leads. There was only one thing he could do now. “Yeah okay.”
“It’s no problem,” Bec said. “I hope to see you around. Oh, I never got your names. I’m Bec, by the way.”
Bec ran out of the room and Dean tried to follow her. “Listen, I don’t want to do this the hard way, you can undo this curse and we can forget this ever happened!”
The two were now marching towards him. Perhaps they meant to be intimidating, but Castiel did not feel threatened and felt no need to flee.
The bar wasn’t as full as it was the previous night. Which made Dean’s job easier. He asked around. Everyone told him they haven’t seen her. Sam asked around and got more successful answers thanks to his puppy eyes.
Uriel glared into Castiel’s eyes, like he was searching for something hidden. “You cannot kill Dean, correct?”
Dean elbowed Sam and muttered, “Imagine there’s a bunch of dead birds inside. Is that the kind of freaky stuff you like?”
“You lack faith,” Castiel said. “I do not see what you find so hard to believe. You just kill a vampire.”
“I’m just tired. Hunt wore me out.” Dean said. He drank the last of his beer and then slammed the glass down on the table. “I’m going to get another drink.”
Castiel couldn’t shake off Uriel’s words. They stayed with him days after, repeating themselves over and over.
To suggest an angel grew such an attachment, or felt anything at all, was absurd. Castiel wasn’t in love with Dean Winchester. He
Once they stepped inside, Castiel willed himself to draw out his angel blade. Yet, he couldn’t find it in him.
Bobby would tell them to stop being big saps (except when Dean would bring up Ellen, then Bobby got embarrassed).
“What about Ellen?” Castiel asked. He worried she might come back and slap him a few more times, just for being there.
And it was simple, and it was complex. And it was so warm, and Cas was grabbing onto his jacket now, and Dean reached out. He wasn’t sure what he was reaching out to; he just needed
Dean paused for a moment, then continued. “He told me Matt’s mother told him, and that I should stay away from him. I messed up, I asked him why, and he looked me in the eye and he said-” his voice trailed off.
Castiel found the Winchester brothers in a cheap restaurant. One of the brothers was extremely tall, and the other was short. The short one was also devouring a mountain of fries and a double cheeseburger. If this was Dean Winchester, he’d be dead before Castiel had the chance to kill him.
It took a moment before he could recollect his thoughts. It took even longer for Castiel to notice Zachariah standing in front of them.
“I do not have any feelings for Dean Winchester.” Castiel stood up. “Nor his brother. Same with Bobby Singer, I feel nothing for them.”
He tried to muster up all his courage. He brought Dean out here to kill him. So why was he freezing up now?
“I understand you don’t wish to say,” Bec said. “Did you feel wronged, because the others judged you for loving another man?”
Castiel was never sent to Earth before. But surely killing Dean Winchester couldn’t be too difficult. “I can manage.”
Dean actually woke up early the next morning, and the three sat down together as they drank their coffee.
“Needed some fresh air,” Dean said. He looked back at Castiel, looking more confused than he had before.
“Uh, yeah I guess so, uh.” Dean busied himself by lifting his empty coffee mug to his lips. And was his bottom lip torn? Sam shook his head.
Castiel didn’t know how to respond to that, because Dean’s hand was pulling at the hem of his shirt, and everything else felt so distant.
Angels aren’t supposed to want things. Angels are unbiased creatures, who only want the best for humanity. For all good things. Or at least, that was how it’s supposed to be. Right then, Castiel’s stomach flipped, and he
Castiel was not focusing on Dean, or the little space between them, or how hot it suddenly felt cramped up in the car. He did notice Dean has freckles. He wondered how long it would take to count them all.
Sam gave her his phone, and she added her number. “If you have any questions, I’m just a text away. Or a call, if you prefer.”
Angels are known for their demands. They simply know what is best for humanity. Or what God wants. Even if he hadn’t exactly been telling them himself, nowadays.
“Hey, if you two are going to have a lovers quarrel, could you please have the angry sex out the car?” Sam said.
Castiel had asked himself the same question on many occasions. When he thought he found the right answer, it felt almost like an excuse a few moments later. He didn’t know why he felt so fondly of him. Or what exactly that fondness meant. He just knew he didn’t want to kill him.
Dean noticed. “Wait.” he tried to sit up straighter, but he ended up stumbling back against the couch again. “Shit, sorry. Heaven isn’t paradise?”
As charming as it was to watch the three of them bickering, and it was charming, Castiel had a mission to complete, and he wasn’t completing it like this.
So, he kissed Cas back, and it felt even better. Cas took this as a sign of encouragement, and he pressed harder, and Dean was probably going to pass out any minute.
Sam laughed. Castiel immediately regretted asking. He thought Dean liked Castiel, and that maybe he considered him a friend. That he trusted him. But perhaps he had misinterpreted it all. Perhaps he thought wrong.
“I’m Dean Winchester, and I hunt plenty sons of bitches like you,'' he said. “Now, I’ve got a couple of witch-killing bullets in my car and I got an angel on my side. So you can drop the innocent faithful girl crap, okay?”
The next day, Dean woke up and headed to the kitchen, and there he was, sitting with Sam at the table while he drank his stupid kale mush.
“What? Oh, no no! I wasn’t laughing about that,” Sam said, noticing Castiel’s crestfallen look. “Sorry, I wasn’t laughing at you.”
Dean wanted to tell his brother to go fuck himself, but he ended up saying, “I have a hard time sleeping.”
Bobby flushed red. That’s when Castiel noticed the Impala’s back door was wide open, and sitting in the back seat was Ellen.
He had a few options. He could walk up to them, ask who Dean Winchester was, and then kill him there. But other families surrounded the brothers and they might take notice. He could wait until they were finished eating and then follow them home.
“So get this, her name is Bec Rodrigo and she actually hosts a lot of charity events and attends the Church,” Sam said.
Humans were ignorant creatures. He had been told such. He didn’t have to be patient with them, nor kind. He was only sent to kill Dean Winchester.
As the two got into the car, Sam was smugly grinning at Dean, and Dean fought the temptation to hit him in the back of the head.
Sam didn’t yell, or attack him, or run away like Castiel had expected. In fact, the Winchester seemed pretty calm, for someone who was just told heaven sent an angel to kill his brother.
“Well, maybe there aren’t many cures for this curse, Dean,” Sam said. “We already know one. You’re just too much of a coward to go through with it.”
It was the sensible thing to do. The right thing to do. The thing any loyal, respectable angel would have done a long time ago.
Cas took a step closer to him. Dean could smell his strange, but nice, grassy signature scent because he was so close.
Castiel turned and found Uriel standing behind him. He stared at him smugly, as if he knew the doubt the angel was feeling.
Dean tried to regain his courage. He came here to talk to Sam. Honestly. He made it this far. No use talking himself out of it now.
“Nothing like that Sam, jeez. She, uh, left me alone after I basically told her I wasn’t interested.”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut. He remembered Matt’s pained expression when he first came out to Dean. Then, he remembered his sigh of relief when Dean told him it was alright, that it did not matter.
He forgot about the damn truth spell early in the morning. Or afternoon, or whatever. He was too groggy to think straight.
“What?” Dean could hear his heart pounding in his ears. “Wait, no. Shit. Yeah. Yes-” he was silenced successfully by Cas’ lips.
“I love teasing Dean,” Sam said happily. “Makes up for the time he told this girl back in middle school that I like her.”
“It sounds like you all can use a little faith in your life,” Bec said. “Keep coming to the Church, it might do you some good.”
Dean shook his head. “Man. Because you kinda just followed me home one day, and hey, now Bobby says I get to keep you,” he winked.
“Well, pretty sure you turn him on just a bit,” Sam said. “Now please don’t tell him I said that. I will pluck off your wings and make fried angel wings, man. I mean it.”
“We’re going now,” he said. To Dean, he whispered, “come on, we’ll find another way to cure your curse.”
He didn’t get used to the way Dean pushed him against any surface to kiss him. Sam said that was gross, too.
Angels did not give out suggestions. Everyone knew this. When an angel tells you something, it is an order. A demand. Not a suggestion. It’s not something you could look at and go
“I guess I just always felt bad for my brother,” Sam said. “I always hoped there was more for him, and I realized I was hoping for me, too.”
Castiel had assumed telling them Heaven ordered him to kill Dean would not be appreciated. So, he stuck with, “I’m a friend.”
Cas kissed him again. Then he kissed him a few times after that. Dean never got used to the way it made his lips tingle after Cas pulled away, or the way his stomach answered each kiss by doing somersaults.
“That’s not fair, I’m not even riding shotgun.” Dean said with a pout. To Castiel, he added, “back me up, Cas.”
Dean’s stomach jumped, and he had to remind himself that Cas didn’t mean it like that. Cas loves Dean, he knew that, just not in the way that Dean loved him.
“Right, some mission involving Dean you can’t tell us about,” Sam said. Castiel detected a hint of sarcasm in his tone.
Castiel stood outside Bobby’s home late that night, watching. He felt a need to protect the men inside. This need felt new, and it confused him.
kill Dean Winchester. But he had no experience with human conversation. He’d fail his first mission, and then Zachariah won’t give him another one.
“I’m okay,” Dean groaned, sitting up. “Gonna have a headache from hell, though. Oh damn it, I just keep saying it.”
“Nah man, not interested,” Dean said. It was the truth. Shit. Well, too late now. “Like I said before, not really in the mood.”
“Dude, are you homeless?” asked the taller brother. “If you are, you could just say something. We’d help you out, man.”
He cleared his throat and said, “Uh. I guess as a kid I always felt like I couldn’t be myself. My dad expected me to be a father figure to Sam for him and to take care of everything. He wanted me to grow up to be a strong guy who would one day settle down with a wife. He only cared about what he wanted for me and didn’t give a damn about what I wanted for myself.”
Rowena arrived at the bunker fairly quickly, and she had Dean take a seat. She lifted her hand to his forehead and massaged in circular motion.
Castiel knew he’d have to tell him or Dean sooner or later. As the days faded, so did the mission. It felt faint. It felt so long ago, when it had only been a few weeks. Castiel forgot what wanting to kill Dean Winchester felt like.
Uriel took a few steps towards him, his smirk wider now. “Well. I’m assuming you’re failing, because you were always meant to fail this mission.”
Rowena continued, “tell the new couple that I am happy for them. I must go now. There is a pretty, very naked lady waiting for me in my bedroom. Good day to you.” With that, she hung up.
The brothers stared at him blankly. They were struggling to understand. Perhaps Castiel should explain better. Though he couldn’t comprehend what was so confusing about his statement.
As they left, Sam said, “I don’t know, man, definitely not getting any witch vibes from her. More so therapist vibes.”
Sam’s suspicions didn’t lessen from there. He was always trying to get information out of Castiel, asking him who sent him to earth, asking him about the other angels, asking him about Dean.
After the Church service was over, Dean and Sam sought out Bec. They caught up with her outside the Church.
“Hm, she goes to the Church, you said? Heh, when she was ready to get down on her knees, I don’t think she had praying in mind.”
“Oh, that’s not enough, I’m afraid. All magic has a goal. No one curses someone just to watch them spill out truths left and right. It works through all your smaller truths until it gets to your
“Since-” Dean quickly stopped himself from saying anything stupid. “Anyway, if she has a black cat, get the hell outta there.”
Dean spun around to find Bec standing in the doorway, her arms crossed. He hadn’t even noticed she opened the door.
Sam and Dean went to a local bar to celebrate after the hunt. The bar was packed, and the loud music hurt Dean’s head, but the beer tasted great, and the women were hot, so it was worth it.
“You’re my best friend, you’re like family to me, and you’re important to me no matter what you do or don’t do.”
be. He was just stalling his first mission. He was just worried Zachariah wouldn’t give him another one. That’s all this was.
“Well, I hate to ruin the fun but we’ve got some business to take care of,” Dean said. He dragged Sam and Castiel into the hotel room, then he closed the door.
Dean was making this difficult. Why couldn’t he just accept the fact Castiel is an angel and then move on?
Bobby came back with two beer bottles and handed one to Dean, and then he plopped down beside him, stretching his legs out. “I almost fell in the kitchen.”
Sam explained to him, “She’s asking you what your motivation is for turning to faith.” Dean could hear the amusement in his brother’s tone.
Castiel should have killed Dean by now. He should have killed him days ago. Every time he considered it, or came close, he felt an uncomfortable tug in his gut that made him stop every time.
“Fine, whatever. Not insulting ya, boy. I’m just telling ya. I’ve seen how you look at Dean. It’s how I used to look at my wife.”
When they arrived at Bec’s house, it was just as tidy and lovely as Dean had imagined. The grass was perfectly green, and the house was surrounded by neatly manicured rose bushes. It’s unmistakably a witch’s work.
Jo dragged Dean towards a table and Sam happily followed them. Once they sat down, Ellen marched up to Bobby, slapping him.
Dean pulled back and grabbed onto Castiel’s trench coat. “This is annoying,” he said. “You should wear it less often.”
While Sam and Dean approached the front door, Cas slipped around the house. Dean rang the  doorbell, then rang it a few times more just to be an ass until Sam smacked his hand away.
Dean handed him a wet plate. It almost slipped out of Castiel’s hands. “What am I supposed to do with this, Dean?”
Dean didn’t answer. He opened the car door and slid inside. Sam eventually gave up and got in the car as well, starting the engine and pulling out of the driveway.
Sam was always patient with him. He genuinely cared about Dean. Of course Sam would love Dean no matter what. Why couldn’t he just hold on to that? Why did this have to be so difficult?
He woke up an hour later and he still felt like his head was being ripped open. Fuck. That bar must use some pretty strong stuff.
Sam was there too, but he was talking with an older lady at the counter. They were going over a newspaper article.
“What are you supposed to do when you learn something that you refused to believe in your whole life is real?”
“Oh sure, the day I found out vampires hopped out of Twilight, I was pretty shook. Same with witches, and magic in general. But this?”
Dean looked thoughtful for a moment, then he took another large gulp of beer. “Jo, I don’t like talking to you. You make my head hurt.”
Did he have to keep asking him that? Dean tried to tell him he was fine. Instead what he said was, “no.”
Sam was a lot more faithful than he was, and didn’t seem uncomfortable standing in the Church while being greeted by a bunch of overly nice middle-aged couples.
Sam said, “I’ll go check it out.” He stood up and turned to face Bec. “Stay put; you’ll be safe here.”
Sam saved him by asking, “what about finding the witch who cursed him? If we find her, maybe gank her, would that cure Dean?”
Staying with the Winchesters hadn’t been his order. But he couldn’t find it in him to leave. And he couldn’t find it in him to kill Dean.
The door swung open at that very moment. There stood Bec looking happy to see them. “Hello! Please come in! I apologize for the mess; I didn’t have much time to clean.”
“I’m going to get a drink,” Dean said, pushing past his brother and heading towards the counter. He pretended he didn’t hear his brother’s laughter behind him.
Dean’s voice thickened. “I stopped hanging out with Matt, closed myself off man. I tried so hard, so hard dude, but. I just. I couldn’t hide from myself as easily as I could from dad.”
Dean hurried out the roadhouse, and Castiel followed him. He only noticed both Bobby and Ellen weren’t anywhere to be seen as they headed out.
Castiel and Dean whip around. By the hotel door stood Sam, his hair a mess, and his face grim. “What are you doing up?”
“If you want to walk around with a stick up your ass, that’s fine. But am I really the only one who thinks all of this is weird?”
“Uh, at least by me dinner first,” Dean tried to joke, but the words were shaky, and his face was flushed red.
There was only one person who he could call for help. Castiel sat on the dusty floor of Bobby’s guest room and prayed to Uriel.
“Oh shit.” for a brief moment, Dean looked horrified. “Uh, I hope angel nicknames aren’t offensive.”
Perhaps telling Dean he was sent to kill him would be a bad idea. Dean is clearly an excellent hunter, and so is his brother. They might have never encountered an angel until recently, but they will eventually stumble across some accurate information on angel sigils.
“That’s exactly my point!” Sam said. “You used to deny these kinds of things too. So why are you so on board with this random stranger, who happens to be an
Cas. Right, Cas. Dean couldn’t lie for shit and Sam wanted to call Cas. Everything about this was a bad idea.
Bec nodded sympathetically. “I was like that too, there’s nothing wrong with that of course, not being religious. But I always wondered if there was more to life than just living, paying your taxes, and then dying.”
Castiel looked away. He didn’t see when the brothers jumped on the bed and killed the two vampires. He didn’t hear their screams, either.
Dean’s ears were burning. This was a mistake. He should have found another cure. He never should have told him. “Yeah.”
he tried to say. “He means you could be practicing magic elsewhere, which would explain the lack of evidence we’re finding here.”
Cas stretched out and placed his hand on his forehead. Even after Cas pulled his hand away, Dean’s skin tingled.
Dean shrugged. “Eh, it’s been a wild day, huh? Lost dad, next thing I know, I got myself a pretty boy angel,” he laughed. “Just my luck.”
