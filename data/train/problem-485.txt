The John Watson that Sherlock Holmes knew was dead. John had done everything he could to try to bring him back to life, but it was futile.
John giggled and flicked the kettle off, turning in Sherlock’s arms. “Lead the way my dear fellow, I am all yours.”
Suddenly Sherlock’s voice had flashed through his mind “Because you’re an idiot”. John had shook his head – surely that can’t be a memory? Sherlock wouldn’t call him an idiot....right?
“Stop” Finn’s voice was once again strong “Just stop” Sherlock could see the tears now running freely down the boy’s cheeks. “You survived your fall, we have to believe he will survive his.”
Sherlock, still stunned, nodded dumbly. “No more negativity.” He agreed. “That was very well put Finn, your father would have just punched me.”
“In a way it does, it helps me realise that I can’t do anything about the past, but maybe I can use it to help others move past their own demons and have their own futures.”
With a sigh and a resolve to soothe John in the only way he could at the moment, he opened his bedroom door to go find his violin. He was shocked to find John standing at the kitchen counter, making tea. The other man turned at the noise, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you.” He looked back and down at his tea and coughed “I couldn’t sleep with this storm.”
The ‘whole girlfriend thing’ was tearing him up from the inside out. “I appreciate you not inviting Martha tonight.”
The detective shook his head, his wild curls bouncing with the movement. John’s other hand found its way to one of those cheekbones. “Well first of all I have been obsessed with your cheekbones for longer than I will admit.” The lips under John’s thumb broke into a wide smile and another blush adorned the cheek under John’s other thumb. “And second of all I am madly in love with you too you great git.” And with that John Hamish Watson kissed Sherlock Holmes for the very first time. It was chaste, unhurried, but not unsure.
John had gotten a little teary. “I couldn’t face going to a crime scene and seeing a corpse and I knew if I saw you I would talk about it and I wasn’t ready. So I went out with Sarah for some inane chatter and distraction.”
He had been on his best behaviour before the bomb, but now that he had been forgiven, he had found that behaving was boring.
John paused and contemplated his response. “Why were you asking me Sherlock? Was it so we could fit into a ‘normal people’ box?”
“Thank you.” John simply stated. He was touched by the words and truly grateful for the man’s patience. How hard must it be to not be recognised by the man you love and still welcome him into your home?
Sherlock pulled the violin off his shoulder. “You would remind me that it wasn’t real, that I was safe, that you were safe, that....that I wasn’t alone and then you would....hold me.”
“Wonderful” the doctor retorted. He finished off the tea and brought it through to their respective chairs, before he took a seat.
“That’s better,” Finn conceded. “And, as you so bluntly put it, it’s likely that you will have to remember for both of you, for the three of us. Maybe that’s what we need to do to get through the storm.”
She had planned it all – she would set up a crime scene, just like James' suicide. She would then work her way through some of the places that meant something to Sherlock and James: the lab where they first met, the roof, the pool. While he was obsessed with figuring out what was going on, she would kidnap John and make him wish he had never met Sherlock Holmes. She would torture Sherlock by torturing John and him knowing that it was all his fault. Their happily ever after would fall apart.
John nodded in response. “At the crime scene, after you deduced who the killer was from my....stupidity.”
“I’m sorry” Sherlock stared at his tea, as they sat, quite formally opposite each other at 221B’s kitchen table. John had arrived back home in borrowed flip flops, to a stressed out Sherlock. He had got changed and the detective had made tea.
Arousal shot through the detective at this, he did love it when John was impressed with him and he usually was very enthusiastic in showing how much. Sherlock had looked it up once, apparently it’s called a praise kink. He had a praise kink that was very John Watson specific.
Warnings for this chapter: mentions of a gun. Hospital scenes and description of intensive care. Mentions of drug use.
Sherlock gulped at this. John continued “I wanted your legs wrapped around me.....” Him and Sherlock were almost touching now. “And I love it when you look at me over your steepled fingers, I always want you to put them-“ His husband cut him off with a kiss at this and started pulling off John’s ever present woollen jumper. He was relentless and a force of nature in his pursuit and John was more than happy to be pursued. Not long after he found himself on the floor, Sherlock over him – ok yeah make up sex he was totally down for that.
Finn’s eyes showed his surprised, eyebrows disappearing under his fringe, but they remained focused on John. “Everything?” He questioned “Not just odd moments?” John nodded, smiling. His son started to well up, before he brought him back into another hug “That’s unbelievable!”
“Ugh God don’t be sickeningly loved up, us sad singletons can’t cope. Was the ceremony just as bad? You and him staring into each others eyes like the rest of the world didn’t exist?”
Mycroft had chosen this moment, in John’s journey of self discovery, to follow him round London in his black vehicle of doom. John’s attempts to avoid the inevitable chit chat had been for nought, as he had found him self opposite the smarmy face, in the back of said vehicle.
“But I’m not” John said firmly, but quietly “I can’t live my life second guessing every move I make. I have given it a good go – the best I could do and I am glad I did. But your outburst made me realise that we are always going to have this cloud over our heads and I can’t live my life like that. I have already lost twelve years, I don’t want to lose any more trying to live a life that’s not mine.”
“Tell me about it.” John implored. “Tell me about our lives together.” Perhaps it would help John remember how he became worthy of such a man.
Finn pulled his father towards him and sobbed onto his shoulder. “It means so much to me that you remembered something and especially that.”
you,” he insists, tempted to jam a finger into his chest to punctuate his words. “I know how you are. You generally don’t even
Then all of a sudden, his eyes widen and he makes a sound like choking on air. After another momentary pause, he clears his throat and explodes into motion, nearly sprinting to his music stand to straighten an already tidy stack of sheet music. “Um, th-thank you, John, that was um. A very nice thing for you to say even though it clearly isn't finished yet but I suppose if you'd like I could play it for you when it is. Well, that is of course if you even care to hear it.” Sherlock shrugs jumpily as he fiddles with the latches on the window. He is acting like a complete maniac, thinks Mycroft.
John listens to the easy sound of Sherlock's breathing for a moment. He gestures between them, lying parallel to each other on the bed. “Why are you doing this?” He hopes it doesn't sound accusatory—it certainly isn't how he means it. He means to say that Sherlock is wonderful, and brilliant, and quite possibly the best thing that has ever happened to him, and that he doesn't know what he ever did with his bloodstained hands to deserve him.
“You were screaming,” Sherlock murmurs, still stubbornly facing away from him. And instantly John remembers; the nightmares come back to him in a flash. Tonight, they had ranged colorfully from Afghanistan to Moriarty. From his men bleeding out beneath his hands to frail old ladies forced to speak their killer's twisted words for him. Bombs strapped to every part of him, and Sherlock staring at him like he didn't know who he was as John stepped out of the shadows, that sickly sweet voice giggling threats into John's earpiece.
“Shh, hush now.” He lets his hand creep into Sherlock’s pajama bottoms, feels Sherlock hot and throbbing as he closes his hand around him and tugs experimentally upward. Sherlock lets loose a groan and grips John tightly by his hips, all protestations gone, as he sweeps his thumb expertly over the head and uses the warm wetness there to make the next glide of his hand over Sherlock’s skin slick and effortless. The sense of disbelief and giddy urgency had faded into a singular passionate intensity, and John is slow and precise in his movements now, watching Sherlock’s reactions with relished anticipation. Sherlock lets his head crane back against his neck, cheeks flushed a rosy hue and his remarkably full lips parting in pleasure.
, he recalls saying of the doctor, and it seems to ring even truer now as he watches them. But there is a pit in his stomach now, too. With the capacity to care comes the capacity to hurt, and Mycroft recalls distinctly the catastrophe of a hurt Sherlock Holmes, the dark alleys and rampant self-destruction that come with it. Caring is not in any way an advantage, after all.
happen, then. John doesn’t regret a second of it, except for the fact that it hadn’t happened sooner. He can only desperately hope Sherlock feels the same. Of course John would never—
asleep, but is now groaning lowly in John's ear, and if he isn't mistaken, is sporting a new and very palpable stiffy of his own. It tents in his pajama bottoms and leaves little to the imagination even through the darkness. His hips have started to rock ever so slightly against John's, a subtle, unconscious movement, but it is driving John absolutely insane either way. For the love of Christ, he wishes he’d been forewarned somehow that Sherlock didn’t sleepwalk, or even sleep-talk, but instead, apparently, had goddamn
,” he whispers mostly to himself, nose pressed into the safety of Sherlock’s wrinkled burgundy dressing gown.
Just the words make John’s skin burst with a newfound heat. John eases the fabric down his hips, and Sherlock’s cock bounces against his stomach as he frees it. It’s rock hard and leaking from the head, a flushed dusky pink color; it is perfectly long and slender, just like the rest of him.
The full-bodied tension that had been sticking persistently to him like cobwebs for weeks melts away and seems to roll off his fingertips like water as he relaxes into the embrace, fingers finding purchase in Sherlock’s wondrously soft head of curls. John had always been somewhat of a player—had his first kiss in primary school and took off running from there—but in all candor, he’s never had a kiss that felt like this. Though to be fair to all those that came before this, none of them had been with Sherlock, which immediately knocked several points off the top. He lets himself sink into the kiss, hardly knowing what to do with his hands now that they’re suddenly allowed to roam over Sherlock as they please. He lets himself indulge in all of the new sensations flooding his system, succumbing to siren-like pull of Sherlock Holmes at full volume.
Sherlock doing? John knows, of course he remembers, what happened that night they had just come back from the pool—but that night had been
sign on the outside of a secret treehouse. “Nah, mate, thanks. But I don’t wanna—impose or anythin'—”
So John does. He practically collapses on top of him, and with Sherlock keeping them firmly gripped together, John lets his desires take over his movements, and frots against Sherlock’s cock with abandon, grunting incoherent indecencies and praise into his ear as he feels his release building quickly in his lower abdomen. Sherlock whimpers and squirms and moans profanities with hot breath against his skin, and John knows he can’t withstand it for much longer, because just the sound of Sherlock panting his name is going to make him come. Sherlock cranes his neck and sucks one of John’s earlobes into his mouth, grazing it roughly with his teeth, and John’s eyes roll back in his head. He cries out with pleasure, and feels his rhythm falter, a violent twitch in his abdomen warning him. “Sherlock, I’m—I’m going to—”
have a wank; it’s actually turning out to be thoroughly awful, and he thinks he wouldn’t wish this kind of acute sexual frustration on almost anybody—it’s practically the newest form of torture. John is logically sure that that isn’t true, but it bloody well feels like it from where he’s at.
,” Sherlock can’t help but call after him. Greg’s face heats as he shuts their door behind himself a little firmer than necessary. He’d
Mycroft has always known that his own detached relationship with music differs quite a bit from his brother’s convoluted one, and he finds himself almost covetous of that ability now as he observes the contentedness in Sherlock’s body language as he sways in time with his own flowing composition. What it must be like, he thinks, to find such an absolute level of satisfaction in something as tedious and inconsequential as well-placed notes and chords. Mycroft himself doesn’t mind a bit of something classical playing in the background while he’s sat at his desk doing paperwork or pouring himself a nick of scotch, but it’s only just that with him--background. For Sherlock, it is something infinitely more. He has always seen it; the polar difference between them, the added depth present in his little brother, of which Mycroft unfailingly lacks; no matter how strongly Sherlock tries to deny his own humanity, he certainly possesses a more potent amount of it than Mycroft ever has.
“I saw how badly it affected Harry...I never wanted to open myself up to that once I realized I had an interest in men as well as women. Plus, I had never met anyone I cared about enough to come out for, either. If Dad had found out when I was younger, he never would have helped me pay for med school. So, I just kept it to myself, and it kind of became habit to deny it. But now, there’s you,” he scooches closer and grabs Sherlock’s hand. Looks up to find his thunderstorm-blue eyes softer, more empathetic, somehow as they settle on him. If Sherlock were his, John thinks, he would shout it from the rooftops and make t-shirts with their faces on them. He would be so over the moon to call this man his, he wouldn’t give a shit who approved or didn’t. Sherlock gives his hand a reaffirming squeeze.
Mycroft shakes his head and looks back to his phone, heading down the staircase and away from the bickering men in the flat. Who would have thought that all it takes to control Sherlock Holmes is a stuffy little army doctor with distasteful fashion sense? Mycroft is beginning to see now, despite himself, what Sherlock sees in him. Perhaps he isn’t so ordinary as Mycroft had originally believed.
Casting all other thoughts aside, John allows himself a moment to observe the unique beauty of the man beneath him. Sherlock’s breath is hitching rapidly, ratty t-shirt ridden up to his chest and wrinkled by the indentations of John’s fingers. His pupils are blown wide with arousal, a thin ring of murky blue outlining them. His pink lips are parted and swollen, his cheeks such a mottled shade of red that they almost look bruised, and his long, pale arms are splayed candidly on either side of his body, making him look uncannily like a lustful maiden on the cover of a romance novel. John is aware somewhere in the back of his mind that he has been gazing at him for too long, once again. Sherlock’s expression begins to falter, misinterpreting his expression. He looks immediately rejected, which John thinks is ridiculous. After all, who would reject Sherlock Holmes from their bed? Personal bias aside, John has heard the way people talk, knows acutely the whispers and wandering gazes that follow Sherlock everywhere he goes.
The hand on John’s cheek abruptly freezes, but John doesn’t notice much of anything at all as he finally lets himself sink into the insistent darkness of a deep, sated sleep.
Greg sighs and rubs his temples. He guesses he shouldn’t have to explain them to him, anyway. A few vaguely questionable deaths, a jewelry store robber gone missing, and one lone case of some poor old woman’s lost cat, which he isn’t even sure how ended up on his desk in the first place. Either way, pretty self-explanatory stuff.
The folders are snatched from his hand before he’s even pulled them out of his coat. Sherlock runs off to his bedroom like a dog with a bone. “...are some cold cases. You’re welcome,” he mutters in response to the slam of Sherlock’s bedroom door.
Lestrade hums vaguely in agreement and diverts his attention back to the road. Sally’s mouth doesn’t consult her before it opens, and says, “I have tea still hot in my thermos. Would that help warm him up?”
diatribes to rile her up and make her want to throw herself out of the car, she gives herself a moment to observe him for a change. He almost looks like a different person, face slack in sleep, shivering pathetically and curled into his doctor for warmth. And the way which John cares for him is blindingly obvious; he had stepped readily back into the role of army doctor for him tonight, barking orders and controlling the situation without hesitation.  If it were someone else, someone not so
John was staring into Sherlock’s eyes, looking—for lack of a better word—starstruck. Both of their chests had moved up and down rapidly, brushing up against each other with every labored breath. They were silent for a long while. John’s eyes had moved back and forth over Sherlock’s face, like he was searching for something, and had lingered quite blatantly on the other man’s lips. He’d taken a deep breath, then said, breathily, “Sherlock?”
is currently pressed up against Sherlock's thigh, hard and insistent. He swears low under his breath, a sudden heat overcoming him of which he isn’t sure is due to embarrassment, arousal, or both. Probably both. He’s got to find a way out of this,
he’ll give you a case worth your while. It might even rank higher than an eight,” he cajoles as a last effort, voice almost playfully condescending.
“Come here,” Sherlock snarls, and grabs John harshly by the back of the neck with both hands, pulling him down for yet another blissfully wild kiss, teeth clacking together in their haste. They try to divest themselves of their clothes, but they both end up with their pants just hastily pushed midway down their thighs. Sherlock’s hand splays over the nightstand searchingly, and soon he is pouring a generous amount of lube into his palm, fervently coating his own cock and then reaching for John’s to do the same. John hisses as Sherlock holds them together with one large hand, thrusting up into it with force, veins in his neck straining as he throws his head back against the headboard with a primal groan of satisfaction. Their skin slides easily against each others’, without impediment, and all of John’s nerve endings are on fire with the unreplicable sensation of it. They set a steady pace together, and John knows that neither of them will last long.
“Well you weren’t meant to find them or go looking through my stuff.” John was trying to take the high ground before he gave in to those lustful eyes. “I give these tags the upmost respect and I wore them with pride. They are not available to fill out your sexual fantasy.”
“Oh God” John groaned, as he saw the other man fall to his knees in front of him. “Bloody hell.” He muttered.
Sherlock had frozen at that and had almost given up on the whole proposal plan, because that sounded like an excellent way to spend an afternoon. “Tempting, but no that’s not what I had in mind.”
Flashback - Sherlock has been back from the dead for a month and John is still trying to come to terms with it. Through extreme measures our boys are brought back together.
“I-I didn’t know how else to come back to you.” Sherlock started once their eyes had locked. “I found out you were on a date tonight and I thought it would be like old times....Me coming along and ruining them.”
After being politely escorted out, John had had to try to explain to his date where the mild mannered doctor she had met had disappeared to, but to no avail. She had been quite shocked in his abrupt change in demeanour and had left before Sherlock’s nose had stopped bleeding.
The beautiful man looked a bit shocked at the question. John hadn’t really thought how much this must be affecting Sherlock, too lost in this new reality.
“We need to tell Dad!” And just like that John’s euphoria popped like a balloon. Finn leaned back and looked at John with puppy dog eyes.
His son blushed. “Dad and his big mouth.” He sighed. “He deduced it whilst you were in hospital actually and I let him ask questions to provide a distraction. Normally I wouldn’t give him any ammunition that he didn’t already deduce.”
The detective had been in a good mood on his arrival, busying himself with something at his microscope and John had offered to make tea.
The numbness had fully taken over again, after the brief respite, with his anger at Mycroft, which had evaporated now. He doesn’t remember getting to the ward or how he ended up watching his son going  through the door to a private room. He stopped at the threshold and he could feel his brother breathing down his neck. The door had closed behind him and Sherlock could see a distorted form in the door’s small window.
Sherlock’s head and shoulders (now complete with his customary scarf and Belstaff) reared round the door to the kitchen. “John!” he expressed impatiently. “Come now! The game is on!”
“Due to the significant length of your relationship with Mary, to be up all night engaging in sexual intercourse indicates a celebration of sorts and a big one at that.”
“Good you’re awake then” he muttered before leaning back and removing his hand. “You were thrashing about in your sleep and murmuring my name. I thought you may have been having a nightmare.” Sherlock’s heart was pounding hard and he couldn’t distinguish the John in front of him with the angry, nasty John of his dream.
He took a deep breath and opened his eyes to look at John once more. He swept his curls out of his eyes and tugged on the lapels of his coat. If he was going to meet his husband for the first time, he wanted to look the best he could. “You guess correctly.” He confirmed “What’s the last thing you remember?”
John was facing the kitchen counter at Sherlock’s home, waiting for the kettle to boil. He was watching the water as it started to bubble and it felt like the anxiety bubbling in his chest.
The statement stunned them both in to silence and the adrenalin and the fire seemed to seep out of the room, but the tension remained. Sherlock didn’t regret the words, but the conviction in which he had said them was wavering.
“Right, let’s go” John replied. Sherlock was tempted to say he would go on his own, but that would create more problems than it would solve.
This kiss had more passion to it and soon their mouths were opening up to each other, tongues dancing. Sherlock pulled his doctor closer, their bodies coming together. John’s hand had moved up to his neck and was pulling him down to him as close as possible. They were snogging like he had heard people did when they were teenagers. John eventually ended the kiss and pulled him into a tight hug.
But Sherlock interrupted him “Once again it’s ok for you to be shagging half the city, but if I have even the sniff of someone else then it becomes a problem.”
Before the other man could answer, the door banged open to reveal Dectective Inspector Lestrade. Who, upon seeing the scene before him, had begun to speak, but found his mouth moving without any sound coming out. Sherlock found the sight amusing, if not frustrating “Ah Graham, what do we owe this pleasure?”
Once he got to John’s room, he didn’t think, he didn’t breathe – he had one thing on his mind – getting to his husband.
And now the bloody madman had turned it all upside down again and John was still reeling from the shock of it. His hand still ached from the punch he had landed on one of those ridiculously high cheekbones and he was currently sorting out some ice to sooth the pain.
He had been reminded of that last night with the bomb. In that moment he had faced losing Sherlock again, but more significantly losing the second chance he had been taking for granted. Once he saw that Sherlock was laughing, realised that the git had set him up; he was annoyed sure, but he was also relieved.
She had known the detective wasn’t dead, even a fool could have seen that. Apparently John Watson was a fool. She had almost felt a little empathy for him. The men they loved had been lost because of their obsession with each other. ‘Almost’ being the operative word. Nothing would stop her in her vendetta to bring down Sherlock Holmes.
Now all he had to figure out was how he was going to ask him and how he would ever get him to agree.
He had nodded in disbelief and had settled in for the night on the sofa. That had been in the early hours of the morning and he must have fallen asleep.
“I am guessing that you are someone I should know?” the achingly familiar voice broke his thoughts. How he had longed to hear that voice again. Perhaps not those words, but he still closed his eyes in relief and recognition.
John sighed and looked into his coffee, as he processed Greg’s words. “That’s good to know I was happy.....”
“Before he forgave me, I had been.....not me. I had been careful, polite and considerate.” His son let out a bark of laughter in disbelief at this. The detective half smiled, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Once I had his forgiveness however, I felt I could be myself again. So I pushed the envelope a little bit and caused some mayhem at Baker Street......”
John’s eyes came alight in understanding - Sherlock had told him what had happened in the year they had been apart. The year he had been dead. What he had done....what had been done to him. How he had dismantled Moriaty’s network piece by piece.
The detective’s breath was stolen from him at that moment and tears filled his eyes. He wanted to take the pain Finn was feeling away and a hot rush of protectiveness surged through his body. He heard the emotion in John’s voice too as he replied. “Nobody is perfect Finn, Sherlock and I are certainly proof of that, but we love you just way you are now and also who you were then.”
Finn rolled his eyes, but there was a smile creeping on his face. “You are obviously a Slytherin, I don’t know why I needed you to take the test.” The tension in him seemed to deflate and he took a seat at the kitchen table. He sighed and said “But unlike my youthful obsession...” Sherlock looked at him in scrutiny “Ok my ongoing obsession with Harry Potter, today is important. I’m nervous and I want you to like her and I want her to like you and.....” Finn looked up at his Dad then “She’s been through some stuff and you are going to see it the moment she walks in. I don’t want you to stop being you and she knows who you are, so it’s not like she won’t be expecting it......but if you deduce something that you wouldn’t want someone knowing about me without me telling them myself....would you.....would you keep it to yourself?”
Sherlock had started to have doubts that this was still related to the fall and the pain he had caused, John had assured him that wasn’t the case, but the detective felt that that part of their history would haunt them forever. He let out a huge sigh at the thought.
Sherlock giggled and that earned him a death glare. “The last time I saw you like this was when you were trying to explain how important Harry Potter was and you were frustrated that I wouldn’t take the Pottermore test about which house I was in.”
“I remember” John whispered, looking directly at Sherlock and into his soul. “God...I remember”. The shorter man’s face fell forward, on to Sherlock’s chest, as sobs wrecked his body.
She had given it sometime before making her move. She had created a dating profile and had been poised to strike, but her plans had been thwarted when Sherlock had come back far quicker than she had anticipated. Demoralised and furious with herself, she had watched their lives from the side lines, trying to find the perfect way to ruin them. There had been no way her initial plan would have worked with this development and the immediate aftermath of the detective’s return had not been the best time to reconsider her options.
The detective squeezed John a little tighter, he could feel the smile forming on his face. “Never.... I’m more interested in meeting ‘Three Continents Watson’ myself”
John couldn’t hide his smile this time. “You’re right of course, but how did we end up talking about my love life? We are meant to be talking about yours.”
“It was just after the two of you got married and you said the life that you had found yourself in you could never have imagined......but you also said you were happier than you ever thought you would be.”
He coughed and looked at his feet, looking a bit awkward. “Erm....speaking of which...err where d-do we go from here?” He saw John roll his eyes at himself, maybe Three Continents Watson had been in retirement too long.
Molly looked over at him, with a soft look on her face “When did you grow up Finn?” she smiled sweetly and despite being over his crush – she still had the capability to give any man butterflies. She stopped at an unmarked door and squeezed his arm. “They are both so lucky to have you and I hope Sherlock doesn’t shut you out.”
“Oh good let’s tell Mycroft, I love proving him wrong.” Sherlock smiled and John mirrored the expression.
John laughed “Well yes, probably best. How are you? How was your class?” Finn was studying social work, he had expressed to John his passion to help young kids, like him. Despite the little the doctor knew about his son, he knew that it would be a perfect fit for the young man. He was kind, understanding, could get on with anyone and had experience behind his eyes that was beyond his years. Plus he had Sherlock Holmes as a father, so if he can deal with him...
“It will come back Pops” was heard from behind them. Finn smiled, as he brought John’s duffel bag through the living room. Sherlock could tell his son’s smile was forced and that he was finding the situation a lot more difficult than he was projecting.
John moved from his position on the coffee table to perch precariously on the edge of the sofa, next to Sherlock’s knee. “I wish I knew how to play the violin” he said wistfully. Sherlock had a small smile on his face at the reference, he had soothed John’s own nightmares by playing his violin at all hours. It had always gone unspoken between them. The vulgar version of John from his nightmare started to disappear at this. He came up into a sitting position, jostling John slightly.
John enjoyed watching Lestrade, as he stared at him, his mouth agape. “You do like a bit of drama you two don’t you? You couldn’t have just bloody told me?”
“Well your doctor says you should be discharged in the next few days.” Sherlock started, as he stood and moved to look out of the room’s only window. “The most logical thing would be for you to come back to our flat, in the hope that something will jog your memory.” He turned to look back at John. “Despite what’s logical or whether you ever reclaim the memories you lost, you will always be welcome at Baker Street. There are two bedrooms and you don’t have to remember our life together to be a part of it.”
Sherlock was unsure of how long they stood there; John sobbing into his chest, Sherlock’s head resting on top of his husband’s and his hand curled around his neck.
They stayed in this awkward stand off for a while and John started to pace, almost starting to say something, but not knowing how to handle this. He made himself a cup of tea to give himself something to do and gripped the mug in comfort.
John had been living at Baker Street for a few years now and they had been....happy, dare he think it.....content. Being content for the two of them included dead body parts, arguments about when to eat and putting their lives at risk at least once a week. Oh and there was sex, quite a bit of that. Since they had started their romantic relationship things had gone surprisingly well, it was like they were before Sherlock’s fall – just with kissing and shagging thrown into the mix. It was the longest relationship John had ever had (even without the friendship years and really John had been Sherlock’s since the moment they met) and he was in disbelief every day that this was his life. After everything he had been through, he was actually happy and.....content.
At length he broke the silence and turned to face John again “My husband wants to marry someone else. Is that why you are here? To finally file for divorce?”
He had known as time went on that he and John were friends. He had known that John was the most important person in his life and that he cared for him, but as he had never really felt anything like it before, he hadn’t known he was sexually attracted to him until (ironically) Irene Adler had come into their lives. He had stared at her naked body and felt nothing but frustration at not being able to deduce her. She intrigued him and he wanted to solve the puzzle that she was. He had lamented, when he had thought she was dead, at their unfinished business. Yet it was only when he had eavesdropped into her conversation with John on her return from the dead that he realised what he was feeling.
Since Sherlock had turned John’s life upside down for a second time. Although this change hadn’t brought him back to life and brought meaning to it again like the first time ...he had jumped and taken all the meaning and sense out of it.
“God, did you hear anything I just said?” At Sherlock’s blank look, he continued. “I am trying to tell you something delicate here.”
The other man looked shocked and then laughed. “Seems like the old John Watson is still in there somewhere.” He looked over to the corpse and John followed his line of sight. He saw Sherlock had stopped his prancing and was staring directly at the two of them, he seemed frozen. He swallowed and seemed to shake himself, before coming to stand in front of John.
He heard a panicked “John!” break through his mind and Sherlock was in front of him. He searched the now oh so familiar eyes and felt all the emotion of the moment, of all their shared moments....of their life. He grabbed the other man like a lifeline, his fingers found the detective’s forearms and gripped them tightly.
He was waiting for Molly to bring him something she claimed to be ‘very interesting’ and he was bored.
So I always wanted John and Sherlock to talk about the fall and Mary got in the way, so this is my interpretation of how things could have gone.
John stilled at the other man's words and a clear memory filtered into his mind....him and Sherlock in front of a corpse snogging and a noise upstairs interrupting them....but also in Baker Street talking about a case, about someone’s dead daughter?.....Their first case.....the pink suitcase, the pills, the bullet through a window....giggling so much giggling.....not just then, but through the following years....at crime scenes, at the morgue, with Finn, at Mycroft....in bed....
The doctor’s eyes closed at his continued ministrations, but was still able to find his voice “And cut it short for a mad hunt for a serial killer that ended in a gunshot and you almost getting yourself killed.”
Once he had come back, he had resigned himself to a life of unrequited romantic love, but safe in the knowledge that he had John’s love and affection as a friend (and after his roof stunt he was lucky to have that he knew). He was preparing himself for the woman who would finally win John’s heart. He would of course do all he could to thwart her, she wouldn’t be worthy of John if she couldn’t survive that.
Finn was full on crying now “Those words changed my life. Do you remember what happened next?” Finn asked, his eyes hopeful.
“Sherlock, now is not the time for stupid questions, you will not get a rise out of me. You know why I am here.” He replied, keeping his voice low, as his eyes reached Finn’s sleeping form.
She patted him on the arm. "Sometimes it takes someone else to remind us of who we really are.” She replied, as she reached into the bag to bring out a diseased foot.
The resulting dash to escape through the window and chase along the street had led to something she never could have predicted or imagined in her wildest dreams.
“Caring is not an advantage, oh brother mine,” Sherlock mocked, almost hissed, “as you have physical evidence of right before your eyes.”
He turned to John and looked puzzled. “What are you doing? We don’t have time for tea John – there’s a case!” he repeated and threw up his arms in enthusiasm.
“Holmes,” Watson spat, his eyes scrunching closed despite his best attempts to keep his gaze on the detective. The one thing in the world Watson wanted more than what was currently happening was to see Holmes’s smug composure fall apart. “If- if you begin listing synonyms I am a-afraid I might have to subdue and gag you, old boy.”
Colin was mostly delirious, moaning at each press of Watson’s hand and choking on the medicines. Holmes hovered over the doctor, not commenting and not asking questions; merely watching. Watson could see he was tense – he wanted this man to live, and Watson shied to imagine how he might react to Colin’s death.
Holmes was panting, grinning, pressing up slow and deliberate against the doctor with his shirt falling off his shoulders and bunching up around his waist. Watson moved on him like a sinful thought in church, gripping Holmes’s bare shoulders and holding his forearms to the smooth skin of Holmes’s chest, too hot to believe. Watson thought it was frivolous and indecent, but there was something completely beguiling about a well-muscled man.
?” she implored. “What will the other Lords say? Oh, dear, we must send word to our friends at once! Edmund, darling, we must prevent this occurrence from slandering our family name in the future, please do assist me!”
He recalls the brief smile that’d overtaken his face when he’d heard those words from Mary – her blessing, literally, and even though she’d shot the man once John would be lying if he said he wasn’t grateful for the go ahead.
“No...” His voice cut off, unable to continue. “Mycroft wanted to call you, he said ‘I wasn’t capable’. I need to prove him wrong, but....I can’t say it out loud.”
“I don’t know some of his former girlfriends fit that description very well.” The detective joked and sniffled through his tears.
The detective shook his head, feeling a little frustrated with his doctor, is that the only reason he thought Sherlock would do this? “No, of course not. I-“ he didn’t know how to voice this. John stepped closer to him and put his hands on his chest, encouraging him to say whatever he needed to. He looked down into his blue eyes. “John I never expected to.....feel what I feel for you, let alone have the opportunity to explore it. I had always feared love and now it surrounds me every day with you and Finn in my life. I used to watch other people and scorn them for their sentimental expressions and ceremonies surrounding love. Now....I’m jealous of them....and I was in the gutter the other month.” John, who’s eyes had gone a little misty, now rolled them at that comment “and I saw that gay marriage was legal on a thrown away newspaper and I realised that I wanted that with you.”
Finn started to get a bit flustered again, as he went into lots of detail about how Rachel would be getting there. It was strange to see his son so undone, it seemed like he had more than his own romantic life to adjust to....he was about to gain a daughter in law.
Sherlock’s eyes widened almost comically at this. It definitely hadn’t entered his normally brilliant head then. John continued “Or foster at least at first. See how we fit, we could at least give him a safe space and....love, until he finds his forever home. We can make sure it’s somewhere perfect for him, even if that place isn’t with us. I don’t know how safe our lifestyle is for a 10 year old, but we can adapt and maybe.....with some luck and hard work we could be his forever home.”
Sherlock’s body mentally shut down at his words, he could almost feel the colour from his face draining away. He could not process this.
Sherlock was typing furiously on his phone to Lestrade, as the black cab meandered through the London streets. He was aware of John’s presence at his side, it was a welcome change. Things had worked against them recently and his husband had not joined him for a case for a good while. He hadn’t seen much of him at all, as their schedules worked against them.
“It’s not an advantage, as you have physical evidence of right before your eyes,” Mycroft threw back at him “but it is also unavoidable, even for people like you and me. I know that now.”
Frustration was starting to show on Sherlock’s face “What about Irene?” his voice was exasperated “John as I have told you before, a romantic entanglement-“
He had asked Finn if he would meet him here, so they could spend some time together one on one. The boy was living at halls in Uni and most of the time he had spent with him had been with other people, mainly at Baker Street. Things with Sherlock had been difficult...strained....and he wanted to spend some time with his son out of that environment.
His mind was racing – marriage? How had he found himself here? He was just finding his feet and suddenly he was now potentially tied up for life....again? Which brought him to the main reason he couldn’t sleep....
“You’re getting better, a couple of years ago you wouldn’t have even picked up on the fact there was something wrong.” John conceded, taking a sip of his tea.
There was a moment’s pause, where all they could hear was the crunching of their feet and the ambient sounds around them. Finn took a particularly loud slurp from his coffee.
Finn joined him “You don’t need to be strong for me Dad.” He grabbed the hand without the lit cigarette and held it firmly. “I won’t let you fall. We’ll fall together, you’re not alone this time.” Sherlock nodded and put his forehead to his son’s. “What happened Dad?”
“Oh” he eloquently replied. He felt exposed and a little frustrated. How was he meant to interact with someone who had known him for so long, but he had only just met? “What happens next?” that seemed like a reasonable place to start.
He stood and placed a kiss on his cheek, avoiding the bandages on his forehead. “There’s a case John!” he said in mock enthusiasm “Leatrade says it’s a ten, but it’s probably barely a seven. He’s been pestering me to get out of this hospital and leave you and.....I couldn’t.” He could feel that goddamn emotion finding it’s way to the surface. “But then your voice was in my head, telling me that what I was doing was a bit not good, so I’m going to go. I’ll be back soon, not a Sherlock soon, but actually soon. Finn will be here in an hour or so, after Uni and I can tell you all about the case when I’m back. I’ll probably solve it in seconds. Lestrade has become more incompetent in our absence, so I must go.” He leaned down and kissed John’s other cheek and moved to leave.
John sighed “I’ve already been asked this question and my answer hasn’t changed. I am so confused.” He was frustrated and Sherlock could appreciate the feeling. “The last thing I remember is being in Afghanistan and getting shot.”
Sherlock jumped out of bed and grabbed some pajamas . If John couldn’t comfort him, he could comfort John, as he always had – with his violin. It might even help with his memories. After three and a half weeks, they were getting nowhere with John remembering anything about their life, their love, their family and Sherlock was willing to try anything.
Finn shrugged “I don’t know....I know I like her, but I don’t know if it’s love.” His son paused and started to play with his sandwich again. “It’s not what you and Dad have...and I-....I would rather wait the rest of my life for what you and Dad have than settle for something.....less”
Ok so I am posting this next chapter right away, as I have had this written since before I started posting this fic. My sister was proof reading my work and I was doing a lot of the more angsty chapters and she wanted some happiness, so I wrote this, I hope you enjoy. I don't think there are any warnings, but let me know if I have missed anything. Once again this is just for fun.
“Aw, bless their hearts,” Lestrade quips quietly beside her, and Sally cranes her neck to follow his gaze into the backseat. Oh, good Lord. She had thought it was oddly quiet, even with the benefit of Sherlock being unconscious. John has now fallen asleep as well, and his head rests on top of Sherlock’s where it still presses against John’s chest. His arms are still wrapped protectively around him, and now Sherlock’s own wiry arms have come to rest loosely around John’s waist as well, hands burrowing under his coat. There is a perturbed frown on John’s face, as if he’s still worried even in sleep. But both men’s breathing is deep and heavy, and she almost regrets having to wake them.
Greg laughs and makes his way towards the door, calling out a promise to tell the criminals of London to step up their game.
once as the second squad car’s engine starts and follows slowly behind. That leaves only the four of them plus the paramedics on the scene. Lestrade sighs as he comes up beside her, gaze following hers. “So? You gonna tell me?” she asks, curious despite herself.
Sherlock tenses, though, and John regrets asking. His defenses have gone up. “You have nightmares. Some nights worse than others. This helps, does it not?” His voice is succinct, the hint of an edge in his tone.
Surprisingly, after a momentary staring contest with Greg’s coat under which the files are stored (how does he know?), Sherlock huffs dramatically and walks with heavy footfalls back to his chair across from John’s. He falls into it moodily, and Lestrade swears he hears him muttering something about not knowing who “this mysterious
dislike of the pompous sod, but as Lestrade drives them the short distance back to the office, she rests her head back against the seat and thinks begrudgingly that maybe Sherlock Holmes is
When they walk up the stairs to their flat, John hopes that the comfort of home might lift the weight from his shoulders. Instead, it feels almost as if more is being piled on. The whole world seems foreign and distorted, like he’s perceiving everything through funhouse mirrors. Mycroft has finally let them out of his office at nearly two-o'clock in the morning, and as he pauses to hang his coat on its hook, he can tell even Sherlock has been worn thin enough to crack. He walks with his head hanging a little lower than he usually does, his gait slower. He looks defeated and a little aimless, which is a frighteningly discomfiting thought. John catches that his hands are still shaking a bit, clasped together as they are beneath his sculpted chin, and the sudden onset of the dark bags under his eyes stands out starkly in the shadows. The word
Sherlock only continues with the same staring bit, so John wordlessly goes back to his plate, knowing he’ll have to come off of it eventually even if it’s just to ask John to pull the phone out of his shirt pocket.
Sherlock’s mouth gapes open, but before any words can pass his lips, John shoots him a death glare, and Lestrade sends a similar look his way, holding up a finger in warning. The combined effort of them both seems to make Sherlock reconsider his words. He settles for yanking his knees up to his chest petulantly and huffing loudly.
“John…? I’m...I’m fine,” Sherlock slurs. He tries to stand but doesn’t quite manage it, and John sighs in what looks like exasperated relief as he steadies his friend back onto the bed of the ambulance. “Yeah. Yeah, it’s me. And no, you’re not. We need to get you back to Baker Street and out of those wet clothes, Sherlock. Can you stand long enough to catch a cab?”
. All I meant is; I know you want to be stretched out in your own bed instead of being crammed into this sorry excuse for one right now. So why would you sacrifice that just so that I don’t get nightmares?” John gives his profile a knowing look, though he doesn’t look back at him.
“Why’s he all wet, then?” she asks, nudging her chin in John’s direction. Lestrade chuckles, shaking his head. “Madman went in after ‘im. Didn’t even ‘ave to  think about it, just dove right on in and pulled ‘im out.”
Sherlock slowly lifts his head from his shoulder, hair mussed from sleep, and opens his eyes to stare at him inquisitively, probably wondering why John looks as if he's having an actual heart attack beneath him. He looks more adorably confused than John has ever seen him, eyebrows wrinkled and a slight frown marring his face.
Sally Donovan is not a fan of Sherlock Holmes. That much she makes glaringly obvious to anyone that will listen. She is of the justified opinion that the man (if you could call him one) is dangerous, psychotic, and no small degree of arrogant, freakish, and rude to boot. The boss had been bringing him ‘round crime scenes for years now, and though she was loathe to admit it (and wouldn’t out loud), he had most cases solved quicker than she could pour her first cup of coffee. Whether you could call it a good or a bad thing, cases were definitely more interesting with him around, especially now that he had his lap dog/doctor/assistant running along beside him.
With that long expanse of pale neck exposed, John can’t find a reason to deny himself the taste of it. He leans forward and opens his mouth against Sherlock’s hot skin, nipping and sucking languidly at the pulse point. It nearly undoes him when he realizes he can feel Sherlock’s heartbeat hammering, faster than a hummingbird’s wings, under his tongue. His hand still grips Sherlock’s hardened length, stroking unhurriedly. He thinks the hollow of his throat must be one of his sensitive spots, because Sherlock shivers and lets out a soft moan when John’s mouth roams over it. “John…” His arms tighten further around John’s waist, like a warning. “Oh, that’s good.”
Keeping a close eye on Sherlock in case something becomes too much for him to handle, John leans down to lift up the bottom of his t-shirt, dropping lingering little kisses from sternum to hip and back again. The smattering of wiry hair low on his flat belly seems somehow out of place; maybe subconsciously John had thought that every part of Sherlock would be just as clean shaven as he kept his face. Either way, the hair here is a shade lighter than the hair on his head (almost copper) and the mystery of it only serves to make him even more appealing. When he reaches the ‘v’ of Sherlock’s hips, he glances back up for confirmation, and Sherlock nods quickly, breath puffing out his nostrils in spurts of heated excitement. He wants it to be verbal though, wants to hear Sherlock say it.
,” he smooths his thumbs pointedly over his hotly flushed cheeks, and Sherlock’s stiffness begins to ebb.
Even with this aforementioned evidence, Mycroft is somehow still bemused to see Dr. Watson lounging comfortably in the armchair facing away from the doorway, Sherlock pacing near the window with his violin clutched between his chin and his shoulder. The door to 221B is carelessly cracked open, and Mycroft can see just enough to observe the scene before him without being too obvious. They are both still in their pajamas, a steaming cup of tea—Dr. Watson has just made it up—sitting on the cluttered desk, another ensconced between the doctor’s hands. His brother’s eyes are closed and his hair mussed across his forehead, an expression of total absorption etched across his features, lips and eyebrows pulled down in concentration. His bow arm moves effortlessly across the strings in time with the melody he plays, and Mycroft cannot help but think that he looks oddly graceful standing there next to the window as snow falls lightly outside, his too long pajama bottoms brushing against the carpet and his fingers moving with such fond precision over the neck of the violin.
Sherlock continues to stare blankly out the window with his eyes narrowed, and Dr. Watson steps closer with concern. He looks like a cat who’s spotted a bug trapped in the window pane. “Sherlock?” He snaps his fingers close to his flatmate’s face, and sighs exasperatedly. “Right. Are you even in there or have you leapt off to your mind palace again in the middle of a bloody conversation?”
She nods again, and feels the silence descend over the car again. She reaches out to turn the radio on, mindful to keep the volume at a comfortable hum of sound. But there’s nothing except commercials playing on the radio, no traffic to distract her attention, and Lestrade determinedly says nothing more for the rest of the ride, the traitor. Inevitably, her gaze roams back to the mirror again. It’s odd, being in a car for so long with Sherlock and not hearing a peep from him. Without his
“Listen, it’s been all paperwork for me too, it’s not like I’m out gallivanting the city without you,” Greg grumbles, shooting an irritated look back at him. He’s not in the right mindset for Sherlock’s capricious shite tonight. He starts to wonder why he even decided to drop by in the first place.
to “ join the team” so to speak, he would certainly hold no interest in “playing ball” with John even on his best day. John figures he may as well use up this misplaced metaphor for all its worth. He's stubbornly gazing at the floor, broodingly thinking of all the things he could’ve done differently to
, why a reasonably intelligent man like Dr. Watson would willfully choose to waste his time and emotional energy on such a cold-hearted bastard like Sherlock Holmes. Except that now as she approaches the ambulance for a better vantage point, he somehow doesn’t inspire in her the acute sense of detestation which he usually does. John carefully lowers him onto the bed of the ambulance, and Sherlock sways to the side. One of the paramedics quickly covers the man’s shoulders with a shock blanket and holds it there. It’s telling of his current state that the detective doesn’t even protest. Water drips from his bedraggled curls, and it
Before they can antagonize each other any further, Dr. Watson strolls back in the room, pausing and looking back and forth between them with expectantly raised eyebrows. Mycroft’s cup of tea is steaming in his left hand. “Um, I didn’t know how you take your tea, so I just kept it simple. Wasn’t sure if Sherlock’s affinity for copious amounts of sugar was specific to him or if it ran in the family, so…”
The scene isn’t incriminating in any way, but there is still a certain intimacy surrounding the whole thing that throws him off. As Greg looks around the flat, it begins to dawn on him. The telly blaring unashamedly, the soft lighting, the window cracked just enough for the sound of the rain to filter on through—John and Sherlock in the middle of it all cooking a meal together, their respective chairs pushed cozily near each other and waiting expectantly for them in the living room next to the crackling flames lit in the grate. The conclusion Greg comes to is almost startling: this isn’t a typical bachelor pad that he has just barged into—this is a full-fledged
John shakes his head, smiles at her like she’s a little kid who doesn’t know much. It’s condescending, but in a more tolerable way than Sherlock. “Nah, that only applies in severe concussions, not minor ones like this. He should be fine by the morning. Probably have a headache for a few days.”
Sherlock is still silent, eyes narrowed on him, posture impossibly still. John doesn’t think he’s blinked more than once since he walked in. John sighs as he wipes his mouth with a napkin, staring back. “Seriously, Sherlock—you don’t have to feel bad you didn’t catch it. When I met you, it’d been a decade since I’d even looked twice at another man. You couldn’t have known.”
know his first name after so many years, he thinks irritably. The prick had stolen his police ID just the week before—had he not even bothered to read it?! He makes himself stop that train of thought and take a deep breath.
Mere moments after he has noticed his slip up, though, the computer chimes happily with an alert, and a blurb appears on the screen. He squints to read it.
a voice in his head barks sternly, but it lacks conviction. He tosses his hands up and lets them fall back to his side weakly. Tries his best to play it off so maybe Sherlock will leave him to lay awake the rest of the night and pity himself in peace. “Sherlock, it’s just...another nightmare. That's all it was. Not hiding anything, scouts honor.”
I don’t have a concussion. Plus, Sherlock hasn’t slept in three days.” He glares at the now-sleeping man huddled in his arms as if he can hear him. “Exhaustion makes the body more vulnerable to things like this, makes the symptoms come on stronger than they normally would.”
“I really have no idea,” he sighs as he pulls away from the curb. “But if they’re not, they bloody well should be.”
John wonders if maybe Sherlock doesn't need it too—the presence of another person beside him, the reassurance. There is a moment of unsure silence. He isn't used to hesitancy when it comes to Sherlock.
It takes John a moment to respond. “Yeah. Yeah, he um...he hit his head on the way down, got himself a mild concussion. Little touch of hypothermia as well.” At the words, he goes back to rubbing at Sherlock’s arms, but with a lighter touch so as not to wake him. Sally thinks a bomb couldn’t wake the man right now. He looks border-line comatose. A thought occurs to her, and she turns in her seat to look at them.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Captain Watson says in a frighteningly level tone. “Enough. That was inordinately rude, and I know your mother has raised you better. I will not have that kind of petty, childish bullshit said to any guest of mine. I don’t care if he’s your brother, he’s
— and oh God, is John crying again? After a moment of stunned stillness, Sherlock shushes him, rubbing wide, slow circles over his back. John clenches his hands in Sherlock's dressing gown, almost frantically.
This gives John an idea, and without further thought, he lets his teeth scrape the area again (rougher, this time) while simultaneously giving a firm squeeze with the hand down Sherlock’s pants. Sherlock gasps and pushes at his shoulders frustratedly. “John,
He can see that Sherlock's eyes are clearer as well, the tired bags that had been under his eyes last night gone, as well as the tremor in his hands. The resigned defeat that had seemed set into the line of his shoulders is absent now too, replaced back by his usual wild gestures and easy, confident posture.
He hears the bedroom door creak slowly open and he jerks upright, mind surging back into reality immediately. Built-in army trained awareness kicks in and has him reaching blindly for a machine gun that is no longer there. He recognizes the disheveled, lanky silhouette hovering in the doorway and lets out a relieved breath, eyes fixed on him, and urges his heart rate to slow. He must have heard John in the throes of a nightmare and come up to check on him, he realizes distantly.
end up in this shit predicament; so he doesn't realize that Sherlock plans to push past him and crawl into his bed until he's actually already done it, and John is left standing dumbfounded in the doorway.
When the meal is over, Greg finds himself in surprisingly better spirits, smiling as he carries his licked clean dish to the sink. Hell, he’d even seen Sherlock genuinely grinning once or twice over the course of the night, so maybe it was going around. Maybe it was the spag bol.
Sherlock reluctantly moves aside to let him pass and makes his way towards the leather chair facing the one Dr. Watson sat in before. He sits as if lowering himself onto a throne, crosses his legs, and steeples his hands beneath his chin.
A car’s horn honks somewhere to his left, and Mycroft blinks several times in an attempt to clear his mind, safe from scrutinizing eyes in the backseat of the town car as it comes to a stop outside of his destination. He wonders why his mind has decided to betray him with this barrage of thoughts so suddenly (possibly because Mummy has been calling every day for the last week to badger him about coming ‘round for the upcoming holidays and it’s bringing up memories of years passed), but he pushes the dilemma resolutely away and lowers the partition.
“Mycroft, why don’t you take a seat, make yourself comfortable?” He gestures to his chair across from Sherlock’s with a smile, seeing as every other surface formerly known as a sitting area seemed to be covered with books, file boxes, and various other miscellaneous items that could probably all be classified as junk.
John silently observes him awhile longer, eyes trying to fall closed every few minutes. He can feel his own breathing getting heavier, but notices that Sherlock’s isn’t. He still seems unrelaxed if not tense, and though John knows he’s likely just deep in thought, he doesn’t like the small, edgy frown on his face. Can't fall asleep knowing it’s there. He reaches a hand out, tentatively, and grips Sherlock's wrist. His hands are cold. “Thank you,” he whispers, nudging closer and adjusting his grip down to reach the soft slightly warmer skin of Sherlock’s hand. “You do help.”
“Oi!” John calls indignantly in the direction of Sherlock’s room, elbow deep in soapy dish water. “Get your arse back out here and help me with these dishes, you wanker! Oh, and Lestrade, next time I see you, you had better have a case for him. A damn good one, too.”
,” Sherlock says in something close to a whimper, and John automatically feels his body start to respond in turn without his consent, his torso involuntarily twitching up off the bed in a split-second of weakness.
John quickly clears off a section of the cluttered sofa for him, and Greg falls onto the worn cushions gratefully. He blinks when Sherlock is immediately standing over him, hands on his hips. His sleeves are uncharacteristically rolled up to his elbows for the purpose of working in the kitchen. “Well?” he exclaims irritably, a hand detaching from his hip to flail in the air next to him. “Do you have a case for me, or are you just here to waste my valuable time?”
This is one of those rare moments where John desperately wishes he were artistic enough to capture the image of him on canvas and keep it forever, because going by the overwhelmed look on his face, the distance he’s created between them on the bed—Sherlock is drawing a line, and John vows to himself right now to respect it, whatever it is. After all, this whole thing is his fault: letting Sherlock into his bed when John knew that his own hidden desires were likely to become an issue sooner rather than later. He's been found out. He’s been found out, Sherlock doesn’t feel the same (of course he doesn’t), and it’s over. He’s been anticipating it for awhile now, because Sherlock is just too insanely intelligent to never catch it; John is actually surprised he’s gotten away away with it this long.
As for the spag bol, Greg doesn’t think he’s ever devoured a bowl of it so quickly. It’s the perfect combination of savory sauce, spice, and decadent pasta. He asks after the recipe, and John tells him that it was his grandmum’s, passed down through generations. He goes on to explain the concerning level of madness Sherlock had reached after so long without a proper case, and how John had thought it the perfect distraction to teach him one of the few things he didn’t know how to do, which was cook anything (food-wise) that didn’t require a microwave. When he freely admits to having had the urge to push Sherlock out of the living room window earlier in the day, Sherlock takes a break from eating to stick his tongue out at him. Greg chuckles bemusedly at them, and tries not to gape too openly at Sherlock’s empty bowl once he’s finished it. He doesn’t think he has ever seen Sherlock eat that much at once. Or eat that much in a week, come to think of it.
There is a slight ‘ah’ sound of understanding that comes from Sherlock, and John can feel the vibrations of his voice rumbling deep in his chest from this position. He never could have imagined how oddly comforting the sensation is. “Afghanistan, then?”
, John thinks, and maneuvers them so Sherlock’s back faces the headboard, then eases him down onto the pillows and hovers over him. Sherlock stares up at him wide-eyed and mouth gaping open, unused to this side of John. With a smirk, he leans down to breathe in his ear, “Now let’s see if you can say it like you mean it.” Sherlock sucks in a rapid breath and bites down on his bottom lip, doesn’t take his half-lidded eyes off of him as he starts to make his way down Sherlock’s body.
“Jesus, mate, you look knackered,” John says. Greg rubs his forehead, hoping he doesn’t look as semi-conscious as he feels. He hasn’t had a moment to pause all day, but now that he has he feels like he could collapse right here on their carpet and have a kip.
Sherlock had been fucking with him on the name thing, but the twin sets of uncontrollable laughter coming from their flat only confirms it as Greg trots down the steps. He wants to be miffed about it, but he can’t help the smile that comes to his face.
He shakes Sherlock awake, or at least as awake as he’s going to get, and politely declines Lestrade’s offer to help him get the incoherent man upstairs with a tense smile. Seeming more like himself, Sherlock grumbles something about having a headache and being cold, and still mainly refuses to part from John’s warmth as he drags them both out of the car. John scoffs irritably.
“John?” he asks dubiously, and John doesn’t immediately answer, trying to reel himself out of his admiriational  reverie. Sherlock’s eyes steel themselves and break contact remarkably fast, and he begins to sit up, moving his arms unconsciously to cover his body. John snaps to then, and hastily lowers Sherlock’s arms back to his side, bringing his face closer to his. He blinks at the proximity, but makes no attempts to break away, letting himself be held in place. The fluttering pulse in Sherlock’s wrist and the mussed curls spread out over the pillow threaten to divert his attention again, but he forces himself to look only at Sherlock’s eyes and nothing else; which isn’t much better, honestly.
He had remembered he had a husband, a family. He had been overwhelmed, with thoughts, emotions.....memories. He hadn't known how to process any of it. He had felt a headache coming along, before he had fallen asleep in his chair.
The thing was that the kid adored Sherlock. Well at least that was something they had in common, he guessed. He was going to pale in comparison, what child would be interested in him when they had Sherlock Holmes? He stared down at his jumper....maybe he should change, maybe being himself wasn’t a good idea after all.
The detective pulled away and rested their foreheads together, his hand still cupping John’s cheek. “We will get it right because we love each other.” He confirmed “All three of us.”
Sherlock followed through the front door, down the stairs and gave chase along the street outside, he shouted at Lestrade as he ran past “Back up!!”
Things came to a head when they were scouring the streets of London in search of the potential murderer. John had pulled him into a side alley and gave him a death stare.
“You were reluctant to talk and I didn’t want to force you, but I wanted to know why you couldn’t tell me. I was hoping we could work on you opening up to us and try to break down the barriers between us. But your next words broke my heart and I felt so helpless. You said ‘If I tell you, you won’t like what I did and then you won’t love me anymore. So I am not going to tell you, because I want to be who I am now, not who I was then.’
“John is still here. He’s just an older version. He liked you then for the person you are. Even if you can’t dazzle him with your deductions, doesn’t mean he won’t still like the real you. Maybe your not getting anywhere with him, because you are not being the man he fell in love with.”
Sherlock half smiled and looked away “I’m trying to balance not scaring you off, whilst trying to prepare you the best way I can for the reality of things. You must know that I will do everything I can to make this as easy as it possibly can be for you. I don’t want you to feel any pressure to be something you don’t feel comfortable with. If that means you don’t stay with me at 221B or never see me again-“
“We are not anybody else John, we are you and me – we can just do whatever the hell we want. We already know what we are in for with each other, most people would take this long to accept your taste in jumpers.” he joked, which earned him a frown. “We know the very worst and the very best of each other.”
He rushed passed a nurse and almost pushed him to the ground. He ignored the subsequent shouts of angry annoyance that followed. He noticed that people kept out of his way after that.
The shorter man didn’t seem to have registered what the detective had said. “But you are married to your work.”
Finn nodded and seemed to accept this. He looked to the floor and back at the doctor, the boy seemed to be coming out of his shell and his protective Sherlock bubble. “For how long?” he finally asked.
He had never in his wildest dreams imagined that it would be him who would win the doctor’s heart or that in fact he had won it a long time ago.
He was no longer ignorant of love and he didn’t want to be ignorant of marriage any longer. He was a possessive and demanding person and he wanted John to belong to him. He wanted Finn to have married parents, to have that extra security that they weren’t going away. Sherlock wanted that security. He wanted to grow old with John and share the rest of their lives together. He had wanted that for a long time and now they had the option to make it official. He could hear Mycroft’s voice scoffing in his head at the notion, but he also envisioned John’s soft, encouraging smile, at the thought. And as always John won out.
Sherlock was found by Finn eventually. He found himself staring at a shelf full of toilet rolls, when the sound of a lock being picked broke his thoughts. How long had he been sat here? He had been in his mind palace trying to lose himself in the wing called ‘John’.
“Why?” the dark haired man asked, exasperated. “We both acknowledge it was an intense situation and I snapped.  It’s not like this has been easy. You know enough of me to know that I’m not perfect.”
Sherlock smiled faintly and handed him a steaming mug of tea, before joining John on the couch with his own cup.
Since that fateful day when they had declared their love for each other, Sherlock had explored himself and John thoroughly and he had enjoyed it immensely. Surprisingly their intimate relations had yet to get boring, although they had simmered a little from their first year or so together.
Mary had been very excited by his response and they had spent the next few hours ‘celebrating’. She had fallen asleep not long after and left John to contemplate what had just happened.
“And I want you to put these tags on and tell me to do whatever you want me to.” The gorgeous man finished.
“You’re dead!” he repeated more enthusiastically. “I watched you jump from a roof and bleed out on the pavement and now your sitting here in ‘your’ chair in bloody Baker Street...and you’re dead.”
He put a second handful of ice in a tea towel and walked over from where he was in the kitchen into the once familiar living room. He handed the second ice pack to the sullen looking man, who was currently sat there, back in ‘his’ chair.
Finn’s eyes started to water and John could tell this was real, he didn’t make this up. He grabbed Finn’s free hand and wiped the tears that started to slowly fall down his son’s cheeks. “I told you-“ John’s voice faltered “I told you that nobody was perfect, but we love you just the way you are now and who you were then.”
Their lips moved together with a soft sound and Watson kept adjusting his grip, losing his hand up to the wrist in inky curls, and his mouth was numb already and it was bloody brilliant, champagne and medicine and a bright flare like he had gambled absolutely everything and gained twice as much back against all the odds on this earth. The detective shifted and the line of movement ran along both of their bodies in an arresting roll.
“You had to have noticed, old boy, it’s almost a physical aroma, a tangible sense in the air. Someone on this estate is in grief, true grief, hurting like their own heart has been skewered.” He met Watson’s eyes briefly before running a finger down the length of the hearth. “So convenience, yes, because as well as grief there is a genuine odour of cheap medicine, amateur remedies that will not work and thus have been accepted out of desperation. We are looking for someone nearly stripped of all money and whose lover or family member is gravely ill.”
Her gaze widened and her chin began trembling, something which she visibly fought. Watson thought to give her a sedative and demand several days without work from her superiors.
Holmes waited, ever theatrical, until Watson sighed and rolled onto his back, propped himself up on one elbow. Holmes’s black eyes were a shock better than coffee, awoke Watson just like gunshots or opium or other dangerous things would. “Yes?”
John breathes a sigh of relief as he nestles Rosie into her blankets. Though her eyes are closed and her face is slack, a small hand comes up and curls weakly around John’s collar just as he attempts pulling away and he freezes, desperate not to wake her.
,” Holmes breathed, sucking at ragged slices of breath already as the doctor moved onto the skin of his throat. “I was beginning to think –
“Wealth, power, fame…” Holmes shrugged, sipped the last of the brandy from his glass. “You appear as though none of it even remotely concerns you.” He placed the cup onto the side table with delicate fingers, sounding a dull
Watson tried for words of his own and found none, absolutely devastated, holding onto the man beneath him as though he would die if he did not. Their hips locked together, brazen and the sharp side of perfect, and Holmes’s breath stuttered.
They walked home to 221B Baker Street, a risk to which Watson would have ordinarily protested, but he had saved a man’s life tonight and Holmes’s arm was looped through his and quite frankly, Watson felt like he could have taken on anything.
Sherlock’s standing in the doorway of John’s kitchen, Rosie hitched on his right side with one hand supporting her. She has a fist curled happily in his hair. Her chubby face glows when she sees John and she releases Sherlock’s hair at once, pats his cheek a couple times as a fairly obvious indicator of what she wants before releasing a series of gurgles. Sherlock makes a fond expression not dissimilar to Rosie’s when he glances from her giggling face to where John stands at the bench.
“Inappropriate,” Watson breathed, laughing and kissing him again. His legs sunk into the settee as Holmes flattened one hand to the small of his back and pulled him closer. “You are always so inappropriate, Holmes, you’re
There was a beat of stillness in which Watson felt what he would have medically described as a chasm in his chest, and then Holmes pushed back into him and grinned sharply against his mouth.
Finally, in what must have been the early hours of the morning, Colin’s breathing smoothed out and no longer rattled desperately, and Mrs Andrews retired, faint and somewhat dehydrated from her tears. Watson guided her to her chambers, as she seemed wont to collapse, and then whispered to Holmes.
He retracted himself from the wall after a moment and wandered over, seeming at once massively bored and highly disdainful. His suit was incredibly crisp, as black and white as his wife’s gown was red and purple. Watson wondered if they even liked each other.
.” Another searing kiss, absolutely gorgeous in its every fumble and pull. “’Tis as plain and simple as the ignorance of Scotland Yard.”
There was a mother and a father and extras, and there was a missing child. Stolen, vanished, and Holmes’s skin was already humming with the chase.
Watson’s mouth suddenly felt full of ash. “That’s,” he uttered, and then paused, collecting himself. “Will I be able to help? The ill, I mean?”
Holmes downed his share, and in the moment of distraction Watson tipped his glassful into Holmes’s wounds.
Watson awoke to dull morning sunlight and Holmes’s arm slung over his side, drawing him into an extremely warm embrace. He took one deep breath, fiercely happy, and somehow Holmes knew he was awake.
to scrounge a nightly companion from this oh so prestigious profession of yours. Therein lays much motivation, one could say, but apparently not enough for my good doctor.”
“We are deeply sorry for your many grievances, my Lady,” he said lowly, and she psh’ed him with a wave of her handkerchief.
“’Tis too early and too hopeful for humour so black, my friend,” Watson said not unkindly, and Holmes spared him an amused glance with weighted eyes, smirk bending his mouth. The expression scraped the inside of Watson’s stomach and he shifted calmly, tugging on the edges of his coat.
“Merely my profession,” he said. He switched hands with Holmes, began cleaning the other. These cuts were worse. “Nothing in which to revel but medical science, Holmes.”
Holmes didn’t even object when, once safely in their apartment, Watson made him strip off his coat so the doctor could clean and possibly bandage his grazes. The detective perched on the edge of the settee and poured two small glasses of alcohol, grinning in a very small way to himself.
Holmes had been nodding diligently this whole time and Watson knew only he could see the thinly veiled disgust beneath his earnest expression. He supposed he appeared much the same. Nonetheless Watson knew the expectations, and he looked away from Holmes so that he might keep his head about him.
Watson griped into his pillow, cotton against his teeth. He was uncomfortable with being lit up and so keenly observed while his companion was in the shadows, ever shrouded with darkness. “More pressingly, Holmes; who are
Holmes grinned merrily, his knuckles like a brand on Watson’s ribs. “We shall pour the good lad a drink.”
She stood with many a metal jangle and reached a hand toward them both, which they kissed after a beat. She shook herself. “I hope I have been useful, gentlemen, and I thank you for embracing this case. Now, I must depart for I have many messages to send, but do feel free to inspect whatever necessary and interrogate whomever you deem fit.” Her expression was one of faint contempt, clearly convinced that she and her husband were the only ones worth speaking with in the entire mansion.
“Antiseptic,” Watson said before Holmes could complain, and then he produced a cloth from his medical kit and began wiping away the dirt from Holmes’s injuries. He held one of Holmes’s hands in both of his, the detective’s fingers warm and calloused harshly. Watson swallowed.
It’s late, so Rosie takes the pacifier without complaint and soon enough she’s dozing in John’s arms, head lolling on his shoulder. Sherlock’s watching her with rapt attention even though she’s merely doing perfectly ordinary infant things, drooling and gurgling and grasping with her tiny hands as John gently lowers her into her crib. He thinks proudly, of course his daughter would be one of the things in this world to utterly bewitch Sherlock Holmes.
A composed maid entered the vast room and her footfalls echoed as she delivered a tray of triangular-cut sandwiches and biscuits. The Lady shooed her away without much thought.
“I’m okay, Sherlock,” he says, before Sherlock can ask. He picks up Rosie’s pacifier from the dinner table and starts suggesting it to her, gentle nudges toward her happy face and slow-blinking eyes.
“John,” Sherlock says quietly, so quietly John feels the timbre of his voice more than he even hears it. “Just because she said in her video, just because Mary acknowledged– I don’t want you to feel-”
Watson breathed out and shut his eyes, fighting off another indecent grin. “Well. Shall we go talk to her?”
“You’ll forgive the oversight of my wife, I’m sure; she’s suffering from one too many blows at the moment.” His grey eyes rested on Watson, and his mouth twitched in a smile. “You’re a medical man, good sir; I do believe she’s in shock, yes?”
“Is he-” Holmes swallowed, the stony set of his expression betrayed in the intensity of his eyes. “He is recovering, yes? He is taking to the tonics?”
. The doctor dragged a heavy hand down the centre of Holmes’s bare chest, chasing the hard lines and angles that were the results of constant activity, wishing to feel them beneath his tongue.
“You called me stupid,” Watson said, everything about him simply reverberating happiness, despite his words. Holmes smirked but the expression barely covered his own giddiness.
“Incentive?” Watson murmured, glancing down before his eyes were inescapably drawn upward again. The detective painted a sharp contrast in the muted yellow light, shock of black hair and black slacks and black eyes pressed against skin and shirt the colour of the moon. Watson thought that if Holmes was near him, he needn’t ever look to the sky.
Mrs Andrews was retrieving more ingredients when Holmes returned from reburying the girl’s bones in a scraped out grave near her original tomb, and his forearms were black with soot and dirt where he’d pushed his white sleeves into bunches at the elbow. Watson was having a disconcertingly difficult time paying attention to the sick man in front of him.
It was ill-mannered and uncouth, he knew; a child’s life may be at stake, or a mother’s sanity, but suffering momentary lapse in all of his civil practices was a strange phenomenon that sometimes occurred around Holmes. These sorts of things, Watson had decided some period ago, were writ in blood, simply waiting for a catalyst to spur them to life; cats made the good doctor sneeze, and Sherlock Holmes, on occasion, disarmed his every instinct and struck him utterly dumb.
Sherlock’s fingers touch John’s cheek lightly and they both let out a sharp breath, John’s eyes darting up instantly. Sherlock looks shocked and absolutely lovely, softly touching John’s face and his head angled down, curls falling over his forehead.
Sherlock presses a finger up against the window accusingly, sneering. “Mycroft’s town car has been sitting at the curb for at least the last one minute and thirty-two seconds, and yet he hasn’t climbed his
John tries to backtrack, but his words are rushed, and he stutters over his own tongue trying to cast reassurances. “No, Sherlock. I mean—
“Yes, yes, already on it,” Sherlock interrupts, and the obnoxious volume of the television is lowered to an understated murmur of background noise.
“You really think so,” he says, and though it seems like it should be a question, he says it with a kind of mystified certainty. The pompous inflection which usually accompanies his voice when speaking of himself is absent. His whole countenance is changed, and instead of seeing his insolent, boisterous,
, right there, means that Sherlock has decided to let down his defenses, called for the sentinels standing guard outside his mind palace to hold their fire. A gentle rumble of a chuckle that John adores slips from Sherlock’s lips before he sobers himself and lets out an unweighted sigh.
out yet. Which can only mean—” Mycroft knows he is about to be caught out. Sherlock is going to turn around any second, march to the door, and throw it open. He must act quickly if he’s going to save any shred of his dignity.
Looking almost awe-struck, Sherlock sits up and is now kneeling on top of the covers, leaning back on his shins and taking in a deep breath. He rests his unclenched hands on his thighs, most likely having already deduced what had just happened. John thinks he is ethereally beautiful in this moment—he's always thought Sherlock was unconventionally attractive, but sometimes there were moments like this where his best features stood out in such a way that made him look almost supernaturally stunning. He can’t tear his eyes away from the sight of him kneeling there with the moonlight coming in through the window accentuating the cut of his cheekbones and making his eyes reflect lumminesently back at him.
“What is it?” he whispers, ducking his neck to look at him in the eyes. A stray black curl tickles John's forehead.
the ones where she asks him if he’s gay), but he hardly feels like he can do that now. Pain in his arse she may be, but she is still his sister. John sighs, counts to ten in his head. Takes another deep breath, then sets his fingers to the keyboard to type out one simple request. This isn't the type of thing they can discuss on the comments section of his blog, after all.
John is barely listening though. There is an increasingly auspicious buoyancy building up in him as the seconds pass. He has the distinct impression that he must look like the world’s stupidest goldfish, gaping at Sherlock like he is. “You really mean it, don’t you? You
Mycroft had initially come by to cajole Sherlock into taking a high-security case which he himself had no time to deal with—or rather, he would give the case file to Dr. Watson and let him do the cajoling, at which Mycroft would inevitably fail. He had not had many explicit opportunities thus far to observe the personal interactions of his brother and his new flatmate, but he had noticed rather quickly that Dr. Watson seems to hold the rare power to sway Sherlock’s inclinations one way or the other, which confounds him to no end.  He tucks the case file in his hand into the inside pocket of his coat and quickly alters his plan of approach, an unaccountable curiosity suddenly raging in him. The case and the obligatory brotherly bickering will just have to wait for a moment.
But, before John can even attempt to extricate himself, Sherlock unconsciously shifts, his thigh inadvertently rubbing against John's lap as he gets more comfortable. John's whole body jerks, and he gasps with a mixture of helpless pleasure and discomfort. Squeezing his eyes shut and trying to think of something else—
When he finishes explaining the details of the case and holds the file out to Sherlock, he predictably doesn’t take it. Instead, he turns his head to the side with a scoff and crosses his arms over his chest. So, John Watson is almost immediately forgiven for veritably spanking him, but Mycroft will apparently have to wait as long as anybody else for Sherlock to even look at him.
“Sherlock?” It's a whisper, hoarse and ragged, but still it sounds too loud in the empty silence of the living room. There is always some kind of noise at Baker Street even on nights like this; whether it be the sound of scant late night traffic on the street below, or the warbling song of a purposefully off-tune violin, or even the distant vibrations of Mrs. Hudson shifting around in the apartment downstairs. Tonight, the flat is filled with a desolate stillness that sends chills shivering down John’s spine at the sheer
Greg looks around, is again reminded of how painfully, nostalgically homey the flat is. He wonders if either of them even realize the impression given off by the atmosphere of the place—that it belongs solely to John and to Sherlock and nobody else. They might as well have posted a sign outside the door barring anyone else’s entrance—like little kids hanging a
And oh, yes, John agrees with the dangerous part without doubt, but in way that’s completely different from the way people like Sally mean it. Sherlock is just the kind of dangerous that John needs.
“Do you want me to?” his baritone whispers, and though it's still just as unaffected and cool as it always is, there's something lacking, something tentative in his question.
John rolls his eyes in a distinctly Sherlockian manner, which Lestrade notes with a raised eyebrow. “Don’t be daft, Greg, you’re always welcome. And anyway, we made
Ah, Hudders. Everyone loves a good Hudders POV. Hope you enjoy, and once again, thanks for the love!
bed, not yours.” John smiles a bit maniacally, wondering if this is yet another dream. If Sherlock will disappear at any moment, never having been there in the first place. He stuffs a hand into the pocket of his sweats, suddenly nervous.
There is silence for all of five seconds, before they glance at each other and begin laughing in unison. Dr. Watson flops into his chair with a sigh and rests his head on his fist. “So, do you want to watch something on the telly, or do you want to play me another song, hmm?” Sherlock’s face turns red and he reaches for the remote control, turning the television on. The doctor grins mischievously when Sherlock refuses to make eye contact.
Thank you guys for the love! I hope you enjoy this next chapter just as much. And yes, the name "Caffrey" is a reference to White Collar lol.
Sherlock gives him a brief rictus grin, uncrossing his legs to lean forward over his knees. “We both know that I rarely
Sherlock doesn't actually answer, only readjusts his pillow and gets more comfortable. He takes an audibly deep breath, and when it comes out in an exhale his shoulders are relaxed, finally. Decision made, then.
John nods exaggeratedly, giving him a distinctly sneaky look. “Oh, yeah. Homemade sauce and all. Be quite a shame tomorrow when Sherlock bins all those leftovers to make room for his experiments…Oh, well. Nothing to be done for it.”
With the first insistent pull of Sherlock’s long arm around his waist, he feels inclined to let his shaking muscles go limp and collapse into a puddle of pure need on his sheets.
“It really was just a dream, Sherlock. M'fine.” He massages two fingers over the bridge of his nose and doesn’t look Sherlock in the eyes. God, he feels pathetic. He can't believe he had just run into his flatmate's arms, bawling about a bad dream like a child. His face is so hot he thinks it might just melt right off. Even so, what's left of his injured masculine pride is the only thing that stops him from pulling Sherlock back into his arms and holding on for dear life. That and the fact that he might possibly never let go. Despite what everyone may think, John knows himself well; makes it a point to keep just the necessary amount of emotional and physical distance between himself and Sherlock, and for a damn good reason. John knows with certainty what it is that he wants. He just knows that he can’t have it.
“Great,” Dr. Watson says. “Tea?” he directs this towards Mycroft, who merely inclines his head with a wan smile of gratitude in response. Once the doctor has disappeared into the kitchen, he makes a move to sit in the seat across from his brother.
other than the frenetic detective currently using him as a body pillow—John begs his body to stop its immature and randy behavior without requiring the necessity of a cold shower. He takes steady, carefully timed breaths, hands fisted at his sides in concentration, biting down so hard on his lip that it nearly bleeds. After a few minutes, he convinces himself that it's working. Yes, he thinks it might be. That is, until:
Goddamn the man. He wasn’t particularly looking forward to another vending machine sandwich for his dinner tonight, but now he can’t reject the offer of a home-cooked meal and still feel morally sound. That, and the smell wafting from the kitchen is downright heavenly and he’d be an idiot not to stick around for a serving.
, Mycroft thinks somewhat wryly, and continues on towards the door to 221. Sherlock had played better at eight years old, though he’d never have let on.
Sherlock nods unsteadily, eyes half-lidded. Oh, dammit. With a reluctant sigh, Sally steps forward and makes her presence known by clearing her throat. “D’ya need a lift? The boss won’t mind if you do.”
With the first gasp of Sherlock’s breath against his mouth, John feels thrilled all the way down to his bones.
He must stay gazing at it a moment too long, because Sherlock’s fingers reach down to tug impatiently in his hair. “John, get on with it,” he whines,  panting with the anticipation. “
want to?” John whispers back, gracelessly avoiding answering. He feels ostensibly like a secondary schooler too afraid to reach out and hold their date’s hand for fear of soul-crushing rejection.
“Goodnight, John,” Sherlock reaches out to flick the lamp off, and after only a few moments, John’s body seems to cave in on itself in exhaustion once again. Without trying to, he falls back to sleep easily with Sherlock's cozy warmth at his back. Despite everything, there are no more nightmares that evening.
Even through the dark, John can see Sherlock roll his eyes, but his tone isn’t as harsh as it usually is accompanying that expression. “Obvious, John. I'm going to bed.”
“Oh, John,” Sherlock murmurs again, and a covert glance reveals that he's still deeply asleep; immersed in the REM cycle through and through, eyes moving rapidly beneath his lids. His eyebrows silently arch as he contemplates his sleeping flatmate, and John wonders with a certain level of keen eagerness now, what Sherlock regularly dreams about in the bedroom just below his. He’s never really wondered one way or another in the past about anyone’s dreams, hasn’t cared, but with the sound of his own name coming out of Sherlock’s mouth like
