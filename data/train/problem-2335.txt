Sherlock gave John a small smile and climbed in the bed with him. Sherlock reached up and wiped away the tears that John missed on his cheek, and John fought every urge to kiss him and make love to him right there.
His boyfriend looked at him, his lips drawn into a great pout.
“Holmes?”
‘Jesus, Sherlock, cancer out of all things…’ He started, ‘I mean…what can I say? Get well soon doesn’t seem like the right thing to tell you.’
“How long have you had that?” Shock and amusement laced Sherlock’s voice. John didn’t answer immediately. He grabbed the bottle and two glasses and took his seat.
“Sherlock. You know, before I met you, I…I told myself every day that I didn’t like men. I only loved women because that’s who men were supposed to love. My father, the bastard, when he found out that Harry had a girlfriend, he all but disowned her. My mum…she tried to protect us, but my dad was a terrifying man when he drank. Whenever he hurt Harriet, spewed hate towards her, I was telling myself to never let him see that I liked men too. I like both men and women. For years…” John’s breath hitched as the tears pooled in his eyes, “For years, every time I saw a bloke I liked, I told myself that I wasn’t gay, that I didn’t like men and the...hatred I felt for myself was unbearable.
Also, feel free to check out my other work, I just finished my other Sherlock fic Vitruvian! Thank you all for reading! (I'm going to start naming these chapters so yeah)
“Yes, I remember.” The conversation trailed off for a bit before John asked, “Why?”
John’s smile quivered at the statement. And Sherlock let one more tear slide down because he couldn’t hold it in anymore.
“Watson? Is everything alright?”
"He will make you feel wonderful about yourself. He'll call you amazing, fantastic, brilliant, and all of the other wonderful words. You won't hate yourself so much when you're with him. And you'll want nothing more than him."
John shook his head. He knew that he was going to try to convince him to stay home again, it was a miracle that he was still employed at the clinic.
"Yeah, good ole' doctor Watson..."
~~~~~~~
Mycroft looked away and exhaled. He actually looked distraught, John could scarcely believe it.
'You're my Sherlock, you understand?' I wanted to make sure that we came to the same understanding. Through sickness and health, remember Sherlock?
“EVERYBODY, CLOSE YOUR EYES!” The Doctor screamed over Moriarty’s panicked cries.
I had to let that all sink in for a minute. That was practically an admission of fear, Sherlock, do you see? You stood there in that paper-thin hospital gown and told me that you were scared. You didn’t want to die. I had to take you in my arms and I had to kiss you everywhere. On your cheeks, on your chest, on your neck, your hands, I had to comfort you, and to reassure that you were going to be fine. You were always fine.
I looked at you expecting an answer, and I got one. You couldn’t even look me in the eye. I couldn’t blame you.
Watson’s lip quivered at the statement. He took in a shaky breath.
The day after, when I got back from my shift, Sally sent me another message saying, “Thank him for me :)”, and then she sent a picture of her new beige coat that looked well over £100, with some Louis Vuitton heels. Sherlock came back as soon as I was typing a response. He shot me a smug look and then waltzed into his room. I typed back, “I think he knows already.”
I think I wanted to enjoy the moment. I dropped the conversation and kept you in my arms as we awaited the arrival of our baby. Of our Kylie. And from your silence, you wanted the same thing.
“Ah. That is unfortunate. I’m sorry.”
“Love! Jesus, I want to take you out, okay? I want to spoil you, and treat you like a proper boyfriend. Please let me do this for you?”
He dodged the question entirely.
Sherlock smiled at his reflection in the clear mirror. The sunlight shone through the sheer curtains, giving him a beautiful and shimmering glow. His eyes seemed brighter, they couldn't decide on a color so he was forced to walk around with blue-green eyes for the day. He didn't mind one bit. His hair seemed to be shades lighter than usual. It was browner, and didn't look as black as everyone thought it was. He added a few more curls, just for the hell of it. John loved his curly hair, so that meant that Sherlock loved his curly hair. But as he was making the final adjustments, he let his mind wander to the events that took place before.
Sherlock nodded. Holmes ran a hand through his black hair.
Sherlock tilted his head as he thought about the proposal. “Well, I suppose I could take the sofa.”
John sighed. “Sherlock, you know that I can’t make a habit out of this…”
Her smile was sheepish.
John decided to change the conversation.
“But John Watson isn’t everybody, I know this now. He isn’t a face I can forget, he doesn’t pass by in a crowd. He doesn’t bore me like other people do; I’m interested in what he has to say believe it or not. But that day in Barts, when Mike—“
John's eyes hurt, and he needs to get home. He finishes off his drink and then looks up at the bartender again. It's Sherlock. He doesn't look very happy with John. John nearly falls off his stool. Greg moves to catch him, but then relaxes when he sees that John was in no immediate danger. Sherlock takes John's glass and throws it into the sink to be cleaned later.
“And Watson hasn’t confiscated it yet? John took mine, he and Mrs. Hudson agreed that it isn’t “safe” and it could contaminate the food around it as well. I beg to differ, but you know they always have to be on the safe side.”
He focused on the paper again and started over.
‘I’ve also been wanting to thank you. I wanted to thank you for befriending me, and for loving me when nobody else did. Thank you for solving all of those cases with me, thank you for putting up with all of my terrible habits as a flatmate. Thank you for the company you have provided me after years of solitude, thank you for listening to me when I play my violin. Thank you for defending me, even if that put you at risk too.’
“I might fall asleep too.” His voice got small and apprehensive, like he expected John to get upset.
He looked over at me and gave me a dismissive nod before walking out of the flat. I thought I heard you whisper something like 'Prat' under your breath.
"I'm...I'm sorry, papa. I was scared and...and...what are you going to do, uncle?"
Sherlock just groaned.
“John Watson, you are, brave, kind, loyal…handsome, quite handsome, very handsome, if I might add. You have seen war, and all the horrors that come with it, but yet, you don’t let it overtake your life, you find a way to fight it and I admire you so much for that. You surprise me, actually. Never would I have thought that I would ever find somebody who could tolerate me for as long as you have, let alone want to marry me. You are something special, John.”
"Don't look now, John, but I think those ladies fancy you."
“So that means that none of us here has any clue as to where Holmes or Sherlock is. This is just great; this is what I look forward to.”
I shook my head and told him that the small box was for me, it was a watch. The other box was for him and he looked honestly shocked.
‘I’m sorry Harry, it’s just Sherlock isn’t helping with the baby, he hasn’t even held her yet, he won’t feed her…’
“The people who ask that question are the ones who lose.”
'Well it was always in the back of my mind, but I never dwelt too long on it. It wasn’t until I saw you staring at every single child we walked past in the park today.’
John nearly dropped the plate he was holding. “What?”
“No, we’re not going to pretend it didn’t happen. What we’re going to do, what I’m going to do, is gave you some space and wait for you to tell me what happened. Same as you do for me.”
‘John.’ You said genially.
John woke up the next morning in his bed with tearstains running down his cheek and Kylie’s stuffed animal half draped across the bed.
Sherlock nodded and then pointed towards the room.
John grabbed Sherlock’s face and brought him into a crushing kiss. He sighed loudly at finally being able to kiss him again, to be able to show his utter love and devotion to the man by something as simple yet passionate as this. Sherlock closed his eyes, and John could taste the saltiness of Sherlock’s tears as they ran down his face and into their mouths. His chest heaved against John’s and he placed his hands on John’s waist to steady himself from the surprise. John pulled away from him, out of breath but never looking away from Sherlock’s gorgeous eyes.
“You told me, back at hospital that you didn’t want anybody to see you in that state because that’s not how you wanted them to remember you. You also told me that you had faith in the way I remember you and I’ve decided to tell you. Those last few months, I won’t remember you like that. I’ll always remember you as the brilliant consulting detective who could solve cases in minutes, the flatmate who had the worst living habits, the best friend I’ve ever had…the sexiest man I’ve ever met…my saving grace…my…my husband Sherlock Holmes-Watson. That’s all you’ll ever be to me, Sherlock.”
John's worn eyes flickered over to the Doctor's.
“Quite on the mark. Keep going.”
She let out a sigh and watched  the rest of the movie in silence. She made it through Peter Pan and Dr. No. She liked the Bond movies, she only made it to Live and Let Die before she fell asleep entirely. John was looking forward to her acting like James Bond from now on. Sherlock did the same thing when he first saw it. John could barely keep a straight face when he heard Sherlock answer his phone by saying, "The name is Holmes. Sherlock Holmes." Mycroft was not amused.
He nodded reluctantly. Sherlock's frown nearly killed him.
“Yes, my dear John?”
“Don’t stop.” John spoke, still half-sleep. Sherlock chuckled. “I have no intention to.”
Sherlock was gone.
He tried to ignore Sherlock's pitiful stare toward Kylie. What was he going to say? How was he going to get out of this one? He blinked a few times, and then tried to get on one knee without falling over from his blurred sight.
John folded his hands in his lap. She took this opportunity to speak again.
Sherlock nodded. “Just give me a moment to brush my teeth.”
Holmes sighed.
Just like that he left the flat, said something about getting back to the Yard before the others strangled the new recruit, I don't know. He left me alone to my thoughts and Kylie. I couldn't help but worry about you, Sherlock. Of course, my worrying increased when you started the chemotherapy...days I'd rather forget..."
“It doesn’t matter who I get, John. I’m sure whoever drew my name just balled it up and binned the paper.”
"I would not use past tense when the topic comes to my brother."
John shook his head and slid the empty shot glass down a bit.
Mycroft grimaced.
That’s a title in progress and I might delete it, I don’t know, Sherlock will be here later to edit and proofread as he usually does.
Comments and kudos are welcomed!
John passed Rosie off to him and got the ice-cream from the freezer and two spoons. When they got settled on the couch, Sherlock took a spoonful of the ice-cream and sighed when the chocolate hit his tastebuds. John chuckled and took his own helping of the dessert. It was a few minutes into the movie when Sherlock said, “I’m…not ready to talk about it…but it’s pleasant to know that I have someone to talk to.”
“Oh sod it; I can’t be happy for my friends?”
‘So what does this mean, Sherlock?’ The doctor in me knew, but did I want to believe it? No, absolutely not.
“Papa! Papa! Look!”
“I can have dinner with you, spend every waking hour with you, but I’m not helping you in the way that I want or that’s most effective for the both of us. I’m not mad at you, I love you and I want the best for you.”
John looked at Sherlock, his cheeks tinged red at the recollection of their date.
‘I know what that means, John. We’re not getting any younger, and I remember you telling me that you always wanted children. With both of us being the same sex, we won’t be able to conceive one together, so I thought that you would consider---‘
"I...guess?"
Wasn’t that what he wanted? He wanted to be with Sherlock, he wanted Kylie to be gone so that she could live a happier life. He wanted her back. No, he
"How else would you have me do it? Your flat is simply too small. I like space, Mr. Holmes. Space helps me think."
"Is that a question, or a statement, John? You seem to mistake those two a lot."
Watson's tone changed.
"Doctor don't turn around!"
“Please John…come back….please…I love you…”
Sherlock nuzzled into John’s neck.
The Doctor gave a low rumble of a laugh.
“You may not deem it important; I still think it is only fair if I know. I did tell you about my personal life.”
Until the weeks that followed after, that is.
"Rubbish, I'm just your landlady."
There was one thing that he could try, it would be no different than the nights Sherlock played the violin to soothe him back to sleep when he first moved in. Anything to stop his love from crying.
Sherlock rested his head on the wood, suddenly feeling drunk with affection for John.
John pressed a kiss to his shoulder and nuzzled again.
"Why wait when you can tell me? I'm sure that you live together in your world, same as Watson and I do."
Holmes heard his voice in the distance, “Goodnight, Holmes.”
He shuddered as each wave of his climax hit him. He was so new to this, it warmed John’s heart. John kissed Sherlock as he came, there were tears running down the man’s face. “You did so well, I’m so proud of you. I love you.” He whispered as Sherlock’s moans turned into whimpers. They both fell back on the bed, Sherlock got up to clean himself and John’s hand off. Once they were clean and dry, they cuddled.
“But I already went!”
Rosie gurgled and the boys smiled. Nobody could hate Mrs. Hudson, and Rosie was the final proof.
“Like I said before, I’m engaged.”
He walked out of her room and went to his own. He was going to have to sleep alone again. There was no Kylie to bring him back to reality, there was no one to keep Sherlock’s side of the bed anymore. John let out a shaky breath. It wasn’t until now that he realized that he was alone.
‘Have you talked to him about it?’
"I'll be alright, don't worry about me." It's not hard to see why Greg is in disbelief. He opened his mouth to say something else, but John was already out the door, leaving a worried Detective Inspector behind. John wasn't far from his home, he just had to walk a few blocks. He almost trips over a crack not too far away from the pub. Maybe he should hail a cab.
"I thought the party was insufferable, but pleasant enough to keep you lot entertained."
"You better believe it."
“Right.” He looked around too and noticed that I was without one Consulting Detective.
“I thought so. I love you, Sherlock. You know that right?”
When he got to Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson swung the door open with Kylie standing right next to her, her big eyes were wide when she saw John standing there.
"Come now, let us be off, yes? I am so very eager to show you what comes next. We're going to solve the Final Problem you see."
"Oh yes, of course, in that closet over there. Next to the washroom."
~~~~~~~~
Moriarty was proud of that statement. John’s jaw clenched and Sherlock snorted.
Also , I wanted to have a few chapters that are primarily them talking, because I think that's my favorite thing to write about them is their conversations.
John looked a bit disappointed, but one look at Sherlock’s gorgeous face and he moved in to kiss him again.
“How did she pass?”
"Yeah, no kidding."
John wanted to rush over and embrace him, as Sherlock did when he cried. Sherlock only said a few words, but each word was uttered with such pain that it broke John’s heart to see him so distraught.
Kylie started stirring around; it was almost time for me to feed her. Her little mouth started to quiver and her wonderful blue eyes started watering. With the wonderful skill of making bottles with one hand, I was able to whip one up in record time. As soon as I was able to actually settle down with Kylie and start to feed her, you shot up off the couch as if there was a fire lit underneath of you.
"I am terribly sorry, but I can't do this. I promise I'll reschedule."
Sherlock stood there with his mouth hanging open.
Sherlock rubbed at his eyes and nodded. John didn’t want him to blame himself. Sherlock never blamed him when he was like this, not even when they barely knew each other. He helped his love off the couch and walked him into the bedroom. Sherlock sunk to the bed while John took his time removing his work clothes. He climbed in the bed in nothing but a t-shirt and his underwear. He turned the light off and felt the familiar tickling of Sherlock’s curls under his nose, and his breath against his neck.
“It’s a lot more than what Watson and I would have done, but it still splendid, nonetheless.”
“Your fingers are magical, John.”
Quietly, John said, "I'd prefer if you didn't."
Mrs. Hudson laughed and waved at the both of them. She had half a mind to tell John to call her sometimes, it got lonely being the only tenant in the flat. She tried renting it out, 221B, but every time she opened that door she expected to see Sherlock lounging about in his house clothes, or shooting holes in the wall. She would sit in her kitchen and close her eyes and swear that she could still hear John and Sherlock laughing, or arguing, or even hear their moans of pleasure after dark. She missed John terribly, and Sherlock too. She closed the door after they turned the street and went back to her flat. She washed all of the dirty dishes and then took a seat in her chair. It was completely quiet. She hated it.
“Don’t act like this is shocking. You know you’re the only person I’ve ever…you’re my only friend. I’m not the person that people call when they want to have ‘sleepovers’ and you know that.”
And then while she was hugging you, Molly looked close to tears too, but she did a good job at stifling them.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Ah yes!’ The doctor sputtered out. ‘You’re Doctor John Watson. Sherlock’s been telling me about you. You’re even a war hero?’
“Is that so?”
John came running into the room with his belt dangling about.
And I remember quite clearly the look I gave you. It was anger mixed with extreme worry.
John rubbed the back of his neck. He wanted to tell him, that they were getting married soon, but how would he react to that? Did John even want to know? He decided to keep that to himself, just until he found a better way to tell him.
"Shut up."
Sherlock gave a quick, short smile.
Sherlock found himself giving a ghost of a smirk as well as he listened to Holmes speak.
John stopped cleaning and folded his arms.
He rested the skull on his lap, and pulled out the little sleeve of some new forensic tools; it was a more recent version. He had a small smile on his face, but I knew that he was over the moon to have a new skull and a new kit. Sally had been paying attention it seemed.
“…I remember the morning after the appointment; I woke up and found you staring at me. Your eyes were honed in right on mine. To some people, it would have been awkward, but for me, you know I loved every bit of it. I have to admit, it’s not something I expected to wake up to, but it was pleasant. I whispered a good morning to you, and you gave me something resembling a smile. I accepted it; it wasn’t like I could see it when your face was half-buried in the pillow now could I? I waited for you to say something, maybe reply to me, but you didn’t even move to speak. I left you alone, you probably weren’t in the mood to talk, and I didn’t blame you.
John took a good look at the grim-looking alpha, his anger not only visible in his expression but also reflected in the composition of his scent. The normally confidence-inspiring aromas of tobacco and leather now smelled sour and ominous. John pushed his tongue up against his hard palate and rubbed his nose discreetly.
"This a good place for a heart-to-heart, isn't it? You can't run away when you're in the bath."
It took a couple of days until John was able to organise some time off, let his parents know about their visit, and use all of his powers of persuasion to convince Sherlock to go away with him. But now they were in the train heading for West Bromwich, and John was growing more nervous with every passing kilometre.
Mycroft, who had only sent Sherlock away a few minutes ago to have a short rest, looked up with annoyance from the pile of documents they'd been working their way through together a little while earlier.
Looking back, Sherlock couldn't say how long it took before Mycroft reappeared. He'd used the time to retreat to his mind palace and sort through his chaotic emotions, shoved all of the impressions of John that he'd collected over the past few days into a separate room and barricaded the door. All they needed now was a signature, and then this chapter would be over and his life of freedom and independence could finally begin.
Sarah had already said back then that she'd seen how Sherlock felt. Maybe she just wanted to hear that she'd been right. But John wasn't about to give her the satisfaction. Not now, not when a gravestone had been placed in a cemetery with Sherlock's name on it. Maybe she just wanted to satisfy her curiosity and find out how things were with John now. The
"No, that's not at all what I mean. It's simply..."
The omega smelled good.
He made an extremely unfavourable impression on John. The main factor was certainly his knowledge of what a horrid person the Lord was. The fact that he'd made advances toward Sherlock didn't help the situation. But the ultimate reason for John's immediate revulsion was the offensive odour emanating from the alpha. That was apparently the price one paid for bonding with multiple omegas, John thought testily.
John jerked awake. He instinctively reached for the back of his neck, still feeling the echo of the bite beneath the surface of the slowly dissolving dream. All he found were tense muscles beneath his fingers. It took him a while to sort out the various signals his body was sending.
There was no sign of John. No calls, no texts. Maybe Sherlock's plan had worked, and John really wouldn't return. Maybe he'd try to find a beta on whom to let out all of his bottled up anger in one way or another. Maybe he'd return to the war zone and beg his former commanding officer to take him back – anything to get away from his omega.
The content was as clear as water, pristine and innocuous. However, Sherlock knew that the appearance was deceiving. After all, the liquid contained a mixture of alpha pheromones and other chemicals that were invisible to the eye. Arriving at a decision, Sherlock reached for one of his last disposable needles and drew about half of the contents of the first vial into the syringe. He then rolled up his left sleeve and examined the crook of his elbow. The last puncture marks glared at him in an angry red. Another injection would hurt much more than usual.
An empty chair stood between the bed and the window. There was a half-full water bottle on the side table, along with a couple of paper cups stacked together. White strings with tags attached dangled from them. Earl Grey. Beside those was a thick book with easily a thousand pages, its corners dog-eared and its spine cracked.
Sebastian looked down at his folded hands, caught out. His eyes darted back and forth nervously as if he needed to run back through the last part of their exchange to find where he'd slipped up.
Once back at home, Sherlock barricaded the doors and windows, frantically scrubbed the blood off his hands, and stuffed the stained shirt in the dustbin. Still trembling with fury and panic, he collapsed onto the sofa and buried his face in his hands. He focused on his breathing until he'd calmed down, but the underlying fear wouldn't go away. He took the slim vials out of his trouser pocket and examined them with a critical eye.
"In my... I live here! Of course I can!" Even more determined than a few seconds ago, Sherlock pulled away from the alpha and flung open the kitchen door. He hurried down the stairs, certain that John would be hot on his heels.
John thanked her and sat down on the couch. He slipped out of his half-boots so as not to leave any dirt on the expensive fabric before lying down. His overworked muscles and bones complained, aching, as the fatigue weighed his limbs down like lead.
"I should hop into the shower too. There's some toast already in the breadbasket under the tea towel. Eat something and drink the tea while I'm gone, yeah?" he said, jerking his chin in the direction of the pot on the table.
"No... the other one."
eventually.
Distracted by the broad smile, Victor couldn't avoid the door that suddenly opened right in front of his face. The handle hit him hard on his lower arm.
Mrs Holmes tittered somewhat abashedly while her husband was so quiet and withdrawn that he appeared to be receding into the blue armchair.
. And then Victor's mouth was on his again, caressing, exploring. Somehow Sherlock managed to get a breath, even if he couldn't for the life of him say how.
Their eyes were locked on each other the whole time until Sherlock had sunk all the way into John. He held himself up on his elbows and kissed John possessively. John let go of his legs so that he could hug Sherlock instead, squeezing him as close as possible. He ran his hands over Sherlock's damp skin, put them into his unruly curls, and returned the kisses with equal passion.
"John..." Sherlock sighs softly, pushing his pelvis up to meet John, reaching for his hips and increasing the friction. His hands glide over John's covered penis. "I want to see you naked this time," Sherlock whispers darkly and tugs impatiently at the waistband of his sweatpants.
"Plus – Henry
The worst part, though, was that Sherlock had sacrificed him to save John.
" John silenced Sherlock by jerking his pelvis forward and burying his knot a little deeper inside.
"You're right. I'm sorry. I'll try to do better, okay?"
"It's not your fault, John. But I can't... not without Bill."
John wasn't able to reflect on his strange observation any further, since Donovan arrived with his visitor ID, and Sherlock returned from his interview just a short while later.
"It would just be an experiment," Victor said eventually when there was no change in Sherlock's indecisive expression. "No demands, no expectations. You just let it happen and take your time analysing all the data. Then you can make your move on Walters without panicking over it."
"Your father told me about it this afternoon when we were looking through those old photo albums. Carla something or other."
Anthea's cool gaze flickered over to the phone camera, and Sherlock saw nothing but contempt there. No matter how long she'd worked for Mycroft, no matter how close her connection to Sherlock's big brother – and figuratively to him – Sherlock had no doubt that she would shoot the old woman as soon as she received the signal.
John found it difficult to let the rhythm of the music take hold of him. He and Victor didn't exactly dance together, although they stayed close to each other. Each one moved on his own to the alluring sounds which soon took control. John watched in fascination how naturally Victor seemed to lose himself in the music, as if he'd never done anything other than dance. John tried to copy his movements a little, but realised fairly quickly that he wasn't anywhere close to being as in tune with the music as Victor was.
He reached one arm around Wiggins and into his pants, feeling for the other man's half-hard dick. He swallowed thickly. This was the first time he'd touched anyone other than himself. It was... weird. An unspectacular piece of flesh in his hand that firmed up within the space of a few heartbeats, gradually moving into an upright position. Moisture welled out of the tip, making the friction smoother.
Moran lifted one eyebrow and regarded the pair with undisguised interest.
"It was Anthea."
He laid his index finger across his lips, signalling John to remain silent. His entire body visibly taut, he squeezed his eyes shut and listened hard. John perked his ears as well, but the house didn't respond with anything more than a ghostly silence.
"You're Amalia, aren't you? Anastasia's sister?"
With those words, Sherlock opened the door and hurried down the stairs.
Sherlock made an indeterminate sound and shrugged. John watched in fascination as water and suds ran off his glistening shoulders before they disappeared again beneath the surface. John moistened his damp lips, already warm from the humidity in the air. He quickly looked away, feeling as if he'd been caught doing something forbidden, even though Sherlock couldn't even see him because of the washcloth.
*****
The evening was a complete success compared to the previous night. The food was excellent, the red wine light and sweet, and the conversation pleasant. Even Sherlock participated in the small talk, as John was happy to note.
04:43 am
Victor had every right to voice his anger. But even if he did forgive Sherlock at some point, Sherlock would have to live with the guilt. At least until it sank in that Moriarty's plan hadn't worked and all of Sherlock's friends were alive.
The continuous stimulation of highly sensitive nerves screwed John's arousal tighter and tighter. This time, though, it didn't abate, didn't diminish, but grew with every thrust until all of a sudden, everything in John seized up and a wave of hot-and-cold sparks chased down his spine. John's muscles contracted over and over as he came. He groaned mindlessly into the cover, unable to distinguish all of the sensations. White spots danced before his eyes, and a continual stream of ejaculate poured out between his legs.
"Yes. Yes..."
John moved closer to Sherlock as he spoke those last words, placing one hand on his cheek. He stroked Sherlock's prominent cheekbone with his thumb and gave him a lopsided smile. Relief loosened his tense muscles when Sherlock leaned into the touch and returned his smile.
"I've found the male omega. Look here." Donovan tilted the laptop toward the open side window and looked up at her boss.
"John, what's the matter?" Mary sobbed.
Fate hadn't been kind to him. Instead, it had presented him twice with the scent of wildflower honey, turned everything topsy-turvy, and irrevocably changed his life.
While John rests next to Sherlock's hip, he thrusts relentlessly into his fist, chasing after his own climax, which gathers, tingling, in the middle of his body. Panting, he puts his forehead against Sherlock's groin, feels how the sharp hip bone pushes into his cheek. The muscles in his thighs and back are tense as the orgasm finally rolls over him and tears a hoarse moan out of him.
John's heart squeezed and his stomach did some kind of complicated flip as Sherlock crouched down, lifted the child into his arms, and bumped his nose against Archie's neck.
"Soho," Victor answered shortly.
Sherlock bit down on his bottom lip. His worry over John was undercut by one single, agonising thought: wasn't it unlikely that John would have been brought here, where there were so many witnesses? Had he been mistaken? Understood the message incorrectly?
Victor and Sherlock broke apart, breathing hard and trying to regain their lost composure.
"You needn't go into it if you don't want to," John assured him. "But if you do, I'm here," he added with a smile.
Unfortunately, Augustus Moran's death claimed one final victim: Anastasia didn't survive either. In her already weakened state, without the support of Seven's effects, her body couldn't handle the rupture of the bond. She died in the hospital, the same night as Augustus and Sebastian.
Fortunately, he'd never been aware of nearly being shot. He'd been informed afterwards though. It was clear by looking at him that the experience wasn't going to be so easy for him to shake off, despite everything. He'd been given a leave of absence from work and advised to see a therapist so that he'd be fit to resume his duties with New Scotland Yard as soon as possible.
The quivering in Sherlock's muscles intensified, and his shoulders trembled. He felt exposed and raw and guilty because he'd made such a huge mess not only of his own life, but John's as well. He wasn't worthy of love, so it was no wonder that all the people he loved disappeared from his life.
?!" Completely beside himself, John kicked the chair he'd been sitting in a moment before. It fell over with a wooden crash and skidded into the nearest wall.
Sherlock's eye automatically flicked to the upper right corner of the screen. Indeed: it was a recording from the same day as the previous one, just two and a half hours later. Sherlock paused the video again and sighed. Without looking up at his brother, he said, "You shouldn't have done that. No court in the world would accept a statement after the use of violence."
With a sneaking suspicion, John looked the omega over more closely and fancied he detected an underlying alertness in his otherwise calm looking expression. In addition, he caught a whiff of the stale scent of doubt and distrust, almost completely obscured by the aromas of countless Italian seasonings swirling around the room. And it seemed to be coming from Sherlock.
Sherlock chuckled, kissing her thigh to wipe off some of the slick on his mouth before he crawled up Sally's body to kiss her mouth, rubbing a thumb against her cheekbone. "Better?" Sally nodded, and he kissed her once more before crawling back off the bed to circle around and watch Greg and Molly.
John has been quiet on crime scenes. It has been taking him 60-90 seconds longer than average to examine corpses. Sherlock has often observed him reexamining a wound or a contusion, as though he had forgotten what he had already seen. After John neutralized the kidnapper, he wanted to get home to go to bed. Usually after a rush of adrenaline he's too giddy for sleep; he wants to get dinner and shag.  And he didn't go out for pints with Lestrade this week as normal. He's been skipping supper and going to bed almost as soon as he gets home from work nearly every evening.
John considered this, pausing his hips while he considered alternatives. "Saliva," he rebutted.
The next morning, when Molly stumbled into the bathroom to pee and brush her teeth, she found a prescription along with a pill bottle in John's name with the same medication inside. A note from John read, "These really helped me when my anxiety was bad. Feel free to try mine for a week or so before filling the prescription if you're interested in seeing if it helps."

Sherlock flinched but held John's gaze. "I thought you'd wake up immediately and it would be exciting and impulsive and ... like it was for me, with your episode. But then you didn't wake up but you were

, Sherlock bottomed out. He bit his lip, the choking, slippery heat of John all around him. “I know this sounds unlikely, but it’ll be better once I start moving.” John nodded, and Sherlock gently, slowly started to rock a bit inside him. “Alright?”
Sherlock's looked miserable. "It was a lot, OK? Mycroft had my accounts frozen. Can we please just leave it at that? It was a lot. The majority of my sexual encounters have been transactional."
Clutching her hand to her thumping heart, Molly continued kicking off her shoes. "Christ, John," she said tightly. "You scared the life out of me."

Leaning his head back, John rinsed. "I'm getting fat," he protested, reaching up for another kiss. "Too much of takeaway and Mrs. Hudson's scones."
"Add It Up" started playing, and John hissed a triumphant "yesssss". Sherlock laughed, and they pushed in for soft, playful kisses on the first verse.
Sally nodded. "Yeah. Well, after I got my head on straight again."
Molly nodded. "Yeah, I can see that. You were young and drunk and it would've been your word against his." They sat quietly for a minute as a busboy cleared their plates. "Is that when you decided to become a police officer?"
John stirred, stil asleep, and cuddled closer, squeezing Molly's breast and running a thumb absently over her nipple, teasing it hard. He slotted his hips against her bum. "Hel-lo!" Molly exclaimed, freezing.
She winced a bit. “Sorry. I never really think of us as having a ‘history’, but I suppose that’s how John would look at it.” She scooted over a few inches so they weren’t touching, and Sherlock shot her a withering look. Molly crossed her arms. “Don’t look at me like that! Now you’ve got me thinking about whether John minds our friendship because we shagged a few times nearly a decade ago.”
"Bullshit, of course you knew. A) he's a silver fox and EVERYBODY wants him, and B) of course you knew." Sherlock smirked. John kissed him softly. "Seriously, though. Why didn't you tell me you wanted a threesome?"
“…yes, keep going.  It gets better?”
John slowly sipped on a beer as he watched Sherlock charm the literal pants off an exotic dancer. Sherlock had thought he might have to audition as a dancer for their cover and had come in dressed head to toe in leather, looking breathtakingly gay. After setting one foot inside the club, they'd rushed to the restroom to shed the jacket and vest. "It's called Woody's, for the love of God!" he exclaimed, fussing with his hair to calm it down a bit.
"I wouldn't be so sure about that," she teased, "But you might not be much good to me after he was through."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’m fine. Quit looking at me like I’m about to combust.”
Greg looked back up at John, his eyes darting from John's eyes, to his mouth, then to Sherlock's eyes. "Gorgeous," he repeated, leaning in slowly, telegraphing the kiss so John could turn away.
John winced. “Too soon, Sherlock.” He grew quiet, looking down at the fingers he realized he was squeezing a bit too tightly for comfort. “It was … overwhelming. I lost my head for a bit,” he admitted.
John squeezed his hand, leading him up the stairs to 221b, and pulled him inside. “You’re quiet,” he commented blandly, divesting Sherlock of his coat as he kicked off his shoes. Sherlock did the same as John hung up his own coat before taking him by the hand and leading him to the bedroom.  “I can practically hear the wheels spinning,” he murmured, tugging him closer by the shirt. “Why don’t we see if I can quiet down that giant brain of yours a bit?”
John? What if John tried bottoming and realized what a massive mistake he’d made? What if he had another huge sexuality crisis and left him?
) and caught up to his long strides just as he reached the crime scene tape. Already he was taking in the scene with rapidfire observations. “I googled the owners on the way. They own a spa nearby.” He tilted his head slightly, seeming to take in the paint on the garden fence. “Appears that business isn’t booming quite as well as it once was. Loads of positive reviews, then they had a poor rating from the health inspectors. Business has been flagging a bit since then. “
John flushed, licking his lips nervously before letting out a huff of a laugh. He rubbed the back of his neck. “Never deduced …?”
"My arm ... I had a bad date," Molly blurted out, face growing hot. "Please, just ... I'd appreciate if you'd keep it between us."
Sherlock took cases, attempted to shutter his emotions from John, and even went on an absolutely wretched date with an attorney who'd chatted him up at a crime screen. In the first five minutes, Sherlock had mentioned being a violinist, and the man had replied that he had a fondness for Wagner. Sherlock had flicked his eyes over him once before thoroughly dismantling him. The date was over before their coffee had cooled. Sherlock tried not to think about the fact that John didn't know enough about classical music to have bad taste in it, or that he would've been amazed to have seen Sherlock deduce the man's past work as a stripper from the way he sat at the table.
"He didn't recruit me right then and there, it wasn't until later, after Redbeard died..."
"I think, that we should let them stay tonight. Just until his colleague regains consciousness and gets his bearings together."
"Sherlock, Sherlock come on, wake up..."
The Doctor gave one more smile at Sherlock, before making his way to John, who was, admittedly a bit creeped out. Giving a courteous smile, he held out his hand and waited for John to take it. John's eyes darted to Sherlock, who gave him a curt nod, before accepting the handshake.
"How long was I out?"
“I know this Holmes, but I can’t help but worry.”
John scoffed.
"Tell you what, when we get home, I'll open up the biscuits and then we'll watch movies tonight."
‘You just seem distant, love, and you barely talk to anybody anymore. You would think with the news on our baby, you would be happy, or some variant of it. What’s wrong?’
“Love look, I saw these while I was coming home. Aren’t they wonderful?”
“I hardly think you’re one to talk about negativity, Holmes.”
Sherlock nodded with agreement.
After much more debate and Watson's assistance in getting Sherlock into the room, John was ready for bed. The room they were staying in had two separate beds in it, much to John's disappointment. He sat on the edge of his bed, watching Sherlock sleep and wishing for the moment where he woke up. He was getting ready to remove his waistcoat when he heard a knock on the window. It wasn't a branch, it was too forceful and it wanted to be heard. He looked over and saw the man he's been waiting to see.
"Ah, I see."
"I don't have you anymore, Sherlock."
"So now all the blame is to be put on me?"
"I'm...sorry, pup. What was it you were saying? You got the highest mark on the test?"
“Oh, did you finally grow bored of mutilating that poor bee?”
You looked pained. You were paler and your lips were drawn together to create a solemn expression on your face. Did I feel bad for making you feel like that? I don’t know. I want to say that I do, but then I would have never gotten the truth out of you. You sank down to the bed like a deflated balloon and exhaled shakily. I was angrier and grew more anxious by the minute. I always hated it when there was something wrong with you, because then you would never tell anybody and it would only hurt you more.
“Sherlock, hey.”
'Sherlock,' I said,'We don't need to have sex in order for me to find you sexually attractive. We don't need to have sex at all just to prove that we love each other.'
“I hear it’s more romantic.”
Moriarty chuckled.
'It seems that you, Mister Holmes-Watson, your....it's about the cancer...' Your eyebrow rose and your eyes darted over at me.
“I am highly aware of that Watson.”
But your search, the one about the loved ones, it had me thinking. While the surgery might work, it might not, and what then? I couldn’t wait to tell everyone when you were admitted into hospital that same day. They had to know sooner or later. We had to tell them about this. You hated me for it, but I had no other option."
Young Sherlock started to smile.
“I know.”
You spoke with no feeling at all, your voice sounded strained, but I think it had more to do with your worsening condition. You were already saying your goodbyes, Sherlock. You were ready…or maybe you weren’t…maybe you were only trying to be brave for me, or for yourself. I didn’t want you to be brave, love. I didn’t want you to be the cold, sociopath that you thought yourself to be. I wanted you to be Sherlock Holmes-Watson, the human, my husband.
Sherlock’s face was a beautiful shade of red from the pleasure and the flattery of John’s compliments. When John gradually increased his speed on Sherlock’s cock, Sherlock could not help but to let out a soft, “John…”
“I didn’t know laughing at a joke was cause to be struck.”
‘I’m sorry, John’ You said, ‘I have told him many times who you were but I don’t think he ever remembers.’
Holmes moved to his chair and pouted. John just remembered that he had to go and check on Sherlock. He told the Doctor and then made his way to the room he was staying in. He opened the door slowly to find Sherlock lying down in the bed still, though he couldn't tell if he was sleeping so he moved in closer. He saw Sherlock breathing lightly, so he was just sleeping now, he wasn't in a semi-coma. He crouched down and gently brushed his cheek and moved some curls out of his face.
"Sherlock! Holmes!"
“Let us begin! One...Two...Three...”
He wrote this reminder for himself. Some job he did remembering it. He ripped it off the fridge, he must’ve moved it there on one of his drunk nights. He fished through the kitchen drawers and got the Sharpie marker out of its hiding place. He popped off the cap and started to write on the note. He crossed out the original writing and began to write over it. He capped the marker again, and then put the note back up on the fridge.
"J-John Watson."
John can feel his hand shaking. He shoves it into his pocket.
"Listen, love, I'm heading out for a while with the Doctor."
He joined the duo on the bed.
“Sherlock…. shh, hey, hey love, it’s alright, I got you. I have you.” He pulled Sherlock into an embrace and kissed his head gently, ignoring the pain of the man punching his chest and stomach with all his might. The tears hit the side of his neck in large, hot drops. What happened to him? Who hurt him to this extent? What was he saying? He was probably having a nightmare about him. John had been far from innocent. His fingers ran up and down the jagged back, passing over the rough spots that were his scars.
“You feel so fucking good, Sherlock… Jesus.”
Sherlock smirked at John’s reaction and replied, “Oh yes, because I too have a penchant for breathing fire, and, as others so helpfully point out, my voice is quite deep.”
John’s mouth hung open.
“That is no excuse!”
The Doctor fumbled around with his screwdriver until it made its familiar whirring noise.
I'm sorry this update has taken so long, but school has started.
But then…you walked into my life and, Sherlock you
Without facing her, he responded, "Yes, pup?"
“I’m very glad that you think of me so highly. It is rare you ever take the time you pay somebody a compliment.”
"It's called etiquette, and I would assume that you would have basic knowledge of such a thing."
“That’s not important.”
“Sherl….”
He has Kylie now, he has something to live for. He tells himself this for the rest of the walk over to Baker Street. He doesn’t say much to Mrs. Hudson. He just tells her the events at work and leaves with Kylie in tow. He usually told Sherlock about work. Kylie talks to him with a smile on her face. She talks about the work they did in class, and the friend that she made at her table, and the sticker that she earned for good behavior. He’s genuinely interested, but his smile doesn’t convey that.
"Oh yeah?"
‘Life expectancy of Pancreatic Cancer.’
"God you're a lot quieter than I remember you being."
“I suppose that’s true. And it makes it all the more reasonable if you tell me.”
He poked the syringe into his left arm. He pressed down on the plunger and felt the liquid enter his body. He closed his eyes and let his head lean back on to the wall. Shortly thereafter, he felt the effects of his drug-induced mind and let them take him to his slumber.
Sherlock seemed to let the tension in the atmosphere leave before examining the flat further. He turned back to Holmes with a smirk on his smooth lips.
"For your birthday, genius, why else?"
There was silence.
“Let’s get dinner love, what have you eaten today?”
Watson shook his head.
Sherlock moved to take the tissue, but Young Sherlock recoiled from the large hand. Understandable.
No it won't.
Without hesitation, John replied, "Oh god yes."
He fed Rosie and himself. He put a plate away for Sherlock, but he had a feeling that all Sherlock would want is biscuits and tea.
He sniffled and wiped at his eyes, feeling relieved that he finally said that. He had wanted to say that to him ever since the first night Sherlock spent with him and told him that he made him a good man. John tried to keep his crying as quiet as possible in case Sherlock truly was asleep, but Sherlock’s burst of sobs ruined that. They laid in bed, holding each other, sobbing, and whispering “I love you” and other words of motivation and adoration.
‘Molly, Mrs. Hudson, I don’t know how long this procedure will take, but I’ll take John’s word for it when he says that I’ll be alright.’ You said.
He said something sarcastic; I’ve learned that it runs in the family. I forget what he said because it was in one ear and out the other, but it was something like, ‘Good evening, John.’  Pardon my awful attempt at his voice. I asked him what wanted and told him that it wasn’t the time for his game of hide-and-seek. I stood up and looked around to see if he had some his agents there waiting to kidnap me. He wasn’t going to take me that easily, I was going to put up a fight that time, a real one. I wasn’t going to let him drag me away while you were still being operated on, and he probably knew about the procedure too.
******
Lestrade grunted an acknowledgment and leaned over to look at Donovan's screen.
"Pleasurable," Sherlock echoed flatly. He couldn't for the life of him imagine that such a deep bite as was necessary to consummate a bond could have such contradictory effects.
Sherlock strode decisively toward John and grasped him by the shoulders, digging his fingers into the fabric of his jacket. "Don't you see? We could make a pact, get what we can out of it for both of us. Namely our freedom!"
"There are only ten thousand combinations you can create with four digits, Sherlock."
, that he hadn't known anything about the drug deals – or even better, that he'd even acted to counter them. But what would be the point? He'd seen all too often how quickly people formed opinions and wouldn't change them. Drawers stuffed full with a few incomplete bits of information and then locked shut. Ridiculous.
"Give me... a minute or so at least!" Sherlock snapped and turned on the tap. He slipped into the dressing gown hanging on the back of the door, tied the sash, and bent over the sink to splash cold water on his face and rub it on the back of his neck.
Abandoning the tea, John hurried over to the other two men and glanced at the photographs in the folder. There were several snapshots of a man wearing a baseball cap in the colours of the Union Jack with a red-and-white letterman's jacket. The cords of his white ear buds disappeared into the top of the jacket at his neck.
Maybe it hadn't been such a good idea to drop in on Mr and Mrs Holmes unannounced as they had, but John didn't regret it.
At the station in Leeds, they were greeted by Bill, who yanked John into a hearty embrace and shook Sherlock's hand with a broad smile.
Sherlock wrote back and set down his phone.
John looked at her, exhaled the air from his lungs, and shook his head slightly. "I'm sorry, Mary. I'll ring you, all right?"
Mary wrinkled her brow, looking utterly bewildered when she saw that it was a London number. Nonetheless, she wasted no time entering the digits and held the phone to John's ear when it started to ring.
"No... If I'm not mistaken, this is one of the letters Sherlock and I fought over once..."
He vigorously suppressed the desire to leave the room and go down to join the others. To put his arms around John and Victor and drive home with them. He ripped the urge out of his consciousness and hid it deep inside his mind palace. In the place where he hid all of the small, private things that got in the way of his work.
"Could you at least ring him and let him know I'm here? I don't have a number for him, unfortunately, but there's a matter of some urgency that I need to discuss with my omega." John hoped that the subtle reference to hierarchical structure would prompt a favourable response from the other omega, but it seemed to have just the opposite effect.
"I'm sorry..."
He stopped abruptly in his tracks and turned around. Mary had just come out of the building and was walking purposefully toward him. A few strands of blonde hair had escaped her hair grips. Red cheeks and an impish grin on her lips emphasised the untamed energy that radiated from the woman. They'd barely exchanged three words up to now, but John had watched her once or twice.
*****
"Dr Watson, how nice that you could find the time," Mycroft intoned in a nasal accent without favouring him with so much as a glance.
Victor was gratified to see Sherlock's lips part slightly, as if he were having trouble breathing. It was too dark to judge his reaction to the scene any more precisely, but at least he hadn't run off. He liked what he was seeing. Maybe he was recalling the kiss under the chestnut tree and noting that what he was seeing here was completely different. That there was passion at play here that he wasn't personally familiar with. He was curious.
"Did you tell him that? In those exact words?"
The dig didn't escape John's notice, but what caught his attention much more was the shift in certain nuances in Greg's scent composition. The bitterness had almost entirely disappeared, and in its place, John smelled vigilance. What was even more interesting, however, was the faint whiff of ice crystals. It smelled like the sky just before the first snowfall.
"Did your parents do it with you?"
John couldn't stop running his hands over the damp skin of Sherlock's chest and upper arms. He didn't know whether it was residual moisture from the shower or perspiration, nor did he care. All he knew was that he couldn't get enough of licking the tiny beads of water off of Sherlock's red-hot skin.
"You know what they are," Sherlock rasped, his voice barely audible.
Is that what I smell? It's not blocking anything, Sherlock. You just smell...
"I'll leave you alone for the time being. If you need anything, just push the call button."
"But if Sherrinford had an accomplice inside MI6... isn't it likely that that individual – or individuals – are still acting in secret somewhere?" John asked, swallowing heavily. He had a distinct sense of foreboding.
Sherlock was on his feet in an instant, only to wince at the pain that flashed through his shoulder. It took him a moment to collect himself.
"Where's Dad?" he asked, once he'd steered Lorraine to the visitor's chair next to Harry's bed.
"Listen..." John said gently, bringing Sherlock back to the present. "A holiday actually doesn't sound that bad. I'd just need to make sure it doesn't collide with anyone else's plans at work. We could get away for a couple of days and see what happens. After all the stress recently, it would do me good as well."
Sarah made a thoughtful sound and scraped the rest of the ice cream out of her bowl, even as John regretted going into so much detail. It wasn't his place to tell a stranger about Sherlock's difficulties with accepting life as an omega. Plus, he didn't want to talk about his bond with any third parties. He didn't want to talk about it with anyone full stop. Except maybe with the one person who wasn't so talkative himself.
"I understand," John murmured sympathetically. Bill's story reminded him of his own fate. In some ways it was diametrically opposed, but still characterised by social conventions and expectations.
John then clumsily gets out of his shoes, pushes his trousers over his hips, and lies down beside Sherlock. Although his erection has slightly waned, it immediately becomes hard again when John wraps his hand around it and rubs it unceremoniously. His gaze is fixed on Sherlock's peaceful sleeping face, the sweep of his beautiful lips, the flush in his cheeks. It takes less than two minutes before John, suppressing a groan, comes on his shirt. Relieved and panting, he leans back and enjoys the buzz and tingling flowing in waves through his body.
John sighed and buried his face in the pillow, taking deep breaths. In and out. Without even trying very hard, he fancied Sherlock's smell still permeated the sheets. Mixed with his own. A potpourri of memories, making his stomach tense and cramp. No, there was nothing left. All his imagination, a pipe dream, nostalgia. A desperate attempt to hold fast to that which was unrecoverable.
"Where are we going, anyway?" John wanted to know once they were sitting in a carriage on the Victoria line. He examined his image in the window pane across from him. Victor had done quite a good job. John wasn't used to wearing his hair combed back, but he quite liked it. He normally had it cut shorter, but he'd been putting off his usual visit to the barber for a few weeks now.
Panting and trembling, Victor leaned on the mattress and slid down onto the sheet next to Sherlock, exhausted, so as not to burden him with his entire weight. He vaguely registered Ryan eventually pulling out of him. His body was smarting and humming at the same time with a ridiculous combination of pleasure and pain. He closed his eyes, trying to breathe calmly.
"Sebastian."
Sherlock shrugs indifferently and puts his cup back into the cupboard.
Sherlock chuckled lightly. "I wasn't sure it would work, but the experiment was definitely worth it. And it was surprisingly simple."
"What do you want?"
"Merci," answered the omega softly. "It was awful at first. But it has gotten easier."
"The real reason for our visit is that we... well, John and I have talked a lot about Sherlock, but of course that only goes so far and it's all rather subjective. There are a lot of things we don't know at all, or only a little – such as what Sherlock was like as a child, for example. So we'd really like it if you could tell us something about him."
"Come in, why don't you?" Sherlock grumbled. "And close the door, there's a draught."
"Sherlock?!" came from the other side of the door, but Sherlock didn't make another sound, nor react to John's knocks. Several long moments passed before the alpha finally gave up and beat a hasty retreat.
"Of course. Plus Lestrade is at another crime scene and needs our help anyway. So, are you coming?"
But now he sensed John again, stronger than ever, as if the alpha were feeling things more intensely, undergoing more profound emotions, maybe even love. Had John found someone who'd stolen his heart? Someone who completed him? Who loved him the way... the way he deserved?
It was only now that John recognised the scent emanating from the man: he was obviously the alpha who owned the house, and therefore must be Sherlock's brother. John squared his shoulders and held out his hand.
"But that's precisely the point! I don't want to be anything special in this. I want it to be normal to see omegas as… human beings, with equal rights… of equal
When he heard something gurgling, he opened his eyes and looked down. The usually crystal-clear water was clouded with red and black eddies. The roiling increased until the entire lake was bubbling and steaming.
Following the session, Mary had asked John again whether he wanted to have a drink with her. She always sounded quite offhand about it, as if it weren't a date but rather just a casual get-together between friends. John had made his excuses, saying he had another appointments, but promised to take a rain check on it for another time. Mary had simply smiled and winked at him before leaving the gym.
"What the hell is wrong with you, John?"
He took one threatening step toward Sherlock, who flinched back with wide-open eyes, still grasping the second file against his chest.
Their eyes met, and they shared a bashful smile, until it turned bitter and forced. The other soldier sighed and rested one hand on the back of John's neck, pulling him in until their foreheads touched. They stood like that for the space of a few heartbeats until the man pulled away and dropped a firm kiss on John's lips.
John hated him now – with good reason – but that was the only way to keep them apart. They'd never planned to live together, which was why things were so rocky between them. It was therefore out of the question for Sherlock to admit how much influence John had over his body. No, it was better to be rid of John and get through this heat on his own. Sherlock had done it before the bond; why should he be any less successful now?
"What?" Ice-cold water shot through John's veins, making him break out in goosebumps despite the tropical temperatures in the bathroom. "I don't want to move out! Do you want me… Are you tossing me out?"
"I know that John is different – and you're part of the reason why he didn't turn out to be a typical alpha. The positive influence from you, Lorraine, and George is deeply anchored within him, and... and now I'm part of your family, and I hope we can learn from each other." Oh no, why had he said that? Harry didn't look as if she were enamoured of that idea in the least. Was she really only just now realising there was an omega in her family?
"The baptism?" Sherlock asked, unable to keep his voice entirely free of disparagement. "Why do they want you to be the godfather? Have you ever seen the child?"
Sherlock shrugged. "What for, it all ended well," he said, examining John's tense expression. The way his lips were pressed together and his eyes reflecting a mixture of worry and annoyance indicated that further opposition was in the offing. Sherlock prepared himself for the argument that was sure to ensue while stirring milk and sugar into his cup with outward calm.
It had taken an incredible amount of effort for John to take the first step and send Victor a message after two days had passed. When he'd finally done it and pressed 'send', he'd felt a little bit lighter. It was only a small shift. Maybe just knowing that he wasn't a coward, and that he was well aware of what a stupid mistake he'd made.
Sherlock lifted one eyebrow sceptically and gave John a stern look. "Are you implying it's my fault that you nearly bit my landlady's head off?"
Making a spur-of-the-moment decision, Sherlock reached behind himself for John's cock, which was brushing his perineum in a very promising manner, and stabilised it as he sank down on it. He sucked in a surprised breath as it passed through his naturally dilated ring of muscle yet still managed to stretch it noticeably. He paused halfway, straightening up a little so that John almost slipped out, only to lower himself again when he felt a fresh wave of omega essence flow out of him.
"The handbook says we should get to know each other's families..."
who's not only responsible for this great translation but a lovely person and friend <3
Sherlock wondered; theoretically, he knew everything there was to know about kissing. He knew that a kiss required the use of thirty-eight muscles, that the pulse rate increased, respiration became shallower, the adrenal cortex released adrenaline and the pancreas released insulin, that cortisol was broken down by neuropeptides in order to reduce stress, that the body temperature fluctuated, and that olfactory information was exchanged. Nothing that would justify all the fuss people made about it.
"You just can't wait to see him again, eh?"
The omega removed her hand from her stomach and folded her arms across her chest instead. "No, he isn't here."
The blonde woman who had been in his room when he'd woken up took long, confident strides and didn't announce herself in any other manner. She worked with precision, changed tubes and bags without batting an eyelash, noted down the information churned out by the machines, and disappeared again. She never said a word.
"To our very own 'Three Continents Watson'!"
Abigail let the two of them in and handed Victor the keys to his new home, but left right away for work. In addition to her studies, she side-lined twice a week in one of the campus libraries.
"Yeah?" John asked, surprised, and sniffed in turn at the deliciously fragrant skin behind Sherlock's earlobe. He dropped a butterfly kiss onto the spot and smiled when he saw the goose pimples the touch triggered.
"It almost seems as if you've been waiting for me all evening." A flash of a smile.
"Come on, you must have. Everyone was always talking about it at school."
ahh...
"That's how they wanted it. It wasn't supposed to be made a big deal of; after all, the four of them have enough grief dealing with the media circus. They actually wanted to name the wing after Sebastian, but the hospital put its foot down on that. No one wanted to have a killer's name hanging over the entrance," Mike said and chuckled sheepishly.
"Ok," John mutters, then looks up from his mobile, puzzled, and follows Sherlock with his eyes. Going for a lie-down is very unlike his flatmate. On the other hand, both of them only slept a few hours last night. As he remembers why, heat shoots up into John’s cheeks and he can't stop the blush, not even by biting down on his lower lip. He pushes the memory of last night away forcefully and focuses on the mobile in his hand. It's going to take days (weeks…), before he will be able to stop mentally revisiting the sinful sights and sounds of the last few days.
"Not at the moment, but I've set a meeting with her physician for this afternoon to take her statement. It would be helpful for them to see that we respect omegas, and are actively working with one. The whole thing will be monitored by a third-party observer, due to the investigation. Alphas aren't allowed in – not surprising given the circumstances."
"Anthea's sister. She already has two children and is quite reliable."
The horrific scars on James's face, his paralysed arm, and his sad eyes were a grotesque reflection of the state of John's soul, showing him – in the form of a living, breathing warning sign – what it meant for an alpha to lose their omega. John knew that his thoughts were unfair and inappropriate: after all, he hadn't lost Sherlock, even though it had looked like it for a brief while. No, he'd never had Sherlock in the first place.
Mycroft obviously considered Mary to be trustworthy. After all, she was willing to drive with John to this dubious safe house where Sherlock had been staying for a while now. Since Mycroft still didn't know which MI5 operatives were double agents, they needed to exercise particular caution if they wanted to bring Sherlock back to London unharmed.
Sherlock let out a humourless laugh and mustered John with a combination of disbelief and fascination. "You really think the government doesn't allow unbonded alphas in the military in order to protect omegas?"
"No, not necessarily. The only thing we've found out is the omega's name, and that he was acquainted with Gwendoline McKenzie. She used to give him piano lessons," Lestrade summarised.
(And if Sherlock isn’t playing a game, if this has a chance of being real, then it could be the best thing to ever happen to me. Besides, there are always two players in such a game...)
longer listen to it, John! It’s Sherlock this and Sherlock that – it’s unbearable! You’ve no other topic of discussion! You don’t even notice when you are talking about him! When I ask you something, the response most likely has something to do with Sherlock! Sherlock thinks! Sherlock told me!
Sherlock looked at Victor, nonplussed, but only received an apologetic shrug. It was Abigail's party, and if she wanted to commandeer Sherlock, there was very little Victor could do. At least for the time being. He sighed and took a cola out of the refrigerator, got the bottle opener from one of the other guests, and opened the lid. Bubbly sweetness spread across his tongue.
John gently extricated his left hand from Sherlock's grasp so that he could use it to map a path across the body he desired so greatly. He caressed those stiff nipples again, carefully plucking at them before making his way down between Sherlock's legs. He wrapped both hands around his erection, passing over the slippery wet cockhead with alternating thumbs, thoroughly enjoying the way Sherlock's breaths became louder with each passing moment. It wouldn't be much longer before his omega climaxed. But John didn't want to let their lovemaking end just yet. He let go with one hand and reduced the speed of his movements until the up-and-down of his right hand barely registered anymore.
She stood up and told John and Victor to follow her. Victor demurred. "I'll check on Mr Holmes..." he said and went in the direction in which Sherlock's father had disappeared earlier. Mrs Holmes raised her eyebrows disapprovingly, but turned toward the stairs leading to the upper storey. John followed her obediently.
..." Sherlock moaned as he also reached his climax, and ejaculated between their bodies.
It was a glass coffin standing at a seventy-degree angle in a darkened room. The seams were edged in brass and shimmered golden in the light of the dozens of candles placed around the floor. A locking mechanism with a keyhole was mounted on one side. Sherlock grasped the brass key in his trouser pocket so tight that it hurt.
"Sometimes I felt like he was seeking protection from me more than anything, and that's why he was so angry when I needed to leave. I never really understood it fully. It was almost as if... as if he felt some deep-seated fear but couldn't properly identify it. That might also be another reason why he reacted so enthusiastically to the drugs. To shut off his mind, to let go... he could only do that when he was high." Victor shook his head sadly and rubbed both hands over his face as if to wipe away the memories.
At that, both picked up speed, John slapping Sherlock’s ass with each thrust, and Sherlock gasping into John’s shoulder, leaving wounds from his fingernails and scratch marks along his back. Sherlock’s screams grew higher and their bodies became sweaty from the friction of their skin. John could feel Sherlock’s stomach tighten and he knew that Sherlock was coming.
“And the next thing I know, Holmes is sulking around the flat with a singed eyebrow! He still won’t tell me to this day, at most I get a ‘simply an experiment gone wrong, Watson.’”
‘So you’re going to get it removed, yeah?’ She inquired, her voice was shaky. You nodded to her question; you didn’t have much to say that day. She gave us a small smile and then gave Kylie back to me. She told me that she had to leave; there was something at the morgue that she had to go get. We knew that she was lying; she looked about ready to burst into tears right then and there. She walked out quickly, didn’t even hear Greg shouting after her. When he realized that getting her back would be impossible, he sighed and ran his hands through his hair.
Sherlock turned to face John now. He hugged his knees to his chest and wore a wry smile. He cocked his head and John wanted to kiss the smug look off his face. “Tell you what, let’s play a game of deduction.”
I wanted to know why nothing ever went my way. I grabbed Kylie and made my way to Barts, hoping that you were okay…”
He exhaled when he heard Sherlock’s short chuckle. They say their goodbyes and John attempts to distract himself with the mountain of paperwork and patients that enter his office.
“Your friend, the one with the suspenders, I believe he calls himself The Doctor. He told Watson, John, and me that we were the same person. We just come from alternate universes.”
Sherlock looked like he had more questions, but he relented at the sight of John’s pleading face, reminding him so much of a puppy. He smiled softly and nodded.
John smiled and replied, "I'll only be a moment, Kylie."
"I...I wanted to follow The Doctor....John wanted to tag along. I tried to tell him to stay back, but he's a stubborn fool. We...we...we never made it any farther than the front door before we were attacked."
"I wish I was, John, I wish I was!"
I always came back from surgery to see Mrs. Hudson fawning over the baby, and a smile crept across my face each time. Not a fake one, Sherlock, a real smile, a genuine one. I was so happy that all of our friends were proud of our new addition. She was the star, Sherlock, our little star.
Sherlock scoffed. “I don’t deserve your patience.”
"What's wrong, Doctor?"
The Doctor adjusted his bowtie and looked stunned.
“Doctor wait!”
“That’s….”
"I think we go ahead and save Sherlock and Holmes."
John and the Doctor were confused. Holmes? Watson? Where were they exactly? The man who was wearing the almost exact same thing as John, and almost looked like him, besides the moustache and the heavier build (and that he was slightly taller). The "Holmes" guy looked nothing like Sherlock except that they had the same look in their eyes, cold and analytical. He had a birdlike nose, and his face seemed gaunter and skinnier than Sherlock's, and his cheekbones could never compare to Sherlock's. Watson turned around and saw the disoriented detective in John's arms, struggling to stand on his own two feet.
John’s eyes were tearing up now.
"Why? Is Sherlock back there sleeping?"
“I could say the same to you, but you are not one for sleep most days.”
"John Watson! You have the mouth of a sailor!"
"The other Sherlock has to wake up soon, hopefully he can fulfill my needs."
"What?! What's he talking about Sher--."
‘I want you to be happy, John. And I’ve thought about this for a long while, after we got married, to be exact. And I’ve come to the decision…’
John's eyes were wide and refusing to stare at anything else other than the angel. He nodded frantically. His jaws clenched, as well as his fist. Moriarty would have a storm heading his way. He noticed that Sherlock was sporting a bruise on his cheek; no doubt one of Moriarty's goons hit him for their sadistic pleasure.
‘They have five minutes in here.’
He sounded upset.
John knew what Sherlock wanted to do, and he saw how hesitant Sherlock became. He wanted to go inside, to see how close the flat is to being finished. There was that nasty thought in his head that Sherlock longed to go home rather than be with him but he did his best to push it away. Sherlock loves Baker Street, and so does John.
‘Oh yeah,’ I responded, ‘Wish I was there, would’ve loved to write it up on my blog.’
But Sherlock just couldn't stop nodding, and in one big rush, the word "Yes" managed to escape his mouth, as well as the tears of joy that so many other people have talked about having in their lifetime, Mrs. Hudson especially. John's eyes were getting teary as well as he rubbed soft circles on the younger man's bare shoulder. John wasn't one to show emotion, neither was Sherlock, but here they were, almost stark naked in their rooms, quietly celebrating their new-found engagement. John had that familiar aching in his chest, and it's what he got whenever Sherlock wasn't around, but he was here now, and he was so close. John grabbed Sherlock and brought him into a deep and passionate kiss, all of the words they couldn't say pouring into their kiss, and it hurt so good. Sherlock released himself from John's kiss and then slowly sank into John's chest, getting in the scent of his fiancee, feeling every hair on his chest, wanting to be as intimate as possible. John knew what he was doing, and he slowly rocked him back and forth.
Sherlock could barely speak and he knew it. His face was perfect. His body was so perfect. John was in love with the perfect man. He kissed his lips, and could feel Sherlock’s moans vibrate on his. He pulled away to get a good look at Sherlock flushed and excited. He wanted to make him look like that all the time.
It was ridiculous for John to want to commemorate a holiday about love; as far as Sherlock was concerned, every day he spent with John was worth commemoration. Angelo had fussed and led them to their table and poured them glasses of chianti, insisting that it paired best with the Valentine’s menu. Every seat in the small restaurant was filled, couples smiling happily and taking appreciative bites of their pasta and seafood. Two tables over, a banker in his late twenties was nervously waiting for the dessert to arrive along with the engagement ring he’d had Angelo drop in a glass of champagne. Sherlock sniffed disdainfully at the man’s lack of creativity and turned back to John, who was smiling at him with a dangerous, don’t-fuck-up-our-evening glint in his eye.
Sherlock brushed his lips against John's ear. "Hardly." He watched John stroke himself and saw his own strokes mirrored. "Don't think anyone would notice me while
an ideal arrangement. Now my flatmate can hardly stand to look at me." He shuffled a bit. "I don't think I can stay here with the constant ... chill."
Sherlock lifted off, letting John fall out of him with a gentle pop, and tugged until they were both laying down. They both leaned in for a deep kiss, John's fingers tangling in Sherlock's curls as Sherlock's traced down John's side to rest on his hip.. John sighed contentedly, and Sherlock chuckled, realizing that he was quickly being pulled into sleep. “Don’ laugha’ me,” John mumbled. “Can’ help it. It’s the prolactin.”
Molly fidgeted a bit. "The first couple of days were rough. John prescribed me some nerve pills and they seem to be helping." She looked down at her plate, picking idly at the crust.
Sherlock sprang out of his chair, grabbing John by the elbow.
Sherlock crowded John, attempting to herd him against the wall as he reached for his hips. "On the contrary," he rumbles. "Anderson and Donovan both definitely wanted to hear more."
John's smile was a little too understanding. "You love her."
John looked up and of course, Sherlock was right. He punched him in the shoulder, laughing in spite of himself. "You arsehole!"
Sherlock stilled, taking in John's deer-in-headlights expression and considered how much information John actually wanted. He hadn't meant to ask the question, after all. But now it hung between them and Sherlock didn't see any point in deceiving him. "It's a statistically significant sample."
John’s eyes were serious, but he was smiling playfully, carefully keeping his voice light. “We’ve been getting each other off for a month now, Sherlock. I’ve come with you buried in my arse, which seems like fairly compelling evidence that I find at least one man to be carnally appealing.” Sherlock glared at him stonily, and John sighed. “Just do me a favor, and run it again. I promise you've got it wrong.”
Sherlock opened the door with a look of disdain. "Ian is
The clench on his stomach twisted, and he closed his eyes for a moment. He could hear John pacing in his room.
Something was prickling at the edges of Sherlock's mind, and he closed his eyes, turning to face it. He had never expected that he would feel so involved with -- well, anyone, but especially someone like John. Certainly he was a competent partner, and enthusiastic about The Work in a way few others were. But it was more than that. Sherlock thought about his illogical desire to make sex perfect John, even if it had meant the exclusion of his own pleasure, and about the relief he’d felt when John had stopped torturing himself about his PTSD. Why had he cared what John thought about his prior sexual encounters? When one eliminated the impossible …
John glanced up Greg's strong, lean form and wondered for a moment exactly how they'd gotten to this point. For once, Sherlock had agreed to join Greg and John for their traditional post-case pub night, which John had not thought much of at the time. Then, several drinks in, Sherlock had fixed Greg with his deducing gaze. John tried to glare at him in warning but he'd resolutely avoided eye contact. Greg eventually noticed and tipped his head in a resigned, out-with-it gesture.
Sherlock noticed of course, and he leaned down for a kiss before murmuring, "Bedroom?"
John laughed good-naturedly. "Of course not."
Molly barked  and laugh. "You know what I appreciate about you, Sally? You're not trying to tell me that everything is fine."
John got them drinks and nibbles (popcorn for him, Raisinets for Sherlock) and they climbed to a row near the back. By the time the film started, the room was at about half capacity.
"Roll over, I want to see you." John complied, and Sherlock eyes flicked over him once, drinking in his flushed face, lower lip puffy with his own teeth marks and dry from panting. John's pupils were blown wide with desire, but his jaw was set, hands balled into fists, eyebrows crinkling just so. Sherlock recalculated the data, moved John's trembling and stuttering and whispering into a different column, guilt washing over him as he came to a new conclusion.
"You're close already," John observed with surprise, grinning at him with fake admonishment. "You weren't supposed to touch yourself again."
"My God, can you at least let me get the door shut before you start?" He closed it quickly and carried the grocery bags to the kitchen table. "You know this is actually none of your business."
John pressed down on Greg's shoulders so he was seated on the edge of the bed, then pushed on his chest until his back hit the mattress. He straddled his thighs, leaning over to rub his fingers through Greg's mostly-silver chest hair. "Perfect," he murmured, running his thumbs over Greg's nipples. There was no response to that, so he merely tweaked them lightly and stood back up, then moved so he was sitting beside Greg's head.
Greg pulled John's face forward again and slid their tongues together. The technique from earlier was gone; Greg was swiping his tongue against John's sloppily, desperately. Sherlock leaned forward, kissing John's neck and grazing his ear with sharp teeth. "You're close," he murmured. "Let go, love. I want to watch you together."
John considered his flatmate for a moment, eyes flicking up and down his begowned form a few times as he pulled his face into an a exaggerated grimace, tilting his head apologetically. "I have to admit, you're looking a bit rough at the moment."
