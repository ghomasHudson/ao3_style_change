"Why?" Dean asks, staring the angel down, "Because you love me as well?"
"Virtually nothing." Castiel admits, "My knowledge centers more around historical events."
"That's right, come on history nerd." Dean orders, dragging Castiel along with him. The next few hours Dean takes care of cars, showing Castiel what he is doing and how it's done. Their routine is interrupted though, when another man comes in.
Gabriel smiles, holding both of Castiel's shoulders firmly, "You will do this. Not only will you do this, you will do this well."
"You should say your goodbyes." Gabriel suggests, his tone gentler, "I know you love him, in some way. I will give you a day with him, just the two of you, if you wish. I can watch Sam easily enough." He says, "How hard can it be? The kid is less of a child then you, after all."
Dean looks at him with a smirk, "I'll find you a nice pimp hat and cane while I'm out."
Okay, Castiel got him there. Not only is that really thoughtful on his part but also a good-ass point. He's actually leaving Sam with Gabriel, just to be alone with Castiel. This is sort of the point of no return. You can no longer deny you care about someone when you are willing to leave the person you love most with Gabriel of all things. Of course he is fairly certain he has admitted to caring about Castiel, only to himself, a while ago. Still, though. He's being really fucking brave right now.
"Oh dear god he pouts now!" Gabriel gasps before laughing, "This is great!"
Finally they reach a small playground and Dean leads him to a park bench where they sit down. He remains silent for a while, as does Castiel who is no doubt highly confused by now.
"I will do my best." Castiel assures him before the boy hangs up. After he figures out how to properly hang up as well, Castiel turns to Dean, who is glaring at him. "Is something wrong?"
"Yes, Castiel is in pain. Gravity is a concept that does not exist in heaven, and weighs heavily on our unaccustomed bodies. Then of course you factor in the fact he hides his wings, which takes a lot of strength and more than a little willpower, and of course the grace. Grace requires purity, the purity of heaven, to thrive. His grace is weakening, I have heard him coughing recently, and angels do not cough. If he stays much longer he will lose his strength and die, unless he gives up his grace altogether and becomes a human."
"…Who is that woman in the sunhat?"
"You are welcome, Dean."
"Certainly better than my first." Castiel agrees, making the boy laugh. They spend the rest of dinner discussing different things, like Sam's daycare, Castiel's time in heaven, and Dean's friends. It is a nice time, something Castiel will miss when Dean ends up with Lisa, but that is his job. He will simply watch them from heaven after this. It's not the same, but it will do.
Castiel can feel the anger and jealousy roll off of Dean. It makes sense, why should an angel have a date when the human who needs someone that loves him doesn't?
"Nope, I'm watching little Sammy, you two run along!" Gabriel says, pushing the two out the door.
Dean and Cas spend the day alone together
"Not this time, I assure you." He promises, "Well, other than boredom. I simply wanted to meet these precious Winchesters."
"Yeah, yeah, the almighty angel doesn't do what he doesn't want to." Dean mocks before letting go of his face and placing his hands on Castiel's wings, stretching them through the feathers as the angel squirms underneath him. "Does that really feel so good?"
Castiel nods and flexes his wings, allowing them to come out and brush over Sam's face. The two of them soon fall asleep like that, Dean still reading.
"I do indeed. Don't worry, I won't disappoint you." She says and Castiel frowns.
"How big of you." Benny smiles, "Humans are pretty impressive, aren't they?" He asks and Castiel nods.
"You….does heaven not teach you how to interact with humans? I mean Jesus Christ."
"Oh yeah?" The older Winchester asks, "How so?"
"Yay! It's yummy now!" Sam exclaims and Castiel nods, "We are having a good date now!"
Rufus gives Dean an annoyed look, "Bobby says you brought along a playmate. Dean, the garage is no place to bring a date."
Castiel looks at him confused for a moment, unsure of how a human can actually stab an angel with no problem. He stares into the frightened green eyes looking down at him and wraps a hand around the one Dean is holding the knife with to move it from his chest, "Hello, Dean."
"Dean got a date with you and now this girl, I want a date too!" Sam explains and Castiel nods.
"Nah, let's make something for them." Kevin says, taking the menu from his hand, "Homemade is healthier."
"Castiel." He answers, placing a hand on the small boy's head. "Where is your brother?" Castiel asks and Sam frowns.
"But you like us more!"
"Did you purposely come back on his birthday?" Dean asks and Castiel frowns.
"Eat." Dean commands, earning him a tense stare from Castiel, "That deer in the headlights thing isn't going to save you from everything, Castiel, now take a damn bite before I shove it in your mouth."
"Well, Cas, seeing as how that was the plan, getting drunk would be a good thing." Dean says and Castiel looks at him confused.
Sam smiles at Castiel, "I like him."
Dean will never grow as a person without being on his own.
Dean shrugs it off and goes back to eating, "Suits me."
Castiel, however, is not most angels. He was excellent in the battlefield, a true warrior who followed his father's rules exactly. Now that he is in charge of people's happiness, however, he is slipping. Because of this Gabriel, the archangel he is under, does not give him many wishes to help with. In fact, he has made it a point to give Castiel the 'bad' people, because he knows it will go wrong. He loves Gabriel, and he knows Gabriel does it for his own benefit. Those wishes are regarded as optional so whether done correctly or not it doesn't matter to anyone.
Castiel goes to answer, but stops, furrowing his brows together in confusion. He's never actually thought much about it. "I am…"
"Gabriel…" Castiel warns, giving his brother a dark look. "Dean will be home soon, you should make yourself scarce for that."
"Have your Winchester family meeting later." Benny teases.
Dean watches him with a strange intensity, "You're gonna get drunk like that."
"How devious." Castiel observes and Dean glares at his little brother.
"Not. This. One." Dean grumbles, "So is the angel staying in our house?"
The four men go about their own thing, the three humans doing their normal routines, and Castiel watching all of them. It is interesting, to say the least, until it becomes dangerous. Dean is laying underneath a car, held up on car jacks, when one begins to give way. He is blissfully unaware, all of them are, until Castiel hears something that takes his attention from his conversation with Bobby. Without a word, he jumps up from the small chair beside the car Bobby is working on and runs over to Dean, grabbing his shins and yanking him out from beneath the car before it falls.
To have the man who did all of that just leave doesn't seem right.
The two fall silent again until they finally reach Benny's home and Dean gets out, telling Castiel to wait in the car. He certainly doesn't need to be told that twice so he nods and settles in, watching Dean head inside. Despite himself, his eyes go lower and trace the curves in his jeans from his thighs, claves, and hindquarters. Was it necessary for the man to wear such jeans? They seem too tight for him to continue wearing. Castiel usually sees Dean in far looser pants, but he's fairly certain the man only has three other pairs so something a little tight might have to be used to save money in the budget.
Castiel watches the Winchester brothers wrestle on the floor, Sam refusing to get dressed to go to Benny's house and Dean yelling about how he already agreed to go.
Lisa laughs, "You're asking me out for him and not you?"
"Cas," Dean begins, glaring at the still giggling man on the couch, "Is there any way to kill an archangel?"
"This is so cool!" Sam giggles, "Family visits are the best!"
"The Winchester boys are quite selfless," Castiel muses, "I very much want to keep you both happy. Selflessness should be rewarded."
God damnit Sam you just had to get the most ridiculously cute angel up there, didn't you?
Sam stares at him for a moment before smiling, "You sound like mommy."
"There is a lot, are you sure we need them all?" Castiel asks, unsure of what all of these things can do to make a fort.
Some time passes after that when the doorbell rings and Dean rolls his eyes. True to her word, Charlie is late. It's almost seven and everyone but Kevin and Benny are gone. Going to the door, Dean opens it to see the red haired woman all smiles and excitement.
And Sam.
"You should spend the day together!" Sam offers, making Castiel light up. It's perfect, really. Today is Dean's day off and getting to spend time with him would help Castiel figure out better ways to make him happy.
A/N: Sorry for the month long hiatus of sorts! I was in Florida with my brother, sister-in-law, and adorable niece for half a month and then since I have gotten back I have been job hunting. ...It's not going to hot. But soon! Soon I will get a job I just know it! Anyways, here's the least awful of the versions of this chapter I wrote.
No, that's foolish. Dean is human, far too young for Castiel despite their contradictory appearances, and most of all it is not allowed. Not to mention Dean is only attracted to women. He said so himself.
No longer having any patience with the drunk man, who had the nerve to hit an angel, Castiel simply leans against a wall with his arms crossed. "Well," He begins, narrowing his eyes at the man, "Perhaps if you were not so miserable all of the time, he would still go to you."
"He needs a bath." Kevin says, watching the little boy touch things with his sauce covered fingers, "You definitely need to give him a bath."
"You two are so domestic it's ridiculous."
A/N:Dean is such a poet, surely his explanation of Cas's eyes would make anyone blush. (not really omg he is so lame) Only a few more chapters left. Probably.
"They are born from women, that much I know."
"Don't be stupid, it was a guy." Charlie scoffs, "I'll also have you know I'm not as big of a pervert as you." She points to her vehicle in the driveway, out of Dean's sight. "Anyways, weirdo is in my car and I was wondering if he could join us. He's pretty dreamy, and you did say you had a gay thing not too long ago. Dreamboat stripper can be your next gay thing."
"I have no interest in such things." Castiel points out, "I know you want to date, Dean, it is alright to go out to dinner once. I will watch Sam. You should enjoy yourself." He says, gently placing the piece of paper back in his hand. "Lisa is a good woman, call her and take her on a date. I suggest not going to a strip club, though."
"I wonder if this behavior is why you won't let me sleep in here?"Castiel asks, receiving a snore for an answer as Dean's arms fall down to his sides. "I do believe this is the last time we are letting you get drunk."
Castiel grows more confused, "Stars do not form in the house…you are making no sense." He mumbles before the room grows dark, save for small spots of lights viewable through the blanket. "Those are not stars."
"Yeah? Well I made it, so you'll eat it." Dean commands and Castiel hesitates, "What? Are you scared? I'm a good cook, you know."
Castiel glances at the note on the table that Gabriel wrote, "I will not leave until they return, and from the looks of it we have a few hours until they do…"He mumbles, looking to Dean.
"I suppose I can meet him at a restaurant tonight." Lisa shrugs, giving Castiel her phone number, "Have him call me."
"Well, kiddo, you are young. Why must you focus on his happiness? Are you happy?"
"From what I have learned from TV and books here, the fact he is handsome will protect him from his own stupidity." The angel says, making Sam laugh. In a little over two hours, most of which was them searching for presentable clothing, Dean is prepared. Then, as Sam predicted, he gave Castiel a lecture for half an hour on what to do and what not to do. With that he was off to go to his date, leaving Castiel and Sam alone.
Filler where Sam sets something up for next time.
"Cool!" Sam laughs before looking at Dean, "Turn off the lights!"
"Sex has nothing to do with this." Castiel mumbles, unable to move from his spot on the bed. His head is starting to spin and his entire body feels weak. He'll have to have Gabriel bring him back, because his body will not be able to get there on its own. Perhaps the sex did do something to make it worse, but he wasn't going to tell Dean that and make him feel guilty. "It's just because I'm still here."
Castiel smiles a little and Dean is fairly certain that is NOT playing fair. "Got it."
"Going to a family friend's bar." Dean corrects, heading out of the alley. "Come on, Cas, I'm taking you to meet Ellen and Jo."
"You're freakishly pale." Dean points out, reaching over and feeling Castiel's forehead, "Your head is warm too, you should lie down. If it will help you can let your wings out, or whatever."
"Alright." Castiel stands up and grabs Sam, carrying him into the bathroom with Kevin following. He turns on the faucet, using the blue since the red one makes you burn.
"I…I want you happy." Sam explains, "You're not happy."
"Humans are stranger," Castiel counters, wrapping his arms around Dean's neck and pulling him into another kiss.
Maybe.
"Whatever, can't you, I don't know, put them away?" Dean asks and Castiel nods.
"Angels have no need for shows. When we are dirty, or our clothing is tattered, we can easily fix it."
"Bye bye, Dean!" The boy calls out and Dean flashes his brother one last smile before heading out.
"Oh great, more angels giving vague fucking answers to shit," Dean grumbles, heading to the kitchen. "Well, I have the pizza and wings, so everyone just come eat."
"Wow," Dean rolls his eyes as he heads to the kitchen, "Third wheel at my own house. To a toddler and an angel no less. How will I explain to mom that Sam's first crush was an angel?" He groans, making sure it's loud enough for Castiel to hear.
He wonders if the angel can hear his prayers, and decides to try it out. Sitting down on Sam's bed, he closes his eyes and clasps his hands together.
"Everyone can see you are, stop lying."
A/N: Someone said to use Lisa, which was a brilliant idea because I had no clue who I would use, and it gave me the chance to go different places with it. Anyways, never paid much attention to Lisa, so not sure how I did on her personality. Not that she was in here long enough for it to make a huge difference. As per usual, sorry it took forever.
"Dean only keeps secrets you would not want or need to know." Castiel points out, "If he will not tell you, chances are neither of us need worry about such things."
"You say that a lot."
Dean rolls his eyes, "You would." Groaning, he walks over to Castiel and goes behind him before taking a hold of his wings and yanking.
A/N: Shhhhhhhhh I have such an awful case of writers block, I haven't written anything in ages. I finally forced this out, so I'm sorry it's short and probably crappy, but filler can be nice too, right?
"Does a stork bring babies?" Sam asks.
Dean stares at him for a moment before shooting Kevin another dirty look, "Seriously? You've got the angel saying it, too?"
"Yes. You are."
"My name is Castiel," He says, awkwardly taking her hand. "It is nice to meet you."
"It's not for fights, it's for fun! Come inside, come inside!" He says, ushering him into the fort where they are quickly met with Dean who pointedly sits between them.
"And so Anna was punished for coming down here in a time of war." He explains, "Anna is always doing dangerous things, just like Gabriel and Balthazar."
"She's from the Candy Kingdom! She's the princess!" Sam explains.
"Apparently my hair smells good."
Sam grins at him, "Is that your way of saying you like me and Dean?" He asks, now moving from his spot on Castiel's wings.
"Like wait for me." Castiel says and Dean deflates a little. That's right, he's right. Dean's never been in love, and to feel it and have it returned but be unable to do anything about it would hurt so much. Not to mention Dean might have a slightly stubborn streak and would cling onto what he wants to believe; that Castiel would love him enough to give up his grace.
Castiel nods, biting his lower lip, "It feels really good." He admits and Dean stares down at his wings confused.
Castiel takes a sip of his beer and winces. He never liked alcohol and it would never make sense to him as to why people get so attached to it. Deciding against it he chugs the alcohol as fast as possible. "This is awful."
"You have ulterior motives. Always."
"Dean likes twenty year old brunettes!" Sam points out and Castiel looks to Dean.
"You can't leave me here alone!" Sam huffs as they pull out of the driveway, "You know they…they…kiss. It's icky!" He crinkles in nose in disgust and Castiel cannot help but think no one pulls off a look of disgust quite like the little boy.
"Cassie!" Gabriel calls, grinning at him, "It looks to me like you just found your next job."
It is not a big fall, and the car doesn't get hurt from it, but Dean would have been. At the sound of the ruckus, Bobby and Rufus run over from their spots to see Dean still lying on the creeper with his legs in the air, firmly held by Castiel.
"Kevin is not old enough to watch you on his own!" Dean groans.
"Do not take the lord's name in vein, Dean. Cursing my father isn't going to get you into my pants any more than pouting is."
Castiel sits beside Dean in the car, a motorized vehicle people use to get around faster than by foot. For them it is a impressive speed, but to Castiel it is slow and torturous. He can firmly say he does not like this mode of transportation one bit. It is relaxing, in a way, but only for a moment or so and then it becomes tedious. There are things to do and this car is slowing them down.
Could he love Dean in that way? He's certainly attractive, an age that is slightly older than Castiel's body, and a height that is a little taller as well. The angel is not short by any means, but around Dean he feels like a child. In both appearance and knowledge. Surely, Dean will not become his own personal Andréa though. Yes, admittedly, he didn't hate Dean being affectionate with him last night. It was strange but it was nice. Dean's skin is soft and he smells quite pleasant, it wouldn't not be the worst thing in the world if he were to fall for someone like him.
"It's lubricant…" Dean begins, looking at him curiously, "You look really confused."
"Alright, if you are going to be staying here…" Dean eyes Gabriel angrily, "Indefinitely, you'll need to sleep on the couch with Cas."
Dean stares at him for a minute before all attempts to hide his smile shatter and he bursts out laughing, having to rest his forehead on Castiel's shoulder. "Oh my fucking god, Cas, you can't be real!"
"Mm…" Dean mumbles, wrapping his arms around Castiel's neck and pulling him down. With his face now in the crook of Dean's neck, he hears the man take a deep breath against his hair. "You smell nice." He points out before rubbing his face into the hair, "Your hair is soft, too."
"For all the problems I have caused."
"This is the last place my family went together before my parents died." He explains. "It's a place I hold dear…" There is a lull in the conversation until Castiel finally speaks up.
"Stupid son of a bitch…" Dean grumbles, "Why the fuck are you in my house?"
Castiel rolls his eyes, "Amazing, Dean, it was amazing."
Dean rolls his eyes, "So if it weren't for that spell you would have destroyed my damned house upon entering?"
This is not good.
Gabriel sits on the boy's bed and plays with his toys. "Huh. That Sam kid is right, this stuffed dog looks a lot like you." He observes, holding up the black and white border collie with bright blue eyes, "Hello, my name is Castiel and I am so emotionally repressed I might as well be a Winchester!" Gabriel teases, using his power to make the mouth of the dog move as he speaks.
Dean rolls his eyes as a woman comes up and he orders a drink, "This place isn't bad, don't be such a pain."
"If I remember right, last time I wasn't cute, something pretty good happened."
"Wooooow, so what are you? A warrior angel?" Kevin asks and Castiel simply nods, "Heh, a warrior babysitting a little boy. That's hilarious."
Dean rolls over, looking away from Castiel. "This is way too much. Yesterday angels were just a myth and now my brother and I have slept in a blanket fort with one."
"That is correct." Castiel affirms and Sam grows uneasy.
"You are Castiel, right?" The teacher asks, smiling at him, "Dean said you would be coming, but never explained your relation to the boy. May I ask what it is?"
He will never forget them, his favorite humans.
The vampire comes to his window and leans in, grinning at Castiel. "Have fun with Dean on your date?"
Chapter Nine: Cas has an idea
"What the hell do you know, angel freak?" Dean hisses, "Why do you need to be here anyways? Send me a hot nanny and everything will be fine."
"Fine. Fine. He can stay a week." Dean grumbles.
"Sorry."
"Yeah, not my proudest moment either." Benny concedes.
"How does is feel now?" Dean asks, his voice low and husky in Castiel's ear, "Good, right?"
"The light around the top of your head."
"So Dean's living with a teenager, huh?" A voice asks from behind and Castiel turns to see a horrifyingly familiar face. Upon looking at Castiel, the man recognizes him as well and his amusement is replaced with caution. "What is an angel doing with the Winchesters?"
Dean goes to yell at him, or maybe kick his ass as previously promised, but he sees the truly guilt ridden look on Castiel's face and it stops him. He's not that big of an ass. "Look, I would have liked this all to of gone much different…" He admits, "But I…I'mgladImetyou…and stuff."
"Find a decent outfit to wear." Castiel adds.
"I know, adults shouldn't be hung up on that or whatever, but I'm only twenty-one. That's barely an adult by this generation's standards. All my dreams have gone, I will never get a degree to take over Bobby's garage now, and the chances of me marrying someone in the future is going to be difficult. Sure, Sam likes you, but he doesn't like just anyone, and I sure as hell won't be with someone he doesn't like." Dean sighs, sitting down on his bed. "There is nothing that can make me happy at this point."
"You are way too easy, Dean!" Gabriel teases as the older Winchester begins plotting ways to kill the archangel.
"Angels will always watch over you, Dean." A beautiful blonde woman tells her baby boy in the privacy of their home. It is not as private as they would believe, however, the blue eyed angel looking down at them muses.
Castiel stares at the small bed with turtles who seemingly perform martial arts on it, "I cannot fit on this." He says and looks down at Sam, "And human rules dictate that a strange man in a little child's room is cause for panic."
It's then that Castiel gets an idea. A truly brilliant idea.
Dean nods and looks at Castiel, "We won't be telling Sammy what happened, understood?"
"Maybe if we add more tomatoes, it will dilute the spice." The angel reasons before Sam jumps up and runs into the kitchen to gather more diced tomatoes. They go about their plan, with Castiel murmuring something into the pot when Sam isn't looking to help dilute the spices. This time, when they sit down to eat, it is much better.
Dean laughs a little before sighing in defeat and heading for the phone, "I'm doing this for you, Cas. I will support your decision to become an awful pimp."
"You seriously need to stop this." Castiel mumbles indifferently before heading downstairs.
It feels good, but it's odd, and rather than losing himself to the pleasure Castiel is watching everything. He's staring at Dean and presumably freaking him out because all of a sudden he reaches out and begins digging his fingers into Castiel's wings, using that as leverage for his thrusts.
"What is in the bottle?" Castiel asks, a little worried it is some strange condiment and Dean might actually think it's a meal. Or perhaps Castiel knows even less about sex than he thought and food is perfectly normal during it.
Castiel frowns at the idea. He has never truly been alone with Dean, and to go a whole 24 hours without Sam seems almost impossible now. However, it is his job to help Dean and do as he wants, so he cannot say anything against the idea. "If that is what you want…"
Castiel and Sam stare at Dean for a few moments before the angel finally speaks up, "What do you mean grown up stuff?"
Castiel looks around, an exasperated look on his face, "If you let me fly us there we would arrive in less than a second."
"Sam," Castiel begins, "We cannot-"
"I must stay for as long as necessary." Castiel says, "No matter when you wish for me to leave."
"Yes, or blender."
"But Dean…"
"It's not-" Castiel begins but Dean quickly shoots it down.
"Hey, you guys!" Charlie calls, "We're still here."
Without a word, not that they could hear him over their arguing anyways, Castiel stands up and walks over to them. He does not grab Sam, no, somehow his hand ends up grasping Dean's should. It's not who he had in mind but he goes through with his plan anyways and effortlessly yanks the man out of their little fight and up to his feet. He would be lying if he said the stupefied looks on their faces weren't amusing.
"Hey, Cas, what are we gonna have for dinner?" Sam asks and Castiel shrugs.
"Thank you so much, Castiel, and Gabriel, to a far lesser extent, for sending Castiel to us. I wish I could have realized I loved you sooner, that I would have stopped being so damn stubborn for five seconds to realize it at a time where we could have been together longer, because I am pretty damn sure you were in love with me too. It's alright, though, because in reality I probably would have just relied on you more if we had become an actual couple. Then I would have been completely lost when you left. So it's alright, I will still always have that last day."
"Is lubricant a sort of condiment I have not heard of?" Castiel asks, "You said this was a meal."
As if it's a date…
"Are you serious?" Dean asks, looking to Sam, "Is he serious?"
"Who the hell are you?" Dean asks in masked horror, reaching out to pull Sam behind himself.
"Sam isn't even in school!" Dean snaps, "And if he ends up in it, I'm not letting him be a dick about it like Kevin is."
"No," Castiel sighs, "No it isn't Kevin…it's…someone…for me…?" He watches Dean tense up, can hear the sound of the bag being crushed in the man's hand.
It's May 2nd and Sam's birthday is today so Dean is having a bunch of people over. Kevin and Benny are here already, the latter on better terms with Sam now. Also here are family friends such as his boss Bobby, Ellen and her daughter Jo, and Ash. Charlie is coming, but she had work so it won't be until later. Everyone has a good time, Ellen offering to watch Sam whenever Dean needs it, Benny teaching Sam a magic trick with a coin that the boy proceeds to do again and again. Soon though, Ellen, Jo, and Ash have to leave for opening up the bar Ellen owns.
"Hey, Cas, you got the milk!" Dean exclaims when Castiel enters the house, "Oh good, you got 2%. I got worried, since I didn't tell you what kind to get…" He stares the angel down, "You don't look too hot. Don't tell me you did something ridiculous like sample all of the milk, drinking all of that at once can make you sick. Or, well, it can make a human sick."
Castiel looks at him confused, "Why? Your brother is making food."
"He likes me, I should come too!"
Castiel raises a brow, "How…would a woman who has a temperature help make you happy?" He asks, genuinely confused at the way humans minds work.
"Mm," Castiel agrees, "But Dean is a truly good person. One cannot help but be charmed by his awkward ways."
"Cas, dude, you okay?" Dean asks and Castiel sees the concern in the man's expression. He is such a selfless man, Castiel would be awful to deny him this chance.
"Fort! We can build a fort!" Sam suggests, now bouncing on his heels. "Blankets and pillows, Dean! Please!"
"I thought I had more time yesterday," Castiel admits, "More time to mull over the idea. Today I decided, though, that I wanted to do this with you at least once before I go. You can never forget the one time you've had sex."
"The great warrior has become so domestic!" A familiar voice teases from behind and Castiel turns to see non-other than Gabriel.
"It isn't just her anymore," Benny points out, "I love Dean as well. And Sam, even if he doesn't like me."
Dean frowns, "So…he has to leave…or forfeit everything he is…"
"It's true, I do." Castiel agrees and Dean glares at him.
"You guys are going to have so much fun today!" Sam teases, earning him a harsh look from Dean.
"I do not need to know." Castiel says, "It would be against the rules after all."
"I'm fairly certain your brother would try to kill me if I said yes."
"That is not what she is thinking you are, you stupid little-!" Dean begins, getting cut off by Gabriel.
Dean pops the bottle open and places some of the liquid on his fingers, "This is to help things go where they should go." He brings his fingers down and slowly slides one inside of Castiel. "See? There would be a lot more resistance without it." Taking his time, Dean prepares Castiel and after a while they are having sex. Awkward, out of synch, sex.
"Indeed."
"Patience is a virtue." Castiel adds, making Dean laugh for some reason.
"What is a vampire doing with humans?" Castiel counters, giving the man, presumably Benny, no time to answer before he pins him to a wall and shoves an angel blade against his throat. "All of you are supposed to be locked away in hell."
"Oh please you're the one who annoyed him."
"You can spend time together after work." Dean says as Castiel looks to Sam.
Sam pouts, "That's not fair! I wanna spend the day with him!"
"Castiel is different! He's our angel!" Sam pouts, "Benny is some weird guy you got into trouble with in high school."
Castiel shakes it, staring at him confused, "Placement in what?"
The rest of the ride is done in silence, save for the noises coming from the toys Sam is playing with in his car seat. Apparently teasing Dean with Sam around will not be plausible. Castiel should have known Sam would want something like that. Little children want families, no matter who they are composed of. They need people who love them and take care of them. One works just fine, as many single parents prove, but when given the prospect of two most young children far prefer that.
"I have no problem meeting your friend Benny." Castiel says and Dean scowls.
Picking up Sam. Filler. I'm so sorry.
"My new big brother!" Sam says happily, "He lives with me and Dean so Dean can be happy!"
"For the last fucking time! It! Is! Not! A! Date!" Dean hisses as Sam screams.
"Oh, right, tomorrow night then. We'll spoon tomorrow night."
"I have no interest in dating," Castiel explains, "But Dean needs someone. He likes brunettes in their twenties, you seem to fit that."
Kevin laughs a little, "Don't worry about it! I cook all the time! We'll start with something simple like stir fry." He suggests, going through cupboards and the fridge for ingredients. Lining them up, he places the steak in front of Castiel while he works on cutting the vegetables. "Cut the meat into small strips."
Castiel quickly shakes the idea out of his head.
"Well, it was. Do you know why?" Dean asks, making the angel shake his head no, "It's because I know what he really meant in his prayer to you. As soon as you told me, I knew. Before you got here, since our parents passed away, I have been drinking a lot outside of work." He sighs, "Kevin was helping take care of Sam while I sat in the living room angsting. I couldn't help him with the pain he was going through, and he wouldn't let Kevin, so instead he busied himself with learning from Kevin. The kid is so bright, he had a good grasp on language before, but since Kevin started teaching him he knows bigger words and talks as he does now. You would think that was a good thing, but every time I hear that little lisping voice say a big word or a complete sentence it kills me a little inside."
"You don't believe that." Gabriel's eyes narrow at the man, "I am an angel, Dean. An archangel at that. Lying to me is useless." He sighs and sits back on the couch. "You are perfectly capable of finding happiness, in fact you already have, right?"
"Damn, this isn't how I saw today going," Dean groans, sinking into the park bench, "We were supposed to talk and hangout as friends there were literally no thoughts of love in mind. I mean, sex was considered…but…that's different."
"Angels are allowed to have sex, Dean, carnal pleasure is enjoyed by all beings." Castiel explains, trying to hide his nervousness. Just because angels can doesn't mean he wants to. Sex seems messy and cumbersome.
Can they see him at all times? Do they know what he's thinking? Can Castiel bring them down for a while? Can Castiel send them a message? Are they the ages they died or did they take on a younger looking appearance? (Not that it much matters, since they were both attractive by human standards when they passed.) And then, Castiel's personal favorite which was the final nail in the coffin that is the tension in the household; why won't you break the rules for me?
Sam smiles, "Yeah!"
"…So mommy brought me here?"
"Me."
"There is no tree branch in my rectum, Dean, do not be crass." Castiel gawks in disgust. "Some of the things you say are abominable, it makes me wonder about you humans."
Angels in the Kitchen
"Just who exactly is the awkward one?" Dean grumbles as he comes to stand on the other side of Sam. "At least I can be alone in a house without needing some nosy little high schooler to help me." He points out and Castiel goes to say something, "If you mention his advanced placement one more time I swear to god I am leaving you at Benny's as well."
Sam frowns, "Alright…" He mumbles, wrapping his arms around Castiel's neck and pulling his head down and turning his cheek to Castiel's lips. Castiel smiles at the gesture and kisses the boy on the cheek, before receiving a kiss on his own. "I'll see you again, then."
"It's not a date!" Dean says firmly, "Don't you dare go around telling people it's a date!"
Dean stares at him for a moment, as if figuring something out, "…You say that as if you accidentally destroy things a lot."
Since Castiel let it slide that their parents were watching them he has been bombarded with questions from an angry Dean.
"…Happy?" Castiel frowns, "A warrior does not need to be happy, and fulfillment is reached for us when we have done our father's orders. We live for others, not for ourselves."
A/N: Well this isn't what I had planned for this chapter.....but...oh well. Those plans will just be put in effect next chapter.
"What? Can't visit my baby bro?" Gabriel asks and Castiel frowns.
"Make me, little boy." Gabriel taunts and Dean glares.
"Who is this?"
"Oh yes. Definitely." Dean says, smirking at Sam, "What do you think, Sammy?"
They finally reach the door and Dean just stares at him.
Dean lets out a long suffering sigh before looking to Castiel, "You are easily the most exhausting person I have ever met."
"I don't pay much attention to that kind of stuff?"
"I want…this…even if it's just once, but I can easily stop if you want to." Dean says, making Castiel laugh a little.
"Isn't everyone equal in the eyes of god?" Dean mocks and Castiel already feels exhausted. Since Kevin came over a few days ago to help the angel out, Dean has been far more snarky and short tempered with Castiel. He isn't sure why, but he knows that it is thinning out his patience.
But what if Castiel was female? Would Dean be attracted to him?
"Oh, well, that sucks."
Castiel panics and quickly moves forward, taking a bite. As soon as he does his eyes widen more, watching Dean's cocky smirk while he enjoys the strange taste. It's soft and sweet and amazing. Once he swallows it he licks his lips, tasting the syrup still on it. "This is good."
"It appears we have reached an impasse."
"I'm not making those a habit, Charlie. It was a one-time thing." Dean groans, "But bring him in, I'm interested in meeting your weird dreamboat."
Castiel looks down at him curiously, "I still do not believe I will fit on your bed."
"Anyone who is related to Cas is family, because Cas is family." Sam explains before lying down on the pillows and blankets laid down in the fort. "Sleepovers require pizza!"
"Look at that, he's not useless."
"Allow me to show you a few tricks, sir." She teases and Castiel, for once in all his years, curses his youthful appearance. Had his body looked more grown up he would no doubt be receiving far more respect right now, rather than being treated like an awkward little child.
"Both of you shut up right now or I am turning this car around and we are spending the day with Benny." Dean threatens, making Sam and Castiel gasp in unison before going completely silent. Doesn't stop Sam from glaring, though.
He can't help but contemplate the idea of falling in love with a human himself. Certainly Castiel loves humans. There is no doubt in that. They live for such a short time, yet in that lifetime they live far more than angels do in their however many millennia in heaven. Lives filled with such joy and pain, triumphs and losses. They know true sorrow and true joy, whereas angels tend to live on mere indifference for the most part.
Castiel pauses, halfway through helping Sam out of his shirt, and stares at the water, "Your faucets make no sense to me." He admits and Kevin laughs a little.
The woman laughs and comes closer, looking into the fridge, "Hmmm…most people prefer 2%, if that helps."
"I had very little." Castiel teases, earning a shoulder bump from the older Winchester.
They pick up Sam, who tells them about his day on the car ride home. Once inside Sam takes Castiel's hand and runs him to the living room so they can watch some children's show as Dean makes dinner. He should be watching Dean make dinner, but the man said to go with the boy, so watching the cartoon will be his priority today.
"I might love you…" Dean says in a whisper, more to himself than anything, but Castiel hears it.
"You too!"
Sam crosses his arms and glares at Dean, "Meany face."
"They do not go bump in the night anymore, Dean," Castiel begins, "They no longer see the night from hell."
"That is correct, but if you want to keep me a secret, coming into work the day after being crushed by a car would not be the best way to go about it." Castiel mumbles, now watching Dean's body beneath the car. He is fit, and would probably have made an excellent warrior had he been an angel. His determination and self-sacrificing ways would prove quite useful on a battlefield. Of course he should not look at Dean in such a way, he is a normal human being, not a warrior. The days of war are over and Castiel must adjust to this fact.
Castiel looks at her in horror. She knows not to tell anyone, does that mean she is aware he is an angel just from that small amount Sam said? Teachers are far more intelligent than he had imagined.
"Shut your damn mouth!" Dean turns and punches him again, making the angel lose it. Castiel grabs the coat Dean is wearing and easily slams him up against the adjacent wall, making sure to be gentle about it so he doesn't kill him.
"You don't take showers?"
Castiel looks away, "I'm not attached."
He is not going to realize something like this right before Castiel leaves him forever.
"He's right, sleepovers do indeed require pizza." The older angel says before they all hear the front door open.
Sam smiles up at him, "I like to think so!"
"Don't call him that!" The younger angel scolds, "And don't curse! You are an angel of the lord!"
"Need some help?" A voice calls and Castiel turns to see a beautiful woman with long brown hair. "You look a little lost."
"Who wants to be human when they can be angels? Castiel used to be so powerful and indifferent. He was the embodiment of a warrior. Magnificent, really." Gabriel boasts. "Why would he want to go from that to being a mild mannered little human?"
"Twenties is young adult, not teen."
Castiel sighs in defeat and smiles at Sam, "I suppose you're right." He carries Sam the rest of the way, going as slow as possible to ensure Dean arrives home first. Although the two elder brothers alone has its own complications.
"I am here to help him, I believe meeting him is imperative to that wish."
It is not his place to choose Dean's route in life, so he must give him this paper. It is important that Dean is happy. Sam will be happy, too, which has also become important to Castiel. He is simply being selfish, there are important things for him to do in heaven as well. Probably.
"That is not-" Castiel begins before Dean takes a forkful of the pancake and holds up the food to the confused angel. "What…are you doing?"
"Oh yeah, that's right…" Dean begins, looking to Castiel, "She wanted to know who you were to Sam, but I couldn't think of anything but a nuisance."
"Andréa is nice…" He admits.
To his horror, Benny is coming with him.
Castiel is truly in awe. In his entire time here he has not seen Sam act so much like a child. He doesn't quite know how people work, so he isn't sure if this behavior is a good sign or a bad sign. Surely a child should be a child, but kicking and screaming cannot be encouraged. It is Dean's job to deal with that, though, so Castiel simply sits on the couch and lets them fight it out.
"You had no faith in me, huh?"
"It's not your job to be pleased, it is your job to imake me pleased/i, isn't it?" Dean asks, staring down the now hurt angel. It is true, he has gotten no closer to making Dean happy. All he has become is a babysitter for Sam in the past few weeks and he still has yet to make Dean Smile or laugh or react in any way towards him other than annoyed or concerned. Not even concerned for his wellbeing, but concerned of the damage Castiel might do to mess up his day.
Once they are cooked he uses the electric can opener to remove the lids before allowing Sam to carefully pour the tomatoes and some water in. That's when they pull out the seasonings. Sam grabbed a lot of them; chili powder, cayenne pepper, crushed red peppers, garlic powder, and oregano. Castiel doesn't know what any of them are, so he allows Sam to put in as much as he wants of each. They wind up with three tablespoons of everything. When it is finished, Castiel allows Sam to set the coffee table in the living room with the fake candles and plates before they both sit down to eat.
warning? another note to John, also, I'm not sure how the process of healing from a trauma like this would go since I've never dealt with it, I think I did alright but if I didn't or if you have any critiques feel free to lmk
During their family movie nights, Dean freely commented on the men and the women, then he rested his arm over the back of the couch and when Cas joined them, sitting under Dean’s arm, he moved in closer, not quite touching Cas, but Sam still shook his head at their ridiculousness. They were hopeless; Cas trying not to breathe the wrong way while Dean wrestled with himself over whether he should just put his arm on Cas’ shoulder or keep it on the couch.
Dean still felt trapped.
On day four, they get together with everyone they know. Eileen and Sam had been texting nonstop, and she was the first through the door. Dean’s honestly surprised they didn’t meet up as soon as they could, they hug so tightly that Dean nearly tears up.
“Cas is right. Everything is gonna be okay.” Sam promises.
A few seconds later.
By the time the sirens are approaching, Sam has taken care of the demon’s bodies and put their weapons back in the impala so they won’t end up in jail. Sam gets them a room at the closest motel, and as soon as Cas has been stabilized, Sam manages to get Dean back to the hotel, promising that if there is any information at all, he’ll call.
“Why?”
Dean teaches Cas to cook and soon enough they’re moving around the kitchen together like they were made for each other. They still haven’t acknowledged it, but Dean puts his hand on Cas’ hip when he goes around him, and Cas lets Dean feed the sauce to him when he taste tests it, rather than simply taking the spoon himself.
“Cas never gets the front. It’s his turn.”
“Settle down?”
“What are you doing?” Cas asks.
“I’m proud of you, Dean.”
Cas stands with Dean and they smile at each other like they were able to finish the conversation with their eyes. Dean smiles at Cas like he’s still an angel, hoping, reaching out, and Cas smiles back like he’s giddy from the closeness, happier than he’s been since the last time they spent time alone together. They stand together and they’re so far apart, it’s only a few inches, but Cas feels the distance between their hands and aches to reach out to Dean. Maybe he’s allowed to now. Maybe Dean would want that too. But Cas is too scared to drive him away. They both end up at Dean’s door, hesitant and hopeful and it’s Cas who opens the door, but it’s Dean who pulls back the covers.
The next few days start off the holiday season and Dean doesn’t want to look at the storefronts, with their stupid christmas trees and candy cane decorations. He doesn’t want to go into the stores so he can look at all the things he would have bought for Cas, had he been alive for Christmas. He doesn’t want to help Sam carry in the too big tree he dragged through the front door and he doesn’t want to help decorate it, so they leave it there, green and empty and making the whole room smell like pine. Maybe they’ll call Jack. Make it a tradition.
And so they both sleep in Dean’s bed that night.
Fifteen minutes for things to go south.
Dean will lay across the backseat while Sam drives the impala back to the bunker, whispering prayers to Jack and blinking through burning eyes.
One night Cas has his head on his pillow, eyes closed, he’s on his side facing away from the door, but he hasn’t slept yet. He hears the door open and he can feel the shift of air. He doesn’t need to look to know it’s Dean. He’s about to sit up when the floorboards creak and the door clicks shut again. Then there’s a dip in the bed and Cas rolls over lazily. Dean stands up again and wipes his palms on his pajama pants.
“It’s okay if it’s just Dean though,” Sam says once Dean is out of earshot. Cas scrunches his eyebrows in confusion.
“Sammy!” he calls, and Sam stumbles over, looking as worried as Dean feels. Sam reaches out for Cas’ neck with two fingers and looks up at Dean, relieved.
“Don’t be. You’ve always done what you thought was best. As have I. We deserve this.” Dean nods, tears springing to his eyes. He steps closer and hugs Cas, holding him like he’s never been held before. Cas could die happily in Deans arms.
“No. Cas. we don’t care, okay? Human, angel, whatever. You’re Cas.”
“I love you too.” Cas says, and he’s already said it but it sounds more real now. Confirmation that it wasn’t all in Dean’s head. Cas loves him. He loves him even when he isn’t about to die. Maybe one day they can have this.
Dean sucks in a breath, trying to get his breath under control. He nods, paces some more, and breathes. He doesn’t want this pain for Sam. He doesn’t want it for anyone. He’d take it all on himself if it meant no one else had to feel it. But Cas didn’t deserve this. Cas might not pull through. Dean would give his life a thousand times if Cas could live.
“He’s got a pulse,”
“I’m not the one in the hospital, man. I feel fine.”
Then he’s leaning in, giving Cas time to pull away, But Cas leans in too, a hand on Dean’s shoulder, and then they’re kissing.
“So you want me to leave then?” Cas says, more of a statement then a question, looking up at Dean with a piercing gaze. Although the bite of the question is there, Cas finds that he’s able to keep his expression blank, unwilling to let Dean see the extent of his emotions. He’s not offended though.
Leave it all behind
The next day, Sam comes home from the grocery store and takes out a pie, the whip-cream on top is pink, purple, and blue and Sam puts it down in front of Dean with a grin.
“Dean?”
“Will it come back?” he asks frantically.
it's not too bad tho (I hope) lmk your thoughts
Eileen and Sam hunt together often, as do Cas and Dean. Dean has to keep reminding himself that him and Cas are not like Sam and Eileen. They are not in love. They aren’t.
There’s a payphone less than a block away and he only has the perfect amount of quarters for one call, so he punches in the number for one of the Winchester’s work phones, the only one he can recite from memory, it’s Dean’s. It rings.
“Dean, sometimes people like that need a little roughing up, don’t go soft on me now boy, that’s no way a man should be.”
Dean doesn’t let him leave. Cas is glad.
“Clearly, you thought you were gonna be dead,” Dean retorts bitterly. “But you can’t just dump that on a guy and then sacrifice yourself,”
“One day.” Dean says quietly. Claire looks down and that’s really all there is left to say.
“I’m not going to apologize for saving your life, again.” Cas says, Dean scoffs, exasperated. “But I should have told you my grace was fading.”
“And the only reason I still have even a shred of hope is because you’re not gone too.” Dean says and through all of the anger in his voice, there is love there. There is fear and grief and trauma, and there is a man who has always cared so strongly that he didn’t know what to do with it.
Still, they haven’t really talked about it. Cas thinks maybe they won’t ever talk about it, and if they do, Cas will be the one talking. He doesn’t expect Dean to be able to reciprocate, not with the life they live.
“What the hell was that?”
Sam looks up at Dean with a blank look.
“For any reason in particular?”
He looks desperate, his eyes hopeful and scared and a little bit angry. His face is the most open Cas has seen from him in a while, he’s letting himself feel, but even more, he’s letting Cas see. He’s still as beautiful as ever. Still Dean Winchester. Maybe this is his breaking point, and maybe he’s already hit his breaking point. Maybe this is the beginning of rebuilding. That makes Cas heart flutter up in hope.
He moves one set of bones into the other grave. It’s just easier that way, he tells himself... at least they can be together here.
“No.” Cas says, but he doesn’t look ungrateful at the offer.
“Good.”
Sam and Cas go over the case while Dean is showering, making sure all the files are in order and getting a head start on some research. Jack goes to his room because apparently he’s in the middle of a Star Wars marathon.
“No, I don’t believe so, I’m sorry,”
“I’m bisexual.” He said to his mirror around his toothbrush. He nodded, grinning, and finished brushing his teeth feeling just a little more free.
Sam, Dean, and Cas head back towards the car, Sam still ignoring Dean in favor of his phone. He’s typing furiously, probably to Eileen, and Dean gives him a side eye behind his back.
“Morning.” Cas grumbles and Dean chuckles.
“He shouldn’t have. “
“You are too, Cas. Worth it…” Dean says, it’s so quiet Cas thinks he’s misheard him. Maybe it was just his imagination. “You’re worth everything.”
“Where are you going?”
“You know it’s not nice to lead people on, right Dean?” Sam raised an eyebrow.
“Sure it doesn’t. Take him to every stupid burger joint you pass, alright?”
Eventually, they get a bigger bed, and Sam moves out. He gets a place with Eileen and they don’t stop hunting entirely, but they settle down enough to ease Dean’s worries. Dean and Cas do settle down for the most part. The bunker becomes kind of a hideout for trusted hunters. People call with questions and Dean and Cas answer best they can. Dean gets a job as a mechanic and Cas starts a garden. Technically, with Charlie’s credit card trick, neither of them needs a job, but Dean thought it would be a good use of time. Plus it makes coming home to Cas feel that much nicer.
“What does it feel like?”
It’s not long before Cas’ wings are unwrapping themselves from around Dean and becoming invisible once again. Cas, stands up, and then pulls Dean up too, both of them stumbling from the sudden energy of the sigil. The room is silent, save for Dean’s breathing and the rustle of Cas’ trench coat.
Dean thought he could get away with just sliding out of the closet, until he finds Sam scrolling through some sort of pride website. Sam looks up at Dean guiltily, closing his laptop and folding his hands on top of it. Dean sighs, takes a large swig of his drink and sits down.
“Don’t tell him I told you, alright?”
Cas kissed him back, and when they were holding hands, walking shoulder to shoulder back to the car, Sam only grinned, making a mental note to tell Dean how proud he is.
Cas can’t take another sip, not wanting to wash away this grief with liquor, but not wanting to feel anything.
“He’s fucking sick.”
Dean isn’t an early riser, but now that Cas sleeps it’s been discovered that Dean is an early riser compared to Cas. Either way, Dean has coffee ready for Cas when he wakes up. Sam goes out with Eileen sometimes, and on those nights, they make sure Jack is settled for the night early and Dean pulls out convenient store pie and puts on Zeppelin, and it isn’t a date. Not at all. But what else could it be?
It was something they never said. Never dealt with. Never acted on. It was something they simply couldn’t have, at least not alive. Not with this life. But they loved each other on a foundation of rebellion and devotion.
They pull into the parking lot of a small park, it’s empty due to the cold weather, but Cas is sitting on one of the benches, his back to the road. Seeing him, coat rumpled and hair messy as ever, makes Dean’s heart stop so bad he nearly crashes the car. He almost doesn’t even care.
“Cas,”
“Does he know?” Sam shrugs, as if that’s all there is to it.
“Good for you, Dean.” Sam smiles.
He pushes all those thoughts away from him. His father, the case, Cas, Sammy, Jack. The people he’s killed, the people he couldn’t save, the feeling of his body being taken over by a cosmic entity… he pushes it all away until his mind is carefully blank. All that remains is the feeling of the hot water on his sore muscles and soap stinging his eyes.
He had left Cas standing there, crestfallen and alone, because he couldn’t accept the fact that someone cared about him for real.
“It is. I need you Cas. I’ve always needed you, always will. I’m not just talking about saving the world either.” Dean says, somehow managing to keep eye contact with Cas the entire time. “I don’t know how I’m supposed to top what you said…”
“Oh,” Sam says, “Well that’s nice, Cas. I’m happy for you,”
“Career? Love… all of it?” Dean rubs a hand down his face, he doesn’t want to bother her, but she looks kind, “I’ve always had a purpose, a responsibility, and now… we’ve taken care of it, we’re free. I’m not sure what to do now.”
“I know. But I don’t want you to, okay? No more ‘happy to bleed for the winchesters’ shit, got it? You don’t deserve that. I’m not gonna ask that of you, not if I don’t need to. You gotta take care of yourself, man. I appreciate it, but I’d rather have you alive, so no more sacrifices.”
“Not too bad. We got that ‘67 we got your tail lights from for parts. Engine’s pretty much intact and in good shape. I’m going take a closer look, but it might just be cheaper to give you the rebuilt engine. Looks like your head gasket is about to go too.”
Then he tried to pull away from Dean again, but Dean hugged Angel tightly, willing him to just be still for a little while longer. He knew that sometimes Omegas could be a little uncomfortable in that regard when they were knotted. Depending on the position, an Alpha’s knot might be pressing right into the Omega’s bladder, making them feel like they had to go. But at the same time, they were joined together and it wouldn’t be pleasant if they were torn apart. Dean had heard of an Alpha that broke his knot that way. He shifted them a little so that hopefully, Angel wouldn’t feel so much internal pressure on his bladder.
“So, I understand the tornado made pretty good work of your Hall,” Ishim said. “Seems like a clear judgment and manifestation of the Goddess’s will to me.”
“Do you remember the day we met?” Castiel asked.
“I did. Read the rest.”
“I thought so too,” Dean said. “Not so much. He worked through dinner with Hannah and didn’t even talk to me most of the time. There wasn’t anything I could really eat. Not unless I want my gut exploding on me again. It was all cheese and stuff.”
But it was fine. Their lips did not touch. Jimmy had not been aiming for those, but instead, he kissed Dean on the top of the head, like a father might kiss a child he was comforting. It was exactly the same kind of kiss Castiel had seen Jimmy place on Claire’s little head hundreds of times. Jimmy pulled out a handkerchief and blotted Dean’s face dry just like he would dry any child’s face when they had been weeping.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nor do I. I never have. If we followed their customs and laws, the most valuable members of our pack would have been cast out at presentation. Can you imagine a pack without Bess or Andy or Iver or you? I cannot. A pack loses so much when they don’t value their Omegas. Let’s go in, shall we? Sooner we do this, the sooner we can get you home.”
He had made his way over to the exit where more trays were being brought in. Whoever had planned the meal hadn’t taken group service into mind. Everything was individually portioned, had to be passed out one by one, plus each item was small. There were many tiny courses and plates. It was chaotic and going to be messy and extra work for the dish crew tonight. Dean would never plan a simple weeknight dinner like this if it were up to him, feeding a crowd that was mostly teenagers. Big, hungry Alpha teenagers.  Dean would have picked only big family style dishes that could be passed at table, so no one would be left serving for long. Dean surrendered his tray to someone and some young Alpha, Dean thought it might be Kirsten this time, was about to put another full one into Dean’s hands when Meg appeared like some kind of avenging demon.
It wasn’t that Dean didn’t think he’d like Omega style clothes. They just weren’t what he was used to and they weren’t practical. They were expensive and delicate. The clothes he wore were ones left here by his father or the Alpha style clothes that could be bought readily and cheaply at a thrift store. Yeah, he might have looked on in envy at the kind of Omegas who could afford nice clothes, but it just hadn’t been realistic for him.
“Ma?” Dean asked the woman with cropped hair. “I was going to take my Alpha here home. You think you can get a ride home with Sam and his platoon?”
“Love you too.” Dean said and got back to work washing the shelves.
She moved the heavy iron pot back to the hearth near her wood stove, then grabbed a pouch from a shelf. The pouch was old and worn leather, covered with odd symbols and a five pointed star in a circle, kind of like the Marshal’s badge, only without the eagle on top of it. It looked powerful somehow, but maybe evil too. Definitely like the kind of thing a witch would use. She reached inside and pinched out a little bit of dust in her fingertips, then she blew on it like you’d blow out a candle. The dust clouded up and shimmered in the air in front of Dean. In the afternoon sun coming in the windows, the dust motes hovered and danced in the air and slowly gathered to illuminate a beam coming from out of Dean’s chest and shooting out to the northeast. It shone like a sunbeam, brilliant and warm. Was that where Castiel was now, he wondered?
“Of course,” Castiel said. “We will grow our own apples if you would like. There’s a spot down by the fence line that I’ve thought would make a good place for an orchard.”
“Are you charging her with some kind of conspiracy?”
“There’s no need for you to be jealous,” Dean said, soothingly. “What me and you are to each other, Cas can’t ever have. You’ll always be my baby brother and there’s no one in this whole world I would put in front of you. But you gotta understand Sammy, what me and Cas have, you and me can’t have, because you’re my baby brother.  You know I can’t be your Omega, right? Because we’re brothers.”
“We keep a group house in Folsom if they want to live more independent. Or they set out on their own if they want. We don’t force anyone to stay, but the group home makes it easier on them. Safety in numbers. Some set out on their own. Most come back.”
He had almost given up completely, some weeks after that when the constant ache in his chest, diagnosed by a shaman named Sergei who travelled with the show sometimes as pining sickness, had flared up into immense pain. A sick, vertiginous pain, like he was about to stumble off a cliff into some chasm of agony and that there was nothing he could do about it. It lasted but moments and then faded back to the ache of before. Later Sergei told him it sounded like his One had been attempting to uproot the soul cord joining them and either stopped or not succeeded. He’d despaired after that. He thought it was right. Dean should have cut the cord and freed himself from Castiel. He deserved better than a man like Castiel. He’d never felt that kind of pain again. Dean never again tried to separate them.
Then Dean walked away himself. He had preparations to make. Before long, he found himself at Crowley’s livery stable. Crowley, the self styled ‘king of horse traders,’ was trying to cheat Dean blind, demanding ten times what Impala was worth.
“I’ll organize it,” Pam Barnes said. She owned a business in Folsom and lived on the pack lands, commuted back and forth every day. It would be easier for her to get back and forth to the hospital. “Does the kid have comfort items that haven’t gotten to him yet?”
“Again, I am aware of the risks. I have done my research. It seems negligible compared to the other very real risk I am facing of being forced into a convent.”
It was provoking though. They weren’t just tie dye print. They were pastel tie dye, pink and yellows and stuff. Dean didn’t say anything though.
Today was a warm, early summer day. Dean was six months pregnant and didn't see why he needed to sit through his math tutoring, so Cas had sent the tutor home and attended to Dean's lesson himself.
“How so?”
Sometime, just before he would have started dinner, Michael came back. He was carrying a large bouquet of blush pink roses that he held out to Dean. “Darling, I’m so sorry. I lost control. It will never happen again,” he said. “I just want to lift you up out of all of that. I don’t want to you ever have to think about your father again. The car just reminds me of how awful your life was before we met.”
“I have tried and tried and I don’t know how I could possibly make him happy,” Castiel said as he reached the door. He stepped out into the bright daylight. It was blisteringly hot outside and he couldn’t stop himself from loosening the borrowed tie and dress shirt. This summer heat was not something he tolerated well.

She’d had it tied up just this morning, but since then, she had taken the shears to it herself and cut it short almost to her chin. It hung in loose, almost curly waves that danced when she turned her head and bounced with every motion. It suited her but it was shocking on a woman her age. It made her look a decade or more younger, almost like she was about his age.
