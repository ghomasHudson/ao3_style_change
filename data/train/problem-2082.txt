She takes his hand. “We’re going to find him, John. No matter what it takes.”
John listens in as Gabriela greets Irene enthusiastically. He can hear Irene’s reciprocal response, the kisses to one another’s cheeks. Gabriela offers her a drink, and she accepts; they continue idle chit-chat as she prepares it.
That’s when it occurs to him that Stamford is still waiting. He curses to himself, splashes water on his face, and throws on his shirt before returning to the table.
Sherlock kisses a few words of his own:
"With my eyeballs."
Sherlock grins. "Did I win?"
Short breaths come between kisses; between happy noises and the tiny murmurs of each other's names.
“Yes, John?”
Feeling the fierce urge to express his gratefulness, he bends forwards, wrapping his arms around Brook’s shoulders. He has never hugged anyone on purpose before—he wonders if he's doing it correctly. It feels odd. Odd, but nice—especially when Brook lifts his arms loosely in some semblance of returning it.
If frustration is, in fact, what he feels. Of course, it would also be helpful if he could figure out his feelings. He thoroughly enjoyed everything that happened between the two of them in their heated moment of passion—that’s definitely not the problem. John’s snogged men before. He’s enjoyed intimate moments with many types of genders.
John feels a gigantic wave of relief surging through his body, and he hopes the resulting smile on his face isn’t as obvious as it feels.
A breeze passes. John hears Sherlock’s footsteps behind him—he would recognise the sound of them anywhere.
"Oh, Sherlock. No—I'm not judging you." John makes a heroic attempt to catch his breath. "But give me a moment to process the news, alright? It's not every day I wake up in a hospital bed married."
“I thought about it. And I decided it would be best that I stay here,” Sherlock explains. “This way, I’m around if you need anything. Also, I lied. The sofa is very, very uncomfortable.”
looms just below the door frame, and takes up nearly a third of the door’s height. Beneath is the letter
I was incredibly lucky to know the right people to help me do so without suspicion of intent.
“...Yes.”
"John," Sherlock says, on whatever day it is, while sharing his bed.
Sherlock gives him a solitary nod. Oh, he's truly got no idea what he's doing. No idea at all. But with John as his partner, it's a mystery he's very keen on solving.
"So what's John's knob like?" Molly asks casually as she places a heap of tentacled seafood onto her plate.
"I think a drink might be good for you, Sherlock," he concludes. "It would be healthy for you to relax and have a bit of fun. Besides..." he pulls himself from the floor. "That floor must be murder on your spine."
On a peaceful evening in February, Sherlock leaves Baker Street on his own to go out and prevent a murder. (This is his first mistake, according to John.) The would-be murderer: Mrs. Mila Petrova. Thirty-six years old. Wife of Nicolai Petrov, the London Symphony's principal contrabass player. Mrs. Petrova has recently discovered that Nicolai is romantically involved with Ai Lin, the symphony's harpist, blah blah, she's definitely going to kill them both.
John clenches his jaw, sighs, and continues waiting patiently and helplessly until every other customer has been served. Finally. But rather than returning, William crouches behind the bar to retrieve a black wool coat and a pack of cigarettes.
John bursts into laughter. "Bears, eh? I don't think we've got to worry about bears on African safari."
,” Sherlock says. “It isn’t as though I'm going to...tear off your trousers, one-handed, in a fit of unbridled passion, while you’re scrolling through Gmail." He momentarily regards John's wardrobe. “...Especially not those corduroy trousers that I’m fairly certain my father also owns.”
"You've got the best truths, John,” Sherlock says. "Even after all the head injuries.”
“I don’t know,” John says hesitantly. “I’m really very tired, and my muscles are still sore from all the walking I did earlier."
"What? How could you possibly—?" John throws his hands into the air in a gesture of resignation. "No, you know what? Forget it. I was wrong; you're quite bad at this game."
all the way from his hips to the tips of his toes.
Sherlock’s not entirely sure how much kissing between himself and John might be considered a lot, as his only frame of reference is prior to a week ago, when the number was never. And though one might think performing a single activity for hours on end would become tiresome, this is not the case at all—John is a professional, and he knows how to keep it exciting.
The door cracks open and John peeks in. "Yeah, hi. Sherlock, I, erm, look—“ He trails off mid sentence, gaping at Sherlock, who is sprawled across his bed, fully clothed and ready for sex.
“S-sorry?” John sputters. “Oh. Name’s John. What’s yours?”
At that exact moment, a morning bird starts to sing, and a ray of sunlight pours in from behind the clouds.
John nestles his cheek against Sherlock's cool one. Sherlock's skin is so soft that it nearly causes him to shiver.
Next up: the boys head to the party. Mrs. Hudson bakes brownies.
John is annoying. -SH
"Goodnight, John."
"What? Haunt me?"
"...Mycroft?"
"Your impertinence is tiresome. We're leaving," Sherlock announces, taking John by the arm. "Let's go."
When John finally slows to a sputter and comes, he whispers Sherlock’s name hoarsely into the cool, damp skin of his neck.
Soon, their drinks are mixed and their glasses are filled. Both have been made with meticulous care, taking into account factors like weight and height and what they've eaten today—to achieve the most satisfactory blood alcohol levels.
“Was I?” John brushes a curl from William's forehead. “Felt much longer.”
“There may be an app for it, you know,” John states one evening over Thai curry. “They make an app for everything these days.”
Sherlock smiles down at him, the unbridled fondness in his eyes boldly apparent, even in the dark. “Watson." His voice, barely above a whisper, tickles John’s mustache. “I would kiss you right now, but I fear I may become ill as well. And who shall take care of you then?”
“Oh my god. I’ve gone mad.”
Brook frowns, pressing his lips together. "Right. The Oxford Murders."
He doesn’t turn to kiss John goodbye, nor glance in his direction, for there is danger in biding time. In this shared bed of theirs, the sight of John’s naked body—draped in moonlight and thin cotton sheets—would rob Sherlock completely of his ability to leave.
Sherlock throws his hands up to cover his face.
"John, why aren't we talking?"
“I suppose I’ll settle in now,” he says. “Thanks.”
Although they forgo their typical evening routine, they eventually fall into their natural form: John’s face in the curve between Sherlock’s neck and shoulder, Sherlock’s chin resting atop John’s head. Between this, and stolen kisses, and flirtatious grins and hushed laughter—they slowly retrieve their clothing, piece by piece.
But this can’t be Mary. John does not recognize her. Her eyes are cold and grey like a muddy lake, and she looks upon the body of her victim—their beloved Sherlock—with absolute indifference.
"Journey? What, like the band?"
Gabriela laughs gently. “You were out like a light. You’ve got a bit of drool, there. Would you like a tissue?”
“...kissable,” he finally replies.
They lock eyes. John goes in for the kill, approaching William swiftly, honing in on him, crowding against him, stopping only when their lips are so close that the two men breathe the same air.
The air in the alleyway behind the restaurant is heavy, still, and silent. Too silent. John’s got nothing to distract him from the flitting of "should haves" and "why didn't yous" in his brain.
The next thing he hears is Irene’s voice whispering into Gabriela’s ear. “You can’t see it because of the blindfold, but I’m wearing my favourite strap-on. I’m going to slide into your wet pussy and pump into you, hard. And I’ve had a lot of practice, so I’m going to fuck you until you’re coming so explosively that you see stars.” The sound of a kiss. “Relax,” she says. “And tell me you want it.”
John. Yes. It doesn’t feel like Christmas without John. And in fact, since John got married and moved in with his wife (silly, if you ask Sherlock), 221B doesn’t really feel like 221B.
It begins with an apple.
He’s a med student at Harvard, for fuck’s sake. He can name every single bone in the human body. He’s a fantastic student, and a brilliant diagnostician, and he’s got no fucking clue how to explain what happened last night at The Strand.
John clears his throat. "Yes," he calls out hoarsely. "Come in."
John takes one tiny step. “I’m...I'm going to sit next to you on the bed now,” he explains. “But it's just so that I can see.
It's three in the morning, but Sherlock can't pull himself from his sofa quickly enough; he doesn't stop on his way out to grab his coat. He runs to Brook's house as quickly as he can, and once he's there, he bangs on his door loudly enough to wake the dead.
John pulls away and takes him by the elbow, turning his body towards him. "This was your plan?"
The night might be young, but Lestrade is old. While most of them agree to one more activity before calling it in, Lestrade heads out because he’s got work in the morning.
"Google it, love.” She peers up at him and rises from her chair; she’s at least a foot shorter than he, yet quite intimidating when she wants to be. “But first…tell me more about last night with John! Please?"
John glances again at the clock on the wall. It’s a quarter past two in the morning, but his mind doesn’t rest; it seems to be clinging to the events of the day.
"The police are arriving," Sherlock acknowledges.
Irene chuckles breathily. “Only if you beg.”
"Ubi amor, ibi dolor," chants an unfamiliar voice. "Ubi amor, ibi dolor."
"Stop!" Sherlock yells at the device. "I’m begging you!"
those props? Didn't you say Albany was stabbed?"
“I was wondering how you might feel about us acquiring more costumes,” he asks suggestively. “You know. For purposes...not related to Halloween.”
John continues to kiss him wherever his lips will reach—he’s so very relieved, so happy to be holding him, and he’s not going to let him go.
"John. Sweetheart," Gabriela says, pulling herself up from the floor. "It's okay. It’s fine.”
"Oh, honey, stop," Molly interrupts. "John has been mad about you since he met you. For someone so observant, you are awfully blind."
John grows restless, tapping his fingers over his forearm. “Isn’t it?”
"It's not me you'll need to convince." John nods towards the door to the hospital corridor. "It's them. The nurses. The doctors. The residents. Even the custodians—you
Sherlock crinkles his nose in confusion. “Why?”
“Yeah,” John agrees, because he’s too tired to argue.
Even surrounded by people, John feels lonely.
“No! Don’t go!” John pleads. He then peers at the tall, silent shadow figure looming in the doorway. He stops using his voice, dramatically mouthing one word:
Tonight is not a night to face feelings.
"This is how it
And yet, his friend sits in his armchair across from him, gaze unwavering, sapphire eyes twinkling as though he said it on
"I'm John's husband,” Sherlock responds.
In his sleepy haze and such unfamiliar surroundings, he’s briefly unsettled—but as soon as he sees Sherlock’s head in his lap, he remembers he’s exactly where he’s supposed to be.
Sherlock tilts downwards to hear what John's trying to say. John doesn't say anything. Instead, he sets a hand on the side of Sherlock's face, nudges him closer, and encloses the space between their mouths.
Mycroft leans away, releasing John’s hand, giving him an unveiled look of disapproval. “It isn’t over yet, Watson,” he says. “Far from it.”
“Never better,” Sherlock replies.
Molly stares blankly at him for several seconds. Then, she breaks into a fit of giggles. "Oh, boy. I should have paid more attention during organic chemistry! I’m sorry, Sherlock.”
“Oh, stop.” Mary pulls her hands away, but isn’t angry. “If the tears start now, they won’t stop, and that would be a terrible waste of everyone’s time.” She opens the door. “Let’s go.”
As Sherlock steps beneath the water, John lowers his gaze. He unabashedly watches as water collects at his collarbones, pours over his chest, and trickles over his body, down past his hips and over his thighs.
“It’s fine,” John reassures him. Mycroft seems to bring out a side of Sherlock John’s never seen: sulky and a bit petulant; the superb level of annoyance reserved only for beloved family members.
“For him to read under very specific circumstances,” Irene says firmly.
Amusement mingles with the fondness in John's expression. "Don’t worry. I'm not going to cry."
"Although?"
"There was one, and it was goose-sized."
Next up: The final chapter! A little fluffy fluff. A little smutty smut. And all is right with the world. :)))))
“That must be Greg at the door!” Mrs. Hudson hoists herself off the floor, giving Sherlock and John a covert nod. “He mentioned bringing a friend along. Perhaps someone you know?”
“You know. The kissing thing.”
John is hard in his pants. God dammit. A cocktail waitress walks by and offers him a drink, and he quickly waves her off with an embarrassed “No thanks.”
William sets his hand on the tip of his own cock, so wet that he’s able to lather himself with his own lubricant. He takes it into the palm of his hand and he fucks it slowly, his face twisting with pleasure as John watches on in awe.
Sherlock's apprehension seems to fade. "May I keep it?” he asks. "Your hand."
He squeezes, pulls vigorously up and down, flicks his thumb over their moist slits. Sherlock tosses his head back and moans, exposing the milky-white skin of his neck as he sways with John’s strokes.
"Deal."
“Perhaps not. Neither should you. You can't simply allow someone to force you into a life of exile."
John reaches into his coat pocket. “Just one moment.” He quickly pulls his phone out and snaps a few photos of the door. “This could be a clue."
A small deck behind the house leads the two of them directly into a bedroom. John assumes it's Sherlock's. They're greeted by a cold blast of air upon entering, for which John is grateful. The room is dark; sunlight has been filtered out by curtains. In the corner, John notices something propped against the back of an armchair. “A violin,” he remarks. “I forgot that you play.” He turns, expecting to see Sherlock at his side.
“I wasn’t expecting you to come,” he murmurs, and John wasn’t expecting the sadness in those words.
Sherlock tries to break free from the icy grasp, but drowsiness quickly overtakes him. He falls back into a deep sleep, murmuring John’s name.
“Yeah.” John rubs his own arms for warmth. “Harvard medical school.”
John laughs again.
John awakens the next morning to the smells and sounds of Gabriela and Sarah making breakfast in the kitchen. His stomach rumbles, but more than anything, he needs to go home, and he needs time alone.
Sherlock thinks to himself. But his heart is warmed by his words, and he doesn't even consider correcting him.
“Oh my god, John.” Sarah sits up on the sofa. “Are you okay?”
“William, who’s this?”
William immediately presses a hand onto John’s chest to push him away, the sadness on his face only intensified. "What are you doing?” he hisses. "What if
safety—how can you guarantee your own? How certain can you be that you’ll always be around to save him?”
Strangely, Mrs. Hudson carries on as though the situation is completely ordinary. “Heading out for a case, I take it,” she says. “Past midnight? Rather late. Though I suppose healthy sleeping patterns are generally lacking among the criminally insane.” She clicks her tongue against the roof of her mouth. “They ought to consider getting more sleep—might lower their homicidal tendencies. On that note, I’m off to bed! Goodnight, you two!” And with that, she disappears into her flat, closing her door behind her.
"Wow." John shifts his eyes away, arms falling to his sides. "We
Finally, her gaze lifts, and her eyes catch his. “The string of clues.”
They kiss so much that Sherlock has begun to take chapstick very seriously. His tongue has got such a workout that it could lift weights, or recite a Verdi opera without stumbling over a syllable. Sherlock’s got burn marks on his chin from John’s prickly facial growth, and bruises on his neck from John performing a sensual hoover-like motion with his mouth they are both very, very fond of.
John gets ready for bed the same way he always does; he says goodnight to Stamford as they head to their own bedrooms, looks at himself in the mirror while washing his face and brushing his teeth, and he knows that on the outside, he appears no different.
“I have a talent for doing both at once.” Gabriela leans away, adjusting her dress straps and flipping her long, dark strands of hair behind her shoulders. “Don’t worry, love. I know that Sherlock is our priority, and I promise to honor that.”
As John begins to slow down, he collapses fully onto Sherlock's back.
“Follow me,” John says.
Sherlock crinkles his forehead and chuckles. “Like learning a language?”
“Yeah,” Sarah says. “I saw you there, as well.”
He must have known it would make Sherlock happy—and his happiness was, and is, essential to John’s own.
“John,” he says between panting breaths. “My love. You are both my greatest pleasure and my deepest thrill. You take my breath away. I adore you.”
Sherlock nods and opens his mouth to go on—but he’s interrupted by a loud knock at the door.
“John.”
“John. There's a matter I'd like to discuss with you."
John rolls his eyes. “A simple
The man sets the water onto the table, his eyelids fluttering wearily. “If you believe that Sherlock Holmes is in love with you, you are incredibly foolish. Holmes cares only about his mind. All emotion is abhorrent to him. He referred to it as a grit in a sensitive instrument. A—”
"Actually, your explanation was nonexistent.” John folds his arms over his chest. “You think you can just spring something like this suddenly and expect me to play along? That’s not how it works, Sherlock. Sex between two people... it shouldn’t be used simply as a means to an end.”
"I already forgot what the question was," John lies. He remembers the question, of course; he's just buying himself some time. Because his immediate answer—"I've dreamt of
"Hey.” Anderson's voice carries over from the opposite corner of the room; again, something Sherlock does not care to catalogue,
"That's a shame. I suppose I'm lucky in that regard," Sherlock muses. "My family is relatively unproblematic. Even Mycroft, as intolerable as he is, is a good brother at times."
"Because you're incapable of carrying a conversation."
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “A simple parlour trick,” he says blandly. And it was. Of that, he’s certain. And he will figure out how certain it is. In a moment, once he’s calmed down. Calmed down, of course—not from the unexpected and seemingly autonomous movement of the planchette. Nope. He’s just hysterically thrilled to be here.
He and John have chosen to keep the nature of their relationship mostly private, primarily due to John’s raging danger kink—he finds their marathon sneaky snogging sessions exhilarating. Sherlock is happy to comply; a bit of vigorous wall-kissing never hurt anyone. As for himself, he has kept busy cataloguing the abundance of new sensations.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s likely that most of the time, he goes unnoticed by others. Perhaps he sits besides a mother with her child in her lap on their way to Trafalgar Square. Perhaps he calls for takeout and tips generously, giving them a polite nod and a wave. Perhaps you saw him crossing the street once; or waiting for a lift to the fourth floor. Perhaps he held the door for you while you carried your bags; and then you continued your day, unaffected. You did not run away, nor warn others of his presence.
“Boyfriend?” Sherlock has never been a boyfriend before. “I don’t know. All I know about boyfriends is what I’ve learned from all of yours. Give unsolicited advice such as ‘maybe don’t wear that blouse’ or ‘your eggplant parmesan was dry,’ and never ever ever ever ever ever ever text back.”
John chuckles softly. "As appealing as it sounds to have you...scoop me up...We can’t have you getting hurt as well.”
"Moving to the countryside to keep bees." Sherlock's answer is automatic; he's given this plan some consideration. "But not yet. I'd love to retire somewhere, perhaps Cornwall or Sussex."
"I want you," he says against the shell of John's ear. His voice is sweeter than buttercream. "That's as much as I know. And I know that right now, I have an overwhelming desire to be close to you. And I want to take you to bed. I want to give you pleasure you've never even fathomed, John Watson." He brings his fingers to John's trouser buttons and pauses. "May I do that?"
Sherlock holds him, basking in the sensation of his cheek pressed into his neck, and he forces himself to ignore his aching heart for a few moments longer.
," Sherlock repeats in a mocking tone. "I'm sure the two of you are
“Deductions,” John repeats. “Yes, my dear Holmes,” he says, echoing Sherlock’s earlier sentiment. “I suppose your deductions are correct.”
"Oh," John exhales as he gives in to Sherlock's amorous advances, his shoulders colliding with the wall behind him.
“I feel very lucky to be doing this with you, John.”
John takes in a muted breath of awe. Of course. His first night here. The kiss he thought could only be a dream. He ought to have known that such a kiss could have been real with Sherlock—the man he so deeply loves.
“I’ll be fine.” Sherlock switches off the television and moves himself to stand behind John's chair. He pauses briefly before taking hold of the handles. “So, erm...I've got the handles. And I'm going to turn you around."
“Yeah.” John grins, his eyelids drifting closed. “Best plan ever.”
Sherlock arches an eyebrow. “It depends on what you’re referring to.”
Sherlock opens his mouth, but whatever rebuttal he planned catches in his throat. He purses his lips together and shrugs. "John says many things, you know. But let's not also forget that he was very concussed, and—"
“Please listen to what I say: the human heart is foolish—and sentiment may have gotten the better of us, but this is not a game. I mean it when I tell you this must end here. From the time you walk through that door, whatever your heart tells you to do in regards to me—you must ignore it. Do not succumb to the what-ifs or the fantasies of what could have been. Do not waste another second of your time thinking of me.”
him to. That is all.
He sighs with deep annoyance, looking back at John.
John squeezes back. “I feel...” He takes a breath. “I feel like I want to kiss you.”
Apparently, their final destination is the floor. That’s perfectly alright. Although John wants to take his time and savour the moment, he’s not about to waste another second trying to make it to the other room when he could spend that second making love to Sherlock.
"I mean, not
“I thought so, too. But that evening, Gabriela and I returned home after dinner with friends, and he was waiting on the steps of our apartment building. He was clearly drunk. He told me he missed me, wanted me to come back, tried to wrap his arms around me and kiss me.”
William breaks away so quickly that he nearly stumbles over. John hops down, gripping the bathroom counter, breathing so heavily that he's certain he can be heard by everyone in the bar.
Sherlock's heart skips another beat. "Of course."
“Not at the moment. It feels pretty damn good at the moment, in fact.”
He hides behind a timpani and hurls a mallet at her. She attempts to hurl him out of the window.
For a very short time after the incident with Mrs. Petrova, John doesn't experience much clarity. The events that immediately follow are quite muddled. He’s in and out of consciousness, and there are noises and lights and voices, and it’s difficult to tell what’s real and what’s a dream.
John wraps his arm around Sherlock's waist, bringing Sherlock in towards his warm, bare body, and he kisses him. It's a kiss more gentle than a willow rustling in a summer breeze. Sherlock lifts a hand to John's cheek, cradling it sweetly; he lifts the other hand to John's chin in order to keep him there.
"And the audacious manhandling!"
Sherlock takes him by the shoulders, looks him deeply in the eye, and smiles at him affectionately. “Could you pass me your laptop?"
John’s legs can’t carry him quickly enough as he runs past the lengthy driveway. He reaches the corner of the house and turns. His breath hitches.
John halts. “Pardon?”
“I do,” Sherlock responds. “And believe me—those words, coming from your mouth, are poetry. I love you.”
what he’s doing.
“I’m sorry, John.” Sarah is now visibly embarrassed. “Oh, I’m a complete jerk—I should have mentioned something before you came here.”
“What’s your name?” he asks.
Sherlock takes John by the wrists, pinning his hands to the headboard and tethering him to the bed. He moves their bare hips until their lengths are parallel, sways and frots against him between panting breaths. Digs his fingers into the hair on John's scalp, takes his cock against his own so greedily it aches.
John's lips are stunningly soft. Sherlock enthusiastically categorises his taste, categorises his scent—even more heavenly when paired with the moans that rumble deep in his throat. It's all overwhelming and insane and wonderful. And though John may be the most unobservant man on the planet, as the kiss becomes more heated, he seems to know exactly what Sherlock wants. He nibbles at his bottom lip, presses his lips to his neck and jawbone, and makes him feel things he didn't know he could feel. A desperate longing he's only heard of, a pulsating beneath his abdomen that his body barely recognises. He never could have guessed how much he needed this—John's mouth on his—god, how could he not have known? If someone had told him three hours ago that he would be kissing his best friend, he wouldn't have believed it for a second.
"Ah." The medic smiles, suddenly pleasant. "Hop in."
John slides his hand into his, and the single act reminds Sherlock that he's not crossing the path alone; he's got John to show him the way.
As natural as it felt for Sherlock to slide his hand into his—this action feels ten times more so. John, wrapping Sherlock into a protective embrace; Sherlock yielding, sliding his hands beneath John's coat to circle his arms around his waist.
Sarah tries to argue, but she isn’t very convincing. So instead, she offers John her guest room for the night. And although he wants to be alone now, he doesn’t know if he has the energy to deal with public transportation.
“What?” John can barely hear him over the pelting rain and low rumblings.
He can't see Sherlock's face, but he knows he's smiling as well.
"I am
didn’t listen to the rules, though. And as the rules clearly state—if you don’t follow the rules—you die.”
John grins, excitement propelling him forward as he steps into the vehicle.
It takes both of them a moment to process what’s just happened; finally, Sherlock peels his lips away from John’s.
"I have the privilege of celebrating our love with you, John. Every hour, every moment of every day, for as long as you will allow—and that, to me, is the loveliest thing of all."
After Sherlock leaves, John sits silently in 221B, though his head is a mess of very loud, very confusing thoughts.
Molly beams, her hair tousled and her eyes brimming with tears. “Yeah. They really are, a bit.”
“Close your eyes, John,” he instructs.
Molly giggles.
“I’m not. But until I’ve got proof, I’ll go to the ends of the earth to find him.” John’s surge of passion surprises even himself, but as he settles into the words, he appreciates their truth.
The sun sets, and the room grows dark—but Sherlock doesn't need to look at John to know that in this moment, he is utterly breathtaking.
He has a profound talent for kissing
“John!” He takes him by the shoulders and shakes him urgently. “Wake up!”
“Yes.”
Sherlock releases a gust of air, part laughter, part contentedness. He turns his head, burying his face into John's shoulder.
Sherlock looks at him, befuddled. “Pardon?”
Now, John is thirty-eight years old, and has kissed more women and men than he can count. But there are times he still doesn’t really know the true message behind a kiss.
John doesn’t understand what’s going on, but he finally feels as though he’s taken the lead in their absurd little game. His smugness moves up a notch. He takes Marci's hand, squeezes it, and whispers into her ear.
.” Sherlock’s hands fall back over his face. “It’s an
John doesn't need to be told again. With a tenderness that's nearly overwhelming—and a passion all the same—he surges forwards, cradling Sherlock's head in his hands as he brings their mouths together.
“Yeah?” John slides his glass over. “What would the manager say? Can I speak to them?”
John begins undoing his collar in a way that could only be described as sensual; and Sherlock can't curb the low, enthusiastic murmur that comes from his mouth. He undoes another bit of the shirt, and then another, until it’s halfway unbuttoned.
Things Sherlock didn't expect to happen at midnight on a Thursday: for John to be kissing him. For John's lips to be so delicious. For his own mouth, stung by the sweetness, to kiss John back—or for his hands to raise to John's cheeks in order to lengthen it. He didn't expect his heart to be bursting with pure joy and relief, or for their night to end with John in a hospital bed. And he certainly did not expect to turn them into fake husbands.
want John following him. But in an unprecedented occurrence, his foot catches on the rug, and he trips, stumbling forwards.
about before they spent all of their time snogging? Has John lost his memory? Has his vocabulary been significantly reduced due to head trauma? Or has John always been dreadfully boring, but Sherlock simply forgot due to his high proficiency in other oral operations?
And perhaps they’ve known all along:
"Oh, hello, boys!" Mrs. Hudson swings the door open. She wears a short black wig and a 1920's speakeasy getup. "Come in! Everyone will be thrilled to see your…erm...costume." Her face noticeably drops. "What are you two supposed to be, then?"
John has to dig his fingernails into the tablecloth to keep from pulling them back.
"It's perfect," Donovan agrees. "Seriously. You two are ridiculously cute together."
John sets out the final container and raises his eyes to him. “You really ought to eat, Sherlock.”
“Oh my god,” he says apologetically. “It’s freezing. Let’s go.”
They arrive at their hotel around half past three. It’s quaint and carries historical charm, set among a broad street of casinos, vendors, and American-style diners. The furniture and walls are definitely aged, but their room is far larger than John had expected—more of a studio flat than a hotel room.
Sherlock knows he came to the kitchen for a reason, but he can’t recall what it was. He’s certain John will be the death of him in one way or another.
Sherlock is safe and protected by his loved ones; that’s another reason to be grateful. And John loves Sherlock, and Sherlock loves John, and there is nothing that can come between them—of that, John is now certain.
“I’m fine,” she says. “I’m fine. I promise. But let’s not cause a scene, okay? Follow me. We’re not far from the hotel.”
“Yes. I’m Sherlock, John’s husband.”
John, for as long as I live, I will find comfort in knowing that you and I can raise our heads to the sky and be looking at the same stars. And somehow, I know that I will find you again, be it in this lifetime or another.
After the nurse leaves, the two of them settle back in for the night. For reasons unclear to Sherlock, they don't continue to practice their intermediate to advanced techniques. They fall asleep the same way the usually do—the way that's become their normal.
One life, or the other? One life, or both?
“Did you mean what you said earlier?” John’s need to know has grown more powerful than his own pride. “To Mycroft?”
He came in and took a seat. We drank tea and made small talk. We didn’t speak about how I’d been the one to turn him in. We didn’t speak about the date of the trial. We didn’t speak about how I already agreed to testify against him in court.
"Why on Earth would you call her
When it does, he goes still and silent, utterly overwhelmed by the pleasure. He releases a long, rattling sigh, his legs quivering as he pours himself into his hand.
Mrs. Hudson pops up out of nowhere, returning with a tray of delicious treats.
“Marci’s with us,” Molly explains. “She works with us, that is.”
“Yeah. And she’s amazing at it, actually. Makes a fuck-ton of money doing it, too. Pretty sure she just does the bartending gig for fun.”
John grins, but his smile quickly fades to a defeated sigh. “I don’t know when we’ll see one another again, Sherlock. But it will happen; you have my word. You’re stuck with me. Wherever you run off to, I’m going to follow. Whenever you fall, I’m going to hold your hand. I’ll scale mountains with you, swim oceans...I’ll hop onto a spaceship to the bloody moon. It doesn’t matter. We’re in this together.”
The moment she leaves, the tension in the air becomes so thick that John feels as though he may suffocate.
"Noooo." Sherlock tightens his grasp. John looking at his phone right now could be very, very bad. "I'll just switch it off."
“Of course.”
"Idiots!" John's face flushes with what Sherlock can only describe as embarrassment. "People have
"Tomorrow's forecast is partly cloudly in the morning, actually," Sherlock says with a cheeky grin. "It will be clear in the afternoon and evening. There's no rain in the forecast."
Sarah hums happily, brushing the side of Gabriela's face with her fingers, and two of them begin to kiss. Not in a friendly way, either.
Sherlock pauses, looking down first at John’s hand on him, and then silently to John.
“We really ought to wrap this up for now,” Brook says, looking down at his watch.
At nine o’clock sharp, John watches Irene walk in through the entrance of the hotel. He barely recognises her. If it weren’t for her scarlet lips and raven-coloured hair, she may have gone right past him, unnoticed. She wears designer shades on her face, and her hair is swept off her neck into a high bun. Rather than her typical corset, she’s in a simple red dress and sheer black stockings.
“Perhaps,” Sherlock acknowledges. “Though I do appreciate the way you’ve been communicating with your lips. I mean, I suppose you always communicate with your lips, since you use them to form words, but I’m specifically referring to the type of communication where your lips and my lips are taking up the same space at the same time—"
"I assumed that didn't matter."
“Right,” he says stiffly. “You’re avoiding the question, then.” He clears his throat before continuing. “Look, I don’t need to know the answer. I don’t need to know your plan, nor do I want to. But whatever it is, you will keep Sherlock out of it. If you put him in danger, he will walk away from you, and I will walk with him. Do you understand?”
It often begins as it does tonight. John, alone his flat after a long day of studying, hand wandering beneath his trousers as his mind wanders to William—the sensation of William’s fingers skimming over his neck. His sweaty stomach and slender hips. His soft moans and heavy breaths; his hardness and the warm, sticky release of their desire for one another.
Their first murder investigation (together, as boyfriends) takes place at a small theatre off West End. The two of them are a tad bit late—John would not take his lips off Sherlock for long enough to get through the front door. But once they finally arrive, they find that much of New Scotland Yard has dispersed, a fact which leads Sherlock to regret ever appearing on time.
“Oh, no.”
"We just held a conversation! Are you happy?"
That’s why it’s an absolute tragedy that he’s thinking about William. He’s got a strong sensation that the bartender’s eyes are on them, and have been for most of the night—though he’s somehow refrained from checking for confirmation.
But the most important part is that there is no kissing. No touching of hair follicles. No words of affection. And usually, for Sherlock, no sleep.
“He doesn’t want me to risk my life,” John continues. “But I’m afraid it’s not his choice to make.”
"Good," Sherlock responds. "Ready?"
“Hungry?” John begins to pull containers of hot food from the bag.
They lock eyes, and Sherlock can feel the blood rushing to his cheeks. He hopes it's too dark in the room for John to notice.
So he steps out of the pub at midnight; hands deep in the pockets of his puffy coat, tongue pasty from the bitter taste of his cocktail. Three years in Boston, and he’s yet to find a bartender who makes a proper Old Fashioned.
Sherlock laughs at him. "I'm sorry. I would have let you know I was going to do that, but I didn't want to overdo it with the narration."
When John wakes again, several hours have passed. It's darker than dark now, and Sherlock is no longer there.
Sherlock thinks he can feel his heart drop down to his stomach. “That’s...that’s all you think this is?”
“Sherlock?” John’s gaze shifts to a framed photograph on Sherlock’s nightstand.
John lets his eyes drift shut as well. This is a path he knows by heart. He simply takes everything in: Sherlock’s scent, Sherlock’s voice, the warmth of Sherlock’s body. He reaches a near meditative state—unaware of how much time passes—until he hears Sherlock begin saying his name.
"Oh, no," he panics. "You're not going to cry, John, are you?" He's never seen John cry. "I haven't the first clue of how to deal with a crying human," he rambles on nervously. "...especially a crying human that I love. What does one do in such a situation? Give a pat on the back? Seems quite useless, given the proximity of our penises. Am I supposed to give you a tissue or a towel? Is there not a tradition in which I offer you a shoulder? Which shoulder do you want?"
"Oh, we're doing this, are we?" John sighs with relief and settles back. "I think I'd bring a fire extinguisher."
“Have fun, you two,” Sarah says a bit wistfully. “Wish I could go, but there’s no way I can take off work with such short notice.”
“What?” John looks over at him and frowns.
Or perhaps he’ll just find a sexy man, throw caution to the wind, and he’ll drink and kiss and fuck until William fades from his memory.
Mycroft opens his mouth to protest, and this is where Sherlock breaks. He lunges forwards, twisting his fingers into the collar of Mycroft’s suit. “
Gabriela pouts.
He moves to stand besides him. "John Watson is my boyfriend! And the best thing to ever happen to me! And also! By the way! He is a very, very talented kisser! He does this insane thing with his tongue that makes me squirm! Every! Time! It's unbelievable! And!" he takes a deep, deep breath. "I love him!"
Sherlock takes him by the hand to lead him upstairs to his tiny quarters. Sleepy and satisfied, they curl up together, and they fall into a deep slumber that seems to last a lifetime.
They simply hold on to one another, nothing more, and it’s absolutely magnificent. There’s something between them, something far beyond words. A glow. An outpouring of light. John can feel Sherlock’s heart beating in his chest, but there’s something else—it’s as though he can feel his
John never mentioned the time he saw Sarah at The Strand with the mysterious man, and he hadn’t intended to. But now that she’s opened up, he feels he probably ought to as well. “I don’t really know how to tell you this, but..." he shifts in his seat. "I’m fairly sure I saw you at The Strand with this bloke—nice suit, dark hair? Arm around your shoulder, whispering in your ear—”
John bursts into laughter, which Sherlock would love to listen to for the remainder of the morning--but regrettably, he must finish what he needs to say.
“What?!” John calls out. "What are you on about? And who calls it a chamber? It's a bedroom.
Sherlock’s chest swells. Although he thought Captain Watson’s authoritative voice was a turn-on, it doesn’t hold a candle to
. Do you understand?”
“John.” He whispers carefully, as if the moment might break.
“Um, sweetheart.” Sarah reaches across the table to take John’s hand. “Have you forgotten that’s she’s, like, in Las Vegas?”
John slides his fingers in further, wriggling them, scissoring them, and working some type of magic that, apparently, only the hands of a doctor hold.
John smiles weakly in return, slowly tucking a piece of William’s hair behind his ear.
‘Tis All Hallows’ Eve—fete of fabrication and fright. A peculiar holiday fueled by stories of ghosts, barrages of candy, and labyrinths of corn. When children and adults (and the occasional domesticated animal) roam the boulevards, assuming false identities and partaking in Satanic rituals. But tonight, things at 221 Baker Street are even more spine-chilling than a rotting gourd with carved-out human features.
"—and I accidentally dropped a few pieces, and a goose darted up towards us out of nowhere? And it scared you so badly that you rolled onto the ground in a fetal position, covering your entire body with your coat?"
“Since day one?” Sherlock’s voice cracks like a pubescent schoolboy. But it’s alright, because John loves him.
Sherlock shakes his head. “Don’t be ridiculous, John,” he says, and then there’s a rustle from the other side of the dumpster. “Did you hear that?” He doesn’t wait for a response before dashing into the alleyway to pursue the sound, and John is close behind.
A weight falls from Sherlock's chest. "Good. All I ask is that if you do cry, you warn me in advance so that I may figure out where my shoulders go."
"Your shoulder. You've been rubbing it off and on for the past couple of hours. Are you hurt?"
Although they've kissed countless times before, this feels like the very first. It is, in a sense. It's John, and it's Sherlock, and it's
"It's been two weeks, Lestrade," John says. "Did I not just say that? Has everyone lost their hearing completely?"
“Yes.” Sherlock closes his laptop and reaches for his scarf.
“Molly.” Sherlock gestures towards the harness. “Is this yours?”
As John’s eyes adjust, he sees a small, round table in front of him, and a tall man with a crooked nose sitting behind it. The man appears to be a police officer, though somehow, he doesn’t really seem to fit the bill.
Gabriela begs for Sarah’s tongue, and John slows down his strokes, taking a deep breath. If he’s not careful, he’ll come before they do.
When they do attempt to converse, the small talk is brutal:
There’s more silence. But John is still very pretty; John still smells very good.
William’s breath hitches. His body becomes tense, but just as quickly, he relaxes into the kiss with a deep, deep sigh. He allows his mouth to fall open as John’s tongue sweeps in. With another heavy breath and a surge of electricity, he wraps his arms around John’s body, scoops John up into him, holds and kisses John with all he has left in him.
"Hello!” comes a woman's voice, bright and peppy, from the other side. "I'm just here to record your vitals."
husband things. He's thinking of John's radiant skin, and what it might feel like grazing beneath all ten of his fingertips. He's thinking of running his lips and his open hands over John's damp chest, and his shoulders, and his abdomen. He's thinking of what it would be like for himself and John to partake in ultimate physical gratification.
"Shut up." Sherlock covers his face with his pillow in hopes of drowning out his brain.
“No!” Sherlock unintentionally flings his water bottle to the floor again. “No need to do that. I was just...worried you'd be cold.”
The man stands in silence next to the lifeless body of Mary, towering above her like a spectre. He doesn’t notice her; his attention is drawn elsewhere.
“Yes.” John nods his head solemnly. “I see what you’re saying. But it’s different now. Things are different. Sherlock is different. And I would never let that happen to him.”
dies. A simple death is far too easy. In this game, no matter what decision occurs between John and himself—one is going to die, and the other will be left behind, inconsolable.
Sherlock glares at her. He and John shimmy through the entryway, Sherlock's hand stubbornly latched onto his. Before he can answer, however, Molly—wearing a superhero costume—leaps from the sofa to greet them.
It all becomes a moot point, however; Lestrade approaches them before John can respond.
Another sigh from Sherlock. He wriggles a bit. "Hand,” he instructs, offering his to John.
It's Sherlock who rips his lips away first. His forehead is damp with sweat; his mouth is swollen from kisses. His eyes are dark, his expression displays only unbridled affection.
“And yet you haven’t seen him since,” the man continues. “He’s mysteriously disappeared, has he not? How are you so sure he’s still alive?”
Next up: (probably not) Ghosts. A game of Never Have I Ever. John learns something about Sherlock’s past; boo! Surprise jealousy 👻
“It’s a funny thing,” he says. “That you’re helping me, that is. I was certain you hated me.”
In light of my apparent death, the key witness was gone, and Moriarty was soon acquitted. I became complacent; especially after time moved on. I began to believe—despite the warnings of my family and friends—that he would remain convinced I was dead.
"Right. Ridiculous question. I'm half asleep and your beauty is very distracting. Give me a break." With that, he takes Sherlock's hand gently into his.
"Latin. Roughly translated: where there's love, there's pain."
"Oh, god," John rasps. Every brain cell, every molecule of his existence is overcome with the anticipation of Sherlock's touch. He bites his lip hard and brings his hips forwards in a gesture of consent.
"No."
"I was hoping you would think so." John kisses his shoulder again. And again. He nudges his cold nose over Sherlock's neck and kisses him there, just above the collar of his shirt. He kisses the side of his neck a few times, and then again just below his jaw.
Sherlock's glad that he did the crazy thing and lied to the medics. This is what he's most certain of, above everything else.
Then, he remembers what she shared with them earlier: her new purpose. Her endeavour to redeem herself after years of hurting others. Still—he’s not sure that he can accept her offer. He doesn’t think he’s willing to risk the life of anyone else that Sherlock holds dear.
John clears his throat, averting his eyes to hide his embarrassment. “Who? William?”
so that you can tell her in person.
"But where will you sleep?" John asks.
It’s fine. Sherlock is fine. He just hopes he doesn’t accidentally do something absurd like touch him back.
the most blatantly obvious source of information—William’s dear friend, and an actual employee of The Strand.
John grins and takes his hand, pulling himself up and landing square on his feet. “Is that so?”
"Good." John's eyes fall shut and he smiles. "Love you."
"Oh! Hello!” she acknowledges. “I'm sorry, I ought to introduce myself. I’m Doctor Torres. Doctor Watson and I attended Barts together."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Two weeks?!" Dimmock calls out from the adjoining room.
John frowns. “Is it?"
The intensity of the pleasure is so great that John nearly sobs—but William isn’t done with him yet. He quickly pulls his head away and seals his lips over John’s cock once more, sucking and licking at it fervently, his sweat-drenched hair plastered to his forehead, and he’s so fucking beautiful and amazing and—and God, John is coming again, shivering and groaning as he empties himself completely into William’s mouth.
Whoops. He accidentally let that one slip.
This series of actions is so unlike Sherlock that it takes John’s breath away. It’s almost startlingly intimate—bordering on erotic—much more than he would have expected. He’s got no choice but to sink into Sherlock as well.
Sherlock heaves a grumbling sigh—half frustration, half relief.
“Perhaps you should ask Molly,” John suggests one afternoon in the lab at Bart’s while Sherlock examines the digestive system of a corpse.
"Sit down,” Sarah commands, playfully shoving him down onto the sofa. “You and I have got some catching up to do.”
“John.” Sherlock breathes steadily, or at least he tries. “Hi.”
Sherlock flinches. “Ow!"
"I will," John replies quietly. With Sherlock next to him like this, it would be hard for him not to.
“I kinda wish I were dead right now,” Anderson states.
"Yes," Sherlock agrees, offering John the arm closest to him. "I think so, too." The thrill of it causes Sherlock's chest to flare up with excitement. Or maybe indigestion. Difficult to tell.
Or maybe he’ll just return home alone
Through many breaths and ticks of the clock at their bedside table, they slide in and out of one another’s mouths. They consume one another, drink in one another, pressing their lips into the slick, velvet skin between their legs. They fuck each other’s mouths in a steady rhythm until John becomes weak in the knees, collapsing on top of his lover.
“That’s what I meant to say! Donovan, please advise—how does one punch a ghost?”
John leans in cautiously, squinting at the screen from the doorway entrance.
Moriarty exhales a puff of laughter into his ear. “Honey, I’ve always known. I’ve got eyes and ears all over the place.”
John hushes him and takes his hand. “Not something to joke about, love.” He holds his hand to his mouth and kisses it softly. “I would be very lonely if that happened.”
John hopes she’ll keep Sherlock distracted for a moment—because it’s imperative that he doesn’t hear what John is about to say.
Sherlock does everything in his power to compose himself as he silently turns to leave. On the way out of the building, he drops his books, hails a cab, and sends a text to Lestrade:
John’s not. “What if there’s a certain, I don’t know, age, and once you’ve passed that age, you’ll never be fluent in kissing?”
“Sorry, dear, no.” (There’s a book of them in the kitchen cupboard.) “....But I do have one of those old-fashioned Ouija Boards. We could pull that out!”
When he looks back at Molly, tears are streaming down her face, and a high-pitched noise escapes her—one that somewhat resembles his name. She wraps her arms around his neck and proceeds to kiss him on the cheek about a dozen times.
"It's actually not a bad idea," John acknowledges.
And now, John's doing that thing where he laughs with his entire body, and Sherlock sort of regrets that he's not sitting close enough to feel it this time. "Oh my god. Sherlock, I'm not trying to kill you. I promise. Far from it, in fact. Though I do agree that I may have gone a bit mad."
"Yes. No? Yes."
"Are you sure you're—?"
John nods, smiling back. "You lead; I'll follow."
to unbutton his coat.
“Didn’t we?!” Sherlock interjects, freezing mid-pace and planting his feet directly in front of John's chair. "Wait. We didn't?"
“Hm. Good idea.” Sherlock obviously misses the joke entirely. But it’s fine—because he leans towards John with enthusiasm, and when he does, their knees become gently pressed together beneath the table.
"Yeah," John chuckles. "Would you like to try some?" He pulls a large bowl from the other side of the counter, dips a mixing spoon into the buttercream and holds it up to offer Sherlock a taste.
John watches, a little bit confused. A tiny bit uncomfortable. Definitely a lot turned on.
Sarah’s grins widens. “That self-defense class we took really paid off.”
"I told him I've dealt with problems in past relationships," he answers, "but I haven't gone into great detail."
Sherlock’s gaze wanders, and he becomes distracted by the open text on Brook’s desk.
"...But why?"
he’s okay.
John’s first day back home, much like his first day in hospital, is a blur of semiconscious memories and fuzzy moments. He dreams of having a fancy steak dinner. He dreams of running a marathon, his legs fully healed. He dreams of Sherlock kissing him, his lips as soft as snow.
“He never did anything useful in his life,” she says. “...so why would he do anything useful in his death?” She clasps her hands together. “Anyhow! The night’s still young. What do you all want to do next?”
“Lestrade’s expression looks very serious…” John whispers. “Quite grave, actually. As if he’s just heard a bit of sobering news…” He leans in for a clearer view. “I can’t see what his face is doing… Oh!” he gasps again and places his hand on Sherlock’s. “Oh no. Death has taken Lestrade by the arm! They’re walking off... he’s pulling him away… they’re headed towards the dark corridor...Greg! Where are you going?”
He only wishes he had something to stimulate his brain. A new case, perhaps. It would be a welcome distraction from the only thing that seems to be on his mind: John Watson. At the moment, the only temporary relief is the annoying daily text message he receives from his brother.
Sherlock bites his bottom lip hungrily as he watches John undress, and he is
"Not completely. I’ll need a bit of help getting around for a while."
“Alright,” Sherlock agrees. “But no kissing! I know your dirty tricks, Watson, and it will only distract us from the topic at hand!”
“No!” John calls out, leaping up from the ground.
"Oh. Well. I suppose it comes from knowing
Though Sherlock is not yet fully roused, he feels his presence before he appears—the phantom in the doorway with a clownlike smile, beckoning him to follow.
"Step one: I lift you from the chair. Step two: I place you onto the bed. But there's one step I forgot about, which is...to get the both of us around the chair."
"I didn't say anything!" says John, being deliberately obtuse in the way only John can be.
John chuckles, but only responds by giving Sherlock’s upper arm a light squeeze. Sherlock mourns the days of yore, when he would simply argue back.
"No," Sherlock whispers, pummeled by panic and regret. "No, John."
Sherlock doesn’t know. He's not good at knowing such things. How
"Hm." John nods towards his mostly broken body. "I'm a bit limited at the moment physically. But I could always use my words."
“Sylvia?” Donovan repeats. “Are you still here?”
he loves you. That means he's actually loved you for longer than that."
Sarah, Gabriela, Irene and Molly sit in a circle on the floor, hands joined, laughing and whispering conspiratorially. After Vegas, the four of them quickly became inseparable. The day they returned, Mycroft insisted Sherlock remain under protection, and Sherlock insisted on enlisting an attorney and a medic. He wouldn’t take no for an answer, and that’s how Gabriela and Sarah officially became part of their team.
“You don’t have to—” Sherlock begins, but John has already slipped out. He rolls his eyes, groans, and covers his face with his hands. Why must John dote on him so?
But he has a network of dozens of people, as I came to learn. And somehow, my new identity got back to him, as well as the fact that I am alive. Upon receiving this news, my first thought was of how I would never be able to say goodbye to you. I was nearly ruined by the realisation—but then, there you were. At the doorstep of The Strand. And it was Christmas, and I sensed how desperately we needed one another.
"John." Sherlock's reflexes are quick; he tucks his arms beneath John's, lowering him carefully onto the bed, and he goes down with him.
Sherlock nods. “Fair.”
On another of those nameless days en route to New Years, John drinks. He drinks until he’s convinced himself that calling The Strand at midnight is a fantastic idea.
He’s got no idea if Sarah’s motives are genuine, but at this point, he doesn’t really care. He wants to stop being lonely. He wants to stop thinking about William.
"Completely worth it.” Sherlock bends down and presses their lips together.
"Ugh," Anderson responds mildly. He gazes up at them from his mobile phone, seemingly unperturbed by the sight of John straddling a half-unbuttoned Sherlock. "Sally's angry with me."
"And what if
And then, they’re kissing again. They’re kissing, wrapped up in each other on the floor of Mrs. Hudson’s flat. And with a dark silhouette from the corner looking on, it almost feels like they’re defying Death—which is something the two of them are both very good at.
He certainly didn't seem bothered when the two of them arrived and discovered that there was only one bed in the cabin. He offered to sleep on the floor, but Sherlock refused to allow it.
“Notice what?” John turns to face the wall behind him. “Oh, shit."
John hesitates. “Yes?”
“Of course!” Sherlock grins widely and pats the open spot on the bed next to him. “No sex, John. None. Not even a tiny bit.” He’s very proud of himself for not laughing as he says this, because there will, as they both know, be heaps of sex.
regret it.”
John continues, working all of the same magic with his mouth and his tongue and his light sucking motions, expanding his technique by wrapping his arm around Sherlock and sliding his fingers through his hair.
John's face burns against his cheeks as the kiss quickly steers from delicate to possessive. He slides his strong hands down Sherlock's back, tucking them behind his legs and lifting his body to his.
John wonders if he should offer her comfort; but he isn’t sure how welcome it would be. She has, as far as he knows, spent the past few weeks hating him. And while she was technically “Marci” then, the lines remain somewhat blurred.
“Molly?” He calls out. No answer. “Is anyone in here?” Silence.
Molly straightens herself up, jumps into the air to give William a quick kiss on the cheek, and wraps her arms around his shoulders as well.
“John.”
"Ah. Of course.” Sherlock remains fidgety and distracted, drawing invisible lines between freckles on John's upper arm. "What if you and I travelled there together?"
Gabriela soon has the site up on her phone, her eyes wide as she scrolls. “Holy shit, these women are beautiful.”
And though Sherlock never believed in fairytales, he and John get their happy ending—at the end of their fall, the landing is what saves them.
He sighs and closes his eyes. Every symphony, he thinks bittersweetly, has got to come to an end.
Moriarty ruts his hips forwards into Sherlock. “We could do it quietly, if you like.”
to take you on your knees against the wall, spreading you open with your arms pinned above your head? Does
“She considers you a good friend.”
Sherlock backs away, using every inch of effort he has not to cry out in pain, but John just glances back down at his utterly boring newspaper.
He’s not exactly hiding their tryst from her—she’s far too clever not to have noticed it by now. But her feelings for William do complicate things a bit. If it bothers her, however, she’s never let on.
you.”
“Need you, John.” Sherlock grinds his hips into John’s, trembling with desire. He’s half-starved, his voice raw with emotion. “Can’t stop kissing you.
"Goodnight, genius," John says.
John bows his head slightly, and then he meets Sherlock’s eyes again.
fault, you know!" he hisses. Suddenly impassioned, he swipes the candle off the table, watching as it rolls noncommittally onto the floor.
That night, the three of them chat for hours. Not solely over the topic of John’s penis, of course—though it does make a conversational cameo or two. And for better or worse, Molly and Mrs. Hudson now know as much about his and John’s relationship as he does. Which is to say—not a whole lot.
“Hi,” John says, kissing Sherlock’s bare shoulder.
“Sherlock,” John says as he turns around. The weariness in his voice takes him by surprise.
Molly holds a hand up to intervene. “Right. Let’s fill John in on this little detail fist. John...” She looks back over to him. “Irene, Marci and I don’t just work with Sherlock. We sort of...work
"Forget about it," Sherlock says. "Let's just agree that you're insane and leave it at that."
"Sherlock?" Brook opens the door in a daze, wearing a cotton shirt and boxers, hair mussed from sleep. "Is everything alright?"
"Hi." He smiles back, heading towards the door to meet her.
But Sherlock's too proud for that. He leans over, holding a hand next to his face to keep Mrs. Hudson from hearing, and whispers into Molly’s ear:
Before they have time to collect their breaths, there’s a loud knock at the door.
He’s glad he saved Sherlock. Real. He’d do it again if he had to. Real. Sherlock's lips are plush and dry and maddeningly beautiful. Real. They’re pressed into John’s lips as he gently cradles his head in his hands. It’s the perfect kiss—simple, earnest, blissful. The type of kiss that could only occur in a dream.
"Yeah. I was born and raised in a small suburb right outside of Vegas. Should we call the number, then?"
At last, Sherlock gives in. Yielding to the losing battle, he raises his head to meet John’s gaze. It can’t be helped, really—his eyes (cerulean eyes, with tiny flecks of gold) are like magnets to his own.
On an evening during a more recent January, Angelo brings John and Sherlock a bottle of merlot compliments of the house.
Attempting to regain composure, he settles in to something he greatly enjoys: listening to Sherlock talk. And talk. And talk. Few people know how endlessly Sherlock rambles when he’s excited, and
It's still hauntingly silent, as though every word and sound has escaped from their chests, every ounce of their souls and energy are dedicated to this brief period in time.
John does feel inclined, so he presses his lips to the crown of Sherlock’s head—more deliberately this time.
“It’s really a minor one,” she replies. “I used to get them all the time playing basketball. No biggie.”
Molly’s cheeks flush with embarrassment. “Yeah?” she says sheepishly. “Tell her thank you for me, then.”
“Nope.” John grumbles, promptly walking over and blocking William from exiting the bar. “Where the hell are you going?”
He notices something in the sky—a single star, peeking out stubbornly from behind dark clouds.
Moriarty, of course, knows this game too well—and it isn’t about
“You can barely walk, John.”
The corners of her mouth turn upwards an infinitesimal amount; barely detectable from where John stands. It’s the only hint of emotion she’s shown since pulling the trigger. “I’m not afraid of Mycroft. And do you think that you’re the first to proclaim such a thing? That I’ll pay for what I’ve done? I’ve heard the same threat, many, many times. And here I am—still standing.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock reiterates. “Now
John’s breath is now hot against the back of his neck, and his body is now pressed into his. A whisper in his ear: “Ready, sweetheart?”
They slide their lips and tongues messily together as Sherlock comes, pumping into John until he’s wrung himself dry. With his final thrust, he cries out John’s name.
It’s two in the morning, and thankfully, everyone decides that’s the final question: the game ends up a draw between Molly and Anderson.
His sighs become low hums of satisfaction as John reaches his lower back, his capable hands pressing against his spine in all of the right places. Sherlock doesn't even know anymore what sounds he's producing; he's too relaxed to care. John appears to be unaffected, remaining every bit as thorough and attentive while his hands make their way back to his shoulders.
mad? I spent an hour reciting every digit of pi that I could remember, just to fill the silence."
“We’ll definitely need to do it again.”
They're flatmates, and that's it. And after tonight, possibly flatmates who kiss occasionally. John is his best friend—the best friend he's ever had. He can't let that slip away. And if John wants to, he can even be the best friend who touches him a lot, and who maybe allows Sherlock to touch him back. That would be a nice friendship, wouldn't it?
Sherlock buries his face into John’s neck. “And you’re alright?” he asks, because he needs to be sure.
John supposes it’s nice to be missed—and this conversation they’re having causes him to realize he misses her as well. They’ve been classmates at Harvard for the past three years, and they were friends long before they began dating.
...is what he would like to say. But he actually says:
John beams at him. "Yes." He bites his own bottom lip softly, looking up beneath his eyelashes. "A bit."
The two of them collapse into one another on the sofa, drenched in sweat and sex.
John leans the rest of the way forwards to close the space between them. He brushes their lips together, slides his tongue into Sherlock's mouth, and Sherlock welcomes it, open-mouthed and eager.
Gabriela and Sarah burst into laughter.
Gabriela drops her skirt and underwear down to her ankles and leans backwards into the wall. Sarah falls to her knees, pulling Gabriela's hips forwards and her knees apart before burying her face into her wet opening. Gabriela tosses her head back, sliding her hands up to her own chest, pinching her nipples as Sarah licks and sucks and tastes her.
Was it Einstein who said that the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and hoping for different results? John stares at the entryway for a few seconds, thinking about his warm bed. Ultimately choosing to risk madness, he walks into the bar.
"When did you arrive? At the hospital, that is?” Surely, John thinks, it hasn’t been more than a few hours.
Sherlock sinks into his lap, clinging to his chest and kissing him amorously.
After this, John says nothing for a long time. None of them do. Molly stands at his side, she and the others waiting with silent strength until he's prepared to speak.
The second John is spent, he collapses onto Sherlock. His knees burn from sliding over the bed continuously; his arms are weak from holding himself upwards.
This.
”Alright. John." He exhales. "You have a habit of staring at my lips, because you want to kiss them. When you begin to lick your own, it's as if you're..practicing for the role. Has anyone told you that you do that quite a lot? Anyway, sometimes, when we’re out in London together, and a small breeze blows through my hair, your fingers twitch as you watch it pass. You want so badly to simply touch it—a desire that I would be more than happy to provide you with. You don't seem to think I see you watching me whenever I walk through the sitting room, wrapped in only a towel—so I feel this might be a good time to inform you: the microwave oven reflects everything that happens in the sitting room. And also, I wear only a towel far more often when I know you'll be watching. Shall I go on?"
Showing how you feel is often easy. But the feelings don't gain life until you give them a name. And no matter how much you may regret what comes of that, there is no way of shoving those words back into your mouth.
John spins around to find Sherlock standing inches away, looking down at him, holding John’s scarf in his hands.
“Stop,” Sherlock pleads.
Sent ✓
John shivers a bit, nestling further into Sherlock. “Well. Whoever they are, they’re creepy.”
Sherlock peers back at him, affronted. “Are you suggesting that I’ve resorted to simple olfactory methods to carry out my deductions?” he scoffs.
"Elisa!" he greets her. "Oh, of course. Doctor Torres. Good to see you.”
With a strained grunt, Sherlock spins the two of them away from the bed and towards the adjacent wall, setting John down onto the bedside table. "This will be better," he explains as he tries to catch his breath.
“Perhaps don’t do it again, though,” Sherlock suggests.
Sherlock carefully ties the scarf into a knot. Once he’s finished, his eyes raise to John’s. “When have I ever been simply polite?”
"Oh!" Moriarty inhales. "That’s my cue to leave. But try not to miss me too much—I will see you both again very soon. Toodles!"
“John, I’m—“ He leans away, his eyes wide. His hair is gorgeously mussed; his cheeks are flushed and damp.
." He huffs. "By the way, your pre-coital conversational skills are atrocious. Zero out of ten. Not sexy at all."
Sherlock loses all self-control as his body freezes.
William slides his palms to the small of John's back, and John circles his arms over his shoulders, raising one leg to wrap around his waist. William moves his hands to the back of John’s thighs, pulling up his other leg and lifting him to sit on top of the bar. He pushes his hips into him, spreading his knees apart—and they breathe heavily together, sweeping their fingers over each other’s arms and tongues over each other’s lips.
Sherlock switches off the light on his nightstand and the two men settle in. The room becomes blanketed in silence, dim city lights coming in through the window. They lie on their sides, facing one another, and Sherlock again finds it impossible to look his friend in the eye.
Sherlock regards John thoughtfully. “Alright. Tell me, then.”
"Your thoughts are growing more deafening by the second. And there are multitudes of them, but I can't discern a single one."
"Oh." John blinks. "Thanks."
"That’s the gist of it," Sherlock says. "But we did
"Sherlock?" John's voice echoes from the mountaintop.
”Apparently. So then what?”
"Oh my god," Sherlock groans. "I'm so, so sorry."
tell her."
He checks the time as he reaches his destination. 6:57. At 7:00 sharp, a black limousine pulls up to the curb, and Mary steps out.
I died because I knew who Moriarty was.
“I—I enticed you to kiss me, and then I began to—”
He can’t do this. He doesn’t want to.
And that's the story of how Sherlock and John become fake married.
Several elements of this chapter were inspired by my own life. I grew up in Oklahoma, which is not Texas, but it is part of the Great Plains. When you live somewhere that's completely flat, the skies really are enormous. I spent time as a child at lake docks, catching fireflies, and getting sun burnt. RIP to my dermis.
“Oh,” John exhales. “So you
John sighs deeply. "I appreciate you letting me."
His notifications are bursting with text messages...all from people he loves, and his misery actually slips away for a few seconds. He’s very fortunate, he thinks. The past few weeks have been difficult enough, but they would have been impossible to face without his friends.
He doesn’t want to touch John. But if he wanted to, it would be so easy, and he’s ninety-four percent certain it wouldn’t be terrible.
John's eyes open again. "Do you think the word
"Nah. Not even close. You couldn’t get rid of me that easily. I would have figured out a way to come back and—"
“John.” There’s something in William’s voice begging him to stay. Push. Pull. Push. Pull.
Scientifically speaking, everything about this moment is completely perfect. And like many instances of pure perfection, it began with a murder.
“Yeah?” John is certain that they have both stopped breathing.
"Lots of people!"
"Goodbye." He ends the call abruptly.
Really, it’s so painfully obvious, so familiar, so deeply ingrained in his and John's lives that it hasn’t been a blip on their radar.
"Hopefully not—there’s no way to know for sure. But the book led me to The Woman's identity," John replies.
He wants to ask Sherlock whether he knows he's saved his life in every possible way. Wants to ask how it's even possible that every moment they're together—whether on an adventure or sitting in complete silence—is more electrifying than any crime they could solve. More gratifying than curing any ailment. More poignant than fighting on any battlefield.
Right now is all that matters. Right now, they’re safe in the backseat of a borrowed limousine, and Sherlock is in John’s lap, clutching onto his shoulders and kissing him desperately. He licks into his mouth, bears down onto him, only coming up for ragged breaths and needy whimpers.
“That would be lovely!” Molly pauses, considering. Then, a doe-eyed expression as she understands what Gabriela is suggesting. “Oh!”
Sherlocks takes a moment to weigh the consequences. He lets go of John's hand.
And finally, Sherlock's eyes settle upon two framed pieces of artwork hanging over that very bookshelf: in dark wood, the words
“What the hell, Sherlock?” John squawks, his voice soaring upwards precisely one octave. As he wipes the tea from his chin and various parts of clothing, his face grows pale, his eyes as wide as the harvest moon.
Because he loves John. And John loves him back.
“Careful,” John says. His expression is kind, although Sherlock wishes it weren’t; he would greatly prefer to be mocked for his lack of grace.
Irene sinks back into the sofa, pulling Gabriela down with her. She sighs with resignation, curling their bodies together. “I suppose I’m outnumbered. Go on, then.”
Sherlock releases a small puff of air. Finally, he reaches into his pocket and withdraws a tiny gold box. "I just thought, if we wore these, we might be more convincing.”
“Yeah,” Sherlock agrees.
He doesn't, though. Sherlock can still hear him breathing. And thinking. Ugh.
John wraps his arms around Sherlock's shoulders with as much strength as he can muster, burying his face into the crook of Sherlock’s neck.
The sun is up from the clouds now. He closes his eyes and inhales. He is at peace. It is time.
“John, erm… darling...dearest.” Sherlock turns back to John just as stiffly, extending his hand towards him in the same manner. “I’ll be back in just a bit.”
John ignores Moriarty; glancing over at Sherlock.
Sherlock finally looks up at him; his green and blue and gold eyes wide and angelic. There is an indescribable wisdom within them, pulling John in as if they possess their own gravity. It would be jarring if he didn’t, somehow, still appear so innocent.
John stops at their bedroom door.
“I could be wrong,” John growls. “But I’m pretty sure that’s none of your god-damned business.”
The corner of Brook’s mouth turns upwards. “Not at all. Actually, she's the one who encouraged me. She would say: in our universe, there are countless beautiful mysteries unsolved, and mankind is curious by nature. She didn’t believe it to be a coincidence.”
your laptop! Five minutes ago! And it seemed to be charged and working perfectly!”
“Well.” John nods stiffly, dropping his arms to his sides. “I suppose there’s nothing left to say.”
tell her.
recall, with an unnerving clarity, is the puzzling way John stared as he evaluated every inch of him. It causes an acute physiological response in Sherlock that isn’t entirely familiar—nor entirely unpleasant. As he squirms in his seat, he briefly wonders whether he ought to wear this particular shirt more often.
Jesus.
good of an actor. "You as well," he says. "Although—"
The earpiece booms in John’s ears. He hears Gabriela scream again just before the sound goes off. He rips his earbuds out, throwing them to the ground as he runs “No. Gab!”
And with that, John's brain goes mostly offline. “Yes. Yes, I will do that."
Once they leave, Gabriela heads off to the loo for her nighttime routine. John changes into his pajamas and sinks into bed, feeling as if his body carries the weight of a bulldozer. He reads Sherlock’s letter again, and rereads it, and rereads it again. By the end of the night, he’ll surely have memorized every last word, but he can’t stop—these words are the only piece of Sherlock he’s got.
They have never been more happy.
That said, there’s no drama herein. This is all fun, completely silly and ridiculously fluffy. So I hope you enjoy!
“Never,” John says, and that is a promise.
The three of them tread carefully through the back lounge area until they come to a closed door. They stop there, and Sarah points to the bottom of the doorway. "We found it here. Propped up against the door, as if someone had placed it there deliberately."
are you doing out here in the cold?”
"Have you got any phobias?" Sherlock asks on Wednesday, while sharing his bed with John. "I mean, obviously, you're
John lifts his hand to cup the side of Sherlock's face—and then, he gives his answer.
“Sherlock.” Brook gently pushes him away.
“Oh.” John shrugs. “Yeah, sure, sounds about right.”
But Sherlock grabs him by the wrist and tugs him back. "Wait. Don’t go.”
Whatever happens, he finds comfort in knowing he won’t be going out there alone.
Alternate chapter title: "The Hand Job and the Blow Job." ehehehehe.
Upon entering the motel room, Sherlock and John murmur with approval. Thankfully, regardless of how the outside of the motel appears, the quarters are quite nice. There's an enormous bed, and there's a shower—god, John can’t wait to shower.
Although inconvenient it may be—as the two men dash down the alleyway, buzzed from the wine and the irony, the rain seems to wash away all of John’s fears.
Hi! It's no longer Halloween, whoops! Thankfully, John and Sherlock's love can be enjoyed every single day of the year. Also, porn.
that Sherlock’s brother kidnapped, threatened, and interrogated him—but Sherlock figures it out before he does.
“John,” he says with a deep sigh of resignation. “You have to go."
John bursts into laughter. "Your skull. Did I kiss it? Yeah. Maybe a little bit. Sorry.”
“John!” A firm voice; a hand grasping at his arm, finally pulling him back. “You
It’s as though he’s ventured into a 1920s speakeasy—dimly lit with red and white lights, the faint smell of whisky, leather, and cigars. People at dark wooden tables sip overpriced cocktails as jazz music plays from a piano in the corner. He takes a seat at the bar, and that’s when he sees her:
“Oh, we’re playing pretend, are we?” Moriarty stops at arms-length, pinning Sherlock to the wall with eyes as black as ink. “
John doesn’t need to be asked twice; his eyelids are heavy, and his body feels like it’s going to collapse at any moment. “Goodbye,” he says politely, though he is filled with utter relief as they walk out the door.
It’s now Sherlock who is all sweaty and tachycardic. Also, he might be going into shock, or cardiac arrest, or both at once, because either of these scenarios are far more likely than John Watson being in love with him.
“Suppose you were to kiss me. How would you do it?”
But knowing you has taught me what it feels like to want something with my entire being. Never in this life have I felt a passion so deep. You awoke my soul, John Watson. And though I knew the danger of falling in love with you from the start, and though I tried to keep it from happening, I was helpless to stop it.
“I’m not done talking, William.” John drops his arms to his sides. “You know what? Actually, I get it. You think just because you’re charming, you can go through life walking over everyone else, and they’ll simply line up to be stepped on.”
With that, Brook seizes him. Their mouths meet with a gust of air and an inevitability that overtakes them both. Sherlock didn't know how much he needed this—not until he’s sliding his hands under the hem of Brook's shorts, and Brook is sliding his beneath Sherlock's shirt, spinning his body and pressing him against the counter.
He clears his throat and takes another large swig of his drink.
“Hush,” she says. "When did you become so grumpy?” She can’t contain the grin on her face. “Oh, wait. You’ve always been that way.”
He tries to ignore Sherlock as he gets ready for the date one evening; perfecting his curls and putting on the white silk button up and applying the after-shave that John has smelled every day since they met, though he’s only
"I mean—thank you,” Sherlock utters.
"It is," he agrees.
"I want you to fuck me."
"Perhaps you should pass on the cake, Marci,” William suggests. “Judging by the fit of your jeans, you’ve put on ten pounds this semester alone. Come to think of it, you’ve been nursing the same drink all evening—oh!” He claps his hands excitedly. “John must be taking you to the pharmacy to pick up a home pregnancy test!”
She marches over to Elizabeth and takes her by the arm. As she drags her away, Elizabeth appears confused—but doesn’t protest. She turns back to Stamford and blows him a kiss. "I'll call you!" she mouths, and the two of them are gone.
"Do you want it or not?" Sherlock asks.
one know? He’s never been in love with anyone before, nor has he planned for the unlikely possibility.
“Ask me what?”
John inhales sharply, nearly out of breath from the laughter. "Geese are not predators!"
“It won't be long now.” The driver looks up. "The next exit is ours."
“Oh!” Sherlock makes a hacking noise of disapproval. "Dull."
John goes silent for a moment. “Erm. Is that Molly I heard in the background?”
Sherlock crinkles his forehead indignantly when he discovers who it is: the person with the least amount of genius in the universe.
“You can thank me later.” Molly winks at him as she slides John’s jacket back over his arms. “Go. Gabriela is waiting for you.”
“Ugh.”
John feels something swelling in his chest, something akin to relief, but he doesn’t overthink it. “Of course.”
Sherlock looks over at John, who looks back at him. They smile fondly at one another, as they often do; as though they’re holding a secret that no one else is privy to.
“I can’t believe you’re here!” she responds. “I’ve missed you!” She leans away from him, her arms gripping his sides, her eyes brimming with tears. “You good?”
Anderson's phone buzzes, and he reads his message. "Oh yeah. Nice."
“No, no—“ John chuckles under his breath. “Sherlock, it's really
William’s face softens, and he bites lightly at his bottom lip. “I suppose I owe you a debt of gratitude for attempting to save my life earlier.”
A chill runs through John’s body at the sound of his name on the man’s lips. “Who are you?” he asks. “And how do you know my name?”
“You are wrong,” Sherlock utters. “John Watson is anything but ordinary.”
Later, John wakes up again, and the room is completely dark, and he’s not alone. Sherlock is settling into the bed next to him, getting beneath the covers.
Unable to bear the wait any longer, their bodies and hands and mouths crash together all at once. Sherlock’s lips are on John’s, and John cradles his head in his hands, and they continue their clumsy ascent to the top of the staircase. Sherlock’s fingers scrabble over the buckle of John's belt; John unbuttons Sherlock's coat, sliding it off his shoulders and onto the ground.
Sherlock is no longer next to him. At the foot of the bed stands a tall, prim man donning a bespoke grey suit and a superfluous umbrella.
“Do you want my
You. Oh, god."
"You were afraid.” John squeezes his hand—softly this time. “Afraid of leaving me alone after I got hurt, so you did what you had to in order to stay with me. And it worked in your favour once you got here, because nobody questioned your presence."
Instead, Sherlock grabs gently onto John's wrist and uses it to guide the spoon to his mouth. Holding it firmly in place, he bends forwards closer still, drawing his tongue to the tip of the utensil with a hum of satisfaction. He then brings his eyes to John’s, and with his pink tongue and his heart shaped lips he licks the spoon clean.
The pleasure burns into John. His fingers curl against Sherlock’s back, and he digs his fingernails into his skin.  Sherlock doesn’t break eye contact as he slowly pushes in deeper, the look on his face becoming more passionate still.
John stares down at his hand for a second before taking it, turning it upwards and kissing his palm, just as Sherlock did before. He continues to follow Sherlock's path—kissing his wrist, his arm, and his inner elbow. He pauses. Sherlock expects him to do as he did himself; re-tracing the trail of kisses back to their origin. But instead, he continues upwards, kissing his inner arm, his bicep, his tricep, his collarbone, and finally, his shoulder.
“Oh my god! Sherlock! You had
John kisses his right shoulder. Sherlock hears the sound of the cap opening, and the liquid pouring onto his fingers.
John waggles his eyebrows coyly as he begins to unbutton Sherlock’s shirt.
John's lips finally turn up into a half-smile. "Thank you." He heads through the door. "Good night."
Sherlock has always fancied himself a ravishing, gifted, and humble man of creativity and intellect. Ergo, he is skilled at many things. He's skilled at deducing, for instance. He's skilled at murders (the solving, not the committing, though he possesses the wisdom to be skilled at that as well). He's skilled at the pirouette a la seconde, and he's skilled at playing the Kayser etudes on his violin. He's skilled at not sleeping. He's skilled at avoiding people. He's skilled at making John laugh until his eyes begin to leak.
And this is how he finds himself on the last bus to Heymarket at half past midnight in the middle of a snowstorm.
Sherlock's mouth opens again as he prepares another completely legitimate argument, but he's unable to get a word in before—
“The hives,” he says. "Let's look there."
John side-eyes him. “...And?”
“I assure you, by the way," Sherlock says, rustling John’s hair with his words. “...that for everything I've mentioned, the feeling...the desire...is completely mutual.”
"You get to live, and John Watson gets to live, and Richard Brook and Sherlock Holmes will be together again. Side by side. Just like old times."
“Yeah.” Molly sniffles. “I know.”
And thus concludes their first murder investigation (together, as boyfriends).
In the early morning, they curl up next to the Christmas tree, wrapping themselves in table linens to keep warm.
The air rushes out of John’s lungs as he hits the wall with a thud. He’s never felt so powerless in his life—but he wants this. God, he wants this. So he pours kisses into William's open mouth, sweeping his tongue over his lips and teeth, only coming up for air with tiny, desperate gasps.
“You’ll never get an Uber at this time on New Year’s Eve,” Sarah says. “Gabriela will stay here and keep the party going.” She stands. “Now are you in, Watson, or are you going to keep arguing and wasting valuable time?”
Sherlock wants to offer comfort, but by now, he’s giggling so uncontrollably that he can barely catch his breath. So he sits upright, scoots in besides John, and pulls him in for a hug. “Even though you’re clearly experiencing an episode of drug-induced paranoia,” he says once he can breathe again, “...you’re looking out for your friends.”
John then turns to Mycroft, extending a hand, and Mycroft accepts. As they shake hands, though, John leans forwards to say something into his ear.
But for the most part, their unspoken arrangement works. It's as if they've got the best of both worlds. Friends, to sunset. To lovers, to sunrise, to friends again.
in his very John Watson way, a great deal more distracting than is reasonable.
Donovan regards her warily at first, but quickly gives in. “Alright.” She slowly approaches the board and sets her fingertips over the planchette.
"Sherlock," John adds.
"It’s just that, erm…” John swallows. “I think we're overlooking one fundamental detail."
John wraps him more tightly in his arms. “It’s alright. You can ask whenever you’re ready.” He brushes another kiss on his cheek. “The answer will still be the same.”
It takes a full three seconds before it registers with John that he’s referring to the drink. But William has already turned his attention to an attractive raven-haired woman who dons a leather corset and scarlet-stained lips. John feels—something. Something fierce. Annoyance? Desire? He’s not going to figure it out—not tonight.
Every kiss, however, still feels like the first.
Sherlock bends forwards and brushes his soft, soft lips against John's—and John gives up on trying.
Sherlock presses his mouth to his, slowly and sweetly. “Ten minutes ago, I thought I would never kiss you again, and here you are. These are happy tears.”
"Definitely not those idiots!" Sherlock emphatically acknowledges. "But…" his eyes fall to John's hand. "In the meantime, we ought to continue holding hands. Just to avoid confusion."
“Perfect.” John tangles his hands through the hair at each side of William's head, gripping tightly. “Would you like a taste?"
Sherlock proudly continues. "I love John Watson!"
"He's
"Yes, and let me tell you, that was quite a titillating conversation. But what do you want me to talk about, Sherlock? The weather? It's rainy. Yesterday was rainy. Tomorrow will be rainy. It's London. It's always rainy."
"Hey, you two."
“Keep watching.” William slides his hand up and down John’s length, and he doesn’t let go until John comes.
As he watches them go by, he thinks of Sherlock, staring out at the stars over red cliffs.
John inhales slowly, steadying his breath. After all, Sherlock’s fate—and perhaps John’s own—depend upon on how this meeting goes. He decides not to remind Gabriela of that.
“Oh.” John’s chest clenches. It’s definitely not the answer he expected. “Then why—?”
"Christ, Sherlock." John's voice is low as they walk side by side. "When you're deducing like that, I can barely contain myself. I just want to—“
be different? And nothing will ever be the same? And it will be so different, but like,
“Wow. Could not have predicted that one,” John scoffs, clenching his jaw to keep from bemoaning William’s insolence.
Still struggling to find words, he sets a hand gently on Sherlock's shoulder.
John kisses his neck softly. "She was very happy for us. Actually, she was surprised it didn't happen sooner."
"Mrs. Hudson!"
John presses his lips to his. "Did you doubt that I would?"
“How can I have an opinion of your...thought occurrence...if I’ve got no clue what it is?”
One thing is certain, however: when he's with John as of late, he smiles much more than usual. He smiles when John plays with his hair and kisses the top of his skull and uses his nicest words. It might even be his new favourite thing to do with John, second only to going on cases with him, which is saying a lot.
“Good.” Sherlock holds out both hands, palms facing up. John gingerly places his own atop Sherlock’s; they’re soft and stained with dye from the dandelions. “Close your eyes, John,” he instructs.
"Oh," Sherlock says absentmindedly. "I suppose so, yes. Must have pulled a muscle when you dragged me to the kitchen floor."
William pulls away, hands falling into his lap. “John, I owe you an apology.”
"What's the matter?" John asks, his lips within an inch of Sherlock's.
Sherlock knows it's not a bad thing. But although none of this is real, it feels very, very real. Regardless of who they're pretending to be, this is John, and this is Sherlock, and this is a path they've never crossed.
John tries to convince himself he’s lucked out. That he won’t be alone tonight after all—so he should be happy. But this does nothing to soothe the tightness in his chest, or the knots in his stomach, or the stinging grief of knowing where he will not be.
"So I suppose, erm—" Sherlock tucks his chin, his eyes flitting down to his own wedding band, and then quickly away— "You’ll go back to Baker Street, then. And everything will return to normal."
Sherlock turns to go.
Sherlock chuckles as he combs his fingers contentedly through John's hair. "Are you currently under the influence of marijuana, John?"
Sherlock slowly moves himself downwards over John's eager body; trails his tongue over his sternum and ribs and past his abdomen. Over his navel, to his hipbone and inner thighs, over his thick cock and heavy testicles. Settles in, spreading John's knees apart and plunging his tongue into him without warning.
Today 8:17 AM
"Goodbye, John," he says, and he drops his mobile phone to the ground.
"Shit." John freezes. "Are you alright? Did I hurt you?"
John lays back and watches him, eyes half-closed, blissed out and love drunk and hungry for more.
“That’s quite a ring you’ve got there,” he remarks. “A wedding band, is it?”
Stamford looks at the card, and then he looks over to William. “That bloke? The one who walked directly off the catwalk and into his evening job?”
“Is there anything you’d like to communicate, Sylvia?” Donovan presses on.
Heather doesn’t write John back, and a week later, she's holding hands with Nick Parker again, and kissing him with her orange sherbet lips.
As he settles, Sherlock shifts his body closer and envelops him in his arms. "Goodnight, John." He lightly nuzzles the back of his neck. "May you have pleasant dreams of climbing Kilimanjaro."
“Ugh!” Moriarty sighs dramatically. “Finally, you decide to show up!” He wriggles his body a bit, but John strengthens his grip, pressing the gun into the side of his head. “Although it’s a bit alarming that you waited so long. I thought you would come the moment I laid a finger on him.”
Hiiii!
John continues to fasten his coat. “Don’t think that’s any of your concern, mate.”
Without breaking the kiss, he circles his arms around John's shoulders and pulls his body over his. He covers him like a blanket, sinks into him completely, and still wishes they could somehow be closer. He licks fervidly into John's mouth, continuing to grind their hips together.
John nods. “Crown and coke?”
Sherlock chuckles. "To be expected.”
John musters up a tiny smile for her, and she leans in to kiss his cheek before wandering off to shower and prepare for her rendez-vous.
Sherlock's face breaks into a smile as well, and the tension in the air briefly dissipates.
Sherlock’s eyes fall closed. He wants to beg him not to continue, but his words are lodged in his throat.
John presses lightly at Sherlock’s shoulder, sending him stumbling backwards the tiniest bit.
"And then you screamed for your mummy?"
"That was only four questions. Would you use this item in the bathroom?"
Sherlock turns to rest his chin in John's soft hair—a gesture of tenderness that surprises even
These words are by far the most magical tools John possesses. Because whenever Sherlock does become sexually aroused, it's his overwhelming love for John--and John's overwhelming love for him--that sends him there. And John, splendidly observant in the bedroom, knows this as well. So that's what this is all about: John isn't jealous of Sherlock's past sexual experiences. Given his knowledge, he's simply trying to accept what those people may have meant to him. And for him--the idea that Sherlock may have loved them is far worse.
John’s hands roam over Sherlock’s back, come trailing down his spine, linger at his hips. He allows them to wander down past the small of his back, and he moans into the kiss without meaning to.
John tilts his head back to gaze up at him again. "Fuck, you're sexy."
Sherlock is happy, and he's warm. He decides it's the alcohol flowing through his veins, although he knows John is to blame.
Sherlock smiles. He holds John closer, basking in his warmth. He was not at all expecting have an enjoyable time tonight. Thanks to John (and a little bit of pot) (but mostly John), it’s been lovely. And if this is what every Halloween, every occasion, every day with John will be like, he will gladly keep him around for all of them.
William lifts John’s body to his, spinning him around and laying him over the bathroom counter. John’s head falls back like a ragdoll’s; he grasps desperately at William’s shoulders, digging his fingernails into his skin. William steadies him in place, sinking his hips into the seam of his trousers, his hardness creating warm, magnificent friction.
"But like, did you ever wonder if things will
"And then?"
John shuffles his feet, his eyes falling on the corpse’s spleen. “I mean, she could help you. She clearly fancies you, and I’m sure she’d kiss you, if you asked.”
And if he and John can fool the world into thinking they’re in love, they can fool the world into thinking they’re not.
They exit the scene. Lestrade is probably calling out to him, but thankfully, Sherlock is fluent in ignoring him.
Sherlock, who is only twenty himself, never tires of hearing praise for his academic accomplishments. But for the praise to come from Brook—someone he so greatly admires—is an honour he wasn’t expecting.
"Hold on to me very tightly," John instructs. "I need you to promise me. Hold as tightly as you can, and do not let go for any reason. Do you promise?"
And there are other things that he craves. Things that husbands do—past kissing and holding hands and falling asleep together. These are things he and John do not practice.
But no matter what happens during their days, the two men find their way back together. Huddled beneath covers, tongues exploring every inch of skin. There is body heat and warm breaths and murmurs of happy things. Elbows and hip bones and collarbones sliding together; lips pressed into inner thighs and peaked nipples. Fingers wandering past hemlines, hands and mouths bringing shivering wet ecstasy night after night after night.
As John plays the final chord, the room is filled with thunderous applause, and a blazing white light covers the stage.
"Right?!" Donovan says enthusiastically. “Fantastic idea, actually.” She then turns to stare at John, admiring his wires and foam balls for a tad bit too long.
Sherlock inches closer. "What words?"
“Moriarty.”
"No," Sherlock answers, surprising himself.
"You must," Sherlock insists.
Sherlock gazes silently at John, brow furrowed with anticipation.
Irene rises from the bed with an exasperated sigh, mumbling angrily under her breath.
With sugar and caffeine bringing them back into the land of the living, they decide to call the number they found on the index card.
Sherlock thinks it’s best they change the subject.
Her words startle John. “Getting me here? What do you mean?”
He folds his arms around her and pulls her in, hugging her gratefully. “There’s just one more thing,” he adds.
Nevertheless, his heart rate escalates with every second of this pornographic wrist touching, and with Sherlock's fingertips at his pulse, he must remind himself to be careful. If Sherlock only knew what was going on with John’s brain and his wrists and his knees and everything in between... well. John doesn't want him to know. John doesn’t know, for that matter.
"That must be dinner." John hands him the glass and sets the bottle on the countertop before walking over to answer.
John seems sure, according to the card lying on Sherlock’s nightstand. But love is a fickle thing, so is he
Sherlock regards her for a moment. “It’s not beyond the realm of possibility, however, that they’re jointly concussed.”
Sherlock circles both arms around John's waist. "Tell me again that nothing bad can happen to us here."
Sherlock moans quietly at John’s touch. When their eyes once again meet, his are filled with a wild desperation. His face is flushed; his lips are parted, and his pulse leaps at his throat.
Sherlock carefully closes his book and retrieves his phone to check the time. It’s been twenty minutes. His grip tightens. It’s fine. He opens up his texting app to type a message.
John gives her an appreciative nod. “Will do,” he says.
“It may seem somewhat foolish...and I realise that even as I’m saying it. But there is something extraordinary about the time we spend together here at the restaurant."
“Right,” he responds, releasing a gust of air. “Good.”
“John, we must hurry,” William urges. “The queen will arrive soon."
"...Thank you." Sherlock lifts his arms to pull John into a full, deliberate embrace, and he kisses his neck gently in return. "So are you." He then brushes his mouth against John's jaw, and then against his earlobe.
John lets out a low whistle. "Military? They're risking nothing this time, are they?"
“No,” Sherlock answers, surprising himself.
Sherlock frowns in confusion. "You want me back on the floor?"
Sherlock tilts his head, continuing to regard him silently.
John drifts back off with a smile on his face. And that smile is undeniably, emphatically real.
“Dung beetles.” The laughter in John’s response is tiresome. “You were reading about dung beetles?”
“Nothing is ever certain,” John says. “But I will most certainly be there for him as long as I am able.”
"John. You came."
As he stood to go, I stood with him, extending my hand to his. “The New Testament,” he said. “Matthew 5:38.”
“You look nice tonight,” John says, and it all goes downhill from there.
John freezes. “Oh! What happened?”
What fuck was that, anyway?
The limousine pulls off the interstate into a small city where there appears to be little more than palm trees and a couple of casinos. But as they continue to drive inwards, John learns that they’re actually in the suburbs. Most of the houses there appear to be new, and eerily similar: shaped like boxes, with a single storey and brightly-painted stucco. Their front yards are adorned only with gravel and cement—it must be difficult, John realises, to keep grass growing in such blistering heat.
“Hmm.” Moriarty teases at Sherlock’s trouser button. “You think you’re the only one with a team of people keeping you alive? That’s precious. But can you really trust any of them, Sherlock? I convinced Miss Morstan to come to my side first. Who’s gonna be next?” He leans down and whispers into Sherlock’s ear. “What if it’s John?”
The world around John blurs. He runs after Moriarty with every ounce of strength he has left. And he thinks he may hear Sherlock is calling his name from behind him, but he’s too far away to be heard. Besides, John’s heart is thunderous in his ears, and the helicopters and sirens quickly grow louder and closer.
"And yet, I could still take you," he murmurs playfully against his ear.
has a synonym?" he asks, apropos of nothing.
plays over the speaker. Molly dances to the music and giggles as she hangs ornaments and sings loudly along, and William pretends not to be enjoying himself.
Surprisingly, it’s Sherlock’s body that goes still first. He chokes out John’s name again, clenched and throbbing around John’s hardness, grunting with pleasure as he wrings out his release.
Sherlock thinks.
"It's fine, Sherlock.” John smiles tightly. "I'm fine. I don't need to know. You aren't entitled to share your past with me."
He follows the phantom from the cabin and into the dry night, where he becomes caught in an embrace that is colder than the Arctic wind. He feels a needle in his arm, and the soothing lilt of a madman’s voice just over the shell of his ear:
“Only for a few days.” Sarah taps her fingers on the steering wheel. “I think I was just...blindsided by my feelings for him. But things quickly started to get worse. He would get angry with me for little things. On the night before Christmas Eve, he drank too much. Told me that without him, I’d be miserable, and my mom would never get better. I immediately went home after that, and broke it off with him the next morning. He seemed...oddly fine with it.”
He assumes, quite correctly, that he has not been invited.
Seeing Sherlock like this: it's the most perfect moment of beauty John has ever witnessed.
They awaken Christmas morning on the cool hardwood floor of The Strand, still tangled in limbs and rain-dampened clothing. John’s head throbs from a hangover as he shields his face from the morning light.
Gabriela speaks first.  “Hang on,” she says, leaning forwards on the bed, her arms linked comfortably with Irene’s. “You’re the only one here who uses a fake name, right? Why not the other girls?”
John laughs. “So I’ve been told.”
By the end of day three, John is sleep-deprived, and his knowledge of human anatomy has dramatically decreased. He’s craving an Old Fashioned in a way he never has before: the bourbon trickling down his throat, the buzz it creates as the alcohol flows through his veins.
“Let’s go,” he says. “I happen to be a fantastic bartender.”
Sherlock clears his throat loudly and pointedly.
She goes on to warn him that her story isn’t particularly a happy one, and asks if he’s sure he wants to hear it. John’s hands are shaking from nerves and his mouth is dry, but he’s sure.
“That was beautiful,” he exhales. “Thank you for showing me.”
William gurgles lowly. His body goes stiff, and he arches his hips forwards. “Jesus.”
Just as Sherlock predicted, Lestrade returns a few minutes later. He’s sans Death, but clearly alive. And so the party goes on.
"Want me to take a look at it?" John asks.
“Wait, what?” John narrows his eyes. “Why not?”
Sherlock grins. “Come in.”
The car slows as they approach traffic.
"John?"
Sherlock purses his lips. “We haven’t actually talked about that. How do I know?”
: Everyone but Donovan (lie)
"Got it." John grins at him as he tosses his trousers to the ground. And just like that, he is completely naked. Sherlock swallows and takes it all in.
John slowly presses himself into Sherlock, and everything else fades away. Everything but John, growling lowly as he encases himself in Sherlock’s heat. Everything but their bodies, drenched in sweat, sliding together over the mattress. Everything but John pumping into him, gruffly calling out Sherlock’s name as he frots against the mattress.
"When I was seven years old,” he says, “my parents dragged me along to a conference in Holland. I was completely uninterested. On the day we left, it was like pulling teeth just to get me into the vehicle. But they promised to take me to any museum in Amsterdam that I chose. I begrudgingly agreed.”
“Aren’t you worried you’ll never learn, though?” John asks as the putrid scent of rubbish wafts through the hot summer air.
“What, John?” Sherlock cups John's chin with his long, trembling fingers. Carefully, he tilts it upwards, and he leans down until their foreheads are pressed together. Their eyes fall closed, and they breathe one another in.
Oh, yes, what an excellent idea it was for them to store a bottle of lube there. "Yes. Yes. And you locked the door, right?"
Sherlock reaches out his arms to take John's head into his hands, and he gazes up at him for a few seconds before kissing him on the forehead. “You have all the evidence you need, John. Believe it."
“Oh my god? Sherlock!” she squeals, reaching over Ms. Smith’s entrails to take his hands. “The two of you confessed your love?!” She jumps up and down with excitement.
After that, he hears the voices of medics chattering as he boards the ambulance, and more chattering as he goes in and out of surgery. This is real. They tell him that his husband will meet him in his hospital room. This is a dream. And a strange one, at that. He may have suffered a head injury, but he’s certain he would remember if he were married.
Mycroft turns away from the window to face him. “Gregory," he says softly. "It’s alright. You don’t need to—“
Moriarty moves away, looking down at him with genuine sadness. "You did?"
“Yes. An involuntary reaction brought on by a boost of adrenaline, often preceded by heightened emotions. And sometimes, when one becomes cold.”
"A hospital chair isn’t ideal, either, but I managed to make it work.”
Sherlock's and Mrs. Hudson's mouths drop open as they gasp in unison. Mrs. Hudson takes a drink of her tea and pretends she didn't hear the question.
“There was a mission that went horribly wrong.” Her throat tightens. "I lost everyone I cared about. I was the only one to make it out alive."
“I ate something earlier.” He brings the glass to his lips.
Gabriela presses their foreheads together. “Good. Because you don’t need to be.”
"Mm. Perhaps.” Sherlock retrieves his phone in order to perform a Google. "In due time."
: John, Hudson, Donovan, Sherlock, Molly
"Oh," John breathes, lifting his hands to the sides of William's face. "Hello. I thought I'd lost you."
John’s eyes shift to her, realisation settling over him. “Oh. No, we aren’t a c—”
"Does this mean we've gone from carbon dating to carbon bonding?"
"By an eighth of a centimeter," Sherlock continues. "And that you fractured the second knuckle of your middle finger approximately fifteen years ago, but you didn't wear your splint as the doctor ordered, which is why it's crooked."
“No,” John whispers to himself, a wave of nausea passing through him. He doesn’t like this dream anymore. He wants to leave it. So he squeezes his eyes shut and tells himself to wake up.
"Yes. Closer than I was with my parents, I'd reckon."
Sherlock pulls himself up from the table, perplexed. "So you’re telling me...all of New Scotland Yard saw us kissing?”
Sherlock gently tilts John’s head to one side, and then to the other. “Are you aware of how lovely you are?”
make."
Next to the biography, there's a photograph of a young man. He appears to be eighteen or so. His face is thin and clean-shaven; pale, but not sickly. His wavy hair is somewhere between light brown and auburn. He's got thick, heart-shaped lips and high cheekbones, and his eyes are hundreds of shades of green, blue, and gold.
than we would ever allow ourselves otherwise."
“My love,” Sherlock says beneath his breath. He likes the sound of that.
He wants to tell Sherlock that he’s missed this. That there’s so much he wants to say, but he’s afraid to say it out loud. He wants to tell him that he will continue to love him no matter what the cost, and that his love is not contingent upon Sherlock returning it. That he will continue to wear his wedding ring, because although their marriage was an act, his commitment to him is very real.
Sherlock stands and moves swiftly to John's side, placing his hand gently onto his cheek. “Your face is warm. You must rest immediately.” He offers his other hand to John. “Come, Watson. I will put you to bed.”
John decides it’s time to give in. He takes a deep breath and swallows stiffly, vaguely hoping that the confession will become stuck. It doesn’t.
His cock leaks, swells, and it craves warmth and wetness.
And John, already harder than a diamond beneath him, clutches tightly to the headboard to steer his own hips in their sweaty dance. Slides up and down against him, drags his wet mouth over him everywhere he can reach, leaving nothing graceful about where his lips and tongue are going.
Yet there's one thing that remains on Sherlock's mind: the kiss he and John shared during his very first night in hospital. Neither of them have brought it up. And after the fiasco with Doctor Torres, they agreed that they ought to extend the repertoire, but they’ve only continued to practice the already mastered material.
“It’s a shame, isn’t it?”
She walks over towards him, her body naked and glistening with sweat. Her eyes fall to the hardness below his waist, and she smiles with satisfaction.
She turns to him, her dark lashes as dark as ever, her scarlet lips just as scarlet. “Yes, darling.“
“—Yeah?”
“So let me make sure I’m understanding this correctly,” John says. “Your psycho ex shows and tries to stir shit up with you. But you and Gabriela fight back like some sort of vigilante girl gang. And once it's all over with, in a completely unrelated move, you fall on your arse and end up in hospital.”
Sherlock shrugs. "Don't ask me. You're the one who said it."
John's eyes fly open, and he pulls away with a gasp. He and Sherlock are back in the bright, sunny field.
“No.” John’s thoughts are too intrusive to be deterred by the abstract. “Actually, the doctor in me is dying to know how you got that concussion. Should you even be driving?”
“No!” Molly laughs. “God, please do not use my prior relationships as reference. There’s a reason I took time from dating. I kept attracting losers—and neither you, nor John, are losers. You are both fantastic and both very lucky.”
“Lovely name,” Mrs. Hudson says nostalgically. “My dearest friend at university was named Sylvia.”
He can only hope she’s willing.
"So you've said." John's eyes glimmer with amusement, but Sherlock definitely isn't looking, so he wouldn't know.
She's right. If he wants to see William before midnight, he has no other choice. “I’m in.”
It happened a year ago, perhaps to the very day.
“Not the point. Go to sleep, you snarky bastard.”
“And you,” Molly chimes in. “He’s lucky that you’re his, as well.”
"You were there! Did you not hear it?" His eyes grow wider, nearly comically so. "It was also the first thing Mycroft said to me when he kidnapped me."
He doesn’t remember how he found his way to his bedroom after a night of heavy drinking, but he’s thankful he’s alone—occasionally, after drowning his sorrows with liquor, he’ll wake up in his bed with a pretty stranger.
“Yes?” Sherlock turns his head.
Good evening. -SH
”You see it too, right?” John laughs nervously. “It isn’t just me?”
The helicopters are directly above them, now. No less than a half dozen police vehicles pull up as the helicopter operator calls from the loudspeaker. Officers pour out, holding guns and barking orders.
“Oh.” The situation didn’t actually occur to John.
John sighs deeply. “Fine.”
me?” John exclaims, widening his eyes with bewilderment. “That was on
“You have mentioned that.” John’s face is burning. “But I’m afraid I don’t know exactly what it means.”
”Sherlock,” John admonishes him under his breath.
“Pardon?”
“Part of the act,” Sherlock says without hesitation.
Sherlock knows he’s being utterly ridiculous, but he’s too wound up at the moment to conceal his reasons. "You and I missed our evening routine, where we ask one another questions and talk about things...and I just wanted to be sure that after last night, nothing has...changed. Between us."
His head is throbbing. He’s sober, and he’s cold and shirtless in a dark restroom, and he just wants this night to end.
"I actually had the opportunity to volunteer at a hospital there," John explains. "Years ago. After completing medical school."
“And how exactly do you do that?”
"You were into museums? Really? That young?"
Mycroft presses his lips together with vexation. “You are very shortsighted for someone who knows Sherlock so well.”
is probably not the answer most guaranteed to grant him passage. So he comes out with the first response he can think of.
John starts the tiniest bit at her assumption, though it’s not exactly an uncommon one. “Oh, no,” he says, offering her his arm. "Sherlock’s not my—”
"Kitchen sink?”
"Bee farm," John hastily responds.
My friend, my partner, my hero: a murderer.
Sherlock leans in until their foreheads are aligned. “I simply wanted to inform you that I love you, too.”
Besides, Sherlock has told him from day one that sex is of absolutely no interest to him. What logical reason would John have to think that it has ever been? These tiny flashes into Sherlock's life before they met must have been jarring, especially when receiving both pieces of news at once.
That night, Sherlock does what any fake husband would do: he stays there, next to a bruised and sleepy John, and he watches him breathe. He also decides he can't leave John's side. Not tonight. Maybe not ever. Perhaps that's something fake husbands do, too.
“Well, your actions do affect others. I mean, Marci’s personal life is not yours to comment on. Come to think of it, neither is mine. And you ruined her night, and you ruined my best friend’s birthday. So you may be the most bloody gorgeous man in the room, but it doesn’t matter. Because you’re a very mean person—and in my book, that makes you ugly."
"It feels almost as though we're in a different universe,” Sherlock continues pensively. “...hidden away from the annoyances of daily life. As though you and I are different people altogether—and yet more
“Right,” John acknowledges. “I sort of assumed that was the case, given your publications and studies—and your alarmingly precise observation skills.”
show us to our room. I’m utterly exhausted.”
“Thank goodness.” John clenches his eyes, leaning forwards to faceplant into Sherlock's shoulder. "I thought he would never leave."
Gabriela tilts her head thoughtfully at John’s questions. “Anyway. Um, Molly? Yes. Spoke to her? Irene? Yes, and yes.” She takes his hand. “And don’t worry, love. Once I explained to Irene that I was with you, she let me go. The rest of your questions will be answered once we’re back.” She smiles. “Let’s go. You’ve got friends waiting for you.”
Sherlock exhales a deep sigh. “But they are not
John takes Sherlock’s hand into his. “I’m going to come, Sherlock,” he murmurs as he weaves their fingers together. “I’m going to come so fucking hard for you. But I need you to come first, alright? Can you do that? Can you come for me, sweetheart?”
"You know, Sherlock....I-" His voice is soft and careful, as if he knows he won't be able to take the words back.
“God." Sarah curiously sets her hand over the letters. "I don’t know, but I’m beginning to feel pretty weirded out. We should probably go."
"You're wrong!" He slams the door dramatically behind him. "And you've got terrible timing!"
“Did you do any more than kissing?” She tilts her head slightly. “Is he, you know...?” She lowers her eyes below her waist.
They land facing towards one another, bodies tangled together. Without a beat, John finds the familiar place between Sherlock’s neck and shoulder; Sherlock’s chin finds the crown of his head.
"If you're going to employ this...current...husbandly action...in which you caress my head...it would likely be more believable if you caressed my face as well."
He hears something. His eyes fly open, and he looks down at Sherlock’s sternum—his own fingers bloody from the wound.
All of the blood seems to rush from William’s face, and he goes pale and silent. He sighs. “I’m not entirely sure how to answer that, John.”
“Oh.” John presses his lips together. "I actually didn't think that far. I really was just trying to mess with you."
"—My point is that she is someone who cares about you."
John is thirty-eight, and leaning against a large dumpster in a small London alleyway when he learns that Sherlock Holmes is thirty-four and has never been kissed.
“Right!” John blurts. “Oh, yes. Yes. Apologies. I—I hit my head, you know. But it’s true. We are....soooooo married.” He laughs like a madman, confidently taking Sherlock’s hand into his. “Yes. Husband.
Sherlock nods. "We were busy. Very busy. Kissing. Kissing a lot, in case you failed to notice."
John finally climbs out of his bed, gains his balance, and uses both legs to walk steadily to his wardrobe. He takes out his robe, puts it on, and walks to the door. He takes a deep breath, turns the doorknob, and hopes for the best.
“John. Really?"
“Apologies,” she says. “That one isn’t for sale. It’s quite rare, you see. I can put you on a waitlist, but you may not receive it for another year or so.”
John blinks. Meeting a stranger alone in an unfamiliar place? It feels dangerous; but he’s surprised to learn that this only spurs him onward. And yet, he won’t go without a reason.
The man’s brow furrows, his nostrils flaring, and John wants to punch that big, stupid nose right off of his face.
Sherlock grumbles incoherently, giving the chair a push. It doesn't budge.
When the second gunshot rips through the air, Mary’s mouth falls open. Blood rips from her chest, and she gasps as her body arches forwards, dropping to the ground.
John takes a few moments to admire his beauty, but his curiosity soon gets the better of him. He rolls out of bed and heads into the other room to retrieve his phone from his coat pocket.
"Then no."
“I didn’t go to the bakery this time,” he says, retrieving a bottle of wine from the cupboard. “In fact, I received a call from someone about a special delivery. Something I...you...have been waiting on for quite awhile. So I stopped off on the way home and got it. A bit of a challenge getting it back here, especially without you seeing it. I wanted it to be a surprise, though I guess I’ve spoiled it now. Well, you’ve yet to find it. Anyway, so I hauled the gift onto the tube, and after that, I came back to Baker Street. Wine?”
But when he wanders into his usual cafe that afternoon for his usual study session, he encounters something...not usual.
"Ah." John nods and gives him a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. Nothing has changed. Promise. If you want to hold my hand, you can. But if you don't, that's alright too."
It isn’t even two full minutes before Stamford returns with a tray full of drinks. As he sets it onto the table, the girls oooh and aaaah with appreciation.
John actually knows everything he needs to know about William.
Sherlock smiles weakly. “I don’t have an answer for you right now. Is that going to be alright?”
And as hot and sweet as those earlier kisses always were, this one is absolutely savory. Slow. Purposeful. Not a means to an end.
"Yes, which he's doing because he's in love with you."
But there’s something that occurs to John with even more clarity than the memories. Five very simple, very inconvenient words.
John says nothing. Carefully and slowly, he guides Sherlock's hand into his lap, allowing him to feel the hard evidence of his arousal.
“I’ve missed you, John,” he says.
“In his letter, he called you Mary.” John's tone isn’t accusatory; it’s simply an observation. “Earlier, you said you use a fake name. So I assume he’s referring to you.”
Sarah and Gabriela don't laugh. "She's actually an attorney, John. She went to Harvard Law School."
Sherlock’s mouth slowly turns upwards. "You never concede in an argument, do you?"
"John!" Sherlock lowers himself onto the table, bringing John with him. "Your lips need to stop moving so I can kiss them."
“You’re welcome. I’m really, really happy for you, and I know it will all sort itself—“ she looks back up to see Sherlock dialing John’s number on his phone. “What, you’re calling him now?”
It’s their third kiss, yet somehow still different from the first two; it’s chaste, heartfelt, and short. Heartfelt and short, like John.
He maneuvers and guides John until they are in perfect alignment, and John slowly sinks down until Sherlock is buried inside him.
: No one
John slips out of bed carefully so he doesn’t wake Gabriela. He tiptoes out of the room, still wearing his pajamas. The door quietly clicks shut behind him, and he walks through the eerie, barely-lit hallway to the second floor. The walls are a dark shade of green; the coarse, aged carpet a darker shade still.
Sherlock’s eyes then flicker over to Mary. “You’ve brought him here.”

Sherlock seems to have fallen back into the pattern of avoiding John’s gaze. “Probably for the best. I believe I had a bit too much wine.” He senses John sliding the tips of his fingers over his thumb—a habit he displays when he feels a lack of control.
“It’s quite sexy,” Sherlock states, tucking a short strand of hair behind John’s ear.
. A jealous spouse. A fall. A moment of deep awareness.
John gets moved from urgent care to short term care the next day. He's got a much nicer room: bigger, with natural sunlight, and his own bathroom and shower—there's even a lock on the door. The two of them are pleasantly surprised by the upgrade. Sherlock considers briefly that his brother may have pulled some strings, but no matter. He plans to make good use of the door lock to facilitate himself and John sleeping past five in the morning.
"Half the time you're speaking to me, I'm not even there!" John argues.
Carefully, he lays Sherlock onto his back once more. Sherlock keeps his legs wrapped tightly around his waist, and he whispers into John’s ear that he loves him. John whispers it back as he presses into him inch by inch.
Sherlock’s not surprised. It’s one of the most John things in the world, really.
John’s forehead is sweating, and his cock is hard and twitching in his hand.
“Oh, but we do.”
Sherlock looks up at him. Stares at his kiss-swollen mouth. He misses it already. "And I am? Worth kissing, I mean."
Once Sherlock's curiosity gets the better of him, he leans over John's shoulder to inspect the hymnal from which he plays. The notes on the page are blurred and scrambled, but the title is quite clear:
“Did you just kiss the top of my skull?” he asks playfully.
“No,” John replies.
“Hold on a moment,” John intervenes. “If you’re touching the wooden piece, how are we to know you’re not moving it?”
Perhaps, Sherlock thinks, like with all new material, there’s simply a learning curve.
John places another kiss there. And another. And another. Brings his lips to the shell of Sherlock's ear. Releases a warm exhalation that causes Sherlock to shiver.
“We were hired to keep him out of trouble,” Marci adds.
"Good." John releases a warm breath against his ear. "Because I need to tell you that you've never been more gorgeous than you are right now."
Sherlock looks up from his phone and over to Molly. “I’ve got to cut this short—“
“Yes,” Sherlock agrees. “Busy not existing.”
Sherlock’s memory flashes forwards to tonight, in the kitchen with John.
realising how much he loves it.
Sherlock looks back at him, distraught, jaw twitching as though it's straining to form words.
"Molly loves you!"
John places a hand beneath his chin, gently taking back his gaze. "Yes. It is. I kiss women, and I kiss men. I kiss whomever I find worth kissing, if they find that I'm worth kissing as well."
John says none of this.
Sherlock sighs emphatically. "Please know that I do not care about your personal life—not even a tiny bit—and that I am only asking you this in hopes that you will leave: why is she angry?"
"Hello, John. You are more—" Sherlock kneels down to retrieve his water bottle. "—unsheathed than usual."
John is right. Mrs. Hudson spoke to them as she always does: chipper and loquacious and with a wide and loud selection of opinions—not at all surprised to find them in the midst of an amorous encounter.
The women look over to the bar, waving and smiling, and William gives them a flirtatious wink in return.
John grins. "Join me on the sofa?"
A wave of understanding falls across Sherlock’s face. “And I miss having you there with me,” he admits.
"Yes," Sherlock mentally responds.
John wishes that his stomach would quit doing somersaults. “I don't think I'll ever be ready," he says. "But that's not going to stop me."
"I promised I would help you!" Moriarty reminds him. "And you were mine, finally mine, and I thought it would always be that way. But you never, ever, ever looked at me the way you look at
“John?”
Sherlock supposes that Brook’s students likely find him attractive—and though he has the ability to recognise this, it has little effect on him. There is something, however—a comfort, a kinship in Brook that he immediately catches on to.

“Mary,” he says gently.
She takes a seat next to him. “Yes.”
police officer.
“We’ll keep you in the loop,” Lestrade assures them. “If you need me, Sherlock has my number. Meanwhile, get some rest. We'll return tomorrow morning with updates."
“Ah, John.” Sherlock’s fingers remain crossed beneath his chin; he doesn’t look up. “You’re still awake?”
They reach the awning. John tries to catch his breath. It's much smaller than he expected; at arm's length, it barely covers them both.
He was hoping for a snog and a stiff drink, but all he’s got to show for tonight is a text from Sarah—cancelling their date—and forty less dollars in his pocket.
But John has some damned drinks to order—so he waits patiently as William serves the next person in line. He waits patiently as he moves on to the next person, and the next, and the next.
“Oh!” Molly picks up her scalpel. “I need details. How did he tell you? Were there flowers? Is he a good kisser?“
He hasn’t taken it all from you. Unless you’re Sherlock Holmes.
"You're probably right." John takes his hand. "I think we're off to a good start. I say we work with the current material, and come up with whatever else we need as it all unfolds. Sound good?"
No. They aren’t bloody from the wound; they’re bloody from disuse. From relentlessly clawing at Sherlock’s chest.
“John.” He squeezes John’s hand. “Why don’t you get a closer look at it, so you can explain how correct I am?”
“Such as…?”
“Raise up, sweetheart," he says.
John nuzzles against his shoulder, sending a shiver of pleasure through his body. “Yeah. Okay. So here's the thing, Sherlock." He clears his throat, which is an adorable habit he has before saying something he believes to be profound. “I love you. You are...without a doubt, the most brilliant man I’ve ever met. But you’re so much more than that. You’re also brave, and you’re wise, and you’re kind. See, you...you sometimes wear this mask, you know, to keep people from getting close to you, to knowing who you really are. But for some reason, you never wore that mask around me. I suppose that means you trusted me. And I feel incredibly lucky for that. Because I got to know the real you: the man who loves fiercely, and who fights to do what is right, even when it’s not easy.”
"Perhaps we should finish this bottle first," Sherlock continues. "And after that… we will see where the night takes us." And then, his toes faintly brush against John's, and John is thankful for toes, as well. Not in a kinky way. Just in a
“I don’t even use my real name,” Marci says, but John doesn’t think to ask her what it is.
John rips his eyes from the newspaper, trying to determine whether Sherlock is serious.
The woman beams. “I do! I’ll give you my card.” She reaches into her pocket and pulls it out, handing it to John, who takes it warily.
John, who stands besides him, leans closer to take a look. “Nice. How much does it cost?”
He doesn’t know where he’s from. If he has a husband or a dog or a child or maybe even a wife. Whether he has any passions, or simply tends the bar all night so he can study all day. Doesn’t know his phone number, or his address, or his astrological sign. He doesn’t even know his surname.
” answers in his Mind Palace; he assumes (correctly) that this knowledge will prove valuable in the future.
This is why, despite our closeness—and my skills of observation—he was able to murder five different women without me knowing.
The florist lowers her voice. “Let me know once you set a date,” she says with a wink. “I could probably move you two lovebirds up on the list for the blood aeonium.”
He can't say he's unhappy to have avoided that.
But she won’t allow it. “Slow down.” She grabs him by the arm, her fingernails cutting into him, pulling him back. “You nearly knocked me over there, bud.”
Amongst their noises of blissful adoration, Sherlock becomes increasingly grateful that it's past Mrs. Hudson's bedtime—otherwise, she'd definitely overhear. Knowing that John prefers stealth over style, he smashes his lips into his in order to stifle his moans. And for good measure, he smashes his body closer as well.
“William.” John firmly grabs the collar of the man’s fancy, pretentious coat, pulling him in until their faces are centimeters apart.
He soon finds himself in front of room 201. He pauses before the door, and the bronze numbers tower before him, and he begins to question his own sanity. Briefly, he considers turning back—but decides against it.
“I like this place.” John looks over at the enormous bookshelf on the wall. “I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. It captures your essence. And I—wait. Is that a human skull on the bookshelf?”
"What's one thing you've always dreamt of doing, and what's kept you from doing it?" Sherlock traces the skin of John's inner wrist with his fingertip as though he's committing it to memory.
They are mysteries for which Sherlock craves a solution. And thankfully, one evening the third week in hospital, the mystery of John's skin (along with other said mysteries) is solved.
: Donovan, Anderson (lie, he chickened out before jumping), Molly
“Thank you.” Sherlock’s cheeks turn a dusky shade of pink. "Hold on to me now—as tightly as possible."
There’s no need for two people to write a love story when they can simply perform it.
He squints; the photograph is somewhat blurry, though he’s positive it’s the Molly from The Strand. He’s also positive she told him she’s 23 years old and a current PhD candidate at MIT—yet, the caption states she has already obtained her PhD.
The song comes to an end. William lets the final chord ring out until it fades into silence.
And so begins the uncomplicated, unspoken agreement between John and William the Bartender.
She regards him for a moment, her stern features beginning to soften, and she sets her hand atop his shoulder reassuringly. “His safety is a priority to all of us. As is yours, John. I give you my word.”
It’s the most powerful thing he’s ever been a part of.
John receives about a half dozen text messages on the day of New Year’s Eve. Two from his sister, one from Mike, a flashy one in Mandarin, one wrong number.
"You're welcome," he replies softly. "I hope you'll find it comfortable."
He carefully leans in until his lips are directly over her ear, dropping his voice low. “Is he dead, Irene?”
Argh. Sherlock feels like banging his head into a nearby pillow. “I want
John hangs up. The girls watch him expectantly. “It's a—erm. It's an escort service. For S&M or...something. It's called The Whip Hand. They have a website."
John releases his chin. “Of course. But if and when you do—”
doesn't mean it wasn’t true," Mrs. Hudson adds. "You know how much I absolutely adore John, but he is the most emotionally repressed person I know. Besides you, dear."
John opens his eyes. William is still there. He's there, but he looks broken, and John can't bear the sight of it. So he takes a step forwards and kisses him on the lips.
Sherlock doesn't ask why.
The phone rings and goes directly to voicemail, and in his message, John pours out his entire, whisky-drenched heart:
John squeezes Sherlock's hand in acknowledgement. "I remember."
"It's alright," John reassures him. "Though I do prefer the sounds
“Oh.” A smile settles on Molly’s face. “That’s cool! I’ve met Sarah a few times at the bar. She’s pretty great.”
Sherlock's mouth drops open so far it practically hits the ground. He drops his water bottle as well. It does hit the ground. It hits the ground with a loud clattering sound.
John grins at him and brings his hand to his cheek. "You're crying, love."
Sherlock doesn’t understand any of it, really. He doesn’t understand why there are no discussions about it, and he especially doesn’t understand why they kiss all day and go to their separate beds at night.
He runs his fingers through his hair impatiently. He just wants to sleep. But he knows that if William is in danger, every minute counts—and that every minute is one minute closer to seeing him again.
John chuckles nervously. “You’re my mate, Sherlock. Mates want the best for each other, right? It simply isn’t right that you’ve never been kissed. You ought to know what it’s like.”
“Of course he dressed up!” Anderson asserts. “His costume is…wait…” he peers at the detective inspector. “...A man with a boring name!”
Sherlock hears John's footsteps across the floor as he walks towards him. He smells his musky John-scent, somehow lovelier than it was before being trapped in a tiny cabin for three weeks.
And he’s never going back to the Strand.
Within an hour or so, the vehicle pulls into the parking lot of an abandoned motel. The rooms are dark and empty; the sign has fallen off, and they are surrounded by nothing but empty desert on all sides.
“What wonderful news!” Sherlock grabs John by the arm and squeezes with excitement.
“I apologise for startling you,” the man says, though the unveiled amusement in his voice says otherwise. “No need to worry about my brother; he’s stepped out to get a cup of tea for you. He will return shortly.”
“I completely understand what you mean.” John takes her hand in his. He finds her openness refreshing. “And you know what? You can’t help who you love. This is just further proof of that.” He squeezes her hand lightly. “I mean, what sane person would choose to fall in love with men? Because when it comes to relationships, men can be fucking nightmares.”
But the kiss ends as abruptly as it had begun, with John moving away to lock eyes with him. “Lie down on the bed again, Sherlock,” he demands. “On your back. Now.”
John can barely be bothered to lift an eyebrow. “And what’s that?”
"Since always."
"No. I would not." As of five seconds ago, Sherlock is giving John the silent treatment. This, from what he has gathered, is a great pillar of marriage.
“Anyway,” she continues, taking a breath in an effort to subdue her laughter. “Here’s the story: I just happened to be at the bar with my classmate, Elizabeth. Sherlock spotted you coming in and panicked. He quickly pulled me aside and demanded I give you attention. It was definitely odd, but I was already a wee bit drunk, and thought you were cute.”
When a murder occurs, there is always a discernible increase in Sherlock’s mood. This is measurable in degrees using the Observable Scale of Holmes’ Internal Temperament (O-SHIT). On a day sans-murder, the O-SHIT hovers between sixty and eighty degrees. A murder often boosts it past ninety; it surges well past one hundred if John is on the case as well.
That’s when John recalls last night—the sorrow in his eyes as he looked at him; the melancholy in his words as he spoke. "I’m sorry,” he says. “I didn’t mean to imply anything.”
John moves his gaze to the sofa, where yet another woman is seated. He wasn’t expecting a fourth—although she seems vaguely familiar. She’s thin, with fair skin and dark brown hair, and she’s dressed simply in a black jumper and black slacks.
"I think it will," John responds thoughtfully. "But I should probably practice as well, just to be sure."
“What?”
But Sherlock is already sliding off of his lap and onto the floor, kicking his trousers over his ankles. John inhales sharply, clutching onto Sherlock’s shoulders as his lips slide effortlessly over his cock.
They barely make it through the door and shut it behind them before Sherlock begins to peel John's wet trousers down from his waist. John works swiftly to catch up, unbuttoning Sherlock's shirt, using his body to press Sherlock on closer to whatever their final destination may be—one of their beds? The sofa? Perhaps even a chair?
The room erupts with sounds of pleasure. Sherlock bucks up into John, clenching around him with everything he has. John hardens his abdomen, slowing the rush of pleasure while gathering all of his strength to push back. Sherlock uses his legs to pull John in deeper, deeper, until they find a rhythm that works for the both of them, graceful and passionate as dancers on a stage.
sees..." He clears his throat, his cheeks becoming a dark shade of pink. "Unless—is it customary for the groom to kiss the best man prior to his wedding ceremony?"
“May I ask what you’re reading?” he inquires.
“John. John, John, John.” Sherlock sniffles, gracefully wiping the tears from his face. “I—I don’t know how to respond. I mean you, you should know that I feel—I’m also… I mean…”
Sherlock tilts his head back to gaze up at him. "Just...what?"
How can he? How can he ruin this perfect moment, this sequence of perfect moments stacked on top of one another? How can he strike them down, toppling them over like a house of cards?
Outside is quite cool, and the wind is picking up, but Sherlock's chest is indescribably warm, surging with a euphoria he can't contain. Purposefully bringing his hands up to the sides of his mouth in order to project his voice, he takes a deep breath, and he releases the words that are dying to get out.
“Pretend sex, you mean?” Molly's attention shifts behind him as she waves Mrs. Hudson over. "And no," she blatantly lies. "She called me a little bit ago and asked what I was up to, and, erm—I told her I was on my way to dinner, and she insisted on joining!" She chuckles nervously. "You know how headstrong she can be!"
William holds up a hand to silence him, proceeding to take a customer’s order—and walks off again to make their drink.
“Sherlock may have started off as an assignment,” she says as Gabriela takes her hand reassuringly. “But he’s become more than that. He’s my friend, too. And at all costs, he must be protected. How am I supposed to sit idly by as the man he loves digs the both of them into a deeper and deeper hole?”
Sherlock chuckles. “My dear Watson. What libations did you partake of this evening that you don’t recall the year, or recognise your own home?”
"Of course I do. I have an outstanding memory.”
"Oh," John breathes, lifting his hands to the sides of William's face. "Hello. I thought I'd lost you." He caresses William’s cheekbones with his thumbs, and at first, William leans into John's touch, appearing overcome with relief. Seconds later, though, his face twists with confusion.
But this already describes his and John’s relationship. There must be something he's missing.
He then becomes concerned for John’s current state of mind: has he had a bit to drink? Has he finally gone insane, driven to the edge by a life of danger and mystery and adrenaline? Because such compliments aren’t a typical part of their conversational repertoire.
Sherlock smiles at him, and the corners of his eyes crinkle, and John’s heart races. “I would have been fine without it,” he says.
"That's not a thing."
With that, Sherlock’s movements come to a halt. He brings his head up and gazes at John with a curious expression—a look in his eyes that John has never seen.
William is visibly relieved, but he continues to shield the vodka shelves. “Noted,” he says thoughtfully. “Belvedere isn't a poor choice, but may I suggest the American Star?” He pulls a tall pink bottle from the shelf and twists off the cap. “It’s infused with chiles, and it goes down with a smooth, smoky flavour. Perfect for a Bloody Mary.” He dips his forefinger into the bottle and holds it to John's mouth. "Try it."
He knows that John watches every move he makes.
But the little subgame is only fun for a round or two. Sherlock instead begins storing all the “
As he and Gabriela take a taxicab to their hotel in the old downtown district, John notes that Sin City is somewhat less lively than expected. It seems more of an expansive desert metropolitan area than a city of flashing lights, but Gabriela assures him that nighttime will be much different.
"Like this?" He sweeps the stray lock of hair from Sherlock's forehead and tucks it behind his ear, and the action is so astoundingly delicate it gives Sherlock goosebumps.
“Molly?” John’s eyes grow wide. “You spoke to Molly? And Irene?
“For now,” comes a miffed voice from the other end of the room. John glances over to see Irene seated at the edge of the bed, wearing a satin robe, her arms and legs crossed. Clearly, she’s far less excited to see him than Molly is.
Sherlock huffs. Fiercely annoyed, he swipes Lestrade's phone from his hand and hangs it up.
"Simply an acquaintance."
"No, listen. The Woman. He flips the card over to show her. "The words are capitalised. Like it's a name."
“John.” Sarah’s voice is stern enough that John finally glances up at her. “Have you even been to Vegas before? It’s probably not a good idea to pursue a dangerous situation like this on your own, especially with little knowledge of the city…”
John reaches the bottom of the driveway, but the limousine is not there. “Jim?” he calls out.
be holding hands before we go inside," Sherlock advises. “And we cannot let go of one another thereafter; it will ruin the costume. Understood?”
“I’d love some.”
“How do I look?” Sherlock asks John as he steps into the sitting room at half past seven.
Sherlock happens to know that married people also hold hands. And sometimes they kiss. And as of the other night, these are things he and John apparently do as well. So what now?
“He’s thirty-six.”
As they all sit together happily—John close enough to Sherlock to feel his warmth—John thinks to himself that this is what family ought to be like.
"Mm.” Sherlock's fingers creep near the hem of John's trousers, tucking the fingertips barely beneath them, touching his cool skin. “What did you have in mind?”
Being fake married to John is grand. Sherlock can't help pondering why they've never been fake married before. He wonders, in fact, why anyone would ever get
The man glances up over his newspaper, surprised, crows-feet eyes squinting in amusement. “Watson. You don’t normally call me that unless we’re making love.”
is not one of them.
“I can’t reveal the exact location,” Lestrade responds. “But we’re heading closer to the base. You’ll be under top-tier surveillance while we determine the next step.”
“Mm-mm.” With a startled grunt, Sherlock brings both hands to John’s chest and gently presses him away. “John, we can’t. Not—” he trails off before finishing the sentence.
“Yes. I’d like one of those, please."
And that’s his conclusion. William doesn’t care, so neither should he.
Sherlock’s eyes are now fully leaking. He wipes his face on John’s t-shirt. “It’s my first time being a boyfriend, you know. I’ll have much to learn.”
"Well, yes. But long before that, even."
He’s been offered the chance to make this night
Sherlock moans into John’s mouth, cups his face in his hands, and kisses him back with matching enthusiasm. But in an instant, the mood shifts, and his moan transforms into an utterance of disapproval.
John and Sarah get into her car and drive away, and John seriously questions his sanity.
"Too much?" John asks again.
He follows the echo of footsteps through the alleyway opposite the bar, where he finds William standing in the shadows, his back against the harsh brick wall.
Sherlock freezes, stunned by the kind words. "Oh. Well, thank you."
since John has had any form of intimate physical release, and the flat is buzzing loudly with echoes of his bisexual frustration. And it makes no difference if Sherlock retreats to his Mind Palace, or John retreats to his bedroom; it’s a dark cloud, taking up so much space, so permeating that it rattles every one of Sherlock's (many, many) brain cells.
John raises his head and meets his eyes. "Of course. She’s my family. I tell her everything."
Though young, Brook was well-known in the field of forensics, and the constant opportunity for investigating cases alongside him became intoxicating.
“She’s here,” she whispers. “Wish me luck.”
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone, and he shows it to Sarah. “I received a text message the other day from what I assumed was a wrong number, so I didn’t give it much attention.”
"Is it not obvious?" Sherlock thinks John probably hit his head harder than the doctors initially suspected. "They were going to take you away!"
“Extremely certain.” He doesn’t miss a beat. “You saw the gift, then?”
Sarah stifles a laugh. “I
John rocks into him with all of the speed and force that he can muster, and that’s when Sherlock tells him he loves him.
“Me too,” John responds. The air between them is electric, and it terrifies him.
Some say that while a person is experiencing a traumatic event, time slows down—even stops. But today, for John, time disappears. One second, he’s in front of the house, and he hears a gunshot—
Whatever
John wouldn't be the first to say any of this, of course. And Sherlock wouldn't be the first to know it. So John continues to imagine what it would be like, wandering the labyrinth and plucking flowers wherever he may find them.
"Erm.” Sherlock clears his throat, still attempting to even out his breaths. “You and I were inside a cathedral…which was also a theatre. And there was a performance. I didn’t know my lines, and the stage was moving...but before that, you were playing the pipe organ. John—what's a Journey song?"
As he takes the ring from the box and slides it over John's finger, he watches closely, errant curl falling over his forehead, brow furrowing as though he's attempting to solve a puzzle. But once the ring is on, his face lights up with pride.
Less than a metre away is the moonlit silhouette of Moriarty, staring pensively over the edge of a building and into the night. With a chillingly precise awareness of his surroundings, he speaks even before Sherlock stirs.
"Cake?" he offers.
A life for a life.
Sherlock has now been stuck on the Clarendon murder case for three days straight. He can’t focus. He can’t think. And it is one million percent John’s fault.
He looks downwards, where the building lights flicker like fireflies in a city that is just at the tips of his toes, yet thousands of feet away.
"I'm exhausted." Sherlock flops back onto the pillow and covers his shoulders in blankets.
The man opens his mouth as if to answer, but he quickly decides against it. "Let's cut to the chase. What is your relationship with Sherlock Holmes?"
“That would actually be...fantastic.” John gives a little sigh of relief as Molly pulls him to the lounge area and into a seat. She’s a scrappy one. She’s almost disturbingly strong for such a tiny human. “Thank you again,” he says as she walks back towards the bar. “I’m afraid I can’t stay long, though.”
John chuckles softly, rubbing small circles at Sherlock's jaw. "No need to be sorry. It's just..." he pauses.
"John's in there," he thinks, equal parts eager and apprehensive. He takes a step towards his bedroom, imagining John's form fitting shirt and the scruff on his neck.
to be sexy, Sherlock.”
“Shut up,” Sherlock says.
And thus, the brain is the victor.
Because it’s been
John lifts his hand to smooth away another curl that falls over Sherlock’s forehead. “I think it’s amazing. You’re a brilliant man, Sherlock. Whatever you choose to do, you will do with equal brilliance. I don’t care if you choose to solve murders, or make cocktails until we’re in our seventies. All that matters to me is that you’re happy.”
"Afraid not." John gazes up at him incredulously, but his eyes contain a hint of amusement.
John laughs nervously. "Thank you! And you’ve got so many good ideas!"
“I don’t know. I see. Would you like to see as well?” He smiles at John, then—and with that smile, John suddenly feels no fear.
“It isn’t just you,” Sherlock reassures him. “Must be that friend of Lestrade’s Mrs. Hudson mentioned earlier.”
“Sherlock,” Lestrade admonishes, but there’s no vitriol in his tone; in fact, John thinks he can detect a flash of amusement.
Before, he felt that he already knew what he needed to know about Sherlock. But there's an empathy that comes only from learning the truth of his past; and he aches, knowing all he’s endured.
believe that you could take him. But...he’s a powerful man in the industry. I’d seen the way he dealt with people he felt wronged by, and...he made their lives hell. I didn’t want to risk it.”
Eventually, John's hands drift past Sherlock's shoulders, trickle over his collarbone, and roam to the buttons of his collar.
“Yes, good.” John glances up at them briefly. They wave, and he politely nods. His head is too foggy with anger towards the tosser behind the bar to pay them any mind. “I apologise, Mike, but the bartender refuses to serve me.” He removes his bank card from his wallet. “This round is on me—but perhaps you’ll have better luck with him.”
“Not jealous,” Sarah protests, and she reaches up to weave her fingers through Gabriela's hair.
It’s a new chapter. There's a lot of playful banter, which was super fun to write. Also, John has a beard, now. This should come as a surprise to nobody who has read my stories before.
Yes. Sherlock is going mad, indeed. He tells himself it's cabin fever.
“Merry Christmas, William.” He opens the door and walks out into the frozen twilight, leaving love—and The Strand—behind him.
Sherlock presses his mouth to his, slowly and sweetly. “Ten minutes ago, I thought I would never kiss you again, and here you are. These are happy tears.”
“And how much time do we have before he comes looking?” John is sure Sherlock is referring to his brother.
John’s enthusiastic moan is all the answer he needs.
that's what Sherlock is happy about: this all helps them become more brilliant at acting the part. Sherlock—his Sherlock, ever the perfectionist. He's always known this about him.
“He’ll probably… get you drunk on Bud Light and try to convince you that the Metric system doesn’t exist.”
"Hold on tightly," he says.
odd.” Sarah reaches into her handbag. “We wandered around and couldn’t find anyone there, but we did find this.” She holds out a lavender pouch made of patent leather. “My wallet. All of its contents are still there. Credit cards, IDs, even cash.”
“No need to apologize,” Sherlock assures him. “It’s fine. I’m fine. I suppose I’m just not sure how to respond to such remarks, especially coming from you.”
But at this particular moment, Marci’s head on his shoulder, and he’s feeling a little bit smug, and he finds himself needing to know for sure. His eyes dart to the bar, meeting William’s— just as he predicted—but the other man lowers his gaze immediately.
“Sure.” John scoots forwards towards the Ouija board, fingers still laced between Sherlock’s. “There’s got to be something connected to it. Hidden wires, perhaps? A magnet? An optical illusion?”
3. Talk. ✅
William pulls away, his mouth kiss-swollen, and he stares back at him as though he's sure this is all a dream.
He’s right. It is important to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes. Sherlock considers what he knows about married life. His parents are happy in their marriage, but he was always too busy pursuing his own interests to study their behaviour. The only other source of knowledge he has comes mostly from his cases—where at least one party wants to/may have/definitely did kill the other.
"I—" Lestrade stammers, squinting at Sherlock for a moment, then at John. "I'm confused."
“Go, or you will die,” Sherlock sneers.
John leans into him, sets a kiss to his collarbone, to his Adam’s apple, to his jaw. Increases the speed of his hand as their cocks become nearly drenched in their own wetness. Loses himself in the sensation of their warm, velvety skin gliding together.
John falls onto the sofa; his body still tense. He takes a swig of his drink before setting it onto the side table.
John is accustomed to his deductions by now—normally, he responds with a sort of neutral fascination. This time is different. A smile tugs at his lips. “You smelled the launderette on me, hmm?”
"Jesus fuck," John murmurs, shivering and panting. "God, Sherlock, you are so—"
He doesn’t let go of Sherlock.
John pulls Sherlock in and twirls his body towards him in a protective, eager embrace, and Sherlock collapses into him with a stifled sob.
"Yeah? Well—” John clears his throat. Sherlock’s not wrong. “Alright. You've got me. I'm actually impressed. You did amazing, Sherlock,” he says as he admires the band. “The ring is perfect. Thank you.”
“It will be too difficult for you to climb the stairs to yours. So you’ll stay in mine for the time being.”
John keeps his eyes glued to William from across the crowded bar. William wraps his blue scarf around his long, pale neck, and he walks out the back door.
So the following Saturday, gathered around an exam table in the morgue, he decides to ask Molly Hooper.
"Shhhh. It's alright. Moriarty can't hurt us now."
"He’s brought his entire game tonight, hasn't he? Desperately trying to woo you. Dressing up, flirting, wine and dinner. Flowers? Are there flowers?"
Sherlock thinks he detects disappointment in John’s tone, but he chooses to ignore it. “We could always tell her we’re practicing restraint techniques.” He lifts his eyebrows suggestively.
being held in place by them—but he can't think about that right now.
Ignoring Sherlock’s ill-fated attempt, Molly tilts her head in Donovan’s direction. “It’s the cannabis that does it,” she explains. “Those two—they’re absolutely mental most of the time, but they’re fairly decent under the influence.”
His skin glows in the low light; snowflakes land in his curls, forming a halo around his head. And his perfect lips part when he exhales, painting the air with his frosty breath.
Lestrade releases a breath of laughter. "I don't know. Forever? I mean, maybe not forever. I assume you didn't know one another as infants, but if you did, you were probably in love then, too."
John beams. “Perfect!” He pulls his shirt over his head and quickly begins to unbutton his trousers.
Sarah walks her backwards until they reach the wall. She pins her against it, moving a hand to the back of Gabriela's thigh.
William rises from the piano bench; he sighs into John, surging forward and sealing their mouths together. John kisses him back sweetly, pouring his love out, hoping to take every ounce of sadness from his lips. But even as the kiss is broken, William tastes like tears.
“If she was simply fond of your scarf, why wouldn’t she have kept it?”
Until that weekend, when Stamford invites him to join for drinks on his birthday. He’s set on going to the Strand, and John is conflicted when he doesn’t make an effort to convince Stamford otherwise. He can’t say no, anyway. Stamford’s been his best mate since his first year of uni. Perhaps they’ll get lucky, and William won’t be there. Or maybe he’ll be there, but he’ll be less of a knob. Either way, John’s confident that he can handle one rude bartender.
John hushes him again. "I know," he whispers. "But you've got to trust me. Don't be afraid. I love you, and you need to know that. You need to know that I will love you for as long as the universe allows, and I will not let you take the fall alone."
So he decides, quite early on, that he won’t be visiting The Strand on Christmas. Spending the holidays with someone carries a weight that most days do not. Christmas, especially, is meant to be spent with friends, family, and lovers—and he and William are none of these things.
“Shh!” she shushes him. She glares daggers into him, grabbing him by the shoulders and pulling him in roughly through the door.
Allow me to explain. As a student at Oxford, I assisted a young professor by the name of Doctor Richard Brook. He was someone I greatly admired, and the admiration was mutual. We quickly formed a deep and complex friendship.
He scans the room desperately for some sort of idea.
John wants to ask William what he means, but William has already taken his mouth away from him, pulling him in for another breathless, passionate kiss.
“John.” He takes John by the shoulders and shakes him lightly.
As a student Sherlock is eager and dedicated. He arrives early most days for kissing practice with John; often, he stays late as well.
William softly traces the hair beneath John’s navel. “Nor have I,” he rumbles. “How might we alleviate that?”
"Not at all." John gives him an affirming smile. "I was embarrassed. Mortified. Because I thought you—Look. I told you before, Sherlock. I'm fine with whatever you want, and I meant that."
Sherlock’s words are dizzying, but as he stammers and shifts in his seat, John can't help but admire another side of Sherlock he rarely sees—timid. It's rather adorable.
Molly’s spoon slips out of her fingers, landing in her mug and splashing coffee all over the table. She finds her own awkwardness highly amusing, and she doubles over in laughter. John finds it endearing, and can’t help but genuinely join in with her. It’s actually sort of difficult not to like her.
The night is turning out much better than he planned—until he rises from his seat and finds himself cornered by a tall, handsome bartender.
“Your parents, of course.”
He arrives home at a quarter to ten. The lights are off in the sitting room of 221B, but once he enters, he notices a faint light glowing beneath his bedroom door. His heart begins to flutter, and he opens it to find exactly what he was hoping for.
John is thankful for knees.
to stop, or the police will think you’re a suspect.”
"You were
And then, John returns to the kitchen holding a bag full of food from their favorite Chinese restaurant.
arousal so profound and animalistic that it borders on overwhelming.
Sherlock removes his tongue and draws it over the smooth skin of John's testicles as he presses one finger into him. He twists the finger, twists his tongue over the base and head of his cock until the area is wet with saliva and pre-come.
“Ninety-five. Are you feeling quite alright?” Sherlock sets his paper and pipe onto the side table and peers at John, his expression one of great concern. “Your body language indicates that you’re feeling confused and unsettled. Are my deductions correct?”
"It's
“Awwww. The two of you are just adorable together,” the florist says appreciatively. “Have you set your date?”
Good morning, John. Or afternoon. Or whatever chunk of time finds you reunited with your phone. I revealed to you earlier that the reasons I love you are infinite. And as I lie awake next to you, some of them came to me. I want to share them with you, but if I tell you now, you probably won’t hear them. Because you’re sleeping.
Sherlock peeks out, slowly lowering his hands. "Alright," he says with caution, taking his own glass from the table. "Cheers. To what are we toasting?"
A slow song begins to play, and his two friends move to the dance floor. As they sway together, lost in their own world, Marci places a hand on his thigh.
"Done this? In three whole weeks of being here?"
By the end of week one, John begins daily physical therapy sessions. His targets are simple at first: basic range of motion, coordination and strength training—but soon, it’s time to try using the wheelchair. With two fractured legs and one broken arm, he requires quite a lot of help getting in and out of bed—but he's thankful for any chance to move about.
Another alert, and another, and another.
PS: I was a music major in college. I enjoyed geeking out with the musical terms.
"He has?"
“I think this is a conversation you need to have with him.”
“Did everyone else see what that little wooden thing just did?” Lestrade flails his arms towards Mrs. Hudson’s ouija board, his face paler than a corpse’s.
Sherlock exchanges another glance with John.
“John?”
John panics. He notices Sherlock's body stiffen.
They glance at one another. Sherlock lifts his eyebrows. John grits his teeth.
”Deal,” he finally croaks. She loosens her grip on him, but she doesn’t let go completely. That is, until William returns to the table.
"Well…" Sherlock clears his throat. "Lions."
Molly shrugs. “Stretching the truth is part of the job, I guess. We’ve all lied about our identity in one way or another.”
“Fuck.” His eyes fly open and he stumbles backwards.
One evening, there was a knock at my door. I opened it—it was Moriarty. He was a shell of who he once was; I could no longer detect a single piece of Brook in him. But I wasn’t afraid of him. I knew that whatever happened at that point was simply my destiny.
Sherlock is overcome by a surge of feelings so powerful that he's got no hope of quelling them. An acute combination of relief, affection and desire. An urgent need to kiss John, to be close to him physically, mentally, emotionally. And he feels so much more than that. John's got the uncanny ability to make him feel things he's never felt. Things he hasn’t got the words for.
John lets out a startled yelp as they stop just short of the bed.
Moral dilemmas aside, Sherlock is excited to hear of a new serial murder case to investigate. He is quite surprised to find that Brook does not feel the same.
“Fantastic,” John utters, expression treading somewhere between irritated and amused.
John nods, though his face is still buried deeply in Sherlock's chest, so he doesn't do it with a great range of motion; Sherlock will, however, accept his response.
Sherlock fidgets, laughing nervously as his gaze moves. “I may have said something to the medical staff after you were injured. And to that end, there may be certain...implications involving the two of us.”
John speaks soon after, but not to express his gratitude; he doesn't even meet Lestrade's eyes. "But it's not news to you."
"And it’s always the case," he replies simply.
But eventually, it does. And when they break the kiss for air, William looks at John, and John gets the feeling they’ve been looking at one another for longer than he knows.
"If I were your husband," Sherlock echoes, his voice wavering as John's warm breath mingles with his.
Molly and Irene both arrive within the hour, and are met with grateful, eager embraces. Sherlock thanks Irene first—wrapping his arms around her, kissing the top of her head and not letting go for a long time.
The very first time John and Sherlock exchange kisses and love confessions, they’re in the alleyway after a candle-lit dinner.
“That’s the first time I’ve heard you call me that,” Sherlock finally acknowledges, the rise and fall of his chest the only movement he makes. “My real name.”
"Well, not the entire time.” Sherlock rubs the sleepiness from his eyes. “I stepped away briefly to use the facilities and to acquire food. But otherwise, yes. You saved my life; I wasn’t going to leave you here.”
Gabriela pulls away and smiles. “We had fun tonight.”
"Molly!" he hisses across the table. "You invited Mrs. Hudson? To our sex conversation?"
John’s not sure where he is—or how much time has passed—when the sound of Gabriela tapping at the window awakens them.
"John," Sherlock chokes out, his heart racing at full speed. “Oh, god.” He throws his arms around John’s shoulders and pulls him close. "You're here."
Sherlock smiles brightly at him, leaning into his touch and placing soft kisses on his inner wrist. “I am happy. Very happy.”
She breathes in. “What the girls said earlier to you, about not knowing of Sherlock’s whereabouts? That’s a lie."
“Oh, yeah. Totally,” Anderson says.
Mary shrugs.“It became tedious,” she says dully. “If Moriarty hadn’t come to me, I probably would have died from the boredom.”
The heartrate monitor is suddenly very loud and very, very fast. The air is thick with an odd, silent tension. They hold onto each other's gazes until Sherlock forces words from his mouth to break it.
“You’re welcome.”
He clutches onto Sherlock's thin shoulders, shaking him lightly.
“More like bodyguards,” Marci corrects him. “But that does sound cooler.”
John’s imagination ventures unbidden to where the night might take them, and it takes them to
"You already know the answer to that." John stands before him, taking his hands and looking up to meet his eyes. "It begins at sunrise."
As she finishes her last word, she cries out with a breathless euphoria, followed by rhythmic gasps of pleasure, wet skin slapping against wet skin.
“Is this your first time at the Strand, John?”
If they keep kissing like this, John fears he’ll be lost in his desire—that the craving for his friend's taste will become carnal. So he attempts to end the kiss, but Sherlock bites his bottom lip softly to hang on. John laughs, sweeps his tongue over his mouth once more, and Sherlock finally releases him.
so that I can have sex with you. Understood?”
John’s face and neck burn with embarrassment, which is somewhat of a welcome condition in the face of the biting wind. He spins back on one foot to look up at the man at the doorway. “Yeah, hi, William. I was just, erm, in the neighbourhood, but I’m going now.”
John cowers at first; he has very few reasons to believe Sherlock won't hit him. But he stops just in front of John, his face and body softening a bit. “John.” His voice softens as well, but he’s still afraid. “You’re well?”
By the end of the first week, the lull in conversation only gets worse. As Sherlock’s prayers for murder continue to go unanswered, he begins to feign sleep while he and John are in bed—just to preclude the embarrassment.
"That's fantastic!" She grins politely. "And how did you meet?"
"Sherlock." John takes a step forwards, hugging him from behind. "Yes." He places a kiss on his shoulder. "I'm not good with words the way you are, but emphatically
