Yet when he was about to enter his chamber, he saw Marley’s face on the knocker- no, the knocker had turned into Old Marley’s face!
Then, rather involuntary after finishing the rest of the whiskey, John had kissed him. Accident or not, it definitely happened. The question is, would John repeat his action when he sobered up tomorrow?
John rubs his wand with his sleeve:
and Elizabeth’s. No heir to worry about. Of course that didn’t stop all the gossip newsletter in the world, hundreds of paparazzi and thousands of people to follow and document every move of them.
Sherlock did what he was told and John let him go again. More aggressive sounds followed, multiple punches were thrown. It took John too long and soon Sherlock had no air left. The burning began anew. His chest hurt like mad, as he would be suffering multiple heart attacks. There was no feeling left in his arms and legs, and he could sense how his eyes slowly closed.

The music plays again, and Sherlock knows he is supposed to get ready, but he can’t. He is now cuddling with the most perfect human being on this planet, and surely it cannot feel so good? It shouldn’t anyway. Sherlock knows he has to be grateful that John ever started to talk with him, let alone spend his free-time with the dancer.

Sherlock’s recovery to a somewhat normal (or normal to a Holmes at least) sleeping and eating routine is slow and painful and takes time, but John is back in his red chair and Sherlock is back in his dark chair and their fireplace is burning again. John kisses Sherlock Holmes and the man does not run away screaming but instead decides to kiss him back.
It was supposed to be a normal meeting between the two siblings.Mycroftt had texted him to meet him at the Diogenes Club, alone, and Sherlock had grudginglyy complied. He figured that his brother probably found out another terrible lie from Mary and was this time soconsiderated to leave it to Sherlock to break the news to John. He should have questioned the text message. Shouldn’t have come alone. He wasn’t that stupid after all, but Mary always brought out the worst of him.

John hoped that soon, he would crawl back into his bed, because the gladiator was ready to burst. He had not pleasured himself once, and the desire was eating on him. He could just go to a simple pleasure house, but he knew that no one would compare to the slave lying on his sofa. John wanted to spread these long legs, have these sinful lips and bury himself deep into Sherlock. He knew he could take his slave without question, but he wanted Sherlock to desire him too. John wanted to be Sherlock’s only supplier for pain and pleasure. He wanted to mark Sherlock’s body with his hands and teeth, until the only sound that escaped from the cupid bow was John’s name. Mine.
“Good.
Stella shouts, and Sherlock must have missed the joke because everyone else is laughing.
He says, and two wet fingers curled around Sherlock’s neck. His pulse is weak. “Not long now.
Sherlock says.
John presses his hand reassuringly: “I’m sorry, Sherlock.

"Mummy, I want to go home!"

Sherlock takes another sip of the whiskey. John is waiting patiently.

The audience of about fifty listen attentively to the auctioneer, who is reading aloud from his piece of paper. The small boy with the curly head and frightened blue eyes is standing next to him, his little hands bound behind his back.
The last minute of the old year starts, and John, ever the good host, hands everyone a glass of champagne and Sherlock gets his glass of fruit wine. John’s warm hands caress his fingers while handing the glass over, and Sherlock gets good goosebumps.
They had celebrated Christmas alone at Baker Street, just the two of them with a small tree, Chinese take-out and lots of wine. It ended with them spread under a dozen of blankets next to the fireplace, cuddling. Sherlock had gifted John with an expensive notebook, so John can take notes again on crime scenes. John had presented Sherlock with a short holiday to Edinburgh in Spring, as soon as Sherlock feels better.

who taught John everything about medicine and it was also him who gifted John his first sword. He didn’t remember much from his past life and his parents, only pale faces, but Harriet told him that they were British people, who had migrated to the rural area around Rome. Harriet decided to be called 'Harry' when she was 9, and John, being the younger one, didn't dare to refuse.
“Oh, thank god.
The man raised his gorgeous eyes and for a moment John was blinded with the light in it. On the slave market they seemed almost subdued compared too now. They shone in all forms of cover, from light green to deep blue. Something primal in John wanted the young man right on this table, NOW, but he restrained himself. Soon.
Mary throws her head back and laughs:
Later, he runs around the classroom and impresses the class with his deduction skills, by commenting on where they spent their holidays (three were in the United States — boring).

, and he tried but… well. It all came crashing down.
Sherlock says, and John’s laughter follows them home.
Sherlock has done the right thing. John was getting too close to Sherlock, and this is dangerous.
Mary quickly interrupted him: “You have to tell Holmes that this is all a big misunderstanding. You see, I saved Sherlock from Serbia, but it was still too dangerous for him. So I kept him safe.”
“I hope you have watched every single James Bond, Marvel and Stars Wars film, then. I want to win.
This Christmas, John is more grateful than ever before that somehow, against all odds, he and Sherlock are still alive at Baker Street. No murderous killers, no pool, no dominatrix, no hound, no roof can’t change that. John is grateful that Sherlock is here, not laying in a dirty grave, or in a Serbian prison, or in this case, in the basement of a cruel Santa Claus.
The wolf raises his head and breathes in her perfume and his body spray. The human inside of the wolf is gone.
John wanted to name her Catherine. John actually never wanted a child. Of course, he loves Rosie now that she is here and John is allowed to play happy father with a nice house, a normal job at the clinic and his irregular visits to his (best?) friend. And now that he seems to have mourned enough, he is looking for the new Mrs. Watson.

For now, nothing was more important that Sherlock Holmes was breathing, he was badly hurt, and he was drugged and bleeding and crying and John cut through the ropes, ripped away the gag and the needles, and there he was, Sherlock Holmes was looking at him again, and oh, they were both so broken, but at last the sun would shine on them again.

John says, takes Sherlock’s hand brushes gently with his fingers over Sherlock’s hand to calm him down. Crowded rooms can be a challenge to Sherlock’s finely tuned senses, and this hospital room is especially annoying with all the extra noises.
Keeping their relationship secret is surprisingly easy. John’s family had accepted their son’s unusual hobby (spending time alone at the beach or with his boat) a long time ago and didn’t question him when he was gone for multiple hours nearly every day.

Christmases in a row, and that we definitely deserve a good one.
Sherlock shudders. Without John’s help, Sherlock would have murdered or at least bitten the two teenagers, cursed them to a life of secrecy and pain.
He panics, and pure survival instinct kicks in. He aims his knee to the place where it hurts the most, and his assaulter hauls in pain, much to the delights of the other guests. There is no time to triumph for Sherlock though, because the hurt man shoves him into the arms of his accomplice, and Sherlock can feel sweaty hands grabbing his hips. He closes his eyes to escape the horror and wishes himself back home, with his books and Mrs Hudson cooking and Mycroft writing some important paper.
“Don’t forget to take those pictures. I was promised chest muscles.” Sherlock teases him, and John throws his head back and laughs heartily.
“That sounds like an unique name. Your father’s?

Sherlock blushes wildly and flees out of the door. This hadn’t been the first round of teasing, and to be honest, Sherlock wouldn’t mind being John’s most important person. John is two years older than him and started primary school this year, and Sherlock is terrified at the thought that John may forget about him, now that he is one of the grown-up boys.
According to God’s holy law,

There is no one to talk to, no one to deduce, no one who answers Sherlock or asks Sherlock or just chats with him about something entirely trivial, like the price of beer and the rugby game last Saturday.
John waves his arms awkwardly around.
John rarely opened the shoe box and looked at the items collected in it. He enjoyed his time in the military, it gave him a purpose, kept him busy and even offered him some sort of companionship. If he wouldn’t have been shot, he would have grown old with it.
This was nice, he supposed.
“The age thing was a lucky guess, you looked a bit older than me. Of course, you were a soldier at that age and with that muscles. You were using your right hand predominantly during the auction, held your left arm stiffly, your hand was shaking, but when the other buyer talked to you it was perfectly calm and you used it for the leash. So you were wounded in action and are now retired. As a civilian you wouldn’t need so many weapons, so maybe you are a guard or something, but that would be too boring for you, you need the action, so you became a gladiator and joined the arena. You probably have a death wish. The
Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock.
There is a hot young man waiting in the queue for coffee, and Sherlock can not concentrate. He has worked at Mrs Hudson’s bakery shop for nearly a year. It is a popular meeting place for many students and also teenagers, due to the cosy tables and cushioned chairs, the bookshelves and of course the different hot and cold drinks. The absolute highlight are the cakes and muffins Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock’s employer, regularly pulls out of her oven.

John laughs and Sherlock hides his smile behind his glass. John did not appear to be someone who often smiles, and Sherlock has made him laugh several times now!
“I am aware, so no one will notice us.
also has a small café at the front of it. Many neighbours pop in early in the morning to get their fresh cup of coffee and a scone. That is why this part of the store is simply called Speedy’s. There is a small checkout to the left of the entrance and on the right side are six tables with two chairs each crammed into the corner. Speedy’s not only offers coffee, but also hot chocolate, ten different tea categories, muffins, cake and more. Apart from the coffee, there is also a corner with one cosy armchair and several large pillows, inviting people for a quick read before deciding on whether to buy the book or not.
Sherlock says nonchalantly, while pouring Mrs. Hudson’s freshly baked Christmas biscuits into a fingerprinted blue bowl.
Sorry, I have been a total mess this entire evening. Every time I talk to you, I say crazy things.
cup? Or him, wearing the Healer uniform? A sober Harry? Or maybe even… John stops his thinking process. Surely no mirror can look that deeply into his heart.
“Holy shit…” Lestrade whispered, his face white as chalk.
They step onto a small glade, and John observed Sherlock’s face closely. His eyes widened comically, his mouth fell open, and his frown turned into a big smile. John’s heart glows at his husbands reaction. Oh, Thor, nothing is better than seeing a surprised Sherlock Holmes, especially when he elicited the reaction.

“We have contacted both the Americans and the Serbians. Your former girlfriend is highly wanted. I can assure you that they will treat her as she deserves to be treated.”
Sherlock Holmes says, stops playing and shakes his hand.
"Love, where are all our groceries?“ He asks, trying to sound patient.
Sherlock confesses.
Sherlock demands.
“I have never tried this on a virgin anymore, but I guess this will hurt a little.“
John is proud with himself of being so honest with Sherlock about his emotions. Maybe his therapy appointments are paying off! Although, at their next meeting, he should probably skip the whole “I shot my ex-wife and I don’t feel guilty about it, at all. How was your weekend?
How. How did this happen?
The boy stretched out his hand again. He was left-handed. He had a bit of ink on his fingers.
John gets up, pushes the chair a bit backwards, and Sherlock
Through the celebrating crowd of teenagers, John limps through, receiving praise for the decorations from all sides. With a content sigh, he falls down on his usual place next to Sherlock. It has been two months, but Sherlock can no longer imagine spending a meal without the reassuring professor at his side.
"This is what happens when you only eat gingerbread for eight days.“ He says, feeling extremely smug.
Wouldn’t that be horrifying. Sherlock tries to straighten out his back by drawing his knees shorter, but everything hurts too much and dear god he smells awfully.
John remembers their Christmases.
“Are you sitting comfortably?
Right, Christmas. Sherlock feels a surge of panic. Molly is knitting a personal gift for her boyfriend, and what is Sherlock doing? Not concentrating on his boyfriend’s rugby game, that’s for sure.
He marvels a bit at how normal this sounds in his head, while pretty much everyone normal would run away screaming.
It’s so cold, and he is so incredibly tired, but he also feels like he had slept for days.
What has just happened?
John sighs: “Unfortunately, yes. But at least, we have finally managed it.
In a few minutes, someone will enter the room and spread a ton of blood all over your clothes and the room. They will then burn an almost identical looking corpse on fire in the parking lot. I think that is going to occupy them for a while.

decided to talk with them about honest apologises later.
John promised himself that he would ask Mycroft to talk with Mary himself as soon as she was in custody of the British crown. He demanded answers. After that, Mycroft could leave her in his darkest cell and throw away the key for all John cared.
There are scratches on Sherlock’s chest, and his lip is bleeding.
In retrospect, he really should have known what really happened to them. There was only one person in John’s life, who would have been bold enough to take his dog tags. And John just found that person.
Sherlock sniffs and pulls the blanket tightly around himself. John decides that the call can wait for another hour. What the detective now needs is some comfort.
“It is nice.
“I have to finish shopping, just wait here, and we can go home after that.
“You call that a kiss?” Sherlock grumbled against his chest.
“Nope.” John answered, and finally left.
“Stop haunting me, leave me alone!
The students clap happily when they hear the news, and Sherlock does not miss a few appreciating looks from the older students into Watson’s direction. He is not the only one who has noticed how good the new teacher looks.

“I would love to see that.
Sherlock’s cock was still soft and for John absolutely perfect, though he was a bit more lean than John’s. The slave observed John as well, and the gladiator looked down at himself. He was tanned because of his outdoor work. He had well-built muscles on his arms, legs and stomach. John had lots of reason to be proud of his body. His cock was around a nest of golden hair and proudly erect.
“I have never done anything like before. No relationship, no kissing and no…
The slave took a deep breath and then spoke very fast.

but it makes no difference. The fan grabs his shoulders and presses his back against the toilet stall while he fumbles with his trousers. Sherlock stares at the atrocious sight in front of him, his knees shaking and his hands wet with fear.
The third part, a continuation of chapter 13 and chapter 14.
Sherlock would love to explain it for him, but his shift has not ended yet, and he does not want to disappoint Mrs. Hudson (although, she would probably excuse it — she keeps telling him to start dating).
John crawled under the blanket next to Sherlock. The young Holmes was laying with his back to him, his face covered by his arms. They light soon went out and the room full of children was drenched in darkness.
couldn’t think of a more cruel act. It was impossible to control the anger that was bursting out of him.
Santa shouts in panic and Sherlock eyes fly open like he was just electrocuted. The door to basement has been thrown open, and a certain Captain Watson is running down the stairs, pointing his gun threateningly at Santa. It turns out that Santa is not the bravest man around. He rushes up and tries to storm away (where to?), so John pulls the trigger.
John has already reached Sherlock’s hiding place. Of course, the other man immediately followed him, because that is what John does. Loyal until the end.

Of course.
The potion is still there. Sherlock checks it, but everything appears to be untouched. The next full moon will only be in a month, but it is better to stay prepared. The potions masters have come a long way in discovering the best potion, and the new version is certainly improved. Sherlock does not turn into a werewolf — harmless or not — if he takes the potion, so he can continue working, but it still causes terrible cramps, headaches, sometimes nausea and leaves him completely battered. Sherlock still needs to add the last ingredients, but that has to wait till one day before the full moon, otherwise it will not work.

An old talk with Irene came to his mind, who once made out with the girl from the bakery to get a discount for her
“Stop. I was lying through my teeth the whole time. You simply must know that. You must. Sherlock Holmes, you are the most important person in my life, and you saved me so many times, more times than I can count.

Never doubt that.

Today was the birthday of the glorious emperor, and the citizens of Rome expected a bloodbath. John intended to deliver them one. One way or another.
One of the disadvantages with this family was that nothing ever stayed a secret.
“He lied to you for nearly two months, but it’s always different with him, isn’t it? For you, the great Sherlock Holmes can do no wrong.” Mary exclaimed, throwing her hands in the air. “Why don’t you just snog him if you want him so badly?”
The first thing he sees is a no longer pregnant Mary, standing in the right corner of the small room, a gun in her hand, pointed at Sherlock. Mary. Blond, smiling, once pregnant Mary. The world was really starting to make him crazy today.

Sherlock was back to sleeping when Mycroft finally got the call they had all been waiting for.

Sherlock gasped. "Relationship?“ He could not believe what he just heard!
Holy shit.

In a cold February night, Mary’s lies and actions were supposed to finally catch her, but it all went down horribly. Mary kidnapped Sherlock right under
His determination changed when the sound came through the heavy door and into the dark chamber. It was Old Marley. His grey hair was bound in a thin ponytail, he wore tights and boots and the white dressing gown he died in. Thick bandages were wrapped around his head and chest.

John says with utter contempt, and with the third punch the tall football fan finally shuts up.
"The stars shine especially bright tonight.“
He resurfaced again, the clock said fifty minutes later, because his mom told him to just eat his food, it was gone cold now anyway.
“Thank you.” Sherlock said begrudgingly. Mycroft puts a pair of thick headphones on and busies himself with his laptop again. John wonders how they could possibly prevent Mrs. Hudson from suffering a heart attack.
The students hurry away, whispering to each other. Sherlock hopes that they won’t send a letter detailing the events to their parents.
Sherlock has lived with John for several weeks now and they have grown closer together.
The brother never really approved of John. First, he tried to pay John to look out for Sherlock and give information back to him, and he refused. After the begin of their relationship, he threatened to end his medical career and threw Harry out of her therapy. John couldn’t really blame

It is the day after the full moon, and Sherlock has a headache. He has not slept a minute the last two nights. Instead, he scratched his skin in pain and threw up the glass of water he forced down his throat.
Where he will properly spend the rest of Christmas and New Year’s Eve in his flat alone, only with his skull and his violin for company. Maybe Mrs. Hudson will bring up biscuits, she always misses him when he is working at school. She may be his landlady and not his housekeeper, but she is more of a surrogate mother. Sherlock misses her.
On the left and right side of the Hall are the gigantic pumpkins that

John tastes like wine, chocolate and a promise of tomorrow.
“I am not going anywhere, I promise.
Sherlock mumbles out.
"She earned a lot of money with the news articles, and you are still in friendly terms with her."
He answers. Sherlock does not mention that he received it for his continued sobriety, and the two teachers join the students in the air.

“I know. I know him, and I can help him.
when one of them goes missing, only Scotland Yard. That’s why it takes John nearly three days to reach the stairs leading to the basement, and in that time Sherlock was chained to a wall, ice-cold, dehydrated, and had his arms cut open.
John exclaims, and they start searching for a few stones to use for the eyes and the mouth.
“You are a healer and therefore careful, and I am a virgin. We don’t need it.
His feet brought quickly to the Room of Wishes. The door opened when he walked to it, inviting him in. It had turned into John’s and Sherlock’s favourite version, a cuddly room with a fireplace, which wasn't on at the moment, a soft chair, lots of bookshelves and most importantly, two beds. Sherlock threw himself into one of them and buried his quivering body under the blanket.
His lips looked even more kissable to Sherlock now that they were moving.
His head feels ready to burst. He is ready to sell a leg for a glass of water.
, shouted John angrily. She had every right to be upset with him. Manipulating Sherlock and emotionally abusing him was not something he would allow to continue.
“Irene, Sherlock will do that… step in their relationship when they’re both ready.
“Come on, cheer up! In a few hours, everyone will have gone to sleep, and we can finally focus on teaching again. I did not expect party planning to be so stressful.
“Careful with your feet, love.
“Of course, all my thoughts constantly spiral around you and your perfect body.” Sherlock says, deadpan. His character gets up, and with a swirl of his designed black coat he gets out his fishing nook and throws it into the blue sea.
“Rise and walk with me.
The room they wheeled John in is crowded with seven other patients, all with only mild injuries, but the noise and the chaos grates on Sherlock’s raised nerves. He shuffles on his hard chair and tries to find a position which is a bit comfortable, while patient number 2 is phoning her sister, patient number 5 is watching a show about zombies way too loud and patient number 7 is hollering at number 4 to hurry up in the bathroom.
, the boy shuffled with his feet, “I better be going then.
“To give you an incentive for the next weeks, let me show you a potion I have prepared especially for today.
“I know.
Sherlock answers curtly. John’s job at the clinic is not a good topic for either of the friends at the moment. John talks something about responsibility, wages and being an adult, when he could be much more useful at the flat with helping Sherlock solve cases! Or assist him at the often weekly sparring matches between the Holmes brothers.
John blinked in surprise. Why was there a secret door in Mary’s basement, and why had she never told him about it?
he asked.

“Pretty boy like you, would be a waste.
“I have talked with Mrs. Hudson, and we both agree that Mr. Brown is doing something called stress-eating. He is finally about to be promoted, and he is very nervous about it. Mr. Brown doesn’t want to admit that he doesn’t like the new biscuits Mrs. Bird baked last Sunday, and so he is eating your orange marmalade to compensate. He is very sorry for that and will buy you a special gift for Christmas to apologize.
He must have fallen asleep quickly, because it is around 1 o’clock when he is woken up by the sound of small stones being thrown at his window. Sherlock rolls himself off his bed with a grunt and rips the long curtains open. With the bit of sunlight falling in, he can make out an impossibly handsome John Watson, who is standing in front of his house and waving his hand. Sherlock scrambles to open his window.
“I will, if you let me celebrate it my own way: by not caring about it in the slightest. Maybe one day you will understand, after all, Christmas has never done anything good for you.
We will talk about this later.
Congratulations are in order, then.
He never used to sleep that much.
The crumpled figure on the ground right next to John had not moved in the time that John was unconscious. John checked his watch. Only about 70 minutes had passed since he went down the basement, so he couldn’t have been unconscious for more than a few minutes. Another good sign.
John’s mouth opens, and he gently presses Sherlock’s shoulder to do the same. Their tongues tease each other, until Sherlock involuntarily has to take a break to breathe.
Then the tarmac happened, the near fatal overdose and the mysterious video from the criminal mastermind. One of
“You’re brilliant, you know that, right?
Sherlock can hear his own muffled screams echoing through the damp place. He forces his last bit of strength back to his mind-palace, reliving all the good memories he has collected over the years at Hogwarts. It is getting more difficult to remember.
They decided that they wouldn’t let Mary win. Both Sherlock and John deserved more than that.
“Do you want to say something to me?“
John jumps up and hurries to the water, fearing that Greg’s muscles are cramping from the cold.
He was now sitting together with Bill, his oldest friend, on one of the uncomfortable wooden chairs next to the pulpit where the priest was waiting.
John gets up to refill their glasses.
Sherlock whispers, grabs John's hand, and they jump behind a knight statue. John tries to make them as small as possible, and in doing so, he pushes Sherlock’s lithe body flat against the wall. He hears Sherlock’s hurried heartbeat and smells the special Sherlock aroma: sulphur, old books, lemon and something else, something John has only ever smelled from the
He pours a few drops of in it on his open palm. Under the curious eyes of the first graders, a small, lilac flower grows out of the thick substance. A few gasps and someone even claps. Sherlock presents the small flower to one of the girls standing around, who accepts it with a whispered thank-you.
Of course John knows that Sherlock simply wasn’t feeling things like that, but that never stopped John. Now, at last, there was hope again. If Sherlock wanted him back, John would be back. If Sherlock wanted to move to Antarctica and study the northern lights, John would go with him. This may be unhealthy for other people, but it was how John felt.
This is the reason why he is waiting at the terminal, together with eight wives, three husbands, four proud looking parents, three giggling friends, one girlfriend and two boyfriends with a young child. Sherlock deduces that he is the only man waiting for a male soldier, and only the second person in a same-sex relationship here (the girlfriend is looking eagerly forward as well to reunite with her female soldier).
“How are you feeling?

John raises one eyebrow: “Really?

"I want you to be selfish. I want you to stand up for yourself, I want you to get healthy.You sacrificed yourself so many times. You deserve it."
He whispers shyly and brushes the crumbs away from his mouth.
Let it be over.
Sherlock’s hands are shaking, and he tugs them between their chests. His secret may be out, but he no longer has to hide.
“That is correct, Margaret.

“All of you are dismissed. I cannot stand this high incompetence in this room any longer. Leave!
His parents moved back to Sussex, weary with grief and John had moved into Sherlocks bedroom. He wanted them to wait, to give Sherlock time, but the detective didn’t want to hear anything about it. We waited long enough, he said and then kissed John breathlessly.

“Thank you.
Today, on a rainy day in October, John slips a silver ring on Sherlock’s finger.
“Sherlock is absolutely miserable and thinks you already asked someone else! Get your act together, Watson!
I’m sorry?
. It was John’s, sitting his small, undecorated, empty, soulless flat with only his whiskey as company. No fights, no skulls, no morgue, only a visit to the graveyard and a bad migraine the morning after. John felt his life to be over again. No one came to visit him, he had taken care of that. They had been more Sherlock’s friends than his anyway. John had the privilege to orbit 18 months around this brilliant, human being, and that was it. 18 months had to be enough for a lifetime.
The Santa makes a disapproving noise and tries to wipe away the blood, but it only distributes it all over Sherlock’s face.
said Gregory, shoulders slumping.
"You are going to eat more, I can’t catch a minute of sleep with your stomach grumbling like that.“
Sherlock is so far away in his mind that he does not concentrate enough, and promptly spills the hot, steaming water all over his hand.
Curse would be the worst. Someone else taking your will away and forcing you to do whatever they want…
“John…
when he passes her corridor.
John’s mouth drops open in surprise.
It’s Sherlock. Ice cold skin and no fishtail, but long legs. Here, in London. John has no clue how this happened, how the river brought Sherlock from their home beach to the shores of the Themes, but right now, there is no time to find out. John has to act quickly now.
It’s not the first bed, or the second, or the third, but finally it is the fourth at the trauma station. John glimpses a set of formerly black, now grey curls and yanks the curtain open with brutality.
“No, even if you wanted to, you could not manage it. My wolf form is way bigger than yours.
“ENOUGH!
One of her two employees is Molly Hooper, a 21-year-old medical student. She has long, brown hair and always wears jeans and sweatshirts. Molly has moved to London to start university and first stumbled into the bookshop on a rainy December afternoon. It was only her and Mrs. Hudson at that time. Molly was offered a cup of tea after 5 minutes and a job after one hour. Sometimes, things just fall into place.
“Of course.”
John has prepared the water and Sherlock has mixed the different shampoos (strawberry and peaches, their favourite). They had solved their latest serial killer case this afternoon, after a long chase through London’s back alleys. It was a week full of rain and grey clothes, and Sherlock could feel his shoulder hurt more than usual after a night spent at

She says and pulls up Sherlock’s arm. The blood around the letters is sticky and dry. The arm looks mangled, but the letters are still easy to read. Sherlock moves a bit.
This gets him a bigger reaction:
“Do you want to share the chocolate brownie?
I’m glad I get to work today. You meet the best people and see the most wonderful things on these shifts.
“I’m so sorry I didn’t arrive sooner.“
Now the boy actually WINKED at him. With one of his sweet eyes. Was he actually flirting with him? With Sherlock? Irene will flip out when he tells her about this.
, or he will become one of these old bureaucrats who only make orders, but have no clue about the life of an average people anymore..
“What drink do you want, Sherlock?
John contemplates and sips his hot chocolate.
“So, what is so special about this mirror?
John and Lestrade stared at Mary, the sound of Sherlock’s tears like daggers in Lestrade’s heart. He thought back to that night in the hospital, when John was crying, sitting in that unforgiving cold hospital chair, believing his best friend had just died. Had it all been a show?
The nurse sighs: “Fine, but I will be back in ten minutes to check.

John grins.

He switches out of his clothes and into his pyjama and tries to forget the image of Mary still in John’s room. Once in bed, the turning world slows down a bit and allows Sherlock to think.

In retrospect, this may not have been the smartest idea they’ve ever had. John would say,
As always, finding an empty spot was an absolute nightmare. It took him twenty minutes and then another ten minutes to find the right hospital room.
Sherlock says sincerely.
“How do you know I used to be an
John says, then practically falls over the chair, his lips landing on Sherlock’s.
Smith releases the bag from him, and Sherlock pushes precious oxygen into his mouth. Through his desperate gasps, he hears John shouting at Smith. Watching Sherlock being slowly asphyxiated must be a gruesome sight, with Sherlock’s open mouth pressed against the plastic and his whole body convulsing. Smith had chained him right to the kitchen chair opposite to John’s, so there is no space to hide.
John hugs him closer, feeling possessive: “Molly is still dancing with Greg, and they seem content. I still want your undivided attention for a while more.
oh, oh my god. It wasn’t meant to sound THAT way!
John opened his mouth and closed it three times, his wide eyes staring at the figure that was huddled on the ground, only wearing dirty, stained clothes and a half-shaved head.
The former soldier stumbled at the pitiful sight in front of him. He just barely caught himself. The terrible air and the smell urged him to flee and then throw up.
“As you can see, I have taken certain safety measures. I have studied your methods for month and prepared myself. I am confident that you won’t be able to gather anything worthwhile about this place or my person.“
“You just broke up with someone.
Mary sank back into the chair. She looked defeated: “Moriarty told me to keep an eye on you, in case Sherlock tried to do something stupid. Like faking his death, for example. I studied you, and after I while, I decided to get closer, in case you knew something.”
“I am Sherlock.
“Boyfriend, then? Which is totally fine, by the way.
The answer is fast:
A strong hand presses him gently back into the covers, and Sherlock obeys. The kind words do make sense, after all.
“You. For one night. Doctor Watson can stay downstairs.
Sherlock turned his ears back on. The handsome boy was talking to him.

I made a mistake, but that is in the past. I have changed, and John will notice that. He will remember how well we worked together. Then, John will come back to me.
John had proposed to Sherlock last November, in his flat in Baker Street. He had cooked lasagna with enough cheese to make the prince happy and then went down to one knee.

All say in unison.

Maybe John will meet them at school next week! They could play with Paddington together, or run through the garden. John can already imagine the fun adventures they are going to have, and he cannot wait for it.
“Fine, we will switch.
The ghost wrapped the bandages around his head and picked up his lower jaw. He walked over to the window, and with every step, it opened further, so he could at last slip through. He cast one last look to
Really? John was surprised. He didn’t want to make friends. He didn’t want people to mourn him after his inevitable death, and he didn’t trust anyone, not after that arrow landed in his shoulder.

books for his mistress. Sherlock considers if he should warn the man that the BDSM in this book is not correctly portrayed at all and that the mistress will throw him out for trying (and rightly so), but decides against it. He does not want to give Mrs. Hudson the headache of dealing with another disgruntled customer.
Sherlock is standing in the middle of a fresh spring rain, and he forgot his umbrella at home. At least that’s something where Mycroft is always right.
John growls, and shots another arrow just for good measures up in the dark. The large thing crashes through the branches and lands in front of Sherlock’s feet, its legs dangling up.
John Watson says and greets Paddington with a warm smile. Then he turns to his friend.
Molly claps her hands together: “I do know him! One of my friends used to drag me to his old workplace — a

He asks, and the giggle abruptly stops. Then, a series of quick steps follow.
“How did you do it?
“We will get that thing off you, don’t worry.
John clings his glass with Sherlock’s together, before bowing down and pressing his lovely lips on Sherlock’s. In his heart, as well as outside, the firework starts.
“Drop your gun and kick it over to me.
“Sherlock! Just nod if you can hear me!
“Who are you?
thing was easy, you have equipment all over this room.
There was another thing: John genuinely liked Sherlock. He liked his quick answers, his smart wit, his rapidly whispered deductions in his ear, the tales from Britannia and his vast knowledge about literally anything than the stars (and sex, apparently). He feared if Sherlock dared to run away, John would not be able punish him.
Sherlock says, his shoulders slumping. He had been right, Mary has outed him to everyone she met.
Sally asks him, but he winks her off. It is just a bit of alcohol. He had worse. Sherlock can feel John’s eyes on him as he navigates the difficult way to the toilets. The alcohol makes him braver than he is and Sherlock moves his hips in a seducing (?) way that shows off his arse. John can make out of that whatever he wants.
Sherlock says. Before he knows it, he is flipped on his stomach, laying now fully in the middle of the bed.
“You seem quiet.” John suddenly says through the headphones, and Sherlock is ripped out of his thoughts.

Maybe it was because of his parent’s marriage, but already at the beginning of the wedding planning, John could hardly pretend to care about any of it, while Sherlock and Mary did everything enthusiastically.
“Is it a gift for Christmas?
“I want to see you there as well. Whenever you have time.
“Sorry to hear that.
“We need to test it.

20 minutes later, John has finished his shopping trip and has even found his tea, plus Sherlock’s favourite chocolate (he will never admit it, but the detective has a sweet tooth). Hopefully it will cheer him up.
“No cheating!
John tells him, but Sherlock shakes his head.

They had become acquaintances, then colleagues, then friends. He was one of the three people that Sherlock had sacrificed two years of his life for.

“The reason I brought you here…
I will make sure you will remember me, John thinks now hatefully.
While speaking rapidly, Sherlock draws with his fingertips his mental route down John’s broad chest.
Sherlock fidgets with his own glass.

It was the morning of Christmas Day and at first it all went according to plan. Sherlock drugged all the Christmas party guests and stole Mycroft’s laptop, exactly as his brother expected. He and John had cooked up a plan months ago, while John lived at Baker Street to care for a slowly recovering Sherlock. John was to go along with Sherlock’s plan and get all the information
Someone announces and Sherlock is unbuckled. He immediately kicks in the direction of his captors, but they just jump aside and laugh at him. Sherlock’s face is burning with shame. What will John think of Sherlock when he catches sight of him, shamed and brutalized like this? It does not bear to think about.

They do not receive a response, but Sherlock knows that his husbands means serious business. The couple walk through the hallway to their wing, with John still hugging Sherlock.

says, smiling brightly at the group.
Gregory prepared himself to leave: “One day you will see how terrible lonely your life is, and then you will come to me. Don’t worry, I will be waiting.
He is slurring a bit. Sherlock finishes his third glass and wonders if John will throw him out now. He consumed way too much fire whiskey to walk straight.
“You should be proud of me, I was so patient in my planning! So many fellow colleagues had tried to get their hands on you in the past, but they always ended up dead or in prison. I don’t feel too strongly about either of these options, and so I hoped than one day I would gain the perfect opportunity. And I was right! Two weeks ago I looked into the newspaper and saw a lovely obituary for your greatest protector.“
Sherlock sighs, heart beating fast with anxiety: “Alright. We all kiss at midnight. Perfect.
he told himself, “Don’t believe such stupid nonsense!
They both sit there for a while until the nurse is back. He throws an annoyed glance at John before busying himself with their patient. John can’t be bothered.
How much time has passed since the evil Santa has cut the message into Sherlock’s skin? The detective can’t remember. The blood has long since dried on his skin, and the cuts have been disinfected by Santa. His kidnapper had ignored his painful gasps and just implied the disinfect or thoroughly.

Sherlock mumbled. John doesn’t need more information. His consulting detective will suffer through this time like a good soldier, and collapse every night into bed. The onslaught of sensory input at Christmas Time is always stressful for the genius intelligent brain.
Not much was left of Sherlock’s pale but striking and almost aristocratic face. Instead, he resembled a tortured prisoner of war. His face was gaunt, and whoever shaved his head had done a crude job, leaving cuts everywhere. His lip was split and there was dried blood. With sinking dread John realized that this must be a recent injury and that Mary must have punched him, probably while John was treating other people’s injuries at the E.R.

, then proceeded to eat most of the cake himself. Kissing his chocolate smeared mouth had been endearing.
The consulting detective is laying curled together in their bed. He has changed into his blue pyjamas. John carefully holds his tea glass while shedding his trousers and jumper as well. He dives next to Sherlock. The detective has his eyes closed, his body up to his mouth buried under the blanket. Sherlock immediately snuggles closer to John, while the doctor enjoys his tea. They both enjoy the quietness of their flat, only interrupted from car noises outside, and Mrs. Hudson softly talking to herself.
Sherlock wrote the headline NEW STRATEGY on a new page in his mind palace and started planning.
