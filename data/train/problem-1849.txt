Sherlock blinked, then shrugged a little. "I don't know, you just do," he said, nuzzling closer to him. He didn't relinquish his spring rolls though, lifting another one up and biting off half of it. He sighed, "Something just... different. Feels different somehow," he said, not knowing how to describe it.
Sherlock nodded a little, bringing John's hand to his face, nuzzling against it. "I love you," he said softly, closing his eyes a minute. "Think... might try and rest some... before..." he trailed off. He swallowed, pressing his forehead to John's. "I want you to stay... happy you're... staying.." he trailed off, curling up a little more.
Sherlock jumped a bit, turning his head around to shoot John a look, though his mouth still quirked up a little. He finished brushing his teeth quickly after that and climbed into the shower. "Still warm... that's a relief," he teased, poking John's side a small bit.
A girl. Christ. John hoped she had little blonde ringlets and eyes like Sherlock's. He giggled softly to himself, squeezing Sherlock's hand again. It felt so much more real now, more secure in knowing.
John stood with his hands braced on either side of the sink, the water pouring from the faucet. He felt sick, the sudden reality of what was happening crashing in around him. He was being deployed in a week, leaving behind Sherlock and now a sister he had accepted as dead. Now she might be the one needing to attend the funeral of a sibling she hadn't ever expected to see again.
"That was beautiful," John commented quietly when the song ended. He gestured to the box. "Mycroft, I'm guessing?"
Sherlock heard John's words and committed the sound of them in this instance to memory. "Always," he said quietly, not quite fully retreated to his mind palace. He roamed lightly in his wing for John, Katherine's in a room off to the side of John's, because he couldn't reach her without thoughts of John. He arranged a small cupboard, which would grow as John's and Katherine's had, when it was born.
“Well, he may have more mentioned that he didn’t have a flatmate. Apparently he had one ages ago,” the man in the lab smirked. It had been more than a century, but the other didn’t know that.  “but he hasn’t bothered finding another. But you never know, yeah?” Mike clearly was stretching with this but John would allow it, he wanted to stay in the area. Try and move on from everything…including recent events.
"Papa? Daddy?" John leaned up, looking towards the door to see Katherine standing there, wiping at her cheeks. "Can I sleep with you?"
John tried taking deep breaths, but that only made things worse. Sherlock's scent was still heavy in the room, and when he closed his eyes he could picture him in the shower perfectly. Groaning, he dropped down onto the bed, rolling onto his stomach to try to force down the erection that had hit him.
After about an hour, there was a knock at the door and Maria came in again with a bottle of pills in one hand. "Here you go, love," she whispered, patting Sherlock gently on the shoulder. "Take two of them within the next hour or so and you'll be alright." She smiled kindly at him before walking over to check on John, hooking him back up to a few more machines, including the painkillers, and then leaving the room.
Mycroft nodded, sending a message on his phone before he and Greg left. A little while later the noise of quiet cleaning came from the living room as people swept up the glass and replaced the windows.
"Word's going around the hospital what you did for him," the nurse spoke again, fiddling with Sherlock's saline drip. "I know times are changing, but that was unusually kind of you." She walked over, and John caught a whiff of her Omega scent. "I took him off of anything that's making him tired, and I disconnected the nutrients. He's still going to have morphine running through him for a couple more hours, but after that, he needs to start taking painkillers." She handed him a bottle of pills. "Only one every four hours if you can help it. When he wakes, you're free to leave." She squeezed his shoulder and left the room.
Katherine sniffed once, picking a bit of sleep out of the corner of her eye as she nodded. She slid off of his lap, walking towards Sherlock and leaning up on her toes to kiss his cheek before starting upstairs. Sherlock watched her ascend the steps, letting out a breath.
John smiled softly up at Sherlock, his arms instantly wrapping around his waist. "Nothing, I just..." he looked down at Katherine and then back up at Sherlock. "He's back again. And he's texting you which means he's probably planning something." He rested his forehead against Sherlock's. "I took some of that medication again, because I could feel a PTSD attack coming on, and... yeah." He shrugged, trailing his fingers along Sherlock's spine.
John returned to the bedroom after flushing the toilet and brushing his teeth. He retook his seat beside Sherlock, wrapping his arm loosely around his waist and placing his head on his shoulder once more. "Mind if I," he broke off to yawn, "if I fall asleep like this?" he asked quietly, nuzzling against Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock slept for several hours, waking up just after noon. He blinked a few times, seeing John pressed close to him again. He let out a breath, looking around the room to see a nurse scrawling on a clipboard. He wondered if Mycroft was going to stop by, but he supposed he wouldn't this time. He sighed, wanting to go home and go to bed for a month.
John looked up at Mycroft, not making any surprised noises or sarcastic comments. "What about you? Do you want a pup?" he asked quietly. "Just forget about everything else for a moment. Your job and Greg's job aside, do you want a pup?" He looked down at his own daughter, smiling softly, reaching out to stroke along her fingers. She stirred a little, opening her hand and closing it again around John's finger. "They're worth it," he whispered, keeping his finger in place.
Sherlock set his phone aside, missing John already by the time he came back in. He smiled. "You didn't have to leave and get more... we had the left overs," he said, sitting up a little. "It's fine... we'll have them for later," he said, reaching out for John, wanting him close again.
John tilted his head in question, pressing his hand to Sherlock's chest, his brow furrowing when he felt the absence of his tags.
Hamish. Don't ever call it ugly, it's a part of you," he murmured. He let out a breath, then nodded. "He did yeah, this morning," he glanced at the clock. "Still a bit early yet. Just after three. Did you already want to go to bed?" he asked quietly, quite liking sitting like this, all piled up with each other.
Sherlock swallowed, then stood up, looking at him. "You do need to eat something else, can't starve yourself. As a doctor I thought you'd know better," he said with a small smile. "I burnt the soup... can't cook for hell," he said with a small shrug.
"Everything alright?" John asked when he returned, noticing what he could only describe as a worried expression on the Omega's face, though it was much more complex than just worry.
He sighed lightly, walking into the kitchen with Katherine cradled in one arm and starting the kettle. "I'm glad you've got something to do, though. Just mind my work schedule. I can't take too many days off."
John's gaze flickered quickly over Sherlock's bare torso, able to appreciate his beauty even with how skinny he was.
Their ear pieces screeched and John ripped his out, yelling at his team to get down and find cover. They didn't know where the shot had come from, but some shelter was better than none. He grabbed Bill Murray, his nurse, and dragged him behind a rock, leaning back against it and pulling out his assault rifle, turning the safety off.
"John? Everything alright, dear? Sherlock said you were sick; are you feeling better?" Mrs Hudson asked, coming out of the next room.
"That doesn't mean that you can't be or aren't mad at me," John said, lying back and dropping his head on the pillow.
John reached out, cupping Sherlock's cheek, feeling his slightly heated skin and running his thumb over his cheekbone. "God, I missed you," he whispered, pulling Sherlock forward into a slightly awkward hug. It hurt, but he didn't care. He needed it, he needed his mate close. "I don't ever want to be separated from you again. Not ever. I don't care what it's for. I won't work. I don't want to leave you," he breathed, nearly crying against Sherlock's chest.
John laughed at that, cradling Katty's head against his chest. "Like I haven't seen all of the episodes already," he teased. Well, except for a few he had missed while he had been serving Queen and Country. He somehow hadn't been able to find them on telly yet. "Don't push her too hard. She's only three," he muttered, leaning his head up to nuzzle against Sherlock's jaw.
Ten minutes later he was pacing the flat, not thinking about what was sitting in the bathroom, waiting on the counter. He chewed on his thumbnail, massaged his shoulder a bit before he finally went in.
“Certainly not, I was coerced. More or less. I was there at the heed of my brother, as a favour of sorts. I work freelance, as a detective for various parties when the need arises. So where is it you will go now then Walters?” he asked. “You clearly don’t have permanent residence here in the city, evidenced by your dress, the way you are holding your shoulders, as well as the scent of the soap coming from your clothes. Laundered at a prominent hotel that has decent pricing. Tell me, if you were visiting from out of the city, why have you not returned after your ordeal? And were you perhaps looking for more permanent lodgings?”
The cold air from outside pushed Sherlock's scent into the room, and John sat bolt upright. "Jesus, Sherlock. Shut the window before you attract every Alpha in a ten-kilometre radius. Christ, you can tell you've been holding this one back."
John smiled as he walked down the street, slipping quickly into the pharmacy and buying some painkillers - strong ones - with a flash of his credentials. Once they were in a paper bag, he started home, quickly trotting up the stairs and unlocking the door.
"He'll be a bit out of it for a while; got him on some sedatives and painkillers – apparently the nurses said he's one of the anxiety types. I don't blame him, poor kid."
John ignored the slight temptation of food, crossing into the living room and sitting down in his chair across from Sherlock.
John ran a long look over Sherlock's form, taking in every detail. "To say it plainly? Hot as bloody hell." He smirked, standing from the bed and walking over to Sherlock, leaning up on his toes to nip at Sherlock's lower lip and then kiss him.
"Oh!" she said, going quickly into the kitchen and pulling out some baby carrots, setting them out on the plate also. "For the reindeer," she said.
John pulled his eyes open, staring up at Sherlock. He reached forward, running his fingers through his soft curls, fixing some that had fallen the wrong way. "You're okay, love," he whispered, leaning up to kiss his lips, wincing as he lowered himself back down. He looked out of the tinted window, recognising some of the buildings. They were almost there. "I'm not going to let anyone hurt you."
John reached out and touched the screen, wishing that he could actually touch Sherlock. He felt his Omega's pain, felt his loss, his heartache, because it was his own as well. "I don't know, love," he said quietly. "I'm not healed, yet. They've got me on all the medications that they can without causing me more harm, but not everything can be treated with that. They're mostly worried about my heart right now, but everything else is just as bad. Some infections... there was blood poisoning, but it's gone now. I'll be home before Kat's birthday, though. I promise. Just please, Sherlock, please. Let them treat you. It won't take long; it's not an uncommon occurrence. Please, love, I'm begging you. I don't want to see you like this."
Sherlock ran his hand down John's chest, feeling his scar, his new ones...seeing his tags and the other tattoo. He ran his hands over all of them. "Mm-missed you too," he panted, grinding up against him with a moan, shivering a bit. He hugged his legs around John's middle tightly, then clung onto him with his arms.
It was easier in that place, his survival instinct overwhelming it all, and then with John... well John had a way of making things quiet in his head. Perhaps, though, that was just because he'd just got out of that place and was transitioning. Maybe John being there wouldn't have helped. What if that was just a transitional period and eventually John would have tired of him?
Sherlock opened his eyes a crack, the room around him slowly coming into focus. He blinked, dragging his gaze over to see John there.
John reacted, grabbing at the man’s hand and lifting his knee up quickly and slammed it into the man’s chest. He grabbed the mugger’s right hand with his left, trying to force him to drop the blade.
Sherlock looked up at Angelo, then down at Katherine who simply nodded, "The chicken Parmesan for her I think Angelo," he said, that's what she normally got.
John smiled. "I just want to get home sooner. I'll be right back." He turned to go, then turned back and kissed Sherlock chastely. "Love you," he whispered, pulling away and walking quickly towards the refrigerated section of the store.
Sherlock swallowed. "There's nothing I want more than for your Papa to be happy, Katty. But... I can't promise that. I did a bad thing. I lied to your Papa, and I really hurt his feelings. I told you the truth because I knew you couldn't tell him and it would be our secret," he said quietly.
so tedious. Finding a suitable human, one that even smells appetizing. Some humans are immune to glamour so if I choose the wrong one then they can remember my face, which requires me traveling farther from Baker Street.”
John woke up when he felt Sherlock get out of bed, walking over to the bathroom door as was becoming the norm, to comfort Sherlock until he was done being sick. He froze just on the threshold after pushing open the door, staring at the red on Sherlock's hand. "Sherlock?" he asked worriedly, searching his face.
"Can I be the judge of that?" John asked, glancing over at Sherlock when the car started moving. "I don't want an 'I'm sure it's fine' to turn into an infection." He sighed, setting his head back against the seat. "And I told you that you were stubborn," he murmured, peeking his eye open to pin Sherlock with an amused but meaningful look before closing his eyelid again, exhaustion settling into his system.
John sighed, a smile tugging his lips as he made his way into the bedroom, pulling on a blue jumper and some jeans. "You're going to have to slow down, Sherlock. I know you're excited, but I can't keep up with you if you start running."
She was asleep now, holding onto the doll Mrs Hudson had given her as she rocked in her swing. John rubbed his eyes, glancing down at the papers that were still littered with news of... of
, even if it was cake. He ate his piece as well, offering a tiny bit to Hamish, who mashed it around in his mouth and then spit it out. "Yeah, I know that's not what you want," John said quietly, glad that Hamish hadn't started fussing for food yet. He was actually being quite good for how he normally was.
"Yeah...gonna be big helper and big good girl for Papa and Daddy and then...then Papa's gonna come home," she said with a nod, smiling. Sherlock sighed, it was so easy for her, she didn't understand where it was he was going.
"I know," Bill said, steadying him, "but that's what I'm going to say in the report when we get back."
After a few minutes of thought Sherlock finally came up with something. "Something to do with makeup?" he asked, not sure honestly, but it was more a shot in the dark than anything else. John had been looking at Sherlock's eyes when he mentioned it, so that was when he was thinking about it. "Something on my eyes?"
Sherlock looked back at Hamish, smiling softly as the infant grinned at him. He reached up around his neck and pulled off John's older pair of tags. The ones he normally wore, and handed them to John. "These are hers. I promised them to her, and they might make her feel safer. She's our little soldier now anyway."
John walked over behind Sherlock, loosely wrapping his arms around him to avoid his side, and looked over Sherlock’s shoulder at the city beyond the window.
. John lost his breath at the perfect site of Sherlock above him. His knot was swelling and his heart was racing, and it was wonderful. He reached up, taking over stroking Sherlock, making them quick and long, matching the sharp thrusts he was pounding into Sherlock. He felt Sherlock's body clench and quiver around him just before he slammed into him, his knot swelling to hold them together. He quickened his strokes on Sherlock's length, rolling his fingers over the tip to bring him over.
Sherlock ate a few bites of his food, taking up a bread stick and biting into it. "You can have my wine, John," he murmured, knowing that he shouldn't have any himself.
Sherlock shrugged a little. "Perhaps," he said quietly, eating another small bite of pasta. He looked back at his violin; he supposed that wasn't going anywhere. He looked up at John. "As long as it doesn't interfere or anything with you taking your test," he said. "And doing whatever else they'll have you do," he murmured.
Sherlock got out of the cab, picking up Hamish and carrying him inside. He undid the straps and peeled the infant out of his thick layers, holding him close to his chest, both arms wrapped around him. He was warm, but he wouldn't take off his coat, he'd have to put Hamish down to do that. He smiled weakly at Katherine after she bounded up the steps, and sat on the sofa, feeling a bit better when she climbed onto the sofa and curled next to him.
John felt Sherlock's rightful accusation like a stab wound. "I'm sorry," he whispered. "I won't be going out often, rarely, even. Just when they need me." He furrowed his brow, biting his lip as he held Sherlock closer, reaching up to comb through his hair. "I'll probably only be going out five or six times total, just..." just when it's dangerous. "Just when they need some help."
Mindy tsked her tongue lightly, shaking her head and wagging her finger at him. "Don't be lying to me, mister. I'm a mother of two very mischievous and troublesome children who were always trying to blame everything on the other. I am a human lie detector." Her eyes were kind, lit with remembered laughter. "So please, dear. You look like you're lost. I can help."
Katherine set the book down and dashed into the kitchen, climbing up onto her chair that had a booster. She settled down, reaching out for her plate and stabbing a chunk of pineapple, shoving it in her mouth. She hummed, a smile on her face. Pineapple was her favourite, especially the candied kind.
Sherlock swallowed a little, "I...Hamish is so small though, he'd barely be more than a year old by the time the other one came along, not even out of nappies yet!" he said, worried about what this meant. What if he did have another? He was torn on that, half wanting one. John could be there for it. "Something always happens though. I had to leave the first time, you left last time..." he said softly, looking down.
“I believe you… gave me your address,” the blond man in the doorway said, holding it up. Sherlock sat up properly in the chair, nodding.
Sherlock looked her over, trying to think. The last few days... he'd been more worried about John, thinking he had everything Katherine-wise managed and memorised. Had he missed something?
Sherlock licked his lips, glancing down at John for a second before adjusting his scarf. He let the gun clatter to the floor of the stage, ignoring the tug he felt at John needing help, and at John telling him not to. He had to, wasn't that obvious? He knew he had his phone, he just had to give Mycroft time. "John... go. Crawl if you have to," he said, taking out a tenner from his wallet. "Get a cab and... and go.. just go see your family, you still have an in-law to talk to," he said, hoping John understood to talk to Mycroft, though he implied Clara.
"No," Sherlock said, despite many things feeling not alright. But that was just unfamiliarity. He let out a breath, tilting his head up to look at the sky again. "It was dark the last two times I was outside and even partially conscious, not that I remember them that clearly, I can hardly recall going to the hospital," he explained. "I have not been outside in... a while," he said.
John clenched his jaw, not wanting to accept that time was running out. He closed his eyes, opening them only when the door in front of them opened and students poured out. John looked up at Sherlock, wrapping his arm around his hip and walking inside with him.
John sagged a little once they were alone, and he nuzzled against Kat's shoulder, trading scents with her and humming a soft tune close to her ear. "Let's go to bed. Papa's tired," he murmured, slowly starting to walk towards the bedroom. He set Kat down on the bed, much to her displeasure, and walked over to the chest of drawers. Quickly, he stripped out of Sherlock's coat and the hospital gown before he pulled on his warmest, softest pyjamas and crawled into bed beside Kat. "Come here, love. You always make me feel better," he whispered, holding his arms out for her.
"What about the others?" Sherlock asked, pulling away and looking at John intently, his hands on either side of his face. "The ones you saved, did you bother counting them? Writing their names down? You remember all the bad, but what about the good? The people who didn't come home in a box because of you, rather than the ones that would have whether you were there or not?"
God I want to see you, your bedding, and jumpers....they smell like you, but it's not the same. It's empty. Did you feel that way? With the scarf and doll? Do you still have those even? God...feels like ages ago. Here is a picture from today, Katherine and Hamish, she loves holding him, four years, seven months, and one week, and two months of age respectively.
Sherlock nodded a little, kissing John in return. "Of course," he murmured. "You go get some rest; might join you in a little while," he murmured, kissing John's forehead and letting him walk down the hall.
Sherlock looked at the tattoo, Hamish holding the bottle on his own with it leaned against his chest, he reached out and gently touched them. "I still wear the other ones you know," he murmured. "Mind you, Hamish likes to tug on them so I don't have them on right now." He knew he said he would give the tags to Katherine...but Sherlock didn't want to give them up, having thought he would wear John's new ones. He told himself though, he would find that man, and take the tags from his cold corpse and then wear them.
The heat was worse than any he'd had – turns out being completely alone during it was so much worse; he almost wished there were Alphas taunting him from outside.
"Sorry. I didn't want to wake him," John murmured, tightening his hold on Sherlock as he crossed over the threshold.
Sherlock nodded a little, feeling so small, but it was okay this time. He had John. He hummed a little, sighing lightly. "Mm... Nothing at all," he said quietly. He blinked his eyes open when he heard small footsteps, and a frazzle-haired Katherine walked in rubbing her eyes.
John didn't want to talk about leaving any more that night, or ever again, really. He didn't want to leave, period. But the army needed doctors, and they needed infantry members, and John figured he could give them both for two years.
"Alright," John whispered, wishing he was in a normal position and could just kick Sherlock awake and make him do it while he got some well-needed sleep. But he was the only one right now who didn't technically
John smiled, reaching up to cup Sherlock's cheek. "I can do that," he murmured, running his fingers lightly against some of the hair near his temple. "But only if you promise to wear that purple shirt the next time we go out for something," he teased, grabbing his muffin and mug of coffee and moving into the living room. He dropped onto the sofa, lying on his side so that he could still eat.
John nodded, gently kissing Sherlock's neck. "What are you here for, Maria?" he asked, looking curiously over at her.
All of that went through his head in seconds, his mind registering the second person in the room and all of his rage and worry focusing on him. Instead of pouncing, he waited, waited until a bottle was produced and a pill taken out, the cabbie gripping Sherlock chin in his hand.
"Sorry." John immediately stopped, unsure if distracting was a good or bad thing, and rested his hand on Sherlock's shoulder instead.
Sherlock wet his lips a little, looking at John steadily. "So... you're not... upset with me?" he asked quietly, not sure why he needed to hear it. He'd been feeling off for a while, and he supposed this was why. "You want this?" he asked.
He took Sherlock's hand, picking up their bags with his other, and led him through the small living room to a hallway at the far side of it. To the right was the bathroom, which had a huge bathtub, and straight ahead was the large bedroom with the four poster king-sized bed and bearskin rug on the floor. It's own small fireplace was situated on one wall. "I basically bought it for this room," he murmured, dropping the bags and leaning against Sherlock, his arm wrapped around his waist.
Sherlock smiled. "Her head, John," he said a little worriedly and reached up to support at Katherine's neck. She was doing pretty good holding it up herself, but he didn't want to risk it. She got tired quickly.
Katherine covered her mouth, whispering in response, "Said that...that don't tell what crushes are.." she said quietly, glancing over at Gran and Harry, who were smiling at them. She let out a breath. "Ah'like Avery...he pulls boys' hair...but s'nice to me." she said quietly. "Plays house at daycare," she said. "No other boys play that game." She informed them, as if imparting upon them the main reason for liking him.
"Can probably manage if you're on top," John murmured, his lips moving Sherlock's as he spoke because he didn't want to pull away. "Been wanting you on top for a while, anyway." He smiled, nibbling on Sherlock's lower lips and suckling on it, worrying it between his teeth without breaking skin.
Sherlock sighed laboriously as he sat forward and dragged the toast and butter closer, as if such an action warranted great effort. "I'm not particularly looking forward to the question bit," he muttered, thinking about everything that had happened in the last year, and then the three before that.
“I heard your tone change, you spoke with her then?” Sherlock murmured quietly so as not to disturb their daughter. He’d taken to bouncing Hamish again gently, settling the pup onto his lap. John nodded in response.
"Thanks," John murmured, taking the gun from Mycroft when he returned. He stared at the note in his hands, his eyes flickering over the words that were written on the paper when it was handed over to him. He sighed, looking up at Mycroft and then over at Lestrade. "I'm going to go be with him," he said as a way of excusing himself, and he crossed from the living room and into the bedroom, shutting the door behind himself.
Sherlock flushed furiously, letting out a breath. "I know," he murmured quietly. It was something he needed to work on, he knew that. It was difficult though.
John shuffled over, pulling Sherlock against him, unable to deny the Alpha instincts in him telling him to comfort the hurt Omega.
"Yeah, bedroom sounds good," John said, steadying Sherlock as he stood and following him back into their room, lying down on his back.
Katherine thought about that, then shook her head. "No. Juice! Oh, wait..." she said, remembering what Papa had been saying about asking and not telling. "Juice?" she asked.
Sherlock let out a breath. He didn't want this to happen, he hated heats. His face twisted a little, a worried frown tugging at his face as he wrapped his arms around himself. "Said you'd get them..." he said, not accusing, just restating. He swallowed, glancing out the window. He saw the cab driver looking at him in the rear view mirror and he tensed a little.
Sherlock hummed a little, pressing closer to John. "Mm love you too," he said quietly. He was quiet for a moment, thinking. "What will we call it? Um... her?" he asked, almost thinking it was too soon to think about names, but why not? John would probably love it.
"Sherlock, yes, of course I would." John leant back so the he could see Sherlock properly, reaching up to cup his face in his hands. "Love, what's wrong? You never act like this." He leant forward and kissed him sweetly. "What's this case you're doing? What about it has you so scared?" he asked, genuinely worried now.
Sherlock stood his ground. "You don't need it, John; it won't help," he said, following John a bit and grabbing his arm. "John, just because the signs of what my vice did to me are visible and yours aren't doesn't make yours not as bad," he said.
Sherlock sighed gently, then nodded. "I know...I'm not...I..I'll try not to." he murmured quietly. He looked at him, resting his forehead against John's. "I want to know...I already want to know if something's there...I hate waiting." he said quietly.
Sherlock hummed lightly. "Mm... she can sleep with us sometimes," he murmured. "When she actually sleeps," he mumbled quietly. He looked at John, then blinked a few times, feeling the kicking again. He sighed. "I think we woke her up," he mumbled, rubbing his stomach, hoping to quell her kicking.
John thanked her, squeezing Sherlock's hand and guiding him to the lift to take them up to the office levels.
"’m going to miss you," Sherlock said. "This... but, worth it... you'll come back," he said quietly. "Know you will..."
Sherlock watched her stand up and leave the room, closing the door. He swallowed, waiting a moment before shifting himself up onto John's lap and wrapping his arms around him. "I am so sorry John, and... for the record, the mood was brought down by my nonsense panic attack over your mother knowing I was pregnant," he said, kissing John's jaw and cheek gently, eventually gently taking up his lips as well. "I love you, and you're home now," he said quietly.
Sherlock swallowed. "I don't... I don't like hospitals John," he said. "You hear about some people doing it other places, at home even," he said softly, carefully with John's tone.
"A bomb went off across the street from my brother's flat.. you don't think I'd investigate, especially after he's been threatened?" Mycroft pulled out an envelope, already opened. "This was in a strong box, addressed to my brother," he said, reaching in and pulling out a watch that was cracked. "This... was our fathers. It was believed to have been lost in the accident, as it wasn't on his person when... when they were recovered," he said, faltering slightly.
Sherlock made it to the cemetery quickly enough, standing in the gates of it for a while. He slowly made it closer to his family plot, but ended up frozen, looking in the direction he knew they were in. He swallowed, moving to sit on a bench.
Sherlock hummed, loading up his pasta into the box and sticking a couple breadsticks in as well. "Well... guess there's no knowing about it then," he said with a small sigh. "Everything about it is just... unknown," he said. They got up, Sherlock nodding at Angelo with a small smile as they left, and started to walk home. It was only five minutes away, anyway. Sherlock felt his phone go off and pulled it out to look.
John pushed himself up into a sitting position. "No," he denied, shaking his head. "You're not broken. And even if you were, I can deal with broken. Broken things are fixable." He wrapped his arm around Sherlock's side, pulling Sherlock against him and tucking Sherlock’s head under his chin. "I don't care if you're different; I'm different, I'm broken. But I still love you, and I don't think that will ever change."
John didn't want Kat to hate the army. They weren't bad, they weren't the enemy. It wasn't their fault that John had a family, and he wasn't the only soldier that had a family. Stephen had left a mate and two pups behind. John wasn't going to do the same. "I know you will, baby," John whispered. "You're my good girl."
The spring rolls finished before he had sat down, so he grabbed them from the microwave and placed them in front of Sherlock. He finally took his seat, nursing the mug of tea between his palms.
He hummed, feeling something warm next to him. Someone. He lifted one hand up, his eyes still closed as his fingers found John's, weaving into them. He hummed a little, taking a deep breath and recognising the scent in the room. God, it felt like a warm blanket settling over him, and it made the ache in his side lessen.
Sherlock knelt down in the grass beside John, wrapping his arms around him, wanting to comfort him as much as he could.
John rolled his eyes at Harry's comment, though he was smiling as he walked inside, Sherlock behind him. His mother was waiting in the entryway, and she moved to wrap them both in hugs as soon as they had shrugged out of their coats.
Sherlock looked over at John, his forehead creased a little in confusion as he stood up, sitting on the edge of the bed as directed to. He let out a breath as John slid up behind him, straightening up a little.
He didn't do anything for two days, just thinking, and trying not to think, eating nothing but some stale cake leftover from the one Mrs Hudson had made for him. Sherlock had tried cutting back on cigarettes, but if anything he needed them more after that day.
He hummed a little. "John... we... made that," he said, his head leaning back and rolling to the side, face a little pale.
Sherlock cried out again as John swelled up, feeling his teeth sink into his neck. He gasped, coming finally and seeing white. He went limp, trembling as he let out a breath. He hummed a little. "Th-thank you... Thank... oh god, John... my John," he said, feeling an iron cord form that tugged tightly: their bond. It was back again, fixed, made better.
Sherlock hummed. "Yeah... suppose I should," he murmured quietly, not wanting to get up to get his phone.
John nodded a bit dejectedly, pushing himself up and holding out his hands to Sherlock. He turned from the room, his eyes sweeping over the pile of broken China and he flinched, leaving the room in a few hurried steps.
John stirred after a couple hours, tightening his hold on Sherlock as he blinked his eyes open. "Hey," he whispered, nuzzling against his shoulder. He looked down by their feet, smiling a little at Katherine before looking back up at Sherlock. "How's your side?"
Sherlock whined, why was John being so unreasonable? That wasn't fair. "John... s'hot, want be held," he said, frowning a bit as he shifted on the bed again. He rolled over, trying to climb out of the bed - he'd get in that bath himself and cool off, and then drag himself back and
Sherlock sighed in his sleep, nuzzling against John's chest a little, his long hair getting more frazzled. He hadn't cut it since before John got back and it was nearly as long as when John first got him.
Katherine lifted her head and looked over at her gran. She whimpered a little and buried her face again, her legs tightening around John's waist.
Sherlock nodded, murmuring a quiet 'yes please, thank you' to Angelo when he asked if they wanted boxes. "My mother told me I was a very quiet pup," Sherlock murmured.
Molly stepped up onto the roof, her heart pounding from racing up the steps. "John!" she called, running over and stopping a couple meters from him. "John... stop! You have to listen to me, don't do this," she said, pleading. "I haven't... please, you can't do this!" she begged.
John held onto Sherlock until the cab stopped, then he nudged him into a sitting position and paid the fair, hopping out of the cab and waiting for Sherlock on the pavement. He took his hand, squeezing it as he led the way inside.
John's brow furrowed in confusion and worry, and he wrapped his arms around Sherlock, holding him tightly. "You're okay, you're alright," he murmured soothingly, rubbing Sherlock's back and nuzzling against his temple. "Of course I'm here, I'd never leave you," he promised. "Never in a thousand years. Not for anything."
John stared, his mouth slightly open from shock. He glanced over at Molly, who seemed to shake herself and trotted from the room.
"Perhaps a cage would be better," Sherlock said softly. He sighed; it was clear that Mindy wasn't going to back down. He rubbed his shoulder lightly, which had started to ache a little. "I want John here, but it's not just about me, and…" he said, looking back up at her, "I'm not
"Stomach hurt?" John asked quietly, setting the mug of tea down and moving closer to Sherlock. "Hopefully the painkillers will help."
Sherlock nodded a small bit, his eyes closing a bit again, body completely relaxed, pliant against John's body.
John smiled a little wolfishly, his eyes sparking as he looked up at Sherlock. "Well now you've done it, haven't you?" he teased, walking forward to lean down, nipping at Sherlock's ear. "Given me all sorts of reasons to take control over you."
Sherlock was being patient, or so he thought. He thought he was; John said two months possibly, and he wouldn't allow himself to worry until then.
"Don't," John said, his voice low. "I don't want her to wake up if we're knotted together. Trust me, just this." He swallowed Sherlock down, swirling his tongue against spots that he knew made Sherlock shiver. He sucked hard and then barely had any pressure at all. He moved up at one point, focusing only on the head and glans, tracing the tip of his tongue along the slit.
Sherlock slept for a couple hours this time, having rolled over and curled next to John at some point after they were freed from the knotting. When he woke up it was dark outside their window. He shifted a little on the bed, nuzzling against John's side with a sigh. He didn't know if John was awake, so he didn't want to move just yet to wake him.
Sherlock hummed again, leaning down into the kiss more. He smiled against John's lips. "If we don't leave in the next minute and a half, I won't be dressed enough to do so," he said, almost not finding a problem with the idea.
"I'm not your babysitter. And I'm not going to tell him anything. I don't like people with a power complex, and your brother definitely has one." John reached out, combing his fingers through Sherlock's hair, just enough to get his attention. "You're fine. I'm home now."
John looked over at Harry and his mother, smiling slightly, not quite sure it reached his eyes. "It's fine; I'm not going back over there any time soon. A lot happened in that desert."
"Gregory told me what it is they did, what you said they did," Mycroft said, looking at John steadily. "Now comes the decision as to what is best for Sherlock. He is, or was, at any rate, difficult. Stubborn, and highly gifted. I don't know what a place like that would do to him, and there's no real telling. The question is, Dr Watson, with you still starting out, finishing your degree and such, perhaps you'd prefer taking on a more... simple Omega. Someone easier," he said, looking at his brother. "I can take charge of him; you, of course, would have your money returned to you if that's an issue."
"Ah missed you too Papa," she said, hugging him back. She grinned wickedly when he started whispering, shrugging a little bit. "Don't know..." She whispered softly, thinking intently. "What 'bout new scarf?" she asked, looking at her Papa. "Get new scarf and then yummy dinner?" she offered.
Sherlock nodded silently, watching John fall back asleep. He himself didn't sleep really, though he was tired. He stood up and walked over to Hamish's bassinet, lifting up one of his sleepers and inhaling the scent of it, letting the breath out slowly. God he missed him, and Katherine. Not having eaten much the day before Sherlock wandered down the hallway towards the kitchen and made something small to eat. He then proceeded to tidy the flat and arrange everything nicely, managing to get a fairly good amount done quickly.
He knew Mycroft would take it seriously. Sherlock glanced over at their daughter again then back down to his phone.
John let out a shaking breath, rubbing his thumb over Sherlock's stomach. He was going to miss it, all of it. The ups and downs, the swollen belly, the cravings for stupid foods that Sherlock hated. "You have to tell me. All of it. What it starts craving, what kind of music it likes. I wanna know when you get crabby, when you get stupidly sad, and I don't--I do not--want you to ever think about me not coming back. Because I am coming back, and we're both going to be stupidly loving parents who spoil their children."
Sherlock leaned forward into John's hand, letting out a breath when he saw the mark on his arm, no longer needing a bandage, but still clearly there. It had needed stitches, but it was obviously too late to do them when he was found. "Someday...just like before, you're going to tell me what happened," he said softly, looking up at John. "And we'll be able to tell our children that their Papa is very brave. We both have scars John...for what we did to keep our family safe." He smiled a little, standing up.
Sherlock raised his eyes to John’s, looking at him steadily. "And if he comes after you?" he asked softly, swallowing. The only reason he could see an Alpha wanting him was to take him for themselves. Though why he was so special he didn't know. The only thing he could think of was his mind and his connection to Mycroft. Which meant the only thing he could give the man was already taken. He reached up and touched his neck lightly.
Sherlock turned his head to look at John, resting his nose in John's hair. "I saw you there," he murmured. "Seemed to have some manners, that's something isn't it?" he asked with a small smile.
Sherlock set his jaw a little, saying nothing for a few minutes. He looked at John, who was thinner than he was before. "I don't care," he said, grabbing one of the muffins that Mrs Hudson had made and set it on the counter next to John.
Katherine sniffled against John's chest, wiping her tears off on his shirt. "'lo, Daddy," she said quietly.
"I know, baby," John murmured, pushing her hair back from her forehead to try and keep her cool. "I hate being sick, too," he said, taking out the thermometer when it beeped. "Thirty-nine. Yeah, you're a little warm." He rubbed her back, holding her hair when she went to throw up again. "I'm sorry," he said, handing her a glass of water so that she could rinse her mouth.
was the thought that crossed his mind. He couldn't help but raise the gun, though, a small bit of a tremble going through his arms despite himself.
Sherlock hummed a little, pressing into the kiss before pulling away and tracing over the Alpha's lips with his fingers. He let out a breath. "Other way around... you own me remember?" he said, before recalling that John had gone to the courts to get Sherlock ownership over himself. He didn't care; he was still John's.
"Um... Mycroft he… he was working up in the government at the time. Knowing him, he's only got higher by now so um..." Sherlock paused, letting out a breath. "I'll ask him to find them, your family," he said, swallowing. "And he will; least he can do for not finding me," he mumbled, looking down.
Sherlock stood up, stretching a small bit. He walked over and pulled out one of the hideous shirts he had to wear, along with the trousers to go with it. He sighed. "I don't like these either... almost as much as the tea I have to drink," he mumbled, pulling on the trousers with the elastic. He sighed, running his fingers through his hair a little, looking over his shoulder at John.
John leant heavily on Sherlock, far more affected by the tranquiliser than he had thought while sitting in the chair. He swore quietly, his fingers digging into Sherlock's coat as his knees refused to work, his side burning like a mad bastard. "Sherlock, I can't," he whispered, slipping in his hold. "I can't." The sound of a door opening behind them caught his attention, and he twisted to see a black haired Alpha walk towards him.
"Sherlock, you and I both know it's so much more than that." John leant against the counter, his hands in his pockets. "You haven't gotten to say goodbye yet, and I know you probably want to say sorry. It's... it's therapy. And you made me go through therapy, and it helped as much as it could." He sighed, looking down at the floor for a moment. "I think you need to go."
John sighed quietly, his body reacting to the pheromones the boy was producing, the ones that were begging for help, and his few years at medical school were also insisting that he do something.
John finished making the tea, setting Sherlock's mug down in front of him before joining him at the table with his own food. "Bit of a scary thought," he commented, starting to eat. "They grow up so damn fast. I want her to stay little forever."
John ran his hands along the Omega's overly warm sides, gazing up at him with nothing but love and lust. "Take what you want," he murmured, letting Sherlock have his way.
"Oh," Katherine said quietly, climbing up onto his lap and settling there with a small sigh. She looked at the book, tilting her head up to look at John. "You hate him?" she asked quietly. "Mm know lying's bad... but he's sad," she said.
being inside of Sherlock again, shuddering at the way his inner muscles fluttered around him before he started moving, drawing out all the way and thrusting back inside.
John laughed, leaning up to kiss Sherlock gently before he pushed to his feet and held out his hand for Sherlock. "We're going to need a bigger place, anyway. Hamish and Kat won't share a room once they're both preteen," he said with a smile. "Harry and I couldn't stand to hardly be near each other at that time."
John smiled lightly, moving over to take Sherlock's hand. "Come on, then. Let's get our coats on and we can go." He knew Sherlock didn't really want to, that he was genuinely afraid, but he had to bring him. Sherlock needed to face this. It had been five years, after all. "You've got a lot to tell them," he said softly, helping Sherlock into his coat before tugging on his own.
"I heard about Dad," John said, looking between his mum and Harry. His mum nodded slowly, gesturing him and Sherlock toward the loveseat and retaking her seat in the chair.
"These ones," Sherlock said, slipping them off as he didn't have socks. He sighed, taking up John's hand and leading him over towards the socks before he let go, glancing back at the man. "I'll just get some essential things," he said with a nod. "I can get it if you like," he said with a small smile.
Sherlock was tracing equations on John's chest with his fingers as he started to fall asleep, and he looked up at him. "And I, you, John," he said quietly, watching as John's face slackened. He let out a breath, not feeling the least bit tired. He held still, watching John, his every feature.
Sherlock felt his face warm even more when the cake came, looking at the candle in his. He put on a smile though, seeing the filling in the centre that Katherine had suggested. He blew out his candle and pressed a kiss to Katherine's head, taking up a fork and eating a bite. He would make himself eat the cake, Katherine's cake that she'd picked for him, even if he didn't have an appetite.
Sherlock nodded. "Just checking up on something," Sherlock said with a smile. He looked up at John, wondering how to tell him.
"I'll stop if you want me to. It's just... I don't know. I feel so helpless, like there's nothing I can do for you." John sighed, looking up at Sherlock and meeting his sharp gaze. "It just makes me feel like I'm doing something. And I enjoy it, so there's that." He shrugged, nuzzling against Sherlock's shoulder.
Once in the kitchen, John pulled out two cans of tomato soup, heating them in a pan on the stove. He made toast with it, and crumbled up his crackers inside the soup once it was in his bowl.
Sherlock licked his lips a little, taking a small step back, taking in the look of John. He smiled slyly. "Maybe," he said, looking at John, still in his fatigues. Christ it was hot, with his posture, and the way he looked. This morning it was different, now...
John waited for everyone else to finish eating before he stood, walking towards the bedroom. He kissed Sherlock's head as he passed, then closed the door gently behind himself. Quickly, he called his sister, getting frustrated and worried when she didn't answer, and then calling again. This time she picked up, and he had a hard time understanding what she was saying, because she was talking so quickly and crying on top of it. "Harry, please," John begged. "Take a deep breath and walk me through it." By the time she had finished explaining everything, he was in a small state of shock. He hung up, padding into the bathroom and turning on the shower, and sitting on the toilet as he worked to catch his breath.
Sherlock let out a breath when they got into the lift. "Really wish this was going down," he murmured as the elevator lurched up. He drummed his fingers along his forearm, trying to quell some of the anxiety he was feeling.
"He's my mate, please, he's my –" his voice broke as he stumbled through the circle, falling to his knees at the sight of his best friend and mate lying dead on the ground. Blindly, he reached forward with a shaking hand and searched for a non-existent pulse on his wrist. "No, no, please," he begged the orderlies when they came to take him away. "Please..."
So he borrowed a horse from someone who owed him a favor and made the trip. It was dark by the time he got to the house. There was someone waiting for him.
"Mm... didn't wake you directly... s'not my fault," Sherlock said with a smirk, leaning back against John's chest. He turned the tap back on to fill the tub with warmer water, shutting it off when the tub was full again.
John tossed aside Sherlock's trousers and pants, moving back up and re-pinning his arms with his own. He smirked a little, manoeuvring Sherlock's arms until he could tie them underneath him without putting too much strain on his shoulder. "I said don't move," he murmured, his voice impossibly low before he started kissing his way down Sherlock's body.
Katherine slid across the wooden floor, climbing up onto Sherlock's lap, and then wrapped her arms around John's. "Love you Papa... Daddy," she said, humming before she pulled away, as bouncy as ever. "What reading? When does Santa come?" she asked.
John gripped Sherlock tighter as nurses ran toward them, pressing their foreheads together and brushing his nose past Sherlock's. "It's alright, it's okay," he murmured, his tears dripping down to join Sherlock's before the nurses pulled him away.
"It had better," John grumbled, pulling Sherlock closer to himself and nuzzling against his hair. "It's kind of hard to raise our daughter together if we have to keep worrying about him." He pressed a lingering kiss to Sherlock's forehead. "I want the rest of my life spent with you, and I will gladly kill whoever it takes to get to that."
John closed his eyes, relieved that Sherlock felt that way. He wouldn't tell him now, even if he had thought to. "I know. Everything will be fine," he murmured. He felt his knot slowly recede, whimpering a little as he slipped from Sherlock. "Let's shower, and then I'll call Mum."
Dinner had gone well. Harry and Clara had called from where they were in France, wishing them a Happy Christmas.
John sighed, following Sherlock back into the morgue, listening to the two Omegas conversing. He was a bit surprised when Sherlock took the lead from the room but followed along none the less.
Sherlock stopped mid-step, blinking a few times and looking at John. "I didn't know... you didn't say anything," he said. That made John… what was it… twenty-three now? Twenty-four? He couldn't remember. "When was it? Why didn't you tell me? And for the record you missed mine as well so... we'll both just have to make up for it," he said.
Sherlock sighed, opening his eyes as he looked at John. "It's fine; I slept last night, and I'm not injured," he said, though admittedly he hadn't slept all that much then, either – probably only a few hours.
"Oh, don't act like eating is such a chore," John teased, nudging Sherlock before stepping around him and into the kitchen to pull out their sandwiches. "It's good for you." He set the sandwiches on the table, pouring them both glasses of milk before taking his seat.
A small cry escaped Sherlock, more of pleasure than anything else, and he nodded weakly. His knees were shaking, along with his whole body, really. He moaned, pressing harshly back against John, feeling himself already close to coming, but he couldn't yet... not yet, he
Before John could get an answer, his phone rang out from behind him, making him jump and then swallow down his rapid pulse. Rolling over, John answered the mobile curtly, wondering who the hell was calling after supper.
Sherlock blinked a couple times, looking around Katherine's room a little before curling up, leaning back into John. "I...I wanted to get Hamish's crib, but there wasn't room to set it in the living room so I cleaned it, then I got the crib down and I...well I couldn't leave Katty's room a mess either, thought I would surprise her.” He yawned, hugging Katherine's bear gently, missing her. He'd cleaned the whole flat save for the bathroom, but he could get that next. "We just have to put it together. Why did you grab a knife?"
Katherine blinked, thinking a moment, then took only three biscuits off the plate, putting them back into the mostly empty tin. "There," she said with a nod, snapping the lid back on.
"I don't..." John shook his head, scrubbing at his face. Katherine was looking at him curiously, and he tried his best to pull himself under control. "I started working again. Uhm..." he furrowed his brow, trying to think. "I don't know, I prescribed myself some sleeping medication, which I'm thinking about switching out. It's not doing hell to help, but I could be immune to it." He had taken it often enough before. He looked up at Sherlock, lifting his shoulders helplessly. "That's it, as far as I can think."
John chuckled, sipping more of his tea and then walking back into the living room, carrying Sherlock's tea in his free hand. "I wouldn't mind something," he said, taking a seat in his chair, "but I'm overprotective like that." He winked at Sherlock, setting the Omega's mug down and holding his in both hands. "Which is a habit we are both going to have to break. She's going to have to make mistakes and learn from them."
"I'm fine. I don’t need a therapist again," John argued firmly, because he wasn't going to go see a therapist again, he just wasn't. Not for anything. He looked down at Kat, finding her already looking up at him, and smiled softly. "I'll go in with her, if they let me. Would you be okay with that?" he asked Kat, stroking gently through her curls.
John couldn't help but feel a mix of pride and frustration at his daughter. She was almost scarily like him, and yet frighteningly like Sherlock as well. It made him nervous to think about how Hamish was going to grow up to act. "Yeah, we are," John said, nodding and taking Katherine's hand so that they could walk over to him. "Katty says she wants to take care of you, so we're going to go eat and get out of this cold.”
Sherlock nodded a little, letting out a slow breath and pushing back gently on John's hand. His arms shook a bit more, and he shifted his feet a little. He didn't want to ruin this though, because this... was perfect. Save for the extra pressure on his arms.
Sherlock nodded a bit. "We can, yes," he said, setting down his cup. He let out a breath, looking at the two women across from them. "It was... nice to meet you," he said quietly, shifting a small bit and putting on a small smile.
Katherine eyed her papa carefully. "If ther-a-pist is nice person...why don't want to see one?" She asked softly. Sherlock smirked at the counter argument, almost proud at it. Hell, he was proud of it as it was a good argument.
Sherlock's hand stopped reaching and he went limp again, well, most of him did. He cried into John's neck, muffling his noises as he came, feeling John's knot swell within him. He was breathing erratically, laying still on the bed as he tried to steady himself, his eyes fluttering shut. "I...John, you...you're...perfect....mine," he breathed.
"He'd probably been watching us for a while," John said bitterly, ashamed that he hadn't been able to notice because he had been disabled. "I'm going to kill all of them, I swear. Every single one," he snarled.
Sherlock smirked a small bit, sighing slightly. "Alright so..." he looked up at John, "did… did we want to try shopping again? Perhaps with the gun this time? Might make me feel a bit better," he said quietly.
The nightmares hit around nine thirty. They started with the usual – re-enactments and replays of the day Sherlock had "died" – but it didn't take long for them to develop into more. Desert scenery, Sherlock being held captive – tortured – by a faceless Alpha. And then it would shift, and John was doing the torturing, was slowly slicing Sherlock open, and then it shifted again and he was tied down and bare, with the faceless Alpha standing over him and scraping his nails down his torso. Sherlock was leaning against the wall and John was screaming for help, but Sherlock only had eyes for the faceless Alpha.
It wouldn’t be until John was fifteen that he would think himself as wanting to be a doctor again. In the eight years in between he bounced between Prime Minister, a news reporter, policeman, James Bond, and then a lawyer. By the time he settled on doctor again, he knew it was the right choice. He wanted to help people, save lives. Of course by the time he’d figured it out for a second time it wasn’t just something he could just
"Couple more," Maria said, cutting the last two and pulling them out. She felt Sherlock relax beneath her hand, and before he could turn and look to see what she was doing, she injected him with a strong local anaesthetic to numb up the area. "You won't feel it anymore," she promised, thankful that John had a strong enough grip to keep Sherlock on the bed.
"I'm really not fond of it," John chuckled, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist and holding his body close, loving how perfectly they seemed to fit together. "I wouldn't mind another girl, but I really would like a boy," he said, kissing Sherlock's temple and rocking them gently.
Sherlock sighed softly, thinking to himself. "Do you want me to call your mother?" he asked with a sly smile. "Have her come and take care of you? I'm sure she'd love it," he said.
John buried his face in his sister's shoulder, wanting to scream again, but he knew Harry wouldn't give him his hand back, and he wouldn't do it in the open air. "I can't... I can't focus on them, though," he whimpered. "What if I come back and Kat changed her favorite color again, and suddenly being tucked in is 'for babies'? What if something goes wrong with the pregnancy and I'm not here, or I come back and my baby cries when I hold it because it doesn't know my voice? What if I d--" He choked on his words, a sob ripping out of him. What if I die?
He tucked her blankets in around her, pressing another soft kiss to her forehead, and then walked from the room, turning on her nightlight before he shut off the main light and descended the stairs.
Sherlock whined, trembling. He wrapped both his arms around John's neck, trying to hold himself up. He was panting heavily. "T-take... take time... s'fine." he panted, letting out a slow breath, his eyes closing partially. "I...Hmmm....mm." he hummed, not able to string words together coherently.
"Do you want it?" John asked, his voice deep and husky with lust and need. He combed through Sherlock's hair, nearly drowning in his eyes.
John chuckled, nipping at Sherlock's bottom lip and suckling it between his own lips. He finally released it, smirking down at Sherlock. "Impatient, are we?" he teased, reaching over for the lube he had set aside, coating his length before tossing the tube away.
"Stop," John instructed, switching over to doctor mode. "Don't move." He lifted Sherlock's shirt, skimming his fingers around the small incision. He sighed, reaching over for the first aid kit and pulling it onto the bed. "It's starting to get infected," he said, pulling out some iodine and dabbing a soaked cotton ball against the cut.
Sherlock wondered what it was John had to read. No doubt he was already familiar with anatomy, his observations of surgeries evidence of that. He took a deep breath, taking in John's scent, which was... interestingly perfect, and smiled a little, shutting his eyes.
"Thank you..." Sherlock breathed, his eyes shut. "I don't... know where that came from I… sorry," he murmured quietly. "Made an arse of myself in front of your family," he muttered.
John's hands were bound to the headboard with the rope that he had partially managed to cut through. Of course, Lucian hadn't been able to manage that on this own -- two of his thugs had been called in to help. But now he was face down on the mattress, alone with Lucian once again.
Jim sighed lightly. "Sherlock Holmes commits suicide after knowledge is leaked that he's a fraud." He shrugged. "I read it in the papers, so it must be true." He gestured Sherlock forward, toward the edge of the roof.
"He was American, but he was in control of a large group of Afghani -- that's what we call them over there," John explained, shrugging. "He was taller than me but not as tall as you; I'm guessing about 5'11" or so. His voice was rich, but not as low as yours, and his eyes were a deep warm brown in colour, but I could see the coldness in them. He had auburn hair, too. Little more red than true auburn, though, and he had like... a pretty-boy hair style, but he wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty."
Sherlock shook his head. "No it hasn't, first one was a bit after noon, it's only just barely seven in the morning now but...twenty-four hours is the max cut-off, it's effectiveness drops even before that,” he muttered, still digging through the cabinet before slamming it shut. Where had he put them, where?! He thought for a moment, sitting on the toilet lid as he tried to remember.
Sherlock hummed, "You've no idea how much I missed you....then again, I suppose you're the only one who really knows." He looked up towards the door, seeing the edge of dark curls and a single blue eye, a sliver of his now four, nearly five year old daughter. He smiled, then gestured for her to come in and Katherine shoved the door open, running inside and skidding to a halt by the bed, pausing as she looked at John. She swallowed, looking at the tubes and wires, and the healed cuts and bruising, almost not recognizing John under all of it.
A nurse came in a short while later, looking expectantly at them. "Can he get some water?" John asked, motioning to Sherlock. The nurse nodded with a smile and disappeared around the corner, coming back a few seconds later with a bottle of water with a straw in it.
"Sometimes... I think if the laws hadn't changed, I might like you to take my title back," he murmured, loving being John's, but marrying him would suffice. "It's better though... I feel better, for Katherine," he murmured.
John wanted to throw something or hit something or both. He wanted to feel pain and inflict it, but damned if he'd ever actually been able to do that when he had wanted to. He pulled Sherlock forward, wrapping him up tightly in his arms and rocking him slowly. "Shh, love, it's alright," he murmured, holding him gently, despite still seeing red. "We can fix that, too," he promised quietly, combing through Sherlock's hair.
John smacked Sherlock's shoulder but didn't break from the kiss. He deepened it instead, tasting every corner of Sherlock's wonderful mouth and letting himself be tasted in return.
"Heyheyhey," John said, a little bit of panic rising out of him at the sight of Sherlock in pain. "You didn't do anything wrong, I promise," he murmured, wrapping his arm around Sherlock's shoulders and pulling him to his feet again, ignoring the spot of blood on the duvet and slowly guiding him down the hall to the door. He didn't bother with jackets and barely got them both into shoes. "I would have told you," he promised, half carrying Sherlock down the stairs.
Sherlock let out a breath, breaking down and nuzzling closer to John. He breathed in his calming scent, still shivering a little. "Still one... for now," he said quietly, looking down again. "John, I want... what if something else happens? What if..." he choked on the thought. "What if I can’t have them?"
John tested the ropes, looking down at Sherlock lustfully. "You have thirty seconds to finish, then," he said, starting his mental countdown as he bent down and started lapping at Sherlock's stretched entrance, wriggling his tongue inside.
"Well, we've all thought you dead for the last few months," Molly whispered, so quietly John almost didn't hear her.
Sherlock smiled at John, then nodded. "Weekend sounds good to me." He thought about Easter, and how it was months away yet. Would Dr. Chase still be making house calls at that point? "Definitely something I want to do. I've missed you in more ways than one."
"And seeing as you are so tired, and no doubt wound up from your long day, then I propose you do the, ah... touching thing... again," Sherlock said stiffly, rubbing his neck a little. "Obviously because, erm, you like it...that is," he said.
John ducked his head down momentarily. He may have been an Alpha, but his Omega mother was still dominant to him, and he knew it and most definitely respected her. "Sorry, mum. I was going to, and then..." He glanced over at Sherlock, knowing that the memory was just as raw for Sherlock as it was for himself. "Then they called and said I was being shipped out the next day, and then I was out of time."
Katherine blinked a couple times, not expecting to win the argument; she never won. Well... almost never. She sniffed, getting distracted and moving over to her small table to colour.
John laughed, leaning down to capture Sherlock's lips, his hands steadying his shoulders. "That's fine," he murmured, "you're light enough." He put his hands under Sherlock's thighs and lifted him up, keeping their lips lightly connected. He carried Sherlock into the bathroom, turning on the water lukewarm to fill the tub.
John thought to himself for a moment, closing his eyes as he worked to find a solution. "Well, I could take suppressants while you're going through it," he suggested, petting Sherlock's hair gently. "I don't want you to have to go through that alone. No one should have to."
John felt Sherlock stir, and it pulled him from his light doze. "Hey," he whispered, pushing some of Sherlock's hair back from his forehead. "How are you?"
“I would have thought you wouldn’t show, given the time that’s passed. I trust you made it to your home safely after your rest?” he asked. “Would you care for some tea? Mrs. Williams makes some round this time, I can be sure that she will likely prepare two cups now as I have a guest,” he said as he gestured to the seat across from him.
"Oh, look who's being considerate of others now," John teased, nudging Sherlock with his elbow. He took the outfit out, setting it on Sherlock's lap. "I'm going to go brush my teeth," he declared, pulling out his toothbrush and walking into the bathroom.
Sherlock let out a breath as soon as John was gone, letting how tired he felt show. He swallowed, then pulled out his phone, tapping away at it for a bit before tossing it onto the sofa, agitated. He sighed, willing himself not to be sick, though he knew he wouldn't be. It just felt like it, but he could always tell the difference.
About twenty minutes after John fell asleep, a nurse brought Katherine's cot over to the side of his bed, and let Sherlock put her in, helping him to the bathroom. Walking felt a bit different now, but he was soon back in bed, looking at Katherine. He dozed off and on, keeping an eye on both his mate and his daughter. He let out a breath; the best parts of his life now.
John smiled, kissing the top of Katherine's head when she was close. He’d noticed the sniffle as well - they'd have to give her medicine when she got home. He leant over against Sherlock, looking down at the packages on their laps and then up at his mother.
John stood in the middle of the room, his eyes falling on the boy in the corner, whose knees were pulled up to his chest, his head hung in defeat. Swallowing thickly, John walked forward, crouching down beside him.
"Yes you are baby girl," Sherlock said, combing through her hair. "And you have to be a big girl because..." he looked up at John, so much for waiting for their birthday. "Because you're going to be a big sister...and you have to help take care of your baby brother or sister."
The package was from Mycroft, as it turned out, and the first thing Sherlock saw in the somewhat large but not too heavy box was an envelope. He picked it up, finding a note that read
Sherlock blinked a few times as he was gently forced down onto the mattress. "John I -" he was cut off as John left the room. He let out a breath, looking up at the ceiling, not hearing anything from the living room. He'd meant to stay awake, but within minutes he was unconscious.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes playfully at John. "Bell sounds perfect; if I recall, my nanny did something quite similar with me. Put a key finder on me, I believe," he said, then shrugged. "We'll be perfectly fine. If anything urgent comes up, Mrs Hudson can watch her but... it would have to be pretty large. Not much would make me leave her without one of us around," he said.
Katherine stuck out her tongue a little, grinning at John with a mouthful of bacon. "I want go to school!" she said, feet swinging a little.
John laughed, though it hurt, and peppered Sherlock's chest with kisses. "Yeah, that sounds about right," he agreed, closing his own eyes as he slowly came in control of his breathing.
John jumped at Sherlock's voice, quickly folding the list and stuffing it in his pocket. He looked at the letters, the pieces of fabric, then back up at Sherlock. "Of course I kept them," he whispered, picking them up and standing, ignoring the jingle of his tags that he was now accustomed to as he walked over to his nightstand, setting the letters on top of it. "I re-read them every day. Most days, they were the only things that kept me sane, because I knew I had a reason to keep living."
Sherlock caught the clothes, looking at them before looking up at John again when he explained. He nodded, pulling on the clothes. He sighed a little, reaching into his pocket of his trousers and handed the weathered and creased photo of him and Katherine.
Sherlock whimpered as he felt John push up into him, no preparation this time. He moaned though as John paused and he slowly started to get used to the pressure. He was just about to wriggle a small bit when John thrust forward again, and then again, drawing a loud cry from Sherlock, though each cry ended in a moan. He leant back into John, his hot back pressed to John's chest. "I... almost, I please.... god pleasepleaseplease," he begged, writhing on the bed and tightening some around John.
technically, John wouldn't be walking too much, to the cab, then to a bench, but it was the stairs that were problematic.
Sherlock looked at John, then slid out of the bed, walking over and grabbing John's shirt and jeans. "Here. Be mindful of your side, though; they wrapped it," he said.
John quickly tossed a twenty at the cabbie and jumped out after Sherlock, catching him above the elbow and pulling him back against him.
John shook his head, reaching under the pillow – which had shifted when Sherlock had moved, and he knew the sound of his gun anywhere – and pulling out his gun, stuffing it into Sherlock's hands. "You're taking it. And I'm not hungry anyway, so there's no point in getting me anything."
Sherlock thought about it, then nodded. "No, you're right. It's better that you're there," he murmured softly. He traced the small scar on John's neck, the one from the knife wound he'd gotten. He swallowed thickly, sighing a little as he rested his head on John's shoulder. He felt a sort of relief he supposed – John knew, and he wasn't angry about it. He smiled, sitting up and pressing a kiss to John's lips, deepening it tentatively.
John shrugged. Like he cared if it was special, he just wanted to spend more time with Sherlock. He turned off the shower and stepped out, picking up the towel Sherlock had used and drying off. Walking back into the room, he caught Sherlock look down at his stomach, easily reading the expression on his face. He walked up, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist and nuzzling against his shoulder, as was becoming a common reaction for him. "Beautiful," he murmured, kissing Sherlock's halfway damp skin at his collarbone. "You're going to look beautiful, like you always do.”
John smiled at Kat, tucking his phone into his pocket as he walked past her, brushing his hand through her hair. "We're going to see your Gran and Auntie today," he murmured, kissing the top of her head and walking into the kitchen. He stepped up behind Sherlock, wrapping his arms around his waist and nuzzling against his shoulder. "You're alright," he whispered, leaning up to kiss the back of his neck.
Sherlock sank slowly down onto John with a moan; the stretching, burning sensation was amazing. Just the slight pain, but not too much. He nodded, rocking forward a small bit, lifting himself up a fraction then settling back down, getting used to it for a moment. "W-waited too long... Christ..." he breathed.
"No!" Katherine said stubbornly, turning around so she was closer to the wall corner where her bed was tucked. "No! No! Grape's icky too!" she said stubbornly.
Sherlock smiled, then stood to get a small highchair. He set it at the edge of the table then placed Hamish's car seat a top it. The grooves at the bottom of it meant for shopping carts and the base the seat came with settled onto the seat with ease. "For when the food comes," he said, sitting back down. Katherine scooted closer to his side, and cuddled into it. Sherlock shrugged off his coat, too warm for it, especially with an affectionate toddler at his side. He looked up at John, his lips a little pinker than normal.
he thought, struggling to get out of the chair for a moment before ambling down the hallway. He came back a few minutes later and sank back into the chair, fixing the pillows again. "I just want this bit over," he murmured, resting his head tiredly on his palm, leaning on the armrest.
"Can I come with you?" Sherlock asked, sitting up a little. "And I suppose I forgot to mention – Mycroft has already paid your friend back," he said quietly. He smiled a little. "Don't have to worry about it; after all he owed me, and you shouldn't have to owe your friend."
Harry was in the kitchen, and she flicked on the kettle, turning around to lean on the counter, looking at John. "You look good for having been over there. Brown as a nut compared to normal," she said.
Sherlock swallowed, finishing his sandwich. He looked down the hall, wandering down it a little later. "John?" he asked, lingering in the doorway. "Are you angry with me?" he asked softly, running his fingers along the wood grain of the doorframe.
"I know... I know," Sherlock murmured, relishing the feeling of John rubbing his back. "Time is just a concept, really, and it's what you do with it," he said. "You are not going to sit here, sulk, and feel sorry for yourself, and neither am I. No point to it, really, and neither of us really want to leave it at that for two years," he murmured.
"I'm assuming you got all of them?" John asked, directing his question at Lestrade, still unsure of where he stood with Mycroft.
Mycroft reached out and took John’s hand, shaking it once. "I'll be in touch," he said, before leaving swiftly.
John whimpered, his eyes closed tightly, his left hand squeezing Sherlock's. "It won't stop," he whispered, leaning back into Sherlock's hold. "None of it; it won't go away." He drew in a shuddering breath, holding it for a long moment. "I can still feel the heat, taste the grit that blows around in the air. I can still see
"I don't really much care," John said gently, steering Sherlock into the bedroom and pushing him down onto the mattress. "I can't actually make you sleep, but you're staying right there, so you may as well," he said, walking over to the dresser to pull on some track pants and a jumper. He smiled softly, crossing back over to Sherlock and kissing him gently on the lips. "Go to sleep, love. I can manage just fine by myself." And with that, he left the room.
John swallowed, lowering his eyes for a moment before he locked eyes with Sherlock to let him know that he was being serious. "I want you to know, so that if I... if I disassociate or have a nightmare, then you'll know where I am and you can help me get out of it." He let out a small breath. "But if you're not... if you don't think you're ready to hear it, then I can understand that, too."
“I need to leave.” The statement spilled out of his lips before the thought even occurred to him. He looked up, seeing a slight slip in the controlled expression of the other that almost looked like disappointment.
"No, she won't," John agreed, leaning down to kiss the top of Sherlock's head. "She's probably going to have everyone wrapped around her finger," he murmured, a smile slowly spreading across his face. "And she's got two protective fathers, so I don't think many people would be dumb enough to pick on her."
"John..." Sherlock said, his sentence broken up by kisses. "I want.... that heat was different, they're.... always... different," he murmured, not sure how to explain. "I want... you..." he said quietly. He'd only ever with those horrible people, and John had been his first during a heat, but outside of one...
Sherlock frowned, pulling his hand away a little, but John wouldn't let it give. He whined a little, shifting uncomfortably. "It hurts!" he complained childishly; he didn't care. He glanced up at Dr Maria, who seemed to have the patience of a Saint. He huffed a sigh, holding still as she resumed her work, wincing and hissing in pain occasionally.
Sherlock inhaled shakily, letting out a small puff, "I-I'm trying to calm you, you idiot." he said, trying to go for teasing but he still sounded shaken. He tapped his foot in the cab as they were driving, "Can't this idiot drive any faster?" he muttered under his breath, his whole body tense. He wanted his pups, he wanted
Katherine looked up at him, crumbs on her lips, clearly having stolen a biscuit or two... or god knew how many. "But Santa's out all night," she said.
John chuckled, though he stopped when he realised it was making his head hurt. "It's not your fault, you idiot," he murmured, closing his eyes again. "Is Katherine with Mrs H?" he asked quietly, considering falling asleep. He would wake up with a hangover, no doubt, but that would be fine. He knew how to handle a hangover, unlike everything else. "And you're going to Bart's?"
"Mmfine," Sherlock mumbled, moving his hand so he could stroke Hamish's cheek a little. The infant's face wrinkled a little, before smoothing out again, his sleep uninterrupted. He smiled a little, looking at his son still. "She looks like him, Elizabeth, she looks a bit like Mycroft. Unfortunate really," he said with a small, tired smirk. "She's quite able to pull it off though."
John set his mug down, walking over to Sherlock, impulsively fixing his bed hair. He smiled, leaning up to kiss his cheek. "I'll be home around four. Try not to pick at your wrists."
He stepped outside her room after turning on her nightlight and went back downstairs, grabbing presents from the hall closet shelf, where they were hidden out of Katherine's reach, even if she had a chair. "Santa" had got her a few things that she had asked for when they took her to go see him at the shopping centre. It took a while for Sherlock to find the most perfect toy violin. It was small enough for her hands, and played songs when the bow was dragged across it. It also had little places on the strings to put her fingers that taught her notes.
John reached over, tilting up Sherlock's chin until their eyes met. "Maybe I'll call her. Do you think Mycroft can get a number? Mobile number, preferably." John gave a small smile, running his thumb over Sherlock's lower lip. "And thank you again. Even if my parents... Harry is enough. Thank you."
John grinned again, reaching over to squeeze Katty's hand. "You didn't eat much when we first met, either, and I got you up to three solid meals a day. Just one meal, Sherlock. That's all I'm asking," he said, stealing one of Katherine's crackers and pretending to eat it, hiding it in his hand under the table as he sometimes did.
John sighed, rubbing Sherlock's back as he rinsed and spit. "You should figure out which foods upset your stomach the least. Focus on eating them," he suggested softly, kissing Sherlock's shoulder. "Come on. Let's go get Kat and head off. She's excited." He smiled at his mate and then left the bathroom, heading out to the living room to wait for them both.
Sherlock followed John out onto the pavement, the door shutting firmly behind them. "I can deduce many things, but this... sentiment in others, John I can hardly decipher it in myself," he said, almost whining a little.
Sherlock whined, writhing on John's finger and tugging his hair again. "You are being... c-cruel," he stammered, gasping as John brushed up against his prostate. He moaned, pressing more into the bed, reaching up and pulling his hat off, sticking it down haphazardly onto John's head. "I... I've been good, so please..." he begged, his breaths erratic.
Sherlock looked around rapidly, but he knew the Alpha was gone. Moriarty... the name echoed in his head as he caught a cab home. He let himself upstairs, and picked up the watch from where he had left it, then moved into the bedroom, looking at John.
"You're going to get sick if you keep pushing your body," John replied, finishing his first piece of toast and taking a longer drink of tea. "Ask Mrs H to watch her for a little while, then. Please, Sherlock. Three hours is all I'm asking." He pulled the bottle of pills from his pocket and took two of them, feeling better now that he had something in his stomach. He still felt
Sherlock waved Angelo over, doing a gesture with his hand. He came over with some wine, which Sherlock splashed up onto himself. "The usual Angelo, if you please," he said with a grin, looking at John.
Katherine rushed upstairs and slid to her knees in front of the doll house, which was still on the first floor of the flat. The tree had come down on Christmas, since they knew they wouldn't want to deal with it when they got back from the cabin. Sherlock took the last couple bags and went up the stairs after John, kicking the door closed gently behind them. He set everything down, glancing at John, and then at the bag that he knew held the test in it.
Sherlock smiled a little, looking down at her. "Need to get her pacifier out of the upstairs room," he murmured, settling down onto John's lap. He nuzzled close to him, resting his head on his shoulder. "It'll be okay. He won't win and this will go away," he said quietly, trying to help John relax a little.
John smiled, reading everything on Sherlock's face. "One at a time, love," he promised, leaning down to lock their lips together as he slowly started moving his hips, sliding in long strokes. "It still counts if I do it that way." He took Sherlock's hands and pinned them above his head, winding their fingers together as he held them against the mattress.
Sherlock moved quickly into the room, kneeling in front of John and taking his face into his hands, looking at him intently with worry.
John sighed when Sherlock moved away, wanting to just hold him for a while, to spend some time with him as he never seemed to get to. "I'll meet you in the bedroom, then," he said quietly, squeezing Sherlock's shoulder before he left the kitchen, heading into the bedroom and crawling under the covers.
John smiled down at her. "Sure, love. You go on ahead and turn it on. I'm going to go get dressed and then run down the street to get Daddy some medicine, alright?" He kissed her forehead before walking down the hall, making a pit stop in the bathroom to brush his teeth, and then quickly pulled on some jeans and a jumper. "I'll be back in a short bit," he told Sherlock when he returned to the kitchen, kissing his temple and then his lips.
Sherlock looked down at Kat, who was staring up at his face as if there was something interesting on it. "It's not that I don't like her small... but I'm looking forward to teaching her how to talk. And having conversations," he murmured. "Watching her develop as a person. From a little thing that is only concerned about its own survival into a person. Aware of the world around her," he said quietly.
John’s breath rose from his mouth in swirls, each exhale bringing about a puff of mist from his lips. He was standing what seemed to be a park, though it wasn’t one he could remember being in before. Though oddly, it felt familiar.
Sherlock swallowed, watching John get out of the car. He climbed out of the large vehicle, given to them so the snow wouldn't present a problem. He knelt down and wrapped his arms around Katherine. "I love you, and we're going to call everyday. Daddy's coming back," he murmured. "I promise, baby girl... promise," he said, throat tight.
John rolled his eyes, shifting to lean against Sherlock's shoulder. "You're a genius, you know that? And I'm awed and jealous at the same time." He wrapped his arm around Sherlock's waist, running his fingers over his hip through the silk fabric of his shirt. "And god, you look good in that shirt," he whispered, leaning up to brush his lips just under Sherlock's ear.
Sherlock leant his head against John's as he scented his neck. "Mm love you too..." he said. "Always... both of you," he breathed.
"Well he's not," he said quietly, knowing John was still in the room. "Why did you call?" he asked, getting right to it.
Sherlock didn't answer when the doctor came in and asked how they were, not even looking up really when she was talking.
Sherlock didn’t answer; he could sense that John was going to ask him something important, and he wondered what it was that was bothering him.
"Yeah, well, you don't have violent PTSD-induced nightmares," John grumbled, but he closed his eyes and fell asleep anyway. He did have nightmares, he always did, but he didn't wake up, paralyzed by the pain in his shoulder and the images he saw.
Sherlock rolled over in the bed, waiting for John still and huffing a sigh as he rolled out of bed and back into the bathroom. He saw the test there and bit his lip, looking towards the door. Ten minutes later he walked slowly down the hallway, still in his pyjamas and leaned against the door looking at John holding Katherine on his lap. He swallowed, holding the test in his hand.
Sherlock rolled over carefully onto his back, and then gently onto his left side. The bruising felt a little better and his incision was slightly more centre, so he wasn't lying on it, either. He looked at John, then down again.
Sherlock hummed, taking a breath in. He blinked his eyes a few times. Something smelled not quite right with John's scent at that. He met John's gaze, studying it carefully. He wasn't being honest about something, but Sherlock wouldn't press it now. He rested his head on John's shoulder, cradling Katherine against his own shoulder. "This will all be behind us one day... you'll see. Then it'll just be the three of us," he said quietly. And then adding, "Maybe four someday," trying to lighten the mood, brighten John's aspects for the future.
Sherlock closed his eyes when he felt John's lips on his neck, but he still felt on edge. Swallowing, he glanced up at John. "Not especially, but then I often don't like to think about it, which I suppose is but one of my many problems," he mumbled.
John smiled, stepping up beside Sherlock and taking his free hand. "Molly's waiting to meet you. Best not to disappoint her," John teased, leading the way into the hospital. He avoided the main lobby area, not wanting to deal with the
John sighed, really unsure what to say or do. He wished he was intelligent enough to help, but he knew he wasn't. Sherlock was the brilliant one, and he was fine with that.
Sherlock nodded, pulling away but keeping his hands on John as he tugged him down the hall to the sofa. He gently pushed John down onto it and then climbed up on top of him, covering him like a blanket and snuggling his cheek against his chest. "Then hold me," he murmured quietly.
Sherlock shut the drawer quickly and moved over to where he kept more of his patches usually, pulling out a box and tossing himself in his seat, tearing it open. "I suppose so," he said quietly.
Mindy bounced Katherine on her knees, tickling her sides a little. She looked over at Sherlock, frowning at how blank he was. "Katty, go sit on your Daddy's lap," she whispered, standing and walking back towards the guest room. She returned a short while later with a small bag, sitting beside Sherlock. "I've got something for you."
John sighed, leaning back against the counter with his hands braced on either side of his hips. He tipped his head back, his eyes closed and just breathed deeply. His shoulder burned, the way it did when he was freaking out or stressed or worried or... well, basically always, but now it was more prominent. Un-ignorable. He heard the door open but didn't bother looking up. He knew who it was.
Sherlock blinked. "You keep doing that," he noted, not negatively, just stating fact. “The kissing thing, and touching," he said, turning his head to look at John. "They never did... it's… different," he said.
John’s mouth was slightly agape, and he blinked rapidly as he tilted his head down, seeing the blade buried to the hilt in the side of his chest.
John grinned as soon as he realised the effect this was having on Sherlock. "Like that?" he purred, nosing under Sherlock's jaw, nipping at one of his tendons and nibbling his way down his neck, his arm holding Sherlock firmly against his chest. He moved his lips up again, scraping his teeth against the full length of Sherlock's jaw, kissing and licking his way up to his ear, where he nipped the lobe and then sucked it between his lips. He never stopped running his fingers through Sherlock's hair, thoroughly enjoy the soft sounds he was making.
"So did I," John admitted, laughing. "I wanted to be a doctor, so I started reading medical things and stumbled upon it," he said, wrapping his arms tightly around Sherlock, rubbing his hands along his back. "But it's fine. I can talk to her," he said softly, pressing a couple kisses to Sherlock's cheek.
"Good," Sherlock said, looking at him. "So, new jumper; you're not to re-wear any of them yet," he said.
John made a small sound, holding onto Sherlock tighter. "You did it for two years, and so did I. We'll get through this, and then we won't be apart again, alright?" He could feel tears slipping down his cheeks, but he kept his arms around Sherlock, kissing his skin.
You have symptoms of PPD, and you need to go to a therapist and get that talked about. Please, Sherlock. A lot of Omegas end up killing their babies when they suffer from this, and then they kill themselves from the regret of it. You can't do that; I can't lose you again.
John hummed, knowing the vibrations would travel through Sherlock's length. He reached up with his free hand, setting Sherlock's hand in his hair and making a pleased sound when it was immediately tugged on. He slowly moved his finger inside of Sherlock, stretching him open before adding the second finger. His tongue moved and flicked against Sherlock's length, out of time with his slow bobs and sucks, keeping him on edge.
Sherlock saw the glances from other people in the hospital as they rushed in, able to smell that he was at the tail-end of his heat. As soon as he saw Harry and the children he quickened his pace. Harry saw them and nudged Katherine towards him. "Daddy! Papa!" She cried, running over to them. Sherlock intercepted her and picked her up, holding her as she practically clung onto him like a koala. He shifted her so she was on one hip and took Hamish, checking him over as the infant greeted him, unfazed by where they were.
"Seb, be a doll and wake him up for me. Call me when he's thinking." The sharp clip of dress shoes met John's ears, and then the slam of a door and he was out again.
"She's a strong kicker," John said softly, leaning up to kiss Sherlock's nose. "Go to sleep, love," he murmured, wrapping his arms around him. "I'm right behind you." He nuzzled into Sherlock's hair, breathing in his scent and slowly falling asleep.
Sherlock let out a breath, hoping it wouldn't be too late. He looked up at Katherine, "That was about your papa...he's going to come home soon Katty. But in the meantime, you have to eat sweetheart," he said softly.
Jim paused, blinking a few times up at Sherlock. "But of course, love," he murmured, leaning up and stealing a kiss from Sherlock before he drew a gun from his waistband. "Have fun with that," he said with a wink, and then stuck the muzzle in his mouth and pulled the trigger.
“Who on Earth would want me as a flatmate?” he said, looking at Mike and seeing the other smile a little. “What?”
John sucked in a sharp breath at the bite on his jaw. He wrapped his fingers in Sherlock's dark curls, pulling them sharply. "You are not, and I mean not following me if I... if I die." He knew it was a possibility, but, damn it. "You have a family, we have a family, and if I don't come back, you need to take care of them."
