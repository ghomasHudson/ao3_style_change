“Want me to come back and give you some emergency rune stones?” Rhodey offered as a change of topic.
However, over Natasha’s shoulder Loki noticed Betty. Betty kept glancing at the sky behind Loki. She appeared to be scanning it and Loki let an evil smile climb onto his face.
“I need a drink.”
“I see I was right when I said he probably teleported you out of here for a reason.” The shade teased and Tony threw the man a glare.
2. Tony’s just teasing about the Father thing. Growing up Rhodey was the fun older bro to Tony, Loki the temperamental but tries to be a parent bro, and Jarvis the actual parent.
Steve tapped his chin and put on his own devious smile. “From my count, since we’ve been in New Thebes, it’s only been one.”
“Buns of Bronze.” Clint finished with a shit eating grin.
Tony spent most of his time at the Avengers villa. They would all hang out and relax. Sometimes they would all hang out together, other times it’d be just a few of them. However, Steve and Tony’s one-on-ones never happened. But Steve took it in stride. He just enjoyed spending time with Tony and Tony seemed to enjoy spending time with him and his friends.
4. Again don’t expect accurate Ancient Greece stuff so yes there are billboards.
“What’s that?” Bruce asked.
“It’s true!” Howard then pointed to a spot on the map, “This map also shows entrances to Hel.” Both boys looked at the map and saw the green and black swirl that seemed to constantly be twirling. “You can use this map to go to the underworld. Once there you can ask Lord Loki for Peggy’s soul.”
The feeling was heavier.
And I will post the first chapter after I post Chap 23. Since the prequel contains some Tony and Loki bonding I figure that’ll be the perfect time to post a few chapters. >:3
Sam gave Erskine a smile “Thank you.” He then looked at Bucky and gave the outraged man a wink which instantly flustered the brunette.
“I don’t know if we’re dating.” Steve said in a feebly tone with his hands raised. “Plus he lives here so I’m sure he’s noticed.” Steve added, immediately catching everyone's attention.
“I can’t run, I’m limping at best. And that,” Sam pointed towards the panicked areas of the city. “sounds like this Jörmungandr has just arrived. We need Thor.”
Instead he just looked the map over as if checking he was going the right direction. He then turned to his side.
“Loki.” Thor whispered in a warning tone. “Loki, are you in there?” Thor then gave the face of the statue a light tap. Nothing. “Loki!” He grabbed the base of Loki’s horns. “Loki!”
Happy and Pepper’s faces darkened but they both hid it from the Avengers as the group of friends continued to bicker.
“Cap,”
At 13 years old Tony was allowed into the living world for the first time. He had asked only a few times in the years before but it came to no fruition.
“Loki!” Thor called again
At his name said man whipped his head towards Steve and seemed to sag in relief. “Steve.” He breathed.
The Avengers pulled over and greeted them. A young child among the travelers asked where Thor was, much to their parents obvious embarrassment. The one mother began scolding their kid but Sam halted her.
The centaur nodded his head. “What are mortals doing here?”
“Heroes, mercenaries, you know? You!” He gestured at the group.
Then Tony emerged from the fog; whistling as he walked through the bog as if he was walking down a street.
“M-My name is Anthony Stark, Lord Loki.” Tony bowed again figuring it couldn’t hurt.
“And weapons?” Bucky pressed, but the silence was answer enough. Weapons were allowed.
Bucky beamed with pride as he began to talk about some of the fighting techniques he had learned in his lessons.
Steve made a noise of disagreement but Bucky held up a hand to stave him off.
“You brought people on your dates?!” Bucky chastised glaring disapprovingly at his best friend.
“Holy shit!” Bucky exclaimed.
“That would do nothing.” Loki waved his hand. “All mortal souls have a place here in Hel, once you die your spot becomes open to fill that place. In me granting you life again your place is empty and you get another spot -for your second death- but the first spot must be filled. You killing someone wouldn’t fill that, they would only fill their own place. No, you are getting two places in Hel and therefore your first place must be filled by a living soul. You must bring a living soul here to fill this current spot in Hel.” Loki paused to let that sink into the shades mind then continued.
“Let me in here!” Pepper called as she ran over and joined in the hug.
Loki, however, flinched as soon as he spoke and looked like a startled deer.
This was then shot down when Amora glared at the ground then at all the Avengers.
Tony like all young children in Greece had learned all about the major gods and goddess: Frigga the goddess of Marriage, Thor the god of Fertility and Thunder, Sif the goddess of War, Odin King of all gods, and Loki the god of Mischief and the Dead, to name a few. True he had never been to an actual temple, but they had a small shrine in their city that had a depiction of the major god/goddess.
“Bruce and I are sleeping together.” Betty chimed in. She then glanced at Bruce and Natasha. Bruce blushed a furious red while the red-head gave a slight nod “And we had a threesome with Natasha about a month ago.”
“I…I just…”
However, to his friends he sounded deranged. Sam gave Steve a questioning look, but Steve shrugged. Lord Loki had denied him a deal and was upset with Thor over putting his True Hero idea out there. However other than that they never heard from the god. Thor advised them not to visit his temples which they hadn’t; but still, no divine retribution came to them in any form. If Loki really was targeting Steve, wouldn’t he have made an attack by now? And why go through Tony?
“If you say ‘I’m fine’ or any variation of that, I will throw you over my shoulder and carry you to your place.” He deadpanned and Tony barked a laugh.
Eventually Steve and Tony made their way back to Tony’s house. They took the long way due to being on horseback but neither seemed to mind. Once they got close to a backdoor both Tony and Steve dismounted.
“Why don’t you talk to Thor?” Tony said as he slowly made his way over to the seething blue god. “You can’t believe that he’s actually cheating on you.”
“Barely.” Sam and Tony said at the same time. They shared a grin and Bucky threw his hands up in exasperation.
“Seriously, why are you here?” He asked and gestured around the bog. “Do you know what this place is?”
Thor’s mind flashed back to Loki’s years of crazed research about Hel. About how Loki would even spend their quality time pouring over document after document about Hel.
“Helped me?!” Loki barked incredulously. “Look what your “help” has done!” Loki threw out his arms and gestured to everything.
Bruce and Bucky started to talk but Tony held up his hands to silence them.
From inside the house, on the other side of the door, Tony pressed his ear against the wood and listened to the tell-tale signs of someone walking away. He then let out an inaudible sigh and leaned more heavily on the door.
“As for the Steve...stuff.” Tony ran a hand through his hair. “I think I should step back.”
“Can you tell us what happened after we left?”
After the griffin attack, New Thebes City got a surprise visit from Howard Stark. Howard and his company were working on rebuilding and repairing the city and Howard decided to use the opportunity to come see his old friends. The man had appeared at the Avengers now mansion and had given Steve and Bucky a much deserved congratulations.
“Yes they have!” She exclaimed after floundering for a few seconds.
“And nothing in here.” Natasha said after doing a search of the washroom. “Did you find anything Clint?” She pitched her voice to carry down the hall.
They all sat on cushions on the floor surrounding a low to the ground table that had food and drinks littered across it. All were dressed in casual chitons and skirts, even Thor was in a more informal dress. There was also some dice on the table and floor so Steve assumed he missed part (if not all) of game night.
However a chariot, not paying attention to the traffic guide, zoomed towards them. Clint saw the chariot approach and quickly yanked Steve out of the way. Steve blinked with wide eyes as the chariot zoomed past his face.
““Big on people”? What does this mean?” Thor inquired putting air quotes around the first part of his question.
“What’s bothering me?!” Bucky repeated almost incredulously. He turned and walked back towards Steve so they stood face to face.
“Natasha’s right. And I’ve had a bad feeling about him since the moment we met him. And worse, Steve he’s got some hold over you.”
“Can’t hear you blueberry, you’re mumbling.” Tony scolded from his spot and Loki turned to him and Amora.
Here’s Loki in basically every chapter after Chapter 6 Go the Distance.
That got her to immediately turn around in alarm. Her motherly instinct to make sure everything was alright overriding her sense that the call couldn’t be for her. Upon seeing Tony her eyes widened and she let out a surprised gasp.
But Steve rallied against it. Internally he felt as if he was wading through the ocean. Wave after wave was pushing him. But he kept pushing against the tide, against the current, against each wave.
When first charged with keeping the dead, after being dubbed as god of the Dead, he had raged at how often he was called upon to mind souls or shades of deceased mortals. However underworld minions were only as good as traffic guides. Like how traffic guides could only signal chariots and horses to go and stop; underworld minions could only gesture shades to move certain directions but if a shade wouldn’t move, they had no way (or knowledge of a way) to move them.
Their mutual friends still spoke to each other but Rhodey and Bucky never interacted with Steve or Tony, respectively. The weekly meet ups still occurred though never at Tony’s mansion, and never with Steve or Tony in attendance. It was odd, Clint and Tony still talked and hung out but Steve was never brought up. Steve still spoke with Pepper and went to Museums with her but Tony was never discussed.
“That changes things.” Sam exhaled.
“Thank you Jarvis.” He said curtly.
Brunnhilde is the goddess of wine, mead, and liquor but when she appeared before Riley and Sam she looked as if she could rival Sif for the title goddess of war; as she was decked out in her shimmering armor and polished weapons. She then complained about the gorgon killing her temple goers and gave Sam and Riley a boon in order to help slay the beast. To Riley she gave her shield and sword, and to Sam she gave her steeds wings; he could call them or retract them at will. After that she vanished, leaving the two friends to plan their attack. It was a difficult battle but the friends persisted and defeated the gorgon. In thanks, Brunnhilde appeared before them again. This time living up to her goddess attributes, as she passed drinks out to to all in celebration.
“You played fetch with the god of the Dead’s pet?” Natasha asked incredulously.
Loki, Amora, and Tony watched over the ceremony from Loki’s temple. Athens, like New Thebes had many temples to the gods. Loki’s temple happened to oversee the ceremony and so they all leered down at the Avengers and their adoring crowd.
“Yes.” Erskine smiled then stopped walking and folded his arms behind his back. “But there is an issue.” Steve’s smile dropped and he gave the older man an inquisitive look. “You are a good man Steve and will make a good hero, mentally. Physically, the wind could knock you over.”
“He’s also the perfect sparring partner for you Bucky! He could help you improve your form.” Thor added nudging the brunette with his elbow.
“What?” Steve blinked then looked horrified. “NO!”
“Steve.” Tony smiled. “Thanks for the offer but I’m good. I can actually take care of myself.” He then grabbed the blue cape he had thrown over one shoulder and wrapped it around himself like a shawl. “But I am going to be keeping your cape.”
“Bucky, Nat! Stop!” Steve ordered stepping between them and a bewildered Tony.
“He-”
to become a True Hero.”
“Jörmungandr has only ever been afraid of one thing, and that’s Thor.” Tony’s mind flashed back to when Jörmungandr would occasionally travel to Rhodey’s house to curl and take over Tony’s bed when the god of Thunder visited. Tony let a smile flit across his face then banished it. “He doesn’t like Thor’s thunder or lightning. It’s the only thing that’ll drive him away.”
“WHAT?! It took months before you agreed to train Steve and me. He just got here!” Bucky raged after he got his coughing under control.
“This will have to wait, I am being beseeched.” Thor announced
Mrs. Barnes then ushered everyone to the table for dinner. After dinner Bucky and Steve went to their shared room.
“You missed me.” The mortal teased.
“Excuse me!” Steve then turned and ran to meet Ty as the centaur charged towards him.
“Wait. How is this going to work? I’m still dead.” He looked past Steve over to Loki. “You said I’m leaving...?” He let the question hang in the air.
Loki had also given Thor a new rule, he must send a message of his arrival rather than come down unannounced. Thor had questioned it, but Loki had waived him off saying he needed to organize his work better and this would help him in his time management. And so, once they received word of Thor’s upcoming arrival Tony would move from his room in the palace to a room with Rhodey in the area of Hel where the monsters and creatures under Loki’s employ stayed.
Later that day, Bucky, Bruce, and Thor went to Tony’s. Thor had flown them all to the cliffside. He had said he was eager to see the statue of Loki his friends had talked about. It wasn’t often mortals decorated their homes with statues of his lover; his mother and father, were common decorations but not Loki.
Tony was gaining more and more years of freedom thanks to all the creatures he’d gotten to agree to fight the heroes (the griffin and the boar). As for the harpies and sea serpent, he had found out about them and told Loki about them. From there, Loki and Amora had gotten the creatures to New Thebes City. As happy as all this freedom made Tony, he was also a bit disturbed by it. Before he’d have to haggle over the time earned, but now Loki gave time away, and it unnerved the brunette.
As they all got out of the way (or in Clint’s case, pulled out of danger), Fenrir changed his size again so he was the size of a man. He then rounded on Sam and tried to take a bite of his face. Sam kept backing away and Natasha tried to attack the wolf.
Steve shook his head again and groaned. “I refuse to believe that. And you better not let Thor hear you say that or anything like that!” He warned sternly but Tony just rolled his eyes.
Bucky and Steve finally made it to the entrance of the Palace of Hel. Walking in they found themselves in a grand throne room. The only issue was that the throne was empty.
“You mean lived, sounds like he moved to Crete.” Natasha added and Tony glared at her.
“Do you want me to go with you?”
“Mamma?!” Tony gasped desperately.
“Yeah.” Tony moaned as he lifted himself up and then thrusted himself back down.
“Fine. 2 years, but no more than that.” Loki then gave Tony a rune stone and opened a portal for him.
The god of Death let out a put upon sigh then magicked Thor’s clothing back onto him. He then let the beseechment take him and Thor to wherever he was being summoned.
Thor had been arguing with his father, Odin, while his mother, Frigga, was playing the mediator -or at least trying to be the mediator. The argument was a familiar one, Loki.
“Tony?!” Steve exclaimed.
They pushed against the doorframe harder and Tony pulled away to hiss in discomfort. Steve then grabbed Tony’s thighs and lifted the man. Tony instinctively wrapped his legs around the blonde’s waist. He then gazed at the blonde in wonderment.
Loki shook his head in the negative then brushed past her and re-entered his throne room. Amora threw his back an irked look but followed. He beckoned Thor to enter and before the blonde could say anything he spoke.
News of Tony’s death spread faster than wildfire. Within minutes of it, it seemed the whole underworld had learned of Tony’s passing. The creatures who lived and worked in Hel wept and mourned for the little human that would listen and help them.
After that, New Thebes city which had already embraced their new-found heroes, began to not just embrace them but celebrate them. An old colosseum style theatre was reworked into a training yard for the heroes. Before the heroes were given beds in the barracks with the city’s guards. Now they were given a modest home for all of them to share.
” Steve yelled.
Loki’s throne room was circular and had several snake and circle designs carved into the walls. Directly across from Loki’s throne was the entrance to the throne room from Hel. There were also two other doors on either side of Loki’s throne which presumably led deeper into the underworld palace.
1. Yay Bruce joined the team. Finally we have the whole gang. Also, in this AU Hulk is NOT his own person. It’s still Bruce, but a Bruce that gets drowned in only anger.
There was no anger in those green eyes, no amusement, nothing. His eyes and face were devoid of emotion. Amora, however, appeared as excited and bubbly as ever, a little bubblier if Thor was honest.
“Lord Loki, what is your business with these mortals? These very ALIVE mortals.” Rhodes pressured. He knew he could not defeat a god but he would not let these humans be pushed around in front of him. Dead mortals were Loki’s to control, but alive ones he had no place interfering in.
“Why leave it to just you two?” Bucky interrupted. “No offense. But why not send an army? Or at least give you a battalion?”
“But I’m not a True Hero.” Steve said in a voice that was rough from crying. He then absently ran a hand through Tony’s hair and gave another sorrowful look at the brunette in his arms.
“Where are we?” Sam asked as he and the others scanned their surroundings.
you go!” Tony laughed and Steve groaned again.
“Oh yeah.” Sam nodded, “So it was probably already there.”
“They’re going the wrong way.” Tony breathed.
Steve had on a light blue knee length chiton that had a dark red, one shoulder cape attached to it. Tony meanwhile wore a red floor length chiton, with the blue cape Steve had given him when they first met around his neck as a pseudo scarf. Steve had blushed when he saw Tony still had it and Tony threw the blonde a wink.
“It’s so the event is sure to draw in a large crowd.” Sam also added as he climbed onto his horse.
“I was at work.” Rhodey said shortly and Tony patted the man’s horse back.
“WHA-!” Bucky squaked. “I wasn’t serious!”
“Was it just too hard to keep it in your chiton before you got Peggy back?” Tony asked coldly.
However the Jotunn’s, the base-line beings they were, merely embraced their new Queen and King. They encouraged her conquest of the world and used their ties to the elements to ravage the Earth for her. Odin was alone. But he wasn’t for long, for a great warrior goddess came along, Frigga. Together they forged an army and waged war on Bestla and the Jotunn’s. The Jotunn’s fought to the death to defend their tyrannical queen and would not see reason nor accept the wiser Asgardian way. So, sorrowful as it may seem, they had to cut all the Jotunn’s down till none were left alive. After Odin had defeated Bestla he had taken his throne as King of the gods and Frigga became his queen.
“Or it’s working with the monster, or part of the monster. We can’t exactly see what they are, it’s too dark here.”
The next day, Tony went over to the Avengers place. He had planned on sitting in on another training session and take more notes. However, once he arrived Thor (who had greeted him at the door) gave him a large and eager looking smile. He then literally dragged the brunette over towards the large common room. There Bruce, Betty, and Clint looked forcefully relaxed, as if they were trying to look like they were just lounging around but their body language and side glances told Tony they were anything but. Natasha, Sam and Bucky were all around Steve, blocking him from view. However, once Thor and Tony came more into the room, all three backed away from the nervous looking blonde. Bucky seemed to whisper some last minute words to his friend. Which Natasha then added to, but again the words were spoken too quietly for Tony to make out.
“I could see it.” Thor explained. “Since I’m a god it probably couldn’t take my energy and thus couldn’t blind me from the exit.”
“Oh I’d love to see Bucky apologize to me.” Tony chuckled at the mental image and Steve joined in on his laughter.
The child looked down in concentration then looked back at Steve. “What about Bucky?”
“YES!” Amora cut in, walking closer to Tony. “Loki may hold his gaze for now, but he will turn to me. I will be the one he chooses last.”
“Really?” Tony asked unkindly. “Everytime you’ve suggested something, he’s shot it down. Everytime you’ve done something, he reverses it. What part of that sounds like he needs you?”
“What is it?”
“Did you even have a plan?” Sam questioned.
“Technically he’s a wolf and he’s not mine.” Tony hedged weakly. “He’s Loki’s pet….one of his favorites.”
“So forever.” Natasha chimed in with a smirk.
“Don’t listen to him!” Tony threw a pillow at the god. “His opinion doesn’t count. I’m amazing!”
“The whistling.” Natasha breathed, everything coming together in her mind. “If you don’t belong you move around silently. So when stumbled upon you are immediately identified as outsiders and thus a threat. Tony makes his presence known so none of the monsters attack him because he acts like he belongs there.”
“Yes.” Rhode said sharply. Steve looked startled at the centaurs brisk tone but the centaur only gave him a blank stare.
Sam didn’t look convinced and the next day Bucky didn’t either. That week, at the weekly meet up, Tony went over to Steve with his tablet in hand.
’ Steve thought.
Thor was the only one who could handle Steve’s strength. So it was with the gods assistance that Steve learned where the line of acceptable and excess was. It was a rigorous year of relearning the basics, like running, stopping, gripping, pushing, etc. For an entire year Erskine, Bucky, and Thor had dedicated themselves to teaching Steve control. To the point that a Heavenly minion was sent to the island in order to notify Thor he had responsibilities he had to see to. So a few weeks out of the year Thor would go off, shepherd storms and take care of his other duties then return to help the mortals he now called friends.
They had gone a few more rounds, all the while Loki had remained blue and red eyed. Proving his point of still being angry at the blonde. However when Thor woke the next morning, Loki’s skin was pale and his eyes green.
As Tony climaxed Steve was hard pressed to keep his own climax away for long.  He meant to pull out but with Tony’s insides clamping down and squeezing him the blonde couldn’t help but let his own climax blind him. He held the brunette’s hips against his own as he came deep inside Tony. Causing said man to moan again.
“FOCUS!” Tony yelled, startling both Steve and Thor. “Don’t kill him! He’s just following orders. We need you to scare him.”
“I don’t get it.” Steve swivelled to look at him and Tony plowed on. “I don’t know how the sea can remind you of that because you are anything but useless. You do everything to be of use to someone! You fight monsters! You teach people! Even tonight! You went to that unveiling because you knew they wanted a crowd.” Tony raved. Steve made to say something, but Tony took a page out of the blonde’s book and covered Steve’s mouth with his hand.
’ Tony opened the door and stared out at the empty porch in front of him and let out another deep sigh. ‘
“Huh?” Tony quirked an eyebrow and gave Steve a puzzled look, which the blonde mirrored.
Never look back, only forward!
4. I’m sure you’ve all noticed I don’t describe much of the characters physical appearance. I think Loki is the only one I went in depth on. This is on purpose and it’s because everyone (myself included) has their own pictures in their minds for these characters and I don’t really like it when my mental picture gets broken. So please note I will continue to NOT describe their physical appearance much outside what I’ve already done.
However upon seeing Steve alive, her mouth dropped into a frown.
“No killing.” The redhead answered.
“That mortal!” Loki seethed, he then glared at Tony who flinched a bit at the amount of sudden anger in Loki’s eyes. “What happened?”
“WOAH! Shut up!”
“Did you move my statue?”
Pepper appeared shocked then a huge smile overtook her face. She tried to tamper it down but it kept blooming back up.
“You have those?” Sam quipped. Natasha held her hand up for Sam to high five while Bucky shot them both a glare.
There was a pause and Bucky held his breath fearing they noticed him.
“Halt!” Steve demanded, taking a power stance in the river’s shallows.
“Come on Clint!” Natasha leapt onto the horse and held out her arm for the blonde to grab so she could hoist him up behind her.
“Tell me their weaknesses.” Loki said gently. “Then you can have this house. All the money you will ever need. And all the freedom you deserve! And you’ll never have to see those Avengers again.”
“Yeah.” Tony answered.
Steve and Tony were curled together, Tony half laying on top of Steve. They were in the skylight room, wrapped in a blanket and looking up at the stars.
After a few more deep breaths and gasps Tony nodded at Steve. “Ok, I’m good.”
“Yeah!” He laughed. “Yeah, I would have actually put effort into making it a good kiss.”
“Surely Loki did not let Tony live in...terrible discomfort?” Thor hedged his question uncomfortably.
“Yeah, I’ll let you all know how Blueberry is doing.” The green ball came right up to Tony, engulfed him and thus teleported him in front of said god.
“So how fares the training?”
“You know I cannot lie. Anything.”
“Tony thinks we’re all sleeping with Thor!” Steve yelled out and Tony face palmed.
They played a few more rounds of fetch till Tony was out of arrows. Then when Fenrir returned Tony pet the wolf and Fenrir preened at the attention.
Tony continued to shake his head as he started crying. “Dad please-”
“Don’t talk. Take a moment. Relax. I’ve got you.” And so Tony did. He just sat there for a moment and let himself get back to working order.
“You had a head wound.”
Erskine then shrugged and grabbed a bottle of wine. “Time to drink!”
“Perhaps prolonged exposure in Hel affects mortals this way?” Thor wondered but Steve shook his head.
“Ok.” Steve agreed gently, then gestured to the bed. “I’m not leaving you though. Get into bed punk.”
“Property Damage? Tony he’s been harrassing people.” Steve explained also in a serious tone. “General Ross and his daughter-”
“I mean it!” Steve cried, and Bucky stepped towards him in support.
“WHAT?!” Everyone yelled back.
of freedom! Because you are going right back to Hel! And I will enjoy tearing your soul asunder everyday for the rest of eternity!”
“Lord Loki knows you’re coming.” Pepper stated bluntly, as all shades tend to do. “In fact I was sent to guide you to the field of Content Souls so you-” She gestured to Steve but Thor cut her off.
“No.” Everyone answered back, and Pepper blinked in confusion.
Eventually the Avengers left to head back home, with Tony saying he’d drop by the next day after Rhodey went back to his job. As they walked back, Bruce gave Steve a companionable pat on the back.
“Loki?”
The blonde looked unprepared for these questions. His mouth hung open as if trying to will itself to say something but his brain supplied it nothing. Sam meanwhile groaned and pushed at Bucky’s shoulder lightly.
They stopped where the ferry usually picks up new souls then the taller one pointed onwards while the smaller one pointed to the river.
“I can take it.” He affirmed, and Erskine grabbed his shoulder again.
“He’s attacking the city right now. Everyone else is holding him off and trying-” Steve tried to explain but Thor cut him off by seizing both the blonde’s shoulders in a panic.
He and his friend Riley were tasked by their king to rid the land of a gorgon that repeatedly terrorized the Temple of Brunnhilde and turned all the temple goers to stone. Since the Temple was a spot for many pilgrimages the gorgon never seemed to run out of victims. No matter what the people did they could never stop the gorgon from coming to the temple everyday and killing everyone inside.
“DO NOT MOVE!” The unknown voice yelled again.
“How long has your family lived in New Thebes?” Natasha inquired while grabbing the dice for her roll.
“Tell me about it.” Tony grumbled and moved back a bit, causing the foreign voice to step forward.
Loki then huffed and went back to Hel with Thor. Whom he tried to push and shove away but the god of thunder was relentless. When the portal closed the mortals could all still see Thor and Loki wrestling and arguing with each other. Rhodey just shrugged and assured them all that everything would be fine.
Thor was, as usual, out of this world. He talked with Steve and let Steve discuss the feeling that he had carried. He didn’t approve of how Steve ended things but agreed it needed to happen. He also comforted Tony, and felt for the man who thought he found love, only for it have been ripped away by the very person giving it.
Everyone moved closer to where Clint was. Then, sure enough, they saw a man. A familiar looking man.
After a long silence passed Loki began to get irritated and was about to becken Fenrir just to be rid of the fidgeting shade in front of him; then Howard spoke up.
“He owned me.” Tony said as if he had already explained this numerous times today.
If they weren’t training or fighting, they were making their public appearances. They supported chiton, toys, and sandal deals, posed for pottery, appeared at grand openings, and regularly toured for signature sessions with their many fans. They had to hire a Manager to oversee all these public affairs and thus Phil Coulson came into the Avengers lives.
“I’m sorry.” Steve said again and Tony bolted. Pepper ran after him, Happy and Jan at her heels.
“Oh!” Thor exclaimed. “You’ve returned!” A leftover laugh from whatever Erskine and Steve missed escaped his lips and he jostled Bucky.
for help.”
Bucky and Bruce winced and Bucky finally came forward. Tony crossed his arms and glared at the man, Bucky only looked sheepish as he accepted the glare.
3. I love the mental image of Loki trying so hard to fill these shitty job positions. Better put that silver tongue to use.
The path they walked on began to look more and more dreary. A lot of trees were dead or dying, and leaves coated the ground so much that grass was sparse.
Merry -early- Christmas and Happy Holidays!! :D
“Because he knew that would rile her up more.” Steve finally spoke. Upon looking up, his friends could see his face was a storm of anger. “He made Tony think I was just …
“Yes!” Tony calmed down a bit but anger was still laced in his tone. “He lives in the Monster Bog.”
Steve only looked confused and Bucky let out a sigh.
Steve threw a heated glare at the brunette but Tony held his ground and just glared back. Steve opened his mouth to say something but Tony’s glare worsened and he cut him off.
“Another time Father.” Thor said in parting then closed his eyes and let the beseechment take him.
Tony nodded his head and took a deep gulp. He would not let his father down. He would help them get Lord Loki’s support.
Tony gulped as Loki looked at him. The gods eyes seemed to pinch when examining Tony before they slid over to his Father.
“Hey guys!” Tony greeted still sitting on Rhodey’s back.
“It’s fine, we know he’s the favorite.” Sam gave a wink and the adults chuckled.
Phil returned with some proper medical bindings and salves. Once Sam’s leg was wrapped, he got up and leaned against Bucky in order to take some weight off his injured leg. Tony, meanwhile, looked out to the horizon and scrunched his face in frustration.
“So where are we going?” Tony asked as he and Steve walked through New Thebes City.
Amora was gone. After Thor had freed the Avengers from her control they had pounced on her. She was able to knock away Bucky and Natasha but when Bruce barreled into her in his hulk form, she couldn’t do anything to defend against that. Bruce had grabbed her feet and flung her to and fro into the ground. Then Clint had hit her with a few arrows and Bucky got a solid kick into her back. When she tried to retaliate, mjolnir hit her squarely in her side and sent her crashing up into the harbor.
“I am enjoying the view I have found.” Thor now braced his arms on the table, caging Loki in against his own body. Thor closed his eyes and leaned forward to capture Loki’s lips  “Now I think I’d like to enjoy my find fully.”
“We have rival heroes?” Bruce asked and Betty patted his cheek.
Thor and Bucky sat on the grass and shared a look as the two wandered off.
Everyone stood up a little straighter and glanced at each other, except Steve who had avoided eye contact.
“Let’s not get back on that again!” The both laughed and Steve and Erskine shared a confused look.
“No Steve’s just oblivious!” Bucky rebutted as he dragged a hand down his face.
“Please Avengers!” She screamed, and everyone began to run over to her.
“Thanks for the lift Cap. Next time we can try the Jerk Off.” Tony said in a teasing tone as he waltzed over to the door, Steve shook his head as he walked the man to the door.
“Thor, my dear!” Amora grabbed his bare arm. “Loki and I were talking about something very important before you came in. Please!” She yanked on him with surprising strength and began manhandling him out of the throne room. “Just one moment! Stay out here, let us finish! And then you can come back in and ask for,” She gave him a once over and threw him a flirty wink “whatever you want.” She said in a seductive tone.
“Loki!” Thor roared and was greeted by a wave of ice being blasted at him.
“Good job...Captain.” He said, creating the nickname for the blonde who had so easily grabbed ownership of every situation the brunette had witnessed.
“Then you should come down more often.” Loki retorted his eyes still scanning the scroll in his hands.
“Apologies friends,” Thor greeted and Clint let out what could only be described as a ‘meep’ “but I hadn’t fought a beast in quite some time and couldn’t let you have all the fun.” He winked and the original trio rolled their eyes.
“A god will always be more powerful than a witch.” Tony said with a smirk.
“Can’t you hear them?!” The blonde seemed to yell into the sky. “The people are panicking. Jörmungandr is probably attacking civilians and all we’re doing is running away.”
Howard snapped his head up and laughed with relief. He was alive!
Bucky made to follow them but Thor held him back. Erskine and Steve walked into the forest silently and eventually sat next to a steady stream.
“I just told them all off! Steve’s definitely not going to devolve all his greatest weaknesses to me now.” The brunette groaned. “I’m back to square one. Actually negative one…..You should send Amora in. She’s right, I can’t handle people.”
3. I have started making memes for this fic because I think I’m hilarious lol. Anyway, I’ll probably add them at the end in like chapter 27. But in the meantime you can find them on my tumblr, under the tag “The Hercules AU”
“What does that mean?” Natasha asked still in her fighting position.
“Well he did help with the war.” Natasha hedged, carefully.
“Fenrir!” Tony chastised as the wolf kept licking him. “Fenrir Stop!” Tony had to let out a giggle as the wolf kept lapping him in love and attention.
Tony gave a brighter smile and gestured to all of Steve. “Look at you! You always know how to handle your team. You take charge of every situation. You are a Captain, leading your crew.” Steve looked bashful and like he was about to deny it when the brunette pushed his shoulder good naturedly. “Just accept it. It’s not changing.”
“Yeah this screams great idea.” Clint muttered sarcastically at the sight before them.
“You-?! O-one?! No! It-It’s...You know I had a ton of people falling for me back home!” Steve only continued to laugh so Bucky hit him in the face with a pillow. “And your count’s wrong! It’s been more than one here!”
Thor was sitting on the armchair with Loki on his lap, the raven haired gods back plastered against his chest. Loki had his hands braced on the armrests and used them to help lift himself up and down Thor’s cock. Thor for his part, kept jutting his hips in time with Loki’s movements. He also had his hands on Loki’s waist, assisting in the rhythm.
“Tony? TONY!” Steve screamed as he bent down to try and steady the slowly crumbling man.
Pepper gave Steve a gentle smile. “I’m Pepper Potts, I died quite a while ago. I don’t have a rank here, I’m just a shade.”
“No,” Tony took a steadying breath. “I got this.”
“Speaking of blood and...stuff.” Bruce chimed in then pointed at Tony. “Are we sure we don’t want to bring him with us? Tony, you said so yourself, Asterion’s killed people to defend himself. If we bring you he’s sure not to attack us. Without you...it’s kind of a gamble, right?”
“Want me to go grab you something? I don’t have a canteen on me.” Steve offered but Tony shook his head.
In a flash of green Tony appeared in the Arena.
They both went to their knees before the throne and bowed their heads. “Oh great Lord Loki, please hear us and answer our prayer! We beseech you!”
Steve looked around the area then studied some trees in the distance till a look of recognition lit up his face.
Maria looked up at him as tears continued to pour down her face. Tony’s own tears sprung back up to his eyes as he moved closer to her. He tried to keep them at bay but when he went to explain he was alive, a sob overtook him. Startled as he couldn't seem to control himself. Tony stopped and clutched his chest as he tried to stave off his tears so he could explain. He felt a desperation overtake him as he tried harder and harder to get his emotions in check. He had to make her see. He had to touch her. He was alive and wouldn’t leave her. He had to get her to see that!
“Centaurs are usually protectors.” Bucky stated, folding his arms across his chest. “And you sounded like you knew that guy.” Steve gave Bucky a harsh questioning look while Tony folded his arms over his chest defensively. “So want to elaborate more or are you sticking to “these things happen”?”
“Peggy always took the lead though.”
“Have you slain-” The king began to ask but cut himself off as the other Avengers and Asterion walked out. “WHAT ARE YOU-?!”
Bucky was across the circle from Steve. Steve’s body took slow steps towards his best friend. With each step, Steve looked more and more pained while Bucky seemed to calm himself and put on a look of acceptance. Steve tried to will himself to stop. He pushed against Amora’s control with all his might, with all his soul.
“It’s been about a week since we’ve seen the guy.” Bucky reasoned.
“Bucky come on! All of us know you don’t like him.”
Tony whirled back to him and stomped over to the blonde, Steve meeting him halfway. The two glared at each other.
Tony huffed again and pushed on his friends human shoulder. “People are bastards. But…” Tony squeezed himself “I know more than anyone, that no one deserves to be trapped in Hel forever.”
Tony meanwhile was congratulating himself on being prepared for that question. He knew it would come up. If not during this mission then during his life when he was free. He had asked Jarvis if it was OK to take his name and the shade broke into tears of happiness at the question. He had then gushed on how happy and honored that would make him, as he never had a child but considered Tony his own. However he had to verify if it was alright with his wife. Of course Ana was thrilled and also moved to tears at Tony’s request.
“Right.” Tony said in a clipped tone which got a puzzled look from Steve. “Good thing I’m a fantastic escape artist!” He bragged quickly so as to change the subject. “That’s twice I got you out of a jam today.”
Loki was now completely blue and his eyes red. His body jerked again and he growled. “I am being beseeched!”
Howard quickly averted his gaze and took a hard gulp.
“Loki?” The sound of Thor opening some of the other doors in the hallway alarmed both Tony and Loki and they began to search more frantically.
Loki was adopted. His real father was a drug trafficker that Odin himself sent away to jail. Thor and Loki had no idea. Loki found out during a fight with Odin and bolted. Thor called all his friends in a mad plea to help him locate his brother.
Though the 5 mortals were holding their own Thor had interfered. He didn’t want to risk their safety and had killed the Hydra in a show of power. He was protecting them and showing off for them!
Steve blinked and couldn't prevent the confusion from blooming onto his face.
Jan greeted all of them and then gave them a tour. Jan then rushed off to finish the shows last minute preparations and everyone split into groups and decided to take a walk about London. At the end of the night some people stayed at Jan’s, others stayed at Tony’s. Both Rhodey and Bucky comforted their respective best friends as the boys spent a lot of the night discussing how they hoped Tony/Steve was doing alright. Both friends supplied comforting words but Tony and Steve dismissed them.
Last night, Tony looked at his Tally Sheet he had stored away in his bedroom and it brought nothing but dismay. For even though he had gained quite a few years of freedom it was limited. He just wanted to live his life. And Steve. Poor Steve was just caught in the middle of something he never should’ve been.
“Who’s Asterion?” Phil asked and Tony turned his glare onto him.
2. Loki really hates Howard once he sees Howard had brought his son. Surprise to no one, Loki has daddy issues and Howard sacrificing Tony kinda brought up those feelings.
“Thanks Steve. I’ll keep that in mind.”
“ARGH!” Tony let out, frustrated at himself for once again thinking the Avengers were somehow better than all the heroes he’s known before.
“I agree.” Steve put in. “If we don’t end this here it’ll keep following us. Loki will just keep sending monsters after us. This needs to stop.”
Now after recently passing the 3 year mark Erskine appeared to only be running them through drills. There didn’t appear to be anymore lessons, just repeated practice. Eventually one night he came up to the group with a round of drinks and announced he believed they were ready to leave the island.
Loki watched from his spot in the shadows of the gorge as Tony and the accursed mortals finally arrived at their trap. From his vantage point, Loki watched as Tony was left near the horses and the mortals all ran towards where Amora was.
“I have nothing to say to you. Leave.” Loki said through gritted teeth.
Howard smiled at Steve and waved off his thanks. “How many times do I have to tell you to call me Howard. You’ve worked for me, what 4 years now?”
“No, we didn’t go into the office at all today.” Steve sighed, slumping on his hammock.
A gagging noise stopped the blonde abruptly. Thor opened his eyes and spotted Loki throwing a death glare at the table.
“Oh I am going to defile you!” He teased then pulled Steve’s mouth back towards his own.
“And you believed him?!”
“James Buchanan Barnes, my Lord.”
Steve finally stepped forward and extended his hand. “Thank you for the save, and the advice.”
“Shall we make our way over to the bed?” Loki asked breathlessly breaking the kiss.
Natasha sent him a look but the archer just gestured at the fog with a ‘can you blame me?’ face.
“More like
The three looked out at the city in contemplation. From their viewpoint they could see the harbor, the different levels of the city, and the area Jörmungandr obviously was. Tony’s eyes caught on the harbor.
Bruce had decided he would stay behind in New Thebes City. He reasoned that he wanted to let Betty know he was ok and would inform the city guard that the threats should cease now. So after Frigga had bestowed the title True Hero upon Steve, and healed Sam’s leg, she had taken off back to Asgard.
“Lord Loki, I’m sorry, but I am a centaur. We are creatures that aim to protect and defend. Which isn’t something I believe I can do here in Hel.”
“Huh.” Clint said then grabbed Natasha’s arm and made her lower her weapon. “He has a point.”
It turned out the king did not approve of Riley and his daughter and thus tried to have Riley killed. So Riley, Sam, and the princess decided the best course of action would be to leave and never come back. Which had worked out. However Riley and his now bride deserved some time to just be a couple. So Sam had parted from his friend promising to write and return eventually. He then traveled around and helped out with small jobs where he could. Then he ran into Thor and was recruited into helping them.
“You what?!” Tony gasped again giving the blonde a once-over.
The next day Howard had given the city a motivational speech about the importance of continuing to move forward and how great the Avengers were. He also commissioned a statue of the Avengers to be built.
“I’ve seen the way you look at him.”
“The underworld! You mean Hel?!” Tony gasped now frightened.
Loki viciously held back his tears. “He died! And there’s nothing I can do!”
Tony then explained how he had used his time in Hel to learn various fighting styles, culture normalities, languages, and other such stuff from souls from all over the world. When Tony had spoken in another language at the Avengers request, Steve had flushed scarlet. Tony winked at him and made a note to use that information later.
As Sam and Bucky bickered Steve let out an amused breath and shook his head. Then he heard something and stopped dead in his tracks.
All the while Loki had tears falling and frozen on his blue face.
“He’s truly a worthy hero.”
The blonde began pistoning his hips up into Tony at the same time he brought the brunette down. Tony and Steve moaned then sealed their lips together in a messy, teeth crashing kiss.
“Running away from me won’t protect me.”
“Then we need to go to his temple and beseech him.”
“Any idea what the statue is of?” Tony asked as they all got on their horses. “Or is this just another perk to being a superstar? Getting invited to all the big events.”
“And you bring your son.” Howard only nodded minutely.
“Sorry about yesterday guys.”
. But they’re not all bad, most are actually misunderstood! And the more I know about them the better. I mean knowledge is power right?! So ...and I’m rambling like an idiot.” Tony finished then gave Steve a sheepish look. “Sorry.”
Sensing Tony’s nerves were getting the best of him, Rhodey whipped him with his tail. Tony put on an affronted face and Rhodey chuckled.
“Eh, what’s life without adventure.” Sam joked and Bucky glared at his lover.
The two had gone to Loki’s chambers and Tony had dropped the black fabric he had used to cover himself while under the table.
“I agree to work for you. On the condition that I am allowed to guard and protect this boy as long as he’s in the underworld.”
Steve reached out and attempted to grab her hand but he couldn’t even feel it. If he pushed, his hand would go right through her. He gave Peggy a look of sadness that the woman scoffed at.
2. This chapter jumped around a lot and is long but I didn’t want to cut this into separate chapters as the main point was their meeting.
“It’s his motto.” He stuttered still trying to get his breathing back under control.
“I saw you!” Bucky seethed, anger rolling off him in waves.
“I think I hear him and someone else in the backyard.”
“So how’s the hunt going?” The voice asked.
“I mean come on Honey-boo. If you’re going to debate with me you need to bring credible support.”
1. Sassy Bucky is the best, and of course it’s always on main.
Loki was not able to repress the eye roll this time. “I’m not interested in killing anyone but all of you!” He practically shouted. “If you stay here, then yes your city will suffer. If you leave then the monsters will go after you!”
When the group wasn’t training they were usually facing the latest monster of the week.
“Back to his equally beautiful alabaster form.” Loki glared at his lover and groaned in frustration.
“I’m not blind Tony. I know you!” Rhodey grabbed the man by his shoulders. “You like him!”
“You’re sure? You haven’t even heard the whole thing.” Loki asked skeptically.
Tony shrugged weakly and averted his gaze. “I told you, Loki owned me.”
Turns out they were at the perfect position to travel up the back-way to Tony’s house. Upon entering said house, the Avengers all gawked. Steve had only ever seen the outside of it (after walking Tony home every so often) but had never actually been inside.
“Low blow!” Sam muttered.
Loki tilted his head and looked them all over with a frown.
Their friends were ecstatic. Everyone gave their congratulations but Bucky and Sam saw something in Steve’s eyes. He brushed them off and they let it drop.
“What’s bothering you?” Steve asked, tired of Bucky’s rude attitude.
Tony looked at the god’s green eyes and swallowed heavily.
Loki shook his head and let out an “Ugh. No Tony I do not.” He then waved his hand as if dismissing the thought. “Rhodey wanted to stay with you tonight so I was checking to make sure it’s clear. When low and behold I see the Avengers here.”
“Ack! What are you doing?!” Tony exclaimed as he tried to get his bearings after being manhandled so easily.
Tony blushed at Steve’s honest declaration. Then he quickly broke the eye contact they had maintained and coughed to try and help compose himself.
“If we become True Hero’s will we get a boon as well?!” Clint asked, excitement lighting up his eyes.
“Yes you can.” Rhodey silently cheered, giving his friend’s shoulder a squeeze.
“You were injured.”
Sam cheered as Steve walked into the sitting room where everyone was gathered, sans Coulson. Who was more than likely still working because the man never knew when to take a break.
Then with a new wave of anger and ice, Loki shouted. “
“Way to go Bud!” Sam cheered giving Steve’s shoulder a friendly slap from his other side..
“I think this was just the perfect storm.” Steve offered almost apprehensively.  “Your head wound, your hatred of Tony, the long day.” He rattled off but stopped at Bucky’s frustrated groan.
“Nat we have to do it!” He grabbed the redhead’s shoulders and smiled an enormous smile. “We could ask for anything! Anything!”
“Why do you think I asked for all those books and papers Thor?!” Loki threw an arm out towards the door. “I was looking for a way to get him out!”
Amora struggled for just a second before looking triumphant.
“It’s a large crowd.” Tony still gave a blank look so Steve continued, quirking his own eyebrow. “Before you mentioned you don’t like crowds.” Tony’s face finally dawned in understanding and he gave the blonde a small smile.
And Tony would no longer get his freedom. He’d go back to Hel. Freedom had been so close and now...it was back to being so far away.
Suddenly a loud and long hiss penetrated the gorge, setting everyone on edge. Tony tightened his hold on the blue cape. Meanwhile the 5 heroes and gathered crowd turned their attention to the dark abyss. Amora used the distraction to slip away and up to where Loki was, and Loki leaned forward in his makeshift seat in anticipation.
Natasha sat down in order to catch her breath. Meanwhile, Steve was bent over with his hands on his knees.
“Um, who are you?” Bucky finally asked.
“Because I love him. When the man you love. A man who has been abandoned and scared of love leaving him. Kneels in front of you and asks you to spend forever with him. You say yes.”
with Thor. But you...you
“No?” A voice broke Steve out of his thoughts.
“Yes and would have been lost, if not for some kind shade’s help.” Natasha added.
“I merely am eager to see friend Tony again. It has been sometime since I’ve last seen you.” Thor said throwing his smile to the brunette in his arms.
Loki gave everyone a very heated and angry glare. When his red eyes passed over Pepper, the shade gave him a helpless shrug, to which Loki barely batted an eye.
Tony had invented a pulley of sorts that dangled over the cliffside. It made travel up to his house easier and less time consuming. When he showed it off, Clint had dubbed it Jerk Off and Tony had laughed so hard he ended up on the floor. He then said he was keeping the name, much to the dismay of everyone sans Clint.
“Keep that in mind.” Rhodey growled.
“This is my most prized possession.” Howard informed them looking at the scroll. “No one but me knows of it, so you must not tell
“I’ll go back and get them.” Steve turned to begin his journey but Bucky grabbed his shoulder.
“What?!” She snapped.
Loki teleported in front of Thor and slapped the blonde across the face as hard as he could.
Tony felt a smug smirk slide across his face.
“I don’t know if we should be dropping in unannounced.” Steve said, yet he still followed his friends up the cliffside.
“I figured we would start with a play.” He said and Tony gave him a teasing nudge in the ribs.
“It’s not great.”  Natasha reported.
“I am getting us a drink” Thor announced then went up behind Loki and moved his hair off his one shoulder and laid several kisses along the pale neck. “And when I come back…”
“Now head on back, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“I’m gonna make that punk pay for this later.” Bucky swore and Sam nodded in agreement.
Then Tony made to pull away and just as there was a few centimeters between their lips, Steve surged forward. This time, Tony was the one caught off guard. As Steve grabbed the back of the brunettes head and his shoulder, then pulled him close.
“Listen…hey what is your name?” Tony cut in.
After all his revelations the night before Tony came to another conclusion. He wouldn’t hurt Steve, not anymore than he already has. He’ll stay away. He had even talked to the Loki statue on the off chance Loki was watching him, and asked the god to come pick him up. He didn’t want to hurt Steve, and staying with him and getting even more attached would hurt the blonde and himself when Tony eventually had to leave.
Clint, Bucky, and Sam all stayed on “Steve’s side” meanwhile Rhodey, Pepper, Jan, Hank, Happy, and Bruce when he returned, all stayed on “Tony’s side”. Natasha was pissed at Steve for a long time. She gave him a verbal beat down for remaining silent, for giving Tony false hope and feelings, but she went back to him. She sided with Tony but Steve was her friend.
“Loki is trying to kill all of you…?” Thor muttered, confused beyond words. “Loki owned you?!” Thor gestured to Tony. “But you’re alive! And Jörmungandr…? Wait! He sent Jörmungandr?! His favorite pet?!”
All eyes turned to her and she gave them a perplexed look. “How was that unexpected? You came here to get Peggy’s soul, correct?”
“Could you for once be on my side?”
“Great!” Steve then pulled Tony over to the guard that had been talking and yanked the man off the horse.
“Is this the same guy from the Hydra?” Clint asked Sam who nodded in the affirmative.
“Loki doesn’t do anything to you, because you’re not a threat...” He smirked. “Your entertainment!” Amora’s nostrils flared as her whole body was instantly filled with red hot fury.
“As do I!” Amora retorted, giving a cold glare.
!” He swore.
Steve’s rope he was swinging on in order to cross the chasm had broke and he began falling. Sam had immediately jumped into action and dove after the falling blonde. As he dove large red wings had sprouted from the contraptions. He grabbed Steve then pulled them both up into the sky. He then manueved them so he could deposit Steve safely back onto the ground. Once on the ground the wings hadn’t vanished and all three mortals gave Sam a confused and bewildered look.
2. The ending chapters are honestly my favorite because the Mist scenes are something I have been SO READY to write. In the flashbacks I skipped a lot of the descriptions and mainly kept the dialogue. You’ve mostly read this all before, this is just a refresher. And as for the new flashback scenes I kept the descriptions brief.
Red flooded Loki’s eyes and blue overtook his skin as the god growled in anger. Tony went over and grabbed his furs as ice fanned out around the room. Amora walked over to the throne and leaned against one of the arm rests.
Tony was in trouble. He was in so much trouble. And he was having a hard time digging himself out. Tony may be falling a little, tiny bit, in love with Steve.
“Why do they always have these private talks when I visit?” Thor questioned, gesturing to the two retreating backs with a bottle of wine.
“No! Steve you didn’t hurt me.” Tony comforted, grabbing the blonde’s shoulder. “It’s me!” He then pushed away from Steve and his questioning gaze.
2. I am not good at writing fights but I think I did ok with this one.
Tony rolled his eyes and blew out a frustrated breath. “Everyone knows!”
“Maybe it was an underworld trick?” Natasha wondered. “They say the underworld is filled with traps and pitfalls to make sure no living soul makes it out of here alive.”
“Not sure exactly how long. Now it’s just me and I’m not big on people.”
“OUTRAGEOUS!” King Minos yelled back, and motioned for his guards to draw their weapons.
“I don’t even remember moving.” Natasha pondered.
“But-”
“Thor?” Sam patted the god’s shoulder. “You ok?”
“So where did you spend your day?” Bucky asked as Steve took a seat between him and Sam.
“I assume you’re still looking after him?” She asked and Bucky breathed out a laugh.
“Ready? Ready?” Tony teased then fired the arrow. “Go get it!”
“I have faith in you.” Loki put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, and Bucky hastily crept back to the front door.
Everyone took a moment to let that sink in. Thor then noticed that once again they had journeyed away from the yellow path. Thor beckoned his friends to follow him and once again they departed the mist.
People. For 3 months he’d be alone surrounded by people, living people. Something he was not used to and unsure he was prepared to handle.
“Do not act like you know my power!” Amora turned now to fully face Tony. “Loki protected you from me! If you weren’t his slave then I would have tortured and killed you a hundred different ways by now. And you would
“Thor loves strength.” Amora muttered, jealousy clear in her tone. “He’s endearing himself to Thor even more!”
“No need to apologize. Your right.” Steve looked forward again and recalled Erskine in his mind “Knowledge is power.”
“And how do you know that?!” Loki snapped.
“-believe it’s for the best and so-”
“Tony, breath. It’s alright.” Steve tried to comfort but Tony kept hunching into himself.
2. I hate this chapter. I wrote and rewrote this so many times, and at this point I’m done, I don’t love this final result but I can’t do it anymore. I got the points across: Erskine is selective, picked Steve, Steve transformed, Thor is around often and forming friendship with them.
“Yes. Yes, I’m not feeling the best,” Loki then pushed on the larger gods chest. “Perhaps we should move to my chambers. It’s too damp in here. It’s affecting my mood.”
Frigga gave him a serene smile and patted his face in a loving manner.
Tony raised his eyebrows at that but then Loki rounded on him.
Inside, the Temple was filled with people. This was not just a temple placed in a large city, or a shrine in a smaller one. This was one of Frigga’s main temples, a place many pilgrimages occurred and so it was crowded. However, Bucky and Natasha seemed to be standing guard at an entryway leading to one of the small alcoves in the Temple.
“Tony no.”
Loki looked startled as did Tony. Both of them reeling from Tony’s refusal.
“Ana is Edwin Jarvis’ wife. My Great Grandparents. After he married in they kept a low profile. Kind of a secretive family.” Tony shrugged.
Thor gave a haughty smirk and began to thrust his quickly hardening dick against Loki’s ass. “Good.”
Frigga then asked Thor to recount all of Steve’s deeds. While he spoke his mother ran her fingers through his hair in a calming manner. Once he was done she gave him a kiss on the cheek and told him all would be well.
“TONY!” Steve immediately ran towards the man.
“Hard Pass.” Tony eventually said then turned to try and get out of the shallow end of the river.
Bucky and everyone swallowed a hard lump. Bruce had calmed down out of his hulk form and collapsed next to Sam. His tears flowed freely as he looked over his deceased friend. Sam wrapped the man in a one armed hug.
“Return him?” Loki scoffed, “Touch him and will your wish into existence.”
That night Rhodey had to go back to Hel. He gave Tony a long and firm hug and promised to try and visit again soon.
Some time later, Tony took Steve to the Statue of Liberty, they’d been before, but Steve loved it and Tony loved Steve. Steve was enjoying the view from the Statues base when Tony dropped to one knee. The feeling grew.
“Get me a creature that can kill that Steve Rogers and I’ll give you 5 years of freedom!” Loki barked from his throne as soon as Tony entered.
“Steve don’t-!”
“This is all contingent on him even letting us back into his house.” Clint added with a wince. The other Avengers similarly winced. “This’ll be the...what...third time we threatened slash accused him of some shit?”
Finally Bucky spoke. “The Starks didn’t lose their son to the war.”
,” Steve said the title with some disgust. “I just want to be a True Hero, someone who can protect the innocent.”
“He does my Lord. And I will also do anything I can to help get Peggy’s soul back.” The friends shared a smile then turned back to the god of the Dead.
3. New Thebe’s City is New York City slapped into Greece, hence why I added “New” onto Thebes. Is this historically/geographically accurate? No. Do I care? No.
“Gladly.” Bucky said through chattering teeth.
The other Avengers were all having dinner and speculating on how the date was going.
“Everyone knows.” Tony explained, trying to not sound completely disappointed in the situation he was now in. “You and the Avengers are sleeping with Thor.”
Fenrir growled at the group but then his ears perked up and he looked off into the distance. But then he turned back and growled at the group again. However, his ears kept moving as if listening for something.
“Tony used to come in and out of there at all hours of the day.” Bruce defended.
Grand pillars surrounded the building. Inside there were several bedrooms, a sizable kitchen and food storage area, a grand washroom, a few bathrooms, a stable like area complete with a running course, and two large sitting rooms. One of which had a huge hole cut out of the ceiling. Originally Tony was sure a dome of some sort was built up on the now sky light but Tony asked the god to keep it open. After all this place would become his home after he earned his freedom, so his input into what he wanted was taken into consideration. And Tony wanted a constant view of the sky, specifically the sun and the stars. He also wanted a small garden like his mother had when he was a child. Hence why in one of the several open courtyard areas of his home, there was a small garden next to a grand, life-size statue of Loki.
Thor had then flown the two to where the others were. After dropping them off, the god then took off to the harbor to wait for them. It had taken some finagling and a lot of Tony distracting the snake, but eventually Steve had managed to tell everyone the plan.
“That your real strength isn’t what came out of the magic Asgardian water
2. I was SO excited to write the confrontation. Let me tell you I had so many versions of this and loved each of them but ultimately I think this is the one that works best for the story and the remainder of the story.
“We’re sorry. We thought this would be the best way to contact you.” He bowed his head “We did not mean to offend you.”
Loki’s mouth parted and he let out small gasps as he and Thor increased the pace.
Howard Stark was a renowned War Hero. He created a multitude of inventions that helped keep the winning edge on their side. But better than that, Howard had a way of knowing the lay of the land. He urged the Grecian armies to keep pressing the enemies back to their own country. Many worried that would give their enemy the advantage but somehow Howard robbed them of their supposed homeland advantage. He could tell where major cities and roads were located and where valleys and rivers were. He helped pick the best places to lay ambushes and fight battles. It was rumoured he may have had divine help guiding him, but Steve liked to think of a more sentimental helper than a random divine.
Steve decided now was as good a time as any to at least clear one part of this mess up. He would let Tony know he never faked his feelings. If Tony faked his...then they can discuss that. But Steve wanted to make sure Tony knew he wasn’t temporary to Steve. So the blonde walked over to the brunette.
“Tony said they swore they haven’t been sleeping with Thor.” At Rhodey’s confused face, Pepper added. “When you were locked out of his room but Jarvis and I could get in, that’s when he told us.” Rhodey nodded but shared an unconvinced look with Loki.
“She blames him for failing and Howard feels guilty for falling for Loki’s tricks.”
“Oh gods.” Natasha muttered in quiet dismay as Steve paled.
“Friends.” Thor said, glancing behind them. “We have once again journeyed too far. We must make our way back to the path.”
Upon discovering this his breathing became worse and he caved into himself more.
The female shade, Pepper, smiled at the ogre then at the Avengers.
When Thor opened his eyes he was in his temple in New Thebes City and in front of him was Tony, and….Steve?
Tony kept studying the blondes face but Steve seemed to be finished explaining. Tony looked away and the brunette’s eyes darted around for some time. Then he looked back determinedly at Steve.
The woman’s -whos form Steve had just corrected- tightened her grip on the practice spear and did the practice jab in the air in front of her.
“Then I accept, I will bring a replacement soul here.” Howard declared as he stood up again.
“Tony.” Firmer this time, Rhodey readjusted himself and pointed across the river.
“You coward!” Rhodes accused Howard. “You’d trade your son for another chance at life and hide it behind that excuse!”
If you haven’t already then I encourage you to go ahead and look at the other fics in this series!
Finally everyone made it to the front of Tony’s house. They knocked a few times but didn’t hear anything. Well most of them didn’t. Steve heard laughter and some nondescript talking coming from the back of the house.
Suddenly Tony realized his mother didn’t actually see him. Well, she saw him but thought him an aberration.
“Wait! I wasn’t done-” But the person had already hurried along, throwing Tony a confused look over their shoulder. “Ooook, that was weird.” But the kid shook it off and ran to greet another person. However he often got the same result. People were standoffish, they didn’t engage in conversation and most started to ignore him.
Steve sucked in a breath. Tony had never told him he loved him, not in words. Steve had known though, it was affirmed through Tony’s actions. But hearing it. Steve couldn’t stop his heart from skipping a beat.
“Do you have any proof?” Bucky quickly threw up his hands. “I believe you! But we can’t exactly go up to a King, in his court, in his country. Tell him he’s a lying jackass and walk away unscathed.”
“Mortal-”
Finally they arrived at the end of the yellow path. They had seen the ferry leave and so they rolled their shoulders and readied themselves to wait. Bucky pocketed the map and then did a small stretch.
“Close enough.” Bucky grumbled but stood up, determined. “I’ll go apologize to him. As I said, I took a lot out on him unfairly. I need to own that.”
once a month. And even then he’d complain it wasn’t enough. But now, nothing! So he must be sleeping with someone and if it's not you then…” Loki glared harder and Amora let out a chuckle. “He went for mortals before. Remember that one accursed female?” Her tone had hardened in anger at the memory.
After Thor had left Hel, Loki had laid down a new rule to Tony and Rhodes. Thor was not to know of Tony living in Hel.
Tony tried to say something but his throat was clogged. He attempted to clear it but instead a rough, poorly hidden, cry escaped. “I...I had to!”
“Hmm I was hoping for something more from you. Especially since you started all this.” She growled “You need to suffer.” She then looked around the circle. When she turned back to Steve the blonde witch had a devious look on her face.
“We…” Steve moaned as Tony nibbled on his earlobe. “We should stop.” He suggested meekly.
“And then Tony here is free as a bird!” Loki announced.
“You are
“I love him.”
The rest then got ready to go their own way towards Jörmungandr. But before Bucky left he turned back to Steve.
“I have.” Howard announced not looking away from the gods gaze.
“It’s one me and Rhodey came up with.” Tony broke in, making sure to catch and hold Steve’s eyes. “I’d explain it but I don’t know if I actually can. It’s weird.”
“I have no idea.” Steve answered but gave the direction Tony walked off to a smile.
Falcon had given the trio a casual smile and wave. Which all of them returned though it was tinged with confusion.
“So he’s human until he becomes angry and then he turns into the green monster, Hulk. General Ross doesn’t want him with his daughter so he’s been painting Bruce as only this great monster.” Steve surmised and Tony nodded at the accuracy.
Sam and Bucky had gestured to their swords earlier and asked Steve if he wanted one or both. But the Punk just gave them a thumbs up and took a dive at the centaur. And now he was doing the same thing.
Steve was on the back of the centaur, riding it like a crazed horse. Tony looked back to the scene and broke into laughter. Steve then yelled something to Bucky and the man jumped into action. He threw a lasso around the centaurs raised back legs and yanked the line taunt.
find.”
Loki had set Tony up in a grand villa that was just outside of New Thebe’s. It was on one of the higher cliff faces overlooking the city and was a bit of distance from the heart of the city. The surrounding trees and nature had originally overtaken the abandoned place but Loki had cleaned it out and made the place livable. Not just livable, but the god had made it into a  grand home; almost a palace in the sense of decorations, upkeep, and the size of the rooms/entryways. But what could they say? Rhodey had to be able to walk through each room, so bigger was better.
The Avengers and Pepper were transported to the edges of the Field of Content Souls. Upon being dropped from the portal everyone looked ready to fight and thus were severely thrown when all that greeted them were baffled souls. Pepper waved the souls away with a quick announcement of official business.
Which was true. Often times the Avengers didn’t actually have to fight monsters anymore. Tony would accompany them and be able to find out what the actual problem was. Not to say Tony could talk down all creatures, and sometimes he gets...too close to them.
“I’m sorry!” Steve rushed, “I’m sorry for tricking you but you weren’t answering and I could hear you breathing.”
“Words are fanciful, but mortals often lie.” Loki said a neutral tone, which did nothing to curb the Avengers or Thor’s anger at the blue god. “Would you swear that?” He asked and Steve raised an eyebrow. “Would you swear on your very soul that you will not bind Anthony to you?”
The next day they all said farewell and went back to the US on Tony’s jet, with Tony and Steve sitting side by side and their hands intertwined.
Loki sent a barrage of icicles at the blonde god. “You’d throw that back at my face?!”
Everyone glared at the god.
Tony had a bow in his hand and some arrows in a case tied around his waist. The man was running and didn’t stop until he was between the Avengers and Fenrir.
“We do.” Steve told her then took another sip of his water. “He helped in our training.”
Loki grimaced at that thought. Hel was finally working smoothly and at a point where he was rarely, if ever, bothered and that was due to all the employees he now had.
Loki barked an ugly laugh, “Wow you truly do believe that to be the honest truth don’t you?” Loki asked Howard harshly, “You honestly believe all hope would be lost without you.”
“Wait, Tony, Tony?” Bruce inquired.
Bucky and Sam glared at the shorter man.
While Howard stubbled and tried to reorient himself Loki summoned his Scepter of the Dead. The Scepter of the Dead had a gold staff with silver blades sprouting from the top, where the gold staff stopped and what the silver blades surrounded was a glowing blue orb.
“I need you to go to the Land of the Living and kill some mortals for me.” Fenrir began to look excited, his tail going wild. Loki quickly pet his head and brought the wolf’s attention back to him. “But! You aren’t to harm Tony.”
“I agree!” Thor boomed, gesturing at the three mortals with his drink. “It is time you put your skills to use. Prove you are a True Hero Steve!” He banged on his chest right over where his heart was.
“This will work great-”
Finally, Maria meme’s to nourish the soul and rejuvenate the skin!
“Not as busy as you Cap.” Tony stopped in front of the blonde “You guys have been running all around Greece, even working on your days off.” He tilted his head towards the door indicating the group of people who had just left. Steve looked bashful and rubbed the back of his head as Tony smirked at him again. “The Asgardian sized popularity makes perfect sense though. Especially if you guys always offer spa sessions with your fans.”
Loki’s eyebrows flew up and he couldn’t stop the look of surprise from overtaking his face. However he quickly tried to school his features back into something more neutral. Steve took advantage of the moment and walked up besides Pepper.
“Tony?” Steve called from outside the brunette’s door. “Tony are you in there?” Silence answered him.
“NO!” Steve fired back. “It was the map!” He waved the map in front of himself. “All he had to do was hand this off and it would have been the same result!”
“I don’t want to.” Steve admitted hesitantly, “But I don’t want to let the people down.”
“Such a busy bee.” Tony teased and Rhodey snorted then swatted Tony’s face.
Rhodey had the day off and since Thor arrived today, Tony’s time off had just started so they decided to go off and explore some of Hel. They went to the top of an outcropping that overlooked the river Styx. They had been here often enough, but after 10 years in Hel it was hard to find a section they hadn’t at least been near. Plus this was a nice spot to see the incoming shades. The most recent batch had just loaded onto the ferry and were being carried across the river.
“Um….I think he does research.” Bruce answered scrunching up his face as he thought about it. “I’ve seen him go up and talk with Monsters and then he just walks off. I mean even with me he just came up to me one day and asked what I was doing there and when I told him about the hulk he asked me all these follow up questions.” He shrugged, “I think he’s gathering and compiling a bunch of information about the monsters of our world. He always had a lot of fun facts about my...uh...neighbors.”
1. Peggy is an amazing character, said it once and I’ll say it again. :D
“I have a whole army to help me.” He gestured to the others. Peggy laughed and then turned back to Steve.
! I haven’t made any deals with any mortals!” He then turned and pointed out towards the hallway. “And because of that, Steve tore Thor’s gaze from me! I told Thor I was angry with those mortals and he
they think it’ll help them get a spot in “Valhalla”.” Tony psh-ed and rolled his eyes at the last word.
“I’m sorry about your intended.” She whispered as she squeezed the small blonde.
“You scared me!” Tony gasped, clutching his chest.
Tony looked surprised and had to visibly shake himself. But when he went to say something Bucky cut him off.
“Buddy, you didn’t fail anyone. These things happen, there’s nothing-”
“I don’t think your crew likes me.” Tony fake whispered and Natasha sent him a withering look while Bucky glared.
“Yeah but at the same time we should at least know of him. Or have heard about him. When you live here your whole life, it stops being such a big city.”
“Loki? Ah, Oh!” Thor had just opened the door to Loki’s study and found the horned god in nothing but his small cloths.
Everyone’s eyes swiveled over to him. He was standing away from the group and further up the road towards Thor’s temple.
Then another arrow flew over them. It once again caught Fenrir's attention. The wolf’s ears then perked up again and he began prancing in place. The Avengers then heard something. It sounded like whistling. Another flaming arrow flew and Fenrir now yipped in excitement.
“Dad please! Please! I wanna go home!” Tony begged, crying and trying to latch onto Howard. Howard gave a choked sob and grabbed Tony in for a tight hug. Tony then began to relax but immediately stiffened as Howard began prying his hands and arms off himself. “Dad? DAD!” Howard was mummering apologies as he continued to pry Tony off himself. “DAD PLEASE!”
“Steve said they were just hanging out.” Bruce offered as a weak defense.
Bruce smiled and shrugged, “Eh, we hermits flock to each other.”
“Tony this is the Monster Bog,” Sam stressed “Any human that steps foot in here, usually dies in here.”
“Here!” Steve pushed the cape onto Tony. “It looks like you won’t be able to get that to work. So please use this.”
“Not a chance.” The blonde answered as he surged forward and pulled Tony into his lap.
“I don’t think the night was ruined.” Steve smiled shyly “I had a great time with you.”
“Hello to you to.” Tony said sarcastically, which only got him a stern look. “Look,” He began gently “they’re mortal.” Loki’s eyes drew into a glare and Tony began talking faster in order to try and get his point out as quickly as possible. “I know you’re mad. But they’re just trying to show off. Doing the normal hero shtick in order to gain his favor.” Loki growled and Tony rushed out “But they are mortal. Just wait and they’ll die and he’ll come back-”
“Hurts doesn’t it?!” Loki snarled at the group. “Don’t worry, worse pain is coming for you.” With that the god vanished.
“I can’t believe these humans.” Amora scoffed as another round of cheers was let out by the crowd.
“Steve!” Clint repeated and pitched his body closer.
“Very well.” Loki agreed holding out his hand. “You will now work for me, and for as long as Anthony’s in the underworld you may guard and protect him.”
“If you let him go be a kid and let his energy out, shit like this wouldn’t happen.”
All eyes turned to the green ball and Tony groaned in dismay knowing it was Loki summoning him. Pepper and Jarvis gave him sympathetic looks and Rhodey gave his shoulder a firm squeeze.
“My fellow Athenians! We are here to commemorate and honor these marvelous heroes the Avengers!” The speaker at the podium gestured to the heroes behind him and the assembled crowd let out a raucous round of applause. The speaker then gestured for them to settle down and continued.  “It is thanks to them we will no longer have to worry about the barbarians that have been threatening our walls for the past year!” Another round of cheers, “And not only did they save us from this threat, but on their way here they slayed a giant on the northern road!” The crowd let out more cheers and applause till the speaker hushed them again. “And so we will commemorate the Avengers by adding them to our city.”
“What?” Steve asked, pulling away from the brunette but not letting go of his hands.
Bucky took a quick nap while the others enjoyed some food and drinks. Tony tentatively showed them a few other rooms but mostly everyone stayed in the skylight room. Once it started getting dark, Natasha woke Bucky up and ushered all the Avengers to leave. Steve stayed back as everyone filed out the front door.
“Me and Phil have-” Clint began.
“I have a theory.” Clint put in. “It looks like his work stuff was gone from his house. So my theory is he went to Monster Bog,” Bruce and Thor opened their mouths but Clint held up a hand. “But didn’t make it there.”
“Yes! Loki owned me!”
Time heals all wounds but no one ever said time healed them quickly. A year later, Tony could look back at the Civil War and see all the signs he missed in his blissful state that something was wrong. He regretted never asking Steve about it.
Pepper nodded and all the previously alarmed Avengers calm down at Happy’s explanation.
“It’s Loki’s birthright anyway.”
Clint got thrown in a dumpster. Loki had some muscles in that lanky frame and he used them to throw the only one who managed to track him down into a dumpster. Tony hailed the three of them a cab and threw money at the driver so he would step on it. Steve sprung out of the car and grabbed Loki who thrashed like a cornered Tiger. Everyone converged on that location.
“It is time for you to beat up all the bullies.” He laughed gesturing to Steve who also chuckled.
“Now they’re ripe for the killing!” Amora giggled.
Loki pondered, mentally creating a list of candidates he would try to reach out to.
for how he feels?! They are nothing to you and I!” Loki grabbed the front of Thor’s armor and jostled it, trying to shake the blonde.
Howard had agreed to a quick lunch at home and then they’d be off. Maria saw them off with a tight hug and kiss to Howard and an even tighter hug and multiple kisses to her son Tony.
“Betty! I would never-!” Bruce immediately began but Betty waved him off with an easy smile.
“Amora don’t do this!” Tony begged and tried to pull free again.
“You have to do this Tony! I have to do this! I. Am. Needed!”
“Well I don’t know who you heard that from, but I
“Amora mentioned him being Loki’s slave.” Clint added.
Tony wasn’t there. But everyone else was and no one had seen or heard of anyone seeing him. Phil even reported that none of their rival heroes have been spotted in the area.
“Woah! That’s a first.” Steve joked but Bucky didn’t join in on his laughter. “Buck-”
“Okay. Alright. You’re right.”  Steve placated gently as he tried to get Tony to look at him. “It’s not ok, but you’re here. You’re safe. You’re right here. It’s just us.” He said as he rubbed the brunette’s tense and trembling back in soothing circles.
“There’s a good boy!” Loki praised. The god then grabbed both sides of Fenrir’s face and looked his pet in the eyes.
“He broke our promise!” Loki yelled, bracing his hands on the armrests. “I will not welcome him back! I will make him suffer! And I will make them suffer!
“You’ve just admitted that you’re having a hard time killing us.” Natasha remarked with a smirk.
Green mist covered Tony’s mouth preventing him from speaking and chains suddenly wrapped around Tony’s body. Tony tipped forward and as Steve reached him, the man disappeared.
“Tony!” Steve shouted in excitement.
“Exactly.” Erskine answered with a patient smile then glanced at the horizon where the mist was still moving and turning, obscuring the view of the mainland. “No mortals are to know of me. So the mists from Odin hide me from their sight unless I otherwise wish it.”
“Really? You didn’t listen to me when I was alive and you’re still going to deny me, even though I’m dead?”
A week later he had appeared back at the island, covered in frostbite and bandages. At everyone's concerned and confused faces the god shrugged and gave a strained smile.
Tony felt the room’s temperature increase a fraction and smiled. “Yup! A new ferry capable of carrying twice the amount of shades across Styx in half the time. Done, tested, and implemented.”
“Don’t you have to be annoying somewhere else?” Amora questioned.
Tony flinched and hunched into himself.
“Engage him in stories of your valor.” Thor suggested
The formal air quickly dropped and the god put on a confused face, one eyebrow raising and lifting one hand up in a confused manner.
“If you ever need to talk about this stuff again Steve, I’m here for you.” Sam assured quietly. “If you ever need to vent or help figuring things out, just let me know.” Steve smiled and clapped the dark skinned man on the back.
“You say he’s a True Hero?” Loki didn’t wait for Tony’s confirmation, “I’ll take your word for it. I won’t even wait for Odin to sanctify it. I’ll call him a True Hero and give him exactly what he came to Hel for.”
“You have to impress him Steve.” Bucky urged. “You know why I had a fan club back home? Because I impressed them with my fighting skills.”
Finally Steve and Bucky felt ready to begin their training but Erskine put them off, giving excuse after excuse till the whole day was wasted. He then repeated this the next day and the day after that. On that third day Bucky finally snapped at the man.
“Steve, listen to me.” Tony clapped his hands together and the 5 jumped at the loud noise.
“Mortal!” Loki boomed, gaining the restless's shade’s attention. “You have died. You are now in my realm of Hel. You must accept that your living life is over. However you may find peace in your afterlife, if you accept it. If you do not then you may find more horrors here than in the living world.”
“Tony’s been working for me the entire time.”
“Relax Thor.”
The Avengers laughed or at least looked amused as Thor dragged a still startled looking Tony over to the table.
“I said no!” Amora shouted, splaying her arms out and putting all her concentration into keeping Steve still.
“You’re a blessing I don’t deserve.”  Rhodey deadpanned and Tony shoved him lightly.
After some time, the chains on Rhodes and magic over his mouth disappeared with a wave of Loki’s hand as the god returned to his throne. Rhodes made to open his mouth but Loki beat him to the punch.
“Howard!” The older man retorted already turning back to his current project.
“You could have told me I was temporary.” Tony added as he marched forward.
His shield was strapped to the back of his warriors dress, overtop his blue cape. Bucky looked like a walking weapons depot. Like Sam, Bucky didn’t have a cape (“Gets in the way of grabbing my weapons”).  He had spears strapped to his back, a sword on his hip, steel bracers on each arm, a dagger on the other side of his hip and another dagger his ankle. He also had his satchel of backup items tied around his waist. Meanwhile, Sam had his bow, a closed case of arrows, and a sword on his hip.
“It all makes sense now!” Bucky exclaimed as they walked.
Later Maria woke Tony up and they had exactly what Howard said, a nice family breakfast. After breakfast Howard told Tony he’d be coming with him to help out in the war. Tony had been ecstatic. He was still so young and sheltered, he didn’t know the true tragedy of war. He was merely excited to help his father and country in the only way he knew how. He raced to his room and asked his mom to help him pack all his notes and plans that he had already written up.
The next day Tony was pleasantly sore and Steve was super attentive and supportive. The brunette made sure to show his appreciation in the bath by giving Steve a blow job. Tony had learned many tricks from the incubuses he slept with in Hel. However, Steve had been fantastic and put the memory of the past incubuses to shame.
“YOU AREN’T INVOLVED IN THIS!” Howard yelled back.
“Sure, I give it-” Loki began but cut himself off as he watched Steve pick up a large boulder and chuck it at the Hydra’s head, hard enough to daze the creature.
“I saw Loki!” Bucky gasped out as he tried to soothe his throbbing head. “Him and Tony were talking. Talking about you Steve. Ugh!” Bruce instructed Bucky to sit on the ground while everyone shared puzzled looks.
Tony had walked around Hel with Loki, talking and catching up on things. It wasn’t the first time Loki and Tony had spoken and it wouldn’t be the last. Sometimes Tony would wake up to Loki in his kitchen, stealing his food for no other reason than to annoy him. Other times the Avengers would walk in on Thor and Loki going at it in one of the rooms.
“It was more than a few seconds.” Loki scolded playfully but Tony and Amora didn’t look anymore convinced. “Odin and Thor will never suspect you because they don’t even know about you.” He explained and Tony began shaking his head in the negative.
Steve squared his shoulders and jutted out his chin. “Anything!”
“This is how you knew.” Steve stated, not posing it as a question. “This is what you used to plan for battle and how you knew the enemies terrain.”
“In deference to my guest I will give you one last chance to change this Howard Stark. You will walk out of Hel, and after you walk past my throne room’s entryway, if you at anytime wish to change this, all you have to do is look back. If you do, Anthony will be transported home with no memory of this and you will take your place in Hel as one of the dead.” Loki then pushed a hand towards Rhodes and chains came up from the ground locking the centaur in place and green mist prevented him from speaking.
And so the next day, the main hall had a spread of food and drinks out. There was also an excess of pillows and cushions in the room. The couches and chairs were arranged nicely around other side tables which had some dice and other games littered across them. Thor was abuzz with excitement, sparkles shot off from his shoulders and fingertips and zapped a few of the Avengers.
“So we haven’t seen you before.” Steve broached, “have you been, uh...out of town?”
Bucky’s mouth hung open in astonishment while Steve’s eyes took on a calculating edge.
“Bucky enough!” Bruce cut in, stepping pointedly between him and Tony. “You have a minor concussion, you need rest.”
“You have three days to bring either your wife or child to me. If you do not return, or have not even stepped foot into Hel, then on the sunset of the third day your soul will automatically be returned to me.” With that Loki thrusted the Scepter into Howard.
Steve looked aghast and Sam glared at the shorter blonde.
“He was using you. A temporary toy before he could reclaim his true love.” Tony ducked his head at that. “Don’t let him win.” Loki advised moving into arms reach. “Don’t let another mortal use you like your father did.” Tony flinched.
Eventually a loud and eerie howl was heard throughout the loud and bustling city. As the howl went on the city quieted down and people stopped in place. Citizens began looking around and the ones near the Avengers cowered and clung to their heroes.
He severely doubted Loki had any dealings with Tony. How would he even be in contact with a living mortal when work kept him busy and tied up in Hel? Tony could have his mind muddled with Loki’s magic but no, Tony seemed clear when Thor had examined him during his hug. He had been sure to take the brunette by surprise and hence why he rushed the man upon their arrival. He knew Loki’s magic was most vulnerable and easy to detect when his targets/victims/participants were off guard. The magic always shone through in those moments, but Tony had none. And the statue appeared to be just a statue so it must have all been in Bucky’s head.
“I thought I heard him.” Bucky admitted into the silence. “I swore I heard Loki, but….” He let out a sigh.
“I’ve never heard of the Jarvis family.” Clint said with an eyebrow raised.
“Tony.”
She then turned to Sam. “Have you slept or had any sexual relations of any kind with Thor?”
Tony now appeared in a kneeling position in the seating area of the Arena. He was still chained and unable to speak. Tony’s eyes darted around before glaring at Loki and then giving the Avengers a sad and panicked look.
“You better come back to me.” She demanded with a hard swallow.
The press had a field month. Tony rarely left his lab. Steve bought a treadmill since he couldn’t go outside without getting flooded by cameras.
“You should be apologizing to Tony not us.” Bruce said lastly.
1. More hints into Thor and Loki’s backstory. Get ready cause
3. Also do you see the parallels? I couldn’t think of a way to make Tony really good with weapon building and stuff in an Ancient Greece setting. So that transitioned into he’s really good with Monsters and dangerous creatures (I tried hinting at this in chap 4).
“Yes as I was saying.” Pepper jumped back to her original train of thought. “Happy saw you all go into the Mists over and over. He tried to call out to you but by the time he was close enough you were in too deep…” Pepper seemed to take a moment to really think over her next few words. “He sent a message to come and assist you. I was allowed to come.”
“I swear Ty put me down or I’ll-” Tony declared finishing his threat by jabbing a leg into Ty’s chest.
Then his glare and cold look melted away for just a second to reveal a very hurt and betrayed face. Steve’s eyes immediately softened and he made to say something. But Tony swallowed down the tears and sadness that wanted to come out.
“Everyone get to the shelters!” Steve ordered and then the other Avengers followed suit in telling the citizens to take cover.
Also, Happy 2020! Now let's continue onwards with the story! :D
“Yeah it’s begging people to challenge you.” Clint agreed.
“Oh here we go.” Rhodey groaned, rubbing his forehead.
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked his eyes already looking Tony over for any injuries or sign of a fight/struggle.
I'm sorry! I had every intention of posting this earlier. But I had to work overtime everyday this past week and so Saturday was my catch up on errands day. So unfortunately that meant an other late upload. I didn't even do a final read through so I hope it's ok, but I've run out of free time and just want to nap.
Pepper let out a sigh as she watched the shivering Avengers enter the Palace. This would not be fun for any of them.
They all made it back to Tony’s front door in no time. Then Bucky barreled in, throwing open the front door and running towards the garden area he saw Lord Loki and Tony in just a few minutes ago. Everyone followed after him, Natasha and Clint even had their weapons out on the off chance Bucky was correct about a threat.
“I will go to the other gods, I will not let this stand.” Rhodes continued, and Loki turned his harsh glare to the centaur.
intervened, Junior.” Tony shot back playfully.
“You might have to walk me through that.” Steve advised and Tony gave him a devilish smile as he sat back down on the blonde’s lap.
“I’m home!” Steve called, as he entered the Barnes residence.
Afterwards they stayed like that. Foreheads pressed together, eyes closed and their bodies shaking as they came down from their high. Eventually Steve’s erection subsided and became soft inside the brunette. Tony moved his hips a bit and some of the blonde’s cum drained out of him.
It had been about a week since the statue unveiling and everything seemed to be back to normal.
“My problem was with you but I took it out on Tony.” Bucky emerged in a clean, dark blue skirt. “I owe him an apology for that ...and a few other things as well.”
“What?” Tony sounded genuinely confused and Natasha pushed Clint behind her.
“Probably.” Bucky answered before finishing his water.
“Under the ritual table!” Loki then dragged the boy towards aforementioned table.
Everyone took on an expression of panic but Steve kept up his look of defiance. Tony, meanwhile, was grunting and pulling with all his might and trying to quell the panic and urge to cry that was clawing at him.
“No, it’s exactly how we left it. And we checked every room.” Steve explained.
Meanwhile Steve looked from his friends to the two mercenaries, and then to the bodies around them. The two were obviously skilled and Steve couldn’t tell what weapons the woman carried but he knew she at least had to have a dagger or two on her person. The fact that he couldn’t even see those, however, made him question what other weapons she had concealed.
“Wish I could offer some advice, but as you know. I’m not in good standing with my partner's parents either.”
“Yeah.” Steve agreed, he then glanced behind them. “Maybe we should go back and check to see if Tony’s alright?”
“Is she dead?” Bucky questioned concerned, as they all crowded around the fallen woman.
“Don’t. Finish. That. Sentence!” Loki jabbed an angry finger at the blonde as his eyes turned red. “I am going to kill those mortals!”
“Oh gods!” Steve cried catching Nat as she fell backwards. “I’m so sorry I didn’t mean for that to happen.”
“I never slept with Thor!”
“Did you see who it was? If it was that Steve Rogers then that would be perfect.” Loki got a far off look in his eyes as he let his imagination roam. “Most of the monsters are at least partially loyal to you. You could direct them to him and then…” Loki trailed off into a manic giggle, lost to his imagination.
“So he now wants us to kill the Minotaur?” Bucky asked.
“Steve, Steve Rogers!”
Howard licked his lips and gave his head a small shake. “You heard him the other day. His ideas, we can expand on that.” Maria shook her head still against the idea. “Maria, I
“Tony dead mortals from all walks of life gather in this realm. You have a world of knowledge at your feet. How can you possibly be bored when you have yet to even explore that!”
“Not over a decade Thor!” Loki shot back, folding his arms over his chest. “Only 8 and a half, 9 years at most.”
“I don’t want to.”
“The bitch is right.” Tony cut in, not wanting to hear anymore from Amora. Amora glared at him but Tony kept talking. “I can’t handle people. I can handle any creature, any monster, anything like that. But I am NOT good with people.” Loki still looked unconvinced so Tony threw an arm out to Amora. “She’s better equipped for this.”
“Let’s go have a drink.” He gestured to the inside of his house with his thumb.
“We’re sure as shit not helping!” Clint shot back. “We’re supposed to be heroes!”
“Tony.” Loki said in his serious tone.
However, Tony wasn’t the only one who had a difficult time accepting the new normality. Throughout the first year Loki himself seemed to forget Tony’s existence, and when reminded seemed at odds with what to do with him. That whole year Tony was a crying, nervous, mess of a child. So, whenever Loki stumbled upon him, he often just sent him away or gave him some menial task so he’d be out of the gods sight. Which mainly comprised of taking care of Loki’s favorite pets (Jörmungandr and Fenrir).
“Please leave.”
During the walk back home, Bucky had kept his head down and moved briskly. No one tried to make conversation, instead they traveled in silence. After they arrived home, Bucky made a beeline for his room, Steve following the whole time.
Tony had almost broke down but held fast. Though he did readily jump into the hug Steve offered. The blonde then soothed his lover. Telling him he wasn’t mad that Tony was having a hard time adjusting and would need some time. He did reprimand the brunette though. Saying he needed to tell him when he was having a hard time with things.
“You’re wrong you know.” Tony said.
“Oooh!” Ty cheered, then yanked Tony closer “I like ‘em fiery!” Steve let out another growl and the branch he was holding snapped in his hand.
“Well!” Amora snapped. “Move it!”
“I don’t think you understand what you’re denying yourself.” The centaur then proceeded to flex and the brunette -Tony- made a retching sound and motion.
Steve was about to compliment him. He wanted to thank Tony, praise him actually. For the man’s intervention, for his speech, for helping Steve really see what was necessary. But he didn’t get the chance, Tony beat him to it.
“It’s the safest for Asterion and that’s what matters most.” Bucky finished. “Otherwise we’d be accusing Minos with no solid proof and Minos would just get someone else to kill him.”
Leaving Amora and Rhodey to stare at the space he previously occupied. Inside Tony’s room, Pepper, Jarvis and Tony jolted and startled when Loki suddenly appeared at the end of the bed.
“You were grieving man.” Sam comforted.
“Don’t do this Tony. Don’t fall for this again.” Loki said in a pleading tone, and that set Tony’s anger off.
“A weirdass one.”
“Aw poor Buckaroo” Tony mocked and Sam had to cough to cover his laugh. “So what? Are you going to threaten me again if I don’t spill my whole life story to you?”  Tony asked inclining his head towards Natasha and Bucky.
“I don’t,” The brunette stopped and took a breath to try and compose himself. Steve then put a hand to Tony’s cheek and the brunette’s breath stuttered as their eyes locked again. Steve gave Tony an imploring and questioning look which made Tony’s heart clenched.
“Ah! So, no spa session?”
“What?” Bucky eventually asked when the older man failed to elaborate.
3. I've started writing the backstory for Thor and Loki and I'm loving it! It's going to be 10 chapters long and will be like a prequel to this, while also having snippets of Tony growing up with Loki.
“And Odin would be sure to punish you.” Amora added.
“Odin!” Frigga reprimanded firmly.
“Let him go.” The god advised. “He must be embarrassed. Give him tonight and then go after him.”
Steve sat up and waited for Bucky to come out from behind his changing curtain.
Tony took an audible gulp and that seemed to be all the confirmation Loki needed. Loki’s eyes widened in horror as his mouth fell open and his arm dropped. “Tony!”
“Nay! It’s the whole package.” The blonde grinned and Bucky shook his head emphatically.
interested!” He was now in the garden with the Avengers. “I was talking out loud about how to get him to like me!” Steve flushed and the others winced at the chariot-wreck that was this confrontation. “But apparently in your concussed mind that’s me hunting him!”
They continued to fight verbally till the words got so heated that they turned to fighting physically.  They had brawled for a bit, all the while Loki would continue to throw poisonous words at Thor.
“I don’t have to look at all and you can wander Hel looking for one shade. How does that sound?” Loki snarled back.
“That way!” Sam directed then he and Bucky dashed into the forest to follow their friend.
“Really?” She gasped happily.
“Steve? What has happened to you?” Thor asked, looking over his friend who looked as if he had never drank the water of Asgard.
Tony’s eyes widened as his brain temporarily shut down and all the blood drained from his face. He had said that out loud?!
Tony had tried behind the curtains but Loki pulled him away as his feet were still visible.
However, as Loki rolled his eyes he spotted something coming closer to the main entrance. Tony was telling Thor that he was fine when a portal opened beneath the shade, causing him to fall in.
“I..I-I...I gotta go!” He finally got out as he ran towards the exit.
As Rhodey talked about everything going on in Hel. The thought that kept running through Tony’s head was ‘
When complaining to Loki about his lack of entertainment. Loki had scoffed at him.
“I miss her!” Steve sobbed. “I need to be with her.”
Finally he had all the runes written out. He then slammed both hands, palms down, into the table and infused it with magic. The runes lit up and then the table's surface began to show the image of what was currently happening to Tony.
“But I would have seen him. How did I not see him?” At everyones curious looks Thor elaborated. “This is the longest I haven’t visited Hel. I usually came here once a month before I met you all.”
Steve and him had gone out on more romantic outings. The Avengers bemoaned that they were still an obnoxious couple. At first Tony seemed to have a hard time undressing in front of Steve, conscious of his scars. Steve had pointed out a few he had littered across his own body. But he would always let Tony set the pace. If Tony wanted to wear a covering during their love-making then he could. More often than not Steve would lavish the front and back scars with attention. Mummering words of love the whole while.
“I’d hold the position open until you are able to find a replacement, if that’s the only hold up.” Loki bargained from his seat on the throne.
“By the gods you are amazing.” Steve panted as his hands explored Tony’s lean and slightly muscular back.
“WHAT?!” Thor screamed but Tony ignored him and kept talking.
Tony grimaced and gave his friend an ‘are you kidding me’ look. Happy shrugged and let out an awkward laugh.
“I will tell Odin of this. He will rectify this and save-”
“Yeah! We could have handled that without you two.” Bucky’s hands also went towards his weapons.
Fenrir appeared confused by that command. He would never hurt his playmate.
“Hey! We’re walking here!” Bucky yelled back, shaking his fist at the retreating man’s back.
Tony had stayed back as the Avengers went into hero mode, so he was just outside the circle.  But something nagged at the back of his brain. As he watched her look into everyone's eyes it hit him.
“Steve you know she doesn’t want you to get sick.”
Loki and Amora scoffed at the idea and Loki stormed over towards the balcony but Tony followed him.
“I’ll come back tomorrow. I just want to know your ok.” Steve voiced loudly.
Everyone slowly and guiltily filed out of the garden and out of the house. Outside, Steve turned and opened his mouth to say something but Tony closed the door in his face.
“Yes I-”
“Yes.” Steve smiled.
Steve startled and looked at him with a growing smile. Erskine glanced over at the small man and gave a small smile.
“I left my weapons.” Bucky groaned, clearly annoyed at himself.
Everyone let out a gasp of fear as the wolf grew incredibly large. Buildings began to crack and shake as some of the wolfs limbs pushed against them. Then before anyone could do anything else. Fenrir swooped his massive head down and opened his mouth in front of Tony.
“Because he told me and he lives here.” He gestures around them. “Like you said this isn't a very welcoming place for people.”
Steve hit it off right away with Happy Hogan, Pepper Potts, Bruce Banner, and Janet Van Dyne. James Rhodes took a bit more time to warm up to Steve. Rhodey has always been protective of Tony and he could probably already see what Tony himself was denying at this point; therefore he was hesitant to give an instant welcome to the guy Rhodey knew Tony would eventually give his heart to. However, Steve did eventually gain Rhodey’s approval and friendship.
Bucky made to chase after him but Sam held him back. “Hold on! We can be the surprise backup that he may need. Let’s just stay hidden.”
Loki looked the image of the Avengers over then snarled again and broke the pot with his bare hands. He then began destroying more and more of the pots and plates. Tony let out a heavy breath through his mouth, glanced back at the Avengers who looked to be giving their own speech now and rolled his eyes. He then turned to Loki and shook his head at the god as he frosted over a plate.
“It only carries one at a time and you are no longer allowed to talk about it.” Natasha barked and Clint pouted.
“Ste-eve…”  Sam’s voice broke as he also cried. But the blonde just continued to cling to Tony and chant pleas for him to be alive.
Tony looked into the alcove and saw her. She was the only woman in the area and appeared to be praying over a candle she had just lit. Her back was to him, but Tony knew it was her. Steve squeezed Tony’s hands in order to get his attention.
Sometimes Tony would come over and all the heroes would be in training. They expressed their apologies but Tony always waved them off, then he’d sit down and watch them all train. Betty would sit with him sometimes. However, she would eventually leave as she found watching them all go through their individual fighting skills dull. Tony, however, always seemed to enjoy it as he would watch them all with rapt attention.
“Please you have to go help them!” A familiar voice pleaded.
“Buck,” Sam reached for his sword but Bucky flinched away.
At the sight and sound of that, Steve’s dick began to grow hard again while still inside Tony. Tony gasped at the feeling and gave Steve a shocked look.
Meanwhile Tony and Steve had hit their 6-month mark and thus started to hit some rocks.
” He bared his teeth at Thor. “You shouldn’t have power here! This is not your place to control
“You want to become a True Hero to get your love back, yes?” Steve nodded his assent. “And then what? You have all this power and the girl, what will you do then?”
Tony thought suddenly feeling like he could get himself out of this feelings mess. He just had to keep reminding himself that Steve and all the Avengers were sleeping with Thor. This had all started because they seduced Thor away from Loki.
“THANK YOU!” Steve yelled, waving both his arms towards the shade.
“Really Thor? It wasn’t that bad.” Thor made a noise of disagreement as he walked into the room. “Just a few years of research. I recall your chambers would be left a pig-sty for decade upon decade.”
Tony meanwhile had run as fast as he could back to his home. Once he was safely inside he began pacing and yanking on his hair.
“WHAT?!” Bucky cut in, he threw a look to Bruce who cringed and averted his face guiltily.
“What do you think I did all that time in Hel?”
3. Thor is like a big puppy in this chapter, sorry not sorry.
Tony waited a good five minutes before opening the door and checking the Avengers had left. He then crept over to the cliff side and peaked over to verify they were walking away.
“Oh boy.” Bruce muttered.
Natasha eventually appeared next to Steve and wrapped the blonde in a hug, encompassing both the blonde and Tony.
“You need to either back away or explain yourself.” She threatened, brandishing her dagger at Tony.
“A magic map.” Howard breathed.
“Yeah normally it’s easier to take the back way and just go through the woods back to the city gates. But I’m thinking of installing some kind of pulley system in order to get up and down easier.” Tony explained, then glanced back at Steve. “But look at you, you don’t even look a bit winded.”
“Mortal time is fleeting bu-”
“Look who’s finally back!”
“I know buddy.” Tony said calmly. “I’m guessing Loki told you to come attack them?” Fenrir growled at the heroes in response but Tony tsk-ed and got the wolf’s full attention. “We’re not going to do that.” Fenrir let out a whine and Tony held up a finger sternly. “I mean it. No! No more attacking my friends.”
Tony gestured his head to everyone; whom at this point, had just been watching Amora and Tony interact with varying expressions filtering across their faces. Amora quickly scanned the group and raised an eyebrow.
“Ah, it’s...it won’t even get to that Steve. Jörmungandr may not love me like Fenrir, but I know he at least likes me….well,” Tony tilted his head “To be fair I know he at least tolerates me. But! That’s more than most can say.”
3. Hope you all enjoyed my made up set up of Jotens and Asgardian gods. If it seems awfully one-sided maybe that’s cause the victor’s are the ones who write the history books and Odin won. So *wink wink nudge nudge* Also if you couldn’t tell Loki’s daddy issues are really tied into this story. But that’s a story for a different posting (which I am working on currently!).
Everyone then slipped into silence till they walked out of the Mist. Once out, everyone (sans Thor) felt a huge wave of exhaustion come over them.
“Mama I’m real!” Tony shouted and he winced when he heard his voice bounce back to him. He hadn’t meant to actually shout but it seemed his voice was either too quiet or too loud.
Tony seemed to instantly brighten and bolted upright, causing Steve to startle.
“Oh my gods!” Tony gasped.
Steve then hoisted Tony up into his arms and climbed onto the horse with Natasha’s assistance. He then urged the horse into a gallop and ran them down to a deserted part of the beach.
Loki thought after his examination.
The cloth was pulled off to reveal a statue of Howard Stark, posing regally and pointing with one hand towards the Harbor. At his feet were the words “Never look back, only forward!”. The crowd and Avengers all clapped and shouted their appreciation but Tony couldn’t hear them anymore.
“NO!” Steve shouted as he stood. He couldn’t breath. “No no no no. I can’t. I CAN’T!” He sat back down and put his head in between his knees. “I….” After his breathing was under control he looked up. Silence. Horror, sympathy, and rage was on a variety of peoples faces. He couldn’t look at Tony, but from his stiff legs and still hands, Steve knew. “I’m sorry….Tony, I’m SO so sorry…I…”
“I just beat them to the punch. Given time they would have done something asshole-ish as well.”
“I don’t…
“I see more shades approaching. Let’s talk in Happy’s quarters while they come aboard.”
Tony meanwhile had released the horses Steve and Natasha had left him with. He then watched as the 5 tried to usher Amora’s duplicates towards the crowd of people in order to get medical assistance. The lithe brunette tugged on the cape around his neck and grimaced.
The god thought.
“This is perfect!” Amora cheered.
“Mistakes happen.”
work on that.” Tony gave a mock disapproving frown and finger wag.
doing here?” Bucky asked harshly.
“There!” Bucky pointed high up across the river at a four-legged creature which the voice seemed to be coming from.
“Are you trying to get us killed?!” Bucky accused as he ducked low and swept their surroundings for any monsters that could come charge at them.
“Phil,” Steve then took on a more gentle tone “Betty,” Betty looked at him and bit her lip. Steve gave her a reassuring smile “I need you two to go to Nick Fury. Brief him of the situation and help him get the civilians into shelters.”
“Same.”  Sam added, leaning on Bucky’s shoulder for a moment.
3. So I know exactly what Thor was doing but couldn’t figure out how to write it seamlessly into the chapter, hence the add on at the end. I will never accept the idea of Thor being oblivious stupid. The guys old as hell, he’s gathered a shit ton of knowledge in his lifetime. But he’s a strategist, and was raised by Frigga. You’ll always learn more and have an edge if people underestimate you.
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!
“...Are you seriously not putting these dots together?” Tony asked as if she was an idiot. Amora glared at him and put her hands on her hips. Tony let out an exaggerated puff of air. “Oh Amora…”
“Well he’s not staying dead.” Bucky said sternly, getting Steve’s attention. “You can set the record straight as soon as we see him.” Steve nodded and then accepted his best friends half embrace.
Tony then broke out into another fit of laughter. “Marries you?!”
At that Steve’s shy smile dropped and he studied the ground with an intense, stormy look in his eyes.
“I...know.” Loki moaned.
“I can stay and help? You won’t even have to pay me overtime.”
The group continued to bicker and talk till they approached the Monster Bog. Then they got more in the battle ready mindset. They grouped up and slowly waded through the fog filled swamp. They travelled silently and only communicated via whispers or hand signals. Each carried a torch but they all knew only to light the torches when absolutely necessary.
“This is very fragile, please handle with the utmost care.” Steve instructed. “Deliver it to Howard Stark. His hands only.”
He had heard the man talking with Thor and Loki and was eager to see him. However, upon entering the Throne Room he found Tony was gone.
“Holy Hel!” Tony gasped at the pace of their thrusting and Steve’s ability to hit his sweet spot dead on each time. “Steve!” Tony moaned as his climax quickly overtook him.
“They may be dead by then!”
Loki watched the exchange with a sharp eye then glanced at Howard who squared his shoulders.
After touring the grounds Rhodey went for a few laps around the outdoor ring, while Tony watched from the sidelines. Later they lounged in the skylight room. Rhodey told Tony of everything he missed, and Tony kept pelting him with questions about Pepper, Jarvis, and Loki.
Steve let out a chuckle which quickly morphed into a groan. “That was Natasha getting back at me for something I did to her earlier.”
“Don’t be dramatic.” Loki teased, coming out of his closet in nothing but his small clothes. “I simply tidied up my chambers a bit.”
“Sorry to interrupt your training session.” Natasha said to the bewildered looking students. “But Stevie here,” She pinched his cheeks and Steve gave her a glare “wanted you all to be surprised!” Clint giggled again, and dread pooled in Steve’s stomach. “You’ll be joining the tour group now and once we finish up with the next room, Steve will be joining all of you in a relaxing spa session!”
Thor nodded then took off towards Hel.
“Lord Loki.” The shade whispered in reverence, he then folded into a proper bow. “I -I… I cannot believe I am speaking with you. Please, I must go back.”
“In a manner of speaking.” He said dismissively.
“Get out of there while you can.” He muttered glancing between Steve and the dark abyss he knew housed the Hydra.
“Goodnight Tony.”
Tony just stood there and gave his Mother a watery smile as he took in his mother's face.
“Excuse me?” Loki asked befuddled by the change in topics.
“Let Natasha deal with that.” Tony suggested blithely. “She made the promise, let her handle the fall out.” He shrugged.
There were many times Steve had to beat back an over amorous creature who had taken too much a liking to Tony, either in the present or from his past. There were a few from Tony’s past that popped back into his life after hearing he was free from Hel.
Eventually it became a common occurrence for Tony to just show up at their place without an invitation. He’d drop in and watch Sam and Clint’s archery training. Or he’d come and ask one of them for some self defense training. He also always seemed to enjoy watching Thor and Bruce (in his Hulk form) go at it. He’d even make a betting pool with the other Avengers during each match.
“My job?!” The brunette abruptly stopped and quickly whipped his head towards Steve. “How do you know about-”
“It says follow the yellow path till you get to the river Styx. This is obviously that river.” Steve stated gesturing to the instructions on the map.
“Steve is a great man!” Tony yelled, taking a step forward. “He’s good and kind! He genuinely cares about people!”
Loki extended his arms in a “there you have it” fashion. Tony’s eyes darted around, unfocused, as he tried to get a grasp on everything. He let out a shuddering breath and Loki’s eyes softened.
Bruce had finally been able to control himself in his hulk form. Sometimes it took awhile to calm him down; but thanks to Thor and the Avengers, he was able to learn to control himself while in his Hulk form. Which was much appreciated as Thor could not always help in fights but Hulk’s strength made up for the gods absence.
yourself at him. You try to seduce him all the time!” Tony let out an incredulous laugh. “But Loki does nothing to you?!”
“Better get ready, don’t want to let the fans down.” Clint advised with a pat on the back, “We’ll meet you in the steam room!” The crowd cheered again as Steve’s face went beet red.
Sam and Clint’s knees had buckled. When Bucky tried to catch Sam, he ended up falling down with the man. All three men then decided to just lay on the ground.
“Sorry, and no, not yet.” Tony answered blinking a few times. “I have some ideas. Mainly I’ve been able to figure out everyone's best and most powerful qualities. What makes them special, you know?”
Both humans turned around again. This time they could see a human shape near the four-legged beast.
Tony had gone to the Land of the Living, not super often but occasionally, before he knew he could earn his freedom. Then once he learned he could earn his freedom, he went fairly often in order to do recruitments and fetch items. Each time he’d avoid anything to do with Howard, however that wasn’t always easy or possible. The man was everywhere. But how could he not be, he helped everyone; if you were to believe all the billboards and advertisements Tony would stumble across. And on each of these advertisements would be that damn phrase. A mockery of what he had purposefully done to Tony. Never look back, only forward! And each time Tony would try to power through it. Try to get over it. But he couldn’t. He’d always have a panic attack.
Everyone, the spectators, the court, the Avengers, the King and Queen, all looked over to Tony who had climbed up on the Royal box. Tony didn’t look away from King Minos as he walked closer.
The next day the Avengers were getting a very official send off into the labyrinth: the royalty, their court, and a sizable crowd were all gathered. King Minos said no map had been made but offered them string so they could find their way out. The Avengers gratefully accepted this offer, which was handed to them by a silent and slightly shaking Queen Pasiphae.  When Steve went to take the ball, the Queen seemed to grip the ball tighter and showed reluctance in handing it off. Only when King Minos shifted closer did she release it with a watery breath. Steve had stared at the Queen for a few seconds then silently turned and made his way to the entrance of the labyrinth.
“Seeing you all now. Dressed in your heroic garb. Poised for battle! I must say...” The voice that seemed to be coming from everywhere suddenly zeroed in, appearing to be coming from a shadowy corridor leading into the Avengers mansion. “I’m not very impressed.”
As the Ferry got closer the Avengers could see that at the front of the ship stood a female shade. She seemed to relax upon seeing them all at the riverbank. She then turned towards a covered area of the Ferry, where presumably the captain was, and yelled something that the Avengers couldn’t quite hear.
“Some subspecies of one.” Bruce answered trepidatiously.
Thor lunged and wrestled Loki onto the floor and held him there. They continued wiggling and clawing at each other. But Loki didn’t release his winter touch and so Thor was not frostbitten. But the icey floor made it difficult to keep Loki in a hold. Eventually though they were stuck in a grapple.
“Oh Tony you’re so simple.” Amora chuckled then rolled her shoulders and sauntered over towards the balcony. “Humans will tell you anything if you play the right chord.” Amora and Loki shared a smirk.
Another unofficial job she had undertaken was to remind Tony what he was. She would use him as often as she wished but in ways Tony could never seriously complain about since they did fall under his responsibilities that Loki had assigned him.
Thor shook his head and ran a hand through his hair.
2. Also, just to clarify, The Jarvis’s did not live in New Thebes ever. Tony just made up that tale.
Steve ran towards Thor’s back in Central Park and called out to him to get his attention. However, when Thor turned it revealed Tony, who had been hidden by Thor’s bulky frame. Steve and Tony were caught, words lost, eyes locked, and minds empty of what to do next. Thor, seeming to forget the Civil War broke the eye contact by grabbing Steve and asking if he had any news. Another interruption came from a text on their phones.
“Steve, James.” Thor clapped a hand on the ethereal man’s shoulder. “This is Abraham Erskine. He is a mortal that was awarded the honor of being the first mortal to ever visit Asgard.” Erskine gave a smile and Thor took on an apologetic look. “However we were not aware of what would happen to mortals that stay in Asgard for an extended period.”
. It wasn’t for this story I just asked for a Greek myth thorki pic, but it did inspire me to always have Loki shirtless so I’m putting it up here. Here’s her
“Not this again!” Thor roared, anger quickly flooding his features.
“Are you ok Mr…?” He let the sentence trail off into a question as he finally got close to the brunette.
“You betrayed us for a house and some money!” Betty yelled from Bruce’s side.
Nick Fury, who was in charge of the City Guard for New Thebe’s City, had given the heroes a list of issues the city was currently facing that could use their heroic touch. The current top item on the list was taking out the Green Beast.
“What? Wait! You don’t know where it is!” Tony exclaimed as he followed after the retreating god’s back.
“Your real weapon is the one I taught you.” Loki gloated and Tony smirked in agreement.
Steve shook his head and looked at his friend. Steve looked like a wreck, his eyes couldn’t conceal the panic he was feeling and the helplessness that began clawing at him.
“What?!” Tony fired back. “It’s not an issue. There’s nothing going on between us.”
“I didn’t think that blasted fool would actually accept my offer.” Loki admitted “But I couldn’t back out of my word. So I tried to get him out.” Loki swallowed then glared at Thor. “And then you all ruined it!”
“What if you could do something?” Howard interrupted not looking at either boys but staring hard at the floor.
“Don’t be obnoxious Clint.” A woman who seemed to just appear from the shadows said blithely.
Panting, Loki’s head fell forward to his own chest. A gasp then tore itself from his throat when Thor grabbed one of his horns and yanked his head back. The gasp quickly turned into a moaned. Thor then began to thrust into Loki in earnest.
The Avengers shivered at the god’s promise, for that was exactly what it was. Thor glared at his lover but before anymore could be said or shouted back, Loki flicked his hand. Thor saw the portal from the corner of his eyes and rolled out of the way. The Avengers, however, weren’t as lucky and were sucked into the portal along with Pepper.
“St-Stop! Stop it!” Tony tried pushing the tongue away. “You know this doesn’t come out!”
As they approached a crosswalk Clint once again rounded on the group. “Stick close to us heros,” He said while puffing up his chest in a show of confidence. “The city is a dangerous place.” He ended with an eye waggle.
Steve reached out to touch Tony then froze as he realized just how close they had gotten over the course of their talk. They had both walked towards each other and now were only an arm’s length away. They both smiled at each other, then Tony’s smile trailed off into confusion.
“Steve you live in a mini-palace.” Tony reminded with a smile, but thoroughly enjoyed the look of awe on the blonde’s face.
“Exactly.” Amora agreed as her and Tony nodded at each other.
“We won’t fall for any of Loki’s tricks.”
Loki sat upon his throne dripped in his normal gold jewelry and the throne room had a layer of frost coating it. He was still blue, but looked like he was at least making an effort to appear calm. When Tony left there was a layer of ice on the walls, so hurray for small improvements.
“That’s because you treat it like a debrief.” Natasha said giving their leader an unimpressed look. “Add some tone and inflection, sprinkled in with hand gestures and slight body movements and your story becomes an actual story.”
“Bucky!” Steve and Mrs. Barnes admonished.
“Whoa!” Bucky gasped, once Loki was seated.
“No.” Steve answered honestly.
“I can’t do this.” Tony muttered.
“When the apple lands.” Clint called grabbing an apple from his bag and tossing it in the air.
Tony’s eyebrows had already been up when Steve covered his mouth but now they jolted into his hairline. He made to protest this. He didn’t want it, didn’t want Steve to say it. And that gave Tony, himself, pause.
“Tony’s just a child. What could he do?” Maria urged again.
“You told me your weakness and I abused it.” Tony made to protest but Steve physically covered Tony’s mouth with his hand. “So I’ll tell you mine.”
“What?”
“You spent all day with him? Nice stamina!” Clint praised with a shit eating grin.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you think you’ll need more time?”
“YES IT IS!” Steve shot back. “I couldn’t do anything to save my parents. And I couldn’t do anything to save Peggy! I’m useless!” Steve punched the wall near him and winced at the pain.
“These woods took a turn for the worst.” Sam observed as they continued on their way.
1. Can you tell I LOVE Tony and Rhodey friendship?! I see a lot of fics focus on Pepper and Tony’s friendship/relationship, which yes is awesome but, Rhodey!! So Pepper’s friendship takes a backseat and Rhodes and Tones gets the front in this fic
Clint was stuck in place as he had taken a step back to look over the scene. Natasha and Bucky were poised to jump the witch and grab their weapons. Bruce and Sam were forced to freeze in their half crouched positions, as they had immediately tried to assist Tony. Steve had dropped the dagger and was in a running stance. He had tried to run at Tony, tried to get to him, to help him. And Steve’s whole body vibrated as he fought against Amora’s control.
Tony shrugged and gave a smile. “It was a stressful situation. You’re fine.”
Meanwhile Tony, who rarely had relationships, was starting to feel the strain of what being in one really meant. Steve would text and call Tony almost everyday and the brunette were starting to feel suffocated. He needed his space, he needed his time, time to lock himself away from everyone and decompress. In addition, Steve would often be in Tony’s lab with him. Tony loved this! Steve would quietly draw and he would tinker. Sometimes Steve would bring him food and they’d talk, and it was perfect. But, other times, Steve would mother hen him and forcible remove him from his lab –his lab. He knew Steve was trying to look out for him and did it out of love. But Tony needed his freedom, he needed to control his life –to often have people tried to control it for him that he began to resent anyone who tried. Tony didn’t tell anyone and then everything came to a head.
“No!” Bucky defended in a frustrated tone, and then Natasha held up a hand, halting him from saying anything further.
“Then I have to yell at Odin?” Bucky asked harshly and glared up at the sky, as if daring the King of the gods to face him. “Cause I will.” He challenged.
Tony looked stricken but Loki only glared at him from atop his throne. After searching Loki’s face for something, Tony wasn’t even sure what he was searching for, but at the end he knows he didn’t find it. He turned away.
“We’re not talking about this Tony.” Steve finally said, trying to dismiss the subject.
Everyone remained silent as they stared at the huffing brunette. Rhodey looked at Pepper then Steve and seemed to reassess the blonde. Loki glanced from Bucky to Thor, who gave Loki an imploring look. Loki quickly looked away.
Eventually Steve returned and gestured for the group to follow him. After traveling through the trees for a little bit of time they happened upon a track area. The track was one you would run a horse on. It didn’t look very used but on the other side of the track, giving the group a hesitant wave, was Tony.
He was having a harder time holding back his panic the more dead ends and “no we haven’t seen him” answers they received.
“Steve-” Loki began still holding the Scepter in a striking position. However Rhodey barled over him as he trotted over to the blonde.
Tonight had been scary. Steve had gotten to him. He was weak after his panic attack and couldn’t fend him off. Tony had even thought, had the audacity to almost beg Steve on not telling him his weakness. It turned out the “weakness” was a metaphorical one but still!
“Tony are you well?” Thor asked. At the shade and his lover’s incredulous look, he amended. “Well, as well as you can be...considering?” Thor gestured towards Tony’s ghostly body.
“Not sure, he tries to never transform.” Tony swayed his head back and forth. “Actually, I’ve never seen him as the Hulk.” He pouted
“We did.” Betty answered.
Ty who had been trying to get Tony to kiss him while also trying to unpin the one pin his clothes had, stopped and stared at the other blonde. Tony who had been simultaneously trying to keep his clothes on and his face away from Ty, also stopped and gave the newcomer an incredulous look.
“It looks like there was a box here.” Clint pointed at the desk. “It probably held some paperwork of some sort. But all the papers that must have been on the desk and the box are gone.”
“No. We are going to the Palace of Hel.” Thor announced in a decisive tone.
“Mark it down so you don’t forget.” Loki lectured.
3. You can see I allude to a promise between Tony and Loki, it’s one of the side stories in my head during Tony’s childhood in Hel. But I’m sure you all can imagine the backstory to that as well.

He wanted to check to make sure Loki had not been there the night before. Thor was protective of those close to him, and he knew Loki wasn’t overly fond of The Avengers. So he wanted to make sure this statue of Loki was just that and not Loki disguising himself.
Everyone shook their head in the negative or scoffed at the very notion. Loki let them get it out of their system before another smirk took over his face.
1. This confrontation was hard to write. I had a few versions in my head but they didn’t work with the story anymore. It’s also harder to factor in everyone agreeing. In order for everyone to agree all other options had to be exhausted so that made this run longer than an impulse ‘save damsel’ decision.
“Bucky!” Steve chastised.
“Oookay…?” Tony threw another glance towards where Thor took off to. “Is he here to, what? Make sure Loki wasn’t here last night?” Tony finally bit out harshly.
“Tony,” He trailed a finger down the brunette’s arm. “What’s the first thing you want to do now as a free man?”
They both turned to Loki and the blue god just stared at them, no amusement or approval in his eyes.
Said man looked both hopeful and trepedicious at the blonde’s tone. However before Steve could say another word a woman screaming and in a clear panic ran onto the beach. She was shouting for the Avengers.
Once King Minos had been put in proper restraints the high ranking court member announced they’d hold a trial and in the meantime control of the country would go to Queen Pasiphae. Tony then climbed off the Royal Box while Asterion walked towards it and his mother.
Bucky had been a natural at most weapons, which was no surprise to Steve. Bucky had been training ever since they were kids to be a soldier, while Steve was kept out for being too skinny and sickly. Sam was great at long distance weapons which paired nicely with his wings. Steve meanwhile didn’t really like using weapons. He had a circular shield Thor had gifted him which, like Thor’s hammer, always returned to Steve and that was good enough for him.
Steve held up a hand as the whistling became louder.
To fill the silence and pass the time, Bucky had told the group of his and Steve’s first visit into Hel.
The days continued to pass with Bucky doing most of the teaching. Bucky taught Steve the basics of fighting he had learned. Both boys would run up and down the beach and through the small forest everyday. All while Erskine watched, observing them.
“It’s the sea.” Steve finally said as he released his hold over Tony’s mouth.
Both men gave the blonde a look of utter disbelief, which Steve did not think he earned. However, before either could answer Natasha spoke again.
“If this turns out to be a double cross I-I just want to warn you that it won’t turn out well. Not like a threat! Just a warning! I haven’t transformed in awhile and I’m not sure how much I can control.” Bruce stumbled to explain as he and the 5 heroes walked out of the Monster Bog and onto the main path.
“Why make me send messages for when my visits shall be if you won’t even greet me?!” Thor complained as he made his way over to Loki’s personal chambers.
“What were you kidding about?” Tony asked, trying to maneuver himself to see around Steve’s body.
“What about you Steve?” Bucky elbowed the blonde.
Instantly, black mist overtook all the Avengers and began to seep into them. Once Loki released Steve’s hand all the Avengers dropped to the floor. Their bodies shook and their breathing became labored as the world seemed to tilt and become unstable under them. Steve’s body immediately began morphing back into his frail and skinny form and Clint’s eyes began to blur into an unseeing gray.
“Wait! Shit! Sorry! Real quick!” Tony rushed then ran over to Jarvis and wrapped the shade in a hug. “I’m going to miss being able to hug you.” Tony mumbled quiet enough only Jarvis could hear.
And as the city was being rebuilt he had watched Steve run to and fro, doing all sorts of odd jobs; such as food delivery, errand running, water fetching, and other menial tasks and he was impressed. He offered for Steve to become his assistant and Steve accepted. Steve did many odd jobs for the man but with Steve’s less than impressive physique his main job appeared to be keeping Howard company.
“Actually, I have to agree. I’m not a huge fan of that name.” Sam added and Clint gave a triumphant noise.
“I know I can’t hurt you….well not physically….yet.” She gave an evil smile. “But I know hurting them,” She waved to the Avengers. “Will hurt you.” She gave a happy shrug. “So it’s like a cherry on top.”
“Steve,” Bucky urged, resting a calming arm around his friend. Both friends shared a look of betrayal. Both were shocked beyond imagining at their friends past actions.
“We’ve got the power.” Sam smiled “Better to use it for good, than not at all.”
He gestured to the 6 wet cement blocks that had each Avengers name written in them. On cue the Avengers walked off the stage and kneeled in front of each of their respective blocks.
“That’s probably where he stores his work.” Natasha deduced.
“You’ve got the wrong idea buddy.” Clint said with an odd look in his eyes.
“I am in charge here.” The horned god began in a toneless voice. He glared at Amora. “I make the decisions, not you Amora. I will not risk you getting detected. You are not on this mission.”
“Same. I may not be able to dodge or move as quickly as I used to, but it’s better than nothing.” Steve couldn’t help but flinch at that, as did the others. Natasha seemed to notice and grimaced. “I didn’t mean-”
“I am close to you! Not them!” The blue god then yanked on Thor’s armor so he had to lower himself and Loki seethed into his face. “And if they try to get close to you, I will tear their souls asunder!”
“...I don’t understand.” Pepper finally spoke up from her spot behind everyone.
“Mortals in Hel.” Thor mused as Loki fumed. “That is commendable.”
“Several.” Thor growled. “What do you want with the Casket?”
“But why haven’t we seen him?” The redhead questioned calmly as she looked over everyone. “We’ve never spotted him at all, not once. Plus, Clint and I have never seen him before.”
“I wouldn’t sully my hands with your filth.” Loki spat. “No you’re going to give me all your strengths. Everything that makes you
Loki gave the blonde a cool look. “Where’s the fun in that?”
Once inside and away from the entrance Sam dropped the ball of string. They then wandered the labyrinth for some time before finally coming across Asterion. Tony was correct, once they said his name the Minotaur stopped charging towards them and instead looked at them questioningly. Sam and Bucky explained they were here to free him not hurt him. Steve then pulled out the magic map he had brought with them. Only instead of going for an obscure exit or cause a break in the labyrinth like in the original plan, Steve led them towards the front entrance.
When Tony had said the first thing he had wanted to do was to see his mother. Steve swore he would make sure to reunite them. However Tony wasn’t ready to see Howard. Neither was Steve to be honest; but he didn’t say that to Tony. And so, after much back and forth communication with the Barnes family they had finally tracked Maria down, alone. She was spending some time at the Great Temple of Frigga. And so Steve had formulated a plan so that Tony and his mother would finally reunite.
