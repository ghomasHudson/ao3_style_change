He lifts out racks of his clothes from the cupboard and haphazardly tucks it in. He grabs a few more handfuls - his t-shirts, his pants, the dress shirts he owns, his underwear and his tank tops all thrown in one pile. He smooths down the fabric lump and tucks and squeezes and fits as much as he can into the carriage before he throws open another one and tosses the remaining clothes in it, similarly.
He remembers running to his baby's room with bated breath and wobbling legs, muttering some crap as he bolted, with Steve at his heels trying to make him see some sense, to see his baby sleeping soundly in his crib with one thumb in his mouth.
Some of them have been there long since he came and few people, like Carol and Brunhilde, who've been there with him since he joined. He glances over the crowd one last time before he draws a breath, sits up and clears his throat, crossing his ankles behind him.
A wave of fatigue crashes into Tony. He's been dealing with these conflicting feelings forever and recently, they've reached their peak for the past three days and each time, he's left either horribly broken or breaking down or terribly scared.
Tony knows that's more of a command than a suggestion. He nods in response and frees his legs from the cocoon.
He peppers Steve's face with kisses and wraps his arms around his neck. Steve's eyes snake up Bucky's sides and settle on his hips, as they begin to clash their mouths furiously, moaning and panting into each other's mouths before Bucky crawls into Steve's lap and presses down upon him.
"Carol, first of all, I'm incredibly pissed with the both of you for hiding this from me. FROM ME! Secondly, I'm going to go ask platypus myself about this."
Rhodey jolts forward, almost sending Tony hurtling to the other side of the couch if he hadn't got up as soon as he saw the bewildered expression on his face.
He's trying to stand upright, but his efforts are slowly diminishing with the rising quake that radiate from the back of his knees to his hips, sending trembles in waves throughout his thighs and knees, urging his legs to buck and make him collapse onto the floor in a heap. His kneecaps feel like jelly and his feet feel like they are being pricked on needles, each tip digging slowly and painfully into every square inch of his skin, untill they become a very part of his anatomy. His legs urge to be ripped off, they no longer wish to suffer this plight and he can feel the loss of sensation slowly creeping up in them, tuning out feeling, which he hasn't been able to do.
"Yeah, I came home late, like how he fucking does and the little bitch had the audacity to question me."
Tony tosses his head obliquely and crosses an arm over the other, in defense of his stance as Carol starts chuckling in unison with him.
Eventually, Tony can't take the tease and pinches Steve's arms. That's all the soldier needs before he starts bouncing Tony on him, using his hips and thighs to fuck up into Tony so furiously, he's lost in the pleasure of being inside the smaller man and he doesn't realize he's chattering Tony's name into his ears while nipping his earlobe and resting his stubble on Tony's exposed shoulder.
Today, he decided to go out on a long walk, having got the Saturday off. Steve wasn't at home as usual and Tony didn't want to disturb Rhodey or Pepper, thinking they'd be busy.
Steve doesn't fight the thoughts. He lets them run, wild and untethered as they rake nails and jab daggers into every fiber of his being.
So he just sits there and muffles his sobs and wails into the sleeves of his sweater, feeling utterly and truly helpless and...
Steve walks around the garden and unlocks his car, before getting into it and almost slamming the door shut.
Steve knows Tony misses Peter, just as he does but he's always different at expressing his worry or concern, pampering Peter with new stuff or a new black amex card, which always kind of set of Steve.
They stay like that for a long time untill Rhodey coaxes Tony into the house, as he grabs the keys out of the ignition and locks the car, following Tony slowly.
"No, I'm not going back to him. Hell, no! I think it's time. I'm going to end it. It's been long in the happening."
He peels the cotton back and rubs it again with a fresh tuft of wet spirit and that's probably when Steve winces for the first time.
Tony walks to the elevator and dings the button before getting in and clicking the button for the basement.
Tony feels like lightning is coursing through his body as he's somewhat riding Steve so ferally and he can feel the warmth of Steve's chest against his back and Steve all over him, staking claim on Tony's body and soul for eternity. Steve clearly missed him and Tony did too. These missions were always too long.
He pulls the door handle and climbs into the driver's seat, readjusting the height and the rearview mirrors before revving the vehicle to life. His hands smooth over the steering wheel as the leather turns cold under his fingertips. With one last sigh, he releases the clutch, along with his inhibitions, and drives out onto the road.
He quickly brushes his tears and starts the car, before reversing it onto the road and zooming out onto the street.
He was supposed to tell Tony tomorrow, if he was here. Well, Tony said he'd come back tomorrow evening and then Steve would tell him. He'd finally confess and let Tony react however. Well, he won't have a choice but to listen or bear the aftermath of whatever happens.
Bucky wakes and glances at Steve, blinking twice before he smiles in earnest at him. Steve smiles back, he's always smiled back every time but it's always abruptly halted as he feels a sick churning in his gut and an ache in his heart.
Initially, Tony was terrified of being a parent, fearing that he would follow in his father's footsteps. All it took from Steve was a generous amount of patience and explaining that Tony would never be his father, that he was better than him and that he would be a great dad to their kid. Slowly, Tony came to terms with his traumatic childhood. It took him a great deal to get over the fear, the anxiety, the overburdening pain of his past but he worked through it with Steve by his side.
Tony was a moaning mess by the end of Steve's possessive touches, of his lips, of his hands roaming the expanse of his back and squeezing his ass cheeks as he lay on top of him, squirming on him and grinding his rock-hard, cloth-confined dick onto Steve's abdomen, rocking it forward onto the crevices of his toned abs. Tony's own hands came to grip Steve's long, golden hair and ended up yanking his head back, attacking the golden skin there, leaving marks that would disappear soon. Tony got fiercer, sinking teeth into Steve, making him cry out in ecstasy. Tony knew he liked it because he was gripping his back and raking nails through his skin, his words reduced to gasps and a chant of Tony's name from his mouth.
Steve's largesse sprung out, standing proud and leaking, demanding attention. Tony saw a smirking Steve cock an eyebrow. He obliged quickly, thumbing Steve's slit before licking up the pre-cum dutifully. Licking and swallowing around the head, Tony popped off a noise. Grinning at a relaxed Steve, Tony swallowed the entire length in one go, feeling the fat head poke at his uvula. Tony stayed like that for a moment, feeling his saliva pool around the delicious intruder and laving his tongue around. He palmed Steve's balls and fondled them with the tips of his fingers, tickling at the soft blonde hairs. He dragged in a long breath, inhaling the musk of Steve's scent, honed in the golden hairs of his pubis and remained so for quite a while, breathing  rather laboriously.
One arm yanked Tony's, well actually Steve's tee down and he laid Tony's neck and shoulders bare as the shirt bunched at his nipples. He continued nuzzling his hot beard through Tony's neck and shoulders, attacking his beautiful olive skin with his teeth, tongue and lips, with such lovesick intensity that Tony couldn't handle it anymore and he turned around and latched his lips onto Steve's as they kissed and kissed and kissed, hot and heavy and bothered as they panted into each others mouth, all the while standing.
It's rather rude to not take notice of someone who's come to meet him, despite him knowing that the person has arrived but Tony's so tired of having to meet and greet people so much in these past few months, dealing with the Accords and Ross and Pepper just leaving the company for a much needed vacation break and Bruce just vanishing…. The list could go on but Tony has never been one to complain, always trying to do as much as he could, try to fix and save as much as he can, always helping and accommodating. It's what makes Tony, well… Tony.
Despite its large size, the couple on the bed were cooped up in one corner, seemingly asleep soundly as one of them roused from his slumber and yawned delightfully. The other continued to snooze as his head rested on the chest of his love and his frame splayed out over his, limbs clutching the bigger man's frame. Both of them savoured the delicious contact of naked skin they felt against each other, breathing calm and unhindered into each other's space, like the other was oxygen.
His eyes dart to either ends of the space in front of him so that he can find that loser and shove a pencil in his eye or worse.
The house feels empty, barren almost. To better describe it, it looks like the house has been possessed.
Months later, Peter left for college and Tony couldn't take the blatant ignoring and side-stepping Steve did. He started spending more time away from home, putting forth heavier schedules and a greater workload in his defense.
"Listen to me, Tony -", James' voice firm and unyielding, "you cannot stay here after you break it off. You don't need him or his negativity around you. You moved to New York for him and now look at the end result. He doesn't even respect the history you both have for almost 20 years to even let you off the hook and break things respectfully. Don't stay here and punish yourself Tony. Steve's just going to make everything worse for you. I promise I will keep an eye on Pete and if Steve tries anything funny, let's just say, a Lieutenant-Colonel will KICK the ex-Captain's ass."
Steve begins to bob Tony up and down his furiously aching length, impaling him on his cock as Tony just whines and mutters. He starts slowly, letting Tony get used to the feeling of being stretched around Steve's glorious length.
"Uhh, so first of, I would like to thank everyone here for supporting me. And for the coffee and the snacks. Martha, you keep whipping up batches of your coconutties and I will personally build you a bakery."
Steve also learnt that Tony was the head of the R&D department and an expert engineer of Stark Industries. The young CEO had to bear the brunt of his parents' untimely demise and take up the mantle of being successor to their legacy. And he did it with such poise and grace that it made Steve fall for him all the more.
Tony still loves him. He fiercely did so, everyday and every minute and he fiercely does. His heart still refuses to believe the current turn of events and he wants to go back, he wants to go back and find Steve at home and hug him and kiss him and fall at his feet and apologize for leaving instead of fixing things. He wants Steve to make love to him like how he did before, tenderly and passionately as he whispered sweet nothings in his ear but this time it would be Tony's turn to whisper breathy apologies and declarations of love, telling him he's his and that he always will be, all the while he framed Steve's beautiful, chiseled face in between his palms and kissed away as their passion exploded in tumultuous amount.
In one fluid motion, Steve yanks Tony's legs out and hooks his arms under the backside of his knees, eliciting such a nasty whine from the genius, Steve feels his cock pulse inside of Tony and he thinks he's leaking precum like a hose inside of him.
It's been a long mission, a stakeout with Nat and Sam for almost two week as they stalked the Hydra base for any intel on what Fury tipped them off. They might've caught a few trucks entering and exiting. They might've intercepted the same and knocked out everyone on it. They probably also trashed the entire base and everything in it.
He hears footsteps inching towards him and as soon as they come close, he feels a hand upon his shoulder, it's gentle tips digging into his collarbone and squeezing ever so slightly.
He presses the remote key of the car and hears it beep and the locks open. He presses another key, prompting the boot to open as the door slowly rises up revealing the fuzz of the boot carpet.
It had been almost a month since he wrote Tony that letter and sent him the burner phone. He never expected a reply and well, now that he did in fact get one, he was ecstatic and frankly, a little overwhelmed.
Tony feels like that's a lie and his parched throat proves it. He clears it before swallowing a bit to lubricate the dry walls and resume talking.
Tony and Steve look at each others faces before bursting out in laughter as their arms clasp each other close at the waist. Their bodies resonate in unison with the loud vibrations of laughter which conclude in happy tears and adoration for their little Spider-boy.
There is a single handwritten entry on it, in a morph of scribble and calligraphy, spelling out: "Steve"
They went on multiple dates, over the span of eight months, evoking reactions of varied degrees from the public. Steve knew the camera was always on Tony, being an heir he was. The headlines of newspapers were always about them whenever they were spotted outside, either having a meal together or strolling by, hands intertwined with each other, with big red letters trying to drive the public to decode their relationship status or what not.
Tony's just met with silence and a frozen Steve Rogers, who's still quaking with horror of what he did.
Tony doesn't have to wait long as he hears the door of his bedroom click and hears the slap of footsteps from behind him.
"Siberia was probably the biggest revelation for me and my actions justify that. You know about my relationship with my parents and how it's always affected me, right from the time I was a child. I lost my cool and reacted aggressively towards you and Barnes, because I was overcome by my PTS, which triggered me violently.
Steve laughed at Tony's begging and began rocking Tony up and down his clothed cock, now having his hands on Tony's waist, fully supporting Tony's weight. It never mattered much to Steve anyway, Tony was adorably petite and some sinful part of Steve got off on that, repeatedly, as he lifted Tony like he was nothing and manhandled him to his liking, not that Tony ever complained.
He closes his eyes, bunching the lids at their conjecture and heaves a sigh. He's exhausted. He's so terribly exhausted of this ordeal and everything it has entailed ever since he joined the Avengers. Maybe he shouldn't have. He shouldn't have even made it out of the bunker. Or the cave in the desert. He should have just died so that he wouldn't be burden like this to anyone.
"You're gonna answer my question. I have just one question for you and I want you to give me an honest answer for once in your GODDAMN LIFE TO ME.
Tony hearing this from the other side of the wall. His walls have been soundproof but this din is so GODDAMN loud that it's heard through a five foot thick wall.
That didn't stop others from doing so to Tony as they carelessly just used him and left. He bore it patiently, never wanting to seek answers or retribution, just simply accepting that it was how they were or that he was of no use beyond that. He was simply meant to be a utilitarian commodity for the needs and wants of others and for the occasional blue moon pleasure of one man.
Tony whined out as Steve buried himself fully and completely lost his voice, only emitting garbled noises interspersed with a string of curse words and chants of Steve's name from his lips.
"I want to be yours, Steve. I want the world to know I'm yours. And that you're mine. You have been ever since we met in DC. Please, Steve. Please."
"Yeah, the bastard was motorboating that whore when I saw. I think it's the same house I saw his car parked outside the last time."
His heart wrenches with guilt and pain as he lets out a breathy sob. His crying gets more and more intense, making his shoulders wrack with the force and his hands to tremble in their unsteady grip; his legs have gone numb and feel like the liquid static of an untuned television set, like the drive took centuries for him.
Two chapters in a day????? Whaaaaaaaat? I can't believe it either but here you go. Thank you so much to everyone who's been reading and leaving comments, I love you guys!
He places his bags into the space and slams the door loud, as it resonates within the fibres of his being, which strange enough, elicits a smile from him, no matter how small or mild.
Steve's face snaps up to look at Tony's unstable one, his face thrumming with the weight of his emotion he's not bothering to hide. His brown orbs show such feral betrayal that Steve feels everything in him clench, as a new wave of anger rises in him.
People who stepped on him, people who used him for whatever they saw fit and then tossed him aside, people who demeaned him to the point of crushing whatever pint of self-confidence he had, people who kept prying into his life like they had the right to....
"Oh God, Steve. I'd make a fucking sweater out of it if I could. Aaah-it's so fucking hot. Never shave it!”
Tony felt his breath hitch when Steve breached him and started grating and rotating his thumb in Tony, making the genius cry out in unabashed pleasure.
"Wow..... It's been twenty years. Twenty years since I woke up without a pounding headache or a strange person in my bed. Or someone else's bed."
"No... No, you don't. All you care about is what you wanted. Once upon a time, it might've been me. And you got it too. You didn't give a single shit about what I went through every night, fucking crying into my pillow when I needed you the most. I needed you. And you weren't there."
"Don't fucking lie to me, Steve. Don't you dare even fucking try lying to me now. You've lied enough for the past two fucking years. God, maybe even before that I don't fucking know."
He remembers him coming back that night with a washcloth, carelessly wiping Tony off and throwing a blanket over them as he turned his back to Tony, dropping off to sleep instantly.
He wraps a big gauze pad across Steve's stomach after putting some antiseptic on the wound and a fat glob of ointment on it.
After a while, the machine dings and Tony pours himself a full, enriching mug. Steam rises from it in copious amounts, twirling and twisting within themselves before disappearing into the air.
Steve just mewls out under Bucky's ministrations and grips his hips tightly trying to stop him, almost.
Steve felt his body was on fire. Only Tony could make him feel like this. Sweet, amazing Tony Stark was the spark that probably set off or shut down all of Steve Rogers' functions.
Steve didn't speak a word in response, he just continued plundering Tony's mouth with his lips and tongue, savouring the taste of Tony's morning breath and partially himself from last night. He moaned into Tony's mouth, breathing heavily and hot into the genius's space as he claimed him for himself, his hands raking over Tony's body and squeezing so tightly that he was going to leave bruises everywhere on his body. Marking him. Claiming him. Showing the universe that Tony was his. Tony IS his.
Tony pushes Steve back onto the cold floor and lies on top of him, his head resting on the broad expanse of Steve's chest. Steve's arms have encircled Tony fully and he's latched on pretty tight, like he's going to lose him. He traces a few curves and lazy patterns through the light blonde hair, occasionally kissing the skin beneath him. Steve's still inside him, locking himself in there and Tony feels another wave pulse through his spine feeling so fucking hot at the thought.
Tony bobbed his head more vigorously, in long strokes, licking and toying with Steve's dick, ever so often letting his teeth graze so slightly along the length, hearing a whimper from Steve, who was grabbing the sheets so tightly. Steve's golden skin shined against the brighter morning light, his luscious frame sparkling in beautiful glints, highlighting his beautiful bone structure, complemented by cakes of brilliant muscle. Steve was heaving his breaths, his chest rising and falling so intensely that Tony grabbed the base of his own cock, refusing to let himself be spent so quickly. Gosh darn, Steve's beauty!
Steve plunders Tony's mouth again with his kisses and licks into him furiously, as he begins to lower them onto the floor with Tony straddling him and his cock still inside Tony. He sits down and stretches his legs out, giving Tony a seat.
Steve races back upstairs and begins scanning the house, looking for Tony in the kitchen, the gym, the laundry room, anywhere and everywhere but he finds no sign of Tony.
His mind constantly plays the images, torturing him, punishing him like he's being whipped a thousand times for his sins.
"Ever since I was little, I was always last to be considered. By my parents. By my "friends". By everyone frankly. I was always considered last, and, after I met you and we got hitched, well, I was sceptical of dissimilar treatment. Untill after a while, I thought that okay, someone might finally think I was valid to them. Like, for once, someone has accepted me. And you know, after aeons of fighting against the world, I was happy that someone did. I felt glad that I found it in the most unusual place and that made it all the more better.
One is pushing him further to cause a scene and the other is goading him to just toss this ringing piece of garbage in the trash.
Steve was roaming in the gardens of the Wakandan palace when he heard his kimoye bead beep, alerting him.
Steve trembles and shudders as his teeth chatter and toes tingle against the icy sensation. He's never liked the cold.
"I understand why you did what you did and even though I don't agree, I forgive you Steve. I forgive both of you. I was angry and I just.... I don't hold grudges, that's not me but I cannot face Barnes right now. I need space. I need time to completely come to terms with everything that happened. I don't think I'm fully over it but I know I don't harbour resentment anymore."
Tony's head perks up slowly, grimacing at Rhodey, as the wet tear stains pool at the hollow of his eyes. He manages to give it a small smirk which Rhodey returns, with no sympathy or pity in his features, just soft adoration, which soothes Tony, knowing that even if the world turns against him, he's got Rhodey and Pepper with him.
Tony plops down on the couch and leans his head back, exhausted when he hears muffled sobs coming from the wall behind him.
Steve feels Bucky's hips grind down upon him, causing him to go flush with want. Bucky kneels for a while before settling back down slowly, aiming his entrance to engulf Steve's length.
Hi! I know it's been really long and I'm sorry for the hiatus. This fic kinda stressed me out because this shit physically hurt me lol (yea I'm obsessed with Stony and I can't bear to see them hurt)
Tony grabs the handle and pushes the door out and then he practically falls into Rhodey's arms, clutching onto his shoulders. Startled at first, Rhodey clings onto Tony's torso with a firm grip.
It was rare that Steve smiled. And when he used to, it was always forced, which used to pain Tony's heart. As time worked in their favour, Steve started smiling more and Tony started feeling lighter and lighter, whether it was a stupid joke or some nasty innuendo (which was, au contraire, Steve's fault) or just them being themselves, being content in each other's company and the encapsulating warmth of a mutual comfort between them.
Tony nips at Steve's lower lip, earning a growl into his mouth, making him chuckle. Then, he turns his full focus on Steve's beard and Tony kisses the hairs above Steve's lips and licks the hairs with his tongue, feeling like one hell of a lascivious slut. He shifts his focus to the chin and even bites a few strands of stubble off of Steve's chin, earning a low howl from the super-soldier. Tony rakes his hands through Steve's cheeks and kisses Steve's beard so passionately, one would think it's a new deity on Steve's face.
Steve shakes the thoughts out of his head. No, if Tony found out, it just means everything going to shit. Tony probably just answered the last part of what Steve said. He knows Steve loves him and probably always will. Tony always knew.
He crumbled to the ground as he clutched the paper close, his whole body shuddering as he let out muffled sobs.
As the door slams behind him, it's crack echoing through the hall, somewhat resonating with the white noise going on inside his head, Tony freezes.
Steve might've been a little too worried over the phone as he just rambled out at Tony. Tony seemed fine over the phone and he sounded like he was sleeping and frankly, was quite annoyed by Steve's disturbance.
He'd fucking babble about you. He'd rant to whoever was around him about how you're going to leave him because he's a fucking mess and that he doesn't deserve someone like you. Sometimes, when Pepper was around, he'd fucking break down and complain that he was ruining everything he built with you because he couldn't stop drinking. He gave it up for you, Steve and he went to therapy for you.
He leans against the wall fully, hands bound tightly against his sides, his fists clenched tightly and knuckles itching.
Steve spat into his palm and stroked his dick one last time, before pressing it down to spring back up, causing heat to burn within Tony.
Howard was right. He was always right. Tony's always been a disappointment, full of shortcomings and failures.
It's Steve's point of view. There's some snoof, fluff and maybe even a little stony smut ;) (not explicit tho)
Loud footsteps can be heard. Well actually, more like thundering footfalls, marked by rage and a hint of sorrow.
"Oh God, Cap, take me right now. Holy fuck!!! Mmmm oh my God, just take me. Make love to me, my soldier."
"How about we skip the meetings today and you... hmmmm.... stay with me. Stay here. Stay home.", Steve spoke in between loud smacking kisses.
Before Steve knew it, he raced back to the palace, feed thudding and heart pounding as he ran up stairs and through hallways to reach the King's private audience hall which was in the far northeast wing.
Tony feels his entrance pulsate as he takes all of Steve's seed in, he can feel the hot, creamy semen pump into him, painting his insides and his entire being becoming Steve's in this exhilarating notion, and his own cock pulses with the thought. Tony feels some of it leak outside and hears the plop of a few drops on the floor. Steve's super-soldier orgasms were always... voluminous.
Tony puts a hand out and accepts the chip. Loud applause follows right after, in different paces, intermixed together to form a cacophony of palms slapping against each other to congratulate him on his successful endeavour.
As Steve pounds up into Tony, Tony grabs his hair and yanks his head back, to lick a long stripe throughout his foliage.
Steve regards her with a petulant smile before taking a long hit of coffee and biting down on the croissant satisfyingly.
The King clasped a hand to Steve's shoulder and squeezed it slightly, in a reassuring gesture, before leaving Steve alone.
Tony just couldn't take it anymore and he stopped trying as well, deeming that he'd put in effort as well if he fucking wanted to. He remembers crying silently in their bed as he curled in on himself, clutching his knees close to his chest, letting out aching sobs that wracked through his body untill he slept, cry-hiccuping.
Steve was dejected by this interruption but then again, he found some hope when Tony turned to him with the most beautiful expression and mouthed to him, silently:
Steve huffs a sigh of relief before returning his phone to the drawer and wrapping himself up in the double blanket.
The sensation along his fingers is eerily relaxing, making him get lost in playing with his cup that he's not even paying attention to whatever is happening around him.
He swallows thickly and bunches his hands in front of him, flexing his digits around one another as he intertwines both sets of them. He grinds his teeth and clenches his jaws down hard.
Rage and fear grip Tony's throat, both those emotions fighting for dominance, as a shudder wracks through his spine.
Tony noticed Steve drifting away slowly and tried to make amends, to fix this quietly, thinking the fault was within himself. He tried everything he could. Planning romantic dinners at home, pampering Steve with gifts and coupons and tickets to a four-day getaway in the Bahamas, tried to spice things up in the bedroom - all to no avail. Steve favoured his excuses saying he was not hungry, he couldn't get holidays from work and closing his eyes during sex, barely touching Tony even as Tony used to place both of his hands right on Steve's chest, his right hand always feeling the thudding pump of his heart, as he kept thrusting in him like he just wanted to be done with this, beckoning him to let him back inside so that he could fix whatever was wrong. He was terrified of confronting Steve, thinking that he would leave him and Peter, finally breaking everything off, not wanting to live this lie anymore.
He flinches immediately and flings himself to the other side of the window, still not facing the man. He doesn't say anything, but the action speaks enough for itself. He swallows again and cocks his head to the side towards the window. He's too terrified right now. Or too scared. Or both. He doesn't know. The very touch that once was a source of warmth and comfort for him now rattles a fear so great through his bones that he's left trembling and he doesn't realize he's gripping the curtains for support, bunching the fabric in his fist as he tries to suppress a sob.
He tiptoes into the lab, trying to be as silent as he could, right through the seemingly large space in between Tony's main work station and when he catches sight of the smaller man, his breath hitches in his throat and he's wide-eyed at the sight offered to him.
Tony continues playing tonsil hockey with Steve and he feels so content, so happy with the fact that he finally has Steve with him, now and forever. His emotions pour forth into his kisses as he continues kissing the soldier, moaning and panting into his mouth, their breaths intermingling.
Steve hummed in response as his grip on Tony's waist got tighter and he pulled him into him closer, like it was possible.
The thing was, Tony was definitely Steve's type. He had an argument for every proposition, every idea where he'd twist it upon its head and present it from another point of view. Suffice to say, Steve loved it and he admired Tony's open mindedness. Tony also listened intently to Steve's own point of view on things and took it in consideration.
Tony doesn't remember much afterwards except of what he was told. He cried so hard that he could not breathe. He supposedly babbled utter nonsense about someone taking his baby away from them as he hiccuped through his tears, which landed him collapsing into his husband's arms, passing out where he stood and then he was put to bed where he slept for almost fourteen hours. Or so it seemed.
“Truth be told, I’m still not seeing where the worry is coming from, here.” Tony unfroze his muscles with purposeful deliberation, and proceeded to turn off the stove. “I’m being positively angelic here. Isn’t that how adults are supposed to behave?”
He actually doesn’t think it until they’re halfway through their fourth battle as Avengers. (…fourth. He’d never thought he’d stick it out this long. He never thought his...battlefield promotion, in a way, to a fully-fledged Avenger would actually hold). But Tony’s executing a barrel roll in some unglamorous dockyard off the east coast, and he’s about to blow the heads off some automatons on the downward spiral when the afternoon sun glint off vibranium almost blinds him.
“Stark, I swear– ” Steve’s hands rose as if half in mind to physically remove Tony out of his path, but they froze in mid-air, blue eyes darting to the urinals and back to his fingertips again, before they fell to his sides reluctantly.
Regardless. When your best friend is Russian, you pick up a few words-and his oft-remarked on idiocy set aside, Clint had a decent knack for languages. It was an almost conscious effort on his part though…not to pick up more than was minimal and necessary to get by on. He didn’t want to lose this. This hypnotism at feeling the words roll over him with and without meaning. Taking both him and Natasha to a place they’d never been, in their own ways. Childhood.
Well then, Tony despaired, if even prudish SHIELD agents were used to his antics now, then what was the point of him really? Mind, he wasn’t even being that hyperbolic. His tailbone definitely twinged as he left the hardwood chair he’d been sprawling on for the last twenty minutes, and he wasn’t standing quite as straight as he’d like to be. Which wasn’t even that much, Tony was all for nonchalant slouching. It was all these robotic SHIELD agents that gave him complexes, what with the steel rulers taped to their spines.
The smile on memory-Tony’s face dimmed, but the barely perceptible affection in the face lingered. The words were intended to deliver comfort. “You’ll get there one day.”
Sam shrugged loosely. “Can’t lie. I’d just renovated the kitchen at the DC ‘partment, even though I spent most of the week in the Facility. Mrs. Harris from the bakery two blocks over was nice. Always gave me free apple-and-rhubarb muffins.”
Sam’s lips curved, head sinking in a single nod-because he was always going to toss his lot in with faith. Doubts and all. “I will.”
It wasn’t even a pithy line – the last couple minutes had been the most honest ones Tony had shared with… not a robot, in a good few months. Before he left, he and Steve had been working their way, painstakingly, to a friendship and closeness that then never got the time to settle. Which lead to moments like these, comfortable and ingenuous until Tony got jolted out of it by the reminder of who he was talking to and words like
Steve’s head was bent, the fading light from War Machine’s repulsors catching on the bare skin of that chin. Back curled in, hands hanging uselessly by his side. Cerulean eyes lifted to meet Sam’s, dark and shuttered-and Sam could feel the pain lance through his own chest, quiet and hopeless.
“Considering the Avengers have been privately funded by SI for over two years, I’m hoping you have a point to make other than hypocrisy.” Ross returned, sharpness shooting through his tone just as quickly.
.” The word sharpened imperceptibly. “That tells themselves emotion had nothing to do with it, are lying.”
There haven’t been many distances in Steve’s life that he has been afraid to cross. There was the flaming chasm in the camp that Steve had first rescued Bucky from- with Red Skull on the other side. There were the twenty steps between him and Peggy, resplendent in a red dress, in that dingy, bustling bar so very many years ago. Still, he’d always taken the leap in the end- flung himself into the unknown, across distances and down heights, never knowing the touch of cowardice. Even when his legs had been too scrawny or too banged up to bear his weight, he’d crawled forward. Sheer grit, if nothing else.
Curiosity somewhat mitigating the irritability at the interruption of sleep, Steve started blindly feeling around for his phone, the flashing light not helping in the locating process in the slightest. It could always just be spam, and Steve would have quite a few choice words in case it was (he hadn’t needed anyone to explain to him that all those ‘Work from home for a thousand bucks a day!!!’ mails were complete rubbish- and he had a couple more words for those crooks who thought duping innocent people and giving them false hope was somehow acceptable)- but Tony’s spam filters were nigh supernatural; the man was a bragger, but also undeniably a Midas with anything remotely electro-
“Was so sure,” He can hear his voice reverberate off the floor, more of a croak than anything– “tha’ I wasn’ gonna leave you this time.”
.” Steve cut through unconcernedly, like his default good manners weren’t good enough for Tony. “It’s strategy based. I can tell.”
Tony’s features twisted into a disbelieving scowl, and Steve had to resist the urge to throw his hands up into the air. “Governments have agendas, we’ve been over this before-“
Not that there was an astonishing wealth of silence greeting his words – to add insult to injury, Tony could discern the faint, peppy tones of some cell phone game playing in the background. The xylophone was unmistakable. So was the blond head bent over a minuscule screen; the only visible body part peeping over the back of the ginormous team couch in an otherwise unoccupied room.
The lines breaking around his mouth pointed towards him being in his fifties at least, maybe more judging by liver spots and blemishes.
“A world where the distribution of power isn’t staggeringly unequal. Where groups of people aren’t free to make decisions that impact the rest of the world without any input, just because they were blessed with that power. That they have to answer to…” And Stark’s breathing had barely stepped up at all, words falling swift and fitful, eyes unseeing (and he’d known it, even on the plane. How had he known it?) “They have to answer to another power, but we won’t call it a higher one because this hypothetical world doesn’t have fatalistic concentrations of….yeah you guessed it, fucking power, in any one place, be it shadowy spy organisations or a Security Council or
“Your one-dimensional opinion of me is much appreciated, Clint.” Natasha says lightly. Poor sod. He’s going to get eaten tonight.
Steve shoved his hands into his pockets, straps of his backpack drawing tight on his shoulders. The base of his throat felt tighter. Melbourne was supposed to be different. A place he’d never been to, with no preimages to cloud existing vision, no memories to leech away colour from the present.
“They’re.” Peggy hitched a breath. Cast in unearthly scarlet or no, she still looked like Steve’s best dream. “It hasn’t happened yet, but… they’ll be. They’re.. doing really well.”
The surprise smooths out of Bucky’s features, so does the staidness; he squeezes Steve’s elbow once and for a second, that grin seems alive.
But he was so attuned to Tony’s response, and there was a pause which stretched on too long- and a lack of steadiness there too. “He-“ Tony started, and then grew louder, more out of defensiveness than truth. “He can’t be held captive, and he can’t be allowed to roam the streets. He’s too dangerous.”
His brows were beginning to pull down, a crease forming above the bridge of his nose, his hand twitched with the urge to fast forward to the end of the recording; to see if there actually
“You’re inhaling the skin cells from the feet of your great-great-dead grandpa.” Tony observed, if only to drown out the death throes of the mattress squealing under Peter’s knees, and the specs in his head that couldn’t seem to stop-
He doesn’t know if she reads the last paragraph. His vision is too blurry, there’s a track something wet has left down his cheek, and it itches. Steph is dry eyed, and she keeps looking at him. Unvarying, constant…because she’s strong, because she’s the Captain, because she’s granite and lead and titanium and fuck knows what; because he never cried for himself or his parents but with every drop of wetness that creeps past his lids, it’s like he can watch the pressure strapped across her back ease inch by inch-watch her chest rise and fall and see her breathe in for him in turn.
And that built frame sidestepped him and walked away, door swinging open and shut behind Tony’s back not seconds later. Tony stood still, hands flexing inwards and out, trying to absently figure if the emotion curling through his gut was regret.
The light in Steve’s eyes changed, banked heat dissipating in the face of something softer, brighter. Turned out, his soldier was more of a sentimental snot than a possessive one.
and Steve didn’t say it out loud, but Tony heard it in the breath he held in a second too long. The words that did wind out were slow, and quiet. “And what about the days it doesn’t?”
“But six hours is healthy. Isn’t six hours healthy, FRIDAY?” His head left the pillow, and his feet swung to the side, bare heels settling over warmed floors. They arched and flexed, then flattened completely as he pulled himself up to his feet, moving automatically to the expansive windows. “I haven’t seen 5 am on the right side since……ever, really.”
Peter, for his part, looked back at him with steady dark eyes like he’d heard anything else other than a man in his forties concocting nonsense out of bullshit. Then, without a sound, he pressed a hand to the surface of the wall he’d just slid hopelessly down against, and began crawling up the surface like his feet were magnets.
And then he cocked his head to the side, ears pricking up. “The rain seems to have stopped.” The smile returned. “Would you like to go outside?”
Man, but I have principles.” And it wasn’t even the banter that made his chest rumble in satisfaction, really. Ten years ago, Natasha wouldn’t have absently acquiesced to the Black Widow being a hero, forget drawing comparisons to Iron Man.
anything in there or maybe he’d just been giving himself an ulcer for no reason- but the move aborted before it could even properly begin.
The smile disappeared under that moronic moustache. Good. “As amusing as these conversations always are…”
“Yeah.” Something breathed, using his voice. Tony let his head tilt back, fall with a clunk against the door, eyes seeing things millions of lifetimes and just a couple of weeks away.
Tony stuck the heels of his palms into his eyelids, kneading till they felt satisfyingly raw. Even at the peak of his post Battle of New York nightmares, they had never felt… quite like this. “Forget it, I was mostly kidding anyway.”
Tony drew the crisp air in, lungfuls of cool breath that were exhaled just as quietly. The city seemed muted, but like everyone was merely asleep – like New York was teetering on the cusp of opening its eyes. The only sounds that reached his ears were that of the suit: flex, release and clank as he took one step after the next. He wasn’t wearing his helmet. It would’ve seemed incongruous had it been his nanite suit, but this was the Mark VII armour.
“It was…” Natasha paused, because she was better than him, and wanted to pick the right words. She always did, which was the single most frustrating thing because they were the right ones for the ears listening. Never her. “It was a source of safety. Companionship. Purpose.”
“Four hundred and seventeen if you want to count today – but yep.” Rhodey’s eyes were still fixated on his precious baby designs, but there was something softly pleased about that tone nonetheless. “The closest we came to a code green was when some space surfer dudes slipped past the Guardians – the Avengers were ready and waiting topside, but SHIELD Helicarriers showed up outta nowhere and shot them out of the sky before they could even make planetfall.”
Steve fell into step beside him, matching every length of Tony’s stride. The breeze caught stray, sweat-sodden strands of his hair, made them dance about his forehead in entrancing motions. Caught the contortions of his voice too, brought the quietly enunciated words over to Tony’s ears. “Eye of Agamotto? Or Mind Stone?”
Natasha pressed her lips together. She released them on a soundless exhale, and he could feel her eyes trace his face. Her voice didn’t waver, words simplistic. “Why are you mad at me?”
Right across the faceplate. A deafening clang…then nothing. The blank eyeslits of the Iron Man armour stared back, unaffected.
“Thought.” The next words were unbearably hard to get out, the burn flickering at the hollow of his throat. Steve struggled through it, single-minded, like every asthma attack, every bully’s fist, every bullet and hit that had ever threatened to keep him down and never succeeded. “Thought tha… that was a… fella’s name.”
It was incomprehensible, Steve thought, eyes flickering from head to toe of the statue, to think of the hands that had shaped this, that had mimicked delicate folds of silk and brocade in cold metal. The intricacies of the necklace that hung heavy on that neck, the anklets that curved around delicate feet. The expression. So peaceful, so benign. A smooth wide forehead, high, arching brows shaped like the bend of a bow. Thick lips pulled into the gentlest of curves, closed eyelids looking within. The statue had many heads: one facing forward, one back, one each on the right and left. There was a towering headdress made of more heads yet, looking to all four directions, each terraced layer growing smaller and smaller but with the same peaceful expression on his face.
God, he looked so grim. Hair turned completely white, straight-jawed. The Howard from back in Steve’s time would have spluttered his drink all over his collar, if he’d seen this. He’d probably still be buzzed that he didn’t lose all his hair with age though, the vain prat. And it wasn’t like he’d changed completely. The way he interacted with the teenager on screen- that snark was still there.
It was the softest sound, softer than rain running down a leaf, or silk brushing against human skin. Spider legs, scratching against glass as a critter crawled up a window. He’d emerged into an entirely new world of sound after the serum.
The hurt hadn’t left, but had morphed maybe – from a sharp, cleaving pain in his chest to something more bearable. It was the throb of a shoulder dislocated, hollow and jarring and faintly terrifying – except there was a sudden thud of Kevlar against concrete, and Steve was kneeling by his side, stroking bare fingers over the same lines that Tony’s hands were following. Tony blinked and looked away, but not fast enough to stop the ache
In a set of pastels, blocky and chalky-soft and colour staining on his fingertips – always the pop of red towards the end that his gaze drifted to, where it lingered. The colour that could change the very way you looked at things – like when sunrise lit the tenements of Brooklyn in rose-gold-cinnabar, gleaming off bicycle pedals that used to look dusty and camouflaging the cracks in sour-cream building walls, clothes left over on the lines at night flapping gently in the wind – like filtering it all through this shade could alter reality itself.
They moved onward. The room opened up-it was definitely a room now, made clear by the brush of moving air against his prickly skin and the dance of ghostly lights over walls and ceilings as Iron Man moved this way and that. Sam raised a finger to tap over his visor-it wasn’t night vision per se, but the basic infrared sensors indicated the lack of anything remotely living within a mile of this point. Which was absolutely no reason to relax one’s guard, warrens like these messed with sensors more than anything else.
It sliced through the air, cutting parallel to the floor and hitting straight across the centre of the reactor case-hard enough to take off human and armoured heads. It ricocheted cleanly off, shield flying several metres before landing with a clatter, edge shrieking against concrete loud enough to wake the dead.
, caught in the fuzzy reflection in the plates; Tony whirled around, thundering heart and wrists taut in the reflexive gesture that summoned the latest suit.
“Rules serve men Rogers, not the other way round.” Tony smiled again, and it was mirthless; but at least it was still there. “While we should probably hammer out the details at some point- you’re still a fugitive and I’m still the government’s poster boy. Better get going. Pretty Nature won’t keep out the blood-sucking fiends, a la journalists forever.”
Tony doesn’t leer at Stephanie Rogers when he first meets her, as much as he knows that doing so would throw her off, make her back up a couple steps. He’s heard accounts of how frail she was before the Serum, and not many people would openly hit on an intimidating, overly muscled Captain America. She wouldn’t be used to it, it would work. She would stop engaging with him, disgust apparent in those furiously blue eyes and speak only when necessary. It would be easy, too easy.
“Sure.” Tony drawls, and Stephanie flushes a little and ducks her head. That was…unexpected, he always made fun of Cap, that’s how their little relationship worked…though now that he thought about it, she never really disclosed many non-Cap related parts of herself-Tony, you tactless idiot.
“Fine.” Steve was exhausted. He hadn’t seen any action in weeks, and was finally going to get some, and the point he’d been trying to make and fight for
And Steve had a million words bursting on the tip of his tongue- all the ways he could have shared information earlier, all the ways he could have trusted better. The way
“Kay, J. Peace.” Another slight click, the call disconnecting. ‘Hang on’. Modern slang sounded so odd in that old-fashioned, British register. It was the same like with Ste-
“Step forward,” Iron Man said, instead-and Sam did it, not thinking of how floodlights could pour on them at any second, the click of a hundred rifles arming themselves, the blare of a foghorn asking him to put his hands up and surrender, a set of handcuffs ready to snap on his wrists and toss him back to the bottom of the ocean.
The red-and-gold gleamed dully in the gloam, like the last remnants of a sunset that had long disappeared into the indigo sky. Next to it, the burnished grey of gun-metal was barely visible.
“Possibly.” Iron Man assented, and walked forward. A building whine, and Sam barely had two seconds to prepare himself before a deafening
“Bodhisattva of compassion.” Steve read on. “Bodhisattva is an enlightened being who stays on earth to help…” a pause, barely noticeable, “people escape the cycle of life, death and rebirth.”
The game soundly rebuked them for throwing away their life like that, what with being the only self-aware piece of bread in existence on the planet and all. Steve looked positively enthralled.
A thud, then a loud clatter – someone groaned, and the heat signature faded down back to red, slumping flat to the floor. Something large and oval-esque rolled out from around the bottom corner of the counter, and settled down on the floor with a teeth-rattling clank.
from the team because of you. I’d ask you to stop being self-absorbed and pull your head out of your ass, except that would be belabouring the point since by sticking your head up your ass you are literally self-ab–”
“I appreciate it, Mr Stark.” Tony looked up, lost as he was among his ever-expanding mire of regrets, and saw the boy’s eyes practically shining with determination. It was…..it was a little awe-inspiring, really. “I can’t tell you how
“She told me…she told me I needed to allow Bucky the dignity of his choice.” So fond, despite it all. Desperately fond. “Sometimes I wonder if she used to tell herself that, after the plane went down.”
“I.” He cleared his throat. God, what had he even been thinking. FRIDAY was amazing, and nothing like Ultron. Even though his ‘worrying’ behaviour over the last weeks had nothing to do with this pattern of thought.
- and he looked back up at that small screen where he was seeing Tony Stark’s face for the first time since he’d brought the shield down on the reactor and seen Tony’s face snarling in rage and hurt and….and what? What?
“Well, it’s time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton’s book…build Pepper a farm. Hope nobody blows it up.”
“It’s…” not nothing, Steve waltzing into battle with naught but the clothes on his back was not nothing, but it was hard to argue with Steve when his face looked so droopy. “You didn’t have your shield on you.”
Natasha blinked. “Do not tell me you’ve come here to take up my extremely limited, government-sanctioned time for a
Repulsor shots took care of both of them, bodies hitting the floor in successive thumps. He took a second to confirm their life signals still flashing on the HUD. Down but not out, yay healing factors. Even as the smoke trails cleared from the air, something began beeping insistently on Tony’s systems – a smeared blob of colour, resolving to a half-hidden heat signature behind the counter. It mounted steadily from red to orange to yellow, finally going bluish around the edges. The explosion would take out the whole building, Tony needed a clear shot
“I’ll go inside and take the one by the counter, keep an eye for the other two.” Steve didn’t miss a beat, not
“You seem like you know a lot about us.” Everyone did. All those splashes in the papers, the gigantic headlines. Captain America and Iron Man, standing back to back against a portal opening in the sky. Captain America and Iron Man, gauntleted fist against vibranium shield, while an airport burned in the background.
hand stretching out to skim over the chrome finish of the nearest Bugatti absentmindedly. He still missed the vast, labyrinthine layout of his Malibu workshop, but he hadn’t done too bad for himself here. His gaze turned to the other wall, flitting from one suit to the next as he slowly drifted onward; there were enough armours for a gallery exhibit, easy. He’d gut them of all proprietary tech first, obviously, keep the outer shells. Tell the gallery people to play some ZZ Top over the speakers – maybe like a cello cover of
That wouldn’t matter though. This was Pepper he was talking about. She’d keep her feelings out of it, and do the right thing. So he matched her gaze, just as steady, and held it throughout as she spoke without as much as a segue way-
. The way they all laughed at each other, laughed at themselves, secure of their place in their friends’ hearts. The way they fell so easily in step: two forward, and two back again, like that was how they’d grown, in and around each other, vines twining close and comfortable. Bracing each other’s backs, falling into their negative spaces, carving out a place that was just their own. Making a home.
Another pause. Steve looked up, and Sam’s steady gaze looking back made him feel…..small, somehow. “To tell you the truth, Steve, I don’t know what any of us would or wouldn’t do anymore.”
I’ve watched you, Steve thinks hazily – watched you raise a child, watched you be blissfully married, watched you speak to Howard, father to father, and dole out more understanding than he deserved, and let me walk you away from your pristine life and give me more trust than I had ever earned. I watched the silver grow from the temples of your head to the longer hair-strands, to the scrub of your goatee, up to the fleck of your brows. And the longer I keep watching you now, the more I know I’m watching someone else.
Steve cast a final eye over the ocean, grim and tumultuous and unchangeable. Something settled in his chest, and it wasn’t cold lead. “Call me Steve.”
“What does the description say?” Sam seemed to have gained better control over his rampant amusement.
He finally straightened up, completely, and blinked blearily at the sight around him. His workshop had no lights on, no illumination but from some of the holograms that were still powering through old calculations. No sounds, apart from the ambient beeps. Five minutes, it had taken him, to stand up. The floor was probably still littered with ceramic shards.
“Yeah yeah, I’ve gotten the party line, you can see yourself out now.” Tony muttered. The forgotten water bottle was sweaty in his grasp.
“Come in!” Peter squeaked, backing up rapidly away from the door as if Tony was a wight that would vanish at the slightest delay or provocation- except his ankle clearly wouldn’t stand for it. Balance was lost, and his arms flailed and pinwheeled around as his scrawny body tipped back, landing with an ‘oof!’- and Tony found himself staring down at a seventeen year old sitting on his butt in the foyer of his apartment, gawking right back at him
So yeah. It’s one of his old exes on some morning show grasping for TRP’s, and Tony stops because he’s trying to figure out if she’s lying about the vanilla sex or lying about being an ex in the first place because with that IQ and that mole, he really doesn’t see himself…though memory has been faulty in the past what with all the substance abuse…hm, it’s been a while since he dated now that he thinks about it-
Ross didn’t argue further; Tony almost hated him for that. Wasn’t that what sharks did-swoop in for the kill when they smelt blood in the water? But there he stood, fingers deforming the plastic bottle in his grip, breathing heavy and blood leaking from the unseen cuts slashed upon his person, while Ross just…backed away. Footsteps drawing into the distance just as easily as they had approached, a door swinging shut, the Facility all emptied out again. Words left hanging in the air.
“Right.” Sam’s words were as buoyant as ever. There was still something churning in Steve’s gut though, deep and unsettling- like once it started, it wasn’t stopping easily.
“Of course, I understand comple- I’m sorry, charges dropped?” Steve was all aboard on the train of placation, but those words were too grabbing not to demand further elaboration.
A second more, to let himself hurt- and then Tony pulled that unnatural smile right back where it belonged. “New doodads.”
No. By the time Steve received the one recording that started before Tony entered the BARF, instead of during- his motivations had become all too apparent. Watching the gritted teeth, the whitened complexion, the quickened breaths, the hand gripped over his chest and the muttered, “Fucking
Another eloquent burst of sound – holy Brian Johnson, patron saint of rock and sinners everywhere, was that a
“So you don’t think that all that’s best of dark and bright meet in DUM-E’s aspect?” It’s a very, very shabby joke, but Stephanie is smiling a little tremulously and looking shaken for reasons Tony can’t yet comprehend. He still can’t stop smiling.
“What? List of ill-rehearsed platitudes?” Tony barked a laugh, razor-edged and humourless. It emerged as a jarring crack of dissonance over Iron Man’s speakers. “
It would have been convenient, for some sort of snarky commentary to float past Tony’s head right now, but his mind was blank. Steve breathed again, soft and so very careful. “I made it up to my navel, the last time.”
Not that it would take much to decimate this bed. Peter shifted a bit to the side and the springs emitted another ghastly squeak. His feet were still waving around the air like berserk severed appendages. Tony twitched.
that and we don’t make excuses.” It all sounded so…inexcusably simple, narrated by a man who knew through time-tested experience how much it wasn’t. And there was at least one other person here today who knew it too. Tony cleared his throat, soft and uncharacteristically unobtrusive. “We’ve lived with the best and worst in each other. And I love her.’”
“No.” Tony lied, eyes skimming over the little screen mounted in the device he’d fished out in a millisecond. His shoulders were already beginning to curl up in tension, the lightness in his chest dissipating as fast as it had appeared. The words weren’t anything he hadn’t seen before, but that didn’t stop them from being ominous.
Perhaps it’s wisdom, perhaps just a bitter kind of understanding; but Tony knows now he didn’t grow up an unloved child. In ways, that’s been the hardest thing to reconcile with. Maria, Howard…even Obie. Tony’s entire life has been a portrait of the cruelties inflicted despite of…because of the veneer of love. And it hasn’t been a one-way street. Who better than Pepper Potts to tell you that Tony Stark’s love could cut deeper than it healed?
Sam stared at him point blank, as if refusing to believe his…..moronic-ness, or some other new-fangled word for thick in the head. “It’s a little weird.”
He snorted into his towel, drying his face rigorously. He didn’t remember this bit, from the dream. Had he asked about Amazon at all? God, he didn’t retain mundane details even when he wasn’t trying to pry them back from the jaws of the Sandman.
Stark blinked at him again. “Al..alright.” And then, like a rush of words falling one over the other, “This whole ‘conviction-in-other-people’ thing you have going on. Very impressive. I can almost understand your rising popularity.”
“Jealousy doesn’t suit you, Nat.” The words escaped Clint’s lips, like they were apt to. He regretted it almost immediately, which was ironic for the conversation.
Then there were smoke trails in the air, and hissing in his ear – and screaming, so much screaming. Copper in his mouth, tongue swollen and lolling out, Afghanistan in his head; sharp things, pieces of fire, tearing into his skin and pulling his insides out.
echoing quietly in the otherwise deserted washroom. Noise still rumbled faintly from the outside, the usual clamour of a kebab joint in Midtown at noon, for all that robots had hit the avenue two blocks over and the Avengers had thrashed their asses soundly. New Yorkers were a resilient species.
“You had said something, once. I don’t remember to whom, or when. Maybe to Bruce.” Steve fixed his eyes on the same horizon that Tony’s were scoping so intently. “It was something about how hating yourself was the first step to being a good person. How goodness requires a deep, intense self-loathing.” He exhaled, air whistling out past his teeth. “Because the only way for the fickle human mind to be good is to guilt yourself into it. And the second you do start believing in your own goodness….you lapse again.”
have live access to the NGV security footage. Steve knew this. Didn’t stop his neck from getting all twitchy.
Tony was supposed to make fun of them-everyone knows he’s laid claim to nerd of the group, and literary nerds are stupid nerds anyway-and then they were supposed to move on and talk about more important things. But Rog-
A second of silence. Then, FRIDAY’s voice filtering through quietly, “Bleeding Edge integrity at hundred percent.”
A breath, brushing past the stillness. Like conviction finally emerging again, settling into its long-worn shoes.
“That tendency gets problematic, on opposing sides.” Tony murmured, eyes calm and knowing. “But we’re on the same team. A team of superheroes. And we kicked ass today.”
“Always a way out... you know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.”
“Dramatic British squawking, very nice. Very John Oliver.” But Steve wasn’t done jabbing. The merry music continued.
“It’s not the same.” He protests, but Steph is walking ahead with that little quirk to her lip and Tony doesn’t want to sound like a fifteen-year old but all he’s thinking is
Ross’ smile possibly curved up into something real; Tony couldn’t care less. “I hope you do. In the wake of all the powered…outlaws, of late, we need to reassure the public, affirm our faith in being able to work with these individuals. Nothing does that better than putting one at the head of a newly reformed SHIELD.”
Memory-Tony took a long time to speak. When he did, his voice was wiped of emotion too, even if the words were slow in coming. “…Barnes? The Winter Soldier? The one who you- when SHIELD fell-“
And the journey had been worth every staggering step. Learning to love this man was and continued to be one of the most educational experiences Tony had ever had – in maturity, patience, empathy, humility, faith, understanding, self-worth. As much as it was a struggle, loving Steve was also a foregone conclusion, but if they hadn’t met… “I don’t think I’d have liked who I was, if we hadn’t met.”
?” Clint’s tone melded seamlessly with his words, flat and furious. “Couldn’t the fighting have come
“I wouldn’t go about sharing the gratitude just yet.” Tony’s lip curled- and that, was that, really.
That jaw grew tighter. Rhodey turned his eyes from the images, expression barely keeping to patience. “Look, we don’t have time to talk about thi-”
It is in the little things. Natasha’s surprised blink when Steve brings her a peanut butter sandwich, the hollow silence when he curses on the comms and no one chimes the L-word back at him.
And her long fingers cover the reactor, and it’s only when she drops her gaze to it that Tony realises how long she’d been looking at him, just him. “Like a star.” Steph breathes, almost in wonder.
Steve stared back at Tony, at the hard, flashing eyes that seemed right out of a memory and a nightmare, but he couldn’t move his tongue to speak.
Measured footsteps followed in his trail as he stalked across the living area, heading towards the kitchenette. Once the refrigerator was opened and water bottle withdrawn, the urge to rest his brow against the cool surface of the door was overpowering-Tony resisted the urge, and kept off the scowl threatening to overtake his face with supreme effort. He had a
“They’re shiny. Silver.” Tony says, bruised eyes, dim with a kind of terror Steve has lived through first-hand. “These big, heaving whales in the air… and everything else is dark. All of you are dead.”
Rhodey’s mouth primmed itself into a forbidding line. He noticed- of course, he noticed. “The old nightmare again?”
“Fourth.” FRIDAY corrected, starting up the morning headlines in a helpful feed on the mirror-screen instead. “Miller commented on the call that at this rate, the very least I could do was go to dinner with him.”
“You don’t need to psychoanalyse me, Nat.” Clint didn’t blink at all. He stared at the small jars on the counter, glass with metal tops, screwed on tight, filled with sticky jam. One, two, three. “You can just ask.”
“Wifi permitting, of course.” Sam conspicuously paused, shades of seriousness seeping into his tone. “You gonna be alright, yeah?”
“Excellent.” Tony cut across with brusque efficiency, proffering a hand. Peter took it and propelled himself up- a vast improvement from the first time Tony had offered a handshake and Peter had poked at it to see if his finger would pass through like that of a ghost. “We can swap stories then.”
“It’s…less about winning,” and Tony wanted to cut him off immediately, but Steve so rarely begun new threads of conversation. It seemed important, somehow, to wait this one out. Pink lips flickered, pressing on themselves momentarily before continuing. “And more about being…good,” and cue eyeroll, no, bad Tony,
It seemed to help though, something in Steve’s shoulders seeming to screw loose, eyes skittering over Tony’s face like he hadn’t seen it in a while. Which was ridiculous, because Tony was on
“I’ll find them.” Steve affirms. Clint nods, and walks back to the van, where Cooper sticks his head out of the open windowpane and gets his hair ruffled teasingly for his efforts.
He laughs. It emerges from his chest in short, stuttered bursts, and it hurts his reactor a little, but it feels so good. Behind, he hears a little hitch of sound; and he turns, and Stephanie is standing with marker ink on her fingernails, standing and staring and looking a little breathless even though he’s the one laughing.
raised his eyes, and turned to fix those dark irises on Steve. It was like a physical blow, and Steve barely kept himself from flinching- if there hadn’t been a trickle of triumph at the fact that Tony was finally facing him.
“I’m here on exchange, actually.” Steve returned primly. There was a rustle of static from his earphones-an audible sigh like he’d entirely missed the point. “And I’m pretty sure nothing can kill me in a gallery.”
“I’m not taking care of you.” The words escaped too fast, too direct. Tony watched the waving hands still, the light in Peter’s eyes shutter.
Sky-blue tee, beige chinos. No shield. Steve emerged from his uninspiring position of cover, jogging over to Tony with a face that brightened as it got closer.
“It’s stunning.” Tony said unthinkingly; and fuck backseat designing and banter and Rhodey’s smug little smirk anyhow, because it
Well, Stephanie certainly seems buoyed by that. “Poetry reminds me of…people.” She continues, flush persistent but with renewed determination. “It’s less the words and more of the overall… feel of it. Their ideology seems to match the person’s. I don’t know.”
Hands all wiped clean, Steve crumpled the soggy paper into a small ball. Paused for a second, then dabbed the soapy tap head spotless too. Tony sighed. “For fuck’s sake Cap, if you care so much about your bathroom routine, you can’t be entirely indifferent to your terrible dynamics with a teammate. We just saved the world, numero tres, for heaven’s sake.”
-“ and Tony could feel his lips curve up as naturally as anything, god- Peter reminded him how easy it used to be.
No. No it wasn’t. Because he wasn’t just a self-sacrificing moron judging the healthiness of Steve’s choices; he was selfish enough not to fuck up the first real progress he’d made with Steve by fucking Steve. Oh sure, sex wasn’t the devil. Sex was a good way to establish a line of communications, oftentimes. It was just that with Tony, that also tended to be the end of the road.
A creak, as gloved fingers dug forcefully into hard leather, knuckles pressing at the seams. “And the world would be saved, and the world would celebrate. And I’d be left here, still wanting. Talking. To empty air, to a stone in the ground.” A crack of thunder in the distance. “To a patch of earth six feet under.”
When the fire died down, two goons with slightly-smoking clothing were gawping back at him. Tony raised his arms up wide. “And now I’ve thrown you off your rhythm.”
The air pumped through his chest, hard and heavy, throat dry with gasping. His hands were braced on his thighs, view obscured to the gap between them – sweat-slick fringe whipping in his eyes when he bent over and tried to regain his breath.
“Shield.” Ross said, and Tony’s chest cavity might not have existed at all. Everything seemed to have collapsed inwards, and the ability to draw air and breathe seemed to be lost in the bargain.
“Was that an ‘old, useless relic’ dig?” Tony approximated a glare to the best of his ability. “And after all I did for you when you were a midget.”
“No.” Natasha said simply, and the press of her hand against his was not a lie. Reddened as they were, her eyes still looked peaceful. “It was nice. Like a warmth in my chest, of… getting to throw aside all that my life had been used for, and choosing what it was going to mean.”
But Steve wasn’t going to say that. He wasn’t going to mention the twelve months that Tony had spent in limbo, living in a Tower with an ‘A’ brandished across the top, that didn’t house any Avengers in it. Wasn’t going to mention the too-frequent gear and tech updates that just happened to make their way to the upstate Facility, even as Tony repeatedly bowed out of get-togethers and team dinner invites. Instead, he was going to press his lips into a thin line, remaining conspicuously silent every time Rhodey or Nat joked about Tony being kicked out of the team.
Finally, finally an exhale. Steve raised his eyes, stopped smiling. “Time doesn’t help, Tony. Forgetting does.”
“I didn’t see him tonight.” Sam didn’t lose a single beat, voice maintained at the same, even cadence. There wasn’t much eye contact to be established, when you couldn’t see the other person’s eyes. “Or you. The helmet…hides more than it-”
“But that day in Siberia,” Train of thought abruptly terminated, Tony blinked up at Steve, caught off-guard despite it all. Something soft and acrimonious curved Steve’s lips, though his eyes looked bleak. “I got the answers I was looking for.”
Tom hadn’t stopped looking at him, gaze keen and acute. And…sombre, in the strangest way. “The army won’t…ask for permission. Whoever you…they’ll be safe. Don’t worry.”
“I…understand.” He tasted the word, tasted the coarse sand on his tongue. It was so cloudy, but he could see out to the sea for miles. “More…rightly. I can’t.” An exhale, tossed away in the howl of the wind. “I suppose that was the point.”
Except…..that wasn’t quite right, was it. The man on screen had no suit on. A dark-coloured shirt obscured his arms till his wrists, grey sneakers peeked beneath washed out jeans. His shoulders were down, his chin lowered, and he walked on and on, as the residents of –what borough was that anyway? The Bronx? Queens?- passed him unseeing; with only about one in ten doing a double take and turning their heads to watch the lone figure trace his way through the streets of New York.
Rhodes was ducking under Tony’s elbow now, hand raised to his brows, looking hither and thither in exaggerated ‘I can’t find you’ motions. Tony stood at his back, back of his hand pressed to his forehead in parodied distress. The other couples had pulled back to the periphery, clapping and cheering, the blonde with the purple lined waistcoat catcalling the loudest. Tony and Rhodes turned around together, eyes widening dramatically in ‘there you are!’, stepping back close again. The saxophone piped high, drums flourishing in not too far behind, and Tony jigged his butt to the beat; Rhodes covering his face with a hand, forehead sinking to his friend’s shoulder, overcome with laughter.
because of you. All of that, and still I’ve never been fucking prouder of you than I have in the last six months.”
And those kicks. Perfectly angled, perfectly practiced. Nothing natural about them at all. He moved his hips too much, didn’t crouch nearly enough. This kind of dancing wasn’t supposed to be for the elegant folk, even while they did their dancing too. This was supposed to be about kicking back with a buddy after a hard day of work at the offices, or down by the docks; swing by the dance halls, step on a pretty dame’s toes. Not to present and
He takes a final right turn and brings the car to a halt, turning off the ignition, setting the gear stick to neutral and yanks the handbrake. He slowly releases his hold on the clutch and brake pedals, setting his feet in the gap between them.
Steve smiled into Tony's mouth before licking his lips and pressed a line of kisses down the front of Tony's neck, eliciting more gasps and loud moans from the smaller man as he grinded harder against Steve's hard on and dug his feet harder into the back of the super-soldier's thighs, using his knees to get leverage.
He destroyed his relationship with Steve, countless times when he walked in drunk off his ass, not even remembering what happened.
Steve, being the smart ass he is, knows exactly where Tony is but he's not going to give the genius exactly what he wants without a little delay.
They kissed long and hard, and at one point they involved tongue, sweeping into each other's mouths with furious passion and lust, with Steve leaning against the railing and Tony draped over his front, their hands roaming to explore each others frame where Steve rested his at the small of Tony's back and Tony rested his on Steve's broad chest. Tony tasted like whiskey and coconuts, an unusual but enticing combo as their breaths mingled when they panted into each others mouth. After they had finished playing tonsil hockey, Tony looked up at Steve's face and framed it in his hands adoringly almost devotedly and gave him a chaste peck before resting his head on Steve's heart. The gesture sent butterflies fluttering within Steve's gut as he wrapped his arms around Tony protectively as they slowly slid to the ground, in perfect embrace.
At one point during his instatement speech, Steve was lost looking at Tony, trying to absorb as much as he said but he ended up staring at his face and his hands- their animated movement trying to bring out whatever he was speaking about to life - their movements, beautiful and fluid.
Tony cradles his head in his hand as he breaks down in earnest. Every sob and every tear feeling long overdue as they jolt through him, leaving him breathless and gasping in between outbursts of sobs.
He can hear faint voices dishing out news or rules or instructions or murmuring amongst themselves, about mundane topics which would, never in a million years, pique his interest.
The car whizzes to a halt in the basement, as the tires screech slightly because of the sudden brakes applied.
He remembers the entire three weeks when he fell apart, the pungent odour of whiskey emanating from him and the taste of tobacco coating his insides, all while his beloved was on a "business trip". Tony couldn't even process the information and he suppressed it as long as he could, willing himself to stay only for Peter. Untill Peter goes off to college. Yes, he could make that sacrifice for his child and his well-being. He had to; Peter was the BIGGEST blessing Tony has ever begotten and he knew he'd push through this for his sake.
He can't leave so unceremoniously, without explanation or reason. Guilt rises within him as he thinks he's just walking out but the rage reminds him this is far too easy of a punishment for the other man's actions. Hell it's not even punishment to be honest.
"I sent this to Wakanda because I don't know where exactly you are right now but I do know that you were there. I just hope you get this as quickly as you can because I want to get this over with. You don't need to be here for the hearing.  And don't worry, no one's going to prosecute you or try to hunt you down because it's the family lawyer taking care of this for us.
Steve's head snaps back to Bucky, who's now grinning menacingly into the empty space. He turns to glower at Steve, who just blinks at him sheepishly.
"I don't know whether you and Tony are unhappy or whatever it is but you don't have the right to play him like this. Not after twenty three years of marriage.
Steve got used to it gradually as Tony just advised him not to pay attention at all. Being the sap he was, he just told Tony that all his attention was on him anyway, sending a hot blush down Tony's olive toned skin as he writhed under Steve's intent gaze.
Steve looks at the wound before perking his eyes up at Tony and oh my god, Tony feels part disgust and part cute aggression.
"Tony, just say you're scared to pick up the phone. I know Steve is nothing like that and you're just finding reasons to not answer."
He drags a large suitcase from the lower racks and throws it on the bed, beginning to unzip it throughout its length and tosses the flap open into the empty cuboid.
Steve brimmed with so much pride and love that he just keels forward and places a long, deep kiss on Tony's beautiful forehead, savoring the contact he's been deprived of for two months.
Tony always wanted to leave hickeys on Steve but they didn't last very long. He sucked a few bruises onto Steve's nipple, his stomach and his neck, smirking triumphantly. He looked up to Steve's brows squiggling in pleasure but his eyes, focused on Tony, reaching out to him. Tony licked a long stripe through the cavern of the blond's  sternum, nipping at the hair along the way and reached his way to the hollow of Steve's throat, kissing reverently.
Tony felt Steve explode in his mouth, as a throaty, gaspy groan escaping the soldier. Salty waves that unloaded in his orifice as he wrapped his mouth tighter around Steve's pulsating length, swallowing every single drop of his husband's spend, diligently. Tony knew he'd be here for a while, for Steve always came an amazing lot and he's just happy here seeing Steve slowly get down from his orgasmic high being of service to him. Tony noises a pop as he releases Steve's softer cock from his mouth when he feels the last pulse of cum and wipes his mouth off it. Tony's expression crosses from bliss to concern - Steve's eyes are dropped low and his breathing is still rapid. It always feels like Steve never fully got rid of his asthma, his breathing hitches or he looks like he's about to hyperventilate but he always reassures Tony he's fine. Tony places his one free hand right above Steve's heart, which Steve encompasses with his own and he can feel Steve's rabbit-speed pulse thundering in his chest. Tony soothes Steve by rubbing gentle circles and massaging the area right above Steve's heart in an attempt to calm him down. Steve reciprocates and evens out his breathing, focusing on the warmth of Tony's hand and relaxes.
Done with the biggest part. It broke me and I started crying halfway through writing this. Yuck, I hate myself.
That elicits a loud chuckle from Tony, his body vibrating through the blanket and rumbling within Rhodey. The chuckle gets louder and louder until Tony's practically laughing at the comment, welling happy tears in the crook of his eyes.
He doesn't care how long it takes, he's going to wait till eternity to confront this bastard and get it over with.
It stretches for quite a while, neither acting nor reacting. It's itchingly deafening and it threatens the very integrity of this setting which already sits at the top of the cliff, precariously.
Tony took in the sight with humour and beamed at Steve, before curling his lips upward like he knew that the man was drinking him in.
He guides his hand on Steve's body to give him support as he lifts himself up slightly, guiding himself closer and places a light kiss on the other man's lips. Steve returns the kiss with the same intensity, before placing a deeper one and sweeping his tongue inside the other man's mouth until the other man pulls apart and huffs a breath of relief.
He did and he is living through that. He always will. He's Tony Stark. Pain and rejection have been a companion in his journey, right from the start.
He rests his hand on the other man's cheek, gently rubbing the five o'clock shadow which stirs him into light wakefulness as he hums in pleasure.
After setting Tony down and wrapping him up in a blanket with a piping hot mug of his favourite pre-mix latte, Rhodey just sits by Tony's side, caressing his shoulder with gentle rubs of consolement. They've become quiet now, well Tony has except for the sniffles and coughs, as he leans against Rhodey and sips on the coffee, occasionally.
Tony chuckles before letting himself go to sleep, to the din of Steve's growing snoring and the thump of his heart.
It's his worst habit, Steve thinks. Staying up this late working himself to sleeplessness. Even though tomorrow is Sunday, Steve knows Tony is working more, trying to distract himself from Peter's absence.
His sleep is always cut short, ever since the army, having gotten used to the unstable cycles of rest they got and the constant edge of having to spring into action, keeping him vigilant.
Steve knows Tony's tricks and decides to play into this game of hide and seek for a while. He places one hand on his hip and smiles down into the floor, chuckling lowly. He draws in a big breath and looks around with feigned marked concentration and focus, his sole intent to find Tony and grab him into his arms and squeeze him like the adorable little bean he was. He missed him so much.
The weight of Tony's actions finally hit him like a bullet train. He rubs the balls of his palm into his wet, aching eyes and licks his lips. He grips the steering wheel hard and leans forward, to rest his head in between his hands as the gravitas of the situation settles on him. I did the right thing, Tony's brain supplies, cajoling him but his heart pangs at the thought of whatever he saw today and how he reacted.
The brunet whined in response and nuzzled his nose into Steve's throat, taking a deep breath before speaking out in a muffled tone:
He runs a hand through his hair, smoothing the strands back and rubs his palms downwards, through the density of his face foliage when the elevator bell dings and the door opens to the penthouse and the super-soldier glances around, striding into the hall.
He hears a sniffle come from the other man causing him to chuckle inwardly, at their unison plight. Guilt wells within him and he almost turns around, but his fat ego stops him. He's not going to give in; not after every thing that conspired on that ill-fated day. He sets his jaw and squares his shoulders, still holding onto the cloth for support; his legs are still wobbling and he fears he might collapse in front of this man and he's absolutely mortified at the thought. He does not want to ever show weakness again, not to the world, not to his loved ones and certainly not to this man.
Tony beamed back at Steve, who's breath hitched in his throat every time he saw those big brown orbs constrict and happy wrinkles fall on Tony's face.
"You stay here. I'll bring in your luggage from the car. And after that, we're gonna have a long movie night and a tonne load of food therapy, ok?"
He would put Peter on his shoulders and clasp his legs so tenderly, as the infant played with his blonde locks.
Steve growled at Tony before he spat again into his cavern and after a few more ministrations of his thumb, the very symbol of all that was pure and good, plucked out his thumb, eyes hooded and locked onto Tony's, while looking like the very definition of sin, sucked on the appendage, smirking at the genius who frankly looked quite taken aback.
Nat barks out the order and Steve simply obeys sheepishly, setting down the croissant and the cup on the table, before swallowing thickly as Natasha watches his every move.
At one point, Tony grabs at Steve's arm, motioning him to stop. Steve feels worried, thinking he's hurt Tony and panic courses through him, replacing his immense libido.
