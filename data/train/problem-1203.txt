John never winked.
John was breathless, watching the beauty of Sherlock coming. Those beautiful raven curls were surrounding the crown of his head in a halo as he threw his head back, those lips releasing the most sinful noises John had ever had the pleasure of hearing. It threw John over the edge, watching Sherlock come undone, spilling into Sherlock, his body doubling forward from the force of it, his world going black. When he came to, held himself on trembling arms over Sherlock who looked entirely blissed out.
,” John said, his voice low and dangers, sending convulsing shockwaves down Sherlock's spine. John pulled back and undid his belt, easily sliding his trousers and pants down until the buckle hit the floor with a loud thud. But that's not what Sherlock was focused on. His eyes were caught on the length and girth of John's cock. It was long, thick, and hard and Sherlock felt his mouth water in anticipation. “I am going to open you up for me. I'm going to make sure you can take all of me so that you can feel me for days. After you're crying and begging for my cock, I'll give it to you. I'll spread you open so that you can feel every inch of me moving inside of you. With every brush against your prostate, you'll be trembling against me when you come for me. I am going to make love to you, Sherlock Holmes. Do you understand?”
<< Are you sure? >> asks him sternly.
<< Shut up! >> shouts the girl, trying to pounce on her brother. Greg springs and, with a speed proven by years of experience, tackles one and enters defense of the other. John and Sherlock look at him in admiration.
<< Or, much more likely, he will blame his wife for what happened by forcing her to end her work and passions >> says Sherlock. William nods resignedly and John gives his partner a stern look.
<< Couldn't we ask Molly to come and get them here? >>.
<< Ok, thank you for the consultation >>.
<< You can not stay here >> she says, pulling up with his nose, a sign of imminent crying.
<< Off the road, Greg. Sherlock ended up out of the way! Someone like him who dies from a banal car accident caused by snow! >> John shouts against the detective's shoulder, who just keeps him on his feet, unable to say anything.
<< You are right, in fact I would not be of any difficulty. I think that it just doesn't be appropriate to do it >> Mycroft says standing up, leaving John speechless. << I've already explained what I think is happening. The sense of guilt is leading you to see in this story much more than trivial there is >>.
In other circumstances, Sherlock would have found this woman's mind fascinating. From what he has been able to notice, that catatonic state seems to be generated by the activation of the synapses in the production of a complex thought. The previous occasions on which Mary suddenly froze, in fact, saw her perform some operations once again to resolve a situation or make a choice, which is visible from the glimmer that Sherlock noticed lighting up in her eyes.
<< A crazy killer >> Sherlock concludes, looking him in the eyes. Mycroft holds his gaze, then takes a sigh and turns him away.
<< Gladly >> John replies and immediately silences the voice that reminds him of why he is there.
All present hold their breath in front of those nonsensical but terribly clear words.
<< He found him behind a bush in Bristol, while we were returning from this last investigation. Don't ask me how he felt him, because I'm asking it too. I saw him run away and, when I went to look for him, he had this little creature in his hands >>.
Suddenly the support of Mary's strong arms is lost and Sherlock falls. He shouts taken by surprise and immediately hits the cold and hard surface of the pit.
<< Immunity is given to me by the simple fact that whatever that woman can say or do ... simply does not exist for me. Who does not exist cannot harm me >>.
<< We solved the criminal investigation >> Sherlock replies.
<< You don't want to talk to the servants first? >> Greg asks him.
"Dying is what people do!" he shouts in his crazy voice and then chuckles satisfied. "A quick blow and you will get rid of her presence forever" entices him and the hand increases its grip around the handle.
<< I miss my violin >> he sobs, squinting eyes that shed more tears.
Chapter 5
<< Who do you tell about your nightmares to? >> Sherlock asks in amazement, since he has never felt any other living soul present in the house.
“What a first time! I have been absent several times in these six months, spending the night out often and he must have taken the opportunity to take home who knows who! ".
They walk slowly through the front door of the hotel, John leading the way and Sherlock immediately behind.
<< Because you would be even more in danger than you already are if we really decided to ... >>.
<< It seems to me more than anything else that you come to help us when you can >>.
<< I was an asshole, Sherlock >> he whispers. << I ... I could go back I wouldn't say anything. Not even one of the absurd words I said on Sunday morning. I ... I kicked the best thing that ever happened to me and I'm sorry. I'd like to ask you to forgive me and give me a second chance, but ... Jesus, I wouldn't give it to myself. I was afraid of losing you. It was very bad >> he says, sobs. << I'm happy to know you are alive and ... that's enough for me >>.
"I lied to you too."
"It's on the nightstand," he heard a familiar voice and with calculated movement, Sherlock reached for the glass filled with water.
Oh God…
His love for Sherlock was his
I finally open my mouth, I am not sure which words are going to leave them but I do it anyway. It's okay, Sherlock. I've come to terms with my feelings towards you. It's okay, even if I am just a friend to you...
doesn’t matter anymore because
Sherlock jumped on his feet, ignoring the blurred vision and started moving and relocating all his stuff, trying to find his
Suddenly I am mad at him. Is this the best he can do? Sentence you to death in the middle of nowhere, without anyone caring about you by your side?
pool, where Moriarty turned John into a Christmas tree with explosives all over his torso. His voice, so calm, so smooth it almost made him puke, drilling through his ear making his whole temporal lobe vibrate with disgust.
The doctor finally stopped and sat on the bed, not meeting Sherlock's gaze.
"I'm not angry with you."
to rot away in London by himself!
The feeling was sobering at first but then turned into something rather familiar to Sherlock. Something better than he remembered.
don't understand, I am not that clever.
"I would be in this position anyway, John. I had a case," I flinch. Why are you justifying her actions?
I want to hold your hand while we drive taxi to the next location, where Greg Lestrade is already awaiting us, standing by the police tape, scratching his head.
around London. That's the first guess of John’s confused brain- that Sherlock was never planning on leaving and once again let him feel like an empty shell. An utter cock, he was.
, all those lies, the deception of perfectly normal life, happy marriage.
"The bloody dress, the flowers, the maids, the place, the food, everything so bloody perfect! So fucking perfect, wasn't it John?" ignoring Mycroft's presence maybe even not acknowledging it, he stood up abruptly, throwing everything on the floor, stomping on it. "How did you like my speech, huh? How did you like my love confession, wrapped up in the Best Man's speech, did you enjoy it?
"Nothing, I checked twice."
And silence.
Before/ (After?) John
Mycroft was already in the sitting room, with his creased jacket laying on his thighs, umbrella in his hand.
It's my turn to take a few steps back or else I will end up under wheels of your aeroplane. Well, you are a Drama Queen, you would love the symbolism.
. I would like to call you that when we are alone, it feels personal. But you are leaving and I will never call you by your real name. Shame.
He took off his coat in one swift motion along with his tail-coat, hanging it on the stair railing and in record time he was by the door of Mrs Hudson’s flat using the spare key from under the doormat.
You have such a weird bond, but then I think about Harry and I come to the conclusion that maybe it's not that weird after all.
Suddenly the detective felt sick. John heard all of it, his wailing and pleas.
” Moriarty dug his fingers painfully into the flesh of his thighs, getting his face closer to the elbow pit.
"You should regret not being there yesterday, Mycroft. It was such a lovely..."
Capitulation.
Just like right now- it was quiet. No Mrs. Hudson, no John. Only him and his demons.
The hurt clutched his stomach, squeezing it like a little squash ball, making him nauseous at the image of his
And just like that- John was underwater again.
Sherlock finally propped up on his elbows, ignoring his thirst, looking at the source of the sound... and there he was.
But you felt something for her, she intrigued you, kept your brain engaged. You knew she was trouble.
. He should finish his trance in the bed, lying down, ready to sleep when it's all over.
What if the man who once took Sherlock away from him, was back to finish what he started? What if he succeeded this time? Once and for all destroyed Sherlock to the point of no return, to the point where not even Mycroft could help. The thought of losing Sherlock, before he even properly got him back (
The thought sparked up in his head- maybe it was one of  Sherlock’s tricks? Maybe he did it on purpose, knowing too well that they wouldn’t send him to Eastern Europe if Moriarty was
Almost ready, already boiling solution. Putting down the lighter, he mixed everything one more time with a needle.
John let out all the air he was holding unconsciously, not taking back his hand resting near Sherlock’s face. Relieved but still angry (their relationship in a nutshell) John stayed leaned forward, scrutinizing the detective’s face.
Inhale. Exhale.
Mary said something about Ricoletti's case being still unsolved when John finally could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him, unfocused almost unseeing. John frowned, staring back.
to hear how lovely it was, how everyone had so much fun and the food was so delicious, the bride, the groom! Oh, it was sooo fucking, tooth-rooting sweet and
Mycroft straightened up immediately, clenching his hands into fists.
He was getting too old for that, this morning after even if lasted only for one minute, was already shit. Water, his brain pleaded, bring me some water...
You invaded my life and it was never the same ever since.
You know but out of nowhere, you want to hear me say it. Why?
"We already had this conversation. You chose her. You will forgive her eventually. It will take time for you to trust her again but you will. You'll need someone when I am gone, John... And of course, you won't look at the memory stick she gave you, no, you prefer not to know."
Blood left the heart through the pulmonic valve into the pulmonary artery and flew to the lungs. There you go, good, breathe.
John Watson was sitting on the chair opposite the bed, still in his white shirt and black slacks, but without his bright tie and red suspenders. He looked utterly knackered with an empty glass in hand but surely there was once whisky in there. He played with it, as Sherlock reached for the glass of water (no pain killers, punishment) and finally leaned on his headboard. The tension was instantly killing him because John wasn't saying a word just looking with his stormy blue eyes and Sherlock (probably for the first time in his life) didn't know which question ask first. Also, the fact that John looked incredibly sexy sitting like that did not make it easy for him to formulate full sentences.
“No, you did. You said: ’Which is it today? Morphine or cocaine?’.”
. He probably should be opposed to the idea, should consider it immoral and preposterous... but he was the same man that enjoyed triple homicides and walked naked around the Buckingham Palace and on top of that he loved John Watson with all his heart and there was nothing in this world that could keep him away from him.
Sherlock. And despair exploded inside John. Heavy, overwhelming despair, reminding him that he could have never seen him again.
"Good morning, Sherlock. Mycroft, so early here?"
Once again, after being clean for five years he found his moment of euphoria – where chest gets heavy and he falls into a state of total silence, tiptoeing on the edge of life and death, the moment right before his heart takes one more beat in an effort to keep him alive.
Just a simple question and only God knows how much every word of it costs me. I dig a non-existing hole in the ground with my shoe. I really can't look at you, I hope you understand how nervous I am.
My hand in your hair, fingers between your curls. Sherl-
“I didn’t say anything.”
There were two places left- under the mattress (empty) and in his bedside cab-
I am so tired of hiding and pretending.
But is it just a friend when it comes to you? You don't like the thought of having a
God, I feel alone.
"John, you are stupid," you interrupt my train of thoughts, "do you really think it was all about Mary? Can't you remember what Magnussen said? Pressure point. You are my pressure point."
John turned on his heel and faced Mycroft, trying to focus on his words, not the fact that the “dead-in-six-months-in-Eastern-Europe” fiasco was actually over and Mycroft was the one to send Sherlock there in the first place.
Do you feel it too, Sherlock? Up in the sky? Or you just confuse it with the change of pressure?
smiling at him, grabbing him by the nape of the neck, pulling closer. A little closer. The warmth of his fingers causing blood to sing in his ears, filling his chest with ecstasy similar to the one he’s about to experience. Closer and closer and…
"I know it's going to be hard for you..."
But Sherlock covered his ears like a child, trying to block his hearing. He was sick of hearing his name, almost felt like the words could be turned into the rope and start suffocating him, slowly, so he could be aware of losing consciousness, how his breathing flattens, not enough oxygen in his brain, the heart stops beating. Silence. No, no, his heart stopped beating, he can't hear it anymore.
was difficult in general and second- he was about to talk about
One meter.
Finally, John gave in and glanced at his friend, trying not to be obvious, but the said friend was only massaging his temples, not looking at anyone.
John walked like on auto-pilot, the only thing he acknowledged was his destination- the six-foot-tall, curly-haired, pale git that couldn’t somehow stop leaving him behind.
“Oh, so sentimental, look at you” he could almost hear Mycroft’s mocking voice inside his head. Right, Mycroft...
A few minutes until his plane landed.
. Your breath tickles my bottom lip so I bite it, trying to control my loudly beating heart, for nothing of course. Your scent embraces me like a cocoon I can't and don't want to leave.
His short sandy hair was a little ruffled by the wind, when they rushed through streets of London, his deep blue eyes glimmering with excitement, adrenaline dilating his pupils. Moments later Sherlock made him laugh, made him feel alive again.
"And then what?" I want to hear you saying that you will come back to me but as soon as the question leaves my mouth your face drops and I feel like looking at the mirror. You are not going to make it, are you? Jesus Christ. "Who knows?"
) but soon enough he sobered.
Everything stops around me. I suddenly don't want to talk about Mary, about marriage, my head starts to hurt. Divorce?
The detective placed the syringe horizontally with a needle towards the median cubital vein and stopped. He knew this was it.
"Sherlock, can you hear me?"
There was no point in asking how much did he take, but judging by the size of the spoon and little plastic bag Sherlock left on the table, containing at least half of its initial content, Mycroft estimated that in his little brother’s blood system was circulating at least 1.1g of cocaine.
"I had no idea he had a mind palace,
My first thought is about your plane, that it crashed or you got killed on the board. I feel cold sweat on my back. Please no, I was supposed to have six months to acknowledge your loss. Not now. Please, Sherlock.
Mycroft's jaw dropped hearing Sherlock's words not sure how to behave. Was he supposed to participate in this madness or pretend he didn't exist, stand by and make sure Sherlock didn't hurt himself?
“Controlled usage is not usually fatal, and abstinence is not immortality,” answered Sherlock, closing his eyes, looking more and more annoyed with every second of the conversation. Mycroft was having none of it.
It was easy to think it, but all of a sudden the words just couldn't come out, form themself outside of safe harbour of John's mind. They stuck somewhere between cartilages building the larynx.
Before/After WWII
think.
Mycroft unbuttoned two upper buttons of Sherlock’s shirt to make sure he could breathe without any restraint while the first wave of alkaloid washed over him, activating his sympathetic nervous system.
The lungs. Expanding and contracting, trying to do both at the same time. Air is making its way in and out, no, before it flows in, it’s already flowing out. No time to breathe. Stop breathing, lettheheartthroughohmygod. Come on!
Your plane takes off. That's it. After all those years this is it. I feel something trembling inside me but my hands are still. It's my soul, someone tore it apart, left the rest of it to rot inside me.
I sit in my armchair, opposite of you. You think, your hands under your chin. I am used to the fact that you might look at me while thinking. I don't mind.
The chair is empty now. I am left with my thoughts.
He was running out of time, he had to make a decision. Now. Going upstairs meant no drugs, walking out into the street wasn’t even an option. But he needed it, he needed silence, he needed to forget about everything that was happening for the past few months and Mycroft didn’t understand any of those needs.
. And you’ll never know, until-
"I did make a vow, killing Magnussen was me keeping it."
“Dr Watson, I was told to drive you home,” the young driver interrupted his thoughts, opening the door for his wife. In answer John only nodded, thinking that it would be funny if he would leave him on Baker Street, that was his
“Sherlock!” the sound of umbrella hitting the floor resonated all over Baker Street like a bomb that exploded 1,900 feet above Japan in 1945. But it didn’t startle Sherlock, he just lounged in his chair calmly, pulling out the needle. Much better.
Hold you.
Just a touch.
Beautiful, flowery words decorating the reality, that wasn’t even half that pleasing. Becoming a soldier to satisfy his need for action, becoming a doctor to satisfy his need to control the situation and urge of knowing things, dating only women to satisfy his father’s homophobic beliefs and pride, marrying Mary (the best thing that happened to him?) to not end up alone and to get over his feelings for his very much male flatmate.
? This didn't make any sense whatsoever. The affection, the devotion, the sacrifice...
He shouldn’t dwell too long, he should just go and… the movement of Mycroft’s car pulled him out of his thoughts.
I shake your hand firmly, to make sure I sense your warmth for the next hour or so on my palm.
You give me one last reassuring look before you disappear on the board of the plane.
John’s nostrils flared with anger and he sat opposite Mycroft, holding tight the piece of paper.
” he smiled gently, nestling his cheek against his kneecap. “
But the heart tangled itself in the pulmonary vein, pulmonary artery, aortic arch, coronary vessels sprang free and embraced it, holding it inside his chest. Unable to move, to scream, to call for help. Left alone. Nobody is going to help you, little heart.
"Nothing is going to be hard for me, Mycroft. You can go now, I have things to do," Sherlock spat.
"Yes, I'll have you, if you will have me, John," was he blushing? The warmth was spilling all over his face and neck making his skin itch. Sherlock felt a finger under his chin destined to raise his eyes towards John's. When he surrendered he almost started crying, seeing the depth of the doctor's feelings in them, the devotion and something he hasn't seen in a while- he seemed more content, less bitter.
And this is exactly what he did, adding a few remarks towards Mycroft, with his coat in hand, while exiting the plane. He was about to leave the plane himself when Mycroft’s voice stopped him.
The mornings after were always painful, always full of headaches and sandpapers in his mouth. But he deserved it, you can't be always high on dopamine, it needs time to re-synthesize... or something. The curtains were drawn together, preventing rays of sunshine from invading his living space.
I scream inside my head so loud I've lost my voice.
"You know, actually, I can't think about a single thing to say," I don't look at you anymore and so do you. We escape with our eyes somewhere over the area of the airport. This is so bad and awkward I just wait for the ground to swallow me whole. I should look at you, remember every curve of your face and every thread of your clothing, its colours. I should make you talk, just to hear your voice.
He got his keys out of the pocket with a trembling hand, inhaling deeply the rather cool air. The water vapour in his exhaled breath condensing into lots of tiny droplets of liquid water and ice that could be seen as a cloud, similar to fog. Like smoke. It didn’t tickle him though, like the good old smoke from the cigarette he was so eager to light.
“Sherlock!” Mycroft’s voice was distant, too distant to stop the motion, to stop the needle from piercing his delicate, white skin.
He made an effort to stand up and unsteadily went towards the bathroom.
because he knew the reasons behind Sherlock's actions and the worst that could happen now was Sherlock remembering them (reasons, not actions). Which was going to be a hell of a job, judging by the view that welcomed Mycroft at 221B Baker Street. The whole sitting room looked like a cave of a crazy wedding planner, filled with purple ribbons, flowers, photos and napkins...
Not pure, nothing pure about it, if anything, a little turbid because of the shame and denial, on worse days almost muddy, on better calm and fresh. On better days he could sip it, touch it, use it to warm up or cool off with it, but when he was too harsh, it turned into a tsunami, taking everything with it, only the remains of his thoughts and memories either floating or drowning.
Or maybe you are not on the plane anymore, one of your tricks to escape this cage your brother put you in. I would never underestimate you, not after...
“Take care of the mess you’ve made, Sherlock! We are going upstairs. I presume you don’t want Mrs. Hudson to find you here in the middle of your…
“Vauxhall Cross, Sherlock. Now.”
John was about to nag at Mycroft further, demanding any explanation whatsoever, but Mycroft held his hand up to silence him while making another call. The burning desire to punch the British Government washed over him.
Mycroft was a patient man but was he
And Sherlock could only wait, until one of the following things happened: a- he got over his feelings (yeah, right), b- he overdosed one night (more likely), c- someone gave him a case so challenging he has no time to dwell on the past.
Sherlock heard steps on the stairs (slow, careful, firm)- Mrs. Hudson with the tea and biscuits.
"I was never in love with her," you still look at the ceiling and I feel cold all of a sudden.
A cockpit was on his left, so his feet led him to the right side-
You left me in pieces there, Sherlock- in the middle of the street, in front of St.Bart's Hospital. Your body hit the ground and I shattered like a mirror dropped by a clumsy crew of movers.
Your eyes glisten, full of understanding. Is this satisfying for you? It's not for me. Not at all.
With visibly growing impatience, Sherlock tried to put the key into the lock but every object around him, or so he thought, decided to recalcitrate and he couldn’t hit it right for the first two times, eventually managing it at the third.
“Dr Watson.”
Sherlock made an incoherent noise and without any care he collapsed on his chair, hiding his face in bent knees. He couldn't hear it, he wasn't
At first, they weren’t focused on anything, more like looking around, as if to assure himself that the trance was over and he was back on the plane.
You divert your eyes to me, you never do that.
transparent? Was he
. Relieve.
"Hey, Sherlock, look at me. I can feel your pulse, it's all right," Mycroft tried to smile but he didn't need a mirror to know how pathetic he looked. And unfortunately, Sherlock saw it too.
“Sherlock, are you okay?” but the second those words left his mouth he knew the answer already, by the light frown forming between Sherlock’s eyebrows.
Sherlock took a deep breath starring Moriarty in the eyes. A crazy smile was lingering on his lips, encouraging his actions.
An that is it. I hope you liked my potato. Stay safe and healthy everyone!
. Everything was a distraction.
The sorrow is overwhelming. You are not coming back at all. But I don't want to see it, so I purse my lips in a thin line and look around again. I feel like every organ inside me falls to the ground and I ask myself how the hell I am still standing. It's hard. But I guess you need me now just as much as I need you so I turn to face you. Something is stuck in my throat and I can't speak.
‘What is said of Utterson – listen:
‘Well, we will essay the meetings together,’ was all his comment. ‘I have not yet met Labouchère: he is much occupied in the House and with the Egypt Question at present: indeed he is a most indefatigable worker, with many irons in the fire. But the others we should most assuredly meet: Holmes, you are a man of such parts, such standing, that if we could win you to the cause of reform it would be a great thing for us. You liked Burns-Gibson, did you not? And would not object to coming with me? I do so little good in the world,’ he added, wistfully, ‘and there is so much to do. I am unlikely to leave aught of value behind me: even a good name would be something.’
‘What of the place of the murder? Was there nothing there?’ Watson leaned forward in his eagerness, drawing his chair closer to mine so that our knees almost touched. His eyes were bright, intent: he was all soldier and hunter. ‘Holmes, surely such a simple woman – a murder so – so commonplace, lacking all, well, all intricacy, surely it cannot baffle you. Not that it is not very terrible,’ he amended, self-consciously, and I suppressed a smile at his conscientious recognisance that he might be forgetting the wretched little victim in his writer’s desire for the story. ‘Poor child, poor innocent, bewildered little child. It is so very sad.’
‘I shall be bored. There is nothing to do here.’
Canon Holmes stories assigned to this year are The Adventure of the Stockbroker’s Clerk, the Adventure of the Crooked Man, the Adventure of the Noble Bachelor, and, of course, Baskerville.
I vowed to him that I would not, and admitted that the case distressed me. ‘It is partly that he is a doctor and a soldier, like you. Yet you stand, as it were, at the antipodes of such a position, or rather you at the zenith, he at the nadir. It is very terrible to me when a good man goes astray. The brutes of Spitalfields or Limehouse, the denizens of our prisons, they are in great part, what their circumstances have made them. Bred foully, they do foully, since they know no better. They have souls, yes, as we do, but brutalised from birth by this society we live in, they are lower than the brute beasts. Beasts at least act bestially after their kind: they are moved by need, not greed. Man is a corrupt thing, a fallen angel.’ I stopped then, unable to go on, my head spinning, my heart beating painfully hard in the reaction from the drug.
The Count of Monte Cristo: Dumas’ masterpiece. A plot twist in the story becomes a plot twist in SFISYF later on. Watson quotes Samuel Johnson ‘the Great Lexicographer’ on John Donne: the metaphysical poets were deeply unpopular at this point.
‘It would not suit for every day,’ said he, ever the practical man. ‘But perhaps you would not mind so very much if I let it out to play on occasions.’
The case is a genuine 2 year old cold case, solved by microscopic examination of tools Orrock left at the crime scene. He was re-tried for murder on 15.09.84 & hanged.
‘Suddenly? Without tapering the dose? It is no wonder you have been restless, and unsettled then. But then you accompanied Dupré to the opium den?’
‘His manner and lifestyle are excessively – emphatic. Exuberant. Decadent? Effeminate? Many condemn him.’
‘Thank you,’ he said simply, and offered his hand again. ‘I do thank you, Holmes, for your kindness.’
‘Nihil humanum alienum a me puto,’ he reminded me. ‘Either that is true, Holmes, or it is not. You said it yourself: you think nothing human alien to you, and my dear fellow, you did not so react when I spoke to you of poor Minnie and her troubles, although that may have been your courtesy to me in my distress. And this is a criminal issue: a court case. I am aware you dislike and distrust the female sex, and I see your lack of ease with them – a lack of ease which I deduce comes from having no sister, perhaps a cold, unfeeling mother, and no kindly nurse in your childhood to teach you that they are not so alien to us after all. Yet I do not believe you can be so unfeeling as to dismiss half the human race on these grounds. Indeed, I have seen you kind to many women. You surely must admit, then that a more complete understanding of what bitter, bitter trials a woman may face can only help you in your great work of justice, my dear, my true-hearted Pythias.’
‘I will.’ I said. ‘I shall confine myself to my cases, and a good dose of my 6 per cent solution to soothe my nerves and sharpen my mind, so you may be quite easy. I have much to do: never fear for my being bored.’
I had not realised how long I had been silent, until I woke from my reverie, and found him patiently sitting waiting for my reply. He was observing me gravely, only the hint of a smile on his lips. ‘Are you still there, Holmes?’
‘I pity any poor wretch with eight children and only a feckless man for support,’ she said, with what I can only describe as a snort. ‘Not that he’s a bad man, but he’s a man, when all’s said and done. It’s a crying shame the poor woman has no sister, nor her mother alive to help her out. Well, I shall have a good strong calves-foot jelly for you to take to little Polly tomorrow, a jelly with plenty of lemon and sugar in it. But I shall not give it to you unless you eat a good dinner yourself, and take a rest now.’
‘We shall speak, but I beg you, no more for the moment. I can barely see out of my right eye – the pain is intense. And no, I have not: I shall try an injection this evening. The draught in water begins to be a little nauseous to my palate, yet I do not wish to forgo the drug entirely. I think varying the method of administration is the correct thing to do. I know you do not like it, Watson, but it is not morphine I am putting in my veins, so you need have no fear.’
‘Your father began to abuse Minnie. Not just to beat her, but to use her as he should not. She was too young, but old enough for his use.’
'By all means, let them come up,' I said to Mrs Hudson. 'I am happy to receive them. And if you will let us have coffee, and perhaps a bottle of the Madeira wine, with some biscuits, or some such trifle, Mrs Hudson, if you would be so kind: one of the ladies has been extremely ill, and will require nourishment.'
The train slowed, then stopped. ‘We are at Ringwood,’ he observed. And that was all he said, for our carriage was invaded by a jovial farmer and his wife, who conversed with Watson until Bournemouth was reached. He had moved from opposite to beside me on their entry, offering them, with his usual courtesy, the opportunity to be seated together. He removed his scarf, folded it, and bade me rest my head on it and try to doze, telling the couple that I was inclined to headache and nausea in trains, and had better not talk. He did not address me thereafter, but the comfort of his solid bulk was against my side as he chatted quietly and comfortably with them about the weather and the price of cattle. Eventually, we reached our destination, and tumbled out, stiff and sore from long sitting, to find our carriage waiting. Of course we could not converse then either, and it was not until we were settled before the fire in the parlour Lestrade had reserved for us, that we renewed our discourse. And all the while, he treated me with the most courteous, reverent gentleness, the softest, most respectful manner. I hated it - could not bear it.
‘I was cogitating upon our play, that is all . . . I have a song to sing, O! . . .
1884 is an interesting year in Canon because there is NOTHING written about it. One has to assume, therefore, that Holmes and Watson were engaged in events about which Watson dared not write. I hope that why this was becomes clear. If not, it should become clearer in Parts 9 and 10.
There was nothing awaiting me on Friday night, but on Saturday morning, when I repaired to the Post Office (which not being Jewish did not close its doors to business on that day) there was a telegram from Watson. I returned immediately to my room and opened it.
The briefest of touches to my shoulder, his hand left mine, and he was gone, his tread decided, almost military, on the stair.
‘Are you an addict?’
‘I was only going to ask if it would help you to begin if I were to attempt to deduce you, as I have done with my clients,’ I almost felt I should apologise for the thought. ‘But of course, my dear Watson, I will not, if you do not wish it.’
"Dear me, Mr Holmes. Dear me!"
After we had calmed ourselves, after Taunton, and while we waited at Exeter for our transport to Tavistock, I had explained the case to Watson. It had initially seemed to me that, given the difficulty of hiding a racehorse in such a sparsely inhabited area as north Dartmoor, Silver Blaze and his abductor would soon be found – I did not for one moment believe that it would be Fitzroy Simpson – and that that abductor would also prove to be the murderer of John Straker. But there had been no progress over the past forty-eight hours, and Gregory had expressed himself grateful for my assistance. He expounded the facts in the case – not omitting to mention the discovery of a nearby gipsy party – as we drove across the moor while the afternoon waned.
‘You look a little pale,’ he said to me, later, as we partook of Mrs Hudson’s excellent venison pasties, devilled kidneys kept hot in a chafing dish, and sherried mushroom soup. ‘Take another glass of claret, Holmes, and for goodness’ sake eat a little more. You wear yourself out with brainwork, and then do not nourish the body your brain feeds on. Here.’ He ladled more soup into my plate. ‘At least eat this, if you will not have one of these delicious pasties.’
‘It is your nature to feel the evils of life thus – deeply and painfully.’ He stroked my cheek, kissed my brow as I lay close clasped to his breast. ‘And because you do what you do, then needs must you come too much into contact with that which must make you feel. You enquire into deep and painful matters: hence there is pain. I remind you of the kindness in the world to counterbalance what you see; looking always on the dark side, my dearest Sherlock, your eyes dazzle in the light.’
‘John, John, I am sorry. I did not mean to wake memories.’ I stroked his hand where it lay upon my breast. ‘I am sorry.’
Bagoas is the ‘Persian Boy’ of Mary Renault’s novel, and Alexander’s younger lover; Hephaistion, Alexander’s long-time boyhood friend and lover, over whose death he grieved to the point of madness. The stories of Alexander are well known in Persia.
‘Content with that, and with our lives here, my dear Holmes,’ he said, and smiled up at me, his gaze guileless and warm with unshadowed affection. ‘So very content.’
'At what time was the murder, Gregson? Let us apply reason to this, and consider the matter without so much heat. You have told us nothing so far that will enable us to tease out the matter, but come here hot-foot with your accusation as if to take a murderer in the act. It is not kind in you.' I crossed the room and rang the bell for Mrs Hudson. 'We can dispense with the presence of these two gentlemen, Inspector: send them back to their duties, for they are wasting their time here. I cannot believe that after all the work we have done together, you brought constables to subdue Dr Watson, as if he would snap and run like a common criminal to escape justice. I think it would be impossible for you to insult us more if you tried, and I shall not forget it, I assure you. Ah, Mrs Hudson: show these gentlemen out: they are leaving. Is that a message you have there for me?
‘Lestrade recommends an inn - The Ragged Cat at Boscombe. It is two miles out of Bournemouth, still quite rural and remote, and near to the new Spa. If need be, we can be a gentleman in ill health – that is you, Holmes - and his medical attendant. He has offered to see to it for us, since his division will be paying. It will not be luxurious, but I daresay it will do for a couple of nights. He told me yesterday that he would wire down to make arrangements, so if you pack your valise, we will take the train directly after luncheon. I must run into Barts this morning – I have patients to see after – but I can meet you at Waterloo Station in time for the three-thirty. I am afraid it is generally considered a slow route, but at least our train does not stop until Southampton. And Lestrade has wired for a carriage to be at our disposal from Bournemouth to Boscombe, and for running about the town. I asked him if we needed an introduction to the local police, but he said not.’
‘How dare you be so officious as to press me?’ I snapped at him, my mind in turmoil. I had to make him go; I could not let him know my shameful secret. ‘What right have you to go behind my back and do these things? Will you bring in other doctors next, to have me declared not in my right mind? To confine me?’
‘I would not encourage Watson to attend the Nonpareil: he must not gamble, for he cannot do so in moderation, and his luck is always out, poor fellow. But when I telegraph him, I will ask him for any information he can give me about Upwood. Watson is in Devon, with Sir Henry Baskerville, exchanging certain danger for the possibility of it, if you must know. I felt it best that he should be out of London for a period, and could not otherwise persuade him to leave me.’
Mrs Hudson’s voice, raised a little, ‘But what of the damage to your coat, Doctor?’
I set the flask down with extreme care, and took up a small package which I opened for him. ‘This is a diatomaceous earth common in Germany, where it is termed kieselgur – which of course our newspapers, in reporting this sorry case, are quite failing to spell correctly -  and mixing these two substances, triturating them slowly and carefully to a paste, renders the explosive less dangerous. In such a state he terms it ‘dynamite’ and it is now sold for mining operations, where it is desired to shift great masses of rock. I begged a little of the liquid and the earth from Dupré, in order to experiment.’
‘I am saddened by the inequities I see in this case.’ I moved as close to him as I dared without touching him: I had resolved that I should not allow myself to solicit any caress, no matter how slight, either by word or deed. I had nearly, I feared, given myself away as an invert by the excessive emotion I had been unable to repress over the Cornwall trial. If Watson knew me plainly for one, no matter how kind he was, he might leave me. I could not risk him leaving me.

‘It is the worst of all terrors, Holmes. I know. I understand.’
I twitched the newspaper from his grasp and sat beside him. ‘Do abandon that rag, John. I cannot bear to see you with anything of Labouchère’s in your hands: the man is an abhorrence. Come, sit with me. We are in our own home, surely we may be a little careless? I have not held you this age. And Mycroft believes Pigott has acted alone to slander Parnell, he is not confederated with our quadruply-headed hydra. But for the Times to pay one thousand seven hundred and eighty pounds for a letter supposedly written by Parnell to Patrick Egan, the Fenian, a letter that has Parnell writing that although he regrets the accident of Cavendish's death, he cannot refuse to admit that Burke got no more than his deserts at Phoenix Park in ‘82, and being stupid enough to sign it “Yours very truly, Charles S. Parnell" is ridiculous. The newspaper should have known that it was, as Parnell described it, a villainous and barefaced forgery. And besides, when we investigated, we found it to be impossible that Parnell had been complicit. There are those of his entourage who encourage violence, but he does not.’
‘I was, for a few days. But also, that was what I wished you to think.’
'It cannot be immunity from prosecution in all cases,' he warned me. He underlined what he had written, then he wrote below it a line of Greek script - "οὐ γὰρ ἔγωγ᾽ ἔχω εἰπεῖν ὅτι μεῖζόν ἐστιν ἀγαθὸν εὐθὺς νέῳ ὄντι ἢ ἐραστὴς χρηστὸς καὶ ἐραστῇ παιδικά" - which he contemplated for a few seconds, before underlining that too. 'If taken in the act, I can do nothing, you understand: I cannot negate proof positive.' He wrote the same line again, underlined the words once more. "οὐ γὰρ ἔγωγ᾽ ἔχω εἰπεῖν ὅτι μεῖζόν ἐστιν ἀγαθὸν εὐθὺς νέῳ ὄντι ἢ ἐραστὴς χρηστὸς καὶ ἐραστῇ παιδικά." 'Whether there is truth in the rumours, or the accusations, I do not wish to know. No!' He raised his eyes to mine. 'Do not protest, do not tell me. You will tell me nothing. Say nothing. It is better not to put anything in words. You do good work, Holmes, and you are of great value to us: your brother also. Moriarty is the Niddhog gnawing at our Yggdrasil: the Serpent in our Eden. He moves unseen, undermining the foundations of our constitution for his own ends. We cannot penetrate his plans: you can. We need you, and we will protect you, and your friend insofar as it is possible.'
I do know how you love the stars, my dear fellow, and think it remiss of me not to have considered it before. Should you like a telescope, Watson? We might purchase one with some of Mr Holder’s largesse – you should have something for yourself, after all -  and have it sent to Sussex, when we holiday there, as I hope we will this summer. I take it you go to Professor Moriarty’s lecture then, if it is astronomy? And that is why you are balking at telling me?’
'Holmes, I - you - I was glad you were not there. The smell . . . it was as if I was back on the battlefield: the reek of it is yet in my nostrils.'
‘I wish I were not so unhandy,’ I said. My eyes felt hot, and my throat tight. ‘I am sure I have hurt you; unskilled as I am.’
Lamson proceeds to demonstrate this process; opening a capsule, filling it with sugar from the communal bowl using a small spade spoon, closing it, and handing it to Percy to take, which he dutifully does. Lamson is thus enabled -
‘He is unassailable,’ he went on, ‘a reputable professor with an unimpeachable background – two universities – Durham and London, a tenured position, papers to his name, a patron of the arts and a contributor to the Royal Society. You, on the other hand, if enquiries are made, are a consorter with lowly folk, with criminals, a man of over thirty pursuing no recognised avocation. You are unmarried, living in rented rooms with an army doctor friend. You are of dubious means and morals because of your associations with the Yard – Lestrade is a good man, but it is not his influence will save you – and your associations with the criminal world. If the Premier chooses to shed the light of his countenance upon you, it will, should Professor Moriarty attempt to cause trouble, balance the scales that at present are weighed too heavily against you.’,
‘No, sir,” said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner for which he was famous. “We have not done so, nor is it possible that we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run, mean to inform the public. This is what we particularly desire to avoid.’
Now that is ridiculous, in fact, since sugar in sherry has no such effect, not to mention being the ruination of a fine amontillado or palo cortado. He then produced from his bag, we are told, a Dundee cake, and some crystallised fruits, which were shared out. Now you, Stevenson, contended, that since all shared in these, they could not be the vehicle for the poison. But mark what Lamson does next. He produces, from his bag, a small packet of the new-fangled gelatine capsules, which are coming into use for delivering powders: while these may easily be prised apart, filled and re-closed, thus encapsulating any unpalatable powder within, the process of deglutition renders the gelatine flexible and soft, it further dissolves in the acids of the stomach, and the drug thus delivered is imparted to the system without –
I stood, and found that he was holding out his hand to me. I approached, eyes downcast, and grasped his hand, and he pressed mine kindly between both of his.
‘That is true, alas that it should be so.’ He sighed.
‘No, with myself, that I did not observe the signs in you.’
‘Nor I without you.’ He picked up his bags, but lingered in the doorway. ‘I had almost thought it better to be away for a while – you were so strange with me, and I could not see why: I could not account for your shrinking when we had been so close – but now I know, and all our misunderstanding is cleared away, I am easier in my mind also.’ He turned away, then back to me. ‘Except for leaving you of course. Holmes, you are not to get into trouble while I am away. Do not do anything that carries a risk, my dear, while I am not here. And let me hear of you often. I shall send you bulletins, and do you do the same for me. I trust it will not be too long before I am home.’
‘No, instead there is hunger, poverty and ignorance,’ interjected Tchaikovsky, dryly. ‘Little use to care for affectional nature if the means of feeding the body is absent. There must be regulation of the means of production, so that all are fed, and none suffer: and this will not come from reformation, but from revolution.’
‘This is nothing: is there more? Mere railing cannot achieve much.’
‘No.’ I tried to smile at him, but felt myself falter. I wanted to lie in his arms that night, but I could not, not after having profaned his kindness with such lecherous thoughts as mine had been in that moment he had held me. ‘No, it is no matter. I shall be better in the morning. Go to bed, John, do not fret over me.’
But someone, someone had watched these events unfold, someone patient and deadly as a snake. Someone had planned to lay Watson by the heels on a charge of murder which he would find it hard to disprove, having no witnesses to speak for him, and had been waiting the opportunity. Someone had had him shadowed, until the omens for a successful strike were propitious. Money had been lavished on the attempt: money to acquire the watchers, money to pay the drivers, money to fee the messenger, money to buy the assassins: night after night after night, waiting for the right combination of events for the plan to be set in motion, for the trap to be sprung.
Sea, of course, I knew in Kernowek to be
“You know Blake’s verse too? I often think of it as I work, Holmes: for it is true. Too many ills, too irremediable. Sometimes it is hard to have hope.”
He was hurt, and I was sorry instantly. ‘I shall miss you damnably, you know that. But it will do you no harm to be out of London, and we may do some good into the bargain. Pray, John, oblige me in this, and if I suggest, it, do not demur. Indeed, I cannot leave for a day or two, Sir Henry may well be in grave danger - from the malignity of man, not the supernatural - and there is no-one I can trust as I trust you.’
The Bloody Sunday riots of November 13th and 20th were the final acts in a long series of protests and marches in that year. Many socialist and anarchist groups, including the Fabians, came together to protest injustice and heavy handed policing. By and large, the leaders didn't suffer, although the rank and file did. One MP, Mr Cunninghame-Grahame was severely beaten by police, but most deaths and serious injuries were among the poor. The story of Alfred Linnell makes truly sad reading. He is commemorated by a plaque in Bow Cemetery, and William Morris wrote an overly sentimental ballad about his death. It was printed in a pamphlet designed by Walter Crane, and sold to raise funds for Linnell's children.
” as Mycroft and I had dubbed the French business, had blazoned my name even more widely abroad, and so the brief tales that Watson told had doubled in popularity. It was strange to be noticed in the street – and given the hostility of Moriarty and Moran, it was unwelcome as well. My one consolation was that Watson had, quite inadvertently, by focusing his attention on what he referred to as the almost superhuman quality of my reasoning ability, given the impression that I was a creature devoid of the softer passions. Indeed, as he had remarked to me one evening, he had in the beginning thought me far above all human affections.
Hanging Day at the Royal Academy was where all of the famous artists exhibited their work. Look for Frith’s 1881 painting of the day, and you will see many of the people described here (although the paintings are those shown in 1885). I made a small continuity error here, and only just found it before I posted.
‘I have brought you a sherry, Watson.’ I did not know if I sounded meek, but I felt it. ‘Janey is mending the fire, and Mrs Hudson has roast partridge for our dinner, with syllabub for pudding. And – and I shall just leave this here with you, I think, and go down to tidy our room. I did not realise it had become such a mess, but Mrs Hudson has scolded me roundly, and told me it is no fit place for any man to come back to, and indeed it is not. I am very sorry, Watson. I know it must be infuriating to live with. It is just that I become engrossed, and I forget, you know.’
, and the Scottish use
'Who brought the message?' I refilled his cup. 'And how did Haslip know you were at Bart's? How did he know where to send? Why you? Why not some other colleague at the London? Was there no-one else there but that he must hale you halfway round the city in the small hours to pronounce on one only of the many cases there? John - my dear Watson: this tale is beyond fantastical.'
have not forgotten Ignorance and Want hiding in the cloak of Christmas Present, my dear fellow, even if you have. But I do not believe you have. You are a kind man, Holmes, even if you would rather not appear one. Is that all your budget of news? What more is there of sour, before I receive my bon-bon at the end to take away the taste?’
‘I will find them for you.’ He kissed my brow. ‘If you feel you could bear the crowds and the light and noise, it might be the very thing to brighten up your spirits a little. And we need not stay for the whole performance if you find yourself overset.’
I had felt a little shy with Watson the morning after our unexpected tussle, wondering if he would resent me for having seen him at a disadvantage, as I would have resented him seeing my weakness if our situations had been reversed. But he had come to breakfast in good spirits, with a fresher colour, and more spark in his eye, and had patted me on the shoulder as he went to his seat.
I looked at Watson, who nodded. We had discussed this. 'We think it would be better if we were not. I would not want to appear to be perverting the course of justice. This suspicion has been cast on Watson, and may be again. It would be better if we were not.'
He stroked my hair. 'We will light our own candle, Sherlock, so that you may have no need to curse the darkness. Go and wash, and I shall fetch my nightshirt and dressing gown and a blanket. All under this roof are asleep, save us. I will hold you all night, if it will solace you, my dear.’
"Denn die Todten reiten schnell" is a phrase from the popular Gothic ballad "Lenore" by Gottfried August Burger, and is quoted in Bram Stoker's Dracula, but since this wasn't published until 1897, we must assume Mycroft knew the original ballad.
I had been working for some months before I succeeded in perfecting the formula: a few crystals of sodium, not potassium, chloride, and a quantity of glacial acetic acid proving to be the correct combination. Pyridine I had tried, of course, instead of the acetic acid, but it was less reliable, and only the most reliable of tests would do for me. It was important, too, that the test proved the presence of only human, not animal, haemoglobin. As I watched the reaction occur for the fourth time that morning, my mind was suffused by the keenest of pleasures: a pure, a delicate, mental, nay, cerebral, joy. A joy which, I believed, would always surpass in quality the lesser joys of the flesh in just such a measure as the tone of my own violin, its quivering strings eloquent in their passion, would surpass the discordant scrapings of the street fiddlers of London.
Our meeting with Baskerville proved fruitful, and I was able to arrange for Watson to accompany him to Devonshire on the Saturday two days following. The errand I had sent Cartwright, the lad from the District Office, on to find that copy of the Times I sought did not prosper. It irked me to have to use one of the telegraph messengers – I found them neither as wily nor as persevering as my Irregulars -  but they could, on the other hand, go where the street lads could not, and more to the point they could both read and write well. I had Cartwright in and questioned him, but he had been unable to trace, in all the London hotels, the cut sheet of the Times from which Baskerville’s mysterious follower had taken the words for his warning. I dismissed the lad with a couple of shillings, however, as he departed somewhat crestfallen at his failure and promised I would call upon him again if I had need.
‘A glass of wine, and some bread, if there is any, nothing more,’ he replied. ‘Holmes, could we sit together and read tonight? It – it would comfort me.’
Quotes or paraphrases from A Christmas Carol, Hamlet, Macbeth, The Hobbit, Blake's London.
I had lied to Mycroft, of course. Watson was more than fond of me in a brotherly way. He was devoted, a comrade without price and without peer. Whatever ailed me, he cared for me tenderly, his hands gentle on fever flushed skin, or bruised bone. He quickened to my every move: did I falter, he was there. He was swift to praise and slow to blame, as no-one had ever been with me. Why was it then, that I did not put my fate in his hands? I could not tell, only that I – would not. That I was afraid.
‘Yes.’ He looked up from the paper. ‘That little, ill-spelt rhyme she wrote to the mother she mourned and longed for from a foreign country where she had been taken without her will. “I thought of one, I thought of two, but most of all I thought of you.” Poor lost, lonely child: it breaks my heart. And Stead calls her a modest, pure, honest little girl, as if he did not himself put all those things at risk. I am not a religious man, Holmes, but I will say with the Saviour that whoever harms one of the little ones, better it were for him that a millstone be put around his neck and he be drowned in the depth of the sea.’
'My dear Mrs Barclay, any doctor would tell you that you are not fit to work in your present state of health,' I told her. Watson nodded. 'And to renounce everything that has come to you since your marriage is a quixotic and, dare I say it, a foolish act. You should not let false delicacy and scruples about your husband's actions deprive you of the means of a comfortable living. If you retain what is due to you - and it is due to you, make no mistake about that - or you may see it, if you choose, as due to Mr Wood, in recompense for the career of which the Colonel deprived him - you can make a comfortable home for yourself, and later, perhaps, if all goes well, for him. And so you should.'
Sadly, Holmes is correct about Labouchère, and Watson is wrong.
His gladness lasted but a moment, however, clouds obscuring the sunny warmth of his welcome, as I knew they must.
‘Good night then.’ The door closed.
It seemed strange to me that there should be no word with the
‘I have let Mr Johnson know that if he makes another such suggestion anent your honour it will go very ill with him indeed,’ he said, the moment he returned to our room. His eyes were hot, his fists clenched convulsively, and his shoulders were braced: suddenly I saw the ‘bull-pup’ of a temper that he had owned to when we first met. ‘I’ll not have you maligned like that, Holmes: how dare he suggest that you might consort with a prostitute in the street. Had you not had need of him I would have taken him down where he stood, the foul creature. I’ll not have it, Holmes.’
‘May the devil take him, and his dolichocephalic skulls and his well-marked supra-orbital development, and his parietal fissures into the bargain.’ Watson stood at the window, watching Dr Mortimer leave. ‘In the immortal words of Mr Gilbert last year,  the fact that I admire his ruddy countenance does not mean that I like his bloody cheek!’
‘I do know.’ I touched his cheek, and our eyes met for a long moment. Then he sighed and stood, wincing a little. ‘What is it, John?’
‘It makes me long for a fresh breeze, but we cannot leave London at this moment.’
‘In lying together? What of . . .?’
‘What do you think of me, Mr Holmes: of course she has not! I have kept her as straitly as I would have done my daughter if I had had one. He has been to tea in the kitchen once, on her afternoon off, so that I might meet him – I insisted on that, you see - and it was then it struck me that he wasn’t quite the thing, Sir. He was too curious, asking questions and such like, angling to see through the house, asking if we were properly secured against burglary, if he might do us the kindness of checking all of the window locks, if we kept a dog, and so on. I told him nothing, you may be sure of that, save that he might enquire in his own department and find that you were in with the police, and had daily converse with them, and so were well protected. I was about to speak of it to you, Doctor - for he has been hanging around the place more and more often, playing off his cajoling ways and making a great fuss of her - when Janey came home howling and blubbering yesterday, and swearing she would never see him again, that he was a beast. You can be sure I was concerned, gentlemen, and I questioned her lest anything should have occurred, but it was not that she was touched – only these questions were put to her, that she did not think were proper. She had at least the wit to get away from him without harm and I suppose he thought he would be suspected if, well – if.’
‘So it is a beginning,’ Watson remarked, as we strolled gently through Regent’s Park, arm in arm. ‘One hopes we have made some progress, and I have prepared a new scrap-book for you, old fellow, so we may collate the information in a tidy fashion. I do so hope you enjoy the Mikado this evening, Holmes. I am grateful that you will attend it with me: it is really not your sort of music at all.’
Dr Sophia Jex Blake did, in fact, receive help from a Dr Watson – but it was Dr Patrick Heron Watson, who was an army surgeon in the Crimea, and with the Royal Artillery, and taught Arthur Conan Doyle at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.  Like his namesake, Dr John Watson, he was a staunch supporter of women in medicine. https://www.ed.ac.uk/alumni/services/notable-alumni/alumni-in-history/patrick-heron-watson
‘You are my all. Come, let me go. The sooner I am there, the sooner back again.’
He shook his head and then cried out with pain again. ‘No, it is the drug. Wait, I can’t speak.’
I opened my own packet with as much care as he, ruffling the paper back to expose a dark grey shagreen case with silver fittings. I knew it was a pipe immediately, but the shape of the case gave me momentary pause for thought . . . ah, an extension, of course. I lifted the lid to reveal, nestled into its crimson velvet lining, a Barling briar pipe, the Dublin bowl silver-fitted like the case. A cloudy amber mouthpiece, a horn mouthpiece, and a fine, albatross-bone extension, all mounted with silver, completed the set. It was a work of art - whatever he said, the gift was princely. Then a thought occurred to me, and I raised the pipe to my nose, and sniffed. As I had thought, it smelt of my own tobacco. I looked a query at him.
My Heart Is Fast.
’We are quite private here, and I will stand watch for you. Sleep, my dear fellow, it will do you good.’ I laid a hand on his shoulder. ‘Sleep, there is nothing to harm you, and I am here. I will stay by you. Close your eyes, Watson.’
‘But you would not trust him with our lives in this instance, would you? Here, take the paper. I do not wish to see it again, and I beg, Holmes that you will not look at it either. Such words are as unfit for your ears as they would be for a green girl.’
‘That is better, Holmes: you needed food. Lestrade, good morning, Pray forgive me for receiving you in such a state, but as you can see, I have been unwell, confined to bed. Nay, more - Holmes forbade me to leave my bed.’
‘No,’ I said. I would put it off no longer. ‘It is only - ’ I rose, and fetched my case down from the rack, unstrapped and opened it. ‘It is this, Watson.’ And I placed the morocco case into his hands. ‘Open it. It is the, the answer to a question you asked me, a little while ago, and I promised to answer when I could.’
Christ, John, talk!
The plane was coming back to the spot where they said their goodbyes. John discovered he was moving, ignoring his name being called out behind him, when he noticed the stewardess opening the door before him.
Three more seconds.
Moriarty got up abruptly from his chair across Sherlock and fell on his knees before him, clinging on his dress trousers tightly.
There is a part of me that hopes you understand. That you know what I want to say... and even smaller part wishing for you to feel the same.
“... You are needed.”
The mornings after were always painful, always full of headaches and sandpapers in his mouth. But he deserved it, you can't be always high on dopamine, it needs time to re-synthesize... or something. The curtains were drawn together, preventing rays of sunshine from invading his living space.
Inhale. Exhale. Beauty, money, power- everything loses its validity.
, thought John,
She asks me if I am alright. No. I don't think so. No. But I say I'm fine. The biggest lie we tell every day.
Mary sighed and took a seat opposite of Sherlock, looking at John worriedly. John frowned a bit in response. Why was she looking at him like that? Like she knew some-
exist; just for a couple of days turn off his mind completely and not think how miserable he was. Because, oh Lord, he was so miserable.
"Where are you go- Sherlock, stop!" he knew the drugs where in Mycroft's jacket. Bugger!
“Oh, John,” Sherlock’s breath slipped through the hair on top of John’s head, triggering chills to run all over his body, like he’s just got out of the water, soaking wet and cold, seeking for comfort.
We float in the silence violated only by the sound of our breaths. I could stay like this forever, with you by my side.
But now he flowed with it, making a step towards a runway. He clenched and unclenched his fists a few times trying not to run in the direction of a speeding aeroplane.
“Are you satisfied with your cleaning? Because even five-year-old would-”
What are we doing Sherlock? We are never going to see each other again, why are we doing this? For God's sake, we are fucked up.
He was alone once and he was good at it. Nobody to take care of, with Mrs. Hudson downstairs there was always someone to talk to if he needed to. He already made it work for the past few months why not now?
“Missed me?”
A little disappointed by the lack of Sherlock’s offer to accompany him in this adventure, he got in the car himself and fastened seat belts.
Sherlock sighed, sitting up, leaning his back on the headboard.
I don't think I can ever forgive her for putting you in this position, for shooting you.
"Six months, my brother estimates. He is never wrong."
He was sure that he'd rather look for the "on switch" than listen to Sherlock asking Doctor John Watson to take him, so he tried to redirect Sherlock's mind into a different direction than the imagined
But Sherlock was fast. Too fast for Mycroft and Sherlock got downstairs before him, then running to the sitting room and down the corridor to close himself inside the bathroom. With Mycroft's jacket. With the rest of the cocaine. That was very much not good.
"Well, nothing
Oh, the silence right after the first wave, finally nothing is racing, nothing is obvious, right before he gives in compulsive redosing… Everything was for a reason; if he was focused on his body, he wasn’t thinking about
The beginning always felt like being thrown into the freezing water.
When the ventricle became full, the tricuspid valve shut closed to prevent blood from flowing backwards into the atrium, no hesitation anymore. You have to do this, you need to pump the blood again you need to make it flow, you need to breathe, Sherlock. Breathe.
"Moriarty… he… he is back," the first wave of shock seemed to lose control over Mycroft when he looked at John and then at his phone again. His face and posture were tense as if he couldn’t believe his senses anymore.

"What are we looking for exactly?"
"I know, Sherlock, I know," she was still there, calming him down, letting him cry.
patient, to accept that his little brother chose cocaine over talking him out of it? He would be downstairs in 30 seconds, maybe less. The steps sped up (nervous, appalled?) and Mycroft was already by the stairs.
His brother truly had an addictive personality. He could hardly understand drugs; the feeling, the ultimate off switch for his racing mind but
“Jesus Christ” he murmured finally turning the key. At this point, he was willing to sit on the stairs and just snort a nice dosage of cocaine right on his doorstep. It was late (ten minutes to 1 am) anyway, no one would see, no one would care, not anymore.
I could always sit on the couch to avoid it but I enjoy it. I sometimes look back at you also there are times I am too tired to play this game and I just go to my bed upstairs wishing you won't stay up all night. You need to sleep. But from time to time I just look back at you.
You like her, don't you? It was always a mystery to me. You never liked my girlfriends before, you found them stupid, never really bothered to remember their names. But it was somehow different from Mary, wasn't it?
"What's wrong?" words leave my mouth before I can stop them. He's going to tell me anyway, that's why he turned around.
. The detective couldn't control the sob that escaped his lips, maybe he was still not clear-headed enough to do so. It hurt him, to look at it, to touch it. He should have taken morphine, doctors prescribe it for pain. And he was hurting really bad.
Suddenly he remembers he is not alone. He reaches blindly forward with his one hand to get a grip of something or someone, not quite sure which would be better, and begs. With loud thump falls on his knees, inspecting his chest, trying to find some
You don't smile back, you look at Mycroft asking about some privacy with me. He looks surprised but doesn't question it.
He wrapped his arms around Sherlock, burying his face in his neck. That’s what he was supposed to do when Sherlock came back.
Do you know I thought about divorce in the middle of the night? About leaving her and going with you, wherever it would be? Of course, you know.
"What are you doing here, John? Shouldn't you be on the plane or something?"
His mind wouldn’t shut up, not yet. The sound of the Waltz was still present in his mind, like the song you can’t stop humming, no matter how hard you try. But the notes were getting ugly, major turned into minor in his head, legato transformed into some kind of wail, vibrato wasn’t perfectly balanced anymore, sounded more like a tremor than a deliberate movement. Exaggerated. Imperfect. Useless (feelings) piece of music. It was a solo, not a duet. Solo, always solo.
with it. Jesus Christ!
But you seem pleased. It's all about the truth in the end, right? Nothing satisfies you more than knowing the truth. There you have it. Your truth. My truth.
had happen-"
Sherlock was his
Any form of a lie wasn’t an option, skipping the subject either, hiding a coke- nope. All he could do was climb up the stairs and face his brother, with a needle and 2 grams of cocaine in his pocket. He would rather have the drug in his system already, feel how his heart rate increases, how the temperature of his body rises, experiencing the beginning of cognitive euphoria. Numbness overwhelming him, yes, cocaine combined with nicotine and he could feel his blood vessels narrowing; large arteries, small arterioles- doesn’t matter. The point is to feel his body, to feel how it all contracts, how it fights against the alkaloid filling every cell, crossing the blood-brain barrier, the breath deepens, the head is spinning, pupils dilating letting into the eyes more light, too much, not enough.
"Whatever you heard or you thought you heard I was high as a ki-" John's hand landed on his knee covered with a blanket.
He likes to say he is the British Government, is this the best they can do? After all those things you did for them, it would be nice to be a little bit more grateful.
The adrenaline kicked in and no force could stop him from destroying every bit of his hard work. But at this moment he wasn't thinking about it as of his work, not anymore. This was his curse to watch
when everything is silent, you are not sure if you’ll get your next breath. Maybe the heart stopped already and in seconds the whole life will flash before your eyes, the weird way of the brain to say goodbye. It might.

How are you?
Sherlock started to climb up the stairs.
which means...
“I don’t give a single fuck, Mycroft. Close the door behind you,” he muttered, leaving the room, not looking behind him. He knew his brother’s OCD won’t let him leave the downstairs flat with any indication of their past presence.
I think I would prefer you ending up in jail, where we could still see each other at least.
Trying to control shaking of their bodies they leaned further, breathes uneven, ragged, full of lust and thirst for the other person. Sherlock could feel the air escaping John's mouth on his lips causing him to inhale it deeply as if it was more vital than the rest of air. Breathing was boring, but not when he could breathe the same air as John Watson.
Initially, he tried to fight the overwhelming cold, that was paralyzing his body from head to toe. He could feel all of the three hundred muscles contracting and quivering at the same time to produce a little bit of warmth. And when he thought that his body run out of all available energy- everything halted, focused only on floating between the ice floes.
So they were in this together. Probably from the second John pulled the trigger at the Roland Kerr Further Education College.
John, John, let me have you.
He was thinking through the things he wanted to say to him while watching him sleep after his little session and in his head it sounded perfectly normal-
I want to tell you that I will never forget you but Mary and Mycroft are behind us.
You can see what I am going through, you can read me like an open book. But at the same time, I think you have no idea what is on my mind. I expect you to frown in a second because you don't understand, do you? You never really got it. Feelings. Human error as you said in the elevator. Is this what you think? If yes, how do you explain me being your pressure point? Oh, Sherlock,
Like there is no other proper answer to that question. Or maybe it's not the answer we have a problem with. Maybe that's about the question. Do we want to hear a real answer? Do you want to listen about how screwed up people's lives can be? I bet you don't.
But he knew it was pointless, it won’t take the hunger away. He should be honest with himself- he didn’t want a cigarette, he wanted something more to which smoke was a substitute, just like cases, just like
Mycroft makes a step forward, nodding towards us as he makes his way back to the black car. Right, there is nothing between us without Sherlock. Goodbye to you too, Mycroft.
"It's on the nightstand," he heard a familiar voice and his eyes snapped open.
reminds the whisper.
He would put the spoon into the drawer, previously thoroughly drying it with the green towel laying by the sink.
Sherlock stood up, his eyes wide open, looking anxiously behind John’s back, probably still in shock that he is back on the ground.
Before/After 9/11
"I came here with Mrs Hudson, to find you huddled in a ball on your bed... so high..."
I am scared, Sherlock. I need you here, with me. I will divorce, I will move back to Baker Street. I will do anything. I am desperate.
I was lying on my back, looking at the ceiling with such intensity like I could see a room above me if I concentrated hard enough. I was thinking about things that happened for the last few weeks. I was thinking about you. I tend to do that when everything around me is overwhelming. I imagine you just laying beside me with your eyes on the same ceiling as mine, not saying a word to me. It's comforting, you know? Your presence.
John took a shallow breath, focusing his eyes on the tarmac. He should concentrate on the things that were going on right now.
I can feel your forehead pressed to mine.
You already know that I care about you, that you are my best friend. No, let's not state the obvious, you don't like it. Sentiment.
Sherlock snorted attempting to sit up again, but he failed. Again.
"For God's sake, Sherlock! Open the do-" the sound of key turning inside the lock interrupted him and there he was. With his reddened eyes, bags underneath it and pale complexion, white powder visible on the edge of his nostrils.
He wanted to take more, Mycroft didn't want him to, so they will have a game of cat and mouse for next month or so before Sherlock either decides he's had enough or just stops fighting it and sinks to the bottom. He will sink every night a little bit more until some miracle happens and he stops. Maybe it's going to be a case, very consuming case or Lestrade will refuse to work with him until he gets clean (again). And everything will be back to normal. Without John. But normal.
Before/After WWI
The words seemed empty like they've been said just for the sake of saying them. They both knew it wasn't the truth. Mycroft sat down by the foot of the bed and pinched the bridge of his nose, visibly knackered. The silence felt heavy and Sherlock knew there was nothing more to say.
Sherlock finally crossed the doorstep and kicked the door shut behind him. Before he made the next step he hesitated for a second, leaning on the wall. The ghost of heavy breathing John Watson invaded his mind, walking past him, hanging his jacket right next to Sherlock’s head and stopping by the stairs.
"What's the difference?" your question is serious, not a single note of sarcasm in your voice. Sometimes I forget you are not real.
I let go of Mary and l look at your brother expectantly. Tell me, Mycroft. I need to know!
"Stop it! Stop at once!" trying to compose himself, he sat down next to Sherlock and put his palm on his brother's knee. "I'm here to help you, brother mine. Just let me help you."
Mary and Mycroft move to the side, to not interrupt us. Our last conversation- that's what you said. After that, I will never hear your voice again. The thought strikes through my head like the bullet that killed Magnussen. Suddenly I can't make myself look at you, damn it's hard. I can't understand why we should get used to goodbyes by now.
I want to tell you that I will miss you but Mary and Mycroft are behind us, listening to every word, despite the howling wind around.
Six months from now I will get drunk, thinking about you dying somewhere in Belarus or Ukraine. Maybe after a year, I'm going to think about you only between my shifts at the clinic on my way home. Then only at night when everything is quiet around me. Your face will slowly fade from my memory, your deep voice disappearing, evaporating because I can't make myself to imagine you talking to me, caressing my face.
"I bet you won't resist the cigarette. How long has it been, Sherlock? Three months without a
The warm fondness spilt out in his chest and took all his strength to not hug the device to his heart. Mentally he was already sitting in his chair, listening to Sherlock’s violin as he sipped his tea. He could almost smell Mrs Hudson’s scones when he washed the dishes and Sherlock’s expensive shampoo after he entered the bathroom right after him. He could smell Baker Street.
"For how long?" I have to ask.
He couldn’t remind himself when was the last time he was enjoying the view of needle’s barrel filling itself with cocaine. It was a long time ago, before John.
And you were leaving me again, shattered. This time I shattered the moment you blew Magnussen's head off. Everyone could hear it- anti-terrorists, Mycroft all of them heard a loud bang. Was it my heart or bullet exiting the barrel, the pressure of the explosion suddenly released? You said Mary was safe now, was it all about Mary? Was it worth it in the end? My hands in the air, eyes focused on you. Oh Christ, Sherlock, what have you done?
Add water, mix it up. He switched on the lighter under spoon as fast as possible, tremble in his leg intensifying.
Mary turned towards John, shielding her eyes from the sun.
I want to tell you how much you mean to me and how tired I am of denying the feelings I have towards you but Mary and Mycroft are behind us.
He touched his forehead to check the temperature. It’s really warm, but before John could tell the others to call for an ambulance, Sherlock’s eyes snapped open.
But Sherlock was already handing them a piece of paper, which landed on the ground so John picked it up, trying to remain calm.
But we are not married, Sherlock.
"John will notice, he will see I'm not breathing, there is no pulse! He will notice!"
The big clock with red numbers in Sherlock’s mind was counting down a minute when he got up and unsteadily made his way to the sink to pour out the rest of the water from the glass and rinse the spoon of the remainings of his drug. He put it back on the dryer and on his way out, put the lighter on its place, shoving plastic packages to his trouser’s pocket. He didn’t care if Mrs Hudson spotted there was something wrong with her kitchen if anyone was here. He
Are you telling me I shouldn't blame her? That after you leave I should give Mary a second chance and have children with her?
"Sherlock, there are so many things I would like to tell you..."
Well, it depends.
“I was immersed.”
“No!” Sherlock’s eyes shot wide and in one swift motion pushed the plunger all in. Cool cocaine entered his body. The war was over.
But he did.
But now he knows the feeling of
“Ah, such a relief. I was so worried… Oh, wait, I wasn’t.”
Sherlock never...
Mycroft's car stops abruptly and he gets out. He is on the phone, a mixture of shock and fear on his face, furrowed brows.
John exhaled all the air he’s been holding since he entered the plane, closing the gap between them.
He muted the silent question of Hudders asking Mycroft what was wrong. If he didn't, he would burst from all those feelings like an overfilled with an air balloon. He started rocking, praying (there is no God, silly) for this woman to disappear.
Holmes' piercing gaze was tracing every information hanging on the wall, even if he couldn't make much of it because of the dimmed light in the room provided only by the small lamp in the corner. He threw a glance at his brother and stood up, admiring his work. First, he thought with amusement that Sherlock's OCD was worse than his (
Mycroft made a step forward and looked around, not having a clue, what is it that he should be looking for.
"But, John, you got married yesterday you have..."
Mary straightened up in her seat as well as Mycroft, who was looking even more alarmed than he was already after seeing the list.
You say my name and I can't resist. I look at you and just like that I am not able to look away. Your lips are curved into a little smile that does not reach your eyes. You want to say something that makes me smile, that's a good strategy. Good. Make me smile, Sherlock. Please, because I am confident that when the plane takes off I will never smile again.
John sighted not sure where to go from there. It shouldn't be this hard, he was a grown man, for Christ's sake! But it was. Because first- he was a British man and talking about his
You in captivity? I can't imagine it, no... you are made to be free, shoot at the wall, play the violin in the middle of the night, beat up corpses before the breakfast. It would kill you.
You are my best friend, someone I would die for, someone I would kill for but you know that. I already did it after knowing you for less than 24 hours. Who does that? Now you killed for me, at least that's what I can assume, which is based on your twisted logic. This is insane. All of it is.
"No, you wouldn't. We were in his office, for fuck's sake, you proposed to get in there and if it wasn't for Mary, we would've known the letters weren't in the safe. We would've left, you wouldn't have been shot. Everything went awry because she didn't want her lies to resurface."
Is this how all those kids feel when they discover their sexuality and there is no one to support them? Do they feel shame like I did when the first time thought of hugging and kissing you occurred to me? It shouldn't, but it did. I am so sorry.
I think about your name. William is a nice name, you never told me that Sherlock isn't your first name or why you never use it. Is it too
The silence was piercing through his ears, drilling its way into his skull passing all the barriers of the external ear, the tympanic membrane, the internal ear, making his temporal lobe vibrate in anxiousness.
So I say I am fine. It's easier that way.
John felt like crying, his chest full of emotions blended together- anger, hope and hopelessness at the same time (was that even possible?), confusion, shame, and everything in between.
John stood there with Mary by his side watching two out of three black cars drive away. He needed tea, to sort out everything that happened in the last twenty-four hours. A big cup of tea.
didn’t care. At this point, his brain decided to only fasten the seatbelts and prepare for the ride he hasn’t been on for a while now.
The landing gear hit the ground and in a reflex, John couldn’t control, he let go of Mary’s hand.
Was it After John already? When it came to war it wasn’t really hard to establish the end of it
Their lips finally met pressing against each other, slowly tasting and teasing like it's been the very first time or the hundredth, moving and rubbing and holding desperately.
His eyelids got heavy, suddenly costing too much effort to keep them parted. To see (
None of them knew that in thirty hours one of the above will happen.
The creak of the floor above Sherlock pulls him out of his thoughts and he finds himself staring at the brand new syringe like it’s a solution to all his problems and something he’s never seen before at the same time.
Three seconds of nothingness are embracing him, his chest, his body, his mind. He overcomes the panic now, but the first time he experienced this particular feeling of nothing he called his mother out loud. He thought he was dying.
Sherlock started to clutch at his shirt, not making any sound, just staring blankly at the ceiling, not noticing his brother crouching on the lower stair, taking his pulse. Tachycardia. Not a surprise.
John smiled and it quickly transformed into full laughter, with Sherlock beaming at him. What made him laugh, he wasn't sure in the first place but it wasn't important. Does he need to think about every detail, every reason for his actions?
Was he going through shock? It must have been a psychological shock because he was just in pain and grieve, he just made a peace with not seeing Sherlock ever again (ok, not really) and suddenly the numb feeling taking over his limbs was overflowing him, making it impossible to breathe properly, yet allowed him to actually believe that Sherlock was coming back to him.
The ceiling was spinning and he needed a few seconds to realize he's laying on his back in a horizontal position on John's bed, breathing heavily and clutching something fiercely in his hand. The ultimate on-switch. Sherlock raised his hand to his eyes, hearing the sound of metal hitting metal as he did so, only to finally focus his gaze on John's dog tags- his
The hand was on his thigh now, John's body sixty centimetres closer. He could smell him- citrus, cedar and pine tree. His sheets were going to smell like him for a little while. Good.
I take a step closer, we are out of earshot which should be comforting if I actually knew what to say to you. What do you say to the person you are seeing for the last time?
“Look after him. Please,” his face turned soft, almost painfully hopeless in its vulnerability.
"Sherlock, I'm not going to be angry with you, but please open the door. I'll help you, I will just..." he could hear the sound of Sherlock snorting cocaine. Too late. Cocaine was again in his system.
"Why are you still here? Don't you have governments to bribe or something?"
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes."
He is taking it away! Panic.
I let a little chuckle escape through my lips.
Sherlock, who wasn't very good at it too. Talk about complicated situations.
"I have done that in the past, ready to give up my life for the truth, do you remember? Study in Pink as you call it" you throw your hand dismissively in the air as a sign how dumb you think this title is. But I know you like it, you wouldn't remember it, if you didn't like it. Because that's what you do with unnecessary information, you delete it. "I risked my own life to prove I am the smartest in the room. That's what I do and there is no one else to blame, especially not Mary."
“What did you say?”
"Sherlock, I don't like repeating myself. Do you want more?"
"The drug you've purchased is already down the drain, the syringe bent and thrown to the bin," he lied without blinking.
He joined Mary and Sherlock outside, listening to their conversation about Moriarty being dead,
"You never vowed me anything. You always made sure I know how you are and who you are."
Water spilled over the top of the glass and Sherlock hissed with exasperation, turning off the tap and emptying the vessel, so it’s only half empty (full?).
"That's the whole of it. If you would look for baby names in the future."
We take closer steps, to find out what is wrong. I would rather know this time, you would be proud.
I know you can take my pulse, you always do that when you have an opportunity and I have no clue why. Maybe it's your way of finding out about feelings, physical attraction or just some kind of body reflexes. I'm an ordinary doctor, all I know is a medical aspect of it but nothing is just the way it is for you, isn't it?
"Moriarty... he... he is back" the first wave of a shock seems to lose control over your brother when he looks at me and then back at the phone.
Moriarty put his hand softly on Sherlock’s one that was holding a syringe and pushed it a little.
even if lasted only for one minute, was already shit. Water, his brain pleaded, bring me some water...
Four meters.
The ping of his phone brought him back. He took his phone out of the trouser’s pocket and lifted his eyebrows in surprise. Text from Sherlock? John unlocked his phone to read it.
The older brother tried the handle but it was locked. Even if the door were old, Mycroft just couldn't force the door, he was the brain, not the muscles, he had people for that kind of things. Bugger for the second time. The only thing left was the negotiations.
Mycroft pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, not managing taking care of Sherlock at this point. He felt helpless because all he could do was just look at how Sherlock was swaying back and forth on the floor while moaning John's name. Whimpered supplications escaping brunet's mouth made Mycroft uncomfortable, he wasn't interested in his brother's desires and he didn't want to know the details of Sherlock's fantasies. It made him cringe to even think that his younger brother might be
"Ah, you know, they have children, can't escape the slang," John winked at him, leaning against the door jamb.
"Damn it!"
"Sherlock? Sherlock, do you want to look for the switch in your bedroom? Maybe you left it in the-" he didn't even finish the sentence, because Sherlock's bloodshot, wet eyes shot open and in a matter of seconds sprung up to run towards John's bedroom upstairs.
You can't promise me shit. It's up to me and I know it. And if it's up to me, then I know I will think about you. At first in every minute, then every hour.
Lips moving against each other in a dance called desire. Your nails digging into my shoulder blades to pull me closer. God, Sherlock.
Mycroft got back to the vehicle and John could only hear a small part of the conversation.
The look John gave him was sobering. Frozen in place, with water in his hands Sherlock couldn't take his eyes off of his friend, wishing suddenly he didn't take the cocaine yesterday.
Inhale. Exhale. Next three seconds and your life last for only three seconds. That’s all you get. Take it or leave it.
John clenched his teeth. Right. Mary won’t be happy about it. He took a deep breath, to hell with it!
to find it, for John. John would be so mad if he lost it. He finishes his shift at surgery soon and will come back home. He couldn't tell him, he's lost it!
We had a really bad timing I guess. Could have been better. But that's okay now. It is what it is.
It was what it was and it was them all along.
The hand was moving up and down his back in a soothing manner.
Before/After the Industrial Revolution
after all.
Sherlock rolled eyes at his brother but obediently opened the car door to get inside the vehicle. For a second his gaze lingered on John, with his mouth open to say something but he quickly looked around and thought better of it, disappearing inside the car.
The sound of multiple steps on the stairs leading to the plane pulled John out of his comforting cocoon, forcing him to clench his hands into fists on the material of the detective's jacket for the last time and let go. How much effort it took him to separate himself from his friend, only John knew.
“Everything you’ve taken.”
Your touch resonates through my body along the spine straight to the brain, which considers this impulse to be enough to release monthly supply of dopamine into my blood system making me high.
"More, where is more? Where is my syringe? I bought two grams of coke, where is the rest? I need more."
I am tired, Sherlock.
Ending compatible with the plot of the season 3, let's call it the sad one.

eager.
wedding. I said it at your wedding, to all those people! And they were laughing and crying! Can you imagine?"
I can apologize- no, I have nothing to apologize for. Maybe for the punches, I gave you when you came back? I never said sorry for them... but it doesn't matter, not now at least.
"Yes," John scratched the back of his neck. "I still want to raise the kid but... Sherlock, will you have me? I'm far from perfect and I hurt you by getting married and I'm aware that you never really wanted to have a..."
‘Holmes, if we are to watch the storm together, go instantly to your room and put on socks and slippers. And smalls would not come amiss either. The air is chill near the window, and I doubt either of us will be sleeping for a while. This is a truly majestic spectacle,’ he went on, gesturing at the scene outside. “I have rarely seen one as tremendous, not even in the hill country in India.’
‘I am not surprised, it must be a quarter of an inch long. Hold still, Holmes, there is more. I will lay the pieces on a swab for you and then you may see what you have done to yourself.’
‘London,’ he said, gesturing at the whole smoky city spread out before us.
‘I won’t. I was terrified. ‘John, John, if this is – is this the drug? I will never forgive myself if it is. Tell me it is not the drug.’ I felt his pulse. ‘It cannot be, surely it must not be so. Your pulse is dropping, see, it is a mere temporary affliction, you will be well in a trice.’
‘Watson,’ I was half minded to argue the point with him, for I do not, I most decidedly do not, snore, but he put up a hand, conceding.
‘I fought no-one. It was a tree I hit: an oak, possibly. I was so angry, could not think. I went to Primrose Hill that there might be none to hear my curses. Oh God - ’ he fetched a deep sigh, ‘Sherlock, my dear, my very dear. Primrose Hill: where first we walked together.’
‘You did not like Trevelyan, and so I have not informed you of what I was about these last few days. But it has grieved me to be secret with you,’ – they were his very words from the night before – ‘and since I have, in sort, received my patient’s permission to inform you of our dealings, I must do so. I do not believe you were aware of this, Holmes – you are such an innocent in some matters of the world – but the relationship between Trevelyan and Sutton was not only a business one. Trevelyan was, in short, Sutton’s paramour, brought thereto by no real affection but by a lively sense of obligation, and some strong, coercive suasion. I am sure it seems odd to you, who are all purity of mind, that a man might stoop so far, but I beg you will refrain from censure, at least for my sake as his physician. To shorten my tale for you, I saw this at once, having had experience of seeing such abuse in the army – I will not bore you with details of the unfortunate young man under my command whom I had to rescue from similar sorry circumstances – and I saw also certain symptoms in Trevelyan that gave me cause for concern. You may have remarked his eyes: that irregularity in the pupils? That, his pallor, and a hesitation in his gait, coupled with certain tests I did after we concluded our case, make it quite clear. Trevelyan has contracted the
Author's note.
We heard nothing more from Moriarty and nothing from Moran. I spoke to the Irregulars, discovering that alongside my small network of street waifs, there was another: the boys who assisted in burglaries, being sent to crawl through smaller windows than gave ingress for a fully grown man. They appeared to have no lair -  but the house with two doors was known to them, and spoken of not just with respect, but fear. I was careful in my investigations, so as not to put my own children in danger, and discovered that it was Worth who recruited this pack of juveniles, and lent them to his principal as spies. I found no evidence that Worth’s boys had infiltrated my network, but I began to have concerns about the safety of my children.
'Tut, man, what of it an it were to be habitual? Is it any man’s business what hours a gentleman keeps? No, it is not habitual in the sense that it is every night, or even regular nights, although as I said, I am disposed to be available to be called on Thursday and Friday nights, as others of my colleagues are on other nights. It is all very informal, you know, and there are often Thursdays and Fridays when there is no need for my services. But you must remember that I am a doctor, Gregson. We all of us keep irregular hours: people fall ill at inconvenient times, and I must earn my money as occasion arises. So, no, I do not habitually do anything, and I am as fond of sleep as the next man, I suppose, it is only that my profession keeps me from my bed at times.'
‘Will we ever be safe?’ He closed his eyes, anguish graven into every feature, and it was plain to see how much the events of the year and of the early autumn had affected him - for the murder of Mary Ann Nichols, for which Watson had been denounced, had been succeeded, a week later upon the 8th of September, by that of Annie Chapman, killed and savagely mutilated in Spitalfields in similar fashion to her unfortunate sister in the sisterhood of the fallen and forlorn. Watson had, fortunately for him, had an impeccable alibi for that event: he was dining with Lestrade at a coffee house. Moriarty’s spies had let him down there, I reflected, grimly. There had been no more murders since. But whether the killer was some deranged man whose atrocities were simply being used by the wily professor, or whether he was employing a hired killer to kill to order when he might fasten the guilt on Watson, I wanted Watson safe, and not just from accusations of sodomy.
‘I still want it.’ I had to be honest with him. ‘I still crave it – quite desperately, sometimes. Often, John. Do not think I do not. I do – and I wonder if it will ever go away. It nags at me, a constant undercurrent, when I am sad, or bored, when the world seems black, and we get nowhere with this wretched business of the Professor and Colonel Moran, or when we look at the underlying causes of these recent riots, and ponder the inequity, the injustices that have provoked them. The craving is a chasm at my feet, and I but one step away from it. Oh, that stings; there is a cut.’
‘But Forrester is a good fellow – and it will not harm us to help him. He is kindly disposed towards you: we cannot afford to pass up any good interest we can obtain. Cases are not plentiful of late – Gregson has put none our way for months, and Lestrade has had nothing for us either, not that it is that he does not want to, but all domestic investigations have been put on hold for the police to deal with this terrible rioting -  and our coffers are low again. And matters are not shaping well for men like us, men who – for men who - ’

‘He was always a smartly turned out gentleman,’ she agreed, solemnly. ‘I shall send Janey up directly with your breakfast, gentlemen. Good morning, Dr Watson,’ as he entered the room. ‘I trust you slept well. By the way, your overcoat is sadly splashed with mud, I notice. If you will let me have it, Janey shall dry it, and go over it with spirits of hartshorn and a stiff brush for you, to furbish it up before you wear it again.’
He caught my sleeve. ‘Stay, Holmes. Your highly placed principal who met Lestrade with Adolphus Williams – oh, do not look at me like that, of course he is highly placed or you and Lestrade would not have been put onto this trail – do you think he is involved in this? I have not speculated as to his identity - ’
'I will die if I lose you, John.'
‘More than I had thought I would,’ he admitted, and cleared his throat. ‘I – damn it, Holmes, it is not that I do not enjoy music. It is that it moves me sometimes unbearably – stirs that in me which I would fain -  ’
And it will mean we can sit together, I thought. Perhaps we might touch
“If it were now to die,” I thought, as I paused for breath, my mind leaping to a completely different writer, “If it were now to die, ‘twere now to be most happy, for my soul hath her content so absolute” . . . oh, John, John. I do so love you.
‘You see this as a chess game?’
‘ - I did not think you had any more to do with those people after the Criminal Law Amendment Act. So you are going to assist a woman doctor. I see. Of course, you were the obvious choice: you have told me before Dr Jex-Blake runs a dispensary for the poor, and you are becoming well-known in the field. But perhaps I presume, and you do not want me to come with you?’
‘But will it be acted upon? Mycroft - ’ I placed my hand cautiously on his arm - we were not wont to touch each other, but I wished to comfort him – and he patted my hand with an uncertain air. ‘Surely it will be exceptionally hard to obtain a conviction? Men will not, will surely not destroy each other when they are bound in affection: so who is to know what is done behind closed doors?’
‘I think so: “ . . . non humilis domos fastidit umbrosamque ripam” is that how it goes? Disdains neither the, the humble cottage, the shady river bank . . . and I forget - ’
‘Come to those later. Meiklejohn is acting on instruction. Have you heard any names that signify as movers in this matter? Any at all?’
The Earl of Durham’s Nullity case against his wife, Ethel Milner, is exactly as reported. Lady Sheffield was one of the main witnesses for the defence. It took weeks to research everything, including contacting a couple of County Archivists. The judge’s summing up made it clear where his sympathies lay. Ethel Milner remained in custody until just before she died in 1931, aged 71. Her ‘crime’ was not just her refusing a marital relationship, but not talking to the doctors in a suitably emollient and submissive fashion: she persistently stonewalled their questions, and they became spiteful. I referenced this case, because there had to be a start point and a reason for so many women coming to Holmes and Watson for help.
‘Then it may depend upon it out of doors for the festive season,’ she told me. ‘If it is flesh you have decomposing, Mr Holmes, it is not doing so in here. The mutton chop you disposed of under the sofa was bad enough.’
‘ - despite your having received a visit from Abberline this morning, and despite your assurance to him that Watson was not abroad last night when that unfortunate woman, Mary Jane Kelly, was murdered and so dreadfully mutilated, I have men who will swear him to be the murderer tomorrow. And if it is only his word and yours that he lay at your home last night - unless of course, you are prepared to implicate yourself as his paramour and expose an intimate connection for the sake of giving him an alibi . . . then I do not think you will save him, this time . . .’
The Dublin Castle Scandal was over by the time we enter this chapter: its ramifications were not. They would reverberate politically for some years.
look at me in that fashion and when I see you with your eyes narrowed in laughter, and the little creases at their corners and your mouth quirked I want you to
‘So circumstantial evidence shows us the man at the time and place of the murder? On what grounds? The tools? And you have them there?’
I gladly took the crumpled sheet from his hand (ladies' tea parties, forsooth!) as I crossed to the fire to refill my pipe from our Persian slipper. I rolled the unwelcome missive into a ball, and dropped it on the flames, using the poker to embed it deep in the coals and ensure it was well alight.
‘I have no idea either; I swear I did not leave it there when I returned yesterday. No matter. It is pleasant, is it not, Holmes, to be able to do a little good? I am grateful for poor Mr Holder’s generosity, for we can spread it far and wide. It is surprising to me how much real benefit and unalloyed joy may be bought with the expense of but a few pounds - surprising, and so pleasant that I wonder more do not avail themselves of the opportunity.’
‘Let me take them off, Watson, you must not spoil them. They cost me dear.’
This chapter was conceived because there must have been a time when Watson became fully aware of Holmes' drug use, and I wanted to write that. I also wanted to find a case that might fit in to that time period when they were just learning about each other.
‘It is your heart that is the kind one, Holmes, and I trust it to remain so. Tell me, did you meet Moran? I am anxious to know how you removed the jewels from him. He must have been in dire need of money to take such a risk: I had not thought he would. But I suppose if he were desperate, he might think the game worth playing. And you managed to conceal from him that the stones were fake?’
He was scarlet again. ‘Holmes, we share rooms. We are fond and familiar together.’ At least he owned it. ‘I – I am not, not detached, as a physician should be with you. I was distressed for you yesterday, and I embraced you for comfort – for my comfort.’
Details about the train journey to Bournemouth, including the nickname for the LSWR, are accurate.
‘He looks dangerous: violence sits on that front and gleams in his fierce eye. He is wary as a wild beast himself, just see how he glances around. I wonder much to see him with a man I last saw – or believed I had seen – must indeed have seen -bartering for diamonds in a dirty estaminet in Antwerp. I must learn more of Mr Henry Judson Raymond. Or Mr Adam Worth, as he is known to Pinkertons, the Yard and the Sûreté. For that is who stands with your military friend.’
I reflected, sardonically, that but a few weeks ago it had been a shame and a sin to let Mrs Hudson’s syllabub go to waste, and that the two things were by no means comparable in importance, murmuring, meanwhile, an agreement to Tchaikovsky’s comments about our judicial system, and our police work (which he compared to his own, to Russia’s detriment).
‘ “Any male person who, in public or in private, commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures (a) or attempts (b) to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency (c) with another male person, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour.” Mycroft, what is this? Where has this come from? This surely means - ’
In the same month too, we travelled to Norfolk, that county of reeds and slow-moving water, and open skies, on a case that Lestrade had asked us to observe. A certain young man, Mark Knights by name, had been accused under the new Act of unnatural crimes. His accuser then withdrew the accusation before it had been sworn to, and offered no evidence in support of it. Knights admitted sodomy upon oath before a magistrate, and implicated two others – against whom there was no evidence either - in his crime. The judge in the case, Mr Justice James Stephens, an old friend of Lestrade’s, received us with some gratitude, and owned to a measure of perplexity, for, as he said, there existed no evidence against the man, Knights, other than his sworn deposition - and the fact that he had given evidence on his sworn oath of having been accomplice to an act of unnatural crime meant that he could not be convicted of it. His own words could not, uncorroborated, condemn him.
‘Watson, when I performed the electrolysis experiment - ’
‘I felt your absence like a rift in my heart.’ I felt him touch his lips to my hair. ‘I – I do not know what to say to you to express it. Why did you not tell me you were so overstrained, Sherlock? I would have left Hayter and come to you: of course you would always have precedence. Was it the drugs? You thought I would be angry?’
‘Have you been here all night?’ I asked. Shame now, not nausea, twisted my gut. ‘I do not deserve such kindness. I am so very sorry, pray do forgive me, Watson.’
‘Forgive me, Mr Holmes,’ replied Lestrade, ‘but I have just this moment managed to persuade my colleague here, Dr Stevenson, to call upon you . . .’
Watson was sharper than I. ‘You wished to speak to us about our work? What is it you are saying, Lestrade? That Holmes and I might not always choose to be at the Yard? Or that we might not always be welcome at the Yard?’
I opened the telegram first, lest it be bad news.
‘I understand that you enjoy the way your mind works when you take cocaine. I am a dull man, compared to you, but even I can appreciate the thrill, the lust for knowledge that can seize and transport a man: when I myself have tracked the disease to its hiding place in the body, when I prepare my armament of drugs and instruments and put on my armour of knowledge -  when I fight the evil and overcome it, and see my patient – my former patient -  walk whole and sound into the sun, do you not think that I then feel that thrill pervading my veins? I am uplifted: I am as a God . . . until the next time, of course. So I do understand what it is to soar. But for myself, I never soar without a corresponding fall: when I am waiting for the next patient, when I remember how few the victories are, how mighty the enemy, how unending and bloody the battle.’
‘Oh, I am off to a lecture this afternoon with Thompson. I knew you would be busy with the Pimlico Poisoning case since you mentioned that you would be going to the Yard. When you see Lestrade, my dear fellow, would you do me the kindness of letting him know I shall be visiting this evening? I must speak to Mrs Lestrade about Polly: you recall, she is gone to the convalescent home in Cornwall, and Lestrade and his wife are to go to visit her very shortly?’
‘The programme is exciting, with all the music I like best: and Richter a brilliant conductor. And I am not in the mood for sobriety tonight: I expect an intellectual feast. It will be dazzling, and so you must dazzle too.’
I could not get out of my head the events of the trial. Young Osborn had accosted Marling - a wealthy young fool but five years older than he - asking for a drink. They could have drunk in any convenient hostelry rather than adjourn to those rooms: it appeared clear to me why they had done so – and why on turning the boy away afterwards he had parted with first a sovereign, and then two guineas more. It was Osborn’s greed that had led Marling to inform upon him to the police, saying that he had been blackmailed. The judge had been severe. He had been severe upon Marling too, commenting what a curious thing - and a foolish thing – it was of him to do, taking a chance-met lad from the street into his rooms ‘for a drink’. He was no fool, Lord Justice Day; he well knew what had transpired in those rooms in Jermyn Street. But he had been more severe upon Osborn, for Osborn was accustomed to doing this sort of thing, was, in fact, well known to the police for it. The common bounce was his livelihood, just as it was for Andrew Grant, and so they had taken the opportunity to put a stop to his games. I had little sympathy for a blackmailer: had it not been for the grace of God and Jack Saul, my Watson would have found himself in as dire a case, some trumped up story concocted to explain his presence in Cleveland Street, and evidence, perhaps, planted. His would have been the name blown upon, his the reputation ruined, his the shame and disgrace. And he would not have appeared so innocent: Grant and Coulton would have seen to that. But yet, Osborn was only seventeen – seventeen, and now doomed to suffer for life . . . His crimes were black, the punishment black, the fact that there was such a crime, such a punishment for a man’s nature, a sanction for his need, those needs perverted into crime and the fulfilling of the needs itself considered to be perverse: all was black, black, black . . .
Notes for Part 10
‘Read on; translate, Watson.’
As always, any historical personage, event, document, weather event, or political movement mentioned is well documented in either the press or official records (diplomatic list, papal encyclicals, e.g.) of the period.
‘If I have become a good man it is by living with one,’ I replied. ‘Do not call yourself lame, Watson, You are not lame. Nor infirm, nor sickly.’
<< The problem, Sherlock, is that people keep taking us for a couple >>.
<< They advised me to leave to reach Threlkeld just to avoid the storm >>.
John thinks. His patient's coughing, brings him back to reality. John fill in the recipe quickly, feeling the need to send the old man away.
<< No. Morgan is capable to be very clear >> Sherlock admits and Morgan agrees barking.
<< What? >>.
<< Sorry if I make you partakers of this thing that has nothing more to do with your investigations >> says the woman, wiping a fallen tear to her face.
<< You know, John, I should be mortally pissed at you >> Greg says, seriously. The doctor, surprised, is speechless. << Before your arrival nobody knew, officially at least, who was the real architect of my successes. I got promotions, commendations, praise and many other things for five years. Then you came into his life >>, Greg says, pointing with a finger, << with your blog and your posts. Sherlock became famous and everyone knew who really solved the difficult cases that many joys had given me. Do you know why, on the other hand, I'm not pissed at you at all? >>.
<< Don't open ... >>.
<< Ms Ford's new course started in January. Since March, episodes that could be defined as stolkerage have started. Episodes that Mr Ford has completely ignored but that Ms Ford took into great consideration. To the point of trying to save her son in case the stalker physically enters their home. Ms Ford was scared, because she understood that someone stalkers her. The same person that  killed the family dog. The same that destroyed the windows with a stone wrapped in a sheets of paper carrying a messages for her unknown to us. The same that terrified her with continuous anonymous telephone rings >>.
<< You barely remember to look after yourself, Sherlock, of course I think so! >> John says, closing the door of the apartment behind him. He doesn't take a shower, but at the moment it is not a serious problem like being able to put one foot in front of everyone without falling. John undressing while he go up to his room. Throws his clothes on the ground and lay on the bed, falling asleep even before touching the pillow.
'The man is important, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in touch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark, the jackal with the lion—anything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sinister—in the highest degree sinister. That is where he comes within my purview. He is an associate of Professor Moriarty’s. He is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound link—between ourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able to test it.'
The trial was set for August, and we awaited its beginning with trepidation. I was able, with Watson’s help, to gather enough evidence of Meiklejohn’s intimidation and coercion of witnesses, blackmail of suspects, and attempts to rig the jury, to offer Mycroft at least the opportunity of stripping the prosecution’s main witness hunter of his credibility, but there was so much evidence that there were, in fact, numerous men in Ireland, just as there were in England, who committed acts with each other that were punishable by a lifetime of penal servitude, that we could not hope to stave off a trial. Public sentiment demanded it: outrage was the order of the day. Politically motivated – and justifiable - hatred of the oppressor would bring the defendants to court. But they were scapegoats for their political masters, and would be ruined for something they could no more change than they could change the colour of the hair they were born with.
We discoursed for some minutes on comparative linguistics – a study in which he, of course, was far more practised than I - and I showed him my list. He remarked upon how the
‘Holmes!’ He stopped in his tracks, and I took his arm and urged him on again.
Sherlock’s conversation with Mycroft tells you one very important fact about their parents. It’s a small word that’s the crucial one.
Within minutes after the doubled dose I felt that now familiar sense of strength and vigour imparted to my limbs: I experienced a sensation of renewed mental acuity as if I could have worked for hours, and of physical energy that drove me to the door, eager for our outing. Watson reported the same: upon taking his pulse he found it perceptibly higher than its normal rate, the heart bounding rapidly along. My pulse was also slightly elevated, he told me, and my hand hotter than its wont. My usual pallor did not change: he quickly acquired a fine rosy blush, which also went with an elevated skin temperature. The moonlight cooled our skins a little as soon as we were out of doors, but we were not uncomfortably cold despite the March breeze: the drug providing an inner warmth as it did to the original Inca in their high plains. By common, silent consent, we struck away from the more frequented streets and skirted Regent’s Park towards the privacy of Primrose Hill.
And then came the French affair. ‘Baron Maupertuis and the Netherland-Sumatra Company’ is how Watson immortalised it when he wrote of it, although I would have thought it would be plain to the dullest of his readers that had I been dealing only with the Netherlands, I would never have ended up even in fiction in a hotel in Lyons. He used the spurious title as a cover for my real activities, which were, to put it bluntly, investigating those agents of foreign governments who were fomenting dissension between France and Germany along the Alsace-Lorraine border, and blaming the resultant chaos and warmongering on England and the English press.
‘Indeed,’ I replied, ‘and here, look, here is a strange thing -  there is no congruence at all in this case: we clearly derive ‘sailor’ from
*****
‘More than you think,’ he muttered. His thumb pressed gently along the gash, and I winced. ‘Yes, there is glass there, I can see it. We will have that out.’ I felt a sharp prick as his forceps withdrew what must have been a sizeable shard.
He held out a shaking hand, his face still turned from me, and I placed the glass within it. He trembled so much that I had to put my hand over his and guide it to his lips. I could not think what to say to the man – I had meant so well, and done so ill. Once he was steadier, and sipping the brandy, I would have released his hand, and moved away, but he detained me.
The Wilde Trials were rooted much further back than people suppose. ‘Poor gentle Drumlanrig’ shot himself in 1894, after his affair with Rosebery caused trouble with his father, and political trouble for Rosebery.
We had had, for the last week, the pleasing relief of an ordinary case, as opposed to unravelling Moriarty's net, and I was glad of it, for clean simple action, and the knowledge that human evil, not the inhuman calculations of a devil in human form lay behind the case eased both our minds. James Barclay had done the quondam Nancy Devoy a grave wrong when he played David to her Bathsheba, and had Henry Wood, her more favoured lover, abducted and sent into torture and captivity, that he might have no rival, but he had paid lifelong for his evil act. He had never been sure of her, by all accounts. His love had outworn whatever affection she conjured up for him when she had at last acknowledged that Wood was dead and would never return to her, and had married the less favoured suitor perhaps out of sheer weariness at his importunity. Her love for him, a weakly guttering flame for years, had wavered and died the moment she saw the wreck of a man that Henry had become, and had learned from his own lips of Barclay's treachery. Barclay, confronted with evidence of his crime, seeing a man he thought long dead before him, had died of apoplexy: it was well for him that he had, for she would never have stayed with him, no matter what the cost to her. One brief interview with her in the aftermath of the case had made that clear to us.
Within minutes, he was snoring, a gentle, almost musical little snore that made me smile. I did not sleep. I lay, and slowly grew warm, and enjoyed his breath on my neck, the curve of his arm across my waist, for he had flung it over me as he shifted, and the lovely, solid weight of him against my back. I savoured the sight and sound and scent of every minute of the four hours he slept, rising only when he began to stir and wake, so that he should find me washed and decent when he did. He scolded me for not sleeping but I countered that I was feeling infinitely better for the rest, and he must not abuse his doctor’s power over me. We returned to London in the best of spirits, laughing and joking like boys, and recounted the story of the snake to Mrs Hudson, who was much impressed. And although I cautioned Watson that he must not publish the story yet, I enjoyed the stirring tale he made of it when he wrote it up over the course of the following week and gave it me to read.
