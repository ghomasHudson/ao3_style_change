Cas fiddled with some heart-shaped decorations for a bit that seemed to be made out of straw, but then he put them down again and pulled Dean further aside. “The Charlie from apocalypse world... She took off pretty much as soon as she got to this world, remember?” Dean nodded. “Sam managed to convince her to come back, to work with us, at least every now and then. I think they became friends. I suppose it is thanks to him that her behaviour towards me is civil.”
For a moment, Castiel thought of Sam, the way he had taken responsibility when no one else had seemed up for the task, when everyone else had been too scared and helpless to provide guidance. Perhaps this was the same.
Several minutes and lots of duct tape later, the thing was as attached to the roof railing as it possibly could be without a binding spell, so they took off towards the bunker again. It was already mid-afternoon by the time they got there, but after unloading and putting away the groceries, they spent a few minutes unfastening the tree again, then carried it into the library and set it up. On the tables in the middle of the library, they spread out the stuff from the wish list (except what required cooling), then arranged them into piles and put name tags on them so everyone would know what was theirs and what wasn't.
“'Your worship', or 'High Priestx' will suffice. You're expected to bow to them. Don't be surprised by their age, they're younger than you. But not by much.” Castiel put both hands on Dean's face, making him look up at him. “Will you be alright? I really must be off.”
“It's good.” Dean wiggled his fingers. “No harm done. I'm just glad we didn't lose any of the pies.”
“Yeah, you should have.” But the venom had left his voice, his anger deflated at Cas' admission. “I mean, I still would've blamed myself, but at least I'd have been prepared, ya know?”
“Yeah, yeah. Whatever. We're gonna go get some bacon later.” Dean dropped his loot on the kitchen counter, then went to fetch himself a pan and turn on one of the hotplates. “Hey, pass me the butter.”
“Greedy?” Dean stared down at the Prince, who was still just lying on his bed, arms crossed under his head.
“Right. Since Michael's death, not much has changed, but then not all of them seem to even know that he's gone. It's only been a couple of days, after all.” Sam sighed again, but more in relief than in exasperation this time. “Maybe once they get the info, they'll go back to being more careful, but we can't say that for sure yet.”
Dean had taught him a lot about lying over the years, and Castiel considered himself quite proficient at it at this point, having even fooled Sam and Dean at points in the past, though he felt guilty about that too.
In the meantime, though, it was once again time to bullshit his way through life. Dean Winchester's special talent. “Yeah, uh, I was trying to decide how much to put on, you know.” He put away his dirty clothes, bending down beside the bed, hoping – praying, maybe – that Cas would be checking him out. When he got back up, Cas was looking at him with a mixture of surprise and amusement.
Okay, he had not expected her of all people to have that reaction. She had died in the Regan era, for God's sake.
Dean sighed contentedly as he wrapped his arm around Castiel. Tentatively, Castiel returned the hug.
“They can wait another day. Let's just... stay here and watch whatever crappy soap opera is on TV right now. I'd even endure Dr. Sexy for you right now.”
Most people ignored them as they came in, some smiled when glancing in their direction, others frowned. Unfortunately, the last group included Sam, who looked to Eileen with an uncertain look on his face, as if he still couldn't quite believe what was going on. Eileen just rolled her eyes.
“No, thank you,” he said, pushing the glass away, but Prince Gabriel filled it anyway. “I still need to work, Gabriel.”
“You haven't heard? I could have sworn Gabriel would tell everyone and their parents about it. In fact, I'm surprised that he didn't blurt it out before the official announcement.” Cas shrugged, then rolled his shoulder as if to alleviate some stiffness.
Hopefully, you'll still like it. I should have the last two chapters ready soon, and I have a couple notes for a possible sequel (because of course my brain can't leave well enough alone, and also I can't just finish my five billion other WIPs, nooo, it's apparently time for something (semi-) new). So. We'll see how it goes.
Mere seconds later, he had found the source of the delicious smell. Around a corner and down a sloped plane, someone was loading pies onto a big wooden table outside a set of plain doors. The pies were still steaming, and from the way the table was surrounded by a stone wall on three sides with no chairs to be seen, Dean thought they must be set there to cool.
“Yeah. Thanks.” That didn't convey his emotions accurately at all, though he guessed that the slightly breathless tone was a give-away. He pulled his mom into a hug, the hand clutching the books resting a little awkwardly against her back. “Thanks.”
They didn't talk about it. It wasn't that Sam didn't talk to him at all, but he was a little awkward around Dean for the rest of the day. Dean hoped that Sam would just need some time to get used to it, and Cas kept squeezing his hand in reassurance, distracting him from the uncertainty.
“It's okay, Dean. You need to sleep.” He leaned back down to kiss his head and landed somewhere around his ear. Even though he still had a better sense of orientation in the world than most humans, especially in the dark, it wasn't what it used to be. With Heaven's power fading, he supposed that giving up his grace might at some point be more of a symbolic gesture, at least if no one did anything about it. He shuddered when he thought of Heaven's gates closing, or, worse, Heaven ceasing to exist. What exactly would happen then, he didn't know – Heaven had existed since before he had been created, a constant in his life as much as the 'mysterious ways' of their Father. But it couldn't be good. All those souls would need to go somewhere, and Earth was the closest dimension, in a sense.
Castiel didn't meet anyone, though he saw a light here and there in some of the bedrooms. He knew very well that some of the apocalypse world hunters barely slept, plagued by nightmares or their restlessness, and he had spent many a night working beside them on research, often trying and failing to take his own mind off Dean.
“Dean?” he asked, after his knocking hadn't been answered. When there was still no reaction, Castiel opened the door just a crack, stuck his head inside the room to check if Dean was there.
Claire grinned. “Yeah, whatever. I guess I am happy for you assholes.” Then she walked off, leaving behind a completely duped Dean and a still smiling Castiel.
“That's right,” Sam said, frowning. “I'm actually surprised you were patient enough to only ask now. Knowing you, I would have thought you'd be crankier.”
Prince Castiel sighed. “I know how sex works, Gabriel,” he said, then turned to Dean and  added a murmured “But thank you.”
“Dean,” Cas said, sounding almost as if he felt the same, as if everything boiled down to those four letters like it did for Dean with Cas' name, like nothing mattered or made sense in that moment except each other.
“Jack said he would put out a plate of cookies and a glass of eggnog. For the being called Claus,” Cas finally said.
“Cas?” he croaked, voice slurred, the sound of a hand patting the bed in search of the warm body that had inhabited it until mere seconds ago.
For a moment, Dean just stood there, too surprised to act. But then he dropped the present on a table and followed after Cas.
“Good morning, everyone.” Prince Gabriel bounced his eyebrows up and down while everyone bowed to him.
Dean considered him for a moment. Had he just called him hot? And had he suggested he become an independent sex worker? “You flatter me. But... Whatever I would make outside, it wouldn't be enough.” Dean bit his lip, thinking about Sam and his stupidly prestigious school. With the stupidly high fees.
Dean stared at him. “The fuck are our lives,” he grumbled, letting his head fall back against the wall.
Dean rolled his eyes to distract from the way his face was heating up. “Yeah yeah. Come on now, I wanna fuck.”
“Decline a prince? I doubt it.” Michael made a dismissive gesture, then hesitated. “But I do understand your... insecurities, believe it or not.”
“Treating me like a normal person. As far as possible, at least.” Castiel sighed, closing his eyes. “Sometimes it really does feel like everyone expects me to be some kind of demi-god, like I can snap my fingers and solve any and all problems, just like that.”
“Hey, if you're done apologizing, these pies won't bring themselves out, so...” They motioned to a couple of plates on a table.
“See? It's perfect. Now, not that this place doesn't spark fond memories, but we really should get going.” Gabriel took a step forwards, but Dean and Cas were still standing in his way.
“Look, there's something you probably don't know, because you didn't know him before, well, before he knew you. But he's always been kind of distant. Some might even say cold. There's few people he's ever smiled at, and I mean really smile, not the fake thing he plasters on his face for guests. It's not like he was emotionless or anything, but his only emotions seemed to be annoyance and anger.”
He hadn't even known he could tense further, but he did. “Uh, Cas- I mean Castiel is my... you know.”
Castiel thought about it for a moment. “To be honest, no. I don't expect you to like it, or to like him. But I would prefer if you do not publicly oppose me on this matter, should it come to pass.”
Cas frowned. “Does it matter? Well, perhaps it does to you. That's my third point, actually. You humans seem to care so much about gender, both in terms of roles and regarding romantic and sexual attraction...”
“And which of my siblings has made that colossal mistake?” she asked, sweeping her eyes up and down his body.
Cas hesitated, looking between the present in his hand and the corridor. “I'm not sure. Hold this.” He pressed the present into Dean's hand and took off. “Stay here,” he said over his shoulder.
“Fuck,” Dean hissed, unable to stop himself from leaning back down to ravage his mouth. Damn this literal angel and his ability to turn even sex into a sap fest. “What- what part of me do you love?”
He was nervous. Oh fuck, was he nervous, almost as much as he had been before their first time together. Which was stupid, because they had already done it a few times now, but then again that had been months ago and maybe Cas had gone along with it more out of curiosity than out of passion, and what if he didn't want it, what if he didn't want Dean anymore, what if the thought of sleeping with the vessel of his brother-
“There was little other choice. We tried the exorcizing-egg, but Michael... he melted it. And we tried Dark Kaia's spear, but-”
Dean stepped in after him, looking around with a carefully neutral expression. “Seriously, Cas, who needs ceilings this high? I'll tell you who: Giants.” He walked over to the bed, sat down, bounced a little and smirked. “At least the bed seems stable.” He got back up quickly, craning his head this way and that, inspecting everything. When he walked into the bathroom, he yelled: “Holy shit!”
“No, we only have family dinner once every two weeks, and that's still another week off. So we're free to do as we please.” Castiel kissed him again, just because he could. “So we can eat here and then I'll show you around.”
Dean smiled softly. “He'd totally geek out about this place. But uh, I guess first I've gotta tell him where I am.”
“That would be most thoughtful of you, your highness.” The butler bowed again and Dean remembered to bow back, then he was alone with the food.
Gabriel reached out and Castiel felt the warmth of his fingers as they hovered over his throat, the slight sting of his wound closing, the rawness of the newly grown skin.
“Uh, yeah. Haven't really left the rooms yet, to be honest, but lunch was so much, I took a nap afterwards and then it was five o'clock and well I tried writing a letter to Sammy, but after about an hour of staring at the paper I- are you alright?”
The doors swung open before Hester had so much as knocked. “Come in, Princess, and bring your brother,” the voice of the High Enchantress called out from further in the rooms.
He saw Michael nod from the corner of his eye. “I take it one of them pleases more than just your body. After all, you spoke of a matter of the heart.” He sighed. “I never imagined having to say this to you of all people, but I really hope you've thought this through.”
It was apple pie, his favourite, and the first bite made him sigh in relief, all tensions melting out of him. This must be the best pie in the world. He loved his new life.
Sam knew what it was like to be possessed by an archangel and it wasn't pretty. And almost seven months of that... He didn't really want to think about it too much.
“Cas,” he breathed out, still clinging tight, unable to voice what he was feeling, the complete overwhelm of emotions pushed aside for so long he was surprised he hadn't burst with them years ago. “Cas.”
“No. He's still in the room, but asleep,” he signed back, a little clumsy with the cookies in his hand.
“You said there might be something you could do for Heaven, even if it wouldn't help much.” Dean felt like he was breaking some silent agreement by talking about it. They hadn't had much time to themselves as it was, what with the bunker full of strangers. Cas also couldn't stay in his room all day and night without people becoming suspicious, even though Dean was starting to think that maybe they should be suspicious. Maybe the others should know about them. Not that he had shared that train of thought with Cas yet.
Cas kneeled in front of the bed, between Dean's legs, putting a hand on his knee. “I'm sorry. We thought it would be better if you... you have a tendency to blame yourself for things that you are not responsible for and-”
They didn't have much time before Sam came back, and someone could have entered the room at any moment, so all they did was hold hands and talk. But for the moment, that was enough.
“I'm sure. But it worries me that your family's survival couldn't be insured with a more... traditional occupation.”
Eventually, Dean wandered out into the courtyard again, throwing a suspicious glance about him as if Hester could be hiding in the shade of a tree or between some of the big-leafed plants, ready to pounce. That was nonsense, of course, but he couldn't shake the feeling of unease as he rounded the garden on the gravelly path that ran on all four sides of it, pebbles crunching under his – apparently not good enough – shoes.
“Yeah, I ate a couple more after you went back to work.” Dean ducked his head, looking at him through his eyelashes and looking utterly adorable.
“But the archangel blade... it only works if an archangel yields it, right? And I don't suppose Michael spiked himself.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “You know what? You can explain the lawn and the guinea pig to each other. I'm going to bed.”
“Hello there, Dean-o,” Gabriel said, smirking and looking like he had just gotten up. Which, considering his habits, he probably had. Dean was even surprised that he was already awake at all. “I hear you'll be part of the family soon.”
“Come on, I'm not gonna break,” Dean teased, even though he didn't really mind the pace. This felt nice, making his body tingle with anticipation.
“The High- holy sh- I mean, yeah. Of course.” Dean nodded, looking dazed. “Uh, where do they reside? Just to know what place to avoid.” His smile was a little crooked.
Apparently, the kiss was all it took for Dean to settle down. “Hm-kay,” he mumbled, sounding content, and soon Castiel could hear – and feel, because they were connected that way, grace to soul, and this was probably the one thing Castiel would miss the most as a human – his breathing even out.
“Don't worry. Just put the pies outside, I'll...” Dean spotted a sink and walked over, then hesitated. “This water is cold, right?”
They managed to track down the werewolves within a few hours, locating their base in a seemingly abandoned warehouse easily. The surrounding warehouses were full of stored meat and fish, so if it stank a little like rotten flesh around there, people would just assume a cooling device had failed. And if someone transported a few hearts, well, some people thought those things were a delicacy, and really, who would be able to tell that they were human hearts?
The next day, Dean told Cas that he had forgotten to pick something up and told him to go ahead with getting the cooled and frozen stuff while he would make a quick run to another shop at the mall. Instead, though, Cas argued that he needed to pick something else up as well, so they both went their separate ways and met in front of the grocery store about half an hour later. When Dean asked what he had gotten, Cas said it wasn't important.
Cas put both his hands on Dean's face and looked him straight in the eyes. “You are Dean Winchester to them. The man who helped lead them out of apocalypse world. Who gave them shelter, and food, and hope for the future. You're also the man who said yes to Michael to challenge Lucifer, keep him from killing your loved ones and, possibly, the world. And you're the man we tried saving for months. You're Dean. Not a vessel. Not a sword. You're the man who saved the world over and over again, who has saved so many lives even an angel would have trouble counting them.”
It wasn't a bad base, really. But at the same time, Dean was surprised at how careless the wolf had been, leaving traces everywhere for any hunter to find, leading them straight to the warehouse. Well, he was less surprised when they were jumped by not one, but three werewolves as soon as they entered the building. They had probably felt secure, had maybe gambled on drawing in hunters to kill them, too. Let the prey come to them.
“Think you're ready?” he whispered against Cas' lips, and the glint in his eyes told him more than any words could have.
Dean was quiet for a moment, trying to get his throat under control, but he still sounded choked when he said: “Love you too, hon.”
“Pity.” Dean was itching to be fucked, but he could wait. Maybe he could do something about it tomorrow, once Cas was gone.
“Some of them cared. Gabriel was around sometimes. Of course he's been notorious with drink and other vices for as long as I can remember. Ana is closest to my age and was a great comfort, but she left for another kingdom for marriage. Happy marriage, as I hear, but it still pains me to know that she is so far away.”
Cas smiled when Dean stepped next to him with his present, leaning in to watch as Dean opened it. At first, Dean tried to be careful, not to damage the paper, but soon there was a tear, and then all bets were off. When the ripped paper fell to the floor to be ignored, Dean stared at the Kurt Vonnegut novels in his hands.
“Sure. But I'd rather be with you.” Dean grinned when Castiel visibly relaxed. He had never been anyone's favourite, let alone a prince's. Hells, he had rarely ever had anyone coming back more than once, seeing as he had mostly catered to visiting nobles so far. “Wine?”
Leaning back against the headrest, Dean took a few deep breaths, already missing Cas' hands on his. “How long?” he asked.
“Right,” Castiel said after a beat, looking gloomy. “There never seems to be an end to work. And then there's all that Gabriel is supposed to do.” He shook his head.
Dean noticed him standing in the distance and gave him a small smile. Castiel clenched his fists and walked away.
“That's not going to happen.” Cas said it like it was the most ridiculous notion he had ever heard. “Now sleep, Dean. I need to get up early tomorrow.”
“Like 'fuck'.” Dean punctuated it with a particularly hard thrust. “Or 'love your cock' or something.”
“Oh. So that's what that's for.” Dean had seen the bell on a drawer, but hadn't thought twice about it. “How does anyone hear that when I ring it in here, though?”
“Mh,” Dean made, letting out a happy sigh when Castiel settled back into bed, his arms immediately full of sleepy hunter.
God, that was an awful way of describing sex, but... “Yeah. Yeah, uh. I wanna try, though. I mean, it's just sex, there's nothing bad about it. And sure, it hurts, but in the good way.” Again, Dean blushed deeply at the admission that being fucked felt good for him.
He was surprised to find the front room mostly empty, only a few people scattered throughout the plush couches in the many alcoves. There was a prince from another kingdom with two employees almost sitting in his lap, and Castiel made a mental note of the faces and physiques of them for future reference. He felt a little guilty about it, but you could never have enough information about people, even your closest allies. Perhaps especially your closest allies.
“And you will. The money will merely come from a slightly different source than it does now.” Castiel kissed him. “Is that your only objection? You mentioned you want to say yes. Will you be my companion, Dean?”
Dean grinned at him. “No promises.” When Castiel frowned, he retracted: “I mean, of course not. Sorry. Uh, sometimes I say things without thinking and, uh...”
Cas glanced at him, looking guilty. “Officially? No. According to the public statements that I had the pleasure of writing up...” He scowled. “He is merely retiring to his vacation home after his prolonged travels through the kingdom.”
“Burgers first, though,” he said as Dean pulled out of the parking lot. “I want a bacon cheese burger. Maybe two.”
About ten minutes into the drive, Cas suddenly said: “You know, if you don't think the set-up is worth it for just one tape, you'll just have to make me another one.”
Sometimes, in moments like this, Dean imagined what it would be like to be somewhere else, to live just with Cas – maybe a house somewhere, close to a beach or at least a lake. Shit, a lake would be nice, he could go fishing there...
“Honestly, I believe that it might please the common folk to know that one of them is among the Royal Family members.”
“I thought he was cold and distant,” Dean said sarcastically, annoyed that Gabriel was talking shit about Cas.
“Sure, shoot. Uh, my prince.” He bowed again, which still looked rather comical with his knees still against his chest, and Castiel couldn't help but smile. “Indecent is pretty much my job description.”
“Well, then you better have a damned good reason to be in the kitchens and to harass my colleague,” they said, crossing their arms in front of their chest. When Dean scratched at his face, their eyes fell onto his wristband and they shifted uncomfortably. “I mean. Your highness.” They bowed, clearly displeased.
Dean put a bookmark on his page and got up from the bed. “So you did chose the books here. I've been wondering.” He walked up to Castiel. “Interesting choices you made.”
She stepped closer, putting the child down so she could yank his arm, inspect the bracelet. Dean held back a yelp as she almost dislocated his shoulder. After a moment, she was apparently satisfied that the bracelet was real, and stepped back, her eyes cold.
“If you think for one second that you can seduce the prince and manipulate him, then you are sorely mistaken, you sorry excuse for the son of a whore!”
to, if you really don't wanna.” Dean gave him his best puppy eyes. He was nowhere near as good as Sam or Jack, of course, but it seemed to do the trick.
Dean bolted out of the shower as soon as he had rinsed off all the shampoo and showering gel, then scrubbed himself dry with a towel. There was no point in getting himself worked up over this when it might be nothing. Cas wasn't like that, he told himself, and if anything he was even more affectionate towards Dean than before the possession. They had even talked about retiring together, about spending basically the rest of their lives together, and here he was, getting upset over Cas maybe not wanting to touch him when he had been touching him so often in the last few days. Not like during sex, but still. He didn't seem repulsed by Dean, didn't seem like he minded that up until a few days ago, Dean's body had been moving against his own will, had been made to do things he never wanted, to kill and torture and-
“My my. Such hot tempers in this mild climate.” The High Enchantress smirked. “Now, my prince. You must have known that this would happen. Did you do it on purpose?”
“Oh,” Dean said when he saw her raised hand, that was shivering slightly, soap water dripping onto the floor. Then he whirled around to point an accusing finger at Sam. “The hell you been teaching these kids?”
“Can't you delegate it?” Dean was starting to think that everyone was just dumping their work on Castiel. What the hells.
“People have tea parties here? What, like in the picture books?” Dean blushed a little at having revealed his own ignorance.
It took some time to take off all of Cas' clothes, because he was still wearing everything, including his trench coat and his shoes, but eventually, it all landed in a messy pile next to the bed, with Dean's jeans following suit not long after. By then, they were both half hard from touching and rutting against each other, and when both their cocks were finally free and sliding together, Dean let himself moan loudly, without restraint.
“Cool. Christmas saved.” The guy gave Cas a quick smile, then went over to the tree to hang up some more glitter balls.
“Wow, I can't believe you fell asleep before midnight.” Sam was standing behind the couch, leaning on it with his arms. “You're getting old.”
“Alas, then I fear that on top of being a snob, I am also a hypocrite.” Castiel turned back to his notes, drew up a sheet with price comparisons, wrote down a peculiarity he had noticed. His head had still been running through the numbers, even when talking with Dean.
The first thing Dean noticed was the light, bright even through his closed eyelids. The second thing he noticed was that he wasn't in his bed, instead wedged sideways on the couch. Great. Not that he hadn't slept in worse places or positions before, and a bit of stretching would probably alleviate any stiffness. But his neck cracked when he moved it and he let out a groan, allowing himself to wallow in his uneasiness for a moment.
Dean laughed. Or maybe it was more a bark. “'We', huh? You and Sam? Or is everyone else in on this, too, Jack, mom, the other hunters... They are, aren't they? Couldn't let them talk about it by accident, spoil the surprise. What the hell did you think would happen, I'd just never face a monster again, would never find out about what Michael did?”
Castiel looked at him, searching for any sign of uneasiness or disappointment, but finding none. “You're not angry?” he asked.
“Of course.” Castiel looked down at the papers with a pang of guilt, knowing that every word in it was a lie, another story woven to placate their people. He knew that it was necessary, but that didn't mean that he had to like it. “May I speak to you on another matter?”
Or soft and sweet, like right now. “Perfect,” he groaned, because Cas with sweat glistening on his body, his hair damp and clinging to his head in messy strands, and smiling up at him? Yeah, that was very much perfect.
Dean wondered if Prince Castiel and Gabriel had such different job descriptions, or if it was just that Prince Castiel actually took his job seriously. Possibly both.
“Castiel,” they said, transporting down from the structure to stand in front of them. “And your... human friend.”
“Yes, please.” Prince Castiel took the crystal glass from him, their fingers touching briefly. That shouldn't have sent a pleasant shiver down Dean's spine, and yet it did.
“No,” Cas told him quickly, and he pressed a kiss into his hair. “No, but Dean... There is little love lost between my siblings and me and I told you that I am tired of feeling responsible for Heaven or fixing it. And if I am to live under humans, I would rather do it as one of them. As one of you.”
What was he doing? What was Cas doing? Was this even real, or some kind of fever dream? Had he died and gone to one of the Heavens? He pinched himself, and it hurt, then pinched himself again for good measure. No effect. He was still staring down at his measly belongings that were apparently destined to be brought to some rooms in the palace.
Dean smiled as the kid babbled about Santa, said good morning to the others, took the teasing from Sam about getting up late. Fortunately, he wasn't the last one, and even more fortunately, Jack had apparently worked with Maggie to make breakfast for everyone, so while they waited, Dean wolfed down a PB&J. Cas rolled his eyes and told him to eat slower so he wouldn't die on them on Christmas morning from choking on a sandwich, but he was smiling and Dean couldn't help but smile back, hiding it by taking an even larger bite.
“I suppose. And yet, we are usually surrounded by other people and are required to hold up appearances.” Castiel sighed. “This must seem ridiculous to you. A Prince complaining about having to be a Prince.”
Lady Margaret barely looked at Jacky, but her eyes roamed Jerry and her smirk became even more predatory. After a moment, she glanced at Dean and said: “You can leave now.”
“It's called an ass, Cas.” Dean rolled his eyes. “All this time, and you still haven't learned how to do dirty talk.”
“Dean?” he asked again, and Dean glanced at him, only to look away again a second later, his lips a thin line. “Are you alright?”
“Ah, yes.” Castiel hesitated. “It does appear unfair that only you 'spilled your secrets', as it were.” He made air quotes again. What a dork. But he also laid back down, on his back this time, and Dean counted that as a win.
“What he said. That it was m...” Dean looked at the hand on his shoulder, striped with blood, much like his own hands had been when... “Michael. He did this, didn't he? Made them immune to silver, made them stronger.”
Alright. There's a brief sex scene in here, but it's really just... two sentences or whatever. The rest is them being disgustingly sweet on each other. As it should be.
“My apologies. I just didn't immediately recognize you as... nobility,” they said, their eyes flicking up and down Dean's body, or maybe his clothes.
“Dude, I can't believe you actually kissed Cas.” Sam huffed, looking more amused than anything when Dean came over to him and Mary. “You know you could have gotten away with a kiss on the cheek, right?”
It was weird, but not uncomfortable. Usually, physical contact wasn't something that Castiel initiated, at least not with anyone but his closest family. And even then, the hugs were brief. But he had realized lately that he was feeling rather lonely, and actually missing human contact for the first time in his life.
“Your – you – your soul. So bright,” Cas started babbling, and Dean knew he wouldn't be able to stop himself if he was already talking souls. “Your eyes. Your strength. You – when you blush. Your – your stupid movie references...”
“Oh, you like that, don't you?” Prince Gabriel was raising an eyebrow at Dean. “You like seeing your Prince being degraded. Mmmh, I like my men like that.” He had a wolfish grin on his face.
Oh,” Cas made, as if he hadn't even considered that he might get anything for Christmas. After looking between Dean and the tree uncertainly a few times, he made his way over, gingerly picked up a present wrapped in pink paper with kittens printed on it. Dean knew that it was Claire's present, possibly an effort to embarrass Cas, possibly a reference to that butt ugly plushy Cas had once gotten for her birthday. In any case, Cas smiled at it.
Huh. Another thing that Sam wasn't quite ready to let himself contemplate yet. Maybe he, too, should just settle on being relieved that Dean was back. Everything else would sort itself out over time, or come back to bite them in the ass. But there would still be time to deal with that, then.
The person arranging the pies ducked through the doors, only to come back out with several more plates full of baked goodness a few moments later, depositing them next to the others. When Dean came closer, the person looked up briefly, but then continued with their work, going back through the doors.
“Don't bother,” Castiel growled, planting himself on the edge of the couch opposite Gabriel. “He's otherwise occupied.”
“Yeah, well. I hope you'll feel connected to me when we get burgers.” Dean grinned as they both got into the car. “I know a place that should still be open. There's also this waffle place, but they're probably closed right now. We should go there some time, though.”
She stared at him a moment longer, then turned around on her heel, collecting her child which had darted off to taste some leaves. She laughed once as she walked off, a high-pitched, unnerving sound, then disappeared through a door without saying goodbye.
There was a rip in the library. A goddamn, honest to God dimensional tear like the one they had used to travel to apocalypse world and back. Dean tried to tell himself that it didn't necessarily mean anything bad, that this might be a visit from a friendly neighbourhood dimension, some sort of relaxed crossover event.
There was a dirty joke somewhere in the back of Dean's mind, but he ignored it. “Sure. Why wouldn't I?”
“Atta boy. I knew I could count on the Winchesters and my rebellious little bro to gank an overpowered baddie.”
But there he was. He plastered a smile on his face as he left the bathroom. “Hey. Sorry it took so long.”
Cas' hand settled between Dean's shoulder blades, and he immediately felt better. Whether Cas had used his grace, or if it was just the comfort of the touch, Dean didn't actually care.
“The werewolves we took down seemed to know it though,” Dean remembered. “At least one of the wolves seemed to know who I am. Or... who I was. And he knew I wasn't him anymore.”
“I have faith in free will because of you. And in humanity.” Cas scooted closer to him again. “You know, Metatron once told me that I was in love with humanity. But I think he got his facts a little confused. I'm in love with you, and you made me care for humanity, for the whole world.”
Cas sighed, looking at the floor, but eventually he seemed to decide that there was no point hiding it: “She was tortured at that camp we rescued her from. And her torturer was their world's version of me.”
Cas shuffled closer, leaning against him. He was still sensitive to the cold and didn't own winter clothing yet, hence the blanket over Dean's hand-me-downs. But he had adjusted to being human surprisingly quickly, even if he sometimes fell asleep at odd times and forgot to eat.
Maybe they could go on a hunt together. Jack had been hunting with Cas, and lately also with other hunters. Now that he had his powers back, he didn't need an assurance policy in the form of another angel anymore. He
Blinking against the sudden brightness, he saw Cas squinting up at him, apparently not bothered by the change in lighting.
“Would you decline a client, though? I have found that most of the palace employees do not actually speak up when they are mistreated for fear of losing their work.” The Prince seemed genuinely troubled.
“Dude, we're gonna pick up a shit ton of stuff. And probably a tree, too,” Dean told him, glancing at the people who were talking vividly about their plans for Christmas. Their first Christmas without Michael. “And I am not getting needles all over Baby. Or scratches on her roof.”
Dean blinked at him, glanced behind himself to make sure there wasn't anyone else in the room he could have meant. “Uh. Me?”
“Well, some people only just got up, so for them, it's morning,” Gabriel replied, waving his hand dismissively.
Then there had been the apocalypse world, and Michael, and Dean had been gone for months, being used like a puppet in Michael's plans, feeling like he was drowning the entire time. So the only thing Dean could do once he was back was to hold onto Cas again, and when night fell, they locked the door and lay down together, both dressed in nothing but their boxers.
Suddenly, Jack sniffed, and hugged him tighter, almost as hard as Sam had, and Dean had to brace himself against the headrest so they didn't fall over.
Dean's heart skipped a beat, and he had to tell himself that this probably didn't mean what he thought it meant. Back in the city, watching the fireworks together with someone outside your family usually meant you wanted a relationship with them, but Cas probably didn't know that. And he was a prince. Gods, he would probably laugh in Dean's face for such a silly notion.
He got about halfway with pulling the bottle out of the bag before Dean frantically pushed it back in, his face burning. “Don't take that out here,” he hissed, glancing around to check if anyone had seen. But no one paid any attention to them.
“I believe Eileen is currently taking care of that,” Castiel told him, stroking his fingers through Dean's hair. “So you're not... it's not the gift?”
to know and I-” Dean took a deep breath. “Look, I don't regret it, okay? I'm just really... overwhelmed, I guess, and I don't want Sam to look at me differently or...” He broke off, looking troubled.
Cas looked at him thoughtfully before realization dawned on his face. “Ah, I see. You do not wish to let any of the surrounding people deduce that we engage in sexual inter-”
For now though, he was busy with massaging all that muscle. The oil he used smelled musky and yet a little sweet, making him a little dizzy like always. And all the toned skin he was touching didn't help in the matter. He was kneeling over the Prince's waist, his legs brushing the Prince's sides every now and then. He was careful not to lower himself accidentally, afraid that Prince Castiel might not like to be touched more than ordered, especially by Dean's groin.
“Who said anything about staying? We just want- well. Okay, first things first. Michael?” Gabriel asked.
“They know. They know now and I-” One of Dean's hands came up to the back of Castiel's head, as if he was holding on for balance, as if fearing he might crumble otherwise. “I don't know how to deal with that. I've never told anyone. Fuck, I didn't even tell them today, they just- I- I don't know if Sam understood-”
“It's just...” Jack frowned, and for a moment Castiel feared that he was reacting badly, after all. But then he said, tilting his head: “Everyone is reacting like you two kissing is a new thing. Is it?”
“Of course. When we connected... my memory of the time in my mother's womb is a little hazy, probably because I wasn't fully developed yet. But I clearly remember your feelings about Dean. I didn't understand it at the time, of course. I'm not sure if I fully understand it now, since I've never been in love myself...”
“Well, it's not her choice.” Cas had gotten loud, and his eyes widened when he saw the frown on Dean's face. “Apologies, I didn't mean to yell at you.”
“I just had the strangest, and yet most entertaining encounter.” She laughed in her mocking way, making it clear that she was in no way happy about it. “There was a boy, a young man I suppose, in the courtyard. Pretty face, I admit, but his clothes – he looked like he came straight from the Harem!” She wrinkled her nose. “Anyway, guess what. He claimed to be your companion. Hah!” She smiled smugly at him.
The guy turned around, still fire in his eyes. “Castiel. I see the rumours are true. Never would I have taken you for a man who lays with such a harlot.”
“What do you mean?” Why did Cas think he couldn't have Dean? Why would he even want Dean beyond what they were already doing?
Cas was moving his mouth, probably saying his name, but all Dean could hear were his own thoughts, screaming at him, images so close to breaking through the surface that it was almost painful, and he could feel himself starting to drown again...
The next time Gabriel spoke, he was signing at the same time as well. “Listen, we don't want any trouble, as weird as that sounds coming from me. These people here – these angels – are sick and tired of the apocalypse. They don't want to fight humanity anymore, or they never wanted to begin with, but had to follow Michael's orders. You know what it's like to follow orders, don't you?” He looked at Cas, but Dean also felt a pang of sympathy.
“I'm late. Damn it, I shouldn't have-” He looked at Dean guiltily while pulling his arms into his robe. He shouldn't have come on a Friday night, should have waited for a Saturday, but there was a small party that evening and he had wanted desperately to see Dean still this week. “Forgive me, but I must make haste.”
And an angel, who was currently holding two cups of coffee and scanning the room for the best available seats. When their eyes met, Dean motioned with his head towards a table at the window front, and they took off in that direction, with Dean getting there first and claiming his preferred seat: With his back to the wall, and the whole room in his sight, including the breakfast buffet and the TV above it, which was set to a local news channel. It was muted, but the headlines were scrolling through at the bottom, even though it took some effort to read them from this distance.
After getting the rest of the groceries, they picked up a tree, then strapped it to the roof of the car, because it was just a little too tall to fit all the way into the car without turning down one of the front seats. And even then, it would have been a close call. While Cas seemed to worry most about the paint job on his car and eventually pulled out a mat to put under the tree, Dean's biggest concern was to get it fastened to the roof so it wouldn't fall off and crash some poor bastard's wind shield (and/or head).
He hadn't had time to visit Dean for two weeks, and it was probably obvious to everyone who knew him even a little. His whole body was tense, his back hurting, though that may be because he had fallen asleep at his desk a couple of times. And yet, after all this work, after the meticulous planning and the shouting matches with Crowley, he was still not free. Today was the worst part, actually. After everything, now he was expected to socialize.
“I was going to say you were being awfully cocky, but you'd just go ahead and make a bad pun about that, too.”
Dean nodded, averting his eyes. A few of the other employees had taken to teaching him embroidery. With little to do in the Harem, especially in the long hours of the winter, Dean had eventually relented. He wasn't even half bad at it, though his father would have turned in his grave had he known what Dean was doing. Then again, the same was true for working in the Harem.
Castiel chuckled, but before he could say anything, there was a knock on the door and then Jack stepped into the room.
“Cas, come on. If you really don't wanna do this, just tell me.” Dean gestured between them helplessly.
Then a thought hit him. “Wait, is this our first date?” He didn't usually take people to eat burgers on a first date, though admittedly he hadn't actually had a date since... well, since Lisa, though before that it had been a long time too. Possibly since high school.
“I don't know.” Cas sighed. “Maybe we were foolish enough to believe we could keep it from you until we had killed all of Michael's creatures. But there's so many of them... Well, not that we actually know how many there are, no one knows, probably, with Michael dead. Might be a few dozen, might be hundreds. We might never know. And you're right, we should have told you. I was still hoping these would just be regular werewolves, or I would have told you. I should have told you.”
“It is about a matter of... well, the heart.” He frowned down at the papers, not sure what he would find on his brother's face.
Cas kissed his knee cap – the sap – but eventually his finger found home, sliding slowly into Dean. At first it was weird, an intrusion more than anything, and Dean probably would have tensed if Cas hadn't continued to cover him in kisses, even placing an open-mouthed one on his cock, making him gasp. And then Cas' finger was all the way in, moving in him gently but with determination, and Dean remembered why he liked this. It didn't take long before Cas found the right angle, brushing against that sweet spot and yeah, he
Dean's stomach dropped at seeing it. He was hot in his anger, but was he angry at Dean? What had he done?
“The archangel blade,” Cas explained, and when Dean looked down at himself, he added: “I healed the wound. It took... two healing sessions, because I used a lot of my grace in the battle against Michael, so all I could do at first was to keep you from bleeding out. But now it's all healed up.”
Meg laughed. “Yeah, and when you didn't show up at five to, I was starting to get worried.” The grin on her face was almost predatory.
“Ah.” Dean nodded as if he completely understood how magic worked and how that might be possible. “Cool. Thanks.” He ducked back into his rooms.
Dean felt Cas' smile against his chest, but his voice was still sad. “I would like you to be my companion, Dean.”
Castiel looked him over. “How old is he? If he is your 'baby brother'...” The Prince made air quotes. Actual freaking air quotes. Dean laughed.
Dean turned, his stomach clenching. He would be found out for an imposter, an unworthy and unwanted visitor, and he would be removed from the premises forcefully, never seeing Cas again...
“Cas?” Dean whispered, the sound of the safety of a gun being disengaged. At least nowadays he asked before aiming, Castiel thought with a pang, remembering the time Dean had shot first to ask questions later. Of course that hadn't hurt him, being an angel, but it was good to know that he wouldn't have to fear for his life once he was human every time he walked in on his sleeping boyfriend.
“We both know it is hardly a surprise to find me here.” Gabriel waved his hand dismissively. “As I can see, you have already acquainted yourself with one of our fine employees. I figured you had an exquisite taste.”
“Uh, yeah. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to cause trouble.” Dean grinned crookedly. “I just smelled the best thing ever and saw the pies outside, and I wondered if I could maybe have one?”
“Your bag will be taken to your rooms. Come, I don't have much time before my next meeting, but I can show you around a bit.” Cas grabbed his hand and led him out of the Harem, into the palace proper.
This time, Dean was almost sure that Cas was just teasing him, because when he sputtered something about his back, and claimed that he couldn't sleep in the car, the corners of Cas' mouth curled up into what looked suspiciously like a grin before he said: “I understand. Those are of course grievous concerns and I apologize for ever doubting your reasoning.”
“And by 'some people' you mean yourself.” The person huffed, crossing their arms in front of their chest. They weren't bad looking, despite the frown on their face. Tall, dark hair that stuck out in every which direction, even features, some scruff. Nice body, too, from what Dean could tell through their robe, which was a midnight blue and adorned similarly to what Gabriel wore.
“You're lucky I don't actually need to breathe.” Cas sighed. “You know I could just easily throw you off, right?”
He didn't need to say anything more, which was just as well, because there was a sudden lump in his throat.
“Don't call me that,” Sam grumbled, and Dean saw some guys behind him grin. That must have been the first time they had heard their Chief called that.
MacLeod regarded her over the rim of her cup. “Would you be terribly disappointed if I told you that I'm not omniscient?”
The first thing Dean realized when he came to was that he wasn't drowning anymore. His second realization was that it was dark, and that there was pressure against his right hand. But it wasn't a bad pressure, it was warm and familiar, so Dean propped one eye open experimentally, then the second one when he recognized his surroundings. He was in the bunker, in his room, lying in his bed with Cas sitting by his side on a chair. Or rather slouching. Cas' eyes were closed, and his head hung, resting against both his hands where they were clutching Dean's right hand. It almost looked as if he were praying.
Dean's heart missed a beat or two as he struggled to understand what Cas was saying. He hadn't seen anyone who looked like him over there. Though maybe he had been wearing a different vessel. “You... Are you sure?”
“Yes, yes, I'm here.” She stepped out of another chamber, holding a cup full of steaming liquid. Whether it was some kind of potion or a simple tea, Castiel wouldn't dare to guess. “Sit down, sit down, we don't have all day. I have a visitor in twenty minutes.”
Ezekiel nodded. “We have heard much about our counterparts. It is a shame so many of them were slain, though perhaps for us it a small blessing.” He frowned, perhaps unhappy with the way he had phrased that. “It seems to be a little awkward for the two Hesters.”
“Well, that's a surprise. Didn't think you had such a low self-esteem.” Gabriel hummed. “I think he sees a man who is honest to himself and others, which I can assure you is a refreshing change of pace from the palace. And I think you inspire him to be a little more honest, too, even if it's just in little ways.” Gabriel smirked. “He also probably sees you as a hot piece of ass.”
Castiel hummed. “She might have been trying to tease us. Perhaps she has noticed my feelings for you and aimed to embarrass me.”
No effect on an angel, no. But if he had already given up his grace, if he was already human, already retired... Dean barely noticed how Cas led him out of the warehouse, or drove him back to the motel.
“Yeah,” he called out immediately, swinging his legs off the couch and adjusting his robe. When nothing happened, he added: “Come in.”
Kind of a convoluted way of saying 'too much information', but Dean could certainly relate with the sentiment.
For a moment, they didn't speak, both of them just watching their family and friends set up rockets and tease each other in the field they had stopped by. They had even gotten Garth and his family for the occasion, little Gertie jumping around in the grass more than helping with the fireworks, and Dean was suddenly hit by the weird realisation that not only did they celebrate New Year's now, they also celebrated it with a bunch of werewolves, his revived mother, his ex-angel boyfriend, their half-angel son and the bunch of misfits who had somehow also managed to worm their way into their little family.
“You want to move up in the world?” The Prince's face said 'through this'? It annoyed Dean even more, reminding him of his father.
“Oh?” The High Enchantress leaned back in her upholstered chair, once again an amused smile on her lips. “Do you now?”
“Stories of my demise are vastly exaggerated.” Gabriel waved them off. “Trickster, remember? You don't think I have a few tricks up my sleeve? Oh, and these people are-”
“Well, then I will address any and all complaints about why the pies are missing from everyone's tea parties to you.”
He expected a rebuttal again, but Prince Castiel actually nodded. “Thank you,” he said when Dean handed him on of the crystal glasses he kept for high-born company.
“Yeah. Like. From hunting. From the life, you know. Get off the road, find a place to settle down. I hear California is nice. We could... go to the beach, drink cocktails all day, just you and me... uh, maybe Sam and Eileen too, or mom or Jack, if they wanna.” Dean bit his lip, fearing he wouldn't stop talking otherwise.
“I'm not sure if he requires any porn, considering the frequency of Eileen's visits to his room.” Dean almost dropped the tie at Cas' words.
“Yeah, well. Guess I'm getting old.” He stretched, hearing something crack in his back, and he scowled at himself. On the one hand, he had never expected to even get this old. Thirty-nine, forty in a month, that was an age most hunters never saw. Of course there were the exceptions: his dad, Bobby, Rufus... But most hunters, especially if they started young, didn't live to see forty. That was just simple maths – the more hunts you did, the higher the probability that one of them went sideways.
“You're gonna have to take those issues up with the Chief.” Dean leaned down to kiss him, softly this time. “Man, I can't believe all I'll ever be to those guys is the Chief's brother. Well, and, uh, Michael's vessel, I guess.” Great. He had made himself feel crappy all over again.
“Then I'm sure he'd be embarrassed, and he'd tell you how to avoid that the next time around.” Gabriel said it like it was the most boring question in the world.
“Oh, I dunno. Maybe you could tell Cassie here all about the pleasures of the flesh.” Prince Gabriel was grinning mischievously.
Sometimes, before Michael, Cas had fucked him fast and hard, rough and dirty like their years on the road and the sheets in all those dingy motels, as if to let out all the frustration and desperation that had build up over the almost-decade of them dancing around each other. But other times, like today, he was just so
Now Dean loved burgers and pie and all that stuff, but if he actually settled down, stopped running around and digging up graves, he might have to actually watch his weight for the first time. And, yeah, start living healthily. Because otherwise, his time with Cas might be pretty short, after all.
Dean shook his head, laughing a little. “Yeah, well, maybe Hallmark movies ain't the standard we should aspire to, but... sure. God is a bitch, but that doesn't mean we can't get drunk on eggnog and spice up the place.”
“Uh, yeah.” Seeing Cas again came unexpected, to say the least. He wasn't sure how to act for a moment, then remembered that he was still a Harem employee, and put on his best honey voice. “Of course. Forgive me, I had a light headache and so the others saw fit to send me to my room.” Actually, he had been in a terribly bad mood, and the others had basically dragged him to his room to make sure he didn't piss of any of the visitors.
Castiel sat back on the couch, all too aware of the two employees who had stayed behind with him. This was ridiculous.
Castiel smiled. “Maybe.” Then he leaned in, but stopped before their lips touched. “Can I kiss you?”
Okay. So. I know it's been two months. And I don't really have much to say in my defense except that life's a piece of shit (okay, more like depression is a bitch, but, ya know).
“Uh, yeah. At least that's the one I know. Not being attracted to anyone sexually usually means you're asexual. But don't ask me for the details, 'cause I don't have them. Maybe, uh, ask someone who knows about this stuff? I don't know how old or recent the word is, so the library might not help you.”
Dean stared at him, dumbfounded that he thought that Dean could be the one to hurt Cas' feelings instead of the other way around. “Okay.”
“Uncle.” Cas' voice was hard. “These people provide a service. Now, if you do not wish to use these services, I would advise you to leave.”
Once Thomas had made his way over to the table to get his other stuff, Sam said: “Well, that was thoughtful of you.”
“A better place,” Prince Castiel grumbled, shaking his head. “You know I hate that nickname and you use it purely to taunt me.”
“Hey, Jody,” Dean said, hugging back. Even if she had kind of ruined the moment, he was still really glad to see her.
Oh look, more characters. And sexy times (pretty short again - it's kind of in the middle of the second to last part and there's something pretty significant afterwards, so look out for that).
“That sounds... very nice, actually. But Dean, you don't have to do this for me. I know this life means everything to you, and-”
Dean let himself fall onto the bed – his bed, holy shit – and stared up at the canopy above it. Because there was a gods damned canopy above his bed now. What even was his life.
“No. It takes more than a distorted tradition like this to be considered a worshipper. And unless we perform some intricate ritual or sacrifice, there is no reason any deity should take interest in us,” Cas told him.
“Right. So, uh.” Jody threw another glance at Cas, then got up from where she had been sitting on the bed. “I'm gonna go tell the others that you're awake. Don't move.”
“At the risk of sounding like Sam,” Cas said, studying the contents of Dean's plate, “shouldn't you add a few more vegetables to your diet? Or some fruit, at least?”
Someone whistled, just as they broke apart, and Castiel saw Rowena and Charlie grinning, whispering to each other. In a slight panic, Castiel sought Jack's eyes, but the boy was just smiling the same as ever, and almost immediately went back to his conversation with Alex and Patience.
Cas did end up eating two burgers, though only because Dean let him steal his. He wasn't actually hungry anyway, definitely not as much as his freshly human boyfriend, and he figured he could pay him back for all the times he had stolen fries off Cas' plate, even if Cas hadn't needed to eat at the time.
“That's the spirit!” Gabriel said jovially, already refilling his own glass. The bottle ended up empty, and Sara got up to fetch a new one. Or rather, a couple, because they all knew Gabriel's drinking habits.
Then there was another knock on the door, and Dean opened it to find the same butler from before, once again looking stoic. “Your food, your highness.” They bowed and started to push the little cart they had into the room, but Dean took over from them.
Castiel smiled, remembering the little time he had spent with the Winchesters as a human and how Dean still had apparently memorized what he had liked back then.
“Dude needs to sleep, not to work even more.” Dean turned to take off Cas' trench coat, suit jacket and tie and motioned for him to get out of his shoes. “If he'd be using this thing for porn, that would be another matter, but you know him. Regular boyscout.”
It took Dean a while to fall back asleep, but when he did, Cas' hand was still gently rubbing his back.
Castiel passed the blade and the vial to Dean, who searched his eyes for confirmation. Nodding, Castiel turned his face up, leaving his throat open.
“Right now, the added bonus would be that I could give my grace to the remaining angels. Perhaps there is a way to get it to power Heaven directly. I'm not sure how exactly the machinations work, but perhaps it would help. Even if it's just a bit... at least it might help buy some time until we... until someone finds another solution.”
“Princess, I've checked him thoroughly. Twice.” MacLeod pursed her lips. “If that is not sufficient for you, may I suggest finding another sorcerer who will provide you with more fanfare and smoke and mirrors to make you believe they're doing something more complicated and glamorous than they actually are.”
When he downed his glass of wine in one go, one of the employees lifted the wine bottle, a questioning look on their face.
Dean raised an eyebrow at him. In the couple of months he had been here, Gabriel had never slept with him, though he had been pretty much sleeping his way through the Harem, never minding the gender of his partner. Dean wondered if tonight would be the night. He wasn't exactly looking forward to it, though he was kind of curious. The others made Gabriel sound like a decent lover, and Dean had never fucked a Prince before.
“A couple of months.” He had started in the fall, back when they could still sit in the yard. It had been a bit easier to stave off his boredom then. He had already felt a bit cooped up, but definitely not as much as now.
“Does that mean you're... what's the word. Asexual?” Dean said it like it wasn't a big deal, but Castiel's heart almost stopped.
Dean had had nightmares before. Since Michael, he had them almost every night, a mixture of memories and his gruesome imagination that provided more blood, more fire, more pain. The two nights before they had left for the shopping, they had been particularly bad, probably because Cas hadn't been there to wake him, to whisper assurances in his ear, to hold him. Not that he would tell him that. In those nights, Cas hadn't been able to get away from Jack, who often stayed up late because he didn't need much sleep, or from whoever else who had hogged his attention. Dean had eventually retired to his room, had waited for a bit, then had locked the door. It would have been too suspicious if he only locked it whenever Cas was there, so he locked it every night, and it was honestly a relief to know that none of the strangers roaming the bunker could come in at any time. But it also meant that Cas couldn't come in.
The whole room could probably see Castiel's feelings on his face, but he couldn't have cared less. Dean had kissed him. In front of everyone. This wasn't just a good day anymore, but a great day. An amazing day. The best day of the year, in fact – bar the one on which they had gotten Dean back and it had been clear that he would survive. And the moment Dean had woken back up. And – okay, maybe there had been a lot of great days these past few weeks. The point still stood.
“And you've been watching over me the whole time?” A few years ago, the same words might have carried anger or reproachfulness. But now, Dean could only feel a flutter in his stomach, and a slight blush on his face at the thought.
“Sam has been taller than you for years,” he dead-panned, making Sam and Mary laugh while Dean turned to scowl at him. Though by the time he turned back to his plate, Dean was smiling, too. Huh. Sam had expected him to give Cas far more shit for that comment. But maybe he was too tired, or too glad to finally be back.
Benny seemed amused, but didn't comment on it. Instead, he glanced back at the dough behind him. “I'm afraid I will have to get back to baking, or some of the Royal Family really won't be having any pie today.”
Dean was pretty sure that he was the inappropriate thing in this sentence, and a heat burst through his intestines that had nothing to do with breakfast. But he didn't comment, choosing to put on his best customer smile. “I dare not question a prince's choices, my princess.”
“You know what I love?” Dean asked, managing to only blush slightly, “When you smile.” Because he really did. As much as he loved all those faces he pulled, the best were always his smiles. Big, wide, gums showing, the corners of his eyes crinkling.
Castiel put a hand on his arm, the first time he had deliberately touched him. “You're going to make yourself bleed.”
Eventually, the last stragglers made it, and it was time to open Christmas presents. Everything was already under the tree, all the presents marked with big name tags so there wouldn't be any confusion with this many people, and grouped so everyone would find theirs quickly. Dean was almost sure the last bit was Sam's work, though maybe people had just naturally put down their presents next to ones with the same name on it.
“I believe they're called 'pop vinyl'.” Cas took the one that looked like Dean out of the box, smiling like the sap he was. “Apparently they make them for characters from popular shows and books. And the Carver Edlund novels seem to be just popular enough.”
But he had been wondering about this Heaven stuff for days now and he thought that if he knew the plan, he could either keep Cas from doing it or at least help him. Anything was better than have Cas go off on his own, like he usually did when he was on a 'mission'.
Jack nodded, slowly. “It took me some time to understand that, too. I didn't know why you were so sad and angry all the time, thought it was just that you hated me...” He shifted on the bed. “But when Cas came back and you were so happy... I started understand.”
“If this is a dream, can you just give me a sign? I don't know, turn into a fly or breathe fire or something?” Dean pleaded – fucking pleaded – with Gabriel.
“Eight years?” Dean gaped at him. “Wait, that means Gabr- I mean Prince Gabriel is thirty-four?” He had thought that they weren't that far apart in age, but Gabriel was ten years older than him. Holy shit.
“Good,” Dean replied around a mouthful of toast, and Sam scoffed at his lack of manners, but if Dean heard him, he didn't show it. Instead, he chewed and swallowed, then added: “'m great. I have no idea who most of the people are running around in the bunker, but...” He shrugged and shoved a forkful of eggs into his mouth.
Cold spread through Castiel's insides. Of course Dean was in his room, who in their right mind would not want to take him to his room. He was with a customer, Castiel was too late, he wouldn't get to see Dean at all tonight and who knew what the customer was doing with him right now...
Castiel didn't appreciate being called a boy, but considering the High Enchantress had already known him as an adolescent, he could forgive her the slight. Begrudgingly, he sat down and gave her his hands. Her fingertips were warm, probably from the concoction in her cup, and yet he felt a slight shiver run through him at the touch. Possibly her magic, he surmised. The High Enchantress closed her eyes.
“There is a lot of important work to be done.” Cas stepped up to him slowly, as if wanting to give him a chance to withdraw. Gently, he took Dean's hands in his. “But you are also important. What did Hester say to you? Was she terribly unkind?”
In Dean's absence, Mary had sometimes talked to Castiel about his childhood, on those nights were she was one of those plagued by insomnia. They had been tales of a happy child, who had loved hugging people and could rattle on about the stones and flowers he had found outside for hours. Jack didn't talk about those kinds of things, but Castiel thought it was similar to how he could go on about a show he had watched, or even whatever lore he had discovered or learned from Sam.
Another one of the books was about geometry, which Dean remembered from maths class. He hadn't gotten far on the subject before he'd dropped out, so he took some time reading the book, but got bored after a few pages. Being able to calculate all manner of things was definitely useful for something, but Dean didn't really see a career as an architect or a bridge construction worker in his future, so he put the book back, wondering if Cas had put them all there deliberately. He didn't seem to let many things to chance, but it was difficult to imagine that he had found the time to decorate Dean's room next to his regular work, and in the span of a couple hours.
“Surely, there are other ways to... Apologies. But I'm sure that with your looks you would have no problem working... you know, in the city.”
It might be different with Cas, of course. He wouldn't have to hide any of his suspicions. Cas knew as well as him that a monster might live just next door or break into the house at any minute, and chances were that he would keep his angel blade at the ready, even as a human. Cas was a warrior. He'd been a soldier. He would understand.
Sam let out a sound between a scoff and a laugh, probably wondering what a proper Christmas was even like, considering they had never really had one. But before he could say so, Dean said: “Yeah, a proper Christmas would be nice, wouldn't it, Sammy?”
“You could say that.” Castiel snorted. “I barely ever saw him as a child. All I knew was that he was constantly having meetings, and that a lot of my siblings were invited, but I was too young. I think that's part of why I worked so hard, trying to get into those meetings. Of course nowadays I'm part of them, but he is...”
Despite himself, Dean laughed. “Yeah, no. No deals, and no one's in danger. At least not any more than usual. Uh... You know how we, like, had sex in the motel...”
That seemed to calm Sam a bit, though he still looked doubtful about Dean's intentions. If he was honest, Dean wasn't entirely sure about his own intentions, either, at least not until he heard himself say: “It's gonna be a long trip and we're gonna have to get a lot of stuff, so we're probably gonna stay in a motel over night.”
Time for more people being assholes. Because let's face it, this is the Royal family, aka the angels, and most of them are dicks. (Can you tell I hate most of them? :))
“Of course.” Dean smiled at him, a little shyly, as if he was pleasantly surprised. “But, uh, didn't you say you weren't into men?”
The playground was mostly deserted at this time of night, though when they stepped close to the sandbox, a child poked their head out of the wooden structure that was meant for climbing and had a slide on the other side. Of course Castiel knew that this wasn't really a child, at least not just, though he also wondered who the angel's vessel was. Did they have a family, parents who loved them? Had the angel taken the child from them, or did they let the child take over by day and only used them this way by night? Castiel shook his head at the thought, flashing back to when he had possessed Claire for a short while, back when she had been a child. That wasn't something he was proud of, but he also couldn't really blame any of his siblings for doing the same, he supposed.
“I would hope that no one has to hunt any angels anymore.” Cas' fingers danced over Dean's shoulder. “But I think you're right. You and Sam... you've saved the world enough times to deserve a quiet life. In fact... You already deserved that after stopping the apocalypse. Maybe even before that. Do you... did I ever tell you why I didn't come to you after the apocalypse? Why I never told you directly about Sam, or asked for your help with Heaven?”
Dean's hands were already clenched into fists on the couch, and he had to bite his lip to not cuss the guy out in revenge. He would have liked to punch him, too, break his nose and make him take back everything he had said. But he couldn't risk his job, so he kept as still as possible while trembling from anger.
Cas was sitting at a little table in the corner of the room, going over their shopping list again, but he had looked up at Dean when hearing the door open. “No, I'm sorry. It's just I heard the shower stop and then... I suppose I didn't expect you to, uh, to get dressed again.” He ducked his head down towards the list again, and Dean thought he could see a slight blush on his face, though it was difficult to tell with the shitty motel lighting.
“Castiel called us.” She threw him a small smile. “Well, he called Claire to tell her you were back, and then we came over as soon as we could. Only arrived a couple hours ago. Alex has to work, so she couldn't come, but...” She let out a deep sigh. “You have no idea how glad we are to have you back.”
“You're beautiful,” Cas told him, using his other hand to grab Dean's arm, tug him down enough to kiss him. Dean let it happen, and he didn't protest the compliment, because no matter how silent they had tried to be before, it had never stopped Cas from babbling nonsense, praising Dean left and right. Dean had tried to argue against it in the beginning, but Cas had always maintained that he meant every word, and eventually Dean had given up on trying to silence him.
Dean poured a glass for himself, too, then hesitated. “Would you allow me to drink as well?” he asked, unsure if he had worded that properly.
What he was shocked at, however, was their strength. Werewolves were by no means weak, but these guys were something else, whirling him through the air and into some crates with ease and a mocking laugh. They were toying with him.
Jack nodded, as if he understood perfectly the implications of queerphobia. “I just thought... since you were in love with Dean since before I was born...” He shrugged.
Dean sat down on the bed, head in his hands. What had he agreed to? How the hells could this even be real.
“Here.” Dean shoved a water bottle at him that he'd taken from under a seat and Castiel drank greedily, like he had that first time after becoming human.
Sam seemed surprised, to say the least, but he couldn't exactly argue against it when about half a dozen people were already rushing towards putting something on that list. When he heard that they would take Cas' new car instead of Baby, though, he seemed alarmed.
Prince Castiel sighed. “Please keep your theatrics for the- No, you know what, never mind. Go all out. Maybe then you'll actually be serious in the throne room for once.”
He didn't try anything on, though he felt a little underdressed for his surroundings in his plain yellow robe. Not that there was anyone else around to judge him, though, because these were his rooms. Holy fuck.
Winter was finally withdrawing from the lands, the gardens coming to full bloom, though Castiel knew that this was at least partly due to magical support. The inhabitants of the palace were waking up from hibernation too, it seemed, and even the Crown Prince showed his face around the gardens from time to time. That day, Castiel found his brother in the olive grove, staring off into space in a way that he had never seen the man do. When he noticed Castiel, though, he put on his usual grim, determined expression.
“He's dead.” Cas' eyes turned hard for a second, then became soft again, and he was still holding Dean's hand, neither of them making a move to change that.
When he came back, he held the present out for Dean to see. Dean just shook his head, seeing Claire roll her eyes as she watched them from where she was standing with Alex and Patience. She was probably pretending to be annoyed, while secretly being pleased, that Cas liked it.
“Irresponsible sounds quite right.” Cas sighed again, and shifted, pressing his shoulders back. “Perhaps I shouldn't have told you, but I think you would have found out anyway, living in the palace.”
Dean only noticed there were tears in his eyes when Cas hugged him tight and his face was pressed against Cas' hair.
Cas looked down at himself pointedly, raising his hips a little. “Partly. I thought that was the point of the whole exercise.” Dean opened his mouth, then closed it again. “What?”
“Cas.” Dean framed his face with his hands. “I told you, it's not a big deal. No sweat off my back.”
“Booooring.” Prince Gabriel pouted. “I'd say you only know about it from all the books you read, but I doubt there's a book like that in our libraries. If there is, I certainly haven't found it yet.”
Of course anyone who knew Cas wouldn't have been surprised. After all, Cas didn't sleep. But the lady didn't know that, and Cas didn't have to go out of his way to point out that really, there was no necessity for two, no, not at all, one bed would suffice completely, thank you very much. And then the lady wished them a good night and freaking winked at Dean. He felt like dying. If Billie had turned up that exact second, he might have gone with her willingly.
“I don't care what they say.” Castiel squeezed his hand. “There are precedents for this, so if any of them dare to question me...” He shrugged.
His mom was smiling at him with a soft expression he rarely saw on her. “I'm so happy for you,” she said as she went in for a hug.
Dean shrugged. “She laughed at me, mostly. She's got a really-” He looked at Cas sheepishly. Insulting his sister probably wasn't the best idea, even if she had been an ass. “Didn't sound like a happy laugh.”
It was nice seeing them like this after their initial hang-ups about each other, the awkwardness that came from Mary being dead for over thirty years and not being exactly the mother Dean remembered. Not to mention that Mary had had to adjust to her little boys being fully grown adults now, older than she had been when she had died. Of course, Amara seemed to have brought her back in a slightly older body, which must have brought its own set of challenges with it.
“Okay,” Sam said, nodding. “That doesn't mean we can take you in or anything, we- we have the hunters from apoca- from that world here, they're not going to like the angels from their world barging in.”
Dean was still marvelling at all the plants, some of which he knew, others he had never seen, when someone called out behind him: “Can I help you?”
The lady stopped in her movement, then removed her hand. “Prince Gabriel,” she said with an obviously fake smile. “What a pleasant...” She hesitated.
“Oh?” She eyed him critically, “Am I to assume that these influences are of magical nature? I can't exactly cure him of running with the wrong crowd.” She sipped her tea thoughtfully. “Unless we're talking about mind control spells, but I don't believe we are.”
“It's not entirely necessary, but it would help replenish my grace faster,” Cas admitted. “And I'd...” He stopped, and sighed, probably biting his lip.
When they were both spent, Dean pulled out and flopped down on the mattress next to Cas, face first. When he peered up at him and saw the dopey smile on Cas' face, he was once again struck with the truth of those words: Love of his life.
And that was what Cas did. He let Dean lie more or less on top of him, cling to him, and he wrapped his arms around Dean and held onto him.
The lady had her elbow on the table, and propped her chin up in her hand. “Does he come with a recommendation, then?” She smirked again.
Dean busied himself with putting his clothes in the wardrobe, even though they looked like rags next to the fancy robes. Then he looked at the books that were sitting on a single shelve and picked one at random. It was about something called 'The Fay Wars' that had apparently lasted three years. Dean had no idea if it was a history book or just a story. He had never paid much attention in history class.
Dean full on blushed. He had thought that Cas was too serious a person to indulge in flattery, but apparently he had been wrong.”You're pretty,” he muttered instead.
After a few beats of silence, Prince Castiel said: “I don't know what I'm doing here.” He sounded nervous, and wasn't that something? Apparently Dean could make a Prince nervous, simply by being in the same room with him. Huh.
“Um,” Maggie made, raising her hand tentatively. She had been part of the last grocery run, and now she looked terrified as she glanced at Sam, probably praying for help.
Castiel sighed. “You don't have to... No, never mind.” He opened his eyes. “It's silly of me to think we could speak as equals. I'm a Prince. You would probably be polite to me even if you hate me, just like everyone else.”
a shower? What the hells. And why is this so... Is that a magic light? It's not gonna be on all night, is it? Uh, is there some trick to turning it on?” Dean clapped his hands, then clicked his fingers in front of the lamp, but before Castiel could explain, he had already turned to the cupboards, opening them and rummaging through the essentials that had been placed there. “Wow, this stuff is even more fancy than at the Harem. Wait, this says there's gold in this. What. Who the hells wants to smear themselves with gold?” He seemed downright horrified.
Cas had shown him around just the evening before, but Dean chose that morning to retrace their steps. It was easy enough for him to remember the way with a conscious effort, but he wanted it to be even easier, become muscle memory. Maybe he was being paranoid, but he liked knowing where all the exits were.
A prince wanting a relationship with a Harem employee. Whoever had heard of such a thing, outside of romantic tales? And even those were usually about two royals.
Dean took his time chewing and swallowing, his mind suddenly drifting to the future. Once Cas was human, he wouldn't be able to heal anything anymore. And if they really did retire, they wouldn't spend their time chasing after monsters, either. Instead, they would probably have a routine, maybe have three proper meals a day. Perhaps even home cooked? If he wasn't a hunter anymore, he might get to be... wow, he might actually get to be eighty years old or something like that. Which would mean another forty years, spent in peace, maybe somewhere at the beach, or in a little cottage somewhere. In any case, with Cas.
That actually managed to get a laugh out of Dean. The first of the night. “True. Should've thought that one through.”
But it kind of stung that apparently Castiel didn't think Dean worthy of sleeping with him. Of course there could be a myriad of reasons for this, including Castiel not being interested in men. But Dean still didn't have to like it.
“Hey, buckos. Miss me?” Gabriel smirked. Glancing around the library, he added: “Still living in an underground cave, huh? Very 50's.”
Dean laughed. “Yeah. Yeah, it did. But... you said you were tired of trying to fix Heaven, Cas. Well, I'm tired of trying to fix Earth. I'm thirty-nine, Cas, almost forty, for crying out loud, and... and my back hurts worse every time we have to dig up a grave, and my legs hurt from running and...” He sighed. “It's just... we've done enough, right? We've saved enough people, and there are other hunters out there, younger hunters who don't feel like death after each hunt.” Since Cas stayed silent, he felt the need to continue: “And it's not like we'd be turning our backs on the others completely, you know? Someone needs our help? Cool, we'll help. Someone needs some info, some lore? Sure, we've seen a lot of things, maybe we can give 'em some insight. Anyone need a place to hang for a while, to recover? Sure, come in, or sit down on the deck in one of the lounge chairs, you want a cocktail or a beer?”
“The porn that she gifted me. I believe it is my right to ask.” Castiel pressed a kiss to Dean's hair. “Do you regret coming out to everyone? Do you regret that they... know about us, now?”
“Yes. You deserved that life, Dean, and I couldn't bring myself to take it from you, to get you back into hunting, into saving the world...”
“Right. And how do I do that exactly?” Dean could see the gears working beneath the guard's blank expression. If they hadn't known that Dean was a commoner before, they certainly did now.
However, Cas didn't seem to get the memo of 'we should hold back', because he kept kissing Dean all over, his mouth grazing Dean's nipples, as he whispered endearments into his skin that made Dean's ears flaming red.
He was, sitting on the bed with his head bowed, staring down into the box with the figurines and the bewildering 'fanfiction', as Sam had called it. Castiel had read the term on the internet before, but wasn't entirely sure what it meant. But that wasn't important right now.
Dean took one of the glasses from him, staring at it for a moment. This wasn't meant for him, but for visitors, the crystal too fine for the employees to use. He was afraid that he would drop it and cost the palace more than he would ever earn.
After a moment, Michael nodded. “I will make no statement against you in this regard. Though you may also not expect my encouragement.”
The grumpy guys from before were still brooding in a corner, though, and now they were glaring at Cas. “What's their problem?” Dean muttered.
“You looked pretty startled yourself there for a moment.” Dean grinned, more easily this time. “Not that I blame you. If I ran into someone wearing this-” He held up the arm with the wristband. “-I'd be wary too.”
“Our situation is different, though, isn't it? For one, we're not even the same species. Secondly, I'm almost certain Eileen never told Sam that he is like a brother to her. And-”
Dean sighed again, opened his eyes sluggishly only to be met with pure blackness. In a while, his eyes would adjust enough to make out vague shapes with what little light came in under the door. But instead of waiting, Dean turned on the lamp on his bedside table.
Gabriel looked at him more gravely than he had ever seen him, at least in his human form, then nodded. It wasn't unexpected, but still a shock, that he couldn't see his brother's true form anymore, the powerful archangel now fully reduced to the short human in his vision. Castiel had never considered Gabriel as being smaller than himself before.
Dean hesitated. He had had a variety of jobs, none of them glamorous, and none of them had paid enough to support Sam's studies. “This and that.”
He closed the window again, turning towards his rooms. There was one door he hadn't explored yet, but he had an idea where it led. When he opened it, he saw another bedroom, almost a mirror image of his own, even similarly decorated. Dean smiled, then closed the door again. He wouldn't go through Cas' room when he wasn't there, that just felt wrong, despite how curious he was.
Castiel was so lost in thought that he almost ran into Dean when he stopped in the doorway. Glancing over his shoulder, Castiel saw Claire, leaning against the table with a smirk on her face, apparently waiting for them.
“See, this is why I like you, Dean-erino.” Prince Gabriel sipped on his wine, not a care in the world.
Alright, it's time folks. Time for Cas to go through with what he wants. *insert 'Detroit become human' joke here*
“Honestly, I just want to kiss you all night.” Cas said it like it was the easiest thing in the world, like it was normal for a prince to say that to a commoner.
“I know.” Cas ran a hand through his hair, messing it up even further than it already was. “I'm sorry.”
“No, my Prince. It is nothing quite that... distinguished.” His first instinct had been to say fancy. “It is meant to depict a simple hunt, featuring nameless hunters.”
, something that affected him just as much as his four layers of clothing did, sitting heavy and blissfully warm on his frame, just as he felt every breath he took, the beating of his heart, the twitching of his fingers and light tingling in his toes as the last drops of grace fell from him.
“I was going to say I'll beat them over the head with the respective books until they behave properly towards you, but I suppose your suggestion might work, too.”
Dean let out a shaky breath and sniffed, wrapping his arms tightly around Castiel as he pressed his face into the crook of his neck.
The baker blinked at him in surprise just as the other person – Lily – came rushing back. “I'm so sorry, but there was this-” Seeing Dean, they shut their mouth immediately.
But now Dean was back, and they were as safe as they hadn't been in a long time, no overwhelmingly powerful enemy rearing its head. Castiel could only hope that it would stay that way.
They were both old by now. Maybe that explained why Sam had such trouble adjusting to Cas and Dean together. Their mom had also reminded Dean of something he had told her himself: That he had to be Sam's mom and dad, that he was as much a parental figure to him as a brother. And children often had issues with their parents dating someone new.
“Kinda.” Dean decided he didn't mind if Castiel knew about his circumstances. He seemed like a good enough guy. “He's at the Academy.”
“Your highness,” they muttered, trying to bow with the pies still in their hands. Dean caught one as it threatened to fall, and he hissed at the heat of the metal plate, quickly withdrawing his hand once he had nudged the pie back into safety on the person's hand. He only saw now that the other person was wearing baking mittens.
“He's not a thing, Hester, and yes, he is the one I chose.” Castiel straightened his back. “I'll not hear a bad word about him.”
Prince Castiel sighed contentedly and stirred when Dean let up his ministrations. It must have been at least a half an hour, and his arms were getting tired.
Dean was actually kind of glad that the Prince's back was so full of kinks, because at least that distracted him and kept his blood, mostly, in his head.
“What about your... do you have another parent?” The Prince's voice was soft again, and Dean wondered how such a deep voice could sound this kind.
Dean turned his head to the side so his mouth wasn't all but pressed against Cas' chest when he spoke: “Okay? I mean, do you... you need to?”
“Your presents? The pile next to mine?” Dean gestured towards where he had seen the colourfully wrapped boxes labelled with Cas' name, where he himself had dropped his present half a day before.
They hadn't told anyone, because Dean had been too much of a coward to reveal it even to Sam, so they had kept it to themselves, and they had locked the door to Dean's room when Cas stayed with him. There had been more kisses, and even some sex, though they mostly kept it PG for fear Sam or Jack might overhear them.
They walked through a hallway that didn't seem to want to end, then through a set of doors, another stairway, down another hallway.
Sometimes, when he wasn't there, Dean jerked off to the image of Castiel, feeling guilty afterwards. Using a literal prince as porn fodder was probably punishable by some law or other. He would have asked Sam, but he still couldn't bring himself to tell him where he was.
She waved a hand dismissively, reminding him, of all things, of Gabriel. “You can drop the charade now, I know Castiel would never do something this... inappropriate.”
So Dean swallowed down his protest and just said: “Yeah, maybe.” Maybe it really was time to make him that other mixtape, after all.
“Right. So.” Dean's hands were sweaty and he tried wiping them on his jeans, but it didn't help much. “You threw me on the bed. And stuff.”
Cas was smiling again, a clear sign that despite how serious his words had sounded, they had been meant as a joke. Sometimes, it was difficult to decipher if Cas genuinely didn't understand a term or reference, or if he was being sarcastic.
They sat leaning against each other, Cas' hand finding his as they watched more firework going up. After a while, Cas said: “I know I just talked about free will and all that, so it's of course entirely your own decision, but I'd really love it if you made your lasagne again tomorrow.”
And then Prince Castiel returned, standing in the middle of the room like a deer in the torch light.
“Yes, you will.” Castiel took the time to press a kiss to Dean's hair while he tied his shoes. Then he quickly left the room.
“Hm. I always knew she had good taste.” Gabriel snorted. “Don't look at me like that. Did you come here to get my help, or to mope?”
“Or...?” Dean wiggled his eyebrows and Cas leaned in to kiss him. It was a little sloppy at first because they were both smiling, but after a while, they managed to get it right and Dean wrapped his arms around Cas' lower back to pull him closer while one of Cas' hands came up on his shoulder, the other hand still caressing Dean's face.
“Hey,” Dean replied with a smile, and Cas immediately mirrored his expression, except a million times brighter. It was a miracle that his face didn't split in half with that wide a smile.
“Oh, lighten up, Clarence. Don't worry, we're not going to your rooms to fuck, and I won't even try to bathe with you. But we can talk while you're in the tub, anyway, and I can go through your desk and steal all your secrets.”
“Mom died in the fire. When... It's why we moved.” Dean gulped around the lump in his throat. Thinking about his mother always made his eyes sting.
“Really, Chief? And dude, I was too shocked to say anything yesterday, but that beard gave me nightmares.” When Cas opened his mouth to say something, Dean threw him a look that made him stay silent.
“No, I don't think she wrote it. There is an author mentioned, but it doesn't sound like a human name. Oh, that is...” Cas tilted his head as he looked over a few more pages, glanced at Dean with a slight blush. “Uhm. This is rather... uhm. Anatomically questionable.”
His mom and Bobby – the other Bobby, as Sam had to remind himself – were sitting at the table, eating breakfast, while Maggie was busy doing the dishes.
He drank the milk and took the cookies, keeping his eyes on Jack to monitor if he was still asleep, and thankfully there was no disturbance in the even breath and heartbeat of the boy, even as Castiel slowly backed out of the room. In the hall, he almost collided with Eileen, who raised an eyebrow at him.
Dean rubbed a hand over his face. “I just-” He stopped himself, or maybe he couldn't go on, his voice shaking and sounding like he was choking.
After one and a half weeks, though, the others had mostly grown tired of bugging him and had turned to other, even juicier gossip. Dean encouraged it, not really caring about any scandals, but glad that he wasn't the centre of attention anymore.
“Really?” Dean didn't know why he was so surprised. After all, people lied all the time, and the Royal Family were people, too. “Like what?”
At last, his uncle looked equally shocked as Cas had before. “You- you have no right to-” he stuttered.
“In fact,” Castiel continued, already grabbing his robe, “you have to get up too, so I can ask you again.”
“What?” Dean grabbed the papers, skimmed a few of the paragraphs. “What the fuck- don't-” He stuffed them back into the box, wrestling it out of Cas' hands. “Don't read that. I'm gonna- gonna put this away.” His face felt like it was on fire, and when he glanced up towards Claire, she had the gall to grin at him.
The grace leaving his vessel – his body – was like a floodgate being opened, but instead of a liquid, he was losing connection to the world around him. The voices of the other angels, the low, warm hum of Heaven, the essence of the universe, a mixture of the sharp cold stillness of space and the movement of suns, planets and living beings alike, their warmth gentle and buzzing. All of this was fading, slipping through his proverbial fingers. But he also gained a connection, to himself, his vessel – his body, and yes, also the world, though only in extension.
“Yeah, whatever.” They watched as the angels filed out of the garage door one after the other, then zapped off. One of them threw a last, thoughtful look at Cas, who waved at them a little awkwardly.
“Yeah.” Dean turned to him and they kissed again to the background of colourful sparks forming more hearts.
Dean's hand froze, his fork hanging in the air midway to his mouth as he tried to get more of what the lady was saying. The TV was still muted, though, and he couldn't read lips. Now he really wished Eileen was here. Or maybe not. After her last run-in with a hellhound had almost resulted in her death, maybe she wouldn't be too big on dealing with anything canine.
Dean shrugged. “I provide a service, my Prince. The customer has every right to voice his expectations.”
“As long as you like it.” Castiel shrugged, walking over to ring the bell for a servant. It didn't take long for them to appear, and they ordered dinner, then sat down at the dining table together. When Castiel's eyes landed on the half-empty plate of pie, he raised an eyebrow. “You ate half of it?” he asked, surprised.
“Excuse me,” he said to the person who he thought was named Sara, recognizing her from his previous visits as well as from Dean's descriptions. But he wasn't a hundred percent sure about her name, and didn't mean to offend her. He put a hand over his heart and bowed his head slightly. “Heaven's blessing to you. May I inquire... have you seen Dean?”
Cas laughed. “Yes, I'm certain these bags under my eyes make me look astounding. Do they give my face a certain je ne sais quoi?”
“I just figured that you two didn't like to be public about it. But everyone's making comments about you either 'finally getting your shit together' or them 'never having guessed in a million years' and now I'm confused.”
Prince Castiel nodded, turning to him with a grave expression. “Apologies. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.”
“My gorgeous righteous man,” Cas murmured as he kissed Dean's shoulder, right where the hand print used to be, and Dean wanted to cry, wanted to fuck himself on Cas' fingers harder, let go and just come unravelled, screw everyone else in the bunker.
Dean hadn't seen Prince Castiel for two weeks, might have almost forgotten him if the others didn't constantly pester him with questions. Somehow, they couldn't believe that they hadn't fucked, thinking that Castiel must have either bribed or threatened him not to talk about it.
Castiel shifted uncomfortably while Hester gritted her teeth audibly. “He must be under a spell. There's no other logical explanation.”
Dean's legs gave out. If it hadn't been for years of hunting schooling his reflexes, he probably wouldn't have been able to catch himself on the sink at the last second. He tried to stand back up immediately, but his breathing was coming too fast and his heart was hammering in his chest, so he decided to let himself sink down onto the ground instead. Slowly, he sat down on the cold tile floor, one hand still on the sink, and he managed to move himself up against the wall, to lean against it.
“What is it?” Beneath his usual rough demeanour, Castiel detected a hint of curiosity. Castiel rarely ever asked for anything.
“Sister, please.” Castiel put a hand on her arm, surprised at his own calm. “You have your answer. Now leave it.”
“I'd be surprised if you'd have found any books at all, considering you never visit the libraries,” Prince Castiel dead-panned, taking a sip of his wine.“But perhaps we can still get a book befitting of you. One with many pictures and few words... Perhaps one of Hester's children has one for you.”
In the evening, a bunch of people decided to watch some Christmas movies to get into the spirit. Cas, arguing that it was Christmas Eve, after all, managed to convince Dean to join in, so they sat on one of the new couches that had been added to the Dean Cave in Dean's absence, to give more people space to sit. It was crowded, but no one really seemed to mind, and they watched a version of the Grinch, which made Cas pretty thoughtful, and then some other silly movies. At some point though, Dean must have fallen asleep, because when he opened his eyes, his head was on Cas' shoulder and the room was mostly empty.
He was almost sure – almost – that he was of the Royal Family, what with the crest on the pin on his chest. Cas had once explained to him that all the princes and princesses wore it, but this guy seemed a bit too old to be the king's child. He looked more like a bureaucrat, though with the temper of a drunken sailor.
“You mean like, to ward her off?” The idea of Princess Hester not being able to get near him and screaming in rage as she tried, made his lips twitch upwards.
“I couldn't possibly do that to you again.” The Prince frowned, sitting up. “I already feel guilty for last time.”
“I know that's not what you want.” Cas sounded so sad it broke Dean's heart, and his words confused him to no end. “If I thought you'd say yes, I'd ask you to be mine right now.”
It was another week before Castiel made it to the Harem again, a small smile tugging at his lips at the prospect of seeing Dean again. When he spotted Dean in one of the alcoves, though, Castiel's mood immediately dropped.
Except he wouldn't have, because despite the embarrassment, he was actually looking very much forward to what was about to happen. Or what he hoped would happen.
That night, Cas managed to sneak into his room again just about a minute before Dean would have locked up. But he just stood there, a little awkwardly, hands in his trench coat, until finally he said: “I wasn't sure if you wanted me to come tonight.”
“Yeah, well. I have faith for the both of us.” Dean grinned when Cas raised an eyebrow at him. “What? I have faith nowadays. Not in God or angels or whatever, but in... in us.” He blushed, tried to cover it up by taking a drink from his glass. “In you.”
Great. Apparently, Dean's brain was working overtime and it was currently busy convincing him that Cas didn't want to sleep with him. Maybe he should shut the whole thing down. Hadn't they bought like a few gallons of eggnog or something?
Cas moaned, his hips bucking ever so slightly off the bed, and he put a hand into Dean's hair again, as he often did during sex. “I don't care where your penis is, Dean, as long as you're close to me.” But his breathing was hard, and it hitched when Dean kissed his way down towards his hips.
Castiel considered him for a moment, feeling a pang of sympathy and guilt. He shouldn't have occupied his bed, but he was glad that Dean hadn't shared it with him. It wasn't that he disliked the man, but his personal space was important to him and having someone in the same bed usually violated that.
Dean blinked at him. He had never received a request before. He had been chosen, wanted, but he had never been asked since he started working here. Of course, a Prince's request was as good as an order, but still.
“We'll keep this around,” Gabriel called after them, holding up the vial. “Just in case you need it at some point, after all.”
“Yes. Sam told him that he was not real, but rather a fabrication based on the historical figure Saint Nicholas, but Jack seems to believe that he might exist, after all.” Cas smiled. “His reasoning was that most people don't believe that angels or ghosts exist, and yet they do. So just because we think something isn't real doesn't necessarily make it so.”
Of course it could have been worse. Dean could have had a job that paid less, or had worse working conditions. Of course, living in the Harem, unable to leave for the city except for one hour a day was pretty restricted. Then again, there wasn't much left for him in the city since Sam had left.
Jack frowned again. “Does that mean you were together before today? I was so sure, but the others said such contradictory things, including Sam...”
Cas grimaced. “In her own way.” He let go of Dean's hands and sat down on the bed. Dean joined him. “I had hoped that everyone would be too busy with the preparations for the coronation, but apparently my sister's mind can handle multiple sources of rage at once.”
“Certainly.” MacLeod made a dismissive gesture and tucked her read hair behind her ear. “Now, what can you offer me as payment for this task?” She set down her pen and looked to Castiel, who wasn't particularly inclined to offer her anything. Besides, he knew that she rarely worked for coin, being paid by the crown, anyway.
Cas smiled and put both hands on Dean's shoulders, turned him a bit so he was standing at a better angle to the bed, and ultimately shoved him onto it. Dean went down with a yelp, and Cas followed him immediately, hovered over him with his knees pressed into the mattress. “Maybe you wanted to pray for this?”
Her grin only widened when Dean and Castiel both looked up above the door, to the frame of which someone had taped the twig in question. Castiel wasn't sure if it should look like this, duct tape covering about half of the thing, but he supposed that Maggie hadn't dared to damage to door by using a nail.
The negotiations with Crowley, the owner of the bakery, had been long and tedious and Castiel had imagined himself choking the man more than once. Or at least punching that self-satisfied smirk off his face.
The next morning, Dean shovelled bacon and eggs onto his plate in the motel breakfast room while Cas got them coffee. There were few people in the room, but somehow the backdrop of the conversations around him was still a relief to Dean. You would think that with someone else in your head, it would never be quiet, but instead the silence had been deafening at times while Michael was in charge, so this was a nice change of pace. Another reminder that he was back again, among humans.
It was the middle of the night, and Dean hated waking up to nothing but darkness when it reminded him so much of his time under Michael. Whenever it hadn't been blood and fire, it had been darkness, swallowing him, drowning him. But at least right now, Cas was there, warm and solid against him, a reminder that he wasn't alone, that he hadn't drowned, that he was back. That he was okay.
“They just call it their world, you know.” Gabriel shrugged. “And I kinda promised them protection, so put the sandwich cutter away, will you, Cassie?”
Dean stopped in his steps, breath catching in his throat. It was beautiful. Where he had only made out a bunch of slim shadows and dark leaves before, he now saw that the court yard was a splendid tree grove, with flowers of all sizes and colours blooming in and around it despite the early time of the year. The pure size of it was imposing, too: It stretched for what could have been an entire block, maybe two, in the Oxwell district.
“Really need to work on that dirty talk, hon.” Dean winked at him before he sat up and grabbed the lube again. While he slicked up his fingers, Cas looked at him with that frustrating calm of his.
Just when Cas started unwrapping it, though, he tensed, his brows creasing into a frown. He stopped what he was doing to look up, stare into the direction of the door.
Dean and Cas have an important conversation. There are more Star Trek references, because I cannot help myself.
So he worked harder, made his thrusts more powerful, his angle better, until he could feel himself getting closer and closer.
It didn't take long before he had two fingers in Dean, his other hand stroking him while he alternated between biting and kissing his nipples.
“Uh,” he made, looking at the guards outside the door, one next to his room, the other next to Cas'. “So, what do I have to do to get something to eat around here?”
“Let's stay another night,” Cas said after they had sat like that for a while. If Cas had been human, his knees probably would have protested by now.
“Oh, hells yes.” Dean grinned, shuffling a little closer. “Is that what you want? Did you wake up horny today?”
– that's... an accomplishment, I suppose?” Cas' breath was going faster again, now that Dean's finger was all the way in and he started pulling it out only to push it back in.
Dean looked down at himself, at the robe he had been wearing most days in the Harem, a short yellow thing without much ornamentation. It would be clear to anyone who saw him that he was a stranger to the palace, and Castiel wanted to change that.
The grace leaving his vessel – his body – was like a floodgate being opened, but instead of a liquid, he was losing connection to the world around him. The voices of the other angels, the low, warm hum of Heaven, the essence of the universe, a mixture of the sharp cold stillness of space and the movement of suns, planets and living beings alike, their warmth gentle and buzzing. All of this was fading, slipping through his proverbial fingers. But he also gained a connection, to himself, his vessel – his body, and yes, also the world, though only in extension. Suddenly, the cool air was more than an afterthought, more than a compartmentalized but ultimately meaningless observation. It was a
“That's not-” Prince Castiel glared at his brother. “Fine. One night. And then you'll leave me in peace.”
Dean stiffened, and Cas' fingers stopped in his hair, his hand sliding over to his shoulder. “Human?” Dean whispered, even lower than before, not quite ready to voice this possibility out loud. “Why? You'd be... you'd be mortal.”
Sam turned to him, and he ignored Dean's laugh and his disbelieving repetition of the word to listen to Thomas' status report and give him directions to pass on to the hunters currently on a case. By the time he turned back to the others, Dean was almost finished eating, and he was grinning widely.
“Ask you to be my companion.” Castiel took one of Dean's hands in his. “I know your answer probably hasn't changed, but I still need to try.”
Taking a deep breath, Dean forced himself to take one of his presents, weighing it in his hands with wonder. Under his name, in small writing, the tag said 'From: Mom'. He got actual fucking Christmas presents from his mom now, apparently, wrapped up all nice and tidy. (Well, okay, maybe not tidy. He might have to give her lessons on how to wrap presents properly, though at least this told him that she had definitely done it herself.)
Dean froze, his eyes widening in shock as realization started to set in. The wolf used that exact moment to pounce on him, and Dean only managed to evade at the last moment, staggering back a bit while the wolf was already whirling around to strike again. If he couldn't pull himself together, Dean was done for, would end up as kebab on the floor, sliced by those claws, but he still couldn't wrap his head around what the thing had said, couldn't, no, didn't want to believe what it had implied...
That got him a laugh from almost everyone, and an eye roll from Claire. Cas was still looking at him with a fond smile, as he had for most of the hugging session. Eventually, Jack let go and everyone decided that they should give Dean some space to rest, so they started filing out of the room.
Michael held up a hand to stop him. “Did you come here to get my blessing for your... whatever he is to you?”
Cas scowled at him. “We did not make Jack do anything. He volunteered to try it. It was his idea.” He sighed. “He really... Out of all of us, I think he wanted Michael dead the most. I mean, Sam and I, we were mostly thinking about getting you back, but Jack... He saw what Michael did in apocalypse world and he is young and seeing all that carnage...”
It did nothing. When he pierced the werewolf with the knife, the thing only laughed and sent him flying again, and this time his shoulder hit a metal edge, sending spikes of pain through his arm and back.
He tried to take measured breaths to ease his nerves, but it wasn't working. Just as he was about to throw his bag off the bed, there was a knock on the door and then it opened before Dean could say anything.
“No, thank you.” Prince Castiel half-turned towards him. “This wall hanging... does it depict the Slaying of the Demon Hog? It appears a little...” He gestured vaguely.
“The one with the long hair,” Cas whispered back. When Dean just looked at him impishly, he added: “You know full well that I don't mean Sam.”
Then he remembered why he was on that couch, and he scrambled to his feet, only to find his bed empty. The covers were bunched up at the foot of the bed, and when Dean put a probing hand on the mattress, it was cold. So Prince Castiel must have left some time ago.
“Cool. One more question before you run off to do your Chief-thing,” Dean said. “Is it always wolves and vamps? Those are the ones I heard about, but are there any other spiced up monsters we know about?”
“Oh, right. Dark Kaia... Apparently, she comes from that monster world you and Sam went to a while back. She is that world's equivalent of our Kaia Nieves. Claire is the one who started calling her Dark Kaia, since... Well, she seems to like dark robes.”
Gabriel raised an eyebrow. “Not what I wanted to say, but okay. Are you freaking out? Because you look like you're freaking out.”
“Don't want me in you?” Dean teased, and licked over one of Cas' nipples before sucking it into his mouth.
“Dean?” he whispered into his hair after turning off the lights. “Is it okay if I... do you mind if I sleep? Just for a few hours.”
“I am not drunk, but you certainly seem to be. How could you let your common sense fly out of the window like that,” the guy bellowed. He was considerably smaller than Cas and didn't bear any resemblance to him. If he was his uncle, then he must be the King's brother, though, Dean realized with a start.
But Sam didn't get the chance to muse on it any further, because Dean chose exactly that moment to walk into the kitchen. “Morning,” he called cheerfully, making a beeline for the fridge. Cas was trailing behind him, but stopped next to the fridge, not bothering to look inside. No wonder, since he didn't need to eat.
“Oh. That's good then,” Castiel said, then bristled. “I mean. You are of course free to have sex with anyone you wish. And Gabriel is of course free to spend his time with whoever he wishes.”
“And which of my siblings has made that colossal mistake?” she asked, sweeping her eyes up and down his body.
“We're so going to a waffle place. And, uh, you like PB&J, right? And burritos. I'm gonna make you some of those.”
“Ah, yes. Meeting yourself can be... difficult.” Castiel shifted on his feet. Ezekiel followed the movement with several of his eyes – not the human ones. It was one of the countless habits Castiel had picked up from the humans over the years.
“Come in.” He got up from his chair, stretching his back a little. When he looked to the door, though, it was Hester, wearing her violet dress, the one so tight around her waist it seemed as if she wanted to rub it under everyone's nose how fast she had lost her pregnancy weight again. “Hester, what a... surprise. What can I do for you?”
“This is nice,” Cas said softly, and Dean didn't know if he meant the New Year's preparations or the two of them being close, but he couldn't have agreed more.
After all this time, Dean thought that the sight of Cas practically naked should have been more than enough to get him horny, but all he really wanted was to be held, to be enveloped by those strong arms, to be protected. To feel safe.
“Hm. That's a little better,” Dean replied, and pushed his finger in, just the tip, making Cas' breath hitch again. But he quickly relaxed into it, as he always did. The first time, they had both been a little nervous about it, but had soon found that Cas didn't have much of a problem with something entering his vessel that way. His comment on the matter was that he hadn't minded the knife Dean had pushed into his chest on their first meeting, so why be bothered by a finger inside of him somewhere it wouldn't even draw blood.
Cas laughed. “I'm not sure he needs that, but it is a sweet idea. Though I'm afraid he will just hold it against me that I 'owe him one', as he would say.”
Dean suddenly seemed nervous, fiddling with his bracelet. “So, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.”
“Alright, you sap,” he said, trying to chase the tears away with a smile, “are ya gonna kiss me all night, or are we gonna fuck?”
“You kil-” Dean's voice had become loud and shrill, and people were turning their heads, so he lowered it to a whisper: “You killed yourself?”
“Cas.” Dean's voice was unsteady. “Don't say that. What the hells.” He grabbed one of Cas' hands, barely registering that it was still full of lube. “Did you have too much wine? Is that why you're saying this?”
“It's okay,” Cas told him, “their bites have no effect on angels.” For about two seconds, his eyes glowed blue, and then the bleeding had stopped, the wounds closed. Cas smiled at him wearily.
“Can,” Cas argued, squinting at him, and Dean couldn't help but think that yeah, maybe you could love something you thought was stupid. Just like he loved the way Cas tilted his head when he was confused, or this very squint when he was angry or pretending to be angry, or his stupid ass jokes and sarcasm.
numbers are still small, and if anything happens again... Well. Maybe this can help. Though I'm not actually doing this for Heaven. I'm doing it for me, and am just leaving the grace to you instead of entrusting it to Dean out of the goodness of my heart.” He knew his face was expressionless as he said it, and as intended, both Gabriel rolled his eyes (not all of them this time, but several) and Dean smiled.
“Lady Margaret! How nice to see you,” he said jovially, squeezing the man and the woman he had his arms around.
“Why the hell isn't there any bacon?” Dean complained, pulling his head out of the fridge long enough to throw a reproachful look at Sam. “Who the fuck's in charge of groceries around here?”
A knock startled Castiel out of his reverie. He had made the same calculation three times, resulting in three different figures, and he rubbed his eyes wearily, hoping Dean was back. He had told him not to disturb him until lunch, but at this point, Castiel could really use some distraction.
“What do you want to be doing, my Prince?” Dean asked, trying for his best silken voice, though it probably sounded like a tease or a challenge, anyway.
“A man with a cruel heart, Cassie, do try to keep up. Anyway, Dean is allowed to be annoyed by me, but you're my brother. You're supposed to love me anyway.”
“Can I go to the city, too? I haven't really been there in a while.” Dean hummed around a piece of meat. “Wait, could I visit the Academy?” He seemed to marvel at his own idea.
“I suppose I let them choose for me. But before you ask, no, I do not go along with every proposition I get. Mostly because I'm rather slow on the uptake on these things and tend not to understand what's been offered.” He heard and felt Dean laugh against his chest. “If I don't like someone, I don't have sex with them. Or if there is some other reason against it, like not being in the mood. Which is most days.”
“You know, you haven't told me yours yet.” Dean should just let him leave, shouldn't rope him into staying with him. What good was there to it? It wasn't like they could become friends, not with Castiel being a gods damned prince, and he was certainly not interested in Dean. But knowing that didn't stop his tongue from acting up. “The expectations placed on you?”
Why was Gabriel sitting so close to him and where was that hand that he couldn't see behind the table?
“Did us dressing up as cowboys not count as a date?” Cas asked, looking unimpressed. “I certainly wouldn't have agreed to it if you hadn't kissed me.”
“Oh, I wouldn't do that to my worst enemies, so I'll leave you to it. It was nice meeting you, Benny.”
“Not right away, but... what do you think being a Royal Companion means, exactly?” He crossed his arms.
“That's what I was told, too. But sometimes I wonder if that story is a fabrication to hide the truth.” Castiel sighed. “It wouldn't be the first lie the palace has spun to keep up pretences.”
It was a smell that made him stop, sniffing the air like a blood-hound picking up the trail of its prey. Sam had often likened him to one whenever he caught this familiar scent, teasing him relentlessly. Dean had never cared, his mind too focused in those moments. He smelled freshly baked pie, and he wanted it.
Sam sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Dean knew that he was already working himself ragged, was already getting too little sleep, and the last thing he needed was his brother pushing for answers they didn't have, but Dean needed something. Anything.
Or at least he looked like Gabriel, like the vessel the guy had used in all the time Dean had known him, whenever he hadn't shifted his appearance to fool and trick them.
Castiel shrugged, then pulled Dean close to him again. “I have had sex before. It was pleasant, for the most part.”
„Did you hear about the Vyrulian princet? They say they have three spouses and one of them is the sister of-”
Dean was holding the vial, having put the cork in, staring down at it with an unreadable expression.
“And thank you, Dean,” Castiel said, putting a hand on his shoulder and getting a crooked smile in return.
“Yeah, sure. I've seen them before, but that doesn't mean I know 'em. Besides, that was six months ago.”
Dean nodded. He had heard about the Princess' death all his life, how it had been a day of mourning for the kingdom.
“Yeah.” Dean nodded, slowly, then patted the mattress beside him. “Come on, let's watch some movies. I snagged Sam's laptop earlier.”
Cas had told Dean that he would have his rooms readied and would pick him up around noon. Until then, Dean was supposed to pack his things, which wasn't much. A couple clothes that he had barely worn since working here, some trinkets, his wall hanging, the letters from Sam. He packed it all in a haze, then stared down at his bag, resisting the urge to unpack it all again.
“They're making it for everyone. You could ask if they still need a hand, but I think Maggie might implode if she has to coordinate any more people in there.”
“We're right there.” Dean gestured with his hand towards what he thought was north, not quiet sure why they were even discussing this. They could already be on their way to gut the thing.
Dean had never been so close to the fireworks before. People in the city usually did their own thing, shooting up a few rockets, but he had never seen anything like this. It was colourful, but not chaotic, a strange rhythm to it that Dean couldn't quite decipher.
He got about halfway with pulling the bottle out of the bag before Dean frantically pushed it back in, his face burning. “Don't take that out here,” he hissed, glancing around to check if anyone had seen. But no one paid any attention to them.
Meg rolled her eyes and grabbed his wrist. “Come on let's go to your rooms, we can hold our little meeting there. Besides, you need a bath. And a comb, not that that helps much with your hair. I've never seen you unshaven before, but I think I like it. Do put on some new clothes though, these are all wrinkled and probably stained.” She smirked.
Castiel started on a story about how Gabriel had once tried to steal the King's crown, and Dean let him talk a while before he asked: “Why do you always say 'our father'?”
Dean sighed. “No. It's just... all so unreal, you know? I hardly know anything about the palace. Hells, Sam probably knows more about etiquette and how to address people properly and all that stuff than I ever will. He's far better suited for this place than I am.” He scratched at a barely visible stain on the table.
“Oh.” Castiel felt his shoulders sag as the ice in his gut slowly thawed. “Uh, thank you.” He indicated another bow and took off towards Dean's room.
Still, seeing the scowl on Dean's face as he tried hard not to move, Castiel decided to indulge him once more. “There is nothing wrong with your clothes, Dean, but they are hardly fitting for the palace.”
The moment Castiel's eyes found Dean, he froze. Dean was sitting on a couch, awfully close to the person next to him, pouring them wine and smiling sweetly. Castiel felt his heart crack, realizing once again that this was Dean's job, that he was paid to be nice to everyone. Castiel wasn't special.
“You say that as if I couldn't do that in reality,” Gabriel scoffed, then grinned at him. “If it's any consolation, I think Cassie is doing the right thing. Or at least I hope so.”
“No, I'm afraid I haven't made it to him yet. There are just so many distractions here.” Gabriel smiled at the man to the left of him. Dean saw more people approaching them, and Gabriel waved them forward. “But I do have another recommendation. Jacky and Jerry are our finest jewels, as well as our latest additions to the menu.” He grinned at them.
“You said the tree's a pagan tradition,” someone butted in, interrupting the moment between the two. Seemed like more people had been listening than Dean had thought. “Does that mean we, uh, technically worship them by putting up a tree?”
“It's mostly werewolves and vampires, yeah, but... there was also a djinn. Mom and Bobby took him down.” Sam frowned, obviously trying to think back to the 'reports' that people now apparently gave him. The nerd. “I don't think there's any others we've encountered yet, but of course that doesn't mean they don't exist. Maybe they're just better at keeping out of our way.”
After a few seconds of silence, Cas nodded. “You're right. Let's call Sam to tell him we're on this.”
His mom and Bobby – the other Bobby, as Sam had to remind himself – were sitting at the table, eating breakfast, while Maggie was busy doing the dishes.
They only had sex every now and then, but Castiel surprised him by switching positions. He hadn't exactly expected a prince to let Dean fuck him, but Castiel seemed to enjoy it, if his unashamed moaning and the pleased smiles afterwards were anything to go by. Other nights they usually cuddled, always talked. Dean thought he could get used to Castiel's strong arms around him.
They also talked about Sam and the Academy, or what Dean knew about the Academy from Sam's letters. Apparently, it was huge and imposing and full of the most capable scholars the world had ever seen. Of course Sam might have embellished some, especially in his first letters, when he had still been a starry-eyed first year. In his most recent letters, he mostly complained about whatever teacher gave them unreasonable amounts of homework. His passion for the courses he took still shone through, though. Some day, Dean knew, he would be a great scholar like his teachers, maybe even greater. Perhaps he could even work for the palace...
“You're not a thing, Dean. But yes, you are extremely pretty and I like looking at you very much.” Cas hummed. “I like you very much.”
“If you come to me for this, it must have a political component.” Michael's voice was cool and even. “Is this about your frequent visits to the Harem?”
Sam wasn't sure if Dean was even any help or if he was just trying to snag a taste here and there, and he was too occupied with debriefing the hunters who kept coming in to really check on him. But when he managed to get away for a few minutes, he found Dean with his arms deep in a baking bowl, kneading dough, while Cas held a package of flour, apparently ready to add some whenever it was needed. Around them, there were half a dozen other people cooking and baking, with Maggie seemingly in charge, walking around the kitchen to answer questions and help where it was necessary.
“Then I'm great. I-” The rest of the sentence was swallowed by a sudden coughing fit, and Cas immediately reached out to help Dean sit up, then grabbed a water bottle from the nightstand and opened it.
Perhaps then his sister would calm down a bit, he thought without much hope. Really, the best he could hope for was that at least Hester wouldn't be sneering about Dean's attire anymore. And at least Dean would finally get to wear clothes that befitted his natural beauty.
Dean squirmed a little in his arms. “Figured a human wouldn't have been much help. At least not as much as the King of Hell.”
“Yeah.” When they pulled apart again, Dean left his hand on Cas' shoulder, but just as he inhaled to say the words he hadn't been able to say for over six months, the door creaked and they both jumped, breaking all physical contact just in time as Jody popped her head into the room.
“Told you,” Dean mumbled, looking embarrassed. “I mean, come on. It tastes really good. How the hells was I supposed to hold back from that?”
When he was out of sight, Dean stretched and got up from the couch. “I'm gonna head to bed, too,” he told Cas, and after checking there was no one else in the room beside them, he added: “You coming?”
Dean was glad to be rid of the tailor. They were just doing their job, he knew, but their job was a real pain in the ass, and Dean had sighed in relief when they had finally packed their things and left. He already dreaded the day that his new clothing would arrive, and he was sure he would hate his appointment with the shoe maker the next day, but at least for now he was free to do what he wanted again.
“You were already there at five to?” Castiel asked, confused. Meg was usually the one to make him wait.
“I- I really want to, but... I need this job, Cas.” Dean bit his lip. “What work could I even find as a Royal Companion? I doubt I could stay here and I mean... Sammy needs that money.”
They glared at each other. The High Enchantress cleared her throat, and Castiel realized she was smiling at him slyly. “I do believe that is enough payment. Now, my dear boy.” She held out her hands over the coffee table. “Come on, don't be shy.”
“You don't like it?” Cas asked, and Dean didn't even protest when he took away the carton, which still held a last slice of pizza, and placed it on the bedside table.
“Oh?” Gabriel looked between the two. “I see you have developed a preference. But don't worry, I'm sure we can find someone else for you. There are these two very sexy-”
After that, Castiel came back at least once a week, sometimes twice. Dean would sometimes get up without being prompted when he saw him, and the prince never corrected him, never went for someone else.
A smile stole itself onto Castiel's face. “No promises. Though I imagine that if he behaves any way other than cordially towards you in this regard, Eileen will be quicker to beat him upon the head than I'll be.”
“Ugh. What high praise.” Dean let his finger wander to Cas' hole regardless, just drawing smaller and smaller circles there without breaching the ring of muscle yet.
“Yes, it's me,” he whispered back, content when Dean turned the safety back on and put the gun under his pillow.
Out in the yard, there were more people, and for all intents and purposes, the place looked similar to the courtyard, just with a little more naked skin and people sitting and standing a lot closer.
Castiel had barely eaten anything all day, and the thought of all the foods he had so painstakingly planned together with the kitchens made him sick. He was also almost certain that he had bags under his eyes, though he had barely glanced at a mirror for the past few days.
When Dean got back up and turned around, Prince Castiel was studying the wall hangings on the opposite side of the room. Either he was disinterested in both Dean and the fire, or he was playing at being tough.
Still, he was bored. He almost wished that Prince Gabriel would show his ugly face. At least the guy was entertaining.
“Look at that. My little android's learning.” Dean huffed out a laugh. “How long was I out for? I mean, after...”
Sam thought he was talking to him, but Cas moved before he had any chance to, and Dean didn't seem to mind, just went on making his eggs and toast, with Cas leaning onto the counter beside him, watching him.
As soon as they entered his room, Dean stoked the fire, entirely too aware of how exposed he was, crouching with his ass up in the air. It wasn't that he was scared of the Prince, exactly. He even found him kind of attractive, so this might not be the worst night in this place. But he was a Prince and Dean was afraid that he would slip up again, would make a glib comment and be punished for it. When his tongue was a little loose with a random noble, the worst he could expect was a slap in the face (though technically, that was forbidden if it wasn't consensual). But the Prince could probably fire him on the spot. Or worse.
“No need to bring Our Father into this, Dean. Though I do understand the urge to blaspheme in his name, after everything that's happened.”
“Right. Let's get you some water. Thanks, Gabe.” Dean took his arm, basically dragging Castiel back to the car.
“Oh? My mistake.” There was a trace of laughter in Cas' voice as he carded a hand through Dean's hair. Shit, that felt nice. “I suppose then I must get up alone to celebrate Christmas with everyone else.”
“Egregious!” The guy glared at Cas, but turned to leave. “How you could sink so low. I had hopes for you, nephew, but alas, it appears you have lost the last shred of-” He kept lamenting all the way to the door, but Cas just rolled his eyes and turned back towards the table.
“Of course. You are allowed to leave your rooms any time you wish. You're not an employee anymore and you're certainly not a prisoner.” Castiel frowned at him. “Wait, I almost forgot.” He went back into the rooms proper, fetching the golden bracelet from the reading table. “You should wear this. It identifies you as a Royal Companion.”
It was another winter night, spring still seeming far away. Once again, Dean stoked the fire and drew the curtains closed, ensuring as much privacy as he could. The rooms were actually well insulated, both against the cold and against sound slipping out, at least as much as could be with a simple wooden door as the only exit. Sometimes, if people got very loud in the next room, Dean could hear it, though he mostly ignored it. It was kind of embarrassing to think that people could hear him, though.
Then Cas stiffened, pushed him away a little and said his name urgently, a sure sign that there was danger nearby, probably behind Dean. He should have whirled around, should have fought or fled, but his body barely reacted, turned around oh so slowly, and before he knew it, the werewolf was almost on him. In the last moment, Cas pushed him out of the way, and Dean just so managed to catch himself on his hands. By the time he got back up, Cas had already decapitated the werewolf, but there were holes in the arm of the trench coat, blood pouring out of the bite marks where the wolves' fangs had pierced his flesh.
“Is this meant to be a labyrinth?” Dean could barely remember how many turns they had made, had difficulty figuring out in what direction the Harem was.
Dean blushed, ducking his head. He really should have expected Cas to get sappy right in some greasy burger joint in the middle of bumfuck, Kansas.
Dean regarded him with renewed interest that didn't have anything to do with his body. Yes, it was a little silly of him expect honesty from a sex worker. “You have your siblings. Don't you speak openly with them?”
“What? You will go back to going up the wall? What's next, tearing the wallpaper to shreds with your fingernails?” Prince Gabriel poked their face. They must have been really close, Dean thought, surprised. Could this be one of his siblings? Dean knew that he had several brothers and at least one sister, and he had seen one or two so far, but not this one.
“I dunno what that means,” Dean admitted, sipping his wine. “But you look good, even when you've worked yourself half to death.”
“It's that bad?” Dean asked, because he didn't know what else to say. A lot of angels had died over the last years, sure, but he had never considered that they could eventually die out. It had always seemed like Heaven had an infinite supply of angels, spewing them out and into the Winchesters' way all the time.
Castiel stayed again that night, spooning Dean from behind. When morning came, he blinked against the light filtering through the curtains, revelling in the feeling of holding Dean in his arms. Then he remembered that he had a meeting at nine and the sun was already up.
It only took about two minutes before the room was filled to the brim with people. There were Sam and their mom, Jack, Claire, Jody, and even Rowena. And then there was Eileen, who Dean had thought was supposed to be retired, or rather in hiding, but there she was, smiling at him. Out in the hall were a couple more people who didn't seem to dare come in. Dean thought he recognized some of them from apocalypse world, but he wasn't quite sure. And there was still Cas, of course, though he had retreated to Dean's desk to give everyone else the chance to welcome him back.
“I just don't want you to regret it.” Something flickered over Dean's face that might have been fear or hurt, and Castiel squeezed his hand again.
“I don't think the purpose of the show is for him to be sexy. In fact, his main characteristic seems to be that he is sarcastic.” Cas took the mushrooms that Dean had plucked off of his next slice of pizza and ate them without complaining. Dean kind of liked the taste of them on his pizza, but didn't enjoy their consistency, so he often ordered them, only to take them off.
“Ezekiel.” Castiel had noticed him in the group that had come through the bunker, of course, but he hadn't paid him much mind at the time. “I see you have already resumed your duties.”
Sometimes he could only marvel how they had gotten an angel as their best friend, as family, in the first place. And now they had a half-angel as their... well, their son. Sam certainly thought of him that way, and he was pretty sure Cas did, too. Dean too, probably, even if it had taken him a little longer to get over the fact that Jack was Lucifer's son. And he hadn't had as much time with him, considering his possession by Michael. But they could change that, give them more time together.
“We were already together before,” Castiel said, glancing at Dean to make sure it was okay to reveal this. “I'm sorry we didn't tell you before, but there was never a good occasion and... some people are... weird about these sorts of things.”
Castiel downed the rest of the bottle, water dropping off his chin, before he stopped to think about it. Now that his thirst was assuaged, his stomach was making a good argument. “I am somewhat hungry. Jack let me eat some of his Crunch Cookie Crunch, but I never took more than a handful and the last time was three weeks ago.”
When Dean hadn't come back for several minutes, Castiel went to look for him, leaving behind Sam and Eileen who were deep in a half-signed, half-whispered conversation. Castiel hadn't paid enough attention to be sure, but he thought that Eileen was trying to convey to Sam the meaning of Dean and Castiel's kiss, that it hadn't just been for tradition's sake. For some reason, Sam seemed to have trouble grasping the concept.
Cas looked at him in shock. “Uncle, contain yourself. Heavens.” He turned to Dean and the other employees at his table. “I am terribly sorry, I do believe he might be drunk-”
Sam raised an eyebrow and looked like he wanted to argue (probably along the lines of Cas not having to sleep and therefore being perfectly able to drive them back at any time of night), but before he had the chance, their mom came over.
