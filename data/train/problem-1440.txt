“I’m flying, John,” answers Harry. “it is only the road and me.”
“Yes, I was offended, I am sorry,” John mutters under his breath  and tries to avoid Sherlock’s eyes. “I saw you at the place of the crime. I was walking in the park… Occasionally passing by… I stopped to have a word with you but you even  didn’t turn your head,” John sighs as he suffers  this come- down  one more time  and then he adds, “Now I know that you just hadn’t heard me, but  that time it  was really hurt. Forgive me, please.”
“Why?” asks Sherlock firmly but quietly and stares at John’s face with his special look.
“Your face. Now.” John thinks he looks like a maniac but he can’t cope with it and examines the scratch on the left  Sherlock’s cheekbone with great expectancy.
John successfully passes his winter and moves to Sherlock just before Christmas. They celebrate the holiday together but just after twelve an Inspector Lestrade’s message  comes to Sherlock’s phone. John doesn’t want to stay alone and they arrives to the place of the crème together.
- Oh, thanks for your  is offer as inorganic chemistry wasn’t created for me.
Sherlock’s smile fades  and he looks aside.
And after this statement  they have enough forces to continue their living . They don’t discuss past  or future, Sherlock is busy with his strange and mysterious  affairs with the police  and John studies hard to become a good doctor and saves his sister but now they have a silent agreement. Certainly, John wished to have more but he can’t ask about it and tries to be satisfied with this fragile happiness . What about Sherlock – his thoughts are a big puzzle, but he looks and behaves as if everything is all right. And who is John to demand more? Especially to demand something he can be turned down? He will not overcome  this situation. His silly heart will be completely broken if Sherlock  banishes him from his sight. That’s why John lives only in the present, makes coffee for Sherlock and feeds him up with doughnuts.
“Ready,” he is proud of the result and looks at John and John sees that Sherlock’s eyes are green and grey at the same time.
But Sherlock stays and watches  John with some demands John can’t understand. All he can do us to return to finish  the making of Viennese coffee. There are too many difficulties and puzzles in his life that’s why he thinks that making some coffee is the best occupation under the present circumstances. But later his thoughts returns to the stranger and he can’t  stop the storm of ideas and suggestions which are jumping widely in his head. What links and relationships can connect such resembling and simultaneously  not resembling people. Falling asleep at dawn John prefers the variant  “lovers”,  refused ‘acquaintances” or “friends”. Certainly, there are such variants as “relatives” or “colleagues” but John finds them unbelievable doesn’t  take them into consideration. In the morning he is sure he will not see Sherlock again, but he bursts into the café with wind and fog entangled in his curls. Can’t hold his happy and foolish , John makes him coffee and adds some caramel.
“You should change the clothes and get warm, “ he says resolutely and takes John’s hand and pushes him up. John stands up and follows him and he doesn’t have any thoughts  if it good or not.
"Torre, " orders another client.
Sherlock comes  into  as if nothing had happened and meets eyes with John before occupying his favourite table near the window and talking  out his smartphone.  Relief  covers John and he can sink in this feeling. He  smiles broadly and begins to make coffee without waiting the order.  When Molly comes, he adds  a pinch of vanilla to the black coffee with sugar. Molly smiles as she understands and shares John’s sympathy to Sherlock. Everything returns to the usual and only Victor gives him piercing and unkind glances and  spits out, "Bitch! Why’s he getting around….?"
“No,” Sherlock  shakes his head and John’s heart falls down, “It’s your turn.”
Molly nods her head and returns to watching Sherlock. At last she says: "He doesn’t look at you as the queen of Britain."
And John, who usually is calm and passionless, loses his temper:"Shut up, you, idiot!"  and he turns red because he has revealed his feelings in front of this oaf.
"OK, I’m going to take his phone number, " John has a pause in his work and follows his eyes  after Victor. He watches Victor coming to the tall dark-haired guy, who is sitting at the table near the window . But the guy doesn’t see Victor as he is enthusiastically  typing in his smartphone. Molly sighs behind John.
Harry phone call is a signal of an awful catastrophe.
“Our boy has romped a lot.” Victor gives his voice behind John’s heart and John thinks how long has he been standing here, “Oh, any junkie can’t be former. I’ll leave earlier today if you aren’t against.”
John sighs and makes Americano for a pair of students.
“I really didn’t hear your words.”
-With no doubts it’s a murder, inspector, - answers Sherlock. –If only Anderson weren’t such a great idiot, he would give you the same answer. Look at the position of the corpse’s hands and nails…Most likely she went here willingly with her murder – a middle-aged man with asthma. He wears and old mac   and he has his  boots  just being repaired –he has new tips on his solves. May he is a taxi-driver or just often drives….
He take’s John’s hand and they went out into the street and this touch makes the rest of self-reliance in John’s heart believe that everything will be all right. The cab is here and John says goodbye gazing at Sherlock and trying to remember him so  well-organized, calm and confident. John really  doesn’t know, what happened, or if Harry is alive a but  a glance on Sherlock’s  passionless face makes him calmer. If he goes off into hysterics it will not help Harry anyway.  John tells the address, which said Harry,  to the cabbie and  watches Sherlock until his silhouette disappears in London’s twilights.
“Oh, no. No,” Sherlock says  quickly, hastily, taking the box away and putting the first aid on the table. “I haven’t slipped down. I was close…” he corrects himself. “I was very close. I didn’t hear you ringing. I was going to buy a doze and found you. I  felt…bad.. awful. I thought  you had some relations with that girl. I was going mad. I had to forget….” Sherlock isn’t able to speak this phrase till the end but John understand who is he speaking about. “and I was ready to return to my past…”  And he frowns and turns around. Sherlock takes his coat off and drops it on the floor, and his hands – they are so nervous and he is trying to keep them busy preparing some cotton and bandages and he doesn’t look at John. And it is nice because John has a lot of tender words not to be heard but to open his heart.
Sherlock is sitting on John’s bed and watching John taking his first-aid-kit and laying out wads of cotton wool , hydrogen peroxide, plaster…
“Well, it clearly isn’t Mrs. Winfield.”
“Hm? Oh, yes. Of course. Where did you say you were from? Oh wait, no, I know. Selkirk.”
“I dunno. I don’t think so.”
didn’t. They spoke with their actions, but Mrs. Winfield never voiced her suspicions. And neither did he. Not even to the police. If they were that upset they’d say something. But they didn’t.”
“What are you doing?”
That made John pause. That didn’t sound like Sherlock. At all. Sherlock was methodical and didn’t waste time or breath. Everything had a value and he used the least amount possible, because it was, as Sherlock put it,
“No. Never met him.”
They decided to leave as soon as possible and would arrive at some time in the evening. They might even have time to take a look around. Sherlock, for once, did the responsible thing, and asked Lestrade to tell the local police over there to expect him. John suspected he only did that because he knew it’d be the fastest way to the crime scene. He was quite frankly amazed that Sherlock had put off being dramatic for practical reasons. He’d never thought he’d see the day that Sherlock Holmes did something without infusing drama into it some way. But then again, he did seem overly excited. It had been a while and the man seemed to be happy to finally get something interesting. A murder in a locked room; it was right up his alley.
John looked up and saw Sherlock standing just behind Sam. He had a cool expression on his face, looking directly at John and completely ignoring Sam.
“Nothing. Just asked me a question. Asked me to deduce your heart.”
“Isn’t that a reasonable assumption?”
“So not Mrs. Winfield. Anyone else?”
“Yes! That’s it! They suspect one another! They think one of them did it!”
He heard Sherlock huff.
“You’ve been asleep for a while,” John pointed out. “I woke up before you. Strange that you’d sleep so well while on a case.”
John couldn’t help it; he burst out giggling and although Sherlock tried to hold on to his stern look, his mouth quivered and soon he was joining John.
“So...you think this might be a copycat or original? I mean, it seems a bit amateur to me.”
“So....”
“Mr. Holmes. It’s a pleasure,” she said politely with a small smile on her face.
“Really? You gave me a very clear impression that I am.”
“So we’re leaving now? Already?”
“Well! Well...good. I’m glad that’s settled then. No distractions.”
“Hello. How may I help you?”
Maybe it was because he couldn’t fully adapt or relax, but John knew those weren’t the true reasons. He slept in sometimes, when he was particularly exhausted after a long case, but usually he woke early and ready for the day to start. One day, he’d been sitting in his chair while Sherlock was scraping away on his violin. It was like any other day. And yet, in that one moment, for the first time, he recognized what he’d been feeling for so long: happiness. Genuine and true happiness. And this happiness is what woke him up every morning, ready for a case and a smiling madman to take him away.
“And I did rule her out on day one.”
Sherlock gave a small nod. “And do you...have a
“I have my skills, Mrs. Winfield.” John took a deep breath to prepare himself for the onslaught of deductions that were to be thrown at the poor woman, because Sherlock was a showoff and “that’s what we do, John”.
“Yes, you’re right.”
something was dropped here?”
“Well, there is her husband. And the guests.”
It took the man a second to figure out what Sherlock was saying, but once he did he got into a rage. His face turned red, his hands clenched into fists, and he practically seethed as he said, “Mr. Holmes, I don’t know what you’re implying, but if you must know, I am very loyal to my wife. I would never betray her trust.”
“Yes, Sherlock. Everyone has a type."
“Alright. Have at it then. What’d you want to ask first? Did I do it?”
“Maybe it’s just an accident,” John piped up.
. How on
He was so gone that he startled at the loud bang of the front door being shut, momentarily pausing his twisting the cigarette holder in his hand. The telltale signs of John’s footsteps squeaked out as the wooden floorboards creaked under heavy footsteps.
“So, where are we going, exactly?”
“Oh, easy? I didn’t take you for someone who liked ‘easy’.”
“Yes. Her husband leaves town and she immediately goes to visit her friend and ends up staying the night.”
It was quite large and old fashioned, but done in a Victorian style. However, it was clearly well-maintained, as all the paint jobs looked recent. The floors looked brand new and the furniture looked straight out of a home magazine Mrs. Hudson would read.
He turned to look at him, dreading it, yet still stubbornly curious to see the reaction. He was surprised to see that Sherlock was looking at John with slightly widened eyes and slowly, a small smile stretched across his mouth. It was rare that John got to see a genuine smile from Sherlock that wasn’t from simple excitement of a new or successfully solved case. And this one looked even more different; it looked like a smile he got when John managed to surprise him in some way. It’s not common, but the look of surprise on Sherlock’s face is always something that’s great to see. Especially when it’s John who put it there. Sherlock is perhaps one of the most difficult people to surprise, since he’s so good at reading other people and predicting what they’ll do. He remembered the moment at Battersea Station and his conversation with Miss Adler. Irene had asked, “Does that mean I’m special?” and John found himself echoing that sentiment from time to time. Was he special, in some way? Maybe not.
“Right. Love and hatred. Think jealousy might play a role?”
“So it’s him?”
Sherlock, of course, pouted and curled the sheets around himself. He got off the bed and stomped to his laptop, then back to the bed. He tripped and almost fell twice while doing so. John loved moments like these, seeing Sherlock act like a newborn fawn and so unlike his usual graceful self.
“Oh? You have a type?”
“Yeah Sherlock. Right here. In front of you. You alright? Did I wake you?”
His expression, however, was something to be desired. He had a sour look and seemed almost angry. But, in his defense, there was a dead woman found in his bed. John wouldn’t exactly be happy with that either. And being kicked out of your own home mustn’t feel too great.
“No, sir. We have a theory that it might be a copycat killer.”
“Of course, John! Didn’t you hear? A murder at an inn! In their personal bedroom. How wonderful!”
. And yet, here he was, asking John to say what he already knew, because…why? John didn’t know. He knew some things about Sherlock, more than other people, but he still had trouble understanding the man sometimes. Maybe he was just bored. Who knew with him?
“I don’t think Mrs. Winfield shares your views.”
“Mhmm,” he replied and went back to looking. John did the same, though he was ready to give up. He shone the torch in another direction and sure enough, he spotted something.
“Oh, well then, how do you
John felt a small pang in his chest. He never let himself believe that he was special to Sherlock. He didn’t need that particular kind of heartbreak, but Sherlock wasn’t always doing a good job of dissuading him and things were suddenly getting a bit too serious for his tastes.
“Sherlock,” John said.
“I thought the heat was mucking up your thinking?”
John glared at Sherlock. He knew exactly what his losses said about him, he just hoped that Sherlock didn’t. It wasn’t anything Sherlock had to know.
he didn’t say, but he’s pretty sure Sherlock heard it anyway. God. Did he really say all that? He really should have kept his mouth shut about it all. He’s never said as much to Sherlock before. He doesn’t really know how he’ll react. Doesn’t
“Important?”
“Stop what?”
All in all, seemed pretty decent.
“Hmm. But surely, one game of Operation isn’t above your skill? And yet, not one win. What does that say about you?”
“Or maybe a third party? Someone outside the house?”
“That does seem to be the likely case, doesn’t it. There’s no other reason for the victim to be in the room. And yet, why was she alone? Neither of the owners were there. Anyway, we’ll find out more after we speak to some of the witnesses. And we’ll have to pay Mr. Winfield a visit.”
“Ah. But it could have come from their clothing. Maybe it rubbed off his trousers.”
“Yes, but I want to hear you say it.”
John took a few notes here and there, until Sherlock felt the need to tell them what he knew.
As he slowly chewed, he thought of the previous night, after they’d arrived. The procedure was much the same as always: they both got ready for bed by performing their usual rituals of washing teeth and getting into sleepwear (or in John’s case, taking off his shirt and jeans). But, this time, Sherlock had not stayed up. Usually the man would stay up all night trying to solve the case. Other times, he’d pass out on a couch if one was in the room, or he’d go to bed at some point later in the night and when John awoke, he would be gone.
John made sure to say goodbye to the constable, as Sherlock always put that off, and followed Sherlock out. They walked down the road to their rent car, Sherlock quiet as they got in. Once the doors were locked, John immediately turned to him; he knew that the man knew more than he’d said.
“Really? I couldn’t tell.”
“You’re being sarcastic.”
As if he needed to.
While Sherlock had accompanied John to the dining room, he ran off with a few of John’s chips to do hell knows what. Probably to interrogate some people.
are.”
John let out a small laugh that Sherlock quickly shushed, but it didn’t really help him stop.
“This whole ‘I’m Sherlock Holmes and I’m a cold heartless person’. You’re a good actor, but I’m not really buying it. All I know is, you’ve got a heart, somewhere in there. I just don’t know what’s in it.”
Sherlock remained silent, still staring off into nowhere. It was usual Sherlock behavior, but John still felt somehow discomfited.
“I’m not. But, throughout my years I’ve learned that Occam’s razor applies more often than not.”
Apparently something was dropped here. John hoped it was the murder weapon; it’d make things much easier. But of course, it was never easy. Not for them, at least.
“Yes, that and the other killers either used guns or axes. This one used a knife.”
“Hello. Mind if I sit?”
John saw Sherlock finally put actual food in his mouth and left the man to it. If he didn’t eat at least half, he’d make him eat the damn food cold.
"Yes, you did."
“Are you finished with your meal? Come, John. We have someone important to meet.”
“See? This is exactly my point. How could I ask such a
“Nothing ever is. There is always room for doubt, for speculation, for error. But, looking through all the facts we do have, there is no other easier explanation for all of them.”
Sherlock let out an exasperated breath. “The girl at the front desk, Claire. Didn’t you read her name tag?”
“I saw, as we came in, that there was one empty slot in the knife holder. The rest of the kitchen was clean and well-kept, so I doubt it was simply dirty. Obviously the spot belongs to the missing murder weapon.”
That rang a bell. He sat down in his own chair and huffed out a small chuckle.
John chuckled. He
“So this one isn’t boring?” John knew the answer, but he asked just for the sake of seeing Sherlock excited.
“Yes, the doors. There’s a balcony in the room. It wasn’t locked properly. And there was a bit of mud on the floor near it. Small enough that it could have been missed. Not by me, of course.”
The woman nodded and looked at her hands folded in her lap.
“I thought I
One eye had shot open and then a head full of rowdy curls popped up.
Sherlock turned from where he was observing the balcony doors and looked at John.
“Problem?” The man asked, pausing in his fluttering and looking up at John with barely concealed excitement.
“Why are you taking an interest in another human being?”
“Hmm. I think it’s debatable. But you’re right. This was very stupid. I’m sorry, John.”
“But still, that doesn’t mean it still can’t be a copycat.”
“No, that’s your job. So, the doors?”
“Exactly. Safe to say this rules out the people who were staying in the inn.”
“So, it’s not 100%?”
“John. You never fail to surprise me. I knew, of course, the basics of it, but I hadn’t expected all that. Know that when I say this, I do so in all seriousness that you, John, are so refreshing after all the idiots I have to deal with on a constant basis.”
just be a friend, you know.”
, he would say. There were no problems at all other times, but during a case Sherlock put it off. And usually John let him, but they’ve reached a point where they would compromise. One meal per day. It seemed to work. Most of the time.
quite hot today. Hottest day in the summer, so far. He himself was wearing only a shirt and some thin sweats that he only ever wore at home, but he couldn’t bring himself to put on his jeans and he wasn’t a fan of shorts.
“Sherlock, I am not attracted to her. Just because someone stares at you doesn’t necessarily mean that they have feelings for you, alright? I was just lost in thought so it looked like I was staring.”
“I want to trust that she isn’t, but I don’t really know.”
“Come now, John. As if I would make such a silly mistake. I’d never waste one of these,” Sherlock replied, looking at John from underneath his eyelashes. John really hated it when he did that.
“I do. But cleverness...is not always for the best. Like you said, not everything has a higher purpose. Not everything is a puzzle to solve.”
him to eat. Something in Sherlock snapped like a rope being pulled tight and he immediately complied.
Sherlock groaned. “Ugh. It’s the heat. I can’t move. I can’t
“Are you sure you’re ready to settle for ‘boring’?”
overthink?
“Sorry to rush of like that, but business, you know?”
do you do it?” He said, talking around the holder.
admit out loud to anyone, ever); Mycroft didn’t need to know him on an even more…personal level. He could already see the knowing, smug smirk on his face.
“Claire,” Sherlock replied, as if that meant anything to John.
“Well, that will be for the best. It won’t be necessary for me to solve the crime, but good for the prosecutor to possess.”
“Ah, no. No, she was just a client. I’ve spoken to her maybe a handful of times.”
“Maybe someone else dropped it? You know, accidents to happen. Not everything is on purpose.”
“Well it’s not anymore. The water was relieving.”
“Sherlock?” He asked, whisper-calling him. The man didn’t stop, but made a sound that told John he was listening.
“Oh!” He exclaimed. John knew what this meant, of course. He’d been subject to those for a while now, but it seemed like prolonged exposure did not lessen the effects on John’s well-being.
“Well, my husband and I own an inn, of a sort,” the woman continued quickly. John wasn’t surprised. It was quite obvious that she was a woman of wealth. And when did he become Sherlock Holmes?
“Bad for business, that. ‘Come stay at our inn! Enjoy our nice rooms, gardens, golf course, and a chance to be murdered while you’re asleep.” John turned a page and hid his smirk with the paper. He heard Sherlock scoff out a few giggles and murmur, “terrible.”
“You said they’ve been having problems for a while now. Maybe they’re just bitter.”
“A bit hungry there, Sherlock?”
He always did that. It was sort of like their routine: Sherlock refused to eat, John basically ordered him to non verbally, Sherlock pouted and sulked for show, and then he finally ate something more substantial than biscuits.
He made a frustrated noise and shut the laptop closed. “Nothing. There are no new cases. Not even really boring ones I could solve in my sleep.”
He looked up at John and blinked. He looked off to the side and rubbed his mouth with his hand.
“I don’t know.”
“Oh?” John asked as they quietly entered the inn. It was completely silent and the front desk was empty. Usually they had someone on a night shift, but maybe they’d went to the bathroom. Either way, it was best for them if they went in unnoticed. They quietly crept up to their room. Or as quietly as they could. The inn was rather old and any step you take results in overly dramatic creaking. It felt like they were walking around a horror movie set. The only thing that dispelled that feeling a bit was the fact that it was so warm and cozy.
He sighed.
“I heard about you two from an acquaintance. The police- they’ve done what they could, but I don’t think they’re anywhere near to figuring out the case. They need help. I need help. Please.”
are ‘not quite that serious’. Clearly he’s lying. But why?”
“But she also supposedly has a lover. Why would she kill out of spite?”
“So. Sam,” Sherlock began, but honestly, he didn’t really know where to go from there.
“Mm. Oh!”
John picked up the newspaper of the day and continued reading where he’d stopped when Sherlock had decided on playing children’s board games.
John clenched his hand and brought it to his mouth. He bit on a knuckle and sighed.
“The mud was indoors. Why was it there if they came up through the balcony? Wouldn’t the killer have left their muddy shoes on the balcony?”
A couple hours later, the sky darkening and the sun going down, they arrived at a large building with a big sign on the front reading “The Morgan’s Inn”. Sherlock parked their rental and John got out to get their stuff from the trunk. He met Sherlock at the entrance and they walked into the lobby where they were greeted by a young woman at a desk. She smiled politely at them, though her gaze lingered on Sherlock a bit.
starting to get a bit dull solving the really boring ones.”
They left their dishes at the table to be picked up and put on their coats. Work awaited.
“I see. So no future ‘dates’ planned?”
“What?”
do you think that something was dropped here?” John asked.
“Well, it’s nice to know you don’t even need to try. They all just seem to
“Nope. Why do you care anyway?” John narrowed his eyes.
Sherlock only stared at him, a hint of a smile and amusement playing in his eyes.
The constable was there to greet them and lead them through the crime scene when they arrived. Under the tape and they went through the house.
When she found their information on the computer, she looked back up at Sherlock. Her face fell a bit, but she tried to maintain her professionalism by offering a polite smile. Looking briefly at John, she said, “Right. A double suite. It’s room B12, on the second floor.” That was some brow-raising information. This wasn’t exactly the first time they’d spent a night in a double, but it was still surprising for John when they did.
“You know for sure they fell? They could’ve left some other way, you know. We don’t know for sure what they used the balcony for.”
“No. I don’t know.”
John’s giggles subsided and he looked at Sherlock. It was less rare now to hear those words slip from Sherlock’s mouth than it had been at the start of their friendship. Sherlock over the years had learned the meaning of those words and also learned not to be ashamed to say them. John, of course, greatly appreciated this.
“Mhm.”
“Yes. I figured. Saw you with the tall dark-haired bloke – Mr. Holmes. It’s a pleasure.”
The man’s lips tightened and his hand clenched into a fist. He looked upset for a moment, but quickly his face changed back into an unhappy frown.
“What
Sherlock pouted, turned his nose up, and drove on in silence.
This again.
Sherlock turned and flopped down in his own chair, ultimately breaking the strange atmosphere between them. It wasn’t until Sherlock’s eyes left his own that he noticed how long he’d been staring at the man. That wasn’t normal, was it? But then again, nothing was normal about Sherlock. And yet, something felt different this time. He really didn’t want to hold onto hope, but Sherlock always made it hard. Some days John felt completely hopeless and others, like anything could happen. But nothing ever did. Apart from the usual.
flock to you.”
Sherlock drove, of course.
“Uh, yeah. Come in,” John replied, moving aside and ushering her in. He didn’t ask who she was; it was quite obvious that she was a client.
He’d gotten so lost in his search that he was startled when Sherlock flopped into the chair opposite of his.
“Yes. My name is Jackie Winfield. I know who you are, of course. After what happened, I-” the woman took a deep breath. Shockingly, Sherlock said nothing. He didn’t roll his eyes or sigh. He didn’t even bother with deductions. He usually did those to show off, but when John turned to look at the man, he was focused on the woman, listening intently. Strange.
“I suppose. If you consider murder ‘silly’.”
“Besides, she’s not even my type.” Sherlock knew that, but he wasn’t going to admit it.
“Well, it could be someone else.”
“Oh, well. I’m an avid reader of your blog, you see. I’m something of a writer myself, actually.”
one of the idiots you have to deal with.”
“Yeah,” John said, sighing.
“May we come in?” John asked. He wanted to be careful with this man. He seemed to be a nervous type.
“Well, where love is involved, hatred follows. You can’t have one without the other, unfortunately.”
John followed this woman up the stairs and into their living room, where there was a chair already in place for her. Sherlock was in his own chair, cool mask on and fingers steepled together.
This seemed to get Sherlock’s attention as he slowly turned around and looked over his shoulder at John.
“John Watson.”
“Well, it isn’t a happy occasion.”
“I see. Well, I’ve already told them everything. Don’t see why you need to see me again.”
“So now we need to look for whoever wasn’t there.”
He let this one lie.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied, putting on a quick smile. John could see through it, but then again Sherlock wasn’t trying to be genuine.
“Yes, but she could be just trying to lure you into a sense of security. Make herself out to be a victim whilst being the perpetrator.”
“I wasn’t staring.”
“No. There’s no point going out now. I wouldn’t be able to see anything in the dark anyway. I guess I’ll just have to wait for tomorrow.”
“Isn’t it hateful?” John asked, genuinely curious while still mimicking Sherlock.
The room which held the crime scene was equally beautiful. Old fashioned furniture, but newly done up walls. The floor was a dark almost black wood. The rug was unfortunately white. A nice place to live. If you ignore the blood.
His thoughts were interrupted by a loud growl. For a second John thought it had been him, but he saw that it was Sherlock. The man’s cheeks slowly tinged a light pink and his mouth smoothed into a thin line. John smirked.
“Yes, I’ve noticed the pattern. But, couldn’t the person be motivated by hatred?”
“Why do you say that? What, she came to us so you think she’s innocent?”
“So what do you think it is he’s hiding?”
“Clever, yes, but also quite foolish. She knows who I am. I wouldn’t fall for something like that. I’d figure her out very quickly.”
Oh my god, it's been forever since I've posted a chapter! I'm sorry, but I honestly got so distracted by other things, I forgot. Anyways, here's a new chapter. Hope you enjoy! Don't forget to comment and let me know what you think. Also, you can find me @lesyawrites on tumblr if you want to chat or w/e.
“Well neither do I!”
"Hmm. I don't recall."
John gave him a scolding look. “You haven’t been on again, have you?”
“Oh?” John raised his brows. He was quite intrigued. “So, do you enjoy it? My blog, I mean?”
Sherlock had to fight to keep the smile from his face.
“She was killed here, definitely. She wasn’t moved.”
“You bloody well know why, you know-it-all. You don’t have to ask.”
“Can you tell us anything else?” John asked politely.
Sherlock gave him a Look that John could barely stop from laughing at. He pouted and sniffed, very deeply offended one second, but hiding a smile the next.
She handed the keys to Sherlock. He gave her a quick smile, which she politely returned, and turned to John.
“Okay. So the killer came in a different way.”
“Do you miss it?” Sherlock asked, to stop the typing, but also mostly because he was genuinely curious.
“Is Mr. Holmes in?” she asked with a shaking voice.
“Okay. Mud. Great.”
“That’s,” Sherlock frowned, brows furrowed. He pouted again, clearly haven’t thought of that and got ahead of himself. “That could be true, I suppose. But then, how did they get up the balcony?”
we should know about?”
“Mm. No.” Sherlock was staring straight ahead, but saw John walk into the living room out of the corner of his eye.
said. But
“No need. The knife is missing.”
“Yes you were.”
“Oh? And do you believe her?”
question? If I was thinking properly, the thought wouldn’t have even crossed my mind, because it’s
“What?”
The brows came down. It seemed John didn’t need to worry; Sherlock was quite his usual charming self.
“Which are?”
Sherlock spoke up first. “I am Sherlock Holmes and this is my friend and partner, Doctor John Watson. What is your case?”
“And your wife?”
“It’s either money or love. It usually comes down to the two.”
John didn’t say anything, but smiled to himself. They sat in silence, Sherlock, clearly off into his head again and John, staring at him while he was distracted.
Sherlock stopped near John’s chair, looking down at him. John wasn’t entirely sure what to make of…all of that. What Sherlock said was just simple truth, yet it made John feel happy for some reason. Perhaps it wasn’t the words spoken, rather the way Sherlock spoke them and how he had looked while speaking them. Or maybe it was simply because Sherlock actually said, out loud, that John had saved him. He’d never really done that. Besides that, John felt as if there was more to those words than what John originally thought. He just couldn’t figure it out. Sherlock’s features were relaxed and he had a small smile on his face. John thought that he’d never looked more beautiful than in that moment.
Sherlock, for the most part, wasn’t shocked to find John with a woman. No matter where they go, it seems like John will always find one. Very convenient.
“Don’t you want to sleep? It
“Oh, I’m Sam. I’m a big fan. Of the blog and you, of course.”
“Well. Thank you,” Sherlock said, looking down. Clearly he seemed not to know what to say.
“Yeah, we’ve taken that into consideration as well. Sherlock?” John asked.
“And yes, I can be prone to being a moron from time to time. There. Are you happy now? ‘Sherlock admits that he’s actually a dumb, ignorant arse’. The world can now rejoice. The idiots can now take pleasure in me admitting it. The great Sherlock Holmes has been brought down to their abysmally low standards of intelligence.”
“Well, going by the packaging, seems like a Regal to me. I’d have to do some tests to be sure. Regardless, someone just happened to drop an unused cigarette, in a place right below the crime scene.”
He didn’t appear to hear, as he moved closer to the body, then away again. Sherlock moved about the room in his usual flurry. He bent down to examine whatever caught his eye, then moved away and took in the whole of the scene before him. His eyes shifted from one thing to another, clearly deducing and connecting the dots. He saw things that John did not; he always managed to look beyond the obvious, to find meaning in what he saw. John was getting better at it, having spent so much time with Sherlock, but still, he did not think he could solve this case as quickly as Sherlock.
Could this be their killer? He didn’t seem like one. But then again, you could never trust appearances. He acted suspiciously, but all suspects did. He’d learned over the years not to make hasty judgements.
“I always take interest in people.”
“Don’t get so impatient. You’ll figure it out.”
“Or her. I really don’t know.”
“I see. Want more?”
are not quite that serious.”
“Oh stop it,” John replied, rolling his eyes.
Now he acted as if it was some great burden, but truly he did not mind much. He simply liked the attention it got him. It felt
“Yes? What do you want? Are you with the police?” He asked, his face not fully seen as the door was opened just a bit, like he was ready to slam it shut at any moment. He seemed...anxious. But then, they must paint quite a picture: a grown man who looked about twelve and John, grinning like a maniac.
,” John replied, looking pointedly at Sherlock.
“So they came through the balcony?”
Sherlock let out an exasperated sigh that John could see in the cool air.
He got into bed and closed his eyes and tried his best to fall asleep with the knowledge that Sherlock was only a few steps away.
“An accident?” Sherlock questioned, his brows scrunched low and his eyes wide in confusion.
“Upstairs. I’ve been told the man refuses to come out of his room. Struck by grief or some such nonsense.”
“Yes.”
“I’m ready to do anything.”
“Oh. Well. Of course. She did lose a client,” Sherlock said with a small smile.
“Oh. Yes. How did you...”
“Mm. We’ll stay in touch.” At this, Mrs. Winfield gave one last goodbye to John and left the building. John turned to Sherlock who was looking over the card Mrs. Winfield gave him. The man swiftly put it into his suit pocket and looked at John.
John cleared his throat. “Sherlock?”
"Probably erased it."
While John was bustling about in the kitchen, Sherlock let himself think for a bit and imagine what it must have been like for John, out in scorching heat, trying not to die while saving someone else’s life. John in scorching heat in his uniform. Or just in his army trousers, boots, and a simple shirt. His dog tags hanging about, dangling and glistening in the sun. Sherlock sighed. The imagined sight was so magnificent. If only he could have seen the real thing. Momentarily losing his mind, he wondered if Mycroft could lend him a uniform, but quickly discarded the thought. No way was he ever asking something like that. His brother already knew him quite well (something Sherlock would
“She was pretty,” Sherlock spoke up, taking him out of his thoughts. John saw that his coat was off and he was taking a seat in the chair opposite, reminiscent of the ones back home. “If you go in for that sort of thing.”
“Yes. But how likely do you think that is? The place where we were was not a casual walking path. Besides that, they did find a footprint nearby. Well, several footprints. They all matched. I doubt it was someone random just passing by when a crime scene is right there.”
“No. Thank you.”
. It wasn’t often Sherlock felt like doing absolutely nothing. Sherlock was always doing something; if he wasn’t moving about, pacing or playing the violin, his mind was racing away with deductions about people and cases. But, at the current moment, his mind felt so sluggish that even the most basic concepts alluded him; it was torture to think about anything. He imagined this is what it felt like to be a stupid ordinary person. Little minds and little thoughts. Even his body refused to comply; it was simply too hot to walk, to sit, to move, to breathe. If he made even the smallest of movements, he was sure his skin would melt off his muscle and then the muscle would follow and John would come home to find only Sherlock’s skeleton in a bathrobe on the sofa. The Mets trying to solve the case would be a tragedy to watch and Sherlock was grateful he wouldn’t have to witness it, being dead and all. John would be sad, too. He wouldn’t want John to be sad.
“Ah, yeah. Sorry, it’s not usual we get recognized so easily. I mean, in London most people know who we are, but out here...”
Sherlock froze. His eyes did the shifty thing when he'd been caught out. "What. No I didn't."
“Nothing, just. Reminds me of something Mycroft once said.”
, John. I
“We need to expand. We can’t just focus on them two. Yes, they are the most likely suspects, but it could be someone else, someone we don’t expect. They could be hiding under our noses and we might not see them, because we’re drawing too many conclusions too quickly.”
“Well, maybe not like. You want something from her.”
“Mr. Winfield claimed that their
“Likely, but I would’ve known. There are always tells. Besides, if they let her go, she probably has a solid alibi.”
“In other words, this doesn’t seem like a grudge or revenge killing,” John replied. Sherlock stood silently, his eyes darting about.
“Are you coming?” Sherlock asked.
“Oh, um. No. No, you didn’t,” he replied, fully sitting up now and looking at John as if he’s just seen him.
Sherlock frowned. His brows furrowed but his eyes widened, clearly taking offense. “I’m not wise?”
“Yes, you clearly do.”
John gave him a puzzled look, but Sherlock only raised his brows. John let go of the case and let the man carry it up. He managed to give the girl at the front desk a small polite smile and went after Sherlock.
“But how do you know for sure that the cig belongs to the suspect?”
“Well, you know. Maybe the killer got the wrong person.”
“You were staring. I assumed you at least managed to read her name.”
. What that something was, John didn’t know. And neither did Sherlock.
“How very...logical of you. Well, this has been quite enlightening. Thank you for your time, Mr. Winfield. We’ll just be on our way.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. You’re a doctor, you should know the ins and outs of a heart.”
“No, it doesn’t. Oh, this is getting interesting.”
“People always do silly things, John. Don’t they?”
“That’s hardly relevant.”
“What about her?”
“Is there something off about it?” The constable asked.
John snorted.
“Alright,” he said, not quite alright with it, but he could drop it for now.
“Precisely. Now, people in love are usually blind and unwaveringly loyal to their partners. But look at Mr. Winfield’s response. He didn’t show much confidence in Mrs. Winfield’s fidelity. He’s doubting her. Clearly, this isn’t something that just happened. Their problems have been ongoing. But he tried to downplay it.”
“You don’t have to apologize. It wasn’t anything serious. It’s just some usual silliness. We’re both exhausted and cranky.”
“Yes! I love your stories. Are they all true?”
“That would certainly explain the closed door and how they got in. But then there’s the knife. Did they get it before hand? They must’ve. But there aren’t any tracks in the house.”
When he looked up, he saw Sherlock smirking at him.
“So he’s hiding something. And so is she.”
“That it’s a paralytic, yes, but they could be angry and hurt, so they’re taking it out on each other by blaming the other.”
“Well she spoke to one of the owners. She confirmed it.”
the middle of the night.”
“Sherlock, you know I didn’t mean it like that. I was just teasing. I know how smart and clever you are. You seem to know everything all the time. Sometimes I forget that you can be wrong, too.”
Sorry for the long wait, but life gets in the way. Hope you enjoy!
John had recently given up on any romantic endeavors; with Sherlock around, a relationship wasn’t going to happen. He was simply too devoted to the bastard to focus on anyone else. But in doing so, he also gave up a reasonable outlet for his frustrations so now he had to deal with them alone and as discreetly as possible.
“So, a dropped cigarette. Anything it can tell us?” John asked. Sherlock hummed and looked at the cigarette more closely.
like to know is why.”
“Well, the beds here are very comfortable. Besides, it’s quiet. No noise. Peaceful.”
do you think they’re hiding something?”
be something here.”
“For what?”
“Alright. So we should be looking for someone with an injury then.”
Sherlock, John saw, was in his usual blue robe. No pajamas. He hoped Sherlock was at least wearing pants. No need to ruin John’s perfectly good health. He didn’t want to have a heart attack anytime soon. Well, he didn’t want to have one at all, ever, but living with Sherlock, he’d resigned himself to the idea. Someday, sooner or later, Sherlock would do something that not even John could handle.
John walked closer to the bed where the victim lay. The victim had blonde hair and since her eyes were open, John could see they were pale and the pupils were dilated. Those details were outshone by the blood all around her. She was wearing what was once a white night shirt, but was now only a dark brown red. She was covered in multiple stab wounds. They were all in her abdomen and chest. The bloodied cloth stuck to the wounds. They were not clean cut, a bit jagged. Didn’t seem like a professional job. It was too messy. Clearly the suspect is unexperienced. The wounds were clearly from a knife. A kitchen knife, most likely.
“No one’s in the house, John. Besides, I just figured it out. The killer left through the balcony, but came in a different way.”
“Him?”
He held his hand as carefully still as possible and slowly pulled up. He was almost there when the doorbell rang quite loudly, startling him and causing him to touch the edge. The board made a buzzing noise and John cursed, “Shit!” He’d been so sure he’d get at least one right, but even this one he messed up.
“Yes.
“Right. No distractions.”
John looked up. A woman, about his age, with light brown hair and thick rimmed glasses stood smiling with her plate in her hands.
“Well why wouldn’t it?”
“I’m not actually smoking, you know,” he said somewhat petulantly, taking the holder out of his mouth.
obvious, but right now I feel like my brain is…mush. Ugh, I feel like Anderson.”
“Is she a cheat?”
“How do you know that? Can you read my thoughts now, too?”
“Ah. Right. Yeah, I’m just finishing up here,” John replied, getting up quickly and wiping his mouth with a napkin. He almost left without saying anything, but remembered Sam at the last moment.
“So, what, we have to find it now?”
“But you said-”
Sherlock, meanwhile, drove on in thought. He looked straight ahead at the road, but half his mind was on the case. He knew theorizing before he got all the facts was a terrible idea, but he was already thinking of a few possible solutions.
“Or a copycat.”
Sherlock raised a brow. “Oh? And what did he say?”
John only snorted and left it at that.
“And you, John Watson, you,” Sherlock started again, pointing the holder at John. He had moved off the couch sometime while John was deep in thought and was pacing up to John’s chair, looking intently at him. “You like danger, but you’re also a doctor. You’ve saved lives. My own included. That’s who
“Maybe. But there is still distrust there. A careful distrust. I don’t know how to explain it. I know something’s there, but I can’t figure it out. Argh.” Sherlock scrunched up his nose in frustration and ruffled his hair with his hands. He let out an exasperated sigh as he sagged back into his chair.
“I know what it sounds like, but maybe we shouldn’t jump to conclusions. Maybe we should actually speak to this friend first.”
“Yes. So the question remains: why was she here instead of her room?” Sherlock paced around, deep in thought, then stopped. He turned to look at John. “Tell me what you see,” he said, looking into John’s eyes.
. A train might have been faster, sure, but the place they were going was more secluded and would be tougher to get to.
“Sherlock- Wait, didn't you mention my 'type' earlier?”
“Maybe they didn’t want to seem suspicious. You know, if one of them blames the other, it might look like they’re just trying to pin the blame, because they’re guilty.”
Sherlock stood with a pout on his face, clearly put out at not getting the last word in. John took a great amount of satisfaction at being the one who got the last say. It almost never happened, but when it did, there was no better feeling. The only downside was watching the pout and suppressing all desire to kiss it off.
“Could be mourning his dead lover.”
“I see. And did you?”
“Oh nothing.”
“Are you some sort of DI?”
“Hey. Didn’t see you there,” he said, greeting Sherlock properly.
“Shut up.”
Sherlock, John noted, was also holding a cigarette holder and absentmindedly nibbling on the end of it. Sherlock turned his head and looked up at John. He noticed John pointedly staring at the holder and scowled.
Sherlock quickly looked at John out of the corner of his eye. He didn’t seem any different than usual. So why was Sherlock so bothered?
“She’s clearly been dead for a while now. Due to the pooling of the blood, it appears she hasn’t been moved post-mortem, so she most likely died here. The covers are ripped, so she was probably stabbed through them. Mostly likely died from blood-loss. I don’t think I need to tell you that. The wounds appear to be from a knife, most likely a kitchen knife. I’d suggest you check the ones downstairs.”
“You do know I’m not perfect. No matter how close I get, there will always be something that I’ll get wrong. There will be times when my judgement may be clouded by other things. Like curiosity or the thrill of finding out a puzzle. I may go to extreme lengths that, by some standards, are idiotic, just to find out how a murderer committed a crime and risk myself getting killed. It’s who I am.”
“Enemies?” The man exclaimed, disbelief coloring his tone and expression. “Do people actually have those?”
“Because of the doors.”
John nodded and contemplated their clues. He let out a small “huh”. Sherlock briefly turned to look at him, curious.
“Was there something you needed?” John asked before Sam could say anything else. The git didn’t need his ego inflated any more than it already is.
“Mr. Winfield.”
“Uh, what about her?” John asked as they rose up the stairs.
“You always draw conclusions quickly.”
The man was clearly upset by this.
“So you know where to go. There’s an inn close by called the Morgan’s Inn. We’re all staying there at the moment, if you’d like to stay as well.”
John watched the man.
“John. I don’t want anything from her. I don’t like her. For God’s sake, I don’t even know her!”
“They won’t stay that way for long,” Sherlock said, voice full of promise. “Maybe we won’t find anything, but if we do? It could be important.”
John had expected the man to rush up to their room without a second thought as he often did, but instead he reached for John’s case.
But strangely, they never came. All Sherlock said next was, “We’ll be there as soon as possible. Worry not, we will solve this crime swiftly and you’ll be back to your home in no time.” He gave her a smile and the woman actually smiled back. This was one of the few times that someone didn’t react to Sherlock poorly and actually managed to be kind to him.
. I can’t
“So, we have a case.”
, indeed.
Sherlock couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face, but quickly wiped it off before John could catch him. He’d done quite enough thinking and now was the time to get prepared.
“I have some fails in inorganic chemistry,”- he answers. “And  I must hand the works in till Monday. Or I’ll be given into expulsion  list.”
-If you have any problems with inorganic chemistry, I could explain some themes, just tell me, - adds Sherlock and John is puzzled what it is all about. John is thinking and Sherlock is looking at him attentively. John is eager to say “Yes, help me, please!” but his tongue doesn’t obey him  and  he can’t say a word. They are staring at each other for a long time then Sherlock winces  and bites his lip, then he turns round and is going to the exit. John desperately  looks at his back   and speaks as if a good fairy has removed the spell back and murmurs:
“Sherlock. And you are?” he drawled, a single brow raised. John just barely managed to restrain an eye roll and sighed.
“Who?”
“Well maybe
“Well, they both clearly don’t trust each other: staying away, not talking, lack of loyalty-” Sherlock stopped, his eyes widening.
No, this time the man climbed into bed right after John. Although they shared a bed a few times, this was a bit different from all the other times. He’d assumed that they’d stay quiet and pretend it wasn’t happening, but that hadn’t happened...
“Come on, up you get. Let’s get some breakfast. I’m starving.”
“Okay. But it can’t be one of them. It doesn’t make sense.”
“What does it look like I’m doing?” Sherlock asked in his “are-you-an-idiot” tone of voice.
“It’s for people to come to relax and enjoy some time off. It used to be my ancestral house, but it’s quite big and we barely used any of it. So, we’d decided to turn it into a place where people could come to stay for a while. There’s an indoor pool, there’s golf, a garden, gym, and food served by professional chefs. We offer the best we can. We’ve never had any problems. I mean, of course you’ll get a troubled client or two, but everything has always been quite fine. Until, that is, one of my clients was found dead in my and my husband’s room!” At this, Mrs. Winfield broke down, taking out a handkerchief to dry her eyes with. Sherlock leaned back into his seat and took a deep breath. He stared at some point off in the distance. Most people would look at Sherlock and think he was being rude and impatient, but John knew that he was thinking. And if he was thinking, it was a good sign that they were probably going to take on the case.
“Do you know why anyone might do this? Any enemies?”
John balked. “You?
“Perfect moment? I wouldn’t call it that, exactly, no.”
“Because of the mud, John. The mud!” he exclaimed, grabbing John by his shoulders.
“Oh, but on the contrary, John. Wouldn’t this be the perfect moment to bring them together?”
“What did I say about bitterness?”
Not for the first time, John was very exasperated. As much as he understood Sherlock, the doctor in him could not accept Sherlock making his body suffer just because he thought it somehow helped.
“Think so.” He knelt down, but didn’t touch the object. He got out a latex glove (he made sure to carry a pair now. Never knew when you needed to handle evidence) and picked up a cigarette. A new cigarette, unlit and unused.
John clenched his fist, then let go. There was no point getting annoyed; it was just Sherlock and he meant nothing by it. Still, he didn’t want to miss out on anything. He knew he was being ridiculous; Sherlock would tell him what happened and John didn’t need to be with him 24/7. Sure, Sherlock could be a bit...blunt, but he ultimately didn’t need John there.
“Some things are meant to be felt, not understood,” Sherlock said, taking off his coat and sitting down in his chair.
“Yes, it would seem so,” Sherlock replied. He steepled his fingers and looked past John.
The game of Operation was nowhere in sight.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, earning him a couple of raised brows from John. “Right after you tell us your case and we decide it’s in any way fascinating.”
John sat at the table down in the dining area. It was a bright morning and John was starving after missing dinner the other day. Across from him, Sherlock was avoiding his food by spreading it around his plate with his fork. He thought John was stupid enough to believe he was actually eating something.
“I’m Sam,” she said, extending her hand. John took it and shook.
“So, you with the police?” Mr. Winfield asked. John took out his small notebook and pen from his inside pocket.
“Do you really want to wait?” He asked as he went back to dashing about the room. “I’ve started working on a theory, but I can’t be sure, since I have nothing conclusive yet. I need more data, John!” With this, he shut his case and turned to John, ready to go.
John gave a quick nod and went after Sherlock, who was stalking away already. He glanced back only once, to see if John was actually following or not.
“Ehhh, unlikely. It’s not her.”
“Do you think they could be injured, maybe?”
“Okay. So what else have you got on them?”
"Uh-huh. Then why did you remember my type yesterday?"
He jumped out of his chair and went to his room. John looked up with puzzlement and put down the paper. He went after Sherlock, coming to stand in the doorway as he watched the madman fly about the room, gathering his things and shoving them into a case.
Sherlock grabbed his own laptop and began typing after putting the holder down. Why did he even have it?
“No, but to be struck by grief over a client?” Sherlock asked with a pointed raise of his brow.
John knew the previous conversation was over. He knew Sherlock was diverting away from it and he didn’t know what to do. Should he push? Should he let it go? It was always like this with Sherlock; he never knew his allowances. Sherlock was particular and John never wanted to make him feel any discomfort. But John knew that life barely ever allowed for comfort and sometimes people needed to be pushed beyond their limitations to reach new goals. And John’s goal was to understand Sherlock. He always thought he did, he always thought,
“Fine. I was staring. So? You think she’s pretty?”
The covers were also ripped and the bottom side of them were also stained. Clearly the suspect stabbed the victim through the covers. The body was already discolored. Her back (where it was exposed) and the back of her legs were deep red; all the blood in her body has already sunk due to gravity. When John reached out to touch her arm with a gloved hand, he could feel that her body was very stiff.
“She told me she was visiting a friend here. She was staying in a room here overnight.”
“Mm.”
John’s eyebrows rose, but Sherlock didn’t see; he was staring ahead at some fixed point with his hands steepled in front of his face in the usual fashion.
No he didn’t.
“No, he would’ve stood by his wife to keep up appearances.”
“That is a brilliant question, John. Why? Why do you miss it?”
“Angelina Marshall. Thirty six years old. She was a regular customer; came to stay almost every month. She has- had- a sort of freelance job, something on the computer, so she could afford to come up here. Didn’t seem to have conflicts with anyone. Was fairly well-liked,” the constable said.
“Hmm yes. Ugh, this case is really getting quite irritating. The solution is always something simple, but then there are all these little complications.”
John sighed. Leave it to Sherlock to make one small comment out to be a personal attack on his entire existence.
“Now why would anyone throw out a perfectly good cigarette?” Sherlock questioned, turning to smile at John.
“I am wrong sometimes.” It was said so quietly that John wasn’t sure if he actually heard it or if it was just in his head.
He got up and went to the bathroom to change for bed. When he came out, Sherlock had not moved. He sat staring straight ahead, in his own world again. John left him to it; he’d come back when he was done thinking.
“I do wonder where you get that idea. Besides, I never said it was dropped on purpose.”
John sighed in relief as he took a seat in his own chair across from Sherlock and they both turned to the woman. Underneath her coat, she wore carefully tailored clothing, the fabrics clearly more on the expensive side and not something one would own working a regular job. She also carried herself in a very careful manner that spoke of years of practice in “proper” manners. She basically screamed “old money”.
“Nope.”
“Maybe he thinks it’s private. Maybe he’s embarrassed.”
“Exactly. They must’ve. They certainly didn’t climb down; there’s not much to grab onto. They probably tried but fell. There
One night stands were an option, but John wasn’t that sort of person. As Sherlock had said, he was a romantic.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. That is physically impossible. You were staring at her and I noticed your pupils were dilated. Also, she has the typical physical characteristics of what you find attractive. She’s just your ‘type’. So, therefore, attraction.”
Mrs. Winfield looked to John and continued on. “The police came and they questioned everyone. No one can stay in the house right now, not until they’re finished with the investigation. They have everyone on record, so if anyone who’s a suspect tries to run, they’ll find them, but so far no one has gone. My husband and I are staying at an inn not too far away, along with some of my guests. I’ve been cleared to go, so I came here to ask for help.” She dabbed her eye a few times. John couldn’t help but feel sorry.
“I prefer to do my own investigations, Mr. Winfield.”
“It can’t be either of them; they both have pretty good alibis.”
“And after all this time of nothing showing up. It
“Well, you’re smart. Very smart. But wisdom? Wouldn’t say it’s your strong suit.”
“God that was the stupidest, most idiotic argument we’ve had yet.”
John, meanwhile, was trying very hard to distract himself from looking at Sherlock. Nope. He would not ogle his flat mate and best friend. That really wasn’t on.
And with that, they put the cigarette into a small plastic bag and started to quietly walk back to their inn. On the way there, John couldn’t help but to question Sherlock.
“So, this case. Any ideas?” John asked after a while. He’d left Sherlock to it, knowing the man was in his head. Instead, he’d chosen to look out at the passing scenery as they drove on. Eventually, however, the quiet became boring and John was curious.
They found their room quickly and John was relieved to finally put everything down. All he wanted to do was take a nice hot shower, eat some dinner, and doze off. But with the case going on, that probably wasn’t going to happen. For now, he took a seat in one of the chairs near the fireplace and tried to relax.
“I think we’re done here for now. Come John.”
“Why would I do that?”
“Unless they took their shoes off again. Or were an actual customer and nicked it during the day.”
Sherlock had eaten a bit more than half of what was on his plate and John sent a satisfied smile towards him. He scoffed and rolled his eyes, but John thought he caught a small smile as the man was turning away.
“Yes, I’ve thought about it, too. You see, there have been several similar murders throughout the years. A guest killed in their room. They went unsolved. It could be the same person.”
“Of course. Wait, mud? What does that have anything to do with it?”
This was going to be fun, having Sherlock only a couple inches away and having to suppress all his urges to pin the man to the bed and do terrible things to him.
John didn’t really like talking about his army days, but he could make an exception. Sherlock was different.
“Oh?”
“Yes, but in this case, I think we need to take our time.”
In the morning, John found himself waking up first for the first time ever, probably. He was used to an early schedule after the army and it had never seemed to have left him. He was always on schedule no matter how long he lived a civilian life. Well, if you want to call his life
All in all, decent.
They sat in silence for a couple of seconds, just looking at each other after having shouted like bloody five year olds at one another.
“John?” he called groggily, his voice sleep sore. John had struggled in that moment not to beam like a loon and kiss the genius with the wild hair until his head swam.
“I know for sure because I asked. While you were having your date, I went to some of the people who stayed at the inn and asked if they heard anything. One of them told me she heard a thump, but it was outside and the middle of the night so she didn’t pay it any mind. Clearly that was our suspect.”
“Oh yes. Of course.” He stepped back and opened the door wider to let John and Sherlock in.
“Well they’re not sharing the room, that’s for sure, but they could just be going through a spat. Besides, they found a body in their room. I’d say that doesn’t help anything.”
“My brother,” Sherlock replied, putting down the holder and taking the glass. The second the first drop hit his throat, Sherlock gulped everything down at once. He felt like a man in a desert who had finally stumbled upon a small oasis. He hadn’t even known he was thirsty until John offered him the water.
“Maybe. Or maybe he’s just a very good at pretending.”
John walked into the kitchen and Sherlock could hear the crinkle of plastic bags being put down. Bags? Why did John have bags? He must have asked out loud, because he heard John reply, “I went to the shop. Didn’t you hear?”
Here's the second chapter. Sorry for the long wait! Btw, i'm filllthevoidd on tumblr, so come and say hello (or scream about johnlock, whichever)
“Reservation for Holmes,” Sherlock replied in a bored tone. Sherlock looked to John and saw a confused look on his face. When John looked at him he smiled innocently and turned back to the girl. When did he even have the time to make reservations?
“Nuffing.”
“What are you scowling at now?” John said, startling him from his thoughts. He was holding a glass of water with ice, waiting for Sherlock to take it.
“Who?” John asked with confusion written on his face.
“Well. I went to the army for a reason. I went to serve and protect the country. I went so I could save lives, even though I did end up ending a few. When I was there, I was…I was surrounded by my mates. I was surrounded by chaos and misery and yet.” John cleared his throat, finding it hard to go on. He didn’t look up at Sherlock, but he could feel that intense gaze on him. “And yet, there were also a lot of good times. I loved the excitement, the danger, as you already know. When I put on my uniform, I wasn’t just John Watson anymore, I was a soldier, a doctor, a brother in arms. My plain life was left behind and I marched into battle, into the midst of chaos, because I loved it. And then I was, well, you know. And now I’m here. And it’s, well, um, it’s good. Yeah, good, but- I still miss the uniform, but that doesn’t mean I
John wakes up and he is rather cheerful and vigorous. But Sherlock is still sleeping and it seems that he didn’t move at all. It seems to John that he doesn’t breath but some moments later he hears  Sherlock’s puffing. John spends some time watching Sleeping Sherlock but then he calls himself to order as he thinks it is not right to stare at somebody who is unconscious. The point that it was exactly that he was planning to do at night doesn’t mean anything for John and he feels no embarrassment at all.  He prepares for his lectures:  takes a shower, shaves (not very carefully), get dressed, takes his note-books and manuals. Before leaving he writes a note for Sherlock to inform him that he can stay in his room and sleep as long as he wants  and  wrestles with himself as he is eager to touch Sherlock’s cheek. John warns Mike about Sherlock  during  histology  and spends  all anatomy lecture dreaming about him, tries to guess what  Sherlock is doing during physiology and misses all physics  - just tosses it off. He has to collect his thoughts during inorganic chemistry – recently  many bad memories and emotions were connected with it. John decides to cut Latin classes and runs home. By the way he goes to the canteen and buys three doughnuts and a  coffee for Sherlock. John hopes he is still there and hasn’t leave his room .O, yeah, Sherlock  is sleeping and this situation touches John a lot. He put the food  on the nearest bedside table, tears the unnecessary note and  answers Harry’s phone call. It’s not a pleasant talk as Harry is heavily drunk and she sobs and complains about her girl-friend in a tipsy voice. John understands that he has no possibility to  be in his personal heaven near sleeping Sherlock and writes one  more note for him. Than he leaves home to look for Harry  and to drag her out from the bar.
“Of course not,”  grins Victor. There are no clients in the café and he is lounging on the chair and  is playing the oracle. “ I can give you  a magic tablet.”
knits his brow (John sees this out the corner of his eye) and then he takes out not a smartphone  to answer but a little business card and gives it to John.
“you have fought,’ says Sherlock in accusatory tone  and  his thumb  tender cleans the running blood .
He offers the pill to John and a mad hope visits him that maybe it is a real solution for all his problems.
“It’s for you,” says Molly, returning John back from his trance, “ he’s  asked to tell you to sleep well at last
The fatty moves back, tring to close his pocket with his all five fingers. His cheeks are covered with cowardly sweat, his eyes are goggling at Sherlock with an animal fear, his lips are quivering.
John  Is making espresso compano when Clara, Harry’s nurse and girl-friend ,comes into the café. She is a nice girl, sincere and  careful. The best part of Clara is that she makes Harry to be happy and that’s the main reason why John doesn’t pay any attention to some familiarity, spontaneity and  assertive character. He is a patient person and tries to judge people for their deeds and ignore their faults. Clara notices John and waves her hand to him.  They are rather close and John thinks that she is one more sister for him. John comes out to give her a hello hug and have a word about Harry. They are hugging and this moment Sherlock comes into the café. John is taken in the centre of hurricane named Clara and he doesn’t see Sherlock and he has to be kissed before  leaving her strong arms. And After this damned kiss he sees Sherlock who stands still at the door having his hands in pockets and stooping. His look at John is  the same  as stormy London sky and his eyes are close to melting ice. It’s an evil look and John can easily cut of it. He has never seen such a glance before. And John  wants to return the warmth and care in Sherlock’s eyes but he completely  can’t understand about the reason for this reaction. Clara shakes John and he is out of his prostration and understands that it is jealousy. Sherlock is jealous and it means that…does it mean  that he loves him? John is afraid of saying this word but now everything is in its place. Sherlock loves him, Sherlock is jealous of his interest in Clara, It is painful  to him and John ought to explain..Just to explain…. John tries to leave Clara’s hug but this moment Sherlock turns around , opens the door and  runs out . Only the black  laps  of his coat moved the air. John runs after him, having successfully got free from Clara and cries:”Sherlock, stop! It is not what you think about! This is Clara! She is Harry’s nurse!. You’ve helped me, do you remember? They are together. She is  a lesbian. Stop, Sherlock! Stay for a moment. Don’t leave. I love you… Love you…”
“You ‘ve a large mirror behind you, John,”  he says and smiles warm and tenderly, ”You are very unobservant!” And while John is  digesting his words Sherlock asks, “May I ask you something as we are doing with some blank spots in our relationships?” John nods as he is  still shaken  and Sherlock takes this as an agreement: “What were you so offended with when you refused to make coffee for me?  Am right that you were offended?”
" Are you in habit to short-change honest citizens," the fatty man spouts insults to  John, " maybe you’re don’t have enough for the dose? And you make hay here! You’re a petty thief! Look at him! Return my money, you, milksop!"
“What do you mean? What why?” John can’t catch the idea.
As John is making coffee, Sherlock is observing him. John catches his look when he diverts his attention from coffee for a tiny moment and he answers with  timid and uncertain smile. John adds a doughnut from himself as he thinks that Sherlock must  gain some weight to be normal. Sherlock raises his eyebrows surprisingly but John frowns and shows that he insists . Sherlock sighs  heavily and takes the plate closer to him. Having paid for the order, he doesn’t leave John to take his usual place but stays at the counter and occupies the nearest stool and it is co delightful. Now John is able to look at Sherlock any time he wants  and have his attentive look as the answer. John is  jealous of  Sherlock’s smartphone as if they have found some kind of parity or balance – both of them are pretending to have Sherlock’s attention and the both  of them take the existence of each other as a given fact.
John hardly turns aside  and smiles at Victor  laughing demonstratively loudly at his words about a football match. To tell the truth John doesn’t like football, but for some reason he listens  to Victor attentively and nods, nods, nods. The wind, rushing into the café and the empty table near the window with the forgotten cup of  the coffee, which wasn’t even tasted demonstrates, that Sherlock has gone.  Molly purses her lips and John feels that he is tired badly.  Nothing  goes right  till the end of his work-shift. He makes his excuses to Molly for the cancelled going to the cinema and    escapes from his work as if it is  a prison. The whole evening he is walking about the district and he is beating  the rain without any capuche on and dreaming to catch a cold to death. And it is Sherlock’s face that he constantly has in his eyes , who watching John as if he betrayed  him. John knows that he has done everything in a right way but the heavy pain that lived in his heart, is slithering and poisoning all his chest. That moment John is the unhappiest man all over the world. And only having his face wet  because of rain,  allows himself to cry trying not to notice the tears under the rain drops. But his chest is shaken with sobs and he sensed that he is a miserable loser.
Sherlock’s  keeping silence and John makes a step back realizing one more time that he’s imagined a lot of nonsense  and trifles which can’t ever be true.
Sherlock appears in three days after Victor’s self-discharge. He is  still thin and emaciated but looks like a person being recovered  after a a grave illness. He hesitates to come into the café  and stops near the entrance  his eyes looking for John. They look at each other as two plotters and instead of going to his booth Sherlock goes  straight to the bar counter.
Without saying a word Sherlock bends his head and his nose buries right into John’s belly. That causes butterflies John’s stomach and he hopes that they will not causes a great noise and Sherlock will not hear  them and will not guess about John’s state. He smells Sherlock perfume with notes of sweat and blood, licks his lips and  carefully moves the hair on the back of the head apart and watching the ear and its little lobe he wants to bite. And John sighs concentrating on the wound. But actually its not so bad cause he was waiting to see something more frightening. Thanks God, whatever it was used by Victor to hit Sherlock, he didn’t kill him.  John  gingerly pours the wound with  hydrogen peroxide, rinsing it and stopping the blood, and watching the transparent  liquid  trickling down the long neck to the white shirt collar stained with blood red dry spots. John dries the neck  cleaning the hideous scab then he takes the wad of cotton wool and a sterile bandage and tenderly dresses Sherlock’s head. For some seconds he is slow in finishing and taking his hands away from alluring  hair but then he sets the bandage straight and pushes Sherlock away to say he has finished. Sherlock is staring at him, licking his dry lips and keeps silence.
Drunken Harry has kissed with a street lamp and if the speed hadn’t been so high,  everything would have passed without any problems. But now John isn’t told anything in the hospital, where Harry was take, and he has to listen just duty phrases that the operation is in process. John is sitting between a guy with a broken hand who is  as pale  as a sheet (he was given an analgesic but his hand wasn’t  treated yet) and a fat woman who is always snuffling. She has something wrong with her face and John is trying not to stare but reminds all  skin diseases he has learned. The  preoccupied and anxious doctors are passing by without any word and John feels his heart dying of trouble – he supposes they don’t tell him something important. It might have been the small hours of the morning when a tired doctor calls his and Harry’s surname. John runs to him and watches carefully every miming of his face (he is copying Sherlock but doesn’t understand it) and doesn’t listen his  words trying to imagine her condition due to the doctor’s face air. But  it’s high time to pull himself together and he has to ask to repeat. The doctor willingly begins his explanation one more time and doesn’t show any  negative or surprised emotions to the some kind of stupidity of his patient’s relative.  Harry’s condition can’t be named fine. She has a  cerebral injury and she is in coma now and nobody can give any guarantees that this will end well. The doctor asked if there are any her  instructions for this case but John  dashes aside. He is not ready to sentence Harry to anything without any fight. John is allowed to come into her box. Having all her hair covered with a bandage, Harry looks like a sleeping child. John sighs with relief as he is sure that this the problem Harry will be able to manage with. She has a noise and stormy youth and her head was beaten a lot of times. It’s rather  hard and strong. But in the morning he is  depressed as nothing changes and Harry is still lying without any movement.  The equipment of life support are working and sometimes a comes to get Harry on a drip. Nobody tells John to leave the box and he can’t find any force to go out. He is speaking to his sister, reminding her different funny stories from their childhood and even doesn’t  allow himself to go to the loo as it is a risk to  miss a moment of her returning to conscious. His phone is out of charge and he has forgotten his charge at home. He ought to call to the café and let them know he will not come today and say something calm to Mike Stamford who surely is in trouble about him. But John doesn’t do anything  but he is sitting near Harry, having her hand in his hands and praying, praying, praying. They are alone in this life. She is his only relative.
“Let’s go.” Sherlock  pulls him away, “let’s go”.
John nod’s as he hasn’t any forces to argue with Victor. Staying at the café alone he is still stupidly looking at the door, closed after Sherlock, mechanically washes the cup and  brushes the crumbs off. It’s high time to close the café. He must  clean the café up but John is worried. Sherlock is rather weak and John thinks that it was a bad idea let him leave alone. If John’s company is not good for Sherlock,  he had to take a cab for him. John takes off his apron, throws the towel away. He runs around the café: switches off the lights,  closes the blinds, takes off his key, calls to the security,  sets on the alarm and rushes out into the street through the private entrance and watches around for sometimes. The trouble in his heart is growing and it doesn’t give any place to John’s pain. He doesn’t know why is he so scared  and  troubled. But it seems that he follows the third force and he passes the rubbish bins and runs towards the dark lane, the place where students like to have a quick sex and junkies  have their dozes.  He hears  strange noises and scuffle. Full of the worst  forebodings,  John darts off , running to the strange sounds.
