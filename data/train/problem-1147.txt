– by an achingly familiar voice. An answer at normal volume that sent daggers through John’s head. He thought he recognised the second voice but he couldn’t be sure.
People had reacted oddly to the ‘thefts’ at first, muttering about it behind John and Sherlock’s backs. John didn’t quite understand why it was made such a big deal of, but maybe that was because he was so used to it he couldn’t see the strangeness anymore.
“Why? Why did you do that, Sherlock? Why fake your-” A pause, a hitch on the word, “-death, why leave?”
“May I ask whose jacket that is?” he asked, forgoing for now the case of international importance that he needed Sherlock to solve.
“Yeah, I know, and I’m sorry. But they need this evidence,” he told Sherlock, who just pouted harder.
Prompt: Hospital/Emergency Contact. This is basically a 5+1 of Sherlock being injured 5 times and John being injured 1 time.
Both men’s reaction to that was a beat of silence. Then John said slowly, “Bit too far, Mary,” and it set the woman off.
, didn’t mean that the anxiety – of him being gone, away from John and unable to protect him, or for John his blood being splattered on the sidewalk at Barts – that feeling didn’t just instantaneously and miraculously disappear. Sherlock’s return had been their miracle, and they weren’t going to be granted two in such a short span of time.
John sighed again even as his heart kicked up a beat fearfully at the words ‘rather deep cuts’. “I’ll be there in five minutes. Thank you.”
“What? When?” asked John, looking over at Sherlock even though the great detective was steadfastly not meeting his eyes.
Mycroft might have to upgrade their surveillance status again, if these kinds of details weren’t being picked up. After all, what use were his governmental powers if he couldn’t use them to spy on his little brother?
The last part was mumbled under his breath and was clearly bait to lure Sherlock into another one of their ‘arguments’. Sherlock knew exactly what John was doing, and he still wilfully fell for it.
“Isn’t that Doctor Watson’s book as well?” Mycroft inquired, nodding to the medical diary in Sherlock’s hand.
John remembered the next falling asleep and the next waking. Sherlock was there for both, tucked against John’s side and drifting off mid sentence in their debate about the merits of Italian cuisine, and waking up just moments after John did with a quiet yawn and a stretch before slumping back into John’s side, cold fingers curling against his shirt. Mary wasn’t there, until later when she actually was, stepping through the door to find John sitting half-up in bed and tapping out a beat on the top of the empty takeaway box as Sherlock sat opposite him, correcting the beat and explaining how it had ‘been a part of Moriarty’s elaborate game’ and that the beat was ‘eventually meaningless but nonetheless oddly catchy’.
“I am not!” Sherlock remarked indignantly, head shooting up to look between Molly and John with abject betrayal.
The detective and his blogger finally found a routine that fit them, and they never stopped using it for the rest of their lives.
stupid that they didn’t notice what was going on right in front of them. But no, nearly everyone seemed surprised every single time they heard Sherlock and John use terms of endearment with one another, even though it had been happening nearly since the very beginning.
, so John did see where she was coming from. He didn’t relate, of course. Not at all. Wasn’t in denial about his own attraction to the man. He just recognised what attraction was when he saw it.
Molly was in the midst of answering no when she looked over and noticed that Sherlock wasn’t wearing his bespoke suit for once, and was instead sporting sweatpants that she’d seen him wear on occasion and a t-shirt with the Barts logo on it.
“I’m surprised you two haven’t just put down ‘boyfriend’ and gotten it over with,” Theo commented and John spluttered for a moment.
John frowned and used the minor puzzle-solving skills he’d picked up from living with Sherlock to analyse the man. For once, Sherlock didn’t complain about the attention, his eyes slowly drifting closed again as John scanned him with trained eyes. The doctor in him – however unused to anything non-life-threatening recently – immediately picked out the symptoms. Apparent tiredness, lack of coordination, sluggish movements, eyes squinting slightly even though the sun was barely up, near-inaudible sniffles and a pink flush high on those sharp cheekbones. Sherlock hadn’t spoken yet, but when he eventually did John would bet his life savings that his voice would be hoarse.
John rapped his knuckles against the open door, not wanting to startle the nurse who was hovering near Sherlock and checking various read-outs on a nearby machine. Sherlock immediately looked up at the sound, his haggard look brightening when his eyes landed on John. John barely had time to look Sherlock over – sickly pallor, tired eyes, flattened curls, slumped posture – before the nurse turned around and promptly glared at him while John internally cursed his luck.
“Hmm? Oh, yes, you haven’t met him yet have you?” Sherlock phrased the question more like a statement as he muttered a few notes to himself while adjusting the microscope focus. When he was done he cleared his throat and continued, “Well, John’s my flatmate. Has been for about eight weeks now, I’m surprised you’ve never heard of him before.”
John shuffled closer, nudging his foot against Sherlock’s under the covers. Sherlock nudged back, shuffling in himself and throwing an arm across John’s torso. He seemed to have taken John’s nudge as the go-ahead that it really was okay for him to stay there.
“This is Theo from St. Barts Hospital again, calling about Mr Sherlock Holmes. He’s been involved in a car accident and is currently in our care. Please call back when you’re available.”
Sherlock didn’t waste a second in retorting. “I may be a high-functioning sociopath, but I do have a perfectly normal flatmate, you know.”
The anxiety would rear it’s head when Sherlock was near John but not touching him and John couldn’t feel him there anymore, he could be gone, he could be back on that pavement covered in blood or falling, falling, falling endlessly from the rooftop.
John snorted. “Predicament? Sherlock, it’s a cold for God’s sake, it won’t kill you. And the tea tastes sweet because I put honey in it. It’ll help with your throat.”
Sherlock’s slender fingers began to slip from between his own and John tightened his grip, a sudden jolt of panic shooting through him.
Okay, maybe she shouldn’t have been provoking him when he was just trying to solve this case like the rest of them. But she couldn’t help it.
On any other occasion, Molly would say Sherlock was lying – he never said sorry, not sincerely. But for John Watson, he just might, and the look on his face said that he was telling the truth.
John placed a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, shifting to look at something in front of the detective. Sherlock took a sip of his coffee, silently leaning into the touch. Both men were completely oblivious to the two stares that were practically boring holes through their heads.
John glanced back up at Sherlock, who was grinning like the madman he was. “Why are you so bloody happy?”
John tugged weakly at those fingers, smiled when Sherlock glanced up at him in surprise, pure relief shining in his eyes. Sherlock gently tugged back with a smile of his own.
John didn’t make it to the front desk that time either. The man behind it – presumably Theo – took one look at him and called, “Room 83!” across the lobby. John nodded in thanks and turned towards the stairwell.
– before deciding against it. It was probably just a slip of the tongue. Best not to mention it. Ever, ever again.
“What?” Cerise asked, evidently confused as John began to ignore her in favour of checking Sherlock over. “What do you mean, ‘Doctor’?”
“Right, then, don’t forget to call me if you need me,” he said, looking pointedly at both men since he knew Sherlock probably wouldn’t and John seemed sensible enough to do it for him.
Mary seemed to sense where his thoughts were headed, and so she turned the conversation that way too. “It must be good, having Sherlock back after so long.”
“The hound,” John managed, his terror coming back at the memory of red eyes… “I was hurt, couldn’t move, it was there, Sherlock, you were right, it was there.”
Unfortunately, even with Lestrade there, they were still having to do an unfair amount of damage control, so it was around one thirty in the bloody morning when John finally trudged upstairs. Sherlock stayed behind to have final word with Mycroft over the phone about the security of his ‘secret’ facilities, so John was alone as he changed into nightclothes and somehow mustered the energy to brush his teeth. He wasn’t alone when he walked back into their room, though – Sherlock was lying sprawled out on John’s bed in his own sleepwear. The man glanced up blearily when John walked in before face-planting back into the mattress.
Sherlock took only one sip before frowning. “John, does the common cold typically affect your tastebuds?”
John put a hand over Sherlock’s own on his knee, squeezing gently in reassurance. Sherlock took a shaky breath before continuing his tale.
Sherlock shared a look with John, and an understanding seemed to pass between them. “It’s not the smell itself, but the bad memories it sparks.”
John shrugged. “Sarah and some of the others went through a lot of effort to arrange a blind date with her and it felt mean to disregard their work. Plus, she wasn’t so bad on the first date.”
John allowed – for once – the moment, tilting his head to press his face into those curls. Sherlock’s nose was tucked against John’s neck, seeking the warmth that he insisted John emanated. ‘Conductor of light’ indeed.
“John.” Sherlock sounded like he was speaking from underwater and John belatedly realised that he’d reached out, caught the lapel of Sherlock’s coat. He watched distantly as Sherlock’s hand moved to clasp his own, those slender violinists fingers gently tugging John’s free from their death grip, one by one. He left his hand clasping John’s, though.
John managed not to panic as the cab dropped him in front of Barts and he strode through the doors. This was Sherlock. He’d been in far worse scrapes than this, and John would know – he had been present for most of them.
It took a few moments, but when the door did open it wasn’t Sherlock who stood there. It was his new flatmate, John… Watson, was it? The man was a doctor, anyway, and had been useful on the case according to Sherlock. Said he saved his life or something. Lestrade didn’t really want to get into it.
“Ah, yes, Mr Reynolds.” Sherlock paused, adjusted the focus some more and then announced, “Hated him. No, I’ve moved into a new flat, with John. Mrs Hudson, the landlady, is used to my experiments, and she’ll tell me not to burn the house down, but she knows there’s nothing she can do about them.”
John did. He stopped talking and looked at Sherlock, registering the concern and slight fear he saw in those cerulean eyes.
Sally stared and almost dropped her coffee cup. Anderson gaped open-mouthedly. Lestrade just sighed tiredly, like this was a common occurrence.
The hazy fog lifted somewhat. A cool hand on his forehead, providing a welcome contrast to the leftover heat on his skin from the fire. He knew that hand, knew it from the many other times he’d been injured.
John cleared his throat and half-smiled at Sherlock. “You will have to give that shirt back though,” he said, making Sherlock smirk and Molly giggle. Both men seemed to startle at the reminder that she was there.
John belatedly realised that he was reciprocating the touch, his own arms having wound around Sherlock’s waist without his brain ever giving them permission.
And even odder, both of them seemed to know, and neither of them seemed to care. Doctor John Watson truly was becoming the making of Mycroft’s brother, and no one could state otherwise, especially not Sherlock, quiet day or otherwise.
John chuckled, finally signing his name on the dotted line and officiating himself as Sherlock’s first contact in emergency situations. “I’ll ask when he’s less… well.” John motioned to Sherlock’s generally ruffled self. “You know what I mean.”
There, that was more fitting. He passed the clipboard back to Cerise without looking away from Sherlock and moved to help the man stand, knowing by now that Sherlock would never be able to walk out of the hospital without John supporting him.
John rolled his eyes and nodded to Theo as he stepped in to place his arm back around Sherlock’s waist, supporting the man as the walked outside and hailed a cap.
“Nope,” Sherlock replied, popping the P. “Barts said I’d filled up my quota for the month. They don’t seem to realise that I haven’t assigned myself any quotas, the imbeciles.”
John let out an oddly fond sigh before he called out to Sherlock over his shoulder, in the general direction of the laboratory. “Stop being so irritating, you git!”
Theo chuckled tiredly as John walked away. The various doctors and nurses he saw on his way to Room 83 all scattered as soon as they saw him coming. Sherlock must be moping really badly for them to all react that way, John concluded with a sigh.
much of anything beyond the fog in his head and the coolness of Sherlock’s hand where it rested just below the wound, thumb moving slowly back and forth in time with John’s pulse.
John went over to switch off the lamp and flinched slightly at the eerie shadows cast on the walls by the moonlight that filtered through the curtain. He turned and slipped between the sheets of his bed, steadfastly ignoring the way Sherlock’s head shot up beside him with a strangled noise.
“John, look at me. Eyes on me,” Sherlock said sternly and John complied, feeling oddly lightheaded and out of breath. It was only when he did properly look at Sherlock that he registered the man’s wild eyes and wilder curls, and the worried furrow to his brow.
The woman just nodded and gestured for him to follow as she led the way down long, narrow hallways. “He’s been asking for you,” she said tightly as they walked.
John moved around to the other side of the table to pass Lestrade his coffee, before placing his own cup down on the table and handing the last one to Sherlock, who took it with an distracted, “Thanks, darling.”
The front desk did sent him off in Sherlock’s direction when he got there, but they sent him to an actual room instead of a waiting area and they did so with apologetic looks, so John was understandably worried about what he was going to find as he paced down the halls to reach Sherlock.
“Yeah, I know.” That bitter tone from before crept into her voice. Odd, from what Sherlock had mentioned of her, she was apparently very amiable.
“Well. It wouldn’t have worked out anyway. You two were apparently always unhealthily attached even before the Fall.”
“Moriarty gave me a choice. Either I would kill myself, then and there, or three hired snipers would kill you, Lestrade and Mrs Hudson.” Sherlock paused there to laugh bitterly. “I‘ll confess, when Moriarty said that my friends would die, my first and only thought was for you.”
Prompt: Sherlock ‘borrowing’ *coughcough stealing cough* John’s things. Three outside POV’s – Molly in Barts lab, Lestrade on a case, Mycroft just visiting 221B. Then one inside POV from John, and a short explanation from Sherlock.
After a few moments of awkward silence, Anna cleared her throat. “There was a skeleton we were looking for. Of a woman named…” She trailed off, looking to Molly for help.
The wardrobe was the only part of John’s original room that he still used anymore, and Sherlock settled himself on the unused bed while John rooted through his clothes for something to wear. Sherlock kept his foot pressed gently against the back of John’s calf, just in case – just in case John might decide to leave or Sherlock might suddenly be back on that sidewalk in a pool of blood. They talked while John looked, easily falling back into old banter.
“Oh, right. I’m John Watson.” He nodded in Molly’s direction best he could while patching Sherlock up.
Mycroft blinked. That had been oddly honest of his brother. Although perhaps that was just John’s good influence. The doctor certainly seemed to have that kind of effect on Sherlock – Sherlock just
John did. He focused enough for some semblance of sense to return to him, focused enough that the rest of the world stared to seep back in. The concrete pavement was rough beneath his knees. Sherlock’s hands were cold over his own, but he was long used to the chill.
Reached out and managed to clumsily catch hold of a wrist. Someone’s wrist. Wasn’t sure who’s until the fabric on that wrist shifted down to reveal porcelain skin –
John hesitated in the doorway before leaving longer than he should have, Sherlock clinging on to him from behind. John allowed himself a moment – one moment, that may have bled into two – where Sherlock was here and solid and real and not going anywhere, long arms twined loosely around his neck, warm breaths puffing against his shoulder. Then he reached up to gently untangle Sherlock’s arms, said a quiet goodbye, and let go and left.
, at the absolute lunatic that was his flatmate. He knew the point Sherlock was getting at – of course he did – and he understood the feeling. After John had been injured by that Chinese smuggling gang, Sherlock had hovered around him until the injuries had healed and then some. He could have been out helping the police with catching the rest of the gang members, but instead he stayed with John.
A young woman that he faintly recognised spotted him the moment he walked in and made a beeline for him before he’d even made it to the front desk.
Molly definitely knew she was intruding and that she’d also been forgotten when Sherlock looked up at John with a borderline
“Yes, he can be, can’t he?” Molly smiled, the bitterness vanishing as she seemed to come to a decision about him.
Molly had to clear her throat several times to get her voice working. “Martha Dunn. The skeleton of Martha Dunn.”
– as he sat back in his seat, flicking his violin bow. “Thank you, Lestrade, hopefully the visit has cleared up a lot. You’ll have to skip the tea, I’m afraid, you’ve just gotten a text telling you about another case. I’d say it’s a level 3 at best, but it should occupy you for a few hours at the least.”
And John did love Mary, obviously, it was just that he loved Sherlock more. He would never admit it, of course, not even to himself – but he did know, as he had for a long time. He loved Sherlock. John had been prepared to marry Mary because he’d believed Sherlock to be dead, but once Sherlock had come back an entire world of new-old possibilities had opened back up.
John’s sense was returning enough for him to feel slightly embarrassed at the position he’d landed himself in, but he was still too shaken and tired to care. He carefully leaned into Sherlock’s touch, his lips twitching up into a small but genuine smile when the man shuffled closer.
“Best watch out, John. The thefts always start small…” she let the sentence trail off, smiling at both of them as they chuckled at her joke.
“Maybe,” Sherlock said, snapping his magnifier closed. “I’ve got everything I need. I’ll hail a cab and meet you back at the Yard-”
John perked up at that, walking over to perch himself on the arm of Sherlock’s armchair. “Is it an interesting one?”
There was no hesitation on the end of the line this time. “Yep. Mr Holmes has been asking for you. He’s had a reaction to something, it wasn’t too bad but we’re keeping him here until the toxicology screens come back.”
Sherlock softened and looked up at him apologetically. “Sorry,” he offered quietly, and the sight of the genius staring up at him with wide cerulean eyes, perfectly mussed curls, and a small and genuine smile was enough to completely melt John’s defences and his ire.
“Um, no, sorry.” Molly didn’t like dashing their hopes so quickly, but she didn’t have a choice. “Sherlock just has days where he won’t speak to anyone. John’s not an exception to that.”
“Oh, everyone needs sleep. I’m not quite sure John would appreciate you hovering anyway. I can give you a call when he wakes up.”
Sherlock frowned, apparently having forgotten that Molly had been there for that. John just nodded slowly. “Yeah, something to do with that. You’ll have to ask Sherlock about it, he knows more than I do. He’s the one who went to the pool, on his own.”
“Ah, yeah, he’s fine, he’ll be fine.” John cleared his throat to try and cover it up, but Lestrade heard the amusement in his tone plain as day. He was quickly coming to realise how alike these two were, and how much trouble it would spell for him in the future if he was going to have both of them coming to his crime scenes from now on.
“To save you,” he began, his voice unusually rough for someone the public called an ‘icy, emotionless machine’. But neither John nor Sherlock were thinking about the public in that moment. They were thinking of each other and no one else.
“I won’t,” Sherlock promised him, and Mary watched, feeling like a third wheel to her own fiancée and his best friend (technically, though, they weren’t engaged yet. Said best friend had also interrupted that).
John huffed irritatedly and reached over to pull his phone out of Sherlock’s pocket. Lestrade didn’t know why he did that – everyone else just yelled at Sherlock or gave up. John was the only person willing to get close enough to the detective to actually remove things from his pockets. Or maybe John was the only person Sherlock was willing to
“Sherlock!” Molly finally lost her temper and snapped at him. “Will you stop being so unsociable and talk?!”
It was childish, yes. And stubborn. But both men were nothing if not stubborn and shared quite a few bouts of childishness (mostly on Sherlock’s part, although John would partake occasionally). And neither of them cared in the slightest.
And even if none of that had been true, it was still true that Sherlock had stayed with him, a constant, throughout those three days. Mary hadn’t been there at all, assuming the problem would fix itself and that John wouldn’t need help, so she didn’t offer any.
To Lestrade’s shock, Sherlock immediately replied. “Many, although only one of particular interest. The shop had two copies of the book ‘Anne of Green Gables’, but only one copy was in the Classics section where it belonged. The second copy was very worn and was in the Young Adult fiction section. The binding was peeling, just enough for another cover to be visible underneath. The second book obviously wasn’t actually ‘Anne of Green Gables’ – it was a conspiracy theory book, put there as a practical joke by a group of teens. The book was picked up a young politician, born in Yorkshire and just staring his career, who was extremely angered by the stereotypes and blatant mistruths the book contained. He burned down the entire shop later that night in retaliation, not knowing that there were people inside. The murder was completely unintentional, but the arson was pre-planned and he enjoyed it very thoroughly. All you have to do is look for a man in his early twenties who is just starting out in his political career, and stayed in a hotel in Soho in the last few days. He had an affair with one of the janitors there too, if that’ll help narrow it down.”
an idiot, seeing as how he’d used the word about three times in the past twenty seconds of his mini-rant.
It was gaining, coming closer. John was so focused on the hound that he didn’t even see the rifle aiming for him or hear the gunshot as the bullet flew towards him.
Molly frowned, confused. “Why not just wear it anyway? No one else would have noticed the chlorine smell.”
“Us?” John mumbled, glancing around as much he could and catching sight of Mary hovering in the doorway. He stared at her for a few moments, brow furrowed, before his expression cleared and he muttered, “Mary.”
Sherlock didn’t answer. Sherlock hadn’t been answering for the last hour and a half. Lestrade wasn’t even sure if he was listening.
“Sherlock,” Molly said calmly for what felt like the billionth time. “What happened to the skeleton of Martha Dunn that we left in the lab?”
John gave him an unimpressed look as he finished with the bandages and moved onto the next cut. “Slipped?”
A dark corner filled with gunshots and screams and torn fabric surrounding his ruined and bloody left shoulder-
Sherlock pointed at him with an all-to-pleased expression. “You had a lunch date, but you missed it and apparently forgot all about it. That was the detail that was bugging me earlier!”
John walked slowly over to the couch and crouched down in front of Sherlock. Sherlock had his face buried in the couch cushions and didn’t look up, even when John carefully settled a hand on his shoulder.
When he walked through the doors John was glad it had only taken two minutes to get there. The tall, dark-skinned man he presumed to be Theo was sitting behind the front desk and actually sighed in relief when he saw John come in.
“Last night,” Sherlock said quietly and Molly nearly choked on her own saliva until he continued. “In the waiting room at the hospital. You were nearly asleep but I thought you heard.”
Running. Red eyes. Wet, snarling breaths. It was dusk. On a battlefield. There were soldiers running and people screaming and shots being fired, and still John ran and still the creature followed.
“Yeah, sounds like us,” he said, his voice slightly muffled, and John sighed in fond exasperation before turning back to the trio in the doorway.
Prompt: Nightmares. Set just after Dartmoor, literally their last night there in the shared hotel room. John has a nightmare, since we know he’s more prone to these things and Sherlock climbs into bed with him to keep him grounded and they just end up falling asleep like that.
Lestrade nodded, stepping aside to let him through. “Be my guest. He won’t say anything, though. Never does on his silent days.”
The thing about Sherlock was that even though he was ridiculously spontaneous and absolutely hated doing things on schedule, he was always out of bed before John was finished his morning shower. So when John exited the shower on an unusually cold September morning he was concerned by the lack of sound in the apartment. Sherlock did different things every morning, of course, but all of those things were usually loud. Whether it was the sweet lull of the violin, the clinking of beakers that signalled the start of a new experiment, or even gunshots whenever he got really bored, Sherlock was always doing
Both Sherlock and John managed a nod for Molly this time and John kept a supporting arm around Sherlock all the way to the front desk, ignoring the looks they got from various hospital staff as they passed.
On a much more macabre note, John had absolutely no clue how he was going to deal with a drugged-up Sherlock Holmes for the next who knew how long. He guessed he was just going to have to wing it.
“Um, Sherlock?” Sherlock sighed again but nodded for her to continue. “Didn’t you say your landlord hated it when you left experiments at home?”
“Sherlock, you’re not sleeping there,” he said, tone trying for firm but just sounding exhausted instead.
John was about to turn back to his own conversation when Sherlock’s index finger traced gently down the inside of John’s palm. John snapped his eyes ahead even as he squeezed Sherlock’s hand, getting another gentle trail in return.
Sherlock just sniffed quietly in response and made to turn his face back into the cushions, but John stopped him with a gentle hand to the forehead. “Hang on, let me check something.”
It wasn’t a question, not really, and so John didn’t answer. Mary nodded slowly to herself, still looking at John, then at Sherlock, then back at John.
subtle with her hints for him to go. Maybe what little John had told her about him was right, maybe he was just that oblivious.
Sherlock there with him. Sherlock reached back to switch off the light before settling beside John hesitantly.
to know this,” he stressed, watching as Sherlock paced the room in front of him. “If you remember any of the book titles, then you need to tell us what they were.”
Hands settled on his shoulders and the touch had John taking a shaky, gasping breath because it proved Sherlock was
’ under his breath while Molly silently let out a breath of relief. Forget his usual icy exterior, Sherlock could be downright terrifying when he wanted to.
Lestrade was somewhat used to Sherlock’s quiet days. He’d show up, look at the crime scene, run off after the suspect and return them to the Yard, all in complete silence. He wouldn’t say a word to anyone, and while that was normally fine it was decidedly bad when they needed specific information.
He held back until Mary was finished. Didn’t remember where he’d found the strength, since the little strength he had left was most definitely waning at that point.
John walked in with an armful of coffee cups, just catching the end of the conversation. “So is ‘tyrant’, apparently,” he commented as he passed two of the takeaway cups to Anders and Sally.
Sherlock relaxed when it was apparent she’d gotten her information from normal sources and started casually correcting her as he returned to his experiment. “It’s texting, Molly, not ‘typing to’ and Lestrade is a Detective Inspector, not Chief Detective.” He proceeded to mutter something like ‘
“Hey, is that John’s phone?” he called over, frowning as Sherlock turned to him with a somewhat sheepish expression.
“Why do you talk back to him on your quiet days?” Mycroft asked Sherlock, ignoring John for the moment.
Well that wouldn’t do. John was already overthinking and seeing every shadow on the wall as the shadow of a hound, and Sherlock had removed his anchoring touch on John’s cheeks.
Mary made Sherlock remove his hands so she could do the stitches and John managed not to react to the anchoring touch disappearing beyond the slight twitch to his fingers. But every time the needle punctured skin it felt like a hot poker being jabbed into his head. The longer it went on, the more he wanted Sherlock’s cool touch back.
The man in question laughed, turning to look him dead in the eye. “John, we fight criminals and get shot at on an almost day-to-day basis. I wouldn’t call that lucky.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes fondly. “You still don’t need to be sorry about the bookshop case. It’s fine.”
Detective Inspector Lestrade had meant to follow up on the taxi driver case in the few days after the ordeal. But an influx of cases came in so he had to postpone his visit to 221B for quite a while. He even missed out on the interesting-sounding case of the Chinese smugglers a few months later. But the cases finally slowed down and he was able to take an afternoon ‘off’ to go ask Sherlock about their mysterious shooter from the taxi driver case, and also apparently from this Chinese case since the ringleader had been found shot dead in a hotel room not far from where the cabbie had been killed.
John didn’t quite know why he hadn’t seen the original confirmation as a go-ahead, but then Sherlock had always focused less on words and more on the actions that revealed a person’s true intent. Or maybe the detective was just as tired as John, which was more likely judging by his already half-closed eyes and slowing breathing.
“Sign these then you can leave,” she snapped at them. “The breaks aren’t too bad, and downstairs office has already scheduled weekly appointments for them to check up on your cast.”
John glanced into the room behind him with an oddly fond expression before looking back to Lestrade. “Yep. Sherlock healed it.”
John didn’t know how he would be able to fall asleep like that – with a soaring heart, an armful of genius and a mop of soft curls tickling his nose – but for once he didn’t give a damn.
Lestrade tuned out as Sherlock started prattling on about gravel and pavement differences. He knew that John and Sherlock were flatmates, he knew they were
“You two seem used to this. The kidnappings, I mean,” she commented as John’s eyes finally closed and his breathing immediately evened out. His grip on Sherlock’s wrist relaxed somewhat, but he didn’t let go completely and Sherlock didn’t make him.
“You’ve mention.” Sherlock laughed at his surprised look. “Come on, John, after three days drugged up and alone with me you think you didn’t mention it at least once?”
“Alright, Sherlock, time to go,” he said, placing a hand on the man’s shoulder as he stared at the linoleum floor. “Sherlock?”
Sherlock had gotten so used to John’s presence that he felt disjointed when the doctor wasn’t there. So he ‘stole’ things to try and fill the void, things that reminded him of John.
Mary gave herself a moment to process the miniature speech she’d gotten in return for a simple remark. “Right, sorry, you said
Molly scaled the staircase to 221B, Lestrade and John’s girlfriend – Mary? – following close behind. The landlady had let them in with a smile and an “I’m surprised you didn’t pop by to see them sooner,” before wandering into the back. Molly didn’t know who ‘them’ was supposed to refer to, but judging by the slightly sour look on Mary’s face and the worried look on Lestrade’s, it couldn’t be good.
“John,” Sherlock spoke slowly, “the hound isn’t real. It never was. It was a trick, a hallucination. We’ve put an end to everything. You’re right here, with me, not on a battlefield.
And Sherlock was there, alive and breathing, half curled up in his armchair with his face buried in the Union Jack pillow. He looked up when John entered, his lips forming the man’s name even though John couldn’t hear it over the ringing in his ears. He stumbled over to stand in front of Sherlock, taking him in and hoping that he wasn’t just dreaming and
John gave them all one last friendly smile before heading off after Sherlock, leaving an entire Research team and one shell-shocked Molly Hooper gaping in his wake.
John just sighed, long used to Sherlock’s non-existent sleep schedule. And when Sherlock stretched out across the couch and put his head in John’s lap, John didn’t comment. He just smiled to himself and silently twisted dark curls between his fingers.
, matted with blood; a blog counter stuck on a number that wasn’t a clue; a pale, cold wrist with no pulse. Sherlock was there, cool fingers brushing back John’s sweaty hair and murmuring soothingly, quietly, to calm him down. Mary was not there, having taken over John’s evening shift at the surgery.
“Isn’t he that detective from the blog?” one of Anna’s colleagues asked. “Surely he’ll speak to Doctor Watson, if we call him.”
Sherlock checked his watch again. A whole hour had come and gone since he’d arrived – if this was anyone else he’d deem it not worth the trouble or the boring wait, but this was
Once they were done and ready to leave Sherlock made to reach out but hesitated. John huffed a fond sigh and held out his arms. Sherlock brightened immediately and carefully wrapped an arm around John, tugging him gently to his feet.
“Idiot is a term of endearment, if you must know,” Sherlock muttered, clearly distracted as he shifted different photographs and newspaper clippings around on the tabletop.
The man wrinkled up his nose and shrugged, the first sign that he was actually listening to John – for once.
It took three days for the drugs to run their course completely. John’s recollection was slightly blurred but he still remembered most of what had happened.
A very familiar mop of dark curls. A very, very familiar mop of dark curls that almost looked like they belonged to someone who’d been dead for the last twenty-one months.
She frowned slightly, then smiled again as the group turned a corner. “Since it’s been four days since our last date, I figured I’d take you on another one. Are you free tonight?”
“I’d have to disagree,” Mary said from behind Sherlock, and he very nearly jumped. He’d been too preoccupied with John to care about the witnesses crowding behind them, panicking at the fact that they’d nearly set a man on fire.
Mycroft started briefly as John turned back to him before managing to compose himself. “My apologies, but I didn’t know you could make Sherlock speak on his quiet days.”
“Ah, yes, John this is Molly, one of my lab partners,” Sherlock said offhandedly, his eyes focusing on the floor as he began mumbling things about his experiment.
“Yeah, I am,” John answered, wondering when on earth Sherlock had found the time to put down John as his flatmate in his medical files. “I’ll be there in about ten minutes.”
The first time John Watson was called as Sherlock Holmes’s emergency contact was the first time he knew he had the job. He was in the middle of dinner with his latest girlfriend, Emily, when it happened, and he apologised profusely while accepting the call from the unknown number.
“There’s definitely such a thing,” Sherlock countered, preparing to go into a lecture on the harmful effects of rosin dust.
Lestrade scaled the stairs, nodding to the landlady in thanks for letting him in. Upstairs, the violin could be heard playing before it abruptly stopped when Lestrade reached the top of the stairs. He gave himself one breath of fortification, since dealing with Sherlock was never easy even on a good day, and then knocked on the door.
“Yeah you are,” John chuckled, finishing up on the final cut on his temple and smoothing his thumb over it gently before stepping back and peeling off his surgical gloves. “Now come on, you idiot, let’s go home before you hurt yourself again.”
John smirked slightly as he shut the door behind him. He had to violently suppress the urge to take out his phone and start filming – he knew Sherlock would get a hold of it later and delete it, so the memory would have to do.
“I’ve got to do those stitches,” Mary said to Sherlock, and John didn’t bother asking what she meant. He’d already clocked the warm and slightly sticky spot on his temple to be a head wound. It didn’t
Sally was busy trying to decipher Sherlock’s super fast ramblings, but not too busy to hear John’s dazed laugh. “Sherlock, that’s brilliant, you madman!”
Molly froze, her eyes widening as her mouth fell open. A sweetheart? Had Sherlock just called another human being a
“Oi,” John said sternly. “I had to cancel on Mike for the third time this week to come here and get you. Don’t be a git.”
John managed to open them halfway, and was content to leave it at that. There was a slight furrow in Sherlock’s brow as he looked back at him. A woman was hovering behind his shoulder and John had to focus for a moment to recognise her as Mary – her features still weren’t as familiar to him as Sherlock’s. He could pick Sherlock out of a crowd while he was blindfolded, but Mary was newer and so her plain light hair and dark eyes weren’t as familiar as the wild, dark curls and intelligent cerulean eyes that John could place blind, deaf and at the end of the bloody world.
“Don’t tell me,” John said, so used to their terms of endearment that he didn’t even react. “Tell Barts.”
Sherlock finally moved. He shuffled over to the side slightly and John thought he was getting off to go to his own bed, but then he stopped and just stayed there.
Sarah, of all people, walked into view with a clipboard full of paperwork. “For you to sign,” she said, noticing where his gaze had gone. “They just need your signature to confirm you as his emergency contact, and so that they can legally discharge your flatmate here.”
“It’s not like I’m a child in need of distracting,” he huffed, flipping through the papers but barely registering the printed words. It was still too early for this, but he was getting bored so he’d deal with it.
Another irritated sign. “They’re not dangerous, Molly. Potentially hazardous, yes, but not dangerous.”
Molly was hovering near Sherlock as he peered through his microscope at different samples of blood and bone dust. It was ridiculous, that she couldn’t work up the nerve to ask this one simple question, but then again… well, it was Sherlock. She never had any clue as to how he would react to these types of things.
It dissolved into a bit of a blur after that, but there were two moments that both men would remember for years after. The first one was the moment that John’s knuckles connected with Sherlock’s jaw, and the second one was the moment immediately after when he crashed into Sherlock and clung to him, one hand fisted in the lapel of the ever-present coat and the other tight around his waist. Sherlock clung back just as tightly, pressing them together until there was no space left keeping them apart.
a rebound, and she always had been. John had been at his second absolute low point when he’d met her – the first being that first month after Sherlock had died. She’d been a way of clawing himself out of the darkness and pretending to once again have a purpose. But John’s purpose had always been clear to him when he was at Sherlock’s side, and only then.
“They won’t listen,” Sherlock muttered stroppily, flopping down into his armchair. “Any interesting cases?”
John smirked slightly, concluding that the injury couldn’t be that bad if Sherlock was still able to hold up his aloof persona. Cerise sniffed indignantly and left the room under the pretence of making copies of some paperwork. The second she stepped out of the door Sherlock’s entire demeanour changed. He slumped forwards into John, leaning his head against the man’s stomach with a quiet whine.
, John shot back, debating on whether or not to tell him about Sherlock’s cold. He decided against it as he poured the tea and stirred a spoonful of honey into Sherlock’s cup. He then balanced a cup in each hand and made his way back to the couch.
“What?” John rubbed the bridge of his nose, hoping beyond hope that Sherlock wasn’t about to launch into a case while he was sick. “What are you talking about?”
’ Sherlock contemplated the stray thought for a moment, then banished it. It didn’t matter. All that mattered was that John was
“The Black Lotus were that Chinese smuggling gang from a few weeks back. General Shan was their… ringleader?” John glanced to Sherlock for conformation and he shrugged. “Something like that. Detective Inspector Dimmock told us she’d been found dead a few days ago.”
“Hello, you madman,” John returned fondly as he stepped over and stood close enough to Sherlock that the man was forced to look up to meet his eyes. “What happened to you?”
“I’ll see you tomorrow, Mary,” he promised before turning away and starting down the path into the graveyard. It was a testament to Sherlock’s current mental state that he didn’t even file away the woman’s name before going after John.
There. That was more accurate anyway, or at least it felt like it since he was having to haul Sherlock’s injured self out of hospital again.
The first few hours after they returned to Baker Street were the strangest. They both did their best to recount what had happened while they’d been apart, and John got angry enough to nearly hit something when Sherlock told him about what had happened just days ago in Serbia. The only thing that placated the doctor was the promise that he could look over the wounds later and the knowledge that Sherlock was
Pale fingers loosen their grip around John’s wrists as Sherlock’s processes that for a moment. “Oh, John,” he said in a low, comforting murmur. “I could never live without you either.”
John just sighed and turned to face Sherlock. In the darkness of the room his curls looked wilder, his eyes seemed darker and his lashes cast impossibly long shadows over those cheekbones.
“It wasn’t much of a choice, not really. There was hope, for just a minute, when Moriarty slipped up and made me realise he had a code word to call off the killers.” Another shaky inhale. “Then he shot himself in the head. I’d underestimated how far he was willing to go to destroy me. Mycroft swooped in last-moment and promised to help pull some strings to arrange my fake death. I’d already arranged most of the details earlier, I just hadn’t thought we were going to need to go through with it. It was supposed to be a backup plan, nothing more. There was one big mistake, though. You weren’t supposed to have to watch. I never wanted to put you through that, John, and I promise you that it will never happen again.”
Although she’d promised to talk John around and stop them arguing, she knew that letting Sherlock Holmes into her and John’s life would be a big mistake. One day, John was going to have to be forced to make a choice between Sherlock or Mary, and Mary didn’t like her chances.
Sherlock listened especially attentively. He asked a few extra questions while John changed back into his normal clothes and out of the hospital gown he’d been put into. John reached a bit of a loss when he got to his jumper, realising that he wouldn’t quite be able to manoeuvre it over his injured shoulder by himself.
Both of them looked completely star-struck. Lestrade still didn’t know how either of them did it – Sherlock dealing with people talking to him when he just wanted to be silent and John somehow managing to make Sherlock want to talk – and he honestly didn’t want to find out.
Note: apologies it took me so long to get this done, but I’m posting two chapters tonight to make up for it :) Thank you all who kudos and comment, the appreciation keeps me going!
Sherlock hummed as John helped him to his feet. “M’kay, love,” he managed, swaying slightly on his feet. John stepped in to wrap a steadying arm around his waist, nodding at a shell-shocked Sarah as they passed her on their way to the door. He knew why she was shocked, obviously, but both John and Sherlock slipped up on occasion and instead of saying ‘git’ or ‘idiot’ they’d say ‘love’ or ‘darling’. He wasn’t going to draw extra attention to it by mentioning it – he was just going to carefully review the moment before filing it away with his other precious memories.
Sally whacked Anderson on the arm, prompting him to close his mouth. They both turned to look incredulously at Lestrade, who sighed and made a ‘leave it’ gesture.
Except, since Sherlock didn’t have a bed and wouldn’t sleep on the couch due to the broken heating, he had to sleep in John’s bed. And he kept stealing the sheets.
. He’d waited nearly two years for Sherlock to come back, and so a few hours were the very least the detective could do in return.
“Course,” he replied, readying himself for another while of having to look after an injured Sherlock. He didn’t mind the looking after as much anymore. John did wish Sherlock wouldn’t get injured so often, though. He had to take care of the madman enough normally, and adding an injury to the mix just made it unnecessarily difficult.
John nodded silently and Sherlock smiled gratefully in return before turning to leave and gesturing for John to follow.
“Yeah, he’s here.” John stepped aside and Lestrade noticed that his cane was gone. Before he could stop himself he nodded down at the man’s leg.
Mary just watched with a half-morbid, half-fascinated gaze as Sherlock spouted deductions, and Sherlock just continued tapping his fingertips against various parts of John’s head. Once he was apparently satisfied with whatever he was doing, he moved to straighten but stopped when John’s hand shot out surprisingly quickly and latched onto his wrist.
Not just another human being, even, his own flatmate! Sherlock was a notoriously hard person to live with and even in the small fantasies of domestic bliss that Molly sometimes allowed herself, she never imagined actually living with Sherlock. Too many angry landlords had come to Barts looking for him for Molly to even
Prompt: Terms of Endearment. Basically just John and Sherlock insulting each other/accidentally using ‘real’ terms of endearment.
Sherlock huffed annoyedly and fell silent, most definitely pouting. Mycroft watched the entire affair with amusement and a hint of intrigue. It was very interesting that John could somehow prompt a response from Sherlock when no one else could. Even more interesting, the man didn’t seem to use the talent very often, instead letting Sherlock have his silences when he wanted them.
There was a brief hesitation on the other side of the line, followed by, “Hello again, Doctor Watson. Yes, Mr Holmes is faring fine, although he woke up just a few minutes ago and was asking for you.”
Watson,” Sherlock stressed, leaning into John’s hand as he rested it against Sherlock’s forehead. “His name is
Sherlock huffed under his breath as he buttoned his shirt, mumbling something about idiocy being a label used by idiots. Although by that logic Sherlock
“Thank you,” he managed to mumble after another few moments. Sherlock just nodded, hands moving to clasp John’s wrists between them. They were standing almost nose to nose, nearly but not quite breathing the same air.
“Nothing too bad.” Sherlock gave him an I’m-not-impressed-or-buying-this look and John relented. “Mary mentioned The Fall during dinner.”
he and Sherlock were safe, even without opening his eyes. He could feel Sherlock’s chest rising and falling against his own, knew that he was breathing and alive and therefore safe, knew that they were there together and therefore not on a battlefield in the middle of a war.
John couldn’t help but chuckle at his flatmate’s sudden unusually tired manner. “Yep, it’s me. It’s time to go home now, okay?”
Molly screamed. And then immediately apologised. Lestrade mumbled something under his breath, flat-out staring at the pair at the desk, who simply stared back. The only person who didn’t seem shell-shocked was Mary, who was simply looking back and forth between them all with mild confusion.
John kind of couldn’t blame Cross Keys for trying to give them only one bed. This was far preferable to waking up at two in the morning with nightmares and being unable to fall back asleep. At least this way John
The third time John got the call, he let it ring through to voicemail because he thought it was a nurse whom he’d just broken up with. The voice message told him otherwise, though.
“You can open your eyes now, John,” came the low murmur of Sherlock’s voice. “We’ve turned off the lights.”
Sherlock hummed, taking another sip of his tea. His brow furrowed, and he almost looked like he was analysing the taste.
“I know, they said over the phone,” John told her, barely catching the sharp turn she made into a room on their right. He stepped in after her to see Sherlock sitting on a gurney again, his shirt unbuttoned to reveal a rather nasty gash going perpendicular just over his collarbone. He perked up when John walked in, although there was a noticeable pallor to his skin.
Lestrade was the second person to witness it. He was out on a case, watching Sherlock scuttle around the scene like some kind of demented spider, when he spotted something odd.
Sherlock did a double-take, looking at her like she was completely thick before seeming to remember that she was the sort-of-fiancée to his best friend. “When I say
“It is of international importance,” Mycroft told him, pulling himself up to full height. “And you, Sherlock Holmes, will
“Well, if you’re flat-sharing then wouldn’t he mind if the kitchen table was covered in dangerous experiments?”
So Molly just shook her head, turned and left, but not before contemplating the possible, ah, attachment Sherlock might have formed to his new flatmate.
John laughed from over by the car and the reality hit Sherlock like a lightning bolt. He had been gone for nearly two years. John had believed him dead for
In that singular moment they were whole for the first time in nearly two years, two broken beings who’d found their way back to their other halves. There were still things to talk about – Mary, the fall, the time apart, the faked death and the twenty-one months of separation and lies – but the only words the two shared were mumbled apologies and quiet repetitions of each other’s names.
’. And Sherlock would reach out and let his fingers clasp desperately around John’s wrist in a silent plea for him to stay.
Sherlock snorted under his breath. “If by ‘not always’ you mean every single time, then yes, you’re spot on.”
Mrs Hudson would’ve been surprised if she’d had the chance to. But as it were, both John and Sherlock showing up on the doorstep of 221 clinging to one another with tear tracks on their faces was enough to snap her out of her surprise and into worried-mother-mode. She ushered them both inside, started a fire, made tea and steadfastly didn’t mention the way John and Sherlock both didn’t separate the entire time, sitting so close together on the couch that they were pressed together from shoulder to knee.
beneath their interactions. They fit together seamlessly and seemed to fall back into one another’s presence easily, instantaneously, despite the two years apart. There was
“We can assure you, the killer of General Shan is not the same person who killed the taxi driver,” Sherlock informed him, biting his lip subtly to keep from laughing again. “I know the killer of the cabbie personally, and I can assure you that the murder was a one-off. The shooter was merely stepping in, in the only way possible, to save my life.”
The restaurant was fancy, the food was nice, and the company was okay. Mary spun tales of the patients that had come in while he’d been on leave and John smiled and tried his best to pay attention. He liked Mary, he really did, she was nice and when Sherlock was gone she’d helped take his mind off things. But now Sherlock was back and John was sorely missing cold fingers and wild curls, the gentle contact that confirmed Sherlock was still there and not about to disappear at any moment.
John set the kettle to boil and grabbed his phone while waiting. Two missed texts, both from Lestrade asking if they were holding up okay.
John didn’t know he was there – of course he didn’t – but Sherlock knew John well enough to know that he’d turned visiting Sherlock’s grave into a weekly habit. Only this time, John was late.
John looked to Lestrade for help in telling Anderson to step down. But Lestrade was nodding along. “I’m with him on this one. This is a triple murder case, some arsonist burned down a bookshop with people still in it because of something they hated about the shop. We need to know everything we can about the bookshop where it happened, and we’ve not got much to go on since everything’s been burnt to rubble. Sherlock saw the shop before it was set on fire, and I’ve been asking him about the book titles for the last hour, and he hasn’t said anything! And I mean
The common denominator was quickly found to be touch. If John’s shoulder was pressed against Sherlock’s while they made the tea then Sherlock knew he was there and had no intention of leaving. And if Sherlock’s hand remained on John’s shoulder while he typed out an email then John knew he was there and not on a blood-covered sidewalk outside the hospital. All they had to do was maintain physical contact, at all times. Overlooking one small disagreement about which bed they’d sleep in – because of course they slept together, how else would they stop the nightmares? – aside from that, it was all fine. Any outsider would say it was easier than expected, but it was really just another layer to John and Sherlock’s friendship, and not even a completely foreign one at that. Touch had always been welcomed before, it just hadn’t been as necessary then as it was now.
But there was a difference between seeing and knowing something, and actually experiencing it firsthand. Sherlock’s chest rose and fell from where it was pressed against John’s, the genius shuffling even closer in search of warmth. He had one arm slung around John’s back and his long legs tangled with John’s own beneath the covers.
John closed his eyes with a sigh, honestly not even bothered to correct another ex about the fact that
John was already in a cab at that point and wasn’t surprised that Sherlock had been asking for him if the detective was being kept waiting. Sherlock
Sherlock and John walked them all home after tea, upon the unanimous agreement that fresh air would do everyone good. As they walked, Molly began to ask Sherlock questions about how he’d gotten the other body out of Barts morgue – since he hadn’t asked her for help – and Lestrade joined in after realising the further potential for trouble Sherlock had if he really did know how to break and enter and then exit with a dead body.
,” John whispered, taking another breath of him, knowing he was there and he was staying but needing to say it anyway. Just in case he didn’t know, somehow.
“Yes, what about him?” Sherlock mumbled, clearly not paying full attention to her. That was fine. Sherlock didn’t pay full attention to anyone.
Of course the nurse tending to Sherlock would be Cerise, the ex-girlfriend he’d broke up with just a few hours ago.
,” the man drawled, looking deliberately at where there were still holes in the wall from the last time Sherlock had gotten bored. “Me, Mrs Hudson and the wall would beg to differ, love.”
As Lestrade groaned and began writing down as much as he could remember, he caught sight of John and Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. Sherlock had stopped pouting and was smiling up at John, who was laughing at something.
‘Okay, yeah, but we broke up just a few hours ago on the grounds that I spent to much time on cases with you, and then I immediately show up at hospital to get you. What exactly is she supposed to think of that?” John mumbled while flipping through to the last form. It was his emergency contact sheet again, and another alteration had been made.
After another moment of silence, John just smiled, feeling Sherlock’s lips curl into a mirrored smile against his shoulder, and said, “I know.” Because he did, and so did Sherlock. They were unhealthily attached, completely codependent and their separation anxiety probably would end up killing them.
“Where are you going?” called Sherlock hoarsely from the couch, a tinge of panic creeping into his voice.
“The ambulance is nearly here,” Sherlock whispered, thumbs rubbing over John’s knuckles as he clasped his calloused hands between Sherlock’s cold ones. “You’ll be alright.”
“Don’t know. You’ll have to ask him.” She nodded at Sherlock, perched on the edge of the bed and staring back at them with a slightly vacant expression.
A slow breath, then another, then they both turned to face the door. A silent agreement seemed to already be forming between them that they would do this together, this and everything else. They’d only been separated for all of twenty minutes but it had been unbearable. If that was what separation would be like from then on, so be it. They’d just never separate.
“John, I need you to look at me.” John struggled but managed to comply, his gaze finding worried ocean eyes. “That’s it. Just keep your eyes fixed on me.”
“Will you be alright?” she asked, and Sherlock wrinkled his nose at her tone as he added something to his mental dossier. Clingy.
“I managed to find a decent show, actually,” he said while flicking through the channels. John shot him an incredulous look.
“John?” Mary said quietly and the man in question looked up, the movement followed by the person plastered to his back.
Mary just glanced back and forth between them for a few moments before taking a shaky breath. “Right. So that’s it, then.”
’, Sherlock would never ignore him. Even in the middle of a heated argument they’d temporarily break off the feud to recite takeaway orders or discuss whose turn it was to make the tea.
“Wasn’t a blow,” Sherlock mumbled, fingers hovering over various parts of John’s head. “Or, well, it was a blow that caused the cut, but it wasn’t the blow that caused the disorientation. He’s been drugged, don’t know how or what with. Judging by the fact that the kidnapper led us to him it won’t have been anything fatal or overly harmful. Just something that would keep him unconscious and disoriented for however long was needed, or possibly for longer since it seemed our kidnapper had every intention of leaving him there to die. It wouldn’t quite have mattered if the drug kept him confused for twenty hours instead of two, since they were planning on him being dead before long.”
He felt the impact of the shot in his leg, though, and he fell to the ground, pain blossoming from the wound as the beast came closer.
Lestrade just sighed and left them to it. If John had stuck around as Sherlock’s flatmate for this long then he was sure he’d be able to manage the man alone by now. Although, their earlier bantering had been a little odd. They’d insulted one another
There was a pause. A few moments passed before Sherlock spoke up. “I will admit,” he said haltingly, “I didn’t actually expect you to do this.”
Lestrade wandered over to the desk that Sally and Anderson were standing at. “Alright, please tell me one of you took notes on all that?”
really was what John was addicted to, she didn’t want any part of it. She wanted John in her life in a normal capacity, as her normal husband, and she wanted things to continue progressing in the way that they had been before Sherlock had unceremoniously crashed back into both of their lives.
“I, um, I just hear you talking to him on the phone whenever you actually, you know, call someone instead of typing to them. And that Chief Detective mentioned his name when you came in to examine a body a few days ago.”
John remembered waking up late at night, dizzy but better, better enough to acknowledge his hunger and thirst over the pounding in his head. Sherlock was there, easing him back against the headboard of the bed and bringing him water –
Sherlock coughed quietly into his tea, and that was all the answer John needed. “Wow, you must be the luckiest person alive to not have caught it before now,” he commented, sipping his own tea and steadfastly ignoring the way Sherlock was leaning more and more into him with each passing moment.
John carefully shifted away from Mary’s arm, heaving a silent sigh when the warmth was gone. He’d then looked up to find Sherlock gazing back at him tiredly with an oddly open look on his face. The eye contact held for one moment, two, and then John’s lips were quirking up and Sherlock’s were doing the same and they were both trying not to laugh in the eerily silent night. Mary blearily raising her head sobered them up slightly, although the persistent smile tugging at John’s mouth didn’t seem to want to go away. A cold finger traced his palm before Sherlock smiled at him and closed his eyes.
