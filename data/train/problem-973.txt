Fawnlock's hand slid from John's neck into his hair, gripping lightly, as the other hand slipped to the waistband of John's trousers. He made a soft sound, tugging slightly at the trousers, wanting to feel more of John's bare skin, intense heat welling up inside him. He broke the kiss for air, ears flicking, and panting slighty as he buried his damp nose into John's neck nuzzling and nipping slightly at his heated skin.
The fawn reached out to pluck a biscuit from the platter the elder Fea'd set them on, not denying that partial truth. His ears twitched, and he gave and appetitive bleat, Mrs. Hudson spotted Moosecroft standing in the doorway right behind John, she smiled fondly.
Tossing a pat of butter into the pan, it sizzled away as John cracked eggs into the skillet, followed by tomato slices and half a can of baked beans. The bread he set in the oven to toast, and while it was all cooking away, he finished off the cup of tea with Fawnlock's favored sweeteners and milk, than brought it over to his mate with some tablets of paracetamol. Fawnlock lowered his book when he peered over its edge and saw John coming over with the pills and a cup of tea
"There's a cloak around somewhere, it's like the one Moosecroft was wearing when he came before. Our maman had them made for one of our portraits together." He murmured softly, "It's thick and should keep you warm."
"There, it should hold a good few handfuls of berries." The pouch sized similarly to one of the fawn's large hands.
Fawnlock's words made him flush deeply, and John sighed happily, turning his head slightly so he could press kisses to the side of the fawn's face, up into his hair and around the base of his antlers.
"M-Mycroft Holmes." He takes Greg's hand and shakes it, shocked at his stutter. How did he have this effect on him? He didn't even hear his brother respond as he talks to Greg.
Sherlock eagerly peers through the telescope, a small smile paints his tiny lips as he spots the planet.
Sherlock looks up to their mother, "We're spending the weekend, you asked us to after school ended." He looks to his older brother with panicked eyes, why didn't mummy remember?
"Of course cuddles. As many as you can take." He kissed the center of the fawn's head, Fawnlock smiles at John's promise for cuddles, the all too familiar rumbling starting up in his chest as the man then moved away to make a fresh cup of tea with extra honey in it to chase away the taste of the pills.
Sherlock frowns, "Sugar only." Their mother gives him a look, Sherlock corrects himself with a roll of his eyes, "Please."
John smiled happily at the nuzzle and compliment, kissing the fawn's cheek before he turned to go pick up his pack and pull it onto his back.
John grabs their plant from the back room, it is just sprouting up from the soil, its growth charting stick right next to it. The people who they were supposed to be assigned to, complained and they were luckily paired together.
Fawnlock huffed his appreciation as John heard his silent plea with slight amusement, causing the fawn to give a minuscule pout as John undid his jeans for the fawn. He'd sat up for John, his eyes staying on his mate's hands as they pulled away from his jeans, the fawn took up the skillful hands in his larger ones, leaning forward slightly, he brought them to his mouth, so he could kiss each knuckle and finger before flipping the hands palm up to press warm kisses over the expanse of John's calloused hands.
John finds himself still holding Greg's hand, clutching Sherlock's fingers until they reach the library and sit in their own area.
Sherlock follows the older boy, gripping his hand, "I like purple, but daffodils don't grow to be purple, but I like yellow too, like bees."
"/Fine, I suppose it could be useful, as long as it isn't Anderfawn, he's an idiot, and I don't want him in my wood./" The younger Fae grumbled softly in his native tongue.
Sherlock smiles, "It was okay, I guess, we had to leave early, Mummy didn't feel well." He pouts slightly, rubbing his chin against Bilbo's fluff.
John's eyes widened just slightly with the rumbling. Call him slow, but he was starting to notice it kicked up when they got rather intimate. Fawnlock always seemed happy when he was, for lack of a better word for it, purring. So obviously John was doing something good.
"What are you talking about?  Sherlock and I are friends! Best Friends!"  John feels scared, his sister never gets this drunk.  He looks to Sherlock for help.
'It's like Harry says, I screw up everything... that's why I don't have friends... Not long before Sherlock changes his mind.'
He bit his lip gently, John's lips brushing his pulse point causing him to bleat softly, muffled slightly. The fawn squirmed slightly, only to settle once more, John's lips tickled slightly, but Fawnlock liked it.
As he moved, John butted his head gently at the hand in his hair, reassuring the fae that his grip wasn't bothering him at all, and in fact, he rather liked the desperate tugs. He hummed around the underside of the fawn's prick, the sound vibrating down through the twitching flesh weighing heavy on his tongue. He was determined to live up to his promise and make sure Fawnlock felt good, amazing even. And if all the noises his mate was making was any indication, he was doing a fairly decent job of it.
As they make their way down the beach an older girl comes towards them with an angry look, "John! Where have you been! I've been looking for you everywhere!" She shouts. Sherlock stops dead and tilts his head at the girl, so this is John's older sister. John visible shrinks, his smile disappearing from his face and bows his head.
"Here is your second surprise, Sherlock," he hands over the box, watching with a small smile as he waits for Sherlock to open the box. John watches excitedly.
"I'm Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock wrings out the hem of his tee shirt, "my brother and I are here on vacation as well." His gaze narrows slightly as he looks back up to John, "You don't like it here very much, you're bored.." He deduces quietly, "Though you still think it's pretty, you don't have much to do." It wasn't the hardest to figure out, John was an easy read so far. John blushes and looks away. How did he know that?
"I can start building you a nest so you can be more comfortable. You can pick out which bedding you like best." John set his tea down and then placed the newly empty hand over Fawnlock's on his thigh, stroking the back of it. The fawn gave a soft huff, turning to face John with a small smile. He leant into the human's hand and nuzzled into John's palm with his damp nose.
"Yeah, see you Mycroft! Don't be late to your next lesson, kay?" He smiles before moving back down the hall, making his way to his next lesson.
The elder Fae tittered softly with a small smile on her lips, "Aren't you two a pair?" She chuckled, returning John's hug. "It's alright dear, our Prince needs you."
His arms opened up to welcome his mate back up as he wriggled a slow path of kisses upwards, closing down around his slim waist to tangle above the flicking tail. He would have never been able to tell Fawnlock had only began kissing days ago, because the way he claimed John's mouth was glorious, those lips simply made to be worshiped like this.
John moved in close so he could watch the fawn write, eyes following the tip of the graphite across the page. It felt a little odd, a man as old as he being taught to write and read. But it wasn't as if he were challenged or an idiot, he was learning an entirely new language. He had to keep reminding himself of that.
John grinned wide at the claim of perfection, knowing it wasn't the mound of blankets itself the other was referring to. He let himself be tugged down, stretching out onto the piled blankets beside the fawn.  While interior decoration may have not been his forte, he was hoping pleasing Fawnlock would become his best skill, since every smile and kiss was an amazing reward. John rolled over to hold himself above the fae, staring down at him with complete adoration before he sank down and kissed him, the hand not supporting his weight slinking down Fawnlock's side, tracing over every curve of muscle till it came to rest on his hip.
"Coming Sherlock!" Mycroft follows after his baby brother. Although he is a bit tired, he loved being there for Sherlock.
He pulled the fae's hand up and kissed the back of it, then stepped ahead and tugged the fawn after him.
John grinned at that, he rather liked seeing the fawn in his clothing as well. There was something very intimate about a lover sharing your clothing. But this was even more. They were two completely different creatures, yet John was somehow good enough, had somehow managed to be the one Fawnlock wanted.
John watched the fawn's reaction to the petting, because honestly that's really what it was, and couldn't help but smile with how much the Fae seemed to like the touch. It was almost catlike how he leaned into the touch and butted against John's hand. But there was nothing feline about those ears, and John didn't think for one second that Fawnlock was like a pet. He grinned and scritched for a few moments longer before moving the hand up further through Fawnlock's inky curls, feathering through them until he came to the base of the antlers. There was a very thin layer of velvet over the bone, and he traced his fingers over it, smoothing up towards the arching prongs. It was dense, but almost spongy, not yet hardened for the winter. He felt that if he pushed his nail into it, it could have left a bit of a mark. Not that he would of course, John was just mentally calculating the density. Finger curled around the antler and stroked back down to the base. The tips were very sharp and dangerous looking, but also had a hint of fragility to them. It was very awe inspiring, and John had never felt so privileged in his life, to be able to touch such a magnificent creature like this.
"It's really easiest just to sop it all up with the bits of toast," he explained, doing just that by scooping beans and egg onto a corner of the bread, then taking a bite and chewing around a grin.
Fawnlock took up a few biscuits and started to nibble a bit, before dunking a biscuit in his tea and eating it that way, leaning back into his mate as he munched.
As they walked, John began pointing to trees, naming whichever ones he could and finding out those he didn't by way of Fawnlock's extensive knowledge of his home. He wanted to know their names in his mate's native tongue as well, and flicked his tongue between lips as he tried to say it for himself, no doubt horribly butchering the language, but attempting it none the less.
"Sure, why not." Mycroft smiles, wanting them to get the most out of this. It is impressive to have two young boys were thrilled about learning, more so than watching mind-numbingly stupid cartoons.
And so, he had found himself spending more time wandering through the woods that surrounded the cottage, taking a new path every day and exploring the world that had swallowed him up in its arms. He was making a mental map of the paths that took him to groves with bushes of edible berries, or which creeks had the best yield of fish. What he foraged supplemented his stock from town quite nicely, and soon he had even purchased seeds and began to cultivate a garden of vegetables and fruits to lessen the amount of trips he had to take into town. There was a good deal of books in the cottage that taught him about the plant and animal life in the forest as well, and with the basic knowledge, he felt confident to branch his wanderings out further and further, always returning before the sun sank over the trees.
John sighs and his shoulders slump... He and Sherlock would always be different - the outcasts and the freaks, wouldn't they?
As Fawnlock spoke, John chuckled and pet the fawn's back with soft strokes. "Sharing each other's clothing now. You wearing jumpers, me with your cloak. I'll look like a proper bit of the forest." He wrapped his arms tighter around Fawnlock, snuggling against him for the last few moments they had before he had to leave. His mate was the best at keeping him warm anyways.
The fawn gave a soft huff at John's teasing, ears dropping slightly. A pout formed on the fawn's lips, but as John's lips met his, Fawnlock's ears perked back up. The Fae decided to try and take John's lead in the kiss, nuzzling softly against John's cheek with his slightly damp nose, leaning close to his human. His tail flicked slightly as he tried to lean up into John's finger buried into his curls.
"Boys can have sleep overs too!" He says, looking up through his bangs, squeezing Sherlock's hand tighter.
"Pirates!? That would be fun! We can search for buried treasure, wear pirate hats and eye patches! Argh!" John laughs and refocuses on scrubbing under his finger nails.
John was hardly upset, but he happily accepted the reassuring nuzzle all the same. He just wanted to be part of the conversation that was about his life after all. "I never meant to upset Mousey, I just wanted to nip her affections in the bud before they grew more, before she got hurt, emotionally and complicated things. I don't do well with emotions, you know..." The Fea trailed off before he stopped at the opening of the clearing of John's cottage, staring up at the night sky.
"I love bees... he's cute." John says petting the soft plush bee in Sherlock's hands, rememboring when he was hiding it from him at the beach house. "Wait... you like Lord of the Rings?"  He asks, suddenly realizing the name, eyes widen excitedly.
As the fawn moved closer, John closed his eyes, feeling the tickle of soft fur and wet nose slid against his jaw. He heard Fawnlock inhale, and his hand moved to slide around the fae's waist.
Once it was pulled away, John dropped his arms to circle around his mate, embracing him tightly and nuzzling at his face and hair. The Fae had nuzzled into the slight softness of John's belly until his mate started to bring him up so they were at level.
"Figures that when I try to teach you how to make a proper nest this happens. We christened it before it was even finished." He spoke softly, and amused light in his eyes and ears flicking in good humor.
"Yes...soon. And when you come back, you'll have me all to yourself in your den." John bit his lip to tamp down the grin that threatened to spread over his face. He tugged Fawnlock towards the leather flap, then gave him a little push. Then very softly, as if still worried he sounded a bit ridiculous. "I'll be here waiting for you, my love."
Dust, unsettled from the young Fae's actions danced in the air, moving in gentle, lazy patterns through the air. Fawnlock's nose twitched with the dust as he padded back to his mate's side with a small grin. He plopped down quite ungracefully beside John and dumped the books carefully into their side by side laps. The rumble grew louder in his chest as he sifted through the reading material, finally his dark hand closed over a spine and he handed the dusty time to John.
Fawnlock wanted to scoff but thought better, his gaze flicked over his brother, taking in his appearance, and his slight weight gain, the young Fae's lips twitched up slightly in a badly concealed smirk. It seemed kinghood had treated Moosecroft well, mostly, he took in the slightly fatigued air that lingered over his brother.
John had been curled up in their nest, thumbing through a book while he waited for Fawnlock to return from the gate. The hour came and went, and he was steadily growing more nervous. Eventually he heard the noise of stumbling feet outside in the garden, and then after that, the bleat that was most definitely his mate, and definitely one of pain.
Sherlock smiles, "Nuh-uh, it means I get to wear the eye patch!" He moves to a drawer in the small library's desk and pulls out the black eye patch before putting it on with a devious smile.
Mycroft is walking down the hall, reading his notes from his previous class, a technique he learned to ensure memorization. He looks up, seeing Greg Lestrade at his locker. He smiles to himself and looks down at his notes again.
The fawn smiled at John's reassuring words, ears flicking as his mate's fingers brushed his velvety ears when he ran them through Fawnlock's curls. The Fae bleated softly in thanks when John brought some books to the nest's edge for him, he watched John move away and start to prepare his pack.
"Yea, I really like the doctor, he's amazing you know."  He picks up his sonic screwdriver and turns it on so it is a torch and then clicks it off again.  "Remember when I brought this to our first sleep over?"
Fawnlock moved to pull out a chair from the table for his brother and sat down himself, "Moosecroft, sit," he left a chair pulled out next to him for John.
"Excited little ones, aren't they?" Mrs. Watson says, just looking at the art and following the boys.
He nuzzles his nose into John's hair. After a bit, he pulls away, "I'll check and see if it's safe." He stands and quietly moves to open the door.
"You're the most adorable, lovely thing I've ever laid eyes on," he said softly, kneeling down just enough to they were face to face. "I do anything you wanted, you know? I'm hopeless for you." He was quite sure the fawn already knew it, but some things were nice to be said out loud. Kissing his mate on the cheek.
Mycroft carries his brother to his room and settles him into bed to wait for John. Sherlock curls up on his bed, gripping his stuffed bee as Mycroft handed it to him. He snores softly, murmuring sleepily occasionally.
He drew back just long enough as Fawnlock expectedly bucked up, and he set his other hand down on the hip to maintain a bit of control. With a soothing hum, John slid down again, this tip licking from tip, down to the circle of his fingers at the base.
John brightened at the prospect. Exploring with Fawnlock not only meant that he'd have a wonderful , no, the ultimate guide to the forest. But then he'd get to spend more time with the fawn himself. "I'd like that a lot." He said quickly, taking both of the fawn's hands up in his and squeezing gently. As Fawnlock promised to never let anything hurt John, he felt a sad tug in his chest. He couldn't promise the same thing, he had broken that promise on their first meeting. At least he could spend everyday making it up to the fawn. "You'll never be lonely again." He promised, tugging on Fawnlock's hands till his pale gaze dropped back down and he could see the determination in John's eyes.
Deft fingers and dark palms skimmed over John's body once more until they stilled at John's hips, rubbing soft, delicate patterns into the heated flesh. The Fae then let his fingers defy lower, pulling away minutely from their kiss to breath, panting softly.
A millennia? Okay yeah, that definitely should have been enough time. John realized how many of his life times had blinked by for the fawn. And how many more would zip past. It was immensely sobering. He stared up at Fawnlock and frowned slightly. "Well, there is no accounting for taste." He took hold of the offered hand and pulled himself up, though had rather liked laying in the grass under the arch. Dropping his hands to dust leaves from his jeans, he then readjusted his pack and gave one last lingering look to the gate. "Alright. Let's go see your tree."
"Prince?" John's voice cracked just a bit as he called after her. His brows furrowed in confusion and shock. Was Fawnlock a Prince? Oh god, did he just abduct royalty into his house and then spend the evening poking and prodding at him and serving him pasta for dinner? John felt the world spin around him, and was more than grateful when Mrs. Hudson lead him to the sofa so he could sit. John nervously ran his hands through his hair, smoothing it down straight and neat. Suddenly, he sat up straight, hands curled on his knees. "I, yes please, thank you Mrs. Hudson. That would be wonderful." He flashed her another smile and tapped his fingers along the seams of his jeans.
After a few minutes as they're walking out the high school he speaks, "You like him.." He states plainly, smirking when John giggles at his comment and squeezes his hand.
John listened to Fawnlock's theories, nodding as he put together things for their lunch. That made sense, since it was the fae himself John was connected to. Maybe through understanding Fawnlock, he would learn to speak and read the language as well. His mate seemed absolutely thrilled with this new development, and John was glad to be the source of something that made him so happy. John went down to the cellar and fished out another bag for Fawnlock, helping him strap it on his shoulders in a way that wouldn't aggravate his wounds.
The fawn smiled softly as John twined their fingers, his ears twitched as he spoke, "I can do so if you'd like, it's a simple spell, easy to perform." He padded down one of the deer trails, keeping an eye out, while still paying attention to the human.
The fawn gave a fond smile as he took the shampoo and he fiddled with the cap, smiling sheepishly as his mate helped him with it. The Fae turned in John's lap, folding his legs on either side of John's thighs. He squirted a dollop into his dark palm, rubbing the soup in his palms he moved to lather the shampoo through John's short sand hair.
The fawn's ears flicked back and forth as he listened to his mate speak in his language, the corners of his Cupid bow lips quirk up in a pleasant smile. Fawnlock bleated softly at the barrage of kisses, and cheeky tail grab.
The corners of Fawnlock's lips quirked up in a small smile as John spoke. His ears flicked as he lifted their intertwined hands to his mouth, brushing his lips over John's knuckles. The Fae's eyes stayed steady on his mate as he pulled back once more with a soft grin on his Cupid bow lips.
The fawn turned back to John, rubbing at his arm where the one falcon's talons had dug into it. John watched the bird flap away in a flurry of dark wings, then walked up to Fawnlock's side, reaching out and taking his arm delicately, inspecting the indentations and punctures that the raptor had left in it's wake. Nothing too deep, just a surface scratch. Still, he glared up at the birds, then reached up and cupped Fawnlock's cheeks, rubbing them gently with his thumbs to calm the fae down.
"You both should come inside...it's chilly out here." He leaned up and nosed against Fawnlock's cheek, then tugged him towards Mrs. Hudson's cottage. He threw a look over his shoulder at Moosecroft, barely hiding a grin.
"Look!" John immediately finds Venus, it is only visible to the naked eye at dusk. "Right there." He points, smiling. He wants to look at it through the telescope.
"O-Okay Captain!" John sniffles and swallows hard, forcing his tears down and smiles a watery smile as Sherlock touches his face.  He, in turn, wipes Sherlock's tears.
"Very good. Great. Amazing." The hand in Fawnlock's hair moved to cup his dappled cheek, thumbing over the thin fur there and feeling the warm skin beneath. Fawnlock hummed a pleasant sound softly, cuddling close to John, a soft smile curving his lips at his mate's words.
Sherlock raises his brows, a lopsided smile playing over his tiny cupid bow lips, "That's the most likely outcome. No one else can stand me like you can, John. That's why you're my one and only and best friend." He hums softly after that, gaze searching the room.
Sherlock nods, letting John lead him back into his room. They enter; Sherlock perching on the edge of John's bed, picking up his journal from where he'd left it. He opens his journal and starts doodling in the margins of a page.
"Oh... Winston will be wondering where I am..." Mycroft digs into his pocket and quickly sends a text to Winston on his mobile, hoping he'd not been waiting too long. At least Sherlock shouldn't be too upset, seeing as John comes over nearly every day after school.
"Oh, I remember you Mycroft, but yes, please call me Mrs. Watson." The doctor reintroduces herself, her son running up from behind her.
"I'm the lucky one. I'm just an ordinary army doctor. You are the brilliant one." He swept his thumb over a high cheekbone. "You are so precious to me. I love you." He leaned down and kissed the fawn softly, then moved back to gather up more gauze to clean the side of his head, pushing back the blood matted curls. Fawnlock smiled a soft, small smile, blushing lightly at John's praise. He bleated softly, leaning up into John's kiss.
Fawnlock gently nosed under John's ear, before nipping at the skin softly. The fawn's gaze met with John's and his lips curled slightly in an almost there smile for John, he let his hands be a little less light, a bit less gentle, now more bold. The Fae made a small soft noise in his throat, moving to kiss a line down John's throat. He was insistent with these kisses, nipping lightly at John's heated flesh as his ears flicked. The fawn's exploring hands moved over his mate's body, trying to learn it, memorize what made John gasp, writhe, grip the Fae tighter. Fawnlock's tail swished behind his in pleasure, the fawn pressing as close as he could. He began to kiss across John's collarbones, nipping at the warm flesh, warms bubbling inside as another smile stole across Fawnlock's lips.
The Fae wrapped the jumper in his arms, knowing he'd be unable to put the jumper on without his mate's assistance, and he crawled back into the warm nest to wait patiently for John so he could help him and then snuggle together.
"The blessing from the courted's family," he said softly, "In your position, that'd be Moosecroft, but- though it's custom, it doesn't have to be him, we-we could ask Mrs. Hudson instead."
"/Fawnlock./" He supplied in return, a single sculpted eyebrow lifting skyward.  "/To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?/" Though he knew, he always knew. But he so preferred to hear his brother say it for himself.
The Fae snuffled softly, hips grinding down into John a tad lazily, relishing in the friction between them as well as the tenderness and warmth of the countless kisses pressed to the side of his face and head. The fawn's dusky hands move, one up to stroke over the shoulder his chin isn't settled upon, as the other skimmed over John's ribs and side to firmly grip his hip, speckled digits stroking swirls into the warm flesh there.
Sherlock carefully handles the box, setting it softly on the ground before he opens it. Inside reveals a little chocolate colored ball of velvety fur, the ball unfurls, revealing a twitching pink nose and whiskers. A soft smile curls Sherlock's lips in a lopsided grin.
Sherlock shrugs, "I don't know, I've gone almost to the top before, but Winston came out to stop me last time I tried, maybe a little over half way?" He starts to climb up the tree with a grace that a seven-year-old shouldn't possess, "This tree's really tall, it's a great view wherever."
"We should do things like this more often, John thrives on the attention of his friends." Mrs. Watson makes conversation.
The fawn let out another whimper as he rutted into his mate's palm. Fawnlock murmured softly in his native tongue, giving a moan as John hand curled around him and stroked, the fawn panted softly, "John, d-do that again, please."
"What was that, love?" He asked softly, pressing his lips against the long stretch of neck as he spoke, kissing the steady beat of the fawn's pulse.
"If you want me to stay, we'll have to wait till winter comes and the veil freezes over, though." He murmured softly, "But still, I'd like to." Fawnlock turned to face the human and took his other hand as well, interlacing their fingers and rubbing his thumb over John's knuckles.
"No, I don't... I don't want to eat right now."  John takes Sherlock's hand and clutches it tightly.
"Of course, you earned!" Mycroft presses another kiss to Sherlock's cheek and then puts him down, ushering him into the limo. "Winston's already packed out bags, let's go."
John woke, surprisingly, not to a wet nose pressed to his throat, but rather a mop of curls tucked under his chin. Once he was a tad more awake, he also noticed the curve of a pert bottom pressed back against him, and gave an approvingly hum as he rolled closer to it, tucking an arm around it's owner's waist.
Unfortunately, it will only be for part of the summer, at least Sherlock will experience what it is like to have a real friend.
The older teen nods, chuckling softly, he guesses even teenage geniuses have messy bedrooms; this somehow comforts him.
"And honestly, it's a bit hot." He paused, searching for a word Fawnlock would better understand. "Arousing. Exciting." He slid his under arm up across the Fawn's side.
John brought over a tray filed with cups of tea, his and Sherlock prepared as they both liked, and cream sugar and honey in little pots so Moosecroft could make his cuppa how he liked. There was also a plate of the biscuits from Mrs. Hudson.
"Oh? Slumber party? I thought that was for girls? " Harry teases, though she loved the idea of having the room to herself... Stacy is very cute and very interested in her. John blushes and looks down.
It was wonderful to not only have his hands buried in his mate's hair, but to have his gasping and arching in pleasure from such a simple gesture. He doubted anyone else had ever been allowed this close before, and perhaps John was a bit smug over being the sole person to ever draw these sort of reactions from the fawn.
John shrinks a little in his seat, shifting closer to Sherlock unconsciously. He always felt safer with him close.
His ears twitched, "Just a tad sore." He mumbles softly, he blinked a few times before he tilts his head, minding his antlers, he huffs softly. "Once my antlers drop, cuddles will be much easier, and more... 'fun'... among other things." A smirk curled his lips.
"/I went into a bit of a sulk after that, but then Moosecroft left to discover the human world, and came back with a violin, a very old one mind you, but with some magic it was good as new. I loved it, adored my brother to no end after that. He'd gotten some beginners compositions, he knew I was clever enough to figure most of playing myself, with some assistance, I was playing like I had done so my whole life./" He grinned softly, but then it turned sad as he spoke once more, "It hurt me tremendously when after all the adoration I'd given him over this violin, he'd send me away a several years later.."
"The house driver and butler. He helps to take care of my brother and myself." He answers smiling up at Greg once he'd gotten a confirmation text. He asks that he be told of Sherlock's status.
It was a beautiful thing to watch, Fawnlock so absolutely absorbed in one thing that he became one with it. John wondered if that's what they looked like when they were together. One.
Fawnlock let out another whimper as his mate began to stroke his velvety hip, he gasped slightly at the feel of John nosing at the thick curls at his groin. The Fae bleated softly as he felt his mate's lips pressing softly to his heated and very interested prick.
No wonder Fawnlock was so fascinated. He dipped his head in polite greeting. A King who had no cause to bow to anyone, yet he tilted his head to acknowledge this mate his brother had chosen.
As the kisses moved up his neck and jawline, he lazily pet the fawn's tangled curls, dragging his fingers through them with such reverence.
The fawn threw his head back as he felt the molten coil in his stomach tighten and tighten, surges of delicious pleasure washed over the fawn's delicate body. He tried to thrust shallowly into John's mouth, riding his pleasure in fast jerks, but still wanting to not gag his amazingly brilliant mate.
Mrs. Holmes continues looking out the window for several minutes, unaware of what is going on around her.  Eventually, their aunt comes in and tells her it's time for a laydown.
The fawn growled low in his throat, baring his teeth slightly at his brother, his calm facade cracking.
Fawnlock's chest practically vibrated with the loud rumble deep within, his damp nose brushing John's cheek. A dark blush settled under the fawn's soft fur as he found wasn't alarmed at all by the human's body covering his, almost draped over him. As in fact the Fae's nerves almost lit up with the pressure of John atop him, finding ferocious warmth spreading through his furred body. He made a soft sound in the back of his throat as he tried to get closer to John, ears flicking as he pulled away, practically panting, but wanting nothing more than to meet lips with John once more.
"You're seven." John giggles. "How long is always?" They look at the next exhibit not as cool as the bees, that's when they enter the dinosaur exhibit and he drags Sherlock to the T-Rex skeleton.
"You're welcome..." John looks down at the pool that the strange boy had fallen in and then at the boy himself. He figured he should probably get an adult to look at his bump, but he didn't seem the type to want to be looked after.
Fawnlock cuddled closer, snuffling softly as his fingers curled into the knit John's jumper. The Fae's eyes fluttered closed, his ears flicking back and forth, he pressed a kiss to his mate's throat.
The fawn blinked in shock as his mate left to pad up to his room, the young Fae blink several times before he plopped back into their nest groping for his scarf and laying it in his lap. He knew he'd be unable to take off the jumper on his own, so he settled, steepling his fingers in a prayer like fashion, his eyes shining with this new development. Fawnlock's eyes fluttered closed as he considered, John had understood what he'd said, he'd reverted back to his native tongue in frustration, and /John had understood what the fawn had said/.
Sherlock wraps an arm around John, "John, you should at least call your mum or dad to tell them Harry's out there..." Sherlock usually wouldn't care, but he cares about John, and if Harry got hurt, he knew John would be too.
Sherlock watches his brother, who looks to be in deep thought. After Mycroft blushes, he knows who his brother is thinking of. The taller boy smirks as he and John finish the maze.
John relishes in the hug, loving the positive affection and attention Sherlock gives him.  He blushes at Sherlock's comment.
"It's okay, My, we'll stay safe," Sherlock assures his brother as John starts to lead him off. He waves after his brother and squeezes John's hand, humming softly.
so sorry, i pretty much forgot about this, but i'm currently having issues with retrieving the emails so :P sorry for the shortness
Sherlock nods and follows John happily. He could tell John didn't get along well with his sister, and he didn't want John to feel uncomfortable, "Do you know constellations, John? Mycroft knows allot of the stories about them, and their origins, last Christmas he got me a book about them. We can look up the stars maybe?" Sherlock suggests, trying to get John at ease.
Sherlock nods, "It's okay, older siblings can do that sometimes." He tries to explain before searching through his satchel and pulling out a hanky, handing it to John, "You're my best friend John, I'm supposed to make you feel better, right, that's what friends do?" He asks softly. John sniffles again and takes the hanky, wiping his nose with it. He looks to Sherlock when he calls him his best friend.
Fawnlock shivered as John's fingers circled his antlers, his speckled fingers moving to lay on John's thigh. The fawn gave a content bleat, nuzzling the human's wrist. He shook his fingers free of John's other hand and moved to hold his elbow instead. John paused just a fraction as the fawn touched his leg, waiting patiently as Fawnlock adjusted himself before he continuing the petting.  Fawnlock's ear twitched under the human's fingers and a loud rumbling sounded in his chest. He never would have thought having someone stroke his ears and play with his hair would feel as good as it did, he absolutely loved it. The fawn leaned into John even more, tilting his head, careful of his antlers.
The next day after a light breakfast and awkward tea, the Holmes boys are preparing to leave. "Bye, Mummy," Sherlock leans up on his tip toes to kiss his mother's cheek, the straps to his pack gripped tightly in his little hands. He didn't really know how to feel about Mycroft's making them leave a day early, but he'd said it'd be better for mummy and that their aunt agreed, so he just shrugged and decided at least he'd see John sooner.
Sherlock gives a soft chuckle as well, flopping down atop his friend, starfish style. He smiles, "Now you see, people are idiots."
Sherlock rolls his eyes, "Myc," he whines softly, he eyes John, then sighs softly and cups his hand over his mouth and the receiver, "I love you too, bye," he whispers, hanging up.
"Only wood that has absorbed salt, so driftwood mostly, though some woods smell nice when you burn them." Explains Sherlock with a grin. He takes back his stick, poking a marshmallow on the end and sticking it over the flames. "You want to try putting one on?" He asks, pointing to the stack of wood. He likes his new friend, Sherlock really did, John was fun and not boring. John didn't think he was a freak either.
Sherlock narrows his eyes at John saying the word "miracle" but nods and picks up his paperback, eyes on John as he moves to his seat, taking note of where it is. As the teacher starts up a new lesson, Sherlock huffs and starts to read once more, already finding the lesson boring. Several times his eyes dart to where John sits and rare soft smile graces his lips as he watches his friend before his gaze slips back to his book.
The fawn had carefully moved from John's lap before he stood. As the human left, Fawnlock arched his neck to watch him as he scurried off into the depths of the cottage. The fawn looked around as he waited for John to return.
Once he was out of the nest, he came to stand next to the taller fawn, pressing a kiss to his chin where he could reach, then looking back down to the rest of the blankets and quilts. He was still starkers from before, but was wonderfully comfortable like this in their home. Fawnlock didn't wear anything after all...he just had better, convenient fur coverage.
John dipped his bread into the soup and sopped up the broth, nibbling at the drenched bread and alternating taking sips from the mug. As Fawnlock moved closer and spoke, John hummed, trying to think of what he could even bake, beyond the cookies he'd learned last night.
The rugby player catches the look of lost conversation on the younger teen's face, and he smirks, Mycroft was quite adorable, though Greg doubted the ginger knew so.
John is about to move on when he hears a splash and turns to watch that curly head smack onto the rocks. Frightened for the boy he rushes to his side and crouches next to him in the pool, soaking his trousers up the thigh.
Sherlock lets go of John's hand and nods as he crouches, "They're not worth your time," he murmurs, cupping his tiny hands around the spider with an intrigued smile curving his lips. He watched it crawl up his fingers, "Did you know daddy long legs could be quite dangerous if they were bigger?"
Though he frowns when he hears John's stomach, he's not all that hungry, and he's a bit down that they've been through the whole museum - except the boring parts. Well... boring to them; they have seen the exhibits they came to see and then some.
"You're a cheeky fawn." He breathed, bringing his hands back down to gently rest on top of the fawn's thighs, letting him do as he pleased.
He peers out, lips pursed, deeming it safe he boldly steps out. It's quiet... Eerily quiet, "Harriet?" He calls, getting no answer he moves out into the hall. He pads into the sitting room; seeing that the front door is wide open. Sherlock quickly moves back into the bathroom, "John, she's gone, she left.”
They were looking for things to make their hats look more real when Sherlock pulls out the feathered plume his mum had given him to put in his pirate hats. Sherlock smiles as he looks to John.
John leaned back on the grass and watched Fawnlock wade through the creek, the water clinging to his fur and making it glisten. He looked like a fertility god, kneeling in the stream and collecting water, bowing his antlered head beneath the sunlight.
At the crook if John's neck the Fae snuffled softly scenting his love, bleating softly. After a few blissful moments he pushed up at John's chest to settle himself sitting atop his hips.
"Bye..." John watches his best friend leave and then clings to his mother who picks him up and carts him to his room, tucking him into bed the way that she used to before her working hours turned into a nightmare.
He sighed and closed his eyes for a moment, relishing the touch of the fawn's speckled fingers. There entire morning was full of these little affection filled breaks. John was certain it'd take them forever to get home at this rate, but he could hardly complain. Every kiss made him ecstatic. With a soft hum, he leaned in and gave Fawnlock a proper kiss, slow and deep, nearly lasting long enough to steal both of their breaths away.
It may have been good for Fawnlock, but it was so, so good for John as well. He absolutely loved every bit of the fawn beneath him. Loved this.
John’s heart thudded rapidly in his chest with the prospect of speaking the fawn’s true name, but he was firmly in the mindset that he wasn't going to butcher it, and would definitely aim for attempting once he was better at the language. This made him feel even closer to Fawnlock, and warmth swelled anew within John. At times his love for the fae was almost smothering, suffocating. But he wouldn't have it any other way. He leaned up into Fawnlock's nuzzle, like a cat seeking out the touch that was offered.
John listened with interest as his mate explained the physiology behind scent marking. The doctor part of him found it fascinating- of course fae had different biology than humans. John strained to remember the habits of deer and other animals, how the scent marked for territorial reasons. Staking their claim, like Fawnlock was staking his claim on John. So the fawn didn't just rub and nuzzle on anyone, this was meant for John alone. He hadn't done that with Mrs. Hudson, just gentle touches here and there.
"Then we should definitely tackle the honey cakes first. I'm going to spoil you rotten." He grinned and nuzzled against the side of Fawnlock face, nosing over his freckles and cheekbone.
Sherlock chuckles softly, "But at least chickens have wings and small heads." He giggles softly, following his friend faithfully around the exhibit, absorbing information as the pair chats.
Sherlock looks to John, nodding a tad distractedly as his gaze moves back to the file. He turns to watch John put Sirius in his cage a small smile on his lips, "He is blind," he states, settling the file by the cage and peering inside, smiling fondly at the mouse.
He chuckles as Mycroft stares down for a moment or two, Greg gently takes the book from Mycroft to set on his desk and takes the younger teen's hands in his. The younger teen intently watching his actions, unable to look him in the face yet.
The young Fae gave a soft bleat and nodded, "Yes, if that's what you want, John." He nuzzled against his mate, the rumbling sounding soft and low in his chest as he cuddled close to John.
"What can I get to make the nest more comfortable for you? I can fetch your books from the den...get leaves or grass for you too. I want you to be comfortable in our home."
The taller boy looks up at the gray sky, feeling the slight nip in the air on his nose, "Well, I don't want it to die.." He frowns slightly, "We can't let that happen, John."
As Fawnlock's nuzzled and rubbed, John's hands went around his mate's stomach, resting gently against his taut abdomen and running his fingers through the soft, smooth fur there.
"My! My, there's a show in fifteen minutes! Can we stay and watch?" The younger boy asks, swinging his and John's intertwined hands.
"Wargs have been prowling around the clearing of your cottage, they're nasty, idiotic, nosey little buggers, obviously since they challenge my authority every chance they get." The fawn huffed softly, shaking his head slightly, "I couldn't let you get hurt, even before I chose you to be my mate." He smiled softly, dry leaves and snow crunching beneath his dark feet.
Sherlock huffs softly, rolling his eyes and taking out his essay to draft as John laid down, flopping against him as per usual.
So John looked between the two and picked up a biscuit to nibble at, for lack of anything else to do.
Greg, being perched on a stool, isn't in the prime position for a proper snog, but he will live, he just isn't able to get as close to Mycroft as he'd like. Now possessing permission, the older teen tentatively swipes his tongue into Mycroft's mouth, gently and hesitantly exploring, eyes fluttering closed. He didn't want to alarm Mycroft, so he kept the kiss sweet and a bit lazy.
"Sure!" John sticks his stick into the sand so it hovers over the fire, cooking the marshmallow and gets a piece of driftwood. He breaks off a few pieces and tosses them around the fire, watching as only certain parts of the flame changes color.
Fawnlock wriggled slightly as John spoke in his native tongue, the corners of his Cupid bow lips quirked up in an excited smile.
The fawn panted softly, curling his fingers around the heat of John's arousal, stroking from base to tip at a good pace. He nosed at his mate's cheek, breath puffing in hot bursts into John's mouth.
"If I freeze you can just thaw me out." He teased, arms sliding around the fawn's body. Taking all the blankets out of the den maybe wasn't the wisest decision, now. But he'd be fine for an hour with the fire.
John closed his eyes for just a moment as the fawn nuzzled back, bleating beside his ear with a warm huff of breath. This whole thing felt wonderful, the closeness, the absolute trust he'd managed to earn from this wonderful creature. It was the sort of bond that was so rare; he'd been searching for it for all his life, and just about given up. It was what every person craved to find in the world. Perhaps with the ancient system of honor the fae upheld, it was easier for them. Yet Fawnlock had lived for centuries and hadn't discovered it. Reopening his eyes to find the freckled face right before him, John was utterly mesmerized. His heart thudded heavy in his chest, pounding a furious tattoo against the skin. He was worried that somehow he'd ruin all this, take more than he was allowed, sacrifice this comfortable closeness. Was this enough, just being content with petting and nosing at cheeks? Indecision creased his brow for a mere moment before his fingers traveled down through tangles of curls to cup Fawnlock's soft cheeks. John leaned in the last few inches and brought their mouths together in a slow an gentle kiss. He was sure he'd have to explain it afterwards, but right then, it had just felt right.
He was so happy to have Fawnlock safe and in his arms again, even if he was a bit banged up at the time. At least they only had about a week or so before Fawnlock wouldn't have to return to the gate at all, and they could just hole up in the cottage for winter. John pressed kisses to his mate's hair line, chasing the stray curls with his nose.
"Everything is more beautiful in the spring, and I'm sure you're no different. My gorgeous Fawnlock, with your ruff and antlers shed, blooming with new life just like your woods." John hummed happily and laid his head against the mounded pillows of their nest so he could stare at his mate. "I can't wait to spend every season with you."
"But they are capable of such wonderful things to...and it's the hardships that make the happiness even sweeter." John smiled down against that wonderfully plush mouth and was ridiculously glad he possessed that spark Fawnlock had been searching for.
The removal of the jumper had been a brilliant idea, because having the fawn's fingers drag down his bare back was a marvelous feeling. He let Fawnlock explore the newly revealed skin as he pleased, as John could only benefit from the affectionate gestures and curious touches. As the far leaned closer, John brought a hand up to the back of his head, dipping into the dense curls and encouraging Fawnlock's admiration. The mouth on his neck had him shuddering and swallowing quickly so as not to gasp, his throat bobbing with movement beneath attentive presses of lips.
"Hello Sherlock," she turns to John.  "Your sister has been dealt with.  I'm proud of you for handling it so well."  She kisses his forehead and then pets Sherlock's hair.
"Not a problem." Sherlock spoons his soup in silence, moving to his wantons soon after, he sips some water.
Sherlock flips through his journal to a blank page, making notes silently before scribbling a little sketch of the sprout on the page.
"Probably black mold or asbestos," John says, looking at the experiments in front of him. So fascinating, seeing Sherlock's obsessions, "What are you gonna do when they get too old to keep around? "
The fawn's ears flicked, regarded the wound before bowing his head to press a gentle kiss to the red skin. He murmured softly in his native tongue, then when his gaze flickered up to John's, he blushed softly and translated, "Gentle protector be blessed."
Greg gives the younger teen a fond lopsided grin, "Uh, in the back, I got here late this morning, so I ended up by where the buses load up the students."
Sherlock mock pouts after Anderson, "That wasn't very nice," he turns to John, "now was it?" He give a smirk and stands to go get his book, "I rather like that book."
That rumble. John could listen to it for hours. That noise was for him and no one else. As Fawnlock dipped down to nuzzle against him, John practically purred as well, though it would have been a poor attempt compared to the dark, velvety noise that came from his mate's throat.
"Already?" Mycroft asks, raising his eyebrow. He's not used to Sherlock being ready to leave until closing time.
Winston and Mycroft share a look, smiling to each other. This is the first time Sherlock has ever had a friend and neither of them could be more proud of him. Mycroft was beginning to worry that he would never try and befriend someone and now that he has... well it has been a blessing. Sherlock is noticeably happier. They just dread when they have to go back to school.
"Alright, I'll take care of Harriet. Order your take away and do your homework. Love you sweety."  His mother hangs up and John stares at the phone before setting it down. Suddenly he isn't hungry anymore.
"I slept well. I dreamed of you.  It was spring. You had a crown of flowers and new antlers stubbing up from your curls. It was lovely." He murmured, watching as his mate stretched and put his lean body on display, the hem of the jumper rucking up his softly furred stomach.
"Though cutting down the unsuitable trees can leave room for more trees that may be suitable homes." He hummed softly, tail flicking slightly, ears twitching.
There was no denying the fawn anything he wanted, and Fawnlock probably already knew that without a doubt. Still, him asking was precious, and John nodded.
Fawnlock smiled softly up at his love, "Who else would I come to?" He asked softly, raising a brow up at his mate.
The Fae hummed softly, snuffling softly against John's skin, scenting him. A small smile curled the fawn's lips as he settled atop John a bit more comfortably, nuzzling the human's hairline. His speckled fingers played through John's short sandy locks, and a small yawn parted his lips. He moved and buried his face into John's neck, minding his antlers. His ears flicked lazily, eyes fluttering closed, Fawnlock's body calmed as he pressed his nose to John's pulse point, the steady sound of his mate's heartbeat lulling him, as well as the constant of John's scent.
"Um, you want to watch another movie or something?" He asks, not liking the sad look on John's face.
Mycroft looks down at their intertwined fingers and smiles before he looks up at Greg again.  That smile... it makes his knees weak... "As
It was true, whenever they were together, they were caught in a tangle of limbs and nuzzling faces more often than not. He chuckled when the fawn kissed his nose, and John pet up the fae's waist and back, rubbing his spine gently.
"Shall we?" Winston offers his arm to Mrs. Watson, a gentleman like Mycroft, seeing as he is the one who instilled such behaviors in him -  not their late father.
"If you need to take a break at all, just tell me, alright? Though.. I wonder if I'll be able to feel it if you don't feel well." He reached out through the bond, trying to gauge if he could somehow gauge how Fawnlock was feeling. He got a surge of warmth and love, but no pain or exhaustion. Of course, that might just be how he felt. It was hard to discern what feelings were his and which were his mate's.
There were so many things he was eager to show Fawnlock and teach him, but they had so many days to follow in which he could introduce his mate to everything under the sun that John Watson knew. He wrapped both hands around the fae, settling them both down on his lower back above the fluffy tuft of his tail. John tucked his cheek on top of Fawnlock's head, avoiding the antlers and nuzzling down into the curls with a sigh.
"Could you write my name? I want to see what it looks like in your handwriting. And maybe seeing it written will help me write it myself."
Sherlock smiles, "I'm glad too, I didn't want to go anyway." He murmurs into John's shoulder, hugging his friend back tightly.
He bleated softly and nuzzled John's cheek, "See kind heart." Fawnlock moved to the leather flap and shook it gently, dislodging any chunks of snow or ice that'd settled on it in the night.
A beautiful innocence, despite his curious nature. It was something so very precious to John. Then John turned and actually watched his mate strengthen his protection spell, and promptly had his usual mini sneezing fit associated with it.
The fawn's hips bucked against John's once more before he sat back on John's hips, "If you insist." He answered in a breathless murmur.
Sherlock wades into the pool carefully and gently picks up a shell, examining it before placing it in his satchel. He spots a small crab and kneels to examine the tiny crustacean with interest. He barely even notices the other boy who's approaching the pools.
His nose scrunched when he touched on the human word, and then he looked wistful for a moment. Perhaps his brother had shown him the reason he'd not yet found a mate for himself. Perhaps he'd been looking in the wrong place all along.
"Did you want to call your brother while I clean up?"  He asks, swallowing his last bite and climbs down from his chair with the plate in hand.
The fawn smiled and squeezed John's hands back. He gave a happy bleat, he loved the idea of spending more time with the human. A warm feeling settled in his chest at John's promise that he'd never be lonely again, his pale gaze settled on John's and he smiled at the human. Fawnlock gave another content bleat and leaned towards John slightly, resisting the urge to nuzzled his neck in appreciation.
He moves away and runs to the front door, slamming it closed and locking it before going back to John.
The young Fae nosed at his mate's jaw, rumbling softly, his eyes flickered closed as he considered how to respond.
The Fawn's head tilted once more, slightly puzzled, ears dropping slightly as he stared at the human's hand before something Moosecroft once said came to mind, "Right, humans... Shake hands?" He took the other's hand, head still tilted, Moosecroft had said something else as well, "The pleasure is all mine, John," He said a tad hesitantly, shaking John's hand. After letting go of the human's hand his gaze went back to scanning the forest while also sparring the human some attention. He looked to the darkening sky, "The sun is setting, the moon will rise soon."
"Thank you Moosecroft." Fawnlock bit his lip once more as he looked down into his cuppa. The fawn took a deep breath, and looked back up to Moosecroft, "Brother, I truly hope you find your own happiness, whether it be from a mate or otherwise. Moosecroft, though your kinghood has treated you well, you are lonely, I know we are very alike, and cannot find good company often or easily, but please, do this for yourself, and our kind. Look for the right one, a mate or a friend," Fawnlock's gaze flicked to John and his smile grew, "or both."
Wide eyes couldn't have been wrenched away from the magnificent creature if he wanted, even though fear coiled in his very core. Chest tightening, John realized he hadn't breathed in  nearly a minute, and finally gasped, cheeks flushed as oxygen rushed to his head and his heart felt as if it was going to burst. He was a soldier, hardly a coward. But bravery was the last thing on his mind. He was simply too stunned to remember the threat looming on the distant bank.  "What are you...?" He said in a breathy, deep voice, wondee and amazement dripping from every syllable.
John watches as Sherlock shoves something under his blankets but says nothing and responds to his question, "I had lots of fun." John shifts and wraps a blanket around him. "Did you?" He hoped so. Hopefully, Sherlock wasn't just trying to entertain him, that would be boring and make him feel like a nuisance.
"Well, you're part of my herd." He murmured softly, pulling back with a slight smile, ears twitching. His ears twitched and he pursed his lips once more before asking, "When you say lovers, do you mean like mates?" The Fae's eyes were bright with interest and curiosity. He very much wanted to learn more about humans, but more specifically John. He swept his thumbs over the human's cheeks as he waited for an answer. John leant into the touch of Fawnlock's hands, savoring the soft rub against his face before he answered, carefully.
"I was quite the troublemaker when I was my brother's age, no clue why mother thought the second would be any better." Mycroft hums.  "After father passed she kind of fell apart, so I'm caring for Sherlock now, I'm seven years his senior."
They exit the lift, enter the lobby and head for the door.  Mycroft thankful that he had made sure of having Winston is waiting outside with the car, even if it was just in case... he is smiling brilliantly. Mycroft said he wasn't sure what they needed, but clearly they nee- wanted him to drive them around. He is, in fact, the BEST driver in England. Yes. He means to brag since not many people can afford his over the top services.
"What are we eating tonight?" Sherlock asks his older brother. Mycroft follows suit with Sherlock's actions and hangs up the washcloth.
The Fae leaned forward slightly to follow John, and gave a small pout. He huffed softly and popped another berry into his mouth.
John smiled at Mrs. Hudson and bowed his head politely at her, tanking her again for the hospitality and kindness she had shown him. He hurried after the fawn out into the cold, tugging the collar of his coat up around his chin. Shoving his hands into his pockets to keep them warm, he followed through the woods, listening to Fawnlock consider where to visit first, a warm smile tugging at his lips.
John giggles as he pulls Sherlock along.  He loved it when Sherlock defended him, it just makes him swell with pride.
John was his anchor, tying his to existence with the pleasure he provided so sweetly, with his firm but gentle hands, one steadying his hips, the other around his aching prick. Fawnlock was overly aware of John's deliberate slowness, he didn't perceive it as any form of teasing, no, he knew, John only worried for the fawn, and that thought, of John still caring enough not to push him even in his obviously aroused state, pleased to fawn enough to cause him to groan softly. John's love was an almost a tangible thing the Fae could feel in the air, cradling the two as they coupled in their nest.
As his eyes fluttered open once more they moved to the human, watching him obviously enjoy the berries, the Fae's smile grew. "If you like the berries, John, there's bigger patches deeper into the woods, Mrs. Hudson says they make wonderful jams, I can take you later." he explains softly, eyes roving the clearing, following the blossoms and petals flutter in the breeze. John licked his fingers and glanced over at the fawn, watching how the sunlight dappled in golden spots over his fur. With a happy sigh, he wrenched his gaze away and leaned back, further and further till he was laying on the ground and watching the light blink through the tree canopy. It brought little spots of warmth through the chill wind. It was such a perfect, peaceful spot for a nap, but John was sure that would be some sort of sacrilege.
He turned to his brother, arms sweeping towards the path to Mrs. Hudson's cottage, "/John is at Mrs. Hudson's, this way./"
"I think it's a vulgar equivalent to gay or homosexual..." The taller boy sighs softly, sliding the piece into place after consulting the booklet. "I believe they're saying we're gay..."
The fawn's eyes fluttered closed as John's hand moved over his arm, his eyes opened and he looked over the human, "I could tell you were a warrior, or, um, a 'soldier'" Fawnlock listened as John spoke once more and his ears dropped when the human's tone hinted at disappointment, the fawn frowned slightly, "If you want I could take you out into the woods to explore." He offered, pale eyes intent on John. Fawnlock's tail flicked slightly, head tilted, "I won't let anything from my Wood bring you harm." He said softly, tilting his head up to stare at the ceiling, "besides, I don't usually have company when I walk through the woods, it can be lonely sometimes a suppose, company would never hurt." He murmured.
But it was moments like this, when they were so absolutely in love with each other and there was absolutely no question that they were building something magnificent. It was these moments John was living for. "Of course. We'll figure out how far this goes together. I'm eager to find out as well."
Sherlock smiles and nods, "What'd you do your last day at the beach?" He asks softly, tugging John's hand lightly, starting to walk a bit.
"I'm glad you like it love. I'll have to find more things to make you. We have similar diets, I think it should be easy." The man murmured, trailing off as the fawn nosed against him.
John lays on his stomach, Sherlock leaning into his side, cross legged so that he can lay on top of John dramatically as he normally does when they do homework together.
The taller boy purses his lips in thought, "I'd think it'd be like dating anyone else, female or otherwise. With some.. ridiculous people complications." He shrugs lightly.
He let the outside of the thermos cool while he fished out two plastic camping mugs from the bag, then poured the soup into them to be sipped out like a drink. He pulled out some wrapped chunks of bread as well, then brought their picnic lunch over to his mate, holding out the mug with a smile.
She grinned fondly and pressed an adoring palm to the irritated fawn's cheek, Fawnlock's tail was swishing agitatedly and he'd begrudgingly crossed his arms over his chest after shaking off John's hand gently.
Fawnlock’s cuddling was more than alright with the blond. John hummed and wrapped his arms around Fawnlock's waist, holding him back against his broad chest and resting his chin on the fae's shoulder.
The fawn's ear twitched slightly, and Fawnlock's eyes fluttered closed as a soft rumble sounded through his chest. When he was young, he'd let his maman rub his ears, it was always so nice, and comforting. John's fingers on his ears felt just as good as he remembered, maybe even better. The fawn leaned forward slightly, and into John's hand, the scratching was heavenly. Fawnlock gave a content bleat and he felt the strong urge to nuzzle his human friend.
"Let's pretend to be actually gay. I'd like to see some of their response if we were to proudly display it like my sister does. If it really offends some of them so much, should be quite funny, especially if it frightens them."
"Fawnlock..." The rumbling of the fawn vibrated through him, making him arch up and thrust slowly into the hand that was working his quickly towards release. Fading in an out of awareness, he suddenly was snapped back into the present when the fae licked across the scar on his shoulder.
Sherlock turns and nods to the butler, moving to help Mycroft disassemble the telescope. When they're done, Sherlock takes John's hand and tugs him back into the house, dragging him into the dining room with a bright smile.
The fae made his way to the gate's clearing, settling by the gate and watching diligently, as soon as the gate's portal closed once more he'd open it once more to go to Moosecroft's realm and speak with him.
With a deep breath, John had recovered enough to lean up and capture the fawn's mouth in another kiss, humming happily against the seam of his lips. His other hand groped for his discarded vest, finding it at the edge of the nest and bringing it around to clean off the mess from both himself and Fawnlock's hand, sufficient enough to continue cuddling before they washed up proper and he started on dinner. Right now though, he had no intention of leaving the nest for a while.
Fawnlock bleated softly as John's arm circled his waist, he leaned back more into John. His ears twitched as his mate's lips were pressed to his curls, and a smile stole across his lips at the chin settled on his shoulder.
When he found the dark blue knitted material, he pressed to his nose, snuffling softly before he turned back to John and offered the scarf to him so he could tie it around his neck.
They made it to the gate, and the younger Fae took the liberty of opening the portal and letting Moosecroft through first. As the entered his realm, the fawn shivered slightly, taking a deep breath and letting the familiar air of his wood fill his lunges and nose.
The taller boy smiles at his friend, "I'd like to see it, yeah."  He sighs softly, looking down at his chucks, "Miserable, I missed you, Mycroft always scolded me for sulking around all the time."
The older teen decides to push it a bit and swipes his tongue over the seam of the younger's lips with some hesitancy.
The fawn's eyes traveled back down to his mug as he felt a heat seat across his cheeks and face, skin under his velvety fur flushing.
He reached up and cupped the fawn's cheeks, touching their foreheads together in a soft little bump. "I really love you. With every fiber of my being. There is no John Watson anymore without you. You are me." He closed his eyes and just let the love radiate between them.
John felt a soft, barely there pressure on his forehead and looked up, just before his nose twitched and he sneezed. He squinted and rubbed his round nose, then climbed to his feet and hefted his pack up onto his shoulders. It was heavy, but he'd carried heavier in the desert.
The young Fae's tail swished and his ears flicked, "Very good John," he murmured, "a tad bit messy compared to mine, but I've had years of scripture practice."
"He is an idiot." John agreed with a chuckle, pulling the fawn into an embrace to help him relax further.
Fawnlock's eyes lifted to John as he moved around the room, settling what he assumed were plates of food down. He went back to reading the book, until he felt John's eyes on him, he met the human's gaze with his own pale one. He watched as John began to eat, using a metal utensil, setting aside his book, Fawnlock took up the metal utensil that was by the other plate, his eye skimmed over it until the human spoke. His ears twitched slightly as he considered his answer. Finally he spoke, "At first I taught myself, then my brother realized I wanted to read human words and he began teaching me. Reluctantly, I might add. I'm almost fluent in the human language French, I speak and read several others, though they're choppy like human English." His head tilted as he twirled the metal utensil in his fingers, "Other Fae my brother had found taught me the other languages, but he taught me first French, then English when I was young." He nodded, content with his answer as he began to consider the plate of food before him, he recognized the vegetables, he'd seen John growing them outside, but he had no clue what the long stringy things were, his tail flicked and his ears perked in interest.
"No! It's not that!" Fawnlock's eyes glowed in excitement, he bleated and wrapped his arms around John. He pulled away to peck his mate's cheek, that rumble starting deep in his chest. The Fae's tail flicked happily back and forth, "/You can understand me, yes?/" the Fae grinned and squeezed John once more as his mate gave a slightly confused nod, "/John, I'm not speaking English,/" he bleated happily once more, and nuzzled at John's jaw the feel of his mate's slight stubble making his smile a bit wider.
His ears twitched as he considered John's idea, a crease forming between his slight furrowed brows. After several minutes of intense thought and uneasy tail swishing, the fawn locked gazes with John and nodded, a small smile curving his lips.
"What about the rest of the summer?  I'm here for the next two weeks. Will you be here long enough so we can play every day?"
Whatever it was, it made John feel very protective of the fawn. He was John's to care about now. With one last peck to Fawnlock's cheek, he climbed to his feet and went to work collect broad, flat fern leaves, taking them from the old growth at the bases.
The fawn was too playful for his own good, sending John round the bend at the drop of a pin, or rather, a nuzzle to his cheek. John took his hands out of Fawnlock's and reached for his waist instead, pulling him close and pushing his knee between those long legs to bring them flush against each other. Fawnlock bleated softly in surprise as John pulled them flush together, but soon a smirk grew on his lips when his mate spoke.
"I bet you were a great Smaug!"  John exclaims as he pulls out the Hobbit, thumbing through the worn pages with a happy face.
"I'm fine, Are you okay Captain? "He asks Sherlock, still holding hands with both Sherlock and Greg. "We were going to meet Mycroft at the high school," John says, starting to feel safe with Greg.
"Fawnlock....I'm back!" He headed into the living room, over to the fawn's side and dropped down onto his knees to pull him up into a hug, nuzzling at the warm scarf around his neck. "Oh, I missed you, Love."
He gave a soft huff before leaning forward to nuzzle into John's neck.  He pulled away to kneel by the fire, pulling his scarf out and spreading it out on his thighs. The dark knit scarf was damp from the light snow outside, as were his dark curls. The fawn shook his head, smirking softly as droplets of water sprinkled John. The Fae gave a huff of laughter as he raised his dark hands to warm his cold hands. He hummed softly, his tail twitching as it thumped the floor quietly.
If he could have spoken, he would have chanted the fawn's name over and over again. As it was, his mouth was otherwise occupied, drawing long, deep suckles off the hot prick sliding in and out of his mouth, riding the thrusts and bucks of his hips and adjusting his pace to accommodate them.
Sherlock strides over the sand and towards the pools. After he hits the stones he stops at large pool and takes off his shoes and ties the laces together, setting them at the pool's edge.
The fawn's damp nose slid across to the tender spot under John's ear, nuzzling earnestly, scenting the human with a small smile.
Fawnlock set his tea on the floor, "Thank you, John. I'd like that, any bedding's fine, as long as it's soft and warm."
"Looks like you got lucky then." John smiles at Sirius who finds the water bottle and begins drinking from it for a great while, getting his fill.
Fawnlock bleated softly at the parting kiss to his cheek and laid his chin on the pillows once more as he watched his mate venture to the kitchen. The fawn rolled over after a few moments and wriggled slightly into a stretch, bleating softly at the blissful pops and cracked from his spine and other joints. He tilted his head as his ears twitched, catching the soft clinking noises of his mate working in the kitchen.
Soon his thoughts drifted back to his impending meeting with his elder brother, the fawn's ears dropped slightly, his bottom lip jutting out slightly in a pout. His eyes darkened slightly as he thought about what he was about to do, he wanted Moosecroft to respect and acknowledge his and John's love, it was an almost tangible thing between the mates, and surely even his brother wasn't too ignorant or snobby to ignore the obvious bond. Fawnlock knew deep inside that he couldn't live without his mate, not now, not after he'd finally found his love. His John.
