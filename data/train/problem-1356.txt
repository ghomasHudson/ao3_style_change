“Ladies and gentlemen, it would be my greatest honor to play the pianoforte for you all tonight on this happy occasion!” Moriarty’s voice climbed above the conversations scattered around the room and just like that, all attention was shifted. “You may know the piece, it’s by the great composer Mozart.”
“I don’t know if it’s possible, Bill, but I’m going to talk to you as if you can hear me anyways, because you’re the only person I give a damn about now and... you’re gone.” John said to the trees as if his best friend was somehow among them. “I know what you did for me, and I can’t thank you for it, not when I couldn’t do the same for you…”
Jane had meant to reply but it had been to late. There was no sign of Sherlock anywhere and the golden blue light that had surrounded her before did no longer, instead it was a gray day with clouds overhead. She looked down to find that her dress no longer fit her.
"Jane? Is that really you?" Jane's heart swelled when she heard a voice she knew well. She turned to see Molly at the edge of the crowd, looking hopeful.
“I…” Jane closed her mouth, reaching into the satchel and pulling out a small collection of photos of a little boy growing up to a young adult in his military uniform. “These are all old… ‘portraits’ of me.”
Holmes. That was the name that most of the village used when describing wealth or success. The man sitting in the armchair, rubbing his wrist, was the wealthiest man in their tiny little town and Jane hadn't exactly treated him the way that men who had wealth and an ego liked to be treated. She quietly groaned to herself and face-palmed. She had probably screwed herself over. As if her situation could get any worse. The last thing she needed was for this man to sue her for everything she owned, which was laughably little.
John dug the gun out of his pocket, checking to make sure that it was loaded before pressing it to his temple. The surge of emotions that struck him mercilessly was bizarre, foreign. He never imagined that he would feel fear in the face of killing himself. His finger trembled as he brushed it over the trigger. He was so close and yet... A pathetic whimper tore itself from his throat, and he threw the gun down the hill, legs curling up against his chest as he began to sob. He was furious with himself and the way his body was aching for air and his hands were shaking. He was hyperventilating, chest heaving with panic. Why did he have to be such a coward? Why couldn't he just end it? What did he have left in the world?
"Are you sure she's not using you as an opportunity to climb to a higher place in society and for your wealth?" Virginia asked uncertainly.
"Jane did not." Mary replied as if sensing the questions he was too nervous to ask. "I would recommend approaching her about it though, seeing as you will be dueling Mr. Moriarty tomorrow. I think it would be best if she heard it all from you."
And what of his friends? There would be no more Mr. Lestrade, no more Molly, nor Ms. Morstan. He felt tears start to wash down his face, speeding down every line and curve of a face that was his own but not the one he'd come to know as a part of him.
Sherlock's tongue delved inside her and Jane was completely pulled out of her thoughts and back to the new sensations Sherlock was lavishing her in. She had already given up on reading anymore and had set the book to the side, hips naturally lifting on their own and pressing back against Sherlock's lips. She could practically feel him smirking against her, one of his arms gently wrapping around her legs as if he needed to touch more of her.
“And now that you are here it will all be simply delightful!” She punctuated this statement with a light laugh.
“He is no worse Master John, holding his own, I should say. As he is asleep, you would have been unwise to do anything had you been awake anyway.  Drink your tea and eat a little food.  You may then tell me what is best to do for the Earl now.”
John felt a thrill of pure happiness at their praise.  He too was grateful that he could heal the man who possessed his whole heart! For Sherlock to have died was an unbearable thought.
As the evening progressed, the storm intensified. Shouts could be heard from on deck above the roar of the wind and waves, where the crew were struggling to control the vessel. Finally with a resigned huff, Lord Holmes turned to Hudson, who had just appeared with an update from the Captain, and requested oilskins and boots, announcing that he was going on deck to assist the crew.
Sherlock didn’t think that John was awake but his quiet weeping was rapidly turning into anguished sobbing so, prompted by his newly awakened heart twisting painfully in his chest, Sherlock acted.  Wanting only to alleviate John's suffering, he reached out, rolled John into his arms and cradled him close.
John, profoundly surprised by Lord Holmes' action, obeyed without protest. He was then even more surprised at the startling sensation of tranquility that began to suffuse his mind and body as he lay beside Lord Holmes. I ought to be frightened by this, he thought, why am I not? In fact, John was not only not frightened, he felt safe, protected, even. Confused, he was still trying to understand his inexplicable feelings when he drifted into an exhausted sleep, the roar of the wind and waves receding from his consciousness.
Hearing Sherlock’s voice, full of tenderness and compassion, and absorbing his comforting touch, John responded like a tender new leaf to the first rays of spring sunlight. He unfurled his body against Sherlock's with a sigh, wrapped his arms around the man and went limp.
"Your pardon sir, it is toward land." The first mate paused and unable to resist adding his own gloomy prediction, said darkly, "Pirates, like as not in this God-forsaken part of the world."
"Oh, dear God, where did that thought come from!?" John exclaimed to himself in silent horror. "Heaven above, he can't know what I just imagined; I must get off of his lap! Now!"
"Yes, my lord," sighed his valet with a resigned nod. He continued, perking up noticeably at the prospect of having someone to look after who might welcome his ministrations, "Shall I make up a cabin for Master John?"
"No!" exclaimed John and when both men stared at him in surprise, he stammered, "What I mean is, I'll come up too, I can be of help. I climb well and I'm light, I can go up the mast if needed."
He wasn’t sure how long he remained lost in thought but his reverie was interrupted by Hudson’s return.  Hudson and an embassy footman were weighed down with boxes, which when unpacked, revealed the finest Athens had to offer in gentlemen’s attire.  Presented with his new suiting John was bidden to retreat to a dressing room and change for the next leg of the journey.
“Do you… think so, John?” Sherlock’s bright eyes flickered open briefly to look at him, as if to assure himself that John was sincere.
He bid Hudson a brief farewell and, after ensuring the landlord was nowhere about, he slipped out of the window of their room and moved quickly away from the inn.  Once out of sight, he slowed a little, his limp quite noticable, and began to make his steady way toward the centre of the town, staying to backstreets and allies, working his way toward where he imagined the poorer section of Gelibolu would be.  His instincts weren’t wrong, probably thanks in part to his accompanying Molly to assist the sick and injured who suffered in the slums of Constantinople. His knowledge of the layout of Eastern cities was turning out to be as useful as his rudimentary language skills in Turkish and Russian.
John knew that speed was essential. He was extremely worried. They had minimal medicinal supplies; certainly nothing to deal properly with knife wounds. Sherlock had lost a not inconsiderable amount of blood; and even if they could stop the bleeding temporarily and apply a basic antiseptic, he still needed stitches. They must escape somehow.
To his immense relief his plan had unfolded without incident. Thankfully, as he had depended upon, Lord Holmes had not returned to the yacht the previous night (no doubt making the most of his last night with Lady Adler thought John with uncharacteristic pique). When the crew members on the Wind Shadow transferred watch at 4:00 AM, John had been able, small and light as he was, to slip over the stern of the boat unnoticed in the darkness and creep down into the hold.
The three were well into the town before at last they came upon a visibly lit building. Hudson, wasting no time, thumped on the door of what a sign proclaimed to be a Traveller’s Inn. It appeared decrepit and shabby even in the dim light cast by a lamp burning over the entrance but they were not in a position to be choosy about accommodations. John, almost collapsing under the weight of Sherlock who was breathing with exertion and leaning heavily against him, hovered in the shadows while Hudson, the only member of their party not stained with blood, negotiated a room from the half-asleep proprietor who appeared in answer to their knock.  The groggy innkeeper, reassured of Hudson’s legitimacy by the obvious quality of his seaman’s uniform, handed over a key in exchange for some coins without question. He gestured down a hallway before ascending the stairs heavily and retiring again to bed without a backward glance at his late night guest.
Not wishing to attract attention by visiting a chemist in his ragged state, John purchased what he needed to treat Sherlock from the market he had skirted around earlier; more camphorated oil, several bunches of dried germander, loosely woven linen cloth and a bottle of Vin Mariani or French tonic.  John knew this drink well, it was popularly considered a wonder medicine, advertised as fortifying and refreshing for body and brain, guaranteed to restore one’s health and vitality and used by Queen Victoria herself.
Sherlock gave an abrupt nod of acquiescence and so John was able to continue. He used as little of the Elixir Mariani as possible, just enough to numb the wound. He was aware that in the ten years since its use had become widespread in Europe, many people had become dependent on it, utterly unable to resist it.  In its own way it was as destructive to the mind and body as Chinese opium.  He wondered as he finished stitching his wound if the Earl had had some unfortunate experience with its mind altering side effects.
Lord Holmes gave a low laugh, "You don't flatter me Irene! Nevertheless, although it pains me deeply, I must leave. You know I will treasure, always, the memory of our time together in this beautiful city. Truly, Constantinople is the only city in the world that is a worthy backdrop for your own incomparable beauty."
"You, Englishman? Nothing−for now. You and the old man can take advantage of our hospitality in the other room. The boy? He'll stay with us." He wrapped a rough hand around John's arm.
"By all means John, I confess I quite miss my head bandage. I've become accustomed to your ministrations; I'd be lost without my physician." His tone was lighthearted in an attempt to ease John's obvious anxiety, but his complexion, if anything, was even paler than before and beads of perspiration were now visible on his forehead.
"Yes, my Lord," murmured Hudson soothingly, going about the cabin securing anything loose that could possibly break should the motion of the boat became any worse.
“I expect M’Lord you will want to meet directly with Lord Bosham and the Foreign Secretary the moment we arrive on home soil,” queried Hudson.
He tried to reassure her, "Don't worry. You know how careful I am Molly. I will be fine. I'll send word as soon as I get to England, I promise."
He sat up in a hurry, instantly regretting it as a wave of dizziness swamped him.  Before he could slump over though, Hudson was at his side with a steadying arm and an offer of water.  John accepted the drink gratefully and looked about him.  The three of them were sitting on a grassy hillside dotted with shrubs; mostly olives, myrtles and laurels. Hudson was beside him and Sherlock close by, at present gazing across a valley spread out before them. Feeling inexplicably awkward when Sherlock turned and smiled at him, John turned his head away hastily to see behind them, quite some way behind them, the grey rocky slopes of the mountains they had obviously just traversed.
“He’s a different boy when he isn’t afraid, isn’t he? Do you think that he is happy being with me – rather, I mean, with us, Hudson?”
By evening, those who were staying in the village to await the arrival of the weekly steamer had been settled comfortably as guests in village homes. With bedding retrieved from the Wind Shadow, Hudson prepared temporary sleeping quarters on a sheltered portico adjacent to the tiny village's main courtyard for  Sherlock, John and himself.
They were traversing the edge of a gully near the foot of a hill, its grey marble stone seamed and cracked, when Hudson suggested they stop for the night.
They both remained awake; Sherlock reveling in his first experience of feeling love for another − and it had to be love, he reasoned, what else could make him feel this strong, this committed and this happy to be the protector and defender of another person? He had never had any patience with snobbery or social elitism, so it bothered him not that he should have become so attached to an unknown homeless boy in such a short time. He knew with a conviction that had been stealing over him for the last several days that John was his to nurture and love and the feeling was pure joy; he had experienced nothing like it before in his own rather lonely life.
“I know… but…” Jane sighed, a hand ruffling through her hair agitatedly. “What if this is truly the end..? What if he takes one look at me once I tell him and he sends me away for good? He
Her feet were quickly moving on their own and she had no choice but to follow them as she tried to figure out where the voice was coming from. There were a couple thick, untamed shrubs in what she decided must be the right way. She pushed through the bramble and branches, and as she struggled her way through the hem of her dress got snagged and torn, leaving it ragged and not-at-all very lady-like looking. She couldn't be damned, though, if it was the price she had to pay for a little bit of excitement.
The way Sherlock treated her was always so astounding to her. She had sex plenty of times when she when she was a man, perhaps it was because they had all been flings. John had been with a man before; giving it the old college try, but it had been one of the worst sexual experiences of his life. That partner had no consideration for how John felt about bottoming on his first time with a man and had barely cared enough to lube him up before shoving his cock inside him.
"Well... she's been through a very traumatic experience recently." she offered as explanation finally. John couldn't even guess what that meant.
"You're over it? You do continue to astound me, Mrs. Holmes..." Sherlock murmured in a sort of awe. Jane's features softened and she plopped back down on the grass, patting the spot beside her. Sherlock nervously sat, swallowing thickly.
"I agree with Ms. Morstan. I believe you will make a delightful addition to the household staff." Jim stated, sitting back down in his chair but not taking his gaze away from John. "You may start whenever you wish."
The day of the party had finally arrived and Jane was fairly excited to find out what everyone would think. Sherlock was still not home, it had been four weeks and she wasn't even sure if he was coming home or if he had forgotten the party entirely as had been the case in the past based on her conversation with him last time they spoke. Mrs. Hudson had been busy in the kitchen since yesterday preparing them a feast of delicious meals. The entire house was decked out in baubles of various colors and shapes and the tree that she had gotten the assistance of Mr. Lestrade to fetch stood proudly in the foyer, decorated beautifully. She wasn't sure it fit the time period but she couldn't bring herself to care. It felt relatively normal and the colorful decorations made her feel less alone.
For a man with PTSD, it surprised him how little the thunder actually bothered him. Most would be reminded of bombs going off in the distance and at the very least flinch with every loud crack the sky produced. John did find himself transferred back to the battlefield as the air outside hummed and rumbled with the roll of electricity, but instead of unnerving him, it was a comfort. Like when a mentor or a family member rests a reassuring hand on your shoulder, silently promising that everything will be right with the world. He was sure he’d sleep well tonight with the ghosts of his battlefield memories clearer than they had been in months, a sort of sick lullaby of the last place where he had felt truly at home.
Jane huffed but went to hid in the changing room with the dress she’d been handed. With help from the tailor to get the dress on, Jane stared at her reflection in the mirror, very surprised by the lady in it.
"Observing." Sherlock answered simply, doing as he usually did when he was only half engaged in a conversation and keeping his gaze focused on whatever it had been focused on before the conversation had stated.
"John!" Queen Amanda of Summerdale called sweetly. "Come, sweetheart, we have some very important guests coming today and I need you by my side to greet them."
That future was quickly fading into obscurity as Bill’s face started to turn as white as a sheet, now covered in a thick layer of clammy sweat as John’s mind struggled with what he should do with the wound besides just apply pressure. His medical skills were never more important than they were now, but he called on them desperately in his mind and got nothing for his troubles. His best friend’s life was at stake!
"You expect me to believe that you went to King's College?" Sherlock took her hand with his good one and she pulled him up as best she could. She found herself almost impressed that he had bothered to listen to her instructions, saving himself more pain than necessary.
"Oh, yeah, I did, I suppose. It was no problem at all." Jane murmured, giving a small curtsy as Mrs. Holmes did. Virginia turned to her son.
“I see…” Sherlock replied, only looking mildly relieved. Whatever was on his mind, the scar on her shoulder was not the heart of it. Though, she didn’t have to wait long because he broke the thought-filled silence after a moment or so. "I know you consider yourself to be 'just a maid,' but that may be subject to change soon..."
"Not sure." John lied. It was better that no one knew his adventure, after all who would believe him?
“Your dominant hand, please.” She murmured and he offered his left hand as instructed. “Ah, a lefty. That’s always fun.”
"Jane. Thank you, for this. I shan't forget it. How much do I owe you in payment for your services?" he questioned with a genuine smile as he dug out his purse.
The evening arrived much faster than Jane anticipated and soon there were guests flooding the halls and Jim stepped into the guest room to check on Jane.
Jane took a moment to look at the ring as they rode home from the church. It was a very unique looking setting. One diamond towered over the others in the center, two more sprouted from the right side as if to look like leaves, and on the left side was a row of five square shaped diamonds. It was quite possible that this ring was the most expensive thing she had ever owned.
For the first time since being thrown into the past, her limp had returned and she was careful to make sure the servants didn't see, not sure she wanted Sherlock to know, or what his reaction would be in the first place.
Dozens of people had vanished over the years, and no one ever returned. It wasn't as if the moors hadn't been thoroughly searched either. There were rangers that had combed every inch of the forests, the fields, and the marshes and while they'd find a possession or two every once in a great while, there were never any hints as to where the items' owners had disappeared to. The authorities, at one point, wondered if perhaps someone was kidnapping people off the moors while they hiked, but there was never enough evidence to conclude foul play. No struggle, no tire tracks, no footprints. Just one unsettling disappearance after another. Besides, few theories could hold up well against the fact that these disappearances had been going on for several centuries.
"Giving up before you've even begun?" she asked, raising an eyebrow. She felt him gently cradle her leg and reposition her so her legs were very much spread enough for him to nest comfortably between them.
"John. Where have you been?" John couldn't help but wince at his own name. He glanced at Ranger Dimmock and patted Harry's shoulder.
"You're very welcome, Holmes. Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone." Jane teased, getting up and leaving the room and closing the door.
"I am not. He simply offered me a place to stay, nothing more," she promised and he stared at her a good long moment before cupping her cheek and kissing her. She held her breath for a moment and he pulled away. "What of Ms. Adler?"
With cries of ecstasy they came together and Sherlock gently let her legs down, not pulling out of her yet.
"You want a girlfriend named... Jane?" John raised his eyebrows and bopped her in the forehead gently.
"Maybe Sherlock should start the introductions, Sherlock, dear?" The little girl looked up from the spot on the ground she had been staring at as if brought to life for the first time since John had seen her before returning to her dazed state, looking at John, but somehow not.
"I know that she may seem a bit odd to you, and a little unsettling too, but it isn't fair to judge someone by their oddities." she admonished. "You are going to be the ruler of this kingdom someday, it's okay to make mistakes now so you can learn from them, but I would like you to try harder with Sherlock. From what Wolfguard told me, she's usually a very social, inquisitive, and active girl. I think under normal circumstances the two of you would get along well."
If any of you want to vote on my survey about which fics come after I eventually finish this one, I have about five more chapters, I think, before this story comes to its end and it may be awhile until I do another Johnlock fic based on current results.
"What are you doing?" Molly asked curiously, rather intrigued by the expression of concentration on her friend's features.
He allowed a moment to relax and breathe, pressing small kisses to her forehead that seemed less urgent than before.
"Yes, make sure she gets rosemary tea before bed and once she wakes up. Twice a day should suffice. I'll return in a fortnight to make sure she's well."
Wolfson rarely spoke during dinner, except to clarify a detail or two, but it was easy to tell that what may have started off as an arranged marriage for Sherlock's parents, was no longer that. They were obviously very in love and it was easiest to tell by the way Wolfson would glance at Virginia with a tender smile as she talked or how Virginia would reach over for his hand occasionally to hold it for as long as she could before it was deemed inappropriate by the current society.
Major Williams grasped John's sore shoulder and pulled John into his study, declaring that he had someone who wished to meet him. Fearful, although he wasn't certain why, John watched warily as the unknown man whose voice he had heard turned from the window to face him. He was an expensively dressed older man, heavy and oily in appearance with a puffy face; showing clear signs of dissipation around his pouched eyes and thin lips. His hooded gaze slid over John in a calculating manner, lingering on the boyish line of John's small waist and hips. He gave no greeting, nor did John's stepfather introduce him. Instead, in a manner which made John's skin crawl, the stranger licked his lips and indicated with one finger to John that he should turn to face the wall. Reluctantly John obeyed, only to shiver in revulsion as he felt the stranger's eyes slide down his back. John spun around quickly to face both men again, backing instinctively toward the perceived safety of the study's desk.
The bed was indeed as comfortable as it looked, a far cry from the spring mattresses he’d been sleeping on for the last year, and something a bit more like the army cots he’d been so used to once. It appeared that Molly was having just as difficult a time falling asleep as he was, though that might of been from distrust. John knew that if he couldn’t get whatever time-traveling magic he’d stumbled into to work again in the morning, he’d need Molly as a friend to survive, which meant that he had to put a stop to the distrust between them.
"Stay with me, Holmes. I need you to remain conscious." Jane murmured, trying to maintain eye contact with him.
It sounded like a bunch of superstitious lunacy to John. He shook his head as a local loony went on about these mysterious disappearances on great length and a dramatic booming voice while John sawed away at his bangers with a knife, occasionally stopping in his labors to pop a piece of the savory sausage into his mouth. What did he care anyway? There was really no point in dwelling on those disappearances, not when there was a purpose to coming to this little town of Baskerville which sat cleanly on the borders that split Britain and Scotland.
"From now on, should I prove to be too frugal with my compliments towards you, let me know. I'd rather be made aware of how foolish I'm being rather than continue to be an ignorant fool." Sherlock moved his hips and it caused them both to let out quiet moans. Slowly but surely, he worked himself into a normal pace, encouraged more when Jane's fingers found their way into his thick curls.
Sherlock made his way through the crowd and held Jane’s hands in his own, bringing one to his lips. Slowly applause started to break out through the room, started by Mrs. Hudson, Moriarty, Molly, and Greg. The clapping was contagious, as were the smiles on Jane and Sherlock’s lips. Ms. Adler seemed like she was trying her best not to erupt like an active volcano. It was quite possibly the first time a man had turned her down and she didn’t seem to be taking it well.
Harry didn't know what to think. Yes, it was an unbelievable story but there was just so much honesty in John's eyes. Whether it had actually happened or not, John believed it did.
"If it makes you you again, I don't mind strange." Harry murmured, hugging him from behind as he sat at the dining room table.
"I clean up well, I think..." she muttered to herself, Janine already in a different part of the house on her duties. Her dress had a square neckline, tight mid-length sleeves and red and white stripes going up and down the base of it, with a lovely red, floor-length peplum that was embroidered with beads in various patterns. Her hair was done up in a braided bun that sat low on her neck and she had put of sprig of holly in her hair to be an accessory for the evening. With most of the family already arrived, she made her way downstairs to greet them, hoping that Sherlock would show up so she didn't have to explain to his family the state of their marriage with no other explanations to give.
"Shall we get going?" Jane suggested, and they made their way to the marketplace at their own pace. Sherlock had to rest his ankle every now and then. It had only been three days since it was sprained and while he was doing much better at moving around on his own, it still wasn't completely healed yet. So when they needed to rest, they would sit on the side of the road in the grass and read the book that Sherlock had brought along for a bit.
She wasn't the largest fan of his ability to somehow know that she had walked here without even looking at her. Or perhaps he had when her back was turned... Either way, she was grateful his gaze wasn't on her now. She was certain she'd feel completely naked under his calculating gaze, which was something she wasn't particularly fond of either.
She had never once anticipated marriage after the way things ended in Afghanistan. No one would want a washed up 'war hero' with depression. Then again, Sherlock never really saw that side of her. Jane's life had changed so drastically in the last few months that it was almost difficult to imagine that she'd been the shell of John Watson less than half a year ago. She wasn't completely content, but somehow Sherlock entering her life in the last week had managed to eliminate any last qualms she had about this situation.
The dress was indeed lovely, if more revealing than what Jane had become accustomed to wearing. It was off the shoulder, which was mostly why she felt so exposed. The top was embroidered with scrolling in a dark blue color and to separate the bottom from the top aesthetically a thin ribbon wrapped around her waist, tied in a bow with long tails. The skirt was flowy and, when Jane spun around, it lifted and began to glide on the air naturally before wrapping around her ankles and falling back into place.
Mary set to work, stripping Jane of her current dress and donning her in the layers of petticoats that came with the gown.
Work was easy enough, most days he was washing dishes while Mary cooked and the two ladies got to be relatively good friends. Summer was almost to an end when something relatively exciting happened again.
"Mr. Holmes, I really don't blame you for being focused. I wouldn't have saved you if I didn't want to." She reached out and touched his hand in a reassuring manner. To Sherlock that touch was like a jolt of lightning, setting fire to his blood. He didn’t understand it, but it was the first time he’d felt guilty about anything so he assumed that had a great deal to do with it. Sherlock met her gaze finally.
Molly had been chattering away about something and John had hardly been paying attention, too distracted by his predicament. But then she looked at him with some mild concern and he was brought back into the conversation with a nervous expression. Had she said something important? Was she expecting him to reply? He had no idea what she had been talking about.
Moriarty ushered her inside but soon disappeared in the crowd to get an early start at finding Jane’s husband in the large estate. All eyes fell on her for two reasons: firstly, it was probably the most unusual sight to see a man’s former wife at an engagement celebration to his newest fiancee, and secondly, while everyone around her was also dressed in expensive clothes, it was quite obvious that Jane’s dress was a cut above the normal standard set for this evening.
Even though a moment ago, all the trees he had passed to get to where he was sitting except the holly tree had been bare, every tree was sporting blossoms and budding leaves. There were dewdrops sprinkled over the grass that covered the forest floor even though John was certain it hadn't rained in days, and he stood slowly, trying to get a view of any civilization. He hadn't wandered too far away. Only a thirty-minute walk from where he had been staying the night before, though he had been trudging briskly.
It felt like it took Harry what felt like an eternity to get him and it made sense since London wasn't exactly close. Six and a half torturous hours later, Harry was rushing in and pulling her brother into a fierce hug which he eventually returned.
They set out on their journey at dawn the next day. John was puzzled by the lack of a map, given that they were not familiar with the region, but Sherlock seemed to know the location of the path and the direction in which they should travel. It wasn't long before John realized to his amazement that Sherlock must have memorized the maps he had been studying prior to their rescue from the Wind Shadow. It was clear he did not intend to travel by the main roads for they kept to a narrow track wide enough only for foot traffic. John was oriented enough to know that they were heading south, which put them in the direction of Gelibolu.
One of the older men appeared to be the informal leader. He had a second-in-command; a stocky man with an aggressive demeanour who obviously relied on force more than intelligence to achieve what he wanted. He had a fondness for drink too, if the redness of his face and bleary eyes were any indication. The other four were young men and inexperienced soldiers, likely not long off the farm.
When they finally reached Lord Holmes' cabin, Hudson wasted little time knocking and entering. John had been trying to prepare himself for being brought before the Earl but was unsure what to expect now the moment had arrived. Whatever he'd imagined though, it was certainly not the scene that met him. The large cabin was littered with books, journals, papers and maps, many of the latter pinned haphazardly to the walls in complete disregard for the pristine mahogany woodwork. Lord Holmes was there, but looking nothing like he had the previous evening. He was without a coat, his shirt collar was open at his throat, his sleeves were rolled up to the elbows and his dark curls were wildly dishevelled. Notebook, pen and map pins in hand, he had the appearance of a mad professor in the midst of a scientific experiment gone awry. He certainly wasn't, as his reputation might have suggested, the picture of a self-indulgent nobleman lounging indolently with a bottle of claret at his elbow.
Boarding the ship had been uneventful.  It had been decided that Hudson would go to the shipping office to purchase their passage.  (John had handed Hudson his remaining money, surreptitiously, when he had returned from the market that morning).  Despite John’s concern, Lord Holmes had not inquired as to where the funds for tickets would come from.  John certainly didn’t wish for either Lord Holmes or Hudson to know of his selling the broach.
Her companion was a tall, darkly handsome young man, impeccably dressed in exquisitely tailored Rocola evening-wear, which, despite his youth, he wore with a careless ease. He replied, his voice sonorous in the quiet twilight of the garden, "I deeply regret that I must Irene, I wish I could stay." Lord Holmes raised her fingers to his lips, "But there is important work for me to do in England."
Hudson's solicitous attention to John resumed in the morning. He arrived in John's cabin at the same time as a pink and blue dawn made its appearance through John’s porthole, ushering in another brilliant day at sea. Delighted with such an appreciative charge, Hudson had outdone himself by procuring not only a full breakfast but also a suit of clothing for John, obtained, he informed him, from the Captain who had purchased it from one of Constantinople’s expert tailors for his eldest son. Seeing John's face upon learning this, Hudson reassured him firmly that the Captain had been generously reimbursed and as his lordship’s guest John was to think nothing further of it.
"Good morning, Ms. Watson." The blood in Jane's veins froze as she slowly turned to see the very man she thought she'd seen the last of, sitting calmly in the same armchair as before, looking down at a book he had poised neatly in one hand. "The walk here was refreshing, I hope."
"Your secret is safe with me," she assured and he watched her in surprise a moment before finally relaxing his shoulders.
“You have been a captive and wonderful audience and you have my appreciation and gratitude, but it appears that our gracious host would like to say something,” Moriarty announced and a breath of relief flooded the room as the party patrons realized that they wouldn’t have to continue to endure Mr. Moriarty’s performance. With that, James left the pianoforte and made his way to stand near Jane.
Jane had expected to hate the simplicity that spending all day reading with Sherlock would bring, but after getting to know him just a little bit better she found she didn't mind at all. It was a welcomed bliss that she was unaccustomed to and the warm autumn day only served to make it that much more pleasant.
"Mrs. Holmes." he greeted, straightening out his jacket and giving a slight bow in greeting. Jane simply nodded her head stiffly. "I hardly expected to see you in London. I haven't seen you about Baskerville so I assumed your husband had you locked up in Bakerfield Park to have you all for himself."
"A cèilidh? What's that?" Jane asked, raising an eyebrow as Molly dragged her through the market in search for a dress.
With that Jane left the room, rushing out of the house and back to her own home with Molly, a safe haven from the world around her. All thoughts of the wounded Mr. Holmes fled her panicked mind.
"You're quite welcome, now, if I could ask something that's been weighing on my mind?" Sherlock asked gently. Jane's brow furrowed. She hadn't expected that. Slowly she nodded. "You've been limping. Are you alright?"
Jane glanced behind her just in time to see the maid heading unwittingly towards Sherlock. There was no time to stop her, so she simply jumped in front of Sherlock, determined to take the damage he wasn't even aware he was about to receive. The maid had turned around just in time to collide with Jane, sending the hot water splashing all over her and missing Sherlock and the unsuspecting maid completely. Jane let out a small cry of pain, clenching her firsts to endure it all.
"I suppose... but please let Sherlock accompany you." the Queen answered. John looked back at Sherlock and his shoulders dropped in disappointment. This was not his idea of fun.
I also have a tumblr and on both platforms, I let people know I've updated so please feel free to check out either or both:
She had cleared out the library of books to read and now she had nothing to do but read them again, and even that didn't seem very appealing. The vast estate had been fun to explore at first but now it was all familiar. She even had a favorite reading spot in a lovely meadow with blue and purple wildflowers speckled among the grass.
When he reached the edge of the forest he halted, trying to think of the best way to look presentable. He was wearing a white tank top under his button up shirt and decided that would probably be the most natural thing to wear since it was hanging to his mid thighs instead of his hips like it should. He stripped himself of everything except the tank top and continued walking into town. The looks he got from people weren't encouraging, not that they had room to judge him when they were dressed so strangely. What was with their clothes?
"Alright, John, you can do this... You're going to march in there and tell that damn ignorant prick that you're not interested." She whispered to herself, taking a deep breath.
Soon enough she found herself in a high-end tailor’s shop with Mr. Moriarty rummaging through shelves and wardrobes of dresses in search of something that would catch Sherlock’s attention. Finally, he let out a cry of victory and thrust a dress into her arms.
"I am an open book, Ms. Watson, any curiosity you have, I am willing to quench. It would be rude not to with how frequently you seem to have taken up a habit of saving me."
"Yeah. Sure." Jane chuckled, watching him get ready with amusement and she started to make herself appropriate for her new lady's maid to help her dress (Molly obviously couldn't be her lady's maid anymore since she was now a Duchess by marriage). "Will you be home in time for dinner?"
"Mama! I don't know what you mean." he denied, pulling his gaze away from Jane and Harriet and to his mother.
Sherlock and Moriarty prepare for their duel and in the mix of the tense atmosphere some rather unexpected confessions are made.
"What's the matter?" she asked, cupping his cheek. He leaned into her touch instinctively, pressing gentle kisses to the palm of her hand.
“Yes, truly. I’ve been experiencing symptoms for over a month now… and I’m just barely starting to expand…”
"No. I don't... are you worried that I'm sharing my affection with him?" she questioned and he nodded, shame filling his features.
"It's merely sprained. Like your wrist it will be better in a couple of days, maybe a week at most depending on the severity of the spain. The best suggestion I can make to help it along faster is to walk on it as much as possible."
The rest of the day had gone by rather uneventfully in comparison to earlier that afternoon. Mike and John had decided not to go to their secret base after all, but since John's hand still ached, they couldn't train with Lord Lestrade either, much to John's chagrin. Sherlock was back to her boring, unsettling self, staring off at nothing, even during meals, barely touching her food, and no matter how hard John tried, he just didn't understand her or whatever traumatic thing had happened to her. By his mother's tone, he had figured that whatever it was, it was best for him not to ask about it, no matter how curious he was.
"So? What? You like calling me by my original name?" she asked skeptically. "Last night you were telling me that men don't marry one another in this time and now you're getting off on calling me John?"
"Yes, and you need to be since we're going out." Sherlock chuckled, grabbing her usual undergarments and helping her put them on while she adjusted to being awake this early.
With her frankly depressing reality realized, she set to work planning the party. She was going to go as full Martha Stewart as was possible in the time period, she decided, drawing up lots of different ornament designs and really paying attention to the architecture so she could use every element of the house to compliment the decorations, as well as make the decorations accentuate the beauty of the home.
“Ms. Watson, you do say the strangest things. What, pray tell, is a telly?” Molly asked and Jane's expression faltered.
Many of you have expressed interest in a spin-off that goes more in-depth about Jane and Sherlock's children. I am sorry to say I don't anticipate ever writing one, that being said, I hope to go into it quite a bit with this final chapter. I hope you enjoy, and thank you once again for following me on this journey. I never expected the story to get the following it has.
"First of all, look at the detailing of the cravat. It's embroidered with darker blue. Cravats like that tend to be expensive, and unless it was a gift, most people wouldn't be able to afford such a thing. But it's not a gift. How do I know? Because the rest of his ensemble was tailored to match that particular cravat. The edges of his sleeves are embroidered with the same design. Not only that, but it's a small village, he'd have no reason to dress so expensively unless all of his wardrobe looks similar. Now, banker, how did I pinpoint that when there are plenty of other professions that make a fortune enough to afford such an outfit? Easy. The way he carries his money is a give away. Most men, when going to a market like this would simply carry their coins in a pouch on their belt, but this man keeps his pouch, with an intricate fastening, in his jacket; an obvious sign that he is used to treating money with the utmost professional care. Deducing that he's married is by far one of the simpler tasks. The wedding band on his finger speaks volumes as to his eligibility. And the cats? There's a collection of long, white hairs on the back of his jacket, most likely from a Persian. As well as short orange hairs, suggesting a tabby cat. 'Why cats, though, it could just as easily be dogs,' I can practically hear you thinking. Well, back to this man's profession, he's a banker. There's no way he keeps his clothes lying about on the floor and a man of his stature probably wouldn't allow the dog on the furniture. Cats are much harder to control in that regard. It is quite probable that the cats decided to take a nap on his jacket if he left it sitting on a table or the bed. Finally the dog. That one's a little bit trickier. When he was walking past us, I noticed that he had short white hairs on his lower pant legs but not the upper ones. These hairs obviously don't belong to either of the cats since one is long haired with a white coat and the other is short haired with a ginger coat. Add to that the fact that there are no other short white hairs on his ensemble, we can assume that it's a creature that's not as agile as a cat. Since the fur never goes too high up his shin, it must be short in stature, therefore a small dog. Anything I forgot to address?"
"Sherlock, you're forgetting the most important thing about me..." Jane softly cooed, leaning in until her lips were just brushing against his. "Being your wife means that I am your family too."
"You want something to do?" he repeated her statement from earlier with confusion expressed freely on his face.
The next day, Jane could hardly wait to get started. She dressed in a simple brown dress that was less likely to stain should anyone ever come in with a wound that needed stitching and after familiarizing herself with where each supply was kept, she set to sewing as she waited.
"Would you talk to me about it? It seems like you've been holding back because you think no one will believe you." John looked down at the bubbles in the water with lonely eyes.
"Simple. I threatened to be the one to tell his current fiancee about current wife if he didn't." Jim shrugged. "He'll be here, but I doubt he'll be happy. But I'm sure you can calm him down."
"Wow. A term of amazement when you can't think of anything else to say because you are stunned with awe. I keep forgetting that it hasn't caught on yet."
"This wasn't exactly what I had in mind." Sherlock smirked at his mother's response, moving towards her. He knelt in front of her and held her hands in his own.
He returned to the inn for dinner, though he hardly touched the fish and chips that Mrs. Turner, the innkeeper, had worked so painstakingly hard to make for him. It wasn’t that it wasn’t as good as the bangers and mash he had for breakfast, simply that his appetite hadn’t returned yet. He resolved instead to pick at the fried cod and frites with a heavy sigh, forcing himself to take a bite every time he thought Mrs. Turner was watching him.
"I promise I'm not going to do anything to you. But if you insist, wait here and I'll be back in just a moment." he entered his room and came a moment later as he promised, carrying a red satin dress, covered in lace. "This is for you."
"Jane?" Sherlock asked, slowly pulling out of her and laying by her side. He hesitantly rested his arm around her waist.
“Yes… about that…” Jane took a deep breath, but when she opened her eyes and glanced into those shimmering, ever-changing eyes, she didn’t know what to say. “I… um… are you excited about the wedding next week?”
"Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey." Jane cooed with a giant smirk, fingers shifting to prod at his ribs. Sherlock shot up out of bed quickly, glaring at her. She giggled. "Ha! Tickle spot!"
The subsequent days fared no better and before long the trees were all full of bright green leaves and it had been nearly a month since he had found himself trapped in a time that was not his own. He had started to lose hope of ever returning home too.
As always, thank you for your support. I love your feedback, and I will always appreciate your comments and kudos.
“Well, I had always wanted to learn, but my father insisted that singing and pianoforte were a woman’s art.”
"Wait." Jane paused and glanced over her shoulder with raised eyebrows. "Fine. Yes.. I will accept your assistance, I suppose."
"That's a good sign. No slurs." Jane assured, smiling softly. "I recommend you lay here for a while. At least until we're sure all the symptoms are passed."
“Because I won’t get another chance to… You’ll be married next week and in months to follow, I foresee the ruination of my reputation fast approaching…” she said truthfully. “Not that I’ve ever cared much about it, but the rest of the world is not like me in that regard…”
“I can tell whatever it is, it’s serious…” Molly murmured though she didn’t press any further. Instead she simply smiled reassuringly. “Well, until your business is done, I will host you. I know my accommodations aren’t that plentiful…”
"Mr. Moriarty, This is Ms. Jane Watson. She's looking for employment and I thought I would see if you could use a new maid. I'm told she's skilled in cleaning. I believe she would be an excellent addition to the staff."
John didn’t really believe in ghosts. He held it with the same level of skepticism as he did magic and fortune telling. Still, whatever that voice had actually been unnerved him and he decided that though he had intended to wait until morning, he should wander the woods that he had chosen as his final destination.
Virginia spoke a lot about Sherlock and his childhood for Jane's sake. Sherlock spent a majority of the dinner red-faced from embarrassment and fury at his mother for all the anecdotes.
"Hello?" the lady greeted as she opened the door but her face froze with shock as she stared at the unexpected guest.
"Jane... I... welcome back... It's a relief to know that you're safe, even if you can't divulge where you've been." He said, giving a tender but tense smile to her.
The stable door swung open and all the horses in the stable greeted the person walking in with the same raised heads and perked ears that he had been treated to when he entered. He abandoned his thoughts in favor of examining the new person. It was a young lady with mousy brown hair in a simple brown dress, humming as she took a pitchfork and pitched some hay to each of the horses. When she came across the pile of straw that John had taken refuge in, she let out a startled yelp, covering her mouth in surprise.
"Much better after resting. Perhaps it was something I ate that had me feeling unwell." Jane reasoned, climbing the stairs once again and returning fully dressed.
If there was one thing that Jane had not been expecting to see at her doorstep the next day at five in the morning, it was Sherlock Holmes. She blinked a couple times, holding her dressing gown to her frame as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes.
Jane was making her way over to Reichenbach Manor for the next day's work. She expected it to be quiet when she entered the estate. And at first it was. She was quietly closing the door behind her when she heard a calm and collected voice behind her; a voice she hadn't anticipated hearing ever again.
"Mrs. Hudson told me you had an affinity but yours broke a couple years ago and you never got a new one..."
She shimmied her shoulders a bit for show, shifting on her stool and with a dramatic flourish of her arm, drew three cards at random from the deck.
"I thought you were skilled at reading people. I've seen your ability to do so first hand." Jane mused, combing her fingers through his curls.
"Well, I don't want to damage the man's reputation but that is not what I would've prescribed Molly with." Jane murmured thoughtfully, gesturing for Molly to sit on the examination table. Once Molly was situated, Jane's fingers carefully and skillfully felt for the baby.
"Someday... I'll be a little more honest with you..." Jane said this incredibly quietly, cradling his head against her chest. "But I'm kind of terrified of how your view of me will change when you know the truth... that it will be the end between us..."
"In that case, try to pay attention to when you start to feel sick and when you don't, and eat when you don't," she instructed and Molly nodded to show that she understood. "Also, your last physician was probably not aware that exercising daily can make the birthing process easier. Just don't overwork yourself and it will be fine. Walks daily should suffice. The fresh air will help you with any mood swings because you'll be in better spirits."
"To make up for my appalling behavior last time we saw each other and to give as genuine an apology as I am capable of."
I know... I'm late. But on the bright side, I've determined that I can knock a chapter off the count and still fit the content I have planned into what I have left. I can't guarantee that I'll be on time on Sunday either, but I'm going to at least try.
"Hold this in place. Keep the pressure." Jane instructed and Sherlock, with a wince, did as was asked of him. She carefully ripped his shirt away from the wound, pouring a little whiskey on a fresh cloth. "What I would give for an analgesic for you right now."
A man with salt and pepper hair was standing between the two of them and Jane took a moment to take in her surroundings. Every member of staff was watching the two men eagerly but they turned their attention to the man between them as he explained the rules.
"I don't understand, you've been missing... Where have you been?" she asked curiously. Regret passed over Jane's features.
“I can sleep on the floor…” Molly heard Jane say as the mousy brunette guided her guest into the bedroom.
Murray gave a shaky nod, and John carefully scooped the limp man into his arms with a determined grunt. Bill was quite a bit bigger than him in every regard and so every step was a battle in itself as he forced himself forward to the medical tent with his dying best friend in his arms.
“I… um… well… I suppose…” The tailor seemed a little shocked but she nodded her head despite her moral dilemma.
"He told me he loved me, Harry... For the first time, he said it and everything just felt so right..." John was crying again, wiping the tears from his cheeks with a shaky breath.
"I... was wondering... since you're no longer afflicted by last year's incident... if you would mind terribly... um... if we... consummated our marriage..." Sherlock's cheeks were bright red and his words could hardly be heard over the music in the distance.
Sherlock choked on the air he had been inhaling and stared at Mary with a wide-eyed terror evident on his face. He had not considered the consequences of making such a bet but now that they were laid out in front of him so obviously, he was certain that Jane was going to hate him for his fib, maybe even do something worse than sprain his arm. He rubbed his wrist gently, remembering the sensation of pain she had so easily delivered to him. He sighed softly, shoulders straightened as he knocked on the door.
The kiss seemed to ignite something in him because he then took control of it, guiding her to rest on her back. He broke the kiss to trail kisses down her neck, hand slipping under her to undo the numerous buttons that kept her dress in place.
Jane's eyebrows furrowed in confusion, going upstairs and getting changed into something more suitable for the public, climbing down the stairs and gesturing to her outfit.
"I don't see why not. She's your fiance after all." Mary said with a smirk and Sherlock visibly winced.
"Me too, Sherlock." She assured, letting out a rather lewd moan as he shifted angles slightly. Sherlock's pace grew faster and Jane clung to him as he continued to strike something deep inside her.
The third day in a row that her morning had started with the same urge to hurl, Jane couldn't ignore it anymore. And soon two weeks had passed with each morning very much the same. Jane had been ignoring the possibility for too long, trying desperately not to get her hopes up, but there was only one explanation for why she felt better on days when her meals consisted of more bread than anything else, and why she would feel dreadful in the morning and as spry as ever in the afternoon.
"Enjoying the view?" a voice said next to him. People had been trying to talk to him all evening, but this was a voice he could not ignore since it belonged to the lady of the house.
“Alright. I'll stay with you. I'm fine sleeping on the sofa though, no need to share your bed with me.” John answered, smiling politely. “Do you get any good channels on the telly?”
"Don't go telling anyone. I've put a lot of effort into my grumpy and foreboding old man aesthetic." he joked and they both chuckled.
"I may not be considerate enough to respect other people's privacy, Jane, but you are my wife." he murmured, catching her eye. "The exception to all of my coarse behaviors."
They made for the carriage and spent the trip to Mr. Lestrade's home in amicable conversation, often laughing and giggling like little school girls, but inside, Jane felt disappointment well up inside her. Sherlock disliked social gatherings of any sort, and even if he and Mr. Lestrade were best friends, she very much doubted he'd attend, making Molly's master plan fall into disrepair. Still, she didn't want to offend Mr. Lestrade by having none of the Holmes attend his gathering, and Molly had put so much effort into making her look good, it would be a shame not to enjoy this cèilidh.
Hudson spoke. “I had a word with the clerk last night Sir, we’ve rooms engaged at a modest establishment not far from here. Transportation has been arranged and if I’m not mistaken is waiting to convey us from the dock.”
Just as his opponent was about to demand that they get on with the fight; Sherlock came alive and stepped forward to select the first knife. The two alternated until they were both armed with two short, pointed, double-sided daggers. They then raised their knives and stood facing one another.
“We’ve come such a long way!” he started, only to be interrupted by Sherlock who said loftily, “Not at all.  It merely appears that way.  It’s an effect of the heat; it makes distances appear far greater than they are.”
With Sherlock's move the fight was over. The gang members muttered uncomfortably between them, seemingly unsure of what had happened to cause their leader to lose the match so quickly and so thoroughly. And their Master of the Knives was certainly beaten: the serious wound in his shoulder streamed freely with blood and his arm hung uselessly at his side as he spit and glared at Sherlock with his chest heaving.
Now, looking at the sea, he chided himself severely. He would have to be far more careful in the future, if he was to keep his feelings for Lord Holmes a secret! And that Lord Holmes should learn of them was unthinkable; they must remain his secret forever, however difficult that may be.
Preparations complete, Hudson and John joined Lord Holmes once more in his cabin where John marveled at what chameleon the man was. In the borrowed uniform, he looked exactly like a privileged middle-ranked sailor; the proud employee of the British nobility. The bandage helped of course, he managed to project just the right degree of wounded dignity, suggesting surprise at the notion of actually having sustained an injury while carrying out his duties. Hudson too appeared no longer to be the versatile and invaluable valet of an English aristocrat, but a grizzled old sailor, fortunate enough to spend his last years at sea in the relative ease and comfort of a rich man's private yacht. For his part, John doubted whether he looked at all convincing as a cabin boy and resolved to try harder to appear wide-eyed, eager and excited to be involved in such an adventure at sea.
Now − in contrast to his cool, pale appearance Sherlock Holmes had the sort of physique that continually radiated warm energy (which was the likely reason he shed excess clothing constantly and rarely felt the need for blankets or nightshirts…) so it was almost instantly that John's subconscious alerted him to unexpected warmth and comfort and he started to wake in confusion.
The feeling was extraordinary! How wonderful it felt to hold John! Sherlock felt a strong possessiveness sweep over him bringing with it the certainty that only he could comfort John in this desperate state. So he held him tightly, clasping his icy, trembling body to his own, stroking his wet cheeks and tucking John's shaking hands firmly against his chest. Murmuring nonsense and patting his back clumsily, he tried to stem the anguish that was welling up and overwhelming John.
John couldn't have asked for a more tender nurse than Hudson. Full of trepidation at first, he soon calmed as he was helped out of his clothes and assisted to bathe with solemn dignity. The wounds on his back were tended with ointment and bandages. He was then swathed in a far too-long night-shirt made of a softer material than he could have imagined existed, Lord Holmes' no doubt John realized to his discomfort, feeling he shouldn't be wearing his Lordship's night clothes. But when he expressed this worry to Hudson, it was simply met with an aggrieved, "Better that someone should get some use out of it."
