John raised an eyebrow despite himself, impressed. He didn't have to say anything, he knew that, but something inside him compelled him to say, ’You speak French and English fluently already?’
‘William?’ Charlotte said in surprise. ‘His name’s Sherlock! Who are you, anyway? Random women were not allowed inside the palace in my day.’
James wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist. He’s smaller than Sherlock, his forehead resting on the back of his shoulder, and Sherlock closes his eyes. ‘James…’
Sherlock rolled over and threw his left arm over his face. He would convince them he had to stay. They wouldn’t make him go. They
with her. Everything is working out just as John wanted: Mary has no idea, Sherlock is completely under his thumb and the rush is getting better and better.
Sherlock had begged and pleaded that she might be stopped from coming but William had not changed his mind. On the day that she had arrived, almost a year ago, Sherlock had been smartened up and forced to wait at the back door for this random person who would apparently make him act more like a King whilst Archie and Mycroft cackled from the top of the stairs.
The public couldn't find out, their families couldn't find out, their friends couldn't find out, but Sherlock was totally worth it.
John’s hand moved Sherlock’s head so they were eye to eye, noses brushing against each other. John’s eyes filled Sherlock’s vision, and he said breathlessly, ‘Did you know that your eyes are the exact colour of a springtime sky?’
‘Which balcony?’ Sherlock said innocently, batting his eyelashes at his brother. ‘There are lots of balconies, Mycroft.’
‘John. John Ke- Watson.’ After their Dad had left, Harry had been adamant that they change their last names to their mother’s. John had been reluctant (he still hoped, wished,
‘Another stupid idea, Lestrade,’ Sherlock replied, not turning around. ‘Just what I expected from you.’ The note idea, however, had been quite good, and Sherlock made a mental note to add it to his list when he got home. He was fast running out of time and it seemed like the best option out of a bad lot.
He walks to Baker Street slowly, and when he reaches that familiar green door he doesn't bother knocking. Sherlock gave him a new key a few months previously, and John uses this to unlock the door. He walks up the stairs, opens the front door, and walks to Sherlock’s bedroom.
‘Prison, Mary Morstan, skip.’ John sat back. ‘What are you studying? Where is your family? Who was that boy?’
‘What, Sherlock? What do you want me to say? What do you want me to do that I’m not already doing?’ His voice was rising, and Sherlock wasn't sure if he preferred it like that or not (he didn't really have a choice, really) but John was staring at him like…
There was a sudden huffing sound and a hand came over the roof. Janine jerked backwards in fear but Sherlock’s head soon popped up, grinning from ear to ear, four wine bottles in his left hand. ‘Regarde, bitches,’ he crowed. ‘Four bottles of my father’s finest wine. You’re welcome.’
‘The Witch?’ Victor asked. Sherlock glared at his friend. ‘It’s what everyone calls Morag, Vic. Continue, Michael.’
: who else will read it? It’s addressed to about a fortnight earlier and it’s obviously been there a while because it’s soggy and the envelope is growing mould. Arthur doesn't mind, though, and he reads it as he leans against Sherlock’s gravestone.
Sherlock stiffens, but does not turn around. The voice, that velvety tone with the delicious accent, as soft as a summer’s day. The voice that has been with Sherlock for eighty years: first as colleagues, and then as companions, and now…
Why Sherlock had allowed that, he would never know. But it was too late now, and as much as Sherlock tried to convince himself he had been happy alone, it had been nothing compared to how he felt whenever John was with him. He was far too selfish to send John Watson away now: he didn't think he would be able to live through that. The risk of John getting hurt didn't even outweigh the thought of banishing him- Sherlock could never do that to John.
Sherlock pushed James off him with all of his strength James grunted and stared at him in shock. ‘What-‘
Sherlock stopped outside Bart’s and glanced at Victor. ‘Are you going to go and chat up those motorcycle boys?’ He said, nodding at the group of youths on the other side of the square.
‘Close,’ Mycroft supplied. ‘The country, the nation, the world, even, is not ready for an openly gay King with a partner, and we have to keep it a secret. It’s a miracle that none of the staff have leaked.’ He glared at Sherlock, who rolled his eyes and sighed; he hadn’t meant for his staff to find out. It hadn’t really occurred to him to be subtle as he and John made out in the back of his car.
John took a deep breath and reminded himself he was being idiotic. He had replaced Sherlock with Mary; why shouldn’t Sherlock move on? John had dumped Sherlock; Sherlock hadn’t dumped John.
‘Nah.’ Harry corrected. ‘I like pussy, don’t I? The closest I could get would be if I had a sordid affair with Queen Patricia.’
‘My mother.’ Sherlock had replied simply. His mother had loved taking him to the studio, teaching him complicated sequences before he performed them to Mycroft. That was why Mycroft liked watching him dance, Sherlock thought; as he watched his brother dance, his older brother could imagine the woman who had given him a family again there as well, dancing with her son.
Molly was inspecting his letters now and Sherlock had already puffed himself up for the praise that he knew would follow. ‘So…what do you think?’
Rosie batted her big blue eyes and flicked her reddish-brown hair behind her shoulder, glancing at Lestrade. ‘Oh, it’s fine. I’ve seen worse.’
Why had John told himself it was the right decision, over and over, when the phone calls and text messages had stopped?
Molly dropped the plate and pulled Sherlock away from the oven; the flames were growing, intense heat directed straight at them. ‘WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?’ She shouted, grabbing a tea towel and flapping them at the oven.
‘I am, John.’ Sherlock said. He wasn’t being demanding, he didn't sound like he was trying to convince John that what he was saying was true; he just sounded resigned, which John hated even more. ‘I always have been. I let myself get close to you, I let myself fall in love with you and you with me even though I knew you’d end up getting hurt and I’m sorry, John, I was selfish, I was so selfish.’
John tried to stand up, but the moment his head was above the cart he heard a gunshot. The bullet whistled past his ear; Becca pulled him down.
John’s father cleared his throat and Sherlock turned around, surveying the man. Out of all of them, he was the most interesting to read; he was at least two inches smaller than Sherlock but he was releasing an aura of authority so strong it made even Sherlock feel submissive. This man would have been an excellent soldier, Sherlock thought.
once or twice, but now it seemed as if Sherlock was back and why the sound of John addressing him by his full name was so appealing Sherlock had no idea but oh, he didn't care, because he
James rolled his eyes. ‘You’re being dramatic, dear. As to why I came back, I missed you, Sherly, and I thought it was about time. You’ve certainly…matured.’ Jim licked his lips and raised an eyebrow suggestively. ‘And I’m sure you’ve learnt plenty of new…tricks that I’d be more than willing to try out with you-‘
Sherlock pulled a face. ‘Love is stupid. It makes people into fools. Mycroft was fun before he met Lestrade, and now he’s mature and boring and wouldn't row or swim with me anymore, even when Lestrade
‘You loved him?’ John said, eyes blinking back tears. ‘I bet you still do, don’t you? I’m not enough for you, am I? Too ordinary, too boring, too stupid, too common-‘
John, who was standing to attention by the door as straight as possible and looking directly forwards, shouted back, ‘Sir?’
For his height, John was big. Six point one inches in length and extremely wide, he had had doubts that Sherlock would be able to take it, originally.
Except, John thought, it was exactly like him and Sherlock. Every time he looked at Sherlock he didn't seem able to breathe, every time Sherlock talked he was caught, even if it was about the most boring thing in the world (243 types of ash, even), every time they touched John felt those electric sparks.
Henry sighed, looking John directly in the eye. ‘I left because I met someone else, John.’ He paused and smiled again, eyes crinkling, and as they did thousands of memories flooded back into John’s mind: skiing holidays, Christmases, birthdays,
He was with some other people, obviously; Mike Stamford, James Sholto and Sebastian Wilkes, but Sherlock didn't see them. All he saw was John.
‘Stay there!’ Jim shouted, dark eyes flashing. ‘Stay right there!’ The hand on Sherlock’s back twitched slightly and John halted, eyes fixed on Sherlock.
John opened his mouth, ready to ask what Sherlock meant when he said later; was he saying he wanted to see John again? Was he asking to be John’s friend? Had he actually made friends with a Prince in a coffee shop? Then he decided better of it. From what he had heard, from what he had read, Sherlock had no need for friends. Especially not ordinary, average-Joes like John.
The small blond man knocked back the tequila he was holding and smiled blurrily. He was highly intoxicated, much more than Sherlock, and Sherlock wasn’t exactly sober at this point. ‘Hey,’ the man grinned, pressing himself closer to Sherlock and pressing his hands on his waist. Sherlock felt a small shock through his clothes but dismissed it as the drink: nowadays, stimulants always had a slightly off effect on him. He peered at the man closely, but his deductions were slightly off and all he could really tell was that the man was training to be a surgeon, was a fan of physical activity and was about twenty-two, which was three years older than Sherlock.
He didn't think he had the capacity to love but he does, he so clearly does, because he has never felt like this before. Even the thrill doesn't seem important anymore because Sherlock is
And went down on John so fast he could barely see it. Sherlock’s mouth, sucking and licking the head of his dick, his hand moving furiously around the shaft-
His father laughed and patted his head and John smiled in delight. Even three years after he’d come back, John felt a spark of joy whenever he saw his father.
There was a roaring sound in John’s ears, so loud he couldn’t hear what they were saying. He wanted to collapse; only sheer will-power kept him standing, because he would not fall down in front of all these people after what they’d done to him and, more importantly, to Sherlock. He couldn’t see anything but Morag, that fucking woman just smirking at him as his world collapsed.
Barely catching himself on his hands as his arms and knees buckled, Sherlock braced his cheek against John’s thigh and lapped at his cock. He teased the rim with his lips, tongue delving into the slit before he took the head in his mouth and sucked with John growling around his own erection. They went on like that for unheeded minutes, balanced between a delicious give and take as Sherlock struggled to focus and keep himself from orgasming too soon.
When it finally ended, Sherlock fell rag-doll limp and collapsed in a shuddering heap on John’s body. He clung to John’s thighs, eyes unfocused and half-closed, mouth dropping open around the force of his desperate gasping for the air that had vacated his lungs in a wild rush. Even as he came down from the surge of hormones, Sherlock was distantly aware that John had worked a fourth finger into him. The powerful stretch made him groan and ride out waves of overstimulation.
John kissed the same way he pursued his career: relentlessly. His hands moved over Sherlock’s neck, palms skating along his jaw and upward. Sinking his fingers into Sherlock’s glitter-festooned curls, John tugged him closer and deepened the kiss at the same time, stealing Sherlock’s already depleted breath. He overwhelmed Sherlock much in the same way he had slipped into Sherlock’s life — seamlessly, like he’d belonged there all along. The kiss was a claiming, the leaving of an invisible mark, John’s mouth moving eagerly, urgently, against his own.
But John’s shifting appearance wasn’t the only considerations made for his half-demonic side. There were specific rules they had to follow whenever they were intimate, concessions that kept Sherlock safe from John’s secondary and devouring nature. Such concessions went beyond the typical necessity of lubrication and condoms. Instead, they followed two tenets of safety in the bedroom. These two tenets stated that John must be restrained during intercourse, with the aid of heavy chains they’d purchased for this exact reason, and that Sherlock must top. In this way, they controlled John’s ability to absorb life force from Sherlock in the throes of passion, limiting him to controlled sipping of sexual energy instead.
But now, a man sat on his futon. A man who chuckled when Sherlock told him about his childhood experiments. Who thought his room was ‘minimalistic.’ Who didn’t seem to mind that Sherlock did weird science in his free time or that he slept on a futon. John seemed kind. Worse, John was
case is none of your concern,” Sherlock replied. His teeth were beginning to ache, clenched as they were. His words sounded strained, forced out through them.
“Definitely condolences, then,” John said, nodding gravely as Sherlock led the way into his flat. “And I thought having a twin sister was bad.”
John. The thought reminded Sherlock of earlier and how he’d willingly lost himself to John’s overwhelming presence. He felt a flicker of guilt as Mycroft continued to hold his gaze, waiting for Sherlock to process the impact of his words.
Resolutely keeping his hands to himself — and off himself — Sherlock dried, primped, dressed and prepared for the day. Left without the means to distract his wandering mind, he did a load of laundry, cleaned the flat, and gritted his teeth against such an uncharacteristic use of his time. But Sherlock's mind was too distracted to allow him to focus on anything scientific. Not even his latest experiment or his new books could tug his mind away from the allure of over-processing the moment he’d woken in John’s arms. Mycroft would be pleased to see his younger brother tending to his home, and that thought only served to sharpen the flavour of Sherlock’s darkening mood. Once, when he was younger and far less in control of himself, Sherlock would have turned to something meant to obliterate his mind. He would have lost himself in the fire-song of vein-burning, quicksilver indulgence.
After stewing over the problem of John Watson for an hour, Sherlock forced himself to unbend from his tense position in the chair and took himself off to shower. He didn’t dwell beneath the water. Instead, he washed with perfunctory hands and ignored the hopeful twitch of his cock, which stirred despite the pleasure Sherlock had wrung from himself mere hours ago.
Doing as requested, Sherlock only just managed to brace his knees on either side of John’s torso before hands seized his backside and pulled him down and back. He went with a cry of surprise that quickly morphed into a long, drawn-out moan as John’s mouth fastened on his hole. The sheets were slick with John’s blood, the wound still weeping unchecked, but Sherlock didn’t notice. He was too caught up in the sensation of John’s lips on his most tender area, on the flickering slide of John’s forked tongue as it first nudged, then pressed, then breached his rim.
“Thought you’d like it,” the bartender said. He opened his mouth to say more, but one of the other men behind the bar appeared at his shoulder, interrupting them.
“Your sibling is much worse than mine,” John replied. Still sitting on the futon, he made no effort to dress. “All Harry does is lose herself at the bottom of any wine bottle she can find. It’s not great, but at least she doesn’t meddle in my life.”
Instead, he returned to the task at hand. Gently tugging at Sherlock’s curls to tilt his head back, John exposed the underside of Sherlock’s throat and jaw as he angled the blade at the edge of the lather. With the heel of his hand pressed against Sherlock’s skin to steady his grip, John felt the subtle twitch of muscle underneath as Sherlock swallowed again, his breath catching. Rather than let that strange, slight stutter catch him off guard again, John swiped the blade up, taking the last of the lather with it in one smooth, rasping stroke.
The feeling lasted for all of an hour, dashed to bits the second Sherlock walked into his flat and encountered the futon. The unassuming piece of furniture had become a constant reminder of the source for his nerves — John Watson himself. He stared at it, alarmed to find the anxiety returning.
Sherlock stared at that little pink glimpse, quickly looking away when John set aside his pen and sat upright to stretch out his shoulders. Heart hammering wildly in his chest, Sherlock blinked down at a petri dish, wondering, yet again, what was wrong with him. Why had he invited John to his flat? In the moment, it had seemed like Sherlock had no choice once he’d uttered the invitation. Now, listening to John turning pages behind him, Sherlock felt like he’d gone mad. He was stunned by his own bold behaviour. He never invited people to his flat, be they friends or strangers — and he didn’t even really
“The devil himself,” Sherlock snapped, nudging out from under John and reaching for the phone. The screen was lit up with a series of texts. As Sherlock held the phone, another came in, the device pinging in his hand.
Sherlock woke with a start. One minute, he was deep asleep, and the next, he was blinking at the sunlight spilling through the narrow window over his desk. Sherlock rubbed a hand over his face and turned his head with a wince. His fingers brushed something on his cheek, and he pulled at the offending object. Staring at a PH test strip — apparently, his skin was rather acidic today — Sherlock blinked blearily and tried to make sense of the world. His eyes landed on the glassware scattered over the desk, and it clicked into place. He’d fallen asleep at his desk. Not exactly unusual for him, but he’d been getting better at sleeping on the futon.
John was still standing by the door, but his shoes were off to one side, and he had his coat in his hand. He looked a little lost, looking around the flat as if uncertain where his eyes should land. When they finally alighted upon Sherlock’s bare torso, they lingered, obvious as a physical brand on Sherlock’s skin. A confused expression of something that could have been yearning flitted over John’s face, the emotion tempered by his evident exhaustion. Still, he remained standing by the door, his wet jacket leaving intermittent drips on the floorboards.
The bathroom door opened, humid air rushing out to fill the small flat, fogging the windows. The steam clung to the thick atmosphere with the tenacity of an unwanted guest, the silence finally broken by John’s overly casual and out-of-tune whistling. He emerged in the wake of the steam, water droplets gleaming on his skin, and a towel slung around his waist, looking for all the world like he hadn’t a care in the world. His hair was damp, clinging to his scalp and glistening, and Sherlock’s mouth went dry as he turned to watch his approach. The slow sway of John’s hips as he made his unconcerned way to the futon reminded Sherlock sharply of how John had discarded his clothing on the way into the bathroom. Those clothes, retrieved, now lay folded neatly over John’s arm.
Sherlock stuck his head out of the shower again. “And how am I supposed to help with that? I hardly frequent the same establishments as your staff members. As you no doubt recall, I was rather rudely thrown out of your oh so prestigious club for daring to speak.”
Still watching him closely, Mycroft’s lips pursed. “I won’t be able to help you if you do,” he replied, any sign of his earlier flippant manner banished in the face of the seriousness between them.
“Of course,” John said, his voice sounding level but somehow odd. Brittle. “I’ll just…” He gestured at the clothes slung over his arm. “I’ll just go get dressed, then I’ll be out of your hair.” Saying so, he turned on his heel and walked back into the bathroom. His quickened gait was a far cry from the lazy, confident saunter he’d affected upon his earlier appearance.
Sherlock stared back at him, his mouth popping open in shock. It was a moment before he could respond, which Mycroft took as a delay. He gave Sherlock a slight shake and repeated the question, demanding, “Well? Have you?”
Somewhere between watching the sun set and letting his mind wander, Sherlock slipped into a light doze. He drifted, aimless and without concern, mind caught between waking and sleep states.
“I may have handled a gun far more than a blade, but that doesn’t mean I won’t accidentally lop off your ear if you don’t
“Mm,” Sherlock hummed, letting his voice take on the velvety quality he knew drove John wild. Predictably, John’s eyes darkened, his pupils widening in the dark. “On the contrary, my dear Watson. I am nothing but satisfied.
Shorter than Sherlock, with his sandy-blonde hair mussed into chaos, he looked up at Sherlock with vividly blue eyes and a slight, confused frown. Bright as that gaze was, it was somewhat dulled by the dark, deep shadows beneath, etched into golden skin. Even so, he was an admittedly attractive specimen, and Sherlock felt his tongue fumble as his mind went blank.
Which brought them to that morning, to John’s day off from the surgery. He'd been woken just shy of six am by a petulant Sherlock, who had insisted that his stubble had grown far too coarse to abide any longer. He’d stood — loomed, more like — over John as John blinked the sleep from his eyes and watched Sherlock scratch agitatedly at his stubbly jaw, chin and cheeks. Now, here they were, with John making a valiant effort to shave Sherlock’s face while Sherlock squirmed with the force of five hundred angry snakes.
Sherlock shot him a smirk and ducked back into the shower. “What does this have to do with me? If you know he’s selling secrets, why not arrest him?”
A loud noise echoed through the dark, the sound vibrations making the fog ripple, wisps eddying around him in teasing whips. The mist thickened, turned thick, vicious, suffocating. Sherlock grabbed at the mysterious substance, feeling it trickle between his spread fingers, cold as ice water.
He made it halfway there before the building’s front door opened behind him. Sherlock paused and looked over his shoulder, staggering to a stop at the sight of John. He looked exhausted. Deep shadows once more darkened his eyes, messenger bag bumping against his hip as he passed a hand over his fatigue-lined face.
The bartender nodded in silent understanding. “Been there,” he sighed, pouring the shaken concoction into a tall glass. “It happens to the best of us. Working here certainly helped me get back on the horse.” His lips twitched at the innuendo. “As they say.” Looking up again, the bartender plunked a black straw into the drink and offered it to Sherlock. “Try that. On the house.”
John, tugging Sherlock’s bottom lip into his mouth with his teeth, released the swollen flesh and dropped his forehead against Sherlock’s. “What,” he said in a strained voice, “the fuck?”
But it was too late for second thoughts. The door swung open, and John reappeared with his arms full of heavy books. Sherlock tilted his head to read the spines.
“Are you sure?” John said, breaking away until their lips barely brushed with the shape of his cautious words.
The bartender’s smile looked a little closer to genuine, his dark brown eyes softening as he closed the distance between them by another few inches. “Nothing old about that face,” he said, smooth as velvet.
Forcing a smile he hoped looked inviting, Sherlock nodded. “Tomorrow night suits me just fine,” he said, swallowing around a suddenly tight throat when John’s lips parted in a wide grin.
Kissing John when he was in the midst of his transformation was always interesting, a balance of avoiding the sharpened teeth while trying to delve as deep as he could. Sherlock licked into John’s mouth, tasted his exultant gasp and following growl, their tongues sliding together as John tilted his head back. His tongue — long and thin and forked — caressed the inside of Sherlock’s cheek, making Sherlock wriggle his hips in response. The movement brought John’s cock up against his inner thigh, and John bucked upwards at once, breaking the kiss as he gasped again.
“That’s fantastic,” John crowed before sighing. “Seriously, I’m really going to owe you one. You’ve no idea how much help this is.”
Yes, John was a distraction. Possibly not one Sherlock could afford to indulge when he had the formidable weight from a case of such importance resting on his shoulders. But John wasn’t something he wanted to cast aside. Sherlock wanted both, the urge to have both success and John blending into a confusion myriad of desire in his stomach.
With a smug smile on his face, Sherlock flicked his sex-mussed curls away from his face. “And don’t you forget it,” he admonished and bent to kiss the laughter from John’s mouth.
John stared at him for a moment, then let out an incredulous laugh that sounded closer to a bark than a human sound. “You’re serious.”
Sherlock shifted, forcing protesting, tired muscles to obey as he rolled onto his back. There was John, sprawled next to him on the bed. He looked almost entirely human, save for the raised nubs on his forehead and the tail curled neatly along his hip. He was naked, cock soft and resting along his inner thigh, golden skin bare and perfectly smooth over his abdomen. There was no remaining trace of a scar where John had taken the bullet in his stomach.
Heaving an annoyed sigh, Sherlock staggered up from the futon and crossed to where John stood. He took the jacket from John and hung it on a peg next to the door. Without speaking, Sherlock began to work the buttons of John’s dress shirt open, and John came to life under his touch with a startled sputter.
Hands clenched at his sides, Sherlock stalked to the window. He stared down at the streets below, lips pursed as he tried to regain control. Silence echoed behind him. For once, his brother — overbearing, obstinate Mycroft — didn’t seem to have a ready response. The quiet dragged out, weighted, suffocating.
Lost for words, Sherlock grabbed for his laptop and hunched over it as he grappled with this new realization. He’d never had a real friend before and had no idea how to handle the situation.
Sherlock took a moment to appreciate how it felt to have someone actually care about his mental state before getting a hold of himself. It wouldn’t do any good for him to be caught staring. Instead of returning to the email that had briefly unnerved him, Sherlock set the laptop aside and reached for the book he’d cracked open earlier in the day. It was easy to lose himself in his reading, and time passed without comment between them.
he wondered, brow furrowed. It wasn’t like his place was much quieter than here, and he didn’t exactly make a habit of hosting. His place was small, a bachelor flat comprised of one room and a small bathroom. There wasn’t much else besides an open kitchenette, a desk, and a futon that doubled as both sofa and bed. There was one chair, old and leather, and Sherlock’s favourite place to perch. What was he thinking, inviting someone — a
Some distant, remaining speck of rationality in Sherlock’s mind said he should be scared. Maybe even terrified, repulsed, horrified. But this was John, monstrous or not. And he knew John, knew and trusted him like he knew the periodic table by heart, trusted him the way Sherlock trusted the sun to rise at the end of every night. And, with that in mind, Sherlock cried out with delight instead of fear when John pounced upon him.
Against his better judgement, caught up in the sudden and strange intimacy of the moment, Sherlock felt drawn forward. He drifted closer and was pleasantly pleased when John scooted nearer as well, his eyes searching Sherlock’s before dropping to Sherlock’s mouth.
But not now. Now, Sherlock was a different man. All of that was behind him. It had to be if Sherlock planned to survive long enough to see his dream of detective work materialize into something tangible. Real. More than the simple desire to make a name for himself.
John’s mouth compressed into a thin line, his expression suddenly hard to read. “I see,” he said, something pensive lingering in his face. “What am I doing here, Sherlock?”
“Sure. Of course,” Sherlock said sombrely, his hands folded behind his back. “Anytime.” The offer had barely emerged from his mouth when Sherlock frowned, wondering again at his own boldness.
His mouth suddenly dry, Sherlock stared at the phone. Briefly, he wondered what he’d gotten himself into by reaching out like this. He wondered if he had leapt from the fire into the proverbial frying pan. But it was too late to take the messages back, and Sherlock desperately needed someone removed from the situation.
Sherlock tried not to flinch at the cautious tone. “Morning,” he repeated in kind, swallowing nervously. It seemed that all of his bravado from the night before had fled, banished by the cold light of day and the watchful expression on John’s pillow-creased face.
Sherlock popped his head out from behind the shower curtain and cocked an eyebrow. “You? Mistaken? I beg of you, Mycroft — say it isn’t so. My fragile heart surely cannot handle the shock.” His voice dripped with sarcasm as water ran down his damp face.
In short, Sherlock knew himself to be good for a quick suck or a quicker fuck — never for more, and certainly not good enough for prolonged friendship. It was in this isolation that he’d developed his self-enforced motto: Alone protects me.
And, if not, then he might just be the key to Sherlock finding out some much-needed information on the club and his target.
Moving to the sink on shaky legs, Sherlock washed his sticky hands with desperation and splashed water on his flushed cheeks. After drying hands and face with a flannel, he tucked himself back into his pants, refastened his trousers, and braced himself to face John before slipping out of the bathroom.
Rubbing an absent hand over the front of a wrinkled t-shirt, the man cocked his head to one side. “Are you here for the party?” When Sherlock didn’t reply, still regaining his wits, the man stuck out an awkward hand and added, “I’m John. I don’t think we’ve met.”
Caught off guard by the entire situation, Sherlock took a moment to grapple with his stunned tongue before he could manage a reply. “No,” he said, a little too forcefully. Trying on a pained, awkward smile, he softened his voice and tried again. “No, no, it’s fine. You don’t need to leave.” Sherlock paused, struggling with the proper etiquette. He came up with nothing. “Ah… would you like to come in?” he finally said, stepping aside and gesturing at the tiny flat.
John came quicker this time despite the slower pace, filling Sherlock with pulse after pulse of hot seed. Sherlock was too out of his mind with sensation to track how long it went on for, his own body gone limp from several more orgasms of his own. He felt like he was floating, his eyes refusing to focus as John shifted beneath him. Under his cheek, the skin of John’s chest and abdomen felt smooth, blood-smeared but perfectly unharmed.
John held perfectly still, waiting to see what Sherlock might do, expecting him to pull away and rush off back to his experiment. But he did neither, sitting perfectly still — save for the tiny shivers twitching through his body — under John’s touch.
Sherlock scanned the write-up, his annoyance quickly falling away as his intrigue grew. As always, the promise of casework inspired a sweet sense of anticipation, and Sherlock devoured the facts as theories slotted into place within his racing mind. Lost to that thrill, he almost didn’t recognize the name of the nightclub.
Sherlock, catching on at once, nodded. Of course, John couldn’t go to the hospital with inhuman blood filling his veins — and, currently, spilling from the bullet wound in his abdomen. They couldn’t reach out to other demon-kind either, those as rare as John, and most viewing John as a half-breed bastard. It was a terrible realization, leaving Sherlock frozen in place, staring at the dark blood welling up between John’s fingers where he kept his hand pressed against the wound.
“John Watson,” John replied, taking the hand with a confused look at Sherlock. “You must be… Sherlock’s brother?” he hazarded a guess.
Letting his head fall back, Sherlock closed his eyes and lost himself to the moment once more. The sound of his phone faded into the background until it, blissfully, jangled into silence. He breathed a sigh of relief, hands roving over John’s shifting hips as John’s mouth fastened on his collarbone with hard, sucking pressure.
Shoving his face into the pillow, Sherlock shook his head and didn’t answer. John didn’t seem to be deterred by his silence.
. He wanted to experience sex with John with the roles reversed. Topping was enjoyable in its way, with that sweet, hot sink of flesh into flesh that always made his toes curl. But Sherlock ached to know how it felt to have John within him. To feel John’s dauntingly large cock threatening to split him open. It was a beautiful thing, John’s cock. Inhuman even when John looked his least demonic, it was far larger than average, curved and deep red in tone. Despite the blood-flush colour, it was cold to the touch, studded with fleshy barbs at the base where it grew thick at the root. Sherlock’d had it in his hands, his mouth, and, once, driving between his tightly clenched thighs with John chained and straining at the ends of his tethers.
your miserable mood can both sod off,” John grumbled, biting back harsher words and making a concerted effort to soften his reprimand.
John followed him inside once the door opened. “I didn’t know eleven-year-olds conducted scientific experiments.”
Mouth twisting into an inviting moue, Sherlock dropped his eyes to the countertop and flicked his fingers over a nearly invisible imperfection. Taking care to peer at the man from beneath the dark fall of his lashes, Sherlock replied, “I’m old news, I’m afraid — just been out of the scene for longer than I care to admit.” He kept his voice pitched low, the closeness of their positions barely allowing his words to carry.
satisfied.” He brushed a hand over the bruises marring his skin, toes curling at the faint, aching echo his touch provoked. “I have been ‘well-fucked,' I think you’d say.”
Clearing his throat, Sherlock straightened his spine and pasted a bland expression on his face. The touch of John’s lips lingered on his skin, slightly damp and hot as a brand. As he pulled the cold facade about himself, inwardly wincing as he did so, John seemed to realize that something was amiss. He stiffened and leaned back, his dark eyes searching Sherlock’s face. Sherlock glanced at him, nearly grimaced at the wounded flicker that passed over John’s face. Despite his best efforts, the corners of his lips tugged down in a hint of a moue.
“Don’t argue, Sherlock. This isn’t up for discussion.” John’s voice rang with commanding force, a soldier all over again. “We do this with the chains, or we don’t do this at all. I’ll find someone else if I have to.”
Sherlock’s lips parted around a sigh that sounded both startled and strained, the tension in his face first intensifying, then easing slowly, as John repeated the motion. He stroked Sherlock’s throat in slow, smooth passes, his work-roughened skin catching briefly on the damp terrain. Under his fingertips, pressed below Sherlock’s jaw, John felt the soft vibration of Sherlock’s whimper, voiced from deep within his throat.
By the time he surfaced from his cleaning binge, the flat was spotless. It was a shocking change from its usual appearance of a dusty, neglected state of being. His place was flawless, but his mind was still unsettled.
The corner of John’s mouth twitched upward in a wry smile. “One could,” he agreed. He remained on the futon, watching Sherlock dress with an appreciative gaze.
Sherlock lifted his shoulders in a slight shrug, the gesture made awkward by the fact he was lying on his side, facing John. “Nothing concrete. Not yet, at least.”
Looking up, John caught Sherlock’s eye and dropped his hand back to his side. “Sherlock?” he said, bemused, his forehead creasing in a slow frown. His eyes skated over Sherlock, taking him in from head to toe, taking in his rumpled, skin-tight clothing. “Are you just getting in?”
“Er, not interrupting, am I?” he asked, breaking the hovering silence that had fallen over the three of them.
“Sherlock? Are you even listening to me?” Despite the pain and fatigue in John’s voice, there was an edge of irritation that made Sherlock shake his head and snap back to the moment.
This time, he and John sat on the futon, eating side by side off of Sherlock’s new plates. Though Sherlock had expected to lose some of the intimacy he’d experienced when they dined together at the counter, this was somehow better. The futon was small, and their thighs pressed together whenever either of them moved. John ate left-handed, making their elbows and shoulders jostle as they ate. Whereas Sherlock would typically find the situation aggravating with anyone else, with John, it felt natural. Peaceful. The easy comfort made Sherlock’s mind whirl, made his face burn as he forced himself to focus on his meal until the plate was clean.
Sherlock replied with a vibrating moan, his back arching in exultation as John’s cock leaked on his inner thigh. “John,” he whispered, voice breaking with the force of his need. As if understanding that unspoken desire, John nuzzled the underside of his jaw and smiled his sharp grin.
Scowling, Sherlock opened his mouth to retort, words fading as the shower turned on in the bathroom. Closing his mouth, he watched his brother’s eyes dart toward the sound, his forehead creased by a brief frown, there and gone, fleeting. Mycroft’s features hardened, and Sherlock smirked.
A flush rose in his face, warmth travelling up Sherlock’s neck and blooming in his cheeks, darkening the longer the silence drew out between them.
“Never realized you were so sensitive,” John murmured, awed and hardly noticing the blurred lines of their friendship passing them both by. Sherlock seemed even less cognizant of the change, head tilted back as he pressed into John’s touch, offering and baring his throat in a shocking display of trust.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say that was patently impossible but closed it with a click when John dropped back onto the futon next to him. Their knees knocked together, and John grinned before grabbing one of the texts he’d brought with him.
The words hit Sherlock like an arrow, lodging in his chest as he sucked in a furious breath. Bristling, he surged to his feet. The covers fell from around his shoulders, slipping to the floor and leaving him clad in nothing but his rumpled, day-old clothing. But it didn’t matter what he was wearing or that his hair was still sleep-mussed. What mattered was that Mycroft had barged into his flat, uninvited and unwanted, to interrupt one of the few good things in Sherlock’s life. A new good thing, but good nonetheless. Something that possibly could have been wonderful, given a chance to prosper, grow, and bloom into more. Now, that opportunity could very well be gone, snuffed out by Mycroft’s influence and the apathy his person inspired in his younger brother. Sherlock, who hadn’t had many chances for good things in his life, felt himself snap. Like a brittle branch, something cracked inside him, straight down the middle.
“I believe it was a conspiracy,” Sherlock said sombrely, fishing for his keys as they reached his door. “I was eleven — I think my nanny may have been behind the sabotage. By all accounts, I became rather… cranky the longer the experiment lasted. I think she was at her wit’s end.”
“You know I only pry because I care,” Mycroft protested, stopping before the door even as Sherlock tried to wrestle it open around him.
Both of John’s eyebrows rose now, and he looked like he might speak. Instead, his eyes dropped, his gaze tracking over Sherlock’s bare upper arm, peeking out from the edge of the covers. They followed the line of his shoulder to his neck, where they lingered. “You have a mole,” John said unexpectedly, making Sherlock blink.
The man grinned and winked. “I’ll do my best,” he promised, turning to grab a blue bottle off the shelf. Eyes focused on his hands as he mixed ingredients in a golden cocktail shaker, he asked, “What brings you back to
John frowned, looking at him for a tense spell before turning to Sherlock. He didn’t speak, simply waited expectantly for Sherlock to say something. But he remained silent, and, once again, Mycroft took the initiative.
Sherlock allowed the compliment with an indulgent noise, using the excuse of looking around to gain a bit of distance from the man. “I haven’t been here in a while. It’s… different.”
Slowly, with his confusion fading as shock rushed in to fill the gap left behind in its wake, Sherlock tipped his head back and went still. There was John, fast asleep with his chest against Sherlock’s back, their bodies fitted together like spoons in a drawer. At some point in the night, they had shifted, slipped out of their upright positions and into this far more intimate arrangement.
Emboldened by that silent faith, John swept his fingertips down the strip of skin he’d just shaved, feeling goosebumps rise in the wake of his caress. Sherlock’s shiver increased, the colour infusing his face darkening to a deeper, tantalizing flush. John watched, enchanted, as Sherlock’s eyebrows drew together, then upward and back down as a myriad of complex expressions flitted across his face. He turned his hand, cupping the side of Sherlock’s neck, tracing the rough line of Sherlock’s bobbing throat with the pad of his thumb, just to see what would happen.
Sherlock stopped with a huff. “I need to check on my experiment,” he protested, though he remained perfectly still. “You’re taking too long, John. You shave like a man who has never handled a blade before.”
Eyes lifting to Sherlock’s sleep-mussed curls, John looked thoughtful. “Will there be more glitter tonight?”
Sherlock complied, settling John on his back. As he began to remove his own clothing, John lifted his head and growled, “Fasten the chains first.”
Lestrade managed to subdue and cuff the man with Sherlock's help, but John was in a bad way by then. His shirt was soaked through with blood, his face tensed with pain as he struggled to remain upright. If he’d been fully human, the shock of blood loss surely would have already killed him. But John was made of tougher stuff, his demonic side keeping him alive even as his life force fled in great red gouts of blood.
“What do you want?” Sherlock demanded, turning on the taps with more force than was necessary. The rusted metal squeaked in protest, quickly drowned out by the banging of the old pipes as the water began to flow.
“Have you started using again?” asked his brother, holding Sherlock in place as he peered into Sherlock’s eyes.
Frowning, Sherlock replied, “Do you think I make a habit of inviting people into my flat against my will? Of course it’s alright.”
Sherlock accepted the glass, taking care to wrap his lips slowly around the straw while making casual eye contact with the bartender. He was pleased to see that the man’s throat bobbed in an obvious and tight swallow and held back a smirk. The drink was sour yet sweet, stinging over his tastebuds with the tell-tale thickness of sugary syrup. Far too sweet for his tastes, but Sherlock forced a pleased hum, coaxing a smile from the expectant bartender. “Yum,” he purred.
When his little death had passed, Sherlock was left with a sticky hand, an aching chest, and the first stirrings of uncertainty. He stewed over what he’d just done, how he’d fled the futon to hide in the bathroom and stroked himself off to thoughts of John. Embarrassment surged through him, nearly as strong as the dregs of orgasm still fading throughout his body.
“Yep,” John replied as he bent to set his books on the futon. “Much to my daily chagrin.” But he flashed a warm smile when he straightened and turned to Sherlock. “I’m sure some people must get along with their siblings.”
Warily eyeing the chemistry equipment on the desk, Sherlock’s current experiment fizzing quietly in a beaker, John asked, “You’re not cooking anything… illegal, are you?”
“That is a patently false statement,” Sherlock stated, surprised when John chuckled as if he’d made a joke. Rather than question the response, he smiled instead, letting the misunderstanding slide. As Sherlock stood by and watched John pack up the food and set it back in the bag, Sherlock wondered how they'd come to this point, this unexpected ease. And yet, if his anxiety from the night before was any indication of the future, he had a lot more gay panic to look forward to. He really shouldn’t have let this dry spell drag on so long, but there was really nothing to be done about it now.
In the end, Sherlock found he couldn’t wake John after all. He looked far too peaceful, the tension in his face smoothed out from sleep. Clearly, John needed the rest, and Sherlock was loath to wake him from the well-earned slumber. Instead, he turned away and gathered John’s texts, setting them in a neat pile next to the sofa before retreating to his desk. There, he fiddled with his experiment with lacklustre enthusiasm until John’s soft snoring lulled Sherlock into his own desperately needed sleep.
“Experiment, John,” Sherlock corrected him, the corner of his mouth twitching upward despite his admonishment.
“Guess I bought too much,” John mused, eyeing the leftovers. “You know what they say — my eyes are bigger than my stomach!”
Another wince. “Believe me, mate, I would if I could.” At Sherlock’s doubtful scowl, John sighed. “Look — do you really think I’d let him play that rubbish for three days straight if I had any say in the matter?” Losing the battle with a third yawn, he covered his mouth and grimaced. “Sorry,” he groaned, “I haven’t slept in three sodding days.”
“This is a private conversation,” he said coolly, hooking his thumbs in the pockets of his waistcoat. “You should leave.”
“Sherlock?” John asked quietly, confused. Sherlock didn’t answer, just remained stiff and still. Under his hand, John thought he could feel a slight, constant tremour rippling through Sherlock. Brow furrowed, he studied Sherlock’s tightly wound body, gaze pausing on Sherlock’s legs, crossed together in a vice grip at the thigh. Was Sherlock…? No, that couldn’t be it. Surely John was misreading the situation. “Are you alright?” he prompted, and Sherlock sucked in a loud, shaky breath.
Sherlock shook himself free of the memories and flashed a quick, reassuring smile at the querying noise John made in response to the movement. Standing, he closed the laptop and set it aside, hoping to banish the memories with distance.
Sherlock blinked up at him, hands settled on John’s waist, his forehead creased with a puzzled frown. “Why?”
He set the laptop aside and stood. Glancing once more around the room, Sherlock went to dress for a night at
“Well, I still say it’s amazing,” John assured him, still with that grin. He rubbed his hands together, looked at his watch, and grimaced. “Sod it all. I really do have to go, or I’ll be late.” Rushing across the small flat, he grabbed his back and threw it over his shoulder before turning back to Sherlock. “See you tomorrow, then?”
John hesitated a moment longer, watching Sherlock with a mixed expression of exhaustion and wariness. Finally, fatigue seemed to win out, and John began to unbutton his shirt, picking up where Sherlock had left off. The thin white vest beneath remained, a barely visible beacon when John turned off the light, plunging them into the blue-tinged dark of the early-morning light. He moved over to the futon, his footsteps muffled by socks on hardwood. John hesitated again at the edge of the futon before shedding his trousers with quick, jerky movements. When John slid under the blanket, he nearly dove, awkwardly rushing as if desperate to maintain some kind of modesty.
He thought of John, and the feeling of John’s warm, solid body pressed against his own. Pictured John’s sunrise-gold-gilded hair, of his dark eyes, blue as the deepest seas. Remembered the alluring quirk of John’s expressive mouth. Each image was crystal clear, rendered in flawless recall by Sherlock’s perfect memory. Sensations accompanied the remembered snippets, recollections of hot breath and the unexpected, trusting ease with which John’s arm bracketed Sherlock’s chest. Those images and echoes of reality drove Sherlock’s hand. His grip was punishing, pushing him past the tantalizing pulse of insistent arousal and into the chase for bliss, his mind caught up in a rising flood of need and desire.
Grinning, John said, “Leftover takeaway?” He patted his stomach. “I don’t know about you, but I’m starved.”
John, moving to sit up as Sherlock stood, paused and looked up at him with a frown. “That was your brother calling?” At Sherlock’s pursed-lip nod, John glanced toward the out-of-sight phone. “Blimey, he really is a control freak, isn’t he?”
particular spiral to its inevitable end, Sherlock took charge of the moment by standing awkwardly in his own kitchen and staring at John. When John looked up with the paper bag in hand, he paused and blinked at Sherlock.
They stared at one another for a long moment. Sherlock thought he saw some of his own uncertainty mirrored back at him, reflected in the way John watched him with hesitation. John opened his mouth, but nothing came out, and he soon closed it again, his brow furrowed.
Eyes darkening, John continued to look at Sherlock. When Sherlock still didn’t say anything, uncertainty appeared on his face.
Sherlock looked down at John, frustrated at the lack of resolution but strangely comforted to hear he wasn’t the only one suffering. What was that saying? Misery loves company…
With the blanket pulled up to his chin, lying on his side, Sherlock blinked one tired eye at John, still by the door. “Leave or get in,” he grumbled, body crying out for sleep. “Either way, turn off the light on your way.”
Usually, Sherlock wouldn’t bother entertaining such pointless thoughts. But John was a good-looking man. He was an attractive medical student and a decidedly-not-boring specimen with his quick wit, deep blue eyes, and pale hair.
There was something deeply hedonistic about the desire, surprising even to Sherlock. As a man who usually ruled his bodily needs with an iron fist, often to the point of ignoring them outright, he’d never believed himself to be capable of such desire. Maybe in a typical relationship with a full human man, Sherlock wouldn’t have strained so against the rules. But it went against his very nature as a scientist to leave something untested and unexperienced. In counter-point to their reality, Sherlock devoured any information and literature he could find on demons who fed on sexual energy and their unlikely progeny. Dreamed about the possibilities, the sensations missing from his experience-based repertoire.
“I’ve never been more sure in my life,” Sherlock growled, glaring at the phone. Threading his fingers through John’s dishwater-blonde hair, he tugged John’s face back around to his own. “If you don’t kiss me, I’m going to issue a formal complaint.”
John didn't realise that Sherlock was trying to take off his shirt until one of the buttons rips. At this point John was so completely past caring that he just ripped the whole thing down the middle, tearing his entire shirt like it’s made of paper (
Instead of arguing with his mother, he nodded and said, ‘I always thought Prince Edward seemed more regal.’
‘It’s all I’ve ever wanted,’ Sherlock whispered, realising he meant it with all of his broken, but fixable, heart.
‘It’s Sherlock, actually.’ Sherlock snapped, and he was pleased that all the thoughts of John had disappeared. ‘King Sherlock William Scott the First.’ Not wanting to get rid of his father’s name altogether, he had switched the order of his first and second names.
to, because he wants to love his and Sherlock’s son, but he can’t, and he doesn't know what he is meant to do.
‘I’m glad he went and got you,’ Sherlock whispered, and he wanted to reach out and take John's hand but he didn't know if he was allowed to, if that was ok, if he would be accepted, because John still hadn't said why he was here. ‘I’m glad he was brave enough to do something that I could never do.’
‘How do you know him?’ The words were out of John’s mouth before he could stop them, and Sherlock’s smile widened. ‘If I didn’t know better, I would say you were jealous, John Watson.’
‘Will you solemnly promise,’ the Archbishop continued, ‘to govern the peoples of our country and her territories, the whole of the empire of the Holmes family, according to their respective laws and customs?’
‘Now listen here,’ Anderson roared, dropping his severed hand. ‘I am perfectly intelligent in a completely
‘He’s bad news,’ Irene said as she sat next to Molly. ‘Tell John about him, Richard.’ John glanced at her and she smirked. ‘I can’t call him
They stood like that for several minutes, hugging in the entrance, and John didn't even realise Harry or his mum leaving, Harry with a dry comment and Jenny with a knowing smile. Nothing mattered in that moment but Sherlock, his Sherlock, touching and hearing and seeing his Sherlock again.
’ most of the adults said collectively. John caught his mum’s eye: she looked more confused than John felt.
Smith told him that Sholto had wanted him helicoptered back home so he could receive the best treatment available, but his condition hadn’t been stable enough, so he had had to remain in the medical tent as Smith and the other doctors tried to keep him alive.
‘No. You’re wrong.’ He was doing his half-laugh, the little sound he made when he was so angry that shouting couldn't happen anymore, and Sherlock shrunk further back into the corner. ‘Forgetting to pick someone up from the airport is a mistake. Choosing spots and stripes is a mistake. Calling a teacher mummy is a mistake. Cheating on someone who you’ve made a
John took his hand off the handle and walked down the corridor slightly, reaching the door that led into the sitting room. He opened it slowly, creeping in and pausing at the open door between the kitchen and Sherlock’s room.
John’s grin widened slightly, but he didn’t say anything, instead raising his eyebrows, indicating Sherlock continued.
And soon there would be a final addition, half-Sherlock and half-John, and as John stared at his partner, who was now frantically discussing the benefits and disadvantages of the name ‘Octavia with his daughter, he was overwhelmed with how lucky he was, how lucky his daughter was, and how lucky his soon-to-be child was.
Sherlock truly adored dancing; he had for as long as he could remember. The palace had a studio, located on the top floor, and Sherlock could stay up there for hours. He could do ballroom, tap and could even breakdance, but his favourite was ballet.
He may claim that they were loud, and smelly, and annoying, and pointless, and boring, and anything that was half Mycroft was in no way acceptable to him, but he had a secret picture in his wallet of his brother, brother-in-law and his nephew and niece that he often looked at when he felt sad. Mycroft, holding his son on the steps of the hospital, was beaming, while Lestrade, staring down at his daughter, just looked incredibly overwhelmed, yet happy.
Jack broke through his thoughts with an incredulous laugh. ‘With all due respect, sir, you do. You and your lad are more in love than any other couple I’ve ever seen. You’d do anything for each other, it’s as clear as daylight, and you’d have to do something really, really awful for him to stop loving you, and vice versa.’
‘Oh, come now Molly. It’s plain as day.’ Sherlock stretched his arms and watched his friend carefully. ‘I’m right, aren't I?’
John thought about Sherlock constantly. Sherlock distracted him from his studies; Sherlock distracted him from his friends. Sherlock kept him awake at night as John lay there in the darkness and wondered if he made the right decision, breaking up with him.
‘Twelve finally worked up the balls to say…something to Clara. Look.’ Jim nodded in the direction of the snogging corner and Sherlock picked out Twelve Smith’s familiar velvet jacket and Clara’s short blue skirt. ‘Ah. Unexpected. I thought he would never say anything. Have…have you seen John?’
Sherlock closed his eyes and slowed his breathing. He couldn’t have a panic attack, not now, there would surely be people waiting when he got to the palace and he didn’t want to go back into therapy, that had done more bad than good.
‘And he developed a fascination. I try to avoid it, I really do, but when he puts on tapes when we’re trying to sleep…I was awake with the twins last night and it was on and some of it must have subconsciously sunk in.’
He remembers his disastrous wedding to Mary. Sherlock was so sad, even when he was doing his speech, and John knew what he was doing to him but he
John slumped forwards in the grass. His face landed on a soft patch of long grass, that went into his mouth and up his nose, choking him as he resigned himself to the fact that he would always love Sherlock Holmes, always care for that stupid, beautiful boy, always want him, need him, yearn for him, and there was absolutely nothing that he could do about it.
Someone sat down next to him. John sniffed, wiped his nose, and then turned fiercely towards whoever it was.
Archie made his way meekly over to Mycroft, who patted him on the shoulder. Sherlock glared at Morag, half-tempted to tell her to shut up; he hated being called William. No one called him by his first name now, though he could remember a time when someone other than Morag had called him William, as she cradled him, hugged him and tucked him in at night-
Sherlock feigned innocence, batting his eyelashes innocently. ‘Why would you think that? That was clearly what you hinted-‘
Christopher lifted his nose and smiled at Charlie. ‘We are just debating what I’m going to call myself when I become King,’ he said loftily. Charlie’s face crumpled and she moved closer to John, moaning, ‘Papa, he’s being mean! Just because he’s a year older…’
‘No, Sherlock.’ James said firmly, overcoming his surprise at Sherlock. ‘No. You want me, Sherlock. You always have done. We’re perfect; we’re the same, you and I. We need each other. That John is too ordinary, too boring, too stupid for you. He’s nothing more than a pet-‘
Sherlock blinked, still confused. ‘You’re crying. Human beings cry when they’re in pain. Are you malfunctioning in some way-‘
It’s Mycroft, and he’s clearly agitated. He asks if John’s heard from Sherlock, if John’s seen Sherlock, because all the cameras in Baker Street were disabled at some point the night before and when Mycroft sent someone to see what was going on all the curtains were drawn and the doors were locked. He would go himself, he says, but he’s in Japan and he’s not worried (he obviously is) enough to send someone else. He asks if John has any ideas about what Sherlock could be doing.
‘You will be disowned.’ Morag said. William looked at her, eyes widening; clearly he did not like where this was going, and that made John hopeful for the first time: he really didn't believe that William would choose his outdated morals over his favourite son-
Lizzie is there as well, of course: she wouldn't miss her adored brother graduating for the world. She brings Isla, her wife, and their baby girl Rebecca, who’s as good as gold and blinks up at John with large, intelligent eyes as he holds her.
Sherlock had taken to them surprisingly quickly. He loved both his nephews, even if they were half Mycroft, but he had a particular favourite in Ezra. Perhaps because he was named after him, perhaps because he looked more like him, perhaps because he was incredibly intelligent, but Sherlock and Ezra had been as thick as thieves from the day Sherlock had visited them in hospital and Ezra had grabbed his finger and gurgled intelligently, gazing up at him with those big eyes.
‘Ok, Sherlock.’ Sherlock looked at himself in the mirror he had hung over his desk (it was useful in experiments involving light) and breathed out slowly. ‘You’ve run out of time and you need to make a decision. What are you going to do?’
John raised an eyebrow but when Molly glanced to her right, John realised what she meant. Irene and Janine were in the corner, totally caught up in each other, and John sighed as he watched Molly’s face crumple. ‘Everything’s so complicated, isn't it?’
Sebby grinned and nodded and Sherlock smiled to himself. Jim may have made it seem like his feelings for Sebby were barely existent but deep down he clearly cared very deeply for the boy, and Sherlock was happy. Jim needed someone to stop him going full on psycho and Sherlock would not always be around to stop him.
“Of course.” Brushing off Lestrade’s frantic concerns, Sherlock bullied the DI into driving them back to Baker Street, arriving far faster than a cab could have managed. Still, John was fading fast and staggering, his progress to the black door closer to dragging than actual walking.
Reigning in his wandering thoughts, his brow furrowed, John wiped the blade clean and set it back to Sherlock’s skin. He cleared a strip next to the first, pausing only when his left hand gave a slight twitch. John cursed his intermittent tremour silently, retracing the same area to erase the few spots he’d missed. A stubborn fleck of dried lather remained in his path, and John reached out to smooth it away with his thumb. Sherlock’s cheek twitched at the touch. John paused, thumb resting on Sherlock’s skin, when he saw that Sherlock’s eyes were open. Half-open, to be exact, with dark silver peeking out beneath his long, lowered lashes.
, Sherlock thought, glaring at his shampoo bottle. Mycroft had him now — and, worse, he undoubtedly knew that. He’d always known just what to say to make Sherlock march to his beat. It was what made him so insufferable — that and his general smugness.
“You’re John,” Sherlock replied, forcing himself to commit to the invitation since backing out would be far more embarrassing. He held out his own hand, mirroring John’s earlier stance. “Sherlock Holmes, flat 115.”
He was obsessed. Perhaps it was a dangerous obsession, but Sherlock didn’t think so. How could it be dangerous when he loved John and John loved him? Sherlock wanted to know every inch of John, wanted to know every fact and truth about him, and that included this missing experience. He wanted to see John as he truly was in his second form: inhuman and
Sherlock drew in a shaky inhale and swallowed. He was acutely aware of the rise and fall of John’s breathing, the warm brush of his slow, regular exhale seeping through the thin fabric of Sherlock’s shirt. The situation was entirely foreign, yet oddly familiar and even more welcome, that earlier sense of unintentional but shared intimacy deepening between them.
Upon waking, Sherlock took a moment to let the events of the past twenty-four hours filter through his sleep-foggy brain. From there, he allowed himself another few minutes of appreciation for the intimacy he found himself in. He was comfortable, cocooned beneath the blankets with the warmth of another body seeping into his own, soothing as a warm bath after an exhausting day. His legs, long and gawky and tangled with those of another, were half-asleep. To his faint surprise, the tingle of pins and needles felt more soothing than irritating. In Sherlock’s lazy opinion, knowing the cause of the sensation helped soften the unpleasant buzzing. The fact that these were John’s legs, tangled up with his with such unashamed closeness, filled Sherlock with delicious satisfaction. Despite his brazen, brash and bold behaviour the night before, despite the way he’d all but dragged John into his flat, Sherlock was rather pleased with himself. He felt no remorse for his actions, his newfound confidence undoubtedly a lingering aftereffect of the spontaneous sense of freedom he'd experienced at the club.
John made a quiet noise in his sleep, and Sherlock froze. But John just sighed and rolled to face the back of the futon, and Sherlock relaxed.
Sherlock muttered something in the negative, embarrassed by the exuberant praise. Still, he couldn’t deny the tiny, silver thrill of anticipation he felt knowing he would see John again the next day. He was awed that John had chosen to spend more time in Sherlock’s uncertain company of his own free will.
Then, following some instinct John couldn’t name, he set aside the blade and laid his hand over the freshly-shaved skin. Sherlock gasped at the contact, blood rushing into his face and darkening his pale cheeks. The touch was light, John’s fingers barely brushing the blade-reddened skin, but Sherlock’s response was like a man run through with an electric current, his body jolting from head to toe.
That was new. The last time Sherlock had been to the club, a handful of years ago, the scene here had been far more subtle. He was both surprised and a little titillated by the brazenness.
A thumping beat rattled the thin walls of the flat, loud enough that it seemed the heavy bass line vibrated the ceiling. It wasn’t strong enough to rattle teeth, but Sherlock felt like it very well could if he pressed his cheek to the wall. Tonight was the third in a row of assault by flat-shaking party music, and Sherlock was beginning to lose his grip on reality. After two all-nighters spent on a crucial, time-sensitive experiment, he was dangerously tired. His eyes felt like twin bruises in his face, his nerves long since scraped raw by the awful combination of exhaustion and the endless noise.
He’s almost at the point of contemplating suicide when he runs into Mike Stamford, one of the few people he went to Uni with who liked him, who in turn introduces him to Sherlock
‘What are you talking about?’ Sherlock said weakly. John looked through the crack; he was now slumped in his chair, head in his hands.
He was going to go to his bedroom, but he always felt lonely when John wasn’t there, so he padded to the third floor, which was Mycroft and Lestrade’s. When they were married, Lestrade had wanted to move away, but Mycroft had insisted they stay. He said it was because he wanted to be close to the work and near to Sherlock because Sherlock always got important information first, and Mycroft needed to be there to help, but Sherlock suspected it was because, in his own way, Mycroft was still looking out for him and protecting him, just as he had when they were children.
John wasn’t really sure what he was expecting when he walked in. It had all been very fast with Mary, a lot of shouting and running and a room full of people, but Lila was lying in the hospital bed filing her nails, with their doctor, Ella, sitting on a chair in the corner of the room reading a magazine. John had to do a double take, looking at them both in amazement. ‘I’m sorry, have I wandered into a spa day?’
It was humiliating to be approaching your boyfriend completely naked after cheating on him with the biggest threat to the security of his country since Al Qaeda.
‘Oh, yes,’ John grinned, and for the first time in months he felt confident, properly confident. ‘He’s being very good.’
‘I was right, John. You are worth more than my friend. You are worth more than my family. And you are worth more than my kingdom.’
‘Sherlock?’ John said softly. Sherlock was dragged out of his reverie and back into the present, looking at Mrs Watson. ‘Mm? Oh, yes. Yes, not athletic.’
‘John Watson,’ the new boy said. It was a plain, normal, simple name that seemed to fit him perfectly and Sherlock’s smile widened. ‘It must be odd moving to a new school halfway through your A levels. It’s a shame about your father but at least you’re happier with him behind bars.’
‘Ah. Good.’ John still sounded nervous and Sherlock wondered if he should ask him what was going on before thinking better of it; he was far too busy. ‘Anything else?’
‘The Witch,’ Mike said, ‘has me running ridiculous shifts. So can you just pop in and tell him that I can’t make it? His name-‘
John opened the back door and walked, bare-footed, onto the muddy grass. It had rained for days, though today was beautiful, and the mud beneath his toes felt oddly satisfying. Who was he kidding? He wasn't over Sherlock, he probably never would be and he was an idiot, a blind idiot, for letting him go.
Sherlock hissed impatiently as he looked around, squinting into the darkness. ‘Someone is going to see us,
‘The song’s called you’re beautiful, by James Blunt. I like it,’ John whispered, as if he knew that Sherlock had been wondering, and he wondered what he had done to deserve John Watson. ‘The lyrics are sad. The melody is sad. Why do you like it?’
‘Apparently he absolutely adores Sherlock.’ Harry said in a mock-secretive voice. ‘He hero-worships him. No idea why, though I bet it means we have another little cunt in the making.’
The staircase was huge. Dressed in his heavy robes, Sherlock was tired in minutes. He was climbing for almost ten minutes and, as he sighted a small trapdoor slightly above him and breathed out a sigh of relief, he wondered if it led to the roof, and why Mrs Hudson had sent him up there.
) was in there because Sherlock found him hilarious; the prime minister of some other country that Sherlock thought was irrelevant
Sherlock opened his mouth to deny it, cursing his grandmother inwardly for making John uncomfortable, but before he could speak-
John nods: of course the boy wants to honour his father, John wants that as well. ‘That’s beautiful, son, and your Dad would have been so delighted-‘
He had watched Prince Sherlock, standing there looking wretched and drawn with bags under his eyes, his older brother holding his arm tightly. He had watched the King glare at his middle son when he thought the cameras had been turned off and he had watched Sherlock visibly wince when his father mentioned James Moriarty.
Sherlock eagerly ripped off the paper, before withdrawing the present and looking confused. ‘What the hell is this?’
the section of the teen club John is in, put on a performance for the little ‘uns and got a standing ovation) and the second part of the afternoon started off really, really well.
Sherlock takes John’s hands. ‘John. I am going to be completely honest with you, more honest than I have ever been in my life before. Are you listening?’ John nods. ‘I have debated scientific theory with Isaac Newton. I am credited with co-writing sonnet 116 with William Shakespeare (he liked to be called Will, though). I was present when Guido Fawkes was caught in Parliament in 1605. I danced with Marie Antoinette in Versailles, and I sang a duet with Queen Victoria. My son and I played tennis with Tsar Nicholas II and his daughter, I was in Germany when it was taken by the Russians, and I played bridge with Winston Churchill at Chartwell house every Friday for ten years.’ He pauses, and looks John directly in the eye. ‘And, most importantly, I met a man named John Watson. I took him out, I made love to him, I laughed with him and- and I loved him. Out of all these people I have known, you, John Watson, are the only person I have ever loved, and you are therefore the most important person who has ever existed.’ He stops again, and looks in concern at John. ‘Please, please say something-‘
‘We could go down there,’ Sherlock said from behind him, and John whipped around, startled. ‘Jesus, Sher, warning, next time.’
Sherlock slowly turned around, looking straight at his father. ‘Dad?’ He said softly, and John couldn't ever remember Sherlock calling William anything but Father but clearly he must have done at some point because William’s face softened as he remembered some past Sherlock who used to put his arms up to be picked up by his Daddy and he sighed. ‘I couldn’t disown you, son. I couldn’t hurt you like that. Come here.’
Sholto nodded and looked John up and down again. ‘Nothing. Unlike ANY OF YOU! Waters, shoelaces untied. Murphy, dirt on sleeve. Hunter- where the hell is your gun, Hunter?’
Lestrade ran a hand through his hair. ‘I know he deserves it, Sherlock, but that was a little bit far. I knew Sally was expecting and I knew that he was the father but she deserved to tell him, or not tell him, in her own time. You didn't just humiliate Anderson there but Sally as well-‘
Mycroft smiled slightly and slid the phone back into his pocket (Sherlock was getting whiplash watching Mycroft and his bloody phone), smoothing down his formal suit and seizing the umbrella leaning against Sherlock’s chair. ‘Jealousy isn’t a good colour on you, Sherlock. I must go; be down in the next half hour.’
Hamish didn’t say anything else about the party after that. Instead, they talked about other things: university (Hamish was appalled by the fact Sherlock had gone to Cambridge and then graduated two years early), their families (Sherlock couldn’t say anything without giving away that he was, in fact, the groom’s brother) and their pets (
‘Sherlock!’ Victor cried before clamping his hand over his mouth. ‘I mean, Sherlock! What the hell are you doing?’
‘Don’t you dare talk to me like that,’ he growled. ‘Don’t you dare call me worthless. Don’t you dare call me stupid. You have no right.’
Sherlock sniffed, wiping away the tears, although both of them could see it was useless. ‘I tried to tell people it was a suicide, but they just ignored me. The ramblings of a five year old, they said. So I tried to forget it, which failed completely. Every time I close my eyes I can see my shoes, John, covered in her blood, because I didn’t come out of the wardrobe, I didn’t stop her, I just watched as she put the gun in her mouth and pulled the trigger-‘
‘Buckingham- you want me-‘ John couldn’t believe what was happening. He had known this boy, who was a prince, for all of thirty minutes and he was inviting him to his house, his palace. ‘But what if I’m a terrorist or murderer or something?’
Mary falls pregnant again when Lizzie is five, and Sherlock has to pretend to be happy: John knows, though, that he’s close to breaking. As the pregnancy progresses John spends more and more time with Mary and less and less time with Sherlock. Sherlock starts losing weight, stops going to crime scenes, and John couldn't care less because the thrill is
Sherlock sighed. ‘I can see that you’re not, John, and you’re being idiotic, John. I don’t expect this of you. I am inviting you to my…dwelling.’
‘Shut up!’ Sherlock shouted, and the Irish boy just stared at him as he tried to tear the sheets off him; James was still fully-dressed, why had Sherlock been the only one who was stripped naked? ‘I need to find him-‘
put the robe on him. ‘I poured over it, highlighted it and then framed it. I kiss it every night before I go to bed. Instead of reciting the Lord's prayer before I sleep I recite your itinerary. Never before have I loved something as I do that piece of paper.'
Mrs Holmes bustled into the sitting room, smiled at Lestrade, chucked Ezra under his chin, bent down and smoothed down Christopher’s hair, and fixed her eyes on her two sons. ‘Yes, Sherlock?’
‘They shouldn’t,’ John said honestly. ‘That was amazing. Just a little wrong. Harry is my sister; it’s short for Harriet.’
‘We’ve been friends for three hundred and thirty three days,’ Sherlock moaned. ‘They should have found out ages ago. It’ll be fine. Seriously.’
‘She has an ulterior motive,’ Mycroft said for what must have been the billionth time, because he ignored everything Sherlock said. ‘She’ll hurt you, Sherlock, and I don’t want to see that happen-‘
‘Christ.’ Sherlock said hazily, and John wondered if he was going to throw up because Sherlock had been the one that had been adamant that nobody found out. He couldn't risk his family finding out because he honestly, genuinely seemed to think that they would punish him or banish him or even exile him. ‘Queen?’ His voice came back a little stronger, and John smiled slightly to himself: this was the Sherlock he knew and loved. ‘Queen? He’d be a King, Harriet. As you can clearly see, I have no want for a Queen.’
‘Fair to middling,’ Izzy replied, and Sherlock kissed her forehead. ‘I just wanted to check in before my speech- I’m about to do it.’ He shook hands with Greg. ‘Gabriel. Delighted.’
John lay in the grass as the rain pattered on his back and he cried and cried and cried as his heart ached in his chest.
A slow, warm grin broke out over John’s face, erasing his uncertain expression. “I would,” he said, the tension easing out of his shoulders. “Thank you.” He sidled past Sherlock, entering the flat with considerably more confidence than he had the night before, setting his messenger bag down next to the door.
John pinched the bridge of his nose between thumb and index finger, struggling not to lose the tenuous hold he still retained on his temper. “Who says it wouldn’t be premeditated?” John prayed for patience and opened his eyes again. “Stop clenching your teeth,” he ordered, smoothing his fingertips over Sherlock’s tense jaw. Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath and tensed more, making John sigh. “You’re impossible.”
catered almost exclusively to male clientele. Sherlock scanned the gold-edged glamour of the decor. His eyes lingered on several men positioned strategically throughout the club, moving in time with the music in heavy boots and skin-tight clothing atop matte-black dance platforms.
-ing sound, tongue clicking against the backs of his teeth. “I had hoped it wasn’t him — he has a bit of a history, and I believed him to be reformed. It seems I was mistaken.”
compelling,” John muttered, annoyed. “It’s called suggestion. It's not the same thing.” Despite the irritation in his voice, his eyes flashed with ravenous hunger, the uncertainty fading in its wake. “Fine, then… Hurry up and finish with the chains.”
“‘Might be’ isn’t good enough,” Sherlock snapped, trying to remain focused as his eyes roved over John’s form. “We can’t take that chance.” His words sounded far-off even to himself, attention zeroing in on John. He was an impressive sight on his knees as he was, alluring despite the injury and the blood. He was glorious, all hard muscle and powerful thighs, his cock leaking and straining toward Sherlock.
