- they really do light up!
'Suspend your judgment, my man,' replied Moriarty, 'the wiles of this boy’s heart are unsearchable. Now, young man, your EXPLANATION.'
The sun now gave his last light, and Holmes bade the muleteer proceed with all possible dispatch. They continued to travel long after twilight had obscured the road, which was so broken, that, now thinking it safer to walk than to ride, they all alighted. The moon was rising, but her light was yet too feeble to assist them. While they stepped carefully on, they heard the vesper-bell of a convent. The twilight would not permit them to distinguish anything like a building, but the sounds seemed to come from some woods, that overhung an acclivity to the right. John proposed to go in search of this convent. 'If they will not accommodate us with a night's lodging,' said he, 'they may certainly inform us how far we are from Montigny, and direct us towards it.' He was bounding forward, without waiting Holmes's reply, when the latter stopped him. 'I am very weary,' said Holmes, 'and wish for nothing so much as for immediate rest. We will all go to the convent; they will scarcely deny us repose.'
“An enemy.”
John smiled. “It’s your team too, remember?”
(See the end of the chapter for
On reaching the great gallery, he heard voices seemingly in dispute, and, pausing, soon distinguished some words of Douglas and Moran, and hid himself behind the doorframe. They were alone. Moran, still flushed with rage, was protesting, that he would instantly inform Moriarty of the insult, which Wilkes had thrown out against him, and above all, that, wherein he had accused him of murder.
. “Evening Victor,” he says, already turning back to look at Sherlock’s parents.
'You may find, perhaps, Signor,' said Sherlock, with dignity, 'that the strength of my mind is equal to the justice of my cause; and that I can endure with fortitude, when it is in resistance of oppression.'
tight….”
Sherlock smiled faintly, and, anxious to say something, asked if he had been long in Gascony. 'A few days only,' replied John. 'I engaged in a long ramble after I had the misfortune of parting with the friends who had made my wanderings among the Pyrenees so delightful.'
The servant, who came to light Moriarty, bowed in silence. Moriarty noticed the salutation by a slight motion of his hand, and passed on, while his husband, following, and looking round with a degree of surprise and discontent, which he seemed fearful of expressing, and Sherlock, surveying the extent and grandeur of the hall in timid wonder, approached a marble stair-case. The arches here opened to a lofty vault, from the centre of which hung a tripod lamp, which a servant was hastily lighting; and the rich fret-work of the roof, a corridor, leading into several upper apartments, and a painted window, stretching nearly from the pavement to the ceiling of the hall, became gradually visible.
Sherlock leans forward and says something to the driver, who changes lanes and turns right, and then a short time later they have pulled up in a non-descript looking petrol station. Sherlock bounds out and starts looking at seemingly random features; a big sign advertising sandwiches, the banged up door to the bathroom, some stains on the concrete John doesn’t want to think about too closely.  John, standing by the cab, stretches out and keeps a beady eye on Sherlock as he sticks his head inside the bathroom and takes a look around. Within two minutes he is bouncing back to the cab and telling John he needn’t have got out.
Over the beautiful plains of this country the devastations of war were frequently visible. Where the lands had not been suffered to lie uncultivated, they were often tracked with the steps of the spoiler; the vines were torn down from the branches that had supported them, the olives trampled upon the ground, and even the groves of mulberry trees had been hewn by the enemy to light fires that destroyed the hamlets and villages of their owners.
Dear God no John! Jooohnnn!!!
'The explanation may now be dispensed with; it is anticipated. If Count Wilkes still thinks one necessary, I will give him an honest one—You have changed your intention since our last conversation; and, if he can have patience and humility enough to wait till to-morrow, he will probably find it changed again: but as I have neither the patience or the humility, which you expect from a lover, I warn you of the effect of my displeasure!'
“Oh, seen the dessert stand tonight Johnny?” Bill continued breezily. “Looks like spotted dick was off the menu today,” he chuckles. John slapped down some steamed greens onto his plate. “Plenty of pineapple though! Gotta keep sweet, right!”
'Of safety!' exclaimed Sherlock, thoughtlessly; 'has, then, the Signor so much consideration for me?'
with multiple gold medal winner, the British marathoner Mo Farah.
Sherlock turns to look at Mike; his voice is strange, deliberate. Mike is looking right at him.
After a struggle, he determined to accept this permission to visit the turret, and to take a last look of his ill-fated brother.  When he saw the track of blood on the stair of the turret, which he had before observed, his spirits faltered, and he almost determined to proceed no further. The pause of a few moments restored his resolution, and he went on.
.  You might also want to refer to a guide to the
Sherlock made a sign for silence, and looked upon the bustle of the Count’s arrival, he and another chevalier in his carriage, with several men on horseback lighting the scene with torches.  Moriarty received his guests only briefly before disappearing back into the gloomy recesses of the castle. When all the visitors had withdrawn, Sherlock and Molly retreated back into the gloom of the adjoining chamber.
A man now appeared at the door of the stair-case, and other steps were heard ascending. Sherlock uttered a loud yell and leapt from the casement towards the main door, as at the same moment, a loud noise was heard from the corridor. The Count paused an instant, as if his mind was suspended between love and the desire of vengeance; and, in that instant, the door gave way, and Moriarty, followed by the old steward and several other persons, burst into the room.
At length he reached his own chamber, spacious, desolate, and lofty, like the rest, with high lattices that opened towards the Adriatic. It brought gloomy images to his mind, but the view of the Adriatic soon gave others more pleasant, among which was that of John as the sea-king, whose delights he had before amused himself with picturing; and, when in his bed, imagined them until he reached the climax of his own delight.
Sherlock could not restrain his excitement as he looked over the pine forests of the mountains upon the vast plains, that, enriched with woods, towns, blushing vines, and plantations of almonds, palms, and olives, stretched along, till their various colours melted in distance into one harmonious hue. Through the whole of this glorious scene the majestic Garonne wandered; descending from its source among the Pyrenees, and winding its blue waves towards the Bay of Biscay.
On a sudden, he thought he heard a voice, and, not distinguishing from whence it came, hesitated to proceed, or to return. For some moments, he stood in an attitude of listening expectation, scarcely daring to look round. The voice came again, and Sherlock thought, however, that it was the voice of complaint, and his belief was soon confirmed by a low moaning sound, that seemed to proceed from one of the chambers, opening into the gallery. It instantly occurred to her, that Mycroft might be there confined, and he advanced to the door to speak, but was checked by considering, that he was, perhaps, going to commit himself to a stranger, who might discover him to Moriarty; for, though this person, whoever it was, seemed to be in affliction, it did not follow, that he was a prisoner.
“Oh, it’s tragic,” she said with an exaggerated sigh, “haven’t you heard?  My poor old knee is no longer the top story at these games.”
All the company rose from their chairs in confusion.
The entertainments of this evening consisted of a ball and supper; it was a fancy ball, and the company danced in groups in the gardens, which were very extensive. The high and luxuriant trees, under which the groups assembled, were illuminated with a profusion of lamps, disposed with taste and fancy. The bright and various dresses of the company, the gallant manners of the gentlemen, the exquisitely capricious air of the ladies; the light fantastic steps of their dances; the musicians, with the violin, the hautboy, and the tabor, seated at the foot of an elm, and the sylvan scenery of woods around were circumstances, that unitedly formed a striking picture of festivity. Sherlock felt himself distant from the gaiety of the scene, and his emotion may be imagined when, as he stood with his brother, looking at one of the groups, he perceived John; saw him dancing with a young and beautiful lady, saw him conversing with her with a mixture of attention and familiarity, such as Sherlock had seldom observed in his manner.
Meanwhile, the Count remained in a cottage in the skirts of the woods below, suffering under bodily and mental pain, and meditating deep revenge against Moriarty. His servant, whom he had dispatched for a surgeon to the nearest town, which was, however, at a considerable distance, did not return till the following day, when, his wounds being examined and dressed, the practitioner refused to deliver any positive opinion, concerning the degree of danger attending them; but giving his patient a composing draught and ordering him to be quiet, remained at the cottage to watch the event.
Keep me in patience; and, in ripen'd time,
'Hopkins!' cried Molly, sobbing—'Hopkins!'
Sherlock’s lip curled. “I compete in an individual event, John. Seeing as how your ‘cheering’ experiment has failed to make a noticeable improvement in your team’s scores, I fail to see the benefit of belonging to a ‘team,’.”
Sherlock caught the latter words of Molly. 'O! if you could find it open, but for one moment!' he exclaimed, 'my peace might yet be saved!' The heavy groan he uttered, and the wildness of his look, terrified Molly, still more than his words; who entreated Sherlock to explain the meaning of them. To him it suddenly occurred, that Hopkins might be of some service, if there should be a possibility of escape, and who repeated the substance of what had passed between Moriarty and herself, but conjured Molly to mention this to no person except to Hopkins. 'It may, perhaps, be in Hopkin’s power,' he added, 'to effect our escape. Go to her, Molly, tell him what I have to apprehend, and what I have already suffered; but entreat secrecy, and to lose no time in attempting to release us. If she is willing to undertake this she shall be amply rewarded. I cannot speak with her myself, for we might be observed, and then effectual care would be taken to prevent our flight. But be quick, Molly, and, above all, be discreet—I will await your return in this apartment.'
'Astonishing!' drawled Moriarty: 'this is beyond even my expectation! But you will observe, Monsieur Sherlock, that I am no lover, though Count Wilkes is, and that I will not be made the amusement of your capricious moments. You shall adhere to the declaration, which you have made me an agent to convey to the Count.'
John just managed not to groan.
, in case of an emergency that couldn't be handled there.  That's where Sarah has been taken in this story.
While he yet listened, the breathing was distinctly heard, and his terror was not soothed, when, looking round his wide and lonely chamber, he again considered his remote situation. At length, he determined to call loudly for assistance from the casement, and was advancing to it, when, whether the terror of his mind presented sounds, or that real ones did come, he thought footsteps were ascending the private stair-case; and, expecting to see its door unclose, he forgot all other cause of alarm, and retreated towards the corridor. Here he endeavoured to make an escape, but, on opening the door, was very near falling over a person, who lay on the floor without. Sherlock stifled his cries, fear yielded to surprise, for he recognised the features of Molly. He instantly set about reviving her.
John made an affirmative noise. “It’s fine” he said, clearly aiming to strike a genial, reassuring tone. “Bill’s collecting them, fills his pockets from the vending machine downstairs every time he goes past. For the folks at home, he says.”
Sherlock drew up a chair to the side of the bed and steepled his fingers under his chin, eyes nearly colourless under the fluorescent lighting. “I just have a few questions,” he began.
.  Then she
Madame Petitbois listened to the proposal, and, considering that Sherlock was the apparent heiress of his brother’s wealth, accepted it. Meanwhile, Sherlock knew nothing of the transaction, till Monsieur Mycroft informed him, that he must make preparation for the nuptials, which would be celebrated without further delay.
'Ah!' said Holmes, as if struck with some sudden remembrance, 'the convent of St. Clair!'
By which the giant follies die.
Sherlock observed with concern the ascendancy, which Moriarty had acquired over Monsieur Mycroft, as well as the increasing frequency of his visits; and his own opinion of this Italian was united with that of John, who had always expressed a dislike of him. As he was, one morning, sitting at his experiments in the pavilion, enjoying the pleasant freshness of spring, whose colours were now spread upon the landscape, and listening to John, who was reading, but who often laid aside the book to converse, Sherlock received a summons to attend Monsieur Mycroft immediately.
'True, ma'am!' said Molly, with a look of horror, 'yes, it is true, indeed. But they do say,' she added, lowering her voice, 'they do say, that the Signora has been seen, several times since, walking in the woods and about the castle in the night: several of the old servants, who remained here some time after, declare they saw her; and, since then, she has been seen by some of the vassals, who have happened to be in the castle, at night. Carlo, the old steward, could tell such things, they say, if he would.'
While Morstan remained concealed in his house, Moriarty was unwilling to attract public observation by the nuptials of Count Wilkes; but this obstacle was, in a few days, overcome by the departure of his criminal visitor, and he then informed Sherlock, that Morstan was to visit some mutual acquaintance; and further that his marriage was to be celebrated on the following morning. To Sherlock’s repeated assurances, that it should not take place, he replied only by a malignant smile; and, telling him that the Count and a priest would be at the house, early in the morning, he advised him to not endanger his friends, by continued opposition. 'I am now going out for the evening,' said he, 'remember, that I shall give your hand to Count Wilkes in the morning.'
“Contestants? What are you commentating here, The X Factor?”
Sherlock, deducing that his ramble in the garden on the night preceding his departure from Bakersfield had been observed, now mentioned the motive of it, at which Monsieur Mycroft smiled contemptuously, refusing either to accept this explanation, or to give reasons for refusing it; and, soon after, concluded the subject by saying, 'I never trust people's assertions, I always judge of them by their actions; but I am willing to try what will be your behaviour in future.'
'O holy Sebastian!' exclaimed Molly, 'am I to stay here by myself all night! I shall be frightened out of my senses, and I shall die of hunger; I have had nothing to eat since dinner!'
“Jeez, John,” drawled Bill, “I didn’t know you cared about brains as well.” John’s fork vibrated in his fist as he feels six pairs of eyes upon him. “I didn’t think that Mexican table tennis player back in London—Silvia wasn’t it?—had much going on upstairs.”
So he smiles and nods, nods and smiles.
IF INCONVENIENT, COME ANYWAY. SH
“Oh shit, now’s my chance,” Bill jumps up and runs away, or as quickly as someone can run with a gutful of free McDonald’s.
,” replied John, “really good party. I’m seriously fighting an impulse to steal a cushion to commemorate it.”
Sherlock stood abruptly. “Here we are, then,” he announced, sliding past John and bounding of the bus.
John opened his mouth, about to respond, when he realized it was Sunday. Fucking
Sherlock’s mouth opened involuntarily and a small ‘unnggh’ fell out. “Ah, what? No, this is – was - just the shortest way back from the training hall to my room…”
THE MINSTREL
John holds one in his hand. “Not much… about as much as phone, maybe a bit more?”
Attempting to outreason these fears, Sherlock passed on with faltering steps, and having paused a moment at the door, before he attempted to open it, he then hastily entered the chamber, and went towards the picture, which appeared to be enclosed in a frame of uncommon size, that hung in a dark part of the room. He paused again, and then, with a timid hand, lifted the veil; but instantly let it fall—perceiving that what it had concealed was no picture, and, before he could leave the chamber, he dropped senseless on the floor!
“Does that make me special?”
John trails after the little group of Holmeses, taking the only empty place on a loveseat next to Sherlock’s dad. “So, John,” says Violet, settled next to her older son, who is inspecting one of the trifles with great interest, “tell me about this tiebreaking rule in gymnastics?  It seems
'Fighting! Who are fighting?'
At last, Sherlock decided to jump in and save him. “Yes, John’s been
A roughened hand grasped his own where it flailed above his head, and another clasped round his elbow. With a quick jerk, Sherlock was freed from the cushion’s hateful hold. “Diabolical object!” Sherlock sniffed, poking it with his toe.
Yes I know. SH
Sherlock now enquired, if Moriarty expected any new guests? and Molly believed that he did not. 'Poor Hopkins!' added she, 'she would be as merry as the best of them, if she was well; but she may recover yet. Count Wilkes was wounded as bad, as he, and he is got well again, and is gone back to Venice.'
And, lest they meet my blasted view,
But there he was, leaning up against the back wall, collar of the team jacket popped up against his cheekbones. John boggled. He definitely hadn’t been with in the minivan he’d come in with Mike and the others. No one on the team was allowed out of the village by themselves after last night, so he couldn’t have snuck in on his own…. Could he?
'It is so very humiliating, that I know not how to mention it,' continued Monsieur Mycroft, 'but you shall judge. Do you observe that young man seated near the bottom of the table, who is conversing with Mademoiselle D'Emery?' 'Yes, I perceive whom you mean.' 'You observe how little he has the air of a person of condition; I was saying just now, that I should not have thought him a gentleman, if I had not seen him at this table.' 'Well! but the report,' said Madame Petitbois, 'let me understand the subject of your distress.' 'Ah! the subject of my distress,' replied Monsieur Mycroft; 'this person, whom nobody knows—(I beg pardon, madam, I did not consider what I said)—this impertinent young man, having had the presumption to address my young brother, has, I fear, given rise to a report, that he had declared himself my admirer. Now only consider how very mortifying such a report must be! You, I know, will feel for my situation. A man of my condition!—think how degrading even the rumour of such an alliance must be.'
Sherlock, again looked round, in search of a possibility of escape from the castle, and conversed with Mycroft on the subject, who was now willing to encounter any hazard, though Sherlock forbore to encourage a hope in his brother, which he himself did not admit. How strongly the edifice was secured, and how vigilantly guarded, he knew too well; and trembled to commit their safety to the caprice of the servant, whose assistance they must solicit. Old Carlo was compassionate, but he seemed to be too much in his master's interest to be trusted by them; Molly could of herself do little, and Sherlock knew Hopkins only from her report. At present, however, these considerations were useless, Mycroft and Sherlock both being shut up from all intercourse, even with the persons, whom there might be these reasons to reject.
(Whether it be lone fancy him beguiles,
The general magnificence of that city, with its vistas of churches and palaces, branching from the grand square, each opening to a landscape of the distant Alps or Apennines, was not only such as Sherlock had never seen in France, but almost beyond the means of his deduction.
It was not till they had passed the eastern limits of the Milanese, that the travellers saw any troops, when, as the evening was drawing to a close, they saw what appeared to be an army winding onward along the distant plains, whose spears and other arms caught the last rays of the sun. As the column advanced through a part of the road, contracted between two hillocks, some of the commanders, on horseback, were distinguished on a small hill, pointing and making signals for the march; while several of the officers were riding along the line directing its progress, according to the signs communicated by those above; and others, separating from the vanguard, which had emerged from the pass, were riding carelessly along the plains at some distance to the right of the army.
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
Gather round for the spooky recitations of how the castle of Musgrovio came to Moriarty's possession.  Plus: a little bit of back story.
“Friend?” Victor repeated in some surprise.
On the seventh day, the disorder was at its crisis. The physician assumed a graver manner, which she observed, and took occasion, when her family had once quitted the chamber, to tell him, that she perceived her death was approaching. 'Do not attempt to deceive me,' said she, 'I feel that I cannot long survive. I am prepared for the event - do not suffer a mistaken compassion to induce you to flatter my family with false hopes. If you do, their affliction will only be the heavier when it arrives: I will endeavour to teach them resignation by my example.'
John tossed the phone in his hand, up and down, up and down, eyes never leaving Sherlock’s. The scratches in the silver finish of the phone caught the light in jagged flashes. With a small, private smile, John rose, crossing the small room and handing the phone to Sherlock wordlessly.
The music they heard before now passed Moriarty's barge, in one of the gondolas, of which several were seen skimming along the moon-light sea, full of gay parties, catching the cool breeze. Most of these had music, made sweeter by the waves over which it floated, and by the measured sound of oars, as they dashed the sparkling tide. Sherlock gazed, and listened, and thought himself in a fairy scene; even Monsieur Mycroft was pleased; Moriarty congratulated himself on his return to Venice, which he called the first city in the world, and Douglas was more gay and animated than ever.
'Why, did YOU hear any last night, sir?'
‘Sherlock!’ cried John. ‘Pray do not go! I have spoken hastily – God – I have accused your bright and shining mind falsely - I am unworthy of you!’
which concern my future prosperity. In point of prudence nothing
In the story John rubs honey on the bars:
One part of the cavalcade now extended along the valley, and another wound among the mountains towards the north, while some troops still lingered on the woody precipices, where the first had appeared, so that the great length of the procession seemed to include an whole army. While Moriarty and his family watched its progress, they heard the sound of trumpets and the clash of cymbals in the vale, and then others, answering from the heights. Sherlock listened to the shrill blast, that woke the echoes of the mountains, and Moriarty explained the signals, with which he appeared to be well acquainted, and which meant nothing hostile. The uniforms of the troops, and the kind of arms they bore, confirmed to sherlock the conjecture of Douglas, and the troop in due course passed by. Moriarty did not, however, leave the rampart, till the bases of the mountains had shut them from his view, and the last murmur of the trumpet floated away on the wind. Douglas and Verezzi were inspirited by this spectacle, which seemed to have roused all the fire of their temper; Moriarty turned into the castle in thoughtful silence.
Moriarty came home late in the morning, in a very ill humour, having lost considerably at play, and, before he withdrew to rest, had a private conference with Douglas, whose manner, on the following day, seemed to tell, that the subject of it had not been pleasing to him.
Madame Holmes, reanimated by the cheerfulness and recovery of her husband, was no longer sensible of the indisposition which had lately oppressed her; and, as she sauntered along the wood-walks of this romantic glen, and conversed with him, and with her son, she often looked at them alternately with a degree of tenderness, that filled her eyes with tears. Holmes observed this more than once, and gently reproved her for the emotion; but she could only smile, and clasp his hand, and that of Sherlock. Sieger felt emotion stealing upon himself in a degree that became almost painful; his features assumed a serious air, and he could not forbear secretly sighing—'Perhaps I shall some time look back to these moments, as to the summit of my happiness, with hopeless regret. But let me not misuse them by useless anticipation; let me hope I shall not live to mourn the loss of those who are dearer to me than life.'
As they travelled Sieger found great pleasure in conversing with John, and in listening to his remarks. Holmes discovered in his sentiments the justness and the dignity of an elevated mind, unbiased by intercourse with the world. John believed well of all mankind - this opinion, the reflected image of his own heart.
'He says it is an omen, and bodes no good.'
“Yes, I had thought so,” replied Victor with a smile.
Is it at this moment that his brain latches on to the music, obviously as a desperate attempt to save itself from lustful self-immolation.
Having reached the pavillion, he paused a moment to look round, but he heard only the plaintive sweetness of the nightingale, with the light shiver of the leaves; and plains extending gradually and indistinctly to the eye to distant mountains, and the nearer river reflecting the moon.
The travellers, interested by her distress, stopped to observe her. She took the youngest of the children in her arms, and, perceiving the strangers, hastily dried her tears, and proceeded to the cottage. Holmes, on enquiring the occasion of her sorrow, learned that her husband, who was a shepherd, had lost, on the preceding night, his little all, for several of his master’s sheep had been stolen. 'Jacques,' added the shepherd's wife, 'had saved a little money, and had bought a few sheep with it, and now they must go to his master for those that are stolen; and what is worse than all, his master, when he comes to know how it is, will trust him no longer with the care of his flocks, for he is a hard man! and then what is to become of our children!'
Sherlock swallows the rest of the tea, eyes unfocusing as he contemplated the glittering surface of the pool.
'Coward!' cried Moriarty, bursting from the people who held him, and rushing on the Count, when they both retreated into the corridor, where the fight continued so desperately, that none of the spectators dared approach them, Moriarty swearing, that the first who interfered, should fall by his sword.
Warbling and sauntering carelessly along;
'No doubt you would,' replied Monsieur Mycroft, with a smile of irony, 'and I shall no doubt consent to this, since I see how necessary tranquillity and retirement are to restore your spirits. I did not think you capable of so much duplicity, brother; when you pleaded this excuse for remaining here, I foolishly believed it to be a just one, nor expected to have found with you so agreeable a companion as this M. Botson—, I forget his name.'
Molly blushed, and Sherlock smiled, and they passed on to the extremity of this suite of apartments, and found themselves, after some further perplexity, once more at the top of the marble stair-case, where Molly left Sherlock, while she went to call one of the servants of the castle to shew them to the chamber, for which they had been seeking.
So here he is, bright and early, looking at John’s door, standing resolutely in one spot so as to avoid oscillation.
They walked slowly back to the chateau, the sky purpling as surely as the bruise on Sherlock’s throat. At the end of the grove near the house, John pressed Sherlock to his heart.  John struggled to assume a composed air. 'Farewell, my love!' said he, in a voice of solemn tenderness—'trust me we shall meet again—meet for each other—meet to part no more!'
Sherlock suddenly remembered the wounded person, whom he had seen borne into the servants' hall, and scarcely doubted, that it was Hopkins, but he concealed the circumstance from Molly, and endeavoured to comfort her. Then, impatient to be on his way, he again enquired the way to the turret.
“Back together, yeah?” said Lestrade, sticking his head round the doorway, springing into action at the promise of returning to the tiny single bed he called his own. “And get a cab – you know the rules.”
'Dear me’, said Molly, vexed. ‘You will believe nothing.'
a brief interlude at the Olympic Village.
“So it was Moran, was it?” John says eventually.
They separated at an early hour, and retired to their respective apartments. Sherlock laid upon the bed awake, for his heart was melancholy; he thought his father daily declining in health.  In about two hours after, he was awakened by the chiming of a bell, and then heard quick steps pass along the gallery, into which his chamber opened. Initially he feared he was being summonsed to her father, fearing he had taken very ill; before he recollected that the bell was the call of the monks to prayers. His mind was not disposed for immediate sleep, and the moon-light, that shone into his chamber, invited him to open the casement, and look out upon the country.
He was awakened from musing by the sound of horses' feet along a road, that wound under the windows of the pavilion, and a gentleman passed on horseback, whose resemblance to John, in air and figure, for the twilight did not permit a view of his features, immediately struck him. He retired hastily from the lattice, fearing to be seen, yet wishing to observe further, while the stranger passed on without looking up, and, when he returned to the lattice, he saw him faintly through the twilight, winding under the high trees, that led to Tholouse. This little incident so much disturbed Sherlock’s spirits, that unable to concentrate on his violin, he returned to the chateau.
“How was the beach?” Bill asked, reaching across John’s body to grab the Pasta Puttanesca serving spoon.
“Where?” Sherlock said plaintively, clutching the swimsuit. “There’s no changing rooms here.”
'But what reason had they to conclude it was a spirit, unless they had approached, and spoken to it?'

, I expect.”
But: ‘Take a hold of your senses!’ he sternly admonished himself on perceiving that it was Redbeard who sat by him, and who now licked his hands affectionately.
'Impossible!' exclaimed Monsieur Mycroft, reddening with vexation, 'it is impossible that she can be so destitute of taste; he has so little the air of a person of condition, that, if I did not see him at the table of Madame Petitbois, I should never have suspected him to be one. I have besides particular reasons for believing the report to be erroneous.'
'He lies in the upper chamber,' said Barnardine.
Because I am an A-grade Olympics nerd, I'll be posting some bits and pieces at the end of each chapter about the games.

'It will certainly come down,' said M. Anderson; ‘but my good sir, I will not dispute with you. You must return to Paris before our ideas can at all agree. But apropos of Venice, I have some thoughts of going thither, next summer. In that case I shall leave the improvements I mention to another year.'
Sherlock blinks. John stands in the entrance to the room, boxer briefs low on his hips, small beads of water still gleaming on his skin. He is towelling his hair;

'The chateau is spacious, I suppose,' said Sherlock, 'and must be desolate for the residence of only two persons.'
Sherlock leaned back against the wall; slowly he descended to the floor, facing the body of his father.  Eventually he fell into a kind of slumber, but the images of his waking mind still haunted his reason. He thought he saw his father approaching him with a benign countenance; then, smiling mournfully and pointing upwards, his lips moved, but, instead of words, Sherlock heard sweet music borne on the distant air. The strain seemed to swell louder, and he awoke. The vision was gone, but music yet came to his ear in strains such as angels might breathe.
While, through the west, where sinks the crimson day,
John turned to look at Sherlock expectantly. “Can I assist you?” was the cool response.
Carlo looked upon the ground, and made no reply. It seemed impossible, that Moriarty could take this measure merely for Sherlock’s preservation; and so very strange was his sending him from the castle at all, that he could attribute it only to the design of carrying into execution the new scheme of vengeance, with which he had menaced Sherlock. In the next instant, it appeared so desirable to quit the castle, under any circumstances, that he could not but rejoice in the prospect, believing that change must be for the better, till he remembered the probability of John being detained in it, when sorrow and regret usurped his mind.

He determined, however, to watch on the following night, when his doubts might, perhaps, be cleared up; and he at length resolved to address the figure, if it should appear again.
'No,' said Caterina, 'that is my business,' and left the room instantly, while Molly would have followed; but, being called back, she began to talk very loud, and laugh, and seemed afraid to trust a pause of silence.

Of this disorder Molly could give no explanation, and Moriarty, having attempted, for some time, to persuade Sherlock to talk, retired, after ordering Molly to remain during the night, and to inform him, in the morning, of Sherlock’s condition.
Mary looked poised, elegant; but Sherlock looked strong, powerful and somehow… expansive, almost. He was all light and shadow; moon-white skin and dark hair; the lighting overhead sharply outlining the muscles on Sherlock’s calf and extended thigh, in his raised forearm. He was beautiful, so intense and so

'Sherlock,' said the Count, 'why will you reduce me to adopt this conduct? How much more willingly would I persuade, than compel you to become my husband! but, by Heaven! I will not leave you to be sold by Moriarty nor to destroy yourself. Yet a thought glances across my mind, that brings madness with it. I know not how to name it. It is preposterous—it cannot be.—Yet you tremble—you grow pale! It is! it is so;—you—you—love Moriarty!' cried Wilkes, grasping Sherlock's legs.

With light and hasty steps Sherlock passed through the long galleries, while the feeble glimmer of the lamp he carried only shewed the gloom around him, and the passing air threatened to extinguish it. The lonely silence, that reigned in this part of the castle, oppressed him; now and then, indeed, he heard a faint peal of laughter rise from a remote part of the edifice, where the servants were assembled, but it was soon lost, and a kind of breathless stillness remained. As he passed the suite of rooms which he had visited in the morning, his eyes glanced fearfully on the door, and he almost fancied he heard murmuring sounds within, but paused not a moment to enquire.
'The Signor has the key,' Mycroft replied.
'Soon after sun-set,' said he, 'I will be at the end of the east rampart. Tell Barnardine,' he added, 'to be punctual to the time; for that I, also, may be observed by Signor Moriarty. Where is the Signor? I would speak with him.'
Bill leant back in his chair, one foot up on his knee as he stretches his arms expansively. “You really need to relax, mate. Lighten up.”
Holmes, some time after, spoke of Monsieur Mycroft, his wife’s elder son. 'Let me inform you of a circumstance, that nearly affects your welfare,' he added. 'We have, you know, had little intercourse for some years, but, as he is now your only relation, I have thought it proper to consign you to his care, till you are of age, and to recommend you to his protection afterwards. He is not exactly the person, to whom I would have committed my Sherlock, but I had no alternative, and he is your brother, so must I believe him to be upon the whole—a good kind of man.’
“Really exciting stuff, Irene, the whole Arena is on the edge of their seats watching these titans of sport.”
They were all again silent, and the countenance of Moriarty changed. 'This is no illusion of the fancy,' said Douglas, at length breaking the profound silence.—'No,' said Bertolini; 'I heard it myself, now. Yet here is no person in the room but ourselves!'
With abrupt candour, that endeared Sherlock to John, if possible, more than ever, John was told that he was an idiot; and reminded that Sherlock, who at nineteen was some time from achieving the age of his majority at twenty-one, could not be married without the consent of a guardian.  John was confident they could lie to the friar and so be married; but was crestfallen when Sherlock then pointed out this would certainly invalidate the marriage in the eyes of the law.
But lofty souls can look beyond the tomb,
Meanwhile, Molly did not appear, and Sherlock was surprised, and somewhat alarmed for her, whom, and it was improbable, that she would have failed to come to her apartment, unless something unfortunate had happened.
About an hour before sun-set, La Voisin shewed him the way through the woods to the convent, which stood in a small bay of the Mediterranean, crowned by a woody amphitheatre; and Sherlock, had he been less unhappy, would have admired the extensive sea view, that appeared from the green slope, in front of the edifice, and the rich shores, hung with woods and pastures, that extended on either hand. But his thoughts were now occupied by one sad idea, despite his attempts to occupy it with reason alone, and the features of nature were to him colourless and without form.
'I think,' resumed Molly, 'the Signor would do well to hang it in a better place, than this old chamber. Now, in my mind, he ought to place the picture of a lady, who gave him all these riches, in the handsomest room in the castle. But he may have good reasons for what he does: and some people do say that he has lost his riches, as well as his gratitude.'
Looking at everyone swaying to “the Girl from Ipanema,” it would have been easily to think he’d got away with it, smiling as he saw Mike sweep Molly into a small dip at the song’s finish. But no such luck.
'I am Anthonio, one of the Signor's soldiers,' replied the voice.
John glances at the screen only to jerk upright as he sees a familiar tall figure striding out to the floor carrying a red hoop.
'Good God!' exclaimed Holmes, 'you surely will not destroy that noble chesnut, which has flourished for centuries, the glory of the estate! It was in its maturity when the present mansion was built. How often, in my youth, have I climbed among its broad branches, and sat embowered amidst a world of leaves, while the heavy shower has pattered above, and not a rain drop reached me! How often I have sat with a book in my hand, sometimes reading, and sometimes looking out between the branches upon the wide landscape, and the setting sun, till twilight came, and brought the birds home to their little nests among the leaves! How often—but pardon me,' added Holmes, recollecting that he was speaking to a man who could neither comprehend, nor allow his feelings, 'I am talking of times and feelings as old-fashioned as the taste that would spare that venerable tree.'
Sherlock’s scattered thoughts were now so far returned as to remind him, that the light exposed him to observation likewise, and he was stepping back to remove it, when he perceived the figure move, and then wave what seemed to be its arm, as if to beckon him; and, while he gazed, fixed in surprise, it repeated the action. He now attempted to speak, but the words died on his lips; as he was doing which, he heard, from without, a faint groan. Listening, he presently heard it repeated.
In the evening, Moriarty sat late, carousing with his guests in the cedar chamber. His recent triumph over Count Wilkes, or, perhaps, some other circumstance, contributed to elevate his spirits to an unusual height. He filled the goblet often, and gave a loose to merriment and talk. The gaiety of Douglas, on the contrary, was somewhat clouded by anxiety. He kept a watchful eye upon Verezzi, whom, with the utmost difficulty, he had hitherto restrained from exasperating Moriarty further against Wilkes, by a mention of his late taunting words.
A sigh, a tear, so sweet, he wish'd not to controul.
Having sat in darkness for some hours, his ear suddenly caught the notes of distant music, to which he listened attentively, and, soon perceiving this to be the instrument he had formerly heard at midnight, he rose, and stepped softly to the casement, to which the sounds appeared to come from a lower room.
Something clicks for John. “Is that why you were attacked?” he asks, looking at Sherlock.
“Very,” said Sherlock, staring over at the man, slight and small. “Well, as long as you’re feeling safe. John! Time to go!” he finished, striding away.
“What!” spits Mary, clutching her jacket tight around her, leaning into to Sherlock’s personal space. “You’re a psychopath!”

“Yes,” says John, startled.
Now he was swimming towards him, arms breaking smoothly through the water. Sherlock watched, paralysed half by alarm and half by anatomy
'I see you are still thinking of Mons. Watson’ said his brother. ‘Pray get rid of all those fantastic notions about love,  they are nothing to the purpose—for your marriage with the Count takes place tomorrow, you know, whether you approve it or not.'
'Degrading indeed, my poor friend!' said Madame Petitbois. 'You may rely upon it I will contradict the report wherever I go;' as she said which, she turned her attention upon another part of the company; and Douglas, who had hitherto appeared a grave spectator of the scene, now fearing he should be unable to smother the laugh, that convulsed him, walked abruptly away.
Sherlock, who had observed his father and concluded his illness was very severe, endeavoured to persuade him to defer travelling till the afternoon; but he seemed very anxious to be at home, and his anxiety he expressed repeatedly, and with an earnestness that was unusual with him. “I am as well as I have been, of late” said he, “and I could better bear travelling the cool hour of the morning, than –ah!”
mind, certainly. If you were to ask him, he’d probably say his arch-enemy. He does love to be dramatic.”
“Oh, oh, um, sorry,” John jabbers as he backs away from Sherlock’s legs, swinging as he changes his stretching position. Sherlock’s left leg is behind him, bent at the knee as Sherlock grips his foot overhead, forming a perfect arch with his body, still looking up at John with those blue-green eyes.
Here's some scenery of the Languedoc-Rousillon region our travelers find themselves in today- they have come out of the mountains and are approaching the coast.
'Well,' said Sherlock, 'but that does not prove, that an apparition guards it.'

So John stares at the floor and is never so relieved in his life as when Sherlock walks in, team jacket flapping behind him.  “Ah, excellent, excellent. Oh look, our teammates. Let’s say hello.”
“Well, a 15.6 there for Muntean, with Deng Shudi of China coming up to the bars now. One of your favourite gymnasts, Kate?”
“Er, yes, we used to train together before she changed disciplines.” John tries to remember what the gymnastics head had told him to say in case he was asked this very question. “But she’s doing well and in good spirits, she’s focused on her job right now and hopefully she’ll be ok for tomorrow.” He gets it, more or less, and hopefully it sounds natural. He smiles brightly at Connie.

“16.316! Look, Sherlock, you got it exactly!” John huffed out a surprised breath. “That was amazing!”
John feels the bags slip out of his fingers as all the blood in his brain rushes south.
“There is no ‘usual’ in this case.”
'Then, sir, we entirely misunderstood each other,' replied Sherlock, at a loss, for to move away from Moriarty was to move closer to the Count.
John’s trying to simultaneously crane his head up to examine a huge sculptural light fitting and look down at the union jack lit up on the stair treads; it’s hard not to be overawed. There are people everywhere; people in their Team GB uniforms; businesspeople in suits, official lanyards conspicuously displayed; white-jacketed waiters manhandling drinks trays. It all funnels out into a large colonnaded courtyard with a huge TV screen at one end that seems to be playing a mix of enthusiastic slogans and stock footage from tourism UK, as if people have never seen Piccadilly Circus before.
“Mary Morstan…”

Mike exhaled loudly through his mouth, going back to his left foot. “Thought about it all night, can’t get it out of my head.”
'Would you, indeed, be glad?' said Sherlock, in a tone of mournful reproach.

OMG Is this the re-entry of John to our narrative? Only time (and possibly future chapters) will tell!
Caterina now brought the wood, and its bright blaze dispelled, for a while, the gloom of the chamber. She told Molly, that Mycroft had enquired for her, and Sherlock was once again left to his own sad reflections.  To call off his attention from subjects, that pressed heavily on his spirits, he rose and again examined the room and its furniture. As she walked round it, he passed a door, that was not quite shut, and, perceiving, that it was not the one, through which he entered, he brought the light forward to discover whither it led. He opened it, and, going forward, nearly fell down a steep, narrow stair-case that wound from it, between two stone walls. Sherlock wished to know to what it led, and was the more anxious, since it communicated so immediately with his apartment; but, in the present state of his spirits, he wanted courage to venture into the darkness alone. Closing the door, therefore, he endeavoured to fasten it, but, upon further examination, perceived, that it had no bolts on the chamber side, though it had two on the other. By placing a heavy chair against it, he in some measure remedied the defect; yet he was still alarmed at the thought of sleeping in this remote room alone, with a door opening he knew not whither, and which could not be perfectly fastened on the inside.
“Of course,” John echoed. “How did you go in the individual events, then?” He felt, rather than saw, Sherlock’s head turn back towards Victor and focus on him.
'And so,' said Sherlock smilingly, 'as you must talk of them to somebody—'
'Remove the veil, Molly.'
It is, however, a fact that in sport that you only get one chance. That is its fascination, and its agony.  You show up at the predetermined time and place and do what you can on the day, and hope that it’s enough. The years of training, the tedious months of saying no to chips and cigarettes and cocaine, the countless hours on the floor; they all funnel down to 90 seconds in front of a judging panel who look at you and give you points. If the hoop rolls away, there’s no second chances, no ‘best of three;’ you just lose. There is no doubt, in the end.
John, mean while, was returned to Estuviere, his heart occupied with the image of Sherlock; sometimes indulging in reveries of future happiness, but more frequently shrinking with dread of the opposition he might encounter from Sherlock’s family. He was the younger son of an ancient family of Gascony; and, having lost his parents at an early period of his life, the care of his education and of his small portion had devolved to his brother, the Count de Hariette, his senior by nearly twenty years. John had been educated in all the accomplishments of his age, and had an ardour of spirit, and a certain grandeur of mind, that gave him particular excellence in the exercises then thought heroic. His little fortune had been diminished by the necessary expences of his education; but M. Watson, the elder, seemed to think that his genius and accomplishments would amply supply the deficiency of his inheritance. They offered flattering hopes of promotion in the military profession, in those times almost the only one in which a gentleman could engage without incurring a stain on his name; and John was of course enrolled in the army.  John’s ardour for whatever is great and good in the moral world, as well as in the natural one, displayed itself in his infant years; and the strong indignation, which he felt and expressed at a criminal, or a mean action, sometimes drew upon him the displeasure of his tutor; who reprobated it under the general term of violence of temper; and who, when haranguing on the virtues of mildness and moderation, seemed to forget the gentleness and compassion, which always appeared in his pupil towards objects of misfortune.
When he recovered his recollection, it was to the sound of approaching footsteps.  He had scarcely strength to remove from the room, and regain his own; and, when arrived there, wanted courage to remain alone. Horror occupied his mind, and excluded, for a time, all sense of past, and dread of future misfortune.  When his spirits had recovered their tone, he considered, whether he should mention what he had seen to Monsieur Mycroft; but he was aware of the terrible consequences, which such a communication might lead to; and, dreading the indiscretion of his brother, at length, endeavoured to arm himself with resolution to observe a profound silence, on the subject. Moriarty and Verezzi soon after passed under the casement, speaking cheerfully, and their voices revived him to full sensibility.
“Without a doubt Kate. The men are in fine form tonight, looking strong and confident. We’ve seen the floor, pommel horse, horizontal bar and vault so far with strong results on each apparatus. Nearing the end of this subdivision, we’re looking well placed to qualify for the team finals; with Mike Stamford, John Watson and Philip Anderson all aiming for a berth in the individual all-around final. With a maximum of two athletes from each nation able to make the finals, the atmosphere will be tense down on the floor as we head into the final two rotations.”
'Oh, you mean THIS picture,' said Sherlock, with returning calmness. 'Well, Molly, here is nothing more to engage my attention; we will go.'
“She’s been so dominant here at these games Irene, already picked up three golds and a bronze medal here at Rio and is expected to control the floor today with her signature powerhouse move.   The other gold medals up for grabs this evening are the pommel horse, expected to be a showdown between British teammates John Watson and Bill Murray, and the parallel bars, where John Watson competes amongst a tight field.”
s,” his mother says with supreme disinterest, “must we separate you again?”
To his own solitary chamber he once more returned, and there thought again of the late conversation with Moriarty, and of the evil he might expect from opposition to his will. But his power did not appear so terrible to Sherlock’s imagination, as it had formerly: a sacred pride was in his heart, that taught it to swell against the pressure of injustice, and almost to glory in the quiet sufferance of ills, in a cause, which had also the interest of John for its object. For the first time, Sherlock felt the full extent of his own superiority to Moriarty, and despised the authority, which, till now, he had only feared.
“Come along,” Sherlock said to John, pulling him up to the door. A large, bristling man stood at the entrance. John walked up to the podium behind which the man was standing.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock said, irritation covering the mild embarrassment in his voice. He knew how to Google search ‘how to have gay sex’ and ‘how to bottom’. It wasn’t rocket science.
“Then you’re not as a good a detective as you claim,” John said, smiling and climbing up the bed to wrap himself around Sherlock. “You’re going to need to shower before Lestrade calls. You’ve still got makeup on.” Sherlock scoffed.
“Of course, I had forgotten.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “If you simply stopped changing it, I would be able to remember.”
“It is most certainly fair. You’re the one who neglected to tell me that you’d never done this, therefore not allowing me to plan accordingly. Now you have to wait.”
I'm trying to keep the sex as realistic as possible, if anyone has any suggestions, I'd welcome them :) I promise we'll get into the more explicit stuff next chapter
“We had just been talking, I did like her, you know, as far as people go. She was slightly more than tolerable. But then she just sank to her knees in front of me, and at first I wasn’t really sure what she was doing. Thought she might have dropped something, though I hadn’t seen her drop anything. And then her hands were on my belt, and that really was too much already. I mean the kissing was...manageable, but really. So I removed her hands, stood up, and went to the sofa to watch crap telly. She must have got the hint because she didn’t try it again.” He paused. “She made an interesting comment to me a bit later. That she ‘knew what kind of a man I was.’ At first, I thought she was referring to the fake engagement and how that wasn’t the nicest thing, you know. But now, I think she might have meant she knew I was gay. Though that’s a bit of a leap, I think. I wouldn’t need to be gay to refuse Janine.” He rolled his eyes.
The countdown had begun downstairs. Sherlock was trying to judge John’s face and having a hard time of it. He looked...angry? Perhaps. But when the countdown hit one, Sherlock decided he didn’t care. He had gone to plenty of lengths to ensure tonight would pay out how he wanted.
“Ah,” and John’s hand on his shoulder were the only response Sherlock received and he continued, slowly pushing up to his first knuckle before pulling out and working the finger back in. Sherlock continues this, enjoying John’s little “mmm”’s and “ahh”’s as he works in another finger and pushes them deeper. But when Sherlock curls his fingers slightly, pressing against John’s prostate, he receives an entirely different noise.
“Because, John, the shoes.” Sherlock picked one of the dress shoes from the bed, pushing John lightly to sit on the bed. He kneeled in front of him. That was a sight. Sherlock’s hair tousled and smelling of fruit and flowers from what he assumed was a woman’s shampoo, his eyes ice blue and framed by those lashes, his red lips so close...John looked up when Sherlock bowed his head to take John’s stockinged foot in his hand. “These shoes are the opposite of mine,” Sherlock was saying. “The heel is invisible from the outside, but on the inside adds a bit of height to your short stature. Just enough that we’ll be more easily believable.”
“Tell me about it then,” John was smirking. “Go on, tell me about being a vampire.”
“Yes, he’s a...cousin. Distant cousin. He turned Mycroft, who turned me.”
“Hmm, yes,” Sherlock said, his attention now on one of John’s jumpers. “She’s actually an adopted sister.”
“Yeah? What’s that?”
“Well,” Sherlock said slowly, “I didn’t think it was that important, and also, I thought that with all of Mycroft’s jabs, you would have figured it out. It’s not really that surprising, it is?”
“Of course there’s always two of us,” John said, smiling as he leaned up to press his lips against Sherlock’s.
“What?” John was still breathless.
“Eh, I was a bit in and out, busy being gay with victorian era you.” John was laughing now.
It was dead silent for a moment, and then John started laughing. He couldn’t help it. He was laughing so hard that his eyes were watering.
“You heard me, get undressed and get in.”
“What other thing?” John sighed.
“Why are we up here?” he asked. “The party is downstairs.”
“Alright, John” Sherlock’s voice called from the bath.
“Alright,” John said, and kissed Sherlock again, letting himself fall into it as it deepened.
“Cheryl? Really?” John asked. “And Hamish? You know I hate my middle name.”
“No. Mary has been having some trouble adjusting to our lifestyle. Eurus took her hunting. She’ll be gone for the week.”
“Oh, no. But that’s how long it’s going to be before Lestrade calls me with a case he’s been working on. It’s an odd one, so I’m going to have to actually go to the crime scene. Lots of fun,” he finished, smiling.
“Well, do you remember the case with the hound at Baskersville?” Sherlock asked and John nodded, “and how I had mentioned that you had lost an entire Wednesday without knowing once?” Again, John nodded. “Well…”
“What?”
“It’s not alright, Sherlock, you can’t just decide to go shagging while we’re on a case.” Sherlock noticed the hint of jealousy in John’s voice.
“Uh, it’s just that, um, this isn’t...isn’t, well you know…”
“I don’t have anything oil based,” Sherlock mused. Why was that? He thought. “Hmm...There’s coconut oil in the kitchen.” John raised up to look  at Sherlock, his brows arched.
“Hello,” John said, striding across forward and shaking Sherrinford’s hand. “Hi, Molly,” he whispered, and she smiled at him.
“Good, I’ll talk to Mycroft, make him believe it’s his idea, and I’m sure he’ll send a car for you. Don’t be intimidated by him; he won’t hurt you.” Sherlock had turned to leave the DI’s office, but just before stepping out turned back. “He’ll probably offer you money to spy on me.” And with that, left the station.
John saw Sherlock’s face fall, watched as the man in front of him became very small as he looked down and shuffled his feet a bit. John’s heart ached. Sherlock had been trying to do something good, and while it was selfish, it was also for John.
“Hmm, no it doesn’t.” Sherlock began to spout of all the reasons for why, in fact, it did make more sense, as John cocked his head to the side and smiled. “I’m not rubbing you off in the shower, Sherlock.” Then, John turned and went into the bathroom, locking the door behind him. He stepped under the cold water and shivered. It had been a good idea to lock Sherlock out. He wanted to do this right and re he couldn’t risk that. There would be plenty of time for shower sex later. There was no rush; neither of them were going anywhere. He found the thought incredibly satisfying.
“On loan from Mycroft,” he said, answering John’s unspoken question, how had he afforded all of this. “Get dressed.” Sherlock said, but didn’t leave.
“You’re not going to kick me, are you?” John asked, lifting Sherlock’s legs.
“Well,” Sherrinford said gravely, “she will be dealt with when she returns.”
“John?”
“I don’t bottom.” John paused, and then looked up at Sherlock who was looking back at him innocently.
“John,” he said, his voice low, and John had a moment of doubt. Wavering, his grip lessened around Sherlock and Sherlock took the opportunity to spin and push John down on his bed. Sherlock hit his knees, slowly removing John’s shoes.
“O-oh, sherlock, again. Do that again.” Sherlock obliges, brushing his fingers, making a sound escape from deep in John’s chest. Sherlock smiles, adding a third finger, and working slowly until he can again press that sweet spot. He can feel John’s thighs tighten around him.”Sherlock.” He grinds his teeth. “I want you now.” His voice is low and full of need. Sherlock reaches for more of the coconut oil, slicking himself. He guides his cock to press against John gently, letting the other man adjust himself if need be. He straightens his back a bit and leans back onto Sherlock, the head stretching John open and causing his fingers to dig into Sherlock’s shoulders.
The boys attempt to get down to it. Musings about Janine happen.
“Please what, John? What do you want?” John thought about it, feeling Sherlock’s weight in his hands before standing and tossing Sherlock onto the bed. John crawled on top of him, pushing his skirt up.
“W-why would I regret this?” John asked, trying to focus.
“God, John, you’re tight.” Sherlock could feel his cock throbbing. John leaned his forehead to Sherlock’s, looking into his eyes as he pulled his hips up and rocked them back down. SHerlock’s eyes rolled back.
“Of course Mycroft would insist on living in the poshest house I’ve ever seen. It belongs in a bloody magazine.”
“What do you mean I couldn’t pull it off? You’re six feet tall. I’m much more in proportion with a woman than you.” His brain caught up to his mouth as he said it and deep blush rose to his cheeks.
“I--“ Sherlock sniffed, “I’ve been a vampire since 1887. Mycroft too. Eurus came later, as did Gavin. The rest were before.”
“Let me draw a bath and I’ll show you.”
“Yes, god yes, SHerlock. Jesus, I want to feel you fill me.” John is shuttering, and Sherlock holds him tight as he begins to pump into him. It’s not long before Sherlock is bucking, spine arching, as he relishes in filling John. He leans back against the tub, breathing heavily. Sentiment. He thinks, but he finds he doesn’t hate it. He certainly doesn’t hate John curled against his chest. But the smaller man is shivering now, the bath water gone cold some time ago. Sherlock adjusts himself, sliding out of John and lifting John up, wrapping a towel tightly around him, before following him out of the tub.
“And will your sister be there?”
“How do you erase a whole bloody person. Sherlock! Your own sister!” John threw the door to 221B Baker Street open.
“True,” Sherlock said thoughtfully, his templed fingers hanging in the air in front of his face. He was trying not to touch his face, not wanting to smudge the hours of work it had taken to get everything right. “But, I’m slimmer and more lithe, plus, these--” he gestured at his breasts, “--and this skirt give the illusion of curves and my shoes give the false idea that these heels are where I’ve gained my height.”
“I’m not sure yet.”
“Sherlock, look I know, but I’ve got to get to the surgery, I’m late and--”
“John, please believe me when I say I didn’t think, and still don’t think, that there was another option at that point in time. I wanted to do it differently. Try to give you a choice, but Eurus is...impatient.” He took a shaky breath and closed his eyes.
“What? Sherlock, why would I--Aah...No” he said simply.
“Of course I have work. I have work every day.” Sherlock hummed.
“And you got the case from lestrade?”
“Of course,” Sherlock said laughing. “Is that what she told?” he asked as he stalked across the room before dramatically turning back to his family with a wide arm outstretched.
“No, you don’t. But I called the surgery and told them you do.” John scrubbed at his face with the hand that wasn’t holding his towel in place and sighed, ready to plow headlong into a lecture as to why Sherlock couldn’t just...do that. Before he was able, though, Sherlock held up his hand to silence John. “You told me that you needed time. Well, now we have all day.” John looked at him with disbelief.
“Hello, Lestrade. I need you to come upstairs. I’ve found him.” Pause. “Yes, the last room on the left.” He ended the call and turned back to the man, lifting his cell from him and after forcing out the man’s password began scrolling through it. When Lestrade and Mycroft entered the room, Sherlock ran down a list of evidence and John relented, allowing Lestrade to cuff the man and lead him off. Mycroft hovered for a moment, then turned to follow Lestrade down the hall. Sherlock and John looked at each other.
“Is Eurus home?” Sherlock asked Sherrinford.
“I guess he needed someone to annoy for eternity.” Sherlock turned to look out the car window at the entry stairs they were pulling up in front of. “He was a new vampire when I returned from university. Mycroft never has been particularly good at self-control when he’s hungry.”
“It’s for a case, John.” He put the glasses away, deciding against them.
“John, I just told you, we’re going to see my family. I didn’t think you’d still be this slow.”
“What?” John shook his head. “Yes, yes I need to--”
“Isn’t what, John?” Sherlock was propping himself up on his elbows now, moving into a sitting position, cautious. John looked up at him, his brow furrowed.
“I promise,” John said, shuttering and was rewarded with Sherlock’s mouth encasing most of his cock, hallowing his cheeks as he sucked, sliding up and down. “G-god Sherlock!” He twirled his hands back into Sherlock’s curls, guiding him to move faster. John could feel himself stiffening, so close to losing it, he prepared to pull Sherlock away, but just seconds before, Sherlock pulled his lips from John’s cock with a loud pop sound.
“Hey now,” John said, pulling tight on Sherlock’s curls, “none of that. Look at me.”Sherlock’s eyes fluttered but slowly opened, looking at John, as Sherlock began to back his hips up, pumping in and out of John, a bit roughly, but not enough to hurt John. He didn’t want to hurt John. No, in fact, John was holding the eye contact, but Sherlock could feel John’s fingers digging deep into his shoulder and the others twitching in his hair. Sherlock pushes fast, tilting up to press into John’s prostate. He pounds against it, watching as John begins to fall apart. He can tell the man around him’s vision is blurring, his eyes unfocused, his breathing hitching as Sherlock continues. He pulls one hand away from John arse and uses it to gently stroke John’s throbbing cock, running a finger over the tip, his hand gentle and soft compared to the force with which he fucks John.
“Sussex.”
He was recalling the conversation he had had with the DI a few days earlier. He had alerted Sherlock to a tip he had gotten about a possible theft that was planned for a New Year’s Eve party. Lots of wealthy individuals in attendance, though mostly a party for businessmen meant so they could leave their wives at home. Sherlock had hatched his own plan quickly, looking at Lestrade.
“Oh, I do,” John assured, his voice low as he traced a finger along an even more extremely accentuated cheekbone, “but I also enjoy it much more when you look like yourself,” he finished, placing a peck on Sherlock’s nose.
“Nope,” John answered, jumping out of bed. “Are you going to shower or should I go ahead while you pout some more?” With that, Sherlock’s face did become pouty.
“Surely three continent Watson can last longer than that,” Sherlock said, smirking. He rose from his knees and was pulled into John’s lap. Toyingly, he began to undo John’s tie, sliding his jacket off, then unbuttoning his shirt, exposing the tan skin beneath. He placed kisses along John’s neck and down his chest, pushing him back onto the bed before licking one of John’s nipples, sucking gently as the nub hardened under his tongue. John’s hands ran down Sherlock’s back and under his skirt. He could feel the thin fabric of the panties he had only gotten to glance at while they were at the party. That felt like a lifetime ago. Sherlock’s arse rested in his hands as he rutted against John.
“Why? Virginity is a social construct, and it’s not as though being one or not being one would have changed me physically in any way, so I don’t really see why it matters.”
“Not the first time.” Sherlock groaned.
“You’re not going to move out?” Sherlock asked, searching John’s face.
John still looked confused, but finally said, “That I want you. And that you’re making it very difficult for me to get what I want.” Sherlock’s cock stirred when John said that he wanted him, but he paid it no mind.
“Because you’ll remember it forever; it should be good.”
“Well, not often,” he admitted, “On occasion, I don’t mind, really. If you, you know.” Sherlock’s worried expression slowly transformed into a beaming smile as he understood.
“We’re going to observe.”
“Missionary then, eh?” John said, chuckling. Sherlock rolled his eyes indignantly, but they shuttered closed as John’s fingertips fluttered over the head of his cock. “Hmm, lube, Sherlock.” Eyes still shut, Sherlock reached to the nightstand, finding the full bottle of lube. John fought with the lid and poured some into his hand, warming it up, before sliding his palm down Sherlock’s stiff length. John paused.
“Uhm, Right.” John said, pulling his jumper over his head. When John pulled down his trousers, he caught Sherlock snickering and quickly looked up, finding Sherlock finally turning away and laughing. “Sherlock,” He said, a bit of anger flaring through his embarrassment.
“She shot John!” he exclaimed, “In the forehead, right between the eyes!” Mycroft’s eyes widened a fraction before he and the rest of the Holmes turned their scrutinizing gaze to John. “She knew I had followed John,” Sherlock went on, “It was all a plot to make me turn him. Now she’s run off to hide from me, like a scared child.” Sherlock sneered.
“A case?” John’s brain was being a bit slow, still dumbfounded by Sherlock’s appearance, something about it causing a feeling John didn’t quite understand.
“John, stop drooling and get dressed. You’re posing as my sugar daddy,” Sherlock winked, a lick of devilishness in his smile. Then he turned, leading the way up to John’s room.
“He’s not.” Lestrade’s face fell a bit. “At least I don’t think so. But a gay couple are sure to accumulate more attention than a sugar pairing, especially in this setting. It would help to keep guests from suspecting John and I. Besides, Mycroft is one of the few people I know who has a stick far enough up his arse to fit the role as people would expect him to.” Sherlock had already spilled the details of how he and John were going to appear. Slowly Lestrade nodded.
“Well, there were extenuating circumstances,” John replied. Sherlock and Mycroft stared hard at each other before Sherlock gave a slight nod.
“I thought you’d be angry.”
“That’s not what I asked.” Sherlock’s voice was tense. John hesitated for a moment.
“Since I moved in. You’re not in my room often, John. No surprise you hadn’t noticed it.”
“Apparently not.” He had noticed Sherlock’s perfect arse, of course, there was no missing it, but it had never been on display quite like this before, and before John could stop the thought, he wondered what Sherlock was wearing beneath the incredibly short skirt.
“Mycroft turned you? Why?”
“No,” Sherlock said simply, cutting John off.
Sherlock’s eyes turned steel blue and sharp. The man had figured him out. But how much had he actually figured out. “Shhhhh,” Sherlock said, his air of flirtation back, “Can’t let daddy find out,” he giggled.
John couldn’t quite pass the threshold of Sherlock and his 221B Baker street apartment when he saw Sherlock pacing in the sitting room. He just stood there, his mouth agape, and his eyebrows arched high in surprise and confusion. When Sherlock noticed him, he stopped pacing. Still, John stood there, looking exactly the same, or possibly even more taken aback because the reason for his shock was not Sherlock’s pacing--no, Sherlock did that quite often as he tried to burn off his incessant energy--but because of what Sherlock was wearing. John could see it now perfectly, not blurred by Sherlock’s quick pace, now perfectly still, directly in front of him.
“No, of course not,” Sherlock answered. John leaned down, mouthing at Sherlock’s hard cock though the sheer fabric of his panties. He could taste and smell and feel Sherlock. Sherlock’s precum created a noticeable wet spot on the fabric and John eagerly lapped at it. But he wanted more. He pulled at the waistband, Sherlock’s hips arching up as John slid the fabric away and over Sherlock’s boots, to the ground. Now he was free to take Sherlock in his mouth, and he did so, tasting the saltiness of Sherlock’s glistening cock, bobbing his head up and down, tongue swirling, as Sherlock felt his thoughts begin to float. Sherlock reached up, riffling through his bedside table and pulling John’s attention from his cock. He held out the bottle of lube and John took it eagerly, noticing it was practically full. Actually, John noticed, when he went to open it, it was full. It was even sealed. Never been opened. He looked at Sherlock, confused. Sherlock shrugged.
“What do you mean ‘false’” John asked, circling behind Sherlock to look at the shoes.
“Why are you interrogating the poor waiter, miss?” the man asked, appraising Sherlock. The waiter caught a glance from the man and disappeared. “If you’re that bored of these stuck up old fellows, perhaps you’d enjoy the party upstairs a bit more.” The man’s eyes looked darkly at Sherlock; this was not the same as how he’d looked at the others, it was different. He wrapped an arm around Sherlock, resting a hand on his hip and slowly leading him to the hall. Sherlock was hoping that John had been watching as he was led up the wide curving staircase.
“Don’t look so surprised. It’s body safe and an oil so it won’t dissipate like most water and silicone lubes. You’re a doctor; you should know that.”
“Just one,” he said, trying to keep the smirk out of his voice.
“Just promise.” Sherlock said, now allowing his tongue to venture back to the head, glistening with precum.
“Perhaps Lestrade could wait until morning,” Sherlock mused.
“I wasn’t sure if this was going to happen, but I figured I should be prepared.” was the explanation he offered up. It made sense actually. John had never witnessed Sherlock bring anyone home. But still, John stuttered to a halt.
“Why can’t we shower together? It makes more sense.”
“Take me home, Sher.”
“John. You don’t know that this is?”
“Yes, alright. I can be part of the distraction.”
“No.” Sherlock was just looking at him and he felt incredibly stupid.
“She shot me,” John said incredulously, pointing to the small, faint, red ring between his eyes. “She shot me, but we’re just going to go take a visit?”
“Sherrinford?”
“John, this is Sherrinford. You, of course, know Molly,” Sherlock introduced.
“Oh, right. I guess I don’t.” They stood there, at the bottom of the stairs for a moment, before John’s hands were tangled in Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock’s lips lustily pressing wet kisses along John’s neck, and John’s towel forgotten on the floor between their feet. “Sherlock,” John breathed. “Sherlock, we probably shouldn’t shag on the stairs.”
“Oh, right!” Sherlock looked as though he’d suddenly had a moment of clarity. “Back to the task at hand, John,” he said, allowing his legs to slide back down the bed.
“Don’t they? Married men, I mean.” When John looked away, Sherlock said softly, “I liked Mary, really I did. She was so interesting, and smart too. She had fooled me and easily hacked into MI6 through her phone, with Mycroft beside her!”
Sherlock remain still, supporting as much of John’s weight as possible and allowing to him work himself down at his own pace. Slowly, John lowers a bit more. His hand leaves Sherlock’s shoulder and tangles in Sherlock’s hair instead, pulled the soft curls and the wet hair that has matted against the nape of his neck. He elicits a quiet gasp from SHerlock’s slightly parted lips and dives into a kiss, pressing his tongue into SHerlock’s mouth as he lowers just a bit more. Sherlock sucks in air as the head of his cock is engulfed by John. Both men stop, breathless. John shakes, his muscles screaming from the tenseness. Sherlock puts his hands onto the back of John’s thighs, trying to support his weight better. John sinks down another inch, his eyes scrunching shut.
“I want to.” Sherlock’s voice was velvet soft and John pressed his own nose against Sherlock’s and rested their foreheads together.
Faster than John had expected, he had his coat and was in a cab, Sherlock snogging him in the back seat. When they arrived at 221B Baker Street, John quickly tossed the notes at the cabbie and followed a determined Sherlock up the stairs and into Sherlock’s room. Now that they were home, and not in the back of a dark cab, John felt a heavy layer of awkward coat him and the room. Sherlock was standing in the middle of the room, his back to John. The sight of him in the lit room made John’s cock twitch against his perfectly tailored trousers. This beautiful man had kissed him and John didn’t want to let this opportunity go to waste. He’d been waiting long enough, ignoring how he felt long enough. He walked up behind Sherlock, wrapping his arm around the man and pressing the front of his trousers against Sherlock’s precariously covered arse. He could feel Sherlock’s heart pounding.
"No idea, never heard tell of this person doin' anything like this before" Raz answered, ignoring my remark. We walked a little while longer, trying to pick him out in the group of people. This place, where all these people hang out, it was like a cavern. All the walls were covered with graffiti, some of it just random nothingness, others, beautiful works of art.
"Yes, she's just inside, and uh, there's something I didn't tell you about her..." Lestrade was fidgeting shirt. I've never seen the man more unsettled on a case before.
"You are not to even thinking about this phone until you eat something and take a proper shower" she said, motherly like. She had always been a motherly figure to Sherlock and I.
Mrs. Hudson had a shocked look on her face. I suddenly felt bad for saying what I had said, but not bad enough to make me feel guilty. Sherlock wouldn't have been happy if he was here. However, if he was here, none of this would be happening right now.
I let out a grunt of frustration. He was right. Of course he was right! The amazing Sherlock Holmes is always right! Gulping, I thought, I could never go back there, not after what happened.
"Wait, you actually kidnapped someone" asked Raz. I turned to face him. He has been so quiet I had forgotten he was there.
"John, I understand this is hard for you, but this case is very important. We're at our wits end. We need your help." He threw me a desperate look. He clearly had no hope on solving this case.
Shut up.
I remained still in bed, trying to decide what to do. It was the same thoughts as every morning. Stay in bed, or get up and eat. Staying in bed always won, because getting up meant facing people and facing people meant hearing their poor attempts on making me feel better.
"My employer asked me to put it there" she stated. I was afraid I knew what was coming next, but I had to ask.
She had a surprised look on her face. Did people really believe I was going to stay in bed forever? To be fair, that's what I was planning.
"And your reading my writing upside down. See what I mean?"
"You're welcome" I replied. "Is your friend, Layla, is she alright?"
From the looks of it, it seemed that Sherlock threw his phone on the ground. He gave me one last look, a look that told me everything we were never quite able to say to one another. Those three words that would have changed everything. He knew if he said them, he wouldn't be able to go through with it, so he kept quiet.
Quite flirting and get to work!
I paused for a moment, letting the thoughts run through my head. "Oh!" A wave of excitement washed over me. I finally understood how Sherlock felt when he figured out something good while making deductions.
"The..the what?" For once, it felt good to be ahead of the game. The look of confusion on Lestrade's face was worth it all.
"Take the Main Street? No bloody way!" He replied, an annoyed look on his face. "There's cops up there, and I ain't gunna get caught. Now keep quiet, I didn't bring you 'ere to make a new friend"
"Nice touch" Sherlock remarked. It took everything in my willpower not to respond to him.
"Please Tess, this doesn't have to be difficult. Just tell me what you know and we'll be done in no time at all" I spoke, trying not say anything that might trigger her temper.
"Come on Greg, it's so simple even you could figure it out!" What I said had been a little rude, but I was too thrilled to notice.
"For once, I actually agree with him" Raz stated. "If you've got nothin' to hide, you should be able to answer his questions." Tess looked shocked. From what I can make out, Raz and Tess are very close. It must have come as a shock to her that her brother was taking someone else's side.
"You make tea for me?" I asked her, confused. I suppose I wouldn't know if she did or not, considering I haven't been in the kitchen.
"John? What are you doing" she asked.
Without stopping, I yelled back "I'll bring your phone back later!"
He walked quickly, not making any acceptions for my limp.
"Happy?" I snapped at her. I didn't mean for it to come out rude. I remember the last time someone other than Sherlock was rude to her. He probably would have attacked me.
He slowly walked towards Sherlock and I. Every step drained a bit of hope from me. How could we possibly get out of this one?
"I was thinking.." she started to say. "Maybe we could go out to dinner, you know, to celebrate!" Dinner. She was asking me to dinner. Wait...was she asking me on a date?! A date...with Mary. Normally, I wouldn't hesitate to say yes, but this time, something was different.
"Mrs. Hudson what if-"
Savor it while you can, you're stuck with me. Ah, there was my favorite smart arse. Lost in my head, I was oblivious to Raz calling out my name.
"If you answer my questions, you won't have to go anywhere" I insisted. I took a step closer, trying to intimate her. "And besides, if you're innocent, you should be able to answer my questions with nothing to hide."
Get out of my head.
"It was Molly."
"What are your plans for today?" Mrs. Hudson asked, trying to make conversation. Human nature was a strange thing. We all hate silence. We'll do anything possible to avoid it.
He turned his head, finally making eye contact. "Show up to what?"
That...actually isn't a half bad idea. If I have to deal with his voice in my head, I might as well put it to good use. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and then opened them again. I was facing Tess, but this time, I saw Sherlock beside her. He gave me an encouraging nod.
"Well, Mary and her two friends ran outside to see what had happened. When they got outside, they saw, well the girl was missing and all that was left was a symbol, on the ground." Lestrade grabbed a pen and paper and started drawing something. After about 15 seconds, he turned the paper around and showed me what he had drawn. It was the letter M with two diagonal slashes, going downwards to the bottom right, through the M.
"Please, call me Mary" she said kindly.
"John Watson, I presume."
"Right. Mrs-er, Mary..." I threw a shy smile at her. What was I doing?! I'm here to solve a case, not get a date! Maybe if I keep repeating that in my head it might stick. "I'm just going to start out and ask some simple questions, okay?" I was trying to be gentle with her. Why was I trying to be gentle? If I'm too gentle she'll think I think she can't handle what's going on, which she can, of course. I mean, I think she can.
"Hello. Yes of course it is what do you want?" He mouthed the word "sorry" at Sherlock, to which he mouthed back "it's fine." It was most civil death threat I have ever seen. These two definitely were not ordinary. Moriarty turned around with an annoyed look on his face. It was silent for a moment but then...
"Fine! You want to know what I know? Ask away!" She fumed. Well, I guess it was progress.
"Probably my answer has crossed yours." Sherlock raised his gun and pointed it at Moriarty. If I hadn't been living with him for the past while, I would have never known that he was scared. And that meant something, Sherlock Holmes doesn't get scared. He slowly lowered his gun to point at the bomb-jacket, not breaking eye contact with Moriarty. His eyes were watery. Jim Moriarty tilted his head to the side, giving him a "What are you going to do" look. I probably looked terrified. I felt it, anyways. A smile played across Moriarty's lips. How could he possibly be smiling, he was about to die.
"John!" Mrs. Hudson said with a warm smile.
"Damn" I cursed under my breath. Although I don't know what I was expecting, you can never rely on Sherlock to get milk. However, I continued making my pancakes. How hard could it possibly be?
"I don't want to bring you to the police station, but I will if I have to." I told her, trying to give my words a commanding tone.
"Oh God yes" I replied, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
I woke with a start, my forehead drenched with sweat. I attempted to get up, but quickly realized I was tangled in the sheets. I fell backwards onto my bed and bashed the back of my head on the headboard. I chocked on a sob, trying to keep quiet so that Mrs. Hudson wouldn't hear. The last thing I needed was for her to come and try to comfort me. It was a nice effort, but never helped.
"Raz please! You have to under-" she tried to speak, but he cut her off.
"My court case. You didn't show up. I got fined for that." I'm not sure why I brought that up, it just felt right.
Tess was shocked with her brother. "I was just trying to make us money Raz! We would have starved!" Raz was having none of it. For the first, and last time, I was actually on his side.
"No-wait." He turned around and looked at me with a surprised face. I stood up."Let me hear the rest of the case, then I'll decide if I'll help for not." A bit of hope flashed in his eyes.
Focus! Don't underestimate her, remember The Woman?
"Ah, John! You're feeling much better today, aren't you?" She was grinning from ear to ear. What had gotten her so happy?
Coming back to reality, Mary was still standing across from me, waiting for me to reply. Jesus, I haven't been this in shock since Irene Adler flirted with Sherlock.
concerned about the team since the attack, you know. Came to see if there was anything that you needed? Wanted to talk about?” he looked at Mary attentively.
“Oh, it’s cold,” John said.
“You know, when you said ‘catch them at it,’ I didn’t think you meant catch the girls at training,” said John, idly watching Mary spinning a hoop on her collarbone before throwing it high in the air. He leaned back on his hands, legs stretched out on the floor and looked at Sherlock next to him, cross-legged and in the position John had fondly begun to label as ‘Sherlock’s thinking pose.’ He’d spent quite a lot of time looking like that last night, asking Sarah all sorts – not just about the attack, the competition, but about her, what did she plan to do after gymnastics, what media interviews she had done before leaving London– even Sarah and John’s short-lived romantic history had come up for examination, which had been some of the longest minutes of John’s life. Not even waiting for the points to come up at the end of the floor routine yesterday had been as excruciating as the investigation a brief relationship between two people that didn’t have as much of a life outside of gymnastics as they probably should have.
Moriarty and his companion did not return home till many hours after the dawn had blushed upon the Adriatic. The airy groups, which had danced all night along the colonnade of St. Mark, dispersed before the morning, like so many spirits. Moriarty delighted in the energies of the passions; the difficulties and tempests of life, which wreck the happiness of others, roused and strengthened all the powers of his mind, and afforded him the highest enjoyments, of which his nature was capable. Of this kind was the habit of gaming, and in this occupation he had passed the night with Douglas and a party of young men, who had more money than rank, and more vice than either.
........
The simplicity of a better taste than Monsieur Moriarty's, was conspicuous in this attire, splendid as it was, and Sherlock's unaffected beauty never had appeared more captivatingly. He had now only to hope, that Moriarty's order was prompted, not by any extraordinary design, but by an ostentation of displaying his family, richly attired, to the eyes of strangers; yet nothing less than his absolute command could have prevailed on Sherlock to wear such attire, that had been designed for such an offensive purpose, much less to have worn it on this occasion. As he descended to dinner, the emotion of his mind threw a faint blush over his countenance, and heightened its interesting expression. When he entered the hall, in which a kind of state dinner was spread, Moriarty and his guests were already seated at the table. Sherlock was then going to place himself by Mycroft; but Moriarty waved his hand, and two of the cavaliers rose, and seated him between them.
These people are all
“My dear, though I would guard you against the dangers of sensibility, I am not an advocate for apathy.  I would not teach you to become insensible. To pride yourself only on the powers of your mind is vanity; if you yield to it, your happiness is lost forever. I have exhausted myself,' said Holmes, feebly, 'and have wearied you, my Sherlock; but, on a subject so important to your future comfort, I am anxious to be perfectly understood.'
from one of my fave Sherlock fanartists, thetwelthpanda, as a way to keep myself accountable to this story.
'My brother must remain quiet,' said Sherlock. 'Go, good Carlo; if we should want your assistance, I will send for you.'
John steps back, smiling up at the wall. Wait, what?
“Ah, Mr. Watson. Do accept my apologies for the interruption, but Miss Morstan has an appointment with the authorities. And Miss Hawkins, you too, of course.”
John watches in fascination as Mycroft starts to rub his leg with the umbrella he’s carrying, apparently unconsciously. “Yes, yes, excellent idea. After you, Miss Morstan,” he gestures with his hand, and just like that, they’re all filing out to a waiting car that’s pulled up right outside the backstage entrance.
By hastening to Musgrovio he intended to remove Sherlock from the reach of Wilkes, as well as to break off the affair: if the Count meant what he called honourably, he would doubtless follow Sherlock, and sign the writings in question. If this was done, so little consideration had Moriarty for Sherlock’s welfare, that he would not have scrupled to sacrifice him to a man of ruined fortune, since by that means he could enrich himself; and he forbore to mention the motive of his sudden journey, lest the hope it might revive should render Sherlock more intractable, when submission would be required.
Sherlock's surprise increased, as he reflected upon Molly's intelligence. 'Alas!' said he, 'what can the officers of justice do against an armed castle? these cannot be such.' Upon further consideration, however, he concluded, that, Moriarty's bands having plundered the country round, the inhabitants had taken arms, and were coming with the officers of police and a party of soldiers, to force their way into the castle. 'But they know not,' thought he, 'its strength, or the armed numbers within it. Alas! except from flight, I have nothing to hope!'
: Poison! Abductions! Tyrannical Husbands! All your favourite gothic tropes, right here in the Mysteries of Musgrovio!
John eyed up the edge of the vaulting table as he bounced from foot to foot at the end of the runway. Catching Lestrade’s signal from the corner of his eye, he spat on his hands and reached down to grab a handful of powder, dusting off the excess in rapid swipes of his palms.
“Like a motherfucker,” Sarah replied brutally. “Nothing stronger than panadeine either – still under the doping regs.”
Sherlock's mind had not yet sufficiently recovered from its late shock, to endure the loneliness of his chamber, and he remained upon the ramparts; for he had lost all wish to explore the gloomy and mysterious recesses of the castle. The ramparts, therefore, were almost his only retreat, and here he lingered, till the gray haze of evening was again spread over the scene.
'What! I, monsieur!—I! not for the world!' Sherlock, turning round, saw Molly's countenance grow pale. 'And pray, what have you heard of this picture, to terrify you so?' said he. 'Nothing, monsieur: I have heard nothing, only let us find our way out.'
?” said John incredulously.
Pounding upon the massive door availed Sherlock nothing, for it scarcely moved. Through the door’s small opening nought could be seen but the departing Carlo, who, with unsteady step, was even now ascending the stairs down which he had so basely lured Sherlock.
Gasping in fright and indignation, Sherlock demanded who detained him.
In countenance.
“Yes,” says John, caught slightly off guard. “In fact, I’ll be seeing some of the rhythmic gymnastics qualification today if I make it back over there in time.” Connie laughs like John pointing at the Arena, clearly visible from the balcony, was a funny joke.
Sherlock remained at the casement, watching as the vivid lightning, that now, every instant, revealed the wide horizon and the landscape below.  The tremendous sounds of the thunder seemed to shake the castle to its foundation; and the wind and rain lashed his skin as he stood gazing.
'Pray did Barnardine tell you this?'
John would never hear Sherlock’s undoubtedly eviscerating response. Sherlock was slowly standing, drawing himself to his full height. Unfortunately, this also totally blocked John’s view of the interloper.
The eldest of the children desisted from her play, and stood still to observe the strangers, while the younger continued her little gambols, and teased her sister to join in them. Holmes looked with pleasure upon this picture of infantine simplicity, till it brought to his remembrance his own daughters, whom he had lost about the age of these, and their lamented mother; and he sunk into silence.
'Desolate enough, young sir,' replied La Voisin, 'I would not pass one night in the chateau, for the value of the whole domain.'
From a little hill he looked back upon Tholouse, and the far-seen plains of Gascony, beyond which the broken summits of the Pyrenees appeared on the distant horizon, lighted up by a morning sun. The trees, that impended over the high banks of the road and formed a line of perspective with the distant country, now threatened to exclude the view of them; but the blueish mountains still appeared beyond the dark foliage, and Sherlock continued to lean from the coach window, till at length the closing branches shut them from sight.
and bend the pensive head.
'This caprice is intolerable,' said he, 'and shall not be indulged: there is no impropriety in the case' and with a flick of his wrist, pushed Sherlock into the Counts’ boat.
***OFF AIR***
He looks up; John looks up, calling out a greeting.
“Too bad. Did you get in trouble?”
“Don’t give me that
Sherlock - he can't win a trick!
Sherlock hesitated at the entrance. ‘Sherlock, my own love! Pray, forgive me – the thought of going from you for ever – I cannot command myself!’ Sherlock looked back at John – he stood, bereft, arms at his sides, the deepest anguish writ across his face. With stumbling tread, Sherlock fell across the room to John’s breast, to have his body encased in the arms of him who would be his protector.
He fixed a terrified look upon Molly, who, intending to quiet him, said 'Yes, sir, it was more than a dream, but it is all over now.'
'What lady?' said Sherlock.
'This seems a wild place,' said Michael; 'there is no house hereabout, don't your honour think we had better turn back?'
Mary didn’t seem to notice though, instead pointing out to a blue and green-clad figure leaning against the wall on the other side of the room. “That’s my bodyguard!” she said, sounding vastly amused. “He’s from the Irish team. Boxer, you know, their events have already finished. Very proactive of me, wouldn’t you say?”
John’s grin faltered a little. “A drink?” He gestured to the small poolside bar. “There’s no alcohol here, of course, but there’s a vending machine, they have powerade, or tea, or coffee? Or snack? They have muffins, or fruit or… something?”
Sherlock's emotion would not suffer him to reply; and John, who now ventured to look up, observing Sherlock’s blank countenance and rapid blinking; pressed him by the shoulder in reassurance. When John spoke again, his voice told the tenderest love. 'I will not presume,' he added, 'to intrude this subject longer upon your attention at this time of your mourning, but I may, perhaps, be permitted to mention, that these parting moments would lose much of their bitterness if I might be allowed to hope the declaration I have made would not exclude me from your presence in future.'
'I now leave the affair entirely to the Signor,' added Mycroft, 'but I must say, that M. Watson never was a favourite with me, and I was overpersuaded, or I should not have given my consent to the connection. I was weak enough to suffer other people's uneasiness to affect me, and so my better judgment yielded to your affliction. But the Signor has very properly pointed out the folly of this, and he shall not have to reprove me a second time. I am determined, that you shall submit to those, who know how to guide you better than yourself.'
'I cannot tell. How can you ask such shocking questions? But nobody ever saw it come in, or go out of the castle; and it was in one place now, and then the next minute in quite another part of the castle; and then it never spoke, and, if it was alive, what should it do in the castle if it never spoke? Several parts of the castle have never been gone into since, they say, for that very reason.'
Sherlock enquired who the cavalier was, that accompanied the Count, but Molly could not inform her.
Sherlock looks down, finally. “You’ll be a public figure when you get back, John. This might be… complicated, post-games.”
'Where have you been so long?' said he, in the same hollow tone, 'I thought you had forsaken me.'
Sherlock observes John carefully. His biceps are covered by protective elastic sheaths that cling tightly to the muscle, the ring and index fingers of his right hand are taped together. Hair looking flat, but some product in it.  He looks small, Sherlock thinks suddenly, smaller even than the other gymnasts as the coach moves up the little springboard to help John get onto the bars.
“I rarely eat.” John stared. “My coach is constantly trying to feed me, but I….”
“Sherlock,” John begins, voice carefully modulated, “what the fuck?”
The family at length embarked, but neither Count Wilkes, nor Douglas, was of the party. Somewhat revived by observing this, Sherlock, when the gondolieri dashed their oars in the water, and put off from the steps of the portico, felt like a criminal, who receives a short reprieve. His heart beat yet lighter, when they emerged from the canal into the ocean, and lighter still, when they skimmed past the walls of St. Mark, without having stopped to take up Count Wilkes.
for it and everything.
Sherlock enquired if she had ever heard the servants talk of prisoners.
'It would be an action worthy the friend of a villain!' said Wilkes, as the strong impulse of his indignation enabled him to raise himself from the arms of his servants; but the energy was momentary, and he sunk back, before turning again to Sherlock.
from the classic sports film, Blades of Glory. In this story, Sherlock's competition consists of a ball, hoop, clubs and rope routine, so it is a similar aesthetic to the women's competition as I felt that fit best with his ballet background (I am a sucker for ballet!lock).
'My poor Molly!' said Sherlock, and made her sit down.
Sinking upon the massy stone ground, and clutching his hair, Sherlock bewailed this latest agony; confined as a prisoner while the castle was besieged, the surrounding mountains infested with hostile parties, who seized every opportunity for plunder.
John was silent a moment before speaking again.  'This Moriarty: I have heard some strange hints concerning him. Are you certain he is of Madame Anderson's family, and that his fortune is what it appears to be?'
Sherlock stayed safe in John’s embrace for some time, hearing only the rhythm of his heart beat and the gentle tides of his breathing.  After some time he became aware that this rhythm had changed; his heart gained speed and his breathing shallowed.  Sherlock considered, carefully shifted his body against John’s, and was rewarded with a gasp.
“Henrryyy!!!!” yelled John, gleeful, Mike and Anderson screaming next to him.
'The only way, by which you can do either,' replied Monsieur Mycroft, 'is to contradict the report wherever you go.'
Sherlock bent his head and attended to his business, fingers flying over the phone’s screen in a prepared sequence. Looking up, John was close, leaning against the room’s high countertop, arms and ankles crossed, looking directly at Sherlock. Shockingly close.
“Wasn’t so bad, was it?” says John, ignoring all the evidence, and strides out of the room and down the hall.
'The Apennines!' said Sherlock, with a groan, 'O! then I have little to hope!'
Another minibus has pulled up behind theirs and starts disgorging more navy and red clad athletes, all adjusting their suits or framing up a photo. “Ready, Captain?” says Bill with a slap on his shoulder. “Let’s go sell us a country and not have any drinks. Or something,” he finishes before starting up the stairs to the entrance.
He had been crammed into in a taxi with John’s thoughtful-looking coach; a Not Impressed Mrs Hudson; and John, who was carrying on about being threatened will trespass charges, but that was nothing; Mycroft would fix all that.
It seems inevitable that he’s run to the training facility, its white walls shivering in the breeze as John’s feet run ever closer to it. Outside, he can hear classical music playing through the tarped walls, something moody and dark. He puts his fingertips to it and thinks about something Sherlock had said about not needing much sleep.
“Sure they will,” steamrolled John. “Look, they’ve got a drawstring and everything.”
‘If I had wished to explain my reasons’ said his father, ‘your promise would have been unnecessary. It is sufficient for you to merely understand the importance of observing me in this instance.  And I have yet another promise to receive from you, which is—that you will never, whatever may be your future circumstances, SELL the chateau.'
'I was not in the way, monsieur,' replied Molly, 'when the first party came in from the mountains, and the last party is not come back yet, so I don't know, whether there are any prisoners; but it is expected back to-night, or to-morrow, and I shall know then, perhaps.'
'It is solitary enough,' said Sherlock, 'but you have no banditti here.'
As part of that I think I need a cover for this work and had some fun with graphic design tonight.  Let me know which one is your fave!
His host, who was called La Voisin, quitted the room, but soon returned with fruits, cream, and all the pastoral luxury his cottage afforded. When the fruit had allayed the fever of Holmes’ palate, and he found himself somewhat revived, he began to converse with his host, who communicated several particulars concerning himself and his family. 'I have only one daughter living,' said La Voisin, 'but she is happily married, and is every thing to me. When I lost my wife,' he added with a sigh, 'I came to live with Agnes, and her family; she has several children, who are all dancing on the green yonder, as merry as grasshoppers—and long may they be so! I hope to die among them, monsieur. I am old now, and cannot expect to live long, but there is some comfort in dying surrounded by one's children.'
Sieger holds it up to his eye where the green foil glints in the sun. As if in slow motion, Sherlock and Mycroft both turn to look at John. Sherlock looks as if he is running through every synonym for idiot that he knows, trying to decide in which order he should unleash them upon John. Mycroft just looks murderous. John feels the flood of adrenaline through his system, his legs itching to run him away from this horrific situation.
Very quickly John could tell there wasn’t going to be an upset to Sherlock’s statistical model today. The ladies were clearly working hard, but it just wasn’t as smooth as the other teams – there were a few moments that, if not quite a fumble, were next door to it.
Sherlock is incredibly conscious of the warmth of John’s body as the bus trundles back to the village. Sherlock catalogues the points of contact; pushed together at shoulder; thigh and knee. Sherlock looks out the window, like always. And John, like always, like he’s never noticed, looks equal parts straight ahead, and at Sherlock.
'I was alarmed both on your account and on my own,' replied Sherlock—'What detained you?'
“Aha, Sherlock. Ça fait un bail, oui?”
John chided himself,
(See the end of the chapter for
'Sign the writings,' said Moriarty, 'and you shall know more.'
“But I haven’t mentioned a figure,” the man starts again.
And so they walk out and John stands behind the podium and looks over at Bill as he receives his medal and that’s weird. And out there in the crowd somewhere, watching him, cheering for him, is Sherlock and his family and that’s weird too, it’s so good and John loves it but so weird. And Sherlock is just a whole bundle of weird, when you think about, but that’s good too and John waves at the crowd and hopes Sherlock can see him.
Sherlock huffed out a breath through his nose, nostrils wide. “John it’s… important,” he said, with a very non-subtle look in Sarah’s direction. John pursed his lips, knowing this fight was already lost.
Moriarty was now also become a daily guest at the chateau, and Sherlock was compelled to observe, that he really was a suitor, and a favoured suitor, to his brother.
“Tense, isn’t it?”
'Yes, you do, sir; you know, that nobody knows any thing about Monsieur Mycroft; and it is plain, therefore, he is gone, the way of the first lady of the castle—nobody ever knew any thing about her.'
It seemed to conceal a recess of the chamber; he wished, yet dreaded, to lift it, and to discover what it veiled: twice he was withheld by a recollection of the terrible spectacle his daring hand had formerly unveiled in an apartment of the castle, till, suddenly conjecturing, that it concealed the body of his murdered brother, he seized it, in a fit of desperation, and drew it aside. Beyond, appeared a corpse, stretched on a kind of low couch, which was crimsoned with human blood, as was the floor beneath. The features, deformed by death, were ghastly and horrible, and more than one livid wound appeared in the face. Sherlock, bending over the body, gazed, for a moment, with an eager, frenzied eye; but, in the next, the lamp dropped from his hand, and he fell senseless at the foot of the couch.
'Spare your words,' said Moriarty, seeing him about to speak, 'your countenance makes full confession of your crime.—You shall be instantly removed to the east turret.'
Sherlock no longer opposed him, as John led him into an adjoining parlour; the manner, in which John had named Moriarty, left Sherlock no doubt that John intended to fight a duel, the lethal consequences of which must be prevented. ‘Do not expect, Sherlock’ stormed John, ‘that I can tamely submit to the authority of Moriarty; if I could, I should be unworthy of you!’
John looks at Sherlock, who was nibbling tidily on his toast, clearly not going to give John any help. “So, competition’s over then?” started John.
Sherlock grits his teeth and gets on with the mission of putting on his tights, rolling them down over the belt and attaching the suspenders to prevent them falling down during the performance. Mrs. Hudson critically inspects his bum to make sure the seam is straight (“give them a hoick up, right up, that’s lovely”) before helping him don the rest of the costume. Properly attired, Mrs. Hudson waves him off to the practice carpet and he starts to go through the routine; focusing on the movements, the throws and leaps, eliminating all useless information from his mind.
, Bill,” John spits out, knuckles white around the edge of the tray.
'What, then, was the subject of your letter to Mons. Anderson?'
(See the end of the chapter for
'Speak then,' said Sherlock; 'what you have to say, I will hear.'
Be mine to read the visions old
In the evening, not choosing to venture down to the ramparts, where he would be exposed to the rude gaze of Moriarty's associates, Sherlock walked for air in the gallery, adjoining his chamber; on reaching the further end of which he heard distant sounds of merriment and laughter. It was the wild uproar of riot, not the cheering gaiety of tempered mirth; and seemed to come from that part of the castle, where Moriarty usually was. Such sounds, at this time, when his brother had been so few days dead, distressed Sherlock, consistent though it might be with the late conduct of Moriarty.
When Molly returned, a few hours after, she told Sherlock, that the porter of the castle wished very much to speak with him, for that he had something of importance to say. This message from the porter, when his first surprise was over, made Sherlock suspicious of some lurking danger, perhaps, because he had frequently remarked the unpleasant air and countenance of this man. He now hesitated, whether to speak with him, considering that perhaps this request was only a pretext to draw him into some danger.
MILTON
It may be remembered, that it was by a door leading into the bedroom from a back passage, that Sherlock had secretly entered a few hours preceding. He now deduced, by the calmness of Mycroft’s air, that he was not apprised of the accident, which had befallen his husband, and was beginning to inform him of it, when Mycroft interrupted by saying, he was acquainted with the whole affair.
Meanwhile, old Carlo had overheard two of Wilkes's servants, who had been ordered to be in waiting with the carriage, beyond the castle walls, expressing their surprise at their master's sudden, and secret departure, for the valet had entrusted them with no more of Wilkes's designs, than it was necessary for them to execute. They, however, indulged themselves in surmises, and in expressing them to each other; and from these Carlo had drawn a just conclusion. He then raised the alarm to Moriarty, and thus rescued Sherlock from the designs of the Count.
“Tight really is the word of the night here Kate, it will certainly be a night to remember. We begin with the parallel bars final, the competitors walking out now. The field is led by top qualifier Sebastian Moran of Ireland, world champion for the last two years in this apparatus. Looking at the rest of the field, we should be paying attention to the two Chinese athletes, Shudi Deng and Hao Yao; as well as German Hans Albers, who all had scores within a fraction of one another during qualifying.”
You like charming rural scenes? We've got em! Rural scenes so fresh you can still smell the sheep!
Sherlock shrugged. “It was fine. The routines are fine. All comes down to execution on the day, really. As you know.”
used and the
Wholly confined to the solitude of his apartment, Mycroft was now reduced to solicit the society he had lately rejected; for Sherlock was the only person, except Molly, with whom he was permitted to converse.
In his reply, he begged permission to remain, at present, at Bakersfield, mentioning the extreme dejection of his spirits, and the necessity he felt for quiet and retirement to restore them. These he knew were not to be found at Monsieur Mycroft's, whose inclinations led him into a life of dissipation, which his ample fortune encouraged.
Between the distress of this circumstance and that of leaving John bleeding, he scarcely knew what he did; he called to Michael to fetch water from the rivulet that flowed by the road, but Michael was gone beyond the reach of his voice in attempting to reclaim John’s horse. John, who heard these calls, and also Sherlock’s distressed calls to his father, instantly understood the subject of his upset; and, almost forgetting his own condition, hastened to his relief. Sherlock’s father was reviving when he reached the carriage; and then, understanding that anxiety for him had occasioned his indisposition, he assured Sherlock and his father, in a voice that trembled, but not from anguish, that his wound was of no consequence.
'Allow me, sir, to explain myself fully, or to be wholly silent.'
Looking again to the reason he had been instructed in his youth, Sherlock strove for some other explanation. Remembering what he had heard of the daring enterprises of Moriarty, it occurred to him, that he had just seen some unhappy person, who, having been plundered by his banditti, was brought hither a captive; and that the music he had formerly heard, came from him. Yet, if they had plundered him, it still appeared improbable, that they should have brought him to the castle, and it was also more consistent with the manners of banditti to murder those they rob, than to make them prisoners. But what, more than any other circumstance, contradicted the supposition, that it was a prisoner, was that it wandered on the terrace, without a guard: a consideration, which made him dismiss immediately his first surmise.
'No, pray, monsieur, do not.'
John turned and struggled again, this time to keep his jaw from falling. The man was
John grabs the phone from where it’s dropped to the floor and looks at it, the picture up reorienting itself helpfully.
As Sherlock descended on the Italian side, the precipices became still more tremendous, and the prospects still more wild and majestic, over which the shifting lights threw all the pomp of colouring. Sherlock delighted to observe the snowy tops of the mountains under the passing influence of the day, blushing with morning, glowing with the brightness of noon, or just tinted with the purple evening.
“Here,” he continued, digging into his jacket pocket again and depositing the proceeds into Sieger’s hand, “take a few more. Go on, you can swap them.”
“Ohooh… oh yes, very tidy, three and a half punch twist, very nice… and oh! Ooh, no, he’s got it! Well, that was a very polished performance from Watson, finishing with a 15.2 on the floor, giving him a final score of 90.641. As it stands, with his main competitors still to complete their final rotation, he leads.”
'That may possibly happen,' said Moriarty, 'unless you yield to my demand: for, come what may, you shall not quit the castle till then.' Mycroft burst into loud lamentation, which he as suddenly checked, considering, that his husband's assertions might be only artifices, employed to extort consent. He hinted this suspicion, and, in the next moment, told him also, that his designs were not so honourable as to serve the state, and that Mycroft believed he had only commenced a captain of banditti, to join the enemies of Venice, in plundering and laying waste the surrounding country.
While he was absent, Sherlock's thoughts returned to the picture; an unwillingness to expose Molly, his single friend in the castle, to the vengeance of Moriarty, had checked his enquiries on this subject. He was now, however, inclined to go back to the apartment and examine the picture; but the loneliness of the hour and of the place, with the melancholy silence that reigned around him, conspired with a certain degree of dread, excited by the mystery attending this picture, to prevent him. He determined, however, when day-light should have re-animated his spirits, to go thither and remove the veil.
“No no, it’s Tallinn. It’s simply marvellous, you put in your word and then they do it on their end and –“
'I will speak to him, Molly,' said he; 'desire him to come to the corridor immediately.'

'There is no answering,' said Douglas, 'for the words of a man in a passion; little serious regard ought to be paid to them. If you persist in your resolution, the consequences may be fatal to both. We have now more serious interests to pursue, than those of a petty revenge.'
SHAKESPEARE
On the following morning, as Sherlock sat at breakfast with his brother, a letter was brought to him, of which he knew the handwriting upon the cover; and, as he received it with a trembling hand, Monsieur Mycroft hastily snatched it from his grasp. As his brother looked it over, Sherlock endeavoured to read on his countenance its contents.
Sherlock looked calmly at him, and saw Carlo’s enquiring eyes fixed on him: and Molly, looking up, screamed loudly; for Sherlock's face was stained with blood, which continued to fall slowly from his forehead: but his attention had been so entirely occupied that he had felt no pain from the wound. Sherlock continued to watch Monsieur Mycroft, the violence of whose convulsions was abating, till at length they ceased, and left him in a kind of stupor.
They chose a walk towards the mountains, intending to visit some old pensioners of Holmes, which, from his very moderate income, he contrived to support, though it is probable M. Anderson, with his very large one, could not have afforded this.
Monsieur Mycroft received with a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors. He disliked them, because they were the friends of his husband; hated them, because he believed they had contributed to detain him abroad till so late an hour of the preceding morning; and envied them, since, conscious of his own want of influence, he was convinced, that Moriarty preferred their society to his own. The rank of Count Wilkes procured him that attention which Mycroft refused to the rest of the company. The haughty sullenness of Mycroft’s countenance and manner, and the ostentatious extravagance of his dress, were strikingly contrasted by the beauty, elegance and simplicity of Sherlock, who observed, with more interest than pleasure, the party around him.
(See the end of the chapter for
As Sherlock approached the shores of Italy he began to discriminate the rich features and varied colouring of the landscape—the purple hills, groves of orange pine and cypress, shading magnificent villas, and towns rising among vineyards and plantations. The noble Brenta, pouring its broad waves into the sea, now appeared, and, when he reached its mouth, the barge stopped, that the horses might be fastened which were now to tow it up the stream. This done, Sherlock gave a last look to the Adriatic, and the barge began to slowly glide between the green and luxuriant slopes of the river. The grandeur of the Palladian villas, that adorn these shores, was considerably heightened by the setting rays, which threw strong contrasts of light and shade upon the porticos and long arcades, and beamed a mellow lustre upon the orangeries and the tall groves of pine and cypress, that overhung the buildings. The scent of oranges, of flowering myrtles, and other scented plants was diffused upon the air, and often, from these embowered retreats, a strain of music stole on the calm, and 'softened into silence.'
“Won’t work on the judges, Watson!” hollered Lestrade. “Or on us, either, nice try though!” seconded Sally Donovan, next to Anthea who didn’t appear to have looked up from her phone at all.
John looks up at his coach who looks blushingly pleased and swoops in to kiss Sherlock’s mum on the cheek. John is grudgingly impressed, and it’s his turn next as Violet plants one on his face and gives his arm a little squeeze.
“Oh Sherlock, Sherlock,” John babbles, knees at his head, and Sherlock feels John’s stubby fingers at his neck, taking his pulse. He lets out a groan; and is rewarded by John’s fingers running through his hair, gentle pressure on his scalp, an accompanying hymn of “oh God, oh God,
by Andy Murray.
'You need not tell us that, good woman,' said Molly; 'every room in the castle feels like a well. I wonder how you contrive to live here; for my part, I wish myself at Venice again.' Sherlock waved his hand for Caterina to fetch the wood.
“You shouldn’t pick passcodes that are simple geometric patterns if you don’t want people to guess them,” replied Sherlock, flicking at the screen with a long finger.
While Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on the spot, he saw the door move, and then slowly open, and perceived something enter the room, but the extreme duskiness prevented him distinguishing what it was. Distracted by terror, Sherlock had yet sufficient command over himself, to check the yell, that was threatening to escape from his lips, and, letting the curtain drop from his hand, continued to observe in silence the motions of the mysterious form he saw. It seemed to glide along the remote obscurity of the apartment, then paused, and, as it approached the hearth, he perceived, in the stronger light, what appeared to be a human figure. The figure remained for some time motionless, but then, advancing slowly towards the bed, stood silently at the feet, where the curtains, being a little open, allowed him still to see it; terror, however, had now deprived him of the power of discrimination, as well as of that of utterance.
'I admire your taste,' said Holmes, 'and, if I was a younger man, should like to pass a few weeks in your way exceedingly. I, too, am a wanderer, but neither my plan nor pursuits are exactly like yours—I go in search of health, as much as of amusement.'
“Just a little softness in the back on that handstand there… slight wobble but managed to perform the Heely from one bar… high tipout moving to the ends of the bars, such a difficult manoeuver, huge flight above the bars that was executed very well. This is not the same routine we’ve seen earlier in these games, Kate, this has got some new difficulty elements added in, he’s really going for it here.”
“Mmm-hmm,” said Sherlock, eyes still on the window. “What does the H stand for?”
“You’ve emerged then, have you?”
John is from Gascony, which is a region in the southwest of France near the border with Spain.  It's people have historically spoken a language called Gascon, which is a dialect of
'You should have been there to have done that,' replied Sebastian. 'You would have been bold enough to have taken it by the throat, though it had been the devil himself; we could not take such a liberty, perhaps, because we are not so well acquainted with him, as you are! But, as I was saying, it stole by us so quickly, that we had not time to get rid of our surprise, before it was gone. We kept constant watch all that night, but we saw it no more.'
“Oh, perk up, you, Anderson’s not that bad,” Mike says gaily, grabbing a handful of fries.
"Mary! How do your friends get over to your house on Fridays?" I was so excited I could jump up and down. I hadn't felt this good since...since Sherlock. It was strange, for the first time, the memory of Sherlock didn't upset me, it actually made me smile.
"GET OUT!" I shouted at him. All the anger I had concealed behind my sadness came out all at once. Everything I had been holding back at the funeral when I saw him, everything I couldn't say there, came out in those two words.
Mary laughed. "You don't have to look so scared." I didn't respond, just smiled. When Mary realized I wasn't going to respond, she spoke. "Goodbye John. I hope we'll meet some other time, on better circumstances." I watched her catch up to Layla, linking arms with her. Was I missing out? Declining her date offer. She's an amazing woman really, but my gut told me to run away from her and never turn back. I have to make a decision now, I thought. Trust my gut, or my heart.
A grin played across his lips.
"Yes...It was Lestrade" She whispered, not making eye contact. I just barley made out what she had said.
"Please John, If you're going to yell at me, save it for later." He's a good man, I thought. Willing to take my wrath later just so he can help save a life.
I decided against eavesdropping and turned the cold water on. I tried to wash away my feelings, if that was even possible.
"I'm not you. Go to sleep"
"Nothing" I replied, almost to quickly. They seemed suspicious, but let me keep talking. "Anyways, uhm, Tess, did you sell that spray paint to someone, or did you put the mark there yourself?" She let out a frustrated sigh before answering.
“God no, of course not. You couldn’t pull it off.” John’s brow furrowed.
“Really?” John looked at him incredulously. Sherlock gave him a look, then spoke into his phone.
John was almost shaking, and when Sherlock had finished with his shoes and leaned up, placing his beautifully long fingers on John’s fly as he undid it, John couldn’t breathe. He hitched his hips when Sherlock tugged at his waistband, pulling his pants down with his trousers and removing them so he could move forward, nudging John’s legs open. John was watching helplessly. Sherlock looked up, locking John with his gaze as his slowly slid his tongue from the base of John’s cock to the tip, tasting a hint of precum leaking out. John’s breathing was shaking, but Sherlock pretended he didn’t notice as he swirled his tongue around the head. John’s hip pushed up, a silent plea. Sherlock smiled and leaned down, taking John’s balls into his mouth and sucking gently, making John groan, his head rolling back. Sherlock took one of John’s hands, leading to the back of his head, where John happily tangled his fingers into Sherlock’s dark curls. It was Sherlock’s turn to moan as John’s grip in his hair tightened, due to Sherlock licking a stripe up the underside of John’s shaft.
“Well, yeah, Sherlock, obviously. I’m a doctor for christ’s sake, I’m aware of this. But it’s not about the physical. You’ve never done anything sexual?”
“Alright, alright,” John said, “Just let me get dressed.” Sherlock’s head snapped up excitedly, then he paused, furrowing his brow.
“You mean he forced you?”
He took John’s face in his hands and quickly leaned down, pressing his lips to the shorter man’s before John could register what was happening. When Sherlock pulled away, he continued to hold John’s face, scanning it for a hint at what he was thinking. He was smiling. Before Sherlock could think about it, John pulled him back into another kiss, sliding his tongue along Sherlock’s lower lip until Sherlock gave way, allowing John’s tongue to slip inside, teasing and tasting. When they came up for air, John pressed his face into Sherlock’s neck, a small whispered request making it’s way up to Sherlock’s ear.
“No, you don’t.” John pressed his fingers to his temples.
“You obviously have much more experience in this area than I. You figure it out,” he said, waving his hand flippantly. John just nodded at that, and took Sherlock’s hand, leading him into the bedroom. Maybe when Rosie got back from where she was staying with John’s friends, they could turn John’s room into a nursery. It wasn’t like they’d be needing the second bedroom now. Mrs. Hudson had been right after all.
“Yes, we have to infiltrate a party.”
“Are you a bottom, John?”
Time to catch the bad guy! And also snog in the back of a cab!
“Yeah, probably.” He admitted, annoyed.
“You can quit with that voice,” he said, and John could hear the bed creak as the man leaned against it.
“Actually the house is Sherrinford’s. It was his family’s estate before they all passed. Mycroft lives in a one bedroom flat in London when he manages to escape the office.” Sherlock dismissed John with the wave of a hand.
“H-he was w-willing!” the man stammered, pointing behind John.
“How do you know that? You’d already OD’d.”
John had heard the heavy thud and immediately bounded into the room. He took one look at Sherlock, in the bed, skirt hiked up, and grabbed the man by the front of his shirt roughly.
John had breathed again when he heard Sherlock speak, but now, with that sound, a feeling of dread washed over him. Was he supposed to interrupt or would Sherlock be upset if he did? What if Sherlock simply wanted this? What if it was for the case? He heard the bed creak again.
“What does this,” Sherlock paused, letting one of his hands move to John’s cock, ghosting around it, his thumb brushing lightly over the head, “Mean to you.”
“John, what does this mean to you?” Sherlock said, staying where he was, but looking up at John.
“No, John,” Sherlock said, stoking John slowly to keep him sated, “When you wake up.” John was shaking his head, absolutely confused. He didn’t understand why this mattered. Was Sherlock attempting for dirty talk and just failing miserably?
Just as Sherlock had hoped, the man excused himself from the other’s company and walked over to where he stood with the waiter, pretending to need a glass of champagne.
“I don’t, I don’t have the flu,” John said.
John shivers as Sherlock presses one of this long fingers against John’s entrance, gently rubbing in circles, working to relax the muscle. “John.” Sherlock sounded firm, his fingers working absentmindedly as he thought. “Are you going to need lube?” It took a moment for the thought to process in John’s hazy mind. When it did, he groaned.
“John, I erased the damn solar system, you think I can’t erase a single minute person?” Sherlock calmly followed him, hanging his Belstaff at the door.
“Oh, John! I was joking!” he said. “Could you really believe? Oh, John, come on now, you’re not that daft.” John was staring at him.
“Which one did you pick?” Sherlock asked, reaching over the edge of the tub for a towel, drying his hands. John watched Sherlock’s exposed chest, his words catching in his throat. When Sherlock’s hands were dry, he held one out to John who quietly handed over the egg.
(See the end of the chapter for
“John, you do realize you’re talking to a man who drugged his entire family on Christmas day in order to work on a case, correct?” John nodded, now realizing there was no getting out of this.
“Sherlock, why are the trousers so long?”
“It’s alright, John,” Sherlock said, standing up and fixing his skirt. He walked over to the two, opening the man’s jacket pocket.
Then, without John or Sherlock meaning for it to happen, John’s foot brushed over Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock dropped John’s foot, his eyes snapping up. John was looking at him, surprise flushed red over his face. Had Sherlock been...hard? The dark look in Sherlock’s eyes scared him, but also pulled him.He pushed his foot back toward Sherlock, moving slowly, until it again brushed against his cock. Yep, definitely hard. John placed the ball of his foot against the base of Sherlock’s cock, slowly rubbing up the underside of his shaft. Sherlock leaned back against the edge of the tub, his hips moving up to John’s foot. John smirked, dragging Sherlock’s legs down and moving over them, placing his knees on the outside of Sherlock’s thighs, caught against the wall in the limited room. His hand closed around Sherlock, pumping up and twisting over the head of his cock. Sherlock’s breath hitched in his throat. His mind was spinning, not quite sure how John had ended up on top of him or where everything had escalated so quickly. John’s face was pressed into Sherlock’s neck, his teeth nibbling along the sensitive skin and raising goosebumps all over Sherlock.
“Why not?” he asked, pausing for a moment. John laughed.
“Didn’t think it was important?” John asked, incredulous. “Of course it’s important, Sherlock!”
“John,” he rubs the man’s back in light circles, “Are you okay?”
“No!” John said quickly, reaching out and wrapping his hand around Sherlock’s ankle. “No, it’s okay. I just, I didn’t know. Why didn’t you tell me?”
Sherlock held open the majestic three-meter high door leading into the parlor. John felt as though he had walked back into the 1800s. While the house did appear to have electricity, the decor hadn’t been updated in at least the past century.
Black velvet thigh high high-heeled boots covered Sherlock lanky legs and exposed an inch of his milk white skin at the top. The top of his thighs, apart from that sliver of heaven, were covered in a plaid, pleated, woolen skirt. The waistband of the skirt reached slightly above the crest of Sherlock’s hips. Here, he had tucked in a frilled black dress shirt. The even more surprising part of the ensemble was that the shirt’s neck line plummeted down the center of Sherlock’s chest, which wasn’t flat. Certainly not flat. Sherlock also sported a full face of makeup, a perfect contour and cranberry lips. The make up at his eyes was clean, a simple wing of eyeliner stoked across and mascara applied to decadently long lashes.
“Angry that you just saved my life? Again?”
“Are you a virgin, Sherlock.” It should have sounded like a question, but it didn’t. In fact, it was more of a gasp than a real statement, a bit of surprise evident in John’s voice. Sherlock pulled away now, fully sitting up and pulling his knees to his chest. He was starting to look pouty.
“How long have you had that?”
“Stealing.” Sherlock said. “There will be many women wearing expensive jewelry and men with fancy watches, much like the one you’re wearing. There’s also going to be a display at the venue, imported jewels or something that are going up for auction later in the year. Lestrade is considered he may be targeting them.”
“That was forever ago, Sherlock. You couldn’t have known this case would come up.” Sherlock simply raised his brow and left the room, spinning on his heel.
The next chapter is probably going to have some holmecest flashbacks, which might get a little dark. not to bad I guess just kind of explicit.
“Can I,” Sherlock clears his throat, slightly flexing his hips.
“Why are you packing? Where are we going?”
“Sherlock, I wasn’t aware that you um,” John paused, not sure exactly what was happening. Was Sherlock a cross-dresser? That didn’t seem quite right; he’d lived with the man long enough that surely he would have noticed if he were. Sherlock was staring at him, silent, watching as the gears in John’s head turned and creaked. Finally, Sherlock rolled his eyes.
When they got into the cab, John felt perhaps he should have some sort of information pertaining to the case. So he started asking questions.
“Yes, I see my brother has finally taken it upon himself to turn you, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft said disdainfully. John smiled tightly.
“Sherlock, I don’t have time--”
“Do you have any”
“Yes,” Sherlock said, enthusiastically nodding his head. “That was sweet, though,” he said, quieter, “that you would do that. For me.” John actually blushed at that. He would do just about anything for Sherlock. Sherlock reached out for him, pulling him down so that he was on top of Sherlock.
“I know it’s embarrassing,” John murmured, “But we need to be safe.” Sherlock knew he was right and finally nodded. “Alright, this is probably going to hurt a bit, but it shouldn't be unbearable. I’m going to need you to tell me how you’re feeling.” He paused a minute, then added, “we might not get the whole way. There’s no need to be upset if that happens; it’s normal; it’s okay.” Sherlock nodded again, but trepidation was written across his face. John smiled at him and crawled up the bed to press a kiss to his nose and then his cheek and ending on his lips. “We don’t have to,” he whispered, and he meant it. If Sherlock decided this wasn’t what he wanted, that was fine. They could spend the day cuddling and have Chinese delivered and watch crap telly. It would be good.
“Quiet,” Sherlock whispered in John’s ear, acting as though he was nuzzling the man’s neck. “They’ll think we’re faking if you don’t play along.” John snaked his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, pulling him tighter against his chest and holding him in place. Sherlock’s position was innocent enough, just enough to signal to the room the type of relationship the two had, but not enough to draw extra attention, the way Mycroft and Lestrade were doing. The way Sherlock was whispering into John’s neck, however, had him feeling a bit fuzzy. A waiter came over, offering flutes of champagne, and John accepted two of them, holding one out to Sherlock.
“What exactly do you think you’re doing?” John asked the man, John’s other hand pushing up against the man’s throat, tightening when he received no answer. The man’s wide eyes turned to Sherlock.
“What? Sherlock, you just said--”
“What do you mean we haven’t got a choice?” John couldn’t figure out what was going on. His head was spinning and his chest hurt.
“Up to you.” He was watching John. “I’m clean.” He added. John nodded and walked back into the bathroom, a small jar of coconut oil in his hands. Sherlock took the jar as John climbed back into the tub. He opened it, scooping out what he hoped would be enough and wiped it on the rim of the tub, then rubbed enough onto his own fingers to start. John got back into position, his chest against Sherlock’s. Sherlock’s fingers moved to John’s entrance once again, rubbing intently at the rim for a few minutes before sliding the tip of his finger inside.
“I’m not going to reward you for being trouble.” The smug look on Sherlock’s face dropped. He suddenly felt as though he had gotten something very wrong. He hadn’t expected John to react this way.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well,” Lestrade smiled at John, “I do work in law enforcement. Have to reinvent myself every thirty years or so. Welcome to the family, mate.” He clapped John on the shoulder.
“That bullet had been obnoxious to dig out,” Sherlock said, eyeing John’s chest, “especially with you wriggling about. Though I guess it probably hurt quite a bit. She did shoot you. She knew I’d been watching. though, knew what would happen…” Sherlock trailed off. “I knew I was going to have to do it eventually. So much time had passed, you were going to start noticing that I wasn’t aging. You already noticed that I don’t eat often. I guess I was surprised you hadn’t figured it out as it was.”
“But I was there. Of course I was there. She knew I was there.” They started up the stairs, but John stopped, tottering on a step just above Sherlock. Sherlock paused, just as John began to fall backward. Quickly, Sherlock scooped him up, and charged up the stairs to John’s bedroom, dumping him on the bed.
“Wh-what?” Lestrade had stuttered, completely surprised by the request. “I didn’t realize that Mycroft was--”
“Yes,” John breathes.
“Ahh, Sherlock, please,”
John kissed Sherlock, hot and wet and sloppy, pushing him backward until the backs of his knees pressed against the mattress. John pulled away and pressed down on Sherlock’s shoulder until he was sitting on the bed, his eyes flickering over John’s half- hard cock.
“Any limits?” John asked, kneeling to remove Sherlock’s pajama bottoms and pants. The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched up.
“Hello, Dr. Watson,” a tall man standing by the settee said, and John tore his gaze from the rest of the room. The man looked like a more severe version of Mycroft and definitely had a bigger stick up his ass. Beside him stood Molly, looking especially petite and frail.
“You need to get dressed or we’re going to be late.” Suddenly, a terrifying thought rushed through John’s mind.
“Mycroft? Who’s Gavin? And what do you mean the rest?”
“Oh John, you’ll see when we get there; the details are so boring to go over. Here, you need to drink this.” Sherlock handed John a lidded cup he had just pulled from a black mini fridge stashed in the corner.
In a half-daze he stumbles on a waitress with a tray of canape-sized beef wellingtons. He crams two in his mouth and grabs another in each hand, wondering if he can position himself to stop the waitress from moving without being too obvious. He settles for hovering a hand possessively over the wellingtons (
'Yes,' said Sherlock, smiling, and glad to escape from more serious thought, 'if we come to the corridor, about midnight, and look down into the hall, we shall certainly see it illuminated with a thousand lamps, and the fairies tripping in gay circles to the sound of delicious music; for it is in such places as this, you know, that they come to hold their revels. But I am afraid, Molly, if once they hear your voice, the whole scene will vanish in an instant.'
On the following morning, he was summoned to Monsieur Mycroft, whose countenance was inflamed with resentment, and, as Sherlock advanced, he held out a letter to him.
'Now I think of it,' said Molly, 'I do believe there are prisoners, for I overheard one of the Signor's men, yesterday, in the servants hall, talking something about ransoms, and saying what a fine thing it was for his excellenza to catch up men, and they were as good booty as any other, because of the ransoms. And the other man was grumbling, and saying it was fine enough for the Signor, but none so fine for his soldiers, because, said he, we don't go shares there.'
Occupied by melancholy reflections and by anticipations as sad, he did not retire to rest, but leaned thoughtfully on his open casement. The scene before him of woods and mountains, reposing in the moon-light, formed a regretted contrast with the state of his mind; but the lonely murmur of these woods, and the view of this sleeping landscape, gradually soothed his emotions, which found relief in quiet tears.
Molly ceased to speak, but Sherlock still appeared to listen. At length he said, suddenly, 'I think I will go to him myself;—where is he?'
“That it is, Kate. The possibility here for Great Britain to go one-two on the podium, Bill Murray, Watson’s long-time training partner, is a strong contender; you could even argue the stronger after Watson had a fall during the team final. These two were gold-silver at the World Championships earlier this year, certainly all of Britain will be watching to see if they can do it again.”
Moriarty looked at him with a wild cast to his features. 'If you will attend to what I say,' he resumed, 'you shall hear the story.'
'Where did you lose it, friend?' said Sherlock to Roberto.
The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,
'If you believe the task will really be so troublesome, I must lament, that it is yours. Perhaps you should resign it.'
Soon after mid-day, they reached the summit of one of those cliffs, which, bright with the verdure of palm-trees, adorn, like gems, the tremendous walls of the rocks, and which overlooked the greater part of Gascony, and part of Languedoc. This was a spot well suited for rest, and the travellers alighted to dine, while the mules were unharnessed to browse on the savoury herbs that enriched this summit.
“My hair?”
As he sauntered on the rampart, Molly appeared at the hall door, looked cautiously round, and then advanced to meet Sherlock.
John watches the back of Victor’s head dissolve into the retreating crowds and clenches his fist. He needs a cup of tea. But first, he has a text to send.
“Yes, yes of course,” said Sherlock after a small pause. “And good luck to you, Victor, for your next event,” he finished, with the air of someone having recalled a difficult word in a foreign language.
And love, and gentleness, and joy, impart.
‘Or feel it, in this case’. Sherlock looked down upon John’s head, the blond hair silvery—grey in the moon-light.
The bus back to the village was jubilant, even without Henry and Lestrade, who would need to stick around for the press conference and photos after. Molly and some of the girls had turned out too and the bus was full of laughter and chatter.
The man hums. “Well, perhaps I can think of something else that may interest you. Won’t you come and be introduced to my parents?”
Monsieur Mycroft observed it; he told his brother that he had been indulging in fanciful sorrows, and begged he would have more regard for decorum, than to let the world see that Sherlock could not renounce an improper attachment; at which Sherlock's pale cheek became flushed with crimson, the blush both of pride and the knowledge of what had passed between he and John in the pavilion, and he made no answer. Soon after, Moriarty entered the breakfast room, spoke little, and seemed impatient to be gone.
For reasons I cannot adequately explain, Princess Anne is one of my favorite royals.  An Olympian herself, she has a
Follow for more thrilling reads over your summer (or winter, if you are in the southern hemisphere like me).  Oddly enough, one of the other works being featured in the serial is a Johnlock adaptation of Northanger Abbey, Austen's work in which the original of this work is so prominently featured.  It's Johnlock literary inception!
At length, the travellers began to ascend among the Apennines. The immense pine-forests, which, at that period, overhung these mountains, and between which the road wound, excluded all view but of the cliffs aspiring above, except, that, now and then, an opening through the dark woods allowed the eye a momentary glimpse of the country below. The gloom of these shades, their solitary silence, except when the breeze swept over their summits, the tremendous precipices of the mountains, that came partially to the eye, each assisted to sink the solemnity of Sherlock's feelings into the deepest gloom. He was going he scarcely knew whither, under the dominion of a person, from whose arbitrary disposition he had already suffered so much, to marry, perhaps, a man who possessed neither his affection, nor esteem; or to endure, beyond the hope of succour, whatever punishment revenge might dictate. The more he considered what might be the motive of the journey, the more he became convinced, that it was for the purpose of concluding the nuptials with Count Wilkes, with that secrecy, which his absolute resistance had made necessary to the honour of Moriarty. From the deep solitudes, into which he was descending, and from the gloomy castle, of which he had heard some mysterious hints, his sick heart recoiled in despair.
“Ergh, it’s horrible!”
A faint blush passed over Sherlock's countenance; pride and anxiety struggled in his breast; appearances did, in some degree, justify his brother's suspicions, but he could not resolve to humble himself so far as to enter into his own defence; and especially not when the address had been so welcome.
Sherlock looked expressively at his informant.
“Not that you’re not very welcome, of course,” says Lestrade; causing John, Sherlock and Mycroft to all stare at him incredulously. “I mean, it’s, ah, good to see you?”
'No, not fighting, but almost as good, for I believe there was not one of them sober; and what is more, not one of those fine ladies or gent either. I thought, when I saw them first, that all those fine silks and fine veils,—why, monsieur, their veils were worked with silver!—boded no good—I guessed what they were, and last night, they were not attired in much beyond the veils, or so I am told!'
The sun, soon after, sinking to the lower world, the shadow of the earth stole gradually over the waves, and then up the towering sides of the mountains of Friuli, till it extinguished even the last upward beams that had lingered on their summits, and the melancholy purple of evening drew over them, like a thin veil. How deep, how beautiful was the tranquillity that wrapped the scene! All nature seemed to repose; the finest emotions of the soul were alone awake. Sherlock's eyes filled with tears as he raised them over the sleeping world to the vast heavens, and heard the notes of solemn music, that stole over the waters from a distance. He listened in still rapture, and no person of the party broke the charm by an enquiry. The sounds seemed to grow on the air; for so smoothly did the barge glide along, that its motion was not perceivable, and the fairy city appeared approaching to welcome the strangers. They now distinguished a female voice, accompanied by a few instruments, singing a soft and mournful air; and its fine expression, as sometimes it seemed pleading with the impassioned tenderness of love, and then languishing into the cadence of hopeless grief, declared, that it flowed from no feigned sensibility. Ah! thought Sherlock, as he sighed and remembered John, those strains come from the heart!
As it turns out, Sherlock’s performance in person is something else altogether. The hoop routine is first, the one John had watched on Lestrade’s phone. On the screen, Sherlock had seemed graceful and smooth; but in person, it is the power that strikes John the most. The height of his leaps, the casual strength in his body as he rolls and tumbles and throws the hoop. He is graceful certainly, and flexible (there is one particular step in the routine where Sherlock balances the hoop under his bum and then backflips over it that causes John to breathe a bit deeply), but it’s the energy and muscle so clearly thrumming under the surface of his skin that really makes John sit up and pay attention.
The aspect of the country now began to change, and the travellers soon found themselves among mountains covered from their base nearly to their summits with forests of gloomy pine, except where a rock of granite shot up from the vale, and lost its snowy top in the clouds. The rivulet, which had hitherto accompanied them, now expanded into a river; and, flowing deeply and silently along, reflected, as in a mirror, the blackness of the impending shades.
Early on the following morning, the travellers set out for Turin. The luxuriant plain, which extends from the feet of the Alps to that magnificent city, covered with plantations of olives, mulberry and palms, festooned with vines; through which the rapid Po, after its descent from the mountains, wandered to meet the humble Doria at Turin. As they advanced towards this city, the Alps, seen at some distance, began to appear in all their awful sublimity; chain rising over chain in long succession, their higher points darkened by the hovering clouds, sometimes hid, and at others seen shooting up far above them; while their lower steeps, broken into fantastic forms, were touched with blue and purplish tints, which, as they changed in light and shade, seemed to open new scenes to the eye. To the east stretched the plains of Lombardy, with the towers of Turin rising at a distance; and beyond, the Apennines, bounding the horizon.
(See the end of the chapter for
On their way, the stranger, whose name was John Watson, stepped on first to speak to his hostess, and she came out to welcome Holmes into a cottage, much superior to any he had seen. This good woman seemed very willing to accommodate the strangers, who were soon compelled to accept the only two beds in the place. Eggs and milk were the only food the cottage afforded; but against scarcity of provisions Holmes had provided, and he requested John to stay, and partake with him of less homely fare; an invitation, which was readily accepted, and the men passed an hour in intelligent conversation. Holmes was much pleased with the manly frankness, simplicity, and keen susceptibility to the grandeur of nature, which his new acquaintance discovered; and his son was not less impressed by the strength’s in the man’s compact frame and the twinkling of his blue eyes.
“Well, Kate, this is an unbelievable day of gymnastics! What a thrilling couple of rounds -that strong vault from Uchimura pulled him above Watson and moved him closer to Verniaiev after the fourth rotation; but in the fifth, a huge performance from the Ukrainian eclipsing Uchimura on the parallel bars, leaving him with the gold medal for the taking. Verniaiev brings an 0.901 lead into the final rotation, where everything is on the line!  High bar is arguably Uchimura’s best event and he will begin with a higher difficulty routine. He fell on this routine in qualifying; that’s got to be going through his mind.”
, thought John, Lestrade’s mindfulness practice paying dividends once again.
'No, monsieur, I called at the door as I passed, but it was fastened; so I thought my master was gone to bed.'
Sherlock then hastened to inform his brother of this short respite, to which the latter made no reply, but appeared thoughtful. Sherlock, at length, recommended, as his brother’s only means of safety, that he should submit to Moriarty's demand. 'You know not what you advise,' said Mycroft. 'Do you understand, that these estates will descend to you at my death, if I persist in a refusal?'
The evening was far advanced, when Mycroft came to his chamber with some wedding ornaments, which the Count had sent to Sherlock. He had, this day, purposely avoided his brother; perhaps, because his usual insensibility failed, or possibly, his conscious now reproached him with his conduct to an orphan child, whose happiness had been entrusted to his care by a dying father.
In the morning, Sherlock was relieved from his fears for Molly, who came at an early hour.
“Righto, ready?” says the host, cheerily, and he hastily puts the glass down at his feet. Hopefully this interview is winding up. His brain is having a tough time thinking of different ways to say “I’m very pleased.”
He shakes his head between his hands, no, and coughs. “Do you feel like you’re going to be sick?” John asks, face close to his, perhaps unwisely close if he really suspects Sherlock is going to vomit. “No,” Sherlock croaks out. John reaches out and cups Sherlock’s face in one hand, gently turns him so that Sherlock is staring into John’s blue, blue eyes. “How many fingers am I holding up?”
“So, you are a couple then?”
“Well…. if you’re finished enquiring about my clothes and hair, I do have some work to do here,” Sherlock said, looking down at John from his full height.
'I can no longer remain here, sir,' said he, 'and I may be allowed to ask, by what right you detain me.'
“RioPodium2016? Please, John,” said Sherlock scornfully. “The merest infant could have guessed it. And don’t think I don’t know that ‘pissoffSherlock’ is going to be your next one, either,” he said without looking up.
'Your situation is, perhaps, not so desperate' said Sherlock, 'as you may imagine. The Signor may represent his affairs to be worse than they are, for the purpose of pleading a stronger necessity for his possession of your settlement. Besides, so long as you keep this, you may look forward to it as a resource, at least, that will afford you a competence, should the Signor's future conduct compel you to sue for separation.'
John rolled his eyes at Anderson’s back as he jumped down from the landing zone.
'This is poor doings!' said Mrs. Hudson. 'Dear boy! do take some food! I have dressed a pheasant, and a fine one it is. Old Monsieur Barreaux sent it this morning, for I saw him yesterday, and told him you were coming. And I know nobody that seemed more concerned, when he heard the sad news, then he.'
'How is this, Signor?' cried Count Wilkes, with trembling emotion.
, thought John,
“Oh no, Daniel Craig all the way!  He looks a bit like you, you know,” Mary trailed off, twirling a strand of hair round her finger.
'This night!' repeated another voice.
'Yes, but—but she has a terrible wound, and could not come to let me out. They thought her dead, at first, and she has not been rightly herself, till within this hour.'
“I’m glad you made it,” he tries again. “The shorts suit you.”
He clapped absently for the athlete that had just finished, looking around the stadium for Sherlock before fumbling in his pocket for his vibrating phone.
“Bill,” said Mike warningly.
Thus he sat, wiping the blood from his eyes, dript there from the wound on his forehead, when a distant murmur broke on the silence, and grew louder and louder, till he distinguished voices and steps approaching. Sherlock then rose to go, but the sounds came along the only passage, by which he could depart, and he was compelled to await in the hall, the arrival of the persons, whose steps he heard. As these advanced, he distinguished groans, and then saw a man borne slowly along by four others. The bearers, being too busily occupied to detain, or even notice Sherlock, so he made his escape.
'Sherlock, I have been looking for you all over the castle,' said she. 'If you will step this way, I will shew you a picture.'
'It is useless to deny it,' said Monsieur Mycroft, 'I see in your countenance, that you are no stranger to this letter; and, I dare say, you have received many such from this impertinent young man, without my knowledge, in my own house!'
'Signor Moriarty has said justly,' replied Sherlock, 'that all explanation may now be dispensed with; after what has passed I cannot suffer myself to give one. It is sufficient for me, and for you, that I repeat my late declaration; let me hope this is the last time it will be necessary for me to repeat it—I never can wish for our alliance.'
Fourteen days ago, Sherlock was leaning into his ear and spilling all of John’s secrets to him without having spoken a single word to him before. And in those fourteen days since, John had seen him do miracles again and again, lightning mind contained inside a body of power and grace, a body that John had had his hands and lips and skin on. Miracles.
The attack on Sherlock leaves us all with more unanswered questions.  Why? How? And who was behind it all?  But besides all that, it's the Rhythmic Gymnastics finals.  How will Sarah and Mary perform?  How will Sherlock perform?  And more importantly, after the events of yesterday, will John be in the audience to see?
Molly stood at the door, in an attitude of hesitation, with the light held up to shew the chamber, but the feeble rays spread through not half of it. 'Why do you hesitate?' said Sherlock, 'let me see whither this room leads.'
Lestrade sighs and fumbles in his pocket before waving his phone at John. “BBC app - data charge’ll kill me, but I can’t be having with your sad face,” Lestrade says into his knees; but John is already navigating his way to the live stream of today’s events.
“Equestrienne is the female form of the word, I think you’ll find,” said Sherlock as he stands and departs.
“But you’re not, are you,” said John. Sherlock looked at John, lain out on the room’s small sofa, rain streaming down on the glass windows behind him. One hand under his head, grey t-shirt pulled tight over the bicep. This same shirt rode up a little at John’s hips, the sliver of warm golden skin exposed there seeming to glow in the room’s dim light. And at the end of the couch, John’s small feet, crossed at the ankles; callouses on the soles white with the chalk of a thousand practices. Sherlock felt a peculiar urge to touch; would they feel dry? Or would they be soft and warm? Would John allow him to take the posterior tibial artery pulse below the medial malleolus of the ankle?
“Christ! Are you even listening to me?!” Lestrade practically roars once they are inside.
Crikey! Are you sure about this Sherlock??
'Stay,' said he, 'and I will tell you more.'
Having crossed the foot of the stair-case, and passed through an ante-room, they entered a spacious apartment, whose walls, wainscoted with black larch-wood, the growth of the neighbouring mountains, were scarcely distinguishable from darkness itself. 'Bring more light,' said Moriarty, as he entered.
Sherlock would have been amused by the new deduction opportunities presented, and the varied conversation that passed during dinner, which was served in a style of splendour he had seldom seen before, had his spirits been less oppressed. Mr. Moriarty was lately come from Italy, had styled himself as a Signor, and he spoke of the commotions which at that period agitated the country; talked of party differences with warmth, and then lamented the probable consequences of the tumults.
John fixes him with a baleful stare.  “Well, Rio’s police cells won’t be appearing on my Instagram, if that’s what you’re asking. You being funny now?”
He’s known Mike for years; they’ve picked each other up off mats after falls, roomed together at a hundred different training camps, and here they are with Olympic medals stuffing fancy bits of pastry into their mouths like they’ve never been fed before, and it all suddenly seems very bright in the courtyard.
Holmes cultivated his son’s understanding with the most scrupulous care. He gave him an intimate view of the sciences, and an acquaintance with elegant literature; he taught him Latin and English. His pleasures were not only of the mind; Sherlock delighted to ramble among the scenes of nature; he loved the wild wood-walks, that skirted the mountain; and still more the mountain's stupendous recesses, where the silence and grandeur of solitude impressed a sacred calm upon his heart and quietened the frantic activity of his mind. In scenes like these he would often linger along, wrapt in a melancholy charm, till the last gleam of day faded from the west; till the lonely sound of a sheep-bell, or the distant bark of a watch-dog, were all that broke on the stillness of the evening.
As Sherlock gazed, with these emotions, upon the turrets of the castle, rising high over the woods, the stranger, whom he believed to be confined there, returned to his remembrance, and anxiety and apprehension, lest he should be John, again passed like a cloud upon Sherlock’s joy. He recollected every circumstance, concerning this unknown person, since the night, when he had first heard the stranger play the song of his native province;—circumstances, which he had so often recollected, and compared before, without extracting from them any thing like conviction, and which still only prompted him to believe, that John was a prisoner at Musgrovio.
“Good evening viewers and it’s great to be with you again as we come to you with the final artistic gymnastics event of the day, of these games in fact, it’s the pommel horse final. It’s already been an outstanding day here for Great Britain, John Watson taking a surprise gold in the parallel bars less than two hours ago, and Amy Tinkler taking a bronze in the women’s floor final later on.
“Yeah it’s all over the news mate. Sounds a bit fishy though if you ask me,” said Mike, intently slicing a baked potato.  “‘I was all, like, whatever,’” said Mike, brandishing cutlery as he forms quotation marks in the air, “pull the other one. If someone pulled a gun at me I’d be shitting myself and no mistake,” he finishes as Molly cackles.
some insights into the marriage of Moriarty and Mycroft; and a ghostly echo interrupts Moriarty's tale of how he came into the possession of Musgrovio.
The sun was now gaining fast upon the sky, and the party quitted the gardens, and retired to repose.
'No, they dined long ago, in an apartment at the north end of the castle, but I know not when they are to go, for the Signor told old Carlo to see them provided with every thing necessary. They have been walking all about the castle, and asking questions of the workmen on the ramparts. I never saw such strange-looking men in my life; I am frightened whenever I see them.'
“But what about
'What reasons were there to suppose she destroyed herself, then?' said Bertolini.—'Aye, what reasons?' said Verezzi.—'How happened it, that her remains were never found? Although she killed herself, she could not bury herself.' Moriarty looked indignantly at Verezzi, who began to apologize. 'Your pardon, Signor,' said he: 'I did not consider, that the lady was your relative, when I spoke of her so lightly.'
Again attune the grove, again adorn the mead!
Sherlock laughs this time, before taking a quick step forward and thrusts the cushion into John’s chest. “Good luck tomorrow, John,” he says, exquisitely formal.
Sherlock’s attempt to sweep into the small room is for naught though; John is not there. Instead there is another of John’s team-mates, the round-faced one, spread out on the couch in pants and t-shirt. Mike.
