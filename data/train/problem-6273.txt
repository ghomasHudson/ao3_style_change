“I want you to suck my cock like you do my fingers, baby. Can you do that for me?” Steve asks, softly.
“I believe you,” Wanda says, kindly. “Of course I believe you. I just… I want you to be careful, because I don’t want you to be doing anything without having a conversation with Steve first.”
“Oh, I’m full of secrets, baby,” Tony replies, a wicked light in his eyes, the first lightness he’s felt in his chest since the night that Pepper died.
Thor starts reading again, and Tony nods off, barely able to keep his eyes open in the warm boredom of the classroom.
“Oh,” Tony says, lamely, folding his hands in his lap. “So, that means… that means that Natasha knew; she knew all this time, and she didn’t tell me either.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Of course I did,” he says, scathingly. “What was the other option, exactly? Have you tell me to my face that it was
He pauses, and then, the world flickers, and he’s back to standing in the aisle at the pharmacy. It flickers again, and then, he’s in the boiler room. He turns around, and he’s standing in a guest room of his manor, recognising it by the décor.
“Steve, I’m actually an expert on this, because a lot of people have said I do it too, but you’re babbling,” Tony says, calmly.
“I know, baby. I know.” Tony’s hand comes to cover his head. He sets him down on the bed. “But you know it was just a bad dream, right? It’s not real. None of it is real.”
For a moment, Tony’s heart is in his throat, and then, from among the tents, Steve suddenly bursts into view, happily astride a magnificent white stallion, galloping off across the dig site.
“James?” Tony says and turns, so that his back is to his family. “James, what’s going on?” he asks, his voice low and hushed.
Steve pulls off, and his hair is sticking to his forehead, matted with sweat. “You like that, don’t you?” he murmurs. “You like my fingers in you?”
Steve laughs, tipping his head back and exposing the pale, lean line of his throat. He kisses Tony swiftly on the side of his head and makes his way towards the stairs.
“Yeah, I like that,” Steve replies, his pale eyes rapt, as he watches Tony take himself in hand and palms at himself.
“Hey, I’m not meaning that as an admonition. I’m just saying that if it were me, and you showed up with an old flame, wanting to invite him for dinner, I wouldn’t be too happy about it either.” James pats him on the hand. “You’re sweet, and you have good intentions, but I don’t think it’s going to end the way you want it to.”
“I would if you’d let me talk,” Tony snaps. “Yeah, okay, I used to fuck a lot of people, which by the way you knew before we started dating so if you’re suddenly having a puritan dilemma that you lost it to a slut, well, I can’t help you there, but you also know
“The serum will cause immediate cellular change. In order to prevent uncontrolled growth, the subject will then be saturated with Vita Rays.”
He gets to scrubbing himself, until the water turns a pink-red with the blood that finally strips off his skin. He doesn’t stop when the blood is gone, though; he starts scrubbing at every inch of his body, all the places that Grant put his hands on. He focuses on his hips, his chest, his throat, between his legs, making sure to clean especially thoroughly there, until his skin feels red and raw and sore, but in a good way, in a way that he can be comfortable.
Steve stares at him, and his face crumples in horror. He drags his hand over his face. “Why…” he clears his throat, “and you killed him, because the two of you engaged in… because the two of you were together? That doesn’t make sense.” He purses his lips thin. “There is more to this story.” He closes his eyes. “Please, Tony, please, just… tell me all of it.”
“Oh, God, Tony,” Steve gasps, making a soft, desperate noise at the back of his throat. “Tony, you feel so… you feel so good,
“It’s okay,” Steve says, noticing his nervousness. “You could never do anything wrong–” His eyes widen. “If that’s what you’re worried about–”
Tony lets out a sound that is more animal than human when Steve slides into him, his hands balancing himself on the couch, as he rocks into Tony again and again.
Steve’s head dips, his mouth sucking a bruise onto Tony’s throat, just below his bonding gland, and Tony shudders right down from head to toe, his hands fisting in the sheets. He splays his legs open, feet resting on the mattress, and Steve settles between his legs, painfully handsome. Tony sighs, when Steve sets his teeth on his skin, nipping, marking, his hands tight in the alpha’s hair, and then, Steve moves lower.
okay!” Steve shouts, and then, starts to cough, vigorously, painfully, his spine bowing under the weight of the strain.
jokes – like yesterday, not to mention all those purchase orders for the exoskeletons, and the contracts for the trial of the leg braces, and she’s going to scream at me.”
If he’s going to die, and he’s fairly certain he is, let that be the last thing he feels, the sensation of Steve’s mouth on his.
He made sloppy mistakes at first, almost got himself thrown in jail, but with the grace of God, apparently, he stayed out of trouble.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m just…” he takes a deep, steadying breath, remembering how it had looked, these two men that he loves more than life itself holding these two children of his that he loves like he loves nothing else in this world. “I’m just
Steve nods, takes it on the chin, and unless Steve has become a terribly competent liar (except for the SHIELD lies, now that he knows about that), Steve takes it the same way that he does.
Steve blushes hotly from hairline to collar. “I mean, I didn’t mean to overstep or assume that we were–”
Tony careens into the parking lot of the police station before screeching to a stop right in front of the entrance. The two of them jump out and head into the doors.
“That’s a small price to say,” Steve says and dips his head down to brush his mouth over hers, curling a hand around the nape of her neck.
Tony shakes his head. “I’m pretty sure that gun was either for me, for him, for both of us, or for James, and I still don’t know which it was,” he says, slowly. “But no, he didn’t. He… he just sort of stopped breathing when James walked in.”
“Stop playing the victim, Tony; we both know it doesn’t suit you. Why didn’t you tell me any of this? Why didn’t you confront me to my face, tell me that I was being a dick and ignoring you and making you feel bad about yourself?” Steve asks, desperately and half-wild. “You’re not shy, Tony. You’ve never been shy, at least not with me. We fight just as hard as we love each other; why wouldn’t you just throw it in my face that I was being a shit husband, a shit father? I would’ve
“I have never once looked at you or our kids and thought you were less by virtue of the fact that you weren’t white,” Steve says, venomously.
“I don’t know,” Steve muses, his voice soft but rough around the edges. “I like seeing your face when I fuck you, but if we’re playing a rentboy fantasy, well, fucking you from behind would be the most appropriate.”
“She beat the shit out of them last night. She was my guardian angel, and I hate saying that because I should be able to take care of myself,” Tony’s lip curls, self-deprecatingly, “but if it wasn’t for her showing up at the right time last night, who knows what would have happened to me?”
“-but I think you’re attractive in a way that sticks. I always looked at myself and thought I was the bodybuilder type, you know? The type that people saw and looked at and thought,
“And the other things?” Tony says, stiffly. “I do not know what impression I have given you, Grant, but I have no interest in taking you upon what you are offering. I am a bonded omega, and my body belongs to my alpha,
Tony pounds on the window until his hands are aching, his knuckles are bleeding, and then, turns in frustration and yells into the night.
Disgust lines his voice at the idea of Natasha Romanoff and her bright auburn hair and her beautiful, mysterious smile, her
Any person who peered through the window would think he had the perfect life. Of course, they would have to peel back the curtains to see the rot that was lingering underneath.
Steve returns, eyes bloodshot, mouth turning down at the corners; he brings Tony back a HYDRA minisub, which Tony starts to take apart in the corner of a warehouse, while Steve is in the other, having one of the SSR doctors and nurses draw blood from his arm.
“Okay, I’m leaving now,” Tony says, quickly. “If you could have the kids in bed by eight, and even if Maushmi gives you the puppy eyes, please don’t feed her ice cream after dinner. She’s like a gremlin.”
Tony watches him go, resisting the urge to lay his head in his hand and sigh like he’s a teenage boy.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought. Here’s what I think. I think that the two of you should choose how this goes, how you want to do this, fulfil all the fantasies you must have had, and I’m happy enough to join you and work my way into the mix somehow, and if… there’s no place for me, I’m happy to sit and watch and get myself off, only if you’re okay with that, of course.”
It’s even Indian gold, which means that Steve had to trek all the way to Iselin to the good jewellers to get it for him.
“Phil. Phil Coulson? He’s, uh, he’s our handler down at SHIELD. We thought, well, a couple of years ago, we thought the Winter Soldier killed him,” she explains, rocking back on her heels.
Tony takes a deep breath and without another word, he closes his phones, puts it away, and then, turns off the light.
and wouldn’t be coming home until late. It was… I don’t know, maybe it was a power move?” he wonders out loud, exhausted, feeling the weariness like a graveyard on his body. “I don’t even know anymore. Maybe she wanted to prove to me that she could insert herself anywhere, and Steve was going to allow it because he preferred her to me, and then, she even gave me marriage advice.”
Tony’s belly twists up in a nausea, a rotten smell filling the air. He jerks around and flees in blind panic through the first opening that he can see, which happens to be a dark pipe tunnel.
Steve cracks a half-smile, even if the grief hangs heavy behind his pale blue eyes. “I know, baby, but you can sleep on your own. I know you can.”
Coulson’s lips thin. “You’re lucky it’s me you’re mouthing off to, kid, and not some other cop that might be tempted to bust your lip for that.” He pauses. “You should go home. You don’t look like you’ve gotten any sleep.”
, he says, dramatically, full of venom, and Tony knows, despite how much that Steve liked Fury, how many times they’ve had him over for dinner, because Tony has always been a good host, a good house husband, the way that his mother taught him, that Steve and Fury’s relationship will never be the same, if only for the fact that it’s landed Tony and Steve on this brown suede couch.
“To be fair, my kids have already met you,” Tony points out. “And they already blabbed to my husband.”
Maushmi’s nails dig into his shoulders. “Tony, please, just trust me for once. You'll feel better as soon as you sleep!”
Tony is late returning from the mess hall one night to his quarters, when a sweaty hand curls around his mouth, arms wrap around his body and drag him into the darkness. A number of hands slam him up against a brick wall, and Tony is struggling, shouting against the hand covering his mouth.
He feels something warm touch his hand, and he startles, looking over at the couch to find that Steve is holding his hand, fingers threaded through his.
“But I can’t stop myself, even if I’m fucking humiliated, and I just keep going and going, until you get that look in your eyes. The one that you have on your face now, the one that makes me think you’re going to eat me up whole.
“That day that I went to his apartment, when we finished talking, when he told me why he was back, that he needed my help with something, I realised that I was running late to pick up the twins from school. By the time I got there, Steve had already picked them up. I wasn’t… I mean, how could I have possibly fucking expected that? Steve hasn’t come home before eight in
Tony nods to himself and laughs a little, self-deprecatingly. “I should’ve…” He drags his hand over his face, and then, rage hurtles through him, like an indomitable wave that starts from nothing. “You, you, you…
Maybe he allowed himself to think too much, to dream too big, to wish for things he had no right or reason to wish for.
He imagines it, though, a pathetic, fleeting moment that carries him into the next life, where he’s round with a child, and Steve is there, by his side, and there’s a boy with Steve’s hair and Steve’s eyes, or a girl, with his dark skin and dark hair and smile.
Steve purses his lips. “I don’t think we were meant to touch this, Colonel,” he says, honestly. “I saw what it did to the Nazis. On a purely scientific level, we couldn’t control the level of power that this gem has in order to ensure that it only ever worked in our interests. On a personal level, I shudder at the thought of someone using that gem at all.”
“I didn’t mean-” Steve takes a deep breath. “There are two kids upstairs,” he repeats, his voice thin and taut.
First, their sex life dwindles. It dwindles slowly, even before Tony even knows what’s happening, and it isn’t even his fault. You know, you hear a lot on TV about
Tony is hot now, the sweat damp around his throat, over his brow; his skin would be red if not for the dark colour of his skin at the way that Obadiah so blatantly and so publicly talks about the parts of his body most pleasing to an alpha.
“Oh?” Tony lifts an eyebrow. “What was it like then? Let me guess, you wanted me to think that you were fucking my husband so I’d do something crazy and hysterical and you’d have conclusive evidence that I was no good for him, that I wasn’t good enough for him? Is that what you were trying to do?”
Steve gives her a lopsided, fond grin. “Because you’re the queen,” he says, tapping her on the nose, which makes her face scrunch up adorably. “The goddess,
And then, he slides three fingers inside Tony, still stretched, still dripping with lube, and Tony cries out, almost throwing himself off the bed.
“Tony,” James sighs. “Tony, he never spends any time with you. He’s never there. You have spent the last year on your own. What sort of marriage is that? The guy can’t be bothered to be there for his fucking family; he can’t be bothered to be a good husband, or a good father to his kids.”
Steve squeezes his hand. “Tony, you weren’t a rebound. I saw you, and it was like… I don’t know, it was like the world shifted, like all the light in that bar was drawn to you. You were… you were fighting off this dick’s advances, and I could see that you were holding your own, barely resisting the urge to punch him in the face, and I couldn’t stop myself from intervening. And then, there was the fight, and you patched me up, and I realised the next morning, Tony, that I hadn’t thought of Bucky once.”
“Aren’t you supposed to be picking up a medal right about now?” Tony demands, flipping the blue HYDRA cartridge between his hands.
“So, it’s not bad enough that he can kill us in our sleep; you want him to kill us while we’re awake?” Steve says, dubiously.
“Well, yeah,” Steve says, awkwardly. “I guess… I just thought that after everything, things seem to be, well,
Steve hums, watching him from beneath hooded eyes. “Good boy,” he drawls, dragging his thumb over his lower lip. “You’re always such a good boy for me, Tony.”
“Nah, I hid in the bathroom,” James says, casually. “I figured you weren’t ready to have that conversation with them yet, considering, you know, we just established things today and we had really good sex, and you were naked under these sheets.”
“What, you a stickler for authenticity all of a sudden?” Tony asks, lightly, trying very hard to keep the snide edge out of his voice.
It’s not the same, though, and Tony or Steve won’t delude themselves into thinking it is; it’s change, a total, uncompromising shift to their lives, and it takes time, takes time to readjust all of those spaces so they fit again.
“Yeah, well, when I said that, I wasn’t thinking of the people who are sleeping with my husband. Somehow, I don’t think that’s exercising your sexuality in a healthy way, you know, sleeping with a married man,” Tony says, coldly.
“Tony!” Wanda shouts into the phone. “Tony, they’re inside the house! They want the kids! Tony! Tony-”
Jarvis looks at him through the rear-view mirror. “Are you saying that someone else killed Pepper? Who?” he asks, curiously.
James leans back in his chair, a wicked grin pulling at the corners of his mouth. “So, what are you waiting for?” he taunts.
Steve’s fingers are tracing absent, random patterns over his pectorals, over his lean abdomen, before they start plucking at the waistband to his sweats.
Tony shakes his head. “James doesn’t just look like Bucky; it’s not just some quirk of genetics or something. James is the spitting image of Bucky Barnes. When he came through the door, Steve just… he went completely catatonic. Couldn’t speak, couldn’t explain himself at all. James… James doesn’t have any memories before HYDRA,” he explains, haltingly. “So, he can’t verify the story at all. But Steve had pictures, pictures he kept in a lock box in our house, so I went and got them. They’re… either there is some really fucking strange genetic quirk going on here-”
“It fucking sickens me, because you didn’t protect me, because you hurt me instead. You hurt me worse than anyone has ever hurt me, and the reason why it was the worst thing that I’d ever felt was that I thought you, of all people, wouldn’t hurt me. I thought you loved me, and then, you didn’t. So, when you say that you did those things, that you hurt me in that way because you were trying to protect me from some worse-off fate, I think that’s bullshit. And frankly, it’s insulting. It’s insulting to tell me that you were trying to protect me because I don’t need you to protect me. I don’t need you to tell me how to feel, what to do, how to think. I am capable of doing all of those things for myself, Steve, and I am capable of protecting myself. I am a grown adult, and I have my dignity, and you robbed me of it, and you are still robbing me of it by telling me this condescending bullshit that you were trying to protect me. And the worst part of your fucking story is that you humiliated me in front of my father who was just looking for a reason to treat me like shit. And you just
“And you know what the sad thing is? I’m hot, Steve,” Tony says, his snarl sharp. “I’m actually hot. I haven’t lost any of that, I am not nearly the mess that I thought I was when I looked at myself in the mirror, but
The twins are busy licking up the stringy cheese as it drifts away from the pizza base, when Tony’s phone begins to ring, shrilly.
Tony shrugs. “I’m a jack of all sexual persuasions,” he drawls. He crooks his finger. “Now, get that handsome body of yours over here, so I can do some exploring.”
James curls his hand around the nape of his neck, firm and full of resolve. “Never,” he says, fiercely. “I am never letting you go, both of you, not again,” he promises, looking between the tw of them, hiding so much pain and want behind his blue-grey eyes. “This is it for me, you two and those kids of yours. You’re it for me.”
“The old white guy who looks down my dress and who told me, about a month after my father died, that I had no business thinking myself competent enough to run a company and that I should go home and see about finding a husband whom he could have an
“I think…” Steve takes a deep breath, feels the ugly thing in his ribcage, that strange blend of grief and resentment that has now become a creature comfort to him in the days that have passed since Tony died, settle. “I don’t think it would be a good idea for me to do it.”
He doesn’t even flinch to tell her that, doesn’t flinch to say that he shot those assholes in the head because they were waving guns in front of his kids’ faces.
“Ma’s keeping something from me too,” Steve tells him. “She’s not saying it in as many words, but I know there’s something wrong, something that she knows about all of this.”
Maushmi’s hand snaps across his face, stinging. When she realises what she just did, her hands cover her mouth.
“Fuck you,” Tony snarls. “Fuck you. Fuck you for ever thinking that I was just some fucking child that didn’t know any better, that I didn’t know what I was agreeing to, that you ruined my life. Did it escape your attention that I am a fucking genius, that I knew exactly what I was getting involved in, and that I lived in Boston too, that anything that HYDRA did there affected me too? Did that really escape your fucking attention?”
, James. I can’t help but think that by staying here, talking about it with you, I’m cheating on him.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’m not saying this to make you feel bad,” he says, even though some part of it tastes like a lie. “I’m just saying that I wake up hard, and I come so hard, quickly, with my hand wrapped around my cock, and sometimes, I use the vibrator or the dildos, but it’s not enough, Steve. It doesn’t feel like
Steve looks at him, carefully observing him, with a somewhat clinical stare, dissecting him and his explanation, and Tony shifts on his feet in discomfort, certain that his face betrays the truth.
“How-how do you know?” James asks, carefully, leaning forward, angling his entire body to face Tony, so that he knows he has James’ full attention.
Steve pulls out, and the squelching sound that his cock makes on its way out of Tony’s bed sends a rush of heat all over Tony. He lifts his head in time to see Steve glaring down at his groin, as he takes his cock in hand, stroking fervently. His hand moves up and down, pale, thin, angular against pale, thin, angular, over and over again, and Tony can see the strain in Steve’s features – he knows, because he’s seen it in the mirror, seen it a thousand times since he came back to Afghanistan, had tried frantically to get himself off only for his lungs to be caught in a vice halfway through his jerk-off session, and the resounding ache and breathlessness to take any and all arousal away.
James falls silent. “My point still stands,” he says after a moment. “You deserve better. You deserve a husband who doesn’t treat you like you’re disposable, like you’re just some ornament on the fucking shelf, who goes and dips his wick in his fucking secretary while you’re at home taking care of his children.”
Tony’s eyes drift over the length of her, this woman who is his nightmare in a voluptuous, red-haired body. “You didn’t come here to give me gossip about someone that I didn’t even know,” he says, finally.
, but I drift out of their heads just as quick. Plus, uh, even with all of these muscles,” he pokes at his own bicep, “I never stopped thinking myself as the guy who couldn’t go out without a whole host of vaccinations because everyone thought I’d keel over and die. You, you’re different. You’re… so much more, and I think… I think back to that night at the bar, and I wonder… I wonder what made you look at me, made you want me, because all I can think about is that I’m still
Steve grasps his hips, tight enough to bruise, and then, suddenly, the world is flipping around him, and he’s on top, straddling Steve, the only purchase he has his hands on Steve’s shoulders. Steve, who is suddenly underneath him, grips Tony’s waist, keeping him still, like a brand of ownership, and Tony sways forward.
Tony lifts an eyebrow. “You’re happy that I enjoyed them?” he quotes, slightly derisively. “Rogers… come on, can you please not bullshit me? I think we’ve both had enough of the bullshit by now.”
Tony, on the other hand, had raged, within the four walls of his room, raged hard and long and honestly, for every time that his mother had slunk away into her room, humiliated and hurt and hands shaking because she didn’t know what she had done wrong, why he didn’t want her, why he would want to hurt her when they supposedly loved each other, he wished his father dead.
James stands his ground, though, his face wounded, and they scream at him and they cry, and Tony has to put them in a time-out and James dissolves into grief when it’s done, barely resisting the urge to burst into tears, but Tony and Steve comfort him and share with him the horror stories of their own forays into first-time parenting.
Steve pads over, crowding him against the sink, and then, wraps his arms around him, folding around him like his shield – Tony knows that there’s something that loosens in Steve’s ribcage like relief when he can hold him like this, like Tony’s a stuffed animal or a weighted blanket, and he’s happy to submit to this kind of affection if it means that the knots of tension in Steve’s shoulders unravel.
“Yeah, my friend, someone broke into her house; they attacked her. She’s on the ground. She needs an ambulance. Yeah, she’s still breathing. She’s face-down on the carpet. She has a head wound, but it looks superficial, so I haven’t moved her just in case. I’m calling her husband as well. Yeah, thanks, thank you.”
Tony sees his eyes land on the fire-blackened, sun-shaped medallion, and a black pit of dread opens up in his stomach. The Nazi’s eyes gleam with triumph, and without hesitation, he picks up the medallion with his bare hands.
“Do you have to… do you have to use those kinds of words?” Steve asks, wearily. “Weren’t you the one that said that slut-shaming was demeaning to people who exercise their sexuality in a healthy way?”
Steve flashes him the edge of his smile, sharp and sudden and brittle. “Isn’t that what you were intending to do when you came here?”
Rumlow paces in front of a still-bound Tony, after having thankfully removing his gag, impatient, angry, uncomfortable, his hands shaking like he knows he’s in trouble and he needs to deliver.
Peter shrugs. “Because you love Steve and Bucky, and they love you, and aren’t you supposed to get married when you love someone.”
There’s a reason why he was brought here, he knows it; so, he finds himself moving across the lawns to the police, creeping up to the first window with a light on that he can see. It’s a low, barred basement window, and it just so happens that it’s Natasha’s cell.
“It’s not good for him,” Natasha continues. “I think… I think he should be spending a lot more time with you and the kids, but he won’t listen to me. There’s always some… account for him to take care of, you know?”
“Excuse me,” Pepper says, sternly, “can you please start the wedding night on your time? Because there’s a bunch of people, who are sitting here expecting a wedding, and that’s not what you’re giving them right now.”
If he looked strange on the floor the way that he did, he definitely looks strange on his feet, with the uniform hanging over his bony shoulders, thin hips, stick-like legs – it should look like something funny, but Tony’s fairly certain that Steve would punch him in the face if he laughed, and then, Rhodey would punch Steve, and it would just end up in a total fucking mess that Tony would just rather do without.
, because frankly, he was pretty shit when they first met, a complete and total virgin and without an inkling about what he liked in bed, but he had saved him for ever having to suffer idiots like that on top of him anymore, with the brief, fleeting hope that he might come from it.
“I could not have trusted that,” he replies, his voice blunt. “I could not have trusted that you would not immediately see some fault in my actions. I do not know you, Lady Natasha. We are not friends, and I was glad… to have you in my chambers these last few months; you spared me a great amount of grief, but I could not trust that you would not go spilling the tale of my dishonour to everyone else. If… if Steve had reacted differently than the way he acted tonight, well, I would be dead.”
“Hey, baby,” Tony says, slyly, as Steve dodges opening the car door and just makes the leap, landing in the passenger seat.
His hand cups Steve’s jaw, squeezing it slightly to smush his lips together, and then, he presses his lips to them.
Tony chews on his lower lip. “He can keep fucking her,” he says, dully, aware of how awful and self-flagellating and unhealthy it sounds, “he can keep fucking her, and I won’t say a thing. I just… I want him to come home to me and to the kids. If he does that, he can go out the door and do whatever he likes.”
“The best,” Tony says, almost dazed, as he makes his way over to the closet, walking inside until he finds his pyjamas, a pair of sweatpants and an old, faded band t-shirt that fits him like a glove.
James perches on the edge of the bed, all that muscle rippling under his naked skin. “Tony, do you think you’re ugly?” he asks, softly.
“I can’t lie or sleep on my stomach because the arc reactor puts pressure on the front of my spine if I do,” Tony goes onto say. “Sometimes, if I get too wound up, too excited, I almost pass out. I have dealt with that for the last, what, five years now. That’s the life
Once Steve is done coming, Tony pulls off his cock, leaning back on his heels, smiling hard with his teeth and waggling his eyebrows.
The tunnel is twisty, and within moments, Tony peers into the black, seeing Zola and a few more Nazis huddled up in another mine car in fast pursuit of them. The tunnel goes slightly uphill, as though headed for the summit of a rollercoaster. The low cross beams and the higher sections in between are causing the Nazis to alternately stand and duck in their efforts to get a clear shot at the lead car. One Nazi times it wrong and gets whacked.
Steve pinches the bridge of his nose. “Tony, I…” his face contorts into an expression of confusion and hurt. “I…
, not because you are nothing compared to me, but because I love you, because I’m attracted to you, and I will totally have sex with you on that couch if it means proving to you just how much I am attracted to you.”
Tony scowls absolute murder. “Because I said so, that’s why.” He curls his hand into a fist on top of the bar. “It’s about time I called the shots in this relationship.”
“You’re right, you’re absolutely right.” Tony takes a step forward. “I shouldn’t have said that. I wouldn’t have liked it if you’d said to me that I didn’t know what I was talking about with my own body either, so it was doubly stupid and unfair for me to do the same thing to you. You didn’t deserve that. Of course you know your own limits. Just… just stay with me, okay? Don’t go anywhere.”
Tony leans up on his toes and kisses him, gently, just a brief touch of his mouth against Steve’s and pulls back.
He strides inside, and the apartment is just as bad as Tony thought it would be, at least from the outside. The walls are ratty, but with the wallpaper peeling off. There’s mould all along the crevices of the walls. The carpet is ripped up and suspiciously stained. The couch definitely looks like it’s seen better days.
Tony pulls away, clapping his hands together to get the twins’ attention. After a moment or two, Peter and Maushmi drag their eyes away from the evil fox and look at him expectantly.
“What the–” Stone swallows hard, before fixing his eyes on Steve. “Who the hell are you? What the hell do you think you’re doing?”
He slips into the back seat just as the twins open their eyes, and they both climb into his lap, and immediately start blubbering, turning his skin and clothes wet with their tears.
Phillips gazes at the photos, then, looking at the corporal. “Corporal, why don’t you go get a cup of coffee?” he says, briskly.
He reads them, each and every one of them, and they’re all of people that he knows, people who are dead and people who are alive, and Tony gets sick of the game pretty quickly.
Steve scowls and makes to lunge to his feet, but Tony reaches out, winds a hand around his wrist, pinning him in place.
Howard’s eyes land on Tony. “What the hell happened?” he demands, without flinching. His eyes wander to Steve. “What the hell were
“Tony,” Steve sighs, “Tony, don’t, it’s okay.” He leans up on his toes and presses his forehead against Tony’s. “I’m sorry.”
“Sex isn’t everything,” Tony says, carefully. “Love means more than sex, and I have that in spades for you, and I believe you have it in spades for me too.”
His fingers are flying over his phones, miles and miles of code running across the screen, a language that only he can understand fluently, as if it were his mother tongue, and then, suddenly, his headset is beeping in succession.
Steve must be able to see the way that the colour flees Tony’s face, and he steps back, letting Tony go suddenly, which makes him stumble back.
Tony finds himself turning red, even if this is hardly the most raunchy, dirty thing that he and Steve have done together (he remembers one night in Cambridge, where Steve had stripped him of all of his clothes in some dirty alley behind a bar, covered him with his bulk, even as he remained fully-clothed, and fucked him until he came hard against the brick wall).
Peter gnaws on his nails, a habit that he picked up from Tony, and he peers up at James with wide eyes, but interested eyes.
“I’ve missed you,” Grant groans, and there’s a slick sound from where his hand is on his cock, getting himself ready. “Did you miss me, Tony?”
“You know,” Steve sounds breathless, like he’d been running, “they really should do something about the lack of security they have at that hospital.”
“We, uh,” Steve exchanged a look with Bucky, “only if you agree, of course, but we want to adopt Peter.”
Steve doesn’t love him, and if he needs to keep reminding himself of that fact to stop himself from doing something stupid like abandoning all of his dignity and self-respect if it means getting an inch of feeling from Steve in comparison to all of the love that he bears him in return, he will.
“I don’t believe you,” Tony retorts, and his eyes find his father’s, who remains silent. “I think you did it for yourself.”
He stares at the bathroom, at the wet towels hanging over the railing and the action figures lying all around the bathroom sink and the toy, velvety snake looped around the tap in the bathtub.
“So,” Tony lets his voice slip into a sultry quality. “What would you like me to do for you, baby? I’m all yours for tonight.”
“Good boy,” Steve drawls. “Now, get the lube out of the table there. I want you to slick up your fingers, get them inside you. I want to see that pretty little hole of yours stretched, so, when I fuck you, it’s going to be an easy slide.”
terrorist. I knew that it meant that I might have to shun my parents, leave my friends, run away, leave everything I knew, and I
“You like that?” Steve says, amazed, and he reaches out, smoothing his hand up the inside of Tony’s thigh. “You like it when I say that I should have paid for you?”
wants to dance with, the one that holds everyone’s purses and wallets so that better, more attractive people can partner off. They wanted my ma to give up on me, you know?”
The three of them had come to a decision at the beginning, that Tony and Steve would work on their relationship, get back to a stable place, while James worked on remembering who he was, coming to terms with everything that he’d learned about himself and everything that had happened to him, the identities that he had to reconcile, and when the three of them were in comfortable places individually, they would come back together and talk about where to go from there.
They look like shit, all of them, courtesy of Agent Carter, but they’re all limping like they’d had their knots caved in, which is definitely something that Tony doesn’t remember Agent Carter doing to them.
The house is empty, and when he comes back to the living room, in front of the television, lies Wanda.
It’s strange, because he’s been to at least a thousand weddings in his lifetime, and he’s heard the whole spiel before, but it’s weird when it includes him.
The Giant Nazi exchanges an alarmed look with Steve, and together, they swing the pistol towards the surprised second Nazi, and it takes two pulls of the trigger to blow him away.
Tony reels back from the question, humiliation like a terrible colour all over his body. “Fuck, Steve!” he cries out. “What the fuck?”
“Oh, I think you know exactly what I mean,” Tony replies, almost taunting him. “Am I disappointing you now, Steve? Is that what this is about? Not conforming to your ideal house husband, not being the good little homemaker that you need, taking care of your house and your kids and having a fresh, hot meal waiting for you when you deign to show up at midnight or later?”
They’re in the middle of a battle against Loki, because the asshole has a thing against Thor and their special, vulnerable little planet is Ground Zero every time the asshole comes up with a new grudge against his brother.
Tony smiles, obscenely, and lets his hand trail down his stomach, spider-walking its way, until his long, piano fingers curl around the base of his cock, stroking upwards quickly, biting his lip when his arousal deepens.
“Okay, I’m going to take out the bugs from the jar in a couple of minutes,” Tony explains, putting his headset into his ear and unlocking his phone. “And when I do, I need you to act normal for it, because they’re probably listening in right now. I’ll hack into it while you keep talking, and I should be able to reverse the feed.”
“There’s a street sign there,” James murmurs, suddenly, pointing at one corner of the frozen image on the screen.
Natasha floods red. “Look, he’s my friend and I just want him to be happy. He should be happy with you, and if there’s anything I can do to… to
He reaches down and picks her up, settling her on his hip, and he turns around to carry her towards their bedroom, knowing that Maushmi won’t let up until she sees him make nice with Steve right in front of him, when he hears another small voice.
Tony flinches, still having enough of that South Indian propriety, sense of shame, that it makes spots of colour bloom all over his body.
“Funny, because there’s a gun on the table there, and somehow, I don’t think you intended to play William Tell with me either. So, I guess that desire changed?”
“You are going to make me ruin my mascara, and then, Pepper will absolutely kill you,” she says, roughly.
And then, time passes, weeks pass, months pass, years pass, and Steve gets married to Natasha, has lovely, white babies with her, and stops visiting his first family, his first husband and the kids from his first marriage, and Peter and Maushmi, as they grow up and their father stops caring and visiting, lose their kindness, turn into cold, reserved human beings, who don’t believe anyone when they say that they’re loved, and only believe the fact that their father inevitably abandoned them for a new, more socially conventional and racially acceptable family, and it’s all because Tony wasn’t good enough for Steve to stay.
Steve growls under his breath, and then, he’s surging forward, dragging Tony against him so that he knocks against all of that hard muscle. His mouth crashes down onto Tony, and Tony groans, opening up underneath his so easily, so willingly. Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, his back, his shoulders, and then, they’re turning, and Steve is bearing him down onto the bed, crawling on top of him, his knees on either side of Tony’s hips, and removing his shirt.
They stay like that for a few moments, and Tony is blissfully warm, blissfully satisfied, and James feels completely solid around him, his fingers dragging back and forth over the slope of his hip.
“I… I don’t know, I’ve… I’ve never been good in situations of high pressure.” Steve is stumbling over his words. “I mean, I’m good with them in a SHIELD context. I’m… I’m good at my job. I’m good, but where the kids are concerned? No, I’m not good.”
“If we were in normal times, I would absolutely leave you alone,” Tony begins, and he can see Steve already puffing up in anger, readying himself for Round 2, “but I feel like if I do, you’re just going to stew in more of this shit.”
They eat their meals together, but they don’t say a word, and then, Steve goes about his day, and Tony goes about his day, and they both retreat to different chambers at night.
When that doesn’t do anything, he rolls his hips out in a quick, dirty grind, and then, he bats James’ hand away, the hand around his throat, and twists their bodies until he’s bearing James down onto the mattress and he’s sitting astride him, his legs on either side of James’ hips.
to see him, Steve. I don’t. I don’t want him to ruin our lives, because that would be unjust. Him, who should have no effect on us at all. It would be unjust.”
It doesn’t not happen, and then, when Tony wakes up as the sun peeks above the horizon line, Lord Steven is absent from the bed.
And then, Maushmi slips down from the sofa, her little, dark hand curving around Steve’s knee to keep her upright, before she pads over to James and climbs onto his other knee. There’s a tiny scuffle between Maushmi and Peter, both of their faces scrunching up in distaste, and they immediately quieten when Tony makes a sharp noise at the back of his throat.
Tony turns around the corner and then, he runs straight into a body that’s lunging at him. The two of them go down in a collision of limbs, and a dazed freshman lifts himself up onto an elbow; he’s wearing a plastic sign on his red and yellow sweater that reads
“Mush,” Tony says, sternly. “You’re being rude. Natasha did us a very nice thing by bringing us dinner. What do we say to people who do nice things for us?”
“Well, it’s not like I ever knew that, right?” Tony asks him, hateful and venomous. “As far as I knew, my beloved husband was a fucking insurance claims agent, who apparently had a fucking mountain of paperwork and constant cases and meetings and conferences and couldn’t be fucked to put his dick in his husband. Bullshit, you were tired. No insurance claims agent is that fucking tired. And I don’t believe you now. I don’t care if you were on a fucking mission. You know why, right? Because you have proven you have no fucking credibility where I am concerned, because you have spent years lying to me. You were a SHIELD recruit when you
Tony turns back to Steve, grinning at him, and the moment is perfect, until there’s an explosion up in the booth, shooting fire and glass into the rest of the laboratory. There’s a man with a pistol, scurrying down the stairs, heading straight for the serum. Abraham decides to intercept him, fear on his face, but he’s shot down by the man.
Tony shrugs. “Fine. Why don’t you come back tomorrow when Rogers is here, and we’ll have an auction?” he taunts.
Tony doesn’t fight him, doesn’t even think to fight him. He drapes his arms around Steve’s shoulders, and when Steve covers Tony’s mouth with his, Tony finds himself moaning, clutching at him.
Dr. Zola steps forward, rubbing his hands together with a borderline smug smile pasted across his weaselly face.
Tony smiles to himself and stretches himself out around James and Steve’s joined bodies, his thighs on either side of Steve and James’ knees. He reaches down his body to grip the base of James’ cock and presses the head between his legs. He parts for James like a ripe peach, and James’ entire body goes tight, like it’s all too much for him, the pressure and stretch in his body from Steve and the hot, sweet flex of Tony’s hole around his cock, like he’s trying very fucking hard not to just rut into him.
Tony sidles up close, his journey up the stairs abandoned, and slides his hand into Steve’s sweatpants, past his briefs, and curls his hand around the base of cock, which is already flushed warm and weeping pre-come into his palm.
Tony nods again, suddenly feeling out of place, out of body, and lets James steer him towards the door, out into the walk. They make it down the stairs in total, utter silence, and they only stop when they reach Tony’s car.
or how much I want you to come all over my face or my filthy slut hole because that’s the only way I could ever come, with you inside me, that was all about you wanting to feel more like a man, because you think you’re losing your grip on me, handsome. That doesn’t sound like a
“He’s the best guy there,” Nat says, practically gushing, brimming with affection. “Everyone absolutely adores him.”
Abraham rushes to the window, but he can’t see Steve through with the force of the glow from the vita rays either.
“When we were… back in Brooklyn, he was short, small, skinny, but he had a mouth the size of New Jersey. He was ordering me around constantly.
“Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division,” James deadpans. “They’re a secret intelligence agency, based here, in the States. When I came back stateside, I guess they didn’t like it too much that an ex-HYDRA, and frankly, they might just think that I’m still HYDRA, was in their territory. They’ve been tailing me.”
In the corner of his eyes, he sees Peter, flipping through the air. Something in Tony’s chest crumples.
“Don’t,” Tony warns. “You don’t know me well enough to plead on my husband’s behalf. What I believe or don’t believe is none of your fucking business.”
Steve rams into James hard, chuckling when James gasps and struggles to breath, clawing forward and finally digging his hands into Tony’s hips, the insides of his thighs, as he spreads him wide open to fit against him, as he’s fucked hard and thoroughly and all he can do is lie there and take it.
“I can’t,” Tony says, roughly, staring away from Steve’s pale, earnest eyes, so different to Grant’s, kinder, gentler, more decent. “I can’t say it, Steve. Not to you, never to you. I made this decision with the belief that I would not survive this night. I have come to terms with that, and I did not make the decision lightly; please don’t ask anything else of me.”
“That doesn’t mean that he doesn’t have them,” James points out. “If you ever want to figure out this whole clusterfuck, I suggest you find out if he has pictures.”
And then, there is a loud vacuum-like sound, as the air is sucked out and the chamber is sealed. Half of the torches still burning in the cavern go out with the sound. The remaining torches continue to extinguish at punctuating intervals throughout the following action, and the snakes immediately flood into the newly darkened spaces.
in the middle of it all,” Tony points out. “You jackass,” he says, scathingly. “I helped you kill terrorists who were trying to poison water supplies in Massachusetts, remember?” He pauses. “You know, I never understood why terrorists would want to poison the water in Massachusetts,” he muses.
Grant’s hands are touching him everywhere, and there are tears stinging at the backs of Tony’s eyes, as he desperately tries to fight him off.
“Hello,” he says, cheerfully. “I’m Tony Stark. I’m assisting Doctor Erskine with the project. And you’re Steve Rogers.”
Steve starts from the bottom and goes up, and the way that he touches Tony makes him feel like he’s precious, like Steve is cataloguing every inch of him to draw onto paper when they’re done.
He puts a hand on Steve’s cock, feels it firm up between his fingers, now that Steve was calm, was breathing at a steady pace, but he only gets to about half-hardness, still flagging every other moment – no matter, Tony’s been with enough people with penises to know exactly how to do this, and had struggled with his own erectile dysfunction in previous years to know exactly how to make someone come even with a soft cock.
His hand closes around the lock leading out onto the grounds. It doesn’t budge when he tries to move it, and so he finally gives up, stepping back.
, you fell asleep.” Tony rubs his hand over his face, and then, his shoulders deflate, sinking onto his torn bedclothes. “I must be going insane,” he says, breathlessly.
The EKG beeps faster and faster, and a glow surges, flooding the entire chamber, hiding Steve from view.
Tony snorts. “I wouldn’t say without jealousy. There was plenty of it before Steve actually got a good look at James.”
Steve is eternally proud of him, thinks the world of him, thinks that he can do anything, genuinely believes that he’s going to make the world a better place. Steve’s face crumpled with emotion, tears dripping down his handsome face, when they got the twins. Steve let him raise the kids vegetarian, agreed to not have meat in the house because Tony didn’t want it contaminating his cookware, agreed to let him raise the kids Hindu. Steve never threw it back in his face, never made fun of him for his strange customs, like not doing anything auspicious or important for a certain one and a half hours each day, or not going out of the house in three, never made him feel like a selfish dick for wanting to pass that onto his children
“Man to man?” Tony taunts, like he’s somehow less than that, because he’s always on the bottom when they fuck, and Steve, Steve’s the real man in this family.
Abraham hits another button, and padded restraints close in on Steve’s head, holding him still. Steve’s wide eyes glow a darker, more intense blue than his normal eyes, and finally, the injector vials empty completely.
“So?” James demands. “In that week I was watching you, I barely saw him with you or the kids. He didn’t help you out at all with them. All I saw was you getting up at the crack of dawn, getting the kids up, getting them ready for school, taking them to school, going to pick them up and take them to each of their activities and waiting for them to finish, and then, bring them home and feed them and put them to bed and go to bed yourself, only to start the next day the same way, all over again. And him? I saw him leave the house at six in the morning every day and return close to midnight. That’s it. Never saw him spend any time with you or the kids-”
“Really?” The way that Steve raises his eyebrow is cool and sharp, a little bitter, a far cry from the warm, fiery alpha that Tony knows. “Because if you really did believe that, you wouldn’t have left me alone in that hotel room like I’d outlived my goddamn usefulness.”
Tony stares at him for a moment then slaps him across the face, hitting him hard enough that it knocks him right off the barstool and onto the floor.
breakable, Tony. Just because I look like this, just because I’m sick as fuck now, does not mean that I am breakable. Do
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Steve says, worriedly. “I mean, Agent Carter, I understand why you came, but Tony–”
, you dick. You smelled like her perfume. There were a lot of mysterious phone calls that I listened into with suspicious wording-”
Wanda nods. “You’re my friend, Tony. I want you in my life, and I’m glad you trusted me enough to talk to me about this, about what’s been going on.”
Tony laughs, harsh and grating. “Me? Acting strange? Between the two of us, baby, I’m not the liar.”
“Even if I don’t, I have a feeling you’re about to tell me,” Tony replies, barely resisting the urge to let the venom creep into his voice.
“I know you said that one day, you’d be able to forgive me, and I’m not… I’m not rushing you or anything, because I know you said
“So, I decided to play that game,” she goes on to say. “I wanted to see how far I could push it.” Her mouth twists, not a smile but close. “I do that, you know? I push things, I push people. It’s my job.”
Inside the chamber, orange light builds in intensity, and Tony, along with all of his technicians, pull on goggles.
Steve rubs at his back, holds him close, and Tony, well, Tony thinks that he might be able to stitch some of the pieces that his insides are strewn in, just in Steve’s arms alone.
“Apparently,” Steve goes on, his voice haunted, “they did it so that nothing would be more important than the mission, so that they’d never have a distraction.” He looks wistful for a moment before he shakes his head. “Soon after she graduated, she was sold to the KGB. She… built kind of a reputation for herself, and that’s why SHIELD sent someone out to kill her. Another agent, his name is Clint Barton. He met her in some shitty motel room in Montana, and he decided to spare her life instead of killing her. She defected, and she joined SHIELD instead. She has a… specific set of skills that SHIELD really likes to make use of.”
Tony’s sick to his stomach at how easily Steve defends her, defends the woman who could be the end of them, their entire family, his fucking
Tony doesn’t resist, because there’s a significant, pained part of him that revels in this, revels in Steve touching him like this, like he still loves him, like there is absolutely nothing wrong with their marriage.
“He didn’t… he didn’t just assault me, Steve,” Tony whispers, fisting his hand in Steve’s shirt. “He didn’t just cut me with those knives. He, I think–”
Toni stares at them. “Are you seriously saying that you want to walk out on our wedding so that you can stop this diner from going up in flames and stop something horrible from happening to this girl?”
She says it with such a darkness to her voice that fury boils deep in his chest as he thinks of Tiberius Stone, what Toni had told him about their relationship, what Stone had done to her, and the indignity of her being forced to see him again, because of fucking business, when he’d tried his damned hardest to put her in a fucking grave.
,” Tony says, firmly. “I think we have gone much too long without consummating this bonding. People will start to talk–”
Tony’s hand comes to cover Steve’s. “Steve,” he says, his voice firmer this time. “Steve, stop, you’re going to hurt yourself.”
“I have sent for a bath,” Natasha murmurs. “You can clean up when it gets here. I suggest you go back into the room, though, when the maids get here, because then, they will see you covered in blood, and that will… result in questions that you don’t want asked.”
Other omegas, the omegas of high society, which Tony does belong to, even if the Starks are considered
Steve chuckles and rubs his hand over his head. “So, I guess… that’s not a good idea,” he says, quietly. “I was just looking for some… some deus ex machina, I suppose.” He has a rueful smile plastered across his handsome face. “Lang sounded so confident, and I just went with it. It was a long shot, I should’ve known that.”
Peter grins up at her, and she can see the tooth in the corner of his smile that is wobbling. “I love you too, Amma.”
Bucky nodded. “He’s our son too,” he insisted. “He’s ours, and so are you, and we just want to make it official. We want to marry you, and we want to adopt him, and we really hope that you’ll say yes, to both of those things. Marry us, Toni; let us adopt your son; let’s be a family together.”
Steve laughs, harsh and grating. “Yeah, you say that now, but a week, two weeks, a month, a year later, when I can’t fuck you like the way you deserve to be fucked, and we’ll see who still believes this is not why we’re together,” he growls.
She leads them, with a demure look on her face, to arguably one of the best tables there, right up against the window, so they can look across the New York skyline.
Toni leans in with a smile. “I want to meet with Tiberius Stone, remembering how it felt like when you fucked me good and hard. Is that too much to ask?” she asks, innocently.
“Will you have dinner with us, James?” Maushmi asks, polite like a little princess, which makes Tony smile with all of his teeth.
He fixes Tony’s eyes with his, without flinching, without moving, so that Tony can peel everything, all the skin and bones and teeth and cells so that Tony can see what’s lying underneath, all of Steve’s pith.
“I let him fall from the train that day in 1945,” Steve says, his voice rasping. “I let him fall, and I didn’t go back for him. If I’d just… held on, if I’d gone to look for him, HYDRA would never have gotten their hands on him; they would never have turned him into the Winter Soldier, and he would never have been forced to kill your parents.” He clenches his eyes. “It’s my fault, Tony,” his voice is thick, “it’s my fault that your parents are dead and that HYDRA hurt Bucky. It’s all my fault, and I didn’t want you to find that out. I didn’t want you to realise that and hate me for it, and I thought… I thought if I just kept you from finding out, everything would stay the same, and you wouldn’t realise that it was my fault. You wouldn’t hate me for my failures, for my weakness.” He huffs out a laugh, harsh and grating. “It turned out that you would hate me for my lies instead. Ironic in the end.”
“Same difference,” Tony waves him off. “But my point is that you’ve kissed James twice since he came into the house, and I haven’t kissed him at all, and I don’t think it’s fair if you kiss him a third time without me having kissed him once.”
