"And now he's kidnapping women from outside the country? He seemed so... ordinary. Certainly nothing like a killer."
“Why can’t
“Nope. No. I’m rubbish at undercover.”
“Between them, they’ve commissioned a refitted warehouse space. It’s all very modern and ergonomic. Flexible shifts, as there is little machine line work. I believe they have an on-site masseuse. And yoga or somesuch. There will be proper work visas provided for any of the displaced women who may wish to stay in the country. The leather and furs will be rendered from overpopulous nutria, imported from America, where it’s an invasive species currently busying itself with destroying the Louisiana bayou, thereby providing a valuable income for those still in the throes of Katrina.”
Sherlock was silent a long moment, deliberating.
Perhaps whoever had abducted him had poisoned his dental floss? If nothing else, the novelty entertained.
“But if Jabez, an
“She’s 16! She’s just a kid. What’s a little kidnapping to the world’s only consulting detective? Shall I remind you that she only did it to save your life? I’ll tell you what, I won’t even write this one up. No one will have to know.”
Sherlock’s hands came up to rest lightly on his, still knotted in the lapels of jacket.
“I was half out of my mind. Without you. He was right about that.”
“Well, they gave me a biro and a steno pad and had me copy fair about a thousand articles from Wikipedia. For four
“Very little. He counted nearly eighty applicants, all with some brand of red hair, all primped for their interviews. He said most were turned away out of hand with barely a look. Jabez made it to the first room and met with one William Morris, Solicitor, apparently the executor of a rich man’s will. If Mr. Morris is to be believed, Mr. E. Hopkins cherished his fellow red-headed brethren so that his dying wish was to bring assistance to that exclusive club in the form of life-long stipends to any man who already had or wished to have a large brood of red-haired children.”

hone your skills,” John agreed mildly.
“You did agree to the wig,” Sherlock reminded.
“Mm. Rory. It means ‘Red King’.”
“It’s likely that they’re holding the women on the premises at some point during transit. That would explain why they’re so particular about you staying put in the rooms.”
After Lestrade dropped them off, sparing a sympathetic glance for
"How many men should we expect, d'you think? Jones could call in additional police support."
“If they rob my kidneys for the black market, I’ll never let you hear the end of it.”
“Two.
"Isn't it?" Sherlock sounded patently sincere, and John was honest enough to admit that he was enjoying himself on some level. His nerves sparked and his senses were high. Sherlock was a warm presence in the close, blinding dark of the tunnel, and John heard himself saying, "There's nowhere else I'd rather be," and meaning it.
“I won’t have to go back? I do have an

away.”
“So I’ve been told.”
“Ms. Merryweather, I am so glad I could catch you.”
Sherlock let his expression answer John’s question for him and John cleared his throat and flushed again.
The knock at the door was fast and light, but persistent. The bell remained broken because Sherlock had found that Mrs. Hudson was efficient at screening callers in her own way – the more tearful they were, the more tea she gave them, and her sympathetic interest was often the visitor’s true goal: a simple wish to tell their tale of woe. The knocking continued, and Mrs. Hudson being out, Sherlock roused himself to answer it.
“We did say we would remunerate your time.”
“Those gifts being money and influence.”
Sherlock studied John’s kind, rumpled face.
Until he read Mary’s email.
Of course, then they saw the light of Spaulding's torch, and sentiment was forestalled by action.
“On behalf of E. Hopkins, The Ira Howard Foundation wishes to interview red-haired males, sound in body and mind, ages 18-50. Handsome compensation shall be provided to each applicant for purely nominal services. The chosen candidate shall be assigned a yearly sum to be disclosed upon recruitment. Apply in person, Mondays 10 AM to 2 PM, Duncan Ross Building, 4th floor, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."
The boy seemed anxious and the girl sullen, so Sherlock began to close the door.  As he did, the girl jabbed the boy with her elbow.
ambitious.”
“Nothing like it. I’m going to introduce her to some investors. She has a fine eye for design and her stitchwork could make
“Jesus, really?” Merryweather dropped into her desk chair and covered her mouth. “Like stockpiling weapons, that sort of thing? I like to think we’d have found out about this somehow—my lawyers are a pack of bulldogs, the lot of them—but if you hadn’t... You’re saying I might have inadvertently helped finance it?”
“Cloned her in a vat somewhere, did you?” Sherlock said nastily. Perhaps Sarah had been Mark One.
After freeing his hands, John tilted Sherlock’s head back and peered into his eyes.
John found it rather difficult to see Sherlock steering his ragged army into traditional careers, but perhaps he was trying to balance a karmic debt of some kind. Jabez seemed a likely lad – underfed, could use a wash, but he was sharp and reliable.
“Let’s get you home, shall we? You’re free to complain as long as you like on the way.”
, why didn’t you warn me? I don’t want them—“
“Notoriety,” Sherlock responded dismissively. “I’ve been in the papers far too recently, but you, your face is quite…” There was an unusual pause and Sherlock seemed unable to settle on a proper term. “Forgettable,” he pronounced at last. “Average coloring, average build, a pleasant bloke you’d have a pint with and think nothing of.”
“A closer translation would be ‘everything unknown appears magnificent’.”
“John isn’t in. You might try him at the surgery, but he’s likely on his way back.” For a moment, he considered suggesting that they wait. The girl didn’t look pregnant, and her friend was Catholic and a virgin besides, so an STD panic seemed improbable at least. But whatever it was seemed likely to be tedious.
John left the room to wash his face and came back for his jacket.
Sherlock gave him a suspicious frown. “You’re trying to appeal to my vanity. Why?”
“If you think he’d be amenable to a silver tea service or an engraved plaque, I should like to hear your suggestions.”
As reported, the Fleet street offices were thronged with gingers. A spotty fellow in his late twenties, his hair every bit as red as John’s wig, was dismissing the sandies and the strawberry blonds outright. When he spied John, he crossed the room grinning. “That’s the thing,” he said, approaching to clap John’s shoulder and shake his hand. “You go to the head of the line. Morris will see you. Tell him Spaulding’s sent you.” He checked his watch and waved his hands at the rest of the crowd. “It’s on two now, so please come back next Monday, if you’ve a mind to.”
. Do you know who the other one is?”
"I told her that she'd thrown an elegant punch at precisely the right time, and she said that you have the devil's aim for a doctor."
His life had taken so many jogs to the left since his association with Sherlock Holmes that it was a wonder he hadn’t yet run right off the edge of the world.
"And it may be that they'll enter from this end," noted Jones wearily. John figured him to be pushing sixty, and not very well-suited for an all-night stake out, if the swollen joints in his fingers and his unhealthy skin tone said anything at all.
And that explained that.
John answered and stood staring, with all the shock and gladness Sherlock could have wanted from that moment shining all around his face.
“I rather feel I owe him a debt. He has done his level best to keep you from your own excesses, and as he is a proud man, I cannot make my thanks known to him with traditional gifts.”
“I’m supposed to show up, do my duty and then uh.  Hang about and see if I can ring the bell again.  I am scheduled between 10 and 2 every day of the week, for the foreseeable future.”
“Dr. Watson’s loyalty is naturally not in question.”
“The chief sommelier was once accused of serving a perfectly serviceable Beaujolais Nouveau from a doctored bottle that had been presented as a 1978 Montrachet... Perhaps you’re right. Consider it done.”
Mycroft sent a car upon Sherlock's request, and they settled in for a two hour ride to a seaside town outside of Brighton proper. Ringing off his call with Lestrade, Sherlock plugged his phone in to charge, and John asked, "So Vincent Spaulding is really this John Clay fellow?"
“Twelve hours a day in a sweatshop since childhood
Feeling self-indulgently maudlin, Sherlock wondered if this was to be his last adventure with John.  Assuming they weren't entombed for all eternity in a poorly constructed tunnel, it was unlikely Mary's patience would be elastic enough to allow Sherlock the unlimited access to John he had enjoyed prior to his "death"...
job.”
“At the mo it’s only me and Morris, on behalf of the Howard Foundation. I’m sure he’d be amenable to another partner. Are children a particular concern of yours, Mr. Holmes?” She dimpled at him suddenly, her round, brown little face alight with good humor. “I imagine that with all your dodging about you don’t have much time for a family of your own.”
“Yeah, well, extenuating circumstances and all that.”
The room was humid and close; his black shirt clung uncomfortably under his arms, and was liberally covered in pale lint that reeked of the feverish gleam of new cars and showroom floors. Sherlock lifted his chin to eye the spaces where the walls joined into a slumping cavern of decay and inhaled the must and the soupy heat of a damp, enclosed space with high, broad, filmy windows. There was a roaring in his ears, but aside from the rush of his own blood, he could discern no other sounds. Closing his eyes, he tried to train his admittedly limited hearing outside the building, but whatever they’d given him made his lips numb—his scalp seemed oddly tender, too—and his hearing was… compromised, apparently.
“I know. I know why you did it. And I know you didn’t really have time to second guess yourself. And at least you didn’t stay away long. Jesus, imagine it. If you’d stayed—
An undersized 16-year-old girl in jeans and a hoodie, Pakistani parentage, probably born in Romford, accompanied by a boy of 19 or 20, Italian, immigrated in his early teens, tall, heavily bearded, gay—
"It would seem so. Plastic surgery. Even new fingerprints. But DNA is DNA, and those maps matched his to that of John Clay, wanted for three racially motivated murders in the late 90s."
“Oh, Morris. He and I are raising the money to build an orphanage in Brighton. Of course, they’re not called ‘orphanages’ these days, and in general, institutions are brutal places for children, particularly infants. They need eye contact, you see, physical contact, stimulation! Places like that are always overburdened and underfunded, and the children in them are prone to developmental delays. This home will have a very nearly one-to-one caregiver ratio, and lovely grounds for them to romp in. It’s quite near the seaside. Clean air and sunlight.”
“I assure you, John. The Foundation has no interest whatsoever in your
“I have my suspicions. I’ve no doubt you’ll have deduced it all by the time we’re at Baker Street.”
Pressing his lips together, Sherlock focused his glare on Mycroft’s right eye, with some idle hope of fusing the retina with the sheer invisible heat of the hatred raging in his heart.
"Hm. In the morning, you might put a call in to your good Dr. Morstan. We will have a coach here to take them back to Ms. Merryweather's estate in Ashridge, and I imagine that her expertise will be in some demand."
“I spoke with Mycroft when I saw the advertisement. It may be connected to a small matter he’s has been asking me to look into. When Jabez returned with his intelligence, such as it was, I knew I’d need an inside man.”
Strangely, Sherlock had little doubt he would. The thought made him tired.
John felt himself go scarlet and fixed Sherlock with a glare. Sherlock’s answering curly grin was positively Grinch-like in its smug satisfaction.
John muttered his own right back and then pressed Sherlock down on his bed.
“It seems likely.” They must have yanked at his hair when they’d retrieved the bag; it showed a generous concern for his ability to breathe, if none of John’s regard for his tender scalp.
It’s horrific.”
"This is much nicer than a cozy night at home with a girl," John teased. He tried to imagine Mary beside him, and found that he couldn't.
John’s relief had been plain. Sherlock’s inexplicable spike of anxiety had been...
“For. ‘Purely nominal services’. Jesus. For £300 a go. Are you serious?”
,” John snapped. “There wasn’t time, Sherlock. I stowed it under my shirt before they came in.”
“You’re still wearing the wig,” Sherlock pointed out, as John knelt to nick through the ties with his pocket-knife. From his vantage point, Sherlock could see the extraordinary red of the hair as it disappeared into the nearly invisible weave of the skull cap.
“No, John. Perhaps it would be best if. You kept us apart, some little while longer. After all, I’m hardly a real person at all to her – only stories you’ve told her, overlain with the tat the papers spread. Let us settle this case, and at the end of it, I will treat you both to a meal at Noma and I can meet her properly.” On neutral ground, Sherlock decided.
Sherlock said nothing.
, will genuinely like her.”
Peering into the tunnel's maw with a torch that seemed far from equal to the task, John could hear Sherlock quizzing Anjuli Patel about stability and load-bearing structures. She sounded dubious, and John's own time in Afghanistan had taught him that sand was notoriously dodgy under the best circumstances.
“So—she’s not dead, either?”
“Come to bed, will you, I’m getting a crick in my neck.”
“It was one of those awful, manky crushed velveteen rentals, and I was going to a party for my friend Bill’s kids and it was all mothy and the beard kept sticking to my mouth and the knees were shiny and smelled faintly of wee and I stopped to buy a present for my sister on the way, and when you’re at a big bloody shopping center and you’re six and you can’t find a bobby, you will run roaring to Father Christmas, and you will cling to his leg blubbering because your bloody sister, who’s supposed to be watching you, has probably flitted right off to snog a boy and your mum is working 12 hour shifts at a factory and you are
"I agree that he's not exactly sprightly, but I would remind you that he is the only one of us technically qualified to make an arrest, should it come to that."
After a moment, John sniffed and stood up, rubbing his sleeve across his face.
“All right, I’m ginger. Care to tell me why?”
“I can.”
For some reason, an image of Sherlock first come back home and stark in the doorway at Baker Street sprang to mind. Face gaunt and pale against his great black coat, his eyes somehow bleak and starving in his head. He looked like he scarcely knew what to do with himself upon seeing John open the door, which was funny, because John had very nearly pushed him down the stairs pounding the man’s shoulder trying to convince himself that Sherlock was actually alive and on the landing.
“We haven’t yet collected enough evidence to arrest anyone, which is why I’d like your help.  Could you arrange for a tour of the grounds to be made?”
Giving the license a skeptical glance—his hair had been tinted in the photo, naturally—John sighed.
“That’s kind of nice. Does it mean anything to you? Could it be code, do you think?”
“So much intermarriage has, naturally, diluted lines,” Morris added, blinking behind his outsized glasses. Although Morris was gray as a goat himself, John realized that at some point he must have been as red as Spaulding.
Sherlock hurriedly returned his eyes to his slide and John stamped out the door.
“She does exquisite work,” Sherlock allowed, peering closely at the wallet he’d nicked from John’s hip. “There is the small matter of my kidnap.”
“Yes.”

“Of course, but why?  The building hasn’t even begun yet!”
Sherlock peered closely at the papers, frowning.
John heaved a breath, whether it was rage or shock, Sherlock was surprisingly unable to discern.
For a moment, John’s chest had hurt like someone had lodged a fish hook the size of a carving knife in his ribs and given the line a good yank—and then he’d collected himself and dragged Sherlock in for tea.
Clearly, she was trying to remember where she’d seen him before. Sherlock had been off-hand about why John was needed as the “inside man”, but Sherlock had not been wrong about his own memorability; he would need to employ some genuine disguise for his next interaction with a suspect.
“So there is a whiff of actual science to their casting, after all - in humans most hair types are the result of mixed melanogenesis, where different levels of both types of pigment are produced. The highest levels of pheomelanins in humans are present in Caucasian so-called “fiery” red heads... and an uncommon ‘mosaic’ form of melanosome which exhibits features of both eumelanosomes and pheomelanosomes.
redhead, didn’t get in, what makes you think I will?”
Sherlock had Patel take a circuit of the site, and some measurements just within the tunnel, and the two of them conferred for some time.
Sherlock appealed to a very willing Ms. Merryweather for shelter for the eight beleaguered, and hugely pregnant, women; six were from the Ukraine and two had been brought from the Czech Republic. He spoke enough to translate their immediate needs to Jones, and explained to them that John was a doctor, asking them to allow him a brief examination in order to treat any injuries they might have incurred during their captivity.
“I don’t. I don’t understand. He’s hired her away?” John cocked his head, mouth open slightly in a faint, incredulous smirk. “Does Mycroft have particular
“So, this is merely from the goodness of your heart.”
“Whether you consent to any future service for your country or no, my offer to John stands.”
“It was a distinct possibility. These people have an unhealthy interest in eugenics, and any number of unsavory practices.” Sherlock’s lip curled. “My brother informs me that The Howard Foundation is a suspected clearing house for a particular kind of human trafficking. It looks like they’re branching out into some brand of breeding program as well.”
“Your little Tabitha and her friend Paolo. He drives a van. Carpet delivery and installation. A clever way to smuggle a body. Is he in on the trafficking, then? Yes, obviously,” he decided. “But under duress.”
“It was, at that. I hadn’t actually thought much about that. At the. Um. Time.”
“Mary,” Sherlock said slowly, and then had gone very still.
“Oh, very. It would mean a great deal to us if you could follow through, so to speak.”

“I think it means that one of the organizers went to public school,” Sherlock rejoined rather acidly.
John looked at him sharply.

"Can't we stop it
"It would seem they targeted women who were already pregnant. I suppose it saved eight months of room and board."
“One of your homeless network?”
“Sherlock.  Why, exactly?”
weep.”
owe you a favor?”
Eventually, Sherlock folded himself into the mouth of the tunnel, and John settled beside him; Patel had been sent home, and John had convinced Jones to wait for them in the car, parked well out of sight. The evening was overcast, and they turned their torches off. The weather had become unseasonably cool, and the breeze off the water made it colder still. The sand was damp against his trousers, and he brushed Sherlock's elbow with his arm.
sister, after all.”
glad you’re back,” John muttered, jamming his foot into his loafer.
It was probably the kindest thing anyone had said about Mycroft in twenty years.
Sherlock did so, and the woman smiled widely, showing a generous gap in her front teeth. She reached to squeeze John's hand and said something in Czech.
Sherlock found it very satisfying to text John at just about the time he would have arrived at Mary's flat, and John replied with pleasing alacrity.
“Eccentric maybe, but hardly illegal.”
“I know some people who’ve been looking for a project along this line,” he said at last. “With a decent stake to start and a good business manager—I imagine Paolo will be looking for new work, and he read for accounting at least two years before he dropped out—she could have a smart shop on Saville Row booked out with bespoke work a good year in advance, I should think.”
Sherlock bent his head over the reports and did not reply.

“Why–
“I was drugged, I assume. Some new variant of Clonazepam. And kidnapping is generally ill thought of by policemen, last I knew.”
“Describe the room to me. Oh, and I’ll need your shoes. Just the one will do.” Rolling his eyes, John toed off one shoe and handed it to Sherlock, who prodded the sole with tweezers and prepared a new slide as John detailed his visit.
John blinked at them, feeling a bit coshed.
“Not as such. He provided you with an opportunity. He said he’d had two candidates in mind and that he decided on Mary.”

Sherlock looked annoyed. John counted it as victory enough, saluted with his wig and headed for the loo to don it properly.

Although he wasn’t quite smiling, John’s eyes were soft when he said, “That’s really. Overwhelmingly kind of you, Sherlock. I don’t suppose I could suggest a local establishment instead? I mean, I can hardly introduce you as a ‘real person’ when the first thing you do is fly her off to another nation for a bite and sup. Mycroft is forever building up The Fat Duck. Doesn’t anyone
“Yes, but. I didn’t know anything about Moriarty, the bloody ‘Napoleon of crime’, or kidnapping, or faked deaths or arranged fucking
He supposed that he spent a good portion of that first, halting conversation simply staring at Sherlock, still wrapped in his coat and folded up on the sofa. Sherlock seemed just as unable to look away, and so for long stretches, the two of them would simply leave off speaking and kind of peer at the other.
particularly relevant to his situation, but grounding, nonetheless.
His hand started to shake; he curled it into a fist, attempting to quell the panic.
Sherlock quirked a brow. “Not bored now, are you?” he asked smugly.
He didn’t. John felt both disappointment and relief.
“Everyone you know who’s raised children
“Give me one good reason why I should tell you that.” Icy fury laced Mycroft’s tone. John didn’t blame him for being angry, not one bit. He replied with the only answer he could, the only honest thing he could say that might go even a little way toward thawing Mycroft’s rage.
Several heads swiveled around to fix Sherlock with glares. Sherlock dipped his head in apology. He reached for John’s hand and led him to their seats in the front row.
Their knees pressed  against each other at the breakfast table. Sherlock shoved toast into his mouth as he scanned the newspaper headlines. This morning he wore his wine-red dressing gown over an AC/DC t-shirt and pyjama bottoms. The pyjamas were worn so thin that John could feel Sherlock’s knobby knees quite distinctly against his own. John swallowed hard.
What else had changed? Sherlock was almost dreading arriving at Baker Street, for fear of what he might see.
Sherlock grinned at him. "Of course. I'll let you know when anything interesting comes in. By the way, it's almost midnight. Shall we finish the last of the champagne and make a toast?"
“Thank you, Mister…?”
“Do you think it was murder?”
Only one way to find out, though. He was done with being a coward.
“Maybe for a few hours, but not for an entire weekend. She’ll have you climbing the walls in no time. And what if Greg calls you for a case?”
to engaged. If there’s one lesson I’ve learned during my lifetime, it’s that nothing stays the same.”
“Have you talked to him, Sherlock? I mean, since the restaurant…”
First, he contacted everyone of importance in John's life, bar Mary, and verified that they were all free on the appropriate day. He stressed that it was to be a surprise, and swore everyone to secrecy on pain of death.
There was only one thing for it. All was fair in love and war, and this was
He shuffled over to the coffee pot, berating himself for letting John talk him into a late night movie marathon. He grabbed the tallest mug available from the cupboard, and poured himself some wake-up juice, eyes half-way closed. It was a minor miracle that he didn’t overfill his mug and burn himself in the process, but the luck of the only consulting detective was with him. Turning, his eyes flew all the way open when he saw what was waiting for him on the kitchen table.
“God forbid.”
“No need, Mr - Sherlock. I appreciate the gesture, but steps were taken long ago to assure my place in society. I have made my peace with it.”
No, John didn’t have the heart.

“What my pet’s name was growing up?”
His self of a year ago would have been appalled. Sherlock Holmes did
He stared out the window at the scenery passing by in a blur and wondered, not for the first time, if this was a very bad idea. Rolling green hills and sparkling blue waters rushed by in a steady stream of beauty, but he saw none of it. His mind was on his destination, hundreds of miles and another country away. There were dozens of ways this could go horribly wrong; he was sure he had already lived through most of them in his head. But he had never been a coward --
“How many second chances do you think you deserve, Dr Watson?”
"Nah. I've actually been too terrified of either losing it, or damaging it while at work or on a case with you."
(Sherlock may have spent several hours sampling dozens of wedding cakes under the guise of being a potential groom, and had deduced -- with a 99.5% chance of being correct -- what flavour was John's favourite. That it was to be incorporated into a birthday cake instead of a wedding cake was of no consequence.)
Sherlock grinned. “Unfortunately for you, yes. Fortunately for me, because I get to have an armful of eye candy by my side the entire time.” He winked.
Mike Stamford had been waiting for this day for what felt like an eternity. The only thing that had taken longer was his own search for a soulmate, to whom he was currently happily married.
“Oh?” Mary perked up.
Sherlock threw a fond glance Rosie’s way, then backed out and shut the door with a soft click.
John stifled a yawn. Fatigue rapidly descended. He rubbed his eyes. “I think I’m for bed.” He flipped onto his stomach and looked down on Sherlock’s curly head. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, his breaths slow and even. He couldn’t say later what possessed him to do it, but John gave in to the overwhelming urge, and reached out to ruffle said curls. Before he could register a reaction, John hopped up and walked briskly to the stairs. “Night,” he threw over his shoulder, hoping Sherlock wouldn’t call him out.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “I imagined you using it to write up our cases, before transferring the final versions to your blog. Unless you wanted to use it for your
Mary smiled as she eagerly unwrapped her gift.
Marjorie blinked, her mask still firmly in place.  “Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective? The one who lives on Baker Street in London?”
Sherlock blinked at her. "What?"
“I can’t… I’m sorry, Sherlock. I realise from my history you were expecting a different kind of reaction, but -- I don’t do casual sex. Not anymore. Not since… well. Since before Mary, to be honest. Kissing and touching is one thing, but  -- unless the sex
So. Try as I might, I couldn’t limit this one to 221 words without sacrificing the little story I wanted to tell. It’s still less than 300 words, with a final b-word ;)
“Mycroft?”
No, John’s worst nightmare would be never getting a chance to tell Sherlock how much he regretted letting things end between them the way they had -- leaving too many things left unsaid until it was too late. He had done that once before, and so much time had been wasted as a result. Too many windows of opportunity had already passed them by, and he refused to let another slip away.
The typical first words, ones like ‘Dada’, ‘Mama’, ‘No’, or ‘Bye’, were of course too mundane for the likes of John Watson’s daughter. At least, according to Sherlock. Nor would it be as low-brow as a curse word, overheard from her sweary father.
And off they went, in pursuit of a killer.
“Yes, well -- he knows where to find me.”
John made a face. "Tried to. Mrs Hudson helped. Hopefully it tastes better than it looks."
And, if he were honest, frightening.
There was a silence lasting three beats. “Presents? A tree? Who are you, and what have you done with Sherlock Holmes? Do you have fairy lights and tinsel as well?”
John batted his eyelashes coquettishly. “I’ve already given myself away, darling, to my one and only.”

“What shall we play tomorrow? Er.. later today?”
“My brother gave us tickets. Oh, pardon me; this is my partner, Doctor John Watson.”
“God, yes. Let’s not make it a habit.”
"You can't tell Mary either, it's a surprise for both," he warned.
“I see.” John pulled himself a beer out of the fridge, popped it open, and took two large swallows. He walked back into the sitting room, letting loose a loud burp as he did so. Sherlock grimaced at his antics.

Polite, restrained applause greeted her as she took her seat. After laying her hands on the keys, she glanced up and pinned her audience with a penetrating gaze. Her wide blue eyes shimmered with some nameless emotion before they dropped to her hands and her focus narrowed onto her performance, and her performance alone.
Sherlock huffed, mirroring John’s smile. “Yes, John.”
Another possibility insidiously whispered inside his head, but he willfully shut it down and ignored it. One trauma at a time was enough to deal with.
Up until now, perhaps subconsciously, he had been pulling his punches.
John smiled at the memory. “She surprised me because she pulled it on me the day
“Cerberus,” Sherlock announced, then frowned. What?
Why had he allowed himself to become so fond of her, that they had created a friendship all their own?

"Probably not much. Best to be prepared though. Every holiday, including Valentine's Day, sees an uptick in crime. If John could remain free that day, in case - "
Sherlock blinked. “Yes.”
His eyes flicked over the sitting room. Everything looked familiar, and yet somehow not quite the same as he remembered. The yellow smiley-face was on the wall, but the bullet holes were slightly off. The decor was essentially the same, with evidence of a small child scattered here and there. Books and toys lay scattered hither and yon. Some pictures that he didn’t recognise now graced the mantel, so Sherlock took tentative steps forward to get a closer look.
John snorted. “Yes. My very human,
John tugged on Sherlock’s hair, rather harder than he meant to. Sherlock looked down at him, eyes narrowed and an aggrieved expression on his face. His lips were swollen, and the colour was high on his cheeks.
John took another step. “It’s not obvious to me.”
“Was a concert held here last night?” Sherlock interrupted brusquely. “A solo piano performance, given by a young lady at 8 pm?”
The smaller the crowd, the better. Ergo, you and Mary will be the only guests.”
Sherlock continued on into the kitchen. “Perhaps it’s time for a James Bond break,” he called out above the sounds of tea preparation. “Which one are we on now?”
“Won’t it be your first Valentine’s Day together? I’m given to understand that it’s a milestone of some kind, for relationships.”
“Ms Holmes,” Sherlock said smoothly, extending his hand. Marjorie tracked him from head to toe, her eyes sharp and assessing. She placed her delicate hand on Sherlock’s, the tips of her long fingers touching his palm and her wrist raised daintily.
“I’m not… I’m not some bodice-ripped heroine to be married off to… to be married off!”
Casting his mind back, Sherlock found that his last coherent memory involved flossing his teeth before climbing into bed after a tiresome evening spent feinting with Mycroft over several matters beneath his attention. John was at his new position for The Howard Foundation (and what, precisely, had that position
that is?”
, I see.”
Hmm.  Flame retardant, industrial, used in car upholstery and carpeting.
“That
“Had you.” Sherlock found that he needed to clear his throat before he could continue. “Had you considered going with her?”
"As horrible as it is, I suppose it could have been worse." John offered an ice pack to a young woman with the start of a very black eye. "You were great, by the way," he told her. "Sherlock, can you tell her I'm impressed?"
“Did you know that they’d be asking me to wank into a cup?”
It hadn’t been the dental floss, after all.  The rain-damp banknote, of course – not rain at all, but painted with clear, scentless liquid, absorbed through the skin.
“Oh, shut it.”
“Pupils seem to be reacting normally. Did they hit you?” He ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and prodded gently at the back of his neck. Sherlock's skin was damp with sweat, but John had never been squeamish. "Well, no blood, no contusions that I can see. Did they just tuck a bag over your head and stow you in a boot, then?”
"We don't know where the tunnel begins. We only know it leads under the orphanage," Sherlock responded.
"It's not really necessary, but she may be useful if the tunnel under the orphanage begins to collapse."
full of underserved and exploited women a living wage and proper working conditions!”
“Don’t be absurd, John. You’re my secret weapon. Anyone who’s never met you would think you quite harmless, and we both know
“I know
Sherlock approved. John was waiting for a signal, and Sherlock wriggled his fingers to disguise his relief.
“Jesus. Just.
, of all people, John elbowed Sherlock amiably and finally remembered to pry the wig from his head.
“Yep, I’m due back tomorrow at 10. For. Um. A deposit.” John blinked a moment. “Hang on, you don’t think they had cameras in that other room, do you?”
After a moment’s gritting of the teeth at the unexpected sting of Sherlock’s assessment, John took the wig with a sigh. His hair was long enough now that he’d need to mash it down beneath one of those nasty little caps before he could tuck this monstrosity over his head.
“I have come into some money, just recently, and I have some business there. Surely you’ve reached the minibreak stage of your relationship? A man with a rather fine little hotel there owes me a favor.”
“Her work performance has been suffering of late. A little get away at a judicious time could salvage her career, to say nothing of improving her overall health.”
“Hardly. But some highly visible people do owe me favors. People whose patronage could make a new designer.”
Morris, an older, owl-eyed gent, did see him, and seemed just as pleased to make his acquaintance as Spaulding.
John’s throat had colored quite probably down to his shoulders, and he shrugged a little and muttered, “Write it up in a book for mums to flip through? Who the hell knows.”
it goes into the tunnel?" John asked.
“Well, shit,” Merryweather said, clearly dismayed. It was unusual to hear a woman in her sixties with pearls round her neck say such a thing, but Sherlock plowed on.
“Naturally,” John said faintly.
“We had a visitor this morning.  A young person in my employ--”
Narrowing his eyes, Sherlock bit down on a reflexive retort and studied his brother. After a moment, he blinked.
In the end, it was easiest to just knock on the door. Mycroft had given him a new key, but after almost eight months gone, it seemed… presumptive, to merely stride in as if he’d only just run to the market for mounting pins.
Three weeks later, John tramped up the steps after a friendly lunch with Mike, who, like Greg, had been appropriately baffled and sympathetic after the whole sorry mess with Mary. To be fair, John hadn’t had much time to pine for her with Sherlock home again, and Greg happy to release any number of cases, hot and cold, to a man whose return had not only resulted in lavish and celebratory press coverage but a knighthood. As he hung up his jacket, he saw that Sherlock was paying a surprising amount of attention to some kind of fashion week program.
If there were cameras, and Sherlock supposed there could be, they would be trained upon a man in a simple, sturdy dining chair, each wrist secured to each chair-arm with three zip ties tight enough to press into the flesh just under his shirt-cuffs, but not designed to cut off circulation. He could flex his fingers easily, but the ties were secure. With a tensile strength of 8 kg a piece and no leverage to speak of, he was effectively shackled, even with sweat-slick skin and sufficient motivation to pull free. His legs had not been bound, and that was something.
“I fear that your orphanage has a very shaky Foundation.”
“You’re
Abruptly, John dropped into his chair and gasped out a laugh.
“Aside from an oddly specific, and I’d say eminently justifiable, brand of ginger racism and some knock-off designer handbags they weren’t even trying to pass off as genuine, I confess, I don’t really see the crime of the century here.”
“I was undercover! I didn’t want to tip my hand, so I just… lay back and thought of England. But I wouldn’t have if you’d told me they were going to try and, I don’t know, invent a race of ginger sex-slaves!”
“I have a theory.”
“It’s gene sequencing,” John said, leaning over Sherlock’s shoulder to stamp a finger on the page. “They’re mapping them, Sherlock, for best
“This is—my
“You'll lose your billet.”
“Quite,” John said dryly. “Care to tell me
“I’ll. I’ll uh. Need some time.”
“He. He set me up, you mean. Set me up with Mary.”
“It is more likely that he arranged a contact of his to offer her a job that would suit her abilities and ambitions.” When John continued to look puzzled, Sherlock continued. “Much as he did when he brought her to Barts.”
“All right,” Sherlock replied, his lungs too full, his hands too empty, suddenly incredibly
“Right then. I suppose I’ll just take my gingery wanking self off then, shall I? One shoe or no?”
“Your eminent employability and natural charm. That and your really very excellent wig. I think you’ll fit their profile exactly.” He glanced at his watch. “If you leave now, you should just make the cut-off.” He vaulted out of his chair and tugged his suit jacket on. “I have business of my own to conduct.”
“Plenty of time, you berk. It’s not even 10 yet. We’ll eat - or at least I will - and then we can go.”
A sister that he didn’t remember? Had Mummy or Daddy hidden away a secret love child who had only recently come to light? Or were all of his memories false ones? Was he still in a coma?
“All right, keep your secrets then.”
Their mostly one-sided conversation on the way home was animated.
Sherlock inclined his head. “Thank you for speaking with us, Marjorie. I look forward to attending more of your performances during what I am confident will be a glittering career.”
I will always worry about him, constantly. He is, after all, my little brother.
At least he knew that he still lived at Baker Street, and that John and Rosie lived there as well. In what capacity exactly… well. He would find that out soon enough, when John arrived in an hour to take him home. After spending another three days in hospital after regaining consciousness, Sherlock was more than ready to see the backside of his room, private though it was. He didn’t want to see another doctor besides John Watson for a very long time to come.
Sherlock and John looked over at each other, communicating without words. Just like they used to.
“Deduction!”
“Yes. Right on time. Got your gun?”
“Good evening, gentlemen,” the greeter said as he collected their tickets at the door. “You two are the last to arrive, so the performance will begin shortly. Gerard will take your coats, and then if you will just follow me.”
“It’s only the fourth day, John. We’ve got ten to go.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked over John, head to toe. He nodded to himself. He carefully set his instrument in its case and set it aside. As he walked past John’s chair on the way to the kitchen, he pressed his hand on his flatmate’s shoulder and gave a gentle squeeze. “Tea, or beer?” he asked.
"John."
John stood up, groceries retrieved. “Just good to see you, is all. Good to know you’re still the same old Sherlock - that some things never change.”
Have you taken leave of your senses?”
But...
Sherlock considered. Would they have also married on the anniversary of their first meeting? Seemed a bit...well, trite. And clichéd. Not like them at all.
This one is -- a little different, I guess? Takes place during ASiB, right after Sherlock's visit to the morgue on Christmas Eve. Pre-Sherlock/John.
He’d know that voice anywhere.
John shrugged. He stepped into the room. “Wasn’t sure how you felt about it.” The child started bouncing up and down in his arms, straining forward as she repeated, “Papa! Shelrock!”
“Yes.”
Sherlock and John both stood facing the camera, happiness radiating from every pore. Dressed in matching morning suits, boutonnieres and top hats… and matching grins. Here was a John that Sherlock recognised, at least in appearance. Hair cut short, more gold than silver, a boyish expression on his face. Stockier. Younger.
Finally, at 6:04 pm, John snapped. He threw down his paperback and barked, “Bored!” in a truly unsettling imitation of his flatmate. He jumped to his feet and started pacing, rubbing his hands through his hair and creating a hedgehog like appearance.
“It *is* the next day”
There was a brief pause in activity from the kitchen. “Intriguing title.”
Eyes still closed, Sherlock asked, “What happened?”
“He may have changed his mind by now. After having a chance to cool off.”
“There’s my Baker Street boys!” Mary, seemingly out of nowhere, stepped between them, linking their arms with both of hers. “Work everything out?”
The inside joke of the smiley-face ignited a warm glow in Sherlock’s chest, and the clever appropriateness of the skull and crossbones made him grin like a lunatic. Then the actual words hit home, and jolted him like a bucket of ice water.
Sherlock kept a firmly unreadable expression on his face as he held up the placard, glanced at the cake, then locked eyes with John expectantly.
Sherlock was distracted for the next fifteen minutes just savouring the lingering warmth on his shoulder.
he thought but did not say.
“Ready when you are.”
When he and Sherlock became a couple, John had no worries whatsoever about Sherlock embarrassing him in public with terms of endearment. Or even in private, for that matter. And John was A-OK with that. More than.
Sherlock stiffened. He turned, and John’s heart almost broke at the tentative (hopeful?) look on his face.
“That you would show up at Baker Street and find everything just as you left it? I hate to be the one to break it to you, but when you arrive at 221b, you’ll find it empty and abandoned. It’s been so for the past two years.”
And why exactly had he not yet admitted to the extent of his memory loss? Was it more than just the great Sherlock Holmes admitting to a bit of vulnerability? Or was there something more, there? Something that he was trying to avoid?
John stands in the doorway of the bathroom, hands on his hips and giving him what Sherlock has come to call his “disgruntled hedgehog” glare. His wet hair stands up on end, disheveled and spiky. A white towel is wrapped around his waist. Droplets of water bead on his skin as they drip onto the floor, unheeded by the semi-naked man.
“It’s me. John
"Right," John said, giving Sherlock a bemused look. He ripped the paper off his package, and flipped open the box. And was stunned into sober silence.
“I didn’t know, I saw. Just now, by observing you. I had no idea beforehand, John, truly.”
“It’s really too bad that you’re so dressed up and put together. Because I intend on taking you apart, right now.”
“I’ve never played Monopoly all the way to the end before, until someone actually won.”
Sherlock smiled. He could imagine the warring looks of both confusion and delight battling for prominence on John's face when he got to the Diogenes, only to be herded unceremoniously into a waiting black sedan and whisked to an unknown location. He had a feeling Mary would be enjoying it as well. Oh yes. He knew what John liked. He knew what both of them liked.
If Sherlock was master at anything, it was the cloak-and-dagger routine.
“Why is our table set with different colours than everyone else?”
Sherlock’s eye was then drawn to a framed picture sitting on top of the chest of drawers. He slowly walked towards it, cocking his head. The white plastic frame contained a photo of John holding a swaddled infant, and at his side was a petite blonde woman whose smile was as wide as John’s. The birth mother? Unusual, if Sherlock and John had adopted Rosie. Perhaps a surrogate? That made more sense, given that Sherlock had deduced Rosie was John’s biological child. But if that were the case, why was Sherlock not included in the picture?
The last thing Sherlock expected was to be wheeled out to a fiery red Aston Martin, and told to get in already, you daft bastard. What he was expecting was a black London cab. And since when did John drive? Last Sherlock knew, he didn’t even have a valid license. Which was why Sherlock had been the one to drive during the Baskerville case. Well, apparently John could not only drive, but the way he deftly maneuvered around traffic and street corners spoke to a bit of experience in that regard. And whose car was it, exactly? Sherlock couldn’t picture himself *ever* owning a vehicle, let alone one so flashy. That was more John’s style.
Sherlock adjusted his safety goggles. “There will be food, alcoholic beverages, presents, and a Christmas tree. What else is needed for a party?”
Anniversary. Anniversary? Which anniversary? Adoption? First date? First kiss? Wedding?
John plopped down in his chair. “I assume I’ll have to abandon this charming persona for the evening, and dress up in jacket and tie?”
It was lovely and heartbreaking all at the same time.
“So where is he now?”
Well. Wasn’t this interesting. Immovable object, meet irresistible force. This one might actually take some effort getting rid of. He was up to the challenge, though. He hadn’t just gone through two years of hell only to lose the chance he swore he wouldn’t waste upon returning.
gift with one that had all the trappings of a grand romantic gesture. A ring! And not just any ring, but an heirloom. If there were a truer way to stake one's claim, Sherlock wasn't aware of it.
“Sherlock, for god’s sake, could you stop that racket? Maybe work on your experiment or something?”
Ah. Sherlock had forgotten, and now John’s hot water has turned frigid in the middle of his shower. Unfortunate. He would have enjoyed pulling that towel off of John Watson’s hips and joining him. However, a cold shower does not sound in the least inviting.
“Tickets to a debut performance of a young pianist by the name of Marjorie Holmes, apparently. No relation. They’re for next Saturday evening, 8 o’clock. Private showing, no less. Limited audience.”
Sherlock wasn’t about to shake John loose, not when his closeness did something funny to his chest and stomach. Something not altogether unpleasant. He was glad for the help once they got to the stairs. Sherlock got dizzy about halfway up and had to stop for a moment before continuing on. John’s steady presence remained by his side all the way into the flat.
“Maybe not, but you’ll get all of the glances from me. And I’m the only one that counts.”
“I believe we’ve made a good start,” Sherlock replied, smiling down at her.
“You won’t get any argument from me, Sherlock. I think it’s simply horrendous. Not to mention unattractive.”
“Feels nice, actually. Thanks.” He wiggled his toes, smiling at Sherlock’s reaction. “Don’t have to stop. I like it.”
Interestingly, every other attendant was dressed in mid-nineteenth century garb, as if they were attending a themed fancy dress party. Sherlock and John exchanged a glance before giving each other the once-over. They were both dressed in basic black trousers and jacket, black bow-tie, and white shirt. They shrugged, hoping their attire was generic enough to fit in. They hadn’t been stopped at the door, so that was a good indication that all was well.
John shrugged. “I dunno. Maybe your brother just played an elaborate practical joke on us? Although that doesn’t really seem his style, does it?”
The connection abruptly cut off.  John frowned at his phone, confused. Mycroft had indicated that he was going to tell John where Sherlock was now. After all his bluster and fuss, had he changed his mind?
"Where's Watson?" Sherlock frowned.
something, as in moving towards a committed romantic relationship, then… I’m sorry. “
“John. I deduced that you had developed a romantic attraction to me within two months of our meeting. I knew that you would never act on it, so I never brought it up. During my time… away, I realised that what I felt for you was something more than friendship. I planned on pursuing you in a romantic fashion once I came back, assuming you were still attracted to me. Well, you know what happened after that. Therefore I decided to ignore my feelings, and it worked for a long time….until a few months ago, when I started noticing signs once again of your interest. I realised that, if you haven’t made a move in all these years, that you were very unlikely to do so unless I gave you a nudge. This quarantine seemed the perfect opportunity. Once you had a taste of what physical intimacy with me could be like, I was convinced that you would abandon your reservations and *finally* let yourself have what you wanted.
John swatted Sherlock's shoulder. "Berk. The best birthday party ever, I might add." His expression sobered. He lowered his voice, even though there was nobody else around.
Mike had been watching those two idiots dance around each other from the moment they first met. Gut instinct never steered him wrong, and his faith never wavered. Not when Sherlock jumped from Barts rooftop and everyone presumed he was dead for two years. Not when Watson got married to the wrong person, twice. Not even when John packed Rosie up and moved to the coast, kicking off an almost decade-long estrangement.
The first blush of spring painted the countryside, and John found himself distracted by the view. He almost missed his turn, a sharp veer to the right onto an unpaved road. Cursing, he hit the brakes at the same time he jerked the steering wheel around. The car swerved, tires squealing as it struggled to retain traction on softer ground. John came to a stop, trying to get his breathing under control when he heard an exasperated “Idiot!” call out. He glanced in his rearview mirror and was startled to see a man standing in his car’s wake, giving him a death glare. He held a sack of groceries cradled in one arm, while another lay on its side at his feet.
John sighed happily, reclining in his chair with his feet up and his nose in a book. He couldn’t speak for his flatmate, but as for himself, he was quite happy to “self-isolate”. He and Sherlock had run themselves ragged during the previous two weeks, hunting down a smuggling ring. Fourteen days with nothing to do and nowhere to go sounded, quite frankly, like heaven.
“You didn’t. Your life started when you met me.”
“Ah. Family pressures?”
“I don’t think, I know! Imagine if I could solve the mystery of my own ancestor’s death! Well, not
“It may have been at one time; now it’s rented out to the general public for pretty much any event that you can imagine. Weddings, wakes, graduations, weekend business retreats, concerts like this one.”
She had so many uncles, it was almost embarrassing. Uncle Mycroft, Uncle Greg, Uncle Bill, Uncle Mike, just to name a few. She had almost as many aunts: Aunt Harry, Aunt Molly, Aunt Janine, Aunties Sally and Stella (those two came as a unit these days).
“Look.” John stared at his cake, avoiding eye contact. “You know this sort of stuff is difficult for me. Always has been and I haven’t got any better in my old age.” He huffed out a nervous laugh.
John swallowed. "Does this mean…"
John had never seen him so entranced as when he held his own child for the first time. Not even when presented with a locked-room mystery.
“Ah. I see. So case solved, then?”
Sherlock closed his eyes, then opened them to reveal steadiness and determination.
“Well, let’s ask these gentlemen then, shall we?”
The Harvest moon hung large and bright in the evening sky, seemingly at rest on top of the nearby weeping willow. The light fog that had been present since dinnertime lent a dampness to the crisp night air, the mist swirling around their legs and parting before them as they made their way to the well-lit entrance.
John hesitated for a moment. He looked down and cleared his throat. Then he nodded, as if coming to a decision. He tapped the notebook with his finger. He waved a hand at their surroundings. “Trying to remind me of our history together. The cases. Our first case. You don’t have to keep apologizing, Sherlock. I’ve forgiven you.”
John looked ridiculously pleased at that.
“I can’t see that the room’s been boobytrapped, and they didn’t bother to gag me, so they must have called and let you know where to find me.”
Mycroft did not smile.
,” John breathed at last, thumping him on the shoulder. “You beautiful, gorgeous, utter
“It’s the corresponding gene for red hair.” He narrowed his eyes at John. “It’s unlikely you’re a carrier, and they’ll know you’re a fake. We’ll have another day, at least, before they get your results.”
“Perhaps. As one brother to another. One who knows the inherent difficulty in dealing with a self-destructive sibling.”
Desolate, Sherlock could only watch John pace the floor, arms swinging but rigidly controlled. Visible restraint, a refutation of his impulse to violence.
“Sherlock. So you’ve just… invented a new designer and provided cracking motivation for people who
Head injury? Possible, but not likely. His vision was fine, but he had no memory of being brought here. In fact, he had no idea how he’d been drugged. Perhaps he’d fainted from low blood sugar and been happened upon by some random citizen with an unmarked van and a bit of warehouse space.
Sherlock held out a wig. From a distance it looked like half a skinned cat, but up close John could see the quality: it was genuine human hair, un-dyed, red as a Donegal sunset and fine work, but he automatically shook his head.
idea.”
By the time they’d reached the street, he had deduced his captor.
"So. We wait," John sighed.
"An architect?"
“Dr. Watson?” The boy’s hair was mashed flat from the rain, but he wore a slicker, and driving gloves.
“Touché, brother. Originally, I had two candidates in mind, but in the end I went with her. Her name is Mary Morstan. Blonde, as you no doubt know, a year younger than he. Not overly tall, extremely competent, steady, and kind. She even has a history of service. Three years with Doctors Without Borders as a gynecologist very interested in obstetrics and women’s health concerns. An
“They did,” Lestrade agreed, holstering his gun.
I recognized her. She’s barely any taller. I promised I’d bring her a pony if she’d stop crying,” John admitted.
“I did, yes, and I am happy to meet you. Although I suspect I won’t be when you tell me why you’re really here.”
"In this type of tunnel, stand-up time -- how long the ground will safely stand by itself at the point of excavation -- is paramount. Because stand-up time is generally short when tunneling through soft ground, cave-ins are a constant threat. It looks like they've at least attempted to set up shields," Patel said, using the light of her torch to indicate a steel cylinder pushed into the sand. "It carves a perfectly round hole and supports the surrounding area while workers remove the dirt.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like they've got anything like the number of shields they'd need to really prevent a cave-in, and they haven't done anything to install a permanent lining."
know they’d kidnap me?”
Something inside John unfurled like a new fern, and he suddenly felt bone-meltingly relieved. He combed one hand through Sherlock’s hair and curled the other around the side of his neck and bent to kiss him. Really kiss him, soft drag of skin, wet slip of tongue, warm warm warm jesus sherlock—
The tunnel in Brighton had been dug at least in part with a backhoe that was still on the premises, wrapped in a vast flapping blue tarp. The site itself was littered with lumber and girders, but the only section of the building that had been completed was a vast finished basement. Directly beneath it was the tunnel itself.
Sherlock handed John the envelope and unfolded the day’s paper with unnecessary pomp and began to read.
“We need more data before I can draw reasonable conclusions, John.” He peered closely at the tread of John’s shoe. “Sand. Yes, definitely Brighton.” He held out the shoe and squinted at John’s wig a moment. “You really don’t have to keep that on, you know.”
“Did you, what, find a missing shoe for Donatella Versace or something?”
“Would the tea service be a wedding present? She does seem fond of silver. I haven’t actually seen her yet, but he met her while I was… away, and I thought I could see your hand in it.”
Although he considered himself quite worldly, somehow he’d never actually gotten off in a strange room by himself before. In his home, yes, of course, and when he’d lived by himself, his own settee had done very well for a toss, thanks, and hotels and basically any shower with a shred of privacy since his twelfth birthday, but as far as actual furnished rooms without beds or another person to make it interesting… Never.
“Well, where you and I have never particularly discussed John until now, he and I have had a number of confabs about
Mary was freckled, now that he thought of it. Along the lines of her shoulders, the bridge of her nose, under her light makeup. All that time in the sun, the two of them very used to the dappled light of a medical tent.

of criminal intent. But for what purpose I could hardly determine without reconnaissance, and so I selected Jabez for the task.  He’s red as carrots.”
Sherlock texted asking John to meet him at Barts.
The report was full of hand drawn pedigrees and printouts from a lab showing streams letters and numbers.
“High praise indeed.”
“You did ask me to,” Sherlock observed softly.
"Well, a case of lead poisoning couldn’t have happened to a more deserving fellow," he told her.

“A bit sensational, but accurate enough. If I may ask, what did you think they were going to do with your… sample?”
“For the record, I do know you’d do anything for me. After all, you came back from the dead.”
“Yes. That’s. Lovely. Flattery will get you everywhere, Sherlock.”
Sherlock crept out of his chair and wrapped his arms around John with uncertain caution, tucking John under his chin and then holding very still. John’s hair was tickling his nose, unimaginably soft, smelling of the same bar soap he used in the shower – what use did a man without noticeable vanity have for a posh shampoo? Johns arms were locked warmly around his back, squeezing him close. He smelled of salt and sweat and marvelous impossibly intricate simplicity, and Sherlock felt him heave a few gusty breaths against his shoulder before making some awkward gulping sounds and releasing Sherlock with a firm and final pat.
"That remains to be seen, but all signs point to it. Lestrade has been so good as to contact the local police on our behalf; we'll be meeting a D.I. Jones. And an architect called Patel."
In the ensuing quiet, there was little for Sherlock to do but fiddle with his phone and surreptitiously watch John sleep, slumped against the window with his jacket balled up against his cheek. Sherlock had had surprisingly few opportunities to study John in repose. Unlike Sherlock, he wasn't given to napping in the sitting room. But then, perhaps that was due to Sherlock rather monopolizing the sofa.
“You proceeded, did you?” Sherlock raised one eyebrow in amusement, and John’s ears reddened obligingly.
, Sherlock wondered?). Mycroft had promised Sherlock that he would offer one Harriet Watson a three month stay in a rather well thought of Swedish clinic should John merely say the word. An interesting proposition, and one that Mycroft had assured him had no strings attached.

“What did he suss out, then?”
,” he’d beamed, hardly able to make his words known, he was breathing so hard, grinning so wide. “All right, then?”
“John? It’s really you?”
“This is true. However - wait. Mary didn’t have an advanced degree.”
In contrast, John had been living with Mary for three months. They were already established when Sherlock had unexpectedly burst back into John’s life, with all the finesse of a bull in a china shop. In fact, Sherlock suspected John had been getting ready to propose. A bit soon, Sherlock thought, but what little he knew about romantic relationships could fit on a post-it note.
“That’s not quite true, is it? You haven’t tried to contact my brother yet. Why is that?”
John grinned, and that act alone took years off his face.

"It's too bad that I'll have to give the ring back. Wouldn't be right to keep it, being Mary's family heirloom and all. It really is quite a lovely ring, and a perfect fit. Right shame."
"Like I said, John. Nothing else really needs to be said."
Sherlock had the sense to put on a guilty face. "Mmmm... not so much, it turns out."
"You...know about Irene?"
The light at the end of a very long tunnel had just become brighter. Sherlock Holmes was on the case.
As his observations clicked into the right slots in his brain, panic bloomed in Sherlock’s chest. “Wait!” He tightened his grip on John’s hand. He licked his lips. “How… how long…?”
Even Mrs Turner’s married ones, David and Patrick, had edged their way into the inner circle. Rosie had them wrapped around her little finger, even more so when she started calling them her cousins. Where she got that from, remained a mystery for years to come.
would cross her lips, and that was almost all right. Almost.
“First time for everything, I suppose.”
The applause died down, and everyone else melted towards the exit. Sherlock, on the other hand, strode purposefully towards the debutante. Shaken from his trance, John padded after him.
Sherlock smiled in spite of himself, and was pleased to see John mirror it back. “Knew you’d appreciate a visit from your number one fan. Hush, Rosie! I told you Sherlock was sick, remember? He can’t hold you right now, but maybe tomorrow. Can you tell him what you saw on the way here?”
John jingled the keys in his pocket and laughed. “You have no idea what the date is today, do you?”
“My brother doesn’t have a sense of humour.”
John cleared his throat, casting for something appropriate to say in response. “A lot
John blinked. Sherlock slowly turned his head and locked eyes with him.
John cleared his throat. “No. ‘course not, why would there be?”
Sherlock shrugged. “If you like. Finding out what works, through trial and error. If it doesn’t relax you, then we can stop doing it.”
Sherlock huffed. “Fine. You and your insipid need to
John shook himself. He barked out a nervous laugh. “Really, Sherlock? A ghost? The woman we watched perform last night was a
"I can as well."
John detested pet names with every fibre of his being. Whenever any of his girfriends used one, he inwardly cringed whilst trying not to outwardly react. It was difficult at times, though. Sarah never did call him anything other than his name, thank goodness. Jeannette, on the other hand, insisted on calling him every endearment in the book, it seemed. Thank mercy for small favours, Mary had very rarely done so; the occasional
“John?”
The large circular driveway that Sherlock pulled their rental car into contained only five other vehicles.
Sherlock did.
“None. And maybe he’ll refuse to even see me. But I need to at least try.”
“All right?”
John glanced around as he and Sherlock exited their vehicle. He barked out a laugh. “Very atmospheric, this.”

Easy peasy. Maybe.
He didn’t know how much time had passed, but the next thing he knew he was flat on his back with an armful of Sherlock Holmes, who was lying on top of him and kissing him with the sweetest, most lingering, most erotic kiss that John had ever received in his life. He found his hands tangled in Sherlock’s hair and giving small tugs every so often, resulting in delicious sounds issuing from his flatmate. Sherlock’s hand wandered underneath John’s jumper and tweaked his nipples, causing John to arch and almost tumble off the sofa.
"I like the skull and crossbones. Very creative."
Five minutes later the two flatmates were sitting on opposite ends of the sofa, their respective beverages in hand. Two hours later, their shoulders were touching as they slouched down with their legs spread out on the coffee table. Sherlock nudged John’s left foot with his right. John pressed his elbow lightly into Sherlock’s side. They cracked a smile at each other, before devolving into snickers at the ridiculousness on-screen.
“Shh!” Sherlock hissed, as quietly but firmly as he could. Normally he’d be joining John in his amusement, but between the circumstances they found themselves in and Sherlock’s inconvenient arousal, he was wound too tightly to let down his guard even for a second.
He should have known this fact about his partner, after watching him with Rosie for going on six years now. John should have realised it back when Sherlock and Archie used to hang out together, kindred spirits who still believed in wonder and adventure. That’s what John loved the most about him, that he made people - not just children - believe that the world really did contain magic of a sort. You just had to
What was surprising was that, more often than not, Sherlock was the one who initiated. He seemed to sense whenever John was hovering on the edge, ready to either start climbing the walls or clawing his eyes out. It didn’t always involve kissing, either. During one memorable episode, Sherlock stopped his study of whatever was under his microscope and wordlessly  guided John to the couch. He sat them both down, then wrapped John in a firm hug. John was shocked for a few seconds, then melted into the embrace with a sigh of relief. They sat like that for five minutes without speaking; just softly breathing into each other’s necks. Every so often Sherlock rubbed a hand down John’s back. Afterwards, Sherlock got up without a word and resumed his experiment like nothing had happened.
Mary pursed her lips. She shrugged. "Of course. I'll make sure any plans we happen to make aren't until later the next day, just in case."
Sherlock grabbed his fork and dug in, relief coursing through him as he focussed solely on his food. Too much sentiment at one time tended to shut him down. Plus he needed to think, without any outside distractions.
“John. We’ve only got two more days before this ends, do let us make the most of it, yes?”
John sighed. “Well, the only other explanation I can think of is that Mycroft is somehow aware of this part of your collective history, and there must be a reason that he brought it to your attention. Although he could have been more straightforward about it, if you ask me. Then again, he does so love to be dramatic.”
John folded his arms across his chest, mouth set in a grim line.
Time to pull out all the stops.
“Apologies.”
“Then I’ll freeze them.”
"Beyond even what Mary did?"
Sherlock glared at him. “Childish. If you don’t settle down, you’ll give ourselves away!”
Sherlock barked out a laugh. John responded with a high-pitched giggle.
in? So… he had moved out at some point? When? Why?
Sherlock came back to himself, only to be lost in the fathomless depths of John's blue eyes. He touched his swollen lips. "How long were we..."
“Wait. Sherlock. Are you sure we can’t just… pretend the last few days never happened? Blank slate, post-quarantine. Just carry on like before. No expectations, like we agreed. Yeah?” John’s heart thudded in his chest as he waited for a reply.
Sherlock blinked. He shook his head in order to clear it.
Sherlock broke eye contact, looking at something beyond John’s left shoulder. “You might be surprised. It’s been a long time, John. The last time we were separated it was only for two years. Yet when I came back I found you had gone from
“Magnificent!” Sherlock shouted as he clapped along with everyone else. He was on his feet, as was John and the entire audience. For such a small crowd, the noise was almost deafening.
“Of course. Can’t very well play violin in your current state, can you? Although I do wonder if
“Of course,” Sherlock said, tone bland. “I suppose it’s served its purpose.  Like I said, only two more days. We should be able to survive until then.” He graced John with that fake smile that John had come to hate over the years. “As for me, I’ve still got some cold cases that Grant gave me a few weeks ago. Shouldn’t take me long to get through them.” He bounced up off the sofa and clapped his hands. “So. Best get cracking.”
John pinched the bridge of his nose. He took a deep breath. “Sherlock. There’s no way the two of us are going to be able to eat *ten cakes*. Most will grow stale.”
“Dull. I thought we agreed you would manage the bills?”
“Bee! Bumblebee, Shelrock!”

“Okay. But anything you’re uncomfortable with, stop me.”
I haven't been feeling well, so I am two days behind. I hope this suits.
“Molly, eh? How’s that going?”
“A.. flashback?”
“Actually, it’s the exact opposite. We’re getting married, mate! He proposed last Friday. Thought I was gonna have to do it myself for awhile there; we’ve been together for almost three years now.”
John blushed and ducked his head. “Sure,” he mumbled, taking a hurried sip of his coffee.
John beamed. "Why thank you. Means a lot coming from you. Now then; shall we have a taste?"
“Ha ha, very funny.”
"Well then. You won't really miss it, will you?"
“Sherlock, my name is…you know what? Doesn’t matter. What’s the question?”
Sherlock tugged on John’s hand, dragging him towards the house’s entrance. They were met by a young man with a wide smile.
The evening flowed effortlessly, all three of them gradually becoming pleasantly sloshed. John and Mary introduced Sherlock to the Rizla Game, which Sherlock thought was fucking hilarious, actually. He had never giggled so much in his entire life, up to this point. What was the point, again? Of this party? Oh, right. To show John how much Sherlock loved him. And that Mary couldn’t possibly love him as much as Sherlock did. Nobody could. It was impossible.
He tightened his grip and forced himself away from self-chastisement. He’d been doing enough of that for far too long. He was at his core a man of action. Now that he had set off on this path, he needed to stay the course until the bitter end. After all, what was the worst that could happen? Sherlock had already indicated that he was willing at least to see John, which meant he would more than likely give John the opportunity to say his piece. The worst-case scenario would be that, afterwards, Sherlock would show him the door and tell him he never wanted to see or speak to him again. The end result would be the status quo, after all.
“Steady,” John warned, none too steady himself as he reached out. Sherlock slapped his hands away.
“Penny for your thoughts.”
“Sorry,” John whispered. “You have to admit, though; hiding behind a skip, with me stuck between you and a concrete wall, gives new meaning to the phrase ‘between a rock and a hard place’”. John pressed his fist to his mouth to contain the laughter threatening to burst forth.
“So John, what’s so urgent that you needed an emergency pub night? Sherlock driving you round the bend again?”
John winked at him. "Nice coincidence that, yeah?"
Sherlock’s eyebrows shot up into his hair. He lowered his eyes, gaze locking on the spilled grocery bag. “I -- thank you,” he mumbled to his feet.
John rolled his eyes. “I am a doctor, for god’s sake.”
But this? John sitting across from him, smiling and holding his hand? Whatever events had led up to such a thing being possible, he would be forever grateful and count his blessings. It was enough.
“Nope. Nothing of the sort. Were you trying to locate something in particular?”
John gave him a reassuring smile. “Just three days. Not so long, considering. Still, shaved ten years off my life, feels like.”
“What could you possibly need to talk to her about?”
Nothing happened the day Sherlock made his offer, other than a few shoulder clasps throughout the day. The next morning, John screwed up his courage. He came into the kitchen and walked straight up to Sherlock, who was facing the kettle with his back turned.
“Yep,” the voice cheerfully replied, albeit with a bit of a wobble. “Good to have you back. You had us all worried.”
The shock of that name being spoken aloud, after so many years of neither speaking nor hearing it, sent the equivalent of an electric shock through John’s body. All the air was sucked out of his lungs. His left hand tightened around the phone and his right fist clenched on his knee. Hyper-awareness of his surroundings flooded in, from the rocking of the carriage to the clacking of the wheels on the tracks.
“Is this adequate for Rosie’s school Christmas party?”
So. Mary had managed to upstage his incredibly thoughtful,
Sherlock shook himself out of his trance, and realised he wasn’t making good use of this opportunity. He crept up the stairs to Rosie's room, careful to keep his steps light. He opened the door and snuck in, taking in the room at a glance. A beige sofa-bed, currently in sofa mode, was pushed up against the far wall, bracketed by an end table and a chest of drawers. Rosie’s cot was situated at the opposite wall, with the child in question currently snuggled under a Winnie-the-Pooh duvet, sound asleep. A wooden rocking chair with a green cushion, a changing table, and a chest that Sherlock presumed contained Rosie’s toys completed the scene.
“Only if you want to.”
“Jesus… steady on, Sherlock.” John set his mug down next to the sink and placed a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “God, you’re tense. Having a flashback?”
As Sherlock's speech progressed, John's expression grew more and more starry-eyed. He and Mary kept sharing knowing looks, John’s tending toward the apologetic. After the speech ended but before dessert rolled out, Mary placed a hand on John’s arm and leaned in close for what appeared to be a brief heart-to-heart. John nodded once, a resigned smile playing at his lips.
A spark of sadness animated her face for a split second before an expressionless mask slipped into place.
"So. What happens next?"
John’s mouth fell open at the sight of the stately three-storey manor. Several bronze lighting fixtures attached to the front, reminiscent of Victorian era gas lamps, revealed gorgeous green ivy sprawling over the stone surface, interspersed with some kind of vibrant, violet-coloured flower.
He then made reservations at the restaurant right next door for a birthday dinner. That was a stroke of genius, Sherlock thought; if everyone was already inebriated, they could just saunter a few feet over instead of having to drive somewhere else. It was just sheer luck that he also knew the head pastry chef there, and could order a specialty cake in John's preferred flavour - strawberry - for a hefty discount.
“There you are! Let me notify the doctor. I’ll be right back.”
A feeling of dread settled in the pit of John’s gut. An unwanted fear niggled its way into his mind.
“I appreciate it, though. This is lovely. No other place I’d rather be. And I mean that sincerely.” John smiled at him, eyes soft and warm. With perhaps just a hint of… sadness?
John chewed on his lip, brow furrowed. “No. No, not really.” He smiled brightly. “Just two blokes on holiday, looking for some entertainment. Sorry to bother you. Thank you for your time.” He grabbed Sherlock’s arm and steered him back towards their car.
“I know my own failings intimately, Mycroft,” he spluttered. “And that’s not what…”
Mycroft’s voice carried on smoothly over his own, as if he’d never spoken.  “Even after you were gone, my brother kept the lines of communication open so that you would always have a way to come back, if you so chose. If you
"Neither." Sherlock then led the both of them into the kitchen, where a festive offering greeted them: intricately prepared cucumber sandwiches; a variety of cheese, crackers, and pâté; a spread of cured meats; and still in the oven, roasted Cornish hens. John’s favourite beer waited in the fridge, and the best champagne the British Government had to offer sat in an ice bucket on the clean -

need to eat. And yours as well.”
“A no longer practicing one, but I concede it. And a most excellent one at that.”
John interjected, addressing the worker. “So you’re saying there was nothing scheduled here for last night? There was no -- exhibition, no gathering of any kind.”
When the child produced from Sherlock’s sperm and Harry’s egg was born, John was as besotted as he had been with Rosie. This was Sherlock's child. And a Watson, through the miracle of modern medicine. John would be forever grateful to his sister for this gift.
John let out a familiar long-suffering sigh before huffing, “Friday. It’s Friday.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened as his free hand flew to his mouth, as if to stuff the words he had let loose in the frenzy of his deductions back behind his lips. He looked at John with a stricken expression.
John stopped and looked down at Sherlock. “Not Cluedo.”
Sherlock swallowed. He glanced down at John’s hand on his knee. The gold band that was still there sparkled in the sunlight coming through the car window.
“Go on, then,” John urged. “I know you’re dying to. Impress me.”
John gasped. "Mary!" He gingerly lifted up a ring that looked to be made of highly polished wood… a simple, unadorned band that nonetheless reflected exquisite craftsmanship.
John gaped.
“Problem?”
But her favoritest person in the world (her wording, and one Sherlock never had the heart to correct) was one who no longer had any blood relatives left living, and had never had any children of her own. So when Rosie bestowed her title upon her, there wasn’t a dry eye left in the flat.
"In case you need him? Of course." Mary cocked her head, considering him. Her blue eyes scanned his face. "You weren't concerned about Christmas, though. Or New Year's."
John looked up from his writings when the breadsticks and wine arrived. Now that he got a proper look at the rest of the room, his eyes narrowed.

Even though Sherlock evidently knew what he was doing, John was *not* going to take advantage. He wasn’t. He had done enough of that back in his youth, garnering him the nickname ‘Three Continents Watson’. It was not a label he held with pride.
“Well…”
“Oh *hell*. I hate this quarantine! Fine, I’ll use Mrs Hudson’s treadmill. I need to … get rid of some excess energy.”
John apparently had a lot more pent up energy to release than he thought. An hour later, it was all gone. He dragged himself up the stairs, kicked off his shoes, and collapsed on the sofa. He threw an arm over his face and regretted his life choices -- namely, overdoing the treadmill. He had a stitch in his side, and his feet hurt.
omen, mind you. I won’t get a second glance from anybody.”
“Yeah, he mentioned! I saw him today at the morgue while I was visiting Molly.”
Well. This was corroborating evidence for a theory of his, at any rate.
“If the trade-off is John, I’m more than amenable. I’m downright eager.”
John nodded. “Okay. Let’s go, then.”
Then the books came out. As soon as John finished one story, Rosie demanded another. And another. And --
“I couldn’t wait to find out what could have tempted the great detective to move so far away from the metropolis of crime.”
John could get used to this. He almost didn’t want quarantine to end.
Sherlock ordered elegant invitations that could have passed for wedding invites, and hand-addressed the envelopes himself, mailing them out three weeks before the event. He worried and fretted until all of them RSVP'd, even the reclusive Major Sholto.
The man looked at him in confusion. “Er… no? This is a private residence that will only temporarily be open - “

After a period that could have been only minutes, or could have lasted several hours, the spotlight faded until all that could be seen was inky blackness. Stunned silence filled the room, until abruptly the overhead lights pierced the darkness.
“Oh, you know. The usual. Suspect clocked you with a two-by-four, you went down like a ton of bricks, I tackled him and trussed him up, called an ambulance, contacted Scotland Yard -- all in a day’s work.”
As soon as Angelo’s was able to re-open, Sherlock immediately made a reservation. He wore his purple shirt, John’s favourite. John wore his blue and white striped jumper, Sherlock’s favourite. They sat at their preferred table - by the window, where they spied on the cabbie that very first night. This time they both had full plates of food and full glasses of wine. The conversation flowed easily, just as it always had. But this time, their feet were entangled under the table. Occasionally one would lean over and give the other a peck on the cheek. Their eyes shone with not just fondness, but with love.
Swept along with the crowd’s enthusiasm, and further encouraged by Sherlock’s reaction, John boomed “Bravo! Amazing performance!” For a man who had never been much affected by music, his spirit soared this night. He could only imagine what Sherlock, a virtuoso in his own right, was experiencing.
“Sherlock?”
“Umph? Heritage House? What makes you think she’ll still be there?”
John smiled. He reached up and cupped Sherlock’s face, stroking those attractive cheekbones with his thumb. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered shut, and his head dipped.
To John’s amazement, Sherlock seemed to be coping *much* better than he himself was. Sherlock spent the better part of the morning researching something online, making interested ‘hmm’ noises every so often. The early afternoon was spent in the kitchen working on whatever experiment he had going on since before all of this. The rest of the afternoon he sat cross-legged on the floor, organizing one of his crime scrapbooks -- scrapbooks! -- humming contentedly the entire time.
Sherlock shrugged. He still hadn’t made eye contact with John. “It’s up to you. Whatever you want.”
When  the cake appeared, candles blazing and voices rising in disharmonious song, Sherlock excused himself. He slipped out the back entrance, fighting unexpected vertigo and fluttering butterflies in his stomach. His hands shook as he pulled out a cigarette, his first in several months. It must be the adrenaline wearing off. He might not be coming down from a chase and fight with a suspect, but he had just been through the emotional equivalent. Mycroft would be appalled.
