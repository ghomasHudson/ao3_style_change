Sherlock went back into the bedroom and brought out their daughter, to smiles all around. He handed her to Anthea, who was reaching out, and settled her with a cloth in case of explosive belches. She immediately held Sheri close and began talking softly to her. After about fifteen minutes, Mycroft took his niece and smiled as he looked at Anthea - oh, yes! Sherlock was right - they
John shook his head and said to Mycroft,after tossing a blanket over his husband. “That's for the best. He was awake most of the night, last night. He has to be exhausted. He's been so excited and looking so forward to this day. I really can't thank you enough, Mycroft. You've made your little brother happier than I have ever seen him. And I can echo that for myself- we are beyond thrilled.”
The next day, John and Sherlock took a hike around the moor, noting the lack of “hound” stories and sightings. The moor was still wildly beautiful, although as Henry Knight said, quite bleak. They were happy to spy some of the moor ponies and took photos of them.
That settled, they next turned to the smaller-sized cots for their bedroom and during the day at first. Both agreed they would need this, as running up and down the steps all day would be counter-productive to getting anything else done. They recalled that Molly used one when Emily was very small, and felt it was an essential piece of equipment and could be easily folded and taken with them if they visited Sherlock's parents. They also chose this in a neutral, light finish. They thought they might need another changing table for their bedroom, and marked one they liked, with a woodland animal print.
"Is this one of your brother's little side projects, hmm? What does he want from us for the access to this new ability?" he asked.
"I am happy. I'm just a little - no, a lot - shocked, that's all. This could be brilliant, love - just think - a baby - or more than one, who would really be ours! And not by reason that one of us would be the biological father, but that both of us - I can't quite believe this is real...okay, I know I am babbling here, but it all seems a bit like a science fiction novel," John let go of Sherlock and sat down on the couch. Sherlock promptly sat beside him and grabbed his hand, looking intently at his beloved.
John and Sherlock admonished Angelo to keep all this under his hat until they knew officially that the time had come, and he agreed, still grinning. “Well, at least we know that we won't have to cook every day,” John said, smiling. “And I suppose it will usually be on days you are expected to provide a meal for us, eh, love?” Sherlock tried (and failed spectacularly) to look innocent, and grinned back at his husband, a real smile, which so few ever saw. John thought he would cook every day of their lives if he could bring that smile to Sherlock's face more often (but he'd never tell Sherlock that, the git!) and they finished their pudding and coffee, and left, walking back to Baker Street hand in hand.
They started talking about bottles, but since John and Sherlock were not sure which would be recommended, and Molly was nursing, they saved that part of the discussion for later. Privately, the couple thought that Baskerville might suggest a certain type. Greg and Molly looked at the list of child-proofing that Sherlock had sent to Anthea, and agreed it was comprehensive.
"Yes, well, there may be a way round all that business now!" his sweetheart said, smiling, twisting his hands together in nervousness and excitement, and fidgeting in his seat.
Sherlock also took Sheri on daily walks through Regent's Park with the car seat/ pushchair combination. He showed her the many varieties of plants and flowers, and of course, introduced her to the ducks. At present, she didn't react, but he knew she would love them when she was a little older. He actually enjoyed meeting the other parents out walking with their children, and comparing notes. There were a couple of young mothers he frequently spent time with, having a coffee and chatting about their babies. They thought he was just the most devoted father they had seen, and when they met John on one of his days off, told him just how good Sherlock was with Sheri – John beamed and kissed him right there in the middle of the park - and Sherlock blushed at the compliment - and the kiss in front of his new friends. The pushchair was perfect for these outings, and he was happy to have it - and the formerly derided cup-holder came in very handy!
When they got the call that all was ready, they selected a Tuesday morning and made reservations at the Cross Keys for the night before, as they would be staying at Baskerville for the remaining time until they could take their daughter home. The Tuesday planning was to accommodate Mycroft's schedule, as he wanted to be present, and Sherlock and John could not refuse after he had been so instrumental in facilitating their entry into the study.
Chamomile in hand, Sherlock turned to Anthea. “Do you have what you said you'd bring for us? I'll go and fetch it, if it is in the car.” At her nod, he took the car keys and went to the silver-grey car in the car park - Anthea's personal vehicle, and so different from Mycroft's usual government ones. After rummaging in the boot for a minute, he returned with a large package. Inside were a long piece of cloth and one item that looked like a rucksack to Sherlock's parents. They looked at Sherlock with questions in their eyes, and he grinned.
The whole name should be sufficient for even Mummy to be pleased with it. Sherlock and John had a good chuckle about
She already showed a love of acquiring knowledge, and this thrilled both Sherlock and John. They often sat at night in the lounge, speculating on which career she might choose, just for fun. John had worried at first that Sherlock would become bored with the routine of raising a child, but he had to admit his husband was the better for it. John soon realised that Sherlock's first love was now definitely teaching their daughter and raising her to be a well-rounded, intelligent person who loved to learn.
After the men left, Sherlock went through the lab catalogue Molly had brought him and ordered the things he would need to get the lab set up. He was very pleased to finally have a real lab, and he knew John would love it to be away from their living and eating areas, even if they were not having a baby.
Sherlock, on the other hand, acknowledged that she did look a lot like him, but also saw the hints of John that his husband didn't notice most times. The shade of her eyes was darkening and Sherlock thought they would probably settle more into John's deep cornflower blue than his unearthly verdigris, and he was delighted. So many of her expressions were like John, as well - when she was happy, her smile - for she
Then they got to the clothing section. Just looking at all the tiny clothes made them both excited and a bit afraid - they could not imagine caring for a baby so small. Even John, who cared for many babies on his clinic days, thought about being solely responsible for such a tiny being twenty-four hours a day, and couldn't suppress a slight shiver. They did exclaim a bit over a few of the little outfits, and they knew then and there the child would have more clothing than even Sherlock, whose clothing collection looked like the stock of an entire small, bespoke-tailoring shop. If they had known what sex the baby would be, they would both have picked out at least a dozen outfits. They
Sherlock and John were taken on a tour of the stem cell division and they observed several artificial wombs in the process of gestating an animal, and in one case, a human baby. They were both fascinated by the process, asked lots of questions, and thanked everyone when the tour was over. They then drove to the Cross Keys, where they had stayed before when they were investigating the hound. Gary and Billy were pleased to see them again, and this time they had a double room with a bath. After being poked and prodded for what seemed like days, both were ready for a shower and then dinner in their room.
“ Yes, but I want to ask Molly and Greg first what things they have found are the most helpful, and why. Since they are in the midst of raising a baby, I'd like their input before we go anywhere. Don't you agree, John? Then, I think the suggestion you made about finding quality things will help us to save a lot of time wading through things that are not made to be durable, and so forth. Mycroft, the help with the lab is much appreciated. I suppose it would help if we got an electrician in and made sure that the wiring is all up to standard. I'd also like to make a listing of the safety regulations, to be sure we are meeting those and get the right things to child-proof the flat,” Sherlock answered. Obviously he had thought about this a lot.
“This one may be more appropriate for wearing for a longer time, or outside if it is chilly weather - although the wrap can keep her quite warm. It's a bit easier to put on and adjust with Sheri in it than the wrap - I thought that John might prefer this one, but we'll see what he thinks,” he said, twirling his husband around once he had fastened all of the straps and buckles. Mrs. Hudson grinned at this, seeing the detective and John dashing out the door, with their daughter in the pack, in her mind's eye. She hoped that DI Lestrade and the gang were ready for Sherlock plus his daughter all at once!
Greg and Molly were very helpful after their initial surprise. They chatted with John and Sherlock about various items they had found invaluable - and a few they had not. They looked at the items Sherlock had bookmarked on the computer, and gave their opinions about each. Molly showed them a slightly different portable cot that was like the one she had at home, and then they looked at some of the other items, Sherlock bookmarking the ones they wouldn't need for a while. When they got to the car seats, Greg was very knowledgeable, as he knew they'd likely be moving it in and out of cabs or rental cars more than a vehicle of their own. He selected three possibilities, and Sherlock sent an email to Anthea to check them out and let them know which was the best rated. Molly then pointed out several car seat covers that made the seat softer and more comfortable, and Sherlock marked those, too, so he would know what to order once they had settled on a seat.
Sherlock went to have a shower and was followed by John in short order. They pointedly did not share the shower, as they had no time to get distracted by other pursuits, no matter how pleasant. Sherlock was at the sink shaving and then fussing with his hair when John got out of the shower and shooed his husband into the bedroom to get dressed. Sherlock decided to be more casual tonight than he was usually - these two were amongst their closest friends, after all. He had ordered from Angelo because he thought that their guests would appreciate a more relaxed meal, on one of their rare nights out, with a sitter for Emily. He also now wore far less formal clothing on most days, unless they were going out on a case. He settled on black skinny jeans with a jumper in a deep teal that John had gifted him last Christmas - it was lovely and soft, and brought out the myriad of colours in his eyes. Under it he wore a shirt in a soft ivory. Some whimsical socks in a teal and rust print (these were Irish setters) and a pair of soft black leather trainers completed his attire. John had succeeded in encouraging his sweetheart to be more casual when formality was not necessary to the situation. He thought that when the baby came, it would be better, as well – even Sherlock knew that dressing in a suit for everyday life with a young child was more than a 'bit not good!' John, as per his usual, wore jeans in a dark wash and a cuddly polo neck jumper in a deep merlot shade, socks in a Scottie-dog pattern, and his usual brown brogues. By the time the bell rang from downstairs, the couple were as ready as they could be, and anxious to break the news to their friends. John buzzed them through and met them at the top of the stairway.
Congratulations! You just let me know, and I will send you dinner or lunch any time, since you may be too busy to cook. I am so happy for you! I think you will be very happy with a little
"All right, love - did you want anything before we go to bed - tea, water, juice? I'm just going to get some juice and take it in with me. No? Well, be there in a tick." John said, busying himself in the kitchen for a minute, getting his glass of juice and carrying it into the bedroom they shared. Sherlock was coming out of the loo, having cleaned his teeth and brushed his hair, something he did every night, saying it just got too messy if he didn't. John thought he rather liked it when Sherlock's curls were all over the place, they made him look even younger and more beautiful (if that were possible) like that. Ah, well...
“ Getting back to OUR situation, lovely – I have to say, you are improving with your cooking by leaps and bounds here.” John said, smiling, while eating his breakfast with enjoyment. He ran his hand through Sherlock's curls, “ Do you think we can ask for curly hair? I really fancy seeing your curls on a little one, I have to say.”
“This is quite a surprise, Mrs. Hudson! We're so glad you are here - so what do you think of your newest tenant?” asked Sherlock, grinning proudly.
"I see you have a list of things there - we can use that, and look at those things while we're there. I know you'll want to have John along when you finally choose the main theme, but going to a few shops this way will give you an idea of what you do and don't like, as well as seeing the types of items you'll need to have ready. It's a godsend that babies take nine months to get here."
John's mind flashed back to the days right after they had first met, when he was always ten steps behind Sherlock's deductions. "Sorry, what?"
a surprise - cheers, Mycroft! All right, then - may we contact you in a few hours? I think we'll want to talk about this privately, but I am sure we will be in agreement that we do wish to do this,” John said. He looked over at Sherlock, who had stopped playing and sat in his chair, staring at the fire, as Mycroft left and went down the stairs and out to the waiting car.
"Sherlock - are you feeling all right now, love? What was it, hmm?" asked John at almost the same instant, his trained eyes searching for any deviations from normal.
started smiling, once or twice - was all John, as was her exasperated face, something that amused Sherlock no end, even when he was causing the exasperation by bathing her or changing the toy she was trying to reach - only with her eyes at this point, but her intent was often clear. Her nose still had John's snubbed tip, and her hair had darkened considerably since she was born, although it was still a deep blonde, and curly like his own. All in all, she was the prefect blend of the two of them, and Sherlock was completely enchanted by their tiny daughter.
John shot Mycroft a grateful look, knowing this would save his spouse much time spent obsessing over the details, while assuring that they were preparing a safe environment.
He helped Sherlock to drink about half the juice, and then set it down. He brushed Sherlock's hair back from his forehead and kissed him, saying, "Love, just remember, we are in this together. I also think that Mycroft's suggestion that your parents help us a bit would be lovely - they're so very excited we are having this baby, and that they will have a grandchild. We can talk more if you want, or if you think we should wait a while longer – I don't want you to feel pressured into this. All right?"
He soon found the section for baby albums and spent some time looking, finally settling on one he liked and checking with John, who agreed. The one they chose had a similar theme of forest animals - they also bookmarked that one to ask Molly about. They knew they needed one that had spaces for all the basic milestones to keep so they had something to show friends and family, but the special data they would need a record of could be kept separately. That would stay in the computer and a file cabinet, since John felt a hard copy was a reasonable backup. Any classified data would only be kept by Baskerville and their approved paediatrician, of course.
“For god's sake, Mycroft! We are not living in an 18th-century novel; 'desirous' and 'peruse,' indeed! Can you possibly sound more insufferable than you already are? You are only feeling 'incandescently happy', as you would term it, because if we have children, Mummy will stop bothering

I've been making better progress than usual, so I thought I'd update today, as a treat. I hope you enjoy it-
By the time they had checked out several baby sites, it was nearly time to get ready for Molly and Greg to have dinner with them, at 221B. Sherlock had called Greg and Molly and changed the site of the dinner. John had called Angelo earlier to order dinner for four, and he was as always happy to provide it for his two favourite clients. They decided on an antipasto platter, garden salad, and spaghetti puttanesca with crusty garlic bread. A couple of bottles of Barbera completed the meal, and Angelo said that he would send over a special dish for pudding. Sherlock hoped that it was tiramisu, since that was one of his favourites - he was such a tart for sweets!
Sherlock Holmes unlocked the door to 221B and fairly flew up the seventeen steps to the flat in Baker Street. He was excited and nearly bursting to tell John his news. This would make John so happy, and give them something they both longed to have in their lives.
Then the moment arrived. The device was opened, and their daughter was lifted up and out, and with no extra coaxing, started screaming lustily on her own. Soon the doctor was asking if either wanted to cut the cord - Sherlock nudged John, who immediately went over and cut it very deftly, and Sheri was taken by one of the nurses over to the warmer for care. Sherlock, John and Mycroft all went over to that side of the room to watch. First, she was dried with a warm towel. Then they checked her Apgar score and were pleased to say it was a nine. John explained that a true ten at one minute was very rare, as most babies were blue “at the edges” for the first few minutes until their limbs were perfused with room air. She weighed in at 3290 gm. (7.6 lbs) and was 55 cm (21.5 in) long. By the five-minute mark, her Apgar was a true ten. Her hair was indeed blonde, looking nearly white right now, and the curls were there - she had a full head of hair - “just like Sherlock when he was born,” per Mycroft. Both John and Sherlock were too overwhelmed to speak much right away - they kept their eyes glued to their little girl. Her bright eyes were, of course, a nondescript newborn grey-blue. Finally, the nurse wrapped Sheri in a pink blanket and held her out to Sherlock, who sat down first and then held out his arms. If there was a stray tear in his eye, no one remarked on it.
“Yes, he must do,” replied John, also grinning. This started a whole new round of both of them giggling until they were holding their sides. Well, much better than Sherlock having another panic attack, thought John. “I just hope that Anthea doesn't have other plans...” which started them off again.
Sherlock tried to look faintly offended, and sniffed. “Names other than Mary or Susan are not necessarily 'unusual', John; just not pedestrian.” He completely failed once he had said this, however, as he then broke into a true grin, followed by his husband and his parents, who all thought it was perfectly 'Sherlock-y', and hilarious.
“Would we be able to get updates on the baby? As in videos, with the pertinent facts about weight, developmental milestones, and the like? I know this is all very hush-hush, but I'd like to know how things are proceeding, and I am sure that Sherlock feels the same,” John said.
As he unfolded it, they could see it was some sort of a sack to hold an infant in. It was black and had a set of straps that adjusted and buckled around the wearer in either the front or on the back. Sherlock also spent some time adjusting this and trying it on John, nodding as he did so.
Sherlock also was thinking about their future son or daughter. He would love either, but he had to admit he was completely smitten with Molly's daughter, Emily. She was adorable and so smart, he was sure she would start talking any time now. He knew Molly and Greg had a friendly wager on whether Emily would say "Mama" or "Dada" first - and he had been secretly coaching Emily - a bit - repeating "Mama" to her frequently. He knew that Molly would be so excited - of course, she would be excited either way, but he wanted "his" pathologist to win the wager. She had been such a good friend to him when he desperately needed her, and she and Greg were very happy together.
“Oh, Sherlock, she's beautiful! She looks so much like you when you were born! Look at all that hair - and the blonde curls!” Mummy said, smiling. “She is just so sweet. You said she has been feeding well, John?”
like a mother to them both - and an extra “grandmother” surely couldn't hurt! They stayed a bit longer, then went upstairs to prepare for some telly and then bed, as they both felt tired despite having a nap on the train.
When John woke up an hour and a half later, Sherlock was still sleeping soundly. John frowned slightly, hoping he wasn't coming down with a headache or something. He looked peaceful enough, and John supposed it was just the lack of sleep for the last week that had finally felled his sweetheart. He went to the loo and then checked on Sheri, who was starting to snuffle a bit. Before she could work up to a full-on crying jag, John scooped her up and changed her nappy, which was soaked. Well, her waterworks were fine, he thought with a smile. He rang for a nurse and told her he needed a bottle for her, and one was soon brought in to him.
Dr. Stapleton was also smiling as she watched the parents-to-be. She was happy she had thought to call Mycroft when they expanded their program to include same-sex parents. She thought it was an extraordinary opportunity, to offer this to couples like Sherlock and John, who were obviously devoted to each other, and wanted children of their own. Sherlock might be a bit quirky, but it was obvious he loved John and did want a family with him. They were also excellent choices to record everything about the child once it was here, and to let her know how things were going with growth and development. Dr. Stapleton and the other lab people were thrilled at the involvement of the parents, and knew they would use many of the suggestions that Sherlock and John had made, to offer other couples the same (such as recordings of their voices, and additional music tracks). After answering a few of the couple's questions, she left them to visit with their daughter for a little while.
"Anniver - oh, damn. I've forgotten an important date, haven't I? I don't recall..." stammered John, wracking his brain for a significant occurrence and coming up with nothing.
John had told Greg that they had found a surrogate through Mycroft, and that the embryo was successfully implanted. Sherlock had stopped by Barts the same day and told Molly the same information. They both said they wanted to see the scan photo when it was taken. Mrs. Hudson was also informed, and was over the moon, and already making plans to knit something tiny when they knew the sex. Sherlock's Mum and Dad were also surprised and happy, and called or emailed every few days to check in. Mummy was over the moon, as predicted, and was already knitting baby items in a neutral tone. She had also helped by choosing some small items to co-ordinate with the new décor, which completed the new look nicely.
Molly also suggested to them that the rugs in the flat be replaced - which they had never thought about. When they looked at them critically, they couldn't see a baby crawling around on the present ones. They were quite worn, both by Sherlock's pacing and by his experiments, so they put new rugs on the list. Both John and Sherlock were sure Mrs. Hudson wouldn't object, since they'd be buying the rugs themselves.
When they left the train at Exeter, they went to the car rental agency to collect their car. Sherlock had organised it beforehand, so they only had to show a card and pick up the keys. Since Sherlock knew the way, he drove. John never got used to the sight of his husband driving - he always thought of Sherlock as riding in the back of a black cab. Since they had a little way to go, John decided to close his eyes a minute or two. He leaned over to put his head on Sherlock's shoulder, and was asleep in a few minutes.
John grinned at his husband, who also beamed at the compliment. He waited for a few minutes and then took Sheri from her Papa (as Sherlock wished to be called), and sat down to further explore their daughter at close range. Photos of both fathers were taken by Uncle Myc, who was also 'persuaded' to hold his niece and have a picture taken. He agreed that Sheri was the most beautiful child ever. After about 45 minutes, the nurse placed Sheri into a hospital cot and wheeled her to the room they would all be staying in for the next two days. Her fathers and uncle trailed dutifully behind.
“He knows the periodic table by heart, and often recites it when he needs to calm down or to wait for a while. He actually knows the song about all the elements, and will probably sing it to you until you know it, too. He can be impatient, but can be remarkably soft and understanding. He's an actual genius, but can be remarkably naïve about some things. He's a brilliant violinist, and will no doubt teach you to play as soon as you can hold the smallest violin they make - I believe it's a tenth size-?
Then John said that they should include some mp3s of lullabies; some from classical pieces and some from more modern songs, so the baby could be soothed by them after its birth. They then spent an hour or so on iTunes, choosing the ones they liked best and buying them to add to the iPod, which Sherlock said would make more sense, as he had an older model they could use. He then added some violin pieces, as he had an extensive collection of those, and some piano and organ as well, Soon he was debating with himself over which symphonies to include...
The ambulance arrived just as Sherlock passed out at the table. Mrs. Hudson climbed into the ambulance with him, calling John and Mycroft in that order and telling them that Sherlock seemed to be having a panic attack, and had passed out. The EMTs did quick vitals, and then had Sherlock, who had regained consciousness, breathe into a paper bag. He still looked awfully pale, even for Sherlock. They got to the A&E and moved the stretcher to an open cubicle inside. By the time the staff came out to seek family or friends, Mycroft and John were striding through the double doors. Mrs. Hudson was directed to a waiting room.
He had settled in the armchair with her and was just starting to rock her and talk to her about her other parent.
Sheri loved to go to Molly and Greg's, as playing with Emily was one of her favourite pastimes. Molly was expecting again, a boy this time, and should deliver in about ten more weeks. She and Greg were completely besotted with each other, and Sherlock and John were happy for them. After this baby came, she would retire from Barts and concentrate on her family. She said she had waited long enough, and now she was ready.
about grandchildren.” asked Sherlock, waving his hands dramatically, clearly ready to jump up from the table. He was fidgeting in his chair, fingers drumming on it loudly. “I don't know why you are so opposed - you and Anthea have clearly been together since last – May, was it? Doesn't she want children when you are married? She seems to agree with you, you've lost weight since you have been together, despite dining out regularly...”
“About two hours, and you needed it, so don't fuss. Our daughter just woke a few minutes ago, and I changed her and now I am giving her a bottle, as you can see. Are you all right, though? No headache?” John asked, slightly concerned about his husband.
“Of course, you are! John, you and Sherlock are going to be champion parents, I just know it! We are so happy for the both of you,” said Father. “Now, what names have you two decided on, so that she will know what to call each of you?”
“Honestly, John, I don't think they've worked out every single gene, do you? Besides, your hair is much nicer, not always going every which way like mine does...” Sherlock started, then realising that John was having him on, just a
John replied, “Well, yes, I think we are. It's a very exciting day for us, isn't it, Sherlock?” but his spouse was already walking towards the door at the far end of the lab, where he had deduced their child was waiting.
At three and a half, Sheri started ballet - and Sherlock was the worst stage father there ever was, driving some of the other parents round the twist with his micro-managing of the ballet school's recitals. But, he also provided snacks and offered to help with scenery and costumes, and whatever else he could, so earned back a few points by his volunteering. He was excellent at sweeping back Sheri's long curls into a bun, and taught the other parents the most efficient way to do it. This alone earned him back any status he had lost with them.
Meanwhile, Sherlock and John received some welcome news in picture form. Their daughter was a blonde, and there were definite signs that some curls were in the process of forming. John was delighted, as he adored Sherlock's hair, and thought that curls on their daughter would be adorable (he really was in danger of over-using that term, but it was the only one that perfectly fitted how he felt when he thought of her). On the other hand, Sherlock was happy that their daughter had John's blonde hair. As for the curls, Sherlock only sighed, knowing the trouble it would be to fix her hair every day if it were as obstreperous as his. He did suppose that all the curls would be easier to manage with a girl and the variety of hairstyles they could choose. He made a mental note to check out You-tube for hair styling videos for babies and little girls, and when he did, was soon entranced by the many intricate ways to braid hair.
“Nothing to apologise for, dear, newborns are quite demanding creatures. You'd never suspect it from their size and cuteness, but they are very adept at getting what they want from you. If your brother hadn't given me a break, I might have gone completely mad the first few weeks after you came along! Your father was so busy at work, there was no such thing as paternity leave back then. Myc was so good with you. I've never believed all his bluster about not caring – what a lot of nonsense!”
women, in Sherlock's case. The notion of binary sexuality was one that Sherlock did not personally subscribe to, believing that for nearly everyone, there was more of a sliding scale of attraction and desire.
when they thought about it. When they rang her up to tell her, she was very vocal with her praise about the names, saying she had expected more of a problem. John just said that he forbade Sherlock from anything too outrageous or in old Anglo-Saxon, or any of a dozen other lists his husband may have drawn from. Violet hummed and said that John certainly knew how to deal with Sherlock, and then asked to speak to her youngest.
much,” Sherlock snapped, then finished as quickly as he could and left - and did not visit a scene again unless there were very unusual circumstances. After that, when he showed up with Sheri, no one said a word except to greet them both and talk with her -
I hope you have been enjoying this- it's been fun to write- please leave a comment if you wish-thanks,
just tell her that they had decided to try for a child, and then that they had found a surrogate - ? That would probably work well.
Mycroft then looked across to his brother, who was now back across the room, playing softly and looking out the window, but he knew that he was listening closely to all that had been said. He addressed his next remarks to his back, trying to be stern.
They started the baby care classes in 221B. Their teacher was called Annabelle, with 20 years' experience in newborn nursery at the local hospital before she branched out into teaching. Annabelle brought a wealth of information as well as a whole range of products that they would soon be using daily. They spent time learning how to make up formula from powder, how to sterilise bottles, how to put a nappy on properly (Sherlock was actually fairly adept at this task, having changed Emily for Molly several times), basic safety concerns, and so much more. They also learned how to bath the baby, how to most easily and safely dress her (some of these baby things had amazingly intricate fastenings), and ways of soothing and comforting her when she inevitably became fussy. By the end of the eight sessions, they felt much more ready to deal with the myriad of new tasks which lay ahead. Annabelle left them with her contact information, and said she would be available for any 'emergency' calls.
development. Molly had also brought the lab equipment catalogue, and Sherlock was very excited to start looking through it – but not until the next day, John admonished his husband.
"Just because I am working part-time at the surgery doesn't mean I won't be around to help with all these decisions and getting the flat ready, and all the rest. Now, love, have you eaten today, or was the interrupted lunch with Mrs. H the only time you were going to eat so far? Yes, I thought so...You may be a bit dehydrated as well," John ended, leaving the cubicle and looking for Sherlock's chart.
“Oh! Of course, I'm sorry, John - I have just been mulling over this email from Dr. Stapleton, and she wanted to know who would provide the cells, and...” Sherlock trailed off, looking like he was slightly afraid he had done something a 'bit not good'.
"One thing, Sherlock, and this is NOT negotiable - NO experimenting on the baby - or babies! Keeping track of milestones and such, I expect, and that is okay, but absolutely no experiments on bodily processes and the like - is that clear to you?" John said sternly as he was able, knowing that he would be repeating this particular rule many, many times in future.
“No, Mycroft, I'll phone them up and see if we can go to lunch there tomorrow, and give them the pictures whilst we're there. I don't suppose the lab knows yet whether it's a girl or a boy?”
“Oh, I wouldn't say that, John – he has been happier since the day you two met, and his happiness has only increased with the changes in your relationship - this is just the latest step. I am very grateful that you ran into Mike Stamford that day,” Mycroft said sincerely, looking fondly over at his brother sleeping. He handed Sheri back to her Daddy.
On the way back to Baker Street, Sherlock suddenly said, “John - what was the name of that baby shop where we liked the clothes? Little – something...?”
“Nope, her temp is normal, and no sign of a cold or nasal congestion. I've tried rocking her and singing to her, she just seems miserable and I can't find any reason so far,” John answered, looking somewhat nonplussed.
After Mycroft left, John placed Sheri on her back in the cot, foot to foot, and then lay down on the bed beside Sherlock, soon dozing off as well. His dreams were filled with babies smiling and cooing.
Sherlock also took Sheri on trips to the museums that were in such abundance in London. He spoke to her about the exhibits as if she were older, reasoning that she would retain these things when she was older if introduced to them as a baby. The other patrons were amused at the young father teaching his daughter about paintings, ancient artefacts, and the like. The zoo, the aquarium, the poison garden at Alnwick (he had arranged a weekend trip for all three of them to Northumberland, and John was greatly amused at the serious way Sherlock explained all the plants to their daughter, telling her the symptoms they each produced and the antidotes for them – were all places to teach her, and Sherlock relished any chance to do that. They also visited the tree-house while they were there - although that was more for John, who said he'd love to build a small one for Sheri when she was older - probably up at his parents' place in Gloucestershire.
In what seemed like only a short time, Sheri was turning one year old. She had recently started walking, after holding on to the coffee table for weeks. One evening as her two fathers sat watching the telly, she suddenly let go and toddled over to John, who beamed and exclaimed - “Sherlock! Are you getting this on video?” as his spouse replied in the affirmative, having pulled out his mobile with amazing quickness. She then delighted them both by turning and going back to her Papa, whilst John took the video of the return trip. They quickly spliced the two together and sent it to everyone. They had been waiting for this for weeks now.
"Whatever made you think you had to do this all on your own, eh, lovely? We have plenty of time. I am sure once we settle on a theme and the kind of furniture we want, that your brother can help - isn't that right, Mycroft? It'll all come together just fine," John said, trying to soothe his husband, who was currently looking as if he wanted to sink through the floor.
After they were settled in the room, Mycroft asked if they wanted to call their parents and give them a first look at their grand-daughter. Sherlock and John immediately agreed - there was no reason to postpone - it just looked like any hospital room, nondescript decorating, the usual equipment in the room. John, who was holding Sheri, insisted that Sherlock take her for the call - “They'll want to see you holding her first, love.”
a – sociopath's - brain. This sort of thing was just not his usual area, so naturally he couldn't stop thinking about it. Sherlock soon felt an unpleasant knot in his stomach, and told himself to calm down. He just wanted John to know he could be trusted to help with all this - he felt dizzy suddenly and took a gulp of tea, and tried unsuccessfully to take a deep breath. Mrs. Hudson was watching him with concern.
“I think that will be the best, also - this way we can be like other parents-to-be. It will be a bonus to find out when we visit the facility again. Good, then, I'll email Dr. Stapleton so she can begin as soon as the cells are completely ready. Then maybe we can work on the list of what we'll need to do to baby-proof the flat - I bookmarked a list of health and safety recommendations. Is that okay to do now, John?”
“She's just beautiful, Sherlock, John - she really looks like you, Sherlock! And the curls! Violet has just been showing me pictures of you as a baby and child. You always did have the loveliest hair, I remember, and now she has the same. Her mouth looks a lot like yours, Sherlock – her upper lip has that same pretty Cupid's bow! Her hands are all you, too with those long fingers - I reckon you'll have her playing violin by the time she can hold it correctly. And oh! - she even has a bit of the same look to her nose as you, John, and the blonde hair - Mycroft did a wonderful job of helping you to find a surrogate and egg donor. It's really remarkable! So sweet!”
All in all, they were off to a fine start with their daughter - John was constantly surprised at how well his sweetheart took to parenting, and complimented him on it frequently.
“Why don't you let me try? She's been crying for nearly half an hour. Not that I know of anything else, but she is getting rather frantic there. You can go back out and I'll just try, here,” Sherlock told John, who was looking rather frazzled, as well. He handed her to Sherlock and went back out to the sitting room. Sherlock re-swaddled Sheri, put her up on his left shoulder and gently rubbed her back in small circles whilst softly singing to her, just a tune, really - one of Saint-Saëns' Carnival of the Animals, the Swan. After only about five minutes, the baby girl settled down and began sucking her thumb, and cuddled into her Papa's shoulder. After he walked the room for a few more minutes, Sherlock chanced sitting in the rocker. Sheri remained calm and was soon getting drowsy, having cried herself out. About ten minutes later, Sherlock stood and lay her in her cot, and after staying a few minutes to be sure she was still asleep, he returned to the group.
been talking about a family already! Good for them, he hoped they wouldn't have any problems - what was he thinking? If there were problems, they could also make use of the Baskerville labs - silly of him not to think of that (there was always
Mummy motioned Sherlock over to sit with his parents on the couch. “Come on over here, dear, there's plenty of room - you don't take up much space! Don't they look happy, the both of them? Oh, boys, I am so happy for all of us, but especially for you, Sherlock. Mycroft told me you had been thinking about this for some time, and he was so happy to help you in finding the surrogate. She did a beautiful thing for you, that's certain. Oh, look! She is searching for more of that milk!”She smiled, watching Sheri, but hugging Sherlock, who appeared to tolerate it better than usual.
Word that they were having a child spread quickly, and soon even members of the Met they had only met occasionally, asked how things were going. It seemed the whole world was waiting for news of their daughter. Mummy and Mrs. Hudson were now knitting baby things in pink and other pastel shades, and the little one would never want for warm clothes. Sherlock even tried his hand at knitting, after Mummy gave him some refresher lessons (she had taught both boys when they were younger and trapped inside during a dreadfully cold, rainy summer), and was halfway through a baby blanket in a rainbow of hues. He found it a soothing way to think while working on crime-solving at home, and John was pleased his sweetheart had found something new to occupy his ever-whirling brain. If it kept him out of the lab more often, that was a bonus. In addition, once the baby was here, Sherlock could keep busy with knitting sometimes when the baby was asleep - when he really couldn't be all the way down in 221C. He didn't want to rely on a monitor when he'd be involved in some chemistry experiment and then have to dash upstairs – it was too easy to forego proper hand-washing in favour of hurrying, or to leave something still “brewing” that really shouldn't be left on its own. John knew that Sherlock could easily get distracted sometimes, and if their daughter needed soothing, any experiments would soon be forgotten.
The next day passed quickly, and right after lunch, they were soon being driven home in one of Mycroft's ever-present black cars, complete with a car seat, of course. This had worked out well, since they were worried about taking a newborn on a train with all the people who might be harbouring disease. They had the formula for the next month, and a list of points to remember and record for their personal records, which Sherlock would forward to Baskerville every week. Sheri was sleeping peacefully at present, and John and Sherlock likewise relaxed for the ride back to London, sharing memories of the birth and first days with their daughter.
“ I do think that asking Molly and Greg would be a great first step in knowing the main things we'll need. There are so many items out there, and I'm sure some are much more practical than others. Also, Sherlock - what would you think about some basic parenting classes for the both of us? I think they could be invaluable to us, since we have not been around that many young babies for any length of time. I am sure we can find some near here,” John suggested.
“Finally, your Daddy is the most important man in my life - I never thought I'd find anyone to love and share my life with - and now we have you as well, my little love. We will both be here for you, whatever you need, always. I love you so much, Sheri.” He brought her up to his lips and kissed the top of her head, marvelling at the new baby smell.
“Oh, John, you must watch him or he'll have a Brunhilda or Euphegenia in there somewhere for sure!” said Siger, wiping his eyes and catching his breath.
"So, then, I take it that you are in favour of this arrangement? No reservations? Even with the prospect of my brother having his fingers in the process - although we can be assured that he will be certain everything possible will be done to achieve a success; if only because it will relieve him from the onerous duty of having to actually produce an offspring of his own - even by this method," Sherlock also dissolved into another fit of giggles at the thought of Mycroft handling an infant on his own. "He'd probably need to create a whole new government division to deal with it."
"Well, there's nothing for it, we'll have to suffer a few visits from Uncle Myc - oh, god, can you imagine? He'll probably want to be called something grander, I am sure," John responded, with a slight chuckle. "I just want to know one more thing, Sherlock."
my boys, after all! You may have as many as you can fit into the place, if you wish! And, there is always 221C - I know it had a problem with damp and mould, but as you both know, I had it all fixed up last year. It would be fine for a lab, that way your experiments won't be anywhere near where a child could get into them.”
John got out of bed and walked over to his husband and said, “Why didn't you call me when she woke up?”
“I should think that just hearing you with us will be fine, Mummy - just as other grandparents do - she will know you are family, and that you love her. Babies are very good at picking up feelings,” Sherlock said. “But if you really wanted to, we can easily make recordings of you and play them to her - would you like that? ” he added, after John had not-so-subtly kicked him on the ankle.
When Sherlock woke, he and sat up, looking startled for a second until he realised where he was. He ran his hands through his hair and said, “God, how long was I asleep? I feel like someone hit me with a brick.”
“Oh, please, John, that is one woman who can make the British Government himself toe the line when she wishes, never underestimate her,” Sherlock said gleefully. “Mycroft won't know what hit him when she decides that it is time for them to have a child of their own. I
After they chose some knitted booties that were supposedly kick-off-proof, they finished this trip and paid for the merchandise. When they got back to Baker Street, Sherlock called Mrs. Hudson to come and see the baby photos and their purchases. After she cooed over them all, she wordlessly took the baby things down to her flat so that she could wash them all before they were worn. By the next day, there were baby things in many of the dresser drawers, and it felt to John and Sherlock that it wouldn't be so very long until they held their daughter in their arms.
Molly, Greg, and their other friends at the Met and elsewhere surprised them with a small party to celebrate the new baby. Everyone brought gifts - for Sheri and/or her parents. Some gifts were practical, others funny, like Philip's books on dinosaurs and the solar system - but Sherlock was well used to the teasing by now, and weathered it much better than in years past.
As he always did when faced with something both he and his husband really wanted anyway, John said “Yes.”
“You're right, John, I'll try my best not to second-guess everything. I know I can be my own worst critic as well as my own best advertisement at times. Now - did you want some toast, and maybe bacon, beans, and scrambled eggs? I can fix that for us. Now, the other thing to decide is - should we choose the sex, or leave it to develop as it will, and be surprised when we visit for the 16 week mark, when we can find out?” Sherlock asked, still walking around in circles, he was so excited.
"But, John, let me finish, please? At the same time, the technicians there have invented an actual artificial uterus! The entire process is called 'ectogenesis' and has been used to bring animal and human embryos to full-term. We wouldn't have to ask anyone to do this, John - we can have our own children - with the government's help, of course," the detective paused, still looking at John with a little apprehension.
He had also purchased another papoose wrap, since the first one got rather stained quite quickly, and he realised they'd need one more to have whilst the first was being laundered. Sheri loved being close to her Papa, and he found he missed her when she was not so near. He wore her around the flat nearly all the time, often reading to her from his book when he was sitting in his chair. The sound of his voice seemed to soothe her, and she happily snuggled with her Papa.
At this, John and Sherlock just smiled - they had noticed small things like her nose and the way her face crinkled when she was irritated - it was all John. They were so pleased that there were signs of both her parents in Sheri, and they were sure to notice more as time went by.
Sherlock suddenly sat straight up and said, "John! I think we should record both our voices so that the staff at Baskerville can play the recordings to the baby. It has been shown with ordinary pregnancies that the child recognises its parents' voices from hearing them through the mother's abdomen. So, it would only make sense to afford our child the same chance to learn our voices, don't you think?"
“Yes, it is pretty amazing – I had no idea! So now, John, I suppose you two will have to start thinking about names and so forth... have you any ideas yet?” asked Sherlock's dad, smiling at the pictures of the baby.
Sheri was curious and liked to explore whatever environment she occupied. Their daily outings to the park or museums were new opportunities, and she would have trotted off happily on her own, had not Sherlock and John kept a close eye on her. If they were going to be gone for longer than half an hour, they still took the pushchair along - but Sheri often protested when her freedom to run was taken away.
and three early embryos had been successfully created. Two were frozen for possible future use, and one was successfully implanted into the gestation device. The baby had so far grown as expected, and it would be only a few more weeks until they could get the first photo, a “scan” to show their friends. This would be done around 10 weeks and would also serve as a dating scan, to be certain the embryo was developing in a timely manner. The sex would be easily apparent at around 14 to 16 weeks' gestation. Sherlock and John planned to go up to Baskerville to find out the sex at that time. It would be their first visit to the baby. They had sent the iPod with music and their voices up several weeks before, and it was played every day through the sound system that linked into the gestation device.
“Oh, I think you may have mentioned it, but not in such detail. That is such a wonderful idea, love - she'll know you both and feel more comfortable, I am sure. What – erm - what about your father and I? Should we record our voices, too? Whatever you think is best, we'll gladly do,” Violet replied, her tone just a bit wistful.
“That will be a useful skill, brother. I am sure you will master it as easily as you have other things. Now, how can I help to make these preparations easier for you both?” asked Mycroft sincerely.
“Well, don't let me keep you - let's go on in, shall we?” Dr. Stapleton said, nodding at Sherlock's rapidly retreating back.
Molly offered to watch Sheri if they ever needed to go to a crime scene, which Sherlock appreciated, but was oddly not so anxious to do as he once would have been. He was content to do as he had been, viewing it on the computer or from photos, with Greg bringing over the facts on the case to Baker Street.
After Mrs. Hudson had held her for a bit, John went out and fixed the next bottle, and took Sheri back, sitting in Mummy's comfy rocking-chair. As soon as he touched the teat to her lips, Sheri began eagerly feeding. John sat there, smiling at his daughter the whole time. Sherlock, on the other side of the room, watched his husband and child with a slight smile.
"The one thing that – oh, you mean a child? Have you thought more about the surrogate route?" John answered, puzzled at the topic. They had talked about the subject several times, but the alternatives available left them to decide who would be the father of each child, should they decide to have more than one. John had always wanted children; and surprisingly, Sherlock had fallen immediately in love with Greg and Molly's first, and from then on he had also expressed a desire for at least one child, maybe more if they seemed to be able to handle it well. They had discussed it several times, but had made no decisions as to how they'd find a suitable surrogate. Perhaps that's where Mycroft came in.
Mycroft's face lit up, and he added, “I think that is a wonderful idea, John. I am sure we could arrange a private session here at the flat, if it would be more agreeable to you,” knowing Sherlock would probably spend half the time deducing and dismissing the other parents-to-be, and the other half being self-conscious.
They each were photographed extensively, so that features could be studied and compared to the child. Dr. Stapleton explained it was to have a complete visual record of them both. Samples were taken of several bodily fluids. Dr. Stapleton explained that in about 2-3 weeks, the cell lines should be ready to grow into whatever type of cell was needed - in their case, eggs. She told them they would be notified when that had been achieved and they could decide whose cells would be used for eggs, and the other would, obviously, provide the spermatozoa. Semen samples had been taken from both of them and frozen for future use. Obtaining those samples was the stuff of much giggling from Sherlock and John, sequestered in one of the 'sample' rooms. Hopefully, no one heard them...
Greg told them that Emily had said her first word, “Mama,” which occasioned a round of applause. If Sherlock had a slight smirk on his face, it was not an unusual expression for him, and no one remarked on it...
, a banana-flower salad with lime and chilli sauce; and of course, green tea. Sherlock told her that he and John had very briefly stopped into a baby shop the day before, but had honestly been so overwhelmed at the sheer volume of things, they made no decisions, much less a list of what they needed. Mrs. Hudson tutted at him, patting his hand where it rested on the table.
“Oh, yes, please, dear, if it's not too much trouble – she is likely to be our only grandchild, after all. Unless, of course, you and John have another one,” Violet answered.
They collected their car and drove up to the Cross Keys Inn, having made reservations the week before. Gary and Billy were delighted to see them, as always. They went up to their room for a brief change of clothing, then had lunch downstairs in the dining room. After lunch, they got back into the Range Rover and headed for Baskerville. At the gate, they were greeted and sent through after the vehicle's undercarriage was checked. They pulled up at a different building than the one they visited the first time. The human genetic studies and ectogenesis labs had been set up in their own separate suite of labs, with adjoining nursery and paediatric areas.
would - he'd had enough friends with children to know chances for a bit of peace and quiet were rare with a little one. He couldn't wait!
was a behaviour that would need to be modified when they had a baby in the flat! (Of course, Sherlock would probably just go up to the roof and play – or use a mute) At any rate, John was glad that Sherlock was getting some sleep now, as he would be less aggravated by the paperwork and physicals, etc., that lay ahead for both of them.
"Oh, Sherlock - can you imagine your mother? She'll be over the moon to finally get a grandchild of her own - and she will appreciate the technology, but in the end, it will be all about the baby! And your dad...oh, this is too much! I can see him with his red bow tie and musical socks at Christmas time now! Probably just as well that both my parents are gone now; they'd never be able to understand why I am married to a man, much less having children with him! Harry will just think it is one more part of our crazy lives! And just think about Sally and Anderson - oh, this is too rich! Sorry, I know I'm babbling again, but I just - I'm so giddy at the possibility of it all," John finished for the moment, hugging Sherlock tightly.
“Thank you, it's a great idea,” answered John. “I've wanted his experiments moved out of the flat for ages now, and 221C would be perfect for that. Sherlock could get in the equipment he needs to make it a proper lab, and we'd be able to have only FOOD in our fridge!”
He looked over at his husband. Sherlock was staring, mouth open, transfixed by the sight of their daughter – their
Sherlock had a text back from Mycroft in a few minutes. He said the photo was a definite go, and would be listed as something they wished to have as soon as the embryo reached the usual 'first scan' gestational age. There would be a copy for each of them, and they could also get one for the grandparents. John and Sherlock both asked to have one made for Mrs. Hudson, as well.
“Yes, that is essentially what they have accomplished so far. They use skin cells and create a whole line of stem cells, so that they are available later if need be. In future, this may have some far-reaching applications in the case of injury or disease for either of you, of course. But, for the present, they are able to create egg cells from either person and then use the sperm cells from the other. They very carefully monitor which parent provides which cell, so that the child will definitely be from both parents.”
had an eventful and exhausting morning and early afternoon. Sherlock answered by diving onto the couch, waiting for John to slide under his head, and turned onto his side, facing John's tummy. John grinned and threw a knitted blanket over his love and was rewarded within a few minutes by Sherlock's soft snoring, (“Of course, I don't snore, John! I don't know where you get these ideas sometimes!”) and settled in to watch Dr. Who.
Sherlock scanned the photos into his computer, keeping the sleeve intact while he did so - he wanted a sequential record in his files. He then entered the photos and the information they had so far into the baby book that would be shown to family and friends. Somehow, the day passed, and when it was bedtime, John carried the copies of the photos into their room when they retired for the night. It just didn't feel right to let them stay in the sitting-room alone. They both acknowledged that they were being hopelessly sentimental, and smiled as they turned out the lights to watch a bit of telly before going to sleep.
When Sherlock heard a faint noise from the bedroom, he got up and went to check on Sheri. She was not yet crying, just shifting about and fussing a bit. Sherlock checked her nappy and picked her up and lay her on the bed to change her. With that problem resolved, he lay her back down in her cot and picked up his violin. John looked in a few minutes later to see their daughter looking content and just about back to sleep, with Sherlock playing softly to her. He didn't think his love noticed that he had come into the room, as he had his eyes closed whilst he played. John took another sneaky photo with his phone and went back to the dining room.
disappointed that John didn't need to pull rank this time around, John was glad they were not on borrowed time with a stolen ID. Sherlock and John were greeted by Dr. Stapleton herself, and taken to a room where tea was laid, for some initial talks. Since they had been on the road for a while, they appreciated the tea and biscuits. Then they followed Dr. Stapleton to her lab. She took detailed medical histories of both John and Sherlock, even though she had their medical forms via Mycroft. She wanted to be certain that everything was accurate and up to date.
“Well, no, we didn't want to start down that road until we knew for sure - and we'll still have lots of time to decide. I'm sure Sherlock has an unusual name or two from the family history to choose from, don't you, love?” John answered, smiling at his sweetheart.
Sherlock was anxious to start the baby care classes. They knew a few basics, of course, and had picked up some more pointers from being around Molly and her family; but it was next to nothing when faced with caring for their daughter every day. As with everything he did, Sherlock wanted to excel in baby care. He spent hours reading online, and would have bought half a dozen books, but John advised him to wait and at least ask Molly which she thought was most helpful. To John's surprise, Sherlock agreed. He thought Molly and Greg (yes, he
After they had all had a good look – or three – at the baby's scan photos, everyone went into the dining room for Mummy's excellent meal, which everyone had seconds of, even Sherlock. He still managed to have a generous slice of the banoffee pie – John didn't think he had ever seen Sherlock enjoy a meal more. After Violet promised to share her 'secret' recipe for her chicken, John vowed to make it every now and again, hoping to tempt his husband to eat more - even occasionally.
Sherlock looked properly chastened. "For god's sake, John, this will be our child, not a lab rat! I'd never do anything to harm him – erm - her. I am not a thoughtless person, no matter what some people think!"
He went down the stairs and asked Mrs. Hudson to lunch and to go shopping with him that afternoon. He wanted to look at the basics they would need, and Mrs. Hudson had many friends with children, although she had never given birth - he and John were her only two 'children.'
The following Monday, Sherlock and John were on a train to Dartmoor. Sherlock spent the first part of the journey complaining about the patchy wi-fi, until John commandeered his mobile and told him to get some tea and sleep, in that order. The detective grudgingly complied, but was soon asleep huddled in his coat, with his head on John's shoulder. John sighed in relief at the silence, and went back to reading his Kindle in relative peace. Not surprisingly, Sherlock was up most of the night before they left, sawing away at the violin.
“I could see that you were knackered, and I knew I wouldn't be sleeping anyway once I was awake the first time. There was no need for both of us to be awake. It's fine, love, I'm all right. I'm certain there will be plenty of nights when I am the tired one and you are up more of the night with her - don't take on so. I was just about to go out into the kitchen and see if Mummy has any coffee on – do you want to come with us?” he unfolded himself from the rocker and headed out of the room. John tagged along after them.
John and Sherlock sat with their heads together, poring over the photos. Since it was such an early one, not a lot of definite characteristics were to be seen, but just knowing that this was their child, was both exhilarating and anxiety-inducing at the same time. They looked until their eyes were tired, and then put the photos aside, in the archival sleeves that Sherlock had ready for them.
Sherlock looked at them both, and said, softly, "I – I – erm - I was trying to think of all the things we'd need to do for the lab, and the nursery, and – I - just - couldn't breathe, all of a sudden. I'm sorry that I caused a fuss, I didn't mean to..." he trailed off, looking embarrassed.
Finally, after an extension on the date, they each had a list and sat down at the table. After each of them tossing out a few names the other deemed suitable, they settled on Catriona (John's list, 'pure, clear', besides being Scottish in origin) Hollis ('lives by the holly trees') Sheridan (a Holmes family surname, originally Irish, which meant either 'untamed' or 'elf' ) Holmes-Watson. She would be called “Sheri” for a nickname - well, probably, until she decided what she wanted to be called. It was rather a mouthful, but they were both pleased, and so the matter was settled. They used the combined surname on legal documents, otherwise going by their original ones to avoid confusion. They
“Then, we seem to agree, yes? You will receive updates, and can check in anytime via computer, and can visit, with a phone call ahead of time, to arrange a time and date. That is all in keeping with your interest as the parents of the child, and in the interests of the project, as well,” Mycroft said, standing to leave. “I'll have the final papers drawn up, and arrange for you both to travel to Baskerville so your tissue samples can be taken. This can get under way quite quickly, now that all this has been decided. I'll text you and return with the papers, or send Anthea with them, and you will be issued passwords for the Baskerville website, as well as identification badges for the facility.”
“No, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't give her at least two names so that she can choose which is the least offensive to her when she is older - trust me, everyone goes through a period of hating their name,” added Violet, arching her eyebrow over at her youngest son. “Though sometimes they choose the name you thought would always be relegated to an initial later on...” and she winked at Sherlock, who tried to look haughty and innocent at the suggestion.
The past three weeks had seen many changes to the flat. Sherlock's lab was downstairs in 221C, and was fully functional. John was exceedingly grateful for that fact, for it meant that their flat was no longer a toxic hazard. Even if they hadn't been planning for a baby, the change wrought by the lab's transfer was most welcome. John also gave Sherlock no choice but to relocate most of his many collections down in 221C, as well.
After an hour or so, John and Sherlock decided they liked one of the simplest designs for the cot and other furniture. It had clean lines and was a lovely light oak finish, which would make the nursery brighter. There was a matching bureau and changing table - and John pointed out a rocking chair that he thought would be a good addition to the lounge, if they moved things around a bit. He thought it was better there, where they could sit by the fire with the baby when s/he was up at night in cooler weather. Sherlock agreed, as the chair was a retro design that went well with their hodgepodge, and was upholstered in a warm plaid of navy and hunter green. If they just moved the desk over a bit, and shifted Sherlock's chair a bit nearer the window... yes, that should do nicely. They both could easily visualise rocking the baby there. They decided they would show their choices to Molly and Greg when they came to dinner and see what they thought.
“John! Good morning! Dr. Stapleton has emailed me this morning, and the cells will be ready by Monday. Can we decide who will provide which cells? If you don't mind, I'll provide the eggs, unless you have a preference -?”
