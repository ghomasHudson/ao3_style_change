To see him outside was mildly off putting. To Dean’s knowledge, Cas only left the bunker to go hunting with the brothers. The reappearance of the trench coat had him smiling though.
Surreptitiously he looked out of the corner of his eye but saw nothing. Allowing his eye to wander back to the path in front he immediately caught another flicker, this one slower. Again, he looked out of the corner of his eye but saw nothing.
He began walking and soon Cas fell into step with him.
Dark Haired Guy turned, Dean gulped, his eyes were very blue.
After the light had died down, Castiel opened his eyes and his mouth fell open. He could see colour.
Dean began to laugh. “Join the club dude. I escaped my own roomies hours ago but I’d bet my paycheck they’re not done yet”
“Oh for- Yes I am sure. I’m pretty sure. I think I’d know if I was a witch wouldn’t you?” he gestured to the sunny cottage that lay across the road “That’s your witches house. His name is Dean. He’ll help you”
"I am serious Dean" he said gravely "I did a scan of the area prior to my landing, nothing was out of the ordinary. Everyone here is exactly as it's supposed to be. I wouldn't permit you to rest here otherwise"
Castiel had been gone about twelve hours when Dean finally noticed. The former-angel was prone to bouts of irritability and apathy that resulted in him hiding under the blankets in his room so when he stormed up and didn’t reappear, Dean thought nothing of it. It was only later when the angel didn’t appear for his tea that he recognised the discrepancy for what it was. The only thing that seemed to bring Castiel a small measure of happiness was his routine. You could set your watch by his habits.
“Well it definitely suits you but I am sorry that people keep bothering you...So I brought a pie” he rubbed the back of his head self-consciously “I figured you might like it, it’s made from fruit from my garden, organic and everything”
"Uh, whatcha doing there Cas?" He asked, trying to lean against the door frame casually.
Dean breathed in sharply
When Cas had agreed to letting him see his wings, Dean had entered a slight state of disbelief. He honestly didn't think it would be so easy but nevertheless, out there was Cas willing to bare his wings for Dean's curiosity. Dean kept his eyes glued to his back already taking the individual shimmers that were already manifesting. Cas turned and faced Dean then rolled his shoulders and mother of god, Dean watched open mouthed as two sunbeams bent around him and kept growing. Out and out they spread and wow. They freaking massive. Looking at the very tips Dean estimated maybe 17 feet at least. Dean objectively knew that Cas was an angel but knowing and seeing proof were two entirely different things altogether.
"Okay, okay" he sighed "That was pathetic wasn't it...Don't answer that" he added quickly before whining "You can't blame me, I didn't get any sleep last night"
If he had never made that stupid bet then Dean wouldn’t be standing here in knee-quaking terror. He snuck a look at the metal monstrosity that loomed above him and swallowed heavily. Stupid Sammy. Stupid Dean. Stupid roller coasters. The front of the line came way too quickly for his liking. Weren't these lines meant to be long and boring? He had read that somewhere hadn't he? His phone vibrated in his pocket
Hopping off the bed, Cas reached under it and pulled out a wheely box
Cas couldn’t stop his eyes from lighting up “I’m always a sucker for pie, would you like to come in? I had planned on making a cup of tea before you knocked”
Dean gingerly threaded the T-shirt into the desired space taking a moment to realise that it was his AC/DC one that he'd been looking for all week and would likely not be available any time soon.
Castiel was having a lovely day. He got home from work early and spent the afternoon stretched out on his bed reading with a cup of tea. There wasn't even any music next door so he could finally relax. This bubble of peace however, was rudely broken by a shout followed by a sudden door slam and the appearance of a very flustered Gabriel in his room.
Cas nodded “People don’t seem to realise that a preference for dark clothes and silver jewellery does not in fact, go hand in hand with being a witch”
Casting a glance at the clock, Dean decided that if he wanted to avoid the need for brain bleach, he better skip out now. Chuck and Becky could get really weird sometimes. In fact, he’d sworn he heard her refer to him as a god once and that was more than he ever needed to know. He hadn’t been able to look either of them in the eyes for a week after that one, so in the name of a harmonious dorm, he grabbed the textbook he’d been studying and a bottle of water before hightailing it out the door blushing at another loud moan.
“Some is better than nothing” Dean replied “Stick it in the fridge there. Sammy’s at a sleepover all weekend so he won’t see it”
Castiel’s gaze never wavered from where it was focused on the sky “I wanted to be alone”
“Ha ha ha” Dean said sarcastically as he placed the popcorn down and made his way over to the DVD player to slip in the first disc. “Budge up” he ordered as he approached the couch. Cas obliged and Dean slipped in beside him “You ready for this?”
“And who’s fault is that?” Castiel snapped “You threw me out Dean. I thought this was what you wanted”
“I’d like that” Dean smiled, following Cas back down the hall to the kitchen.
Dean ducked his head and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly “I’m glad you like it, least I can do. But it must get annoying though right?” Dean prompted “I can’t imagine you enjoy getting constantly interrupted?”
Dean huffed and wriggled out of her embrace only to be pulled into one by John “Oh come on Dad!”
Dean himself could be found in one of three places. Listening to his tapes in Baby with the volume turned up so loud the car would reverberate and the walls echo. Alternatively, he would hole up in his room with the door firmly closed desperately trying to practice the meditation exercises Lisa had given him long ago for peace and clarity of mind. Failing that, Dean would be on the roof of the Bunker staring up at the sky and letting his thoughts scuttle across the sky with the clouds.
“No” Cas admitted “It’s not ideal but I’m a gardener so at least I don’t have any bigwigs shouting at me for interrupting meetings or anything”
“Yeah” Dean agreed “It’s been a bad year for them alright. I’d be more than happy to help!”
Today though, Dean felt restless. He had lounged in bed, dripped ice water on Sam but still felt off. He sighed loudly. From the other sofa, Sam gave him the stink eye. He still hadn’t forgiven Dean for his wake up call.
"Can I see them?" Dean asked suddenly "I mean, you don't have to, it's probably a super private angels only party or something, forget I said it actually. Uh, never mind"
"This is awesome Cas" he said after a few delicious moments of warmth and peace
“Fine” he muttered, brushing himself off “I guess I’ll go for a walk or something”
“No I realised” Dean said somewhat moodily “I just can’t do anything about it I mean look! Every person in here is obsessed with the man. I don’t even know if he swings any way let alone my way”
Castiel gritted his teeth "This is my apartment too you assbutt. You can't just tell me to get out"
Maybe angel wings were a mirror of their owner, Cas seemed like a force of nature at times, maybe that was a manifestation of that? But at the same time an image of Cas, so small and so meek, dressed only in white and looking the furthest thing from that came to mind. Once again, Dean was reminded that his friend contained multitudes, in the same way Castiel the angel existed across dimensions, Dean’s friend Cas had so many faces that Dean had an unfortunate tendency to forget.
Slim, if Dean was any judge.
“I can’t empathise completely Cas” Dean began softly “I can’t even begin to imagine what you are going through and I wouldn’t presume to. But the burden you feel? I hold every life I destroyed on the Rack close to me. I remember the agony I caused, the fear and the terror. It haunts me to this day. I still hear the screams sometimes”
The next few weeks were relatively peaceful. Dean kept his music to a respectable level and in return, Castiel wasn't any louder that necessary. The two inhabitants carried on with their lives as peacefully as ever.
“Well that’s a relief” Dean laughed as he took the mug from Cas with a nod and took a sip “You know, it’s been such a long day that I don’t even care that it’s a bit too hot at the moment. It’s hits the spot”
After half an hour past Castiel’s tea time passed, Dean finally set out looking for him. The first place he went was Castiel’s room. With a knock on the door and a courtesy call he cracked the door open and peered inside. But instead of what he was expecting, he was greeted with the sight of an empty bed, impeccably made but empty of its inhabitant.
“Oh I’d say he does” said Jo smugly, he was so blatantly checking you out when you were walking back from the bar.
Dean was washing his hands and trying frantically to figure out a way to subtly find out this guy’s deal and if he was the Mystery Person  when the door opened and Dark Haired Guy walked in. He headed to the sink and splashed water on his face with a loud sigh.
Dean often forgot that Cas. Weird, dorky Cas who liked his tea with honey and lemon and could often be found asleep on some large tome in a dusty corner, was in fact a celestial being. One of God's own warriors to be precise.
Castiel pulled the hand he was still holding closer then scrawled his digits onto it.
“ I don’t understand how my siblings could look at humanity and see it as anything other than a miracle. When I see the snow I think how each human is a snowflake. Individually they cannot achieve much but when they bond together, they are immeasurably powerful and there is very little they cannot do”
As the sound of popping corn filled the kitchen, Dean and Cas cracked open their first beer and chatted,
Castiel smiled “I’d like that”
“Coming!” he heard Dean yell back “Thanks babe”
“Hey, yes I’m looking for the witch? I need a potion for my wife and she-”
“Ngh” said Dean for the second time that evening
The boy looked taken aback “Hours?”
"Lightning" Dean replied slowly "You conjured a storm out of nowhere and a lightning flash lit up your wings"
When the sound of his doorbell rang through the greenhouse, Cas sighed heavily and placed down his trowel “Please just be the postman” he mumbled but the doorbell rang again, quite insistently this time and with a shake of his head he admitted defeat.
“Romantically blind is an awfully generous term, Dean. Some would say you’re just stupid”
“What?” Dean asked
"I can think of something" he grinned holding out a packet of mini chocolate bars "It's special occasion, go nuts"
He watched with fascination as Cas picked up a pillow and subjected it to intense scrutiny before placing it a few inches to his left. He returned to the pile and only a few seconds later, began repeating his ritual.
Sam would seek refuge in the library. There was an old, paisley-patterned armchair hidden in an alcove near the back. If you didn’t know of its existence you’d walk right past it. Sam made use of this by gathering an armload of books and holing up there with a mug of tea. If the silence got too loud, he’d be found in the gym trying to exercise his demons.
“My wings. With them I could do anything. I was a Seraph Dean. Do you know what that means?”
Castiel laughed. “You’re even cuter when you’re tongue tied” and deliberately licked his lips and ohgodwasthatatonguepiercing?
They were flirting, they were definitely flirting ohmygod. Well, Dean amended in his head, Castiel was flirting and Dean was making an absolute fool of himself. With this valiant rallying call in his head he closed his mouth and mustered up a smirk of his own. As he leaned in, Castiel met his movement until they were undeniably close.
“I’ve had worse” the man returned deadpan then held out a hand “Castiel”
“I am very sorry about that” Dean smiled bashfully but seemed mollified when Cas waved it off
The man stared at Cas then at the dark wood on the porch then back to Cas, lingering specifically on the eyeliner and silver pendants
The man, Castiel, he supposed, still had a grip on his hand and dragged him forwards. The attendant shepherded them into seats and pushed down the restraints. Dean was trapped but Castiel was still holding his hand even though Dean knew it had to be clammy.
Dean started in surprise.
It was a strange unexplained event. Some claimed that aliens had done it, others believed that it was a global conspiracy between governments that had failed. Fundamentals howled that it was divine wrath while scientists bowed their heads over their instruments and furiously conducted research. On the whole, no-one was sure and then, as years went by, then decades, then centuries, people did what people do best and just got on with it until eventually it became normal.
There was a pneumatic hiss and Dean jumped as they began creeping forward. A few seconds passed with nothing happening and Dean relaxed slightly before he noticed the abrupt end to the track a few feet in front.
Sam sighed bitterly. You couldn't escape it. No matter how far you ran or how well you hid, something would always turn up and drag you back. Sam was resigned now but saw no point in stewing. He'd make the best of a bad situation and get on with it. He didn't have to be thrilled, he just had to deal with it.
"So" he began "Theoretically, if you stood out under the sun as it is here, I'd see your wings in their entirety?"
Sam’s eyes dropped to their hands and Dean shifted nervously. Then Sam smiled
"Dammit Cas!" Dean snapped. "How many times man?"
Here he shuffled uncomfortably for a moment before continuing
“What did you want Mom?” Dean interrupted before the pseudo-argument could go any further
"Hey can you keep it down" he growled "Some of us are trying to sleep here"
He was cut off mid sentence by the door flying open. The man who stepped out was definitely not the man who had run in. He was tall, had tousled hair and, and...Dean squinted slightly, tirade momentarily delayed as his brain struggled to accept what was happening. Neurons fizzled, new pathways opened up and slowly, so very, very slowly, colour bled into his world.
The darkness in Castiel’s eyes was surely mirrored in Dean’s and he opened his mouth to reply, but was interrupted by a drunk guy further down the bar waving some cash about.
Dean gritted his teeth. Like hell he would. There was no way he’d be Sammy’s slave. The stupid emoticon only drove that certainty deeper into his brain. He was Dean Winchester and Dean Winchester never backed down from a bet.
Castiel watched as Dean rubbed his hands on his knees and shuffled on the bench as though some internal conflict was taking place. Frowning slightly, Cas was tempted to look into Dean's mind to see if he could help but he valued his closest friends privacy too much. Resigned to simply sitting tight until Dean revealed himself, Castiel turned his gaze back to Dean's face.
Once Dean's laughter was under control and his feathers were beginning to settle back down, Castiel had started to relax before an unexpected weight landed on his shoulder.
Sam looked up with a start “I saw him heading upstairs, did you check his room?”
“So what’s the flavour?” he asked setting some plates on the counter and reaching for the pie
Castiel smirked and pulled him towards the railings so Dean could brace himself
Cas could feel Dean's admiration from where he was standing and felt something warm. Racking his brain, he tried to pinpoint the feeling and got as far as 'flattered' before Dean's deep voice distracted him.
“I know, I know” she said “But I’ll miss you anyway”
Children simply had no concept of colour. Teachers skipped over it because how could you explain the blue of the sky or the yellow of a flower with no reference to go to? Special classes were set up for people who had found their soul mate where colour was taught. The age range varied from toddlers to those in their eighties, though elderly class goers were rare. Once you hit 40 your chances of finding a soul mate began to decline and by the time you hit retirement age your chances were very small indeed. It still happened but not with any great frequency.
Passing the laundry room sparked an idea and he stuck his head round the door to check if it was busy but not a soul was in sight. Perfect.
Cas’s eyes sharpened “You said one last thing in that statement, Dean. Did you also mean that?”
Dean sighed, “It’s the thrill of the fight, Harvelle, wish me luck”
Dean just chuckled and pressed play.
“Ye-yes something is wrong Cas” Dean spluttered “Is that really how you think we see you?”
Cas tilted his head. "I apologize Dean. It was not my intention to startle you"
Across the campus, a much less cheerful Dean was sitting on Jo Harvelle's sofa complaining like there was no tomorrow.
“There you go and, maybe call me even if there’s no roller-coasters?”
Dean stiffened. They had never talked about Cas’s feelings for his estranged father. Forcing himself to relax so he wouldn’t screw up this moment, he searched for something to say. Cas didn’t let him find the perfect reply though.
It’s okay, Dean” Cas laughed “My brother is a witch, he has the same outlook as you. It’s a very common one for witches to have”
The scathing glare Dean levelled at her would have sent lesser people scrambling but Jo Harvelle had dealt with Dean Winchester’s shit for too long. “Either you do it or I will”
Cas narrowed his eyes as he worked through Dean's statement and probably filing it away somewhere for later perusal. Dean couldn't bring himself to care though, he was waiting for the answer.
“A gardener?” Dean asked, perking up “I’m a plant witch, if you ever need any help, well, you know where I live”
“It’s a date”
Castiel lazily opened one eye scrutinizing Dean with an intense stare. He could tell Dean was semi-serious about the Impala but couldn't really bring himself to care. He was delightfully relaxed in a way that he couldn't remember ever being before. The guise of humanity brought almost as many downsides as it did upsides.
“First the pie and now this” Cas smirked “If I didn’t know better Dean Winchester, I’d say you were trying to sweeten me up” but his eyes widened at the hint of blush that stole over the tips of Dean’s ears for a moment. Interesting.
“What?!” Dean yelled, getting a glare from the girls at the table next to them, ignoring them with the ease granted to him as an older sibling he nonetheless lowered his voice and repeated ‘What?” in a more reasonable tone.
Castiel looked into his eyes and Dean was struck by how blue they were
“Well don’t strain anything”
He looked up and saw the boy carefully turning every item inside out and checking the pockets. That was normal washing behaviour, Dean’s mama had taught him that, but the question was why so slowly? Maybe he lost something?
“Dean” Dean replied shaking his hand “Once you’ve finished your wash we should go for coffee or something, I’m pretty sure we can dodge the showers if we run”
“You don’t need luck, Winchester, that man is so into you. He watches you as much as you watch him”
Dean waved a hand over his shoulder with a vague mumble and carried on. Stopping by his room, Dean wrapped a scarf around his neck and stuck a hat on his head. Shrugging on his coat, he made his way outside, shoving his hand in his pockets as he went.
Lying back, he took in the sun streaming through the foliage and smiled happily as a cloud scuttled across the sun.
"Nothing" he answered shortly.
This was an old fic I fixed up and posted here. Enjoy
“Have you guys seen Cas?” he asked
Yeah, maybe being a witches neighbour wasn’t all bad.
There was no reply save for a quiet rustle as Cas settled himself better on the old wooden construct. Dean presumed that he was 'watching humanity' or whatever and tuned him out.
Now Dean wasn't a modest dude by any standards, but his roommates could’ve reddened the face of even the most experienced escort. His recent dry spell was really not helping either.
“Cas!” Dean beamed “Welcome in man, you’re just in time, Mom and Dad are just about to leave”
Little Castiel or Cas as he was called by all, passed toddler-hood with no difficulty. He sat quietly, learned shapes and occasionally reading. A very conventionally good child. As he grew (apart from a brief rebellious stage when he turned 9 and began exploring, often disappearing for hours on end and giving his poor parents more than a few grey hairs) he remained very much the same. Studious, dependable and slightly reclusive. That was Castiel.
Dean shrugged “No skin off my nose dude, feel free”
Castiel on the other hand was an unknown variable. Having been found by Dean about a month ago after falling, a subject he was notoriously tight-lipped about, he had not yet adjusted fully from being homeless to having an entire abode to inhabit. He had not yet been taken by one of the strange moods that afflicted the rest of the inhabitants but it was only a matter of time.
“Oh stop being dramatic, Dean. He thought your truly eloquent grunt was cute and winked at you as well? You’re in with a shot dude. For the love of god give that man your number before we leave tonight, I can’t deal with another night of pining”
Dean was silent as he processed all that Cas had just told him. He had always known that Cas had wings, it was just one of those things that you never really questioned until it was brought to your attention. True, Dean had a bit of a habit of forgetting that his best friend was in fact an ancient and powerful being who had probably been around since time began and would be here long after Dean himself had shuffled off of this mortal coil but still, considering the physiology of angel Cas had never really been high on Dean's list of priorities
Dean honest-to-god stumbled and would have fallen if a surprisingly strong arm hadn’t been there to hold him up.
“If you’re looking for the witch, he’s across the road” he said on autopilot and then looked up into a pair of shockingly green eyes
Dean nodded “I lost a bet and this was my forfeit. I hate roller coasters”
He didn't even need to look around to know the snarky eyebrow raise Jo was levelling at him.
"Whoa dude" Jo interrupted before Dean could continue "Are you going to stop for breath at all? I know I'm pre-med and all but I'd rather not have to perform CPR on your ugly mug"
The sound of the doorbell ringing had Cas leaving the greenhouse absently wiping his hands on his shirt.
Dean was taken aback slightly by the bluntness. Sure Cas had a habit of... brusqueness occasionally...but he rarely gave such monotone and uninformative answers.
Castiel stared at the door puzzled. A few seconds later his confusion was lifted by a sudden banging and angry shouts. It took him a minute to place the voice by which time, another series of heavy knocking complete with some curses was happening.
It was later that evening when the sound of the doorbell rang through the house again. Cas didn’t even bother to put down his book. Maybe if he sat quietly the person would give up and leave? It was past dark anyway, who would be calling at this time- Unless it was one of Dean’s visitors in urgent need who thought Cas was the witch. With a groan, Cas pulled himself off the couch. He’d be a good Samaritan. It was fine.
Dean sat on the bench, head thrown back basking in the sun. He and Sam had just finished a particularly challenging case with a coven of witches and both were off relaxing in their own ways before moving on. Sam had gone off to a little coffee shop but Dean decided that since it was so nice out, he'd just chill in the Park. His eyes were shut, his world bathed in bright red and gold. Dean felt like he would melt. Here, with the sound of children playing and trees rustling slightly in the breeze he could forget, just for a while, how screwed up the world really was. A breath whispered out from between his lips and spiraled up towards the blue sky. This was perfect. The only thing that could possibly make it better was-
His wings were itching and Castiel suddenly felt the urge to free them and let them bask in the warm sun. He did so hoping that the noise of them unfurling hadn't woken the sleeping human beside him. Dean's breath hitched slightly but he was otherwise undisturbed. Relaxing back, Castiel arranged his wings for optimum comfort and resumed staring.
Castiel ducked his head slightly embarrassed and almost flinched when Dean let his hand fall on his shoulder.
With a puzzled grin, he knocked once on the wall to show he’d gotten the message then slowly began to tap out a reply
It was, however, probably not wise to voice that thought now though.
“Are you sure?” he asked with a raise of his eyebrow
By his side, Cas sighed quietly as he looked up
"I see no reason to object" Cas stated "They are not an Angel Only Party as you said. They are simply wings"
Castiel blushed. He honest to god blushed. Suddenly Dean felt back on regular footing, he was just a normal man, not some kind of angel sent from above
Both men stood there for what felt like hours simply staring. It went on for so long that Gabriel snuck out to see why the shouting wasn't happening. Peering cautiously around Castiel's body, he noticed that neither was moving. They seemed, he shuddered at even mentally saying the phrase but there was no other way around it, they were lost in each other's eyes.
“Ah yes, I was just wondering if you’re all set for the night?”
“We all have those days Cas, but being alone isn’t always a good thing. It took me a long time but I’ve finally grasped that”
Dean walked out next to Castiel, still holding hands and made his way towards his brother. Sam smirked when he caught sight of Dean but switched to confusion at the man by his side
Dean wasn’t in the mood for the library, the hush was too stifling. The weather was bad so that ruled out the possibility of the courtyard. He wandered the building looking for a quiet place to study. All his friends lived in other dorms and he wasn't going to brave the flat to retrieve an umbrella.
-5 yrs later-
Gabriel laughed and hugged his friend. "Dude you're the best" he smiled happily before ripping it open and tucking in.
“I would never!” Dean flushed “I only use them on people who consent”
"It never is" Dean mumbled as he slumped back "Whatever dude just let me back to my nap. It was relaxing"
“It was my pleasure” he said solemnly then reached into his pocket pulling out a pen. “Shall I give you my number in case you ever need a roller coaster buddy again?”
Cas was starting to get huffy. Dean had yet to stop laughing at his plight and was practically wheezing as he doubled over. Shaking out his feathers grumpily he began to scowl. Noticing this, Dean began to slowly reign in his laughter until he only emitted the occasional snort which eventually stopped altogether. He let out a deep breath.
A slight pressure on his shoulder a few minutes later had him tensing for a fight but a sideways glance at Dean relaxed him almost immediately. Dean's head had fallen onto Castiel's and he was snoring slightly. Castiel was filled with a sense of pride that Dean Winchester of all people had elected him a suitable person to trust. Almost on instinct his left wing reacted to Dean and curved around him protectively. Dean shifted lightly and his worry lines faded slightly. Smiling softly, Cas turned his head and closed his eyes enjoying the peace.
“Well we are 17” Dean shrugged “I guess with Sam out the house and you being, well, you, they didn’t see the harm”
Frowning, Castiel strode to the door and wrenched it open. Mouth open to refute any and all of D. Winchester's accusations against him for whatever the imaginary crimes he was meant to have committed were, he paused. Something fizzy was happening behind his eyes. It spread all over his body raising the hair on the back of his neck and sending a shiver down his spine. A sudden brightness filled his vision and he squinted his eyes against the glare.
Cas’ heart was racing. ‘Be normal’ he chastised himself ‘It’s just pie and tea. Friendly neighbourly stuff. Outwardly he gestured at the island and Dean obligingly set down the (exceptionally delicious looking) pie.
"Shut up" he called hoarsely "Please, for the love of all that's holy, shut up!"
“Whatever” Jo smirked as Dean dug around in his bag for a scrap of paper and a pen “Looks like it’s a quiet time at the bar” She gestured with her chin where Cas was polishing glasses at the counter. “Go get ‘em tiger”
“That’s all I ask Cas” Dean said smiling “Do you want to stay up here or come back to the Bunker. I’m making burgers”
He had said it before, once or twice maybe but he meant it every single time. He still did actually, Cas wouldn't be Cas otherwise. It was hard however, not to laugh at his face because unless faced with an actual problem, Cas's pouts and glares made him look more like a puppy than a celestial warrior. Reaching out, he clapped Cas's shoulder firmly. The start of surprise was kind of expected and wow, wasn't that a seriously sad thing to think. That a guy was so unused to friendly contact that it still took him by surprise. Making a decision, Dean decided to leave his hand there for a bit longer.
Dean jerked a bit from where he was drifting off
Dean shot her a glare “I’m not smitten shut up. This a totally manly crush”
“Hello, Dean” Castiel replied, looking up and locking eyes with Dean. Oh god he was already regretting this hiseyesweresoblueohmygod. The panic spiral immediately dissolved as Jo’s imaginary voice started berating him. And the real Jo was probably also berating him from her cozy corner table where she apparently got drinks and a show.
When Dean came in, his heart nearly melted. Cas had made a sort of blanket nest big enough for two and was curled up in it looking fluid and relaxed. Dean knew that Cas had been under a lot of stress recently from his family and it was good to see him just chill for once. The sticky up, fluffy hair was a bonus though, as were the blue eyes that blinked at him.
“Uh, is this the witch?” the man asked hopefully as he stared at Cas.
“That’s a very kind offer, Dean, thank you. I actually may need some help when you’re next free. I seem to have a very persistent aphid problem and nothing I try is working”
Dean was gobsmacked. The matter-of-fact way that Cas had delivered this bombshell meant he had been thinking this for quite some time and had apparently come to terms with it, if his calm acceptance was to be believed. Is this really how he thought? Did he not know how important he was to them?
Maybe roller coasters weren’t too bad after all Dean mused
“Yeah, yeah” Dean rolled his eyes. “Come on, let's grab the food and start. We have all weekend to watch these movies and I’ve been waiting for this moment all week”
"Hi" he croaked "I'm Castiel Novak. Call me Cas"
Practically his polar opposite was a boy named Dean Winchester. Born into this world on a chilly winter day saw his parents saddled with a veritable hell raiser. Dean was a sweet kid and a momma's boy through and through, but once out of her sight, he wreaked havoc on the neighbourhood. As a toddler he frequently ran off and couldn't sit still to save his life, as a child he stayed still only long enough to be fed before racing off to do, as his parents sighed "God-Kows-What". When he hit his teenage years he calmed slightly with the arrival of his younger brother Sam. Fiercely protective of his family, Dean was not to be crossed. If you wronged him or his brother, he would find you and you'd know about it. Impetuous, temperamental and fiercely loyal. That was Dean.
Dean laughed "There's no danger of that when you're around, Harvelle" he returned
“Yeah, I'm probably gonna be a shitty passenger. Screaming, fainting, the whole nine yards” Dean felt compelled to offer a joke. He never did well with nervousness
A bored looking attendant opened the gate and people spilled eagerly toward the train of cars. Dean shuffled up but the gate closed just ahead of the man in front of him. The guy turned round, probably to assess who he’d be riding with. The gleam in his eye made Dean groan. He would be stuck with an adrenaline junkie wouldn't he? The man frowned at Dean
“Oh there you are honey” The graceful features of Mary Winchester appeared around the door “Oh! And Cas is here too. Excellent, welcome in dear, sorry about the pandemonium. We’d be a lot more organised if someone” and here she raised her voice over her shoulder, “remembered to pack their bags last night”
"Jesus Cas, they're beautiful" Dean said and then because he was Dean Winchester "If you ever tell Sammy I said that I'll ward the Impala against you"
There was an audible thunk  as Dean let his head fall to the table
As soon as he hit solid ground Dean almost collapsed. His legs felt like jelly.
“If I’m cute, then what does that make you?” he purred “I’m leaning towards devastatingly handsome”
Cas cut him off with a shake of his head and a beleaguered sigh
"Yeah Cas. I think it does"
What Dean liked about the snow was how everything was muffled. There was a unique hush associated with it. The only sound was the crunching of his feet and the soft sizzle of freshly falling flakes. It was peaceful in a way that Dean never experienced elsewhere. Now though, a second pair of boots were crunching beside him but strangely it didn’t bother him. The good thing about Cas was that he didn’t feel the need to fill silences. Sam was always humming or sighing or chatting away but Cas was content to let a companionable silence grow, something Dean appreciated after years of cramped living quarters.
Long ago, Dean had once made the mistake of comparing angels to birds commenting that “They both have wings don’t they?”
“Bitch” he muttered under his breath
Thankfully John’s goodbye was shorter than his wife’s and soon they were disappearing out the door and their playful bickering could be heard in the driveway before the rumble of the Impala’s engine faded. Dean sagged “I mean I love my parents, but if they could be a bit less overbearing sometimes it would be great” he huffed.
A quick expression flitted across Dean's face too fast for human eyes to see. Castiel luckily, was not a human for all his appearance and caught the grin for what it was. This was why Castiel could watch the man for so long. His heart was so big that he was always feeling something. There was no end to the expressions. Cas counted 700 one night on his usual bedside vigil.
“So how was it?”
Dean was surprised to note that he was enjoying this. After a while, Cas had loosened up to his usual self, all the bluntness of earlier forgotten and he and Dean had been joking and chatting as normal.
“I did”
Castiel shook out his wings proudly and Dean laughed at the rustle.
As soon as he had done that, another T-shirt was thrown at him followed by another set of instructions.
The head retracted slightly and he saw the sight of a sheepish angel shuffling himself down the bench like a guilty child. Throwing his head back, Dean began to laugh. It just felt right. He was happy. Goddamnit he was never happy but here on this old bench in a park in the middle of nowhere faced with a shamefaced angel he was the happiest he could remember.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well Cas, I'd offer to help you if I actually knew what was happening" Dean replied.
Castiel got up off the bench with Dean's eyes eagerly to him. Personally, he didn't see the appeal in his wings, they were average really. Nothing special. He was fond of the blue highlights that occasionally shimmered in the pinions but aside from that they were simply wings. They let him fly when he needed, they kept him warm and conveyed emotions, standard wing behavior really. He walked out from under the spotted shade provided by the tree and out into the bright sunlight, then he turned to face Dean. Rolling his shoulders as he did so, Cas slowly extended his wings closing his eyes as he did so. They were stiff despite having a lot of room to move in the other dimension and letting them spread out unknotting kinks and stretching muscles was very satisfying indeed.
Dean was insulted. He wasn’t that bad at laundry thank you very much. His mama had taught him well. Where did this dude get off making such accusations?
Dean, suddenly grateful for his father’s somewhat unorthodox insistence on learning Morse as well as the phonetic alphabet, scrabbled frantically for a scrap of paper to transcribe. With a final jab, he wrote the last dot and looked at the message.
“Wrap up warm!” Sam called as Dean left the room
"I did good then?" He asked
Dean had held a torch for his friend for what felt like forever. They first met in playschool. Dean was sitting, sulking under a tree until Cas came over, sat beside him and wordlessly offered him a biscuit. From there they’d been inseparable and were known around the neighbourhood as ‘Dean-and-Cas’ Honestly, he couldn’t remember a time where he didn’t feel like this but he’d only identified what exactly the warm, fuzzy feeling was a year and a half ago.
Dean took it and offered a somewhat quiet “Dean” back. Then the gates opened.
He headed back to Jo giving her a surreptitious thumbs up and this time he felt eyes on his back, every step of the way.
"Don't I know it" Dean grumbled good-naturedly as he settled back into the sofa and closed his eyes. "Now hush. I want to nap"
It was slow going, Castiel seemed to have picked the highest tree in the immediate area and Dean wasn’t exactly a big fan of heights. ‘This is for Cas’. Every hand hold had the same refrain ‘This is for Cas, This is for Cas. This is for Cas’ until finally, finally. His hand grasped a shoe on its next reach.
Deans response was garbled at best but Jo would bet it hadn’t been complimentary at all.
Dean shuddered “Horrible. The whole thing felt like 40 years or something. How did you find it?”
Cas' hair was never neat at the best of times but out here, exposed to the wind and snow with no hat like Dean had, it was twisted and mussed into a veritable bird's nest. The dark locks were also interspersed with white dots and Dean had a sudden image of Cas aging and gaining permanent white specks. His stomach lurched at the thought.
It was Gabriel's fault, but then, if you talked to anyone who knew him, it was generally Gabriel's fault.
A suspicious glance followed by a squint and a slow nod let him know that this was a project of some importance to Cas and that he shouldn't try to mess it up if he wanted a smooth and happy future with his partner.
Dean was furious. Marching up to the door he hammered furiously on it. No reply. Knocking again got no response. "Novak!" Dean roared "Open this door you cowardly, insolent, short bast-"
Giving up, he rose to head to the bathroom which conveniently was located behind the tapping person. As he passed he snuck a glance. It was a guy apparently. Messy dark hair, tanned skin and, if the t-shirt sleeves were to be believed, not unfit either. Definitely his type in other words.
“Just because both species share similar appendages does not mean that we are in any way similar. In fact, using your logic, humans are like horses given that they both possess hair"
“I’m continuously amazed at the beauty my father created. It remains unfathomable to me that having seen what the earth has to offer, he simply turned and ran”
Cas just stood there staring. He looked for all the world, like a statue. Dean had to fight the urge to reach out and touch the still form. The silence stretched on for what had to be mere seconds although it felt like decades to Dean. Finally, Cas moved. It was just his jaw, the rest of him seemed carved from stone.
The door slam echoed into the apartment next door causing Castiel to snigger. Beside him on the bed, his friend Gabriel rolled over and burst into gales of laughter.
“What do you want Dean?”
All he got in return was a groan and a loud thump. Clenching his fists and breathing deeply, Dean tried to calm down. There was no point in him going over, the front door wouldn't have been answered. Grabbing his phone off the bed, he angrily stomped over to the door and slammed it shut. He'd crash at a friend's place.
“Uh” Castiel stuttered “I may have overheard your friend when I collected those glasses” then he seemed to recover himself and that suave, sexy demeanour came back “I couldn’t forget the name of such a pretty face” He winked.
“Oh come on dude, last call is in an hour. Nut up and just write it down, it’s ten numbers and you’re an engineering student. I refuse to believe you can’t do even that”
Dean grinned sheepishly, chagrined. "Sorry Jo he's just, ugh" he apologised and then as an afterthought added "And you'd be blessed to touch this face with your hands, let alone lips"
"Hello Dean"
Castiel rolled his eyes good-naturedly, then winked at Dean before holding out his hand “I swear they have the worst timing. Alright, hand over the digits. You’ll definitely be hearing from me”
They both saw out their teenage years in this manner. Castiel studied whenever he wasn't writing and Dean fixed up cars when he wasn't studying. Both got high grades and upon graduating, both got accepted into the same college for different courses. Unbeknownst to them, they both also got housed in the same block, in neighbouring apartments. It was the start of a horrible relationship.
"I take it that wasn't the tree then?" he asked jokingly
"I can assure you Dean that no angels party with my wings. They act as normal wings do. What gave you the idea of festivities?"
The dim light made everything seem faintly ethereal but the harsh light of the screen threw Cas’s face into sharp relief. His eyes seemed to glow. Dean’s gaze dropped momentarily to his lips before he dragged it back up, praying Cas hadn’t noticed.
Both quietly nursed the thought that perhaps, they could simply forget about their troublesome neighbour and get on with their lives. That was, until whatever tentative truce they had was shattered.
He was just passing by a bench just under the shade of a tree but with enough sun that it hit both of its inhabitants. At first, he didn't pay it any attention but as his eyes caught up with his brain, he hastily backtracked and sniggered. There, on the bench, was his big bad brother asleep on a soldier of God and probably drooling going by the dark stain on the shoulder of Cas's coat. Cas was no better looking blissed out and smiling as his head rested on Dean's.
The metaphorical fly in Dean’s ointment was Castiel Novak. A PhD student with, if you asked Dean at any rate, gorgeously fluffy hair and the most intense blue eyes he had ever seen. This was not by and large Dean’s problem. No, Dean’s problem was that he wasn’t the only one whose head had been turned by the man in question.
“Can I help?” he asked as he opened the door
Seeming to realise he’d offended Dean, the boy hastened to elaborate
Cas almost seemed to preen under the praise.
The tapping wasn’t random, it was quite rhythmic in fact, and repetitive as well. Finally it clicked. Whoever was on the other side of the wall was tapping out a message in Morse Code.
“Yes, yes Mary. I’m coming” he panted “Oh Hello Cas. You excited?”
Dean cleared his throat pulling Cas out of his musings “Anyway, nah this visit was genuinely to say thanks for putting up with all the misguided people who bother you although it might be nice to get to know each other a little better given we’re neighbours and I guess this problem won’t go away anytime soon so I’ll probably end up baking more apology pies in the future”
Dean smiled. “I’d like that”
After watching for a minute and still being none the wiser as to what was going on, Dean decided that perhaps announcing his presence would get him answers.
"...He's really annoying, and he wouldn't shut up today, it was obnoxious and he always has a stick up his ass whenever I do anything it's always thump thump thump on the wall and some prissy comment about studying. Ugh Jo. He's infuriating and I'm going to go over there and -"
A flicker of sadness momentarily passed over Jo’s face followed by a shaky smile “Yeah she would be, and she’d be disappointed it took you this long to ask a guy out. Where’s your confidence Winchester?”
Dean bolted upright, one hand reaching for his gun instinctively while his head turned to the source of the voice. Beside him on the previously unoccupied bench was Castiel looking as stoic as normal.
Castiel blinked and was that a swallow Dean saw? Oh, Jo was so right. She’d never shut up about this. Time to press his advantage. Stealing Castiel’s own trick from earlier, Dean licked his lips and leaned in a little further.
As Dean studied the angel at his side something became apparent. The next gust of wind blew a large flurry into the air and behind Cas, briefly, so briefly that Dean almost didn't see it, an outline of wings appeared.
Castiel sighed loudly. His neighbour was blaring music again. Don’t get him wrong, Cas didn’t necessarily hate the music, despite his rather librarian-ish appearance, he did, on occasion, enjoy a good bit of classic rock. But he was trying to study for a big theology test coming up and the music had been incessant for weeks now. Fisting his hands in his messy hair he rose and banged on the wall next to his headboard
As Cas had already admitted to himself, he may or may not be harbouring a crush on his neighbour despite mostly communicating through waves and short conversations when they bumped into each-other but he never suspected that the witch may have some feelings of his own. Unless, his logical brain insisted, it was just friendly and Dean was just shy. Hmm, this clearly warranted further investigation.
Dean stood in the line cursing his brother. He turned around to glare at him and received  a sunny smile in return.
“Sorry” Dean apologised “I just didn’t want you to think badly of me” then he cleared his throat hastily and continued “I didn't know your brother was a witch though? What’s his specialty? Or is he more of a general practitioner”
“Hey Cas” he greeted, raising a hand as he did so.
“So, tea” he offered “I have many kinds, what’s your preference?”
Again, don't own and never will
Despite their huge difference in personalities, these boys had a few traits in common. Both loved their families, both were highly intelligent and both were terrified of never meeting their soul mate. Dean dreamed of a white picket fence, 1.5 kids and a dog while Cas dreamed of a comfortable house, family dinners and perhaps a cat. Neither wanted to be alone. These fears were never uttered by either. They were kept inside and quietly worried over in the depths of night.
Hoodie and jeans discarded, Cas picked his way carefully into the centre and settled down. Dean watched bemused until he was beckoned over by a quick hand movement from Cas.
"Just desserts dude" he sighed happily "Is there anything better?"
A loud thud had Dean’s head rising from his books but the moan that followed had it falling again. He let out a groan himself. When he moved into his dorm  this year, he was sure he’d gotten lucky. Two writers had to be quiet enough right? Wrong. Now, months later and Dean was seriously reconsidering his stance on living at home. Driving for three hours would surely be  better than having to listen to the copious amounts of sex his roommates had
“I can’t believe your parents were willing to let me stay the whole weekend” Cas said
As rooms went, this was a good one. It was considerably warmer than the rest of the building and hopefully the humming of the machines would inspire him to study.  It was a long shot but he was desperate.He made his way in and decided to take a seat on one of the dryers at the back. Hopping up, he scooted back and settled in to read.
“Uh, sorry about that” he said sheepishly “I just saw the house and then saw you and, well I just assumed”
“I’m not the witch”
Life was different in the bunker. Before, Dean had dreaded snowy days. It meant blue fingers, red noses and a frustrated John Winchester. Hours were spent cooped up in third rate motels trying to entertain Sammy quietly in case they disturbed their father’s research. More often than not, they ended up huddled up together under whatever blankets they could find shivering. The one high point was when Dean would whisper stories to Sam. Stories about angels watching over them, stories about knights and dragons. Pretty much any story that came to mind really.
It was an accepted fact that one did not see colour until they met their soul mate Until then they lived their lives completely iin monochrome. Some people met their soul mate when they started school, others met them in the new neighbour and some just lived in black and white forever. There was no guarantee that you'd ever see in colour.
“Yup” Dean confirmed with a shudder “Like every few weeks they’ll have these awful sex marathons or something. I usually keep an eye on the Powerade levels but this week I forgot and found out the hard way”
“D-do you really mean that? Dean I screwed up so much, I teamed up with the King of Hell behind your back, I was cast out from heaven, do you really mean all of that? I’m a failure of an angel and a disgrace to my Father”
Now, Dean alternated between moodily tracing designs in the spilled drink and staring over at the bar until Jo slapped him on the back of the head and proclaimed that he would either liven up or so help me Dean, everyone in this bar will know about Rhonda Hurley, I swear to god.
Castiel chuckled “As you wish”
“He checked you out, Dean. Are you honestly telling me you didn't notice? I always get served faster when I’m with you than when I’m with anyone else”
“Hey” Dean said again and then immediately kicked himself “Uh, that is to say - how do you know my name actually?”
“This is why I have faith in you and your brother Dean. When I saw your soul, I saw the potential. You have so much in you to give and can achieve so much when you rely on your friends and family. I am immensely sad to be apart from that group but I hope you know that despite your opinion on me, I am willing to lend whatever aid I can”
“End me”
“Yeah, adrenaline does that to a person”
Dean patted his shoulder. “Well I’m glad one of us liked it man. And, uh thanks for not letting go, my hand I mean”
“Really?” Dean asked, eyes lighting up. “I just had a hunch so I acted on it, I’m very glad it worked out”
The man stared skeptically across the road but then seemed to realise that Cas probably did know if he was a witch and rubbed the back of his neck
The music was loud, Dean mused as he perched on a high stool in the corner. The college bar was as crowded as it ever got on a Thursday night and he had his best friend Jo sitting beside him. It had, he had to admit, all the makings of a good night. In fact, if it weren’t for a certain shock of black hair behind the bar, it would be a great one.
“That’s really cool, Cas” Dean said “I hope my humble pie can live up to the high standards you’re used to”
“Well if you’re sure” Mary insisted “I guess we better leave you boys to it before we miss our train” At this last remark, she called over her shoulder again and a flustered John Winchester came into view dragging a suitcase behind him
“Putting some of those witchy powers to use?” Cas teased
“Nah dude, just thinking”
"I like the sun" Castiel decided sounding very relaxed "I always thought it was nothing special, just a ball of constantly combusting gas like the billions of others out there but it's really quite pleasant"
Shaking his head again, Cas watched as the man entered the gate and went up the charmingly flowered path. Dean was a stickler for his garden. The man himself appeared just as the man looking for the potion arrived at his door and Cas would be lying if he said he didn’t get enjoyment out of the little jump he did. Sure the villagers meant no harm and the first few times it had happened it was amusing. By the tenth time it was decidedly not so. Dean had evidently caught sight of Cas because he raised his hand in a wave. Cas returned it and the apologetic grimace that went with it before heading back to his greenhouse. He had some re-potting to do.
Dean rolled his eyes good-naturedly and headed further in “What do you want Mom?” He called back
“That would be nice” laughed Cas “But I fear if you bake a pie for everyone who knocks on my door you’d never leave the kitchen
It was into this world that Castiel Novak was born, on a stunning Autumn day. Not that he noticed of course. Castiel had the same mysterious ailment as everyone else. His world was black and white.
“You’re smitten dude. Absolutely as smitten as a kitten and it’s like watching a kitten swim, adorable but slightly pathetic and also very funny”
"Hi" he breathed "I'm Dean Winchester. I don't believe we've met"
Dean sighed. “You’re right Cas. It was shitty. I had a choice and I made what seemed like the right one at the time. I stand by it, in this life if you look back too often, you forget how to move forward. I made a choice and I accept that. I was wrong. I should never have done that to you”
As they walked, a slight breeze blew up making Dean shiver slightly. He glanced sideways at Cas who seemed unaffected, though in fairness, Cas generally seemed unaffected by most stimuli. It was just who he was.
Seeing Cas tilt his head in confusion made guilt clench at Dean's insides. He had to admit that he was curious, it was hard not to be after the whole Multidimensional Wavelength speech Cas just gave, but still, he thought he'd have more control over his response. He had a sudden urge to see the wings. Despite never having given it much thought before, he was insanely interested now. After Cas telling him that he might be able to see an outline of them he had a brief internal war where half of him felt guilty for invading Cas's privacy and the other half didn't give a rats ass. Unfortunately though, the rats ass side won and Dean had asked. What if showing wings was an intensely personal thing for angels? What if he had basically asked if he could see Cas naked?
The guy looked up “Uh, no thanks, unless you want to prolong this wash”
Cas pulled back slightly and opened those blue, blue eyes that Dean had loved for so long. Then he blushed “Is this okay?” he whispered as though anything louder would shatter the moment
“Well” Dean began, clearly trying to come across as nonchalant. “I could come around at least once a week with a pie for starters? I’m always trying out recipes with my garden. I doubt they’ll be as fancy as your brothers but I’ve been reliably told I bake a mean pie crust” he winked.
“Alright, alright” Dean mumbled “But I want it on record that this is under duress”
"I do believe the things you are seeing are my wings" he delivered in a calm, matter of fact voice that had Dean nodding along before he realized what exactly he had just been told.
The thought was halted mid word by the relocation of Dean's eyes to him. Gabriel shifted uneasily. Dean's eyes flicked back up to Castiel, then back down again. Then he slowly held out his hand to the taller of the two.
Eventually, after far too long in Dean’s opinion, the cart slowed down and rolled back into the station.
No, no, no this was not right. How could Cas think these things? Dean halted in his tracks and Cas spun to see him
The rest of the evening followed in a similar fashion with Cas handing him materials, but over time the instructions grew vaguer and sparser until Dean was allowed to put them anywhere he wanted.
Dean cast his eyes down, that last statement had been a mistake borne of high emotions. He had never planned to reveal that. He looked up, intent on denying it or passing it off but one glance at those piercing eyes stayed his tongue. Cas had seen him, Cas had seen his bloodied and tarnished soul in hell but still deemed him worthy of saving, and sure it was a mandated order at the time but Cas had stuck around. He’d not only talked the talk, but walked the walk. He’d showed over and over that he’d seen Dean and stayed anyway. Here was the being who knew him the most, even more than Sammy did.
Castiel was indeed 'watching humanity', one human in particular to be exact.
A single blue-eyed glare gave him all the confirmation he needed. It was a nest. Hah! Dean was totally right.
“It took me a great many years Cas. It took solitude and a serious drinking problem before I figured out that I could remember but not let it consume me. I feel the pain I caused. I remember it and by remembering it I honour the memory of those I wronged. You can’t let this engulf you. I’m not going to lie man. It will be tough; it will never get easier but it will get more bearable and you have me, Sam and Kevin here for you too. We’ve all faced hardships, none the same, we all have our demons and we can all help each other. There is nothing wrong with solitude Cas, but don’t rely on it. Isolation is never as helpful as it appears to be”
Sneaking another glance, Dean saw that as the wind had picked up, the outline of Cas’s wings became more defined against the falling snow. He racked his brains for that moment, what felt like so many years ago where they had been relaxing on that park bench in the sun and Cas had said that his wings only became visible in the presence of natural forces. That day it had been sunlight but that distant night way back when, in the barn where it all began, it had been lightning.
He tried to unobtrusively observe the person but gave up when the girl next to him shot a weirded out look.
“Well if your other pies are half as good as this one, that would be more than acceptable” Cas smiled, turning to meet Dean’s eyes.
Dean carefully made his way over to the bed but stopped before climbing on. Immediately a T-shirt was thrown at him followed by "put it between the pillow with the blue lines and the pillow with the spots but don't dislodge them"
The next day, Dean was grimacing into the pillow. He had had a busy day and wanted a nap before having to go to work in the evening but his stupid neighbour was making it impossible. C. Novak, the man in question, apparently had company over and was definitely not keeping it quiet. A particularly loud exclamation had him rolling of the bed, angrily striding over to the wall and banging on it.
"You can't see me but I'm holding up my middle finger, jerk. If you don't like it, get out!" his neighbour yelled back
“No worries!” Dean said “I’m guessing you say that enough each day that it’s autopilot now right?”
“Alright, alright” the beleaguered voice of one John Winchester could be heard “I should have done it but that’s no help now”
“Right” Cas agreed “Well as it happens, apple is one of my favourite so you’re in luck”
Apparently, Dean's voyeuristic presence had begun to grate on Cas' nerves as it wasn't long before he was graced with a curt "Are you going to stand there uselessly or are you going to help?"
