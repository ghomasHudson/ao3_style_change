“You’d be an angel,” Castiel said, trying to make Anna laugh again. Trying not to panic as the light started fading from her eyes. “Anna?”
“And I’ve asked more persuasively,” added Cordy. Jess side-eyed her. “Wearing a shirt that’s a size too small is so uncomfortable, but can be so worth it.”
“Right,” says Jody. She clears her throat a little uncomfortably, but waits patiently until Dean shoots her a glance to raise an eyebrow. Something in Dean’s face relaxes then, and he just shrugs back at her. Whatever meaning there is in this interaction is lost on Cas, but he’s glad it seems to work. That whatever emotion was drowning Dean a few moments ago seems to have lifted mostly. “The door locks, just so you know.”
“It was selfish of me really,” Selma said, standing up and offering a hand to help Castiel up from his chair too. “I thought it would be nice to have someone around that doesn’t make fun of me for praying five times a day. I know they don’t mean to say my faith is a waste of time, but…”
The long ascent down the fourteen flights of stairs from the top of Naomi’s building to the street gave Castiel plenty of time to try to figure out exactly what the plan might be. He devised a dozen schemes that might just work in his head, though he felt confidence in exactly none of them. Still, even his most far fetched idea was not a direct attack.
Jo had a look on her face that Castiel had seen all too often in the mirror. And he knew from experience how awful it felt to be suddenly alone and forced to live with one’s thoughts. He didn’t wish it on anyone.
“I’m kidding. No, I am not engaged to Dean. That would be an idiotic move on his part,” said Castiel. “I’m a spy, and everyone from Naomi to the lowest ranked soldiers knows that I no longer work for the state. I am useless to him, and to the resistance in general. So if we are done with the interrogation, I was planning on sitting here and contemplating my growing sense of existential dread and I would like do so in quiet.”
“Read another book,” says Billie with a snort. “I’m giving you a choice. Or would you prefer it was the way it was before? You wanna be God, but you want someone else giving the orders so you don’t have to deal with the consequences. No wonder you think this is paradise.”
Dean can’t finish his sentence. And Cas is still just standing there, like a rubber band ready to snap. Can’t he see that Dean wants him to? Is he really going to make him say it?
“Not the point,” Dean said, smoothly avoiding the topic. “The point is, I figured it would make them very uncomfortable to shoot supposedly unarmed and incapacitated people. They would if ordered, but they would hesitate. From there, all I had to do was plant the idea in their head that we were an invading force and the people who lived here were innocent. People weren’t so keen to do anything that would damage civilian property after that, and they instead tried to chase our people down, because we were up and moving and seemingly unaffected by Sweet Dreams. We kidnapped ten of them from different garrisons, and, well, you know the rest.”
The garden Castiel had grown used to was gone, replaced by a blackness so complete he found it folding in on him. A feeling of claustrophobic smallness took over him as he contemplated the abyss and it was a relief when he saw Anna rise from the inky blackness. Her lips were blue and her hair frayed and partly missing. Her skin sagged and her wounds were worn matter of factly.
He doesn’t even question Jenny, who he didn’t fucking remember anyway. Dean does though. Then again, Dean’s always been good at names and faces. At remembering people. And after that brief trip down memory lane, it’s fighting. And it’s easy to fall into the familiar rhythm of that. The desperation of a life or death situation in which he and his brother are outnumbered but claw their way to the upperhand.
“She’s smarter than I am,” Castiel said, hesitating a moment before continuing. “She was waiting for me to stare her down. Attempt to puzzle her out. If I didn’t try that, it meant that I didn’t need to.”
“What are you seeing?” Dr. Newman asked curiously. He’d likely observed the way Castiel’s eyes had flicked to the side of him. “Most everyone I’ve gotten it out of say people they love dead.”
“And he’s so sure of himself, and undamaged,” Cas said. “Not untouched by tragedy, no one is, but… I envy him. He wants to be like me, and he doesn’t understand that is the last thing he should want.”
Billie doesn’t even look up from what she’s reading. Reaperman, Dean reads from the cover. Billie flips the page. He can’t tell if she’s ignoring him or she doesn’t know he’s here. He finds the first option the more believable.
The question rubbed Castiel entirely the wrong way, and he welcomed the flood of irritation in place of the awkwardness he had been trying not to think about since Dean had dragged him off in the first place.
“I’m not in a good place. I am self aware enough to admit that,” Castiel said, deciding that was a good place to start. “Some days I don’t even know if I’m still sane. But the last thing I want is more agency taken away from me.”
“Yeah, well,” Dean says, because he has nothing to say. “Get settled in. Mom made pasta for dinner. She can’t cook, so eat literally anything else.”
She sounded positively livid now and Castiel was now very curious about what exactly was in the reports she had been given.
Sam is real. Dean knows he is, but he doesn’t say anything. Maybe if he ignores him Sam will go away. Find some other corner of his mind to get lost in.
“I know,” Jack said. He sat down on one of the piles of rubble, and Castiel realized with a start that they had finishes clearing the roadway. Balthazar, Remiel, and Hael were busy playing an old bonding game Anna had taught them all. Cas smiled as he watched them. “Everyone trusts you.”
“I think you’ll find sarcasm is not something I tolerate,” said Mortimer blandly. “Deflection is the most irritating form of lying. And I don’t need dear Pamela here to tell me that you are not a good liar.”
Or he could lie. Samandriel felt guilty over Anna’s death, likely as guilty as Castiel did. He had put together what had happened much more effectively than Castiel had, and had decided what side he wanted to be on. But that also meant he had decided to join the side that he would most likely die on. Even if they weren’t caught immediately, and Castiel already had such low hopes for his own escape that adding another variable to it made the odds vanishingly small, Samandriel would be as much a target as Castiel was when Naomi realized what had happened.
He has to pull over a couple of times. He doesn’t cry, he doesn’t do anything. He just sits there for a few minutes and wills himself to keep driving. And then, miracle of miracles, he does. Sam and Jack are waiting on him. This is how it ends, he guesses. Because it sure does look like everyone else is gone. Everything that made the world worth saving, just… gone.
Perhaps he had started saying these sorts of things out loud, because someone was talking. Whatever Cas had said, it prompted Dean to hug him. At first Cas could feel himself tense up before his drunken brain decided that this was fine.
“Oh God, no. Not that he isn’t nice about it, but after a certain point it feels like the people he sleeps with are just, well, another notch on the bedpost,” said Jo. “I have a hard enough time convincing people I’m credible. The last thing I want is someone saying I slept my way to the top.”
“Do you really want to test that knowing what happened in Libidine?” Dean asked. “Because the way I see it, we don’t have much to lose if you’re not going to work with us. Having Naomi as an ally is a powerful thing, considering she’s the one who controls a pretty large part of your military force right now.”
“Still alive,” confirmed Castiel. “And I’d also like to sleep, so if you know where we’ll be staying…”
“Crowley’s not- He got out. He’s like a cockroach, he’s fine,” said Dean. “And even if he didn’t, not like I would care anyway.”
“Wherever you want to go, Jack, I’ll find some way to make it happen,” says Cas. “But I thought… It might be good for you to be near people closer to you in age, who can understand a little of what you’ve been through. Like Claire and Patience.”
“I’ve heard that one,” he said. And then he nodded towards the door. “Get some sleep Dean. It will all be worse in the morning.”
When Castiel woke up, the first thing he registered was just how muted the pain had become. He leaned up and lifted the blanket that covered him and then the medical gown they had dressed him in to look at the wound and see that it was hardly there anymore. New skin grew over it, angry and pink. He traced his thumb over it, idly.
“Benny tells me you were really impressed when I punched you in the face that one time,” said Cas helpfully, as Dean pushed up his shirt and kissed his chest. He rolled his eyes as he felt the beginnings of a hickey form under Dean’s lips. “Stop that.”
“The way I hear it,” Gadreel said. “You knew nothing, and you still didn’t shoot her when you were supposed to.”
“Cas, I know for a fact you know how to take a hint,” said Risa. Cas stopped asking questions, and Dean threw a grateful glance Risa’s direction. “Alright, congrats to the happy couple. What’s the strategy we’re going for in terms of winning him over?”
There were no close encounters on the way into Sanctus, though it take a while to safely make his way through the groups of soldiers that were roving the edges of the town. Luckily, Castiel had a good sense of when and where they would be looking, and where there blind spots might be. He made it to Sanctus within a few hours of leaving Risa.
Neither of them notice, at first, that the room is darkening around them. There is an unmistakable surge of power that cuts through their argument, and Cas and Billie turn in unison to look towards Jack, only to find it is Amara staring back at them. Jack is nowhere to be seen, and Cas starts to get an uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach.
Besides, it also gave Eileen an excuse to get a breather after Sam almost died. It was nice to gain a little perspective on the past few days without distraction. Dean’s good for a companionable few hours in the car without needing to bother her much.
“Alive,” says Dean. And because he’s put it together, because he can’t help but state the obvious, he swallows hard and adds: “It’s you. It’s really you.”
“You got it,” Dean said with a nod. Charlie walked off, and Castiel made to follow her but was stopped by a hand on his shoulder. “Nope. You’re coming with me to see Dr. Newman and make sure you’re leg isn’t infected and that you’ve got a decent set of painkillers.”
“God, why do you have to make everything so god damned difficult,” muttered Dean. “I’m fine, okay? I’m fucking fine, and you’re the one who needs to sort out how the fuck you actually feel.”
“Ah yes. The entire world of which the State makes up a fraction. And for any of this to work, you need more men,” said Castiel bluntly. “For the multiplying part.”
“I think you need to move your timeline up,” said Gabriel. “You leave it another day, I’m not sure you’ll be able to drive in.”
“Don’t have to tell me twice,” says Claire. She sticks the keys in the ignition and guns it out of the gas station, probably upsetting the cars she speeds past to get back on the highway. Oh well, they need to move. Besides, the sooner they get there and stop whatever it is that’s supposed to happen, the sooner Claire can go home and curl up next to Kaia as she studies. Listen to Kaia singing nursery rhymes under her breath and tap along to the melodies against Kaia’s thigh with her fingers.
Castiel continued being annoyed about having to cater to some asshole’s ego for a few more seconds before this statement hit him.
But right now, there is only an unguarded vulnerability in his expression. It’s something Cas has seen before. It’s a part of Dean that Cas has always been trusted with, even when he shouldn’t have been. Neither of them speaks for a few moments, both of them simply taking each other in and deciding where exactly they’re going to go from here.
“The family thing isn’t easy,” Charlie agreed. “Nora gets along with Dr. Newman’s kid, though right?”
Except, when Cas tries to retreat from Dean’s bedside, he finds that Dean has caught his wrist, keeping his hand pressed to his chest.
“I don’t think you were scared of me wanting you,” Anna said, touching a hand to one of his cheeks. “You were scared because you wanted me. I think you still want me, in the biblical sense.”
Castiel trailed off, realizing he’d already fumbled this mission behind repair. Jo was sharp enough to pick up on the hesitation, and her eyes fell to the rubbed raw circles on his wrists before he could withdraw and hide his arms.
Jo walked closer. Cas pictured her in his mind and could imagine the way she would glance at Cas to make sure he was still asleep before saying what she said next.
“That’s not your job,” pointed out Corbett. “And I’m getting better, Maggie. Ed and Harry would want us to carry on the fight.”
Dean blinked and then turned around and retrieved the book of poems. The second it was in Cas’ hands, he slammed the door shut again.
“I’m not an idiot, Winchester,” Zachariah huffed. He glanced at Castiel again. “What about Naomi’s puppet?”
“And instead of getting to Heaven, at last— I’m going all along,” said Anna as the light faded from her eyes. “You can’t waste your days waiting for redemption, Cas. That’s a path you have to follow yourself.”
“My dad got it for me when Emma and I turned eighteen. I’ve been saving it,” she said. Jo and Dean had decided it was best to tell their children they were twins than to attempt to explain Claire’s parentage. Claire’s actual birthday would be a matter of philosophical discussion considering she wasn’t born, and was instead plucked from the Earth after being fed a diet of blood and starlight during her gestation. And perhaps she was born again when she was taken from one world to the next. “He got one for Emma, too.”
“Our leader, the prophet,” she said, her hand resting on her stomach for a moment. “I think you’ll like him.”
Not so luckily for Castiel, Risa had suspected something like this would happen and had sweet talked a spare uniform off of Pamela before they’d left. She thrust it at Castiel when he had made the idiotic decision of asking exactly how they were going to get in. Along with the uniform he’d been handed a message which he’d been strictly ordered not to read, and to only give to Ellen, Bobby, or Jody.
As far as Claire is concerned that doesn’t make any sense. From the look on Dean’s face, however, Cas has already explained this to him and Dean thinks the answer is good enough as to why Cas won’t heal him. Trying to get a better answer than that is like trying to pull teeth, anyway, so Claire gives up after a while and goes on to rib Dean for for showing up for a hunt with a broken fucking leg. Of course, that just means Dean ribs her for letting her phone get stolen by a fucking crocotta. And all that devolves into an argument about who exactly is the damsel in distress in this whole scenario. The entire time, Cas just stands by silently, and Claire can feel an awkward stiltedness to him. But whenever she tries to include him in the conversation, he keeps his answers brief.
“In my experience, I’m fine is just a socially acceptable way of saying I don’t feel like talking about it,” Jo pointed out. Castiel supposed that was true, but in the end it didn’t matter whether or not he was fine. If he was doing his job, then he was doing the right thing. He just had to remember that.
“That’s kinda the point,” said Dean, forking over a good hundred dollars in hard earned (hard-swindled) cash. This at least got the guy behind the counter to stop glaring at them. Dean didn’t miss the money like he might have on any other night. What was he gonna do with it? Like Cas had said, it was tomorrow already. The day Sam died. The day Dean let Sam die, and did nothing to stop it. On purpose. “Well, sorta. It’s also about fatherhood or something.”
“I keep to my agreements, as you well know,” Naomi said. “We’ve done this before, Kali. If I remember correctly, you got too fond of one of your spies. You certainly paid a hefty price for Gabriel when we caught him.”
“I didn’t lose,” Selma said, narrowing her eyes suspiciously. Castiel smiled at her, putting his hands up in surrender.
“Obviously not. Maybe I’m dumb too,” he said with a sigh. “But I’m not naive, and that makes a difference. I know how this is all gonna end, and it’s going to be a shitstorm. And if I was smart I know I’d keep my head out of all of it. And I tried for the longest time.”
Claire silently stands up from where she’s been eavesdropping. She feels numb. She feels dangerous. She feels the way she used to feel when Randy told her he didn’t have the money to feed her that month and she needed to stay at whatever fucking foster family she’d been dumped off at. She feels the way she felt when she saw the rift close between her and Kaia’s dying body. She feels the way she felt when she looked down at her father, someone else’s voice speaking the last words he would ever hear from her.
Dean expected Cas to say it would just be more of the same. Or that the world would go on, and maybe need them a little less. He didn’t say either of those things. Instead he ate another spoonful of cereal. He didn’t look as if he was enjoying it, Dean thought to himself. But he ate it anyway, as if it were enough that if only his taste buds were a little more human he could be enjoying it.
“I can see that,” said Meg, and Cas believed her. Whatever notions she’d had of him had been altered by the reality of who he was. She was practical that way. It didn’t change the fact that other people still believed in this version of him she spoke about. In his ability to defy the State and not only live to tell the tale, but live well. At least from an outsider’s perspective. He had unwittingly become a symbol of what life after the State could look like. Something to point to for people who needed a new sense of purpose, and a new source of bravery. “But being a pawn doesn’t mean you’re not a player. And there’s more than one way to win at chess. War strategy isn’t a matter of numbers, Cas. And I know a strategist when I see one.”
“Don’t,” Castiel said, realizing everyone was listening to him now. Great. “So I started looking for a girl I knew to be resistance. Her name was Jo.”
“That should go away,” he said flatly, looking back at his notes. “We think you’ve been exposed to the drug before each time you met with Naomi. The nightmares were your subconscious trying to let you know something was wrong.”
That made her pause. She put her knife away and crossed her arms while looking him up and down. Whatever she saw seemed to make up her mind. When Kali shoved down two drinks on their table, Jo handed over her money without another word and then drained her glass quickly. Castiel hesitantly copied her.
When he barged into Jo’s cabin demanding she cut his hair, he ignored the worried look she gave him, or the fact that Charlie was there too with Crookshanks in tow. The cat rubbed itself affectionately against Cas’ legs, and Cas felt a lump build in the back of his throat. Jo agreed after a few minutes of Cas offering a series of more useless excuses, seeming to realize she wasn’t going to get a real answer out of him. So she sat him down on a chair, and sent Charlie out to get the scissors from Risa.
He thinks she’s gonna say something else. Something cutting. He kinda hopes she does, thinks maybe it will make him feel better. To know what awful names he should be calling himself, to know just how he fucked it up so badly this time, to have somewhere to start with what happened in that dungeon with Death at the door and the feeling of familiar relief when Cas said he knew how to get Dean out. That bone deep memory of Cas as something bigger than himself, someone he could rely on wholly without worry. And even if it hadn’t been true for a long while, it never stopped feeling true. And then the panic when Cas had said all he had to give was his life in exchange, and why not? Not like it was worth something. Not to Cas.
“I wrote up my report,” Castiel said, placing it on Naomi’s desk. “Would you like me to discuss it in front of-“
“Yes,” says Billie, cutting Rowena off. The one word held so much malice, Rowena felt a sliver of fear before she remembered what she was. What she had become. So she squared her shoulders and met Billie’s eyes with all the steady determination of a woman who had crowned herself Queen of Hell.
Of course, then Dean had offered to let Balthazar come along if Cas quit “bitching about the Jack thing.” Cas had accepted this offer, but that didn’t mean he felt good about it. The only reason Jack had been invited along is that he looked young enough to pass for fourteen or fifteen instead of his actual seventeen years, and that meant he was a more sympathetic refugee than Castiel or any other member of his garrison was. Jason, who had been traveling in the car with Dean, was invited along for similar reasons (though at twenty five he wouldn’t pass for much younger than eighteen, and only then if he remembered to shave every day).
“If I were you, I wouldn’t tell someone with the power to blow your camp to smithereens that he’s not gonna like what you say.”
Castiel hadn’t thought of Ishim in a long time. He didn’t like to, nor did anyone in his garrison mention him after his execution.
“He liked setting fires,” says Dean. “Couldn’t help it. There was something fucked up in his head. Almost burned our own house down a couple of times. I was still angry when he left us, even though I knew he did because he didn’t want to hurt us or Mom.”
“Believe it or not,” says Billie. “I’m interested in coming to an agreement. You see, I remembered that I have something you want.”
When Dean woke up in the hospital after the vamp case, he was asked by the nurse tending to him if he was a victim of trafficking. Which was definitely a way to knock him out of the haze of pain medication he’d been lost in. The first thing that went through Dean’s head was how he’d supplemented his funds in his early twenties when credit card scams weren’t cutting it and he’d been left to his own devices, and that he’s pretty sure the kind of thing he’d been up to didn’t count, and how would they know about that anyway? The second thing that went through his head was that he was pretty sure he’d just had a near death experience, emphasis on the near. The third thing, and the thing that actually came out of his mouth was: “What the fuck are you talking about?”
“Alright, settle down. You guys can laugh at my expense later,” said Dean, quieting everyone with a wave of his hands, making it clear he had actual business he meant to deal with. “So Benny, I had Charlie looking into just what kind of bullshit Zachariah could pull when they go after Bobby’s people and I think we’re going to need the twins.”
“Yeah, we had to tell them. You’re not exactly subtle and state training has its tells. Them knowing is mostly for your safety. Soldiers don’t… they almost never defect. You know that.”
“Something, or someone,” says Amara casually, looking between Dean, Cas, and Claire. “Gave Jack what he needed.”
“Billie split us,” says Amara, but she corrects herself a moment later. “Well, no. We split ourselves, she just… introduced conflict. I wanted creation and destruction to coexist, a single force. But Jack and I were too different, wanted different things.”
“Yeah. They did,” Claire said, her voice barely above a whisper now. She was shaking a little, Cas realized.  “I had to tell them everything I knew when I was- They made me. If I’d been anyone else they would have killed me, Cas. But I was James Novak’s daughter, so they couldn’t.”
“Intelligence informs us that you-“ the woman broke off uncertainly, obviously thrown by Castiel’s conviction that no one would be coming to even attempt to save him. “Naomi is under the impression- We know you’ve entered an engagement with Mary Winchester’s son.”
“Understood,” Castiel said. “Though I have to say the more everyone threatens to kill me and doesn’t go through with it, the less effective it is.”
He tossed the device he had been planning to use to find Amara Novak to Tracy. She caught it on instinct and looked down at it.
“We’ve still got a chance at winning,” Castiel said, meant as a reassurance. Dean nodded at him, his own grip tightening further.
Castiel lifted the gun again and shot her between the eyes. The wind whistled through the tree Anna lay under, still and silent and dead.
“Who invited her again?” Claire asked, sounding annoyed. Cas wasn’t sure whether or not to be relieved that she seemed to be very much in his corner. She looked at both Meg and Charlie with skepticism and suspicion, and had positioned herself in a way where she and Castiel could easily escape, if they wished. It was almost touching, especially considering just how livid she had been with him mere hours before.
“It’s called a waiting room,” says Billie. “Anubis will be here soon. After he runs the numbers and decides if you’ve been good or bad this lifetime. How are you liking the odds, Dean?”
But if he were being vain, Dean might have said he had always been good at kissing. Because it was a conversation, but not one that made you say the hard parts. Because it was a way to listen to someone else, and hear everything they weren’t willing to say out loud. Because it was too little and too much of another person. Because it felt nice in a primal way, one that did not take into account complicated realities.
Dean’s body is not quite solid anymore when Billie arrives. Cas cannot feel what is wrong (though a quiet part of him tells him he should be able to), but if he had to hazard a guess he might say that Dean Winchester’s internal organs were half liquefied. It is far beyond the help of any kind of human intervention and most forms of supernatural intervention too. It strikes him, dully, that perhaps he should be afraid that Billie is here. That she might be taking Dean from him, and he has no power left to stop her. That this is her gloating. Somehow he isn’t afraid, though. This isn’t how it ends, he thinks to himself. It can’t be.
“So I got to Charlie in time,” Castiel said firmly. He pushed down the guilt at knowing that Charlie might be in grave danger, because Jo didn’t need to know that at the moment. “And everything was fine.”
And that’s about all he has left. His vision starts greying at the edges, and something seems to come loose inside him that shouldn’t be. Not the kind of thing you come back from, especially when shortcuts are all kinds of off the table. He’s a dead man only just short of the dead part.
“They’ve been surveilling all pathways into Guttur. They know what’s ahead of us better than we do. If we cooperate with their plans, it suits them to make sure we win over Superbia. The best method to win over Superbia is to gather the forces we need.”
“You wouldn’t happen to have been the little bird in her ear?” asked Crowley. “She did mention having eyes on Winchesters Dumb and Dumber. She also thought to call me up to let me know I might save on supplies if an assassination plan of hers were to work.”
“You betrayed us. You lied to me,” Castiel said, forcing himself not to look at her. “How could you lie to me?”
“For yelling at him in front of everyone?” says Claire. “I mean, welcome to the club. But I had a way more legitimate bone to pick.”
“God gives me hope and strength,” Castiel said at last. “My actions are my own, and my guilt is my own. My best life would be one where I limit pain for as many as possible as well as I possibly can.”
“I don’t want to die,” Castiel told her, and was surprised to find he meant it. The words came out shallow, as though they were wrenched from a part of him only newly resurrected. Naomi too seemed to realize just what it might have taken Castiel to say them.
“And if they don’t?” Benny asked. Castiel shook his head. Benny muttered grimly to himself before he saw more people in need of help, and knelt beside Carl, one of the men that was under his command. Castiel was satisfied that Benny would take care of everyone in the immediate vicinity and went off to continue helping everyone he could.
“Listen to me,” said Cas, deciding to take his advantage while he had it. “Dean was sent here with a small troop to find out why Libidine lost contact with the rest of the Resistance and ask for help toppling Superbia. We didn’t expect to find what we did, or to learn that most of the Resistance here was being kept in prison. Dean let himself be captured so Charlie Bradbury and I could organize an escape for all of you. He planned to help from the inside, but whatever intel he was working off of was clearly wrong. Now help me find him, goddamnit, or I will make you regret choosing not to for the rest of your lives.”
“Hannah, I would never ask that of you,” said Cas reaching forward and letting out a sigh as Hannah flinched away from him. “I just… when the fighting starts, all you have to do is surrender. Refuse to fight.”
“I missed you, too, Kali,” said Gabriel brightly. The shadow of a smile flickered on her face before she sighed and addressed Castiel himself.
Castiel was saved having to comment on this when a dove hopped down from the branches of the tree onto Anna’s shoulder. Then it started up singing again, and Cas reached up for it, surprised when it pecked at his finger. It didn’t hurt but when he drew his hand back it was bleeding and suddenly—
“Yeah, sure they don’t. Everything’s rainbows and sunshine. You’ve got your shit together, and Charlie and I are going to work things out some day, and Azazel’s brain is still inside his skull,” said Jo. “I could go all day. Want to hear more lies, Cas?”
“Sam, I’m just… waiting for it all to go bad again,” says Dean. “Jack almost exploding is the most normal thing that’s happened since before God left the building. And… and that thing Chuck said about loose threads. How much is out there that wants me dead or wants the people I love dead because of what I did to them, huh? The writing’s been on the wall for a long time, and I’m just… I’m just waiting for the story to end.”
“Don’t tear his stitches,” Ellen warned sharply. She too walked into the room, and Castiel noticed her and Dean exchange a glance. “I’m glad to see you got out safe. Bobby will be glad to hear it. He likes hearing about when our people win.”
But before he can say another word, someone clears their throat behind him. Whip fast, all of Jack’s attention goes to Claire, and the weight of his stare alone seems to drain her. Dean tries to step between them, to shield her, but Claire doesn’t let him. She steps forward.
Castiel stood at attention, not moving a muscle or even acknowledging that he was being spoken about two feet away. It was very tempting to point out that he could hear them, but he figured that insolence wouldn’t win him any favors, and Naomi would probably put him through an hour long meeting if she found out he jeopardized his chances at infiltrating what he had been led to understand was a fairly high level of resistance hierarchy (as much as they actually had).
“I mean, he was a little drunk too,” she conceded. “But yeah. When Gabriel called and told us what you were trying to do, we all thought you were an idiot. And hey, can’t argue with those results. But, uh…”
Cas swallowed a yelp when Dean nipped at his neck, and glared at Dean when the bastard flashed him a grin, before tugging Cas’ shirt up and over his head, and it was only then that Cas realized Dean had already managed to slip his coat off his shoulders. Cas let it continue, fascinated by the gleam in Dean’s eyes. It felt like something was bubbling under his skin anywhere Dean touched him.
“Okay, but I do,” says Dean. “But the other stuff, that’s gonna be slower. I can’t just flip a switch, man. My entire life has been one fucking tragedy after another. Being happy, that’s gonna take time and work, and I don’t know how you expect me to do that when you can’t even agree to stop dying on me every couple of years.”
“Sorry to disappoint you,” Castiel said. Benny smiled smugly at the fact he’d managed to irritate Castiel so easily. “Dean asked me to stay.”
“This is between me and you,” said Dean, all emotion gone from his voice. He sounded like a different man, a harder man. Castiel didn’t like it. Dean took a step forward and Alistair pressed the knife into Castiel’s stomach just enough so he started to bleed. Dean stopped walking. “You don’t want him.”
“Excessive moping,” said Cas. This was not entirely true. He had put a good deal of effort in the past week into convincing Dean of some fundamental truths, his devotion being one of them. That, and the fact Castiel was a very hard man to kill (and yes an excessive amount of moping) had over the course of several days swayed Dean to Cas’ way of thinking. Mostly. Dorothy had done the rest.
“I wish people would stop asking me that. The answer is invariably no,” said Castiel, eliciting a look of abject irritation from Maggie. “If you don’t want an answer don’t ask a question.”
Seeing no obvious options for continuing the rescue mission after emerging from his hiding place, Cas began to turn the problem around in his head again. That is when an idea finally struck him. It would be difficult if not impossible to reach Dean if he tried to do so in plain site. However, if he found a way to stay out of sight…
“You… you do realize you are one of the few things that actually make me happy?” Cas asked. “I am trying to get better. I know that’s not your responsibility to do for me. And if I can do something to help the cause, I have to. You understand that, don’t you?”
Crowley brings out the papers and passes out a copy to each person at the table. Sam seems prepared, taking out a highlighter and pencil and starting to go through it. Eileen reads over his shoulder and makes suggestions every once in a while, a tap on the shoulder and a few quick signs relaying her own questions and concerns. Castiel doesn’t make the effort of even looking through. If it is a trick he would prefer to not see it coming. Besides, he took the deal without finding out the terms first. Reading it now wouldn’t change that.
Then she walked down to the bathroom. Cas went back inside his room, lay down on his cot and went back to staring at the ceiling. He tried to think what he must look like to Tamara and Sam and Benny. He even briefly imagined what he must look like to the fevered hatred of all things that consumed Gordon. He didn’t much like the picture he came up with.
“But I did anyway,” said Anna. “I knew I would, if I went through with the plan. It’s why I couldn’t tell you. It wasn’t because I didn’t trust you. It was because-“
Having ascertained that, Cas turned his attention to the guards. Some of them were Resistance, he decided. Or at least formerly Resistance. That was a certainty. These were the people who had captured Dean and the others in the first place. These were the people who knew what they were doing. He waited for the anger to come, at what they had done to people like him. Well, people like he used to be. And yet there was still only confusion, because it didn’t make sense. Why kill some soldiers, leave their bodies rotting in the streets, and then clearly take good care of others that were being held prisoner? Why imprison Jesse and Cesar in the first place, if they weren’t the ones who had done those horrific things?
“It was Dean, you idiot,” said Benny incredulously. “You are unbelievably dim witted, anyone ever told you that?”
Cas can’t make himself say anything to convince Dean to say yes. Doesn’t know what he even could say that he hasn’t already. Dean is not his only happiness, but he is the one who showed him happiness, who led him down the path to everything in himself he now valued. He could not say how much it hurt to know Dean might not choose to save himself. But it did have to be his choice.
Castiel was slumped over sleeping next to Selma in a van with Jo and Benny, when a loud rapping on one of the windows woke him up. He’d been asleep for only twenty minutes when this interruption to his much needed rest came. He pried open his eyes to glare at the source of the noise, which turned out to be Dean knocking on Benny’s window.
Risa crossed her arms and stared him down, evaluating his honesty. Three seconds later she nodded, and Aaron ran off to go make that happen. Cas stood where he had been standing since the confrontation started, and cleared his throat to catch Risa’s attention.
“Uh yeah. She and Sam are having marital issues,” Charlie said. “You know how it is. Sometimes people just can’t see eye to eye on what they’re going to get out of a relationship.”
“I believe the technical term would be a chemical imbalance in the brain,” said Cas. “Or something along those lines. Who can tell after you’ve been drugged for months on end with dangerous substances that probably shouldn’t be considered ethical to use on other human beings? There is of course, also the current state of the world, the fact that I am partly responsible for the deaths of at least two members of my garrison and counting, and that it has been less than a year since I was told everything I knew in life was a lie.”
“Dean,” says Sam, but it isn’t the right one. It’s the real one. Or the more real one. Dean is having trouble keeping it straight anymore. “You know this isn’t real right?”
“You deserve to be happy, too, Castiel,” Selma told him. Then she let him go and Castiel carried on with the competition as though their conversation hadn’t happened. No one else seemed to have noticed.
“Cas, wake up,” said Selma, shaking Castiel lightly. Castiel jerked slightly as he woke, but relaxed when he saw her face. “Jo and Benny bailed and left me to wake you up… Did you have a bad dream?”
Then Kaia clutches at her side, and Claire knows she’s probably ripped out her stitches. Her staff falls to the ground, but before Kaia collapses, Claire is there, arms wrapped around her to keep her on her feet. That’s the good part of having Kaia with her on hunts like this. Even though it’s dangerous, Claire can keep her promise and watch out for her. Always will keep that promise, if she gets her way.
“I guess this is it,” he says instead of everything else he could. It’ll have to fill in the blanks. It’ll have to be enough. “Show’s over.”
Jack frowned, looking outwards. He gazed into the black depths of the rivers as though the answers were there.
“Can I ask?” she said after Cas had seen her start to shiver a little as well and begrudgingly shared the blanket.
“It is,” says Billie. “Your right hand was trying to make some adjustments. They got out of control.”
Jack and Kelly’s faces are expectant and wary and Cas doesn’t understand that either. It’s as though they’re all in on a secret that Castiel is supposed to know, too.
That doesn’t make it easier when Dean can feel Sam’s eyes on him as he watches Cas go, can feel the wheels spinning in his little brother’s head. He does his best not to flinch when Sam asks Eileen if she can watch Chuck for a second. Instead of wondering just why Sam might want to talk to him alone, he tries to focus on and take a little vindictive pleasure in the very real fear with which Chuck yells after them that Eileen is going to take out his kneecaps.
“Well, if we knew we’d know something,” said Selma. “Jess thinks it’s more people they’ve been experimenting on. She said she talked to Tamara and Rufus about it. The building they found them in had lab equipment and living areas. With bars and locks on them. Eileen led the team that retrieved the hostages though, and they didn’t get to see until after.”
When they were finally allowed to enter, Castiel struck the thoughts from his head to be reviewed later. He knew at some point he would have to ask someone which of his assumptions were wrong and which were right, and how different the world really was than he had thought, but not now. Now he had a responsibility to Kelly, who he had promised he would keep safe.
“I’m sure the two of you have figured out how this works,” she said. Neither of them answered. Any word out of place meant punishment for the other person. “Good. Now, I am going to be broadcasting to the city. I know some of the soldiers are expecting Castiel’s grand speech, but I’m afraid I’ll have to use the time to deliver an ultimatum.”
The door in front of them swung open to reveal a man. He was dressed in a suit that was made of a shiny black textured fabric, and had on a crown. He looked at the collection of resistance members on his front step and his eyes zeroed in on Jo and Charlie, who were still kissing.
God, Sam loves Eileen. He loves her so damn much, and every time she does something or says something incredible like this he feels like he’s being hit in the face with that fact all over again.
Cas felt his eyebrows shoot up to his hairline. Supreme leader? What nonsense was this? It was one thing to go rogue, another thing to go rogue and turn away refugees, but to do all of this and willingly subject oneself to the command of someone so pompous as to label themselves “supreme leader,’ as if the name in any way made them so…
“I only know Libidine rules,” said Cas. “And I’ll give fair warning, I am very good at that game. It’s the only card game I am particularly good at.”
Sam swallows, because it is partly true. Except more true than that is that Dean had gone in that room with no other result in his own head than dying. Cas changed the outcome, they both know that. It was a gamble, but it was one that paid off because everyone is still fucking alive and they’re getting a chance here to start over. Wipe the slate clean and start writing stories of their own. He doesn’t understand why Dean doesn’t see that.
Under the rotten bodies, the streets of Libidine were still teeming with life. It was almost as though Castiel were a boy again, and he had never really left.
He had to scan further down before he finally caught sight of Dean and felt a horrific knot in his throat finally start to loosen. Dean was fine. He didn’t even look scared. Pissed maybe, but unharmed. Benny was in the cell next to him, and they were having a quiet conversation between themselves and the two burly men next to them who Cas assumed must be Jesse and Cesar.
His own people had no such issues. Balthazar, Hael, Remiel, and Jack volunteered to help him with the clearing, efficiently splitting the group in two. They all got to work.
“We’re out of time,” she says. It takes Sam about a second for that to fully get through to him. Then he nods at Patience seriously, turns and sounds the alarm.
Although it had taken some convincing, Castiel had at long last secured for him some time away from Sam. He had no doubt being forced to shadow him had been another one of Dean’s tests he was being subjected to, and it rightly disconcerted him how astute Sam was. Castiel might surprise him at times, but Sam was definitely starting to form a solid and informed opinion about him. Castiel just wasn’t sure what that opinion was.
“Hey!” said Charlie, attempting to kick Dean under the table and missing and kicking Cas instead. She looked up at him with a sheepish shrug. “Sorry.”
“Rowena had only ever used him,” Charlie confirmed. “She hated the pain he put her through, and treated him like crap. So Crowley started to wonder if she would pass the crown to him at all, or if someday he would die the same way the old king and queen had.”
“Thought you were weaning yourself off the caffeine again,” says Claire, frowning slightly in disapproval.
Cas woke up with a heavy weight on his left side and a dull aching throb of pain on his right. He remembered he’d been stabbed the day before and decided he needed more pain medication. The other phenomena was quickly explained when he opened his eyes to find Dean practically laying on top of him and using his shoulder as a pillow.
“You got a better idea?” says Dean. “If the kid goes supernova, everybody dies. I’m just one guy. I’m not more important than that.”
“You can’t take her from me,” said Dean, voice louder and flatter as he kept talking. “I won’t let you.”
And it was something about the evasiveness that made it crystal clear. Castiel sat up and crossed his legs, waiting for Dean to look at him again. Once he did he guessed one more time.
“What about you?” Benny asked, and Castiel didn’t even know why he was surprised that Benny would challenge him on this. Of course he wasn’t taking it at face value, not when Castiel was the one delivering the news. “Shouldn’t you be ‘consumed with despair’ too?”
“Yes and no,” he said at last. “She didn’t trust me enough for… for that to matter. But she’s the reason our last Lightbringer is dead. Or part of it at least. Everything I am now, I owe part of that to her.”
“Let her stay,” came the calm voice of Billie, soothing through the tension in the room. Castiel’s attention was instantly won by her. He could recognize the sound of a voice that held power. That everyone around her went silent when she spoke was superfluous to already ample evidence that she was in charge here. Dean grit his teeth, but let it pass.
“Oh god, I don’t want to ask what this is,” muttered Dean at the other end, picking up on Kali’s tone immediately. “First thing first. How are the two stupidest people I know doing?”
Dean looked at Jo, who shrugged. Castiel noticed a smile hidden under her nonchalance though, and suspected she found it funny that he was annoying her superior. It was quite an unprofessional attitude to have, though he suspected it wasn’t uncommon among them.
“It’ll be fine,” said Gabriel. He had coalesced into one person again. Castiel decided to take that as a good sign. “You need to go to the hospital.”
They walked out the doors and saw that Dean was waiting for them there with Benny and Gordon standing behind him, and a small guard consisting of Jess, Selma, and Lizzy for Benny and Kubrick, Betty, and Roy for Gordon. Despite knowing how skilled each of them were, it still seemed to small a force to Castiel, and he thought it a very poor choice to have Gordon as one of the two captains Dean had chosen to come along with him. Then again, Castiel thoroughly disliked Gordon, and perhaps he was being unfair.
It was as he was entertaining this line of thought that someone sat in front of him. Castiel tensed in surprise and had to force himself not to flee his seat. He was still fighting the instincts that had kept him from being caught for almost two months.
And then Cas saved him. And of course Sam knows what Dean’s reaction to that is, because Dean makes no fucking sense. His reaction was how fucking dare Cas do that to him.
The second Castiel saw Dean, the anger started fading. The man was wrecked in a way his carefree tone would never have suggested. He was twitchy and their was something about the way he kept looking out of the corner of his eyes that made him look a little past sane.
Dean watches anyway. The body screams as soon as Cas fashions a voice box and sews together a throat. A chin, a nose, ears, lips, and a scalp. Cas doesn’t give him eyes. Not until he presses to fingers to the body’s forehead, lulling the lost soul to sleep.
“I’m not,” Castiel said, holding his hands palms up in an attempt to telegraph that his intentions weren’t hostile. “What I wanted to say was it didn’t occur to me that… perhaps you were doing what you wished someone had done for you.”
Castiel cut himself off with a shout as a sharp pain sliced its way up his arm and through his nervous system. Alistair let go off the viselike grip on his hand and Castiel looked down in horror to discover he now only had four fingers on his left hand. Alastair had removed his ring finger, and Castiel detachedly though that perhaps Naomi had a sense of humor after all, considering she was under the impression he and Dean were genuinely engaged. It was a pointed message.
“Well, I want you alive,” said Dean, as though that settled that. And then he went back to reading the same story he had been throughout Cas’ illness, and Cas fell asleep to dreams of twelve maids hanging in a row, and him at the end with a noose closing tighter around his neck.
“Just shut up, Cas,” Charlie said, squeezing the hug a little tighter. Cas took the hint. When Charlie let him go, she nodded to herself. “I’m only forgiving you conditionally, okay?”
“If they surrender, I am going to hand you over,” said Naomi. “So if I were you I’d try to be convincing in your need for rescue.”
Claire stared up at the sky. Jesse turned to look at her and tried not to notice that her eyes looked a little glassier than they had been a moment before.
“You’re not real,” he realized as he watched her fall to the ground. She smiled up at him in a way that the real Anna never would have. Like she wanted him to hurt.
“Selma is a lot of things, but she isn’t subtle,” said Charlie with a sigh. “And what am I supposed to say? Don’t try to find happiness after grieving your fiancee for literal years? I’m not a fucking monster. Doesn’t mean I’m going to start asking her for favors.”
“Okay, then we’ll get the ceasefire,” he said. “We call Azazel and say we don’t like his terms. We keep Kelly, and he gets insurance against us using her as part of the fight. He wants her off the board, and if we guarantee that he’ll take the deal.”
“Live your life out on Earth and worry about other things?” she guesses. “Including whether or not the carpet here has been cleaned since it was first installed…”
For now, she decides to steal some snacks from the food table, and loads up a plate before sitting next to Jack and Owen. Both boys are solemnly drinking Capri-Suns and watching the construction work with rapt attention. Owen takes out a book Claire lent him and starts reading when that gets boring. Alex sits on the grass next to Jack.
Instead he leans over the bed and throws up. Mary’s nose crinkles in mild disgust, and she sits down on the bed next to him until he’s done. Dean doesn’t look at her.
Likely Uriel hadn’t taken it well, being the more suitable candidate. He did seem a little unhappy when it came up in conversation, but otherwise he was witty and biting as ever. He and Benjamin played off each other sarcastically, until some of the tension had drained from the room. Everyone chattered, and after an hour even an unusually quiet Samandriel began to join in and it felt like going home after a very long time away.
“He’s new,” Dean said, cutting Castiel off. He was looking a little warily at his mother’s incredulous expression, and winced when she raised an eyebrow at him. “We’re still working on deprogramming him a little.”
Castiel had only added to this that garrisons acted as units, and would care more about each other than about other garrisons. If they wanted to hinder every garrison, they needed at least one hostage from every garrison. The state organized itself by having supervising commanders in times of conflict that required multiple garrisons to work together on a single assignment, but this was more for coordination than an actual attempt to work in harmony with each other. If the garrisons were attacked uniformly, there would be more success.
Meg reached into her pocket, causing Castiel to draw the gun he was now allowed to carry and point it at her. She smirked at him and let a piece of paper flutter open and held it out to him.
“If you’re supposed to sniff out trouble, you are horribly defective,” he said to the cat. She only blinked at him and then went back to curling up in his lap. He sighed and began to gently pet the creature while he waited for Charlie to wake up and begin their day of activity. This was his last day until he returned to Naomi and shared what he had learned and found out the pre-approved useful information he was going to be allowed to share with Dean so they could plot their next attempt to destabilize the state. Which meant he had to have a meeting with Dean, Billie, Sam, and Charlie before he left.
They sit in the silence of that for a moment. It makes Castiel feel very small, which is almost grounding. It makes him feel alive in a way he hasn’t since the Empty took him. There is a familiarity in being miserable that he almost misses. Does miss, maybe. At least it’s something to feel. At least it’s not the peaceful fullness Jack has instilled in him, as his default state. Free of his regrets, his fears, his mistakes.
“It’s nice, really, Dean that you keep taking the bullets out of my guns, but I’m not going to pretend not to notice.”
“Eileen found an additional stairwell that had been boarded up,” said Sam, nonchalantly. “We thought we’d check it out. Keep informed.”
“Sometimes I worry I’ll never be happy that way again. That all chance of that died with Erica,” she said quietly. Castiel squeezed her hand tight, trying to convey comfort to her.
“I trust you,” said Jack next. “Gadreel said I shouldn’t, and that you weren’t a good person, but you are. My mom used to tell me you could always tell a good person from a bad person by how they act when they have nothing to gain.”
Castiel hated how calm she sounded. Because an existential crisis that had lasted two months of running from the people he had sworn to serve was still fresh in his mind.
“They’ll hear anyway,” said Cas. “This is just a courtesy call. The entire city is going to hear what I have to say.”
“Hello Boris,” Castiel said when he walked up to the two of them. The woman next to him put her book down at the sound of his voice and looked at Boris. He grimaced at her interest.
Kaia hides a smile as she goes back to painting her sigil. Claire doesn’t see it, but Castiel does. There is a strange feeling in his chest, watching these two girls be so careful with one another. Even their disputes are gentle, teasing. It is not lost on Castiel that they seem to be very in love with one another. He is happy that Claire has found someone to give so much of herself to, and who seems to return herself in equal measure.
“We’ve got a couple hours until midnight. You can sulk in here if you want, but just… think about it, okay?”
Dean bites off the end of his sentence, looking away from them all angrily. Then he focuses in on Sam.
“Fine,” Claire says, turning from Patience to race down the stairs after Dean and Cas. Figures that she’s a lot more spry than two old-ish men, even if miraculously Dean’s knees have never given out. She catches up to them before they even reach Jody, attempting to give her a quick goodbye before they race out and off to their own lives. Like always. “Hey!”
“Over my dead body,” says Dean. For the first time in days, Sam manages a smile. Not because it’s funny, but because Dean clearly thinks it is, what with the ‘close call’ and all. “Fucking death traps, I swear. Very cool looking though. Weird Dorothy never came back for it.”
Metatron made them approach him with Duma nudging them closer. Metatron frowned at Cas again, focusing on the hand that was currently covering one of Charlie’s. It took Cas a moment to remember his missing finger.
“She’s being a little sister, dumbass,” he’d told Cas when Cas had complained about for the umpteenth time. “She’s making sure I’m good enough for you.”
“Sure thing, soldier,” said Mandy in a tone suggest enough to make Ellen shake her head in disappointment. Mandy laughed at Ellen on her way out.
“No, but we have other uses for those who defect for personal reasons,” said the woman, causing Castiel to grit his teeth and look down. He’d given himself away, but he didn’t care. The anger at what he knew the woman was about to address was still fresh and bubbling inside him, his nightmare only adding fuel to the horror. “I understand you lost the Commander of your garrison on a mission. That must have been difficult for you.”
“Intellectually,” said Castiel, shortly. He didn’t want to be in this room, speaking in a civilized manner to a pencil pusher who knew nothing of the closeness being part of a garrison meant. He’d rather be sitting across from an executioner than a bureaucrat.
“I don’t want you to have to deal with my problems,” says Sam. “I have a lot of them. And you’re… you’re the first good thing that’s happened to me in a long time. I don’t want to ruin that.”
“No, that was well… That was him,” Kelly said. Cas began to feel a sinking feeling in his gut. “Our leader.”
And then there is Claire. Dean doesn’t notice her at first, too bleary with agony to think. But when he does, he knows she is about to do something stupid. He stares in shock when she steps closer and takes hold of Cas’ free hand. Her eyes light up silver, as the flesh and muscle seems to melt from the bones of her face. Cas grips her tighter, reforming her features as her mouth opens wide and a string of silver appears.
“Leave,” he said. Chuck smirked at him, and Cas was pretty sure his grip on Dean’s arm was the only thing that kept Dean from physically attacking the false prophet. Not that Castiel didn’t think the cretin deserved it, but Chuck was his mother’s son. He’d been raised by the same hands that had raised Cas and that meant a little bit of something. Not enough that Cas wouldn’t be happy to see someone punch him in the face, but he wasn’t just going to let Dean do it. Especially when they’re situation was as precarious as it was.
“Cas?” asked Charlie behind him. Her voice was gentle and it brought him back to reality. Living in a past that he had never actually had was not going to help him. He shouldn’t have even tried. “Jo and I were going to play Go Fish to pass the time. Want in?”
She likes ghost hunts more than most. Figuring out where a ghost is going to appear plays to her strengths, the attention she pays to cold spots proving more reliable than other hunters who tend to rely on their hearing when trying to locate and dispel ghosts. The advantage of learning to adjust and rely on your other senses, is you get really good at it. So Eileen takes her advantages where she can get them.
“Finding loopholes in orders,” Jo said, knowing from a series of conversations with Castiel that he didn’t react well to implications that he didn’t perform well as a soldier. It was one of the things that had made Jo wait so long before finally bringing him with her to a neutral space so he could be appraised for usefulness and trustworthiness. Apparently she hadn’t shared with her superior before dragging Castiel here exactly who he was.
‘You talked to Dean?’ she signs, her eyebrows going up in question. Seeing the expression on Sam’s face, she frowns. ‘That bad, huh?’
“She broke up with Charlie,” Selma said. When Cas failed to look impressed she repeated herself more emphatically. “She broke up with Charlie. She’s never done that before. They’ve been in love for years. No one just… changes like that.”
“I think Lucrum is going to side with Naomi,” Eileen said out loud. “So we need to get Ira with Zachariah so it’s an even fight. As long as they’e fighting each other, we have an advantage.”
Sam’s eyes scanned the equations on the paper with a speed that betrayed familiarity. He quickly replaced them, looking impressed with the math and observations. Castiel glanced at them as well, but the numbers were meaningless to him.
It also aligned with current resistance goals of avoiding the extermination Zachariah had planned for them that Naomi surely disapproved of. Her allowance of second chances even for those that had agreed to death as a punishment for disobeying had suggested to Castiel she was one of the voices that was still strongly in favor of reeducation over annihilation.
But Claire doesn’t say anything. She closes her eyes and mouths something to herself under her breath once and then opens them again. Her hands relax.
So instead of staring in confused disbelief at the magic Charlie was able to do with a computer, he was able to get a lay of the land in his new environment. Unlike at Camp Jefferson Starship, every structure here was impermanent and easy to move quickly. Castiel suspected from size of the tents that the layout put the more important people in the camp close to the center. However, it was clear almost immediately as Castiel began a meandering walk through the camp that the priority of the defenses was making sure the children here were safe.
Claire set Dean down as gently as she could manage, but it was clear he was heavier than she was used to carrying. She pulled the mask off of her face, breathing hard. She sat down next to him, still trying to catch her breath. Dean was coughing, a horrific almost wet sound. Castiel collapsed on the ground next to him, haphazardly pushing Dean from laying on his back to on his side. Claire helped after a moment, positioning Dean’s leg and arm so that he wouldn’t roll all the way over onto his stomach. The cough devolved into gagging, and Dean threw up acrid bile onto the blacktop side alley they’d found themselves in.
“Just so you know I could,” she says to Chuck. He meets her eyes for about a second, then bolts. Probably off to steal one of the classic cars in the Men of Letters garage and hightail it back to his shitty apartment and spit out a few more (probably defamatory) books. Sam catches a look of pride on Dean’s face aimed in Claire’s direction, recognizing it from the way he used to look when he taught Sam how to sharpshoot tin cans.
“Hell of a way to see you again, Cassie,” said Balthazar, tugging him forward. It bothered Cas that he didn’t know where Alistair had gone, and he had but to turn around to see him blindly tossing a knife at Hael. It sunk into her thigh and she went down with a shriek. “We have to go.”
“It’s okay, baby. I’m here,” she crooned softly to Emma as the girl hid her face in her mother’s hair. Lydia only looked surprised for a moment to see Cas standing there before the anger hit. Cas waited for her to start yelling at him and was surprised when she turned around to shout back at Dean.
“I know, Dean,” he said, closing his eyes away from the horrified look on Dean’s face at the sight of Cas’ current physical state. “It’s always you.”
“It’s a rain check,” Cas says, and finds that he means it. Dean looks relieved. “I’d prefer the opportunity to return the favor when you’re not too tired to appreciate it.”
To find an intact building that hadn’t been repurposed in some way was rare, and places of worship were no exception. Buildings that were still being used as a place of worship were few and far between and small religious communities tended to collect around them. Castiel vaguely remembered from when he was young that most of the people he knew were also Christian, and had realized later that that was not the case for the majority.
“You’ve never been in this dream before,” he told her. She shrugged, eyes sharp and expression disapproving.
Warnings: torture (nothing worse than the show has done), references sexual assault (it is implied to have happened in the past; there is nothing explicit)
“It doesn’t have to be that way, Castiel,” says Amara. Billie snorts, but Amara pays her no mind. Her eyes remain fast on Castiel and, despite himself, it does make him feel small. “I do… understand. The draw.”
Cas turns. It’s something of a shock to see his family standing there. Dean, Sam, Jack, and Kelly. Mary and Bobby. Rowena, too, funnily enough.
“Right,” says Cas. And because no one knows when to leave a thing alone. “It didn’t always sound like you were talking about me, Dean.”
“Drop it,” Jo said, looking between the two of them. Benny shrugged it off and Jo turned back to Cas. “Lemme introduce you to anyone you don’t know. That’s Jason, he’s Kevin’s cousin.”
“No, Cas!” Anna yelled before the shot rang out. The wrong shot. It seemed to happen in slow motion, Anna falling as Cas dropped his gun and ran to catch her before she hit the ground. His hands moved to press into the wound, trying to staunch the flow of blood. Anna, already fair skinned, was just getting paler and paler.
“You don’t eat, doofus,” Dean retorted. Still, it eased something in him, to know that Cas had the presence of mind to lie, badly, to cover up his concern. It meant this wasn’t a fight waiting to happen, or a well-meant intervention. “You got something to say, Cas?”
“I didn’t expect otherwise,” said Castiel. Charlie raised an eyebrow at him, but Castiel kept a straight face. She ended up sighing and walking away, muttering about ‘it would help if you weren’t doing your best to be all suspicious’. Castiel followed her after a few seconds and didn’t mention that he could quite literally hear every word she was saying. He suspected it was on purpose.
When he woke later that afternoon, it was to find that sometime that morning, Dean had pushed the both of their cots together and was snoring lightly next to him, the oxygen machine undercutting the sound with a soft buzzing. Dean’s hand was in his, the one missing a finger. If it had been anyone else, Cas would have recoiled. He did not like being reminded of the missing part of himself. It felt like an externalization of a way he had long felt. He was not whole, not complete.
“I know what a casino is,” Castiel said, not bothering to look back at him and instead focusing on his cards. “And I haven’t been to Libidine in three years, so I wouldn’t know the state of them. I have heard rumors Raphael was considering closing them, but I don’t think she did. They made too much money not to keep open.”
‘Almost since he met Cas,’ she signs back, smiling mischievously. ‘You really didn’t see this coming?’
The next round of drinks arrived, which spared Castiel from having to respond to that. Instead he could focus on not being sober, which was infinitely more appealing.
