John responds with a tight squeeze.
he schooled himself, breathing deeply until the hot anger cooled.
“We did it!” Sherlock crows, throwing his arms around Sherrin who hoists him up around the middle and spins him around, yelping with victory. Suddenly there’s a pounding on the door.
The bedclothes were pulled back and they were scooped into a huge hand, squeezing shoulder to shoulder. The troll tucked a snowy white blanket around their shoulders.
“John, come here,” he commands into the silence. Sherlock cringes at his tone, clears his throat, and softens it. “Stand here in the light so I can photograph your scratch.” John, mid-way through dressing, comes to the bedside and pulls off his shirt. The simple action of John disrobing for him, without a second thought, stirs him beneath the blankets.
“Please, this is complicated. Are you thirsty? Do you need–”
“Yea, beastly. So. Um, where’s Sherlock?”
“John, the Queens English tells us a-u-g-h says
Sherlock peaks his eyebrows at John, whose scowl warms into a sheepish smile.
On Sherlock’s next circuit around the room, fingers jittering at his sides, eyes flashing, John puts all of his own barely-repressed nerves to use and tackles him into a fierce embrace, pushing him against the wall and holding him tight.
“I feared you would remain that way.” He looks away, suddenly shy. “We switched to alternative methods of waking you. It was Molly’s idea, actually. I made an arrangement with Mycroft. He wasn’t in favor of our plan at all, but I was… convincing.”
he said bitterly. “I was eighteen, a new cadet – my unit was on campaign when it started, chasing the Wall in Scotland. It happened so fast – we were quarantined for weeks.” He seethed at the memory. “I felt so bloody
“Kind of you, perhaps later.” She jutted her chin at him. “See to your own Expunge first, dear boy, before you succumb as deeply as your companion. It doesn’t show yet, but your own condition is much more serious than an old woman’s well-earned aches. Oh – and I nearly forgot. There is a bedroom down the hall, should you need a rest. The one upstairs is smaller,” she said with a smile, “should it be needed.”
John squeezed his eyes shut, pushing down panic with the practice of a field healer. The odds were impossible. He couldn’t climb or out-run them. He was trapped and totally defenseless.
“Not sure I can climb.” He can hardly curl his stiff hands into fists and his legs feel like field stones. “Anyone up there? To help?”
“This one tastes like you.”
“The extremely negative effects of my actions, yes. I was halfway across the globe. If I came within the city limits, you were at risk. After the virus, I stopped trying to reach you. I put all of my efforts on dismantling the web.”
Royal guards had first verified Lestrade’s identity using coils of copper wire and sparking glass domes. Clockwork storks had tottered around them, recording and evaluating Lestrade’s voice and scent.
Sherlock resists the urge to stand and push the wayward hair behind her ear, but she’s in serious scientist mode and wouldn’t appreciate the coddling gesture.
Sherlock scoops up the limp five-year-old with a muttered ‘ooph’, wispy blond hair tickling his face, and gently settles her back onto the mattress. He doesn’t cover her with the blanket – she’ll just kick it off and get tangled again. In Rosie’s room, blankets are only for tent forts, or nests for the furry animals, but John still covers her up at bedtime each night. Sprawled on the galaxy-patterned sheet, her eyelids squeeze and teeth grind as she fights some nocturnal foe. The jut of her jaw makes her look just like John.
“John! John, I’m here!” Sherlock suddenly leans over the side of the well, his voice bouncing around the walls as he lowers a bulky bundle from another rope.
“You… who forgets to eat for days on end. How?”
Sherlock startles, waking fully. The heavy leather-bound book slides off his chest onto the grass. His eyes snap up to the tall, lean figure standing before him, dappled with willow shadow and sun, smiling warmly.
“Cheers, love, I’ll bring the honey biscuits he’s been so partial to.”
John was struck by the urge to give his hand a tight squeeze of reassurance, but balled up his fists into his coat pockets instead. “At least you were with them. I wasn’t able to help
Thanks to shirleycarlton for excellent beta'ing.
“It was brilliant,” he whispers. “It kept me alive before I met you. And once I met you, it was our foreplay, our sex, if I may be so bold as to apply the metaphor.”
John laughs, exasperated. “Companions?”
William scooped them both up and strode to the wall, the fire cat balanced on his shoulder. He stopped before the whitewashed stone and sniffed deeply, his nostrils twitching delicately.
John shrugged. “I mean, yes, sure, I’ve
“Very good, sir.”
Sherlock stands in the sudden silence. He wrinkles his nose – the usual smells of the flat are swirled with the slightly medical pong of hospital antiseptic.
To note, London's Necropolis Railway was a real thing, and the vaults below it (where our Adelidae had lived) are now an art scene.
“And Hamish if it’s a boy.”
John’s face bumps against his in the dark, his hands pressing urgently to his chest, running along his limbs, his voice pitched too high. “Where are you hit? Jesus,

John watches him quietly for a moment.

After several long moments, Sherlock can feel some of the tension unspool in John’s back. He huffs and gives Sherlock a little squeeze.
“It’s nothing,” John blustered, “I mean, any decent person would–”
They both startle as a sing-song voice comes from the sitting room. Sherlock growls, though John looks slightly relieved.

John would have waited for him to wake up from the careful distance of his chair in the sitting room.
“Your… techniques. They worked. You pulled me out.
Sherlock unfolds his limbs and stretches like a cat, occupying the whole of the couch. He closes his eyes, feeling unusually lighter, as if some great, taloned bird has been roosting on his back and, through the telling and confessing and embracing, taken flight.

“That’s
“This skill was highly coveted by the organization. In his early years of leadership, Jim orchestrated political shifts of great complexity. You can thank him for simultaneously averting a world war with North Korea, bringing space flight to the private sector, and the rapid evolution of handheld electronics.”
“If anything,” Sherlock continues, “we have delayed much too long, have had time stolen from us by forces we could not control. I am… extremely eager to make up for that lost time.”
Sherlock fumes silently at his peppers. He knows he’s being childish, but somehow, he thought Sherrin would validate it.
. “That,” he whispers. “Signal that and I’ll know it’s you.”
“If you are alluding to the tiger, Rosamund, I was as appalled as you. Your father did not deserve such a horrific end, but big game hunters take a risk. Are you implying I had something to do with the attack?”
Sherlock arches his eyebrow dramatically. He’s only just figured out the trick of it and uses it relentlessly. Sherrinford notices and chuckles.
John says, awed.
Sherrinford blinks at him.
“You first.” John elbowed the young man, but Kinsey had become intensely distracted by something over John’s head. He turned to see two scantily-clad women on stilts, every bit of exposed skin patterned with intricate henna.
“Oh, 48 hours, roughly.”
“Well, with that bloody mess cleaned up, I expect you’ll be asking for a case any minute now.”
“I doubt I could even handle it.”
Sherlock wakes at 4:47am to find a small bare foot pressed against his face. Their tiny daughter, as predicted, is taking up the majority of the mattress between them, head resting on John’s blanket-covered calves. Not daring to move too much, Sherlock hugs her feet to his chest and nestles his face against John’s shoulder, his breath deep and even with peaceful, dreamless sleep.
John struggles up the last of the steps, balances the boxes on a hip and awkwardly lets himself into their flat. The pile obscures his view, but he can hear what Mrs. Hudson was describing. A rhythmic, mechanical whirring that immediately puts him in mind of something he perhaps shouldn’t be walking in on. But he’s made so much noise, surely Sherlock won’t be caught too off guard…
“I’d so looked forward to killing you in your sleep,” Rosamund baits, “but now,
A fog horn bleated in the distance and the pale clerk startled, turning wide eyes to John as if just realizing he was there. The dreamy gaze cracked into a wry smirk on the unfamiliar face.
Mrs. Hudson sighed wearily. “We work against Toria and the Netters as best we can, but we are outnumbered and her methods of tracking and capture evolve rapidly. Many work covertly to understand what happens in her hidden Laboratories.”
On his next dive, he finds the femur, the thin ulna, a rib. He uses the bones to wedge the shirt deeper into the pipe, then his jacket. Surfacing for a fast breath, he returns to the pipe, relief surging through him to find the dam still wedged into place, the flow nearly stopped. He pops to the surface like a cork and gives a weak whoop of triumph.
“Greg, hang on,” John wrinkles his brow. “If Magnusson was unconscious, how could he have shot Sherlock?”
“Oh, I thought you made excellent progress this evening.”
“Do sit, Captain.”
“If you had to watch it, you should have stayed with me.” John bites his lip. “I think we can agree we’re fairly stronger

of a child, telling him bluntly it’s his human defect, and again he feels a wave of rage. John roars as his head breaks the surface, kicking vainly against the chain.
He eats and sleeps just enough to make the doctors trust they can release him. At home, he sprawls on the sofa, hearing his parents whisper about psychologists. He goes through the motions, but inside he is completely frozen. The voices keep up a steady dirge of judgement.
“Doubtful. The

“Wake
“Here, there’s a card.” He tears open the pale green envelope and finds more cartoonish bee-themes on the cardstock, the inside crammed with Mycroft’s thin, spidery writing.
“Of course,” John whispered. “That’s horrible, I’m sorry.”
“I know my vices, Billy.” He frowns slightly. “But I’m also getting a sense for yours. So let my missteps please be a formative lesson for you, hm? Chasing danger may not be the best professional compass.”
“The joint was inflamed, but I’ve reduced the swelling. It will likely return in a day or so, but I’m happy to attend to it while we’re here.”
“John, remember when we used to play Rock, Paper, Scissor?”
He feels Sherlock’s full-body twitch against his back as he suddenly wakes.
There are so many kisses woven into this first tangle of lips and breath. The kiss they should have shared in the entryway of 221B the night Sherlock cured John’s limp. It would have tasted of laughter. Kisses in the backs of cabs. Kisses after adrenaline-fueled chases. Kisses to quiet nightmares; after brilliant deductions; after a life saved; after a subway bomb was disarmed and a bitter lie forgiven. Kisses to smooth harsh words; kisses when John left for the surgery, and more when he returned home.
“Right.”
“Sorry, if you’d rather not discuss it – I shouldn’t talk work on our first proper date.”
“Mmm…”
After Sherlock’s Fall, Mycroft begins to explain the secret organization led for hundreds of years by a Moriarty.
“John, I was thinking we should get tamarind duck from that place, you know, with the dumplings – oh! Melissa’s eating solid food now! She can have her first proper London dumpling! And then–”
Sherlock grins. “I’ll be right up. Let me stack these papers. I don’t want them drawn on again in the morning.”
John squeezes his eyes shut and nods.
The tea and food settled onto small tables as she pushed a pile of clothing into his hands. “These should fit. There is also a frock coat by the door that I think would suit your lanky frame well.”
Sherrinford smiles at him gently between the messy array of glass apparatus, lighting a Bunsen burner, pipette in hand. Sherlock stares down at their heap of notes, the equations stirring on the page as he imagines their chemical reactions instead of meeting his brother’s eyes.
“What, two meals in one day?”
“Not just for the Expunge,” Sherlock pushed on
“Morning,” John says quietly against Sherlock’s lips. “Much as I want you to act on every single impulse I am clearly seeing in your eyes, you need to read this.”

drink bottled water for a bit, all that?”
“There was always the chance that afternoon… we would have been separated again. Rosamund can be difficult to predict. I knew your memories were resurfacing, that it could be any day they fully returned. I’d rather hoped it would happen when we were alone together, to give you time to sort through it, so we could form a plan. I… had to improvise a bit.”
“Oh no,” Mycroft huffs. “that would have been exponentially easier. Alas, admission to

John nods absently, still bewildered by Sherlock’s offer of dinner. “No problem. I’ll come. Night’s young. Chilly, though. You’ll want to wrap up in that big, flashy coat of yours.”
After clearing away “lunch,” he pulls a worn paperback from the duffel he’d brought from John’s house. Perching gingerly at the foot of the bed, he begins to read aloud the first chapter of

“That’s brilliant. She’ll be humming Vivaldi any day. Think she’s through the rough patch, then?”
Chuckling, Sherlock kisses his forehead and eases him off the pillows. John laboriously pulls his legs out from under the blankets, leaning into Sherlock’s support. He smoothly threads his arm around John’s back and helps him stand, taking his weight.
The dream seemed to be mostly a collage of yesterday’s shocking experiences – escaping, flying free, falling – but something nagged at him. Who had he been missing in the dream? John, perhaps, though it was a strikingly strong emotion for someone he’d known less than a day.
“But you had one today who stumped you.”
“What do you think William meant by a
Mrs. Hudson leaves them, heading to the sitting room to harass Sherlock.
They were going to crash pathetically into the huge steam pipes. A fierce throb of desperate anger shot through John’s core.
“Aw, poor blighter,” William muttered. “Good thing you held onto him so tightly. Merfolk may not have been so keen to save him as old William.”
“Well, perhaps those who befriend halfbloods
She steps back, face cracked into a grin.
“Melissa,” they say in unison. Their baby makes a curious goose-like sound in her sleep. John chuckles. “Well, that’s settled then.”
“Oh, shite,
Sherlock falls into her arms and suddenly begins to weep against her shoulder. Perhaps as surprised by his outburst as she is by the news, his mum pats him on the back.
“Yes. Or as I knew her, Rosamund Moran. Daughter to Sebastian Moran, head of the now-obsolete Magpies, has-been research dogs of The League, and right-hand man to one Jim Brooks.”
And then he is arching his pelvis, the easier for John to slide off his flimsy old pajamas and threadbare pants.
“It is,” Sherlock almost growls. “And it is woefully lacking in essential prompts.”
“Why do they need them to dream?”
“Answer him!” the Sergeant demanded, twisting John’s arms until his eyes watered, but he remained limp and silent.
“Sherrinford! Aw, ace! When did you get here?” Sherlock leaps up and throws his arms around his favorite brother. The elder by ten years, they share the same piercing grey eyes, unruly black curls, and pale skin, though while Sherrinford’s supposed to be finishing a post-doctorate in chemical thermodynamics, Sherlock can tell from his ruddy, freckled skin and the dry mud ground into the leather of his shoes that he’s been doing a lot of what their mother disapprovingly dubs
– will he ever forgive Sherlock for seeing him so weak? For becoming so weak himself? Will he drift away if their days of danger together are subdued to accommodate an invalid detective?
“Actually, Bee, that ones for your eyes, but I’m sure we can set up a very interesting taste experiment for you with samples from our takeway tonight.”
“You were describing the return of your memories. A feeling of unease, discord with Mary.”
John ran a hand over it self-consciously, marveling at the
“You will be. Now, sit.” He pushes Sherlock gently onto the bed, propping him up against all the pillows and planting a soft kiss on his forehead. He hands him the cold cup of tea and leaves the bag of pastry within reach. “When your stomach has settled, try to eat a little something.”
Sherlock scowled. “Don’t you? It’s a natural order, like the law of reflection you told me about.”
“We expected this,” John whispers.

John is curled onto his side and half asleep when Sherlock finally slides under the blankets of their bed, fitting into the negative space behind knee and curve of spine. In a gesture that has become automatic, he wraps his arm around John’s belly, chin nestled over his soft cranium. John gives an appreciative wiggle at his presence before beginning to snore softly.
“No, dear, they have since left. I was just a way-spot, the city

“Of course. And if the results are not as anticipated…” Mycroft trails off.

a reason I keep him around, Mycroft.” He scrubs at his face, the exhaustion of the past several days beginning to creep into his vision. “We had prepared for that contingency. I had not expected to need it…” he trails off in a whisper.
“So worried you’d beat him, then dose him into a bloody coma?”
There is a soft click, then a man’s gasp.
“He won’t.”
“Sorry,” John croaks quietly, sniffling.
John thumps past him quickly to the bedroom, eyeing him approvingly in a new dark suit. He’d had to buy it one size larger than usual to accommodate an increase in flesh John says is still only a half-step above
“Sherlock! Get me out of here!” His voice pitches high, cracks as the skull drops from his fingers into the water which is now just below his waist, the cold of it biting into his legs and wracking his body with shivers. He wraps his arms around himself and paces in the small circle the chain allows. This lunatic may have more than short-term suffering in mind for him.
“John, if my limited experiments indicate anything, it is that your close proximity to me was very effective in reducing your agitation during REM sleep. I should like to test this hypothesis further.”

He is baffled by this fierce, protective affection. What should he do? From somewhere in his mind palace Molly shouts,
Due to the highly-secure nature of the facility, there were no windows in the comfortable, if claustrophobic, back seat of the car. After an hour of driving, even Sherlock had lost track of the turnings. John had tried to make him sleep, then failing that, tried soothing him, drawing him out with little teases, even goading him into deducing previous passengers by the state of their compartment. But nothing got through the shell he’d pulled up around himself. Sherlock sat balled up, locked in his mind palace until the car finally slowed to a stop.
Mycroft waves his hand dismissively.

Sherlock scowls at him while he chews a huge mouthful of scone, confused. Mycroft folds his arms over his rain-spattered shirt and gives his sulking brother a long, aggrieved look.
Sherlock surges up from the sheets, startling him. John quickly catches the sliding laptop and tries not to spill half his tea onto the bedclothes as Sherlock takes his face in his hands and kisses him with a thirst. After a long, tangled moment of tongues and lips, Sherlock rubs his nose against his. John sucks in a breath, blinking with a dazed grin.
hold had just released him. He limped Sherlock across the room, easing him onto the long, walnut-colored sofa which was oddly draped with a clean, white sheet. It clenched his heart to see Sherlock all but crumple onto the cushions, his eyes sliding shut, breath wheezing. Gently, he eased off the man’s scuffed, narrow-toed boots.
The rest is the same, with a few minor fixes.
Sherlock thought of the murders William had mentioned and shivered. As if it wasn’t bad enough just trying to get around as a halfblood.
While packing up her lab, the soon-to-be-Queen had gone into a dark, destructive rage, smashing intricate apparatus and months of failed experiments. A shelf filled with jars of extracted wild magic crashed into her cluttered work table. The grieving Princess watched, shocked, as bolts of bright violet-white energy erupted from the shattered glass, rocketed through the clockwork mechanisms, and spun them into frenzied life.
“John!”
“I hope they’ll be alright,” Sherlock said quietly. “The Telekinetic who minds them was a good enough person, he never beat them, but I do hope they make it back to their native India one day. They were so hopeful for my escape.”
Her grey eyes flashed. “Through the work of many spies, we have learned
they were memories. The bed has certainly been occupied by two, and glancing down at his chest he confirms John’s love bites are truly there.
John’s rage simmers into a dull misery as he reflexively bobs, treads, gasps, submerges, bobs. He's right, of course.
“If I do… how do I know you’ll keep your word?”
His voice chokes. He turns and pulls at his hair, face crumpling. Suddenly all of his rage evaporates, leaving behind a thin, worn, sad boy.
“Ridiculous, trying to afford a flat in London. Just barely scraping enough together to keep mine, and it’s a dismal little box of a thing compared to this.”
“You sure you don’t want me to stay? I could assist, let you focus on John, be on hand.”
She had travelled by zeppelin, zebra-drawn caravan, and deep-sea canoe. John raptly read a detailed account of her time as a young woman on a continent he had never even heard of –

long ago.
“And we brought you a hopper bean! Just for you!” Sherlock reverently held out the plant for John. Their eyes met, crinkling into knowing smiles. John ceremoniously squeezed the little pod and they all cried out as it sprung into a perfect projectile, the seed flying up over their heads.
John frowned. “I’m hardly the norm.”
you may want to see to the rather large mess we’ve diffused for you.”
“Just rest now, I’ll do what I can to keep you warm.” Sherlock sounds exhausted as the adrenaline of his rescue ebbs away.
Sherlock’s eyes snap open and his head flies up.
The aggressor was shorter than Sherrin. He visualizes the attack, the trajectory of his fall. With a quick glance over his shoulder to verify that his parents are distracted, he twitches up the blankets to study Sherrin’s left knee and thigh. Also vividly bruised from where he must have landed.
Sherlock leaves shortly after breakfast to take advantage of the good weather and see to the hives. After a few hours’ good labor, he returns from his beekeeping, sweaty and contented, to find John and Melissa in the topiary, Bee on a blanket in the grassy shade working on her downward-dog. She pushes up onto tiptoe with pudgy limbs, then clambers into a standing position using John’s knees as he chuckles at her and snaps photos with his phone.
John blinked with astonishment at the random list of perfectly accurate facts. Awe and incredulity wrestled in his mind. Kinsey could have divulged some of it, certainly, but

He abandons the oil on the dresser and gently removes Sherlock’s socks and trousers, rolling him over to unbutton the too-tight shirt that had looked so lovely with his eyes tonight. “Never done this bit before,” he says out loud. “Must try it again when you’re
Sherlock was on his feet, pulling John by the hand, toppling over the stools. He yanked up the side of the tent, John following on his heels, grinning at the sheer insanity of what he was doing. He squinted into the sudden brightness of the afternoon and immediately knew something was wrong. The mumble-jumble of the circus’s voice was tinged with alarm. From nearby, John heard the trumpet of an elephant.
He’s just turned off the heat to the cream sauce when the soft tone chimes in his ear. For an instant, all of his nerves fire, but he breathes long and deep, controlling it. He thinks back briefly to when he had stood before Mangusson’s security camera, audacious and high on the thrill, the game of it, proving to Sherlock he could not be left behind.
“–I do.”
“Partners.”
“Edwin.”
“Whole, unscathed, mind and body intact.”
“I’m sorry,” John said in a small, appeasing voice. “There should be a story about the troll that saves foolish humans who go falling into his river.”
Thank you all for your patience, curiosity and comments!
“Nursery, John. For your baby.”
“You should hear my Smaug.”
His reverie popped as Sherlock breathed in deeply, waking, rolling over and nuzzling close to John, eyes still closed.
“Is that what we are? Boyfriends?”
Sherlock pushes a pair of new walking boots into John’s hands as he bustles by with a water-bladder that straps to one’s back, a tube snaking down from it to make drinking easy on the go. John shakes his head, still nonplussed, but obediently ties on the boots and takes an experimental walk around the flat.
me. Did she manipulate that?”
“Delicacy is my specialty, brother mine.”
He thinks of the lazy afternoons when they’d loll around the flat, reading through the papers over a long breakfast and mugs of tea, just saying whatever came to mind or nothing at all. He misses those days with a painful longing. He thinks John does, too.

As the buzz of magic pulsed between their skin, John gasped. A tiny purple flicker of lightning snaked around their fingers, fizzling out with a pop. An effervescent wave of tingles rushed down his arm and across his body, crackling in his hair. He saw the medium shiver as tiny sparks burst from his curls like embers popping in a bonfire.

Sherlock clears his throat, rubbing at his eyes again.
Such a thing was almost unheard of.

John blinks, his confusion shifting to curiosity. “Well then.” He licks his lips. “You do seem to know what I like.”
John glanced at him, but Sherlock pointedly stared straight ahead.
“I know, it’s awful. But, he’s okay, they say he’ll pull through…. Yea, if you want to come, that’d be… good. I need to stay here a while, you understand… yea… Yea. Love you, too.”
He scowls. How could John sleep after such a seismic shift in their relationship? Sleep is the farthest thing from
“Additionally John, your first responder information is sorely outdated. Studies have found that skin-to-skin contact is not as effective in increasing body temperature during hypothermic shock as when the victim is encouraged to shiver to a normal internal temperature in warm, dry conditions. I’m a poor replacement for a hot water bottle, but I’ll do my best.”
It strikes Sherlock suddenly that Mycroft must feel that way, too. They sit in awkward silence, the rain falling gently. Sherlock feels an uncomfortable rush of emotion as cracks appear in the solid armor he’s held up for years against Mycroft’s austere and haughty form of brotherly love.
“I didn’t want to admit it, but it seemed like the only plausible explanation.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and lightly placed the fingertips of one hand to John’s temple.
“My hole may seem impenetrable, but it’s not a
The well feels like it’s shrinking in around him, the sensation of being buried alive making his breath rapid and shallow. He tries not to think of how much deeper the water might be if the child’s bones had not helped him hold back the flow.
“And what am I?”
“Right again. I’d have given you the whole of it, excepting my outstanding debts.”
William thoughtfully chewed a large bite of toast, then took a long draught of tea. To Sherlock’s surprise, their accommodating host frowned and shook his head. “Sorry, no, not here. You’re to be movin’ on post-haste. You’ll be in a proper haven soon enough, much more set up for healin’ and the like.”
, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock interjects a little defensively from where he’s leaning on the doorway, watching the scene unfold with amusement. “I fed him adequately for his condition.”
for him. Covered him in a cocoon of leaves. Sherlock had felt genuinely safe for the first time in years, and he must have slept, because John had woken him, frantic, his thoughts screaming into Sherlock’s mind:
“Airborne skin application, penetration up to twenty feet. Any part will do, though it works more quickly the closer it is applied to the skull. No discernible marks at entry. It can also be diffused as a single concentrated burst in a crowd as an inhaled vapor. The effects are reduced at the edge of its range. A single dosage will render the recipient quite forgetful of the occurrences taking place.”
It’s horrific, but it’s, well, I feel incredibly fortunate to get this glimpse of you so young. I imagine not many people have heard this tale.”
“Well, alright. But you text me if
A bloom of red pain surges through the fog and he’s gasping, drifting. Nope, no dream, this, and Christ but they’ve been odd. Clowns. Prisons. Mad sisters. Wells. Must be the morphine. And that’s a great idea, really. He’s pushing through the fog, missing it a bit already as he’s peeling his leaden eyes open, bits of himself coming into focus. His parched mouth, aching ribs. His hand weakly fumbles for the pain drip he knows will be within reach.
Beyond the tiny, darkened window, the countryside blurs past. The hum and sway of the train is making John yawn, stretched out as he is on the upper bunk of their tiny two-berth compartment. Sherlock occupies the entirety of the bunk below him, still fully clothed, laptop balanced on his belly, typing rapidly. John leans over the side slightly to see him better as they talk.
couldn’t make your own as well.”
Sherlock frowned.
Mycroft rolls his eyes and turns away, striding back to his room. Sherlock, suddenly realizing his doorway is empty, pounds over to it and slams the door shut, locking it. He turns blazing eyes on his bookshelf, his thoughts a maelstrom that settle on a single horrible fact.
“I got there, eventually.”
“Yes, precisely. We have to stop intercepting her. Now.”
Sherlock smiles and kisses his brow.
“Debatable,” John muttered. “Sherlock nearly drowned. That we’re here at all is thanks to William, but you can see the state he’s in. I
He finds his violin on the top of her bookshelf and begins to play Brahms. After only a few measures, Rosie sighs the shuddering breath of dream’s end and settles into a deeper, quieter sleep-state. He continues, but the playing become softer, slower, until the last note drifts off into silence. He places the violin and bow back onto her bookshelf and bends over his sleeping daughter’s face, lightly kissing her sweaty brow. She wrinkles her nose in her sleep.
Sherlock’s talking nonsense. But his face, hovering before him, makes John catch his breath. It’s grayish and lined, hollows under his eyes, tear-stained, a solid grizzle of beard darkening his usually sharp, smooth jaw. He looks utterly wrecked. Except that he’s positively glowing with relief. John blinks and blinks.
stop her.”

“Sorry, confidential. You understand.”
“You already spent it all, didn’t you?”
He’d ridden for hours, turning things over in his mind. Watching people. The jostle and rhythm of the car had soothed him into a blankness he’d sorely craved. He might have ridden through the night, or just gone home with takeout and a lame apology, if not for the older couple working a Sudoku diagonal from him.
“Monstrosities,” it snarled. “Didn’t see any fall with you.” It sniffed deeply. “Can’t smell any here now. Not on the water, nor the bridge.”
“Greg,” John soothes, “you’ll be fine.”
“Mary.”
“Observing. Come down and see.”
when he shares their bed, but the ritual of it, the brief cocoon together amidst The Work and being dads, has become too important to give up in favor of a rapidly-solved puzzle.
He’d found his way to the Underground. No place in mind, he just needed to go. Anywhere. He’d done that a lot as a student at Bart’s when he was new to London with little money. The rocking of the cars and anonymity of the crowd had eased the strain of uni. He found he studied better on the trains, though the graphic medical texts did raise eyebrows. It had also been a safe way to look at other young men he wasn’t likely to stumble into again at Bart’s – he’d met more than a few that way.
The fresh air was fiercely cold, such a relief from his stuffy bedroom prison. He whooped loudly, not caring who heard, daring someone to look up and see a boy shooting through the sky.
He thinks he’s probably in shock. His eyes wander over all of the flotsam of his life with Mary.
John opens a new browser tab to read the news. Taking a sip of tea, he scans the headlines quickly, suddenly choking on his swallow.
After the bottle, they’re shown proper burping position and the tiny creature drops into a milk-fed slumber on Sherlock’s chest. John pulls out a soft blanket from the bag and tucks it around them.
Mycroft leads him behind an outbuilding on the hospital grounds near the A&E entrance, the peanut butter Lion bar consumed before they’ve reached it. Sherlock’s not surprised when his brother pulls a trim metal cigarette case out of his pocket and snaps a lighter to one of the thin cigarettes. Mycroft’s clandestine smoking has been painfully obvious to him for years. A plume drifts over him and Sherlock wrinkles his nose.
“The medical staff are all trained operatives.”
“No, she needs you.” John kisses her on the nose. “Hey sweetie,” he hums gently to her. “Feel better? That was a nice nap, let’s do that again sometime, hm? Got a beautiful surprise for you, look who’s back.”                         Sherlock helps him unfasten the carrier and gently cradles her to his own chest, the milky scent of his sleepy baby flooding him with relief. John stands and stretches, neck vertebrae popping audibly, groaning as he arches his stiff back.
“Fine, suit yourself,” John growls. “I know you’re fasting now that we’re back among mere mortals, but at least ring for some tea for me. I’m knackered. A quick bite in and I’ll be out like a light.”
Twice he’s nudged the knots of his shirt-sling up the rope. Sherlock’s been gone much too long and his imagination is beginning to jump to frantic, delirious conclusions: Sherlock’s been captured by Euros and needs John to rescue him; he’s secretly joined forces with Moriarty and they’re watching his demise on camera; The Woman has him at gunpoint. John shakes himself to scatter the ghosts, muttering, “Stop it,
“No, not these trees,” she smiled sadly, “though I have visited them. They are not in pain. They sleep and dream as trees do. It was deeply unjust, but Our Lady and her followers escaped from the King’s prisons and continued their efforts.”
The surgeon had led him through an enormous workroom where the hulking skeletons of one-day gyrocopters were being built. They'd gone through three sets of thick quartz-stone doors inlaid with intricate copper wiring, flanked by increasingly-armed, increasingly clockwork guards. Once within, the surgeon had told Lestrade everything he needed to know to support their Queen in her campaign against the Heathen Faerie.
John reflexively takes Sherlock’s hand, puffing up his chest a little to speed along her assumptions. To his surprise, the woman grins at him, giving him a shy little thumbs-up as she gets off at the next floor down. He smiles a little, then sighs into the silence.
Sherlock touches his skin with hesitant fingertips. “There are small bruises along your ribs. From my hands.” John cranes his head up to look.
but just to get closer to Faerie, not to fight them…” John trailed off awkwardly under her penetrating stare.
,” Sherlock protests as he strides to the coat hook. “It’s elegant. And practical.”
“Not me, idiot,
Whatever John had done to hide all these years, whatever walls he’d innately built around himself, they were gone. Despite his fear, he felt a twinge of relief – Sherlock was still sleeping, safely back in the dome. He suddenly knew it as clearly and simply as he knew his arms ended in his hands. It was just he and their pursuers, and they were only twenty paces away.
The water is nearly at his shoulders. To get the blood moving in his cold limbs, he treads as much as the chain will allow. After a few minutes, he feels certain that the water level has not perceptibly changed.
John nods slowly, digesting this.
“Won’t you miss it?” John asks, his voice rough.
< “I was thinking of Melissa – from the Greek μέλισσα for honey bee. Melissa was a nymph who learned the trick of getting honey from bees. She took care of baby Zeus, but rather than feeding the baby milk, Melissa fed him honey straight from the bees.”
John’s chest heaves and he looks up at Sherlock with pained, watery eyes.
With a bright jingling of bells, she poured fresh kernels and oil into the pot, capped the lid, and curled her fingers around the metal. After a moment, an eruption of pops could be heard inside. She removed the lid with a flourish, calling,
John’s eyes widened as Sherlock’s voice rumbled smoothly into his mind, as clearly as if they were back in the small, dim tent. Sherlock watched him defiantly.
I've been having quite a bit of fun with Victorian floriography in this story (the secret language of flowers "allowing people to express feelings which otherwise could not be spoken") The flower shop is rife with it!! ;D
And then, there was no alley, no fog, no Netters.
Dr. Watson?”
A thin crowd of people straggled along the pavement, oblivious to the two halfbloods who had just materialized below the push-train bridge.
John huffed his relieved annoyance.
Inner Sherlock lists out the symptoms of hypothermia he should be watching for. He’s still shivering violently, which is good, but the exhaustion and clumsiness are bad. He doesn’t have Sherlock’s powers of deduction to know the temperature of the water, or gauge how long he’s been in it by how quickly it’s risen or how much the moon has moved. Realizing his thoughts are getting fuzzy, he doubles up his treading efforts, thinking forcibly of people he should be trying to stay alive for.
“Hello,” Sherlock said quietly, clearly addressing the giant feline.
22.07.93   15:07
“You keep this up and I’ll be forced to distract you in that tiny loo over there,” John quips casually, “and won’t that be a fine way to be found when they come to tell us the babe’s been born?”
The door to the landing clicked shut and silence settled around him. The fire snapped in the hearth, the kettle steamed, dust motes drifted through bands of sunlight. Sherlock’s breathing was deep and even.
Sherlock thought fondly of their first summer here five years ago, when it had been John who had so badly needed the solace of the cottage. Each summer found them back, pottering in the garden, running into the hedge maze after their increasingly mobile daughter, caring for the bees. There was never a question about coming, but some years, like this one, it became too easy to put off.
Merfolk were the only pure Faerie the Queen’s Men ever had encountered. Living in the fluid element of water, the Wall had never meant a thing to them, though they were notoriously shy of humans. Lestrade didn’t know how, but it was rumored the Merfolk brought the halfbloods across the Wall.
“I was. For the record.”
“I admit I have never been very
“There were hints,” she said softly, brushing her fingertips lightly over Sherlock’s neck. “But it wasn’t clear until I saw him. Captivity leaves a mark.”
Sherlock watches his brother’s face, all bruises and swelling. He bites his lip and jams his hands deep into his pockets while he walks.
For her to have lied to him is one poison, but her abuse of Sherlock is another entirely and it sends lances of rage up his limbs. What has she been forcing him to do? Make some kind of a drug? To use on the public? Has she just killed Magnusson? John pushes against the cloudy glass wall to steady himself.
John couldn’t help but grin.
“Jonas Fletcher failed the iron test today,” he whispered to the bird. “I passed.” Johnny frowned, confused by his mixture of grief, relief and aching disappointment. “It shouldn’t have been him,” he said more loudly than he’d intended. Startled, the starling flew off to join its flock. Johnny watched it go. “I passed.” His eyes prickled and he dug his fingers into the rough bark. “I don’t know what I am.”
“Poor dear,” she whispered. “You’re all bones. Was it very bad, at the circus?”
“Love you.”
“Oh god, poor love. Hope she doesn’t get my ears, too.”
Breathlessly, reluctantly, Sherlock pulls away from their kiss to better understand why John isn’t in his lap, only to see his rakish grin.
The parson had droned on and on, the same old story Johnny had heard every Sunday. Just when it seemed the Godly humans would win with their Five Blessed Magics, the Faerie had created a mighty magical Wall with their wild spells and sealed themselves behind it. Humans had been trying to break it down ever since.
John smiles shyly. “It’s… well, it’s our story.” And with a quick clearing of his throat, almost as if he’s nervous that if he doesn’t start immediately he’ll lose his courage, John begins.
“The ambulance–” John blurts out. “I remember you in the ambulance. So that part wasn’t a dream. You were…” John’s voice trails off because he remembers Sherlock had been holding his hand tightly while the paramedics worked on him. He’d looked over briefly to see his stricken face. And then more darkness, more...
A much younger Dr. Watson, fresh from his healer training, had tried to outgrow his fantastical obsessions and become a normal, upstanding adult. He’d proposed to a nice girl, a
He swallows hard and nods. “John, I’m so sorry
life.
“I laid next to you in bed and buried my face against your neck, I held you tightly so you’d know in your dream you were safe.”
He recognizes the logo, carved in black marble in the midst of a lit fountain. It’s for that media mogul, what was his name? Magnusson? Sherlock had despised him, going on at length about his web of corruption, avoiding his papers, even referring to him as the
“Are you for real, Sherlock? All that hell we endured, the mad puzzles, the ridiculous court cases, were the work of an insane leader of a
“Looking for a cure,” Sherlock says irritably over his shoulder. “But it was for naught. John woke of his own volition not an hour ago.”
“Mph, wot?” Sherlock frowns deeply, eyes pinched shut. “Leave it, Mycroft,” he mutters. His voice, just on the verge of plummeting into a rumbling base, is a soft alto, thick with sleep and irritation.
Rubbing his hands roughly over his face to focus his attention, he pulls out weathered maps and navigation charts from the chest, each one a key to some moment he saw something in John’s behavior and wondered,
“Sherlock, we were exhausted, as well as pissed,” John says with a sweet smile, handing him his trousers. “You were frankly adorable. I fell asleep against you in moments.”
As he hurried to follow the fiery creature, he realized the glamor was not just illusion, but had weight and texture. It felt like moving about in a slightly ill-fitting suit. “Isn’t this remarkable?” he whispered, but found he was addressing empty space.
John’s face cracks in a grin. “What, a
Please note that things (finally) heat up in this chapter. After waffling back and forth between mature/explicit ratings, I've made some subtle changes to the scene that feel right to me and drift it back closer to the borderlands of mature. This is new territory for me as a writer - I hope you enjoy!
“I think I’m finally ready to share this with you. I thought of giving it to you to read on your own, but it feels better this way, reading it out. We can experience it together.”
“Generally speaking that
“I’m not hungry.”
“Let’s go.”
Some evenings, they walk his gran’s sizable topiary garden, still in top shape. It had been bequeathed to the village and maintained by an eccentric gardener named Eleander. Though they see little of the shy man, he occasionally leaves little gifts for them – a basket of sweet buns on the doorstep, a jar of dill pickles preserved in his kitchen, a wheeled wooden dog that has become Melissa’s favorite teething accessory.
“You too. And you’re right. I am, actually.” John grins.
When I enter my flat, the first thing I do is close all the blinds. I have an unsettling feeling that he is watching me from somewhere out there, and knowing him, he probably is. I won’t give him the pleasure of seeing me have a complete breakdown - because that is what’s about to happen.
John is flabbergasted.
John scrolls and reads carefully, stopping once to ask a question (“What do you mean I ‘change the rules of the universe?’”).
“Dinner reservations, Sherl! Fifteen minutes!”
“DAD!” Rosie is raising her little arms, and Sherlock scoops her up from the pushchair and perches her on his hip.
“Did I?” John senses a distinct sense of danger in Sherlock’s voice, but it’s too late to stop him now. “Well, don’t let that bother you. I’ve found the vast majority of John’s girlfriends to be exceedingly boring.”
We both break off and share a nervous laugh.
Which leads me to the third problem I face when trying to describe him: I did like him. A lot. And most people didn’t, really. I’m acutely aware that most of the things about Sherlock that I found oddly charming or funny or even endearing, almost everyone else found aggravating and off-putting. Again, that probably says more about me, doesn’t it? For example, he had this… ability. He could look at you and tell you everything about yourself. Where you’d been, what your job was, your hobbies, your relationships. Even some of your deepest secrets. To him, those things were just as obvious as your haircut or what colour shirt you were wearing. Most people, understandably, didn’t really like it when he did that. They felt embarrassed, uncomfortable, put on the spot - like they had been stripped naked, and everyone was gawking at them. That would be the normal reaction to having someone spout out all your secrets, usually without invitation to do so. I, on the other hand, was deeply and utterly amazed when he did it to me. It was honestly the most brilliant thing I’d ever witnessed. Instead of being embarrassed, I just wanted more. I wanted to know what else he could read about me by looking at my face, my clothes, my belongings. And I wanted to know how he did it. Not in the sense that I wanted to prove that it was some kind of trick. I didn’t want to call him on his bluff or see what was behind the curtain. I didn’t think it was a trick; I wanted to understand how his brain worked. He told me once that it
We get gloves, rags, and soapy water, and help each other clean up the mess in silence. Things have been different between us the last few months, I muse. Ever since Rosie and I moved back into 221B. Both Sherlock and I have been jumpy and a little awkward around each other, and I catch myself staring at him way more often than I’d like to admit.
“Come on, John. You can tell me.”
As I leave work that afternoon, I don’t go home. Instead, I suddenly find myself once again on that rooftop. I can’t really remember how I got here, but I’m sitting on the ledge, not quite close enough to the edge to be in any real danger of tumbling off, but still close enough that I can peek over it and see the tiny people on the street below.
John moves another step closer and takes Sherlock’s hand. “Don’t be stupid. I know I would be upset if you made a list like that about me.”
But the reply comes almost right away:
“I know... It’s okay.” Sherlock is still panting slightly, and the look on his face reveals that it’s decidedly
“And who is this?” Jeanette asks, looking at Rosie. Right. Jeanette is a teacher - likes children.
Here is the long-overdue epilogue, as promised.
Sherlock has that air of nonchalant superiority about him that I know from experience can be absolutely infuriating when it’s directed at you. “I didn’t do anything,
Sherlock looks around him for something to pass the time, but suddenly nothing seems interesting or important. He goes to the bathroom and takes a very long shower, which mostly consists of standing with his eyes closed, his forehead leaned against the cool bathroom tiles and letting the slightly too hot water drum against his back.
He is soon forced to conclude, however, that a lot of the advice is exceptionally stupid (“be bold but don’t come on too strong” - what does that even mean? Normally he might ask John about that, but in this case, he obviously can’t; “Watch your spelling and grammar” - well, that should be obvious to anyone!).
This honestly terrifies Sherlock, and it’s not just because talking about his feelings makes him uncomfortable. His feelings for John scare him, and after he started the experiment it has become increasingly difficult for him to keep them under control. If he were to reveal those feelings to John, and if indeed that resulted in the two of them initiating a romantic relationship, what would that look like? Sherlock isn’t entirely convinced that he is suitable for that sort of thing, and John… Well, John is good, and kind, and generous, and caring - doesn’t he deserve to be with someone who are all those things too? Can Sherlock be those things? He isn’t entirely convinced himself. As a matter of fact, he suspects that he would fall short. That he would mess everything up and hurt John, make him miserable.
just a trick. That he’d looked me up and discovered everything about me beforehand. But I don’t believe that’s true.
Sherlock lets him go and takes a step back, crossing his arms and frowning stubbornly. “Well, you shouldn’t. And you know that.”
Arguments against dating John Watson:
The reply comes about 30 seconds later:
Afterwards, he sends another text.
“You didn’t think I would what? Take it so bad? God, for a genius you really are thick. I was forced to watch my best friend commit suicide! You were dead, Sherlock; I saw you die! How would you have felt if
In conclusion: Sherlock is now quite certain that Lestrade
doesn’t feel inclined to spend the next couple of hours looking through missing artefacts reports himself.
I think of some of the countless times someone has mistaken us for a couple. I always get annoyed and protest. Sherlock, I suddenly realise, never says anything. Sherlock, the obnoxious arsehole, who usually loves correcting people when they’re wrong, and who doesn’t care if he hurts anyone’s feelings in the process. Never a word.
“Yeah, ta,” he says and awkwardly runs his hand through his hair, trying to straighten it a bit. “You too. It’s eh- nice to see you.”
I lose my patience. “Look, I’m sorry for the way I reacted, I’m sorry for pushing you away. I got… scared, I guess. And confused. But I need to know for sure, Sherlock, please!” I repeat that last part a little lounder and more firmly this time.
“It’s a date.”
I swear under my breath. This is all too much. All these confliction emotions are making my head spin. Either way, I cannot lose him again. I need to try to salvage our friendship, at least.
“Sorry,” John laughs, scratching the back of his head. “She just threw a bit of a tantrum. She’s not usually this quiet.”
Greg pats him on the back and tries but fails to suppress a burst of laughter. “The heart wants what it wants, I suppose.”
And there’s something else. Something that Sherlock would rather not admit to himself. He’s feeling a tinge of doubt. Because
He hesitates for a moment, then turns over and picks up his phone from the nightstand.
He continues to lie awake for maybe 20 minutes longer. Still no incoming texts, and John finally manages to doze off. Meaning that he doesn’t see Sherlock's reply until he wakes up a few hours later:
Anyway, as if that wasn’t enough, Sherlock has been texting him. A lot. Up until a few days ago, they’d occasionally have a short back-and-forth, that wasn’t necessarily strictly confined to the exchange of vital information, but this is something else. Dare he say that Sherlock seems to be… flirting with him? Some of their exchanges seem to be downright suggestive. Not that he minds. As a matter of fact, he’s pretty excited about it.
“You haven’t. I should be thanking you for reminding me that this was an ill-conceived idea from the start.”
successful - in the sense that not only has he managed to apparently confirm John’s affection for him; he has himself become completely consumed by the whole thing in only a matter of days. In fact, the texting has become Sherlock’s new favourite pastime, and truthfully, it has gone far beyond just being an experiment (or maybe it never really was one?). Sherlock didn’t realise how much he had missed being able to talk to John whenever he wants (Billy the skull really isn’t as good a replacement as Sherlock has been stubbornly claiming).
John buzzes for the next patient. A two-year-old. Bronchitis.
“I’m making tea. Do you want some?”
“Just standing there looking like that.”
John sighs and leaves the men’s room, feeling no better than he did before. He takes the longest possible way to the vending machine – Sherlock usually takes forever when he’s at the lab, so he isn’t in a hurry. Today, however, turns out to be an exception. When John returns to the lab, there is no sign of Sherlock. John rolls his eyes and sighs, then calls out a few times and has a look around to make sure. He soon discovers that Sherlock’s blazer, which had been thrown over the back of a chair, isn’t there anymore. So that’s it, then. He’s definitely gone. John checks his phone, just to be sure, but as expected, there are no messages.
The unbelievable magnetism that Sherlock has always held over him has reached hitherto unknown heights in the past few days. As if it wasn’t enough that he is already spending every unoccupied hour of almost every day with Sherlock - most days it’s the couple of hours between getting off work and having to pick up Rosie; the nursery teachers all hate him, as he is, of course, perpetually late, because you can’t just spend a couple of hours with Sherlock, now can you? To regain some goodwill, when a case seems fairly harmless - or when there isn’t one - he’ll pick up Rosie early instead and bring her along.
When around 10 pm John announces that he should probably go pick up a hopefully-sleeping Rosie from Harry’s, there is a short moment where none of them seem to know what to do. Sherlock supposes that if it had actually been a date, this would be when they would have kissed. And Sherlock does consider it for a moment; he is surprised to find that he actually
“I don’t want you to change, Sherlock. I like
“Just as I thought,” he says smugly. “Look at this.” He sits up and makes room so that John can sit down beside him and receive the phone in exchange for Rosie, who babbles happily as John hands her over to Sherlock.
“Hold on,” she says. “So, the two of you… you’re a couple?”
“Yes. He does. And whether or not you like him back, I’d probably try to be a bit nicer to him, if I were you.”
him, which is of course equal parts insane and embarrassing. Nothing noteworthy happens all morning, and around lunchtime I conclude that Sherlock actually for once must have decided to respect my boundaries and left me alone as I told him to. Then I’m immediately proven wrong, as I get a text:
I used to hate him for being dead. Now I hate him for being alive. I hate him for everything he has put me through, for leaving me, for coming back, for thinking he can just reinsert himself into my life after he has completely and utterly broken me. And I hate myself for letting him do that to me, and even more for wanting - deep down - to forgive him.
When, after a few more moments, I feel like I’ve regained control of my limbs, I stand and take a step towards him. I hold out my hand. He looks from my outstretched hand to my face, his expression changing from puzzled to curious. Then he hesitantly takes my hand and I pull him to his feet. We are standing so close I can feel his rapid breaths against my face.
He calls out a few times, his voice hazy and raspy, but the house is quiet. He throws his upper body over the edge of the bed to retrieve his phone from the pocket of his trousers, which are still in a pile on the floor where one of them (who exactly it was that did what is somewhat fuzzy) tossed them last night. There are two texts, the first sent about 15 minutes ago, the other one, a few minutes later:
“You left him somewhere again, didn’t you?” Lestrade hides his face in his hand, his tone exasperated and accusatory.
“I believe I just told you not to be ridiculous, Gerald. Caring is not an advantage, and I do not waste my valuable time with trifles like that.”
They order way too much dim sum - especially considering the fact that Sherlock doesn’t really eat anything (he is working on a case, after all). He makes a bit of an effort, though, because he knows John doesn’t like eating alone, and so, he concedes to nibble on some shrimp dumplings. They eat sitting on the floor surrounded by files and takeout containers, drinking a bit too much red wine, making them prone to bickering and laughing, and making the otherwise tedious work seem at least a little enjoyable (but also a lot slower - Sherlock doesn’t really mind). It does feel just like old times, when they were still living together, and there is a sense of relief between them that they can still be together like this. It’s fun and effortless. Sherlock didn’t realise how much he missed this. And he had almost forgotten how John is seemingly the only person in the world that he can have this with.
“No. I’m angry with myself for writing that stupid list in the first place. And for not throwing it away immediately afterwards. I had actually completely forgotten about it.”
Rosie sniffles. “Can I have animal biscuits, daddy?”
John looks apprehensively around the pub, but no one seems to be within hearing distance.
. I want
He soon forgets all about that stupid list.
“A pros and cons list. Pros and cons of getting together with John.” Lestrade is desperately trying to sound casual, but it’s obvious that he has giving this idea some thought.
He looks at me intensely, but still doesn’t say anything.
“That’s, eh… nice. I mean, it does explain a lot.”
“Maybe? Is that weird?”
“Ah,” John shakes his head. “You pickpocketed him.”
. Any ideas?”
. I am simply not a suitable choice for a romantic partner. And I’m not… chances are, I’m not going to change, John.”
He somehow never imagined it would happen here. In his and Mary's house, in the bed they used to share. Sherlock doesn’t really fit in here. It’s all way too normal, way too mundane to match Sherlock’s chaotic otherworldliness. John simply hadn’t been able to imagine him here like this. And yet, here he is, splayed out on the bed beneath him; naked and pale and unfathomably beautiful. Eyes burning and dark hair spread around his face like a halo.
“Well, gotta dash.” John puts on his jacket. Sherlock has followed him to the door and is standing close by - not close enough for it to be uncomfortable, but close enough that John feels his heart flutter a bit. And then John, without really thinking about it, says: “I’ll text you when I get home.”
After washing my hands, I turn around and almost bump into him. We stand there for a moment, suddenly uncomfortably close, and he’s giving me
. Too polite? Too out of character? He hopes John won’t get too suspicious. Or think that he’s been kidnapped and is trying to send some sort of hidden message through coded compliments. He thinks for a moment then decides to just go with it, and types out a response:
“That’s bollocks. And also, not helping.”
“Oh, uuh,” Lestrade suddenly looks a bit embarrassed, scratching the back of his neck. “Well, me, Molly and Harry, if you must know.”
After a few hours, when Sherlock has seen everything he needs to, the two of them head to Bart's to “borrow" some equipment to look at some samples Sherlock has gathered (“It's Molly's day off, so she won’t mind,” Sherlock claims).
Alright, he can do this. He spends the next fifteen minutes trying to compose a good opening text, but then, all of a sudden, John beats him to the punch:
When I get back downstairs, he’s not back yet. I’m still shivering a bit from the cold rain, so I stoke the dying fire and sit down in my armchair. A moment later, Sherlock emerges too, hair still dripping on his fresh shirt, and quietly sits down opposite me.
“Screw you, get it yourself,” John says, failing to sound truly upset. Sherlock, however, crosses his arms and doesn’t move. John sighs and grabs the blazer from the chair. “Here you go, then! Now can we go?”
John blushes slightly and bites his lip.
And I tell them that I love him. This is my truth, and I don’t care who knows it.
“No, it’s alright. It’s been a couple of years now, and, I mean, it is what it is.”
Once there, Sherlock throws his blazer theatrically over a chair - it’s one of the very few days a year where even he has to admit it’s too hot out to wear his coat - and settles himself in front of the microscope with the mummy samples.
Jeanette grins back and they say goodbye.
made a list?!” John raises his eyebrows. “You did, didn’t you? Greg?”
He giggles. “It’s not. I promise.”
“A list?”
Sherlock cocks an eyebrow. “Oh?” This is interesting. It appears their friends have been conspiring behind their backs, and he can imagine what about. He smiles mysteriously – they’re all in for a surprise, then.
). After his shower, he heads downstairs with a towel around his waist and locates his overnight bag, still next to the front door where he dropped it last night.
He feels a quick rush of excitement somewhere in the lower part of his stomach, as he always does these days when Sherlock texts him. Or talks to him. Or does pretty much anything, really, as of late.
One of my ex-girlfriends, Jeanette, accused me of being Sherlock’s boyfriend, rather than hers. Mrs Hudson fully seems to have believed we were a couple, until he faked his death and went missing in action for two years. That is another thing. When I thought I’d lost him, I was broken.
Relief. This is a lot more exciting than anticipated, and he is eager to collect more data.
“Do I what?”
“I’m not. Not by a long shot.”
I smile a little sheepishly, but Sherlock doesn’t even miss a beat. He immediately removes his hand from my back and lets his face transition effortlessly into his “game face”, as he tells us all to come along, and walks across the street with long, determined strides.
Within minutes he has hailed a cab and is being carried through the relatively smooth evening traffic. He settles with his phone on the backseat to resume the conversation, and finds another text from John:
We look at each other in silence for a long moment, and then start speaking at the same time:
Sherlock just stares. “Oh,” he says, after a little while.
The texting experiment is an immense success. If Sherlock’s being completely honest (and isn’t he, usually?), it has been rather
“Uh, widower, actually…”
Sherlock composes another text:
“What kind of problem?”
“Wait. Does it really bother you that I’m short?”
Alright. He feels like he can do those things. He gathers from his research that it’s all about subtext and leaving subtle clues and then observe whether or not the other person picks them up. That really doesn’t seem that different from questioning a witness or interrogating a suspect.
“Eh, no thanks... I just wanted to make sure everything was fine, and that you hadn’t gotten yourselves into any trouble.”
I ignore him, put my phone on silent mode and go back to work.
“If you don’t tell me, I will stop working on this case right now, and I won’t tell you what I found. Good luck getting your trained monkeys to solve it.” Sherlock, of course, doesn’t mention that, in reality, the case is a lot simpler than it seemed - bordering on tedious, actually - and almost as good as solved. He is also relying heavily on the hopes that Lestrade
“Are you sure? Or are you just saying what you think I want you to say?” I try to pierce him with a look. Try to will him to be honest with me. He bites his lip and looks away.
He is searching for the right words. This - emotions, sentiment - really isn’t his area, as he would say. And I know that. It really isn’t mine either, as should be obvious at this point. But I’m not going to let him off the hook.
He goes upstairs, gets dressed in fresh clothes, and starts picking up the ones from yesterday that are scattered all over the bedroom floor along with John’s. When he pulls out his shirt from underneath John’s jeans, a folded piece of paper falls out of one of the back pockets. He knows he shouldn’t, but Sherlock is nothing if not extremely inquisitive (some might say nosy), so he picks up the paper; unfolds it; sees his own name, and now he obviously
was the single most important entry on that list, and you’ve conveniently chosen to ignore it. Yes, there are plenty of reasons why we shouldn’t be together. But it must count for something that I don’t really care about any of them, right?”
“Now hold on just a second.” Greg eyes them suspiciously. “Did you just come out of Sherlock’s bedroom?”
Sherlock throws himself down on the sofa and turns his attention to the phone.
“It wasn’t supposed to take that long. And John, I really didn’t think you would… I… If I had known, I wouldn’t have…”
Sherlock frowns. John knows he rarely thinks about such things. So he reminds him. John is considerate; Sherlock (mostly) isn’t. But John doesn’t mind. He just reminds him. Sherlock is learning, though, as evidenced by his concern for John’s sleeping pattern. John makes him want to be more considerate.
“Well, I’ll endeavour to do that more often, then.” We both laugh. We’re still standing wonderfully close, my hand resting loosely on the back of his neck, his hand - I suddenly realise - planted firmly on the small of my back. Our eyes are locked together, not noticing the snow which continues to fall all around us.
Greg snatches the phone from his hand and eyes him suspiciously. “What did you do?”
“Uhm, hey. You remember Jeanette, right?” He gestures at her, having honestly forgotten for a moment that she was there. He’s starting to understand why she broke up with him.
They spend a long time just kissing and laughing and teasing each other; staring at each other and carefully touching each other’s naked skin, as if they almost can’t believe they’re really here; together.
New Google search:
Mission: Johnlock is not going as well as planned. Molly and Harry try to stop Greg from giving relationship advice.
“Oh, please,” Sherlock says in his most annoyingly Sherlockian voice, finally leaving the microscope and walking towards him. “You’ve been on edge all afternoon, you are unusually concerned about losing our reservations, and you have been toying nervously with that ring box in your pocket for over an hour. Doesn’t take a genius.”
look at the samples with his microscope at home, but Bart’s has a new electron microscope that he’s been dying to try, and Molly isn’t there to scold him for playing around with her equipment, so it’s the perfect day to go to there. John comes along, obviously, although he can’t really contribute much.
“Uh, yes, I… Something came up…” Sherlock turns his eyes down and clearly tries to make his face look neutral and relaxed. He doesn’t quite succeed.
She clearly doesn’t know what to say to that. John - who had just for the briefest moment been so proud of Sherlock for almost acting like an actual human being from planet Earth - rolls his eyes and sends her a look that he hopes comes across as apologetic. “Yes, thank you for that assessment, Sherlock. Would you mind taking Rosie inside and maybe get started on that snack? I’ll be there in a sec.”
Just then, there’s a knock on the door downstairs, followed by the sound of Mrs Hudson letting in a grumbling Greg.
“Idiot,” I mutter. My cheeks are a bit wet. I think his are too. So much for being the good Englishman.
When Sherlock wakes up the next morning, John isn’t there.
undeniably likes John. He can’t be sure if this is good or not.
“Look, John, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have…”
Sherlock responds with a non-committal “hm”.
Lestrade swallows. “No, Sherlock. He
he likes John back. He has been aware of these feelings for a very long time and has long ago decided not to do anything about it. He has always been absolutely sure John didn’t - couldn’t - reciprocate his feelings. It seems impossible. But what if Lestrade is telling the truth? Sherlock is aware of the delicacy of situations like this; there are a lot of things to consider. He doesn’t want to jeopardise his friendship with John. But he also wants to find out more.
“No harm in trying,” Greg says with a wink and then gets up to leave. “I’ll give you some privacy.”
… in the interest of balance. I couldn’t think of anything else...”
“Yes, I… I got your texts,” he mutters. “Seemed… urgent.”
s, each of them causing a pleasant buzz to run through his veins.
I wait for another few minutes, and then I can’t take it anymore. I get up and grab my jacket, then quickly go to knock on Mrs Hudson’s door to ask her to keep an ear on Rosie, who is asleep in my bedroom upstairs. She doesn’t mind, of course.
“Hardly my fault he isn’t able to keep up,” Sherlock says defiantly and starts walking again. He is feeling annoyed; at Lestrade for wasting his time with trivialities like tact and good manners, but also - deep down - at himself. John would never leave Sherlock behind, and Sherlock knows how it bothers John when he does that. He cannot help but feel a bit guilty about it. There it is again: The caring lark; sentiment; consideration. His past self would have found it aggravating. His current self - post-John Sherlock - just finds it a little confusing. It scares him, the way John seems to be able to toy with his emotions, even when he isn’t there. He feels like it leaves him vulnerable and exposed.
“Where’s John?” Lestrade asks Sherlock for the second time that day, as he leads Sherlock down a hallway.
“You’re mad. Sherlock doesn’t… feel that way about people. Married to his work and all that.”
I haven’t forgotten how that embrace on the rooftop felt. And I haven’t forgotten the kiss in my hair. I also haven’t stopped loving him, although for a while I still don’t quite understand what that means.
“Sherlock?” My voice comes out croaky and almost inaudible. I clear my throat and try again, but no reply. I finally manage to pull myself up from the floor and go to check the sitting room; he isn’t there. Not in his bedroom either. Everything is quiet, except for the rain drumming on the windows. So he must have left.
I come by and visit him more and more frequently. More often than not, that leads to me getting wrapped up in some case he is working on. I start writing on my blog again.
“Incompatible?” Realisation hits John like a punch in the face. “Oh, okay. So, what, it’s because I’m not… I’m not good enough for you, is that it? I mean, I guess I can’t argue with that. Who could possibly live up to
Sherlock cracks his knuckles and opens up several tabs with pages that look promising.
Second of all, Sherlock really was a person who defied all description or explanation. He was the very definition of a paradox: He prided himself in not caring about others, in being cut off from emotions and sentiment completely, yet he could be extraordinarily fragile and sensitive at times. Not that he would let anyone see that - but I saw it, nonetheless. He appeared to be very concerned with his looks, usually sharply dressed in expensive suits and with perfectly styled hair, except sometimes he didn’t seem to care at all. He once arrived at Buckingham Palace wrapped in a sheet. He valued nothing more than his ability to think and make logical decisions, yet on a regular basis he’d throw himself into physical danger without thinking at all about the consequences. He knew how to behave properly and be conventionally charming and polite, he just chose not to be. He was never trying to make people like him, because he didn’t really care if they did. I guess I was the exception to that rule. Because now, knowing him and looking back to the first few times we met, I can see that he really was trying rather hard to make me like him - in his own slightly twisted way. And it worked, which - to be honest - probably says just as much about me as it does about him.

“Greg!” Greg hisses. “John, get your man under control.”
“No trouble here,” John says.
It’s perfect, really. Texting is so much easier than talking - you have all the time you need to formulate the perfect reply, and the other person cannot see your embarrassing involuntary physical responses. This, of course, also comes with the downside of not being able to observe John’s physical cues, but maybe that is a blessing in disguise. After all, Sherlock
The reply is almost instantaneous:
So now, when John wakes up in the morning, he checks his phone; when he’s on the tube on his way to work, he checks his phone; at work, between patients - check phone; lunch break - check phone; on his way to Baker Street - check phone (even though they will be seeing each other in ten minutes anyway); on his way to pick up Rosie - check phone (even though they just saw each other); making dinner - check phone. And so on. You get the picture. John suddenly has a new-found understanding of the teenagers whose eyes seem to be permanently glued to their devices. If whomever they’re texting (or DM’ing, or facebook’ing or whatever it is they’re doing) is even half as captivating as Sherlock, at least - but he seriously doubts it.
a genius, and that no one can ever convince me otherwise. I tell them that he was infuriating, and arrogant, and charming, and hilarious. That he was truly fascinating to be around, and that I am honoured to have been his friend and to have been involved in his work. I tell them that I miss our adventures. All of that is true, but it isn’t the whole truth.
He goes to the kitchen, rummages around for a bit, makes two pieces of toast. Eats them while frowning at the clock on his phone, trying to will it to move faster, but it only seems to move even slower under his gaze.
A moment’s panic after pressing ‘send'. Too much? “Don’t come on too strong”.
“I know.”
“I assume ‘snores sometimes’ is in that same category, and then there’s really nothing left. One of the remaining three isn’t even about me, and the last two aren’t really disadvantages at all, are they?”
“So- the two of you...?”
from his phone still in his hand. There’s a moment's excitement, as he thinks the text must be from Sherlock, but it turns out to be from Greg:
His shoulders relax a little. “That’s… a relief. Thank you for saying.”
“Isn’t it password-protected or...” John starts, but at the sight of the look that Sherlock shoots him over the top of the phone, he course-corrects: “Ah, right. Sorry, never mind.”  He had apparently forgotten who he was talking to for a moment.
Rosie doesn’t say anything, she just glares (John is convinced she learnt that from Sherlock - it looks suspiciously like what John sometimes refers to as his death glare, usually reserved for unfortunate police officers, Mycroft (obviously) and occasionally John, when he asks Sherlock to clean something, or put on pants, or behave because Rosie has a playdate (that last one only happened once; not a success - John has made sure all future playdates take place either at the park or at the other kid’s house)).
John sighs again and decides to just go home, but just then there’s a
“No, that won’t be necessary.”
“So confused.”
Google search:
His texts repeat themselves over and over again but get increasingly distressed over the course of the following days.
“Yes,” he says, looking up again to meet John’s confused look. “I will marry you.”
He considers smoking a cigarette but decides against it. John would be able to smell it. Not good.
John just hums another content “mmmh,” and slides his hand up the back of Sherlock’s shirt while trying to unbutton his trousers with the other.
“I’m not. I think. But Sherlock doesn’t really count, does he? He defies all logic - he’s like a creature from another planet, sent to Earth to cause massive sexual confusion.”
that he might have done that pissed Lestrade off? He can’t entirely rule it out - he can think of at least a dozen recent occurrences that might qualify - all completely unreasonable, of course; people are so sensitive.
Immediately followed by another one:
He thinks he hears John say something, but he is already so absorbed that he doesn’t answer.
“You won’t resent me?” he asks in a very tiny voice. “You won’t… run for the hills?”
To make matters worse, his relationship with this particular ex didn’t end on the best of terms, although it’s been a few years, and so, hopefully, there are no hard feelings. John hasn’t forgotten, however, that Jeanette was the one who broke up with him partly because she claimed he was a better boyfriend to Sherlock Holmes than he was to her. Which, in hindsight, was probably true. The fact that Sherlock really
Sherlock, of course, doesn’t apologise when he finally catches up with him. He is completely absorbed in looking through the police databases based on something or other he apparently found when looking at the samples from the crime scene and muttering about mummies and Egypt.
John eyes the notepad suspiciously for a moment. Then he sighs, takes the pen and writes:
I feel him press a soft kiss against the top of my head. I don’t protest - it doesn’t feel wrong or weird.
They also still don’t talk
“Sherlock?” I gasp, suddenly aware that breathing might be advisable. I don’t have time to say anything else, because in a fraction of a heartbeat he has moved in closer again. I feel him lean over me and then his lips are on mine. It feels as if a shockwave is shooting through my body, and it takes several seconds for me to realise that I’ve closed my eyes, and let my lips, my tongue, my breath move with his in some sort of instinctual reciprocation. I panic. What am I doing? What are we doing?
“Mrs Hudson let me in,” Lestrade explains. “She seemed to be in an unusually good mood, but wouldn’t tell me anything. I’ve been trying to get in touch with you and John for days – you had us all worried for a moment there.”
people flirt. Both with him (i.e., The aforementioned Woman for example), and with others (mostly John, whose attempts he has always found to be a bit awkward, but surprisingly often seem to be successful). He feels confident that he needs to find some sort of compromise between doing it in a way that “normal” people (i.e., John) will find attractive, while not straying too far from his own personality. Anything else would probably make John uncomfortable and/or suspicious.
“Shit,” John doesn’t quite know how to respond. “Sherlock… that is both the nicest and the most terrifying thing anyone has ever said to me.”
It’s a long conversation between Greg, Molly and Harry.
There he is. Looking completely like himself; curly hair, dramatic coat, and all. And very much alive.
. But now he thinks he is starting to understand. Because
Sherlock’s face changes rapidly from defiance to utter confusion. The conversation is obviously not going the way he was expecting. “You’re not angry with me for reading it?”
I sigh and roll my eyes. Then type:
I need to know what’s going on in his head.
– absurd, illogical metaphor, but it feels appropriate, nonetheless) when John texts him back:
“So you might?”
Sherlock is in the middle of composing a mock-outraged answer about the notion of being “posh”, when there’s another incoming text, which makes him abandon the one he was writing:
Sherlock’s expression softens at the sight of John’s distress. “Sorry,” he mutters, wrapping his arms around John and pulling him close. “I was not going to say anything, but you seemed so nervous. I thought that maybe the evening would be more enjoyable with that out of the way.”
When, after about an hour, Sherlock grows tired of the complete idiocy of the Metropolitan Police and is yearning for someone slightly less incompetent to talk to, he does send John a text.
more or less brought me back to life. I don’t tell them that I sometimes hate him for being dead; for having left me behind in this world, which is utterly dull and miserable without him in it. I don’t tell them how many times I’ve snuck up to the rooftop of St Bart’s Hospital where he died, and stood - for just a moment - dangerously close to the ledge, considering if I should just go ahead and follow him.
