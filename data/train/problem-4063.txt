When he remained silent, unsure of what to say, Cas spoke up, “Unless...” Dropping his gaze, he fiddled with the torn edge of his menu. “Unless there’s someone else." His eyes flicked up to Dean's. "
He almost gave in, almost returned to the bar and found Dean. But he forced himself to keep walking to his truck. He opened the cab door, then hesitated, dreading the thought of lying in the sleeper alone.
He kept his mouth shut throughout the rest of dinner. Zara answered Sam’s questions about her kingdom, about the community the Djinn had created in the mountains, hidden from humans. According to her, it was “Heaven on Earth.”
“How could you—” He glared at Benny, fingers gripping his blade. Benny had the audacity to smirk and Castiel took a step forward—
Black saliva sprayed on him, and he flinched, arms shaking as he tried to keep the gleaming teeth from sinking into him and swallowing him whole.
Dean nodded again. “Right.” He grabbed a takeout menu on the nightstand and started flipping through it. “You wanna get food now? I’m starving.”
“Yeah. Uh. A kid. Well, he’s probably. Probably gone now. Hoping maybe I got a few grandkids or something.”
Dean tensed, hoping Cas wasn’t hurt by the comparison, but Cas didn’t look offended. “Sounds like her.”
Benny laughed. “Can’t bite you if they don’t have a head.” The venom made his ears ring and his legs buckle. Barely managed to obscure himself in some brush before he lost consciousness. Lucky no other creepers stumbled upon him while he was out. Felt nauseous for days after.
“Dude, seriously?” Dean protested as Cas handed an Oreo McFlurry back to Jack, who excitedly held out his hands. “That’s a disaster waiting to happen.”
The forest seemed darker when he opened his eyes, had to let them adjust to the murk. Benny fiddled with a piece of bark between his fingers. Turning his head, Castiel studied Dean’s soul. Stunningly bright here, surrounded by such filth. Whereas his grace cowered in this place, its environment too oppressive to curl and coil freely, Dean’s soul thrived, cut through the pervasive gloom. Made Castiel jealous for such surety.
Dean figured, heading back to his truck. Clanging sounded from a warehouse door being opened, shrill beeps echoing as a truck backed up into the dock. A flock of birds startled from the trees surrounding the shipping center and tipped and swirled in the sky. Once this trailer he’d been dragging got unloaded, he’d park it at the nearest drop yard and say goodbye to the place that had been his home for the last three weeks.
The bodyguard stepped forward, cracking his knuckles, but Zara only laughed. “This is a friendly visit, Dean, I assure you. These items are for Castiel, as part of my dowry.” She brightened, seeing Sam and Cas enter the room. “Sam Winchester, I presume?” She extended her hand. “It is a pleasure to meet you.”
going to run out of excuses soon for why playgroup couldn’t be hosted at their place—an underground bunker with enough weapons to hold off an army.
The staff behind the counter were watching along with everyone else in the restaurant, the once noisy place now brought to tense stillness. Cas snatched up the rest of their food and Dean knew they were already on the verge of getting the cops called on them, but he couldn’t resist turning and jabbing his finger at the little brat. “And don’t you ever fucking touch Jack again!”
Did Dean feel the same way as Benny? Did part of him recoil being close to Castiel? No matter what Castiel did, no matter what he said, he couldn’t fix things between them, only made things worse. All his faux-righteous anger against Benny, all his arguments—all just excuses, his attempts to ignore the truth: a vampire was a better companion for Dean than him.
“He’s nearby,” Hariel said, drawing her wings in tighter to her body. She hated the feeling of claustrophobia that came from being in a vessel, multiplied by this filthy world. Every tree branch seemed to reach out to claw her specifically, ever stone intended to stumble.
“Hey, you eat yet?” he asked, turning back to him. Castiel shook his head. “I’ve got food in my truck, you want some?”
Shifting a little, he focused on the line of Dean’s body against his. Didn’t know if he dared touch him with his vessel now, wrap an arm around him, keep him warm. Settled on what he knew best; protect him unseen.
He started to pull the covers back on the bed, but the thought of lying down with the hunt running on repeat through his head was less than appealing. Cas’ trenchcoat hung bloody on the wall, and Dean clenched his hands into fists to stop them from shaking, adrenaline and nerves still rushing through him.
Castiel could feel the truth of that seeping into his bones, his grace. Still, he held Benny’s gaze in a glare.
Curled up on his side instead, facing away from them. Absentmindedly, he twined his fingers in the grass. His fingers found a stone and wrapped around it.
The sun hovered just over the horizon when Castiel arrived at his pickup location. Pulling into the lot, he parked and went inside to sign paperwork for the new shipment. Wait for the dockworkers to load the trailer, then off to Little Chute, Wisconsin. Two and a half more weeks until his hometime. He never kept counted down the days because there was nothing to look forward to during his time off. Get a motel room for the week, lounge around watching TV and reading, grow increasingly more impatient until he was back on the road.
And not even Purgatory could tamper Dean's capacity for hope. Castiel wanted to believe as Dean did that there was a way out of this place, but it seemed too foolish to hope. What if there was no exit? What if Benny had tricked Dean solely to gain access to his blood—blood he didn’t even need to survive, took only as an extravagance? The worst effect of Purgatory on Dean: forcing him to seek a vampire’s help out of necessity.
“You’re a liar anyway,” Dean said. “If you were doing everything for me, you wouldn’t be putting up a fight about escaping here.”
If he could live fully on Earth, among humans, as an angel. If he could suffuse the empathy and emotion which he’d learned from humans into his true powerful form.
“Stuck,” Jack said, pointing at Dean’s legs and Dean pretended to not be able to lift his legs, sending Jack into a fit of giggles. “Dada, look!” he called, pointing and looking back at Cas.
Dean’s eyes flew open and he pulled away. “Not now, we gotta keep moving, and Cas…” Voice trailed off.
Under the crackle of their footsteps on twigs and leaves, he caught the sound of running water and paused.
“No, I know,” Castiel said quickly. “If this is what you want, you gotta go for it. Don’t, don’t let me change your mind.”
Benny was still talking, and Dean focused back on him, fell into the usual conversation— complaints about delays in loading, route changes, and idiot drivers slowing everyone down. He kept an eye on the door, though, and when he caught sight of Cas leaving, made an excuse as soon as he was able, and left the store after him.
“That makes three of them,” Dean muttered, pushing the accelerator as the light turned green. “We’re gonna end up on some blacklist soon.”
Rolling his eyes, Cas handed back the bag of carrots to Jack. The mess in the backseat of papers and crayons—though stressful—gave Dean an idea.
His thoughts ran in the same circles over and over, but he was finally drifted off to sleep when a thumping noise startled him awake.
How quickly Purgatory had changed Castiel—a good thing or a bad thing? Perhaps neutral. Perhaps he was just tired of thinking.
“Don’t push it.” He caught Cas’ smile in the dark and elbowed him on principle before shifting over to kiss him. Then he tugged at Cas’ arm and turned onto his side, prompting Cas to press close against his back and wrap an arm around him.
“Don’t give me that bullshit, you can bitch and moan all you want, but you’re coming with me. I’m not letting you stay in here to get eaten by a fucking werewolf or whatever and die. I won’t have your blood on my hands, I won’t, I can’t—”
Castiel scoffed. “Penance means nothing to someone who can’t comprehend the value of life. You’re a killer. A vampire.”
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. Fuck him for ever talking about Cas around Bobby. “I don’t know. Probably not.” As an afterthought, he added, “We’re not
The man fixed him with a heavy stare, then proceeded to scan the room. Cas spoke up, “Don’t worry, he’s not a threat.” To the man, he said, “I promise it’s safe in here.”
had an idea of Cas’ true feelings, hadn't he? Much as he’d tried to ignore it, there was always something hovering just under the surface between him and Cas, something that had been threatening to emerge for some time now.
Ever what? Castiel stared at him, then he realized what Benny was insinuating and sat up straighter, pulling his hand from Dean’s hair. “Of course not. I’m Dean’s guardian. I watch over him, my intentions are not so base.”
He met his eyes and Castiel finally found his voice, said, “It sounds like you’ve already made your decision.”
Benny stepped closer, getting into Castiel’s space. Castiel held his gaze, not moving. “You don’t trust me, you can leave. No one’s forcing you to be here.”
She’d called him today, out of the blue, while he was driving. He hadn’t recognized the number when he answered the call, and it had taken him a few seconds to realize who was speaking. Anna sounded tired.
“No, really.” Castiel took a deep breath. “That’s great. That’s, uh, good for you. You’ve been wanting to do something like this for a while, so good for you.”
Dad stared at him for another long moment, expressionless, before turning his journal around and dropping it in front of Sam. “Shut up and make yourself useful. Sooner we figure out what’s killing these folks, sooner we can get out of this goddamn town.”
Turning back to the parade, he met Sam’s eyes. “Never thought we’d both end up here, right?” Sam asked over the noise, attempting levity, and Dean wondered if he remembered sitting outside near a Pride parade, feeling so unsure. There were plenty of other instances to remember, plenty of times John made disparaging comments that Dean either pretended to not hear or agreed with out of a panic that if he wasn’t careful, they might be directed at him next.
“Listen, just.” Dean glanced at Benny over his shoulder. “Just figured if we have a vampire with us, should make sure he’s in top fighting shape.”
Sam was everyone’s favorite. Wasn’t his fault Sam was better at feigning interest in grocery lists and laundry piles. Parenting was hard enough without getting subjected to the unique torture of playgroup small talk.
Or would Purgatory’s harsh savagery slowly infect him? Would his grace weaken and hide, deeper and deeper inside, until it lay dormant, dulled by the oppressive evil that permeated every blade of grass, tree stump, and stone and soon his own skin?
Dean dropped his hand. “Ain’t no thing. You good to keep driving?” Castiel nodded and he said, “You gotta jump right back into it, can’t wait. Don’t psych yourself out.”
“Clown!” Jack yelled, pointing at the entrance to the McDonald’s indoor play area. A Ronald McDonald cardboard cutout guarded the door, holding a sign reading,
And what did Castiel look like to them? Did he seem just a man? Once, he felt as vast as the sky, his vessel a mere limiter. But now his feet tired of walking and his eyes strained from the repetitive sight of trees and brush, dirt and sky. His beard scratched his fingertips when he ran them over his jaw.
He forgot all about it the following day, though, when Sam found a case a few towns over, and Dean and Cas drove over to meet him there. Disturbed gravesites, people disappearing near the cemetery at night. A ghoul, by all signs. A day of morgue visits and interviewing witnesses, then another two days of sitting parked in the cemetery, waiting for the ghoul to emerge again and feed. Dean was almost happy to see the thing when it crawled out of its grave. Almost.
Fetching a six-pack from his truck, he and Cas sat down on the curb behind the trailer, shielded from view of the bar, an orange streetlight buzzing above their head.
“Think you're the best thing that's ever happened to me,” Cas said, pulling away enough to meet his eyes. Dean wanted to ask why, wanted to tell him that wasn’t true, it was too big of a statement, but his head was spinning, from alcohol or something else entirely, he didn’t know. He nodded because he couldn’t speak, and Cas kissed him again, slower this time.
“Buddy, this is great.” He pointed at Cas’ figure, turning the paper so Cas could see. “Looks like he got your true form.” Animals and swirls, colors and shapes.
That last one was easiest. Cas quit driving a few weeks after he did, got a job at a supermarket down the street from the garage, and started taking classes for an associate’s business degree, thought maybe he’d get a job as a dispatch manager one day. A lot of changes, so he and Dean agreed to take things slow between them, not rush into things, and Cas got an apartment downtown alone.
“We are not doing a repeat of earlier,” Dean said before Cas could suggest taking Jack to the water again.
But he knew what Cas meant. Because he couldn’t stop thinking about the time he’d called Cas in the middle of the night to tell him his mom had died. He’d gotten off the phone with Sam and needed to hear Cas’ voice. Had wanted to see him, and he was lucky Cas offered because he couldn’t get the words out.
Dean canted his hips up. “Fuck,” he whispered, opening his eyes, looking down at Benny. Castiel didn’t have eyes for the vampire, had watched numerous couplings over his lifetime, but never felt this way, felt his fingers itch, wanting to
“Hey,” he called, grabbing another book and leafing through it. “You better have remembered to pick up beer and pie because I’m going crazy here.”
After nearly a minute of standing frozen, waiting, Benny lowered his blade, still gripping it tightly. “Must’ve been just a branch falling. Any monster was nearby, they’d attack already. Sure as hell aren’t subtle out here.”
Tensing, Castiel realized his hand had slipped to his own face, running his fingers through his beard. Getting to his feet, he slipped off his shoes, draped his trenchcoat over them, and waded into the water.
“You have to finish your food,” Dean told him. Crossing his arms, Jack glared at him and stomped his foot on the chair.
Had he told Benny? He forgot who all he’d told. “Yeah.” He shifted, resting his bag on the tops of his boots instead of the floor. “‘Bout time. These past weeks have been dragging on.”
“Wait, take one of us together,” Cas said, crouching down by Jack. Jack threw his arms around Cas’ neck, nearly making him lose his balance. They both smiled at the camera, twin grins, and Dean couldn’t help a smile as he took their photo.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m off too, sorry this is weird.” His words were running into each other. “I shouldn’t’ve called.”
“I will, then.” A slow smile spread across his face. “Does this mean we’re BFFs?” Dean groaned, and Cas laughed. “Claire taught me that phrase.”
Castiel nodded quickly. “Right.” He stared at the beer in his hand, rubbed at the logo with his thumb. “I kinda... I don’t know. There isn’t really anyone else I’d wanna drive with.”
“You sure?” he asked, thumbing dirt away from Dean’s neck. Even at his distance, in the dusk, Castiel could see the tense line of Dean’s shoulders. “Don’t gotta if you don't want to.”
“Hope so,” Benny muttered. Castiel hadn’t missed the annoyed looks he’d shot him for hanging back while he and Dean tortured monsters for information. For a time, on Earth, he had sworn off violence, decided he wouldn’t take sides in any fight, too risky, might choose the wrong one again. Unfortunately, his life wasn’t privileged enough to abstain from the constant battles between Heaven and Earth, monsters and humans.
Feeling disoriented, Castiel glanced at the man who had followed Dean into the clearing. “Thank you.” Not a man—a monster, only monsters inhabited this place.
Zara and Cas he found talking in the library, continuing a conversation from last night about agricultural practices in her kingdom. Apparently there was a lot to say on the topic. Last night, before going to bed, Zara had made some cheeky remark about waiting after the official wedding ceremony to consummate her and Cas’ marriage, and Dean had wanted to rip her head off. It only made things worse that apparently Cas wasn’t bothered by that remark, but of course not—Zara liked gardening and was cultured and had given him a million and one presents. There was no real reason to hate her, though that wouldn't stop Dean.
But Dean missed him. He felt the ache of the memory even now as he got in the driver’s seat, went over the paperwork he’d received for his next drop-off. Dean missed him and that thought had carried him through the following weeks, sparked a thousand fantasies in his mind—driving with Dean, sitting in the cab with him, talking in person instead of over the phone or radio, touching him the instant the need rose in his fingertips. Because Dean missed him, and what could happen between them if they never had to miss each other again? If they never had to say goodbye?
“And you?” Cas asked, pulling him from his thoughts. He glanced at Dean as he pushed open the door to their bedroom. “Are you alright?”
Dean's next drop off wasn’t for 48 more hours, so he didn’t have to rush to get there, but he got up early with Cas the next morning. Before Cas hit the road to pick up his next shipment, they walked across the street to where a squat diner stood next to a gas station, the sky above streaked with clouds stained purple from the rising sun.
But then again, he supposed that was Purgatory’s goal: make him one of the monsters which lived out eternity here—worse than monsters, actually. Beings with only one motive: to kill. How Benny had kept some semblance of reason and manners was impressive—not that he wanted to give the vampire any credit. A few more years and Benny would be as voracious as any other monster in this place.
“He’s switched sides,” Sam said as Jack handed him another seashell. “He knows who the winning team is.”
A car approached on his right in the merge lane, then Castiel was yanked from his thoughts, instinctively hitting the brakes as the car on his left swung into the right lane, too fast. Red brake lights flashed, a screech of metal, and the cars in front of him collided.
He’d eaten on the road when it became apparent he wouldn’t be reaching this stop until later so, after waiting in line and finally showering, he decided to head back to his truck and wait there.
“I’m sorry,” the man said, fiddling with the key. He looked truly apologetic. “Not a great night to be stuck in the sleeper.”
Not for the first time, he thought of trying to force himself through the portal, the thought of staying here gripping his chest like a vise.
But he’d always wanted the freedom to choose, to make his own decisions. Now he had the chance. Risk dying if the portal didn’t let him leave, or stay. Horrible options. Beginning to see that free will wasn’t quite what he had imagined it to be. Sometimes he wondered if he was even cut out for independence; it came so easily to people like Dean.
“Yes.” Hated his complicity; standing still rather than smiting, silent instead of condemning. But whatever spell Benny had wrought on Dean, it seemed to have worked on him too. Seemed that if he yelled, his voice would make no ripple. Dean had stayed so still when Benny drank from him, and the thought of disturbing this calm seemed detestable, twisted as it was.
“I doubt they want to see me.” Didn’t miss the way Dean watched him, as if waiting for a sign. For Castiel to agree,
“I’m not drunk,” Cas protested, picking up the can at his feet and peering into it. “Maybe a little. Take this, I need to stop drinking.” He shoved the beer at Dean and rubbed his hands on his jeans. “I just meant that I, um. Well. Been kinda on my own for a while. Nice to finally have someone to talk to.”
“Come on, Jack,” Claire said, catching up to the toddler. “Let’s go get you some style.” Over her shoulder, she called, “Meet up with you guys later.”
Castiel tried to ignore them, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the microexpressions flitting across Dean’s face as Benny sucked his blood. Discomfort, at first, as Benny’s mouth worked to draw the blood from his veins. Then, a gradual softening, hint of a smile as Benny groaned around the wound. Ease.
Clutching his hand, blood spraying from where his fingers once sprouted, the werewolf fell to one knee. Dean kicked him in the chest and sent him sprawling on his back.
“I can try,” Cas said. He looked uncomfortable, staring at her holding his hand, and Dean remembered sitting across him in a brothel, trying to get him laid on possibly his last night on Earth. Good times. Even after years of being on Earth and talking to women, Cas never lost the deer in the headlights look when one of them showed interest in him. The sight gave Dean a strange satisfaction. Zara had no chance with Cas.
Gripping his blade hard enough to hurt his hand, Castiel scanned the land around them, ensuring there were no other monsters waiting in the brush to ambush them. Despite feeling his stomach turn at the sounds of Benny drinking from Dean’s arteries, he couldn’t resist looking back at them. Dean’s face had steeled itself into a practiced neutral expression, and Benny only drank from him for a few seconds before pulling away.
When the soup was finished, he ladled a bowl full and returned to the bedroom. Cas looked up from his phone when Dean entered with the bowl of steaming soup. “Hear from Claire?” Dean asked, nudging the door shut with his foot.
“It’s what you would’ve done for me.” Of course he’d come, of course he wanted to be here for Dean. He didn’t want him to hurt; he felt something towards him he'd never felt for anyone else, and since he couldn’t say it, he wanted to show it, wanted to take care of him, wanted to come as close to the words as he could. “You can call me, anytime. Whatever you need.”
“If you want,” Castiel said, raising two fingers. “I could send you to sleep.” Perhaps he could knock Benny out for a week, get Dean to the portal without him. At least shut him up for the night.
“Yeah. It’ll be nice getting to see the kid grow up. Think Sam’s the most excited about me settling down.”
When Cas remained silent, Dean started turning away to leave him to his planting. “You can fill this tray with soil,” Cas spoke up, stopping him.
Right now, Dean was speaking of the apocalypse. Cage opening, the need for vessels, storms and wars. Left out his time in Hell, Sam’s addiction to demon blood. Careful enough, at least, to keep those details to himself. Only Castiel knew, deeply, how intrinsically Dean’s time in Hell was tied to his being, how the memories still plagued him, how Sam’s dependence on demons nearly tore them apart.
“You know what, fuck you,” Dean spat. Cold words. Castiel tried to hide how he flinched. “You don’t get it. You don’t see the way it is—”
His brain short circuited a little when Cas kissed him back, and it was a second before he could process the way Cas was pressing up close to him, hands gripping at his shirt. Slipping his arms around Cas’ waist, he pulled him flush, chest to chest. Cas made a small noise in the back of his throat and wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck. Dean’s head spun.
And Dean kept calling, and Castiel kept calling, always with the excuse of talking about their routes, when they could meet up again, but their phone calls lasted longer and longer, talking about inconsequential things. Never enough, though. He didn’t know why they needed the excuse, why it felt so wrong to just call and say
Castiel shrugged. “I might quit eventually. I don’t know. Would like to, but I don’t know what else I’d do.”
While Cas tried, he was no match for Larry. Dean would’ve willingly let him win the bet, though, just to keep seeing the way his thighs gripped the side of the bull and the way he rolled his hips to stay in the saddle. Still, he couldn’t help laugh as Cas got thrown and tumbled to the cushioned area around the bull.
He began to undress, folding his trenchcoat carefully to keep the stones inside his pockets. Down to his undergarments. An exaggeration, that the water was freezing. Colder than before, though. He got in up to his chest, shivering. He had to scrub hard at his skin to remove the stubborn dirt. Should duck under the surface to clean his hair, his beard, but the thought of the water closing in over his head made him shudder.
Castiel looked down at Dean, his head heavy on his thigh. But this, Dean sleeping on him, was completely different.
Hadn’t felt like a victory in the moment. The world too still. Dean’s face bloody, swollen. He had looked up at Castiel, broken, and asked,
Other days, he remembered the vicious, searing pain tearing through his form as his grace was ripped from his body and his consciousness fused with his vessel. When he fell without his consent and found himself, bewildered, a human. Shivering nights, cavernous stomach. Bone-chattering loneliness.
“No way!” She hit him on the arm. “Thought driving was in your blood. What made you decide to quit?”
Castiel opened his mouth to protest, and Dean cut him off, raising a hand, “I’m not saying it, okay? I’m not. I’m just saying you, uh. You got a tendency to poke the bear.”
Eyes yanked back to Dean. Who wasn’t watching him anymore, face screwed up, eyes shut, leaning his head back, hips jerking as he came.
Dean would’ve normally agreed, but as he followed them to the water’s edge, the ocean suddenly looked very huge. Kids shrieked and danced along the shore, plunging headfirst into the waves. In contrast, Jack looked very tiny in his matching swim shorts and shirt plus floppy hat.
“Well. If it reacts badly, you will make sure Dean gets where he needs to be. And then, you will…” He wanted to say
Go further, even. Existing here, he might embrace fully his otherness, his monstrous, powerful being which set him apart from humans, from angels, even from other monsters. Thought it might be freeing.
“I think it’s refreshing,” Cas said. He smiled at Dean, and Dean relaxed marginally. Cas had been on him for a while now to take Jack to the beach, and since it was Jack’s birthday weekend, they’d finally planned a three day long beach trip. It’d been a hell of a drive since everyone else in the state seemed to have the same idea and had descended onto this small beach town as well, and they’d had an even worse time finding parking, but Cas looked downright serene gazing at the waves, so he guessed it was worth it.
A hand pressed against his chest and he looked down to see Dean stopping him. “Cas,” he warned. “We need him.”
“Stop saying that! This is the way it is, sorry you got your feelings involved!” He regretted the words as soon as they left his mouth, even more so at the wounded look on Cas’ face.
Part of him still refused to believe it. There was a connection between them, he couldn’t deny that. He knew Dean felt it too, because how could he not? But they never acknowledged it. That was why they never visited outside of drives, wasn’t it? Hardly ever called? Because to do so might make this thing between them grow. It had already grown so much over the years, more than he’d ever expected, more than he reckoned Dean had expected.
Castiel started forward to help, then startled as another vampire emerged on his left. His blade dropped into his hand and he slashed it in a wide arc, catching skin. The monster snarled as blood streamed from its neck, fangs dripping saliva. It lunged forward and Castiel stumbled back, only just managing to fend off the vampire's extended, clawing hands.
“I think we're clear for the moment,” Castiel said, surveying the dead bodies, burnt eyes, severed heads. He pressed a hand to a tree, feeling lightheaded for a moment. Draining to draw upon his grace with enough force to kill. Risky also, but he had no choice when they were overwhelmed.
That agreement lasted all of two weeks. By then, Dean was practically living with Cas, so it wasn’t much of a decision at all to move the rest of his stuff over from Bobby’s and make it official. Way they figured, they'd had enough of taking things slow. They fell into everything so easily, seemed they’d been doing this relationship thing a long time. He guessed they sorta had.
Tempting, too, the idea of relaxing, putting his guard down, fully trusting someone in the way Dean did Benny. There was only one person he could imagine trusting so much—but no matter.
The river looked like viscous oil in the dark. Stopping a few yards away, Castiel forced himself to watch the undulating motion, close enough to keep the two in his sights, far enough to pretend he didn’t see the way Benny had a hand cupping Dean’s jaw, Dean’s fingers curled into his collar, twisting in his seat to kiss him more easily, Benny’s hand slipping down under Dean’s waistband.
If he didn’t quit, if he kept Cas close—and it frightened him to think it—maybe whatever this was between them would grow and he’d realize he and Cas didn’t want such different things after all. Maybe he’d realize he wanted more too.
But he didn't want to drive for the rest of his life. It was tiring work, and he'd never planned to do it this long. A link on the website,
“That the first time you met them?” Dean asked and Cas nodded. “How long’d it been since you saw Anna?”
How could he trust Dean when it was clear his allegiances had been swayed by a blood-drinking vampire? But Dean was right about one thing. They needed Benny. Castiel had to get Dean out of here, couldn’t let him stay one more moment in this place which corrupted everything it touched, corrupted Dean’s very beliefs.
“Fuck!” Dean exclaimed. Had to shout to be heard. They huddled in a shallow alcove, a dip in the rocky ridge which they had been walking alongside all day until the storm began. Not enough shelter to keep them dry; the rain had only begun falling a few minutes ago and already Castiel was drenched to the bone.
Nodding, Hariel picked up her pace through the trees, Zadkiel on her heels. Angelic grace drew her forward, communed with her own—but something was wrong, slightly off. This grace, it seemed too… dull. Too entwined in the fabric of this world.
A last resort, then. Extending his hand, he allowed his grace to pool in his palm. Black ooze dripped from the corners of the Leviathan’s stretching grin and before Castiel could make contact with its skin, its tongue shot forward to wrap around Castiel’s wrist, crushing the bones.
An hour and a half later and the trailer was unloaded. Dean dropped off the truck and trailer at the drop yard, signed some papers, texted Bobby,
Sunlight glinted off the hoods of the cars passing him in the left lane and, glancing in his side mirror, he saw another rig approaching, turn signals flashing to pass him. From the brief glimpse he got, he didn’t think he recognized the driver. After so many years of solo driving, he knew plenty, but he could still go weeks without seeing anyone he knew on the road.
“My dad’s a dinosaur,” Jack told them, trying to see over the edge of the counter. Wren raised an eyebrow, Cas looked surprised, and Claire stifled a laugh.
And every night, Castiel listened. Heard Dean’s voice pleading. Fear, that he was dead. Promises, that he would find him. Did Dean know too that every time he grew closer, Castiel flew further away? For months, he kept his resolve to keep his distance, lead the monsters away from Dean. And for months and months, Dean searched, and finally Castiel couldn’t stay away any longer. He should’ve stayed away.
“Shit,” he muttered, sinking in his seat and rubbing his eyes. “Thought we were pros at this after a year of preschool.”
to yourself.” At Dean’s insistent look, Castiel let his blade retract. “They’re bordering on blasphemy.”
A hand on his elbow, trying to pull him upright. Felt the phantom burn in his throat, tasted the bitterness of the Leviathan bile. He stumbled and Dean wrapped an arm around his waist, pulled him away from the Leviathan bodies.
Dean waded to him and Benny splashed water onto his back, grabbed a handful of the gritty sand and rubbed the dirt and blood off.
“Hola,” Benny said. He stood off to the side, expression surly. Castiel instantly distrusted him. What type of being could Dean have possibly found to accompany him?
“The best!” He took Cas’ offered hand and told them about his day as they walked to the Impala. True to his word, he had remembered every detail, down to the amount of times he used the bathroom and the name of the lunch lady.
he meant the long compliments Cas so shamelessly gave him now, like he'd been storing them up for a long time and was finally able to hand them out. It was like the dam had broken that night when Billie and the Empty—
The forest grew dark, quiet. Crunch of leaves as Benny paced, then sat down, fidgeted with his weapon. Dragging a flat stone closer to himself, he began sharpening his blade.
Dean had talked about quitting plenty over the years, and even though it’d been hypothetical, idle talk, Castiel’s heart had always thudded in his chest. It had scared him, the thought that one day he might not have this. In a life without many constants, there was one person he could always count on to be around: Dean. No matter how long they were apart, their paths would always cross again.
Cracking pain whited out his vision and he stumbled back, eyes tearing up automatically. Distantly, he registered someone yelling, “Hey! Get away from him!” and managed to duck another punch before throwing one at the second man.
Lucky. Castiel laughed quietly to himself. Didn’t seem very fortunate in his eyes that Benny survived to tell the tale—but perhaps he was only being unkind. Dean could lay aside prejudices, surely he could too.
“Not any reason, I didn’t mean anything, I just meant…” Castiel crossed his arms, tucking his hands into his armpits. “I’m surprised, that’s all.”
Castiel took care to heal not only the wounds from Benny’s fangs, but the bruises and cuts Dean had received since he last healed him; always accumulating, couldn't stop them from marking his body.
“Sorry,” Dean turned on the water to start scrubbing the bowls. “Can’t hear you over all the cleaning I’m doing.”
“I don’t know.” That was truth, and that’s what had scared him. Would Cas get angry? Or would Cas not care? Which would be worse to hear?
Dean acknowledged it with a shrug. “Wasn’t close to him. Never let on that we were related. Didn’t want to be known as John’s kid.”
Could he truly hear their voices or were the slithering syllables only memories seared into his grace?
Castiel scrubbed his hands in the river, scraping dirt and blood out from under his fingernails. His face itched and he scratched at his beard. Still not used to facial hair. It seemed that under the effects of Purgatory, his grace’s ability to control his vessel was weakened; not only were his clothes accumulating dirt, but his joints aching and his hair growing longer.
Bracing himself for the worst, Dean checked the line of cars again and was surprised to see movement up ahead.
Guilty, he wondered whether it should. They’d been young when they met each other, they’d had a good run, and Dean didn’t want to ruin what they had by dragging it on for too long. Though, maybe he didn’t have to end anything. He would quit and as the months passed, he and Cas would realize their lives weren’t so compatible, and they’d fall out of touch.
“You can’t feed them,” Sam said, closing the container of fries that the bird was eyeing. “We’ll get a swarm of them.”
The werewolf’s eyes swiveled between them, sizing them up, then he smiled wide. “So you’re the trio I been hearing so much about. The three musketeers.”
“I knew it would be perfect,” Cas said, sounding too triumphant. Shutting the door softly, he got into bed next to him—well, tried to. He shoved at the blanket encroaching on his side of the bed. “Dean, move over.”
“I’m so happy to see you again,” Zara told Cas as a few of her attendants served what Dean guessed was some kind of Djinn desert, some weird pale pudding. She leaned forward and took one of Cas’ hands, and Dean clenched his own hands into fists under the table.
Maybe Anna had been right, when she gave him two week’s worth of her paycheck from working at the Discount Groceries thirty minutes down the road. She’d handed over several bills crisp from the ATM and told him, “It’s alright, if it doesn’t work out. If you need to come back in a few months.”
The mother had sobbed and thanked him. He’d done a piss poor job of comforting her and left with an all-too-familiar sick feeling in his stomach; they hadn’t done enough, they could never save everyone.
Not okay, not okay, he gripped so tightly to Dean’s jacket he thought the fabric might tear, why didn’t Dean understand? They were out there and they were coming for him and they would hurt Dean, hurt him again.
He supposed the idea wasn't so strange—he realized hooking up with Cas for seven years sounded pretty serious. And the idea of actually having some kind of relationship with Cas didn’t seem as absurd as it should. Maybe because they’d been friends for years now; maybe because they got along so well. Or maybe because it was Cas. Something told him he’d never have anything like this again with someone else. Not like with Cas.
“Sorry, can we back up for a second?” He looked up at Cas who was following the other Djinn down the stairs. “Did you say betrothed?”
But Cas had loved him a long time. Every touch of healing grace, every rebellious act, every word of protection written into ribs, every long, watchful night—love in all its facets.
Dean, for his part, seemed unbothered, almost cheerful. “Gettin’ close, can almost taste it.” He gripped Castiel’s shoulder while passing him.
“Good, cher, thanks.” Benny pat him on the chest, then, in a move which shocked Castiel, kissed him on the cheek before letting go of him.
“Oh,” Dean breathed. Cas never was going to leave. He started to feel a little ridiculous for his panicked pie baking, but a smile tugged at the corner of Cas’ mouth and Dean started smiling too. Cas wanted more.
Two of them. Castiel turned his head, holding in his vision the Leviathan approaching from opposite sides.
Swearing under his breath, Benny stomped away with a, “Suit yourself.” Dean didn’t follow, and Castiel cast his gaze down, not wanting to see the disgust in Dean’s eyes. Felt enough of it already from the voices in his head, engrained even without angel radio.
"It's been difficult, yes. I won't lie and say I enjoy bodily functions or sneezing or headaches. But I do enjoy being with you and eating chicken soup and watching absurd TV shows. I wouldn't change this for anything. Whatever happened in our lives, it led us here. And I’m happy with where we are.” He studied Dean for a moment before asking, quieter, “Are you happy?”
Cas smiled, ducking his head to hide it. Dean smiled too. He took another drink, and Cas hugged his knees, looked out at the road to their left. A motorcycle’s revving engine cut through the night as a rider passed by. For a moment, Dean wondered what someone would think seeing him and Cas sitting here together. Their legs were brushing; he didn’t know when they’d moved in so close.
“Why, Castiel,” she said, gazing around the room. “What a lovely home you have. I have to say, though, I didn’t expect you to live underground.”
Scratching at the stubble on his jaw, Dean nodded, looked away. “Right, yeah, uh, I know. Sorry, man—”
Tonight and tomorrow night and the night after that. Day after day after day. Mornings and lunch breaks, lazy Saturdays spent in bed, evening drives. No more saying goodbye for weeks on end. Dean didn’t ever want to say goodbye again.
The nauseating smell of decaying flesh still burned in Castiel’s nostrils when they stopped for the night. Always so many bodies, scattered in their path. Dead from previous fights, maybe a disagreement, maybe simply existing in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Dean studied the water rippling on the bank. “No. No, think I’d rather just stick around on my own.” Cas' gaze pulled his like a magnet, eyes earnest. He'd come too damn close to losing him, giving him up. “You’re sure? You really wanna see more of me?”
Would he be reborn as he once was, or as one of the monsters inhabiting this place, ruled by animalistic instinct only? He thought he knew the answer. And it frightened him. Made him want to fly far and wide throughout this land for a glimpse of escape, for the smallest of chances.
Love meant sacrifice. He hated love, sometimes. Because he loved, he couldn’t be selfish. His life given up for Sam's. Over and over, no end in sight. That was love—never-ending. He knew that. Once it got a hold of you, it didn’t let go. Maybe he loved too much, maybe he didn’t know where love ended and some twisted dependency began. The distinctions between love and its ugly distortions had never been marked for him.
Hands on his face, hands threatening to protrude from his stomach. He let them in, he let them grow, let them leech off of him, so weak.
“Hope he hasn’t done anything too crazy. Don’t know what shit he might be trying to get me and Cas outta here.”
The realization made him suddenly dizzy. Though cast out of Heaven, he’d always lived with the threat of punishment hanging over his head. But he could truly do anything in this place and would suffer no Heavenly discipline. No judgments. No chastisements loud as thunder. No pain searing through his true form, removing memories, sins from his core.
“You like that?” Castiel caught Benny whisper before returning to drinking. His hand slipped lower, out from under Dean’s hand, to his crotch. Dean bit his lower lip hard when Benny groped him, then he seemed to come to himself, eyes flying open.
Raising his hand, he touched Cas’ cheek. He was feeling a little dizzy from the remarkable change of events in so short a time, but the look in Cas’ eyes anchored him. This is what he wanted,
They didn’t notice him, and, irritated, Castiel thought he should make his presence known. Then Benny’s hand slipped down to Dean’s crotch, groping him over his jeans.
Dean ordered a whiskey and, nodding at something Hannah was saying, Cas looked over at him. Dean winked surreptitiously. He caught the slightest flush in Cas’ face before Cas turned away. As an unspoken rule, he and Cas didn’t hang out much in public. He guessed not to draw suspicion, though it seemed, despite their efforts, it was well known they were friends, and a few people, like Meg, might even see through the act.
Though Castiel knew his grace was lighting his eyes, Dean didn’t seem worried for his own safety at all. He kept his grip on Castiel’s arm, and under his gaze, slowly, Castiel let his grace simmer down.
“Think they’d learn by now,” Benny said, wiping his blade on the only patch of dry grass around. “Comin’ up against a vampire, hunter, and angel. But they just keep on comin’.”
“I’ll be there in a moment.” He heard Dean walk away as he smoothed the dirt and scattered the stones. Hardly a sign that he had been here. Nothing for any monster to track. His angelic presence attracted them enough—though perhaps as his grace continued to hide deeper inside of himself, he would become less a target. One day, perhaps, he might be indistinguishable from any other monster. Telling, that he no longer felt panic at the thought. Just resignation.
Unbidden, the thought rose in his head of having Cas over, getting a chance to really show him the place, show him Baby. In all the years they’d known each other, why hadn’t he ever invited Cas over for a simple visit, tried to spend their hometimes together?
The leaf twirled towards the portal, then seemed repelled by an unseen force because it suddenly cavorted back down the rocks. “There it is,” Castiel said. Rather than any relief, he felt a sinking sensation in his stomach. Forced himself to steady. To Dean, he added, “It's reacting to you.”
“Woah, what’s wrong?” Carefully, Dean took Castiel’s forearm, studying his wrist. Skin already turning a mottled purple, swelling. “Think it broke your hand.”
Dean laughed. “Always go to my truck anyway. Yours is too crowded with the fucking plants.” A chair creaked. “How long’s it been? That we’ve been doing this, that we’ve known each other?”
When Cas spoke, his voice was level. “After all this time, you’re really gonna tell me that this is what you want, that you really don’t feel anything towards me? After all this time.”
“Then let us free you from this place,” Zadkiel urged. “Naomi, she will help you. You will think clearly again, you will act once again as is befitting to a seraph.”
“Tired. Like usual.” Shifting, crossing his legs at the ankle, Dean let his head rest back against the tree. “Just tired.”
He grunted as he slammed into the ground, instinctually throwing out his arms as the Leviathan pounced on him, sneer unhinging into a cavernous, toothed orifice.
“Yes, she will,” Cas said, giving Dean a look. He pushed Jack’s hair back from his face. “It’s the thought that counts.”
Dean pulled Castiel to his feet and the sudden action sent a bolt of pain up his right wrist. He exclaimed in pain, clutching it close.
He had been trying very hard today to not think about the fact that this was Dean’s last drive. Or the fact that Dean hadn’t told him until now, until the last possible moment, really.
“I wouldn’t.” He looked at Dean, who sat down onto the log and dropped his head in his hands. It amazed him, still, how much Dean cared.
“I’m trying to help, dude,” Dean told him. “This’ll make it feel better.” More startled than hurt, it seemed, Jack calmed down after a few seconds. Turning off the water, Dean studied his finger. Not even a blister, but he nodded at Cas. “Think Dada can help?”
Swirling vapor preceded the first Leviathan. Benny was swinging at it before it formed into a figure. A snarl, then a face, a gash carved into its smile. Dean plucked at Castiel’s sleeve, pulling him back to back, scanning around them.
“Never.” Cas glanced over his shoulder at the Love’s, his hands shoved in his jacket pockets. The flickering yellow light from a nearby streetlight lit up his hair, made his eyes bright.
Feeling a little sheepish for immediately jumping to the worst conclusions—one of his greatest talents, if he did say so himself—he shook his head. "Nah, I have a great immune system."
’s he had repeated too much already. They were good friends—or so Castiel liked to think. At the very least, he and Dean had talked enough to know a fair bit about each other’s families and lives. Dean and his brother had been very close with Mary, he knew. Her sickness had taken a toll on them. There wasn’t anything he could say to make her death hurt any less, though he wished he could. But he thought he understood a bit of what was running through Dean’s head—the what if’s, the guilt for not being there more.
“And you…  fit somewhere in that equation. Still haven’t figured out how.” His eyes slid to Dean’ sleeping form, and Castiel tensed. “He wouldn’t leave without you.”
Dean stared at him for a moment, then it hit him what Cas was saying. “Cas, no. I’m not letting you come to Sioux Falls with me.”
, Dean thought. Jody had invited them for the week, mentioning off-hand that Sioux Fall’s pride events were going on, and Dean had pushed aside the mild panic at that comment, told her they’d come visit. He didn’t know he’d be roped into joining everyone at Pride, but here he was, feeling out of place in the corner of the kitchen. Who knew how he’d feel standing at the parade.
Dean swallowed hard. “Me too,” he admitted, and it felt like a lot to say, but it was such a relief to confess it.
Another bolt of lightning, a sickening crack, the smell of burning wood. Dean was shivering, trying to hide it. Thrum of electricity in the air.
“No, it’s not that, it’s just. I don’t want you to upend your life for me.” Cas started to speak, and he cut him off, “Cas, really. I’m not worth it.”
“And ice cream,” Jack said. “And donuts and burgers and hot dogs.” He jumped and Dean and Cas took the cue, lifting him to swing him between them. Jack whooped, and Cas started laughing.
“He doesn’t realize what he’s doing, this place is playing tricks with his mind. Encouraging your bloodlust, it’s impure.” Voice rising.
Returning to his truck, he swept out the trailer, then waited inside the cab for the shippers to load the cargo. Using a water bottle, he watered his plants and placed the tiny pots on the floor in the sunlight coming through the windshield. He stared at them for a moment and thought of how inadequate they looked, how inadequate his efforts were in making the truck feel more like a home.
“Of course you’d be a nerd about this,” Dean complained. He nodded at where Zara was entering the room talking with Cas. “Don’t think she’s gonna give Cas up that easily. She already seems pretty attached.”
Castiel opened his eyes. Icy water trickled down his back. “Something about Purgatory… It’s restraining. Almost like fog closing in on my grace, suffocating it. Like it wants to trap me here.”
“Shame.” Almost of their own accord, his hands came up to Dean’s waist. The corners of Dean’s eyes crinkled, giving away the smile he was trying to hide, and now Castiel was staring at his mouth. He shifted forward, almost without noticing. “But I don’t really mind,” he said.
“But if it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t be fighting for your life, you wouldn’t be stuck traveling with a monster—”
In all that time, they had moved forward about ten feet and Dean was starting to entertain thoughts about abandoning Baby on the asphalt and walking back home.
Cas had been quiet the night before and into the morning, and Dean hated the way his quitting was tainting their time together, both continually thinking about it, he knew.
“Yeah, yeah, but they don’t see it that way." He frowned, dried blood creasing along the lines of his forehead. "I mean, we got normal people who are scared of us, or just don’t notice us because they don’t know what goes bump in the night. And then we got other hunters who hate us or hated our dad, which is the same thing, and then we got the monsters that are trying to kill us. So yeah. Know what it feels like to not have many friends.”
And who did Zara think she was? She thought Cas needed a home, that she could give him one. As if they weren’t good enough for him. Well, Dean knew Cas deserved a lot better, but they got along pretty well. Had been through enough shit together, at least.
He was stubborn though; he’d be damned if he returned home. It was like Anna had said about Gabe: there was nothing for him there.
Cas looked up at him, some unreadable emotion on his face. Dean almost asked if a garden was still in the works, or if Cas had started to envision the Djinn gardens. “Figure even if you don’t eat you should contribute to dinner,” he said instead. “Start growing food.”
“You were a vampirate.” His faux-serious demeanor broke fully into a grin.”Get it? Vampire plus pirate?”
Castiel knew Dean was right, knew he was being irrational, getting so upset. He shouldn’t care so much. “Fine,” he said, a little too harshly. “Maybe we’ll get to see each other in another two fucking months.”
“Dammit, Cas, no!” Dean’s sudden anger startled him and Castiel faltered. “What the fuck is wrong with you, man? You wanna just throw in the towel like that?”
“Smart move. Wish I could’ve stopped earlier, but some asshole shippers thought it’d be funny to take two hours to load my truck this morning, set me back for the day.”
“Dean—” But Dean walked away, waving him off, and any words that might redeem himself died in his mouth.
Encouraging Cas to leave with his Djinn friends may have been the mature thing to do, but that didn’t stop it from hurting like hell. Going back inside, Dean holed up into his room, not wanting to hear Zara’s gleeful excitement when Cas told her he was going back with her to her kingdom. He had a feeling Zara wasn’t going to be calling off the engagement anytime soon.
Surprised, Castiel stared at him. So this too, they had in common. Wanted to protest, tell Dean he was as far from a monster as one could be. But he thought of how it was nice, that Dean didn’t argue with him, didn’t tell him he was wrong.
Inside, he paid for a shower at the counter, looking around the convenience store and adjoining fast-food dining area to see if he recognized anyone. No one familiar. He checked his phone when he got his shower ticket, but no new texts.
"That's not true," Cas interrupted, touching Dean’s hand resting between them. Dean raised an eyebrow. "Dean, being human has been the single most rewarding experience in my entire life second only to raising Jack. It started with you rescuing me from the Empty and revealing my feelings weren't unreciprocated like I thought. I would say that's far from miserable.”
“Shit,” he muttered aloud, dropping the receipt back into the console. He knew what “moving on” meant: never getting to see Cas on the road again—really, never getting to ever see him again, what with the way he’d acted. Ruined everything.
"For you to me are the only one," he sang over Robert Plant, glancing at Cas as he turned up the radio, wind whistling through the open windows, road humming under their feet.
In a diner in Arkansas, Cas read from a menu, plastic corners curling, and commented, "No matter where we go, every place serves an iceberg wedge salad."
Shoved to the ground instead, the jolt knocking his blade from his hand. He looked up to see Dean rushing the Leviathan; one fell swoop and his blade hacked into the monster’s throat. Another and the head severed from the body, flew to the ground.
"So first you roll the dough out into a rope," he said, following along with the pictures. "Then you form it into a u-shape." He glanced at Jack to see if he was paying any attention, but Jack seemed more interested in rolling the dough around the table and through the flour. Then he yelped, staring at his hands in bewilderment.
Benny halted, fist gripping his blade, and Castiel steeled his gaze, let his grace rise to the surface. Tried to, that is. His grace resisted him, seemed wound too tightly in his core.
Climbing off the bull, he made his way over to where Benny was standing at the bar, shaking his head good-naturedly.
“Jack, no,” he said, taking Jack’s fist and opening it before he could shove sand into his mouth. Jack protested, but Dean quickly set down the colorful bucket and shovel set they’d bought for this occasion, successfully distracting him.
When he cleaned up and crawled back into bed, Dean was on his phone. “Sam texted me,” he said, looking up as Castiel slipped under the covers. “Sent me a photo of Jack on his first field trip.”
“Right, in case.” Dean leaned a hand on the wall, framing him in on one side, and Castiel’s heartbeat kicked into high gear. “We can split the room, save some money.”
Forgot himself, wide-eyed stare, heated face, until Dean looked at him. Forgot Benny, held in Dean’s gaze. Didn’t need to look beyond to his soul, entranced by the micro-shifts in his expression, his tongue wetting his bottom lip.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed verbally, jostling his leg under the table. He glanced sideways at Sam, who was giving Dad a glare. Dean gave him a look that meant,
Giving him a sly smile, Cas tucked himself against the opposite door to shield his drawing from him. “Just going for accuracy,”
Claire rolled her eyes. “Yeah.” So, she still had the Grumpy Cat Cas had bought her. She wasn’t cruel enough to throw it away when the guy was trying so hard to make up for walking around in her dead dad’s body. Plus, the stuffed animal was kinda cute. Not that she was going to tell anyone that.
drew his eyes. If he wanted to take some classes, he'd have to quit driving over the road. His hours were too unpredictable; he could never commit to anything.
“Let me,” he told Dean, lifting his hand. It wasn’t wise to use too much of his grace, but he could quickly heal a small wound.
“Uh—” Dean took the bowl and ladled what looked like mashed potatoes on his plate. “When’d he have time to tell you that?”
“Yes, it is,” Cas agreed, transferring the pretzels onto a plate. Dean turned off the oven, then startled when Jack began crying.
“Mhm.” Cas threaded his fingers along the short hairs at the nape of Dean’s neck, and Dean kissed the corner of his mouth. “Was. Then I got this route.”
“Don’t know how you managed years alone here by yourself,” Dean said, wiping his blade on some leaves. Djinn this time. Two blocking their path, tattoos snaking up their arms, necks, and heads. Strong and tall, but quickly defeated. With a quick glance at Benny, Dean had taken the one on the right and Benny took the other, leaving Castiel to hang back. Reminded him almost of Dean fighting with Sam, their silent communication developed after years of hunts. Dean and Benny's a relationship fast-tracked in this continual warzone.
, he thought. A bell above the door jingled when he went inside, and a woman behind a desk and a man standing in front of it looked up at him.
“It’s alright.” Krista came around the front to help pick up the peaches. “A little dirt never hurt anyone.” Straightening with two in each hand, she asked Jack, “You wanna try a piece?”
“We've known each other for years now, and you know me better than anyone else, think I know you pretty well too. Forgive me for not wanting to give that up.”
“Oh, brother.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, a sheepish motion that Castiel found endearing. “I don’t wanna know what he said.”
That was true. Regrettably. Surprisingly, too, since Dean had the natural instincts of a hunter. He could smell out bullshit from a mile away. Called Castiel out on his own plenty of times.
Castiel couldn’t sit anymore and watch, listen. Getting to his feet, he walked away down the bank. Neither Dean nor Benny noticed.
Castiel’s expression softened. “You’ve given me more than I could’ve ever dreamt of. And anyway, it’s not a competition, Dean. I take care of you, you take care of me. That’s what love is.”
Glancing around, Dean caught sight of Benny sitting in the dining area. Making his way over there, he clapped Benny on the shoulder, sank into the chair opposite him. “Hey, thought you’d be up further north by now.”
Dean would think it cruelty at first, Castiel staying behind. But he would eventually understand. Not cruelty, mercy. He would be better off without Castiel, without his constant failures.
Sighing, he was shutting his laptop when his phone screen lit up. He stared at the caller ID for a few moments, wondering why Dean would be calling him so late. His heart thudded, hoping something wasn’t wrong.
Jody pulled Donna in for a kiss that turned into making out. Claire rolled her eyes. “Ew, guys, Gross.” Kaia elbowed her and Claire’s put-on air of displeasure broke into a grin as she elbowed her back. Cas nudged Dean with a small smile when a float of pink, purple, and blue streamers drove past. For a moment, Dean's chest seized, John's voice ringing in his head, but in all the noise around them, it quickly drowned out.
He wasn’t searching for an actual answer, but Cas grew serious, balling his shirt up in his hands and looking away. “I actually, uh. Well, my dispatcher didn’t just give me this job. I called in and asked if they had any routes West to East, any around California, since I knew you were headed here.”
Dean slid into the bench seat opposite him. “Uh, don’t know. Soon, I guess, once we finalize all the paperwork.”
Cas grinned at him and Zara looked mildly stricken, staring back and forth between them. Then resignation spread over her features and she smiled a little. “I see.” Waving her hand, she said, “Well, then. Consider yourself free of our engagement.”
“If I’m to join you, he will not take your blood again,” he told Dean, though he kept Benny pinned with a look.
It’d been a joke, but he thought he might have meant it. It was reckless, the feeling in his chest, because him and Cas weren’t anything much at all.
Stooping, Castiel picked up a rock and held it inside his fist in his pocket, the rough ridges digging into his palm, grounding. Then he fell into line.
“Fuck, dude.” Dean sat down next to him, their thighs pressed together, and ran his finger over the etchings. “What, he’s gonna drop dead in two days?”
Dean smiled. “We’ll see about that.” He drew his blade away from the werewolf’s neck and as the creature’s mouth opened with a snarl, stabbed him in the stomach.
“You’ve helped plenty,” Dean muttered, turning away, and Castiel froze. Of course Dean wouldn’t listen to him, all Castiel had done lately was betray his trust, ruin everything through his misguided attempts to help, to assist.
“I’ll keep watch,” Cael called, pausing a few feet away. “There are monsters close by. We must move quickly.”
Going to Dean, he tapped his fingers together, signing more, and Dean handed him a french fry, his tiny fist only big enough to hold one.
The story shifted. Angels trapping Dean to keep him from Sam. An ornate room, nasal-voiced Zachariah. “Then he showed up,” Dean said, thumb over his shoulder at Castiel. He felt a bit surprised to be mentioned.
Kenny Rogers' greatest hits played from the speakers around the bar, and Dean studied the last remnants of whiskey in his glass before finishing it. Setting the glass down, he glanced around the bar, hoped he’d get to see Cas again tonight. Reaching Fort Collins, he’d pulled off into a Walmart Supercenter parking lot for the night. Cas had kept driving, but was hoping to double back and join him if his next shipment wasn’t ready to be picked up until morning. It was nice, getting to see Cas for more than a few hours at a time, getting to make plans to see each other soon instead of going their separate ways for another several weeks.
Any other angel would grow insane from existing for months in such a place, Castiel thought as they continued, tighter ranks, more guarded. Glory and righteousness accustomed to the purity of Heaven would writhe in pain at the presence of such evil here.
His eyelids pulled with sleep as they lay there and talked, slow, quiet conversation, both drifting off. The lot had quieted down; no more trucks hissing to a stop or drivers yelling greetings. By this time, most drivers were probably bedding down. He and Cas were honestly lucky no one knew they hooked up with the amount of times they had done this. Why they kept it a secret, Dean wasn’t sure; it was just an unspoken agreement between him and Cas.
“Yes.” He didn’t mention that he’d been driving for three years now. “Gabe told you?” He’d spoken to Gabe a few months ago, another rare call.
Perhaps he should be grateful for the easy way Dean moved through this place, considering the multitude of alternatives which his mind had explored in every facet. If Dean had died… Well, he would have never forgiven himself. Though, there was plenty he would never forgive himself for already.
Trying to get in a more comfortable position, Dean hit his elbow on the wall and broke their kiss with a swear. Cas laughed at him.
"Take the oregano," Dean said quickly, hoping for a distraction. It worked, except now he had to hand over the container and watch Jack sprinkle the herb all over the near vicinity. Maybe he could pass off clean-up duty to Cas, who was making his own mess, adding food dye to his dough to make a swirl of purple and pink.
Sam only held his gaze for a second before it seemed his courage failed. He ducked his head. “No,” he mumbled, kicking at the table leg.
“Thanks for coming,” Dean said when he walked him outside to the car Castiel had rented to drive out there.
, Cas was going to make this hard for him. But he probably deserved it. “I just… I don’t know,” he continued, following Cas’ gaze to their shadows. “All these years, we had our thing and that was it, and it was enough. Or, I thought it was. Didn’t ever think to ask for more. Didn’t think that was an option.”
Approaching stealthily but quickly, he peered through the trees to see Benny standing close to Dean, hands on his shoulders, bent over his neck. The scene might have been a tender one if not for Dean's eyes clenched shut, hand gripping the blade at his side, and the sinking sensation in Castiel's stomach. He faltered for half a second, then Benny adjusted his grip on Dean, the gleam of fangs against Dean's skin, and he snapped into action.
Dean shrugged. “You wanna know the worst part? I was so damn embarrassed. Because we were a couple all throughout high school. Told everyone she was the one. Anyway—” He swallowed down more of his beer. “‘Nuff about me. What about you?”
“Drop it, Cas.” Leaning his head back against the tree, he shut his eyes. “We’re here, we gotta get out. That’s all there is to it.”
Castiel lifted his head to see both Dean and Benny looking at him, Benny’s hand hooked in Dean’s waistband.
Benny took a seat on a stump near the waters’ edge, blade balanced on his knees. Sitting cross-legged on the damp bank, Castiel picked up a handful of silt and let it fall through his fingers.
Surprised when the coil drawing him up tight released and he spilled into his fist. Gasped and stared at himself.
“Yeah, I did.” Despite his annoyance earlier, a smile slowly spread across his face watching him. Dean was here; he was really here. He'd been so afraid...
Castiel turned to see Benny sitting a few feet away, holding Dean’s handkerchief to his ear. So, Dean’s concern for him was no more than simple fear that he would lose a means to an escape.
Sliding closer, he slipped his arm around Dean’s waist, shut his eyes, felt the rise and fall of Dean’s breathing under his arm. Pressing his forehead to the nape of Dean’s neck, he breathed in the scent of his hair. He had to get up in a few hours, keep driving.
It felt like a betrayal to think so, though. He’d seen the way Cas visibly worked up the courage to tell him. Of course, even if Cas really had meant what he said, there was no way he felt the same now. Dean's stomach twisted in guilt at the way he’d shot Cas down, insulted him.
His neck ached from a night of keeping watch: sitting still, quiet, on high alert. Annoyed, he rubbed at his neck, the tightness of his shoulders. Purgatory had done its fair share of wear and tear on him. He wasn’t supposed to be here—neither his human vessel or angelic grace. How long would his vessel last in a place like this, how long before his grace was no longer able to resist decay? Already, he felt the ever-present gloom clouding his own brilliant essence, tainting it.
Fighting to keep his tone casual, he answered, “I’ve told a few people. Guess the word will spread.” He checked his mirrors, added, “I never had a chance to tell you, man—"
“Well, I gotta admit, Dean,” Benny drawled, straightening, nodding at Castiel. “He's got his strong points, but holy hell, if he ain't a magnet.”
“Think we can get a few more hours in before dark,” Benny said, studying the sky. None of them moved to leave the water, though. The forest around them was perfectly still. Deceptively calm, innocent. Underneath it all, however, Castiel could detect a current of evil, always present.
Dean thought. He looked out at the water, sunlight glinting sharply off the surface. “I had to see you again.” Figuring an apology was in order, he said, “I didn’t mean it, all I said. Wasn’t right.”
Getting under the covers, he draped the blanket over himself and lay down, shifting to get comfortable. Once settled, he stared up at the ceiling and waited for the miracle blanket to work its wonders. How much money had Cas spent on this shit? He really had to hide the credit cards.
Pride was a dangerous sin; the sin which led to Lucifer’s demise. Castiel had had humility beaten into his true form since his creation—and yet he craved the desperate desire underlying Dean’s supplications.
Castiel’s heart ached, a tangible, physical sensation in his chest. “Are you going to take time off?” he asked.
Castiel wished he could defend himself, but his grace rankled in his chest suddenly, hair rising on the back of his neck and arms. He turned quickly, scanning the forest around them. That scent, that unmistakable presence. A shudder gripped his shoulders. “We may get to test that theory.”
“I ain’t saying nothing,” Bobby protested, though he was still smiling. Dean shut the hood of the car and he spoke up, “Don’t be taking a long lunch break now.”
They did have work to do, but that was nothing new. Dean looked around at the start of Cas’ garden, at the slight rise of dirt a few yards away that marked the bunker underground. Maybe this was home for Cas, but it couldn’t compare to a kingdom, not how Zara described it. Begrudgingly, he thought of Cas and Zara's similar interests and her descriptions of her kingdom and how perfect it would be for Cas.
Either way, lying under twenty pounds of “cotton and poly pellets” wasn’t going to help. Though the blanket
A good thing. Eerily similar to what Cas had told him. Just how much did Bobby know, or guess? “This shop, it’s a good thing,” he said, because that was true. “Living close to you, to Sam and Eileen and Jack, it’s what I want.” And that was also true. Sure, there was plenty else he could wish for, but better not to dwell on those things. “Everything’s gonna work out.”
The man stepped forward as if to stop him. “If you want, you can use the shower in my room, I don’t mind. If you want.”
“Nah. Bobby has a few dogs. Really mean before they get used to you. He’s retiring, I tell you that?”
Castiel picked up a smooth stone, distinct from the others by a swirling pattern on its surface. He rolled it around his palm, searching the forest around them for any signs of movement. All still. Without any air movement, the tree branches seemed etched in place.
Cas had texted her yesterday, with an extreme amount of emojis and emoticons that took some time to decipher, asking if she wanted to go shopping with him, Dean, and Jack. Apparently Jack needed new clothes and they needed a gift for Eileen’s birthday coming up, and maybe they could go bowling or something afterwards.
Dean’s collar was pulled up, his body language stiff even in sleep. Unconsciously shielding himself from the cold. Castiel wanted to reach over and touch his forehead, warm him with his grace, but he wasn’t so sure the gesture would be appreciated.
“I’ve never known you to be this foolish.” He didn’t bother keeping his voice quiet, he wanted this vampire,
The next day, Zara and her entourage showed no signs of going home. Dean ran into several of them in the bathroom down the hall, two sitting in the kitchen talking to Jack, and four more in one of the archival rooms helping Sam—as Dean had suspected—catalogue Cas’ gifts.
“Can understand. A bit.” Castiel looked at Dean curiously. Dean shrugged. “Not exactly heroes to the other hunters. Not with Sam drinking demon blood and me breaking the first seal.”
“Alright, alright, I’ll explain,” Dean said, hand still extended to stop Castiel’s attack. “Just, put the blade down first.”
“What? Yeah, sorry, everything’s fine. Just thought I might call.” There was a soft clink. “Ya know, just because. Haven’t seen you in a while.”
just as attractive as Castiel remembered. He couldn’t stop the flush spreading through his body remembering everything else. Dean nodded at the motel. “You getting a room?”
Straightening up from behind the stand with a crate of fruit, Krista beamed at them. “Hey, Cas, hi, Jack! How’s it going?”
“Yeah, yeah, thanks.” Dean leaned back against the cab, ignoring how dirty it was. “Didn’t expect you to show up of all people. Didn’t know you were nearby.”
If she thought Castiel’s appearance and demeanor was an indicator of lacking mental faculty, she was sorely mistaken. Castiel’s gaze turned sharper, eyes squinting. “So you want to bring me back. To Heaven?”
“I’m going to frame these,” Cas said, tucking the drawings into his bag. “I think they’d look nice in the living room.”
“Don’t look so shocked.” He shifted his weight, leaned back against the counter. “When did you get out? And why are you here, how’d you find me?”
“This is lovely,” Cas said, gazing around as he laid out a blanket. Dean followed his gaze and didn’t know what he was seeing. The wide stretch of sand before the ocean was filled with umbrellas, blankets, sand castles, sunbathers, and people throwing frisbees dangerously close to others’ heads.
Rage surged in his chest, thinly disguised shame. He kept his expression steeled. Part of him wanted to let them walk off without him. To flee. Farther this time. To hide so well, Dean could never find him. Not that Dean would ever stop searching.
“I’m drawing us,” Jack told him, reaching for another crayon while keeping a hand shielding the drawing.
“What’s that?” Jack asked, stretching against his carseat straps to jab at one of the pins Claire wore on her leather jacket.
When his search through the bunker proved futile, Dean had a thought and headed outside. Sure enough, a few yards from the bunker door, next to a bag of potting soil and a tray of small green containers, Cas sat cross legged on the grass holding one of the seed packets Dean had bought for him.
“Can’t say… can’t say I don’t want it.” He picked at the skin around his thumbnail, then straightened, crossed his arms. “Maybe I won’t quit, I’ll keep driving—“
Dean watched Castiel as if waiting for a rebuke. Benny took his chin in his hand and turned his face back to him, kissed him.
Looking away, Castiel said, “I don’t fault you for that. Your distrust is completely justified.” It still stung him to the quick. He wished to God, to Heaven above, that he had not betrayed Dean and Sam, that he had not let his pride take control. He had wanted so badly to prove himself as someone worthy of Dean’s trust and companionship, and yet had accomplished the exact opposite.
He took up sand, rubbed it over the stain on the hem. He scrubbed and scrubbed until the mark washed away. Then he continued with every other one the Leviathan had left behind.
Castiel fiddled with one of the stones in his pockets as he watched them wade into the water. “Freezing!” Dean exclaimed.
And he realized love had surrounded him his whole life whether he noticed it or not, like a worn, warm flannel fresh from the dryer.
“Hey, hey.” Dean gave them both warning glances. “Stand down. We survived attacks from every fucking type of monster, not gonna let you guys die from some cat-fight.”
Cas coughed, waving flour away from his face and Jack cackled, one palm dusted white. Dean laughed at Cas, until Jack leaned over and swiped at his t-shirt.
What he did know: he was not the angel who had pulled Dean from Hell or who met him face to face in an abandoned barn. He’d once been proud of that fact, proud of his rebellion. Now, he wondered how much simpler everything would be if he’d simply stayed in line. At least then he wouldn’t feel so lost.
“What’s wrong?” Dean asked. Without answering, Castiel veered off to the right. Through the trees, open space and light. A few yards and he broke out onto the bank of a river.
His hands were trembling, covered in Leviathan ooze. Trenchcoat torn at the seams under his arms. Shakily, he withdrew Dean’s handkerchief from his pocket. Taken while he slept. Clumsily, he wiped his hands, his face, his neck. Rough fabric comforting, his jittery shaking slowly stilling.
Trying to distract himself, he folded up the bed linens, and then there was nothing to do but sit and wait. Not that he could just sit. Cas’ words echoed in his head, as much as he tried to ignore them.
Dean high-fived him. “A diversion, good call.” Jack stared at his precarious castle and Dean saw the moment he decided to draw his leg back in a kick. “Nope, nope.” Scooping him up, he deposited him in the sand on the other side of the castle. “Grab us some more shells.”
“Come here,” Cas told Dean. He grabbed the sunscreen bottle and Dean moved to sit with his back to him.
“Unfortunately, I think John lost touch with reality long before he spoke those words,“ Castiel said before he processed the statement. He froze a little, waiting for Dean’s usual reaction to slights against his father.
Biting his thumbnail, he told himself all good things came to an end, over and over again until the words lost their meaning. No one was saying it had to be this way, that this had to end. Just him. And maybe he was wrong. Wouldn’t be the first time.
“I didn’t mean—” Cutting himself off, Castiel headed to his own truck. He glanced back at the bar, and felt idiotic for doing so. Why couldn’t he leave well enough alone? Why did he need more?
One constant he treasured. The moment after, when Benny would step away and Castiel could erase the traces of his violence. Not the deep melding of his grace with Dean’s soul which he wished he could do. Faint traces of his grace he knew wouldn’t attract too much attention.
Jack moved aside as the crab scuttled past and burrowed into another hole. With a shriek, eyes wide, he pointed at the place where it’d disappeared. “It lives in the sand,” Cas told him, and Jack nodded solemnly, then plunked down in Dean’s lap.
When had that happened? When had he lost interest in anyone other than Cas? Once, maybe four years ago, he’d found someone at a bar, a one-night stand. She’d left her number and he’d never called. Part of him had wanted to because Sam had Eileen and now a kid, and Lisa had a husband, and shouldn’t he, also, finally settle down, shouldn’t he stop messing around and find someone, settle?
“There, go, be free,” Dean told him when he’d turned him a shade paler with a copious amount of sunscreen. Turned loose, Jack kicked at the sand with his sandaled feet, then pointed at the ocean.
Castiel’s eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness. Outline of windows, of a door. Dean’s hand was warm wrapped around his wrist.
Despite the abruptness of his statement, Cas was quick to answer, “No, Dean, it will, because this is what you wanna do.” He waited until Dean nodded. “It’ll work out, you’ll see.”
Clouds of black smoke erupted in front of them and Dean stumbled back. Castiel drew his blade as the smoke cleared to reveal oozing forms transforming into two Leviathan.
Benny laughed. “‘Fraid ain’t nothing that’ll stop them. Once holed myself between two trees, tryin’ to hide out during a storm, and two ghouls found me. Pitch black, hardly see where I was slashing."
Hope for what, he wasn’t sure. All he knew was that he couldn’t imagine life without Cas, didn’t want to. Was maybe even desperate enough to try
Castiel stumbled after him. The portal hovered over a pile of rocks and Castiel stumbled as he tried to climb. He couldn’t go through it, but Dean would try to drag him through it, he had to let him go—
Dean wiped his hand on his jacket, left a bloody smear. “Must be traveling through a hot spot. Get better in a day or so.”
A second, then Dean nodded once. “I’m good.” Straightening with effort, he looked to the portal. “Let's go.”
"Whaddya wanna eat?" Dean asked him as he drained his glass of water. "And don't say PB and J," he added before Cas could speak.
A grunt and rustle of leaves were the only warning of an attack before a vampire rushed out of the woods. Dean swung his blade up, slashing the creature’s arm, and the monster jumped back, baring its teeth.
Benny’s grin grew wider. “Not so prudish as he makes out to be, huh? Few more weeks out here, think we could get that stick outta your ass.”
With a crack, Its jaw opened, black saliva sliding down its teeth and landing on Castiel's flesh with a searing sizzle. With the sensation came other more insidious ones, memories. Liquid heat through his veins, a pulsing not of his own heart but of a thousand living, crawling bodies inside him, pressure from inside, swelling, suffocation as his grace curled tighter and tighter in on itself to escape, his muscles weakening—
Zara stroked her thumb over Cas’ knuckles. “Now that our tribe is at peace with our warring siblings to the North, we are looking to expand relations with other kinds. Humans, for instance, and angels. I think you can be a strong ally in making that happen.”
“Hope so.” He picked up sand and let it fall through his fingers. “Just don’t want the kid to get all screwed up like I am.”
“Monster ain’t the insult you think it is,” Benny told Castiel, blade still held at the ready. “Worse things to be out here.” His gaze seemed to penetrate right into him, to the twisted mess inside, and Castiel felt himself shrink.
He looked back to shore where Benny bent over Dean, taking his blood. And Dean let him. A hunter, essentially a practiced killer, a man trained to fight offensively at all times, and yet he willingly bared his neck for a monster, offered up his own life blood.
“Had to stop for repairs around noon and it took way longer than I was expecting. I’m still up near Cincinnati, so I’m just gonna stay the night here and leave early so I can still make my drop-off tomorrow.”
Castiel, trembling, made his way up the rest of the rockface, crawled over the plateau where the portal had hung, suspended in the air. No power, no rushing air, no light as before. Just dirt and grass. He dug his fingers into the dry earth and choked back a sob rising up in his throat.
He checked his phone, but Cas hadn't texted him. Maybe they wouldn't get to see each other again; maybe they wouldn't get a chance to say goodbye.
“Guess not,” Cas said. He produced a tissue box out of thin air and handed one to Dean, then blew his own nose.
“Know people who’ve tried. One guy, a shapeshifter, he tried, kept pushing closer. But thing shot him back out. Not before burning him.” He gestured to his own face. “Got scarring, all down his face and side. Closed up one of his eyes. Gruesome. Few instances like that and we figured the portal’s only meant for humans.”
“That would feel strange,” Cas mused. “I don’t know where I’d settle down if I did decide to quit.” The line was quiet for a moment before he continued, “But I’d like to have a home base that’s mine, you know? ‘Stead of carrying everything I own from truck to truck.”
The tunnel walls rose up around Dean’s truck, orange lights sweeping at intervals over the steering wheel and his hands. The trailer Cas was pulling gleamed in the lights. He felt disoriented for a moment, like he’d ducked underwater. Always like what? The rumble of their engines echoed hollowly. Ahead, the tunnel opened and tiny pinpricks dotted the dark sky. He thought he knew what Cas meant.
“That’s not a nice word, Jack,” Cas said. Quieter, he added, “But it’s accurate.” He pulled out his phone. “I’m gonna send a message to the playgroup chat. Tommy’s behavior can’t be tolerated. Soon all the kids are going to become bullies.”
The stones from his pockets didn’t balance on top of each other quite right, too knobby and irregular. Kept trying, though. Kept his hands and mind busy, needed to keep his mind busy, on something else, anything else than…
“Benny, right?” They reached his truck and he leaned on the door to the cab, drinking from the coffee cup.
“Hey,” Cas said, touching his shoulder. Dean tensed, then felt awful for his reaction, but Cas didn’t move away, only rubbed between his shoulder blades until Dean relaxed marginally. “You okay?”
The words ran like cold water through Castiel’s veins, and for a split second, before his eyes he saw not Purgatory and a Leviathan, but black ooze streaming from his own eyes and nose, splitting his flesh—
“Wait a moment,” Dean protested. “What do you mean, my ‘anxiety levels’?” Cas opened the box and he leaned over to look at the contents. Folded, silky dark grey fabric. “What is that, a blanket?”
“You can go ahead and repress your vile nature,” he said, drawing Benny’s eyes away from Dean. “You won’t be getting any human blood now, not from him.”
“She’ll love that.” He could almost hear Charlie’s excitement now. Getting to his feet, he ruffled Jack’s hair. “You got a lot of lucky friends. Having you as a friend, I mean.”
“How the fuck do you manage to sleep every night?” Benny asked Dean, who was settling down, running his hand over the ground to excavate small stones hiding under fallen leaves.
A few miles past the accident, Dean caught sight of Cas’ truck ahead and eased off the road into the pull-off behind him. Cars and trucks whizzed by as he got out, slamming the door shut behind him. Cas dropped down from the cab when he approached.
Benny huffed. “Y’all aren’t any fun.” Taking Dean’s hand, he let him pull him to his feet and tug him a step away from Castiel. “Keep watch, angel, will ya?”
“Hey!” Dean yelled, grabbing his attention. “Shut it, Cas, for fuck’s sake. Benny wants to get out of here just as bad as us. Ain’t helping any being a dick.”
“I didn’t have a choice,” he tried, glancing at Dean. “I couldn’t communicate with Dean any other way—”
Bobby was quiet for a long moment and Dean shifted uncomfortably. “Well, you know yourself best,” he finally said. “But… I’m gonna give you a piece of advice, and you better listen carefully because I don’t have much advice to give. You find a good thing in life, you don’t give up on it. That shit don’t come easy and it only comes around so often. You’d be a fool to let it go.”
“I need you to annul our engagement,” Cas said and Zara’s smile froze. Dean bit back a grin. “Now,” Cas added.
." He swung his arms wildly to demonstrate, and Dean scooped him up. When Jack tried to get away, he turned him upside down, and Jack’s protests turned into screaming laughter which caused more than a few glances their way. Cas smiled despite himself and fixed Jack’s shirt, which was sliding to his head.
The weight of the water-sodden fabric sat heavy in his hands. The sky turned black. He sat by the river.
Unwittingly, he thought of the way Zara looked at Cas, spoke to him, touched him, and he gripped the shovel tighter in his hand. Okay. Fine. Maybe Sam was sorta right. Maybe he was a little jealous. It didn’t mean anything though.
drop me a comment to let me know what you think (i've been super busy lately so im a bit behind in responding, but i promise i will respond to every single one <3)
They ate lunch at a mom-and-pop’s restaurant as they waited for the mechanic to finish, and Cas gave him the pickle from his sandwich. "I'm sorry I never asked you to stay," Dean told him and wished he'd said it earlier. "I never wanted you to leave."
He met Castiel’s eyes like he thought Castiel would understand. And part of Castiel did. Here, away from the watchful eyes of the angels, away from anyone who knew his faults besides Dean, a burden had been lifted from his back which he'd hardly realized he’d carried all his life. No more holding his every action and word up to Heaven’s standards. Simple survival. Kill or be killed. Do what he deemed necessary; no judgement except which he inflicted on himself.
Cas didn’t speak and Dean worried he was going to hang up, was going to tell him this gesture was too little too late. He was on the verge of begging Cas to give him a chance, when Cas said, “I should reach Fargo by tonight.”
“I do you,” he said, getting to his feet and beginning to scoop tiny handfuls of sand on Dean’s legs.
Dean would never forgive himself, even if the fault was entirely Castiel’s. Even if he deserved the punishment he had coming to him.
“He’s too lame,” Claire piped up. Not for the first time, she noticed the healed over piercing mark on Dean’s right ear and pointed to it. “Looks like he used to be cool, though.”
“Come on, Jack,” she said, hurrying to catch up with him, Dean, and Cas. “Let’s go get our ears pierced.”
Dean stifled a laugh at Cas’ hurt expression. “Guess we didn’t make the best first impression at Back to School night.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Dean said, holding up his hands. A bell rang and a teacher opened the door to the school. “Think it’s time to go.”
Castiel went to him and let Dean pull him onto the bed. They kissed and Castiel sighed at Dean’s roaming hands. He felt stupidly happy. No matter the reason, Dean had wanted to see him too, Dean wasn’t angry at him, he was here, and Castiel didn’t know where to put his hands, so eager to touch him, didn’t know how he got through weeks without seeing him—and that’s when it hit him, with a surge of affection filling his chest. A familiar feeling, but he’d never recognized it for what it was.
