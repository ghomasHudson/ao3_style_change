“Only okay if it's you?” DJ asked, and Tony gave him a look.
“Fine, we'll skip him and ask Tiberius.”
Greer let him go, plopping down on a bench and crossing her legs under her.  “What?  It was the closest open room.”
“Look, I just don't show you the...  The naked pictures I drew of you,” Steve said, and he didn't know what he was saying, but maybe it was better to be thought of as the pervert who drew all his friends naked rather than the lovesick idiot who was drawing private porn that he didn't even know enough to keep private.  “Because I have them.  Naked pictures.  Of you.”
“Thanks a heap,” Harris told him.
“Married, actually,” Rhodes said, and Steve smiled.
“Guys try it with me all the time,” Clint said, his fingers walking idly up the length of his bowstring.  “Which is fine with me, if they really want blow job tips, I'll totally give them some.”  Everyone stared at him.  Clint shrugged.  “Like, I got nothing better to do, I could aim in my sleep, so this kind of livens things up.”
Tony took a breath, and another, and Jarvis was right there, right next to him, and he turned, burying his face in Jarvis’ side.  He’d half expected Jarvis to step away, to put distance between them, but instead, Jarvis wrapped his arms around Tony’s head, hugging him close.
"It is not fine, you're a filthy little ragamuffin."
Tony stared at him.  “Yes, Parker.  Yes, there’s a lock.  I put that lock there.  Because it’s three am, Parker, and you’re barely able to walk, let alone bike back to Queens at three am in mid-February.  If you try to do that, you will die, and then your aunt will light me and my restaurant on fire, probably in that order.”
“He took that well,” someone said behind him, right before Harris shut the door with a firm flick of his wrist.  He wandered back towards the bed, doing his best not to trip on the too long legs of his pants.  He heard the door open behind him just as he flung himself face down on the bed.
Steve glanced over his shoulder as Jessica strode in, ready to spar in a pair of yoga pants and a sports bra.  Behind her, Luke was staring up at the ceiling, his mouth hanging open just a tiny bit.  He gestured at Clint. “Parker, what the hell?”
Tony ignored that. “See, I trust you to make those choices, but we both know that when there’s money to be made for a decision, for a judgement call, then there is always going to be men who are willing to make the call that nets them the greatest reward.”  He looked at the window, and he was beautiful in profile, he was the best thing Steve had ever seen, and Steve hated him for that.  “How many of your fellow coppers are on the take, Steve?”
"Yes, but the purpose is to shoot you," Tony pointed out, amused despite himself.  "You may have removed the doubt of what's going to happen, but that just means you know that they're going to shoot at you."
“We don't have much time,” Pepper said, her voice quiet.  “If we want to counter this-”
He probably would.  And would probably have fun doing it.
His mouth felt dry and spongy, and he wondered if he could stagger to the bathroom without opening his eyes.  He was pretty sure he could.  He wasn't sure if he wanted to.
"We are here," he said, his voice very soft and very controlled, "because part of being fine is getting adequate medical treatment when things go wrong."  He was pale, his lips tight and dark circles etched beneath his eyes, but his gaze was steady, his grip strong.  "So if it helps you to say, 'everyone will be fine' as opposed to 'everyone is fine,' than that's fine, too, we can do that, we can work with that, but you.  Need.  To.  Calm.  Down."
The weight wasn’t as foreign as it should’ve been.
“I'm being humored right now," Stark complained, as Pepper passed him off to Jarvis.  He glared over his shoulder at her.  "I know I'm being humored.  Give me that."
He opened the door to his room and stopped short.
“Bullshit,” Tony said, stepping into the room.  His hands were tucked in his pockets, the relaxed pose belayed by the tension in his shoulders.  “Stane said you had him.”
She was already nodding.  “No.  No, thank you, Steve, I’ve got this, I’ve-”  She grinned, her whole face lighting up with it.  “I’ve got this handled, Tony, give me your phone.”
Hammer's shoulders slumped, and Steve set the proverbial hook with a smile. “But if I'm here, maybe Happy...” He let the words trail away, leaving the rest to Tony.
“Shouldn't you be in the gym, waiting for dance lessons?” Jan asked, her hands on her hips.  She was dressed to the nines, her perfectly tailored sweatsuit matching the designer bag in her hand.
“What? Why?” Tony tossed the cleaning cloth back into the bleach water.  “Rhodey’s the good one, Pep. Rhodey’s the-”
“The wall beyond the hay fields?”
“So they happen pretty often, you can return to the laws at any time,” DJ finished.  “It’s…  Important.”
“So what will you do?”  Jarvis’ voice was quiet, almost gentle.
There was a sudden, scrambling motion behind him, the covers pulling away with a sharp yank.  Surprised, Tony fumbled himself into a sitting position just in time to see a pale blonde head disappear under the covers.  Legs hit his under the cover of the quilt and Tony realized, just a second too late, that Steve was absolutely making a break for it.

O'Brien exhaled, a thin stream of blue-gray smoke curling through the air between them.  "I ain't saying that," he said at last, rubbing his forehead.  "He's saying that." He flicked a gesture at the file.  "And we got no reason to say he's lying."
“Excuse me, sirs,” Jarvis said, his voice cutting crisply through the argument.  “It is time for DJ’s maths lesson.” Without waiting for a response, he stepped between them, catching DJ’s hand and reversed direction, as quick and efficient as any soldier in full march.  In a matter of moments, he’d walked in, collected DJ and walked him right back out, handing him off to Peter.  Peter, for his part, nearly sprinted back for the kitchen stairs, DJ bouncing right along with him.
Steve smiled at her, a slight twitch of his lips.  “They've been saying I'm heterosexual all this time.  So people seem to have no problems with assigning labels to me without bothering to ask me.  I don't see how this is any different.”
"Why do I talk to you?" Steve asked, and it was okay.  It was okay.  For the first time in what felt like forever, he was pretty sure that he was okay.  Or that he was going to be okay.  He sucked in a breath, and another, and it no longer burned, the sharp, cutting burn of the ice.  "Why do I-"
Steve considered that.  “That’s idiotic.”
“Yes.”  DJ paused.  “In…  In a minute.”
Instantly, the darkness swallowed him, and he closed his eyes, sucking in a slow breath through his nose.  The air smelled damp, like wet soil and musty paper.  Bracing his free hand on the wall, he descended the stairs, feeling his way with every step.  The box pulled him off balance, and he ignored it, counting each step.
There was a beat of silence, then, “Not my fault!”
"They confirmed they are married.  They're not suing us, or denying it, or trying to-"
DJ nodded.  “Yes.” He kicked his pants aside.  “Stay here.  With me.  Safe.  Safe here.”
“Look, lady, I don’t know who you are-” Darcy started, and Agatha cut her off.
It was a stupid response, and he knew it.  There was nothing up there.  Tony had tied the airspace around the tower in so much red tape that it'd take decades for even the federal government to get through it.  He and Rhodey were the only ones who circled this building regularly, and friends could come and go without triggering the defense systems.
"A lot of people shoot at me," Steve said, and he didn't seem bothered by that.  Tony was pretty sure he should be bothered by that.  "I know how to handle that?"
“Bed.  Now,” May said, her voice sharp, and Peter nodded.
Empty, save for the destruction.
Tony gave her a wary look.  “I’m going to need you to remove all her writing implements,” he said to Rhodey.
Rogers walked the perimeter of the room, checking the windows and ducking to look under the desk, under the vanity table.  Tony, leaning against the wall next to the door, gave Pepper a curious look.  She shrugged.  “Officer Rogers?” she asked, as he crouched down, looking under the bed.
She turned to Steve.  "He's cast iron.  Solid to the core.  But the only reason they can't break him is because he's had the right seasoning."  She patted Steve on the shoulder.  "Go through the fire enough times, and they can't burn you any more."  Her fingers slid free from his arm as she started forward.  "No matter how much they try."
“He was brilliant,” Obie said.  “And unlike many brilliant, technical men, he never let anyone take advantage of him.  He made money for himself.  For his family.  For his legacy.  He raised this family from next to nothing to a powerhouse in a single generation.  He was-”
“Because I found you.” DJ looked up.  “After.  After I got home.  I found you.”
Behind him, Bucky cleared his throat.  “That would be me,” he said, and Nicholas laughed out loud.
Stark turned, and for an instant, that was a relief, until Steve caught a glimpse of the curve of his ass in those shorts.  “Ah.  Agent.”
“So, you woke up and he was there,” Rhodey said.
"Not twelve," Jan said, emphatic.
DJ considered that, his nose wrinkling up.  Tony waited, amused, until he shook his head.  “No.”
"Sir?" Jarvis said, and Tony looked up to see Marcy heading across the lobby, stunning in a ice blue silk dress, draped beautifully from one shoulder.
Benito looked at Harris.  “What?” Harris asked.  Benito gestured at Darcy with his knife.  Harris shrugged.  “Don’t look at me, man, I’m not de-graping her fruit salad either.”
She made a see-saw motion with her hand in the air.  "I'm too exhausted for anything strenuous," she said with a wry smile.  "But still.  I object."
"Oh, you don't have two already?" Ellen asked, utterly deadpan. She leaned an elbow on the arm of her chair and braced her chin on her hand. "I have two."
“Yes,” DJ said.  He pulled the hood of his sweatshirt back over his head, letting the flower crown peek out from  under the fabric.  He smiled at Steve.  “Ties are horrible.”
“Really,” Tony said, because that was not fun at all from his perspective.  He squeezed his eyes shut.  “If I-” He waved a hand at the doors at the end of the hallway, decorated to look like stone, covered in runes.  “If I go in there, will I have to wear a hat?”
“Pie?” DJ asked hopefully.
“I do not do PR duty,” Jessica said, tucking her hands in her pockets.  “That's what we keep Cap around for.”
“Keep at me, and I'll go fetch Hammer back instead of Seamus,” Steve said, and before Tony could come up with a reply to that, he turned, heading through the crowd. “Stay here.”
“Yes, I noticed that,” Tony grumbled.
“My fault,” DJ said.
“You think you're cute, but you're not,” Tony told him.
"I'll take it if you don't like it," Stark said, sinking down to the blanket.  DJ peered at his plate, and Stark set it down, an affectionate smile creasing his cheeks.  "Eat your own food."
“What, Happy’s not ridiculous enough for ya?” Happy asked, peering into the fog.  A man by his feet groaned, trying to roll over, and Happy kicked him in the ribs, making him yelp.  “And not to disrespect your very specialized skill set, Mockingbird, but maybe-”
Rhodes gestured at his shoulder.  “The shield.  Isn’t it heavy?”
“I wouldn’t put it past you,” Tony said.  He rolled to his feet, all feline grace and easy strength, and Steve’s shirt was just a bit too big on him, draping low around his hips and hands.  He didn’t seem to notice, or maybe he just didn’t care.  “I was cold, and it was convenient.”
Jarvis's eyebrows arched.  "Sir?"
Bucky tried to paste an innocent look on his face, and it was such a failure that Shuri was reduced to giggling into her cupped hands.  “Cry,” Shuri whispered, as if Steve wasn’t right there, as if he couldn’t hear every bit of this.  Steve gave her a look, and she leaned forward, her expression gleeful. “I think its working.”
“Have you asked?” she asked, skittering along in his wake, her heels clicking rapidly against the gleaming kitchen tile.  “Have you just-”
"Steve."
“That there may not be fairies,” Steve said.  He glanced at the one window in the kitchen, something his mother had fought and paid dearly for.  There was precious little light outside the dull glass, but there was enough.  “But there’s something else.  Something different.  Something…”
The boy smiled, bright and easy, and held up a hand.  Sue blinked at it, momentarially confused.
O'Brien's eyes flicked towards the ceiling.  "Mother Mary, grant me patience," he said.   He collapsed back into his seat, his weight hitting with enough force to make the wood creak.  He tossed a leg onto the top of his desk, leaning back in his chair.  "So.  You're putting your job on the line for this.  Of all things."
It happened so fast that Steve couldn’t even track it.  Something sliced through the night, so close that he could swear that he could feel the air part in its wake.  The cigar disappeared in the blink of an eye, and a dull, vicious sounding thud came from the wall behind them.
“No, I took his blood, and then, uh, then he said he wanted to shoot someone and none of us were good candidates, so, if we wanted him, he’d be up on the roof looking for a target,” Bruce said.
“He’s already signed for our Food Truck Fridays segment,” Allison said.  She held the phone in Tony’s direction.  “Do you have a statement?”
Obie held up a hand.  “I’ve been briefed,” he said.  He had his jacket over his arm, and he tossed it onto the back of one of the armchairs facing Tony’s desk.  He scraped a hand over his face, letting out a sigh as it dropped back to his side.  “Well briefed.”
“The instructor was very attractive,” Steve said, because that was safe, that was a person he’d never have to see or deal with again.  He rolled his shoulders.  “I just…  Wasn’t expecting that.”
“My long, deep relationship with you,” Jarvis said.  His head tipped forward, just a bit, just enough.  “And my belief that you will not waste the time and effort the staff expends on your behalf.”
Tony collected his drink and turned, expecting to find Steve right behind him.  Instead, he came face to face with two young women.  “Hi,” he said, because they were staring at him, eyes wide behind their masks.  The two looked at each other, whispering to one another.  Amused, Tony took a sip of his drink.  “Can I help you two?”
Obie’s eyebrows arched.  “You were your father’s little mouse,” he said, sucking on the cigar.  The tip flared red, casting shadows over his face.  “Always hiding under a table or behind a chair.”
“I still say cheating is worth the risk,” Bobbi said from the other end of the counter.  She twirled her knife around her knuckles before cutting into a stack of pancakes.  “I mean, if you take your time and-”
Bobbi stared down at the main hall.  “How good?”
He let his eyes close as his lips brushed against Tony’s.
“The Council,” Natasha said.  Carol nodded.  “The Council of Lesbians.”
Tony exhaled.  “Holding steady, for now.”  He shook his head.  “For now.  I’m glad to be home.” He held his hands out towards the fire.  “I might thaw out by the New Year, and we’ll have time to worry about what’s coming.”
“As filthy as possible,” Tony said.  He slipped his phone back into his pocket.  “Eight am?”
"Why are we rewarding this?" Tony asked him.  "Why are we encouraging him to continue-"
Luke appeared next to him, crouching down to peer at Tony's work.  “We good here?”
Tony waved him off.  “Wasn’t expecting such a heavy pour,” he said, taking another sip.  It had a bitter, sharp edge, and he made a face.  “Remind me to try this straight, it tastes terrible.”
“I want a divorce,” he said.
“I don’t want to bring up the lying again-” Tony started, and she reached out, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.  When she pulled him in, he went without protest, aching down to his bones.
“We’re avoiding people,” Tony said, swirling the remains of his coffee in his cup.  “Where’s Darcy?”
“Thanks for your help,” he said.  “And bring Marish by someday.  I'd like to meet them.”
“As usual, then.”
“No.”  It was a single word, soft and light and breathed more than said, but the cup in his hand shattered, the china coming apart like a bomb, like a starburst, tea exploding outwards.
Tony made a half-hearted swipe in Steve's direction.  “Pastry.”
“We'll let you know,” Tony said, cutting her off. He stood. “Thank you.”
There was a thump at the door, and she twisted around, just in time to see a boy with a gap-toothed smile poke his head in.  "Hello, Miss!" he said, his voice cheerful.  "Mr. Hammer's gettin' the files for you." He slipped inside, a battered tray balanced between his hands.  "He told me t' offer you some tea."
“We need YOUR Doctor Strange,” he said, excitement rolling through him.  “Mine.  He’s working.  But two’s better than one.  We need to find yours.”
"Good."  Her head turned back towards the front, and he could see her jaw, sharp and hard.  "The mayor's office insisted that we take someone along as an escort.  I agreed, as long as it was someone familiar with the neighborhood."  Her eyes canted in his direction.  "And this particular
“Iron Man!” Steve snapped.  “Pull back!”
“I ate,” Rhodey said. He was frowning down at the diagram now, his eyes narrowed.
Tony’s ass bounced on the seat, Steve sliding in next to him.  “He’s in,” Tony snapped.  “Drive.”
"I know you're both mocking me right now, but I'm choosing to believe you're being utterly sincere.  It's good for my ego," Tony said, straightening his coat.  Pepper pushed his hands away and smoothed the fabric back down.
He studied her hand, then glanced up.  “And what do you want in exchange?”
“Jan wanted a taste test before the party,” Steve said, picking his way through the website menu.  “It was moderately successful.”  He looked at his notes.  They weren’t much help.
Pepper's eyes narrowed as she did some quick calculations.  "Very expensive, even if we're just going by materials, and I'm sure the manpower cost will push it into 'astronomical,'" she said.  "What is this for, I don't-"
“I was abducted,” Tony said, and Pepper pointed at the door.
Tony's eyebrows arched as he took a sip.  "Think of me as a poison tester."  He nodded at DJ.  "Want to make her another one?"
Steve kept an eye on her, even as he called to Bruce, "I'm going to have to leave his car."
“I'm going!” Peter said, throwing his hands in the air.
Tony shrugged.  “He made it clear his life was none of my concern,” he said, just as cutting.  “He made his bed.  Let him sleep in it.”
“A responsible shopper, that’s good,” Trip said
“And you’re spying on my boyfriend, so…”
“Of course, Steve.”
“We can still run for it,” Sam said to Steve.  “Wanna run for it?”
Steve's eyes snapped open.  He sucked in a breath so fast that he inhaled a corner of his pillowcase and came up coughing.  “Jarvis?” He tried to lever himself upright, and failed.  “Jarvis, what's-”  He blinked at the unfamiliar room, his brain struggling to catch up.  White ceiling.  White walls.  White carpets.  Sheer white curtains layered over massive, floor to ceiling windows, letting the sunlight spill over the massive white bed piled high with piles of white linens.
“I love you,” he said, and Tony’s chest ached as if the words had been a physical force.
By the time he got back, the bread had been sliced into a basket, and there were wineglasses on the table next to the plates.  Tony set the bottle of (really very reasonably priced) Chianti next to them and went for a corkscrew.  “How's it going over there?”
Tony cradled his head in his hands.  “I’m not getting married by Clint of all people.”
Tony sat up, making sure that his hips ground against Steve's as he did. “Good starting point,” he said, sliding his tie off.
"I'm going to do Wookie translation, too," Clint said, throwing his arms up.  "And making fun of the Storm Trooper's attempts to aim.  And point out how stupid the CGI stuff is."
“Morning, sleeping beauty.”
“It’s-” Steve pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes, resisting the urge to swear.  “It isn’t me, Tony.”
Steve looked at him, sensing a trap.  Tony arched his eyebrows.  Steve looked back down at the tablet, scrolling through the dates until the found the first.  He stopped.  Counted zeroes.  Recounted.  “Oh,” he said.
Jarvis exhaled, his face relaxing.  “Sir?”
“What?” Steve followed his gaze.  “Oh.  No, he belongs to one of my neighbors, he's just very good at sneaking in whenever a door is opened.  Sorry, he must've gotten past us when-”
“Does it better?” Steve repeated.  “It’s… Filling a tub with water, isn’t it?  How can he be better than you at turning a tap?”
“Diva hissy fits-” Peter started, and Tony cut him off.
Because it wasn’t much, but it was his, and it was honest.
“Well.  That was quite the tantrum.”
“Right,” Steve said.  He stared at the elevator door.
“I’m TRYING,” Happy said, his voice indignant.  He took an awkward sidestep and Clint had to scramble to keep his feet intact.
Tony nodded.  “That was practical of me.” But he took a big step to the side, safely out of reach.  “I don't see what your problem is, all of my friends would love a legal fund!”
“These paint tubes are empty, Cap,” Carol said, holding up one flat, rolled up tube.  She gestured at it.  “This...  This is empty.  There is no paint left in any of these.  These are trash.”
“That depends entirely on his behavior with the board tonight,” Pepper said, leaning an elbow on the table.  “I’ll be there, either way, and honestly?”  She picked up a fragment of chocolate off of the edge of a plate, popping it in her mouth.  For an instant, her face went blank, her eyes squeezing shut.   When she exhaled, it was long and soft, her cheeks pink.  “I can put his signature on any bills that need to be paid.  I don’t think even he could tell the difference at this point.  Hell, he’s probably glad to get out of the effort of picking up a pen.”
“No! Look, we were dealing with the daddy issues, and I thought-”
Steve stared at him, his eyebrows arched.  “I wouldn't have taken you for a fella who likes musical theater,” he said.
“Your tattoo parlor is amazing,” Jess said.  “Amazing.  I mean.  I asked her how she ended up at the shop and she said she only had two interests, art and stabbing men who annoy her and that tattooing is the only career path that combines the two.”
The boy nodded.  "What-"  He stopped, then forged ahead, the words tripping forward, tangled together.  "What was that like?"
“You gave it to me,” Alison said.
The hardest part, as it turned out, was getting Stark out of the basement.  It was Pepper who was sent into the depths of the house, finally emerging with her arm tucked securely through his.  He seemed confused by the situation, blink up at the clear blue sky with a bemused expression.
“Absolutely not,” Steve said.
“And thank God for that, because I am absolutely incapable of putting up a front all of the time,” Tony said.  He sounded tired, and Steve ducked his head, pressing a kiss to the nape of his neck.  Tony shuddered against him.  “Don't ask me about this.”
“How benevolent of you, sir,” Jarvis said.
“Like I said,” Happy drawled, “the boss wanted a French chef, and he got one.”
The crowd had long since disbursed, leaving only a handful of men hovering on the sidewalk outside the theater.  A few lingering employees kept an eagle eye on the reporters who loitered by the doors, and a couple of bored looking cops chatted on the corner, hands resting on their nightsticks.  One of them looked up as Steve ran past, his eyes narrowing.  But he made no move to stop him, and Steve was glad.  He was getting damn sick of explaining himself.
It took him two tries, three, four, but he managed to open his eyes, blinking hard to clear them.  He didn't recognize the bed he was in, he didn't recognize the tumble of blankets and the fluffy folds of the comforter.  He didn't recognize the sheets or pillows, both in almost painful shade of blue.  The walls, brick and adorned with only a couple of framed vintage posters and a few pieces of art, could've been anywhere, any one of a thousand converted factories or warehouses scattered throughout the city.
He sucked in a careful breath.  “Late,” he said.  She nodded, sipping her drink, and DJ rolled his head in her direction.  “I'm...  Not late.”
He opened his eyes, and Steve was right there, looking at him with an expression that Tony couldn't quite read.  It took him two tries to manage to get words out from lips that seemed to have gone numb.  “Don't I always?” he said, and he was pleased, he was relieved, because he sounded as glib and easy as he always did.
Pepper tried to smile.  “And if not, it’s easily replaceable.”
Rhodey’s hand was holding onto his, and there was red on his fingers, on the white cuff of his shirt.  Blood, spattered across his arm, across Tony’s shirt.  Rhodey’s voice, tense and sharp.  “Home.  As fast as you can.”
Tony nodded.  “I probably am,” he said.  He looked across the lawn, his hand still stroking along the length of Furbro’s back.  “Will you be at dinner?”
One more night.  One more night of pretend.
"Hey, now, don't-” That was as far as Luke got before a wave of eager assistants crashed up against him, tape measures snapping through the air.
He had a lot to think about.
Luke's mouth went tight, his eyes narrowing into slits.  “Do not.”
“As if he’d never existed,” Tony agreed, his jaw tight.  “Pepper’s going to have my head, we’re going to have to start forging his signature on a lot of documents, and soon.”  Steve nodded, and Tony tried to smile.  “You’re awfully accepting of this.”
“Yes,” Tony said, without missing a beat.  “All-”  He spread his hands.  “All the time.”
“Really,” Tony said, staring down at DJ.  DJ grinned up at him, his lips and chin stained red with cherry juice.  “I see we’ve had an unfortunate accident.”
“And I expected you to hold it together and get the job done, that’s what I expected,” Tony said.  He looked down at DJ, his face relaxing into a smile.  “What is this doing back here?”  He rocked forward on his feet, his shoulders canting forward.  “What do you have to say for yourself?”
“The boys are out back in the orchard,” Tony said.
“It is a gift, to a friend,” T’Challa said.  “One who I am sure will use it wisely.”  Steve’s head swung in his direction, and T’Challa smiled at him.  “And your reluctance to take it proves our point.”
He stepped into the bathroom and flicked the light on, nudging the door shut with the side of his foot.   It bounced against the jam, but didn’t latch.  Steve left it like that,
“What the fuck happened, Parker?”
“I make this hat work,” Sam said.  “Seriously, why are you asking?”
DJ hopped down the stairs, his feet together, his hand still held tight in Steve’s.  On the first floor, he paused, his head tipping towards the billiard room.  “Want to check that one?” Steve asked.  DJ nodded.  “All right.  Let’s go.”
Tony took a long sip from his scotch.  Rhodey, used to his stalling tactics, just waited, his hand hanging in the air between them.  Tony gave up. “I might've asked him to move in,” he admitted at last.
DJ nodded.  "Yes."  He looked at Clint, just for a second before his eyes slid away.  "Thank."
Before he could think better of it, Steve reached out, catching the hood and pulling it over Tony’s head.  Tony grinned at him from under the fabric, pushing it back with one finger.  Steve smiled back at him.  “Let’s find you some pants.”
“When he says 'try to fuss over here,' he means 'totally succeed in fussing over her,'” Sam said, easing Steve back to the bed.  “Because she's like that cat who snarls at you when you try to pet it and then bites you when you try to stop.”
Steve watched her, watched the way her fingers curled into fists and then flattened against her thighs.  Watched the way her fingertips went transparent, fading to nothing when she tried to relax her hands.
There was a beat of silence, and then Sam settled down next to him on the bench, close enough that they were almost touching.  When Steve took a breath, his shoulder flexed against Sam's.  “Did you know that the man was a real priest?” Sam asked.  Steve shook his head.  “Or that it was a real license?”
The first time he went past, Sue Storm thought she'd imagined it.
“Well, I’d say that’s his problem, isn’t it?” Isaiah said with a puckish grin.  “Steve, maybe you should-”
Stark looked at DJ, who grinned up at him, the kite now balanced on his head like a particularly flat, wobbly hat.   "It's no good," Stark told him, and before DJ's face could fall, he was rolling to his feet.  "Let's go, Rhodey."
Tony bent over, picking up a book.  The pages were crumbled, and he straightened them, one by one, flattening them against the covers.  “Right,” he said, his voice tight.  “We know that.  So what-”
“Effective,” DJ agreed.
A man stepped forward, one hand coming up towards Happy, and Happy brought the bottle up, swinging wildly.  Cursing under his breath, Steve’s hand snapped out, trying to drag the back behind him.
Stark paused in the act of untying his robe.  “Can you not swim?” he asked.
Shuri made a face.  “I am not hungry,” she said, her voice arch, even as everyone started digging in bags and pouches.  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “I know what this is, this is just a distraction from the very real business I am trying to conduct, and-”
“The only way to survive a conversation with you is to learn to read between the lines,” Steve said, so cheerful about it that Tony started to laugh.
Steve rolled his eyes.  “Jarvis gave it to me,” he said.  “And said I could use it.”
Tony’s eyes closed.  “Gentle,” he said, the word coming out on a sigh, and Steve realized he was smiling.
“I can afford it,” Tony said.
Tony's stomach turned over, his skin icing over in an instant.  Almost as quickly as it had hit, it was gone, his face going hot as he turned to stare at Steve.  “What?” he managed.
“Jan-”
Steve caught himself smiling.  "God, he's good," he said, and Pepper glanced at him.
Tony’s lips twitched in a smile.  “Where are we going?” he whispered back.
DJ looked up at the movie, where some rather creepy looking undead were shambling across the screen.   He looked back at Franklin.  “No.”  Franklin studied him, and DJ tried again.  “I like 'Paranorman.'”
Billy's grin stretched. "Did I say next year? I meant next week."
Jan huffed out a breath.  “No one lets me have any fun,” she complained.  She rested her chin on DJ’s head.  “Tony.  Let me have fun.”
Johnny twisted his head to the side as best he could.  “Are you the bouncer?” he asked Steve with a grin.
“No.” Steve didn’t move.  “We’re not going anywhere, Tony.  You are going to stay here.  Wait for any word.  Happy and I will go and have a chat with Hammer.”
"RIGHT, we're not doing this, I can't-" Tony shook his head.  "Stop the playback, no, nope."
"This is what I'm saying," Tony said, considering his fruit salad as DJ stole one of his sugar cubes.  "I'm thinking you didn't feed anyone in this household other than me, Jarvis."
Rogers' face was red now, a flush spreading over the fine bridge of his nose and his high cheekbones, extending all the way to the tips of his ears.  But he soldiered on anyway, and God, Tony was starting to appreciate the way he just kept charging forward, singleminded and ruthless to his goal.
“Chimney’s been swept,” Danvers said, giving the front door a bump with one hip and shoving it open.  “The Council was afraid that a traveler would take advantage of the relative safety during a storm, and if it wasn’t, we could have a fire on our hands.”
His eyes fell shut.  “Pepper?”  His breath left him in a laugh that sounded almost like a sob.  “I'm not okay.”
Sam stared at him.  "What does that even mean?" he asked, spreading his hands wide.  "C'mon, man, I can't even react to your insults if they're completely nonsensical."
Jess folded her hands in front of her, her expression very serious.  “I’ll buy you a tiara.”
“Oh.”  Rhodey paused, the croissant halfway to his mouth.  His eyes were wide as he lowered it back to the napkin  “Oh.”
“All right?”
He gave his head a shake, and the world slid away from him for a moment, his vision whiting out.  He took a breath, and another, fumbling for his coffee cup.  From a distance, he heard it clatter against the desktop, liquid splashing over his fingers.
“I’d appreciate that, actually,” Steve said, and Nicholas laughed.
Bobbi looked at Steve.  “I’m fine,” Steve said.
“Who said ice cream?” Tony asked.  “I don't remember a word about ice cream.  Are you-”
Steve leaned back. "See, here's the thing," he said. "This country's always had an obsession with forward momentum. With being the greatest, the best, the first. We care, so deeply, about being in the lead, and then, when that first guy's across the line? We lose interest and forget that everyone else is struggling to catch up."
Steve watched him go.  “Why is it,” he mused, “that every question I ask make things even more confusing?”
Tony braced a shoulder against the doorframe.  “I’m going to stop you right there-”
“Gluten free frozen waffles,” Rhodey said.  “Which, you know, it’s a good thing they’re available, for the people who need them, but-”
Tony laughed.  “You could convince me,” he whispered back.  “With very little effort.”
The door to the kitchen swung open, and Pepper leaned in.  “Here you are,” she said, her voice sharp.
Inside, Jess and Sam were both leaning against the balance beam, both of them in identical poses with their arms crossed over their chests.  Clint was perched on the beam next to them, one foot braced on top and the other dangling down to the floor.  Natasha was standing behind him, balanced delicately on one foot.  She raised the other one in a sweeping arc, and Clint ducked under it without even looking back at her.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said.
“Take an honest lie over a complete lack of self awareness,” Tony said.  “Pretty sure it’s better.  Though I’m not sure how.”
Just right for Christmas.
“And the rest of our team,” Steve said, and Tony hear the smile in his voice.
“Oh.  Oh!” Some of the tension went out of Steve’s shoulders.  “Yes.  I mean, yes, I kind of upped the number of guests, because a lot of our guys are, well, they’re pretty big eaters, and even if it’s just dessert, you know, I didn’t want to run out?”
DJ’s shoulders relaxed, his lips curling up in a smile.  Tony gave him a wink.  “Why don’t you just stay here and read for a bit?” he asked.  “We’ll come get you before dinner, all right?”
“Who is ‘they’?” Steve asked.
He screamed, and it was a word.  “Stop stop stop stopstopstopstopstop.”  DJ lashed out with one hand, light pooling between his fingers, licking along his skin, uncontrolled and uneven.  He stared up into the roiling, twisting nothing, knowing that whatever small power he had, whatever he could summon, that was not anything that could stop the thing that was coming, that was already here.  His fingers snapped together in a fist, closing around that small, brilliant light.
Tony tucked his hands in his pocket.  “I've got a meeting, but I've got time for something.”  His head tipped towards the door.  “Can I buy you breakfast?”
“No.”
“Occupied?  Who the hell-” Tony started, just as the bedroom door opened.
Tony pushed himself upright, his hands braced on Steve’s chest, and that was nice, that was so nice.  “I’m getting my fucking flowers back.”
"Raggle muffler!" DJ crowed.
He wanted to kiss him.
Her eyes burned, and she blinked hard.  Rage.  Rage.  Focus on the rage.  “Duck-”
Tony reached back, his fingers sliding into Steve's hair.  “You weren't paying attention,” he said.  “You're the one everyone wanted to date.” His throat ached, his head ached, and he wondered if Steve was planning on staying with him on the couch.  “Flowers and poetry and warm Sunday mornings on your couch with eggs and croissants.”
“You also threaten people with demonic possession,” Clea said.  She sounded amused.  “When your deliveries are late. It’s unbecoming, darling, and honestly, it’s quite dishonest, since you can’t actually do that.”
“You’re both lucky Sam keeps a clean truck,” Steve said.
“He wanted me lost,” DJ said, and neither of them asked who 'he' was.  DJ was glad.  He wasn't sure he could explain without losing track of the words.  He didn't have words for most of this.  He was making it up as he went along.  “He wanted me gone.  So he lost me.  Dad found me.  It's okay.  Creat-” He stopped, his nose wrinkling.  “My dad found me.”
The feed went black.
“She’ll have forgotten about it by that,” Carol said, reaching for a notepad.
Steve grinned.  “Good.  Then there's no problem, is there?”
Steve grinned at him.  “We have the stuff in the kitchen.”
“What does that mean?”  It came out too hard, too sharp, and Tony pulled himself back with a force of will.  “What do you mean, not unduly?”
“Story,” DJ said, cuddling up against Steve’s side.  “Please.”
Tony’s eyes opened, and it took a couple of tries, but he managed to make them focus on the face floating in front of him.  Jarvis looked worried, and Tony tried to smile.  “Jarvis?”
“If they have, I haven’t listened,” Tony said, but Steve was still in his bed, bare and beautiful and getting toast crumbs in Tony’s sheets.  Satisfied, Tony headed for the door.
“I'm here under duress,” Ellen said. Her chin came out at a stubborn angle. “Gonna make the most of it, though.”
DJ took it from him with a grin, the nut disappearing into his pocket.  “Rack?”
Strange considered Steve.  “It is, yes.”
“I was a lost cause years before you, pal,” Clint said, rubbing the back of his neck.  “Hogan.  Hogan, really?”
“Right,” Harris said, and then he waited for Tony to pull the door shut.  He looked at DJ.  “Want to make a run for the bus?”
“I’ll make a fresh pot,” Steve said, pushing himself to his feet.  “Thanks, Sam.”
“Because I fucking can, and I’m fucking going to,” Clint said.
“Right,” Steve said, his head shaking from side to side.  “Let me guess, you just read it for the plot?”
Steve slipped out from under the weight of Tony’s body, settling him as gently as possible back against the pillows.  Tony mumbled something under his breath, but he didn’t wake, his fingers catching on the pillowcase and pulling it close.  Steve took a deep breath, and another, straightening his shirt with hands that shook.  “Come-
She took a deep breath, her shoulders drawing up with the force of it.  “That jacket!”  It came out in a wail, sharp and pained, and Steve recoiled, rocking back a step.  She turned to Jarvis.  “How COULD you?”
"No one invited Hank," Stark said.
“Is boring, and so is math,” Tony said, just to see the scandalized look that crossed Peter’s face.  He hid a smile behind his coffee cup.  “Boring, Parker.  You’re boring the child.  He could be building something now.  He could be DESTROYING something now, and instead-” Tony picked up a piece of paper at random and threw it in the air.  It was more satisfying than it should’ve been. “Math.”
"How long is this movie?" Steve asked, snapping Tony out of his thoughts.
Steve nodded.  “I’ll keep that in mind.”
He felt the muscles of Tony’s arm tighten under his fingers, then relax. “Then go,” he said, his voice shaking with tension.  “We’re wasting time.”
“I was hungry,” Shuri agreed, her eyes tipping up towards Steve.  “Very hungry.”
“He’s admitted setting the fire,” Clint said.  “Claims he doesn’t know about any of the rest of it, just that he was given a lot of money to make sure the boat house burned.”
Steve stared at him.  “That was horrible,” he said, trying to sound disapproving.
“Cold comfort.”  Her chin came up.  “He didn’t want me involved, but by then, I was just old enough to be useful and still young enough to think I was invincible.  He’d trained me to be his lab assistant from the time I could hold a test tube still for him, but I wasn’t particularly interested in running a still, or taking shorthand, or packing boxes for him.  So,  I learned to drive, and I learned to drive well.  Not a job for a girl, but…”
“I would do the same,” T’Challa said, cutting him off.  “You will be leaving this to the Doctor?”
“Well, then, I suppose I love you, too,” Tony said.
“Well, Happy and Thor are ‘patrolling’ with him,” she said with a slight smile.  “I trust they’ll have him poking his nose into all sorts of utterly useless nooks and crannies.”
Pepper grinned at him as she strode back around Hammer's desk to sink into his creaky, off-balance visitor's chair.  "Then he'll fit right in with the rest of the household, won't he?" she said, making Rhodey laugh.  She settled in, crossing her legs at the ankles.  "Honestly, Rhodey, we're walking a very fine line here, so-"
“Enjoy your third divorce,” Tony called after him, gleeful. “Come on, Steve. Let's go.”
“Send me a bill, Janet,” Tony told her.
She studied a set of holographic armor, pulling it apart with gentle fingers.  Plating.  Electrical systems.  Weapons.  Relays.  “Magic is part instinct, but far more of it is careful study.  Learning from those who learned before you.  Rules can be broken, but you must understand the rules before you can come to see how they can be subverted.  A being running on instinct may be able to brute force their way way past a rule, but it will catch up to them in the end.
"Hold still."
Tony made a face. “Cancel some things.”  He paused.  “Like, everything.”
Tony took a deep breath.  “Now that we've reached such a deep and abiding accord, I think it would be best if I were to-”
Tony blinked, shock washing over his features, and then it bled out, leaving only a warm, affectionate smile in its wake.  "I love you," he said, and Steve wanted to cry every time Tony said that.  He wondered if Tony knew, because when he said it, he would lean forward, the warmth of his palm ghosting against Steve's cheek, against his jaw.  His fingers were rough, but gentle, for all that.  "I love you," he repeated.  "And I lie a lot."
Tony looked up, and Clea was there, in front of him, her face unreadable.  “If you’re not here to bring them both back,” he said, his chest aching, “then go.”
She pointed at the plate.  “Now, eat.”
“How did I ever live without you?”
"Harpy," Tony said to Jan.  She brushed a kiss against his cheek.
“Okay,” DJ said, sipping his cocoa.
Peter, clad in his own flower crown, held up a massive red and yellow kite.  “I think there's enough light to give this one last try,” he said, grinning.
DJ nodded.  “I know.”  He stretched out his legs and wiggled to the edge of the bed.  “Love you, too.”
He paused.  “When you have the funds, a great many things are for sale.”  He looked at Steve with steady eyes.  “And far easier to lose, if you have made an error in judgement.”
“Excellent manners, you may have two jars.”  Tony reached for another cup of coffee, and she slapped at his hand.  He gave her a hurt look. “It’s going to get cold!”
He went to pull away, but Steve's fingers squeezed his, tugging him in close.  “Actually, I think that's you,” he pointed out.  “I paid.  You're the one who's the freeloader.”
“Or I’ll have nightmares,” Tony agreed.  He looked at Peter.  “Will you keep an eye on DJ for me?”
“I wind it, and it runs down faster than it should,” Steve said.  He shifted, trying to find a place to stand where he wasn’t in the way.  The claustrophobic space pressed down on him, dozens upon dozens of clock faces staring down at him like unblinking eyes.  He crossed his arms over his chest, trying not to bump into any of the shelves when he did.  “Sometimes, it just stops.”
“I know you are, it’s just…”  Tony’s voice trailed off as the door to the costume shop opened.  Clint ducked out, a tiara on his head and arms full of bags, and Tony gave him a look.
Obie burst out laughing.  “There is that,” he said.  He reached out, slapping Tony on the back.  “Your father would be proud.”
Jess pouted at her.  “Why are you so mean?”
“Janet Van Dyne,” Bobbi agreed, “who loves her fiance and knows him well enough to know that he wasn’t the one who needed to go down to the station that night.  She called in a favor.”
“Let them continue thinking that,” Tony said.  He turned his attention back to Rhodey.  “What we talked about before.  Get Pepper on it.”
Bruce said something to Peter, one hand clasped on the boy’s shoulder, and Tony saw Peter’s chin dip in a slight nod, but he didn’t look up.  As Bruce straightened up, May set the ice pack against Peter’s cheek, cradling the wet cloth against the bruised skin.  He reached up, covering her hand with his, and Tony’s chest tightened so much it hurt.
“No, I mean, I-” She took a deep breath.  “Thank you.  For your help.”
“Surprise,” Tony said, and she looked up, meeting his eyes.  For a moment, she just stared at Tony, expressions flickering over her face, one after another.  Steve waited, amused, for the other shoe to drop.
“Bless you.”  Tony took a cautious sip, knowing better than to trust coffee straight from the pot.  It burned his lips, his tongue, and all the way down his throat, and he exhaled, savoring the heat.  He gave the tray a suspicious look.  “You’re going to put it on my desk, aren’t you?”
“All right, let’s just-”  He pressed, pushing Bucky backwards by a step or two.  “I’ll deal with the cat.”
“I had to change out of uniform, and besides, if I’d shown up any earlier, you’d’ve had me scrubbing a station,” Rhodey pointed out.  He reached across the station to Bruce.  “It’s been a long time, Bruce.  You coming out with us tonight?”
"Yes, because I'm outside, and so are about fifty photographers," Tony said.
He picked up the plate with his other hand, and crossed to set it in front of Steve.  “Thought I’d have this tomorrow,” he said, strangely anxious.  He turned the plate with a twitch of his fingers, centering it on the silver counter in front of Steve.  “So.  Not my best work.”
“Three dollars and twelve cents,” Jarvis said.
“You're flirting with my ex.  Right in front of me,” Tony said, tucking his hands in his pockets.  “The gall of you, Rogers.  The absolute gall.”
“You've been up there for fifteen minutes now,” Jan said, her hands on her hips.  She pointed one imperious finger at the ground.  “Get down here and help me demonstrate!”
He looked back at the billiard room.  “I wasn't expecting him to say thank you.”
“The Amazing Hawkeye,” he said with a nod.
Tony’s chin dipped, a ghost of a nod.  “I need Pepper.”
“Please get the FUCK out of my kitchen,” he said, and this time, people started stumbling, zombielike and awkward, towards the door.  Tony leaned up against his station, his water bottle clutched in a hand that he told himself absolutely wasn’t shaking, waiting for them to empty out of the kitchen.
“Mmm,” Tony hummed into his coffee.  He stared down at the paperwork that Pepper had left behind.  He flicked through the bank statements, scowling down at the balances.  His stomach was churning, and he rubbed a hand over his eyes.  “God, this would be so much easier if these damn numbers would just behave.”
“Could our you do that?” Tony asked, cutting him off.  “Could that be what happened?  An illusion?  So everyone saw him safely with someone else, to give the caster time to get him away from us without a fuss?”
Jan gave her a look.  “It's an evening wedding reception, Carol.”
2. This ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.  I reiterate my usual promise: This is going to be just fine.  Everyone will be happy.  I promise, i know everyone is full of bad ideas, but I swear.  I have a plan. 8)
Pepper peeked over at DJ, who was grinning at her, his face alight with the warmth of it, and she struggled against a rush of warmth.  "Am I encouraging you?" she asked.
Tony waved her off.  “The missing part, then,” he said.  He settled back on the stool, and flipped the small book open, looking for the right page.  It was easy enough to find.  The charring on the edge made it stand out.  “That’s all I need.  That’s all I need, to get it working again.”
“Yes.  Thank you.”  He heard her put down the phone, then the muffled sound of her speaking.  A moment later, she picked up the phone again.  “All right.  He will call now.”
“Neither of you gets to punch the other until I do,” Clint said.  “I have dibs.  And, at this rate, we’re going to need nametags to figure out who the fuck everyone is.”
Nothing good ever came from a knock on the door in the middle of the night.
Jarvis smiled, just a little.  “What’s the harm, after all?  They want something, and if to get it, they have to pay for it, they will.  In this world-” He waved at the room at large.  “Everything has a price.  Everything has a cost.  Why would companionship or friendship be any different?”
“He wasn’t with us,” Clint said.  “I turned around twice, and all three of you were gone.”
“Do you want to try again?” Tony asked.  A nod.  “Upstairs?” Another nod.  “Do you promise me that if you’re uncomfortable, you’ll do whatever you have to do to make it better?”  This nod was slower, but firm.  Tony leaned in, his forehead bumping against DJ’s.  “Will you let me help?” he whispered.
"He IS okay," Bruce said.  "He's here.  I know you don't like it here, he doesn't like it, no one likes it."  He leaned into his hand, pressing against the arc reactor.  "His body is handling this, but even he can stand to get a little help."
Harris nodded.  “Don’t say it,” Tony said, staring at the wall.  “What you’re thinking, I need you not to-”
She held up a hand.  “Tony, it's me asking.”
“It happens,” Steve said.  He glanced over his shoulder.  “He knows it happens.  He's going to teach me how to make rice porridge for you.”
Her smile stretched into something sly and smug.  “Well, if you're offering, I'd take your dessert...”
“So it is with magic,” Agatha said, giving her tea a quick stir.   “No matter how long ago a spell is cast, if one knows the caster well enough, you can see their fingerprints in the work.”  She raised the cup to her lips.  “Morgana is one I know well.  I fought her.  Many times over my life.  I was…  Displeased to feel the echo of her magic, when I thought her long since defeated.”
“Bread's not much of a meal,” Tony said.
“Gotta be careful about those rocks,” Clint agreed.
"Shouldn't you be at a factory or office somewhere?" he asked, tucking his hands in his pockets before he strolled down the stairs.  "I'm fairly certain that you should be-"
Peter blinked.  "That seems harsh," he said.  "Can't you just fire me?"
“A choice has to be made, and-”
“Tony-” Harris started, but Tony wasn’t listening any more.
“What-”
“You sent me into an active wormhole,” Harris pointed out.  “You…  Tossed me into an untested piece of possibly alien technology.  What did you expect?”
Jan snapped her notebook closed.  “Right.  Nat's our honey pot on that one, she'll bring him in.”  She nodded at Luke.  “I'm done with this,” she said, gesturing at Steve.  “You may take him away.”
The cat tipped its head back, rubbing its ruff against Harris’ fingers one last time, then simply dissolved into smoke, its form slowly dissipating into nothingness.  Harris blinked down at the space where the cat used to be, and his nose wrinkled.  “Does…  Does anyone else smell…”
For the first time in about seventy years, he felt like he could blend in.
DJ peeked over the rim of the cup.  “I want coffee.”
“How am I the one-”
He’d learned to stay quiet.  Breakfast, his father said, with that stern, leaden voice that he hated, was for quiet contemplation of the coming day.  He didn’t tolerate talking before he’d finished his meal.  And after he’d finished, he’d stand, greet them both a good day, and take his leave.  Most of time, Tony hadn’t known if he was relieved or disappointed by that.
She gave him a look that could’ve flash frozen fire. “Fuck you.”
Natasha stirred her tea, one eyebrow arched.  “Just how bad a dancer are you?” she asked.
“But if there aren’t any Fairies in America, then how would they hear us?” Steve asked.  His mother gave him a look, and he straightened up in his chair.  “Can they hear us, all the way from Ireland, then?”
He clambered to his feet, and tapped his fingers against the table.  Furbro raised his head, and DJ held out a hand.  Furbro crawled into his hand, and curled up there, instead, a perfect circle of green.  DJ focused on that.  “Can we go?”  The words were balanced.  Equal.  Rhythm.  Breath.
“So,” Steve said, drawing the word out.  “You’re from the circus.  She’s from the ballet.”  He looked at Bruce.  “Where did Stark find you, in the Ziegfeld Follies?”
“Yeah, I would be, too,” Clint said.  He took a deep breath.  “Tell me he's okay.”
This was a tough one to write.  Hope it's a little easier to read.
That won him a tight smile. “No.  You can’t.”
Tony laughed.  “Go get ‘em, tiger.”
"C'mon." O'Brien gestured towards the single chair in front of his desk.  "This is a hell of a mess, Rogers, and you're the lucky man who gets to deal with it."
Bruce stepped back, and Tony slid into his place, a dance they’d done a thousand times or more, muscle memory taking over for conscious thought.  Tony smiled over his shoulder at him  “Good work.”
“Right,” Tony said. “I’ve got the report from science central, aka SHIELD.”  Giving in to the inevitable, he stepped over a case of something that he hoped wasn’t flammable to hand the tablet to Bruce.  “I did give you storage, didn’t I?  I remember something on the plans marked as ‘storage.’  Distinctly recall this.”
"I'll take the room," Steve said, mostly to make the confusing wave of words stop.  He held up a hand.  "Thank you, I'll..."  He gave Jarvis a hopeless look.  "Whatever is easiest for you, Mr. Jarvis."
DJ waved at Steve, who waved back.  “Be careful, and don't cause trouble, all right?” he asked.
“You think you’re funny, but yes.  For the rest of his life.”  Stark pushed the door open, and paused.  “Do-”  He stopped, and Tony looked at him.  Stark’s eyes narrowed.  “Do we need to talk about Mom?”
“Buuuuuut,” she said, drawing the word out, “my brother is a soft touch, and he puts his foot down.  We brought him here, it was nothing of the stranger’s doing, and that meant we were responsible for him.  There would be no tossing him into a boat, shoving him down the river and wishing him well.”  She looked at Steve, her teeth flashing in a smile.  “That was another plan.”
“Thanks,” Harris said, and DJ walked over to the suite’s entryway.
Tony stared at her, his mouth pursed.  “Just for the record, I never agreed to this.”
“I'm sorry, but he's not available to go with you,” Hammer started.  His eyes were locked on DJ, something unstable bubbling there just beneath the surface.  “He can't be rewarded with a jaunt off to the country, not when he's been such a-”  He swallowed, a forced smile slipping across his face.  “Problem.”
“I'd call you rude, but I think you deserve credit for asking the tough questions,” Tony said.  “Bruce made moussaka, a giant-” He gestured with his hands.  “There's like a tray of moussaka, so we have plenty.  And Steve's picking up some spanakopita, and those little, you know, the grape leaf things.”
He smiled.  “No, that’s not-”
"What do you think?"
Tony ruffled his hair with one rough hand, and DJ leaned into the contact.  “Bratbot,” Tony told him, and kissed him on top of the head.  “If everyone's staying for dinner, start picking up, and put my armor back where it belongs, Deej.  You've got thirty minutes to finish up, and get washed up, because I suspect you're all filthy, and we have opinions about that.”
“Punch it,” Steve said, and Tony could hear the slight smile in his voice even over the comm.  “I'll let you know if I'm losing my grip.”
Steve looked at the wasteland that was his bedroom. “How much do you charge?”
“No, Parker, you may not have the key, we discussed this at ten pm.  You are taking a cab home.  You are taking a cab home and then giving me your receipt so that I can reimburse you for your cab.” Tony scraped a hand over his face.  “And this is why there is a lock on your bike, because it is THREE AM.  In FEBRUARY.  And you cannot be trusted to call a cab.”
A moment later, the door opened, and Jan leaned out. “Hi,” she said, her voice quiet.
“I know!” Peter rushed out.  “And it’s not something I should ask, but I think he’s good, I mean, we’re good for him, and he’s good for us-”
Harris blinked at her.  “What?”
“They have time,” Val said.  “Like, you're not QUITE ready for high school, Deej.”
Tony sighed.  "Jan..."
“I should never dream of judging your choices, sir,” Jarvis said.
He focused on the light passing over Natasha’s hair, like sparks in the night.
“Ever,” Tony told him.
“Yeah, yeah, find a couch and sit quietly, I have work to do,” he said.  “Oh.”  He turned away, crossing to the fridge next to the workbench.  “Hank McCoy sent me his newest find.”
“I'm the least likely to get fired if you complain to my editor,” Matteo said.  “Can we get a confirmation on-”
The idea stuck with me, and this came  out of the need to trace a bit of his history in that way.  I understand they hadn't been mentioned before, so they may throw some people. To head off the 'where did Tony's tattoos come from?' comments, the answer is this.
Steve exchanged a glance with Happy.  “You have a description for us/” he asked
Bruce looked up from his own tablet, his eyes darting to Tony, and then back to Steve.  “Thank you,” he mouthed, and Steve managed a smile for him.
Steve made a thin, strangled sound, and then he was moving, fast, almost running down the stairs, carrying Tony with him. Tony buried his face in Steve's shoulder and enjoyed the ride. It was hard and rough, just the way he liked it.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose.  “So, what, this is him trying to impress Santa?” he asked.
“I'll talk to you about this tomorrow,” Obie said, and before Tony could get another last word in, he was out the door, shutting it firmly behind him.
"This doesn't go away," Tony said.  "This goes in your Smithsonian exhibit.  This changes how historians view your relationship with the Commandos.  With Barnes."  He stopped.  "With Peggy."
Stephen stroked a hand over his jaw, fingers sliding over his beard.  “Clea has already begun investigating, and I’ve reached out to a few others who might have an insight as to what’s happening.” He reached for the pocket of his vest, and energy flowed around his fingers, solidifying into something that might’ve been a pocketwatch, in another place and time.  He looked down at it, and light reflected across the planes of his face, washing over him like waves.
Strange shut the doors behind him.  “I could have sworn it was Wednesday,” he said.
DJ considered that.  “Bot?”
He was walking very quickly, that was true, but it absolutely, positively wasn't a run.
The library smelled like old books, like dust and paper, and before he opened his eyes, he knew what he’d see, the massive, curving wooden shelves that stretched to the arched ceiling, the dust motes caught in the late afternoon sunlight, the big, broad wooden tables.  The ladders.  The stacks of tomes, piled everywhere, in no order that he could determine.
“I vote we make the boys do it,” Greer said, her arms crossed over her chest.
“A fact which serves only to be a slight annoyance to the young man.  He's quite determined.  Very admirable.”  To Steve, he said.  “Come along, Officer.  I'll show you to your room.”
“There's some concern that this is a temporary situation,” Pepper said.
Jarvis lead him out of the kitchen and up the stairs towards the grand hall.  Once they were out of earshot, Steve glanced back at the kitchen door.  "May I ask you a question?"
The 'ceremony' was mercifully short.  The 'priest' said a few words, pressed a gentle palm to Steve's forehead, then Tony's.  Tony resisted the urge to lunge for the edge of the stage as the priest gestured at Steve.  Steve, grinning, said, “I do.”
“Thank you, sir.”
One of Tony’s shoulders rose in a slight shrug.  “Perhaps.”
“Because it is,” Steve said, his voice tight.  “Because some things can’t be bought.  You can’t just HIRE people and get-”  He stopped, his jaw locking in place.  “You just can’t.”
“No,” Okoye said, and Steve had to bite the inside of his mouth to keep from laughing.
Steve struggled to find something to say to that, but she didn’t seem to be interested in a response.  She leaned a hand on his bicep and brushed a light kiss across his cheek, and both Luke and Danny  fell silent.  Jessica took a step back.  She patted Steve lightly on the chest.  “Beat that, boys,” she said.
