“You left for the ‘Hebrides’ — transportation from the Hebrides runs awful quick these days, by the by — nearly four months ago, with nothing but the clothes you were wearing as far as I can tell, and now you have a whole brand-new wardrobe which contains a hand-knit jumper, tailored shirts and jeans, and, as far as I can tell, a bespoke jacket. And that’s not to mention a pair of shoes that could pay for your old room for six months.”
It took him a moment to register the soft music coming from downstairs. If he hadn’t been sleeping with his door open, hoping that Sherlock would play tonight after ignoring him all day, he wouldn’t have heard it at all. He pulled on his robe and padded down the stairs. He adjusted his still-erect cock as he sat down on his usual step.
thought John.
“You’d be one of the few people to hold that opinion these days,” said John, shaking his head, but still smiling. “Am I really the only person to ever get a dose of this ‘Aura of Phobos’ and just say, ‘Fuck it?’”
“He’s a consulting detective.”
And Sherlock tended to make himself scarce during any meal more involved than a slice of buttered toast.
you are most definitely making up.”
“Yes,” said Sherlock, when John came up for air, “that feels… good.”
John set the rose back on the table.
(”Come on… John was it? Nobody comes to a place like this for the shitty drinks.”)
“Of course I did! How stupid do you thindk I amb?!”
“Do you luurrrve him?”
“I love you, Sherlock.”
“And when that person is ‘into’ you?”
People who could create the circumstances by which Sherlock would be allowed to die were kept away.
“Any particular reason?” asked John.
He was about halfway down the stairs when he saw that there was an object on the second step up from the tape line — the step he usually sat on — but he had to pick it up before he could tell what it was in the dim light.
“Of course it’s to do with the roses,” Sherlock snapped. He glared at the offending objects sitting next to the computer and sighed. “I was rather hoping that this exercise would… spark something. I’m getting nowhere trying to discover who spelled the damn things in the first place.”
John looked at Sherlock. “Mycroft’s your ‘channel,’ I take it?”
He strongly suspected that Sherlock fully intended to suck him to completion, but maybe because of the blindfold, John found that he wanted something more mutual than just Sherlock’s mouth pulling the orgasm from his body.
John just laughed and tightened the arm he’d flung across Sherlock’s ribs, pulling himself closer to Sherlock.
He turned on the water and watched as it washed the liquid and the glass fragments down the drain.
“We can do that.”
“You said it wasn’t her style, when she was thought to be Merryweather’s murderer,” John pointed out.
The tremors started low in Sherlock’s belly.
He did enjoy the danger. He enjoyed the claws and the hooves and the massive horns. He enjoyed touching them, feeling their solidity, their literal heft and sting. And he enjoyed laying his naked body here — without armour or weapon, without even really knowing what he was doing — nothing between him and the very real damage Sherlock could wreak except trust, except a gossamer thread of faith in the goodness of this man’s heart.
“Who you think can lift the curse.” His voice was low and his enunciation precise.
Right.
The whole effect was aesthetically pleasing. Why his enemy would want to turn him into an large, unusual, but rather lovely satyr was beyond John’s comprehension.
There weren’t even any bruises.
anywhere. And
Sherlock gasped and put his arms around John.
“Two lies in one morning, John?”
John performed the motions Sherlock described, feeling his cock twitch in response to the jolts of feeling that sang along his nerves. In his mind’s eye, it was difficult for John to see Sherlock as completely human. Instead, his mental image was mostly of the Sherlock he knew slouched on the sofa, his dressing gown open like wings on either side of his body as he touched himself with long, sensitive fingers.
“Why not?”
“Like this?” asked John, setting his middle finger against the furled opening.
Despite his better judgement, John got up to do as Sherlock asked.
Sherlock now took the precaution of breathing and moving around a little while John slept. It seemed to have the added benefit of making John’s nightmares less intense. John liked the sounds of Sherlock’s slow, deliberates breaths coupled with the quiet rustling of his dressing gown and the pages of his book. They were soothing — like the sound of nighttime traffic after a holiday in the country.
“Not with iron around his throat.”
Sherlock kissed him again.
It was too late.
He began pulling open the drawers. Belts and braces in this one, socks in the next. He rummaged through them, giving less than one fuck for the mess he was creating. Underwear in the third drawer, jumpers in the fourth, trousers in the fifth. The sixth contained pyjamas, but still no gun.
Sometimes they talked afterwards. It seemed to be the only time that Sherlock was utterly disinterested in discussing the Merryweather case. They talked instead about dreams and music and things they had read or seen that had left impressions on them.
His odd gait was the result of having digitigrade legs. The hooves — solid like a horse’s — explained the sound of his footsteps. His legs, what little of them John could see below the hem of Sherlock’s long blue dressing gown, were covered with a smooth coat of hair the same color as the fur on his hand except for ivory fetlocks. As John’s eyes moved upward, he noted that the bit of Sherlock’s chest and neck that were visible at the opening of the dressing gown were hairless, but the skin was as pale as milk. Even Sherlock’s lips were pale, barely tinged with pink. His eyes were also unusually light, though whether they were blue or green, John couldn’t tell. Those eyes were regarding him as intently as he was regarding their owner, and it was with difficulty that John broke away from that gaze. That was when he noticed that what he’d first assumed to be headphones were actually horns. They grew, thick and black, from the dark curls at Sherlock’s temples. From there they curved close to his skull, not over his ears but around them, and ended in pointed ivory tips near the hinge of his jaw.
“If she hasn’t contacted you in weeks, chances are she’s not fretting,” Sherlock pointed out.
“Brilliant,” said John, meaning to be sarcastic, but finding that he wasn’t. “I’ve been dragged into Oz to meet a Vulcan.”
The first thought to register in his conscious mind was that it was too quiet.
“It’s a blindfold,” said Sherlock.
“That is the truth,” or close enough for jazz, thought John.
“They did, but they also insisted that those stories weren’t real.”
Again.
Sherlock looked away for a second, then back at John. “Does that mean you’ll stay?”
It was pleasant. Especially when Sherlock woke John, saying softly, “John, it’s after three.”
John smiled at the old-fashioned euphemism and reached between his own legs. “They feel good,” he said. “Warm and heavy.”
“Sherlock!”
“Mine.
“Really? You think so?”
He wanted to sit in his chair and watch Sherlock play.
“Like this.” He brought the head of Sherlock’s cock into contact with his own and slid them against each other.
Or the taste and texture of John’s cock?
“You seem taller as well, now that I’m two feet closer to the top of your head.”
“Puny, quiet, and purple.”
John looked down at his foot resting on the first stair. “I was bluffing,” he said. “I wouldn’t have given you the drug.”
“All she’d have to do,” Sherlock explained, “is touch the rose, say ‘
“I think I turned it off,” he said as he came back to the sitting room. “But just to be sure — it’s better to keep it where it can’t pick up our voices. Obviously, the zinc in the rose provides a second channel to someone.”
John busied himself in the kitchen, making tea and heating up a tin of soup, but by the time he went to check on Harry, she was lying on top of her covers, fast asleep. She barely woke as John manoeuvred her under the blankets and tucked her in.
, thought John as he set the alarm on his mobile.
“Good morning, John.”
When John returned to the flat the next day, he found Mrs. Hudson in his armchair, sitting primly with a cup of tea and chatting with Sherlock who had folded himself into his own chair in an almost normal sitting position.
“You could overlook my monstrosity and do some ‘things?’ If I wanted.” He stood up and looked down at John. “Your compassion is appreciated, but no thank you.”
“Yep.
The husband told the authorities that his wife was “prone to odd flights of fancy,” which John thought was rich coming from a guy who had wandered off from his home near the Gulf of Mexico only to end up in Saskatchewan four months later.
“Ah!” she said, smiling at the appliance. “Ingenious. The old one just plugged directly into the wall.”
“Well, that won’t do. Come here.” Sherlock put his arms around him and rolled them over, taking care to keep his weight off John.
John turned toward the kitchen, but it was no longer a kitchen. Bookcases lined most of the walls and there was a sideboard with glass decanters sitting on top. A dining table and chairs took up the centre of the room.
Jane took this as her dismissal.  She curtsied to the gentlemen (her gentlemen) and left the room, closing the door behind her.
“Between the difficulty of fitting myself up these narrow stairs and the sound of my hooves, I have no doubt you’d have plenty of warning of my arrival. I trust that you’d value your life enough to shoot me with that gun you keep up there.”
Sherlock slid his paw back until it cradled John’s head. He bent and kissed him.
“A year?”
Now she was back home and no longer contagious, just tired and congested. John’s only job now was to make sure that she didn’t neglect herself and land back in the hospital with some complication or another.
But it also placed them on an equal footing. Not that John hadn’t found his former “disadvantage” more than a little erotic. Knowing that Sherlock could see him responding — that Sherlock could see the gooseflesh and the sex flush and the tip of his tongue when he absently licked his lips, and his expression, or part of it, when he came, while John saw nothing? John had loved handing over that power, particularly because there was no other choice if he’d wanted to fuck Sherlock.
Sherlock stood and tried to retie his robe. “It’s all meant to remind me that my current form is just an outward representation of the freak I’ve always been.”
Nestled in its blue velvet lining was an antique syringe and an amber glass vial containing some clear liquid. The needle lay gleaming in its own niche, waiting to be screwed onto the end of the syringe.
“Yeah,” said John. “I was just listening to you. To the music, I mean.”
It suddenly occurred to him that she was about to tell him that she was a witch and that she
“You know,” said John, feeling his way toward Sherlock. “I kind of miss hearing you play.”
“Are you going to take my word for that?” asked Sherlock, baring his teeth which were, honestly, the least bestial-looking part of him.
“Do tell?” said Sherlock. “How often do you suppose homosexual men of an appropriate age and complementary temperament to my own walk through that door? I’ll tell you — not even once in one and one-third centuries, John. And even if they did — I can’t and they wouldn’t want to.”
“Are you
“Prat.”
“Very funny, brother mine,” said the man with the package. He stepped around John and unceremoniously dumped the package on Sherlock.
“God, yes. More.”
“I’m… bisexual.” He was bisexual. He just wasn’t used to
But what arrested John’s attention was something he’d not even considered in passing.
“That’s none of your business.”
John took his mouth from Sherlock’s neck and whispered, “Do it.”
And because he was still so angry that he was shaking, he broke the syringe in half for good measure, cutting himself in the process.
“I’ll have to make some enquiries of course, but I believe The Woman killed him.”
“How do you think Moriarty died?” asked Mrs. Hudson.
“See, I knew Mrs. Hudson was feeding me up for something. What’s to keep you from coming up to my bedroom and making a meal of me?”
“Actually,” said Sherlock, stilling but maintaining his grip on them, “your description of… what came next was… thought-provoking.”
And John, who was touch-starved and battle-worn and so very exhausted with keeping a stiff upper lip, had taken full advantage of it.
John nodded and sat up, pulling his legs underneath him. “Even now.”
“Of course that’s why it felt dangerous. It’s meant to keep people out.” Sherlock stared at John as if he were actually interesting and not just the only port in a storm of ennui.
“It’s a joke,” said Sherlock. “I told you. It’s all a grand joke at my expense.”
“Ond a rund? With a caned?”
“That’s not how space shuttles work either,” John replied. “It’s a movie.”
“Well, you have a tendency to shout. ‘No,’ mostly. And on one occasion, ‘Suction!’ I assume you were dreaming about surgery.”
“And that’s why I hate them. They meddle for their own ends and when you don’t play by the rules they set, and never tell you about, they punish you.”
“No need to apologise. Turns out, it’s not as terrible as I thought it would be.”
“Moriarty just owned him then?” asked John.
Sherlock was behind him now, just coming through the kitchen.
“Ah!” said John in surprise, then, “Haah!” again as another thick rope spurted nearly to his chest.
Mycroft just sighed in the general direction of the ceiling, and showed himself out.
“Here.” He held the bottle up.
“How could you know? You hadn’t even met Sherlock.”
“There was never a good time to tell you.”
“Yeah, I’m here. I—”
He breathed into Sherlock, wishing that he could borrow some of that great intellect for a bit.
“I suppose that’s one way of looking at it.”
“I’m surprised it’s lasted this long.”
Sherlock pushed the sleeve of his dressing gown up and nodded toward the crook of his arm.
“What the hell is going on? And don’t tell me you’re babysitting some old army buddy in the effing Hebrides!”
“Moriarty was holding the photos, at any rate. He blackmailed her into being his accomplice. It explains why she took Merryweather on despite the fact that he was decidedly unlike her usual clientele. She collared Merryweather, then handed the leash to Moriarty. Moriarty walked him to the train station, forced him to strip, removed the
“I’m not to be disturbed,” he said on his way back to his bedroom.
“Alright.”
The thing in John’s stomach began slithering up his spine, becoming warm and bright as it went.
But John left that part out too.
In addition to the ladder-back chair and a low chest of drawers, there was a tall wardrobe made of dark wood with a geometric design inlaid across the doors. He went to it now and pulled it open. The suit was hung there, at the end of a line of perfectly-pressed button-up shirts.
“I don’t think I’ve seen it before,” she said.
Sherlock didn’t answer. He just looked at the room as if picturing the damage he’d done to it over the decades. John imagined he could inflict quite a bit, what with those claws and hooves. And the horns — if Sherlock banged his head on the wall, it was the wall that would suffer.
“No. I do.”
He pushed the little cradle that held the earpiece, then let it up and spun the dial once.
“And the people who did this?”
The pocket dimension hadn’t returned to normal.
“I heard you the first time.”
Sherlock frowned.
“Because my mouth is attractive, I believe you once said.”
“Things?”
“They can, if the subject’s not too far gone. Merryweather was decidedly too far gone.”
“Yeah,” said John.
He wasn’t going to do this. He turned and headed toward the door.
“I feel like we should—”
“Moriarty stole the photos then, not Merryweather?”
John looked up at Sherlock’s face. He saw nothing but sincerity there.
Or maybe hope.
still walking around.”
So here they were — John, languid in that way one is when one has just woken up with no particular need to pee or desire to eat or place to be, pressed into Sherlock’s side, his face smashed against the skin over Sherlock’s ribs and his leg thrown over Sherlock’s thigh — and Sherlock, with his paw placed carefully on John’s shoulder so as not to prick him with his claws.
“A great deal of profit. Her clientele was decidedly well-heeled. The story at the time was that Merryweather had somehow got hold of evidence that linked several highly-placed people to her.”
Sherlock’s mouth curved into a mischievous smile. “My eyes and ears in the mundane world — the head of an informal group of irregular… collectors of information.”
“Enough to kill?”
He reached it far more quickly than he’d expected. It was a small circular lamp set in a wall next to a door painted solid, glossy black. The lamp’s top half was shaded, but enough light still reached the brass numbers for him to make them out — 221B.
“You know about that?”
“Yes.
“I’m worried about my sister,” he said. “I haven’t heard from her in weeks, and my mobile’s about to die.”
A monstrous body and…
“I get the picture.”
“And Mrs. Hudson?”
“This one’s an improvement then,” said John. “Um — but about the fog and the lack of… any other living thing, as far as I can tell?”
Harry Watson has an eye for fashion.
(“Come on, John. Stay a little longer. I’ll set an alarm.” Sholto pulled him back down to the bed and kissed him. John nearly relented, but the possible consequences to Sholto if he were found cheating on his wife with a man under his command were more than John cared to risk.)
“You lied to me. You said there was no way for me to leave but to break the curse. You— you’re
Nothing.
“What d’you mean?”
“Yes.”
And the sounds he made drove John mad. He lifted his head again.
But they didn’t kiss.
He turned back and walked on.
And John couldn’t remember ever experiencing anything as purely sensual as Sherlock’s hands mapping his body.
are you playing the violin?”
John set down the knife he’d been using to butter his toast. He reached out and took Sherlock’s paw. He brought it to his face and kissed the palm. It was smooth and resilient, like the pad of a cat’s paw. He lifted his chin and moved the paw down to his neck. He pressed Sherlock’s claws into the skin over the blood vessels on the right side of his throat.
“You have a telephone,” John pointed out.
There was no longer a bathroom, but the door to Sherlock’s room was in the same place.
He sat up and disentangled himself from the cream-coloured quilt.
“You do.”
Sherlock responded with a low growling hum of approval.
Sherlock’s heart seemed to be the one thing that
“I do most of the time when it’s just Sherlock and me, but when there’s company — well, I like cooking, but I like it much better when I’ve someone around to appreciate it. Mr. Hudson, for all his many faults, always liked my cooking.”
“Mmhmm. The whole building’s under an enchantment.”
“Prison and hard labour are fairly effective deterrents, particularly when, like you, I’m not keen on purchasing a simulacrum of sexual interest in the first place. I never encountered an offer to partake in any activity that seemed worth courting years of blank walls and a copy of
“Er, thanks,” said John.
“As you point out, I’ve nothing better to do.”
“Any luck?” asked John as he filled the kettle.
“For you?”
“Yeah, well — you have a lot to be frustrated about.”
John was going to drop it and go to bed, when Sherlock spoke again. “When you were recuperating from your wound, did you ever dream that you were uninjured?”
“Harry?”
But he’d have to wait to find out. He’d been close when Sherlock had started sucking him. He was there now.
“Fuck.” John swallowed. He pulled his jumper over the undershirt he’d worn last night, and shoved his feet, sans socks, into his shoes.
John laughed, burying his face against Sherlock’s chest. “Of course they are.”
The torturing of several cats went on.
“Well, that was unexpected,” said John, his cheek against Sherlock’s chest.
“It’s very nice.” He pulled out a chair and sat.
John reached a hand into his pyjamas and wrapped it around his cock.
“Very good, Doctor,” said Sherlock, rolling his eyes extravagantly.
Sherlock swallowed, and John momentarily entertained the notion that Sherlock really did have a yen to eat him.
“Alright.”
“They’re called setts. Cobblestones are round.”
“I don’t get it,” said John. “How is that a joke?”
The syringe case did not reappear on the mantel.
John grinned. “I wouldn’t blame you if you let the kitchen do everything.”
But he couldn’t see, and not knowing what Sherlock would do next, nor where he’d do it, had arrested every ounce of John’s attention. He found himself straining upward, in what he assumed was the direction of Sherlock’s mouth.
“I know that, but she’s over the worst of it,” said John. “She just needs someone to feed her up for a bit.”
“Wonderful as usual, Mrs. Hudson.” John sat back in his chair, cradling his wine glass with its last few sips of Burgundy.
“Jane.” It was Mr. Holmes who broke the shocked silence.
“Not always.”
“More here?” asked John, increasing the pressure on Sherlock’s testicle. “Or here?” He carefully slipped another finger under Sherlock’s foreskin.
But John Watson — coming home from the funeral of a family acquaintance he hadn’t seen in decades but whose death had prompted Harriet Watson to bully him into putting on his best suit and attending — John Watson did not walk on. He stood, leaning on his cane, and allowed the slight frisson emanating from this bizarre weather condition to wash over him.
The second option was only slightly more likely than breaking the curse – that’s what Sherlock had said.
“None was found at his residence. However, it was common knowledge in her circle that she kept compromising photographs of her clients as ‘insurance.’ Merryweather could have found them, and she would most definitely want them back.”
“There are only two people who knew that he supposedly lived there — Merryweather and The Woman. Merryweather wouldn’t have dared to cross him unless he was cornered, and The Woman wouldn’t have been so sloppy. She’d only have come looking for something if she knew it was there and how she could access it. No, this is all unquestionably staged for my benefit. And if Lestrade ever gets back to me with the information I requested…” Sherlock looked at the brass clock. “…over three and a half hours ago, I’ll know what Moriarty’s real intentions were.”
“Would you kiss me again?”
“Every game has rules,” said Sherlock, “even Cat and Mouse.”
“People pay him to solve crimes,” said John.
“Why not just ring him up?”
?! What was he thinking? He’d long ago lost track of how many women he’d pulled over the years. He was charming and funny, and women enjoyed his company. They seemed to enjoy his bed as well.
Sherlock smiled. “It required a great deal of ‘juice’ to create, but once in place, the pocket dimension greatly reduces the cost of maintenance. Mycroft is another story. He lives in the mundane world. Once he’d managed to create his brother’s keeper spell, Moriarty was forced to supply the magic for that as well, and that does make a noticeable dent in his power.”
“What are you writing?” asked John one day, about two weeks in.
“I made a grave error,” he said. “When I told you I could hold the door for three days, I was sure I could actually manage it for five. But there was one factor I didn’t know to take into account — Moriarty is dead.”
That got Sherlock’s attention. He leaned toward John and said, “You saw the fog?”
“There’s no lasting harm done, John.”
Well, that‘s what he’d done during the day.
“Ask me next time I bang my head on the lintel,” said Sherlock. “How about you?”
“Yeah? Well, in my vast experience, if I’m doing all of this, my partner is responding. Otherwise, I’d question whether they really wanted it. Do you? It’s okay if you don’t.”
“He’s too weak and the pocket dimension is too small,” she said. She reached into her skirt pocket and drew out a big, old-fashioned iron key. “Use this.”
“I— what’s like a lion’s?”
Sherlock touched the rose. “
“I wrote it, actually — when I had the urge to play. I wanted to know what it sounded like.”
“You know I can’t,” said Sherlock, but the ice hadn’t crept into his voice, so John took that as an encouraging sign.
Sherlock stopped walking and looked straight ahead. He seemed to see something other than the street and the fog. He closed his eyes and shook his head as if to clear it. His eyes, when they opened and met John’s, seemed more uncanny than ever.
. He shook his head to clear the thought.) Sherlock's prick was easily as big around as a cricket ball — two of which he appeared to be carrying in the sac behind it.
He supposed he should be using the time while his sister slept to pick up some groceries.
“Well, it’s beautiful,” said John.
“John?” Sherlock’s voice was tense and… smaller somehow. “Don’t come any further.”
He checked Sherlock’s pulse. It was still strong.
Sherlock was sitting slouched in his favourite chair in front of the fire, his long legs stretched so far out that his crossed hooves were under John’s chair. He looked up at John’s entrance, surprised.
“I really don’t want to talk about it,” he said.
“It’s a faerie story, John.”
“Ow! Fuck!” Something fell on the floor, presumably a very hot piece of burnt toast.
Surprisingly, it went through. The “typing” icon came up straight away.
“Of course,” he said absently, as if his half of the conversation no longer occupied his mind at all.
Sherlock groaned as warm fluid spurted against his stomach, and shuddering, he added his own before collapsing with his head next to John’s on the arm of the sofa.
So John listened. He sat on the cold, hard stair and let Sherlock’s song fill him, let it swirl around his body, let it reverberate in his chest and vibrate in the stiff flesh of his cock.
“So what’s next?”
“If you conjure up an Rx form in your magic drawer there, I could prescribe you a patch,” said John.
“This body really doesn’t bother you?” he asked.
“Why day after tomorrow?”
One part of John’s brain was musing on whether or not he’d ever actually seen a horse’s penis and how Sherlock’s member might compare to it — he was fairly sure that horse cocks were shaped differently. The rest of his brain was trying to remember something very important.
“Insults have really degenerated since my day.”
An overdose of cocaine?
“I believe that’s the currently popular term.”
John sat up and looked at Sherlock’s still face.
“I’m betting it is,” said John. He decided it was time for Sherlock to play this game too. “What would you do next?”
“What should I tell you then?”
“You said you knew how it had been done,” John prompted, hoping to get Sherlock back on discussing the case rather than performing what felt like a psychic vivisection.
“Would you like that, Sherlock? Would you like me to ride your cock? Would you like to fuck me?”
John smiled despite himself. He wasn’t sure what he’d been expecting, but it wasn’t this. Perhaps if Sherlock had conjured a legion of familiars to whisper the facts of John’s life it would have been less surprising.
“Even now?” asked Sherlock.
“Any idea who did it?”
He stared at John for a rather gratifying moment, then held out his paw.
“This is only conjecture,” said Sherlock, “but probably in her kitchen brewing herself a bracing cup of tea. She’s had a very trying day.”
“And eventually she met that person — a man who thought she’d hung the moon and stars, and if she loved him a bit less than her old lover, well, she loved him enough. They married and had a baby.
“It sounds made-up.”
Sherlock shrugged dismissively. He and John had pored over the photographs of Dain’s “home” for hours. What Sherlock had at first assumed were photographs of Dain’s acquaintances turned out to be artworks featuring celebrities. If it weren’t for John, Sherlock would still be trying to puzzle out who some of them were, but Sherlock wasn’t terribly thrilled with being dependent on John’s knowledge of pop culture.
He turned and hurried back through the flat, and up the stairs.
“What would Merryweather do with them?”
“...Bisexual,” repeated Harry.
He took it and opened it.
Sherlock made good on his word that night. When John came downstairs (after pausing to put on the blindfold, of course) Sherlock led him through the kitchen and into his bedroom.
John shoved his hand between them to hold their cocks together as Sherlock arched and shook under him.
The look on Sherlock’s face as he twitched the robe back over his lap reminded John of that very important thing — it’s rude to stare at someone’s prick uninvited.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So how would you show me that?” asked John.
He could feel the tension in Sherlock’s neck and in the shallowness of his breathing. He was nervous. Understandable — even if this hadn’t been his first time, it would’ve been the first time in more than a century. John would gladly have pleasured Sherlock all night, let him explore and experiment to his heart’s content until there was no room for nerves or fear or hesitation.
“Where’s the slipper?”
They fell quiet again for a few scenes. Guy and Lomper (The Ginger One’s name was Lomper. John remembered as soon as one of the other characters said it.) held hands at Lomper’s mum’s funeral.
“Yeah.”
“Where’s the blindfold?” asked John, keeping his eyes tightly closed.
John tied the fabric securely over his eyes.
, John thought. “I used to enjoy it, you know, back in uni, when I had to write a paper… or something. And the house tends to give me things it thinks I’ll like.” John blushed, remembering the dildo.
Whatever Sherlock hadn’t gleaned from observing the goings-on in 19th century bordellos, he was learning with John right now.
“Does it hurt?” asked John. “Changing back?”
“Yeah?”
John took one hand off Sherlock’s waist and placed it on his chest, fitting the hollow of his palm over Sherlock’s pectoral muscle. He rubbed gently, searching for the elusive male nipple. It only took a moment for it to stiffen against John’s caress. He took it between two fingers and rolled it.
, on the other. She then gave him over to an associate or associates, apparently to be murdered.” Sherlock touched a claw to the oddly angled leg of the victim. “Another reason to avoid romantic entanglements.”
“Oh come on, John,” she wheedled. “You can tell me.”
“No,” whispered John, still straining to hear another heartbeat.
Truthfully, John had thought there’d be more… touching and pillow talk. That clearly wasn’t happening, and now that he thought about it, he realised that he’d been perhaps a little delusional to expect it.
“Heart condition?”
“Hayes? This ought to be good.”
“No. No new ones, anyway.”
“You have the whole world too. Or as much of it as I do.”
“Okay. Firm and slow it is,” John replied as he began to stroke himself. “Sherlock?”
“Are you sure, dear?” asked Mrs. Hudson.
“Mycroft’s been by, I see,” he said, gingerly prodding the rose. It was hot from the magic flowing through it. “Sorry I missed him.”
“Like this?” whispered Sherlock, his lips still touching John’s.
“John?”
Sherlock sighed. “The problem is they can’t just kill each other for grudges. You can imagine why. Only a handful are born each century. They’d exterminate themselves within a fortnight. Killing Merryweather, even indirectly, would bring the entirety of the Fae down on the offender. Which brings us ‘round again to The Woman, and… I just don’t buy it.”
“You have to make a choice — music or sex. I can’t do both.”
“Break in the case?” called John as he filled the kettle.
, thought John.
“Good?” asked John.
The woman seemed as taken aback at his appearance as he was at hers. She recovered quickly though.
“So you admire her, but you don’t give a damn where she’s buggered off to?”
“Ugh! I gave up smoking! Not that I had a choice.” Sherlock turned in place, eyes darting around the flat. “I need nicotine.”
“Really?”
“By doing what?”
“Out of the goodness of his heart?”
“But after that?”
Soon the sounds coming from the vent turned to the familiar noises of the gentlemen (her gentlemen) engaged in... relations.  These sounds had dismayed her at first, years ago, when the noises of bed sports were connected in her mind only with the sordid acts of the cheap bawdy house where her mother had worked.  But when those other, awful sounds (sounds like the crack of a fist on flesh, sounds like cries of pain, sounds like mocking laughter, sounds like weeping and scolding and vicious words) did not follow, she had become easier in her mind.  The sounds the gentlemen (her gentlemen) made were of a very different kind – sounds of laughter over a shared joke, sounds of comfort, sounds of praise and affection.  They were her lullaby on some nights and her inspiration on others, for they were the sounds that filled her ears on the nights when she pulled her nightgown up and slipped a hand down between her legs.
“John Watson,” she said, shaking her head in exasperation. “You’re the most suitable person to ever come through here.”
“God, John.” Sherlock’s voice was breathy and shattered. “That was… Did you orgasm?”
“There never is, John! And anyway, why do you have to drop everything and bugger off to the Hebrides to— to—” She snorted. “Ah, fuck.”
Over and over he drove them together, driving Sherlock closer to orgasm, he hoped.
The next day brought a visitor to the flat. John was sitting in what he supposed had become his chair now, since Sherlock seemed to prefer the other. He’d wheeled the telly over and was attempting to find something to watch. Mrs. Hudson had been right that every channel was available, even streaming services. John was trying to figure out how to get Netflix to work with the ancient remote and its three clicky buttons when someone knocked on the door.
John glanced at the clock — 3:20 a.m. — “the witching hour,” as Sherlock had called it. Well, there was no prohibition on him crossing the landing to empty his bladder, so John got up and threw on his dressing gown.
He and John were sitting in their chairs in front of the fire, tumblers of scotch and soda at their respective elbows.
“Well, they’d hardly allow women into the locker room.”
“So what do we do while we wait?” he asked
Sherlock pulled off John’s cock with a slight pop.
that fear intimately.
“Ugh! Feel lousy! Calling in. Why r u not here bringing me broth, ffs? Some doctor u r!”
“Will you miss the horns?” asked Sherlock
Whether Sherlock meant that he hadn’t expected John to do that or whether he meant that he hadn’t expected to like it, John didn’t know.
Sherlock had come around to accepting full and prolonged physical contact despite not understanding why anyone would even want it while he was all horns and hooves.
It wasn’t really a question, but John answered it anyway.
That was the release Sherlock had sought months ago when he’d attempted for a second time to goad John into giving him the drug. John would have been evicted from the pocket dimension and Sherlock would finally know what it was to love someone and lose them.
John shook his head. “I was walking around in a fog way before I found Baker Street. I was so far gone that fear felt like home. And way before you loved me, you helped me – because that’s the kind of person you are, Sherlock. You took that great big intellect of yours and all the restlessness and quirks that come with it, and you trained it to help people.”
at 221B. John hesitated to use the word “routine,” but there was some semblance of a pattern anyway. Every morning he checked to see if his mobile had signal. On the fifth morning, by some miracle, it did. Seeing no sense in alarming anyone with some kind of call for help when he had no clue what kind of help (if any) he really needed, he simply texted his therapist and his sister.
paying attention, as a matter of fact.”
“Alright,” John chuckled. “I want you to sit on the sofa. You can keep the dressing gown on. Unless you enjoy sticking to the leather.”
And with an erection that could pound a railroad spike through a cement slab.
“No!” shouted John.
And again — until John had clarified to Sherlock’s satisfaction just exactly what he meant by “things.”
“God, but you’re a gift, Sherlock.”
John’s hand sped up. Slow and firm might work for Sherlock, but John preferred fast and light when no one had thought to tell him to bring lube. It didn’t take him long — the situation was so unusual and erotic that he had already been nine tenths of the way there.
The man in the suit offered his hand to John. “Mycroft Holmes, and you are Dr. Watson.”
John decided it was best to sit down again. “I see.”
He allowed it to wash over him and grow until it became dread.
“Jane, I’m sorry for this... unpleasantness.  Please come down.  We need to speak to you.”
John took the cable upstairs and plugged his mobile in to charge.
thought John. “I know what you mean.”
Or maybe he’d have simply watched Sherlock’s face as he came undone.
John looked around. Except for the faintest silvery strip above the heavy curtain drawn over the window, not even a shadow could be seen.
“An eight-year-old could sort that out. You’ve wandered into an enchantment, Dr. Watson. One doesn’t just waltz back out again, you know, or did your parents never read you fairy tales?”
Sherlock was standing in front of the open fridge, staring at the brass rose, when John came downstairs.
“Yeah, it’s fucking magic, alright.” John leaned up on his elbows to watch Sherlock.
John checked Sherlock’s pulse. It was weaker. Dust coated the chest of drawers across the room.
Sherlock lay himself next to John and kissed him.
“Really?” John found Sherlock and took hold of his the front of his dressing gown. “Because, last I knew, most of the action part of violin playing takes place above the waist.” He pulled the garment open and knelt at Sherlock’s feet. “I’m out of the way down here, yeah?”
John lifted Sherlock’s cock again, pulling back Sherlock’s foreskin, and took the head into his mouth, if just barely. He licked and sucked at it, his eyes on Sherlock’s face when Sherlock opened his own eyes in time to watch John grasp him with both hands and stuff the tip into his straining mouth.
“Heavens!,” exclaimed Mrs. Hudson. “Don’t children read fairy tales any more?”
“Any requests?”
John laid Sherlock’s cock down against his belly and straddled his thick thighs. He applied what was left of the lube on his hands to himself. Then he leaned forward and thrust slowly, dragging his own hard and aching cock against Sherlock’s.
“Jane,” began Mr. Holmes, “I cannot apologize enough for the shock and dismay that we must have caused you.  I know you to have a good mind, Jane, so I won’t insult you by attempting to explain away what you just saw.  Please don’t be frightened.  I understand that you will want to be away from such unnatural goings-on, and I am prepared --”
He stood up and took his dishes to the sink.
“It’s what you said last night.”
“Where is she now?” asked John.
“So, turning you into a… this,” said John. “You said this was supposed to humiliate you? By what? Wounding your vanity? Because you don’t really seem the type. To be vain about your looks, I mean.”
“Do you like it when they’re stimulated?”
“Yes. And others like you who weren’t paying attention to where they were going and wandered into the fog.”
“Sherlock, all you wear is a dressing gown. I’d untie the bloody thing and reach in.”
He wanted to feel it.
Possibly dating John and solving crimes? John thought he could be useful with that — fill in some holes in Sherlock’s knowledge of the last few decades anyway.
“It’s almost four, John. You should get some sleep.”
“This takes a lot of juice to run, does it?”
“Sounds like you want a commitment before you go to all the trouble of telling everyone you’re gay.”
“I did something far more ungrateful than just forget to send a note,” said Sherlock. “But you’re correct. It is a great deal of trouble. Apparently, I’m worth pulling out all the stops.”
“It’s precisely because he helped Merryweather before that I suspect him now. If he didn’t want to pay the price for his little prank, it needed to be someone whose life was already forfeit to him.” Sherlock held up a finger to stop John from heading upstairs. “Of course I don’t have proof. That’s your job. Let me know as soon as you have it.”
“This is Dr. John Watson,” said Mrs. Hudson.
But the signal was gone again.
“What do you do?” asked John.
And oh, that was… that was perfect — wet and warm and clasping.
He could feel Sherlock’s paws on his back and arse, stroking and petting him.
“The hour’s almost over, John, and I want to climax before it’s too late.”
John opened his eyes to another pale grey morning. He rubbed his face, trying to dispel the nightmare. For once, his bed showed no signs of him moving around in his sleep.
“Oh, John!” she cried, grasping his arms. “He threw me out!” She saw the door behind John and her eyes went wide. “The pocket dimension is shrinking! You’ve got to go in there.”
He sat back down and slipped the dressing gown off his shoulders. He pulled his t-shirt over his head and put it on the pile with his other clothes.
“John, I swear I planned to tell you day after tomorrow. This just started two nights ago. I suspect it may be because you broke the vial.”
“Haah!” Sherlock let go of John’s cock and let it slap against his belly.
John pulled off his slippers and set them aside a few steps up. He stood and undid the tie at the waist of his pyjamas. He let them fall and stepped out of them. He placed them with the slippers.
John swallowed as something squeezed his heart. “Come back down here,” he said, his voice rough with emotions that he didn’t want to examine right now. “I need a few of the unholy kind too.”
John set his lips against Sherlock’s neck again, and added a bit of suction to the mix.
“Which would be…?” he prompted.
Something was finally happening to him.
“Someone tried to strangle him,” said John, moving on to the second photo — a closer shot of the man from the shoulders up.
“Why would I put my hand on your face?”
Several alarmed stares — but no fog.
spell was clearly no longer in effect.
“7%,” it read.
“He lost
“It’s very neat in here,” said John.
Sherlock, it turned out, had witnessed a pretty indecent range of debauchery back in the day, and was keen to try some of it out. John, whose experience with same-sex fucking had been mainly of the quick-and-dirty variety, was more than willing to participate. So far, he’d ridden Sherlock in Sherlock’s favourite chair, eaten Sherlock out and fucked him bent over said chair, spent nearly the entirety of one of their hours on the sofa,
“Nine-thirty?!” He snatched up his mobile. “9:28” the display read. There was no alarm set.
When John got downstairs, Sherlock was on his telephone. He nodded toward John.
“Sherlock!” he shouted. “Let me in!”
“The pocket dimension?”
And between them it became something very like compassion and empathy — and tenderness.
John grinned and proved the depth of his depravity by pilfering a biscuit from the tray on the side table.
The music stopped.
“Right,” said John. “I’m just going to go read for a bit.” He headed for the staircase.
fond of horses?” asked Sherlock.
“You said… You said you’d open my dressing gown and warm yourself on me.”
“I’d like to help with that,” said John, nudging Sherlock’s cock with his own.
John supposed that the violin could be Mycroft’s, and that he came over to play it occasionally in the middle of the night, but dismissed that thought immediately.
“I’m a conglomeration of beasts, all meant to humiliate me,” he explained, indicating his figure with a theatrical sweep of his arm. “I’m being punished, you know.”
Sherlock placed a very well-lubed palm against John’s.
The lube bottle dug into John’s hip. He really should have taken it out of his pocket before lying down. He wriggled his hand down between himself and the cushion and pulled it out.
“Rules?”
Sherlock snatched it up.
“Or unicorns, in this case.” Sherlock picked up the top photo and stared at it again. “This ‘poor bastard,’ Virgil Merryweather to his human friends, managed to release a burst of magic — a large enough burst that several faeries came to investigate its origin. They were the ones who identified him. Otherwise, this would have been a case of a random John Doe killed in a train station. Someone wanted this hidden from the Fae, at least for a time. That much is clear.”
“It’s magic,” said Sherlock. Then he licked John’s left testicle and put his mouth back on John’s prick.
“What did I promise next?” asked John, brushing his lips against Sherlock’s throat.
“As long as I can take you with me on some of those things,” said Sherlock. “As long as I can come home and sit in our chairs in front of the fire with you—”
“Perhaps I should delete it, then.”
Eventually, John asked her about the others who had come before him.
“How did you meet him?”
Sherlock has some... unique ideas on how to break the ice.
Whoever was on the other end went on for a bit while Sherlock broadcast his boredom to the cheap seats.
“Your ignorance is positively illuminating,” said Sherlock, getting up and striding over to the desk.
“Thank you,” said Sherlock.
“I’m holding you to that,” said Sherlock.
But he couldn’t, so John kissed him instead, muffling Sherlock’s ragged growling cries with his mouth — surprising himself when he, too cried out as he came.
“What kind of tone?”
“Well, of course, she used the wish,” said Sherlock. “And the faerie lived up to his side of the bargain — after a fashion. See, she was supposed to have used the wish years ago to get her lover back. Her lover had been the faerie all along. It was some kind of test, to see if she would give up her dearest possession for him. Then he would reveal himself and declare his undying love, and she would fall into his arms, and they would live happily ever after, as one is supposed to do in faerie stories.
Suddenly Sherlock smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners in unabashed delight.
(”Come on, John. It’s situational. It’s not like we’re really homos.”)
“It’s just — once you start talking about someone, it changes things, you know?”
“Can you tell me what that is?”
“Thank you. Once upon a time there was a beautiful and intelligent young woman...”
“If I was going to make something up, I’d have told you his name is Dave. You’d believe I was dating a Dave.”
John insinuated his hand between their bodies and took Sherlock’s cock in its slick grasp.
“You think?”
“My reputation has preceded me?” asked John, shaking Mycroft’s hand firmly, but not hard enough as to seem insecure.
Something that understood what Sherlock feared he could do with all that sharpness and strength.
“That’s it? Just — ‘Wizards did it?’”
Sherlock.” John grabbed his mobile and was out the door.
Mrs. Hudson went to the refrigerator and removed a small dish with some sliced lemon on it. She slipped one of the slices into her own cup, then poured tea over it. She sat down opposite John and took a sip.
Sherlock scowled. “Why?”
Sherlock pointed to the drawers behind John. “Try the…” He waved his hand a bit. “…second from the bottom.”
“What do you mean?” John was hoping she wouldn’t compliment his butt.
This was the third morning this week that John had dreamed of Sherlock dying while he stood by, powerless to stop it.
, John thought.
His hand was on the knob when he felt Sherlock’s paw touch his arm.
Jane stood and straightened her apron and her cap.  She needed to remain calm.  She didn’t want to be turned out of Baker Street, even with an excellent letter of recommendation.  She set her face into a servant’s mask of impassivity and opened the door to their rooms.
John supposed it was too early to be using terms like “friend,” but really… Sherlock didn’t have to be quite so appalled by the notion.
“I’d put my arm around your waist. I’d pull you closer to me. I’d… enjoy the feeling of your body against mine. I’d splay my hand over your waist so that I could feel the play of your muscles and bones as you move. I’d press my fingers into the adipose tissue above your hip. I’d kiss you deeply, Sherlock, thoroughly. And when you needed air, I’d kiss your jaw and that gorgeous neck of yours.”
“Bedtime story? To help me sleep?”
Sherlock scowled. “It feels good,” he admitted. “When you touch it. When I do, it’s just...” He held up his claws. “...painful.”
“A cabhorse…? Sherlock, how long have you been here?”
“They were for me.”
“The guy who cursed you?”
, do you think people are going to say, ‘There goes John Watson and his boyfriend. John’s not gay, though. He likes pussy too, so it’s alright?’”
“And then you were crushed by the realisation that everything was indeed irrevocably different.”
“You don’t just nip ‘round to the Faerie Tesco?” said John.
“Oh, no. I have to stay.” She set a cup of tea in front of him. “Do you take anything in it?”
“Sherlock?”
“And a carefully staged crime scene?”
“How d’you know there was an associate?”
“Mmm. Nice.”
Sherlock moved past John toward the fireplace. John turned to watch him as he flopped himself into a low leather-and-steel chair that John was sure he’d seen in a museum once. “In addition to my grotesque appearance, I keep odd hours,” said Sherlock, as if Mrs. Hudson and an awkward staring contest had never interrupted the conversation. “I am often doing experiments, and this —” He gestured at his dressing gown. “— is as ‘dressed’ as I ever get for obvious reasons. But hopefully my… eccentricities won’t be too irksome during your unavoidable stay here.”
After that, they finished their tea in silence.
John laid his body down beside Sherlock’s, sliding his feet back under the covers until they touched Sherlock’s ankle.
“A joke?”
The next night, John woke to the sound of the violin at seven minutes after three.
“They’re both fantastic. I...”
“Hooking up a telephone in Faerie is much more difficult than giving someone an enchanted object.”
“Shh. Just kiss me.”
“Tell me how you touch yourself when you want to come.”
“Yes, of cour–“
Probably not even much time, he thought.
“Bi— bisexual,” supplied John.
Sherlock stroked John’s thigh with the pad of his paw. “My claws are sharp, and I don’t always control them well. Practically every surface in this flat has repaired itself from scratches.”
John slid to the edge of his seat and put his hand on Sherlock’s knee. “You’re the man who saved my life.”
At this, the dark form that was presumably Sherlock’s body began to unfold itself, and John watched, awestruck, as the pale oval of Sherlock’s face rose until it was swallowed up by the darkness above the shade of the dangling light.
It was John’s turn to gasp and whine.
“Why go looking for zebras?”
“Yeah,” said John, mustering a smile. “Just a nightmare. I was running outside and slipped on the cobblestones. I had that feeling like I was really falling.”
“What’s this?”
“Are you alright?” asked Sherlock.
“A few hours ago?”
“I fail to see,” growled a deep voice, “why every stray that washes up on the doorstep somehow belongs to me.”
He got an auto-reply from the therapist’s office saying that his message had been received.
Sherlock laughed. “If it makes you feel any better, I spent my first night with human hands engaged in a solid half-hour of self-abuse.”
John stood up and took the empty plates to the sink.
As they entered the flat, Mrs. Hudson called out, “Sherlock?”
“No, of course not. I live with my tenant, Mr. Sherlock Holmes… in an enchanted house, in a pocket dimension of Faerie.” She emptied the teapot in the sink and began to measure the tea into it.
“God, John.”
Sherlock took it.
He turned to Sherlock and asked, “How much?”
On the fifth night, Sherlock had invited John to sleep the night through in his bed — “Not every night,” said Sherlock. “Just — it could be pleasant… now and again.”
Did this mean that John was somehow closer to breaking the curse altogether?
Sherlock nodded. “I realised on the second day that the magic in the pocket dimension was running out, and nothing was replacing it. I tried to get a message to you, John, but the crystals in my telephone had already been depleted. All I could do was to eke out the remaining magic until you returned and hope that you were finally ready to break the curse.”
He swore it hadn’t been there just a moment before.
He felt another tug on the lump in his chest.
“Of course, that gentleman turned out to also be part faerie. The club was made up of them, so it was a much more even playing field. My Jonathon turned out to be not very good when his advantage was gone.”
And he walked straight into the fog.
He cleared his throat. “Is this your old case? The one you mentioned yesterday?”
“Did you get a flu jab this year?” he asked before he could think better of it.
No answer.
“Her as well,” said Sherlock. John hadn’t noticed that Sherlock’s voice had become warmer and more relaxed until now, when it reverted to the disdainful sound that had first sent a chill up his spine.
John raised his eyebrows.
He took Sherlock’s paw in his hands. “Sherlock, I’m here.”
John could practically hear Sherlock’s eyes rolling.
“The truth, John!”
Sherlock drew a long ragged breath. “Fffuuuck!” His voice hitched repeatedly so that it sounded almost as if he were sobbing the word. John continued to stroke himself, listening to Sherlock’s gasping slow down to almost normal.
Sherlock jerked his head toward the fireplace. “The leather case.”
“You sound like you care about him.”
“Oh. Yeah, of course.” John took the box from Sherlock. Wedged into the bottom were two metal knickknacks made to look like the blossoms of climbing roses. It was obvious that Sherlock’s claws couldn’t get enough purchase on the flowers to pull them out.
(See the end of the chapter for
He felt Sherlock’s breath against his cock an instant before he felt his tongue. Sherlock dragged it, slow and slippery, from the base to the tip, before drawing away. John could feel Sherlock’s breath again, cooling the wetness. Then a series of feathery licks, this time with the tip of Sherlock’s tongue against the side of his cock. Then random gentle sucking kisses, some on his cock, some on his thighs, some on his stomach and balls.
“I’m not,” said Sherlock. “After all, I can’t do it myself.” He wiggled the stubby, clawed fingers of his right hand for emphasis.
,’ then draw her hand away before it got hot enough to hurt her. Then she could speak directly to Merryweather, and he to her.”
And Sherlock wasn’t really the most patient sort.
Sherlock blinked more rapidly. He took in a small breath of air and growled again.
“Nine-thirty.”
He hadn’t noticed the music had stopped.
That was… a lot to process. That Sherlock would give up the comfort of sleeping away part of his… sentence so that Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t be frightened — and it must have been frightening, since Sherlock didn’t even breathe most of the time and probably not at all when he slept — that said something.
“Not just a three-night thing then?” he called as he took his seat on the stair.
“Good,” said John. “I want you to close your eyes and touch them. I want you to imagine it’s me. Tell me what I’m doing, and I’ll do the same to myself.”
Alright — John must’ve found Sherlock at almost exactly ten. Sherlock breathed once and his heart was beating, so presumably that’s when the
“I have seen the act performed on many occasions. I believe I can do a tolerable job of it.”
John filled Sherlock’s lungs again. How long could he keep this up? He pulled his mobile out of his pocket. No bars, of course. He might have them on the stairs, but who would breathe for Sherlock?
“I think he’ll find either an empty house or a carefully staged albeit very dusty ‘crime scene.’”
Sherlock searched John’s eyes for a moment before nodding his head.
Mrs. Hudson beckoned to John. He stepped closer to her and looked into the room containing the mysterious Sherlock Holmes. It was a kitchen. John could see green tiles and white cabinets gleaming in the light from a shaded fluorescent fixture suspended from the ceiling. The tube clearly illuminated another pile of what John suspected was actually rather organized clutter, but it left the form of the person seated at the far end of the table in shadow.
“Alright?” asked Sherlock.
The image of Sherlock sitting in this spot, his silk dressing gown fanned open, sprang into John’s mind. He wondered what Sherlock was seeing. Was it as arousing to Sherlock as John’s vision was to him?
“Johnnn.”
“The daughter of Lord Backwater is a spy?”
“Your arse.”
. “Thanks?” said John.
“God, yes.” Sherlock pushed back against John’s hand.
“Not everyone is Clara, Harry.”
John smiled back at him and leaned his cheek into Sherlock’s paw. Sherlock brought John’s face closer to his own and kissed him.
Sherlock broke the kiss — giving them both a chance to breathe. “Aren’t you going to kiss my neck?” he asked.
Sherlock smiled. “Or…” he returned to the kitchen as dramatically as he’d vacated it. John had to hop aside as Sherlock practically dove for the second drawer from the bottom.
,” he replied, trying to decide where to put his arm now that Sherlock’s head was in the way. He finally settled on laying it across the back of the sofa. “It’s a comedy.”
As soon as he opened his door, he knew the music was no recording.
He knew it.
spell had been removed.
,” said Mrs. Hudson, scowling severely at John, “not let him be a bad influence on
“Sorry,” he whispered to the mobile, as he put it back into the bedside drawer.
And John was definitely getting warmer.
John woke and unwound the quilt from his legs. He hadn’t broken out in a sweat this time, so he simply straightened his twisted blankets and turned his pillow over. He’d left his door open when he’d gone to bed, hoping to hear Sherlock playing his violin, but the flat was silent.
Would he really be so obvious? No Mycroft – that’s you!
As if he was capable of movement right now. Freezing air slapped his skin as John relinquished his hold to push his t-shirt up over his ribs. Sherlock left his hands where they were anyway.
He jolted forward – Christ that was rough.... John was a natural.
(1971-2004)
“With
The bastard didn’t even look wet. He actually looked like a fucking male model, gliding along the pavement as if it was his own personal catwalk, in a long slate-grey wool coat and thick blue scarf, collar up against the wind. Skinny jeans and Converse poked out underneath, and John thought, slightly stunned as he always was by Sherlock, that it just shouldn’t bloody work, that on anyone else it would look ridiculous, but on Sherlock the effect was pure sex.
“I ask you again sir and demand that you give me an answer…What damned impudent trick is this?”
I felt the warm gush of his seed within me as he came to his completion, and I fell, cock pulsing over my stomach and chest, such was the excess of pleasure that he pulled from me that no words could do it justice, virginity cast to the four winds at last.
He pinched and rolled and pulled until Sherlock’s nipple was livid red and hard then he licked over it with the flat of his tongue in soft soothing stripes. Sherlock shuddered and moaned clinging to his waist.
He was brave, Mycroft could credit him that, even if it was by far the kindest word for stupidity.
”fuck Sherlock, touch me again…I want you to suck me…please?”He melted back against the cool textured wall as Sherlock sank down onto his knees with a contented sigh. Any thoughts of Mary, the baby, his mess of a life, just vanished, his entire being centred on the hot, wet cocoon of a perfect velvet mouth.
The rain continued and they continued to ignore it.
‘Hudson’s Millinery est 1741’.
“Just remember this John”
that ‘long streak of piss’ whoever he was”.
“He made the wrong choice then?”
Every second felt infinite, every nerve ending on fire, as the rest of the room faded away, becoming nothing more than a soft, multi-coloured blur as he drowned himself in the boy before him, fingers squeezing tighter just to ensure he was real, this couldn’t be real. He lifted his head to pull Sherlock into a kiss, quicksilver the merest glimmer behind wide black pupils. He pressed their foreheads together instead, content to just stare.
“Brilliant” John smiled broadly, squeezing Sherlock’s thigh in thank you.
“Sherlock, come now, Mama has arranged baths for you and your
So he was in charge tonight? Yeah, right.
In the intervening time the sun had burnt through the hazy clouds and he squinted in the glare.
“We have not yet the pleasure Charles, no”, said John with a quick glance towards me as we followed at a leisurely pace behind, mindful that once in company we must conceal our mutual regard once more as we mounted the summit and stepped into the rooms beyond.
Sherlock ignored her, flopping down on the sofa and pushing off a pile of old newspapers with his toes, before curling up in a foetal position, facing the wall. Classic Sherlock sulking pose. Some things never changed, no matter what version of reality you found yourself in. John smiled fondly, pushing aside the usual frustration he felt whenever Sherlock regressed into a petulant child. Mrs Hudson gave a long suffering sigh, knowing she wouldn’t get another word out of him, not when he was in a strop like this. The door clicked shut.
“You might want to reconsider that Sherlock, I have news which could be of benefit to you both in more ways than one”, he arched an eyebrow and inclined his head towards John.
By the end I was almost dizzy with the effort of standing still on one spot, swaying alarmingly to catch hold of John by the arm. I left my hand there, curled around his sleeve.
They settled, and lay facing each other, Sherlock’s left leg between John’s thighs, faces close, breathing the same air. John’s arms were curled protectively around his waist as he cupped the sides of John’s head in his hands.
It was strange to me now that we must keep our distance, walking as befitted two young gentlemen at a respectful step apart, striding with purpose towards our destination. But I bore it, and we took a turn around St James’s Square at first and from there to Pall Mall where carriages aplenty stood vying for custom. Our driver raised a brow as John, forgetting himself for a time held the door wide for me to climb inside. It was not done to act with such chivalrous attention to one of your own sex and he checked himself, giving me a playful shove instead which near sent me sprawling up the steps but made the man laugh at our horseplay and calmed his suspicions aswell. John climbed in beside me and the sleek black horse moved off into the cobbled road.
And thought about Sherlock and the curse.
“I have a well-stocked first aid kit.” John looked pointedly down at his scarred chest. “And you wouldn’t exactly be marring a pristine canvas here.”
It was an unprecedented level of luxury and cheerfulness in John’s life, but it wasn’t enough to stop the nightmares, apparently.
And with that, he continued toward the door.
“Just tell me wats going on!!! I’m ur sister. I will come get u if u need me 2!!!”
Mrs. Hudson stood as well.
“God, Sherlock. Your mouth is so fucking warm.”
“Johnd?” She sounded awful. Her voice was almost a full octave deeper than usual and her nose was obviously stuffed up. “Why are you breathind like that? Did you andswer the phoned in the middle of shanggind Bister Hebrides?”
“Yeah, okay.”
“If you remember, the copper rose was found with some clothing in a trash can near Merryweather’s location,” said Sherlock. “The clothing was identified as belonging to Merryweather by fibre analysis. But if Merryweather hadn’t summoned the Fae, the rose and the collar would have been the only clues as to his identity. The collar was immediately traceable to The Woman, and no doubt her matching rose helped seal her fate. She could have denied knowing the deceased, or given the police the obviously fake name of Virgil Merryweather, a person with no official past — it wouldn’t have mattered which. The roses would have taken longer to unravel, presumably buying enough time for Merryweather’s body to be cremated, but eventually someone would have enough knowledge of the Fae to notice the blatant faerie symbol stamped on them and trace it to one of the few faerie artisans working in London. And he would have identified the person who commissioned the roses as Avery Dain — who both Lestrade and I already knew to be Moriarty, himself — and that would have led on to the apartment he’d staged to look as though someone had frantically searched it. It was a little trail of breadcrumbs for me to follow.”
“Mrs. Hudson introduced you as a doctor. She wouldn’t do so if you weren’t a medical doctor. Your haircut and bearing say ‘military.’ Current events say you were stationed in the tropics. That you were a surgeon is more of an educated guess. There aren’t that many reasons to send a doctor into a war zone. You favor your left shoulder, but not your leg, which seems to not bother you enough for you to sit down despite the wide range of seating available.”
Sherlock turned and strode into the kitchen. A few seconds later, John heard his bedroom door close — ungently.
Sherlock shut his eyes and shook his head. “That’s it,” he whispered. “That’s it! John you amaze me.”
“Well!” she exclaimed. “They changed the box! No wonder I didn’t see it.”
Sherlock sat up.
“Hey,” said John. “Sherlock?”
something. He looked up and down the dark street, and then he saw it — the small point of light. It was dim, and he couldn’t tell how far off it was, but it was steady, and walking toward it qualified as doing something.
“It was childish,” said Sherlock, picking up the ties of his dressing gown and attempting to tie them.
Sherlock dragged his attention from his improvised crime mural to John’s incredulous face. “The flat is never too hot or cold. I’m never hungry or thirsty. I never have a full bladder. And that year did pass quickly. It seemed to me that I’d barely slept a few hours.”
“Right,” said John as Sherlock descended more gracefully than he’d just led John to believe he could. “Thanks for the tip.”
“Ah! My package!” he exclaimed. “Don’t forget to tip the lad for his trouble, John.’
“Setts,” said Sherlock.
“Good. That should be starting any minute now. Being sick and alone isn’t bad enough, I guess. I get to have my period too.”
“So you’ve grown accustomed to me.”
John looked down. “Slippers, a pair of pyjama bottoms, a grey t-shirt, and a dressing gown that I believe may be the Watson tartan.”
“You mean the part where I kneel and suck your cock?” John asked, almost innocently.
Sherlock’s face shuttered completely, but not before John caught a glimpse of horror in his expression.
Sherlock snorted. “I don’t think you need to be concerned about that point.”
Sherlock brought his paw to John’s chest and rubbed the pad of it over John’s pectoral muscle, while trying to pull the tips of his fingers back so as not to scratch John with his claws.
Music, sweet and low, came floating up the staircase. It was the tune Sherlock had written.
,” he added, shutting down the rose’s magic.
“Most of my cases involve interactions between the worlds. There are channels through which I can be contacted.”
Sherlock laid his body back down on John’s and kissed him soft and deep.
John spotted the silvery rose sitting on the mantle.
John’s own smile fled him, along with the air in his lungs.
John took the weapon and held it, testing its familiar shape and weight in his hand. He checked that it was loaded and that the safety was on before replacing it. He pulled out his mobile and thumbed the home button. Still no signal and the charge had dropped to 68 percent. He powered the device down to save the battery and put it back in the drawer.
“I was just guessing from a couple of photos,” John pointed out.
“Ssh!” Sherlock picked up the rose and took it to the kitchen. He put it in the refrigerator.
John laughed softly. “No. I’d like to now though.”
Whatever Sherlock was playing, it was melancholy and full of so much longing, John could feel it catching on something in the general area of his solar plexus. For the first time since they had begun these midnight rendezvous, he wished that he could continue down the stairs, into the warm lamp-light of the sitting room.
“Okay, so this associate or associates or completely unrelated person was presumably not Fae. How did they use a spell?”
“For the same reason
Sherlock’s act of “ingratitude” must have something to do with him not using that life as Moriarty saw fit.
Sherlock shook his head and smiled sadly at John.
been weeks, John mused as he ducked under the spray in the shower. He wondered how long it had been since he’d last attempted to contact Harry. He’d stopped checking his mobile every day in an attempt to nurse the battery along.
“I don’t know, John. Is it?” Sherlock’s voice had gone positively arctic.
But they only had one hour.
He would even bow his head and let Sherlock place a chain around his neck.
John could hear the muffled sound of someone answering the call.
John thrust slow and firm along Sherlock’s plush, yielding cock, pressing and stretching the impossible length of the shaft until he was rubbing him cockhead to cockhead.
“Mor—” But Sherlock stopped him with a kiss.
John ground his teeth, noticed he was grinding his teeth, and consciously unclenched his jaw.
John had wondered in passing about the parts of Sherlock’s unusual anatomy that were not usually on display. He had surmised, by the roundness of Sherlock’s hips and buttocks that his legs were equine all the way up, and Sherlock himself had confirmed the presence of a tail.
“Not at all, Doctor. I admit your position on the rugby team and your lacklustre marks in organic chemistry didn’t make for a terribly gripping read, but your military records were most entertaining.”
“Over the years, the woman considered using her wish on a few occasions. She thought about using it to get into the university.”
“I mean it,” said John. “Not to me, not anymore.”
He breathed air into Sherlock again.
“Heaven forfend!” Sherlock took a swallow from his drink and set the glass back on the table. “And you? What’s next for you?”
The scrutinising expression on Sherlock’s face was so perfectly what John had pictured that he grinned and shook his head.
Possibly living in the real 221B.
“Still, I’d think there are easier ways to see someone naked.”
“Oh,” said Sherlock. “I solved it a few hours ago.”
“I see,” he said, and turned to leave.
“There are ways out,” said Sherlock. “There’s even one for Mrs. Hudson and myself. If you’re eager to go, there’s a fast and sure exit on the mantle there.”
John grinned. “It was an extraordinary experience, but I didn’t fall in love with horns or a tail or even a gigantic cock. I fell in love with you. And you’re anything but ordinary.”
“Ah, that would be telling. That’s against the rules.”
“If you say so,” said the voice.
He left the mobile on while he dressed, but Harry didn’t answer. John powered the mobile down and slipped it back into the drawer.
“I would. I don’t think I could help it.”
“I can’t ingest anything when I’m like this,” he explained sheepishly.
“Oh my God, John! Oh my fucking God! You
What had Sherlock said? “There are ways out.” Then he’d shown John the little case on the mantel. He’d told John there was also a curse that could be lifted.
“No,” he said, trying to absorb this new piece of information. “No, that’s fine. Thanks.”
“Alright. But if you didn’t want me to know, why were you playing the violin?”
So John started writing — mostly about Sherlock or the Case of the Brass Rose since there was little else of interest happening at 221B. Sherlock learned to use the computer quickly enough, and, despite his lack of dexterity, he was a better typist than John even if he did scratch up the “E” key so badly that it became illegible.
spell.
Sherlock smiled. “Tonight.”
“Well, anyway — eventually every card party and gaming hell in London had blacklisted him. They suspected him of cheating, which he was only doing in the loosest sense of the word, but there you are. He was getting quite desperate, afraid we’d have to move to some locale where he was unknown. An acquaintance mentioned that there was a club that would admit him — unnaturally lucky or no.
“No?” Sherlock pulled his paws out of his pockets and looked at them. “They used to be one of my best traits.”
The second thing was Harry’s voice.
“Please, sir.  Begging your pardon for interrupting, but I have long been aware of the goings-on, as you put it, sir.  They don’t bother me in the slightest.  I am only sorry that I have alarmed you and Dr. Watson.  I have no intention of ever breathing a word of this, sirs.  You have my word on it.”
“Could you…?” He held up the box. “I seem to be… erm…”
“That was fast. You shouldn’t bolt your food, you know.”
sleepy, he realised — had gone straight up to bed.
Pissing entirely forgotten, John started down the stairs, determined to solve at least one mystery around here.
“Are you hard, Sherlock? You can do that in this body, right?”
There would be other hours for that.
“Come again?”
At night, he’d had sex with John.
Slippers, robe, and down the stairs. He sat, toes on the line and ass on the step, listening. It seemed to him that the music was less full of want and more full of promise.
“I don’t even have hands to touch you, John.”
Sherlock swallowed. “You did.”
John grabbed a plate from the cupboard. “I told you it doesn’t. I meant it.”
Had he been dreaming? He swallowed thickly and shook his head.
John groaned in annoyance. "I've moved out just three hours ago, pick up your bloody milk yourself, you insufferable git," he gritted out. For a moment, he was tempted to text back with exactly those words, but decided against it and poked the screen hard to delete the message instead.
There was a force, a power, the one thing in this world that could shut down Sherlock Holmes' brilliant mind and reduce this glorious, beautiful creature to a sobbing, begging, shivering mess. And it was found
And with that, he closed his eyes, inhaling the scent of rain water and smoke and wood and spring that was Sherlock, bathing in the delight of having his one true love back in his life. Nothing else mattered and nothing ever would.
For some reason, John’s posture had a wave of respect, with just the smallest amount of fear added to it, rushing through Sherlock’s body, tingling at his fingertips and toes, creeping up and back down his spine, and finally pooling in the pit of his stomach. Despite of being intrigued by the sensation, he swallowed thickly and bowed his head down in an obedient fashion.
Sherlock shot him an odd look. "You're hiding something from me. Something important, too. You suspect I already know what it is, and it frightens you, yet you want to hear me spell it out for you?"
The imaginary Sherlock looked back at him with what appeared to be genuine worry. "John," he said, "John, you need to go home."
Meanwhile, John's free left hand stroked up and down Sherlock's torso, fingers ghosting over hotly flushed skin, his pointer circling one of those delicate rosy buds, only to lightly pinch it and elicit the most obscene moan from Sherlock. The sound of it alone made John's member become impossibly harder.
She sat down next to him and began to tell him about Joan, a friend of hers from back at Uni, who worked as a doctor and would gladly provide him with housing and food for as long as necessary. “All you’d have to do is help her in her practise. They’re short on doctors all times of the year. You’d probably get paid less than you would be paid anywhere else, but then again, you won’t have to pay for groceries and the rent for a room or flat.”
A sigh fell from dry lips and lingered, leaving the air thick and heavy. All the memories he'd been trying to keep at bay rose up, flooding the spartan room.
Sherlock bit his swollen bottom lip, unintentionally muffling the moan that was freeing itself from his throat, and clenched his eyes shut, lifting his hips again, pressing up against John's warm hand. His whole body ached for friction, burned with desire. All his actions pleaded for more contact, more heat, more everything.
John thought and balled his hands into tight fists. A growl rumbled in the back of his throat. “I am not your bloody experiment, Sherlock. You don’t get to invade my personal space like that. Forget it.”
who promised to be with him until the end of time. Sherlock's.)
-- sounds really interesting, doesn’t it?”
“Sherlock,” the doctor regarded the taller man, successfully trying to keep his tone neutral.
John stretched and yawned before he blinked up at her. “As good as your battered old sofa would allow,” he answered, grinning.
“You ate half of the food I made you. That’s a huge improvement to the last couple of times. I’m proud of you, Sherlock, really, I am,” he eventually answered and turned around to take the remainders of Sherlock’s breakfast back into the kitchen. The detective just blinked stupidly at his friend’s retreating form, not understanding what John liked so much about seeing him indulge in something as mundane and dull as
Sherlock snorted. “I’d like to see you try,” he challenged and narrowed his eyes at John. Oh, he better had not. Something flickered in the good doctor’s eyes, but in the blink of an eye it was gone again, before Sherlock had a chance to deduce what it was, and -- more importantly yet -- what it
"That's utter bollocks. I know Sherlock. He doesn't...
Sherlock blinked at his thoughts.
He tried to shift away from his friend, but the insistent fingers followed the movement with a kind of fierce determination, never losing contact. And John was at a loss, didn’t understand just what this was about.
So sorry for the delay, but my wonderful beta TSylvestris was super busy and I just refuse to publish anything without it being properly beta-read.
John took a step towards Sherlock then, closing the gap, purposefully invading his personal space. He came so close that he could smell him, feel his body heat, sense his nervousness. A nervousness that emboldened John, for once giving him the feeling to be one up on Sherlock. John shook his head almost imperceptibly, he didn’t want to think along those lines, didn’t want to let competitiveness or whatever it was creep between them before other, more important things had been settled.
"Are you going to sniff it or drink it?" he enquired, never having seen John admire a cup of tea this way.
Sherlock didn't answer, apparently absorbed in his experiment. John didn't even
Clara cleared her throat and pushed herself back with her chair, then slowly got up. She nodded at John and regarded Sherlock with a look the doctor couldn’t quite read before saying, “I’ll leave you to it, then.”
"I learned to never trust anyone," Sherlock mumbled into his knees, a part of him still talking to John, explaining everything to him, desperately hoping his words would reach him, "especially if they put on a show of affection and acceptance. I won't be used again. But I trust you, John. I know you're different. But still it... all this... scares me." He swallowed around the lump in his throat and lifted his head to gaze at John's empty armchair. It seemed to taunt him.
Loving someone and being
“But?” Clara pressed. “Did you expect Sherlock to show up like a knight in shining armour to rescue the princess? To come and snatch you away before you could leave?”
Then, carefully, she said, “I thought you looked forward to leaving for Australia?”
Somehow, they had made it into Sherlock's bedroom, bumping into furniture, walls and door frames, stripping off shirts and socks and trousers along their way.
John fell onto the neatly made bed of his hotel room and stared at the ceiling. He'd considered asking Mike or Greg for a place to kip until he found himself a flat, but he needed time alone, time to think, and he certainly didn't want the D.I. poking his nose into his private life. Not that Lestrade would pry, exactly, but staying at his place would raise questions. Questions of the sort John didn't want to answer, and frankly couldn't.
"So beautiful," he whispered in Sherlock's ear as he leaned down. He felt his lover shiver as his breath ghosted over a delicate earlobe that promptly got sucked into John's mouth. The action elicited another dark growl from deep down Sherlock's chest, a rumbling so feral, John was sure it had to be the most wonderful sound in the world.
Taking a deep breath and feeling invigorated with resolve starting to surge through his veins, he put up the collar of his coat, turned around without another word and walked towards the main entrance, slipping past travelers on their way outside, all the while looking around for a familiar dark blonde head.
A reassuring gesture that spoke of love and acceptance, yet it was so devastatingly painful.
“Okay, stay calm, even if he’s here he’s not going to kill you. You’re just here to pick up John’s stuff and you’ll be out of here in a matter of minutes,” she murmured reassuringly to herself, pinching the bridge of her nose and squeezing her eyes closed for a moment. Still, the uneasiness wouldn’t leave her alone and she stared up the stairs to John’s flat. She counted seventeen steps, but counting them didn’t help calming her nerves either. She counted them again. Giving up on it she sighed, and grabbing the balustrade tightly with her right hand she set foot on the stairwell.
"You're staying," Sherlock suddenly declared.
She pulled a chair from the dinner table in the corner and sat down on it next to the coffee table, gracefully crossing her legs and tossing her hair back. Just as she reached for her coffee, John’s phone chimed with a text and she snatched it from the table where it lay next to the mugs before he could reach for it.
The doctor was still skeptical. "With any
was blocking his way. Sherlock didn't move.
lusts after him. And it's going to annoy him."
Sherlock squinted. Another, much smaller mole was right next to it, the two of them making an almost perfect pair. He leaned down to kiss the marks on John's skin, a feather light touch, far too weak to wake his sleeping lover. He hovered over the soft skin, widening his nostrils to inhale the scent clinging to John's skin. A mixture of sleep, sex and John's own scent - spicy and sweet.
. . .
Taken aback, John inhaled a calming breath and blew it out again, then rolled his eyes. "Working on it," he said simply.
Again, the older emphasized the word with what could only be described as disdain. “If you want him back, I suggest you get up and out now. Or stay here and remain unhappy and isolated for the rest of your life. It’s your choice, Sherlock, but one you have to make eventually.”
idea?” he choked out, taken aback.
“You alright?” he heard himself ask, half spaced out while thinking on the journey that lay ahead of him and what it entailed. Leaving London, Sherlock, his family and friends behind, without nary a word to anyone -- he still felt cowardly for running away like this. But on the other hand, he was sure to get better sooner the farther he was away from Sherlock, right? Right?
agree you stay away from him, at least until you’re not quite so heartbroken anymore? Besides, it’s always a good idea to make yourself scarce. Make the object of your desire wait for you. Chances are they’ll miss you so much they’ll do something incredible to win you back.”
Sherlock snorted. “Naturally. He’d just
Sherlock huffed out an annoyed breath and rolled his eyes. “Sentiment,” he replied shortly and shook his head in exasperation.
unspokenly travelling along with his words -- before he opened the door of the car again and got back in. Heaving a sigh, he tapped the handle of his umbrella against the partition to signal his driver to go.
All right. Time for some soul-searching. What if his heart told him that,
"Where you even
The other man seemed to shake himself out of a momentarily stupor and fixed his eyes on his friend. "John. I will ask you a question and I insist you answer it honestly."
Sherlock looked up at John and blinked confusedly, wondering how the other man had managed to sneak up to him without being noticed. Then, he turned his gaze down and clenched his jaw. “It’s you,” he answered, his voice raw.
John rolled his eyes. "Just because he's unable to bring himself to feel for others it doesn't make him oblivious to other people's feelings. He simply... he doesn't care...
. . .
Now, there are three things I'd like to say to close this:
a bloke," he whispered to himself, "right?"
Sherlock inhaled deeply and pushed the mug back into his friend's hands. "Take a day off and go back to sleep. You look awful," he advised, genuine concern in his voice.
John flexed his shoulders and craned his chin upwards, suddenly seeming a lot taller than he really was, and glared down at Sherlock with demanding eyes. “Eat,” he growled at him, pointing at the food, and clenched his jaw tightly.
John felt like a zombie as he shuffled, yawning, into the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee. Last night had been dreadful.
"Unhappy marriage," he said and looked at Lestrade. "I recall you saying her husband found her?"
"Stop shouting, please." It wasn't even a request, John thought, not really. It was an order with "please" tacked on. He hadn't even looked up.
Mycroft turned wordlessly for the door, but paused when he heard the tune his younger brother started to play. It spoke of longing and a very deep wound. He turned again to look at Sherlock’s back. “This isn’t about John, is it?” he asked, and watched Sherlock’s body stiffen, his hands loosening. The violin dropped to the windowsill with a loud clatter. Mycroft blinked in surprise and stared at the instrument, then at his brother’s shaking hands. Did he drop it intentionally? Would he risk harming his beloved Stradivarius -- a rare and treasured value, and a gift from their mother for Sherlock’s 16th birthday no less -- over a fit of anger at his older brother? No, this was someone else’s doing. This was Victor through and through.
Mycroft made a noise of disapproval. “My, my. Sarcasm? You’re even more insufferable than usual with all your
"Would you rather be?" the soft baritone responded, chuckling, and John shook his head.
John inhaled a deep breath. Exhaled slowly. Inhaled. "How could I ever be sure of that?"
When he opened them again, however, he stared blankly at the cup of coffee sitting in front of him. He blinked several times and his throat made an odd sound when he opened his mouth to speak. He swallowed and tried again.
A finger on his lips cut him off. "Talk to much? Yes, indeed," Sherlock said with a smirk. Then, his face serious again, he added, "I never did this, or anything remotely like it with anyone before, John. I haven't the faintest idea how it's going to work." He took a shaky breath before he continued, "But I do know that I want you, every last bit of you, and I want to offer you everything I have to give. I want you to have me. Mark me, make me yours. I need you to."
can help
“The same way you like seeing me sleep?” Sherlock shot back, annoyed and angry by the fact John thought he had an eating-disorder. He just didn’t need food. That was all it was.
John sighed. "All right, fine, here you go." He handed the cancer stick to his friend and sat back down in his armchair. Sherlock followed his every move and then stared at him demandingly. John blinked back at him in confusion before he realised his mistake. He sighed again and rolled his eyes. "Right, where's your lighter?"
"Mistake," Sherlock muttered.
John looked back at him and shrugged. "It will be, eventually." He tried an optimistic smile, but failed miserably. Lestrade acknowledged it with a raised eyebrow but said nothing more.
"Excuse me?" John asked then, confused.
“I miss him,” he whispered anyway, couldn’t stop himself from admitting it.
John's breathing stopped once again and he dropped the newspaper, suddenly feeling weak. He felt his heart rate increase and a smile form on his lips. Then, "I love you, too, Sherlock."
His mobile buzzed. Thankful for the distraction, he dug it free from his trouser pocket, realising too late that it was Sherlock who was most likely to send him a text.
Sherlock, would you mind not sneaking around like a bloody ninja at half six in the morning?"
from John's gaze and sudden embarrassment, for once said nothing.
Sherlock closed his eyes, drew in as deep a breath as possible and exhaled slowly, trying to calm his painfully constricting heart. He felt drained of energy and devoid of all emotion except for the despair and loneliness his best friend had left him with.
Without him."
Now Sherlock shot him a look of utter confusion. “You like it?” he asked, delicate brows raising toward the ceiling. John just shrugged.
The silence stretched into what felt like hours and John felt his heart sink. Then, Sherlock finally opened his mouth. “You taught me something,” he whispered, staring at his fingers which were curled around the hem of his shirt.
“Sherlock, why are you touching me?” he asked, his voice low, not loud enough for Lestrade to overhear.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and stared intently into John's crystal-blue eyes. "I said, go ahead and kiss me. See if it's as you thought it would be."
John knit his brows together. He felt a feather-light touch at the small of his back, soon subtly morphing into an insistent one, applying more pressure, still slight, but unwavering. He glanced sideways at Sherlock, who was standing very close to him, so close, in fact, that their body heat mingled to a haze of all-enveloping warmth.
. . .
He couldn't do this to himself. He couldn't do this to Mummy, who had always wanted him to live a long and happy life. He couldn't do this to John, who protected him to ensure just that.
“So,” he repeated and took a sip of his too-hot tea, swallowing it with visible effort.
Sherlock thought with a satisfied smile. Apparently, John did not want to be touched by him, yet he claimed to feel affection toward Sherlock and showed obvious signs of pleasure when treated in such a fashion. Then why did John not want to be touched by him?
John’s eyes went wide in shock. “What gives you
John stared after her and gulped. Back to Baker Street to pick up his belongings? He wasn’t sure he could do that.
"Why are you refusing to accept the evidence, John?" a deep baritone sounded and the good doctor jumped. He sat up and looked around frantically, but Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. What the...? Where was that bastard hiding?
They both moaned when the tips of their tongues gently brushed against each other, and suddenly, Sherlock put both hands on John's neck, clawing at the skin, pulling him impossibly closer and closer still as their tongues started to dance around each other, stroking, teasing.
. . .
Sherlock gave him an incredulous look over the hood of the vehicle after he had climbed out of it himself. “I don’t need you for this, Mycroft. Leave.”
John considered her words for a moment, lowering his gaze to his cup and staring at it in deep thought. His heart still ached at the thought of Sherlock, not caring for him enough to even try and stop him, or just once asking how he was or if he would come back home. Then, he looked back up at his sister-in-law and shook his head.
Sherlock shook his head, staring down at his hands. "No use, I would know it again the moment I looked at you. Besides, I just can't delete you, or anything concerning you. Trust me, I've
A soft chuckle filled the room. "You're giving up hope too easily. But regardless of whether you can have him the way you want or not - use your imagination," not-really-Sherlock said, the wink audible in his voice. "I'm given to understand it's rather vivid."
flat - staring at the black wood for a full twelve minutes with his hand resting on the door handle. The longer he waited, the more uneasiness spread through his body.
he emphasized the name of the good doctor with an air of annoyance, “is preparing to leave the country. Shall I fetch him for you?”
Sherlock took a deep breath, but paused. John waited, his hand still resting on his friend’s shoulder, thumb drawing absentminded circles on the purple cotton.
“I’m thinking, John,” he growled, “and therefore far from delighted about your crude interruption. I’d very much appreciate it if you
“Thanks for the input,” John said and winced, but then grinned up at her. They both chuckled. “But seriously, thank you for letting me kip here,” he added.
Sherlock lifted his chin and stared at the ceiling as if in deep thought. He then took up his favourite thinking pose again and didn’t say a single thing for the next fifteen minutes. John continued eating.
They'd been sitting across from each other in their armchairs, each of them engrossed in their own little tasks; Sherlock doing some kind of research on the Internet and John reading the paper.
to feel.”
"Fuck you!"
Sherlock lay on the couch, his face turned towards the back rest, knees drawn up to his chest, and pondered. He thought about John, his smile, his devotion, his friendship. Feelings of frustration and loneliness held his heart like a vice, making it hard to breathe, to think.
John's hands clenched into fists at his sides and he shook his head again. "I don't...
“You’re not my experiment, John. Not now, not anymore. I want you to be part of me in every sense of the word,” he whispered into the empty darkness, loosening his grip around his knees and turning to lay on his back. He stared at the ceiling, his hands folded over his torso, sighing.
John thought.
“Mornin’, hun, sleep well?” Clara chimed as she entered the living room, two pots of steaming coffee in hand.
“Right,” she laughed, “Are you looking forward to your journey a bit more now, then?”
John made to protest again, but she shook her head. “No, sir, I’m not done. Did we
He just stared for one long moment, then shook himself out of it and frowned.
“What are you going to tell him?” he asked, knowing that winning John back this time would probably not be an easy task for his younger brother.
With that, she stood, grabbed the bag with John’s belongings and left the flat without so much as looking at the tall, somewhat broken man standing in his living room.
he told them.
his Subconscious-Sherlock asked in the back of his head, amusement underlying the beautiful baritone.
John didn’t dignify that with a response, cursing his body for being so obvious, and broke the eye contact again. He needed to lay his eyes on something less disconcerting, less disturbing -- less arousing -- and settled on the bookshelf left to Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock blinked, puzzled, but then shrugged. "Fine," he said, and John couldn't determine if he sounded upset or if that was wishful thinking on his part.
Pants were ripped off and tossed aside in a matter of seconds and Sherlock's thin, long fingers wrapped around John's prick, stroking him languidly at first, but increasing pressure with every up and down movement. John moaned throatily, already desperate. "Oh, fuck, Sherlock, oh God," he panted, watching his friend take off his trousers swiftly despite shaking hands.
“So,” Clara said as she sat down in John’s chair, opposite Sherlock.
all over my feelings, it's all right, it's fine," John ground out. "So I'm not even worthy of your friendship anymore, now, am I? Makes me wonder, Sherlock: have you ever valued me in any way? I don't imagine you did."
Returning to the living room and all but falling back onto the couch, he turned to face the backrest, drew his knees up to his chest and encircled them with his arms.
“I was,” the doctor responded in a low voice, “I really was. But…” He trailed off.
"John," the soothingly calm baritone lulled him again, "you said it yourself, John. You're lost without him. Perhaps that will be enough to go back home to him. Perhaps he even feels for you. Perhaps he is just waiting for you to make the first move."
He felt like sighing, but swallowed instead. Setting one insecure foot in front of the other, he began walking towards the shops, turning his head every which way to see if he couldn’t find his blond friend.
Taking a deep breath, John looked the other deep in his grey-green eyes. “Then what is it?” He had to know, had to hear the words before he could allow himself to hold on to that faint glimmer of hope that was trying its hardest to bubble up inside of him.
John sighed, suddenly feeling very exhausted. "Yes, Sherlock, it's not ideal, not at all. But I told you, I'm going to keep it down. It's not going to change anything between us, all right? I'm still your friend. Let's drop it now, okay?"
to come back. Wasn't he?
Sherlock felt warmth consuming him, warmth around his throbbing penis, warmth in his chest, warmth in his cheeks and his limbs, spreading into the farthest corner of his system, prickling at the tips of his fingers, making him curl his toes. He watched through half-lidded eyes as his erection disappeared into a hot, willing mouth, the sight making him groan. He weaved his fingers into John's short, sand-coloured hair, not strong enough to push him farther down, but indication he wanted to keep him there, doing just that, possibly forever. This felt… good. And so right.
Anxiety churning his stomach, John stood in front of the door to his flat -
“I want to touch you, John. I want you to touch me.” Calm. Even. Dark. Somehow promising. Oh so tempting. John trembled in anticipation of what was to follow. What did follow, however, was nothing he would have expected. “Based on the evidence I found you interested in a physical relationship with me, John, and I suggest you start acting on it. Take me to bed.” Demanding, rough, detached.
“Moping isn’t going to solve anything, you know,” Clara continued admonishingly, “if you don’t want to go through with this you can just say so and we find a different solution.”
John’s voice rang in his head, reverberated from the inner walls of his skull. Sherlock found himself caught between a pout and a smile.
John groaned and turned off the telly. Five seconds later he switched it on again, zapping through channels restlessly until he found some documentary about wild cats. There. That should keep his mind occupied.
John's gaze narrowed, brows knit together. Sherlock sighed in response, but remained silent. He dropped his gaze, apparently unable to look the doctor in the eyes.
“Secondly, I’m not aware of ever having kissed you, which is another thing couples regularly do, and we, for a fact, do
Yes, he did indeed.
Sherlock nodded curtly and suddenly John’s bright laughter reverberated from the walls. “Maybe it’s some sort of kink I’ve developed.
flatmate that would be fine, but not when the person you share a flat with is an easily bored genius named Sherlock Holmes, no."
John shut his eyes and inhaled a deep, calming breath. "I can't help it, Sherlock. Not yet, anyway, but I promise I'll try to contain myself. I certainly won't jump you in your sleep."
"Sherlock? Were you even listening to me?" John enquired, frowning.
“Your Sherlock bloke is hard to handle. How do you even put up with that? If I said you’d need a medal pinned on you before, now I’m sure you should be knighted.”
am," she answered in her cutting voice.
doing that."
“I know, darling,” Clara answered in a soothing voice, “And I’m sure he misses you, too.”
Please be aware that only half of this chapter has been beta-read because I stopped writing on it midway and simply haven't worked up the courage to contact the friend that proof-read this story for me before, seeing as we haven't been in contact much after I've stopped writing. So I apologise in advance for any typos you may find.
John stared.
"So?" John asked after a few minutes of awkward silence, swallowing thickly around the lump that had formed in his throat.
Two - I know, I know, they didn't actually end up together with kisses and wild sex (even though that's what I had originally planned for this story), but I found it to be much more believeable if they reunited like this. After all, John took that trip to Australia because he wanted to
He was used to tears of fondness, they'd come every now and again when he looked at Sherlock's sleeping form. It had been four months now, and he wouldn't stop being amazed by the sensation that was his flatmate-gone-lover. He'd never seen anything so pure and beautiful in his life.
“I’ve missed you, too.”
Once upstairs and inside the living room, his gaze instantly fixed itself on Sherlock's tall figure in his armchair by the window. He sat with his feet on the seat, drawn so close to his body, his heels were almost touching his (plush, touchable, indecently sexy, especially in
And that was when he heard it. The faint sound of a violin coming from the living room, caressing his ears, his heart, putting his body, mind and soul back in line. Like puzzle pieces being put together, the shattered remainders of his lonely, bleeding heart fit back together as if they'd never been apart.
. . .
“Leave him alone,” he said through gritted teeth. “And while you’re at it,” he added and turned around to face the window again, “leave me alone as well.”
Here, finally, it is: chapter six. I apologise for the delay, our lives kept my beta and me both really busy. As usual, here comes my thank you for reading & I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions. Now, off you go; enjoy!
The tiny noises escaping the back of that lean, white throat were taunting John, baiting him. He moaned as Sherlock's lips closed around his tongue, sucking on it, teeth timidly grazing across the willing flesh.
She made her way to the door when she suddenly remembered something. “Right,” she murmured, “he’ll need his toothbrush.”
For a long moment, no reply was forthcoming, Sherlock only staring blankly at John, and the good doctor trying hard to suppress the fidgeting his fingers so desperately wanted to do. The tips of his fingers twitched and he pulled his hands off the table to grab at his knees, hard, anything to try and ground himself and, perhaps even more importantly, hide the physical display of his uneasiness from Sherlock -- give him one less thing to deduce, to draw conclusions, to… oh, who was he kidding, the genius probably had seen it already, anyway. He sighed soundlessly.
"No," he heard himself croak. Whatever kind of twisted dream this was, he had to wake up, and soon.
Correction: John would later very much hate himself, Sherlock, and the whole world for pressing the issue. "Get on with it."
“Hey, Watson!” she suddenly exclaimed, smacking her hand flat on the table. He twitched, surprised at the sudden noise and the forcefulness in her voice and blinked at her, for the first time actually registering her words.
John stared at him, mouth agape. Hearing it hurt more than he'd thought. What if Sherlock had succeeded? He shook himself out of his stupor after a full ten seconds, when suddenly a thought struck him. With surprise evident in his voice he said, "You... actually
. . .
The way Sherlock said his name sent shivers down John's spine and goose flesh all over his arms and neck. He turned his head in the direction he heard his friend's voice come from. And there, on the edge of his bed, sat Sherlock.
. . .
Somehow the first time their bodies collided and their breaths mingled had proved to have a greater impact on their lives than they'd first expected.
very much appreciate seeing you
"Uhh?" John answered unintelligibly, shaking his head. "N-nothing," he managed eventually.
He extracted himself from the duvet, hopped off the bed, and opened the mini-bar at the other end of the bedroom. For such a cheap hotel, there was quite a variety of alcohol. Whisky and cola to start, he decided, grabbed the bottles, and slammed the door shut with just a tad too much force. The bottles still inside clinked angrily.
"I'm afraid it would end our friendship," he said after another long moment. "I don't want him to dislike me. I don't even particularly need him to love me back, but... I can't lose him. He means... everything to me, he's the reason I'm still alive."
One - How did you like the tense switch for the last bit? I worried about that part a lot, but I somehow wanted it to stand out, to show that John indeed came back and that something had changed.
He was bloody awful!” Clara paused, “Then again… he’s just a child, really, isn’t he?” she said, sitting up and looking at her brother-in-law with something akin to sadness in her eyes.
John exhaled to calm down, to steady his nerves once again, to find his balance. He wiped his hands over his face. He was tired, he was flustered and more than a little bit unsettled. He heard the faint noises of Sherlock padding around in their living room, heard him walk from the sofa to their kitchen and back. Then there was silence.
he thought.
When Sherlock was half-way through the plate and had just swallowed the last bite of toast and beans, he held out his hand in anticipation. Sure enough, Sherlock handed the plate over and folded his hands over his middle.
John stiffened, startled. However, he didn't take long to give in to the temptation and respond to the slow movement of the mouth on his, licking, sucking and biting the tender skin of those incredibly soft lips.
Two days later, Sherlock and John were bounding down the stairs of their flat on the way to a crime scene Lestrade had summoned them to.
Sherlock gulped. "But?" he asked, his teeth lightly digging into his bottom lip.
are wounded, John?"
Sherlock snapped out of his thoughts when Detective Inspector Lestrade cleared his throat.
. . .
“Because I want to, John,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly, turning to look at him, but he didn’t take his hand away as if breaking the connection would mean much more than just that.
to know what he was doing there - honestly, he was fine with whatever mischief Sherlock was up to, as long as it didn't involve hydrochloric acid and John's favourite jumper.
that took John's breath away.
“No, don’t answer that, I know you do, John. I also know you tend to touch me when I sleep,” the unusually soft baritone said, and John felt as if it was piercing his lungs, all air fading from them.
Sherlock didn't look up from his microscope, but John could hear the eye-roll in his voice. "One would assume you would know your own date of birth. Furthermore you know that I do not particularly care for such trivia."
"If you like," John chuckled. "I call it
Whatever doubts had filled John's mind during the day, they certainly had vanished now, vaporised by hot fingers on clammy skin.
Three - thank you so much for reading. And thank you for giving this story another chance if you're a returning reader. I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions.
John's eyes shot open and he momentarily stared at the ceiling, trying to focus, suddenly very self-conscious. His heart beat frantically, heat rose to his cheeks, and his breathing sped up. He turned his head to the left to stare into empty pitch-blackness. Where the hell did Sherlock go? Was he even really here?
Sherlock tore his gaze away and fixed it on his plate. “Unimportant,” he said, “I know you do and the reddening of your cheeks is evidence enough to tell me I’m right. Now, explain to me, John, why would you touch me when no one, not even I myself, can see, but wouldn’t let me touch you?”
He couldn’t find sleep, though, as the scene in their living room replayed in an endless loop in his head.
Sherlock looked at him, irritated. "I can't delete
Another deep breath and Sherlock’s gaze fell to his hands which cradled the teacup. “I can’t give him what he seeks for. And if I try, I may end up hurt. I know John would never purposefully harm me, but...”
. . .
Soft blond hair, like down, covering the small of the back. A smattering of freckles on the shoulder blades, a remnant of prolonged exposure to the sun. A mole on the base of the nape, almost in the centre, maybe half an inch to the right.
“What makes you say that?” John enquired, brows furrowed.
Clara nodded. “As long as you’re okay with leaving the country,” she said and to John’s wide-eyed look she added, “Trust me, it’s just like England down there. Not much of a difference, really.”
Lastly, and most importantly yet, Sherlock -- we’re not sleeping together. Couples sleep together. We don’t. Okay. That makes us not-a-couple. We’re friends, colleagues, flatmates, but that’s it.”
She let her lips slide off his to trace them over the shell of his ear. Her husky voice thrummed against his skin, and then a rich baritone thick with desire and need murmured in his ear.
John slammed his hands flat on the table and stood up. "Okay. That's about as much as I can take. You're self-centered and insufferable, and what's worse is that you wouldn't give two shits about me. Not even me, of all people, your best friend! I've had enough. I'm going."
Yet, Sherlock wasn’t done analysing reactions, but for once, he took to investigate his own. He couldn’t deny he had liked touching John. It had felt warm and familiar, yet novel and agitating. John’s body was undiscovered territory, and Sherlock felt the strong need to explore it, map all of it, very thoroughly. What did that tell him about himself?
“John,” Sherlock said then, fixing his eyes on the other man’s, no longer staring through him, but rather, right into his soul. The blond swallowed thickly, his throat suddenly feeling tight and parched. Was he only imagining it or had Sherlock’s usually deep, clear baritone cracked?
The pain was good, much better than the other kind. It was calming. He revelled in it, closed his eyes and
good. Unconsciously, he made a humming sound of appreciation in the back of his throat and John smiled, unseen by the detective.
John."
Upon seeing Sherlock’s appalled look he added, “Oh don’t worry, it’s not very loud. It’s just... I noticed, is all. Don’t stop on my behalf. Well, I like it, actually.”
does, too."
“Sherlock’s here, too, and you want to get away from him. As far as possible, in your own words.”
like a cat in so many ways," John whispered and pressed his lips to Sherlock's for another brief kiss.
“Go away,” Sherlock answered weakly, but the door opened anyway and his brother entered.
By the time Clara arrived and took a seat opposite from him at the table, John’s coffee was half empty and the one he ordered for her probably cold. She looked stressed out.
Looking around the crowded airport lobby for anyone looking even remotely like John, Sherlock felt increasingly lost and overwhelmed. As soon as he’d stepped foot into the building, his resolve had crumbled and his first instinct had been to turn around and flee. But he couldn’t do that to himself and, more importantly, to John. But would John even want him to -- what actually was it that he was going to do here?
Taking another deep breath she crossed the room, and headed for the stairs that led up to John’s bedroom.
. . .
“Why are you doing this, John?” he enquired when his friend returned into the living room.
His gaze lingered on Sherlock. On his long, pale fingers adjusting the microscope, to be exact. A violinist's fingers, graceful and thin, skin soft except for the calloused fingertips.
"John, John, John, come home, don't leave me, please," he murmured into the emptiness. "Oh please, I'm so sorry, come back, I need you, I-"
he told himself,
John stared for another long moment. Eventually, he shook himself out of his stupor and looked at Sherlock as if he had finally lost his mind - the fine line between genius and insanity and all that. "No. I'm absolutely
he thought with no small amount of embarrassment.
he thought, but left it unspoken.
He enjoyed the silence, this different kind of pain stopping the memories and the feeling of being lost and lonely and broken, stopping the voices deafening him.
"Well," he started, his voice faint. He cleared his throat before he continued, "I guess I fell in love."
And once again, lying there in his hotel room, staring at the ceiling, his jeans unzipped and unbuttoned, cock still half-hard, Dr. John Watson wished for nothing more than to never have met Sherlock Holmes.
"Because of
It was John's turn to shake his head violently. "No, I can't, it will ruin our friendship if he finds out. And he will find out eventually. He's Sherlock Holmes, for God's sake! There's absolutely nothing anyone could hide from him."
She smiled at him reassuringly as he took a deep breath and unfastened his seat belt.
“It really couldn’t. It’s Sherlock and he said he bought milk. Whatever
When Sherlock ended and lowered his violin, John sighed contently, opening his eyes to look at his friend, smiling. “That was beautiful,” he whispered, trying not to disturb the peaceful cloak of stillness that surrounded them.
. . .
"Stop feeling that way towards me, now. Just...stop it." Sherlock's voice, barely above a whisper, cracked.
“What?” he asked eventually, equal parts annoyed and intrigued.
Sometimes, Sherlock wouldn't let John near him. He would flinch at the merest touch, squirm under his gaze, and turn his back at him.
John sat back up, just looking down at the other man for a moment. Their eyes met, Sherlock's half-lidded gaze glossed over, pleading him. "Please," they seemed to whisper, and it was then that John threw all consideration and caution over board.
John summoned all his will and let his eyes snake back to fix on Sherlock, who was gazing at him unwaveringly still. The deep furrow above his nose was an indicator that he had shifted into his deduction mode. Although this was a realisation holding the power to unsettle John even more, he felt the need to attack.
Mycroft’s phone buzzed as they were pulling up to the curb in front of the airport’s reception hall. He picked up and listened for a few seconds before he answered, “That is understood. Eagle’s Nest is a go.”
John swallowed thickly and took another sip, his mouth suddenly parched. He put his cup back in its saucer and cleared his throat. "I'm trying, Sherlock, but I can't do that overnight, you see. I'm not like you, able to turn my feelings on and off like a light switch. As I said, it takes time to move on from something like...
Sherlock glowered, fingers clasped tightly around the fingerboard of his beloved instrument, the strings cutting deep through the calloused skin. Droplets of blood welled up and ran down his hand.
Without actually thinking, John jumped to his feet and raced into the sitting room. He stopped dead in his tracks as he stared at the back of a familiar tall figure standing at the window, playing the violin, eliciting the sweetest tunes from it, extracting cries of love and hope and belonging and
“Thank you,” John said with the smile still lingering on his lips.
feelings like that
"John. Don't," he said before he turned around and left the crime scene, not waiting, as per usual.
. . .
"Sherlock?" he asked into the darkness of the room. There was no answer. John swallowed thickly.
Sherlock swallowed and looked away, turned his head to the right to stare at the skull on the mantle. “I can’t feel,” he eventually answered in a low voice, trying to hide the cracking in it.
“So,” John started, but trailed off. He wanted to say so many things, ask so many questions, but at the same time, didn’t really feel like talking -- not to Sherlock anyway.
with Sherlock Holmes. He was not, he told her,
Clara sniffed. “Because John is my friend and I love him,” she replied, her tone warning.
Sherlock let his hand sink as he studied her features, and nodded ever so slightly, before turning around and stalking off to the kitchen. “Tea?” he asked over his shoulder, but didn’t wait for an answer as he filled the kettle.
"I - you - what?"
. . .
I feel like my writing style has changed a lot throughout the years I've worked on this story, and that I've somehow unlearned to write a convincing Sherlock -- he does feel very out of character in this chapter. I want to pin that on the fact that I have fallen off the Johnlock ship a while ago (because I really, really liked Mary) and that it literally took me years to write "Domestic" (so it's only natural my writing is different now than it was back when I started).
sitting room carpet, Sherlock?" he asked, starting to unpack.
Sherlock, not fall even harder for him, and, well, Sherlock is Sherlock. For him to go and hug John like that is a huge thing in and of itself in my opinion, and it shows more about how much John actually means to Sherlock than it would seem. Maybe that's just my conception of their relationship, though. I'm open for differing opinions and criticism any time!
in beautiful, calligraphic handwriting.
“Sod off,” Sherlock growled and bounded across the living room to his favourite window, picking up his violin.
in every sense of the word.
He didn't let himself finish this train of thought. Instead, he shoved himself up and out of his chair, rubbing the sleeves of his plum-coloured shirt over his eyes and, with shaking legs, stalked across the room and into the bathroom.
Sherlock rolled his eyes once again. "If you say so, John. Whatever it is, it's worse now."
your friend, I don’t want to watch you starve yourself to death. Not as long as I can help it.”
John snorted. "Why, thank you! Not everyone can look as fantastic as you do even after three nights without any sleep," he snapped.
"John, oh yes, oh God, yes." Sherlock's enthusiastic cries filled his ears and he came hard, shaking violently, riding out the aftershocks of his orgasm with eyes squeezed tightly shut.
“So you’re scared. Of love and what it means. And I’d say that’s bloody normal for someone who clearly didn’t experience love very often,” she cut in. “Doesn’t give you the right to run around toying with people’s -- John’s -- feelings, first igniting hope that it’ll all be good and then throwing him out of your life. That’s not how it works.”
"Sherlock?" he asked into the darkness, his voice broken. He looked to the right to find his lover's spot empty and long since cooled.
. . .
"Even if that's so, he's only waiting for you to come home. He's not going to push you away."
with his flatmate? Could he just go back to 221B and live with Sherlock, knowing about his feelings, knowing that Sherlock didn't - couldn't - return them? Or did - could - he? Would he even want to?
A chuckle ripped John out of his panic. He glared daggers towards Sherlock's frame.
John, sensing Sherlock’s discomfort, put a hand on his shoulder, trying to encourage him. He squeezed gently and smiled down at his friend even though Sherlock still didn’t look back up. “I, what, Sherlock? I need to know.”
. . .
he mentally added.
“What are you doing, Sherlock? What is this about? Stop staring at me, and especially stop deducing me like that. It’s bloody annoying.” John shuffled forward in his chair, leaning towards Sherlock, “Isn’t there a case you could rather dissect? No message from Lestrade? No cold case needing to be solved? No pressing matters in dire need of your intellect?” He was waffling, he knew it, and he saw the responding snarl on Sherlock’s lips.
The tune ended, and Sherlock put the violin down and turned around, his eyes cutting through the darkness.
you're reading this, however, I thank you for doing so and sincerely hope you enjoy.
. . .
John blinked and tore his gaze away from his friend's demanding eyes. "I... I think I might... love you, Sherlock. As in being in love with you."
Sherlock took a shuddering breath. "It's the worst possible error that could have occurred, John," he said, pointedly not looking at him.
And he certainly wasn't in love with Sherlock. Full stop.
Clearing his throat, John managed to finally answer, “Of course you do. There’s no one left for you to experiment on, no one to do your cleaning and shopping and cooking for you, now, is there?” He surprised himself with how indifferent he was capable of sounding right then.
"Calm down," the dry baritone answered. "I'm just one of your body's protective mechanisms. Talking with your subconscious is supposed to be quite helpful for understanding one's motivations."
John chuckled. “Exactly, Sherlock,” he answered, grinning. “Not to mention punching the Chief Superintendent square across the face for just so much as insulting you,” he added with a wink. He didn’t mention the fact he was constantly cancelling dates for Sherlock too, for fear the detective might decode this information all too well.
"Touch me, John," Sherlock said, biting his bottom lip. But before John had a chance to reach out, Sherlock climbed onto his lap and pressed himself flush against him. Lips touched again, an urgent hand finding its way into John's lap, squeezing, rubbing, teasing the tip of his erection.
"You heard me," Sherlock responded, finally lifting his gaze, storm-grey eyes locking onto ocean-blue.
John huffed. “I’m not delusional. But I at least hoped he’d try to call me or send a text or something -- anything, really. I would have liked to know he still cares about me. Even just a little.” The heartbreak was evident in his voice as it began to tremble slightly. His fingers dug into the seat and he bit down harshly on his lower lip to keep from crying. He’d done enough of that over the past week and frankly, he was annoying himself with all the feeling sorry for himself he’d been doing.
"It's fine, Sherlock, I'll go. But this time, no matter how often you may apologise, even if you beg me on your knees - I. Will. Not. Come. Back. Not ever, Sherlock. If I leave this flat, I'm done with you and nothing is ever going to change that."
"Was," John said evenly, successfully suppressing the need to cry on Clara's shoulder. For now, anyway.
John sighed, exasperated. He lifted his hands in defeat and shook his head once again. “I worry about you, Sherlock, and that a lot. That’s the reason why. I’m your doctor,
“His flight leaves in two hours,” Mycroft called out to his brother --
The younger listened carefully, then nodded. “Go on then,” he said, genuine interest engraved in his rich baritone voice.
tell him you weren’t going to come back to him?
Clara’s hand twitched involuntarily as she unsuccessfully tried to suppress the urge to slap the tall man in the face. Sherlock stared at her in surprise and touched his cheek, blinking in what seemed to be disbelief and amazement at the same time.
So John, long-suffering best friend, housekeeper, and family doctor, got up from his just re-acquired seat and went to search for Sherlock's lighter in his bedroom. He found it ten minutes later underneath a pile of case notes and took it back into the living room, where Sherlock sat in the exact pose he had left him in, with the exact expression on his features. His face lit up when John held out the lighter.
“I’m not...I just...” He suddenly felt like a coward, both because he was afraid of leaving his beloved England behind, not knowing when he’d be over Sherlock and ready to return, and because he was running away from Sherlock, from his feelings, and from facing his friend, who obviously wanted to make amends. But then again, he couldn’t do that to himself. Going back to Baker Street would only end in even more pain, and he couldn’t stand it.
John fell back into the silk-covered pillows and closed his eyes with a sigh, playing with the silver band he still wore on his left ring finger. Touching this last gift, this forever unfulfilled promise Sherlock had given him was somewhat soothing.
Sherlock blinked up at him, confusion flickering in his eyes. As bold and brazen as he had been when it had been him testing and studying John, as shy and out of his depth was he now. He didn’t dare freeing himself from John’s oh so gentle touch, although the finger under his chin burned like fire. Instead, he cast down his eyes again.
"John?" Clara said just moments later. "Dear God, what's happened to you? You look awful!"
Despite Sherlock’s threats, John smiled and rolled his eyes in a friendly fashion. “Sherlock, I made you a proper English breakfast, and
He wished, prayed that he could just go out and get John back, his friend John, the only one who knew everything about him and still decided to stay, to put up with him, to care for him and never ask anything in return.
He swallowed and let his hand drop. He rested his forehead against the thick black paint and sighed, eyes squeezed shut. His heart beat rapidly and he felt suddenly nauseated.
he thought muzzily not long before he fell asleep halfway under, halfway on the duvet, happily pissed and oblivious to the world and, more importantly, to his confusing feelings.
know, anyway? Stupid bit- he didn't let himself finish that thought.
"How much longer are you planning to stand out there? Your tea is cooling." Sherlock's voice sounded from the other side of the door and John twitched involuntarily. Of course the madman would know he was standing here. John felt even more like an idiot. He shook off the embarrassment and inhaled deeply before he finally mustered up the courage to push the handle and follow his friend up the seventeen steps to the flat.
"You're... throwing me out?" John was aware he was having a whinge, but he couldn't bring himself to give a flying fuck. Anger suddenly burned in the pit of his stomach. "What the bloody hell
Sherlock shrugged. "Out of embarrassment. Seeing as you are probably the most heterosexual man walking this planet, it must have been a devastating experience to suddenly-"
"Thanks, but I'm a doctor, I know perfectly well when I'm healthy or not."
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked down at him, his ocean eyes roaming the beauty that was Sherlock. His gaze followed down the length of an alabaster neck, up and down an exposed, creamy-white, slightly flushed chest, catching for mere moments on hardened, pink nipples. He bit his bottom lip and inhaled sharply. This exposed beauty right in front of his eyes? Yeah, that was Sherlock, just waiting for him to leave his mark on that perfect, white skin. A strong feeling of something very raw, very basic surged through his veins, curling at his fingertips and toes, tickling at the base of his spine.
Nope, John wouldn't block his number. But he'd certainly ignore every stupid text message he'd receive until something interesting or dangerous occurred. And even then, he wouldn't jump to be at Sherlock's side, unless he felt like it.
He took a deep, shaky breath and squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, trying to gather up all the courage he could muster and slowly, but steadily, started moving towards his goal.
Was he really so self-centered as to send his best friend away for something he couldn't help? And what good did it do him now?
John blinked in utter disbelief. "I - you - what?" he managed eventually, staring at Sherlock.
. They die. And they don't resurrect just because one prayed and begged and hoped and cried and mourned.
Without hesitation he stepped up to the door and rang the bell that read
Greg nodded in confirmation, "Yeah. He-"
Sherlock thought, but left it unsaid. Instead, he blinked, then nodded curtly. "Fine, say what needs saying, then."
Mycroft's message had been of an entirely different nature. John held his phone and read it again.
Subconscious-Sherlock shook his head. "You know that's entirely untrue. You'll always be welcome at Baker Street. It will always be your home. I need you there.
. . .
"As I was saying, John. It's becoming worse, this...hurting."
She took a seat beside him and turned to face him. "Is something wrong with Harry?" she asked then, concern in her voice.
"I said
This certainly could have multiple reasons. Whether John just didn’t want to be touched in front of other people’s inquisitive eyes, or not at all. Presumably, John’s affection toward Sherlock was something... less physical, something rather spiritual. Purely platonic, perhaps? Or maybe he didn’t love Sherlock at all? Then again, maybe he did, but was in denial? Or did Sherlock misinterpret the signs? He dismissed the thought as quickly as it came to his mind. A mistake was out of the question. He was Sherlock Holmes, after all. He did not make mistakes.
“Sherlock,” John said, but remained unanswered. He sighed and rolled his eyes, stepping up closer to his friend and reaching out to pull Sherlock’s right hand away from his face and inevitably shaking him out of his trance. Sherlock shook his head briefly, blinking at John in confusion and slight disgruntlement.
He felt like a bloody idiot, standing there in front of his own flat, unable to open that goddamn door.
A glow of green of those incredible colour-shifting irises fairly pinned John to the spot, forcing him to cast his own gaze down and away from their beauty again.
A happy sigh left his lips and he smiled as Sherlock's eyes fluttered open and gazed around in confusion. "John," he murmured, his soft baritone rough from sleep.
Again there was a slight increase of pressure on John’s back. He felt Sherlock’s hand as clearly as if he was touching his bare skin, felt the texture of his calloused violinist’s fingertips burning through the thick fabric of his jacket, through the wool of his jumper and the fine cotton of his button-down shirt, very nearly scorching his skin.
He opened his eyes and watched as the shard dug a sharp edge into his pale skin right at the pulse point of his left wrist, drawing blood. It was beautiful, his blood, the way it welled up and poured out from under his skin. So warm, so dark.
The doctor sighed and shook his head. This was as close to an apology as he would get. "Fine, it's fine. I'm fine," he muttered, staring down on the table.
. . .
With his bag in hand, John entered the reception hall and looked around for ‘that coffee place’ he was supposed to wait at. Part of him expected Sherlock to show up and -- what? Get down on his knees and beg him to not leave, to come back home? He snorted at his own thoughts.
, John. My only friend. But you aren't that anymore, not now."
foul mood - which does not, I'd like to point out, take the form of playing the violin at three in the morning, insulting my flatmate's girlfriends, or
"You're not real. God, I must still be drunk."
No words were needed, the answer was yes, would always be yes.
How warped was it that he missed hearing the sounds of a violin in another room?
"Your...
his last girlfriend had said, and now the voice from last night's dream echoed in his head and he groaned.
Sherlock,” he said, anger making his voice tremble, “it was one time, okay? One bloody time, and I only did it because you seemed so goddamn vulnerable, sprawled out on the couch, for once at peace with the world and yourself. At least, that’s what you looked like. I couldn’t resist, okay? That doesn’t give you the right to--”
a point of no return, you know."

The door opens, then closes quietly. A floorboard creaks. The violin falls silent, the last few notes still resonating on the air. A cup and saucer fall to the floor with a sickening sound, tea spilling over fluffy pink slippers. Mrs Hudson takes a sharp breath, then staggeringly releases it. She clutches her hands over her heart and smiles in a way that speaks of tears and
The detective clenched his fists in defiance against the fear that was trying to well back up in him, not allowing himself to fall back into self-loathing and gloom. Biting the insides of his cheeks, he reminded himself what he was here for. He was going to find John and apologise to him. And no matter what happened next, he would make sure their relationship wouldn’t break any further. He would give them a chance to mend it. And it would be mended. Maybe not today or tomorrow. Maybe not in a week. But eventually.
It was the most gorgeous week of their life so far. Also the most sex-filled.
“Yet there is evidence that speaks otherwise in the bathroom,” she replied calmly, her eyes never leaving his face. “Perhaps it is that you don’t
Twelve days later and Sherlock hadn’t tried to contact either her or John. She looked down at her phone, then at John’s, and sighed. No new messages, apart from the twenty-two yet unread ones Sherlock had sent John the day she went to pick up his things. Briefly she considered calling herself, but dismissed the idea. If he hadn’t called, then there was a reason for it. Maybe he didn’t want things to be fixed just yet. Maybe not at all. Or he couldn’t bring himself to make a decision, or, or, or…
“Telling me I couldn’t handle love is
twenty-one-year-old Sherlock's voice said in the back of his head, and seven-years-older Sherlock in the here-and-now clenched his eyes shut tightly, drawing a shuddering breath, pressing shaking hands against his lips and heart.
Waking up was pure bliss.
He sighed.
With that, he hung up and put the device away inside his jacket before opening the door and stepping out of the car.
"He needs you just as much, John. Without you, he'd probably be dead by now. Without you, he's lonely. He even told you that. Before you, he was all alone. Before you, there was no one to take care of him."
"Thank you," he said evenly, much to John's surprise, and took it with two long, pale fingers. Their skin brushed and John shivered slightly, the motion not going unnoticed by Sherlock. "Stop it," he said irritably.
John blinked, confused. But before he could ask what Sherlock meant, the taller man continued. “You made it very clear you want nothing to do with the idea of--“
Downstairs, he placed the ashtray on the small coffee table in front of his flatmate and held the fag out to him. "Calm your nerves before I'm forced to knock you out."
A pair of lips replaced the wetness of John's tongue, kissing first, then sucking lightly. Teeth scraped over hot skin, making Sherlock moan again, having him turn his head to the other side to grant his lover a better access.
Amazed and excited and so happy, he thought he may explode from pure joy, John found himself very much at the edge. The caress of Sherlock's words left him blissfully breathless.
“What? No! Why? What if there’s an emergency and he needs me?” John protested, but Clara silenced him with a raised hand.
He shut that out a long time ago."
Sherlock stared out of the tinted window to his right, his left leg nervously twitching up and down. Mycroft glanced at him, from his face to his leg and back to his face again, frowning.
thanked him for it. Such was their habit. What was different now? Was it supposed to have a deeper meaning to it?
, he thought.
John swallowed thickly, squeezing his eyes shut tightly, inhaling a deep, shuddering breath. He opened his mouth to say something,
Sherlock nodded slightly and John smiled at the thought that his friend's intent was to make peace between them. Obviously, it had worked. John had not felt so much at ease in a long while. Briefly he considered telling Sherlock that, for once, he was not the one at fault, at least not
And even though Sherlock was all bones, angles and sharp edges, he still was so soft, so vulnerable. For the first two months, John had constantly been worried he'd break the fragile figure by just so much as touching or kissing him.
Outside, at the Yard, on crime scenes, at St Bart's lab, even at Angelo's he would treat John like they were barely acquaintances. It hurt to be pushed away like this, but John chose to suffer through it silently. He knew this was just how Sherlock was. He certainly did not understand it, but he wouldn't fight about it either.
"So," Sherlock said calmly once John was seated, resting tired eyes on the good doctor's face. He didn't utter anything else.
John blinked, then grinned. "If you keep making me tea as lovely as this every once in a while, then I might."
. . .

after all), he wanted to show him off and tell everyone who cared and didn't that it was
With a gasp, John pulled back, once again locking gazes with Sherlock, whose eyes were dark with lust, pupils blown so wide that almost nothing of the green-grey irises was visible anymore.
He wanted the world to know Sherlock was his, and his alone. That the Consulting Detective was, in fact, spoken for. Even though no-one but Molly Hooper really attempted to ever flirt with Sherlock (he was a
John was unsure of what to make of this declaration. He

to fall in love with you? And now you suddenly want to have me gone, just like that? Fine, Sherlock, what-the-sodding-hell-ever."
“Oh, Sherlock,” John interrupted, finally understanding what his friend was aiming for, fondness deeply edged into his words. He withdrew the hand resting on Sherlock’s shoulder and used it to force his friend’s face up by putting a finger under his chin. He shook his head. “Misinterpreted indeed, but the wrong thing.”
John shivered just slightly, almost unnoticeably. Yet, Sherlock picked up on the tiny motion and filed it away in a folder labelled
Irene Adler's voice echoed in his mind, its mere existence giving him a nasty headache.
John Watson.
John's tongue darted forward to lick at the glans experimentally. It tasted salty, but not unpleasantly so, and smelled of clean skin and sex. He enjoyed the feeling of hot, swollen skin against his tongue and fingers, and the sounds his actions forced out of Sherlock's mouth.
The fifteenth stair leading up to the flat creaked, followed by two short knocks of wood on wood. Mycroft’s umbrella handle.
Silence. Between them, even around them the busy airport seemed to quiet down. Time came to a halt as they simply looked at each other, one waiting, one trying to find his voice.
John, who had followed her into the living room, watching her every movement with enquiring eyes, gave a somewhat strangled laugh. “Oh, really,” he said, “he must’ve been In A Mood.”
“What’s it say this time?” John asked, hope engraved in his voice.
Why would an emergency be an exception to that? Besides, there are always hospitals, and you’re certainly not the only doctor in town.”
“Do you watch me sleep, John?” Sherlock asked then. His voice was calm, even, and betrayed nothing.
"Now you're just being irritable. I wasn't trying to offend you, I'm merely concerned about your health."
“None of your business. Do stop snooping around in my private life,” Sherlock said, but he knew that Mycroft already deduced what was going on.
Mycroft had once said. Oh, how right he was. Sherlock felt his body trembling, a shiver running up and down his spine, a chill claiming his heart. The hand above his sternum fisted the material of his shirt as more memories flooded his sharp mind.
he asked, and John felt his heart twist.
John blinked and tilted his head to the left, observing carefully. Then he winced; of course: jeans. He was wearing jeans. Sherlock didn't wear jeans. Ever. (They looked stunning on him regardless, John decided.)
John swallowed thickly. "I can't believe I'm having this discussion with myself... about Sherlock," he muttered and squeezed his eyes shut. "You know what I'm thinking, how highly I think of him, and not just because of...
“You taught me what it feels like to be loved, what it is like to reciprocate the sentiment. But I -- was wrong. I misinterpreted.”
. . .
I did it. I finally finished this. And even if no one is ever going to read it, I'm proud of it. I needed this closure.
"He," John clarified and looked down into his mug. He heard Clara inhale sharply.
With utmost care she sneaked up to the left of both doors and pushed the handle. Peeking into the room through the small gap between the door and its frame she could make out while tiles and sighed with relief. Nothing would’ve been worse than to unknowingly barge into the private space of the other (or rather, only) inhabitant of the flat.
Willing her nervous heart down her throat and back into it’s supposed place between her ribs, she took a deep breath of air before she pushed the black wood fully open and entered the small foyer.
“No”, I stammered, disordered still, “Best now before we dress for the ball”.
“The chunky moron…said ‘new’….new boyfriend….which implies you’ve had a boyfriend before”
Did he care? No.
The sun was full in the sky by the time I awoke, drawn from the most pleasant of sleeps by footfall upon the stairs, my mistress and Tom come to wake me from my slumber. I expected censure at my sluggish ways never before having lolled abed so late into the day, but no, Mrs Turner was perfectly content and asked in the kindest manner how I did and was I well rested after the trials of the previous day.
They wouldn’t be far surely? Sherlock had left in a hurry, dumping his bass on the stage and bolting out the door in just his thin sweaty t-shirt. It was early October and the autumn air was freezing at this hour. As he walked past a boarded-up convenience store he heard the murmur of two deep voices. One definitely American he thought, the other unmistakably Sherlock. Sherlock sounded tense, nothing at all like his usual ‘I’m cool as fuck, deal with it’ self.
The next part made his fists itch with the desire to march over there and sink a right-hook into the man’s finely chiselled bone structure. He had a hand on John’s thigh under the table, drawing slow deliberate circles, up, up, until he hovered just below his groin. Above the table, behaviour was normal as they sipped on drinks and chatted about rubbish, the only visible signs, to Sherlock at least, were the twin pink stains on John’s cheeks. Sherlock looked closer at the man by his side…lover? A hook-up? The body language suggested that this wasn’t the first time they had met here, so close to John’s workplace, how maddeningly convenient. The most disturbing thing about this however, was the dark wavy hair, artfully tousled in almost a carbon copy of his own.
“Did you hear that Malcolm?” Angela Watson stood with her ear almost pressed against the kitchen wall, “That’s where he’s been, in some abandoned old warehouse”.
“I don’t even know you anymore…it’s been too long…you can’t just come back and say stuff like that Victor…stuff you should have said back then”
"Could you lift your legs up,
“It’ll do…thanks”
“Harriet Watson was an alcoholic who died at the age of thirty three from irreparable liver damage, after spending the previous five years living in various hostels and homeless shelters. She never had a brother called John to tell her when to stop, to say ‘enough is enough’, to care for her when the demons came calling. An only child, a string of unsuccessful and abusive relationships, alcohol was her crutch…but you already know that part…it would be the same in any universe….some things are just inevitable….you see John?"
Victor met his gaze with an intensity of his own. “Did you forget Sherlock…that you were the one that came to me? That you were the one that almost battered down my door at three in the morning…practically threw yourself at me?”
John cleared his throat and leaned forward slightly in his seat, moving forward into Mycroft’s personal domain in a subtle gesture of defiance.“I can pull a decent pint”, he said coolly, “and mix cocktails too, all the poncey shit that that type of idiot seem to go for. I’m assuming there’s a bar at this do, and I worked in a pub for a while in my last year of school…..just an idea…if being my boyfriends’ plus one is out of the question”.
“Well that’s just fucked-up logic mate…where did you get hold of it anyway?”
“Yeah why?”.
“Tell me Miss Morstan, the only mystery I perceive is why one so pretty has not yet found true happiness, there are suitors aplenty in town and your benefactress is famed for her skill at the love-match, would you be the first to deny her that pleasure?”
Sherlock’s gaze drifted off to the right, as he thought. “You have rugby practice Friday nights, and then you drink at The Bull till either someone vomits or start’s a fight and you all get chucked out.”
But breathing was essential, although admittedly boring when faced with this hormone fuelled alternative. They reluctantly pulled apart.
“Not the pipe, no…from the gentleman who seemed to know us. Did you know it was he who called me there…. summoned to your side by a message from a stranger? He holds great power with what he knows, and yet I am indebted to him for the swift action he took on your behalf. But I do not know what to make of it all…tell me… does he love you?”
John scrubbed a hand through his hair, feeling more than a little self-conscious. The effect Sherlock had on him was devastating. All he had to do was turn those piercing blue eyes on John and talk in that damn, deep sexy rumble he had going on, and his stomach would flip over like he’d missed a few steps on his way down a flight of stairs. It was beyond ridiculous. But this could be his only chance. Sherlock could lose interest and walk away any second now, or worse still, head back inside the school and wait for Victor to take him home in his stupid, fuck-off, shag-mobile. John tried to find the right words. Hadn’t it all been leading to this – the chance to talk to him alone, away from prying eyes. He couldn’t mess this up, it had to be worth one last try.
He held my eyes for too long a moment, and weighed his next words carefully. “Did you indeed? And how pray, were you privy to a private family message I ask you? You were with him when he received it– do you deny it?”
Right, he was definitely reading John’s mind, or just reading him, exactly the way Sherlock did – oh fuck! Mycroft smiled graciously and ran his fingertips sinuously up and down the curved walnut handle of a very expensive looking umbrella.
I am shamed to admit that I basked a little in the glow of her compliments having frequently as a child been told of the oddness of my countenance and the awkwardness of my demeanour. That I should now be praised for what I had perceived as faults appealed to my youthful vanity.
Shit, they had two weeks of this waking up together, sharing a bed…and whatever else without the need to face down a roomful of students and Professors each day. If they wanted to, for the holiday’s at least, it would be easy to avoid all unnecessary contact with the rest of the human race. The thought was more than a little tempting.
The last time he had seen Charlotte had been when? Ah yes, delightful, it had been the week before he’d been sent to rehab, they had shared a joint in a bedroom at her best friend Rosie’s house, it was an end-of –term party if he remembered correctly. They all knew he was gay but that hadn’t stopped Charlotte from sticking her hand down his pants and inviting him to ‘lick her out’.
John.
“He didn’t say,” I answered absently. “I don’t suppose he can, considering. It’s his grandmother, she is ill” I added in response to her frown, “I expect that he will stay until the danger has passed, or…” I broke off then, mind skittering over the bleak alternative.
“A what now?”
“Right mate….whatever you say….I’m not staying to watch you get your cock out….I’ll just help you pull your zip down, and here…” he placed one of Sherlock’s unresisting hands in front of him, so that he stood, unsteadily, braced against the wall “and try to aim straight cause mum and Harry’ll go apeshit if you piss on the floor”
“I don’t want to go….back to her…I mean”
John….you must have
My mistress for her part looked most affronted on my behalf, bidding the girl repair at once to the receiving room to bring forth my new bedfellow and instructor Tom a particular favourite of the household blessed as he was with a most handsome face and strong lean limbs, resplendent in a fine silk shirt and breeches the colour of the most beautiful cornflower.
Obviously he had offended her naïve middle-class sensibilities. He tried again.
John pulled off his kerchief and set to wiping at my brow and cheeks where the dust and dirt from the attic had streaked them, the white cloth quickly turned grey. He took his turn, folding the cloth and wetting it with spittle, what remained we both hoped that the darkness would conceal.
John tried to twist round in the cramped space all too aware of how closely pressed together they were, wincing as a stack of old cleaning brooms clattered to the floor.
On the other hand, the hair on the back of his neck had been prickling for a while now. Someone had their eye on him, shadowing his movements down the road and Sherlock knew exactly why aswell.
“Oh…I can’t quite imagine that myself dear, call me old-fashioned but he’s a fly-by night if ever I saw one, shifty looking like he’s hiding something, and young Sherlock needs a firmer hand, someone to pull him back down to earth when he disappears off into that funny old head of his” she smiled fondly “Do tell him I said hello John love…and as I said last time…don’t be strangers” she squeezed his hand before she tottered off, the large G&T clutched in her hand.
He tried to focus on the two figures approaching, Sebastian Moran and Philip Anderson, two sly and vindictive sixth-year Slytherin’s who would search for any excuse to cause trouble for Gryffindor. Seb was captain of their Quidditch team, and Anderson played seeker and the lengths they were willing to go to win the House cup knew no bounds.
Our friendship with Charles notwithstanding, this did not sit easy, who was to say this Lestrade would not expose us if he found me out in due course and thence make it known? I would not then be welcome in any polite circles and John may cast me off rather than keep a whore or else risk conviction for sodomy. There would be need to discern his character first and in my power to do so, that at least I could trust. And though I yearned to hear more at this time, I cursed at Charles that he could not hold his tongue a little longer until we were alone. I stabbed at my food, a warm suet pudding too heavy for my liking, and smashed it to a crumbling mess in the bowl, my appetite gone.
He sat down with a wince at Sherlock’s side, the cold brick seeped through and chilled his arse through his jeans and the boy beside him tensed, his body undecided whether to bolt or give in. This hadn’t been part of the plan. He had come to say sorry for being a dick and to warn him that people were on the lookout, Doug Miller and his gang. It wasn’t a game anymore, they needed to stop this now before one of them ended up dead, and last night he very nearly had. But he was so close now John could count every freckle dusting over his pale skin .
“John…just John…we’re not in school anymore, well I am, you’re not, I know it’s bloody weird seeing us teachers out of our natural habitat….you look good…I swear to god you’re even taller than I remember…how long?”
“Well aren’t you just the sweetest thing my love”, she said, pinching my cheeks between plump fingertips, “fresh from the country and innocent as the day you were born. Take off your hat…oh yes…shake out those curls…oh, you fair take my breath away young sir and lovely manners to boot, you will do very well for my gentlemen. How would you like to come home with me dear? I have lots of young nieces and nephews and I think you should get along very well?”
Who am I trying to fool?
John should have minded that, he was nobodies lackey, and proud of that fact, but he didn’t, cause this was something more, he could feel it stirring in the pit of his gut.
“I can’t leave you Sherlock, …because…I love you”
“What does I look like genius? I’m rolling a rather splendid joint, which you and I are going to thoroughly enjoy”.
“I’m right…I knew it…what did you show him….what did he see for god’s sake?”
John excused himself as soon as he thought polite, and walked away. Suddenly it felt a little hard to breathe.
Before he could formulate a coherent answer, process the hidden implication, Mycroft swept out of the room and marched back into his study, interview over.
“Ha yeah, it would be hilarious to see you puke in his posh bathroom again…although he would probably kill us both”
’, I’ll cuff you…how’s that?”
Besides, you must not confuse my
John squeezed my hand lightly, and smiled in encouragement, “To have your hand is all that I’d hoped for.” He pressed his palm into mine and wound our fingers together. “Please do not feel that you need speak further, that you stand by my side is all that I could ask or could want.”
“All taken care of” said Sherlock with a confident smile, “He confiscated a beautiful box of French confectionary from me this afternoon….laced with a rather strong sleeping draught”
“We came to warn you” Sherlock said quietly.
A broken nose spilled scarlet over the damp ground.
“So”, John said as he glared at the half-drunk man before him, swaying and gripping the edge of the bar to maintain his balance, “you’re the wanker who’s been chasing after my boyfriend?”
“Okay then, that's good, Sorry, it won’t exactly do your hair any favours.” John seemed oblivious to Sherlock’s inner turmoil as he picked up his own and jammed it unceremoniously on his head. “Hey,” he said more gently, when Sherlock remained frozen, “Are you sure you want to do this? No pressure. Honest. We can always catch a bus if you’d rather not, I don’t mind.”
Mother thinks: Why on earth would such a beautiful boy want to ruin himself like this?
“Ermm…you want to do this here?” he squirmed uncomfortably eyes flickering to the unlocked door.
Now John now, it has to be now!
John sighed, a slight crack in the mask then, underneath all the snark and theatrics it did boil down to plain old brotherly concern. He could understand that. He had spent a lifetime worrying about Harry, and she him in her own twisted way, and he could see that with Sherlock there would be so bloody much to worry about, he was such a fucking hot mess, but he still didn’t think that was all there was to this, that Mycroft had his own agenda.
Victor snapped as he re-entered the room with a cleaning cloth and spray, crouching down to wipe at the mess on the floor. His shaking legs were willing him to obey the command but he stood, stubbornly swaying by the door.
“It’s Friday,” said Sherlock, out of nowhere, when John caught up with him, apparently not having noticed. He reached into the side pouch of his backpack and pulled a soft grey beanie down over his hair.
He hoped anyway. It depended on who was in charge. It would all be so much easier once Greg made D.I, then Sherlock could access as many crime scenes as he would want, and waiting was tedious.
John laughed nervously. “Yeah, well, I didn’t exactly handle things well did I?”
It didn’t matter now anyway, if he couldn’t have John then he would just be anyone’s again, go and work for Irene, an expensive fuck-toy for those willing to pay the price, and he knew exactly where to start…
John hissed through gritted teeth, legs heavy over Sherlock’s slender shoulders. He would have to move soon. He added a second and then a third soon after, mesmerised by the sight of his fingers pumping in and out of John’s body.
“You ready mate? Myc just called, said to tell you he’s fine, still out but stable and he’ll let us know the room number as soon as he can. Perks of being a government hot-shot I guess, getting the bloody VIP treatment”.
“What?”
A thumb brushed over the palm of his hand and he could feel the blood rush south to his groin.
your boyfriend,” said Sherlock, exasperated, “why must you persist with this ludicrous fantasy? And John is certainly not here to ogle anyone, he’s here to arrange the photo-shoot, obviously.”
“Just a rumour?”
“Um…we need another one Sherlock?”
“The wall”, he yelled at Greg, still standing there uselessly, “look at the wall in my room…go on…NOW!”
Slowly John settled again, breathing calmed, heart rate reduced, tense muscles relaxed and pliant.
Christ, was he joking?
Gregory would say that was enough now, to reign it in somewhat, but self- restraint had never been Mycroft’s strong point.
It wasn’t quite as bad as he had imagined. Sherlock had at least made a cursory attempt to straighten the duvet and the used condom was now in the bin, neatly wrapped in a piece of toilet paper, but you could still tell exactly what had gone on in here last night.
“I’m going to bloody kill him,” John muttered half under his breath, grabbing hold of Sherlock’s wrist.  Fingers digging in just the right side of too hard, he all but man-handled Sherlock back out toward the open door back into the workshop. They had almost made it through, but years of ingrained politeness made Sherlock dig in his heels, stop and twist around. “It was really nice to meet you sir.”
“Just do as he says Sherlock” John tugged on his arm. Greg was in a hurry and it wouldn’t help his case if Sherlock hung around just to cause a scene. Best just get him out of the way.
“Oh god, you’re not Sherlock, please say you’re not just going to rock up there and demand access”
He shouldn’t do this anymore, doesn’t like the heaviness that seeps through his body and mind, but tonight he needs….something….just to take the edge off.
Sherlock and John together.
“Sorry” John mumbled sleepily, wriggling to find a more comfortable position and accidently grinding on Sherlock’s cock in the process.
“Isaac…sorry mate…my key wouldn’t fit…has Mary had someone out to change the locks? We had a bit of a row earlier and….”
“Yeah, the evil little twat….Jim Moriarty his name is, I owe his boss rent or my sister, my mother and me are gonna get kicked out of our house….I’ve got til tonight, but I don’t trust him not to pocket the money for himself and deny that I ever paid. I’m up shit creek either way”
“Well, fucking Pinocchio, answer me this, seeing as it’s Christmas, and you should always tell the truth at this time of year…why the hell didn’t you idiots ever try and make a go of it? And don’t give me the ‘I’m not gay ‘ speech John for fuck’s sake…and you”, he rounded on Sherlock “I’ve known you a long time now and I ‘deduce’ you mad wanker, that you are head over heels in love with him”
I heard all, separated only by velvet drapes as we were, my mistress enquiring as to whether he might like to make an appointment for a further ‘conversation’ with me that very afternoon.
“They’ll be back any minute, we really need to make a run for it now”
John nodded, glad of the change of topic, ‘Yeah, and get some crisps this time too, Ready Salted.’
