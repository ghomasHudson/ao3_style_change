"Shut up Anderson!" Sherlock yelled after Anderson confronted him about his feelings towards John. Which immediately caught everybodys attention, because of the yelling.
All of a sudden, Picket who hadn't yet left baker dorm halls, busted into the suite. “What the hell is going on in here? And Jim darling, will you please turn down the damn TV. At that Jim didn't move, but closed his eyes and pretended to sleep.
“Night.” I handed him the bag, it had all my sketchbooks and notebooks, except one. He let me keep my pocket sketchbook and a pen with me. I always had the sketchbook, but usually when I was out of the cell I'd have to ask for a pen. I couldn't sleep, so I got up and turned on my desk lamp. I used a sheet out of the book to write something.
"She's high, again." John said looking worried. "And she's drunk voice mailing me, she does this all the time." He said, heading towards the door.
“Sherlock, it’s good to see you, and who is this?” Rick says pointing to John. Rick is in his late thirtys. He has black hair that is turning grey, blue eyes, and tan skin. he is buff and tall.
“Yay! I'm going to take a shower, Lizzie will want to also.” Will said and headed to go shower. I then walked down the hall to Lizzie's room.
The next morning they woke up and went down stairs for breakfast. When all ten of them, well eleven counting Jackson, were in the kitchen Kohen and Jeremy passed out food. They gave Sherlock a bottle for Jackson that they had all ready made. Sherlock fed Jackson, while only occasionally taking a bite of his own food. They all ate all of their breakfast even Sherlock, once John talked him into it. “Alright Sherlock ready to go, John you can come too.” Jeremy said, when he came into the kitchen dressed in a suit without a tie.
Leon came back in with Sophia, none of us realized when they left. They handed us our duffle bags that had our books and now other items we came into the detention with. Mine contained my Scooby-Doo t-shirt with the mystery machine on it, my jeans that have a flower pattern made of beads on both front pockets, and my Dora shoes. It also contained my heart shaped locker with a picture of our family in it, a necklace with five different locket charms on it. Each locket charm was a circle with a crown on it, each crown was a different color, Mycroft had given it to me. The black one has a picture of Will inside, the Green a picture of Mycroft, the violet a picture of my mom, the Red a picture of my dad, and the Blue a picture of me. It also had my princess watch, Will had got me the day after our family died. It was a five dollar watch. But he used his money to get it, he always said, “It's so we would always have time for each other.” Which would always make me laugh. I was about to cry. Greg came up to us and hugged us both then helped us fasten our necklaces. Will helped me with my watch, and looked straight at me.
“Just wanted to check on you guys and bring you your phones. I figured you'd rather have me bring them then Myc.”
“Just wanted to check on you guys and bring you your phones. I figured you'd rather have me bring them then Myc.” He said handing the phones over to John.
“Alright Greg, William, let's go get Liz. Would you like to get her yourself Will? I mean you'd have to be escorted by a guard. If you would like though, Greg could go with you and you wouldn't need a guard. I could meet you guys in the room.”
Once I was done writing the letter, I shut the book and left it on the desk. I laid in my bed just thinking about tomorrow. Thinking about the ways I can assure we get adopted. The ways I can stop myself from getting into trouble. I was also thing about how I was going to tell Elizabeth. She seems ok with the foster care, but the possibility of being adopted. I'm scared of how she'll react, but I guess a new family is what I want to. A place to call home. I mean I haven't had a home since Mycroft and my parents died. I fell asleep to the thoughts of possibly having a new family.
"She was a family friend before our parents died when I was ten. Then she took me, Molly, and Mycroft in until he was eighteen and got custody of us. She still is a big part of our lives tough." Sherlock replied.
“Well, you should have tried telling people, Sherlock, Molly. Although we also understand why you didn't.”
“You mean he told you when he beat up you up?” Mycroft said getting angrier by the second. He was mad, because he didn't see what Sherrinford was doing to Molly and Sherlock.
“Myc, I can't do this. I'm a sociopath, not a father!” He answered practically yelling, because he was having a panic attack. Jackson started crying, so Myc picked him up, and handed him to Sherlock.
John changes Jackson’s diaper and then changes him into the new christmas onesie Mycroft had bought him. They then head to the living room where everyone is sitting around the tree. “Sherlock, John, nice of you to join us.” Kohen says as the Sherlock and John sit down on a loveseat, and Sally takes Jackson into her own arms. They passed around the gifts and went youngest to oldest.
"Whatever. Shouldn't you boys be getting ready?" Myc asked the two boys who had just finished setting up.
“Oh and you guys can call us by our first names as long as we're not in class!” Kohen yelled after the boys.
Sherlock walked out of his room, now dressed and ready to go help finish everything up. "Ugh. Mycroft I'm not an idiot, I would appreciate if you stopped treating me like one. Also I am going to my teams party, and so is Molly." He said to Mycroft. Then he walked into the kitchen where John was hiding out. "Hey babe." Sherlock said pulling John in for a kiss. Then a little bit too loudly on purpose he said, "I apologize for my bloody asshat of a brother! Look at him trying to be all smart and keep me away when we all know he'll be there and he's not legal either, not in America."
"Got it." Sherlock said, but he already had a plan to go find his brother so he added, "you know actually I'm going to go find Mycroft."
“Yeah, here let me put these in the dishwasher.” I said and went to put the bowls and spoons in the dishwasher, but I was stopped by Will.
“I love you too Greg!” Myc said as he started moving faster and faster. Then they both reached their climax and came shouting each other's names. Mycroft got up went to the en suite to get a wet towel to clean them up then when they were curled up with Myc holding Greg close, Myc asked him, “Would you like to go to London with me for two of the four weeks of Christmas break?”
“Deal.” He then pulled me into a hug. It was the type of hug I hadn't had since my dad died. It was a fathers hug, not sibling, friend, or other family. It was the type of hug only your dad would give you. I hugged him back, and then we all ate with the occasional joke and laugh. We didn't even realize when Leon and Sophia had left, until they came back in with our duffle bags. The bags now contained our clothes from when we came in.
It's been forever since I've posted on any of my stories, because I keep getting new ideas and my mind has been going non-stop with ideas since I finished finals a couple of weeks ago. This chapter is also longer and I am planning on getting the next chapter up by next week, because I have lots of ideas. Thank you.
"Pourquoi diable est mon frère dans cette classe pour?" Sherlock said, speaking his fluent French and got everyone's attention while Molly was just laughing.
John shifted so he was hovering above Sherlock, and then lent down peppering kisses all over Sherlock’s face, until his boyfriend started moaning. John then pulled back, going back to hovering Sherlock. “Love, I do believe we should get up. We learned yesterday your brother can and will pick the lock. He was horrified.” John says although he’s smirking at his boyfriend.
"Philip, this isn't my makeup bag. This isn't even my skin tone!" Sally yelled. "It matches Sherlock better than it matches me!"
“No, but you may want your sketch book and pen.” Leon said handing me the book and pen. I gave him a confused look. “Your not a prisoner now, you can have the pen too.”
“No, it's alright. It's just the only people that know are those that work at the school with me, and a few police like Leon. Is it a problem that I'm gay?”
“Oh why are you so irresistible?” John asked pushing Sherlock up against the wall and started kissing him.
"Let's all give a big round of applause and thank you to Mr. Holmes!" Coach Morris said eyeing Sherlock. The whole team including Sherlock clapped and said thank you.
I had some trouble writing this chapter, but chapter four will be a shorter wait. Thanks for reading.
"Ahem!" Mycroft cleared his throat.which immediately made Sherlock and Molly stop. When they entered 221 they were greeted by yelling.
" I just got two drinks, but I can't find Phil anywhere. You want one?" Jim asked his friend from younger years.
Several hours went by and everyone had a few drinks. (In some cases, more than a few.) John got a very angry voicemail form his older sister which he knew was in the east room.
“Well that's… good.” Mycroft said leaning down the inch difference to kiss Greg over and over again. He pulled Greg’s red polo shirt over the younger mans head and threw it carelessly across the room. Then slowly started moving Greg and himself to their bed. He pushed Greg down and climbed on top of him. He then finished stripping them only leaving Gregs mouth to grab the lube and condoms from the bedside table. He rolled a condom on stretched Gregs entrance then lubed his own cock up.
“Yeah he took me in when my dad died, my mom couldn't take care of me so sent me here to Nebraska to live with my uncle and his husband.”
"Oh John, you know that people have to interrogate the people that like their other siblings." Mycroft said with a wink.
"Ok class in this class you will only talk in French if you have to use your devices to look up how to say something you may." Professor Morris
John went to the passenger side and opened the door for Sherlock to get in. Then went around got in and started the Lambo.
We didn't talk much on the way to the sibling room. When we got there though I finally realized for the first time in along I was having fun. I was interrupted by Leon and Sophia, the female guard. “Well what do we have here?” Leon asked followed by Sophia's answer. “I believe they were just laughing.”
Sherlock looked up to them for reassurance, then started. " I was originally sent here to give me a second chance."
Picket sent them a sympathetic look as if to tell them sorry that they got into this. “John, if Jim is going to be sleeping, will you at least turn the tv down for us, so that we can talk civilly?”
"Yes, well, we'll see about that Mycroft, you're not smarter, you're older and more experienced, but that does not make you smarter." William said back to him.
Then the two were off while Mycrofts stuff was set up in the suite. John and Sherlock drove silently to the Pizza Mansion. They got two pizzas and five sodas with Mycrofts debit card.
“I love you.” I said hugging her before they put me in cuffs. I had to be in cuffs, because I was prone to get into fights, not start them though.
“This is my boyfriend, John, and then this is Jackson my son.” he says nodding his head towards the little baby in his arms.
“Sherlock you made it!” Irene screeched as he entered the hospital room. While her parents just glared at him he went and gave Irene a hug.
“Well, I'll get two sets of drums, electric, bass, and acoustic guitars. Then a keyboard and piano, and two violins. The guitars, a set of drums, the keyboard and a violin, can go in your office. We can go shopping for them now.”
“He's right William. I'm not going to leave you here, because of a nightmare or PTSD. I still have it from when my father died, and that was about twenty years ago. The month of his death is always when I get flashbacks. It will probably be the same with you.” Greg said to me, finally stepping in.
"You know mum and dad would be proud of you?" Mycroft said as he saw his little brother leaning over the baby crib humming to his son.
“Yes he will, now here is the basement. I have a t.v., and it is connected to a kids Netflix, there are numerous amounts of toys and games, books, colors, movies, and more. Liz I'll show you two to your rooms, then you can go start playing and unpacking, while I show Will the game room.”
"I'm cross with you, Sherlock, very cross, but this is only because I love you, you know that, don't you?"
"is Rosie okay?" The detective's eyes were on Greg in a flurry of deductions, his eyes widening when he saw the incident report beneath Greg's folded hands.
," He barked, Sherlock whimpered and scrambled to get up on his feet, frantically ripping open his buttons and efficiently folding his shirt and trousers in a neat on the floor, his pants and socks joining their ranks in seconds. John smirked to see Sherlock's cock already at half-mast, and
"Don't play games with me, this isn't a game, you prat," John growled, "You may find it acceptable to chase after armed criminals,
"Me and John are fine!" Sherlock shouted, eyes ablaze. Clearly he didn't like that subject being brought up, and who would, with a relationship that took so long to work, with every bump in the road possible. The younger man paced Lestrade's tiny office with long strides.
"Nothing...besides disobey an order, snoop into my private conversations, speak out of turn and continue to revel in this piss poor attitude?"
John was silent, his lip pulled between his teeth and his eyes wide as saucers. His mind was fuzzy and he'd gone mute. His heart twisted and he shook his head, blubbering with tears.
John was still in mute disbelief when Mycroft whistled, the sub's head swiveling to his own chair, where Mycroft had folded his umbrella over his knee.
John's eyes wandered gratefully across his lover's face, caressing his faintly scarred cheekbone with his knuckle. Sherlock blinked, gazing at John with a silly smile, drunk on the most delicious blood in the world, full stop.
him. It was already a pain to deal with his sick desires, his thirst. And he didn't even do his bit around the flat!
Sherlock's stony expression did not change and he held up his hand again, snapping two times before pointing to the floor.
"Darling, I was getting the groceries, you berk. Oh, Sherlock, what have they done?" John brushed his knuckle across Sherlock's pale cheekbone, his broken skin such a rare sight.
John whimpered, uneasily resting his chin on Mycroft's knee, his muscles tense and his heartrate increased, Sherlock observed. He looked like a sheep, laying helplessly in the wolf's paws.
Sherlock was cold and dark and rude. He was a monster, a bleeder. Societal opinions on his species were changing, sure, but that didn't mean he wasn't the damned of the earth. That he'd live a long, torturous immortality, cursed to feed off others, always a monster.
"See that he behaves himself, John," Greg had joked. The fiery light in John's eyes made Greg bite his lip awkwardly at this statement before bidding them farewell and processing the bastard who'd almost killed Sherlock.
"twothankyousir," He mumbled, his voice high and soft in pain. His throat was burning with tears, his lip trembling as he pressed his forehead into the hard wood desk, his nostrils flaring.
"Night Daddy," She muttered, eyes closed and mouth open. John flicked off her light switch, turning on the night-light globe on her chest of drawers before closing her door behind him with a click and hurriedly descending the stairs. Sherlock was just where he left him, kneeling on John's chairs, up off his ankles to protect his sensitive bum. Even from here John could see his curly mop shivering. He smiled and approached, reaching down from behind and nuzzling into his neck, Sherlock shrieking out a tiny squeal at the tickle.
"Yes sir," Sherlock breathed, his face pressed sideways onto the tabletop. The younger man shook, his curls dipping in front of his pressed-closed eyelids. He sucked in a breath, bracing himself. John raised his arm and brought the folded leather strap down with a
"Shh, there John, it's alright, I know it doesn't feel good to be naughty," Sherlock murmured, and the submissive whimpered, coming dangerously close to actually feeling guilty.
Lestrade sighed, lacing his fingers together on his desk. "Actually, can I speak with you alone, Sherlock?"
Suddenly the door swung open, an out of breath John appearing at the door, panting and waving at Greg.
Sherlock didn't like Mycroft here. But he held in the grit teeth and glaring eyebrows for John's sake. It wasn't like his little crush on the elder Holmes wasn't common knowlege (whether John knew himself is another matter), and Sherlock was more than happy to up to ante so to speak with a bit of public humiliation, but nothing that might compromise John's trust in him as caretaker.
," Sherlock graoned and reached out his leg, poking John's good shoulder with his shoe. John dared a glance upwards, blue eyes wide and unsure.
"Shh, you'll wake Sleeping Beauty again," John tutted and Sherlock turned serious, eyes wide and guilty.
"No problem kiddo. You know where to find me if something is wrong, right?" Greg clapped a hand on Sherlock's shoulder, the detective giving him an annoyed look.
"Stand up," He said it as an order, but it was more the hands yanking him upwards than any real sense of submission that pulled John to his feet. His wrists were uncuffed quickly, and a quick swat relit the sting of his bum. John's gaze was directly on Sherlock, feeling oddly adolescent rebellion.
"John! John slow down!" Sherlock laughed, his post-case high still thrumming in his veins like fire. John didn't say anything as he turned the key in the lock, and Sherlock bit his lip before leaning down like the bloody giraffe that he was and kissing John's chin with soft warm lips, his breath fogging on the doctor's scruffly skin.
A raised red welt rose in it's wake and a whimpering Sherlock rolled forward on the balls of his feet, teeth digging into his bottom lip to suppress a groan. It hurt! It bloody hurt!
"No to what, sir?" Sherlock spoke softly, eyes pale and innocent, head of curls bowing between his shoulders to watch his feet, his hands tucked behind his back.
John glowered, but his body betrayed him, a direct command too hard to ignore, and knelt quickly, spreading his knees wide and lacing his fingers behind his head, eyes to the floor.
"I'll be right back," He murmured, tucking a curl behind Sherlock's ear before he stepped away and knelt down in front of his daughter, watching as she peeked up on her tip toes to see Sherlock over the back of the chair.
"Shh Shh Shh," John hushed him, warm steadying hand rubbing the dip of his back, "You're almost done, sweetheart, just one more, baby, then we're all done" Sherlock trembled beneath him, body wracked with cries, his bum a canvas of lashes, some a purpleing crimson. John pulled his arm back and delivered a punishing final stroke. Sherlock let out a torn sob.
"Feel the wrath of the Lord, you demon!" He felt the silver blade slice across his cheek. He shouted as they rained attacks on him, his screams silent through the sheer horror of it.
"Sherlock! Can you at least try to clean up? You've got blood all over the carpet, Jesus," John gagged, the carpet squishy under his shoes, the drained cat carcass on the rug was looking right at him. "Sherlock!"
"Good lad," John gave the smarting welt a pat and Sherlock grimaced. The second slap slashed across the first, the pain doubling and Sherlock's whimpers less quiet as he pinched away tears.
"Mycroft, sir, I-" John had barely spoken when the collar zapped, his neck exploding with pain, burning his skin and throbbing through his bones in a sharp ache. He groaned, falling forward on his hands and knees to growl through it, his shame only increasing. Mycroft tutted and Sherlock sighed apologetically.
sending a smile to his lips. There was only one man in the country who was allowed to call him that. The thought gave him a more pleasant air, as Mycroft always did, and he finished up his report quickly. He made to stand and go to the copy machine when there was a small knock on the door.
"Oh, someone is in sparkling form today," Sherlock deadpanned, second hand slapping hard and quickly across John's cheek.
"No! Never- I-Ah! three!" He cried as a thrid strike hit just on the sit-spot, "th-three thank you, s-sir,"
"Do you know how lovely eternity would be with you? I'd give anything for it, Sherlock, anything. Anything to never have to say goodbye. Never have to stop pestering you about your experiments in the bloody fridge. And it doesn't have to be now, we still have a few years, alright?"
"Please excuse me," Sherlock ducked his head and tried to step around them, only to be splashed in the face, his skin burning. He shrieked, tumbling to the ground and wiping at his eyes.
"Language, John, honestly!" Sherlock let go of his hair, but an idea sparked in his eyes. "Oh yes, perfect." The detective grinned devilishly, turning his attentions back to John.
"If you need some time off you know me and Mycroft can babysit anytime," Sherlock rolled his eyes and made to leave, "and Sherlock, maybe you should tell Rosie that you're not being abused, so she doesn't have to make another report?"
"Oh, Sherlock, you loon. As if I'd ever give you up for anything," John smirked, standing and pressing a kiss to Sherlock's floof of midnight locks. After a moment's processing, Sherlock jumped up and pounced on John, barely in time for him to catch him from falling as they collided.
confused Greg. "I heard them last night, Lock was crying and Dad was hitting him," She said flatly, laying the evidence before him, "even though Daddy saids that he'd never do that to me, he said that was wrong,"
"I didn't mean to be so loud," He whispered and John tsked, walking around to kneel in front of Sherlock, brushing his hair from his face.
Sherlock looked at him with a cocky smirk and snapped his fingers again. John swallowed thickly, his heart quickening as he pushed himself upwards hesitantly. His hands shook as he folded them behind his head, shuffling forward till he was just so close he was almost touching Sherlock's thighs. John's head spun with what was happening, the pieces still not adding up. Did Sherlock realize the language he was speaking? Did they just turn on and off?
"Why is everything a struggle with you?" John growled, disposing of the cat into a black garbage bag, wincing a bit at the gnarly teeth marks on it's spine.
Mycroft pat his leg in a gesture that undoubtedly said 'come here", and something else that John just knew was horrible.
"That's a good kid you've got there," Greg beamed, and Sherlock's lips curled into a smile.  "Right, off you go,"
"oui... oui... à bientôt" Sherlock clicked off his phone and tossed it onto his chair, barely sparing John a glance before walking past him to the kitchen.
" Mycroft said with a bit of a frown, grasping an unsuspecting John by his chin and inspecting his face closely.
John looked down at Sherlock, their eyes meeting, and for a moment his anger was stiffled, his heart warming at the sight of his sub, kneeling before him perfectly, just the way he taught him to, eyes so expectant and submissive- surrendered to John's mercy. The thought sent a stirring to his pants, but he cooled himself off with just one thought of Sherlock getting shot tonight, the very notion like a bucket of ice water.
"Sherlock, I'm not angry with you," John whispered reverently, eyes soft and understanding and Sherlock wanted to cry.  "We should call the police, Sherlock,"
"Good boy," John muttered and Sherlock let out a shaky breath at the warm praise, pride and softness flickering over his skin in a hot blush. His mind was fading from him, he realized slowly, drowzily, solely because he was on his knees. Kneeling before his husband, his dominant, simply the thought of that power was enough to make him floaty. He blinked and looked up to John, eyes soft and child-like.
"Not much," She hugged her knees, tugging a blonde pigtail between her teeth, chomping on the fibers. "I couldn't sleep, heard slapping, heard Locky crying, and I- I heard Daddy shouting, and when I asked Daddy he wouldn't answer me, he wouldn't. He's hiding something, Lestwade, I know it. And this morning Lock Lock wouldn't sit down, his bum hurt,"
Sherlock swallowed and set the sack down on the floor, rushing to the window, peeking out at the street, the lamps flickering to life in the dusk.
John's warm callused palms traced along Sherlock's nude skin, pausing on his waist, fingering along the bullet-shaped scar on his sternum, admiring him like the precious possession he was.
The door rang a few moments later, and John froze. His eyes went wide and he looked searchingly up at Sherlock. Sherlock was unreadable, simply standing and walking smoothly to the other room.
"Right." John sighed, walking around Sherlock to get some gloves from the kitchen med kit. "I could've gotten you some donations from work if you were desperate, love."
Sherlock was completely unhelpful, simply sitting in his chair and grinning into his tea. John blinked, his mortification hot on his cheeks. This was humiliating, utterly degrading and horribly confusing for his cock, who wasn't sure whether to get hard or not. John honestly didn't know which Sherlock expected of him.
hiya, I've got a lot more of this story written to share but I could use some feedback, is this a worthwhile concept? <3 <3 <3
"Do you think I'm lying?" She said, and Greg's eyes widened as he shook his head. Rosie was a sharp kid, he didn't think she'd make it up. Children were often the most reliable witnesses when you asked the right questions- they told things as they saw them.
"G'night, my love," John murmured into his hair and Sherlock closed his eyes in sweet relief, the endorphin rush hitting him hard.
Mycroft and Sherlock exchanged some trite remarks before Sherlock returned to get his own cuppa, giving John a scolding finger.
"John be careful, don't- don't touch my blood- just in...case," He sputtered, shakily grasping John by his cardigan.
"Sherlock, can you look at me? Yes, there you are, hi darling," John smiled, "I'm gonna tell you a story, okay?"
The door creaked and John didn't look, but Mycroft made some smug note to Sherlock who chuckled in agreement.
Sherlock's stomach churned as his ear tickled against John's curly chest hair, his heart beat loud and constant, the beat that kept life in John, the most pure golden life. The vampire looked up with a heavy guilt, the glow of John's tanned skin somehow brighter, and the delicious smell of his scabbing bites bittersweet.
." John breathed fire and glared at Sherlock so hard he could feel it burning on his skin. The door pushed open and John stomped up the stairs, not saying a word, and Sherlock blinked, his gut twisting in fear. What had he done? Making John angry was his least favourite thing in the world. What if John got so angry that he left? Oh God, what would Sherlock do? The thought of losing John, again, he knew he wouldn't make it without him. Sherlock twisted the silver wedding band on his finger and swallowed thickly before following his rather vexed husband up the stairs, his feet shuffling a bit. The landing was quiet, he assumed Hudson had put Rosie to bed hours ago, and Sherlock nudged open the door, his eyes wide and soft, finding John sitting in the black armchair, his ankle crossed over his knee, his eyes fixed angrily at Sherlock.
"Shh, one more thing love. And that solider knew that he would always be by that man's side, in good times and bad, no matter that cost. There is nothing in the world I would give up to lose a single minute with you, Sherlock," John whispered, kissing Sherlock's lithe pale hand with warm supple lips.
Sherlock purred, bonelessly curling himself into John's warm embrace. He tucked his nose into his John's neck, their legs entangled beneath the cozy blankets. He was sated and his parted lips were a deep maroon, dark against his porcelain skin. The smell of sex still hung in the air and he gulped it down heavily.
"You thought you knew better." Sherlock stepped away and John gasped, fingers tensing as he kept himself from reaching forward for Sherlock.
The fact that Mycroft was here was adding insult to injury, and John couldn't get out of his head the dozens of times the Holmes had commiserated on the blankminded nature of inferiors, and felt his skin raging with embarrassment.
He slumped down into John's chair, nose pressed to the fabric that smelled so sweet and familiar. He hiccuped wildy through sobs, his cheeks wet and hot and itchy and he cried even harder at how horrible it all was.
"I know, Jawn," He whispered gravely, "I'm so so sorry, I didn't think, I should've thought, I was so
"Sherlock! Christ, love, calm down, you're going to hyperventilate!" John sat up quickly, grasping Sherlock by his shoulders. "Love, we don't have to talk about it."
"He's fine, honey, we were just doing an experiment, why aren't you asleep?" He raised a falsely stern eyebrow but she avoided that line of questioning.
Dog in heat, eh? John had been livid. Not often did he shout at his dom anymore, but that was too much for even him to handle. Self control had gone out the window.
"You did nothing wrong, Sherlock, they were in the wrong. They tried to kill you, for what, touching them?"
John shuffled on his knees, his head dizzy with blood flow in the position. His punishment wasn't over, why was Sherlock leaving? His thoughts were hazy and his vision was colouring.
He gasped as a holy water was poured all over his clothes and his hair, his entire body convulsing and shaking.
"What if I turn you too late! What if you're old and grey forever and you hate me! I don't want to lose you yet, John, you're- golden and warm and I don't want to ruin it." Sherlock pushed John away, standing, stark naked in their bedroom, pacing from one wall to the other.
Oh God. Religious gang tattoo on his neck, Sherlock noted with a shudder. Oh God. Where's John? He needs John. His nerves were soaking in fear and his fingers shook in his pockets.
"Sherlock, calm down! She said he hit you, is that true?" Sherlock's cheeks went dark pink instantly, frozen with his mouth open slightly and his eyes wide. Greg's stomach twisted.
"Hi," The human chuckled, stretching lazily, his naked skin so amazingly warm against Sherlock's cold fingers as they adjusted. Sherlock lay across his chest and John drew circles on his bare white back, poking his favourite freckles for good measure.
"Yes, goodbye," The detective removed himself quickly and left. Greg groaned as he collapsed back into his chair. What a roller coaster. He grinned and shook his head. Now
Mycroft knelt down and scurffled his hair, John's eyerowd digging into a glare. He'd never try that when Sherlock was watching! Mycroft only grinned to himself, and the sight of Mycroft grinning was enough to freak John the fuck out.
John kicked between his feet, and Sherlock spread his legs wider, his bullocks peeking out from between his legs and his plump arse. John took more than a moment to appreciate it, thumb rubbing a warming circle across the delicate and smooth skin. This was punishment, but that didn't mean John couldn't enjoy Sherlock's body. He sighed, stepping backwards and unbuckling his belt, slipping it from each loop. Every metallic jangle sent a stroke of nerves through an already trembling Sherlock.
"Why are Locky's clothes on the flo- Ee!" She squealed as he scooped her over his shoulder, huffing up the stairs as she giggled. "Da-addy! Locky says when y'answer a question wif a question it means you're hidin somethin,"
But then John came, brilliant and golden, a sun looking for a moon, and Sherlock couldn't help but be caught in orbit.
Sherlock smiled softly, tucking his nose into John's warm neck. His John would always take care of him.
"No, I consent," He whispered, not even aware what he was consenting to. He slowly peeled off his coat and sank to unsteady knees, hands folded behind his nape, his eyes down and his posture straight.
"Hi Greg. Rosamund Mary, what did I say about not staying in my line of sight?" John raised his eyebrow and Greg turned to meet Rosie's urging eyes. At that moment Sherlock also appeared in the doorway.
"They're talkin' to Miss. Donovan, I want to speak wif you, Detective Inspector," She said very seriously, drawling out the syllables of his title with an adorably formal air, inherited from her Father. and Greg nodded quite unsure what to think, gesturing for her to have a seat. The four-foot-tall girl crawled up into the desk chair, sitting criss-cross in it with her hands folded in front of her chin.
fault! I'm just a bar tap you keep around for convenience! I forgot that His Lordship can't lift a bloody finger around here or wait two hours till I get home before he fucks around and gets his arse is gaol! Fuck this, I'm your husband, Sherlock, not your maid."
Suddenly, a small voice from the creaking doorway cut John off before he could respond. John's head swiveled to see a very awake four-year-old rubbing her eyes with her fist.
John closed his eyes. Nope, not even gonna think about that conversation down the road. He sighed as he tucked her into the covers, brushing her bangs from her forehead and pressing a kiss there.
Sherlock looked rather despondent, his flop of curls hung between his shoulders, looking frail and tiny hunched over his steaming mug. John sighed and set his own on the side table by his armchair, leaning forward and enveloping Sherlock's hands around the cup.
"Then we'll order takeaway, you berk, hold onto my neck," John wrapped Sherlock's arms around him and hefted him up bridal style. "God, you're heavy for being so skinny,"
"No, no I'm fine," Sherlock itched at the back of his neck and a relieved grin spread across Greg's face.
"Sod this, Sherlock. You kill all you want, see where that gets you. I'm done." John snarled, shaking his head and grabbing his jacket.
"Will this happen again, Sherlock?" John growled and Sherlock pushed up to shake his head, turning back to look John in the eyes just barely
"I suggest you speak, John, you may not be allowed to later," Sherlock caressed John's cheek playfully, his other hand winding through John's feathery blonde hair, tugging so slowly on his scalp that John almost didn't notice how much it was beginning to burn.
"You did such a good job, baby, such a good job," He pulled Sherlock's head to his knee, his quietly sniffling nose pressed into his thigh, and John hushed him gently as he carded through his curls, leaning down and savoring their sweet minty smell. "You're so precious, baby, and I am so proud of you," Sherlock whimpered and cralwed onto John's lap, nose tucked into his neck, smarting bum placed in the gap between John's legs, knees bent into the sides of John's chair, their fronts pressed together as John pet his nape, a kiss finding it's way to the crown of his head. Halfway between subspace and subdrop, John gently guided him upwards with his voice, and Sherlock followed, floaty and thoughtless. Everything gone but Jawn. Jawn was proud of him, Jawn said he was good.
was he delicious like this. Miles of delicate porcelain skin, even the white mottled scars that licked his back and over his shoulders, dipping into his clavicle. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
The submissive felt like perhaps his forehead and the floor were magnetically attracted, falling onto his hands and knees before kowtowing to Sherlock.
"I will repeat myself only this once- do you want to say no?" John leaned forward in the chair, elbows resting on his knees and his fingers laced in front of him. He observed Sherlock with a cold nonchalance and Sherlock wanted to disappear, wanted to cry, wanted to- he didn't know what he wanted to do. He wanted to make John happy with him again, that's what he wanted.
"n-ine!" He winced, groaning and bouncing on the balls of his feet, his chest heaving, "th-ank y-ou s-sir,"
"Grab him!" the leader laughed with a wolfish grin, the other two clenching their hands around his forearms. The fourth throwing a cloth over his mouth, the rotten stench of garlic leaving him dizzy and confused. They dragged him into the skip.
"Ah! Alright, alright, come on, let's get you to bed, mister," John chuckled and pulled Sherlock up out of the chair, but the lanky bastard kept himself all cacooned inside John's neck, hands roaming up under his jumper as the blanket fell off of his naked form.
That last bit had been a shock. John hadn't really thought of that before, even with the many times Sherlock had cheated death. The thought of Mycroft being the one who owned him....was not unwanted, persay. But he hadn't had time to think about it for long before being stripped and given an impromptu- spanking for his backtalk. And now he was cuffed and naked in the sitting room, and a displeased Sherlock twiddling on his mobile from his armchair. The submissive shifted on his knees and his simmering pink buttocks itchy as they brushed his ankles.
"I- well, it's, uh," Sherlock's cheeks grew impossibly redder, Lestrade surprised to see him so flustered like this, "I consented, to um, that,"
John gulped and stayed absolutely still, arse still awkwardly in the air. He glanced upwards when Sherlock suddenly was speaking french. He blinked, confused. Had there been a french case? Then he heart "frère" and "gâteau" his medschool latin caught up with his idiocy.
Sherlock gulped, the image of the sunroom at Pentonville sent a shudder through him,  his skin crawling.
"Just a domestic violence inquiry report, darling, just to gather some facts. I know this must be difficult for you, but can you tell me what you saw?"
"Ah Ah Ah Sherlock you're freezing," John chuckled, sucking in a deep breath through his nose at the frigid limbs that had curled around him like an octopus.
"John I- I don't-" Sherlock whispered, his face fallen and his eyes flickering everywhere. John deepened his own breath, helping to calm the panicking vampire.
"Right. Well, there was this man. He was a solider, and a doctor, and he was all alone. He had no friends, no family, and no prospects. His best friend was his gun, and every night he planned to use it the next. He was a dead man walking, walking nowhere at all, when he met his old mate, and his old mate introduced him to a mad scientist detective with the most beautiful eyes in the world. And the solider fell so in love with this gorgeous creature that he came back to life, and the world was bright again, so much brighter in the night time than in the daylight,"
“No. If they don't want to be apart of my life when I have my son with me, then I don't see why they should be part of my life at all.”
John went back to Sherlock slid off both their pants and pushed Sherlock back on the bed. “Now where was I?” John asked Sherlock who was already speechless again because of John kissing him. John slowly slid back into Sher then waited a bit for him to adjust. Finally John started moving faster and faster. Soon him and Sherlock were at their climax, once again thankful for the sound proof walls as they came almost shouting each other's names.
“Yeah I know.” Jeremey was getting ready to leave the living room when he heard glass break behind him where Sherlock was standing leaning on his crutches. “Sherlock, bud, are you ok?” He realized Sherlock was having a flashback. He picked up the photo and saw it was of Sherlocks parents. “Sherlock, what did they do to you?”
“Yeah ‘Lock.” Myc said taking his nephew from his little brother. “You know we need to talk about this?” Mycroft now had a stern look on his face.
Greg went to Sherlock and John's room and knocked on the door. He heard a faint whispered “Shit!” Then Sherlock say, “Who is it?”
“Ok!” He said slowly entering Sherlock as his boyfriend started gasping. Once John was fully in he realized something. “Um Sher did we lock the door?” He pulled out slowly went and locked the door then reinterred his boyfriend. And started kissing him anywhere he could and touching him anywhere and every where.
“We will all watch him, while you two are with Jeremy.” Kohen said, and picked Jackson up from the playpen. He then went into the living room, and the three going to the station left.
“Well our family might be, but I'm going to prove I can do this without their bloody money.” Sherlock said as Kohen and Jeremy entered the suite with Sherlock's back pack.
“Yeah and we don't care!” John answered and swept back down and gave Will a peck on the lips. Then Sherlock pulled them both back to a cuddling position, but this time his arms wrapped around John.
“What are you guys talking about?” Sherlock said very confused, and handing Jacks to Irene so he could go put his uniform on.
“Jeremy, is everything alright?” Kohen questioned coming into the living room when he heard the door slam.
“Me, Sherlock, and Molly all promised Mrs. Hudson when I got custody of them we'd still spend half of Christmas break with her. And when we moved here she said she still wanted us to spend the time in London. Since we still have our families estate.”
“Ok here you go. There are towels, and shampoo in your bathroom.” I told him as I handed him his clothes.
Thursday morning was just peeping for the party on Friday. That night the boys watched Doctor Who again.
Sherlock cornered Mycroft after the meeting to talk to him. "What the bloody hell is this about?" He angrily asked his brother. "I wanted to make sure my baby brother had the best." Mycroft answered irratated. "Well if you want me to make friends you have to let me have some space." Sherlock replied equally irratated. "OK brother dear, but I'm still helping." Mycroft announced.
“Because you know how I got married a few months after your parents died? Well I married Kohen here, and he adopted Philip.” He said pointing at Kohen.
When the boys got back to their suite they opened the door to find Mr. Morris, Mr. Tvrdy, and Mr. Nicholas sitting. Morris on the Right Love seat, Tvrdy on the Left Love seat, and Nicholas on the couch.
"Well that means you are comfortable talking to us." John said, so the conversation wouldn't go deeper.
Around six they were all freshened up. They started discussing food again. There was a knock on the door shortly after they were freshened up. Sherlock opened it, and as soon as he saw the second of the two men outside the door he slammed it shut. "Who is it?" Anderson questioned. "The principal and my nut of a brother." Sherlock replied. "So you just slammed the door on our principal? Wow so smart." Anderson said with a smirk.
John woke up first and loved the feeling of William snuggled in his arms. He looked down and saw Will start to wake up. “Hey babe, ready for the day?”
“Alright!” John smirked pushing the beds together. Then he grabbed hold of Sherlock and pulled him onto their now double bed. “I never want to let go baby.”
“Ok! Here let me sign.” Sherlock said taking the papers signing where he needed then handed them and the pen to Irene.
"BLOODY HELL SHERLOCK!" John yelled. Sherlock fumbled backwards still unaware of what was happening.
An hour later the basketball boys were in the locker room getting the pre game lecture from Tvrdy. “Stamford, Lestrade you two are post starters for junior varsity. Holmes, Watson, and Anderson your Gard starters for the junior varsity. You five are only in JV game tonight, but normally you'd play both.” Tvrdy finished.
“They’re having a memorial service for my parents, and they want me to be there, but I don’t know if I can. I haven't went to any of the other ones.”
About ten minutes later Sherlock looked at John. “So about that other thing we could do?” Sherlock suggested
“No, I did not.” Phil said looking at his uncle, then turning to Sherlock. “How did you know about that?”
“Sherlock, Philip, there is something we need to tell you.” Picket said as Sherlock and Anderson both entered the living room. Kohen and Jeremy were sitting on Greg and Mycrofts love seat and gestured for Sherlock and Philip to sit on the couch.
“I want it to be me and Greg, if that's ok with him.” I said looking at Greg with hope that he'd say yes.
“John!!!” Sherlock screamed as he came all over them. John then pulled out and threw his condom in the trash by the night stand.
Me and GLkid2001 also decided that the sports seasons at the schools in the story's go all school year round. Which means before practice started they were probably scrimmaging teams.
Hey guys just a quick apology, I know this took a week to upload, and that's all falter to myself GLkid2001. I take all the blame because I decided to do golf and well, that takes most of my time.  I promise to get more done I swear!  Anyway guys have a great day!
“Alright Mr. Holmes let's get your leg reset and get you some crutches.” The doctor said coming in to the room and getting Will rolled out so they could go reset it.
“So, he was having a flashback, and when I asked him what they did he ran out and slammed the door. Mycroft what did your parents do to your brother?”
"Yes and I noticed it was gone and I was going to give it to you for this anyway."  The older Holmes said as he walked into the dorm they were setting up.
“You two come with me. I'm for sure you're both high.” He said pulling Will and Jim with him back to their suite.
“It was his fault, he’s the one that gave us condoms and lube. He should have been more careful.” Sherlock says smirking back at his boyfriend. “If you want me to get up, then you have to get off of me.”
"That's true, but I took 40 from Myc." Sherlock said  looking at John, and they both started laughing.
“Yeah, hey Greg you said it would be ok to call you dad right? Also to talk to you about stuff?” He asked me as we started walking down the hall.
Finally got this chapter done. My plan is to have this part of the series done by Christmas Break, which for me is the 21st. Thanks for reading.
“Will I saw your grades and was wondering why you didn't accept skipping grades.” Phil asked, I had of course been wondering the same thing.
“Hey, what’s wrong, love?” John said going up to his boyfriend and sitting down next to him. He then wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and pulled him closer, kissing his forehead.
“I talked to picket he said the rooms in the suite are big enough where I can still have custody at the school.”
The next day Irene came over so she could take Jackson to the game with her. She walked up to the boys suite and knocked. When Sherlock opened the door with Jacks in his arms, he moved him a bit so he could hug Irene without smothering the baby boy.
“Hey, babe.” I said as I let my boyfriend in and kissed him gently, since the kids were in the other room. “The kids are in the sitting room.” I took him through to the sitting room, where Will had just finished his picture of the house from the outside. It looked real and everything. It was a sketch though. Lizzie had draw what looked like the house just more kid style. “Wow those are great. Will it looks so real.”
"Yes Molly it seemed as you have found us, but as it has been a long day I am both physically and metaphysically tired. I'm turning in for the night." Sherlock stated, heading for his room. "Oh, well than goodnight Sherlock!" Molly yelled after him.
“We've talked about this. You can call me Jeremy, and as long as your not in class or practice, you can call him Kohen.” Jeremy said, and then both him and Kohen said, “Now night boys.”
“Hey don't worry Will. It will be fine nothing will happen. Irene also said her parents are ok with Jackson spending this weekend there so you can adjust a bit.” Jeremy said them turned to Mycroft, “How did they find out?”
When Sherlock got to his dorm which was more a suite his three roommates had their rooms sorted out. There were two bedrooms, each had two beds, so he went and unpacked. Then Greg Lestrade came in and asked him to come out and meet the rest. He followed without protest. The three men had all went to middle school in America together so they knew each other.
“So we always have time for each other.” He said with a smirk, and I started laughing again all the sadness gone now.
"Night baby, and Jacks.” He said doing the same as John did then they both headed to the beds that were set up close to each other and intertwined their fingers.
“Yeah, I'm ready. Who's watching Jackson?” Sherlock asked as he got up. Him and John had already dressed before coming down, so they were ready.
When Sherlock and John got back Mycroft was set up, and had plates out. "We got everyone a soda, here's your card back." Sherlock told his brother. "Ok." Mycroft replied. "So have you guys been getting to know each other?" Sherlock asked the three that stayed behind. "No. We decided to wait for you two." Mycroft replied, knowing what his brother was afraid of.
It has been an extremely long time. There have been other stories I've been writing, but I'm going to start updating at least two to three stories a week. Hope you enjoy.
"I am now part of the college program they are offering from the college across the street. And also don't forget I'm still your legal guardian." Mycroft told his brother.
“They were business owners, I never asked beyond that. Sher we sat in their office when we were younger.”
Leon asked Will if he wanted his hair cut, and of corse Will did. Once Leon cut his hair, we went and put on our clothes. Will looked just like the pre teen he was when we came in. He had turned eleven exactly seven months ago, his birthday is January sixth, mine is December tenth. For two years though he has taken care of me. He thinks he broke his promise to Myc, but he didn't. After we had said our goodbyes to Sophia and Leon we went home with Greg. For the first time since before our parents died, I was seeing my brother happy.
“Also when the JV game is over you on the JV team  are welcome to sit in the stands with friends, but meet back in here at varsity half time and after the game. Plus no party's tonight. Understood?” Morris added.
“What happened with Sherrinford was a long time ago. Can we please just forget it?” Sherlock replied turning his head into his uncles arm this time.
This is about what happens with John and Sherlock when they get back to the room. Next chapter will be Greg and Mycroft.
"I don't know right know all I'm paying attention to is how brilliant and gorgeous you are. And how much I love you." John said and Sherlock immediately blushed. "I know we haven't even finished our fist date yet but I already know I love you, you don't need to know right now." John finished nervously and grabbed Sherlocks hand, which Sherlock held back.
An hour later the basketball boys were in the locker room getting the pre game lecture from Tvrdy. “Stamford, Lestrade you two are post starters for junior varsity. Holmes, Watson, and Anderson your Gard starters for the junior varsity. You five are only in JV game tonight, but normally you'd play both.” Tvrdy finished.
“Yeah, could you put him in it, it's hard to pick him up when I can barely stand?” Sherlock asked his brother, even though he was looking into his little boy's eyes.
As soon as they got out they were meant by four sets of eyes. “What no shirts.” Jim said staring at Sherlock.
“Well, I think it's set up now. Let's put Jackson to bed, he looks ready to fall asleep.” Mycroft said as he and Sherlock finished putting up the playpen. They stepped back and admired their work. Sherlock picked Jackson up from his bed and held him cradled in one arm, while he held onto the bedpost with the other.
We went into the kitchen, and I pulled out some snacks I had laying around. “I don't know what you guys like for snacks, I've got some candy bars, sour patch, fruit snacks, and also some ice cream.” I said pulling out the tub of chocolate ice cream. “Will, what would you like?”
They got up kissing the whole way to their room. They got in the room and John kicked the door shut and pushed Sherlock down onto the bed. “I love you no matter what happens ok Sherlock?” John said then started unbuttoning Sherlock's purple button down.
"Well you could've just told me, I wouldn't have been mad." Sally told Philip supportively. "So it's your makeup then?"
"Well of course it's not yours Sherlock, you're not gay!" Anderson replied. Sherlock walked across the hall to his room with a slight smirk.
"Yeah I liked studying it a lot as a kid." I answered as Mycroft shot me a glare, because he didn't know I liked history to.
“This is Philip Anderson, my boyfriend. Phil this is Elizabeth and William.” I said introducing them. I didn't add a last name, because they were still thinking about if they wanted it changed. Will stood up and walked over to us without saying a word. He reached his hand out to Phil. Philip took his hand and shook it.
“Amazing!” Will said pulling him back for another kiss. They ended up in a make out session that lasted for about five minutes, because Mycroft decided to wake up.
“Alright Jackson got his shots this morning so once we see that he finished the bottle he is free to go home.” The nurse said, picking up the camera Mycroft conveniently left there and taking pictures of John and Sherlock holding Jackson. Then once Jackson was ready to go home she took a picture of the couple and their son, then handed the camera to John and wished them good luck.
Here's the big twist, but I promise it has a good ending. So thanks for sticking with this story and I promise I'll right a mother chapter tomorrow to, I've just been so busy with my school.
"Ok! Everyone first off I would like you to meet the man buying our new equipment and gear. All your gear will have your number and last name." Morris announced to the now pleased team.
When they all woke up the next day Mrs.Hudson had brought them all some breakfast so they all ate. Then around eight they all headed to their first class which sucked for Sherlock, because Mycroft was student teaching in all his classes.
“Alright, Molly go talk to him please.” Jeremy said interrupting what was sure to end as a major fight.
When they got back they went and gave everyone the food Mrs. Hudson gave them. Then headed back to their bedroom.
Sherlock headed over to the east room, but instantly forgot what he went for, and ran into Jim carrying two drinks.
John and Sherlock kiss and so do others. Also something is happening in it. And John calls Sherlock Will.
"So know your even good at History?" John whispered with his lips almost touching my ear which sent a shrivel down my spine and earned me a smirk from John.
“Yeah I know why don't we talk about it now.” Sherlock said once Mycroft had laid Jackson in the playpen. They sat down on the bed. They both faced the playpen, not wanting to look at each other yet.
“Sherlock, could you come in here for a moment?” Jeremey Called out from the kitchen. Sherlock made his way to the kitchen and leaned against the marble breakfast bar. “Jack and Carrie Winston stopped by. They are bringing supper for the thirteen of us and the five of them. They also wanted me to give you this note.”
“William, you know how we've talked about if someone wanted to adopt you and your sister you'd have a better chance of getting out of here, before your times done?” Leon asked me.
“Yeah please.” I said and he cut my hair and styled it. It was exactly the way I liked it. When he was finished it was time for us to go with Greg. Me and Liz went to change. When we came back out we went to our new home, with Greg.
“He will, actually if you two agree he wants to do a week trial so you can get to know him. If that goes well he wants to adopt you. Since it's still summer they don't have school, even though we do. So would you like to give it a try?”
“Hey Sherlock. What's wrong?” Molly asked as she walked up to Sherlock, who was sitting on the grass.
“Oh William all that is wonderful news. Now I'll get you some lunch for you boys and two take some to the other two couples.”
Sherlock was most excited about the violin and sheet music he got from Mycroft. His violin is old and was bought cheap and refurbished, because him and molly had to save up the money together so that he could get it. John’s best gift was brand new hp laptop, also from Mycroft. Greg’s was a leather jacket from Mycroft. Molly’s was ballet shoes from Sherlock. Sally’s was Black Veil Bride concert tickets from Molly. Harry’s was a new phone from Jeremy. Shara’s was a new necklace from Mrs. Hudson. Jim’s was a Bring Me The Horizon CD from Sherlock. Philip’s was a new ACDC t-shirt from Jim. Kohen and Jeremy's were the same, because it was a photo album of all the them and Jackson from Sherlock and John. Mrs. Hudson’s was a cd of Sherlock playing the violin from Sherlock. He had written all the songs just for her.
“Well of course he can stay with us, and there's no way your moving unless I'm moving with you. I meant what I said last week, I'll always love you, and even this won't change it you’re my boyfriend.” John said holding Sherlock and the baby close.
“Thanks Rick, we will, I’ll try to stop by before we go back to America.” Rick then gives them each a hug and then they are on their way.
The coaches from the other team forfeited as soon as they realized Sherlock couldn't get up at all. The game ended forty-five to twenty-five the hounds lead. The paramedics got Sherlock in the ambulance and Mycroft rode in with him. Kohen and Jeremy took John and Greg with them to the hospital. When they arrived at the hospital the doctor was waiting for the X-rays to get done. They entered Sherlock's room and saw Mycroft comforting his little brother. Jeremy knew exactly what was going on and went over to help comfort Will.
“I want to wear my Cinderella shirt and and jeans.” I pulled the clothes out and handed them to her. She then went in and started her shower. I went down stairs and started throwing away some of the papers from the items we had bought last night. My boyfriend said he would bring breakfast from Taco Belle. I still wasn't sure what the kids would think of him. I was pretty sure they would like him, but Will might take some time to trust him.
"No. No. Me and Shara can go get Speedys'. We can take Molly and Sally to." Harry said stealing Sherlocks keys to his white Lambo.
The next morning around seven I woke Will up. “Sunshine, do you want to take a shower before my boyfriend gets here?” Will lifted his head from the bed and nodded, but made no move to get up. “Come on, what do you want to wear?”
“On really. Well, maybe he's afraid to admit it. I bet I could get it out of him.” He said chuckling and then jumped up, and started tickling me until I was half way off the bed.
“Nothing I just thought you'd like to meet the new person staying with us.” Sherlock said stifling a laugh as was Irene.
“Sherlock we know this is a lot to take in, but we figured it was time to tell you. Plus we were hoping, you six boys, Molly, and Sally would join us for Thanksgiving, since your going to London for Christmas break.” Kohen said.
“Don't forget Sherlock, Greg, John, and Philip you're all starters along with six others and the goalie.” Tvrdy reminded them. “Be at the field at one P.M.”
“Hey Will what's up?” John asked when he answered the phone and Sherlock could hear the boys in the background.
“Yeah come on Lizzie.” The way they interacted was the only thing that indicated no one had cared for them enough, since their parents died. I started to take them downstairs, and pulled out my cellphone. “Hey. Yeah their here. Yep they want to meet you tomorrow. Yeah breakfast is fine. See you then. Love you too.”
“On the contrary, really. We were doing a race, I stole your motorcycle and went out. I didn't mean for it to happen.”
“Alright then let's get your sister. I'll let you guys get her the door is unlocked I'll go wait for you three with Leon.”
When they all woke up the next day Mrs.Hudson had brought them all some breakfast so they all ate. Then around eight they all headed to their first class which sucked for Sherlock, because Mycroft was student teaching in all his classes.
"Uh let me see... World history, art intro, Geometry, Biology, Lunch, Culinary, English, Info tech, French, then Academic Decathlon. Yours?"
“Ok.” He went to the en suite in his room. I heard the water running as he brushed his teeth. When I was done with the bedding I sat and waited for him. He came out shirtless and in his basketball lounge pants.
“Do you ever want to do drugs again?” He asked me, causing me to look up. I shook my head cause that was all I could do. He crouched in front of me and put his hands on my shoulders. “Will, look at me. That's the past now, as long as you don't plan on doing them again then I think we're ok. Although, if you ever feel like you want them, or that you need them, come talk to me. I will help you, as much as I can, and as long as you will allow me. Deal?”
“Yep, he doesn’t head back out until the sixteenth of January.” After the conversation Sherlock went back to his room to read the note. It just said that there was going to be a memorial service for his parents, on the twenty-ninth. John came into Sherlock’s, well their room, and found Sherlock playing with Jackson on the floor.
“Hey William, would you like to meet Greg now? He brought you two some breakfast. We figured you could talk to Liz before he went into the room.” I only nodded, in response. I now knew the figure was Greg, but that also means he just saw me during a PTSD nightmare. He’ll never want us now. I messed it up. “Will, I know what you're thinking, and believe me you did not just screw it up, because of a nightmare.”
“Hello where here to see Irene Adler.” Sherlock asked the receptionist when they got to the hospital.
Sherlock looked at Irene and she told him, “Go to the room their having you stay in. I need some rest thank you for being here I'll see him tomorrow for an hour while he's here while he's here then I'll figure times out with you, maybe during games?”
“Well, I’m Rick, it’s nice to meet you, John, and of course Jackson. What all are you doing here in town and well England.”
Sherlock looked up from his seat just in time to see his brother walking across the field. "Why is he here?" Sherlock mumbled. "You know him?" John and Greg questioned with John looking at Sherlock, and Greg looking love struck at Mycroft. "Yes, he is my brother." Sherlock answered angrily.
“Thanks dad!” He then ran upstairs. Shortly after wards he came back down with Elizabeth. They sat down and started drawing using the coffee table as a hard surface. There was a knock at the door at about eight ten.
"Good babe, so all the same classes except math." He said with his lips twitching upwards. I just looked at Sherlock, grabbed his  hand and dragged him to the history room. All four of us plus Sally and Molly had almost the same classes, so we all sat by each other except in math, also French because Sally had Spanish. Sherlock, Anderson, and Molly had the same schedule. Then Greg, Sally, and I  had the same schedule except Sally's Spanish.
"Yes." John replied, getting slightly annoyed at the very conversational older brother of Sherlocks.
“Here's a duffle bag put your notebooks, sketchbooks, and writing utensils in here. I'll go put your personal stuff, like the clothes you were wearing when you came, in the bag. The two suitcases, and two duffle bags you two have, with your stuff left from your home, are already at Gregs’. Get some sleep Will, I'll wake you in the morning. Night.”
Next they went to Aca Deca where their Biology Professor Mr. Nicholas taught it and got them ready for competition against the rest of Nebraska, and if they make it the rest of the country.
*That bastard!* Sherlock thought to himself, but it was too late to stop Sherlock's actions. Before he know what he was doing, he had punched Anderson in the face.
Christmas morning Sherlock and John were woken up by Harry, Shara, Mycroft, and Greg all coming in with pillows and throwing them at them. “Go away!” Sherlock shouted getting up and shutting and locking the door in their face. He then went and collapsed back on the bed.
"First off, John is totally hot for you. Second off, Greg and Mycroft totally like each other. Good news! Your violin is back. However, bad news, Jim goes to high school here." Molly said, concerned about Sherlock.
“Yeah Kohen.” Sherlock said and when he said Kohen, Jeremy and Kohen both smiled. “Also uncle Jeremy, and Kohen the answer to thanksgiving is yeah I would like to spend it with you guys.”
“When they were gone once, I snuck into father’s study. He had left his safe open, so I decided to go through his papers. I came upon a file that said ‘Urgent,’ so I decided to look through it. Inside the file it said ‘Agents Violet and Siger Holmes, MI-6 Classified.’”
"William vous respectez votre frère lorsque vous êtes dans ma classe!" Morris yelled which startled everyone.
“They were going to the Opera. The people I was hanging out with, they thought it would be the perfect hit, since our family was rich.”
The next morning was Sunday, so when all five boys woke up they went to Speedys' Diner and Café. "Hello Mrs. Hudson!" John said to the older woman that ran the diner. "Hello John! Oh I see you've met Sherlock!" Mrs. Hudson said smiling and hugging Sherlock. Sherlock returned the hug and then said. "Yes! They are my roommmates."
“Mycroft!” Phil yelled walking into the suite, to be greeted by a do not disturb sign on Mycroft and Greg’s door, and the sound of a baby starting to cry.
"So you ready to go?" John said smirking at Sherlock. Sherlock couldn't stop himself from blushing back at John, which just turned John's smirk into a huge smile. Sherlock then nodded his answer.
“It is three floors, well technically five, because the attic and the basement are the same size as the other floors. I turned the attic into a game room for you, and my boyfriend picked out some of the games he thought you would like. I'll show you it in a little bit. Liz the basement is a huge play room for you I'll show you in a bit too.”
Friday morning when Sherlock and John woke up to Molly screaming at Mycroft about how he wanted to keep Sherlock in for the night. "He's a bloody teenager Mycroft! Let him go to his first high school party for Gods sake! He's making friends already, and they're all going to be there!"
“Yeah here Sherlock, I'll move your crutches.” John said as he handed Jackson to Molly, and picked up the crutches to move them.
"Yes well your both 16 and I don't want you guys out getting in trouble." Mycroft said, choosing his words carefully, knowing now that his brother was awake and listening. "Come on out Sherlock. I think we'd all love a nice, peaceful family meeting."
“Well we brought in the food from Mrs. Hudson, and yes Will you are actually going to eat you've barley eaten for a week.”
“Yeah, I'll set the appointment up, just get some rest. Jackson is calm now, so I'll lay him down.” Mycroft put his nephew back in the playpen. He went to leave, but Sherlock stopped him by pulling on his arm. He stood using Myc as a crutch, and hugged his brother.
“Yep.” When Anderson and Jim returned they put the playpen up, and Mycroft placed his sleeping nephew in it.
"Yes Molly, you're right. They will all be there. They'll all be drunk and high, and none of them will think anything about it because they are teenagers." Mycroft said back to her.
"Also you know you'll stay in the room over for a day we talked to your school and the hospital wants you to stay.” Irene's parents told him holding their grandchild then handing him back to Sherlock who was being the perfect father.
Sherlock snapped out of his his head and realized that Mycroft had disappeared on them. "Okay!" Sherlock said to John.
December seventeenth the four girls, six boys, and Jackson arrived at London. Jeremy, Kohen, and Mrs. Hudson had gone to London the week before, but Sherlock's doctors wanted to make sure the physical therapy was set up for their two to three weeks in London. Sherlock was doing so well they said three more sessions, which would be the first week, and he would be released and could start doing normal things. They got to the Holmes’ country manor and unpacked. Sherlock was very happy that his old room was on the first floor, because it was hard to walk upstairs with a boot.
Sherlock was getting ready for his and John's date in their room while John got ready in the hall bathroom, because Mycroft said they could not change in the same room before their date.
Sherlock and John return from getting supper for the whole group. Everyone gets to know each other over pizza and soda. Mycroft makes some of his own deductions. Molly shows up at the dorm.
"Um... Yeah one second!" Sherlock shouted back. Then about two minutes later they were both dressed in full suits. Sherlock had his black suit with a purple button down shirt, and black tie (which Mycroft made him wear). John was dressed in almost the same except a blue button down shirt. When Sherlock came out of the room they both just stared at each other in awe. Sherlock and John were about the same height maybe one inch difference but not much. So after a minute they were just staring into each other's eyes.
"Yes, but when I did I ended up with three broken ribs. I asked them two times after that. I only got an answer when I was twelve. ‘Ford told me, right before he left.” He said looking down at his hands.
"Uh let me see... World history, art intro, Geometry, Biology, Lunch, Culinary, English, Info tech, French, then Academic Decathlon. Yours?" Sherlock answered.
"You know you can call me Will or William. Also I know I don't have to, but... I-I love you to." Sherlock said smiling and stuttering.
January seventh, the day after Sherlock turned sixteen. The boys had a soccer game against their greatest rivals, the Omaha Knights. Coach Morris and Coach Nicholas came to the boy’s suite at six am. “Sherlock are you ready for today? You don’t have to play if you don’t want to. You are still varsity.” Morris says.
“It’s not always about intellect,” John grinned contritely, reveling in the dark stream of victory that came with getting under his skin. “What good is any of that if you have proven yourself incapable of emotional adequacy? There are some things you will never be able to figure out about human interaction, or love, or friendship. And I hope that it kills you one day.” John turned to give Sherlock one last glance, finally having figured out the detective. Finally having solved him.
Sherlock swallowed thickly, for the humid air had moistened his throat, and he spoke assertively. “And what may that be, eh?”
“As for how I figured all of this out Mr. Holmes, it was simply child's play. Elementary, if you will.”
Sherlock Holmes stood very still, like a pond or an immovable block of ice. His eyes had widened for the entirety of a split second, before retracting to their usual blase and empty sentiments. There was an inkling of shock, followed by such an infuriating stare, that Watson felt the urge to deck him across the jaw. The doctor had to repress those feelings of aggression though, because they were the polar opposite of ‘moving on.’ The opposite of growth and the resurrection of a bus boy that Watson had tried to kill.
He would want to join him on cases again and have lunch and dinner, and listen to Sherlock strike the violin. He would want to have tea and critique Sherlock’s ‘silly’ articles, and try to jam the godforsaken solar system knowledge into his head-attic again.
Sherlock felt his narcissism run deeper than God’s and it was something that he cared very little about under the shield of daylight. It was only in the velvet guise of ebony, when the sun had gone elusive under the horizon, that he stared at himself in the bathroom mirror with repulsion. The thin-lipped, square jawed beast was no devil, but inside of him was the audacity of a King.
