"Did you call for me, friend?" Thor hurried through the door and to Hawkeye's side, seeming quite concerned for him.
"Aww, crap," Spider-Man muttered to himself as he slung his way across the city again. "I'm never gonna get any sleep at this rate!"
"He always does when it really counts." Covering a small cough with one hand, she glanced at Tony and added, "I guess I can go to bed now. Or shower—that chemical gas smell is still in my hair." She sighed and turned to head out the door.
"Huh. Maybe Bruce CAN sleep outside on the beach if he wants," Tony said sheepishly. He hadn't thought things through that far yet. It seemed counter to their group vacation to leave a member of the group outside overnight, though. "We'll figure something out. The kid's shrimpy, these cabins are big--we could make him a sleeping bag or something."
"So, he likes you too? Great. There goes my trump card." The Jotun pouted, staring off at the medical briefcase instead.
Tony, meanwhile, ignored the hyper blond and looked at Steve with worried eyes. Uh-oh. Had they missed their chance that quick?
Powerful. Unstoppable. Devastating...in the most literal way. Loki stared at him openly and then came to his senses. The Hulk was also impossible to control. It was a dangerous game, but the payoff later would prove worth it.
“I thought this place wasn’t that popular,” Steve said, resting a hand on Tony’s back. “I suppose it’s a free country.”
"Oh, sure, who wouldn't be delighted to be written off without even thinking about it? I'm thrilled," he said sarcastically, shaking his head. "Do you even get that I didn't want to fake that because it's too close to home? That maybe, possibly, the real thing had occurred to me, and putting on the pretend boyfriend show would just underscore the fact that YOU have no actual interest in me like that? You don't, do you? You sure have gone out of your way to SAY you don't."
“He didn’t say it like that, but he implied enough. Something about forbidden love for somebody he could never have. Between that and both of us kind of giving up on dating after losing touch with our girlfriends, Thor and I have a lot more in common than I expected.” He paused, looking like maybe he regretted even admitting that much. “…Thor probably only talked to me because he figured I won’t be around much to tell anybody else, so if you could keep that between us, I’d appreciate it.”
Talking about Cap and Tony being gay didn't faze Bruce even slightly, yet he seemed completely oblivious to the concept that Clint might be interested in him. Was Clint just not even on his radar as an option...? Was Bruce's type Captain America?
“…I guess we should have told you,” he said slowly, shoulders slumping. “Wade and I, well.” Matt chewed his lip, frowning harder. “We sort of…broke up last week. We’re okay dating you—just not each other. You know. We’re so different and Wade’s such a…” Swallowing whatever he had been about to say, Matt pulled on a half-assed smile. “We’re still friends, though.”
Sneaking through the rain, side by side with Tony, Steve tried not to worry about the rest of the team. If he and Tony were going to get the drop on Loki, they had to be focused. Alert, stealthy—
He sniffled and wiped at his eyes awkwardly. Peter didn't have any family left except for his aunt May, himself, so he was probably a little too close to that part.
There was a blinding flash of lightning overheard, then a roll of thunder, and rain began to pour down on all of their heads again.
"You're the one who said 'steak'," Peter shot back, shrugging his shoulders. He hopped off of the wall down onto a dumpster top and then to the ground, looking up at the building. It was just across the street from them now.
Tony was uncharacteristically quiet as they made their way down the hallway. If Steve mentioned it he would probably get some stock reply about not talking so he didn't strain his voice, but it was pretty unusual for Tony Stark not to talk even when nobody else was replying to him, really.
"Doom will not go unpunished for this. If the mansion was not shielded, I would go confront him immediately!"
“I watched a documentary,” he commented, glancing back behind them as they went. “Most shark attacks are just caused by curiosity. Maybe it’s just curious what it bumped into?”
"Truly, friends, you are identical," Thor informed them, looking amused. "And there is no shame in a distinct profile. Framed by such eyes, noses such as yours make for a truly handsome visage."
"Why don't we ask Thor? I'm not even sure where the Hulk went the second time," Peter admitted, swinging right over the Avenger mansion's high security fence.
Tony shot Cap a look that said ‘rain check on that return kiss’ and straightened up, turning to Clint.
Steve knew how this worked. Doom would probably pick one of the weaker prisoners, say non-superhumans, and use them as a bargaining chip. The least he could do for them was to play along for awhile and spare Pepper from being harmed, too.
“Oh, I, uh…” Realizing he had better not turn down Loki’s hospitality, Peter accepted the coffee cup with a quick smile. “Thank you. I’m kind of weird for a guy my age,” he told Loki honestly, following him.
"Lock them into what? Cap could bust through most walls," Peter said sheepishly. "That, and that would be kind of mean. We don't want them to think we're being attacked or that anybody is in danger, or they won't relax."
"Hello," Peter said to himself, blinking and shading his eyes as he looked up. It made sense for Thor to be out in this storm—he was a thunder god and all that—but who was he rescuing? Why no other Avengers?
Popping a couple pain pills, Clint tossed the bottle back to Peter. After a very long drink of water, he shook his head at them.
As the hero turned to go back inside, sirens could be heard echoing their way down the busy bright street. Steve dashed back inside, finding the stairs across the office quickly and heading up.
"How about that pizza?" The blanket wearing Clint added, ignoring the frown that his twin had aimed at the back of his head.
"Hopefully not on this train. I'm meeting Aunt May at my stop, and the LAST thing I want is to have him anywhere near her."
“Okay,” Tony echoed, sitting back from the table. “What do you mean OKAY? If I ever catch you two doing the horizontal tango—you’re off the team!”
“Look, we hiked for awhile, then I saw a monster in the lake and we decided to head back.” Clint tucked his bow onto his back and pressed a hand to his side, hissing in pain.
A whisper through the crowd caught Loki’s attention and he looked up in time to see his brother gliding down to land on the front steps of the mansion. Thor slipped his helmet off and greeted a couple of the reporters at the gate, smiling widely.
"I-I'm not sure?" He whispered back, feeling shy all of a sudden. "You mean like actual dating, or just somebody you think about all the time, and worry about, and eat lunch with every day?" The latter was Wade, in a nutshell. Except for... "A-and maybe wanna kiss and...stuff?" He amended with a tiny, nervous laugh.
“Alright, back off. There’s no way Hulk would do that! Even if he was pissed off! If he did mess up their camp, it was probably by accident!”
“C’mon, he’s tougher than that,” Peter replied, hoping Hawkeye wasn’t offended. He was the most normal non-powered human member of the Avengers, but he’d survived things that would kill any average person all the same.
“Why do we keep doing this?” Steve asked, sounding like he was genuinely curious. “Every time we talk to each other, we fight over something. Models, alcohol, Peter. This is exactly WHY I tried to give you some distance. I don’t want to argue with you, Tony.”
Quietly, he glanced Tony’s way, giving him a look. Then he turned back to Wade, pulling on a careful smile.
Hopefully the Avengers hadn’t seen this meeting. Oh, shoot, wasn’t somebody assigned to watch Loki’s camp, even?
Peter was too smart to fool for long, Tony thought, even as he smiled brightly for the camera. The kid could tell he and Cap had something going on, but couldn't figure out what.
“I won’t play your sick games!” Deadpool announced, leaning to take Peter’s hand in his. “He’s mine. Back off!”
The comment didn’t earn him a response from Cap, who busied himself by snagging a bunch of the colored flags and leaning heavily over the side of the boat to tuck them into the rock. It took him a moment to find a spot for each one, but the result was very visible.
Clint Barton? Hawkeye? The most useless of the Avengers? Loki berated himself for not being able to think of his feet. He was, after all, wearing full armor in the blazing hot sun. The airy suit his persona was wearing was just an illusion.
Bruce sat up on his elbows and glanced around the beach to see if anybody was staring at them. It wasn't a private beach or anything, so...probably. He didn't seem that uncomfortable with laying around wearing just a little sand, but maybe that was because nobody from the Avengers had showed up yet and noticed him.
After thinking for a moment, Clint just turned and started up the steps again. Whatever. After coffee, he planned to find a nice place to sulk. Probably on top of the cabin or on a rock in the sea or something. Somewhere he wouldn’t see Bruce and he wouldn’t have to see Cap and Tony suddenly getting along.
"I'm f-fine," Steve said quietly, finishing with the wiring. He started buttoning the billionaire's shirt back up, only to realize that in his haste he had sent several buttons flying. Flushing as he glanced around, he squinted off into the dark. "I'm...uh, sorry about y-your shirt."
“Like m-me too? You and-and Hulk both? Oh wow,” Clint stammered, slapping a hand to his head. “That’s uh…”
Behind them, Cap sat the syringe down, pressing a finger against where it had been injected. It had actually left a mark. He nodded to Tony.
The only person not on the beach was Hank and Clint had seen the man retreating into his own cabin last.
The fake ice cream cart was still working to keep a crowd gathered. Even the reporters had given up their hiding spots to come over and get something cold to eat on occasion. While Loki thought he was handsome in his apron, he had better things to do than serve ice cream! Especially after a mortal had had the nerve to tell him that his scoop sizes were too small.
Spider-Man cautiously stepped back over closer to the two since they weren't attacking each other at the moment.
"You sure? I don't want to come back to check on you and find you collapsed on the floor three feet from the bed," he said drolly.
"Hotdogs!" Deadpool said happily, trying to climb up the wall to follow Spider-Man. After he struggled to find a hand grip, he gave up and followed him on foot. "Why would we eat steak?"
"I don't know, because the sign says "steak"?" Peter looked down at him as he crawled along. A little distance between them was nice...he felt like his cheeky self again already.
Peter glanced, saw them approaching, and waved for Wade to follow him, trudging over to meet them both.
"Uh, thanks Bruce, but you don't look so hot yourself." Loki pulled on a smile, trying to catch the laziness of Hawkeye’s expressions.
"Like I said—not ready to meet the parents yet, babe." The hallway was better lit now. Some of the lights were back on, but on a dim setting. Deadpool saw the melted open door and peeked in. Pepper had to lean around Deadpool to see inside.
“Like you said, Wade seems to be trying.” Catching the kid’s arm, Cap led him quickly after Daredevil. If the man needed fresh clothes, he’d have to go into Cap and Tony’s room.
"Maybe he's somebody else's tech, and Doom wants it," Tony mused. "Great, so who sent the impostor Hawkeye in the first place? It IS the only reason I can see Doom wanting him, though. We're almost there...we'll find out what Doom was trying to do when we ask Cap what they've been up to on the flight home."
A sudden kick knocked him away from Bruce's side, sending him rolling back to the couch. Loki recovered quickly, hopping to his feet just in time to dodge an arrow whizzing past his head. It was obvious who was shooting, but he only revealed himself after the first arrow missed.
"I heard Cap was back and came to see how he is," the redhead explained. She didn't really smile in return.
Tony was really missing his tech right about now. Not only was shutting himself into his workshop to tinker for a day or two not an option right now, but if he had his facial recognition software then maybe he could identify the weird blond over there playing frisbee with Peter and laughing like he hadn't a care in the world.
"Pfft," Tony replied, brushing off the comment. "I can swim drunk--you saw me, I was swimming. Besides, I'm not drunk, I'm just a little bit buzzed." Sitting up, he swayed slightly and planted a hand on Cap's shoulder to steady himself, frowning. Swimming had been nice. Balance hadn't been an issue when floating in the water. "Is that all that brings you to my side of the beach, a PSA about drinking?"
The police were cleaning up the mess that the Hulk had made and Spider-Man was relieved to not be bothered by Deadpool for once. Maybe he did go back to Detroit/Dallas?
"Hey buddy," Clint breathed, shivering and sinking into the blankets. "Brr. You're letting all the..." The blond fell silent, blinking hard up at Bruce. "Wh—" Hawkeye sat up suddenly, scooting away from his friend and falling off the bed—taking all of the covers with him.
“It won’t really affect us much, but we’d better warn Peter next time we see him. He still does the whole secret identity thing,” Tony said to Steve.
"Thanks. I think." Clint yanked the shirt off of his face and sighed. After putting it on, he looked back up at the roof. "Now, where's the food? Ah! And don't drop it on my face!" He added quickly to the roof, holding his hands up to protect his face.
“He wasn’t kidding about the ‘gladly’ part,” Tony commented, squinting up at the sky. “It’s so dark out! It’s barely past noon.”
"Ah...yeah. I didn't plan for the power going out. I used my light arrow in the living room. So, no, I guess. I only had one." He heard Clint let out a deep sigh. "Hey." The hand on his arm moved up to rest on his shoulder. "I know this really isn't the time, but um--I can't stop thinking about it so..." Hawkeye trailed off.
Ms. Marvel, who had flown ahead to tell everyone that it was a success, looked up at them from the front steps. She waved as they landed.
"He didn't get you, so he didn't get everybody," he pointed out, leaning his head back to Johnny's chest to look up at him upside-down. "If it's even Doom."
“I feel like there’s a pun in there somewhere about ‘meddle detecting,’ but I’ll let it go. Look, if we keep messing with fake relationships and who’s dating who, my head’s gonna explode.”
Cap gently lay him down in the hammock bed, leaning over him briefly to tug the blankets up over him.
“Uh, yep. Good call,” he managed, nodding. Wow, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt flustered. All he really wanted was some time with Steve someplace where they didn’t have to hide their feelings. Damned Loki. Why did he have to even be here? What was his deal?
“Does everyone have plans for today?” Steve asked. “It’s going to be a beautiful day, so Tony and I are going to enjoy the lake.”
Peter heard Cap chuckle and looked back just in time to see the big blond pat Tony’s back as he left.
"Oh... Uh, right, sure," Peter said sheepishly. "I didn't really bring any spare clothes or anything, I kind of jumped onto the car with the tackle box and that's it..."
"That sounds awesome, big guy." Clint came over and pressed a hand on the cell wall too. "I was about to eat the leg off my pants." He glanced down and then back up to Thor. "Any chance I could get a shirt now? It was pretty chilly in here last night."
Behind Cap, across the lake, the glampers seemed to be waking up. A half dozen people had emerged from the tents, gathering in their fancy chairs. The scent of fresh coffee drifted out over the lake on a gentle breeze, momentarily pulling Tony’s attention away from Steve’s struggle to accept the truth.
"Don't get too excited," Tony grumbled, rubbing his temples. He paused, frowning at Daredevil. "So you know Wade AND Peter. That must mean you're their 'friend' Matt," he concluded, arching a brow. Daredevil seemed so ominously-themed for a guy named Matt.
Well, they actually hadn’t argued about that at all—though they debated when to tell Peter. Cap eventually won and they opted to tell him after he graduated high school, which was way too soon. That was in this year, wasn’t it?
"Yeah, we don't even have any laser scorch marks this time!" Tony said brightly, kneeling down to let Steve climb off of his back. "Alright, ride's over unless you put in more quarters."
"Yeah. And I had robot pneumonia," came the sarcastic reply as Hawkeye rolled his eyes, heading back across the room to hover by the door. The man was still shaking sick—he was just doing a good job of hiding it.
Apparently he couldn’t compete with a flirtatious twin trying to steal his would-be lover. Loki chuckled to himself before he realized he was doing it. A floaty feeling was beginning to take hold in his head.
"Here, let me," Peter said hastily, scooping up some of the ground meat and starting to roll a meatball. "You don't wanna make them too big, or they'll take forever to cook through the middle."
“Probably about how much I hate being here and how I want to go home,” he grumbled to Spidey, dabbing his jaw with the back of his hand. Oh, that was covered in sand too? Great.
"...Tell me, what did Doom aim to achieve in taking you and the Captain? Surely it could not be only an arc reactor."
Bruce didn't reply for a long moment. Perhaps he was listening to the Hulk commenting on the situation at hand, as he was growing more awkward and shy by the moment.
As soon as the car stopped, Steve wrenched the interior of the door off and looked for the lock system. Clint stuck his arm through the cage and felt for any sort of unlock button.
Thinking back too, Cap just smiled at him, trying not to remember how Tony’s clothes looked when they got wet. The man had a very classy chassis.
“Peter, I’ve been in love—oh, Tony, I’ve been in love with him…” Cap trailed off, his mind swirling. He rubbed his forehead. “I think we should just play frisbee. I’ll work on this later.”
Spider-Man did a little flip and landed on his feet on the floor, heading over to the blond teen's side of the room.
"I know because he kissed me. The real Hawkeye wouldn't even want to, so..." He gritted his teeth and quickly turned his back on the door, balling his fists. “Forget it."
"...No," Tony realized aloud, frowning. "Not even the one who was with you. Pepper's still coughing from the gas, though—I should take a sample from the Clint that was with you and compare it against the others." He turned and headed straight for the door.
Should he be snarky and make some quip about soap opera death scenes? Tell Cap he was clingy and old-fashioned to be so melodramatic? ...Maybe be honest, and admit he was actually in a fair amount of pain, and yes, that plan to hook up to the power had been kind of stupid, but he'd done it for Cap's sake without a second thought.
“Peter was acting weird, but he wouldn’t lie about something like that,” Tony said, frowning in the direction they had gone. “Did you notice Matt’s missing his sunglasses today? And Peter kept having to lead him around by the hand, too. Yesterday he had a white cane.”
"If you really want to catch him, you'll need to get him alone. If he sees his helpless allies, he'll only fight harder. Trust me. I know." He added the last bitterly, absentmindedly smoothing out a wrinkle in his tunic with a frown.
“Apparently,” Tony replied drolly, taking a seat nearby. “We know what you’ve been up to, so you don’t have to play dumb about it.”
“Hulk makes a great sleeping bag. When he sleeps on his face, I fit on his back. It’s cozier than it sounds,” Clint said, playing with the handle of the first aid kit.
"I'll go check on him," both of the Clints offered, heading for the door. They paused mid-stride as they realized the other was also speaking.
Doom turned and walked back over to the table. Of all the things Cap expected, having a glass of water pressed into his hand wasn't one of them.
"It's Hulk. Usually he loves swimming, but I think he's asleep right now. I guess he didn't nap in the car earlier when I did." He braced his feet as another wave washed over them--a bigger one, waist-height. "It's been years since I swam as me without him at least riding along in my head."
Both Cap and Wade were distracted by the lightning, looking up at the sky. It had been a beautifully clear day. Where had that come from?
Well, that had come out sounding a little awkward. Technically he WAS always in his room, but...yeah. Bruce prayed the sandwich shop would magically open now and interrupt them.
Steve let Tony lead him along, glancing back at the God of Mischief. Loki was watching him still, a smile on his lips. He gave Steve a little wave before heading back toward his tent.
"Yeah, even I’m having second guesses," Hawkeye grumbled, making a beeline into the medical room. He carefully laid Loki down, arranging a pillow under his head with surprising care. "But you're way wimpier than me." It sounded more playful than anything, and Loki caught Hawkeye smiling at him. "But you know, I wouldn't have stabbed you if I knew you'd keep ripping it open!"
“Thor,” he breathed, stepping back over to Tony. “Thor can fly to go look for them. I don’t care if anyone spots him, we have to find Peter.”
"Brother! Do not wish my allies dead," Thor said, frowning and turning back to him. "Though he can be foolish at times, Tony Stark is a great warrior." Tony had just mustered up a smile at that when the thunder god added worriedly, "And think of the heartbreak the captain would endure should he meet his end."
"We have enough spaghetti to feed an army," Tony added honestly. "We're used to having enough food for the Hulk, so it's probably way too much, honestly."
It was hot enough that the rock was warm against his back and Clint took the opportunity to lay down.
"Nothing I wouldn't do for any teammate who got abducted and poisoned and shackled to the wall in a super villain's dungeon, right?" Tony didn't add a few of the things about Doom he'd been hearing, but judging by Steve's reaction to his question earlier...
“I’m tracking a notorious troublemaker. I didn’t expect to find Avengers here, so I really hope Deadpool hasn’t given you too much grief.”
“Please god, let it NOT be a man in an animal suit,” Steve prayed aloud, pouring batter and scowling at the waffle iron. Spider-Man had some of the strangest villains Cap had seen--And that was saying something, with all of the bizarre opponents Hydra had dished out over the years.
Bruce sighed, but let himself be led along. Getting anywhere near the straps on the bed made him uneasy, but he didn't think he had better complain after keeping Clint restrained in them just a few minutes ago. Besides, the Hulk could easily rip through straps like those, he assured himself. They were just leather.
Of course, it was still very dark. The arrow in the medical room and the lightning outside were the only sources of light. Loki squinted ahead of them. Where was the archer's room, anyway?
"Are you alright?" Steve asked as he hurried over to her. Examining her legs, he frowned. "Did you fall?"
He recalled a conversation about Loki that had had him worried. The trickster was considered effeminate since he was so skilled at magic. For some reason, that had made Steve concerned that they would be judged.
It was all just to entertain himself until his actual plan happened, he thought reassuringly to himself as he scrolled the news again.
"Yeah...sleeping probably isn't the best option, uh, self." Circling around the bed to be opposite Bruce, Hawkeye patted his double's arm. "What'd you want to talk to Thor about, anyway?"
Bruce stopped where he stood, looking back. The rain was soaking his hair down to his forehead, but he didn’t particularly seem to mind. It WAS warm rain. The air was so humid it was practically steamy out there. Catching the archer’s lighthearted expression, Bruce quirked an eyebrow and then stepped back, right into Clint’s space. There they were, standing near the top of the stairs getting rained on, faces just a few inches apart.
“Wow,” Tony heard Steve breath from behind him. He turned and found the captain looking over the couches curiously, cooler clutched to his chest. Stepping past him, Cap ducked into the kitchen and sat the cooler on the counter before he peeked in the fridge. There was a rustling sound, then Steve turned back to him and smiled, raising up a bunch of leafy greens in one hand. “It came with kale. Impressive.”
"Like a ragdoll." She muttered, soaring through the rain with droplets sizzling off her bright aura. "He seems to have talked the Hulk down—is that normal?"
At least somebody was doing the normal beach thing and hanging out in skimpy swimwear. Not that Steve didn't look amazing in what he was wearing, as usual.
After bounding back to the mansion, the big green Avenger had gone inside and placed Clint into the chair with surprising care, before swiping the whole mess of papers and desk out of the way and sitting on the floor where they had been. Clint had to cringe a bit at that—poor Bruce had been working on those papers for over a week.
When the archer returned, Bruce was back where he’d been standing before, and casually helped set the last few rocks into the ring.
Of the two of them, Peter knew Matt was in more danger, so he did the most reasonable thing he could in this situation. “Stay here,” he whispered, and leapt out of the tree to land on the ground not far from Wade.
“I guess it’s because Peter acts so grown up. He’s more mature than a lot of people I know. Peter’s a good person. One of the best, in my opinion.”
"...Which makes sense if I ever have kids, but then I'd resent it," the merc continued, apparently chatting away while Pepper was thinking. "So, I guess it would be sort of..." He scratched his head. "Wait. What was I talking about?"
"Tony?" He asked, trying to speak loudly without rasping. His lungs instantly rebelled in pain and he cringed.
Bruce frowned and did an abrupt U-turn, stepping over to check the cabinets of supplies across the room.
"With what? This stuff looks boring," Clint sighed, poking at another paper. He wasn't wearing his usual purple attire. Instead, he had a dark blue long sleeved shirt on, with a black vest over it. His boots and tights were also replaced with more normal jeans and sneakers. He looked very casual—maybe it was a Saturday?
"And he went to you to talk about it? Of course he did, it's not like there's somebody with a LIFETIME of experience at all that around here or anything," he grumbled, shoving at Steve's chest to swim down the beach the same way he'd been walking earlier. Of course Peter talked to Cap first--or at all--about this. Tony wasn't exactly what anybody would call reliable. Damn Clint and his damn tequila just made that look even more evident tonight...
It’s Tony, kissing Rhodey’s cheek while Rhodey takes a selfie. It’s something that has actually happened, a few months after Ultron. Tony has that selfie framed; he keeps it on his desk at the compound.
When he doesn’t feel his heart in his throat anymore, he puts his shirts back on and leaves the café.
And Steve just lies there, still with so much disgust for himself and for life in general, because he was dreaming of his husband, of his beautiful, amazing husband being in bed next to him, kissing him, climbing on top of him, pushing inside him and making stars burst out low in Steve’s belly—but none of that was true, none of that was actually happening. It was just a dream. And now Steve is there, awake, alone, hard, and disgusted.
Tony blinks once, and Steve comes down his throat while the knot at the base of his dick swells up just behind the arch of Tony’s teeth.
“Fuck,” he says, because there’s absolutely nothing else he can say, nothing that makes as much sense.
“You had all the right in the world to do that, Tony. It’s your body. I’m... I know it’s all my fault and I, I—”
They’re ugly thoughts, he knows. He knows he shouldn’t think about this stuff, especially not first thing in the morning. But he keeps thinking about it, about Steve having to invent this whole thing with sex every day—twice a day—so he doesn’t feel like he’s dating an archaeological artifact. And the only moments when Tony doesn’t feel like he’s crumbling into a heap of ash is when Steve is inside him, when he comes in Steve’s mouth, when Steve tells him he loves him and he’s not gonna leave him.
He doesn’t send anything back, but that’s what makes him decide that he has to keep it together, no matter how he feels about Steve, no matter the state of their bond.
Steve fucks him roughly and brutally, and Tony’s dick is trapped between his body and the tiles, and his skin is sticking to the wall and he—
, that’s just not fair. The fact that Steve probably is the one out of scale does register, but it’s easy to discard after decades of perfecting the fine art of self-loathing.
Did I do it all wrong, Stella? I see the sun burning inside my baby fade away more and more every day, and it's Howard's fault, but maybe it's also mine.
There are thousands of things Steve wishes he could say, but none of them seem to really matter, and none of them sound helpful. Tony knows them, anyway. He’s got to know, by now. If he doesn’t, then...
Steve worries at his bottom lip with his teeth, lost in thought for a moment. “Are you really sure, Tony? It still lasts two hours.”
“Tony, I didn’t mind. I don’t know how to say this without making it sound like I’m a creep, but hardly anyone has ever retained their privacy if I was in the building. I got used to it after a while. Actually, it’s other people that should mind, not me.”
“The only person I love more than you is our daughter. Nothing else comes even close. I can’t just watch you suffer in silence. No more punishment, we agreed.”
“No,” Tony says, shaking his head, as if he could deny it by sheer force of will. “Dad was… I was a terrible child, always making trouble and he… he didn’t like me, but Mom… he loved Mom, right? He was a complicated man but… Mom always made it work. Right? Mom always—”
“He’ll start having sessions with the BARF tech I invented; remember that thing I told you about before you left for Lagos? It basically helps relive bad memories, so you can change them. It makes you re-experience that event, but allows you to act differently than you actually did. I tried it myself, with multiple memories and... I didn’t always get the same results, but I always found it beneficial in some way, so I figured—”
This is Tony taking a leap of faith (in others, in himself) and doing something that is so incommensurably
“I used to feel like her. Like Maria,” Steve says quietly, almost timidly. “I knew I liked men too, but I happened to fall for a girl, and I thought I’d marry her and spend my life with her, so my attraction to men would never be a problem.”
“No, Tony, I’m not,” Steve says, his voice soft and sad. He sits next to Tony, leans to the side to rest his head on Tony’s shoulder. Tony turns slightly to look at him, his lips brush on Steve’s hair.
Tony tries to turn, but can manage only minimal movement. Oh, well. It’s not like he wants to be anywhere else.
“I’m fine,” Tony says, with the tone he always uses when he says that he’s fine without really being fine, a tone meant to convince himself as much as the person he’s talking to.
Past the living room, they walk through a hallway with a staircase beyond which there are Stella’s bedroom and a bathroom. She explains that she prefers to sleep downstairs, so she doesn’t have to climb the stairs as often as she used to.
Steve looks a bit perplexed, but copies everything Tony does, and shoots him a half-smile when they’re done eating, timid.
One afternoon, just after lunch, Tony comes back to Avengers Mountain from a meeting in the city. A bit of a headache is blooming between his eyes, so he takes off his jacket and tie, unbuttons his collar, rolls up his sleeves, and splashes his face with cold water.
Steve doesn’t need to ask if he can touch Tony now. He simply knows that he can, and he does, and Tony thinks that it’s good, to be held like this by your Alpha even if you aren’t a worthy Omega.
“By nature, Steve, I don’t hold grudges. I’m the man of second chances, and I firmly believe everyone deserves one. That’s how I work. That’s me. But that day, Steve, that day when I looked at you from inside the car and I felt what I felt, I hated myself like I’ve never hated anything or anyone else in my entire stupid life. I couldn’t believe that not even betraying me like you did could do anything against the way I felt about you. I couldn’t accept it. I couldn’t let you have it that easy.
“Would you?” Tony insists, and he is officially the shittiest human ever. But he needs to know. After the way Steve tackled him to the ground, he needs to know.
He remembers how wet he was, how swollen Steve’s knot felt inside him; he remembers how hard Steve bit on his shoulder, over the mark already there. The smell of
And here, in the middle of nowhere, a million miles away from everything that happened, with only the sun and the countryside as his witnesses, Steve remembers the most important thing of all, the only thing that matters, the only thing that can save them from all the shit of the past few months.
, and Steve knew, right then and there. He knew the moment had passed them by. And when he turned to look at Tony in the conference room, Steve had hoped, how he had hoped, to find on Tony’s face a doubtful frown to match Steve’s, to see him give Steve a little nod, as in,
“You’re a good person, Steve. Aunt Peggy always said you were, she’d tell me all kinds of stories about you, but... it’s not about Captain America, you know. It’s about you.”
“She said no. I insisted, and she kept saying no. I called her the next day. I told her when my plane would leave, that I had booked tickets for the both of you. I said I’d be at the airport, waiting for her. But she never came. She never came… So I left, and I didn’t do anything except offer her a shoulder to cry on from an ocean away. Two years later, I met Laura, and fell in love with her. We lived happily ever after for almost forty years. And Maria didn’t.”
He notices his thrusts becoming erratic, the rhythm faltering, his thighs shake. He feels something rip behind his navel, something flare up in the small of his back and he comes, deep inside Tony, biting the bruise on his shoulder, digging into his back with his nails, smiling when he hears Tony mutter, “Holy shit, yeah,” to himself.
It soon becomes clear to Tony that he has to be the one to make the real first move with Steve. Steve won’t go further, no matter how much Tony implicitly encourages him to.
“I haven’t really slept since we went to Stella. Only a few hours, but I always have these strange dreams, and… and with all that’s happened, I just… I just want to sleep for, like, five hours straight. I’d settle for four. But I, I can’t… Steve.”
Steve is familiar with the concept, more than he’d like to be. He’s always wondered why his healing factor doesn’t take care of stuff like that, of the chemical imbalance in his brain. Or maybe it does as much as possible to keep him functional. Maybe without the serum the guilt wouldn’t even let him get up from bed in the morning.
He looks down at her, and his eyes widen. He touches his forehead, almost confused. He says, “Oh my god,” under his breath, then covers his mouth with his hand for a moment.
He looks around himself while he runs, at the seemingly endless expanse of the countryside. He wonders if the landscape will change at one point or another, but no, it’s more of the same for miles and miles. The sun beats down on him relentlessly, on the cypresses lining the way to a farmhouse, on the small lakes he sees at the base of this or that hill, on the precise geometry that decorates the gentle slopes of the landscape, created by the irregular transitions from one crop to another—sunflowers, wheat, olive trees, vineyards, orchards.
Tony is staring up at him, eyes wide with surprise—at himself, maybe, or at what Steve can bring out of him. He raises his arms to reach for Steve, wants him close. Steve shifts on top of him, hugs him, holds him through the aftershock of his orgasm. Tony kisses him, sloppy, open-mouthed, like he can’t be bothered with technique right now, he only cares about Steve’s lips touching his.
Steve has to hide his reluctance before breaking contact with Tony, but in the end he gets up and exits the room.
The sensation isn’t utterly novel. Tony’s always felt bad about himself, but it was something private, that he kept for himself. He never shared it with anyone, always shielded that part of his mind even from Steve when they first created the bond. But now it’s all exposed, all out in the open—there are all his mistakes, there, lined up in an orderly fashion so they can be examined and scrutinized; he can gauge how much they weigh on his heart, how much they’ve hurt Steve and Sarah. He never thought that calculating an exact quantity could disrupt him so intimately.
“Yeah,” he says, slowly, using the bond to communicate the truth of his words to Tony, “I, I do. I want you. If… if you’ll have me.”
“Tony, I’m so sor—,” Steve hurries to say, desperately trying to extract himself from Tony as fast and as carefully as he can, but Tony locks his ankles behind Steve’s back, presses down on his butt, keeps him in place.
good. He doesn’t know if it’s the air, the countryside, the sun, Tony’s presence, his voice saying all those names in Italian…
, someone who has built an entire reputation on being a playboy. It’s not that he actually slept around as much as he wanted the tabloids to think he did, but he did have a lot of fun in his younger years. Sex always made him feel good; even when it was a way to fulfill a different kind of desire, it was still good. Giving and receiving pleasure was something Tony always enjoyed, both when it was casual, and during his few and brief relationships. And he was great at it, too; he was a considerate lover, generous, thoughtful, and he always made sure the other person (or, well, people) was having a good time. He was attractive and he knew it, always kept in excellent shape, had top-notch stamina, and he could go at it for quite some time.
But the difference itself, the discrepancy in the way Steve loves, that’s not Peggy’s fault, or Tony’s, or even Steve’s. It’s just the facts, the way things went. If a cruel destiny hadn’t separated them, he knows his love for Peggy would have grown into this, too.
Steve takes Tony by the arms and pushes him away delicately. The loss of Tony’s mouth on his makes him regret this immediately, but he needs to look Tony in the eye and understand what’s happening.
Tony’s eyes are closed, so he doesn’t notice what Steve is doing with his other hand until he starts tracing Tony’s bottom lip with a finger, making him open his mouth. Steve kisses him, slow and languid but demanding, shoving his tongue into Tony’s mouth, reaching so deep that Tony feels trapped by it for a moment, feels… held.
In his mind, he goes over the places he wants to see in Florence, wonders if they’ll manage to see the Uffizi Gallery or if Tony will be well and truly done with art after all the churches Steve wishes to visit. But if his behaviour up to this point is any indication of the future, Tony will probably just suffer in silence, retire to a corner of whatever room Steve is inspecting, and work on his phone when he thinks Steve can’t see him.
“Even though the only thing that makes sense would be for him to have sex with his bondmate. And if he doesn’t… I think… Tony, I think this could kill him. I think Steve is dying.”
And Tony wants not to be selfish. But he’s in pain, and he needs this, even if he doesn’t deserve it, and he can’t do it for himself.
Tony’s eyebrows are still knitted together when he shifts closer to Steve, planting his face on his chest. He lifts his head a bit and sniffs Steve’s throat; tries to go for inconspicuous and fails.
Steve leaves, and Tony doesn’t want him to leave, he promised he’d stay, he promised he wouldn’t leave Tony, where did he—
It really hits him soon after, while Tony is in the bathroom. Steve should have realized sooner. But it’s been so long—
“You’re gonna pay for this. I’ll have my revenge,” Tony says, careful to keep his tone light, joking.
“Hey. I’ve got you. I’ve got you,” he whispers an inch from Tony’s mouth and Tony just looks at him, completely lost, sweat peppering his forehead, pooling at the hollow of his throat. Steve sucks at it, savors the salty taste of Tony’s skin. “I’m not leaving you. I’m here. I love you.”
“I want… I’d like… Dammit.” Tony doesn’t move, doesn’t try to say anything. That’s what gives Steve courage to keep talking. “A relationship, Tony. A real one. That’s what I’m trying to—”
“I wish I could do something about this. That there was anything that could be done,” Tony whispers.
Steve’s dick protests the lack of pressure with a jolt of pain, but he forces it at the back of his awareness with a small struggle.
It’s such a gorgeous sight that Steve’s dick pulses more come into Tony, and he wonders if it would gush out of him, if the knot wasn’t there to keep it in.
It’s blue. The envelope, and probably the sheets of paper inside too. Very elegant, clearly expensive. Might have been scented, too, back then.
It’s a bit of a mess, shaving a beard this long, but Steve is patient and thorough. When he’s done, he lathers up his face again, and passes the razor on his skin in the opposite direction.
He tells Tony, who makes the same face Steve pulls when Tony talks about equations, forces, engines, particles, reactors.
Suddenly, Steve’s fingers disappear from Tony’s mouth, even though the one in his ass is still there. He feels Steve shift on the bed, so Tony opens his eyes, curious.
One morning Steve and Tony are woken up by the Avengers alarm blaring through every room of the tower. They suit up quickly, deal with the Wrecking Crew, come back home in time for lunch, debriefing included. In the afternoon, Tony runs to R&D for an important experiment with Riri, Steve has a sparring session scheduled with Natasha.
He turns his head then, Steve moving to accommodate him. Steve’s lips are stained with Tony’s blood.
Tony slows down and then stops. He rests one hand on Steve’s lower belly and bends over to kiss Steve. Then he rolls his hips, so slow and sweet that Steve—
“He passed out, and she’s—wait—yep, she fell asleep on the chair. It’s been awful, Tony. He white-knuckled it, maybe even had it worse once or twice in his messed-up life, but it’s been a fucking nightmare.”
It’s more than unsatisfying; it seems to be doing him more bad than good, but he regains a small amount of clarity. He opens his eyes and sees his sketchbook and a pen on Tony’s bedside table. He stretches over to pick them up, opens the book with shaky hands, but he can’t draw anything. He tries a few lines but he can’t even see what he’s doing; everything is trembling and imperfect.
He doesn’t know how many miles he covers, but he tries to check his watch every so often, so he can get back in two hours like he told Tony he would. He doesn’t want to be late or too early. He wants to do exactly what he said. No surprises. No mistakes. No unexpected change of plans.
“Sorry, gotta take this in private,” he mutters to Steve, who looks confused for the second it takes him to remember that where Tony is concerned glasses can be phones.
It kicks his brain into motion, and he’s already starting to devise ways to go back to how he was, which wasn’t much bigger than this but it was still better, right, when he feels Steve tentatively touching his shoulder.
The next time Steve sees Tony it’s almost four days later, and Tony has apparently spent all that time in his workshop. He emerges one morning when Steve has just got back from his run and the kitchen is still deserted, except for a sad and sweaty super soldier who’s trying to beat some world record for how much water he can drink in one sitting. This is how Steve thinks of himself now. Mostly the sad part.
“No, of course, I wanted to… I don’t know. I wanted to tell you, but I was dreading it. I was selfish, in a way, because I didn’t want to be the one who told you. But hurting you was never my intention.”
When he wakes up the next morning, Steve feels the satisfaction of a job well done and the conscious determination of a man who knows he still has a lot of work ahead of him, but is resolved to face it with tenacity and passion.
Tony looks at him for a while, at his face, and the miniscule wrinkle next to his right eye, at his long eyelashes, his pink lips, the flawless curve of his shoulder.
The words bounce inside Steve’s mind. Does he want that? Of course he wants that, he’s been wanting it for years—
Tony isn’t entirely sure Steve went soft between the first time he came and when he started fucking Tony again, and he’s not sure Steve has gone soft now at all. He only knows that Steve is moving again.
After the weekend Steve feels as if his entire world has been tilted, like something very obvious has changed even though everything more or less looks the same.
And now Steve is on top of him but his face is worried and he has no cowl and he looks different, and maybe he still wants to kill Tony, but no, maybe he only wants to wake Tony up; he’s smashing his shield into Tony’s chest, but no, no, he’s just touching him to wake him up—
Tony brushes his cheek to Steve’s. “Okay. Back to business, soldier,” he says, and there’s a grin on Steve’s face when he adjusts on his hands and knees. Tony’s heart skips a beat at the sight of him, offering himself like a gift.
Steve feels it one morning, as soon as he wakes up. He has no clue what’s different from last night, except a few hours of sleep, but he doesn’t really know how these things work. It’s complex stuff.
Knowing his own feelings doesn’t mean Tony knew Steve’s. But maybe, over the years, through death and loss and coming back to life and the end of the world… maybe, at some point, they got so wrapped up around each other that they lost the thread of themselves, and they don’t know anymore where one ends and the other starts.
Steve looks down, at his socked feet, plays with a bit of lint on the blanket. His fingers are very long. His nails are perfect, and Tony bets they’re not even manicured. His skin is so fair that his knuckles are red. His right sleeve rides up a bit on his wrist, exposing his fine blond hair. There’s dirt from the pencil on the side of his hand.
Steve wraps his arms around Tony, hugs him close but not too tight, he’s so very careful. Tony feels Steve’s warm hands on his back, how big they are. How tall Steve is. Tony reaches up, hooks his fingers in the collar of Steve’s sweater.
Steve strokes himself quickly. The sound of skin rubbing against skin is unpleasantly squalid in the tense silence that’s filling the room now. Tony just lies there staring at the ceiling and he wishes that he never existed. That he was never born.
Sex with Steve is different, of course. It’s the opposite, in fact. First of all, Tony wants it, very much so. But Steve is the real variable. He is attentive and generous; he’s a kind lover, and he takes just as much as he gives. He’s respectful but he doesn’t walk on eggshells around him—he often asks, “Is this okay?” and waits for Tony to nod, but his hands don’t tremble and his lips move sure and steady on Tony’s skin.
Steve doesn’t stop fucking Tony with his fingers, keeps sucking him off until Tony whimpers, his balls drawn tightly in. When Steve feels Tony’s cock pulse for the first time he takes it at the base, careful not to block Tony’s orgasm, and holds it in place, parting his lips. Tony’s come is hot and thick on Steve’s face and tongue, he tries to lick it up from his chin, tries to catch what’s dripping from his cheek. He wipes some of it with his thumb, then swallows that down, too. The fingers of his other hand are still buried inside Tony.
“Yeah. But he’d go out there anyway. Keeping an eye on him, it’s all you can do. You’ll be there to help if he needs it, right?”
“Tony,” Bucky says. He’s been speaking so little this whole time, and even now his voice doesn’t sound all that confident. “What you decided to do ten years ago… it was within your rights. I know it’s frowned upon, and rare, especially from the Omega, but… I’ve always thought that’s bullshit. You wanna leave someone, you’re free to do so regardless of how you present.”
He taps at his watch. Forty-five seconds, and a new armor will be here for him. It’s too long, but it’s in a damn satellite, and there’s nothing he can do about that. It’s as good as it gets for having the suit at his beck and call no matter where he is. But what if someone took him prisoner and locked him somewhere the suit can’t reach? What if…?
Steve can’t even go to him and touch him with the excuse of checking those wounds, because he is chained to a wall with a broken leg and Tony doesn’t want to be touched by him.
Steve surges forward, places his hands on Tony’s neck, looks at his face searching for an answer to his question. Tony nods once, and Steve doesn’t need anything else.
The press conference he saw on YouTube, almost a year ago now, still feels like a knife through his heart.
“Can we get out of here?” Tony asks when he feels the tears coming again, and he doesn’t even know why he’s crying right now, god, he’s such a mess, how can he hope to work with Steve, defeat the aliens, protect the world, if he starts crying when someone touches him and it feels nice? And maybe that’s not even a problem, maybe Tony won’t have anything to feel nice about in the future, so he won’t cry for that, maybe he’ll spend his last days scared and miserable and alone, like he deserves, like he’s made so many people feel for years, and then it’ll be all over, it’ll be—
After that, Steve would remove his fingers from Tony’s mouth, turn his head delicately, and kiss him. It would be sweet but demanding, and Tony would get lost in it, in the sensation of Steve’s beard brushing against his, in the taste of blue roses on his tongue. He’d come all over the mirror.
“It must be. After Siberia, I closed the bond off to him,” Tony says, and he has a distinct impression that Bucky and Natasha both already knew this. He ignores it. “Guess that’s when he realized I wouldn’t take him back. And why his ruts got so bad.”
That night, while he keeps tossing and turning in his bed counting sheep, Steve realizes that he not only has never kissed Tony, but he has also never touched his dick.
Inside, there’s a couch with a coffee table and television set in a corner, a small kitchen with a table on the other. There are books on the shelves built into a recess in the wall, next to Tony’s great-grandmother’s credenza. An arch leads to a tiny hallway, with two doors: the laundry and the bedroom. The bed is huge, and the door that leads to the ensuite bathroom is engraved with flowers. There’s a French window too, to access the backyard. Tony can see the oak tree outside casting an inviting shade on the grass.
Not just on the surface, like when he bathes with Tony. No, he’s warm deep inside, to the bone. His arms and legs are all pins and needles with it, and he feels the urge to take off his thick sweatpants, his socks, even the hoodie.
They must be still close to Milan, since the airport is north-west of the city. But there’s almost no traffic here. Tony is taking side roads, avoiding the highway.
“Well, I sure don’t want that,” Stella deadpans, pointing at herself, “never wanted that in my life.
“No,” Tony replies, and he doesn’t miss the way Steve stills, completely, immediately, for as long as Tony doesn’t speak. “I want you, I just… nevermind, it hardly matters now,” he finishes, because this isn’t the time to interrupt or explain.
Steve rolls over onto him. He checks that he’s open and wet with his fingers, then enters him while licking Tony’s slick from his hand.
Something deep in Steve’s lower belly shatters, releases a spike of energy that rushes through him like an electric current, makes him shiver. Tony doesn’t stop thrusting, smears Steve’s come on his abs, rubs it up to his chest and
Tony is there a moment later, calls from the hallway, “Uhm—” because he’s not saying Steve’s name, he has never said Steve’s name this whole time, and Steve can’t even remember the last time he heard Tony’s voice say his name—Tony’s tongue catching a bit behind his teeth, making the S awkward, a fraction of a second longer than it should be. A flaw.
They search through the pictures in the box, and the conversation turns inevitably to Laura. The way Stella talks about her, you wouldn’t say she’s dead. It’s like she was here just yesterday, like she’ll be here again tomorrow.
Tony moves on top of him, fast and the exact opposite of careful. He takes it too deep, squeezes his eyes shut, but his mouth is slack with pleasure and his breath hot on Steve’s face.
“Yeah. It’s... I don’t know. We’re working on it. There are rough patches. This whole thing… it messed him up, Sam.
“I hadn’t met Laura yet, back then. I had had a few relationships, I wasn’t… I had let Maria go. I loved her as a friend. But seeing her that day, seeing how scared she was, seeing you, how much she loved you… I asked her to leave with me, begged her. We didn’t have to get back together, I just wanted to keep her, and you, safe.”
And in a way, sure, he’s better than he was those first weeks. He’s functional now, he’s not just a rag doll thrown on an armchair and left there to collect dust.
And yeah, Tony’s head is definitely gonna explode. He puts a hand on his chest, over the arc reactor, and starts rubbing at it, loosens his tie with his other hand, undoes the first three buttons of his shirt. He walks over to Steve’s desk, takes his jacket off and carefully drapes it over the chair, then does the same with the vest. He goes back to sit on the bed, resumes rubbing at his chest.
, and for a moment he wonders if he’s not actually part of an entirely different species because honestly,
He sucks in a breath, startled by Tony’s voice. Guilt seeps into him, insidious and virulent as an illness. His heart thunders in his chest. He tries to look at Tony’s face, but it’s even worse than looking at his hip.
His heart stutters in his chest, and he sucks in a breath, so sharply it almost catches in his throat and makes him cough.
“Mh. Not yet,” Tony says, and he walks over to the couch, crouches down in front of it, and pushes his face in the neck of one of cats. She lets him as if he was one of them. Steve comes over, pets them goodbye too.
Tony leaves. He throws his pillow on the couch, then lies down on it, face turned against the backrest. He’s not hard anymore and he feels like crying again.
Poor, delusional bastard. Steve almost pities him, as well as all the others. They really think they’re doing something. They really think they can hurt Steve.
She enters the room but doesn’t shut the door behind herself. She leaves it ajar, just a bit. Steve frowns at that, because it doesn’t seem like Riri. She’s always so private, especially with her relationship with Steve, especially since Tony died. He can’t imagine her being okay with someone passing through the corridor and hearing whatever she has to say to him.
“No, my peak-of-human-perfection ass was frozen in 2008. And I’m still sure you weren’t a sleazebag.”
Steve helps him step into his pants. Buttoning them up the other way around isn’t as tricky for Steve as it’d be for anyone else, but for a few seconds his body is flushed against Tony’s, the skin of his forearms pressing into Tony’s belly. Steve is still wearing that strange cardigan of his, open at the front, sleeves rolled up, so thick that it makes his shoulders seem even larger. Tony stares up at him and feels small, what with the way Steve is towering over him, but the sensation isn’t accompanied by envy and inadequacy and discomfort. It’s just how it is.
He closes his eyes for a moment, and when he opens them again Steve is the one with his back on the blanket, while Tony straddles his thighs. He must’ve taken one leg out of his boxers when Steve wasn’t looking, because they’re sliding over one thigh, down and down towards his knee the more he moves and shifts.
The rest of the morning passes in comfortable silence. After lunch, they bring the dry clothes inside and finish packing, and soon it’s time to leave.
Tony tosses the StarkPad on the couch, and stumbles to the bathroom to wash the tears away from his face.
“There’s an Italian version of the book. It’s old and out of print, and I didn’t have the time to track down a copy, but I know that it’s different from the one published in the States. Maybe it’s about this, maybe not. I’m here to find out.”
They drive for about five minutes, and arrive in a place called Abbadia a Isola, where there are maybe fifteen buildings in total, and no one in sight. There’s a bar, a gas station, a few houses, and then, there’s a church.
Tony gasps, but no air makes it to his lungs, and his heart is a moment away from exploding in his chest.
“Just surprised,” Steve repeats, slowly, as if he needs to do that to really understand what Tony means.
“Yeah,” Tony says, and he knows he’s about to cry. If Steve doesn’t do anything in the next three seconds, Tony’s going to—
“And if you decide that you can’t… forgive what I did, I’ll understand. I’ll accept it and leave you alone. But until then, I’ll fight tooth and nail for you.”
He’s about to say something to keep Tony awake, even if he feels like an asshole for doing it, when Tony sits up suddenly, yawns, and presses his hands to his face.
(which, honestly, what the fuck), against a table in Tony’s workshop right after a mission with Steve still in his uniform and Tony still in most of his armor, one night against the fridge in the communal kitchen (which isn’t just fucked up but also very possibly unsanitary, and Steve feels so bad afterwards that he stress-cleans the whole room after Tony leaves), and the list goes on.
It’s not a very Alpha thing to do, traditionally. It’s considered somewhat wrong. It’s supposed to be the other way around and
Tony walks away from Steve to talk in private. He sees him laugh a few times, explain something that looks complicated from the way he’s gesticulating. He comes back to sit next to Steve while he says, “Alright, kid. Be careful out there.”
“Tony, listen. There’s a line between liking it rough and being self-destructive. I know you can handle rough. I’m not holding myself back, not like before, I swear. But I’m not too keen on breaking your hips. Alright?”
She is short and very thin. She is wearing a simple white dress with beige sandals. Her glasses hang on a pink lanyard draped around her neck. She has an apron on, and she’s wiping her hands on it.
He washes his face with warm water, then wets the brush and rubs it on the soap, lathering it up properly. He covers his beard with it.
He looks at Steve, his fair skin, his blue eyes, the gold of his hair, the way it all shines against his dark clothes. His stare makes Steve stop in his tracks, look back, eyes wide.
“He had made a couple of, how can I say, worrying comments… about taking you away from her. I guess at some point he realized he had a son he could use as leverage. Maria had money, sure, but your father was powerful, and had political connections. As vague as his threats were, they scared Maria enough to stay.” Stella pauses, seems to carefully consider her next words. “She stayed for you, and she never regretted that.”
Tony glances at Steve. He seems to be thinking about something, but Tony’s gaze shifts his attention. He smiles at Tony.
There’s a love life that Steve dreams of, but doesn’t have. He has bits and pieces of it, but not the full picture. And this is the only way Steve can find to cope with the fact that he can’t have what he wants, and yet he still feels guilty about this, like these pages are some ugly part of him screaming that Tony isn’t enough, which is not true. Tony is everything to him. He’s his best friend.
But the arc reactor sometimes sits heavy in his chest. After battles he doesn’t bounce back quite as fast. Bruises take more time to heal. He had to put extra neck support in the Iron Man suit, and he can’t eat whatever he wants to anymore. Does Tony Stark want an orange? Well then, Tony Stark had better be ready to deal with the heartburn that orange will give him for the next five fucking hours.
He takes a pot from one of the cabinets, fills it with water, and puts it on the stove. From another cabinet he takes a box of spaghetti.
“I almost had you. Almost. I tasted you just once,” Steve chokes out, and Tony doesn’t know how much of it is a metaphor and how much of it is unrestrained, carnal desire, the simplest pornography.
“Okay, it’s just that… you never talked about it before, so I thought we weren’t supposed to talk about it, and…”
“Okay, so, you know the bonds parents have in their heads?” Tony starts, and he waits for Sarah to nod. Then he continues, “The bond is like a garden. You have to take care of it. If the parents do that, the flowers are all beautiful, and they all smell great.”
He’d dress up for the occasion, maybe even shave. He’d get them a nice present. He’d kiss Pepper’s cheek and tell her she looks beautiful. He would squeeze her tiny, elegant hand, and envy every inch of her skin, but he wouldn’t let any of that show on his face. His smile would be sincere, open. She’d thank him for coming.
Oh, so that’s why Tony is upset. The big I’m-buying-this-whole-grocery-store-chain-in-particular-because-I-saved-a-nine-year-old-girl-from-a-burning-building-once-and-she-told-me-she-was-alone-at-night-because-her-mom-was-working-shitty-hours-so-they-could-afford-food-and-I-just-couldn’t-fucking-stand-it business.
Then, it happens. Steve’s scent changes into something different, and there it is, the tell. It begins to hurt. Only a little at first, just a mild burn when Steve fucks back in, but then it grows into a fire, Tony’s rim catching at the swelling knot, Steve’s cock struggling to keep going in and out of him. Flesh fighting flesh.
, went to Carol and told her he wanted to leave the team, asked advice on how to break it to Steve. Carol wasn’t thrilled by his existential crisis so he agreed to stay on, but how exactly is he supposed to deal with Riri telling him he’s still her “favorite grandpa” when it doesn’t sound as much of a joke as it did five years ago?
Nothing, in their entire relationship, has mattered more than what Steve is going to say next, and he knows this like he knows his own name.
“I appreciate it, but I’m not a baby, dunno if you noticed. I don’t need to be protected. Especially if you’re gonna fuck other people over while you do it.”
He looks up into Steve’s face, and he’s still sleeping, but Tony’s movements make him open his eyes.
“It’s an amazing coincidence, isn’t it,” he says, “that Mom would love this song and that you’d choose it for her without even knowing.”
He braces with his free hand on the sink. He tightens his grip on himself, flicks his wrist. The bracelet scrapes against his abdomen. It doesn’t matter.
“Oh, Tony,” he says, and it’s torn off of him with a violence of which Tony can’t see the origin, or understand the reason.
They enter the chapel, and Tony hears Steve mutter, “It’s cylindrical! I’ll be damned,” his tone a mix between awed and excited.
There is no difference between memories and dreams in this strange world Steve inhabits for a splendid moment. Things that happened six years ago and things that will never happen except in Steve’s deepest fantasies have the same color, the same vivid quality. Facts and wishes. The past, and a future that will never, ever exist.
"Jarvis, please, go get your head?" Steve asked the floating hand. He paused. "Wait, can you go get Tony's other heart? Um...raise your index finger for yes?" He looked at Tony, cringing.
Tony paused just over the mansion, watching the shield flare brightly every moment or two. If the cards would work he could figure out what was going on in there.
"Hey guys, you don't think the Hulk's gonna get loose again today, do ya?" Spider-Man interrupted the two, closing the garage door. He hopped up and perched on the seat of Logan's bike, glancing between the two of them. "Think he's the one who knocked the power out?"
"Wade, right?" He asked pleasantly, out of the blue. "Looks like you didn't find my firewood stash. C'mon, let's grab some." He waved for Wade to follow him.
Or to huddle for warmth...Clint would be more appealing to huddle with than a soggy newspaper, that was for sure. Bruce didn't say that part aloud, though.
"Yep, that's either the Hulk or Godzilla they're running from," Spider-Man told himself. He had a habit of talking to himself when he was in the suit, primarily because he worked alone so much that there really wasn't anybody else to talk to.
"Are the sandwich makers good? Can they make sandwiches in the dark?" A power outage wasn't the end of the world...at the moment, he was more concerned with getting the famed sandwiches that Clint had dragged them over half the city for more than anything else.
"Titanium would still not pierce my skin," Thor said, leaning to look at the needle thoughtfully. "...I pray that you must never draw a sample from me, friend."
“Hey,” Clint said more gently, “I’m sorry you don’t get to come out much. You probably get bored sitting around in Hulk’s head all the time.”
"So how'd you two meet? You sure don't look like you go to his high school," he said pointedly to Wade.
"Thanks?" Tony arched a brow as he took the cup, smiling at the blond. Clint had been sitting with Bruce up until now, but the scientist had moved over to sit by Cap and Peter. Had he gotten bored that quick? Speaking softly so that the others wouldn't overhear, he commented, "You seem like you're a lot more excited about a vacation than you were when we first got here. I noticed you and Bruce spending half the day together--probably related, huh?" Tony took a tiny test sip from the cup, and wow that was a lot of tequila...
Scooting closer to peek under the edge of the kayak, Steve braced himself. Of course, they had to argue.
The scientist mumbled something under his breath about blood samples and slowly got to his feet, starting for the couch. He didn't ask for any assistance from Johnny, even though leaning on somebody sounded useful right now. After the Hulk had shown up twice in one day, one couldn't be too cautious...especially without the other Avengers around to help contain him.
“I’m sorry, but we need to go back inside. If anyone spots us out here with YOU,” Cap gestured to Daredevil, “the jig’s up.”
Giving up on scraping the burnt marshmallow off the stick, Peter dropped it beside him and turned to hug Wade sideways.
Peter's spider sense tingled seconds before something human shaped and on fire slammed right into him as he rounded a corner.
"Well, the shield didn't go out along with the power, so I thought I'd check up on you. What are you doing all the way over here?" The blond woman paused to hover near him, looking around at the flooding river below.
Spotting Tony near the campfire that Clint was erecting, Cap wished he could just walk up and take him in his arms.
Peter had been worrying about Cap and Tony without even taking himself into account. Oh, no, were they just getting along this well even for his sake?
"Huh? Yeah." Clint nodded, his face flushed. "Just spacing out." He shrugged, looking anywhere other than Bruce.
“Can you imagine Hulk being stuck in a tiny snow cabin? No, at least this way he has an ocean to splash around in.”
He sighted a very disheveled-looking Bruce Banner, dressed in what looked like pajamas, stepping over to pile another blanket around Clint's shoulders. Both of them had damp hair, like they had just been out in the weather, but Dr. Banner didn't seem to have caught the chill that Clint had.
"Is it done?" Maybe he could slip outside while the scientist was distracted. Sliding quietly off of the medical bed, he sneaked toward the door.
"You don't know?" Steve asked. He was a little shocked, but then again, it wasn't like his friend had slept recently either.
“Ever since I woke up, I started learning about the new world and what issues people are worried about today. Things have definitely changed, but I’m learning.” He gestured after Tony and stood. “Excuse me, Peter. I’m sorry, but I really need to talk to Tony.”
“You’re right, it isn’t safe for them,” Tony replied dryly, sitting the coffee pot into place and turning to poke at the firewood. Thor was looking after Clint thoughtfully, but knelt down and grabbed a piece of firewood, cracking it into shards with his bare hands.
“Thanks, Clint. I wish he was kidding about the wood chipper, but he’s probably not.” Stepping just inside the cave door, he pulled his phone out of his backpack and tried dialing somebody. Tony, probably. He must have been worried to try it outside in the rain. “…Aww, c’mon. No reception again?”
“Banner found that odd as well.” Thor had hurried over in the time Steve was looking away—he was right in front of them now, gesturing to the fancy campsite. “He claims that he has never even seen another camper in this location. That’s why it is his favorite.”
Without waiting for a reply, he rocketed past her toward the mansion. The shield was based on Stark tech, so it would probably hold for a few minutes.
Acting like dating him was some horrible thing to hide from the Avengers probably wasn’t helping with THAT any. Hiding that but not Matt and Peter really wasn’t fair, but that had sort of been an accident, too.
"Enjoy." He took a long drink from his coffee and examined one of the papers he was half sitting on.
“If there are four beds in each cabin, where is Peter going to sleep? If T’challa, Thor, Pym and Jan are in the other cabin, and Bruce, Clint, you and I are here—where’s Peter going to sleep?”
“They’re up the mountain looking for YOU,” Tony grumbled, waving a hand at him. “Never mind. You guys should change into some dry clothes.” He started over toward Steve, shaking his head.
"Johnny, how're things?" Peter tossed a little two-fingered salute at the Human Torch and grinned behind his mask. Johnny Storm was the youngest member of the Fantastic Four, and one of the few heroes he related this well to. Of course, Johnny was also his polar opposite in society—a girl magnet with a devil-may-care attitude, cool hair and a huge horde of fans. That sounded kinda nice...
Cap and Tony looked bedraggled, Peter noted with worry. Cap was missing the shirt he’d been wearing over his tank top, and Tony’s hair had a lot more curl to it after the rain washed every last bit of gel out. Neither of them looked miserable, though, and that was a good sign. In fact, they were both smiling.
Wetting a piece of gauze, he scooted a bit closer and started to peel off Clint’s hasty field bandage that he’d slapped on to slow the bleeding before.
Setting up tents always reminded Cap of his time back in the army, before his super strength or the very pleasant company of Tony Stark.
“Uh, about that,” Peter said sheepishly. Jeez, they really were getting along better now, especially for guys who had just been through a ridiculous storm and barely made it back to shore in one piece! Peter hadn’t actually intended for the plan to get to the kayak race before everybody fessed up.
Cap had to wonder, too. All of these powerful people with grudge matches were as frustrating as they were dangerous. It was kind of scary to think that Tony could have been like them if he didn't have SOME sort of conscience and desire to help people in trouble.
“I will gladly take first watch,” Thor volunteered, picking up Mjolnir. He frowned. “Hulk, what happened to Banner? When I brought him to the trail he was himself.”
“…Private audience,” Thor was telling Tony, looking bemused. Both of them turned quickly when Steve arrived. “Captain, Stark tells me that you both wish to speak with me alone. You can’t possibly believe that Banner would tell anyone your secrets?” He chuckled and gestured to Bruce, who had gone right back to skipping stones when Steve left. “I assure you, he guards secrets very well.”
Thor blinked and removed his hand from the other blond's back, looking a little concerned. He glanced over at Tony—and Bruce, who hadn't said anything so neither of them had noticed him standing there a step behind the black-haired man.
"Yeah, I should probably shave soon," he said quietly, turning and digging in the briefcase again. The other man watched him intently, raising an eyebrow.
"I don't want you to go away." Again he playfully nudged the thin man's shoulder, giving him a smile. "Maybe you can be my buddy too. My fishing buddy."
“I didn’t know Thor knew how to fish,” Peter mused. “Dr. Banner said this was a great camping spot, and that’s why Wade and I decided to camp here. I’ll bet he knows some great fishing spots, too.”
Leaving them to their plans, Cap went back to making waffles. It was beginning to feel like he was working in a restaurant. Too bad he didn’t have his Identicard to call everyone over to eat.
"Dark never bothered me," the Hulk declared gruffly and then did exactly what Loki had been fearing. He reached out and scooped the blonde up from the floor—surprisingly, being careful not to grab near the bleeding arrow wound.
"Bruce, maybe you should go c-check on him. He's alone down there. Actually," the large blond moved back toward the door. "I'll go. You go get Miss Pots—she's still outside."
Hulk grumbled something under his breath, glancing back at the camp. Peter had moved back over to stand with Matt and Wade, talking to them and waving a hand around. Tony was standing near Steve, looking like he could really use a drink, and Thor was dutifully marching down to the lake to keep an eye on Loki’s camp.
"He actually looks like he's having a good time. We should leave him be for awhile," he suggested. "And I should go find some clothes, anyway. I'm probably already sunburned from walking around like this." He sighed wearily. "Uh, by the way, I hope you don't mind if I exaggerated to Cap with the 'over-the-top flirting' talk. Some things we did yesterday would probably count as flirting. Maybe. I don't know, I haven't dated in a really long time."
"Thinking I'm gonna die just made him HONEST with me, th-that's all. So ya see...h-he'd pick me over you any day."
“Dude, you’re…” Wade trailed off, staring at Steve with big shiny blue eyes. “You’re the coolest dad ever!”
As tempted as he was to hold Tony’s hand, Cap resisted. In a moment or two they’d be down on the shore with both Thor and Bruce, though. When else?
"Listen, last night I-I stretched the truth a bit," he said guiltily. "I don't have a boyfriend, I have..." Oh, it sounded so pathetic, so high school, but he had to admit it. "I have this guy I like, who seems to like me, but we're not actually dating. Yet."
Was it daylight yet? Captain America felt like he'd been sitting in the cell forever. He had awakened to find that the car and tunnel were gone, and he was in some kind of dungeon-like cell. Worse yet, somebody knew who they were going to be capturing, because the shackles chaining his wrists to the wall had resisted being snapped pretty well so far.
He offered a gauntlet-covered hand. "Aid me in luring Thor, and I shall see to it that his comrades rescue you and take you into their fold."
"This...is not...one of my arrows." He looked accusingly up at Hawkeye, who had returned to the edge of the couch with a needle in hand.
The previews started on the TV, showing trailers for some pretty silly movies. In the lineup was 'The Hand that Crawled,' 'Attack of the Sharkgods' and 'Zombies Arr Pirates 2.'
"Oww! Okay, can we stop with the fastball specials?" Tony was holding the frisbee and rubbing his face. He recovered from that really quick, though, handing the frisbee to Peter again. "Get 'em, kid."
"Why? Because Bruce is a lot easier to control than the Hulk, so if somebody wanted to capture him, they'd need him to be Bruce," Tony said. He crossed his arms, looking at the scientist's door. "What I don't understand is why he didn't just leave with him when they headed out last night."
"I'm sick, he got me a pizza—what do you want?" Clint all but growled at Tony, rattling from the draft that came in the door.
He...was he talking about Cap's cooking ability being hot? Peter didn't know how to feel about that one, so he settled for shooting the blond a weird look.
“Shh! We gotta talk. Come on.” Clint waved for the kid to follow him and took a few steps back down the hallway, hoping that he’d get the idea.
"The whole building's going up, can you move?" He said to the person, coughing from the smoke as he came closer. It was odd to be coughing, but he didn’t have time to think about it.
"Good luck." Steve couldn’t help worrying for her. It felt like the whole team had been spread out across the city. He could count maybe once in the last four days that he had seen the entire team together.
"Who are we kidding?" Bruce muttered to himself, stepping over toward the table. Like anything could really hurt him or the other guy, anyway.
"Well?" Bruce watched Tony carefully. He kept a hand on Clint's shoulder protectively, suspecting Iron Man might just shoot whoever turned out to be the impostor on sight.
"You think so?" Bruce sounded a bit surprised. "I guess he's Captain America, who doesn't think so..." He shifted on his feet slightly, shoulders slumping. "The team has a lot of good-looking people. Tony isn't exactly hideous, himself."
A hasty pair of shoes and socks later, and Tony was making a beeline for the tent door, deciding not to even attempt to style his hair.
"Have I missed the cursed shark beings that think themselves gods?!" Thor sat down beside Clint and handed him the bowl since he was in the middle of the couch.
With a shriek of rage, the enchantress turned on Loki again—lifting him up by the shirt. Blasting a huge hole in the wall, she jumped outside.
"Um, yes—yes, I hope she's alright." Steve plunked Tony onto a table. "I think I'll go find her, actually." Making a 180 on the spot, he headed out the door.
“Peter!” Matt hurried his way, reaching his hands out toward Peter. The alarm on Cap’s face as Matt managed to pass the campfire safely was priceless.
The first thing she saw was a blonde man strapped to a table by his wrists and ankles, his bloodied shirt pushed up to reveal a stitched-up wound. The table was a little bloody, too, and there were some medical supplies and needles scattered on the floor near it.
Clint felt like he knew Hulk pretty well. It was Bruce that had been a mystery to him. How’d he get a crush on a guy that he only saw a couple days a month? That was so stupid.
“Oh sure,” Matt told him, smiling easily. “It’s just a lot to process. The pressure in the air, the humidity, the damn…” The redhead paused as gust of wind slapped warm rain in their faces before continuing, “the lightning. I like rain. Usually. It actually helps me visualize better. But this combination is a lot to process all at once.” He laughed, and Peter could tell he was uncomfortable about the subject as his smile faded. “Silly me for leaving my walking stick up in the cabin, I suppose.”
“Yeah, lying’s never been my strong suit,” he said, swishing the last of the coffee in the cup. “Nobody else gets it, either. All I can tell you is that Wade looks different when you’re looking at him with love.”
"Yeah. I know," the Hulk said flatly, closing his eyes. He quickly shrank back down to Bruce—and slumped to the floor.
“My intentions,” Matt echoed, examining a pair of jeans before standing back up to face Steve. The redhead just chuckled.
Even if he couldn’t get a date this week, it’d be nice to hang out with Bruce and get to know the guy better. Clint turned his head, watching the water dripping from his friend.
Noticing Cap, Peter turned sad brown eyes on him, but didn't exactly confirm that there was trouble. He actually looked kind of guilty, probably from the redhead suggesting HE was being the irresponsible person here.
"I… He should be fine by now—we sent Jarvis to get his backup reactor." He wasn't wheezing or coughing anymore. Maybe he really was cured. "And I came to find you. We found out who the real Hawkeye is and which ones were fake."
"Hey, I think our flag delivery got delayed," Tony joked from down the stairs. Peter glanced back at him and waved with a slightly too-large smile.
"Sorry." Loki sat quietly while the scientist did his scan. After a moment he looked back up to Bruce, trying to calculate the angle his face had to be at so that the light would best catch the blue in his eyes. "I bet I can tell you something he can't."
Wait a minute. Clint’s tired brain drew on the sip of coffee and managed to come up with a single answer.
Sighing again, the Jotun came over to his side, leaning to peek around Bruce and see what he was doing.
The scientist blinked at him worriedly as some loud movie trailer began to blare from the TV. He was joking, right? If they woke the Hulk up ONE more time when he was supposed to be sleeping, Bruce was worried that Clint would end up a fine paste on the kitchen floor.
Casting a nervous glance at the other two, Wade bravely started peeling the onion, psyching himself up.
Clint could relate. He’d been cooped up in the damn medical ward for days at a time. It was painfully boring.
“We trust you to make your own choices, Peter,” Cap said as he moved closer to rest a hand on the dark-haired man’s back, giving Tony a pointed look before he continued. “I’m glad you have someone you can talk to. There’s certainly something to be said for having trustworthy allies."
Bruce blinked at him, not laughing at all in response. He wrapped an arm around Clint in return and rather clumsily rubbed his back. His hand was freezing cold.
"Look, I don't know if Bruce being alone with, um, us, is a good idea. I mean hey—what if we're both brain-eating robot aliens?" He shrugged even though Thor couldn't see it. "Did you guys check out the Baxter Building? Are they just gone or...?"
“Tony and I are together. I’m not sure how that’s seen on Asgard, but I hope it doesn’t make you uncomfortable. We are still the leaders of the Avengers and that isn’t going to change.”
"Sir, Dr. Banner says that the cure has been completed, and that you should now disconnect the power," JARVIS said drolly. "I do hope you're still conscious."
"Uh huh," Clint said vaguely, staring Bruce in the eye. He seemed distracted, his eyes drifting down to Bruce’s nose.
“Could you tell Cap? I don’t wanna get the whole ‘endangering the team’ speech again.” Popping open another soda, Clint added it to both his and Tony’s drinks.
Raising shining blue eyes to meet Tony’s gaze, Cap seemed completely steady as he stated “I love you, Tony.”
Bruce had sat up quickly at the cry of pain from Loki, snapping an arm out to grab his shoulder, maybe to try to pull him out of the other Clint's reach. Now, as the two paused in their tussle, they saw that the scientist's eyes were an alarming green, and that he was clutching his head.
For awhile he’d had a slim hope that Thor would come gliding out of the sky to save them, but even that seemed unlikely. Thor was probably off with his new lady friend. Rising to his feet, Steve offered a hand up to Tony.
Then something soft and warm was draped over the captain’s shoulders. A blanket, he realized, opening his eyes and blinking at it. Tony feigned indifference as he walked away to go back to the mini bar in the corner. Maybe he'd bring back water.
“I could have just killed someone, Clint. I think I’m done with the bow and arrows for tonight,” he muttered.
"What is it?" The scientist asked, trying to breathe evenly and get rid of that racing pulse as quickly as he could.
Jan was mischievous when bored, so there was a chance she’d do something with the box…if she knew it was theirs. Knowing her, if she found a box behind the couch, she’d assume it was treasure and show it to everyone.
"We've also noticed that they both stop fighting and team up whenever they're focused on you," Bruce told Peter. "That's bad if they can constantly avoid their problems by distracting themselves, but it might help us here, too."
“Is the whole team going to be fishing, or do we have some lake group activities in mind?” Tony asked Cap pointedly. Clint looked like he was about to throw something. He had never had anything positive to say about Bruce’s fishing, and Tony had always assumed that meant Bruce was actually really bad at it.
“The heat wave is expected to continue late into next week,” the woman on the screen told him, smiling brightly. “Up next, the latest news on the Avengers scandal—”
Bruce was pretty sure Clint was only holding the vest over their heads for his benefit. He was sure a seasoned spy and assassin could handle some rain.
Not that many superheroes got married or settled down. The few exceptions were just that—exceptions.
Deadpool pressed back against him, hands resting easily on his chest. Peter could almost hear the smirk in his voice.
“What the hell do you want?” Came the short growl from Hawkeye as he came stomping into the situation room, Hulk in tow.
He made a show of leading Matt over to sit by the campfire, sighing. As long as Cap and Tony thought that Matt was a regular civilian, he had to pretend he couldn’t get around without his walking stick.
For a minute, the captain completely forgot that he outweighed Tony as he reached up and took the hands offered to him, leaning to stand up.
“Well, how many models do YOU know?” Steve joked, heading inside. The living room area of the cabin was empty. Everyone must have finally settled in to do their own thing.
"I know," She sighed. "We're waiting on Thor. He should be here soon. I don't know what set the Hulk off," She wondered, staring down at the scene of chaos below them. "Lately, he's been so well behaved."
Something scraped across the roof. It sounded like a branch had landed on top of the house. It must be windy too.
“Whoa, are you okay?” Peter hurried back to get a closer look at the blond’s arm. Unslinging the backpack from his shoulder, he immediately began to rummage in it. “Hang on, I’ve got a first aid kit right here…”
"Right." Cap took the cure from Clint instead, removing the needle. "Does it h-have to be inj-jected?"
"I think we're lost." Bruce glanced up and down the beach. "Maybe we should write SOS in the sand with a stick," he suggested, deadpan.
"Frightened? At last you realize the gravity of your situation." Clint would have laughed again, but he found his chin abruptly captured in a VERY firm metal grip. Doom turned the blonde's face sideways to look toward him and added ominously, "You do not ask the questions here, DOOM asks them! What do you know of Thor?"
Grabbing his backpack and the first aid kit, Peter hurried after them. For a second he’d thought Clint was messing with him, but the guy seemed pretty serious about this. What kind of monster could be in the lake?
"I feel for you," Bruce said, and looked like he really meant it. "But you're staying tied up until Hawkeye's back."
"Sit," Doom said, practically pushing him into one of the chairs. He promptly turned in a swoosh of green cloak and headed back the way they had come.
Both the others looked at him. Hawkeye seemed to be debating if he should say something or not, while Loki was just smirking to himself.
Steve stepped away for a moment and returned with a fat first aid kit, raking it open and pulling out a bunch of stuff. Snagging Clint’s arm around, he poured what felt like acid into the wound.
