“Yeah, one of my best friends, actually. We even dated for a hot second a few years ago. It didn’t work out, but, well.” Dean shrugs, eating the last fry off of Cas’ plate. “We had fun, and we stayed friends.” He wipes his hands off on a napkin and reaches into his pocket for his wallet. “Okay, let’s head to the thrift store after this, get you some clothes that aren’t mine. Maybe a cheap phone, too. That way when I’m at work tomorrow, you can still get in touch with me if you need to, or go out and do… whatever.”
Two bright spots of color appear high on Sam’s cheeks and god, his whole body is shaking with righteous anger now. “Then it’s a good thing I’m not fucking using it, isn’t it?” he retorts. “Every morning I wake up and the first thing I think about is popping a pill. Every morning, Dean. Chasing that high -- it’s what every junkie wants. But every morning I make the conscious goddamn decision to get up and do something else with my life. When I was using, it may have started because I needed a quick fix for my magic, a quick power up, but it stopped being about that pretty fast. Then it just became about the high. And you
Cas shudders out one more breath before straightening his shoulders, seeming to shake off whatever anxiety and fear he’d been dealing with. “Thanks, Dean. I’m sorry to have put all of that on you just now. You’re probably tired.”
“You can’t tell me I’m wrong about this. You needed to get away for a bit before you burned out.”
Cas nods, like he’s filing away that information for another time. “I can see how that would be the case. You like to work directly with people and help them. Being able to train that way is more beneficial for both you and your patients. No wonder you’re so skilled at your job.”
Fuck, he should’ve looked for a makeshift weapon or something to defend himself. Why are there no convenient two-by-fours laying around in this alley? Aren’t all alleys supposed to have convenient two-by-fours laying around in them? He could’ve sworn that was part of city building code. Sucking in a breath, Dean makes a fist around his keys in his pocket, steeling himself to go for the eyes if he has to. It’s the best he can come up with.
Cas has taken to the ocean like, well, a fish to water. Dean’s never seen him so comfortable before; even in their apartment, Cas sometimes moves stiffly, like he’s not quite used to it. But here, walking across the sand while the ocean moves and splashes in the background, Cas seems truly in his element.
Also, it doesn’t hurt that Cas is back from Heaven and hanging around, doing his own research. “The angels aren’t being particularly helpful,” he’d grumbled when Sam and Dean had (finally) gotten back. “But they haven’t barred me from going back to see what I can find. I’m looking through everything here to see if there’s anything that can help me narrow down the search.”
, like he hasn’t spent hours sprawled out in a t-shirt and sweatpants, watching bad TV with his head in Dean’s lap. Like he doesn’t want to be here now, facing Dean for the first time in over two months. Like this is something he
“No promises,” Dean tries to joke. “See you later, man.”
“Well,” he says, snapping off his disposable gloves, “I don’t exactly have a baseline test to compare you against, but follow my finger with your eyes, okay? Don’t turn your head at all, just your eyes.”
Dean turns around so fast he nearly gives himself whiplash. Cas is standing there, trenchcoat and all, whole and radiant and so fucking real that Dean almost trips as he stumbles across the ground to wrap him in a hug.
Dean blinks in surprise. “Wait, really?”
“Eileen?” he asks, his voice sleep-rough to his own ears. “Wh--”
? It looks like you tried to shove a bolt of lightning into this machine -- whatever magic you shot through here, your body isn’t capable of handling that sort of power!”
, he thinks, thoughts a little hazy through the bright pain. His knee feels like there are several knives embedded in it. “Ow,” he says.
Dean grins, opening the car door for Cas. “And don’t you forget it,” he winks.
Dean stumbles and falls back when he hits the mattress, landing with a soft
“What’s that supposed to mean?!”
The next few days follow that pattern: beach, food, sex, and not much else. Freckles pop up all over Dean’s arms, face, and chest no matter how much sunscreen he wears, and Cas spends hours one night just holding Dean down and kissing every one he can find. It’s the sweetest torture Dean’s ever had to endure as he shakes apart underneath Cas’ hands and mouth.
Cas positions himself slightly in front of Dean, still holding his hand. “I’m sorry, do I know you?” he asks, tone polite, and Dean gapes at him, because
The med kit snaps shut louder than Dean expected, and Castiel returns to alertness with another start. “Ah, sorry,” Dean mumbles, using the arm of the couch as leverage to get up off the ground, wincing as his knees pop a bit. “Just let me get you some spare clothes, and you can sleep here, okay? I’m also beat, so we’ll figure out next steps after some rest.”
“You got it,” she promises, and turns to the various machines in the room to start turning them off and wheeling them away. Her movements are confident and precise, but Dean lingers for a moment anyway. Just in case. These kinds of nights aren’t easy, not for anyone.
The two nurses, both of whom Dean’s had a couple of shifts with, ignore him. Cas, strangely, helps them lift Dean onto the stretcher -- actually, he lifts Dean nearly single handedly, which under normal circumstances would have Dean melting on the spot, but instead he just glares sullenly at his friend-turned-traitor.
Castiel looks at him expectantly. “Uh,” Dean fumbles, depositing the misshapen pancake on the plate, “I’m not really… sure. Don’t really have any myself. ‘S why I’m a nurse. Don’t need magic when you’ve got science.” He chuckles lightly, scrambling a bunch of eggs in a bowl and dumping them into a clean pan. “My brother Sam might have a better answer for you, though. He’s an apprentice to Rowena MacLeod. Got magic coming out his fingertips, or at least that’s what it seems. I can probably introduce you to him tomorrow, if you’re feeling up to it. Alright, dig in!” He deposits all the food on the table and sits down across from Castiel, grabbing a plate and forking several pancakes onto it.
“This sounds like a conversation for outside my office,” Rowena interrupts, clapping her hands together abruptly. “I have a potential client coming in soon that we need to prepare for, Samuel. You know, someone who might actually give us money for my magic.”
“It ain’t summertime without a trip to the lake,” Dean declares, parking the Impala. “What do you think about a cookout for dinner? I packed stuff to make hamburgers. And beer.”
“You’re not overstaying anything,” Dean interrupts. “Seriously, I’m more than happy to keep helping, I promise. I ain’t gonna stop you if you want to leave, but I’m also not gonna make you go.”
Cas pushes him towards the bed when they get back to the cottage, leaving a trail of clothes behind them as he kisses Dean deep and slow, his tongue hot and wet in Dean’s mouth. They bang against the wall a couple of times, uncoordinated and perfect as they make their slow dance to the bedroom, not bothering to turn on any lights.
“Great.” He hangs up the call and tosses the phone onto the seat next to him, smoothly sliding the car into an open spot. The parking lot is pretty much deserted, and some dude in a suit is standing at one of the pumps, filling up some late-model Honda. Through the windows of the station store Dean can see a large flatscreen TV hanging from a wall playing the news.
By the time he slips his fingers out, Dean is wet and open, his chest and face red with exertion. The head of Cas’ dick tags against him as Cas uses one hand to guide himself inside, sliding in with one long, slick motion, and Dean bites his lower lip against the shout that threatens to escape. Cas rumbles somewhere deep in his chest, his hands slipping into Dean’s, twining their fingers together and stretching Dean’s arms over his head, pressing them back against the mattress, effectively trapping Dean beneath his weight with next to no leverage. Impossibly, he slides even deeper into Dean, and Dean makes a strangled noise in the back of his throat.
Dean takes a quick sip of his coffee to mask the rush of heat that threatens to overtake him. “I mean, it’d be pretty shitty to my patients if I sucked at my job,” he jokes.
“Don’t touch it --” Dean starts to hiss, then gasps as an icy-hot sensation shivers through his leg and up his spine, spiking through his brain. It’s almost painful, but it disappears as quickly as it came; when Dean looks down, his ankle is no longer swollen, and there’s no pain when he flexes it, testing.
“I can’t hold souls, only beings without them,” the Empty says like it should be obvious. “Millions of angels and demons, all full of emptiness, they all come here and sleep. Which is what
Castiel shrugs again. “Yes.”
“Whatever is going on, it isn’t your fault,” Cas says. “And it doesn’t matter that you don’t have the magical capabilities that he does. That’s not the reason for Sam’s struggles. But he knows he can always turn to you for help.”
He hesitates for a moment outside the door, wondering if he’s about to walk into a trap. This is probably in the top ten stupidest things he’s ever done. Should he have a weapon? This feels like one of those moments where a gun might actually come in handy.
But Cas doesn’t lean back.
They clean up quietly, and Charlie gives him another tight hug before she heads out. “See you soon, stranger. And think about what I said, okay?”
“Maybe there’s traffic,” Cas offers, breaking the silence between them.
cavities at the same time,” Dean hisses. “Chuck’s a petty son of a bitch, I wouldn’t put it past him!”
“Dean,” she says, tone clearly worried, and Dean forces some cheer into his tone.
Sam shifts, crossing his arms as his face morphs into what Dean calls
Dean gives it about halfway through his first shift before Cas wants to change into jeans.
Dean points at the various lines. “You’ve got your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiration, and temperature. All pretty self-explanatory, right? Depending on what those readings are, the monitor may sound alarms. Since you just have this one piece, I wouldn’t worry too much about trying to put any software on your work computers that will let you turn off the alarms remotely. Actually, you probably shouldn’t do that at all. Always check the alarms.” He’s slipping into teaching mode, but it’s hard to stop himself when this is almost word-for-word what he says when students shadow him. “If an alarm sounds, figure out why. Most of the time, it’s because one of the sensors isn’t picking up any information because it’s come loose or something. While that’s the common explanation, don’t let yourself get too comfy.”
“I mean, probably not --”
Just a month or so after he’d found Cas, Dean’s lease had ended, and rather than make the poor dude continue to sleep on his couch for the foreseeable future, Dean had signed a lease on a two-bedroom apartment instead. Moving had been exhausting, but it was finally done -- and Cas’ smile when he’d sat down on his own bed for the first time had been more than worth it.
If Dean wasn’t approximately thirty seconds away from puking, he’d kiss Cas.
It’s another quiet morning when Sam takes his laptop into his room to catch up with Eileen (“Have a good
“Billie was going to kill us,” he says, and puts the beer down unsteadily, not caring that it tips over with a clang as he studiously ignores Sam. He grips the kitchen counter with both hands, trying to keep his knees locked so that he doesn’t slide to the floor again. “Cas’d -- he’d made a deal with the Empty. For Jack’s life. When he experienced a moment of -- of true happiness… the Empty would come for him. And when he summoned it, it took him and Billie.”
“You will not harm a single human,
Something swoops inside of Dean’s ribcage, and he holds Cas through it, feels Cas shake apart in his arms.
“How’s your new job going?” Sam asks Cas, and Dean swears Sam’s slurring his words just a bit. “Dean texted me that you’d picked something up.”
Rowena clasps her hands together in front of her heart. “Oh, how romantic. You owe me ten dollars, Samuel, don’t think I forgot.”
“Hello, Dean,” a voice says behind him.
Dean stares at the jagged pieces, heart pounding doubletime in his chest. Sam is also staring at the spot where the former jar was, mouth agape.
He sits down on the edge of the mattress and stares at the wall. Realizes he hasn’t turned on the light, but getting back up to flip the switch would take too much effort. Now that he’s sitting, now that the stress of the last, fuck, 18 hours has left his body, he’s not sure he can stand up again. There are bruises starting to make themselves known on his torso, on his arms. He pushes his right sleeve up, finds a nasty one on his shoulder from where Lee’d caught him with a hook. Presses his fingertips into it, harder and harder, until he hisses from pain. Presses some more. It’s nearly unbearable. He keeps pressing.
The ache that had blossomed under his ribs the moment the bunker door had shut behind Cas finally feels like it’s starting to dissipate, which Dean is grateful for, only to be replaced by a different ache. A hungrier ache. Dean’s hands tremble with the need to reach out and touch Cas, to hold him. To embrace him like he had in Purgatory, and never let go.
“Oh, shit,” Dean says, and the man looks up at him, and even through the bruised slits of his eyes, Dean can tell his gaze is an unearthly blue.
Nick pinches his nose, holding his head back for just a moment, then twists his grip, and Dean hears another horrifying crunch as Nick pushes his nose back into place. Blood still trickles down his mouth and chin, turning the feral grin on his face into a nightmarish grimace. “Feisty,” he says, advancing on Dean. “First Castiel, now you… you’re the proverbial flies in the ointment. But not for much longer.”
“We’re not fighting,” Cas agrees, though his squint says otherwise.
“I just want to help however I can,” Cas says, and Dean melts a bit.
He heads them off at the pass, before the well-trod argument can be trod once again. “
“Yeah.”
They step back out onto the sidewalk in front of the building, the sun inching its way closer to noon. “Yeah, just let me know when you’re free. Sounds like you might have some long hours coming up, though.”
When Cas gets home, Dean is firmly moving from tipsy to drunk, a couple of empty beers and a quarter-empty bottle of whiskey on the coffee table in front of the couch. Cas cocks his head at the assortment as he hangs up his jacket. “Decided to have a party without me?” he quips.
Dean’s mouth is suddenly dryer than a desert, and he grips the wheel so tight the leather squeaks in protest. “It’s your life, dude,” he says, voice scratchy, “you deserve to enjoy it. And you make me happy, too.”
His whole body hurts, actually, more than happy to remind Dean that he’s on the wrong side of forty to be getting into bar fights (
The door to the restaurant opens with a jingle, and Sam comes hurrying inside, sliding into the booth next to Cas. “Sorry,” he apologizes, “I just got super caught up in what I was doing and completely lost track of time. Have you guys ordered yet?”
“To be fair, it wasn’t just the time with Ben. There was Louis, and Francis, and Catriona, and Eloise, and Marcus, and --”
Dean paces back and forth in front of him, gray robe fluttering as he does. “Billie said that every individual has at least one book with their death in that library,” he says, putting the pieces together. “Do you think Chuck has a book in there?”
“Just doing my job, man,” Dean deflects. “Go ahead, get some sleep. I’ll talk with you later, Cas.”
The smile Cas gives him is at once radiant and devastating, just a small quirk of his lips. “I didn’t want to burden you, Dean. Not any more than I already have. I wanted you to make a choice for yourself, now that you’re finally free, without any pressure from -- from me. That’s the last thing I want.” He says the last part with the only hesitation on his face that Dean has seen since that horrible night in the bunker, and understanding rushes through him like a wave of force, followed by a second, softer wave of
Cas bites at his bottom lip, licks into his mouth, and Dean will never get over how expansive Cas’ kisses are, how open and lush he makes himself, teasing noises out of Dean that he would never admit to in front of anyone else. The bed creaks beneath them as Dean rolls his hips down, shudders at the feeling of Cas’ hardness against his own, the way Cas’ muscles jump under Dean’s fingers as he palms his sides. They’ve been at this for what feels like hours, soft, slow kisses devolving into dry-humping on the bed like literal teenagers.
“Dean?” Cas asks carefully. “Are you alright?”
There’s a hot bubble of want in the pit of Dean’s stomach, his own hands delving beneath Cas’ ever-present coat and suit jacket to scrabble at his tucked-in shirt. He pulls it up, rests his hands on the warm skin of Cas’ sides, sharp hip bones melding with muscle.
“You’re not going to ruin this for me, Dean,” Nick says, looking behind him at the altar. “Not when I’ve been waiting so long for today. Not after how hard I’ve worked. I will not be denied the power that I am owed.” He stalks forward, closing the gap between them, and lifts Dean into the air by his throat, choking him again. Dean gives a harsh, bitten-off cry as his airway is cut off once more.
Charlie whirls on Dean, pointing her finger accusingly at him. “You’ve lived with this guy for how long now, and you never asked him about Star Wars?” she harangues. Dean holds up his hands in surrender, but Charlie keeps going, really building up steam. “How is this possible? Dean Winchester, I thought I knew you! I bet you haven’t even asked him about his favorite Star Trek series, have you? Oh my god, the only thing you’ve made him watch is Dr. Sexy, isn’t it!”
“Yeah, it’s really bad. And it happened to both pureblood and turned werewolves, so it’s harder to pin down what the issue might’ve been.”
Consistently failing everyone he cares about, the Dean Winchester story.
Cas’ breath is ragged, and Dean can feel his heart beating wildly in his chest. Dean just holds him, lets him work through it.
everyone back.
“Fuckin’ carseat!” Jack agrees, kicking his legs out happily in said seat.
“Do you want the rest of your food to-go?” Cas asks, the first words he’s spoken since the argument started.
. Their only chance, as far as Dean can tell. Heat rushes through his veins, and he wants to give in, wants to let it out because he
rings through his head, and he sees Sam’s pale, sunken face in his mind’s eye, a magic he can’t control consuming him from the inside out. “What happens if I can’t stop them?”
He watches Cas carefully as he slips out his tongue and licks it up.
“What happened?” the guard asks.
“Yes.”
and right now he is fucking that up spectacularly, because, “Uh, I, ah, should’ve asked already, but… how are you feeling today?”
There’s no answer. Dean glances at Cas from the corner of his eye and sees Cas staring at his own hands like they belong to a stranger. Maybe the memory issues are more deep-seated than he’d thought, but with Cas’ demonstrated…
instead of
The sky is filled with gunmetal gray clouds by the time Dean makes it over to Rowena’s office, parking on the street and tugging his collar up against the sharp wind that’s started since he left his apartment. Maybe an early winter storm is on its way. Dean glances up nervously. If it snows, he’s screwed. Baby isn’t the best on snow and ice, and normally he changes out her tires if he has to drive her in winter weather.
Sam smiles again. “Rowena put that up after the last time you were here and you spilled your coffee all over the spell she’d spent two days setting up. Most of our rules are Dean rules, now that I think about it.”
“What the fuck is wrong with me,” he mutters, and packs himself off to work. He needs to get his head on straight for the day -- things have been picking up over the past few weeks, and there’s a lady in the long-term thoracic care unit who keeps demanding that Dean, and only Dean, bring her lime jello every two hours when he’s on shift.
“How did I let you convince me this was a good idea,” Dean mutters, trying not to let his hands shake as he hauls his duffel bag into the overhead bin. “We should’ve just driven down to the Gulf.”
He wishes it were that simple.
The man -- no, Castiel now -- furrows his brow, like he’s not sure what Dean means. Maybe it’s a cultural thing; there are certain groups of fairies that don’t use their clan name as their surname, though most people and creatures use them by now. Or it could be a memory thing.
Dean’s mouth feels desert dry as he stares up at Cas. “I --” he starts, but Cas just shakes his head.
“Since when did you turn into his biggest cheerleader?” Dean raises his eyebrows in mock surprise. “Thought the two of you weren’t exactly the best of friends, unless you guys were having burger dates behind my back or something.”
Afterwards, Cas lays with his head on Dean’s chest, thumb rubbing back and forth over a nipple, Dean’s rapid heartbeat slowing back down as he gets his breathing under control. Outside, the ocean slides over the sands with a whispering noise that Dean can only just hear inside the cottage. Cas presses a kiss to his collarbone, nothing more than a soft caress of lips, and Dean tilts his face down, letting Cas’ hair tickle against his nose and chin. He smells like sun and the sea, and it makes something balloon in Dean’s chest, pressing painfully against his ribs and up his throat.
Rowena’s eyes are rimmed in bright red, her cheeks abnormally pale as she struggles to get her breathing under control. “That was…” she begins, clearly searching for words. She levels her gaze on Castiel, who is beginning to sit back up, his breathing still labored. “That was powerful. Powerful and extremely old. But that -- that was just the residue of your magic,” she says, voice thin and reedy.
Dean sighs and opens the beers, handing one to her. “We’re friends, Charlie. And roommates. I’m not gonna pressure a dude who doesn’t know who he is or where he comes from to hook up or date me or anything.”
Evidently he doesn’t do it fast enough, because Cas glares up at him and suddenly Dean is on his back and his boxers have been thrown across the room, he thinks. Cas is looming over him, blocking out the light from the lamp behind them, a golden glow lining his skin, and Dean’s breath catches in his throat for a moment. With his wild hair and broad shoulders, Cas looks every inch the avenging angel in this moment. There’s a tug of whitehot lust at the base of his spine at that thought, and Dean shifts his legs open on the bed, an invitation. A request.
“I -- maybe,” he says, thinking about it. The last time he’d stumbled in on Sam and Eileen making breakfast together had been while… while Cas had been gone. When he’d left because Dean had pushed him away. Something sours in Dean’s stomach at the goddamn parallels, and he wants to be sick. “Don’t wait for me. When you’re hungry, you’re hungry. I’ll be there or I won’t, don’t worry about me.” He walks out of the kitchen before Sam can say anything else, footsteps too loud in the empty bunker corridors.
And Cas’ powers may be waning, but he’s still an angel, Dean reminds himself as he’s suddenly pushed up against the counter behind him, Cas pressed up against him in a long, hot line, tongue slipping past his lips before Dean even realizes he’s being kissed. He fumbles a bit, sets his beer down carefully on the counter--away from him and Cas, he’s learned his lesson, thank you very much--and leans into it, opens his mouth on a sigh as Cas’ hand curls through his hair, grip just on the right side of pain and pleasure. Cas’ other hand is curling around the base of his throat, thumb stroking the thin skin on the side of his neck, and he makes a satisfied noise that nearly liquifies Dean’s knees.
Dean stops himself from rolling his eyes and blowing this guy off. “No, I was just… dropping something off for my brother. He’s her apprentice. Look, they’re super busy right now, dude, I don’t think Rowena can help you with whatever you’re trying to do. I’d go look for another witch for help.”
“Dean?” Eileen says, her voice gentle, and Dean blinks. Right. They were talking to him. Talking about… about taking down God. Chuck. Whatever.
“Don’t you get it?” Sam asks, his eyes fever-bright in his pale face. “It’s not gonna
, and Cas’ mouth is red and wet above him and suddenly all he wants is to kiss him.
“Let’s get some drinks, set up Star Trek, and then I’ll start my magic, sound good?” Charlie says, opening her laptop and sitting down on the couch. “Handmaiden, fetch us some beverages,” she directs to Dean.
For a moment, the only sounds are the muted lapping of the waves against the shore and the crying of seabirds wheeling in the dawn sky. A high, thin wail breaks out over the scene.
But then Cas’ hand stops moving, and Dean pulls back with a frown. “Dude, what’s wrong?”
you want?” Charlie’s brows are twisted, and she drums her fingers lightly on the top of her laptop.
He doesn’t say any of that though, because he can see the exhaustion lining Cas’ face, the way his eyelids droop even as he fights to keep them open. So he gives Cas a small smile instead, leaning forward to brush a kiss across his lips. “Thank you,” he says again, and he means it.
Dean gives him a wan smile in response. He knows Benny means it; even when they broke up, Benny never withheld his friendship, has always offered himself as a rock for Dean to lean on. But Dean can’t tell him the whole story this time, and so Benny’s optimism is sincere but misplaced.
Back inside the apartment, Dean goes and pours Cas a glass of water and says, “Drink this slowly,” as he hands it to him.
Dean nearly drives off the road at Sam's sudden gasp, his nerves still frayed from too many years of running, fighting, hunting. Of being pursued by God. "What? What's the matter?"
“Who knows,” Dean says. “Maybe nothing. But he came to warn me about Sam and Rowena, so maybe he’ll know what to do.”
Dean grunts and grabs Cas’ face, brings him up for another kiss, desperate and sloppy. It’s probably not a good kiss, too wet and Dean definitely bites Cas’ lip, but he doesn’t seem to care, just murmurs, “Dean,” low and urgent into the space between them.
in Dean so much that Dean has to look away. “I ain’t the right guy for this, Cas,” he mutters to his shoulder, blinking against his stinging eyes. “You said so yourself when you walked into that water.”
“Cas!” Dean exclaims, but can’t do much more than that as the three selkies rush them. They’re fast and strong, and Dean just barely ducks their fists, punching Zachariah in his soft stomach and pushing him away. It doesn’t seem to do much, but Dean has been working with supernatural creatures for years -- he knows how to deal with preternaturally strong beings who want to rip his throat out.
They go out again for dinner, heading into town and eating at a place on the boardwalk that serves some of the best oysters Dean’s ever had. There’s a group of local teens hanging out on the beach nearby, a couple of them with large surfboards that they paddle out onto the water, watching the sunset. Once the moon rises, they hug each other and load into beat-up Jeeps, trying to make it home in time for curfew.
“Only if he can use your kitchen. Last time he tried to use our oven, he set off the fire alarm and the whole building had to evacuate.”
Dean’s chest aches, and he wants to believe Cas so badly, he does. But Sam is still his little brother -- still his responsibility. And Dean would rather die than let something bad happen to him. Again.
“Cas, if you’re out there somewhere, I -- I still got something to say to you. Something I should have said a long time ago. But I want to say it to your face. So… so if you can hear me, please.” He pauses, takes a breath. “Please let me say it to your face.”
With a groan and a hiss, Cas pushes himself off the ground. “No, I’ll take it, thank you,” he says, holding out his hand. His voice, gruff on a normal day, sounds like it’s been put through a meat grinder and spat back out. “The medication is already beginning to help; I’m feeling a lot better.”
Rowena starts walking towards the cabin. “I’m going to see if this homey little spot has functioning plumbing. When you boys have figured out the plan, come find me.” She gives them a little wave of her fingers.
Sam frowns and blinks, taking in the forest of empty bottles sitting next to Dean as well. “Did you even try to sleep?” he asks, a note of reproach creeping into his tone.
When he comes back to himself, Cas is holding him tightly, face pressed against Dean’s throat. He feels Dean shift and leans back a little, looking into his eyes, gaze soft and searching. Dean marvels at the man--the
There’s a woman standing behind the checkout counter when he runs into the store, and he vaguely recognizes her as Nora. He’s seen her a few times when dropping Cas off in the mornings; he says she likes to come in and do a quick walkthrough before taking her daughter to school. No one else is in the store, thankfully.
Dean snorts. “As good as two people who can’t even light a candle with magic can do, I guess, sure. Probably could’ve done a whole lot better, too.”
For the second time in less than a year, Dean closes his eyes and pours his soul into a prayer.
Something lets out a grunt on the other side of the now-visible dumpster, and Dean freezes for a moment, because that wasn’t an animal. That was too deep to come from a raccoon or a rat or whatever. The image in his head quickly shifts from a rabid raccoon jumping at his face to a feral kid or something.
“Why else? To read his fate and, perhaps, to change it,” Castiel surmises, and he can tell the moment Dean understands what he’s really saying as a light dawns in his eyes. Something that might be sadness flashes for a moment at the very core of Castiel; once again, he has distracted Dean Winchester with more pressing matters than his own mission.
The Empty scowls then, and actually paces away, tension coiled in the trenchcoated lines of its shoulders. “He’s not here,” it says, a snarl trapped in the corners of its mouth. “The little chickadee grew himself a soul, somehow, and between that and the toddler god opening a door, he waltzed right out.”
Cas makes a low, soft noise between them. Dean lets his hand slide forward, bumping over Cas’ knuckles and up his arm, just letting his fingers feel the shape of the muscle, learning. Cas brings his own hand up, cups his large, warm palm over the side of Dean’s neck, leaves it resting there. His thumb strokes lightly at the hair at the base of Dean’s neck.
Dean sighs again and reaches down, carefully slinging one of the man’s arms over his shoulder to help him up. “Come on,” he says, “I’ve got some blankets in the trunk so you don’t bleed on Baby’s upholstery. Keep your weight off that ankle while we walk. Lucky for you, it’s still early so no one’s gonna really see all your goods.”
“I’m trying to prevent more things like that from happening.” This time, Cas looks directly at him, gaze steely and unrelenting. “Please, Dean. Go home. Stay safe.”.
Zachariah snarls at them. “You can’t hide anymore, Castiel,” he says. “We know you’re alive. You’re a thorn in our side, and Lucifer will end you one way or another.”
“It’s
As he walks away, Dean gestures for Cas to follow him, walking closer to the shoreline. And then he stops, staring down at the ground.
Dean gives him a strained smile, biting into a salty fry. The sharp taste of vinegar explodes across his tongue, a fitting counterpoint. “Guess you need to get your eyes checked,” he jokes, bitter and acrid. “‘Cause I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but it’s been a month at this point, and everything’s been radio silent.” Which made sense, since Cas was probably too busy somewhere in the middle of the ocean to whip out his phone and call or text Dean.
“Right,” Dean says, looking nervously at Sam, who just kind of shrugs. Rowena appears to be particularly short-tempered today; it’s probably best to just do what she wants and get out of the way. “Okay, so I just need the connections that came with this, and I’ll plug ‘em in and show Sam what’s what.”
“I’m going to rip your heart out and eat it in front of you,” he growls, voice animalistic and deadly. “And I’ll make your stupid pet human watch before I kill him, too. And
Dean watches as, for just another second, his brother hesitates and then comes to a decision. And he knows he’s lost this fight, no matter what else he says. Because Sam believes in what he’s saying, and nothing Dean can say will change his mind.
He’s no stranger to this kind of fear, nor to the pain of losing someone close to you.
“Well, then we’ll find another way,” he says, and has to look away from the aborted flinch Sam gives, because he knows he was expecting shouting.
“Hey now,” Dean protests, walking back into the living room and passing out beers, “you’ve read more bad sci-fi books than I have, Charles. Besides, you love being called a technomancer.”
The three of them stare at Cas for a moment. He stares back. The baby -- Jack -- reaches up and pats at Cas’ chin, curious.
“And you know this from experience.”
Castiel glares at him for another moment, then slumps back with a sigh. “Sorry,” he mutters, looking away. “I’m -- my apologies. Keep going.”
Castiel nods, and his eyes follow Dean’s finger perfectly. The hazy look he’d had is also gone, Dean notes. When he carefully runs his hands over Cas’ head, the painful bump has disappeared. “Okay, let’s try some basic questions,” he says. “What day is it?”
“I’m never gonna not want you here,” he says, the truth of it bubbling up like a spring inside of him, turning into a river, a flood. “You -- you said that knowing me has changed you. Well, I feel the same way about you. Um, I feel the same way about all of it, actually. The way you feel about me. I -- I should’ve said it before.”
“That’s pretty deep,” Cas observes, stone-faced. “He’s very tall.”
“Yeah, but --” he fishes for the right words, trying to figure out exactly what he’s trying to say, “this is -- this is a lot. I mean, I’m just some guy. This is more than I deserve.”
“Oh my god! How many times do I have to say I’m fine? I don’t rag on you when you work more shifts than you’re supposed to because someone called out, do I? I’m just working a lot on stuff that you don’t understand! I know you don’t have magic, but that doesn’t mean what I do isn’t valuable, too.” He stands up abruptly, banging the edge of the table with his legs. The dishes in front of them jump; a little bit of Sam’s mostly uneaten rice spills onto the polished wooden surface. Dean almost doesn’t notice that Sam has pulled out his wallet because he’s making sure his water doesn’t spill all over the place.
“Works for me. You can shower while we wait. You stink like antiseptic.”
Dean feels himself clench around Castiel’s length, words rumbling through him, sending sparks zipping up his spine, down his legs where they’re wrapped around Cas’ hips, making his toes curl. “Yeah,” he murmurs, and it’s another apology that he can’t make himself say, but Cas seems to get it, because his eyes soften, the light in them no less fierce, but warmer somehow. He rolls his hips again, and Dean bites his lip, because it’s good, it’s so fucking
“Be nice to him, Benny, he’s had a rough few days,” Dean says, swiping an uneaten fry off of Cas’ plate. Cas is squinting at Benny with poorly disguised annoyance, and Dean really doesn’t want to deal with whatever weird pissing match the two of them have decided to start.
“Did you just have an appointment with Rowena?” Nick asks, hopeful. “I’d really appreciate being able to see her today, I’m trying to get a specific binding removal ritual completed and she comes highly recommended.”
Both Rowena and Sam’s eyebrows shoot into their hairlines and Dean groans. “My, my, Dean Winchester,” Rowena practically purrs, delight lighting up the depths of her hazel eyes, “you found a naked, amnesiac man in an alley and brought him home with you? How… scandalous.”
“I called out; Nora understood that it was a family emergency,” Cas says, not really meeting Dean’s eyes.
“Sammy? You okay?”
Cas’ demeanor changes instantly, and he bares his teeth at them, his arm thrown across Dean’s chest like that will protect him. “You won’t hurt Dean,” he growls. “I won’t let you.”
“Are you sick
This was not a battle Dean expected to win today, that’s for sure. He stares at Cas for a moment longer, then offers, “I can ask around at the hospital for any recommendations, if you want. Then we can make an appointment.”
“Uh,” Dean says. Sam seems to be in a similar position, looking at Castiel with his mouth slightly open in surprise. But he recovers, shaking his head like a dog throwing off water.
Rowena goes over to a small cabinet and pulls out a mortar and pestle and several bundles of herbs, beginning to grind them into a paste on her desk. “Well, the eyes are the windows to the soul and all that. They make great conduits for magic, as well. And Castiel’s eyes are just so clear and stunning, it’ll make this process a breeze. That was a compliment, dear,” she throws over her shoulder at Cas.
Holy shit, he’s an idiot. An idiot with no brain-to-mouth filter, apparently. But instead of giving him a look like Dean has grown a second head, Cas is still smiling at him, that same crooked grin from before, but slightly wider, making the lines at the corners of his eyes deeper.
Zachariah steps forward, closing in on them. “Maybe worry about yourself a bit more, Castiel. Who cares what happens to the human anyway. After all, it’s gonna be your head we bring back to Lucifer.”
“I told Jack that I’m still angry,” Dean says, and Castiel doesn’t react because he can hear the unspoken
Before Nick has time to react, Cas runs up behind him and stabs the blade into his back. Nick chokes and stumbles, dropping Dean to the ground and staring down at the bloodied silver tip protruding from his chest.
of not noticing.
“I won’t,” Dean snaps, regretting it a moment too late.
They pull up to a nondescript concrete and metal warehouse, the kind that was obviously built to be temporary but ended up sticking around over the years. Dean parks on the street, apprehension twisting in his gut. “Stay here,” he tells Charlie. “I’ll let you know when it’s safe to come in.”
“Then what
With a small nod, Castiel goes back over to the couch, draping the blanket over his shoulders once again. “What time will we go see your brother tomorrow?” he asks.
It gets Cas to open his eyes and sit back up in the chair, though he sighs and digs the heel of his palms into his eyes before looking at the rest of them. “I don’t wish to overextend your help and hospitality any more than I already have,” he gravels out, “but I’m not quite sure what I should do next. Are there any other resources I can look into? Somewhere I can stay?”
Cas groans when he grinds their hips together again, his lips slick against Dean’s mouth, nipping carefully at the well of his bottom lip. Dean’s mouth feels bruised and wet, and it’s good, so good, he thinks he could kiss Cas forever if he wanted. Cas seems to be okay with it, if the way he leans into Dean’s touch is any indication.
There’s a knock at the door, and Dean has half a second to realize that they
Dean chews his bottom lip for a moment, hesitating. The Castiel standing before him isn’t the same one he went for a walk with earlier. Or is he? There’s something different to the set of his shoulders, the way he holds himself as he stands, but his eyes are still the same, the curve of his mouth and the press of his palm still familiar and right. Something has changed in him, but he’s still
“Were you talking to Sam?” Cas asks, turning on the couch as Dean walks in and sits down, putting the popcorn in front of them.
Now it’s Dean’s turn to roll his eyes, but he can’t stop the helpless grin that spreads across his face as he watches Cas’ expression shift from pleasantly curious to some mix of surprise and shock as Charlie talks at him at her standard speed of a mile a minute. “I wouldn’t call the favor boring,” Dean teases, knowing that Charlie is much more likely to say yes if he can frame it as an interesting challenge, “just something that I’m pretty sure you’re the only one who can handle it.”
“What happened?” he asks, taking her elbow and carefully getting her to sit down. Her eyes are sightless gray orbs staring at nothing. Other than the sun lesions marring her skin, there are no other wounds on her face or body.
“Do you think this is Chuck?” he asks, the sudden horror hitting him like a sack of bricks thrown from a fourth-story window. “Is God making my dick limp?”
A group of college kids enters the shop, immediately raising the decibel level as they figure out their orders. Dean and Cas head back outside, and Cas slips a pair of aviator sunglasses over his eyes. It’s an unfairly handsome look, and Dean squints up at the sun and curses himself for not bringing his own pair along.
, and it’s been a little while since the last time Dean did this, so it’s not long before his throat catches and flutters and he has to pull off a little bit.
“I agree, Rachel. What was it the pirates used to say? Dead men tell no tales?”
He feels his eyes burn, now, as Castiel strikes that spot inside him that makes him cry out, makes him clutch Cas’ shoulders like if he lets go, he’ll fall. Castiel’s own eyes are wide, pupils dilated so much that there’s only a thin ring of blue visible as he stares down at Dean, and Dean can’t interpret the look in them, but there’s something wild staring down at him. Something on the precipice of being human, and it makes him shudder and arch his back.
“What does that mean,” Cas frowns.
But this reaching forward, this offering of the olive branch, it can’t only come from Dean. That prayer, that embrace among the blighted trees of Purgatory… a very long time ago, Castiel once said, “We’ve been through much together, you and I,” and those words ring more true now than they did even in that moment. Through it all, Castiel knows, their greatest triumphs have come when they’ve trusted one another, their deepest setbacks when secrets poisoned the connection between them.
“You’d better be fucking passed out at your desk,” he growls to the air, brows drawn low as he navigates the streets to Rowena’s office. Post-rush hour there aren’t many cars on the road with him, but he blows past a couple of minivans that are making the mistake of actually driving the speed limit.
And then the phone grows hot, almost too hot to hold. Dean gasps and loosens his grip, just as Sam’s voice begins speaking in what is clearly a hushed whisper but comes through loud and clear in Dean’s hand.
Well, Dean can relate a little too much to that.
The microwave dings just as Sam answers with a groggy “Hello?”
Like the Empty.
Panicking, Dean does the only thing he can think of to break Nick’s grasp, and headbutts him as hard as he can. His forehead connects with Nick’s nose with a sick crunch, pain blooming behind his eyes as their skulls bash together. But it works, Nick’s fingers uncurling in surprise as he rears back, hands coming up to staunch the flow of blood now trickling from his nostrils. Dazed and gasping for air, Dean scrambles back on the ground, palms scraping against the dirt and rocks beneath him, trying to put distance between them.
“Well, at least you’re seeing someone,” Charlie responds, though she sounds a little hesitant. “I know things have been weird between you and Sam, though. Seriously, I can come run interference if you want. It’s been a while since we’ve hung out, man. Also I can’t remember the last time I saw Sam.”
he wants to say,
Dean takes just a moment to feel guilty for what he’s about to say. “I’m just saying, you’ve been known to… make some bad decisions when you get wrapped up in something that takes all your attention.” He sets his jaw, looking back up at Sam, who looks… yeah. Who looks shocked. Just like he thought.
Dean turns to find Cas standing there, soaking wet, cradling the baby carefully against his chest. He looks down at the child in his arms, who is now red-faced but quiet. “Such children are incredibly rare for selkies. Jack here was born just about a year ago. His mother and I were good friends until Lucifer murdered her. And then when I learned what he was going to do with Jack, I tried to stop him by finding the two witches he planned to cultivate and sacrifice, but, well.” He shrugs, rueful. “A couple of Lucifer’s followers found me, stole my sealskin, and left me for dead. And that’s when Dean discovered me. The rest, well, I suppose you know.”
Sam must realize the same thing, because he stumbles forward, trying to shield his own eyes from the blinding light, and puts a hand on Rowena’s shoulder, shaking her vigorously. “Rowena, stop!” he calls out, shouting to make his voice heard over her own. “Rowena! Stop the spell!”
“Yes, I know, you stated this fact approximately 57 times between security and actually stepping onto the flight,” Cas says, chuckling. He lets go of Dean’s hand to pull the backpack back out from underneath the seat. “Here, I brought an extra pair of headphones since you probably forgot yours. Listen to some Metallica, you’ll calm down.”
, Dean thinks, and steers the car into a parking space.
Not-Cas sneers at him. “If that angel were here, I’d
And then he stiffens, cocking his head to the side, and Dean watches as his fingers draw what looks like a silver-gray sheet from underneath Uriel. It undulates softly in the breeze, and Dean realizes it’s not a sheet; it’s a hide. When Cas touches it, his eyes glow with a soft blue light, and he sucks in a surprised breath, audible even over the sound of the ocean.
Dean blinks, and everything rushes back in, sharp, and he hisses. There’s pain thumping at the base of his skull, shocking up his spine, thrumming in his knee when he so much as thinks about moving it. “I’m good,” he grunts, because he is, he’s gotten up from worse than this, and they were
There are a few people rushing past with steaming to-go cups of coffee in their hands, but otherwise the street is empty and quiet, the city in the process of waking up for the day. Dean doesn’t do many overnight shifts, but he can’t deny that there’s a certain peace to walking out of the hospital and onto a still city street. There are a couple of pigeons pecking at an unidentifiable smudge on the sidewalk, cooing softly, but otherwise the street is nearly silent.
Dean stares at him. Cas stares back, placid. A burning smell starts to permeate the air.
Sam looks at him like he wants to keep talking, the way he would sometimes force words these kinds of conversations out of Dean when they were younger and still had so much space for pain. Instead, he nods, like he understands. Dean thinks maybe he actually does.
“Thanks, man,” he says anyway. “I’ve gotta head out, I told one of my coworkers I’d pick up her shift this afternoon.”
Rowena makes a considering noise and sets down her tea again. There’s a spark of light that leaps from her fingertip to the saucer, and faint wisps of steam begin floating up from the liquid inside. “It would depend on the type of magic you have, its source,” she explains, circling around Castiel with a new gleam in her eyes. “For example, if it’s a familial magic, then I might be able to use part of it for tracking purposes. Or even if someone you know had imbued you with it, perhaps. Its essence could act as a homing beacon, in a way.”
“I’ll talk to you later,” Sam says, and he turns to Cas, holding his hand out. “It was great to meet you. Hopefully I’ll see you again soon, if you plan on sticking around for a bit. I know I’ve already apologized, but I really am sorry we couldn’t help more.”
Cas fucks his hips up once, twice, drinking in Dean’s moans as his finger presses lightly against his entrance, more exploratory than anything. Dean wraps his arms around Cas’ neck, tucks his face into the hollow behind Cas’ ear, gasping hotly, hips twitching as he waits. “So good,” he hears Cas murmur, and a fuzzy beam of pleasure arcs through him at the words.
Instead, he leans down, scoops his hands through the water, and splashes a wave at Cas, who splutters as it hits his face. “What was that for?” he exclaims.
Zachariah comes back with his own punch across Dean’s jaw, making his head ring. He tastes blood in his mouth as he struggles to keep his footing, looking up just in time to avoid another blow. He manages to duck behind Zachariah, smashing his hands down on the back of his head. Zachariah drops to the sand, groaning, but he doesn’t get up right away, and Dean turns back towards Cas and the other two selkies.
“No,” Cas cuts him off, “you said he’s very busy. I don’t want to distract him from his work. Besides, I’m not dissatisfied with my life at the moment, or, or disappointed or anything. Living with you, becoming your friend and meeting other people, my job at the Gas-n-Sip… I may not remember anything from before the alley, but for some reason I feel like I enjoy my life a lot more these days.” He gives Dean a small, crooked close-mouthed smile. “What I mean to say is that I’m pretty happy. And a lot of that is thanks to you, Dean.”
Ibuprofen is the greatest thing ever created by man, and Dean wakes up a few days later without any residual pain in his knee. He thinks about doing a little jig in celebration, but stops. The way things are going, he’d somehow manage to trip on nothing and do some real damage this time.
And then his little brother opens his mouth and says, “Because you don’t have the power; you’re not strong enough. This isn’t up to you. So either help me fix this, or leave. It’s your choice. But I’m not going to stop. There’s too much at stake.”
“It’s not that bad,” Sam is saying, and Dean feels like his brain is underwater, everything a little fuzzy and out of focus as he looks between his brother and the modified monitor, and suddenly it all slots into place.
Nick laughs and snaps his fingers. Suddenly, Dean can’t move, held in place by some unseen force. He strains against his restraints, but nothing happens.
Not that that stops him these days. Dean thinks he might even like the taste of coffee at this point. It might all be molecules, but Dean wants Cas to find molecules he actually likes.
Castiel nearly smiles at Dean’s question, because he expected this. Dean’s eyes are flinty, jaw suddenly clenched in trepidation and the first wisps of his deep-seated anger.
“Just wanted to check in and see how things are going.” Dean glances through the spice cabinet and grabs the salt, tossing a generous handful onto the popcorn for Cas. “How’s that research project treating ya? You and Rowena close to a worldchanging breakthrough yet?”
you, Sam!” Dean shouts, because it’s true: this is a shell of his little brother standing in front of him, like the life is being slowly drained from him. He takes a deep breath, hands clenching into fists at his sides. “You’re lying to yourself, man. I just want you to be okay. I know you’d want the same thing for me. And this, what you’re doing… it ain’t worth your life.”
They don’t do it.
Dean’s overwhelmingly aware of how much time is left on the rift now, the seconds slipping past faster than they were just a moment ago, and he knows that makes no sense, but that’s how it is.
And then Rowena struggles up as well, her own pale arm stretching out, matching Sam’s. Fire whips from her palm, as red as her hair, twisting around Lucifer in a spiraling pillar that has him howling in pain. Sam stabilizes himself, the spell growing stronger as the two of them channel it together, directing more and more flame at their captor.
the one who’s been burned. Sam steps back, holding his hand protectively against his chest, and for a moment all Dean can see is a five-year-old who got caught in the cookie jar.
“Dean?”
can refuse going to a hospital after getting mugged, but
“No,” Castiel shakes his head and winces, but he just leaves it at that. He probably has a pretty nasty headache, all things considered.
Well. Jack brought
That makes Dean shiver and shift closer. Cas lets him, lets Dean press him back against the arm of the couch behind them. The kiss deepens as Cas slides his tongue into Dean’s mouth, tilting his head back for a better angle. The hand on his neck smooths forward, fingers brushing down the hollow of Dean’s throat, resting in the dip of his collarbone, making him shudder again. He can’t stop the soft noises he’s making, can’t help the way his hips press forward against Cas’ own, the way he moans into Cas’ mouth as Cas pulls him in.
“I don’t know,” Cas responds. “According to Dean, I have one of the most severe cases of post-traumatic retrograde amnesia he’s ever seen, so maybe I have seen it but don’t remember. What is it?”
Cas’ sealskin is there, tattered and badly burned, the once-smooth silver-gray hide streaked in ash and curling at the edges. There are several holes where the fire burned hotter and faster, other parts so thin that Dean can see the light shining through when he picks it up. It looks beyond repair, and he turns to Cas with a stricken look, holding out the skin for inspection.
The same shoulder that Jack had placed his hand on just a scant few hours earlier, trying to console, to guide Castiel as he’d revealed his truth.
The man is watching him, gaze intense from under his brows. He gives him a grin when he sees Dean looking back at him and says, “That’s quite the car you have there. Very classic, and clearly well cared for.”
Sam laughs and says, “He and Cas got together, and he’s annoyed that I told him I knew it was going to happen.”
Maybe he grew up around the beach, or lived there before his memory loss. Dean opens his mouth to say something, but suddenly Cas shushes him, looking around sharply.
Underneath their lids, Cas’ eyes flicker, and Dean draws his hand back quickly as Cas wakes up, blinking slowly. “Dean?” he asks, voice sleep-rough and gravelly, and fuck, his eyes are deliciously sleepy and hooded. “Did I fall asleep? I’m sorry.”
“Thanks, buddy, seriously. I appreciate it.”
They pack up quickly, with Dean putting most of their stuff away and bundling Cas into a dry towel instead of letting him help much. Cas complains that he’s not an invalid, but Dean ignores him, shoving some of the emergency Excedrin he keeps on hand in Cas’ face. “Sam would get these massive headaches sometimes after studying for too long when he was in school,” he explains, “and I just got into the habit of keeping this stuff around. Coming in handy, huh?” He winks at Cas, grinning as he shoves the now-empty cooler back into the Impala.
Lucifer throws Cas into a tree, his back colliding with the trunk with a painful crash, but he gets back up quickly, shaking his shoulders out like a boxer. He rushes forward, swinging at Lucifer, who responds with his own blows, the two of them snarling like wild animals at each other.
“No outside beverages, no outside
With a huff, Dean pulls out a couple of antiseptic wipes and gauze from the kit, his skin buzzing, because holy
“If you want to think of it that way, Uriel,” Zachariah says -- he’s the one with the annoying voice. Dean grits his teeth. “I’ve never been a huge fan of shifting, honestly. I tend to only do it when I have to. Like right now.” He smiles and waves at Dean and Cas. “Hello, Castiel. Left us in quite a pickle, haven’t you? What do you have to say for yourself?”
“No, it’s not that.” Castiel shakes his head, a line appearing between his brows as he frowns. “It just feels… I’m not sure how to describe it. Like it’s too light, somehow, but weighted down.”
Next to him, Castiel shuffles awkwardly, pulling at the sleeves of the sweater Dean had let him borrow. It’s a little too tight around his biceps, which had most definitely
The man bites his full lower lip, considering, and then gives a curt nod. “No hospital,” he says again, a warning this time, and Dean nods.
“Dean.”
Cas makes a soft, surprised sound but doesn’t say anything. Just follows Dean to the storage room’s door, though he keeps close behind, warm against Dean’s back.
Sam stares at him for a moment, and Dean can’t meet his gaze, can’t look at his brother who knows him too goddamn well, because he knows Sam’s gonna figure it out. Even exhausted and emotionally wrung-out, Sam’s still gonna put two and fucking two together and get the right answer.
-- safe. His hands find the sides of Cas’ face, eyes suddenly blurry with tears, and he kisses him, pouring all the relief, the joy, the fear, the love within him into the press of his lips against Cas’ own.
He lets his touches linger, instead. A hand on Cas’ elbow when he passes by him in the bunker’s archives. A firm pat to the shoulder that stays longer than it should. Dragging his hand across the wide plane of Cas’ back as he drops off a mug of coffee next to Cas’ elbow where he’s working at the map table.
“I --” he starts, then closes his mouth, pondering. “There have been moments of joy, I would say. Of relief. Contentment. But nothing close to the
I’m going to finish what I started by killing the witches and the empty-sky child, and take the power that’s rightfully mine.”
Cas clasps his large hands together in his lap, leaning forward. “You have to stop Sam and Rowena,” he says, his voice urgent. “The things they’re working on, the person they’re working for -- you have to stop them. There will be dire consequences otherwise.”
And then he glances at Cas, the sharp line of his profile familiar and new all at once, and Dean…
“I… don’t know,” Castiel frowns. “Um. Thursday?”
Cas presses their hips together, grinds down hard, and Dean arches off the bed with a hiss, heat tingling in the pit of his stomach at the way their dicks slide against each other. He digs his fingertips into Cas’ muscled back, bites a kiss in the stubble underneath Cas’ jawline, pants into the shell of his ear.
Back at the cottage, Cas holds up the aquarium pamphlet again and says, “If we have time, could we go here? It seems interesting.”
“I’m not doing anything. You entered oblivion yourself, Dean. Did it of your own absolutely free will, too, isn’t that fun? Do you really miss the angel that much, that you would unintentionally throw yourself into death to find him?” The Empty steps back again and cocks its head to the side, the gesture so reminiscent of Cas that Dean has to look away. “How strange, that your grief drives you to such extremes that he will never see or understand. No wonder Castiel doesn’t think you love him; when have you ever given him cause to think you do?”
“What now?” Cas’ voice is rough. “Dean, please --”
“No, hold on,” Dean demands, standing his ground. “Seriously, what the hell is going on, Cas?”
of this place where you can get your luck back or whatever. I’m starting to think Garth made it up, or heard it from someone who did.”
“Don’t say what in front of me?” Cas’ deep voice asks behind him.
“Uh,” Dean stutters, and yup, that’s definitely his brain dribbling out of his ears, “Y-yeah, just a sec.”
“Oh,” she says, and goddammit. “Oh, Dean, I’m sorry.”
he asks, and Dean can practically hear the bitchy tone through the text.
“Shut up, no you did not.”
“You always were a sharp tracker, Castiel,” a voice calls, authoritative and deep. “Though you lack follow through, as I recall.”
After a few more sips, Cas sets the glass down and lets out a long breath. “I’m sorry to have worried you,” he says. “It just came on so suddenly, I didn’t know what else to do.”
“He ain’t coming anywhere near my kitchen,” Benny swears.
He curls his hands into fists as he walks toward his room, lets the sting of his raw knuckles wash over him. Feels his nails bite into his scraped up palms. He’s pretty sure there’s a few pieces of wood still embedded in his skin, splinters from the pool cue buried deep under the surface. From the firewood that he’d chopped and carried and stacked and set Lee’s body on top of, behind Swayze’s before he’d left. Given him a hunter’s funeral, despite it all. That’s how he wanted to remember Lee. Then he’d checked his phone and hightailed it out of there with smoke in his eyes, Cas’ voice ringing in his head.
“This is for our research,” Sam explains, moving closer. “We’re going to do some monitoring of magical energy levels and stuff, so we got this altered to allow us to do that.”
“How’s your head?” Dean asks.
The man -- Nick, he’d said his name was Nick -- smirks as he realizes Dean recognizes him as well. “I guess I should thank you just as much as your brother and the witch for setting all this up for me,” he says. “After all, you kept Castiel so happily distracted for me for such a long time. And you kept pushing Sam to commit himself ever deeper to the project. Honestly, Dean, I couldn’t have done this without you.”
At that realization, Dean leans forward, kissing Cas, interrupting whatever he’s about to say, focusing on Cas’ lips soft and warm beneath his own. Two first kisses on this couch, only this time there’s an undercurrent of desperation, of despair. The déjà vu intensifies as Cas makes the same low, soft noise he made the first time Dean kissed him, bringing a hand up to cup his face as the kiss deepens. And it’s probably a bad idea to be doing this; actually, scratch that, it’s the
“Everyone.” Cas looks at him, his brows drawn down, mouth taut. “The only reason you found me in that alley was because I was trying to stop Sam and Rowena before they ever started, but I was… discovered. I was beaten and left for dead, stripped of my sealskin and my memory.” He takes a breath, shaking his head. “How ironic that almost the very next day, you took me to where I had been trying to go, but I couldn’t remember. That I was so close for so many months. And now, it’s almost too late. I’ve regained my memory, but my skin… my true skin is still lost. I’m making do, but it’s not enough.”
He can hear more glass exploding as he walks back down the hallway to the front door. The sky is still covered in gunmetal gray clouds.
And then another person enters, a man shouting that he can’t see. And another behind him, wailing hysterically. Another. And then another. Over the hospital PA system, Dean vaguely hears a call for backup go out as more and more nurses and doctors flood the room.
, and Dean’s own eyes widen as a partially-shifted werewolf leaps in front of him, claws scraping against the concrete.
Sam shrugs but smiles. “Hopefully it won’t be too bad. Rowena seemed really excited when she got the message this morning. I think she’s been wanting a challenge for a while. And hopefully it’ll make the months before getting my title go a lot faster.”
Dean gets into Baby and drives away.
It takes a few weeks for Cas to land an interview, much less a job after Charlie sends the rest of his paperwork over, but eventually he finds a part-time gig at a nearby gas station. The pay is kind of shit, but hey, for all Dean knows this is Cas’ first job, and considering he doesn’t have an actual resume or CV of any kind, the Gas-n-Sip is a good place to get his feet wet. And Cas seems intrigued by the idea of working there; he’d described the slushie machine in frighteningly accurate detail when Dean had asked him how the interview had gone.
“I can’t, Dean,” Cas says, looking stricken. “I don’t -- it’s hard enough asking you to do this. I would give anything to keep you out of this whole thing, to keep you safe. But you’re the best chance I have to get Sam and Rowena to stop their research. They’ll listen to you.”
Something in the back of Dean’s mind notes that Cas is a pretty good kisser for a dude who probably doesn’t remember how to do it.
3. The Empty deal
The words stick in his throat, but he forces them out. “Just -- for this, I guess. For knowing I needed this.” His eyes sting, and he blinks rapidly.
He turns to look at Cas, who shakes his head. “It’s over, Lucifer,” Cas says, and Dean reels on the ground, trying to keep up.
She also offers to come over and marathon some bad horror movies and eat a lot of ice cream, and for a moment it’s
“I don’t know. He said something about the person they’re working for being dangerous, so it might have something to do with that. Or maybe someone wants the information they have? I’m as much in the dark on this as you are.”
Heat curls in his gut, zips down his spine as Cas moves over and inside of him, and Dean can’t really do much except let Cas fuck him in this position: he tries to lift his hips up every time Cas thrusts back into him, squeezes Cas’ hands with his own. The bed creaks and shakes beneath them, Cas’ breath hot against his face, eyes locked on one another. Cas feels huge, splitting Dean open and laying him bare with his cock, and Dean can’t take it anymore, closing his eyes as comes with a sigh, streaks of white landing on his torso as Cas fucks him through it, snapping his hips over and over.
Dean squeezes his hand. “Okay,” he agrees. “Let’s go home.”
than that. For Sam. For Cas. For himself.
It makes sense even though he hates it. “I don’t want him to get hurt again,” he mutters, shoulders slumping. He’s lost this battle, he knows, but he won’t admit it.
Cas peels the ID card from the official paperwork it’s attached to, turning it over in his hands once or twice like he can’t quite believe it’s his. He stares down at the photo of himself in silence. His eyes are intense, even in the postage stamp-sized photo that Dean had taken and sent to Charlie.
“It’s not a big deal,” Dean promises. “And it’s not as bad as you probably think. I just… I want to, Charlie, I do. But there’s a voice in my head that stops me, every time. I keep thinking, ‘What if he’s married and doesn’t remember it,’ you know? He could have a partner or a spouse out there somewhere who is worried sick about him, and I’d be keeping them apart.”
They stagger forward slowly, and Dean watches from the corner of his eye as the man’s face tightens on nearly every step, though he doesn’t give any other indication of the immense pain he is most likely in. His body is littered with bruises and scrapes, but thankfully nothing too life-threatening on its own. The major risks at this point are the cold and the probable concussion.
“We are bringing the werewolf in for observation,” the security guard says, “and we’ll be notifying the authorities about this incident as well. They should be here soon after we do that; do you want to press charges?”
Sam nods, then says, “Hold on a minute,” grabbing a pen and ripping a piece of paper off a nearby notepad. “Okay, go ahead.”
last night? Did you guys talk? Is he back?”
He hears the soft shuffle of cloth, and then Cas’ hand is grasping one of his, large and warm, callused in all the same spots that Dean remembers. He looks up in surprise to find Cas’ face much closer than before, and it’s a dizzying moment of déjà vu, staring into the depths of those endless blue eyes, now weighted down with burdens and memories that Dean doesn’t know. Maybe he’ll never know. Maybe the man -- selkie, technically -- sitting before him is a stranger, distant and unknowable. Maybe Dean never really knew him at all.
to wear the nice button down shirt he’d gotten a few weeks earlier, but Cas still insisted on wearing the same slacks that he’d worn to his interview. He wanted to look professional, he’d claimed.
With a gasp, Rowena flings herself back, closing her eyes and crossing her hands over her mouth like it’s the only way she can think to stop the flood of words. The light immediately fades from Cas’ eyes and mouth, receding back into him, and he slumps over in the chair, gasping for air as well.
A faint blush suffuses Castiel’s cheeks, but his expression doesn’t shift. “I was, ah, naked when Dean found me. No possessions on or near my person, as far as I can recall.”
They don’t turn on any lights when they get back, moving through the now-familiar rooms in darkness and near-total silence. Cas drapes the silvery hide over the back of the couch; he doesn’t move far away from it, just packs his bag as efficiently as possible. Dean watches him, trepidation settling like a stone in his gut.
“Oh please, every time we talked or hung out, all I heard was
And then Cas says, “Relax, Dean,” and he nudges the tip of his finger inside, pressed up against his cock, and Dean comes with a shout, body stiffening as whitehot light bursts inside of him, clouding his vision. He feels Cas stroke his dick through it, and it’s nearly too much, too good, and he feels like he’s shaking out of his body.
Cas is quiet for a few moments, and Dean takes a turn a bit faster than he probably should with only one hand on the steering wheel. He feels like he should have seen this coming; but Cas hadn’t had a migraine for nearly a month now, and Dean had been lulled into a false sense of security. The worst part is that he can’t figure out if the migraines are related to Cas’ amnesia and past head trauma or if they’re just random. They tend to range in intensity, but this one seems to be the worst Cas has ever had, at least that Dean’s seen. He grits his teeth, trying to decide if he wants to fight Cas about going to a neurologist.
“I don’t know, Sam,” he says, trying to remain calm. “The last time you said you felt more powerful, I had to check you into rehab.”
“What do you mean, just the residue?” Sam asks. There are the remains of tears on his own cheeks, Dean notices. They were all affected by what just happened.
“It’s been… interesting,” Cas offers, just as their waiter, Ralph, stops at their table to take their orders. Dean gets a loaded burrito (as always); Sam gets the three taco platter (also as always); Cas frowns at his menu for one last moment and orders the shrimp tacos.
that nearly slips out, but he holds it together, somehow. Maybe he’s hit his threshold for embarrassing himself today.
Dean sighs and sits up, leaning back against the headboard and digging the heels of his palms into his eyes. “I’m just -- I feel so worried these days, especially about Sam,” he says. “He’s the only family I’ve got left. I’d do anything for him, but lately I’ve been thinking that I just… I don’t have what it takes. What I can do, it’s not enough.”
And Cas looks so earnest, looks like he
Dean pushes on Nick’s shoulders, trying to break his hold, but the man -- he’s gotta be a selkie, like Cas -- keeps hold of him easily. Dark spots appear at the edge of his vision as he tries to draw in a breath -- who knew he’d ever have the honor of being choked out by not just one, but
“Great,” Cas gives him a smile, then heads towards the shoreline. Dean watches him walk right into the water, barely even slowing down to test the temperature before he’s up to his calves, then waist, then chest. He watches as Cas lurches forward and then --
“What the hell was that?” Dean demands, blinking rapidly as he tries to adjust back to the normal lighting of the room. There’s wetness on his cheeks -- he must’ve been crying, too. He scrubs at his face with the end of his sleeve. “Seriously, what the hell just happened? Was that normal?”
“Whoa, you’re looking into it? I thought you and Rowena were so busy you were barely eating or sleeping.”
Castiel backs up a bit and shrugs. “I feel much better than before, though my head still feels… strange,” he says.
Turning his attention back to the fight, Dean tries to pin the man down, but he’s preternaturally strong, flipping them over easily and getting a hand around Dean’s throat. His deep set eyes widen in surprise as he gets a good look at Dean. “I see today is a family affair,” he says, an easy chuckle escaping his mouth as he smiles. He flexes his hand, squeezing Dean’s airway shut.
Castiel is panting over him, and Dean didn’t think angels had to breathe, but maybe Cas came back different, somehow. More or less of an angel, Dean’s not sure, because Cas had died, exploded by an archangel, and Dean had said
Fuck, he shouldn’t have thrown his coffee away already.
Dean sets his jaw mulishly. “What, I’m not allowed to be worried about you?”
“If Hallmark isn’t your thing, then how do you know enough about it to reference it?”
Late afternoon sun slips through a crack in the blinds and washes across Dean’s face, waking him up. He flips over onto his stomach with a grumble, burying his face in the pillow and trying to slide back into sleep, to no avail. When he’s awake, he’s awake, and there’s no going back now.
Dean and Cas appear from down the hall, hair mussed and still a little wet. “Just peachy, Sammy,” Dean says, turning a grin towards Cas.
“It’s only been twenty minutes.”
Dean’s jaw is clenched, and Castiel can read anger and hurt on his face, two expressions he is unfortunately too familiar with seeing on Dean. And then he sees something different.
“Okay, alright,” Dean says, trying to keep his voice low and easy. “No hospital, I gotcha. But can I help you, at least? I’m a trained nurse, just got off shift actually, so I promise I know what I’m doing.”
Cas’ low voice comes through the door, but Dean can’t make out any words. Just listens to the cadence, the pitch. The gravelly tone that’s brought so much relief and so much pain in the past.
That jostles the man into opening his eyes wider, panic making his face go white. “No!” he says again, voice stringent, “No hospital, please! I can’t --” He cuts off with more coughing, and Dean lifts his hands up in surprise at just how forceful this dude is about not going to the hospital.
Dean clutches Cas and lets himself pretend that he’ll never let go, that neither of them will step back and end their embrace. He feels Cas practically fall into him, exhausted, and they’re each keeping the other upright, keeping the other standing. That’s how it’s always been, Dean realizes, clarity striking like a sunbeam through the gray clouds of Purgatory. They lean on each other and do not fall.
With an enraged cry, the werewolf lunges at Dean, claws ripping and tearing at his scrubs. Dean tries to scramble back but trips over his own feet, falling backwards hard. Dazed, he manages to get his feet up and between himself and the wolf, kicking as hard as he can against the creature’s chest to try to knock it back. It works for a moment as the werewolf stumbles slightly, but with another frenzied growl it rushes forward again, claws raking down Dean’s leg. It’s not a hard blow, but still shreds his pants and draws blood, and Dean grunts in pain.
fixed a second ago. No matter how many times he does this, he can never get the stupid thing buckled in right on the first try.
The shift he’s picking up isn’t until later, so he drives to the store to get a case of beer and a handle of whiskey. After tonight he’ll be off work for the next few days, thanks to the nurse supervisor refusing to schedule him for anything, and he finished the last of his alcohol last night after getting home from another shift. So he needs to replenish his stock. The thought of being sober for more than 24 hours, with no other distractions, is untenable.
“We need to get out of here,” Cas says, offering no explanation. He stands and holds out a hand, pulling Dean up with him. “Let’s go.”
Cas’ lips are a brand against Dean’s skin, burning him from the outside in, and he still has his fucking dress shirt on, but at least the collar is open, the tie thrown halfway across the room, probably. One of Cas’ big hands slips around to the small of Dean’s back, rests against the sweat-slick skin there, pinky finger nudging the top of his crack. His other hand wraps around Dean’s dick, grip almost too tight but exactly what Dean needs, panting and gasping as he lifts himself up again then grinds back down.
“Are you fucking kidding me, Dean.” Sam’s pale face is starting to flush, and Dean can see Cas looking between the two of them with an expression somewhere between confusion and apprehension. Guilt washes more intensely over Dean, along with a not insubstantial dose of anger. He’d hoped it was all over. Well, in for a penny, in for a pound.
“Fucking carseat!” Jack pipes in, and Dean winces but laughs.
Watching him walk out the door is a surreal experience, Dean has to admit. He feels, weirdly, a strange sense of pride, like he had the first time he’d watched Sam go off to school by himself.
Cas places his folded up clothing on the table next to Dean. “Will you be joining me soon?”
Dean whirls around, pasting an easy grin on his face. “Ah, nothing. Just joking around with Jack.” He gestures to one of the three duffel bags Cas is currently holding. “Is that his stuff? I’ll take that.”
There are hushed voices in the hallway, Sam and Cas. Dean would try to listen, but there’s a buzzing in his ears that drowns them out. He’d rather focus on that instead, anyway. Rather not think for a while. He presses the bruise, takes a drink. Stares at the wall some more.
“I guess, yeah,” Dean says, completely taken aback. “It’s easier to learn when I get to put it into practice and actually work with people hands-on, rather than just reading about it in some giant textbook.”
They kiss for what feels like hours, until Dean’s lips feel blurry and wet, his hands running up and down Cas’ sides. Cas kisses up the length of Dean’s neck, sucks a mark behind his ear, rolls his hips down against Dean’s, pressing the lengths of their cocks together. Dean moans, tipping his head back against the pillows, skimming his fingers up Cas’ dick before wrapping his hand around him, and Cas groans against his collarbone, filthy and melodic. He shifts again, pressing his hips more firmly between Dean’s thighs, creating a space for himself as he leans up and digs through the bedside table for the lube kept there.
Cas stays silent but his thumb continues to pass back and forth over Dean’s knee at a steady pace. Dean takes it as encouragement to keep talking. “They would’ve been great teachers for Sammy, ‘cept they got in a car accident when I was twelve. Hit by a semi, flipped completely over. Car was totaled. Dead on arrival at the hospital. Sammy took it really hard. I did, too, obviously, but he was only eight when it happened. Was convinced that he could’ve saved them, if we’d been there. That he was powerful enough for that.” He takes a deep breath, blows it out. Cas’ hand squeezes gently. “We went to go live with a friend of our dad’s, Bobby, who took us in without question. You’ll meet him someday, hopefully. Gruff old bastard with a heart of gold, but not a single magical bone in his whole damn body. Had no idea what to do with Sam’s magic, and I sure as hell didn’t know either. We tried, but --” he sighs, breaking off.
He hasn’t let himself think about it, not when there was a whole world to save. Not when he was being beaten to death on the beach by God himself; not when he needed to be strong, to do what Cas had given up his life for Dean to do.
He shakes his head. “Right,” he says, struggling to keep his tone even. “You can couch it in as much idealism as you want, but I know you, Sam. There may not be any drugs this time around, but you’re still chasing that high. And I can’t watch while you kill yourself for it.” He starts to walk to the workshop entrance, shoving his hands in his pockets to hide how badly they’re shaking.
Dean wakes to the gray light of an early winter day. There’s a sticky mess still on his belly; the spot where Cas had been laying next to him has long since gone cold.
“Because up until this point, Chuck has been very adamant about his stance on free will. He’s played by his own rules, so to speak,” Cas continues. “It’s only now that you’re going directly against his desires that he’s changing things and trying to trip the two of you up.”
“What? What is it?” Dean asks, keeping his voice low. He looks around as well. There doesn’t seem to be anything there; just sand and water, their footprints extending in a line behind them. “Cas? What’s wrong?”
“I don’t believe that for one second.” Benny folds his arms on the table and leans across towards Dean. “I saw the way he looked at you, brother, every time you two sat in this booth. You’re more important to him than you realize.”
Castiel stares at him wide-eyed, lost for words, because this is --
“Thank you, Dean,” he hears Castiel say, the telltale rustling of fabric in the background.
“What?”
“Yes,” he says, quiet, because that
Behind him, the water erupts, a silver-gray light shooting into the air and streaking towards the shore. As it hits the dirt, the light blazes and shrinks rapidly into the form of Castiel holding a silver blade, hair plastered to his head and his face locked in a fierce snarl. Maybe it’s a trick of Dean’s oxygen-starved brain, but Cas’ transformation seems easier this time around -- more fluid and natural, so very different from when Dean had watched him slowly shift using Uriel’s sealskin.
Cas’ eyes are still wide with shock, and Dean feels momentarily bad for the poor guy who’s just had the adrenaline rush of a lifetime, probably. “You should let them make sure you’re okay, Dean,” he says quietly.
“Sammy, you okay?” Dean says, brow furrowing. “Sammy?” Fear joins the slick unease floating in his stomach.
Cas sighs and shifts, gesturing for Dean to join him on the couch. “This is part of the important stuff,” he says, “It’s part of the reason why you found me in an alley here, all those months ago, beaten and left for dead.”
“No,” Dean grumps. He can hear Cas turning on the TV in the living room. “Look, dude, I just wanted to see if you were free for lunch someday soon. We haven’t seen each other in forever, and I miss my brother.”
“Don’t work yourself too hard, okay?” Dean says, playfully slapping Sam on the shoulder. His gut twists inside him. “Don’t need you disappearing for weeks on end.”
“You look like you’re about to collapse, man!” Dean exclaims, moving towards his brother because he doesn’t know what else to do. “Is that the plan? To keep going until you can’t anymore?”
He tugs on their joined hands, heading back the way they came. “Let’s go, then. Let’s get out of here.”
The way Cas’ eyes darken at his words makes the heat in Dean’s stomach flare. “Let’s go then,” he says, pushing against Dean’s shoulders, nearly tumbling him off the couch. Dean staggers upright and Cas is right behind him, kissing him again, lush and open. He tastes a bit like the popcorn, salt and a hint of butter, and Dean licks deeper into his mouth as Cas walks them backwards through the room.
“Here,” Cas says, unzipping his own fly and pushing his jeans down his thighs and past his knees, stepping out of them neatly. The outline of his dick is visible, huge and pressed up against his boxers, his legs muscled and curved. Dean nearly goes to his knees right there.
“Wait, Dean --” she protests, but Dean shakes his head, getting out of the car. His legs are stiff and awkward after so long spent driving, and there’s an ache blooming in the small of his back, but he shakes it off.
between them, and Dean can’t blame him, because Dean took that nameless thing they’d had and ripped it open, torn it wide and threw it as far away as he could, and Cas had looked at him and said
is the best time or place to talk about it?”
here, say something right for once. No one’s hurt, no one’s dying. Dean can deal with killing an old friend later--not like he hasn’t done it before, after all. He has to make the most of this sudden opportunity.
Cas is still staring at the credit roll as it travels up the screen, the expression on his face somewhere between dumbfounded and amazed. “That is ninety minutes of my life I will never get back,” he says. “I’m never talking to Isaac about movies ever again.” He also slumps back, staring up at the ceiling with disbelieving eyes. “How did a movie like that even get
“Yes.” Cas drains the last of his latte and sets down his cup. “I’ve been reading many of your old textbooks. The breadth and depth of knowledge you had to learn and comprehend during the course of earning your degree is astounding. And no doubt you’ve had to learn much more, as science has continued to progress while you’ve been at your job.”
There’s a hand in Dean’s hair, tugging his head gently to the side so Cas can kiss a hot line up Dean’s neck, tuck a bruise into the hollow where his jaw meets his ear, breath warm and heated against Dean’s skin. Dean’s hands fumble for a moment before finding the belt loops of Cas’ pants, pulling their hips together finally,
“What’s that saying? If you do what you love, you never work a day in your life?” Cas muses, stopping on the passenger side of the Impala.
“Get down!”
Cas makes a face like he just bit into an entire lemon, peel and all. “Well,” he starts, an uncharacteristic hesitation in his voice, “it’s possible.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, “All locked up. Let’s head out, before traffic gets bad.”
“I have to go, Dean. I have to stop them.”
“I think it’s burning,” Cas points out, snapping Dean back into the moment.
“Come on, the rest of it,” he says, shucking his own pants and boxers. He feels a little ridiculous toeing off his socks, but it’s okay, because Cas is taking off his shirt, revealing the trail of dark hair at his navel, the line of his hips. His dick hangs heavy and full between his thighs, the head already flushed, and Dean
Out the kitchen window, an osprey wheels over the bay in the distance, its shadow dancing along the water as it soars through the air, catching Dean’s eye. The waves are calm here, a gentle ebb and flow that drifts over the edge of the narrow shoreline not far from the back steps of the house. Suddenly, it’s as though he can see into the future as a vision strikes him: Cas and Jack swimming together in the water, Cas teaching him the secrets of the ocean, teaching him how to be both selkie and human; Dean grilling on the back porch, wedding ring glinting lightly in the evening sun as he calls the two of them in for dinner after getting back from his shift at the new hospital.
To his surprise, Cas smiles, soft and barely there, but a smile nonetheless. “I’d do it all again to save you. To save Jack,” he says, reaching forward to twine the fingers of his free hand with one of Dean’s. “Let’s go home. We’ll figure it out from there.”
“Dean has been very generous towards me over the past few weeks,” Cas adds, voice low. “I’d like to be able to pull my weight, as it were, and maybe get a job. Something where I can do more than just sit in the apartment all day, at least.”
The store is glaringly bright after the cool darkness of the back room, and Dean has to blink rapidly to adjust. When Nora sees them come out, she waves. “Feel better, Castiel!” she calls. “I’m taking you off the schedule for tomorrow as well. Just let me know when you’re good.”
Cas gives him a small smile and nods. “Yes. See you later, Dean.”
“Dean,” he hears Cas say, and then he’s coming inside him, hot and wet, filling Dean up until he knows he’s going to be leaking with it, raw and used. And
“Take your time, man. Migraines are a bitch.”
An uneasy feeling twists in Dean’s gut. “Well, Rowena did say your magical reserves or whatever would run out after a while. I don’t know if it works when the magic just dries up, but there are some drugs that can augment power for a bit, like, uh, vervenalin. There can be some pretty nasty side effects, though. I wouldn’t, um, really recommend it for humans.” He grits his teeth at what he’s saying, but Cas deserves to know about all the options out there, even if Dean has some major hangups about one or two of them. Okay, maybe just about one of them.
He can’t stop thinking about it now, his mind prodding at the idea like a sore tooth (ha, he should start a stand-up routine). “We need to have sex,” he blurts out before he can stop the words, immediately wants to stuff them back into his mouth. Because anyone else in their situation would say no, that they were moving too fast, they were both still vulnerable and aching from the past few months.
Cas wraps his palm around Dean, tugging once, twice, huge and sweaty, and that tips Dean over the edge, makes him choke on Cas’ name as he comes, dick pulsing between them, covering Dean. His thighs shake as heat twists in his gut, fingers clawing at the sheets and Cas’ shoulders.
The two of them crash into the dirt, rolling around. Sam and Rowena don’t get up, for some reason, and Dean flicks his eyes to the side, spotting a crudely constructed altar with a silvery hide heaped on top of it along with some spell components. The hide almost seems to move a little bit, like it’s covering something alive. Maybe a spell is keeping Sam and Rowena immobile; if Dean could just get to that altar…
“Sorry, red,” he says, reaching into his wallet and shoving a wad of bills at her. “If this doesn’t cover a hotel room or a car or whatever, let me know later.”
Nick -- or, Lucifer, he guesses -- lets out a wet, coughing laugh. “How nice of you to show up, Castiel,” he says, baring his bloodied teeth with a grin. And then he reaches behind his back and pulls the blade out. “This makes my clean up a lot easier now that I don’t have to chase you down.”
thing yet, figures that would be an incredibly shitty thing to do to Cas, even though he’d essentially been dumped and left behind. When people asked about Cas, Dean told them that he’d just up and left in the middle of the night with no explanation. Made for a lot of pitying glances, but at least no one kept pressing him for more details that he couldn’t give without accidentally letting the whole “Oh yeah, my ex-boyfriend is a mythical creature” thing slip.
without her here anyway.”
“Honestly, Charlie, I don’t know much more than what I’ve already told you. I saw Cas, he said I had to get Sam and Rowena to stop what they’re working on, but Sam isn’t answering his phone and their office is a fucking mess right now. There’s some blood, and all their spell stuff is trashed, but neither of them are here, so I’m pretty sure they’ve been taken!” He can hear himself panicking more and more with every word as the gravity of the situation really hits him. God, he shouldn’t have kissed Cas last night, he shouldn’t have fallen asleep, he should’ve just gone directly to Sam and told him to stop, and maybe he and Rowena would be here and safe right now. But instead, Dean had been weak, and selfish, and now his brother was missing and it was his fucking fault.
“I died for you, Dean,” he had said, and it wasn’t an accusation, but Dean felt it stab through him anyway, inexorable.
“Damn,” Dean sighs. What a bust. He could still be enjoying his coffee right now if he’d put any thought into this. Of course you can’t do a tracking spell without something to actually
, he wants to say,
Cas rolls his eyes but slides into the Impala. Dean gets in on the driver’s side, turning the key in the ignition and listening to the Impala purr to life underneath him. “All of my Love” crackles across the radio, softly filling the car.
Opening the med kit, he rolls on a pair of medical grade latex gloves, brows starting to knit together. Maybe it was just the lighting in the alley, but Dean could’ve sworn Castiel’s injuries were much worse the last time he’d taken a look. He presses his fingertips lightly into Castiel’s side, feeling for anything wrong beneath the skin.
He keeps the pace slow and easy, adding another two fingers one at a time, stretching Dean open and curling them against his prostate in an irregular rhythm that has Dean panting and twisting beneath him. He murmurs Dean’s name over and over again, voice low and throaty, eyes half-lidded but bright, watching.
of the Impala’s wiper blades over the windshield. He’s so focused on the lines painted on the pavement that he nearly misses the turn for his street.
, and it’s nearly too much.
get along. A wicked glint appears in Cas’ eyes, and he says, “But I don’t think I’ll have to worry about that while we’re here, I’ve got a pretty good plan to tire you out at night.”
By the time the plane jerks and disconnects from the gate, Dean is firmly entrenched in Master of Puppets, eyes shut tight as he focuses on the music. His heart speeds up rapidly, and he grips Cas’ hand tight enough to know that it probably hurts, but that’s the price Cas has to pay to make Dean fly. He should’ve asked one of the doctors at the hospital for an Ambien prescription or something, just to knock him out. An abuse of his position? Maybe. Infinitely better than being conscious for a whole flight to California? Absolutely.
The man grunts as Dean lifts him up, his weight solid and heavy against Dean’s side. He looks down at himself like he’s only just realized he’s naked. “Oh,” he says, a note of surprise coloring his voice, “that’s… good?”
“Dean!”
Dean’s eyes burn, and he blinks rapidly, anger running like fire through his veins. “So that’s it?” he spits, “You’re just gonna leave?”
“What the hell?” Dean stares at the doctor in shock, cup of coffee forgotten in his hand. “How is that even possible?”
Charlie chooses that moment to make her entrance, running through the plastic sheeting with an exaggerated cry, brandishing a small pocket knife and waving it around wildly. She stops, looking around as she realizes that the room is empty of any villains.
Dean’s tired, and his struggling brain is working overtime, because this man is
, can feel the way sparks are beginning to shoot off inside of him. He wraps his arms around Cas, Cas’ name falling like a mantra from his lips, voice wrecked from the hitching moans Cas has pulled out of him. He’s so close, can feel it forming white-hot and inevitable in the pit of his stomach, and he makes himself open his eyes, wants to see Cas when it happens.
Cas rolls his eyes up towards the ceiling, but there’s a smile caught in the corners of his mouth, and when he stands up, Dean knows he’s won. “Alright. One beer.”
They head back to the bunker before going up to Alaska.
“I don’t think so, but we should plan for the possibility. She has expressed her displeasure for the Winchesters on several occasions, after all. There are clearly aspects to her plan she hasn’t told us yet. Getting into her library could provide some useful intel.” Jack’s confession roils unpleasantly in his stomach, but he won’t say it. Jack had begged him not to, after all.
