Dean had about a thousand freckles on his face, layers of them that looked like a healthy tan in some places and like splashed paint in other places. His nose must have been broken at some point because the perfect symmetry of his face was off kilter just in the slightest bit at the bridge. Cas imagined he played football when he was young. Or maybe he was a fighter. His hands are nice, solid, calloused from playing guitar. The knuckles were scarred up a little, but not more than an adult man’s who works with his hands would be. So Dean did something handy. Mechanical, maybe. But his nails were neatly trimmed, probably manicured, and perfectly clean, so he either liked to take care of himself, or someone looked after his image pretty closely. He had a day’s growth of stubble on his face, but the hair was somewhat fine and merely cast a shadow over his perfectly chiseled jaw. This was a man Cas would buy a drink for in a bar. This was a man Cas would want, under other circumstances, to know. And yet the image of his first impression loomed large in his mind. With two mouths already on him, Dean invited Cas, a perfect stranger, to join in.
About half way into his beer, Cas finally loosened up enough to ask, “What happened last Friday night, Sam?”
“Missouri’s son. James,” he said.
As Sam dined with the royal family and met Princess Jessica’s thirteen siblings, including the Prince Regent and their father, the old king, Dean tinkered. He wasn’t about to rest on Sam’s laurels and count his chickens. Dean kept working up until the morning of the wedding. Then, after putting the finishing touches on the little mechanical intertwined doves with flapping wings that he had made as a wedding gift for Jess and Sam, Dean had to submit to one of the royal valets and allow the man to clean the grease from his fingernails and scrape the calluses from his fingertips so he could tie the white silk cravat around his throat without scarring or staining it. Now, as he looked at the great stained glass windows that threw rainbows over the immaculate crowd that included the entirety of the royal family, their mates, and their children, he knew he was a fish out of water amongst them. But even so, Dean stood tall for Sam. He was there for Sam.
“Going where?” Gabriel asked.
Dean smiled slyly. “Weren’t you listening, Sammy? Angels. We’re knee-deep in angels.”
Once the sun had fully set while they were seated around the edges of the hall with their plates and cups, the room grew very dim, and Princess Jessica called for more candles to be brought in.
“Woah. I’m just helping you with the bags so you can get in your door.” Dean soothed in a voice more suitable to a spooked animal than to a man.
“Dean, last night at the venue, I smelled—“
Castiel looked up from the papers to meet his mate’s eyes. “Yes. You. I have drawn them up in your name. Should anything happen to me—I—” Castiel sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “I simply want the peace of mind of knowing I have done everything I could to look out for your future, my love.”
“I see what I see,” Ellen said, smoothing Dean’s rumpled collar. “Now you take care with removing the linens from his wounds. Wet them good with warm water -–not hot—if they’ve stuck.”
Bobby had waved Gabriel off when he offered to send a druggist around with something stronger for Benny, so the three outsiders found themselves on the street under the rising moon at loose ends.
“Good morning,” Castiel greeted.
Not knowing what to expect Dean adjusted his waistcoat, which was too tight but which he wore in a vain attempt to cover his belly, and said, “Thank you, Lord Crowley. I hope you are well.”
"I know you're worried about your brother, but Sam hasn't even been ‘
“Was it drugs? Was he on drugs when I…?”
in poker?! You’re having me on.”
Dean shivered in spite of his warm bath at the very idea and assured Kevin with a nod.
Charlie grinned and leaned in closer, “Dean is grand!” she shared. “He is doing very well at Winchester, and I don’t want to gossip, but—”
Castiel glanced up from his plate and titled his head like a spooked animal listening for danger. “I believe that is the Prince Regent’s hope, yes.”
Sam, happy to talk up his tenants, as if he had been the one to personally select each craftsman to take up residence in the new houses, replied, “Without a doubt, Lord Crowley. Without a doubt. Have you come to look in on the construction?”
Once she was blanketed and saddled, Dean began to worry that Ketch wouldn’t appear after all, but as he led the horse to the doorway, he saw Ketch sitting with Mick as they enjoyed a smoke together. The dispatch was resting on his knee. Ketch took it up and stood when he saw that Dean was ready to depart.
Everyone received a place to sleep and coal to heat and food to eat, no matter if they had a penny to spend or not. Dean had made it clear to the citizens of Winchester that his brother the duke had arranged for their care until they were able to contribute to the town. With Benny and Bobby keeping the peace and Ellen’s daughter Jo and Missouri keeping a watch on the women and omegas of the town, Dean was aware of where aid was required and where able-bodied workers could be hired.
Watching his husband disrobe in the firelight, Dean realized it had nearly been a year since he had first seen Castiel at Sam’s March wedding. Remembering this, Dean spent the rest of the night staring at his husband and blessing his luck, even as he used his mouth to show Castiel his love.
“I heard Captain Ion say something about sending the Prince Regent proof we were married?”
The idea of leaving a mark on Brady caught in Dean’s mind as just the sort of damning evidence needed to get his brother to dispatch his new friend back whence he came, so feeling very unmanly, but also still too damned close to the alpha to get enough room to punch him solidly, Dean’s only recourse was to reach back and dig his stubby fingernails into the alpha’s hands.
Novak’s blue eyes widened. “Excuse me?”
“These boys don’t play, Dean.”
pounds made him feel very rich, indeed. His mouth went dry.
The pause went on long enough that Gabriel got an inkling of his misstep. “You have seen someone deteriorated by this drug, Mister Singer.”
Castiel, dropping his belt to the rug, finally, finally, allowed himself to smile. “Yes, my dear,” he replied, unbuttoning the red coat and pulling his shirt over his head. Regarding the beautiful man on the white sheets, he knew he would never tire of being ruled by Dean Winchester.
Shock and pain cut quickly through the buzz from the shots he’d done. He stood abruptly, sending both his partners tumbling to the floor. He hastily tucked his cock into his jeans, his erection a thing of the past. “What? How...” Dean’s mind was racing and he couldn’t form thoughts or even words.
Dean fell against Castiel and inhaled deeply, allowing himself the comfort of his true mate’s scent.
“You are my backup, Dean.”
It had crossed Dean’s mind that Castiel spent all his time in exercise, writing, and contemplation when he was not with Dean or accounting sums with Sir Rafael. The omega simply reckoned that, as distracting as the impending wedding was, the colonel had redoubled his efforts to keep his cool head and stoic demeanor.
Stopping during the process of removing his shirt to lift it to his face and breathe in Dean’s lingering, intoxicating scent, Castiel suddenly remembered the Prince Regent and the missive Balthazar had brought from the palace. Pulling the sealed note from his jacket pocket, Castiel read the formal script informing him that the request to delay his period of service had been denied. Unsurprised, but unhappy nonetheless, Castiel threw the letter against the wall, but the lightweight paper was an ineffectual vent of his spleen, so then he threw himself onto his bed for good measure.
As Detective Novak drove to the morgue, Winchester sitting silently beside him, he forced himself to work the case. He didn’t believe in coincidences. What were the odds of the musician playing in the same town, on the same night, when Singer was murdered? Yes, he had an airtight alibi as thousands of screaming fans could attest, but his brother... not so much.
"It feels like you carved up my ribcage."
“Must be the prince regent’s answer, finally, to Cassie’s suit,” Gabriel replied.
Dean interjected, “So you’re implying Derek was a star collector.”
“Well, I suppose I will not hold that against you,” Dean replied, earning disapproval from the young ladies but a most radiant smile from Colonel Milton. Under the soft scrutiny of those too-blue eyes, Dean felt exposed, and he looked away. He turned the man’s words over in his mind and watched the shadows on the tablecloth to keep from staring at the colonel’s perfect face. By “some people” he meant the working class folk, Dean’s people, people like Bobby who were perpetually avoiding the revenue men who came tax collecting every season, people like Missouri and Patience who were ever in danger of losing their home because taxes were always every penny they had and then just enough more to be impossible. Bobby, at least, had learned to persevere by living in a wagon so that when the tax men came to inventory him and assess a tax, they couldn’t mark his address in their book, and he couldn’t be made to pay. The courts had thrown out the revenuers’ suits five times for Bobby Singer. What would
“In the meantime, we hired the cooper in town to build some sturdy wagon boxes--”
“Please don’t tell the colonel,” Dean prefaced.
“Well, Your Grace, has no one ever told you to listen to your body when it sends you a message?” Ellen asked.
“Are you up for one more stop?”
“I merely count things and prepare the inventories for—well, I used to do it for Vice Chancellor Lucifer, and at the current moment, I am helping my aunt to prepare a particular report for the Prince Regent.”
“Okay. Anything special about it?”
“Excellent choice, sir. Can I interest you in a hot towel, a comb, a breath mint, or a spritz of cologne?”
“I must go, Dean,” he whispered.
“Yes. So, I want to test these platinum filaments, but since these globes are so large—so much larger than I had meant them to be, I haven’t had the chance yet.”
Dean sighed and saw a door marked MEN and heaved himself toward it. At first the bartender followed like she really was going to hold it for him, but she stopped at the door once she flipped on the light switch and waited there.
"Why should I stay out of it?"
“Oh Jesus fuck!”
“Would young Sam even speak for them though?” Balthazar wondered.
Surprised, Dean laughed, head thrown back and eyes bright as Jess giggled with him.
...in which there is a wedding and the princess shares a precious gift
“I reckon he might be that, now, but inside, he is still a leader and a fighter and a caretaker. A finer man, a fiercer protector, and a gentler husband you couldn’t ask for.”
“A thousand little things will delay a long journey. Trust me, Dean,” she insisted. “At this moment, Castiel is fighting his way back to you and that child.”
Between them, the previous spring, they had filled half of a great ledger book with their numbers, and on the ninth of February, they finished filling the rest of it it: hundreds of pages of information about the people of Winchester, the houses there, the costs of labor and sundry goods. Dean spent a great deal of his immobile hours thumbing through it. Apparently, his brother was a very rich man.
"Suit yourself." But Balthazar, being a good friend, kept his eye on Cas until he had crossed the street.
Here was the commotion he had expected at the castle! At the High Street crossroads, horses and wagons and three sleek little phaetons blocked the cobbled lane in front of the tavern house that boasted a jolly red and white sign that declared it the Winchester Arms.
“What?” Dean tore his eyes away from the ivory dildo.
“You have not read your letters.”
Oh the things he could do to Dean Winchester if he weren’t what he was. It was a shame really, that someone who looked so good was so morally dissipated and disgusting. Cas stopped himself before he openly sneered at Dean. Running a hand through his hair he reviewed his notes for a moment before tucking the notebook back into a pocket. It was still a good idea to check into Derek’s hobbies. If he was into cars, he could have met Bobby Singer legitimately at the salvage yard, and that would take this investigation in another direction.
The man’s eyes were gone.
The trip was completed quickly, with a brief stop at the lake to allow the horses to drink. Dean was almost unseated again when Baby walked shoulder-deep into the water to refresh herself, and he panicked that they would drown. Castiel assured him that not only could horses swim, but also that she was standing firmly on all four feet and was not about to unseat him.
With the little ball of raw opium quartered, Gabriel passed it to the older man to administer. For his part, Bobby nodded to Lord Milton before draining the teapot into a cup. No steam rose from it, and Gabriel figured it was tepid. Bobby nudged Benny to take the pill from him and told him to swallow it down with the cold tea. The smith did as he was told and made a face about it. Bobby slapped the man’s brawny shoulder once before resuming his place at the table.
“Now you have him doing it too!” Sam complained.
Trying to keep the frustration from his face, Castiel turned to the window. The horses had recently been released into the paddock for afternoon exercise, and he watched them play in the tall spring grass. “In exchange for leave to marry your brother, my true mate, the regent has insisted that I lead a campaign in the West Indies to quell uprisings against British trade ships.”
“Indeed,” Zachariah shifted, leaning back. “Distasteful business, that. Besides, I’m sure we can all agree that putting this land to the use of the Empire, to the benefit of the Kingdom, is what really matters. It’s what God intended when he gifted the Empire to us. From our fields, we feed legions. It is the greatest work, the greatest good I can imagine,” he gestured with his wine glass in effusive acknowledgement of his own largess.
“Colonel Milton?” Sam asked.
He shivered and could not help blushing at the image that conjured, and his leg began to twitch.
Dean licked his lips and met Castiel’s eyes again. “I have learned my lesson,” he said, “not to tempt you.” With one arm fully extended to keep some distance between them, Dean placed his palm against Castiel’s chest and pushed him backward toward his room.
“What?” Sam demanded, stepping into the room fully with a gesture to his wife to remain in the corridor.
“No, man. He was shot. Right through his head. He went back to the hotel with the band after you left with the cops, and…”
Detective Novak produced a little notepad out of nowhere and jotted that down like it might be the key to breaking this case wide open.
Sam’s shoulders relaxed slightly and he ran a hand through his hair. “It is not easy, being in charge of my brother’s care. It is such a reversal for us.”
Castiel grabbed his wrist.
“Don’t start that nonsense again, alpha. Put your hand over here. This baby likes the sound of your voice.”
Castiel dragged his fingertips over his lover’s face, memorizing every freckle he could see in the mix of soft and fierce light.
Dean nodded. "So Sam's not involved."
It would do him no good to tear off into the fields, down the towpath, or along the road, he reasoned. He had no way of knowing what places had already been searched and which direction needed attention. As much as he hated it, he decided to remain at the house “to protect” the ladies. He decided that he could fill his time with making a list of things the household required from the capital, since Lady Charlie had mentioned she will be heading there for more supplies, herself. No doubt Balthazar, and probably Gabriel, would want to go with her.
Castiel sipped his wine tranqilly. “Would you be grateful for everlasting life if your life consisted of whippings and laboring? Of being torn from your homes and families and put to work in a stony field with your bare hands? I would not want an eternity of that.”
"Permanently?"
That Sunday, Dean asked Ellen to prepare a cold lunch for him to take into the town, and Castiel loaded one of the wagons with the food and drinks, as well as the people who wanted to go along. He drove Dean, Ellen, Gabriel, Balthazar, the stable boys, Kevin, Claire, and two of the puppies into town. Charlie and Patience had taken their phaeton in earlier that day to help Missouri arrange her new home.
“Jack?” Dean’s forehead creased. “But isn’t that the name of the fellow with the wig and embroidered garters?” He strolled back up the gallery to the portrait of the man with the cleft chin.
“Only he didn’t. Call back, I mean, until Friday night. Then Bobby called me saying the phone call was weird. So I drove over there to listen to the message. You know how Bobby screened his calls.”
“He didn’t feel much like walking,” the man replied in a vaguely Yorkshire accent and a very gruff voice. “Who’s the new man?” he threw in, never having even looked up from his bloody task.
"Sam, I'm Detective Novak with APD, and--"
"A gun has been found on Singer's property."
The betrothed walked arm in arm into the southern pasture where the horses still lingered, unhurried about trekking back to the stables for the night.
Dean yelped, but so did several other people in the sudden dark. Dean’s only recourse was to slip out the French window into the courtyard in hopes of shielding himself in the deep shadows of the night. Within the room behind him, the servants brought at least a dozen candelabras into the wide hall, and the excited chatter rose again.
The omega bore the inspection with a roll of his eyes and waited for Castiel to settle in front of him again. The alpha set the candle down and enfolded Dean in his embrace. The omega trembled slightly, like a wounded animal, but Castiel did not mention it for fear of hurting the fierce omega’s pride.
"So do a lot of people, Cas. We talked about this. It's just part of the baggage I carry."
Dean reached out to the glass and noted it was hot to the touch. Charlie sighed and waded back in to retrieve her waterwheel and set it on the trestle table while she laced her boots back on. Dean bent to inspect it and noticed the core of the wheel was solid copper. He hefted it and was surprised at its weight. To make a bigger wheel that would support more lighting would potentially get very heavy and be impossible to mount or to turn without a raging river.
“Well,” Dean thought aloud, “Like I said, I know that Lady Charlie bought some very fine and thin ceramic pipes somewhere nearby. She might have some familiarity with local factories as a result of doing her electrical work.”
“What do you mean?” he hedged as she poured. “I’m just here for a drink.”
He stopped wondering about it when Castiel put his arm around Dean’s waist, such as it was, and kissed his ear before pulling him in out of the cold and pushing him across the cobbled street to their store.
Eyes focused on the tables, fingers twitching with need, heart hammering with anticipation, Castiel heard the sweetest sound:
, Castiel thought to himself.
“You’re the one who is always grumbling about golddiggers, Dean.”
Dean looked at the Hibachi and shrugged, "I dumped the coals in the pool."
“As I began to tell you earlier, my income, though small, should be sufficient to maintain a family of modest means, perhaps to keep a horse, if you like, two servants, maybe.” He coughed to give himself time to organize his thoughts before he could ramble off trajectory further.
“Baby and Nova?” Castiel smiled curiously, taking the roots in his gloved hand.
“Good morning, Castiel.” Dean took his time gazing in amusement at the man’s half shaved face. His collar was open without a cravat, and his throat glistened slightly from the work of wrangling horses for the past half hour or so. “Where did they all come from?”
Dean brought up a picture of Cas on his phone and held it out to Meg.
Castiel simply smiled and pulled the bell rope. Dean was puzzled, but that turned to shame when Ketch appeared at the doorway. “Ah, Ketch,” Castiel greeted. “Have you, by chance, seen Mister Winchester’s coat around?”
“I was thinking that if we brought in herds of sheep, cows, goats, and horses, we could induce shepherds and herdsmen and horse trainers and the like to settle here, and they could sell the wool and milk and butter and cheese in the shops and markets that sit empty in the town. Soon carders and weavers would come here to find work, and a publican might reopen the town’s public house, and the stables could regain their former glory—” Dean cut himself off suddenly, having realized he was getting carried away. “I mean,” he diverted from the subject of animals, “It might be worth the loss of some of this summer’s fruit to prune back the orchards now, and allow them to recover a bit so that after a season or two, there would be fruit and jam and pies enough to keep a full estate hardy through the winter.”
The noise brought Missouri in from the shop with her heavy apron in place but her gloves off.
“If you go and fetch your own water, the footmen will finish their shoe shining and their silver polishing and get bored. They’ll take up smoking or dicing or cards or whoring. They’ll get into mischief and eventually lose their positions here, either for getting up to too much mischief, or because of some terrible scandalous behavior. They will be cast out into the world without any means of feeding their poor, hungry children. They will turn to pickpocketing or burglary--or worse! Do you want that on your conscience, Dean?”
Cas looked at him, and if he was honest, he was less scared of this than he should be. "I do," he breathed. "I do want to try this with you."
“Cas, please,” he begged desperately, pulling at the wild hair on Cas’s head.
"What makes you think I've got a murderer to catch?"
But when the water craze dried up and Baker’s hospital was shut down, the Revenuers started sniffing around town, very interested in Dr. Baker’s wealth. Around this time in Chicago, the great Al Capone had been brought down by his own failure to pay taxes, so the Revenue Department was feeling its oats and looking for money in places heretofore sacred.
“Yes.”
“Why don’t we step in here for a moment. I have a bottle of water,” and he did have one. It was right there in his hand sweating condensation and he held it out for Dean as he ushered him into the quiet room.
Jessica’s sister paused midway through lifting her wine glass to her lips and stared at Dean, blinking slowly. The duchess beside her wore the same expression, and Dean thought maybe he had some gravy on his chin, so he dabbed at it with his napkin. However, the silence pressed in on him until it was Castiel who gently got things back on course by saying, “
“Saint Mary’s Cathedral Basilica,” Charlie confirmed with a judgmental nod.
She steered him around and down the hall to the restrooms. “Do you gotta pee, mister?”
Dean smiled and pointed out that a dusting of white had begun to color the duke’s hair. Everyone laughed as Sam, confused, tried to brush the flakes away.
The first door tucked into the corner announced itself as
He scoffed. “My ma used to be in service in a grand kitchen and learned to read there. She reads the stories to us before cutting the papers for the shithouse.”
“I’m trying to be impressive.”
Encouraged by Dean’s smile, Dr. Franklin continued, “That young man was running on the deer track on the island, and he has sharp blue eyes, that man. He saw my friends that you see around us here. He saw their omegas and their babies. He saw their little huts and their pens of pigs. And why not see them? No one was hiding on the island because the soldiers live at the hotel in Road Town. The soldiers eat in the taverns in Road Town. The soldiers gamble in the gaming houses in Road Town. The soldiers play in the whorehouses in Road Town. Ahh-ahh, Mister Dean Winchester. I do not speak of your colonel, do I? No. Colonel Milton is not in Road Town. He is there on the hills, in the grass, on the beach, in the water, in my humble hut. Colonel Milton is there each day, running to build his strength and swimming for the tranquility it affords him. Colonel Milton is in the shade beside my door to sip my tea and talk about the maroons of the island. Colonel Milton is not stopping us when we scuttle the trade ships. Colonel Milton takes his troops to the docks across the harbor from Road Town on the nights we set fire to the goods piled up on the docks. Colonel Milton bears it when the governor reprimands him and when the newspapers shred his reputation, and for months, he is the most ineffectual soldier to ever lead a regiment on our little island. Every day the traders lose their money and their patience,” Dr. Franklin laughed.
“I absolutely insist upon it,” her highness said with the clatter of her butter knife upon her plate.
Castiel's face softened and he reached across the table to take Dean's hand. "It's not baggage, Dean. I don't consider it baggage. It's part of the package, and I accepted it wholeheartedly. I should have introduced Claire to you weeks ago."
"I have more things in common with thirteen year old girls than I let on."
“Drinks?”
For some reason, both Gabriel and Balthazar could not hold in their laughter at this statement. At first confused and bemused, soon Dean was laughing with them, and then Sam took back his pipe and joined in.
“And what’s in the background of that photo of the Colt, Dean?”
“I expect he is at the tavern, sir. There was a wedding this morning.”
“Just spit it out, Dad, like yanking off a band-aid,” she instructed sagely.
Dean ran a hand through his dirty hair as he stretched out his back. Soot stained his face and clothes, and spots of blood stood out brightly on his shirt. He shivered in the morning air as he unfurled his body from the position he had held too long.
For a brief moment, the world shifted and it felt as though Castiel were leaning in to capture Dean’s mouth; and it would have surprised no one if Dean had allowed it, then. He was already dizzy from the brandy and his alpha’s scent crowding him in the corridor. Instead, though, the desperate alpha dragged his nose over the top of Dean’s collar and scented him, leaving a hot brand of desire on Dean’s throat, which the omega knew would be his ruin.
Dean blinked. “And he sent you?”
“Tis building up,” Singer confirmed.
Castiel decided to push a bit. “Why wasn’t he at your big show last night?”
Castiel startles. Dean hasn't figured out why Cas is so skittish around Sam, but he's definitely not imagining things.
When they returned to the table, they found Sam had ordered a Family Feast for three, upon the waiter’s suggestion. Dean said that sounded fine, and Eileen picked up the menu to read more about it. Dean had never wanted a cold beer more in his life.
“Dean, unff, more.”
"Uh, no?"
Bobby puts a hand on the angel's shoulder. "Let Sam talk to him a minute. They'll come back in."
Dean dropped the hat back over the gruesome face and sat back on his heels; he blew on his numb fingers and sighed, resigned to lighting a fire where the man in the snakeskin boots had lit one a few nights before. He might as well get comfy and feed himself if he was about to have to lug the man back to his cabin so he could prep a trip down the slope. The dead fella, some kind of a dandy man with his fancy boots and embroidered waistcoat, had constructed a decent little camp, cleared the snow away in a rough circle, dug out a little fire pit and piled some kindling ready to hand.
"You have a tiny house, a giant dog, and good taste in TV. My friend Charlie would love you."
Dean huffs in aggravation. "Fine. I need clothes, Castiel. Is that too much to ask?"
Cas mumbled something incomprehensible against Dean’s mouth, and Dean had just enough patience left to explain. “I finally got you here. If you think I’m letting you get away before I’ve had you in my bed, you’re insane.” With that he ground down and coaxed an absolutely filthy groan from Cas’s throat.
Dean looked up from his task of applying a thin layer of honey to the lesions. These were Castiel’s friends, back from their shooting foray, evidently. Dean cursed internally at being caught without his coat on in Castiel’s bedroom while the man himself was (presumably) bare beneath his nightshirt. It was scandalously improper, but since Dean’s fingers were sticky with honey there was little he could do to rectify the circumstance.
“Maybe we should,” Dean suggested. “I’ve never been much of anywhere. First time I left the mountain was when I found Crowley’s discarded meatsuit and took off for New Orleans.”
“For Robert Singer.”
“I do see.”
“Important knitting?” Dean asked. “Since when is knitting important? Your mother has a lovely shawl already.”
“I thought he just goes by Sam?” Cas says in his low, cool way.
He must have been spotted from the house because a footman waited to take his reins as Dean dismounted. He was saved from pulling the bell cord at the entryway by a cadaverous butler in somber blacks that made Ketch’s charcoal gray livery seem utterly festive. Dean, sweaty and still slightly out of breath, was shown to a parlor where Castiel was engaged in playing a piano while Gabriel and a stocky, soberly dressed man listened. When Castiel looked up and saw Dean, the notes he played staggered and rang false before stopping altogether. In an instant Castiel was on his feet and in Dean’s space.
Dean followed.
Dean groaned and then choked on the sound when Cas swallowed his cock and pressed his thumb into Dean’s hole in the same move. Considering he was essentially one-handed, Cas was fucking talented.
Gabriel chuckled at them, fond of their fondness, but moved toward the back of the house where Benny rested and Bobby read what was apparently the day’s new broadsheet.
Rowena completed her inspection of the lacerations and tutted.
Giuseppe saddled her in a soft leather saddle and paused. Only Dean and Castiel had risen early to see him off.
“Your man is not dead, Dean Winchester,” Dr. Franklin insisted. “Did you forget that I am a doctor?”
On the other hand, the newspaper carried pictures of celebrities that were nice to look at. The Shelleys were depicted dancing a Waltz at Almack’s, and baby Princess Alexandrina Victoria’s christening was celebrated with a large portrait of her tiny face, which Princess Jessica, the baby’s aunt, and Dean both marveled over.
The door crashed open and the security man’s yelling got Dean’s eyes to focus on the scene. In walked one of the hottest men Dean had ever seen. Tall, wild fucking hair, wearing a suit and trench coat. Dean saw more of the security team gather up behind him. “Don’t worry, guys, he’s good...” To the man, Dean grinned and said, “There’s plenty to go around, Sweetheart.” To prove his point, he thrust into a hot mouth.
Dean steps forward and  takes Castiel's hand. For a moment, he stares at the blood, and he remembers.
Duval Street was north of the UT campus, north of the hospital where he'd seen Bobby's body, north of the venue where he'd played his show. Was it only a day ago? The impala rumbled up Sam's driveway and coughed to a stop when Dean cut the engine. He'd have to check the spark plugs soon. It would be good to get some grease under his fingernails.
But then Lady Charlie, buoyed by Missouri’s acceptance, pushed too far. “I shall buy a wagon for you, as well,” she enthused. “To carry all your things to Winchester tomorrow!”
Dean gazed right back and played it cool despite feeling anything but. “Nah. My pa came up here to work at one of the silver mines in ‘92. A corporation mine. I was born on the corporation, and we lived there most of my life. Then the mine caved, and luckily Pa was laid up with a broken foot at the time. The corporation shut instead of shoveling any more money into the mine, and Pa put a claim on a piece of land at the tree line. He didn’t even want to mine it, he just built a little cabin for Ma and me and my little brother.” Dean bit his lip, uncertain about spilling his life story to this stranger. He felt strangely compelled to answer the man’s questions, though.
“Right. Well, I was just thinking through the story. Finding threads.”
“I have arranged with Lord Crowley to expand his system to include the people of Winchester, as well. And, eventually, by using the railway to deliver the goods, instead of the mail coach, once the tracks are established in our county, we will have such an efficient system that we are sure to see a steady and healthy income from it.”
Dean turned to her. “Sam could go there to make them a promise to their faces. For most, that alone would be enough. Those people do not need Balthazar’s money to convince them to come. They need the word of their brother, their son, to tell them life will be good for them here.”
Taking a moment to stand back and watch the newcomers and ponder Dr. Franklin’s strange greeting, Dean helped himself to a plate of bread pudding handed him by Jo, who was working in the tavern that day. Upon assessing the group around the tables, Dean could see that Dr. Franklin was already becoming friends with Lord Balthazar as he spoke animatedly. Beyond that, Dean could see that Lady Charlie and Patience were not to be found, and he guessed Charlie was still having fits over the lamps.
“I am at your service, Dean Winchester.”
“Oh fuck. I forgot about your handicap, big guy. Let me ride you. Wanna come on your dick.”
“No, it’s nothing. I don’t even understand how all these parts work,” he demurred. “Will you show me?”
He heard a muffled noise and stepped closer to it but instantly tripped over a pair of boots.
Castiel eyes it with unguarded interest as Dean piles it onto his plate. "You want some?" he asks, intending to be friendly.
The deputy sighed, looked at his watch, and radioed for backup.
“Well, my lawyer is a lawyer, too. I thought you meant I should call Gabe.”
Distracted as he was that day with Castiel’s coldness, Dean concentrated that much more on the process of preparing the new tiny light globes with platinum filaments and a wash of spirits. Dean hammered the filaments for each bulb, and together he and Charlie prepared the spirits, assembled the bulbs, and sealed them tightly, before moving on with larger versions for the larger mechanisms to fit the three dozen large bulbs Missouri had made.
And then he was gone.
"But what about lunch?" Dean pressed. "What about dinner?" he asked, leaning in closer. "What about dessert?" he whispered right into Castiel's ear.
"I thought I was already invisible to angels," Dean comments over his shoulder to the angel.
He looked to be deep in his thoughts, and their silence remained mostly intact on the path back toward the castle. However, the quiet that hung between them was comfortable and sympathetic now instead of stilted. Dean reckoned that if he had plenty to occupy his mind, then Castiel’s must have been overflowing.
Dean tipped the tumbler to his mouth and let the whiskey roll over his tongue. It certainly wasn’t the good stuff, but that was okay. He didn’t deserve anything good tonight.
“Let’s find out,” the colonel murmured as he stalked back to the house.
Dean closed his lips over the paper straw and sucked hard, the straw clogged with ice cream, and the man cleared his throat. “What about your brother? Sammy?”
“Besides,” Bobby cut in, “Where would they stay if the houses are still being built?”
Castiel gave him the eyebrow and asked, "Moving in with you?"
“I’m telling you, the light in the painting is brightest in the second cave.”
“You don’t need to be here, Dean.”
“I guess that’s fair,” Dean relented, “Since he was the one to read
Dean stood at the hearth to sharpen his pencil with his penknife, making careful, deliberate shavings in order to conserve as much of his small pencil as possible. He was able to direct the shavings into the fire and come out of the exercise with a fine point, though the utensil was yet barely big enough to hold.
Hammers forgotten and shingles dropped, everyone crowded to greet the master and mistress of the house. Whereas Rowena and Ketch had the household servants lined up in an orderly fashion, and the builders hung back around their worksite, out of the way, everyone else jockeyed around the carriage doors, and the entire little herd of puppies barked at the imposing contraption.
“He is to dine at Lord Crowley’s.”
Sam was missing.
“There is no need to take that tone with me, Dean,” the duke pouted.
The detective ran a hand over his face. "Why isn't he answering his phone? Why hasn't he been home? Why were his prints on the weapon?"
“Yes. How would you like to be able to travel from Winchester to the capital in an hour or two?” the alpha asked with his eyes wide and fixed earnestly on Dean.
"What, that they could track the most recognizable car in Austin and follow you to your brother? Jesus Christ, Dean, that whole thing was reckless and foolhardy and ridic--"
“Pardon me,” he murmured, retracting his hand. His inclination was to give the interloper the benefit of the doubt and continue to the house. Perhaps the alpha had the same idea as him and simply wandered outside in search of the privy. But when he heard Mr. Brady’s oily voice, Dean froze in alarm.
It came then to Castiel’s attention that his husband was overdressed. Reaching out for the sapphire pin at Dean’s throat, he began to unwind the thick winter cravat.
Once the wagons had drawn away from the church, their passengers whispering about the unusually quiet state of the grooms, Dean turned to his husband. Calmly pulling the sapphire pin from its knot at the alpha’s throat and stashing the ornament between his teeth before untying Castiel’s white silk in an echo of the other night’s treatment of his cravat, Dean spoke, “I think it will be well for our wedding guests to see the bite upon your throat.” The angry red welt, teased by Dean’s teeth at regular intervals to keep it looking bright, shone starkly against Castiel’s pale skin, but the colonel only raised his chin and showed it off more proudly as Dean wrapped the white silk around his own wrist like a knight of old would wrap his damsel’s favor.
He also picked up his usual supplies: some cereal, dog food, milk, eggs, cheese, bread, butter, mustard, etc. He also grabbed a couple of Armadillo Hibiscus Zinger Botanical Ales to enjoy in his backyard before heading over to Amelia’s place. Satisfied with everything except the outrageous price tag for his meager bags of food, Castiel paid and trudged with it back to the garage.
He disappears from Michael's Sword and reappears moments later in the flesh of a man.
Castiel laughed, and Dean was mesmerized by the wholesale change in the detective's face. He had a crinkly, gummy smile that transformed him from gruff to carefree. Dean wanted that face, was curious, not for the first time what the detective would look like when he came.
The ebony box was decorated with an inlaid mosaic of mother of pearl and ivory with gold filigree and a delicate gold latch. Jess placed it on Dean’s lap and stood back, nodding to him to open it.
“Do you read the newspaper, Jesse?” Castiel couldn’t help but be curious about the state of educational affairs in Winchester.
Castiel stood abruptly. “I must go. I thank you for the tea,” he bowed to the cook, “and I thank you humbly for the ride,” he bowed very low to Rufus, “but as you must return home before nightfall and you do not have time to drive me further, I really must take my leave of you now.”
A road trip sounds keen right about now.
Brady hollered and spat curses, but more importantly, he retracted his hands just long enough for Dean to knee him in the groin and leap over his writhing body and take off up the path.
“Dean, is it?” Sam growled from the settee. “Since when are you on such obviously familiar terms with my brother, Colonel Milton?”
The park was exceedingly warm, though, with all the light heating the area, and Dean soon grew uncomfortable lingering there. He moved on, stumbling upon his destination immediately around the next corner.
“Here I am,” Dean responded. “Were you looking for me?” Normally everyone was trying to get rid of him rather than trying to find him.
"But you said you haven't spoken to Sam in a while."
...in which the alpha passes a very bad night
"My nose is all red," she whined. "My nose is red and runny, and my face is splotchy now, and I would never have worn this shirt! WHY DID YOU LET ME WEAR THIS SHIRT??"
“Yes, sirs?”
Dean sighed and leaned his hip against the shiny black door of his car. "Just tell me this. Any leads on Sam?"
With that she placed a sweating glass of ice cold gin in front of him. Dean gave it a sniff and weighed the pros and cons of drinking it. The other men had flasks and glasses. Staying sober would give Dean a solid advantage. On the other hand, he was damn thirsty, and it would be a hell of a shame to waste good gin. Then again, it didn’t smell like particularly good gin. Plus, Dean couldn’t discount the chance of being slipped a Mickey if he accepted a drink from a relative stranger — and a wily one like Meg.
The stories were lively but shallow, Sam and Jess clearly too tired from the journey to go into great detail. But everyone had questions about their travels, the monuments they had seen, the foods they had tasted, and the presents they had brought back with them. More wine was passed around, and Dean felt the settee beside him move with the weight of another while he was listening to Jess tell her sister and the duchess stories about the types of slippers and the types of stays she had encountered on the continent. Dean blushed at the discussion of underthings, and he looked over to see Castiel leaning into his shoulder.
Castiel looks down at the human's form. It's true that it is free of clothing, but it is well made and pleasant to look at. "Yes, you are," he replies. Then he remembers human shame and looks at his own vessel. It wears a suit and a coat. Castiel removes the outer layer and hands it to Dean.
"What’s wrong with the shirt, muffin?"
Castiel got rid of his boots and breeches, socks and pants, just as the water began to steam. He decanted a pan full of it into the tub and then put the pan over the top of the cauldron to get it hotter faster.
When Lord Balthazar showed up that evening, the jovial mood was still intact. He confided in Lord Milton that the Prince Regent had received Castiel’s letter with glee. It would seem that His Royal Highness could not wait to see his fellow colonel of dragoons in harm’s way on his royal behalf, once again. The brothers exchanged a wry look and then got down to business planning the following day’s affairs.
"Hi, Dad."
Charlie reached out to shore him up, but then she was pushed aside when Dean’s own alpha’s arms surrounded him.
She curtseyed with the hint of a smile on her face. “Twas nothing at all, sirs.”
Dean took a moment to really look around the place. It really was just one big room. The bathroom was divided from the rest of the space by glass bricks. While you couldn't see through them clearly, they would allow the suggestion of flesh to show through. Dean wondered if that encouraged or discouraged the detective from bringing people back here. The bed, right next to the bath area, was enormous and unmade. The rumpled duvet suggested a tempestuous night, and Dean let his mind wander. Beyond the bed, the French doors leading to a spacious back yard with a shining blue swimming pool had a large doggie door built in. The skylight above the bed probably woke the detective early. There were several pairs of running shoes by the door. Suddenly Dean wanted to see Castiel without his baggy coat. And tie. And shirt. And...
"You are afraid. You do not need to fear me, Dean."
“He enlisted soon as his birthday hit in ‘17. Went off to France to save the world. When he got back to the States, he settled in Galveston with a nurse he met on the boat.”
“If it were Sam--” she paused, censoring whatever she had been about to say. When she sat with a sigh on the edge of Dean’s bed, the princess said, “It is well that he left you with child.”
With them, they brought yet more refugees from the city: families they had rescued from debtor’s prison, men they had rescued from the gallows, and small children they had rescued from the cold streets.
Avoiding everyone who wanted to coddle him, Dean sought refuge more often with his sister-in-law. Since Princess Jessica was expecting as well, Dean accepted her company, her hugs, and her advice. He even began to confide in her in a way that reminded him of how he and Sam used to confide in one another before Sam’s scholarship to the university, before he had made new and better friends. As he grew to know Jessica better, she allowed Dean to feel the new, small bump on her stomach, and she patiently answered his myriad questions about what to expect.
There is brisket. It is smokey and moist and falls apart on the fork.
Sam’s face, instead of passive, looked troubled. Dean exchanged a glance with Jessica, and when she looked away, Dean knew that his sister-in-law had been working on his brother. Good.
Castiel shook his head. “I don’t mind being shot, and I don’t mind hacking a man’s limbs apart in battle, but I am a coward when it comes to hurting Dean. When I received the news from the Regent, I told Dean half of it: that the crown will allow us to marry with your consent.” He looked at Sam with eyes the color of the vast oceans he must cross for his omega, “But I could not tell him we must wait two years to marry.”
Dean stared in awe as the glass glowed with a supernatural white light. Charlie admired her handiwork and then Dean’s look of wonder. “Now I just have to get this to work inside the house,” she grumbled.
"I knew it!" she exclaimed. "I knew you were on the case tied to Dean's godfather."
“I’ll take ten grains of it,” Gabriel said, pulling coins from his purse.
Unfortunately, the next morning another express arrived from the capital with dire news. Glassblowers Street was burning. Red coats had swept through arresting absolutely everyone they could catch and lighting fires in their wake. Half its citizens were imprisoned for debts or rioting or vagrancy, and landlords were calling for justice, reimbursement, and hangings. Trials would begin as early as later that day, and the Metropolitan court promised swift justice to the investors who had bought the homes out from under the long-term tenants of the neighborhood.
Once Gabriel pushed through the door and released himself and Lady Charlie back into the not-so-fresh air, Charlie remarked, “I have read about the opium smokers, but I have never seen one.”
Dean guffawed, “You’re not trying to tell me you’re worried about little ol’ me?” he murmured.
“Oh? Would you share them with me?”
Dean drew up short and answered that he didn’t know. He took Castiel’s proffered elbow, however, and allowed himself to be led to the stables. When Baby saw him, she hugged the paddock fence to get close enough to Dean to nose at his pockets. He laughed and took one of the carrot pieces from Castiel to feed to her.
. Despite the fluorescent light of the elevator, the green of early spring bud was striking.
Dean was rapt. “Castiel-- a
“Dean, why are you here? Again?”
Dean showed the walnut to the girl in Chuck’s arms and she watched, mesmerized, as Dean wound a tiny key at the seam of the shell. The walnut opened in miniscule jerking jumps to slowly reveal a tiny carved squirrel inside it spinning round to the soft whir of invisible gears. The babe’s eyes lit up in delight, and she reached out a gentle finger to touch the toy. Dean snapped the shell shut quick-as-you-please, making her squeal and turn her face into her daddy’s neck, but still she giggled. Dean handed the toy over, and her awed little smile of elation and her gentle tiny fingers spoke volumes.
For his part, Dean was no more than an “advisor” to Sam. It was the younger brother who was, by virtue of his advantageous marriage, in charge of the estate. Dean had devoted his week alone at Winchester to learning how the household traditionally ran and thinking about how it might run better, if that were possible. He had deduced that an estate like this could be kept running from the produce of the farm, and it could, in turn, maintain the farm by raising funds from the excess produce. He had drawn this idea as a circular pattern that followed the seasons. Dean knew that such a venture would be long in the undertaking, as the spring planting had not touched a quarter of the land an estate the size of Winchester would need, were she at full capacity. Plus, this plan would mean reestablishing the local market within the township, and more than that, it would mean reestablishing the township, itself. Dean had noticed, on his countless forays around the boundaries of his brother’s new holdings, that the same faces popped up time and again, and smoke only rose from a quarter of the chimneys. Winchester not only needed money, she needed people: sowers, reapers, millers, shepherds, milkmaids, cheese mongers, butchers, brewers, tailors, seamstresses, nurses, teachers, shopkeepers, a publican… Dean’s list went on. The little notebook he carried with him everywhere was nearly full, but at least he had ideas to discuss with Sam when he returned from the continent.
“It is common knowledge,” she confirmed.
Castiel shuts the door on Dean and Bobby, closing himself outside the house to do his work.
From his cot beside the hearth, Benny muttered, “If you need a ring, you’ll have to wait a week or two for me to hammer it.” Everyone laughed and Benny chewed through another bite of the bread, his eyes clearer and his body more relaxed that Gabriel had seen him so far.
Then he sat up abruptly. The wild idea to run naked into the early morning fog and drizzle seemed an excellent solution, but as soon as he got to his feet, the dizziness overcame him and he collapsed onto the wooden chair beside his writing table.
“Butt what? What’s a buttmonkey?” Dean laughed as he got out of the water and shook his head free of as much water as possible.
A soaking sweat erupted over Dean’s flesh, and the omega moaned with wanton desire, further igniting the alpha’s need. Thus lost in a double bond of one another’s swirling desire, neither of them noticed the footsteps, but Kevin’s uncomfortable cough from the corridor broke through the tangible lust.
, Colonel,” he wiped his hands on a shabby little rag, no doubt anticipating an errand.
Dean murmured to himself, “Jukebox, ice clinking on the glasses, a guy at my six telling a lie.”
“Been traveling a while?”
Sam was discharged on Friday, and Dean promptly removed his brother to his house by the lake. He stated that taking his to his own place would end in disaster because there’d be no one to take care of him.
"Mr. Novak, you have several thousand dollars worth of electronics. All untouched. Your Rolex is still on your dresser." The watch alone was worth more than Dean made in a year as a detective for the Austin Police Department. "Let's try this one more time. What were they after?"
Castiel explained that his plan was
Three more from Dean.
In the end, Cas got a Lyft for a ride home, and Dean hovered for a good look at the driver and her demeanor toward Cas when she arrived. He must have decided her threat level was mild because he only planted one sloppy kiss on Cas's mouth when he was getting into her car.
There is an angel watching over Dean.
He caught sight of Sam and Eileen returning to the area of the cotton candy vendor and he waved at them with one arm while dropping his cigarette end with the other hand. Sam’s hair was wild, having escaped its usual carefully combed and waxed stasis. Eileen’s braids were still a tight crown around her head, sweetly old fashioned but elegant, and her face was flushed and bright. They both smiled, though, in that thrilled kind of way one might have after being caught in a sudden spring rain.
Castiel shut the back door once Silla was in. "He has a job," he stated more decisively.
“But, I think to myself that the customs man, the coast guard, and the port authority will not simply allow a ship to sail across that blue, blue water. But then I see there is a second page within that letter. He has drawn this map there,” Dr. Franklin points to the tabletop, “and the paper says what time and what place we men were to go. It tells how to fix that cannon so it cannot fire, how to hobble the schooners that chase smugglers’ ships, how to pass the dock man while the soldiers happen to be distracted with chasing the little boys in Road Town who torment their horses, and then, to keep himself from being arrested, it also tells how the men must fight against the soldiers who are not chasing the little boys.” Dr. Franklin nods. “It says how I, personally, must take Colonel Milton’s bayonet and run him through.”
Dean could feel his heart throbbing in his breast as the fire consumed his body. He grabbed tightly to his alpha’s hair and pulled him ever closer and closer until their mouths were unable to separate. Their tongues caressed each other as their lips grabbed at one another, and Dean felt saliva slide down the corner of his mouth and sting at the bite on his neck. He had just released one hand from Castiel’s wild hair to feel at his bite with his fingertips when he was caught off guard by the fullness of the alpha’s knot thickening within him tightly. The omega, vocalizing his surprise at the sensation, wrapped his legs around his alpha and clung so tightly with all his limbs that Castiel could hardly move.
“That’s not true. Everyone from Tortola worked the fields there. They are experts, green thumbs on every one of them. I’m going to offer each of them to be a field boss for three shillings a week to start. They can teach and manage the rest of the hands.”
The horrorstruck look on Dean's face softened.
“Us,” Dean corrected.
Dean left Meg panting by the window and took his seat back at the card table. He asked the dealer for two cards and settled in to play the game and win it. The night didn’t wrap up until close to three, but Dean walked away with the lion’s share of the money. He felt the weight of eyes following him through the foggy night, more than once imagining the pinstriped fedora and twice as often catching the same red Oldsmobile idling at an intersection.
Dean's face pinkens, and Castiel notices the subtleties of that face: small freckles, greenish eyes, plush lips. It is a pleasing face, beautifully made.
"Stay out of it until I contact you, Dean." Castiel squinted at something on his phone.
In the end, the three gold teeth were deemed more than enough to pay for a funeral and burial. By the time Dean left, he was testy with hunger, and Esther was spitting mad at being left tied up in her harness. Snow had begun to fall in fat heavy flakes, and occasional gusts of wind made them swirl and dance through the sky like little white fairies.
Castiel flopped over and lay flat on his back a moment with wide eyes contemplating the deep shadows on their ceiling, and Dean used the moment of distance between them to reach into the drawer at his bedside and withdraw a stack of papers.
Jessica is the very embodiment of generosity,” he said. “Just look at how kindly she treats my brother.”
It was Dean, of course, who got to Sam first and threw his arms around his brother. For his part, Sam squeezed Dean just as tightly and laughed as Dean teased him about the outrageous shrubberies growing along his jawline.
“Can I interest you in rose-scented soap, lavender soap, or French vanilla, sir?”
Dean felt sad to think of all the secrets Sammy had from him.
"Yeah. What about it?"
“Dean, Dean, you’re so perfect. I love you. I love you,” the alpha babbled while his hands reached around his own back to untangle the omega’s legs at least enough to let him thrust toward the finish line.
Kevin bowed and all but ran from the scene.
She jumped on his reaction immediately, "Oh Emm Gee! You did get a boyfriend! What's he like? What's his name? Is he cute? Of course he's cute. You have good taste, after all. Does he have a job? Mom says that's a super important thing to consider. Well?"
WARNING: (mpreg)
Dean frowned. “Meg, they know I’m bi.”
He took a seat at the tea table, since Gabriel was at the writing desk, and set to work. Dean may not have known much of Castiel’s background, but the alpha had revealed to him that he was wildly fond of the summer wildflowers that bloomed in the churchyard at the Milton estate. Castiel had described poppies and pimpernel, cornflower and dog rose. Dean had envisioned the enchanting blue of the forget-me-not in Castiel’s eyes.
As he finished, he smirked, and Castiel knew Dean was teasing him.
“In this day and age!” the duchess agreed.
"What better way to get to know each other?"
“Let’s say nine?”
Castiel turned off MOPAC Expressway onto Enfield Road. "You turned off too early to get to my house," Dean said, puzzled. The cop knew he lived on the lake by the country club.
"And you took a bullet for your trouble. How's the arm?"
“I haven’t got a precise calculation, if that’s what you’re asking, for one this small. For this small lamp, only a bit of electricity is necessary. There are two problems with it, though. This filament that creates the spark burns up quickly, in less than five minutes.” As she said it, the hurricane lamp, indeed, went dark. “And to power more lamps, I will need a mechanism that makes more electricity than my little water wheel.”
WARNING: (mpreg, birth)
Castiel concluded, “And that’s why you stayed hidden.”
He was snapped out of his musings by the detective’s phone ringing. The man answered with his hands-free feature on the car’s console and muttered “Novak” at about the same time Dean’s phone buzzed.
He gestured for another drink and decided to give up on the flirting. His heart certainly wasn’t in it. He didn’t want anything from the bartender except the booze, and he had probably had enough of that. Dean just let his eyes drift shut for a few minutes, and he did that thing Cas used to suggest.
"No, he's not hiding or something. He's missing. Something's wrong. You got access to his phone yet?"
“You can't hide from me forever, little omega. I smell you!”
A truck goes by and Dean makes a poor attempt at making himself smaller behind the angel.
Cas had a big, happy, proud smile on his face for his two best people, and for his part, Dean smiled his mega-watt smile and dazzled the poor girl by taking her hand... until she began to cry and head back to the door. At first both men watched her run out, and Silla followed her. Then Castiel's face fell, and he felt helpless, but he manned-up and made for the door to follow his daughter and talk her down.
Castiel finished his food startlingly fast and stepped inside his house to change into fresh clothes, even if he didn't take the time to shower. It was after seven on a Saturday evening, so he didn't bother with a suit again, instead opting for gray slacks and a royal blue button down. He might go for a drink at the bar at Jeffrey’s across from the drug store if he left his desk before they shut at two tonight. He walked back outside, checking his personal email on his phone to see if Claire had said anything about her report card. The evening was feeling fresher in the gloaming than it had in the balmy afternoon, and Dean had his little cooker packed up to go.
“I’m no one,” Castiel coughed and continued, desperately hoping to be understood, “I’m the one in this relationship who is utterly without power or privilege. You are part of the royal family now, and the only way the regent would agree to our match was for me to go to the West Indies and put down a rebellion that is taking money from his royal pockets.”
“False. You know all about me,” Dean couldn’t stop touching Cas, and he ran a hand over his shirt, reveling in the feel of the broad chest beneath it.
“The darkies are always trouble,” he declared, slopping wine down his own chin as he guzzled it. “Here we are trying to civilize this savage land, and the filthy natives act like they were happier wallowing in mud.”
At that point, in full pique, Lady Charlie stood abruptly from her chair, letting her napkin tumble from her trousers’ lap, and picked up her hat as if to leave. “Well, much as I thank you for your interest, your highness, it shan’t be done to me! When the Society invites me to join them, it will be because I have eliminated every insipid argument against me with my own ingenuity and cleverness rather than by default to a royal patron.” She bowed very curtly and made to depart, only stopping in the doorway to address Castiel. “Colonel, I shall be returning to the capital tomorrow on an errand for necessary parts that Dea--- Mister Winchester and I need in order to continue our various projects. Do let me know this evening if there is anything I can procure for you on my journey.” She bowed again, placed her top hat over her chignon, and vanished, leaving the two princesses and the duchess still aghast at their breakfasts.
Dean stiffened upon being pushed away, scowling at the rejection, eyes threatening to spill over, until he felt his alpha’s hands gently cradle his enormous belly. Castiel’s expression of wonder and awe as he looked at his omega for the first time in over eight months was a wonder to behold in its own right. He was transcendent with emotion.
His eyes opened.
“I can do it,” the grumpy alpha snapped.
He read the messages from the detective:
“My father was John. His father was Henry. Before that was a Samuel, I think, though that might have been on my mother’s side. I’m not certain.”
“Didn’t,” Dean said, eyes on the feet again. If the colonel kept using his given name, he would soon melt into a hot puddle of desire.
“I see,” Dean said. “You are hoping for Winchester money to make more globes and be able to perform more tests,” he surmised. “But, the light is made by heating the metal and it consumes the filament too fast, right?”
“Have you told these plans to Castiel?” Lady Charlie asked over the last of her cheese tart. “Well,” Dean began with a dreamy sigh after he had licked the strawberry cream from his fingers. “I’ve started to tell him. But every time I begin to describe my plans, he gets flustered and that frown descends upon his brow. Before I know it, he has letters to write or some other nonsense that keeps him away from me.”
Lady Charlie, Lord Balthazar, and Gabriel, Lord Milton, stopped to listen before finding a child to send with a coin to fetch the glassblower.
Dean enjoyed his time with Lady Charlie, but she was often wont to spend days alone with her work. Sometimes he joined her in her workshop laboratory, but more often lately she was snappish. He recognized the signs of impending rut after spending a lifetime with Sam, so he was staying clear of Charlie for the time being.
“Sam loves Bobby.” Dean paused. “Loved Bobby. You’re barking up the wrong tree, man.” The cop inclined his head, but his expression remained neutral.
Sam merely grinned, clearly proud of himself, “I just did, didn’t I?” He winked, and everyone toasted him boisterously.
"Where's Sam?"
The alpha, evidently entranced at hearing his given name on his lover’s lips, was focused so thoroughly on Dean that he did not notice when Gabriel drew close to them and held a glass of the whiskey out for Dean and slapped him on the shoulder. “Come, now, Mr. Winchester,” he said. “Let us catch you up on all the gossip you have missed.” Dean’s eyes stayed fixed on Castiel’s despite his body being guided in the other direction until he stumbled into an upholstered chair and noticed that Gabriel was inviting him to sit. He sat as bid and sipped at his whiskey while they waited for dinner, the true mates still locked in an unsubtle staring contest.
With an eyebrow raised, she leaned in, “You been rode hard and put away unsatisfied. I can see it all over you.”
Castiel cracked up and Dean let himself smile.
She began to turn to leave when Dean stopped her again by asking, “One other thing. The colonel won’t say so, but he has been in quite a bit of pain from the circumstance, and I wonder if you keep opium on hand?”
“Can you even imagine,” the young Princess Daphne hissed, “an omega putting a claim on an alpha like that?”
“Well, colonel. I suppose that’s you out,” the governor delighted. “Of course you’re always welcome here, for as long as you’re in Kingstown.”
“Here, now. Your alpha has had his dose already and is sleeping, finally. The pair of you are more excitement than this house has seen since the night Castiel was born.”
“It is inevitable.”
After recovering from the infection, which had turned quite dicey for a time, Castiel spent his convalescence in Road Town until the end of the month, waiting for his discharge orders to arrive. When the official document from Command arrived, he was delighted to tell his men that they would all be home for the New Year, if not for Christmas. Despite their eagerness to see their families, many of them grumbled about leaving paradise to return to the cold gloom of England in midwinter. Even so, they boarded their ship in good spirits, Castiel still wearing a sling on his arm and using his walking stick less as a fashion accessory than a necessity. They sailed for New York to continue on there for England where the colonel would be cashiered and relieved of duty.
“I haven’t spoken on policy in ages,” Gabriel muttered, more to himself than anyone. “Are you thinking of a coalition, brother dear?”
“Really, man? Are we doing this now? It’s past three.”
“How do you want your muffin?” Dean asked.
Dean turned to Cas, his mouth still wide in awe, his eyes still blinking away the black impressions of Gabriel’s blinding feathers. “That was your brother?”
(“Gabriel, the lights are unnecessary.”
WARNING: (medicinal drug use)
“And that’s our cue to go upstairs,” Dean grinned.
“Mr. Winchester,” Ellen turned to him next, and he jumped at her direct address. He had been standing right at the colonel’s bedside, close enough to touch the man, if he had dared. Stepping back again, realizing too late he was too near Castiel for politeness, Dean waited for instructions. Ellen held up a brass key. “Take this key and fetch an unopened jar of honey from the cellar.”
“I cannot imagine the colonel an infant,” Dean murmured at some length.
WARNING: (medicinal drug use)
, he thought.
“We cannot stay in the castle, my alpha,” Patience said gently. “That is no place for us.”
"All the host of Heaven will be searching for you, Dean." Castiel tilts his head in contemplation and then reaches out to touch Dean's chest.
On Sunday Dean woke up in his chair around noon with a splitting headache, a stiff back, needing coffee, and wanting food. Charlie would be back from Houston today, so the first thing he did was text her to see where she was.
Castiel regards the chain. Michael's Sword belongs to Michael. Zachariah ordered Castiel to take charge of the man. Castiel has removed him from the source of his pain and healed his wounds, and now he should deliver him to Michael, but...
Dean fiddled with his onyx cufflinks and the heavy platinum ring in his pocket. It was about damn time he had the thing ready. Had it really been ten years since he had met Cas and his skinny little thirteen-year-old daughter with her long blonde hair and eyes red-rimmed from crying in panic? Laughing to himself, he watched Cas fidget in the hallway as he waited for Claire, and his laugh turned into a satisfied smile. If Dean looked like the cat that got the cream, he had a reason to. He'd struck gold with Detective Castiel Novak.
Balthazar told Castiel about the burning of Glassblowers Street and the relocation of many of its former tenants to Winchester.
“We should leave in the morning, Dean.”
"The closer to his skin the cloth was, the more of his essence it holds," she explained.
The stranger smiled and then bowed to offer introduction: “Castiel Milton, at your service. I’m something like a fifth cousin of Princess Jessica’s, and since I’m single and literate, the family decided to add me to her dowry.”
Gabriel, quick to understand, moved his brother away from young Patience by dragging at his elbow just as Missouri said to Charlie, “Now, now, little alpha, we don’t have time for that this morning.”
Dean thanked him and turned to the staircase, mounting slowly. He heard a bell sound behind him and heard Charlie giving instructions to a bellhop who was so vivacious he got to Dean’s door in advance of him via the back stairs and had to stand in the hallway to wait for Dean to pass the suit out to him.
“Nonsense, Lady Charlie,” Lord Milton broke in with Lord Balthazar smiling over his shoulder. “I have a five pound banknote right here,” he reached into his breast pocket and began unfolding the paper money.
Once they were refreshed, Castiel prompted Dean once again. “It must have had its delights, passing your whole youth in the heart of the capital?”
Ellen threw her head back and laughed at Dean’s genuine distress. “One thing I can say for your upbringing, lad, you’re decent, through and through.” She tilted her head and regarded him. “How old are you, Dean?”
Sam nodded. “That was also when it clicked for me. I saw a Bio special on El Chavo a while back, and it talked about what a rare and priceless gun collection he has. Still, I’m sure once I was out of the way, they went back and found that firing pin in Bobby’s pocket. I should have gone back for it.”
“Wait, Dean, wait.”
"What happens when you cook?"
Dean smiled tightly and reached forward to rub his finger over the baby’s soft cheek. “He should have been home by Christmas, Jess.”
"It's after seven pm, Detective. When do they let you relax?"
“No, Bobby took some with his phone, too.”
“What problem?”
“You mean it just drains away?” Castiel asked breathily.
Dean found the loud music annoying at this point, though his companion did not speak. The table the man had chosen put Dean’s good ear toward the room, and if the man did start talking Dean would have to face the wall just to hear him.
Novak smiled, and it was like Dean had the wind knocked out of him. He had to take his mug to the sink just to break eye contact, or he was bound to ask the guy out. Jesus, he was never affected so hard and fast by a pretty face.
"No idea, I told you."
Ever the show-woman, Charlie reached behind her mate for the sheet, tugged it down, and released the pre-cranked mechanism all in a single sweeping motion.
“Well? How was it?” Dean grinned at them.
“Do you want me to stay?” she asked.
He dressed swiftly after ministering to his sunburn, combed through his hair with his fingers, and knotted his tie smartly in the fashion the tailor had shown him.
Dean drank the water and remembered, too, to take a breath, and he closed his eyes and enjoyed the utter quiet of the room, the stillness. Then he heard the cop, Novak, shifting around, and he looked up to see him removing his trench coat, and it pulled his suit jacket a little off his shoulder, and there was a soft brown leather holster looking hot as fuck. It was like the guy had a laundry list of Dean’s weaknesses and ticked them off one by one. He pulled up a chair to face Dean.
Dean folds a pile of brisket onto a slice of Bobby's homemade bread and covers it with gravy. "This is what men eat, Cas," he grins as he takes an indecent bite.
“What do you mean as a member of Sam’s household? I have nothing at all.”
“Well this beach was where Colonel Milton liked to swim in the water every morning.”
“Oooh, I read about it in the paper. Singer Salvage.”
“Where’s Missouri this evening,” Castiel asked, after greeting James.
Cas kept approaching as one might approach a wounded beastie: with soft words and slow steps. Finally he got close enough to shove Silla to the side. The shirt had a Raven in flight on the front of it. Cas never would have known it was an album cover, let alone one of Dean's.
"Who are you?"
Oblivious, he grabbed the file folder from his desk where he deposited his jacket, and strode to holding room one. There sat Gabriel Milton with a Styrofoam cup of weak looking coffee and a grin on his face.
Soon the unmistakable slap slap slap of bodies coming together echoed off the uncluttered surfaces of the room. Dean grunted loudly with each of Cas’s thrusts and dug his fingers into the bedclothes for traction. Cas held himself over Dean with his good arm, but soon it trembled from exertion and the imminent onset of bliss.
El Chavo was a notorious Central American drug lord. The United States identified him as Belezian, but Belize disavowed him and insisted he was Costa Rican. It was all semantics, anyway, considering his vast acreage of growing fields were in Colombia. Although no one was sure where El Chavo hailed from, everyone knew his face, Sam included, and when he had spotted the mustachioed man with heavy black eyebrows he had known he was in trouble. Of course, the man shooting Bobby in the head was also a dead giveaway.
“Well,” Cas considered. “Suppose you exchange smoking for something else you like.”
“Good morning, sir.”
“He’s Detective Dean Winchester.”
He even heard it in Cas’ voice: “
“I—yes, of course. I suppose I always thought I would arrive back here before him and the other men. Did they all make it?”
Castiel takes a step toward the man and spreads his wings threateningly. Puffed up he growls, "Back off." This is his charge, and he would take it seriously. When several angels startle backward, Castiel is reminded that he cuts an impressive figure as a soldier. One of his lieutenants steps forward, "Go on, now." Another soldier joins in, pressing against the crowd, "You heard him. Clear out."
"These are legitimate questions the public needs to know. Another?"
“--coffin. Yeah.”
He wished he hadn’t.
"Duh. You work homicide."
Dean was booted and brushing Baby in no time, having paused ever so briefly in the kitchen to grab two leftover sticky raspberry and oat muffins from the basket by the door. Baby ate hers in short order and nosed at Dean’s pocket for the other one, but he was unwilling to give up his own food, considering this scheme would likely mean he would miss dinner.
Before Dean can finish the thought, his stomach has lurched again in a way that makes him wonder if he'll lose his tacos, and when he reaches out a steadying hand, he finds he is touching Bobby's door.
She blew a quantity of air and spittle over his shoulder and rubbed her cheek on his makeshift scarf, so he took it as permission to mount, grabbed her mane and jumped for all he was worth. Barely seating himself, he grumbled a little, “Damn you’re tall,” and then squeezed with his knees to steer her toward home.
“I told you, Dean Winchester. That sun is always bright, and that water is always warm. You can believe he was swimming in October, just as he would be swimming today if he was still there.”
,” he thought for a moment, “with the shorter fellow. Is he Lord Milton?
After a few moments of blinking stupidly, Dean responded, “Whist? I will. Yes. Whist.” He pushed himself free of Castiel’s searing embrace and ran a hand through his mussed and sweaty hair.
"We rarely eat, but many have a predilection toward manna."
Charlie subscribed to the newspapers on express in order to keep a keen eye on the goings-on in parliament and at the Old Bailey. On the one hand, Dean was grateful for the uninterrupted stream of news. On the other, the daily arrival of the express rider frayed his nerves to their very ends. He had to train himself to stop thinking that when the bell rang it signaled word of his alpha’s death.
“To collect some things for the journey.”
He fingered the sapphire ring jangling in with his coins, his finger momentarily slipping into it. In the same moment, a chilling breeze, colder by far than the prevailing air about him, crawled down the back of his neck. It sent a shiver over his sun-cooked skin. He thought he heard a ruffling as of a pair of giant wings passing within reach of him, but when he looked around, there were no gulls. Not even so much as a pigeon.
Dean groaned. “What are the chances of airing this one out in time for church in the morning?”
"Can you take me to--"
Castiel pushed his spoon through the cold asparagus soup with his wounded arm and bit his tongue. It would do him no good to rail against the governor, or throttle the man, or better yet, whip him before he has had a chance to win his money at the gaming table. No, Cas had to bide his time and then politely take the man’s money at the end of the night. The green tinge of the soup reminded him of Dean’s eyes, and that alone kept him focused on his goal until Lord Zachariah, seated to Castiel’s right, spoke up, too.
Dean shrugged. “I like old movies.”
“So we are not cousins.”
Dean frowned and then muttered, “I guess it was foolish of me to assume that granting Sam the title to lands that some distant relative of ours once held was a gesture of good will and belief in his abilities to govern it.”
“Oh,” Dean said, as if suddenly remembering something. “Give me your accursed red coat while you take your damn time undressing.”
“You know?”
He smiled softly. “I suppose I am now nothing more than a glorified bookkeeper.”
Dean smiled and leaned forward to rest his brow against Castiel’s shoulder, content to be in his lover’s orbit and sure of his feelings.
Dean stopped talking abruptly and lifted his teacup for a sip, but found it was dry. Turning the pot upside down revealed they had long since drained it. Dean looked longingly toward the door and contemplated fetching a pitcher of water, but Castiel saw all of this play out in his true mate’s mind and curtailed his action. Breaking the spell of quiet that had been conjured by the sharing of painful memories, Castiel directed Dean, “Ring the bell, Dean.”
When their wagon returned from the capital, Missouri was there in the castle yard to greet it. When Patience saw her grandmother, she ran crying into her arms. Lady Charlie’s hair was tumbled from its chignon as she disembarked from the seat to begin helping Mick and the stable boys unload tired people and greet the next wagonload of them that soon arrived with Benny at its reins.
“With as free-handed as Cassie appears to be, maybe his grace had it right, in the first place,” he quipped, noticing the way Castiel touched Dean.
stop it, but he stood and let the scent of chlorine from the pool and leather and exhaust from the Impala and alcohol from the ale they’d shared envelop him, and God help him, he let Dean Winchester’s lips meet his own.
Duke of Winchester and put his finger to his chin as Jess had done. How many times had he done the same to Sam, annoying the boy, as he grew into his features in his teen years? To Cas before he left?
Dean smiled, pleased to have impressed his alpha. “What is this rope?” Castiel tugged a third cable that dangled from the center of the ceiling, and when it clicked, the room filled with bright, white, light. Castiel threw up a hand to shield his eyes but soon blinked and looked around the room. Despite the fact that it was still late afternoon, the room had been dim before, but now it was as bright as the beach at Road Town.
He hadn't expected to see Dean's classic '67 Chevy parked on his street, and he was especially surprised when he entered the back gate that led to his carriage house because Dean Winchester himself lounged by his pool with a little hibachi grill set up beside him with roasting onions wafting a mouth watering aroma into the air.
After an hour or two of this pattern, they turned out of the town and toward the back acres of the Winchester estate, facing long stretches of empty paths. In their solitude, Castiel cleared his throat once or twice as though about to speak, but then said nothing, leaving Dean with an itch of discomfort that the impression he had seemed to make on Castiel back in the parlor had been erased by his filthy familiarity with the common folk.
“Even then, Cas? In the church?”
With that Castiel bowed once more, to the kitchen, in general, and to Garth, and darted out the back door. He found the old familiar towpath easily despite the covering of snow, and he ambled as quickly as his body would take him west toward Winchester.
“Gabriel, Lord Milton,” she replied. “Come to save us all from debtor’s prison.”
Winchester blinked. “You better tell me everything.”
Suddenly the feather was no longer in segments. It was one solid, beautiful, shimmering length, as long as Dean’s arm from shoulder to wrist. He reached for it as Pamela swept the old bits of leaf into the fireplace and sprinkled Holy water on her tea tray for protection.
Gabriel rose from his seat and went to the street to summon one of the boys loitering by the cheese monger’s shop. He selected a ha'penny from his pocket and held it high as he spoke with the lad. After having the boy repeat his instructions back to him, Gabriel handed the coin over with a promise, “I’ll give you a shilling when you return if you get everything right and thriftily.” The boy’s eyes went wide as his mouth went slack before he took the coin and ran off to complete his mission.
“Automatons! Imagine!” said the youngest princess with a beaming grin.
“You didn’t send them?” Cas asked.
For his part, Dean was barely able to waddle across the road from the general store where he spent most of his time with the few shelves of staples and the WCM Catalog available for townsfolk to peruse. Lately he had not even bothered to pass through the curtain from his sitting room to the store front, relying on the glass bell on the shop door to alert him of customers. Instead, he stayed wrapped in a blanket with his feet propped up tinkering with a new toy design he could sell. But by the end of the day his ennui got the better of him and he could not be dissuaded from joining the dinners at the tavern.
"I'm just a soldier," he says.
“The suit and the boots might be worth something down at the second-hand shop,” Ash suggested, ignoring Dean's question.
Dean looked at the gentleman, tried to fashion a smile onto his face, and waved before beating a hasty retreat back into the house.
“Dean,” Castiel reached out for his mate’s hands and held them in his own. “Please understand, though. I have not had
Castiel glanced at his brother-in-law but then his eyes honed back in on the stomach between his gentle, trembling hands. “Sam, Dean’s pregnant,” he whispered, amazed.
“Welcome home, sir,” said a voice near the stove. Castiel squinted into the heart of the kitchen and saw little Kaia with a dishtowel in her hand. She curtseyed when he looked at her.
“I s’pose I’ve heard of babies needing both the alpha and omega scents to be healthy.”
The party laughed and "awwed" and Dean's face turned red, but his smile was pure. Castiel felt his vision cloud but he hid his face in Dean's neck until it passed, happy to have his true mate in his arms and kind friends by his side. How was he ever going to tell Dean it would not be this summer but two years hence that they would be wed?
He let his mind wander to the coming weeks; while Sam and Jess were away for their honeymoon, Dean would relocate to Sam’s new holdings at Winchester castle to begin his role as Sam’s “advisor,” whatever that would mean—Sam was never much inclined to ask for Dean’s advice on any subject these days.
Dean pulls the trenchcoat closer around himself and curses. "What the fuck, dude? I need clothes."
Dean nodded and took the seat offered to him. “You owe me no explanations, alpha,” he remarked, but the words were hollow as in truth he was ready to finally hear about whatever his alpha had been up to.
“That’s of no import to you, Mistress. Instead, I pray you explain to me the odd occurrence of several of this house calling Colonel Milton by a greater title.”
“Cas-ti-el,” Dean mimicked. “Thanks. What about you? You got any family?” Dean asked before returning to the task of sucking the ice cream through the straw.
Dean laughed.
It was Ellen who came to him when he rang the bell. Kevin must have told her to bring the drug because she was ready with it. Dean paced in his nightshirt on the soft rug beside his bed, unable to settle or stop the itch beneath his skin that wanted his alpha. In his mind he envisioned himself a mass of gears wound too tightly on their spring and stuck at full speed for too long, growing hotter by the moment as the metal pieces worked against each other in fantastic fury.
Castiel coughed and looked away under the scrutiny of Dean’s earnest gaze. “When my father died, he left sundry investments to me as my inheritance. All told, they do not measure up to much any more, as his business dealings were mostly plundered by the crown. But with that income and my wages from managing the Winchester Estate, I have just under a thousand pounds a year, which, though not very much, is sufficient for us to establish a modest household, especially here, out of the city.”
"He wants to ask you some questions. I recommend inviting him here," she said, "because the more we can keep you out of police stations the better."
Uncomfortable with such personal gain while others still suffered, Dean and Castiel quietly took their quarterly profit payments from Lord Crowley and used them to fund the abolition efforts on Tortola. They were delighted to continue the funding even after slavery was abolished there in 1834, for a school and eventually a university—the first on the island. The Winchester endowment was the source of success for many generations of men and eventually women who were victimized by slavers and slavery, who were maroons or fugitives, who were oppressed and brutalized by the Empire.
“Dean, this is ingenious.”
Dean was suddenly uncertain how much he should say. Would her father be glad to learn that Patience is mated to a highborn lady? Would he be angry? Parents were a thing that puzzled Dean, not being intimately familiar with them from his own life experience. He settled on answering in the affirmative and waxing on a bit about how lovely she was before expressing a need to return to the tavern and see to the party there, since Dr. Franklin had asked for him by name.
“I have seen men shot with the massive balls of lead like Bobby Singer pulled from Benny’s leg yesterday. Chances are good that he is quite unwell today.”
“Not kidnapped.”
Dean’s field of vision narrowed to the pink lips pronouncing his name and then to the blue eyes staring at him, even as his breath hitched and his tongue darted out to wet his own dry lips.
Dean also made himself useful to Lady Charlie when she needed someone to reach up high or climb into a fireplace. He was not nearly small enough to fit up a chimney as he had done as a lad, but he was not squeamish of ash and spiders and had no problem even reaching his bare arm blindly into dark spaces to feel around for Charlie’s dropped tools or wires. He was interested in the electrics as well. It seemed fantastical to think she might be able to light the house without flame, to brighten even the dimmest room without the yellow glare of gas or the soot of candles. She described to him the way the chandeliers in the grand ballroom would sparkle without the maids having to remove each crystal and boil the wax off of them after a grand party.
It was Clare who spoke first. “Have you ever heard of an army colonel using a stove like that?!”
He also made it his business to settle the new tenants as well as he could, making sure they knew where to get the goods they needed to start their own homes and how to get the money they needed for those things if they were broke.
At least that’s how the children’s fairy tales went.
Soon enough, in regards to a house party, a plan began to form, and Castiel agreed to play the first quadrille of the evening. Even Charlie confessed to being able to play some “old tunes” passably well for the second half of the night.
“What are you doing?” Charlie asked.
“Look,” Dean said, pointing to a brother of the eighth duke. “This fellow is a Dean.”
“Your skin is so dark, you look like a heathen!”
“There is nothing I like better than keeping secrets from my brothers.”
“Sam isn’t aware of your allergy?”
“It’s expressly addressed to the colonel. You mayn’t read it.”
Cas scanned the report, and his eye caught on the class in question. "English class, Claire? You made a seventy-seven in English?"
“Cassie told me the two of you are working on a plan to revitalize the town, but before he could bring new people here in good faith, he insisted they have places to live where the roofs don’t leak and the fireplaces are wide enough for cooking and families have rooms to put the children in for sleeping. Plus, look, there are courtyards for laundry and bathing, and outhouses that are easy for pregnant omegas to get to.”
Dean listened and followed Cas from the old kitchen through a closet doorway into a bedroom with antique brass twin beds.
He missed Bobby and Benny and the easy access he once had to small scraps of metal and the means to melt them. The number of times either of them had forged a new tool for him was uncountable. Luckily, he had his own little crucible in which he could melt something soft like gold or copper, but of course gold was hard to come by. He had his bits of copper from Lady Charlie, but without his missing tool, they were useless to him now. His fingers ached to work, but there was nowhere local to get what he needed, and he had long since run out of coin, anyway.
“Just about every GS.”
Dean caught the idea quickly and articulated, “Electric lights in the town!”
“It was a shock to you, wasn’t it?” Jessica pressed. “You were completely stunned when Dr. Franklin told his story.”
Charlie waved him off, “Yes, yes, obviously, but do you know what makes the light?”
The sheriff herself was roused from her night off with her family to listen to the story and tell the deputies how to handle it. In the end, Luc and Mike and Cas were put in cells for the night because Luc insisted on pressing charges against Cas for the purpling nose that deformed his face. They couldn’t get the judge until the next day, no matter how much Dean tried to impress the sheriff with his shiny APD badge and detective business cards.
After tacos, which the angel said tasted like molecules, Dean wants to know what will happen next.
"Shouldn't you go and find him, Zachariah?" asks one of the older angels.
“It’s positively medieval,” the Duchess Amelia, grumped with a look on her face like soured milk. “I mean, not only does no one bite anymore, but even on old people with bites, it’s only ever the omega.”
Dean lurched to his feet and flung himself away from the cop’s vehicle. "Fuck that." He raced up his front steps and disappeared inside the house. Castiel shrugged, got back into his Trailblazer, and headed down the drive toward the exit gate. As he turned onto the main road, he caught Dean’s garage door moving in his rearview mirror.
"Go change, Sweetheart. You're a mess.”
"YOU are the human who has been tortured in Hell for thirty years?"
Dean nodded without really listening.
“Cas!” Dean screamed when he was overcome with a feeling like nothing he had ever brought upon himself beneath his threadbare blanket in the night. Cas watched Dean unravel with his kiss-swollen mouth wide open and his lust-dazed eyes half closed before he, too, was overtaken with exquisite bliss. Incapable of shouting his mate’s name, Castiel merely yelled a syllable of nonsense before collapsing onto his mate and allowing the waves of ecstasy to wash over him, hips still working of their own accord.
"It is not. Wait here."
The angel disappears. Just, poof. Disappears. Dean blinks and considers making a run for it, but he'd be picked up in a heartbeat, and Sammy--
"Then tell me what that soldierly brain is thinking, Cas. I know you've got ideas," Dean urges.
Once she served the meal, chicken breasts with an herbed cream sauce, wilted kale with lemon and pepper, and an orzo with almonds on the side, Cas dug in heartily and complimented her profusely. He had seconds of the orzo and kale, and Claire was delighted.
“Colonel,” the voice at the door came again. “Sir, do you hear? We must depart within the hour.”
Dean watched Castiel take the bundle stiffly. “Is it your officer’s coat?” he asked his husband-to-be. “Are you wearing your uniform for the wedding?” Dean had envisioned Castiel at their wedding in his blue tailcoat, but if his alpha wanted to wear red, well, the colonel would surely be dashing in his uniform.
On that first night that Castiel was home again, the reunited couple slept over in their old room in the castle for convenience’s sake. It was bliss simply to bask in family (and because Castiel was so smitten with baby Victoria that he fell asleep holding her), but at the end of the following day they officially moved into their house at the Winchester general store.
“Like I said, if you can think of people who had a grudge, anything personal that might have caused trouble for Bobby Singer, anything at all.”
By the time night fell across the house, Dean had grown sore from sitting in the hard copper tub with his knees bent all day, and he determined that he must have the laudanum if he was to sleep.
"Ooh, work or play?"
“We should be able to prevent the platinum from burning. It will keep just at a glow, as you said, but not flame up and be consumed in fire if something that burns at a lower temperature burns up the air first. It should give your platinum strip a prolonged life, too. If it can’t catch fire, it can glow for hours!”
“Charlie! It’s Brady! He’s after me.” Dean righted himself and took the torch from his pocket and wound one gear and pressed the button to release a few seconds of light and reveal himself.
_____
"No, she likes to impress me. She thinks I don't eat on my own."
Cas sighed. “I hate to accuse them. I don’t know them very well. But as much as Grandma Hester used to tell us wild stories about her dad Dr. Baker, Naomi used to always add on to those stories with shameful secrets. She’s the one who claimed Granny Amara never had scarlet fever in 1903, and that the IRS were on their way to the house to arrest Great-Grandpa when he disappeared. She’s what you might call the family shit-stirrer.”
The next day, Dean rose early and practically raced down the stairs and out the back way to pick some early carrots from the kitchen garden before skipping to the stables. Adam’s mother, Kate, who tended the weeds and herbs that grew in the small beds outside the kitchen door swatted his hands but laughed as he dodged her and ran down the slope. He fed the draught horses the little treats as he greeted Mick, who was busy wrapping Nova’s foreleg in the same kind of linen he had seen applied to Castiel’s feet the night before. Beside the giant gentle mare, her erstwhile foal, Baby, who was now larger than the dam, nosed at the dirt for bits of corn forgotten by the hens. Mick hoped to breed Baby in the coming summer with a stud at Lord Crowley’s estate downriver from Winchester, but with the looks of the early sprouts in the fields, the fee for the stallion wouldn’t be gathered in time. Dean knew all of this from earlier walks down to the stables. He was drawn to the horses in a way he couldn’t explain. He had grown up too poor to be near any beasts larger than a goat, but Mick was always kind to let him comb the horses' manes and feed them tasty treats.
Gabriel shrugged and took his friend’s arm to steer her around a dozen little piglets and their fat sow. “It’s fine if you do not take it raw, I think,” Gabriel said. “I have smoked it dusted over hashish, myself. I understand the attraction, but some men are so lured to it they become like the Lotus Eaters.”
“Yeah.” Dean put three nails between his lips and lifted his hammer to place the fresh cut board in its spot.
Dean pushed back from the table and went out to the work shed to see if his tools were in place. He bought things when he needed them, but he loaned them out when he didn’t, so he was never really sure what tools he had. His mitre saw was in place and clean. He flipped it on and off again to hear it buzz, and then he took off toward the garage to get the wood. If that was the tool, he had, that was the tool he’d use.
“Prison.”
"No, Dean. Go home. Keep yourself available, but keep your nose out of my investigation."
Those too blue eyes filled with tears and that beatific look of awe returned to his face. The man leaned forward, the hard edge of the copper tub digging into his chest, and placed his face against his baby, just as he had done in those first moments in the tavern.
Dean followed the sound of his brother’s voice in the darkness and found him hunkered down between some old bookcases behind a desk.
“Tired of mountains, I think,” Dean answered. He still felt boneless and sated after Castiel’s latest anti-smoking treatment.
Dean laughed, “Wanna wallow in filth with you.”
, and back to Enfield was uneventful, but when he pulled his Trailblazer onto West Lynn and saw the ’67 Chevy sitting in his usual parking space Castiel sighed. “What now?”
"All we do is write these stupid reports."
"Where is Michael?" the demon asks.
“What time?” Dean asked.
"He was a father figure, shielding you from trouble.
“So your cousins resent that you and Gabe are well-off and they aren’t.”
There was also a poster for a reward on a man with a stunning face. CJ Novak, it said, wanted for huckstering and hawking snake oil in Utah. Dean blushed just looking at the drawing because after what he had just read in the broadsheet, the solemn brow, straight nose, and thick lips on the Novak character teased the taut edges of his carnal desire. The man’s eyes were drawn round and clear as crystals, and the hair was raven black. Licking his lips, Dean carefully folded the thin page and put it alongside the broadsheet in his vest.
Bobby had brought along all of the past month’s broadsheets from the city, which Balthazar, Gabriel, Castiel, and Dean read and discussed throughout the sunny afternoon. When the politics made Dean anxious, he busied himself with the puppies, old enough to start learning to obey commands. He had brought them to keep Benny and Missouri company, but also to watch out for them. Considering that much of the town was still vacant, they had no neighbors to watch their backs, and Dean was still shaken by the events of Brady’s prowling and the vague murmurings of footpads in the area. The puppies weren’t good for much other than barking and eating scraps, but that would be better than nothing.
The candy was too sweet, so Dean let it tumble on the breeze over the rail and down to the sandy beach below. He lit a cigarette instead and leaned with his free hand in his pocket while he smoked beneath the electric lights. The roller coaster rumbled by while Dean mentally counted the money in his pockets.
“I don’t know, man. I went by his place, and—”
Dean thought about it. “I had some apple jelly with one of those tea cakes you liked when you were over. And… Oh, I had apple jelly again later. Just a spoon of it without the teacake. I had some milk toast and…. well, this.”
Trina walked down to where one of the locals had just left and picked up the folded and refolded
“Novak,” finally came to him and the owner of the name raised one eyebrow at him. Dean felt his stance straighten just at that look.
“I thank you,” the man said and bowed before lurching forward to grab Dean’s hand in both of his own. He bowed again, deeply pressing his brow down upon Dean’s hand. “I thank you with all my heart, sir. I am Doctor Franklin,” he stated and then turned to motion to his friends.
“Oh come, now Cassie,” Gabriel groused. “You know we are better marksmen than that! But do tell us why our handsome host is washing your feet like the Magdalena. Is this a service on special offer for all guests?” The man waggled his eyebrow and laughed.
...in which the lady is challenged with a quest
"Don't be impressed. I rent the carriage house in back. It's one big room, but it includes the yard for my dog, and the yard is half an acre."
“What about the feather you were just talking about?” Sam cut in across their bubble of joy, and Dean reluctantly let Cas rise to his feet and turn around to sit beside him instead of on top of him. “Can I see it?”
That morning he got egg, cheese, tomato, and onion tacos with fresh coffee and looked around for a newspaper. There wasn’t one, so he tuned his ears to the local gossip from the other regulars. Castiel loved his neighborhood and his mornings at Nau’s. The best part about the place was that no one took issue with his sweaty, bedraggled appearance when he got there.
Dean's eyes betrayed his hurt, "Because I'm promising you, Cas. I told you I want you, and I meant it. I keep my promises for the people I want in my life."
Rolling her eyes at him and handing the reins off to Mick, she replied proudly, “It’s a gift for my omega bride.”
"Dean, what are you doing?"
"No tea to spill on this one, Cassie?"
Gabriel leaned over the paper, “...ranging from two pounds to twenty!” he muttered. “Where are any of these people going to get twenty pounds?”
“Is it true you freed a colony of slaves and bought them a ship to escape on?”
“Yeah, yeah.”
“Maybe. For all I know, someone in the family has already taken whatever might have been hid there years ago. Decades ago. But what else could someone want with a forty-year-old Polaroid?”
“Dean, why did you come?”
“Sir, I cannot.”
Within the dark and sooty confines of the smith’s shop, a bearded man in rough, homespun woolen trousers and a thriftily patched blouse with sleeves rolled past the elbows bent over a man in pain—obvious by his ashen face and the throaty groans he emitted. The source of the pain was evident. His left thigh was cut open, just below his breech, and the bearded gentlemen probed into the tissue for the bullet.
Bobby Singer looked askance at Lord Milton with the opium in his hand as if to weigh Gabriel’s intention.
“Railway?”
Dean read Castiel’s countenance as Castiel read the words on the page.
Cas made a face and stared at Dean for several moments. “Would you like to come back to my place and help me sort the coins and jewelry?”
Rowena put a stop to his efforts and ordered Castiel to move the omega upstairs. When Cas bent to pick Dean up, he squeaked, “Don’t you dare! Just walk behind me on the staircase, alpha.”
Dean explained, "Paul McCartney once said in an interview that he wrote the melody for 'Yesterday' using a place holder for the lyric. So the song, at first, was 'Scrambled Eggs.'"
The ancient straw and rope bed was lumpy and uncomfortable beneath Dean’s back as the ropes separated and unraveled. The moldering stuffing began to burst out the seams of the cotton casing, but Dean hardly noticed it. The unearthly pleasure between his legs was enough to eclipse everything else that his senses catalogued in the periphery of his consciousness. Not the rain nor the thunder nor the guttering little candle nor the bed could distract him from the power of Castiel’s thighs and the slide of his flesh over the muscles that stood in bas-relief under his skin.
“It is multicolored,” Dean insisted. “In the bright light.”
Following that, the town of Winchester was utterly giddy on New Year’s Eve at the prospect of receiving its master and mistress and their wonderful friends who had made the town such a gift of a place for them all to live.
Once everyone was occupied, Rowena made one pot of her own herbal tea and took it up the stairs. After a few moments, Castiel reappeared in the kitchen and told Jessica he had been booted out in favor of her. So the princess dashed up to assist with the birth.
"Absolutely."
His eyes were doubly blind in the dark, his vision covered with black splotches left over from the bright white light of the headlights now gone. Cas reached the black sedan without being able to get off another shot, not knowing where Dean was, and miraculously without getting hit again. His arm had begun to burn and throb where the blood escaped him. He had to finish this before it became too much and he ended up out for the count like Sam.
“And I got to thinking about where Gabe and I used to play hide and seek in Grandma’s house.”
As luck would have it, Dean was outside when Charlie drove up to the castle. When she was still too far away to hear anything other than his shrill whistle and make out the slow arc of his wave, Lady Charlie could not stop her smile. Soon, she could see that Dean was pretending to play with the puppies that were flocked around the princesses and the duchess on a blanket on the grass, but it was obvious that all of the omegas were actually entranced watching Castiel and Sam fencing shirtless in the late sun.
"This one was recently discharged."
The door opened, and at the same moment, the mechanism of a pistol clicked.
The drive back to Austin was taken up by less of the awkward silence than the drive up had been. In fact they argued a little when Dean insisted the first person Cas should call was his brother, and Cas insisted he should call his lawyer.
He mimicked her outrage, "Claire!" and she threw a sprig of parsley at him.
Dean said, “Next, take that piece of paper and pencil you put on the pantry shelf back to your desk before it’s misplaced and you make yourself mad tomorrow trying to find it.”
He isn't expecting Bobby to take it back from him as it's still ringing. "Let me," he says.
Within minutes the room is clear.
Much of the chatter around the room is relating to Michael being late, in fact. They are expecting an envoy from Hell, if rumors are true. The press of bodies and crush of wings indicates just how thrilling the prospect is. Everyone wants to be able to say they were there on the day an emissary from Hell entered Heaven.
“I was outside,” Dean began, “in the garden when that alpha grabbed me—”
Dean stopped and looked at Silla and looked at Cas and threw his head back and laughed.
Balthazar pouted playfully as he stirred someone else's cocktail. "At least tell me what he really really looks like. Without airbrushing. Does he smell like leather and sex?"
Finally, Charlie appeared from the patio door with a pitcher of tea and a big white towel. She motioned for Castiel to sit, set the towel at the poolside, and poured two glasses of tea.
She shook her head, unable to hide the grin blooming upon her face.
"Go home, Castiel. Rest, relax. You're on leave with full pay pending Internal Affairs' investigation."
“Maybe.”
Thus, the party was slightly muted as sunset approached, and Charlie and Patience finally appeared for the lighting ceremony. As it turned out, they had been in Missouri’s house for the past two hours, discovering James and weeping, and listening to stories and laughing. They were ebullient in front of the streetlight, which was still draped in a sheet at dusk, as everyone crowded around in their heavy coats waiting for the exciting marvel to be revealed. Before that, however, Charlie was using the theatrical stage setting for some business of her own.
Dean wrapped a towel around his husband and, both of them shirtless. began to push Castiel out of the washroom. The alpha stalled at the doorway, though.
“He’ll shrink once we drain him,” Ash said.
The omega only shook his head with wide eyes, unable to tell if the alpha was joking. After a moment Castiel repeated, “Ring the bell.”
“All of these children are not yours, then?” Castiel asked with his brows raised high.
“I am certain he did. I’m certain he sent someone up and down Glassblowers Street to ask about Sam. In the end we were only ever going to be--” He wanted to say ‘the crown’s tools,’ but Dean was not so foolish. “We will always be thought of as dirty commoners who got raised up by the grace of a foolish king’s love for his daughter,” he finished in a low voice with a bad taste in his mouth. He looked around, glad to note that no one but Colonel Milton had heard his last statement, and then Dean, having lost his appetite, put the fork down onto the white tablecloth and spent the rest of the meal enjoying the free-flowing wine. He excused himself from the dancing afterword with claims that he needed to retrieve his meager tools and parts from his residence before the bake house’s landlord threw them out in making the paltry (but warm) little room ready for a new tenant.
