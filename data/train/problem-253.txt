For a split second, John imagined having the safety of protection like…. He wouldn’t have to use them. Knowing that they were there might be enough to ease his anxieties…
John hid a small blush against the bear’s fur but giggled quietly. He had settled comfortably in his nest of blankets, back leaning against the couch where Greg was sitting.
John Watson was on a mission to get completely and thoroughly shit-faced. No way to sugar-coat it. John was a man with a plan. A plan to get obscenely drunk.
“You’re not,” Greg assured him kindly. Greg was always nice and kind, even John was being weird and stupid like now.
Instead of throwing a negative remark against the DI’s head, Sherlock just eyed his hands thoughtfully; for a very long moment.
Sherlock sighed and pursed his lips, meeting John in a slightly more childish version of their usual goodbye-kiss, that made an adorable little ‘mwah’ sound at the end (here, Greg looked away to give them some privacy, but grinned to himself. Sherlock Holmes being all cute and tender, who would have thought?!).
There were facts he knew about John; simple facts, like his birthday or his profession, advanced facts, like personal preferences about a various range of topics, and the complex facts, which lead to understanding John Watson as a person on a deeper and more profound level.
What often was perceived as a hot-headed tempter masked a deep anxiety to please, a frustration of not meeting a certain set of expectations, a perfectionist in a complex emotional sense.
When John emerged several minutes later- now without a pull-up and wearing the same clothes he had the night before; the bear in his hand the only immediate give-away of his headspace- Greg was busy working on something at the stove and Sherlock sat at Greg’s tiny kitchen table; both nursing enormous cups of black coffee (which tasted just
Sherlock had them maneuvered in a sitting position, where he was perched against the headboard and John was laying heavily against him. The warm weight was comforting in this surreal, overwhelming moment.
Instead, only silence stretched all the way down to where Sherlock was gripping the handles of his chair too tight, breaking the leather underneath his fingertips.
Dumbfounded, the detective stared at the back of his partner’s head (who was still not looking at him), trying to fight down the hurt at his affections not being welcomed.
Really, despite the ridiculousness of it all, it was nice to see Sherlock care about something other than murder.
The detective thought he was overreacting spectacularly and that’s saying a lot coming from a Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes wasn’t one easily surprised. It came with the gift of deduction, that he got to the core of every situation fairly quickly, his acquaintances an open book providing him with all the answers he possibly needed. Emotions had always puzzled him to some extent, but over the years spent with people like Lestrade or John, who had a high emotional intuition bestowed upon them, he had considerably improved in this area.
Now, that he thought about it longer than the fraction of a second, he doubted his own assessment profoundly. He hadn’t even taken the time to
The detective felt John sucking in another sharp breath, the tender words obviously having a positive effect on him. He catalogued everything he could, filing it away in his mind-palace to the ever-growing wing dedicated solely to John’s well-being.
The words send John into an honest-to-God fit of violent sobs. Sherlock hoped they were because of relief but he had the sinking suspicion that a strong part of John had developed an unhealthy relationship to his unusual coping mechanism. John had always been ashamed to a certain degree but had taken on age-play beautifully otherwise. He had accepted being little as a part of who he
Their tub was big enough and Sherlock actually had purchased a bottle of bubble bath in a heat of the moment decision a few months ago.
, he told himself). His partner was keeping strange hours, enthralled by the mystery of the case, which resulted in him barely seeing Sherlock at all. It was Sherlock’s thing, it was what he did- but John kind of missed him, maybe, a bit (a lot).
Sherlock surprised himself in these moments, but John brought out this part within him- this caring, warm, utterly
So, Sherlock took John’s face in both of his hands and rubbed at the new tear-stains with his thumbs.
The words tasted like bile in the doctor’s mouth, the whole extend of the humiliation catching up to him. Did Sherlock really think that he couldn’t control his body enough to…? He had had one accident, one tiny little accident and now Sherlock was fucking making fun of him for it; treating him like the baby that he wasn’t and that he
Sherlock just continued walking and- alright, that was making him really, really feel like crap now.
alright. Just a little bit worked up and needy. Well, that would sound very self-depriving if he phrased it like that. Instead, he added: ‘Just miss you.’
the bed), wrapped in Sherlock’s blue dressing gown, which he had found flung carelessly over the nightstand, and buried his face against the soft teddy bear, which Sherlock had bought for little him; the bear he had never gotten around to name, which somehow made the situation
Sherlock looked over at John’s profile (his eyes were closed, but his whole body was twitching restlessly) and postponed the discussion of their scheduled ‘little time’ when John was less agitated and less likely to deny he craved little time at all.
“You don’t have to,” Sherlock interjected while the lump in his throat grew, but John barely noticed him over his own hitching breaths.
“I was thinking we could order some pizza,” Sherlock casually said, pretending to not totally set out a bait to reel little John in. While big John liked pizza, little John absolutely loved it (probably because it was fun to eat it with your hands and getting a little messy was part of the deal).
In that very moment, John remembered a crucial detail. In order for him to get in the bath, he would have to get out of his clothes first. That thought made his stomach drop.
This realization was probably the most startling out of them all. Although admittedly terrible, everything else wasn’t really new. But this-
The atmosphere however, made him stop in his tracks. Something was off. More specifically, John was off. Usually after a solve, John would listen to him ramble while he had dinner ready, ushering his detective to catch up on the missed nutrition, with a smile on his face (Sherlock hated to admit that he became kind of dependent on this kind of doting and that he secretly looked forward to it).
It wasn’t anything graphic, but the built-up was even making Greg feel heart-broken for poor Lion-dad. Sucked to be stabbed in the back like that. When poor little Lion-son was wandering around at the scene of the crime, Greg’s attention instantly switched to the little guy on the floor. John had taken a liking to the movie quickly, seemed to enjoy the catchy tunes and colorful animations. He had been shifting every now and again, snacking and playing with the bear in his lap absent-mindedly. When the fall was presented on screen, all movement suddenly stopped. It didn’t take a genius to piece together what John was thinking in that very moment and for a second, Greg felt awful for even suggesting this movie.
“Can we put chocolate chips in the pancakes?” John asked, while rubbing some astray batter on his cheek. Greg looked up briefly from his task to cut some fruits as a healthy side-dish to give John a raised eyebrow.
Sherlock had always refrained from checking up on John after an episode, thinking the sentiment was not very welcome.
Sherlock squared his jaw. He hated to state the obvious himself, but he didn’t know how else to start the conversation.
“Easy, love,” Sherlock laughed, but caught John’s hand just in time, before he could turn the doorknob.
John opened his eyes at being addressed and just stared at Sherlock for some seconds. The battle between his headspaces had clearly picked up again and despite his insecurity, Sherlock knew that John was well on his way to allow himself to be little. He just needed a little push in the right direction and lots of encouragement once he got there.
Instead of answering, he bent forward until he could capture John’s lips in a soft kiss. He felt John smile against his lips.
He sucked in a shuddering breath, his voice wavering somewhere between open vulnerability and crushing shame. Sherlock’s heart hammered wildly in his chest, in awe and relief and affection for the man in his arms.
“Shhh. You couldn’t help it. And you had your pull-up, so it wasn’t that bad. That’s what they’re for, love bug. To offer some protection when you’re feeling unsure.”
After several minutes of enthralled telly-watching (turns out it really has something to do with Chia!), John broke the silence in the most appalled tone of voice Greg had ever heard him use: “Green smoothies are
When both of their movements were becoming more sluggish and their gaming less enthusiastic, Greg figured they could use a little break. He nudged his foot against John’s, making the little doctor look up from the Ludo board he was just putting back into its box.
“He cares about you a lot,” Sherlock agreed, licking his lips. Calculating how to phrase the next sentence. Despite Ella, nobody knew about their new intimacy, and in a way, it was nobody’s business. But Greg was… an essential part of both of their lives. If Greg would know, a lot of things would be so much… easier here on out. Sherlock longed for someone to talk to about his insecurities; it was sometimes difficult with John, for John would feel guilty of putting Sherlock in a situation where he could have insecurities in the first place. Additionally, Sherlock wasn’t comfortable with keeping such an important part of themselves from the DI. Greg was their closest friend.
about John’s whole demander radiated a certain vulnerability that was so foreign in his otherwise so dominant partner. He softened the scold that had formed on his face.
While he was sure he’d get along well with all versions of his friend, and Greg had found little John absolutely adorable, Sherlock had always been with them. As far as he knew, John had never fully regressed when Sherlock wasn’t around, so it was a big step for everyone involved.
“Don’t even say something like that,” Sherlock whispered again, with more urgency. His own voice quivered with emotion.
The doctor still felt bad for his reaction (which- he now realized- was totally blown out of proportion), but he wasn’t calm enough to go back to Baker Street. He was hot-tempered by nature; it wouldn’t be the first night he spent away from home after an argument. Letting another beer lull his senses and crashing in Greg’s comfortable guest bedroom was a much more attractive option than going home half-drunk and dealing with Sherlock.
Regular age-play was a necessity for John’s mental-health, Ella had said. It was something he just needed as a way to de-stress, to let go. A way to heal. Sherlock couldn’t help John with defending his demons. But at least he could have helped in making John
that, he had told him mere minutes ago. Still. It was everything he could say without fearing to start sobbing again, this time out of humiliation. And all this crying was wearing him out.
Sherlock had gotten royally pissed when John had pointed out to him that they seemed to be lost, and Sherlock proceeded to ignore him and walked even faster.
The cocoon looked defeated (and Greg wanted to coo some more). It not very subtly snuggled closer (and also not very subtly froze when the obscured pull-up made the tiniest of crinkling noises, Greg pretended not to have heard).
“Can you do it?” His voice was almost tiny and John absently wondered if he perhaps slipped a bit younger than usual, but decided not to think about that anymore (it would only serve to fuel his insecurities about being perceived as a baby).
His vision was still blurred, but once he could make out the ‘Sh’ he already knew who called him. Of course. Who else?
“Hey, none of this now,” Sherlock reached out to smooth the frown out of his little doctor’s eyebrows. “Everything’s just fine.”
’ve established. If being dumb entails having fun and getting cuddles, I don’t mind being dumb so terribly much.”
he could (hopefully) give him; but as long as John didn’t ask for it, he couldn’t be certain. This was a scenario very unlikely in the near future, considering John didn’t even talk to him at the present moment.
And it served to make him feel even more miserable. He had been unfair while Sherlock had just tried to be considerate. He missed the mark a bit (
The words were like a blanket wrapping around him, providing him with the encouragement he desperately needed. It would be
The worry in his tummy gave a small tug. John looked down at their clasped hands, and at teddy in his other hand.
With slow, deliberate movements (as if not to startle John out of the haze that seemed to have fallen over both of them), the detective reached for his bag and fished for the pull-up without breaking eye-contact with John. His little doctor became slightly droopy-eyed and Sherlock watched with bemusement how his thumb gravitated near his lips (another thing, Sherlock observed John seemed to desire when he was little but hadn’t allowed himself to indulge so far).
Several seconds passed in which Greg simply sat and stared at the silver of early morning light filtering through the gap between his blinds; wondering dumbly if he was still asleep, if this was a very realistic dream.
By the time that he was out of his clothes, had disposed the pull-up in the bin without looking at it and stepped into the warm bath water, he was well on his way to be fully little. It
However, said loving, helpful, caring John Watson was fighting sleep and loosing the battle, movements sluggish and slow, exhaustion written all over his face. Yet, he soldiered on, dutifully reading file after file, making small remarks to Sherlock now and again. Another half an hour, and he couldn’t even keep his eyes open.
Additionally, there was this thing about the reading. Sherlock didn’t even think about introducing it as a reoccurring ritual, he just happened (as he tried to feed his ravenous mind more information) to read quite a lot, about a lot of different things. And he liked reading in the evenings, considering the atmosphere was the most peaceful then; John was home from the surgery, the room still smelled faintly of dinner, the telly was providing comfortable background noise. Sherlock liked the coziness of it all, the ability to shut the world out and his mind up for some blissful minutes of comradice with his favorite person.
, he had known five minutes ago when he went to the guest bathroom for the third time in the last hour. But now he wasn’t so sure anymore and a wave of discomfort rolled over him. His whole body felt sensitive and itching and his mind couldn’t stop drifting to soft things and stories and…. And Daddy.
The sudden powerful emotion puzzled him, because their firmly established dynamic worked differently. John was the caring one; he made sure Sherlock ate and slept and didn’t bleed out by accident. Sherlock often forgot the needs of himself and the people around him; he wasn’t attentive in the reassuring way that John was; he wasn’t the caring type. But his heart swelled as he stood there in the dark room and watched his friend fight with himself; clearly torn between throwing Sherlock out of the room and throwing himself into Sherlock’s arms.
The process of coaxing him back into Baker Street had been tiring and painful. But he was home, at last.
The doctor rolled his eyes and looked away, a faint blush tinting his cheeks. It was totally working, but John tried to fight it.
He didn’t have an accident and Daddy hugged him in his sleep- like people did when they loved each other- and breakfast was only minutes away; and all of this made John very, very happy.
John surprised Sherlock by shaking his head violently, rubbing his face almost painfully against Sherlock’s collarbone.
. Age-play, Ella had called it. John didn’t really like the term, feeling like it added a sense of finality and seriousness to it. He preferred the blurry lines they were currently skirting around whenever they were…
Sherlock usually didn’t call in favors from Mycroft. At least, not favors in the general sense; there was usually a payback of one form or another involved; some case Sherlock usually was too proud to take, or some tiring leg-work.
By the thought of reading, his heart made a happy leap, as he mounted the cab that would take him from Scotland Yard back home. In a heat of the moment decision, he asked the driver to drop him off at a Waterstones not too far from Baker Street, where he acquired a book of short stories, figuring John might enjoy a bit of fiction for a change, instead of the scientific articles.
Sherlock just shrugged and smiled; something about John being like this just warmed him all over and he had to smile, even though there was no good reason for it.
Sherlock Holmes was proud to call himself John Watson’s companion. His flat mate. His work partner. His best friend. John didn’t just need
It was like a very heavy animal- maybe an elephant- had sat down on his chest, constricting his breathing, elevating his pulse. He became light-headed and nauseous from the shock of it. There was a roaring in his ears and a burning in his eyes. For several minutes, he was so overwhelmed with the situation that he could do nothing more than sit in and stare at his own mess.
John could swear Sherlock was going to have face cramps from the grimace he was making, which made everything even more funny for him.
John felt like he was invading his friend's privacy, since he was having a conversation more with himself than with John. The doctor stood up and carried the tray of tea to the kitchen. He would give Sherlock some private time and make more tea.
“Because I don't have a sword-,” Sherlock paused with shiny big eyes. “It's a sword! And it's in my bed, because I am a pirate! And it's where I sleep,” he shouted, already running up the stairs.
Sherlock couldn't explain exactly what was wrong with him. And for him to admit that would be similar to the end of the world. How could he not know something? It was maddening, really.
(This last bit is in italics because it's something Sherlock is remembering only. He didn't tell John about it.)
“Any friends?” John asked, fearing the answer. Not that he could demand anything. He had been a Rugby player, had plenty of friends in school. He couldn't imagine any teenager capable of understanding and dealing with Sherlock.
“Goodnight, Sherlock. Try to come up with new plans to murder Anderson and get away with it or something,” John said, already going upstairs.
Sherlock smiled and stood up to place Sherrinford on the mantle. “I hope Mrs. Hudson don't take it.”
“It's not psychology, it's the science of deduction. You should try some time; there's a website,” John said, smiling, while Sherlock rolled his eyes. “So. A hiding place for two needles and a picture of two young men. One of them must be you. Are you going to show me?”
“I'm fine,” Sherlock said, trying to calm his own thoughts, concentrating on the warmth of John's hand.
A blunt force trauma to the head. Surely Sherlock would love the jargon. A ridiculously vicious blow to the head that left the consulting detective laying on the hospital bed for three weeks, waking up from time to time only to find John spread uncomfortably on the plastic chair, never leaving his side. But who would be surprised by that? Only Sherlock; the idiot.
He was on his way to the pub he knew Greg regularly visited on a Thursday evening like today, in the hopes to find his friend there. He was itching to complain about Sherlock, his temper still bubbling in his veins in shame and anger, still vividly remembering the moment when-
When still no end was near after the ten minutes had passed, the DI snapped: “I’m losing my patience here, mate. What. Do. You. Want. From. Me?”
that he loved Sherlock and was loved by Sherlock in return; it was more hearing it out in the open, leaving Greg’s lips so casually, like it was the easiest thing in the world- that got to him for reasons he couldn’t even phantom.
The bubbles covered his bits, so he wouldn’t have to look at the angry redness that was spreading over his crotch (not quite a rash yet, but not far off from it, either), which helped him to forget the uncomfortableness and actually enjoy the experience.
John shrugged but sank to the floor obediently, flipping the nearest available coloring book open at a random page and reached for the box of crayons.
John shrugged, still looking at his tea. “I don’t know. Maybe it was just something you said to get me to calm down…”
Sherlock snapped out of his mind long enough to focus on the sort of hopeful but more dejected expression on his partner’s face. John already knew the answer. Still, perhaps he hoped for a different one.
“Enjoying yourself?” Sherlock’s bemused voice made Greg look up at him momentarily, before scooting over, making enough room for the lanky man to sit next to him.
The single best damn thing in his life- when was the last time they had shared a bed or a kiss or even more than a minute of intimacy? When was the last time they had played?
When not even ten minutes later, said heartbroken, anxiety-ridden, little guy giggled about the hideous wall colour choices in aforementioned interior design tv show, Greg wondered with bemused annoyance if he had been played.
“How ‘bout we have another round and then you’re crashing at my place for the night? I’ve free day tomorrow and I know for a fact that you do, too. Some space might do you and Sherlock good, cooling off your tempers.”
Passing over his lips softly, rolling off his tongue. Traveling towards John, carrying everything with them. Everything that Sherlock had been, was, and would ever be.
John dismissed this thought immediately) but that wasn’t really the point. Sherlock had a hard time being nice to people. Sherlock had a hard time caring for people. And he had been wonderful to John the past weeks, especially as his… (John sucked in a sharp breath that didn’t go unnoticed by Greg)…
Sherlock sat on the freshly-made bed (made with Sherlock’s linen, John noticed), casually against the headboard, tablet in hand.
His partner’s sharp tone felt more like a kick in the gut- violent and sudden, and extremely painful (John knew he was overreacting. John knew that Sherlock was just riding out his high, testing his boundaries like he liked to do after a period of time when his mind had been titillated constantly. John knew Sherlock didn’t mean any harm, was frustrated by him at best. He knew. But that didn’t change a thing.)
- where he allowed a wave of calmness to wash over him. When he was curled up with John next to him, his mind was blissfully quiet, and the world was alright.
“But, it’s a forty minutes’ drive,” Greg told himself quietly, while scrubbing his hand over his face. It wasn’t the first night he lost sleep over Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, and he’d be damned if it would be the last.
Right after the confession, John hurriedly hid his face, as if Sherlock would now think much less of him for it.
“Good boy,” the DI praised quietly, remembering that John responded well to this kind of positive encouragement. He also noticed the bear his friend was now clutching, indicating that he perhaps felt littler than he had before. It was fine with Greg either way.
Sherlock didn’t give John one more chance to get another self-depriving adjective out. Watching his man- this strong, wonderful man- verbally destroy himself over mistakes that weren’t even his was much more than Sherlock could take. And God help him, he could take a lot.
By the end of it, John was pretty agitated, sleeping more restlessly in their big shared bed all on his own, growing exhausted and weary.
The hand clutching the trouser-fabric was shaking- either from cold and low blood-sugar, most likely both; since, now that he focused on it, Sherlock realized that John had been eating poorly the past couple of days (this day no exception), a habit the doctor had developed during Sherlock’s time in Serbia; a habit that was extremely concerning. With Sherlock, it was his modus operandi- he just forgot to eat when John didn’t keep him in check- but John seemed to deliberately starve himself when in deep emotional distress.
The deep gratitude and affection he felt for his friend at that moment of realization had nothing to do with being more emotional due to his little headspace. He could feel himself aging up yet another bit; that he was almost in the in-between state between big and little.
Ella had forwarded him a useful website about age-play (that were nothing like the weird pages he had visited while he attempted to do some research), in which it stated that getting clean- like in a bath or a shower- could help to ease some anxiety and improve the bond between a caregiver and his little.
He licked his lips, trying to come up with a way to phrase his request so it wouldn’t sound so damn childish.
Another half-hour later, he dismissed the silly notion. He wasn’t a child or anything. And Sherlock was smart. He probably figured it out right away, probably even texted Greg to verify his assumption. Sherlock was fine.
There was no way the evening would turn around to… that. Sherlock was probably angry. He surely wouldn’t want to… after John had a tantrum over...pull-ups. A silly, childish tantrum.
He had a pretty good idea about it, but a hypothesis as long as it’s not confirmed is nothing more than exactly that- a hypothesis.
He held out the bear for John to see. John bit his lip as his gaze flickered from Sherlock’s face to the teddy’s button eyes and back to Sherlock.
“I miss you,” he stuttered between pitiful sobs, his voice wavering somewhere between big and little. “I miss you so much.”
He had been hyperaware of his own bladder the second his head had hit the pillow; irrationally fearing another accident. Accidents were bad as it were, but an accident in his friend’s flat was a level of humiliation he wasn’t ready for.
John heaved a big sigh as Sherlock increased the pace yet again, most likely annoyed with the world and too high on post-case adrenaline to be civil about it. The doctor clenched his teeth as a violent flare of pain shot through his leg, which made him wobble dangerous before regaining his footing.
When the giggles had died down to a quiet chuckle, the room was bathed in comfortable silence, safe for the morning show, now investigating the “10 ways to make your smoothie a health-bomb” (Greg always had a suspicion that it must have something to do with this Chia-stuff). Idly, he started watching the program, giving John some time to catch his breath.
It had the desired effect in a sense that John finally looked him in the face. However, what Greg saw in the face could only be described as the opposite of care-free childishness.
He was more than willing to give what he thought John desired- he found it sweet in that wholesome kind of way that warmed you from the inside and out (something, he had been completely unfamiliar with before he had met John all those years ago)- but he wasn’t sure if it was his place to offer. On the other hand, he had initiated the reading sessions, and that was working fairly well.
The detective faltered a bit. Because, even though John was just lashing out to hurt him at this point, he really hit a sore spot.
; enjoyed the way his head got a little bit fuzzy, and how Sherlock showered him in attention, and how he could call Sherlock….
“Hello John,” he spoke quietly, all the excitement momentarily forgotten. Instead, the adrenalin still cursing through his veins heightened the worry he felt because John wasn’t even looking at him.
, alright? Not only are you trying to make me do something I don’t want to- no!- you did plan on waiting to bring it up until I’m vulnerable enough to not refuse?”
“Forget it,” John scoffed, voice no longer heated but filled with an ashamed edge. “You don’t understand anything. I’m going out.”
“Can I have milk, please?” he asked quietly, hyperaware of the way his smaller voice must sound to someone only accustomed to his normal voice; which, although not very loud was always strong and sure.
And really, who could blame him for inching closer and closer, while this warm feeling sat in his heart; who could blame him if he rubbed his cheek against the soft fabric covering his friend’s thigh; who would blame him that he let Sherlock’s soft voice- reading the article on his tablet about bees aloud- lull him to sleep; who could blame him if he felt alright and at home, for the first time in a very
Greg chuckled quietly at his own sappy thoughts (it was true, though) as he made his way over to the couch, slumping down in John’s chair and listening to the one-sided conversation. John nudged him with his foot once or twice when his narrative arrived at parts that had remotely to do with Greg (like the time he laughed so hard about one of the stupid puns Timon made that he almost chocked on his drink). Greg grinned contently and threw in a comment once or twice to make his friend laugh. Simultaneously, he discreetly answered the texts Sherlock had started to send him about ten minutes into the conversation; asking if there were any difficulties and how John had taken the whole thing (always the helicopter parent, that Sherlock Holmes. It was a thought that bemused Greg out of its sheer absurdity).
by something. He didn’t want anyone else to know. He somehow thought Sherlock would leave out this particular detail, but
, this right here, this came pretty damn close. He was next to Sherlock before he even registered his own movements, head only inches away from the detective’s thigh. Sherlock’s body radiated warmth and that special smell of wood and smoke and tea. It was an almost unreal experience, when Sherlock- fucking Sherlock Holmes of all people- draped the blankets around his shoulders, wrapping him in a save cocoon.
It wasn’t often that Sherlock Holmes found himself in the position that he wished he had been wrong.
“Let me see,” he urged, already pulling the hand underneath the cold water-spray from the faucet. John let himself be manhandled, although somehow reluctantly.
From the days and weeks John had spent here with him on Greg’s uttermost insistence after Sherlock’s “death” (He had been pretty worried for John’s health and sanity for the first couple of months), Greg was well accustomed to John’s complicated relationship with sleep.
As Saturday morning rolled around, Greg was actually a teeny-weeny bit glad that Sherlock was into over-sharing all the details. He wasn’t nervous per se, but it had hit him when he was seated at the couch of 221B Baker Street, that this was kind of a big deal. It was something incredibly intimate and private his friends (most of all, John) asked him to be a part of and he hated the thought of failing them in any way.
“I’m not leaving. God, John. I should be the one apologizing and begging you to stay with me. I’ve been awful to you.”
And sometimes, sometimes he just wanted a hug or a cuddle, but that was a very inappropriate thing to ask for while being at a crime scene or in the middle of an interrogation.
The reply was almost instantaneous: ‘Hi, lovebug! I’m just fine. Are you alright?’ John thought he could read the ‘If it’s not, I’m leaving to take the next plane home’ in between the lines, but maybe he was just imagining things. Even more warmth than from the hug surrounded him. Just talking to his Daddy helped to ease a whole lot of the anxiety and sadness in his heart. He settled against Greg more comfortably.
John was so damn comfortable, that he almost forgot the giant elephant in the room. Only almost, though. Instantly, his body stiffed; all muscles going rigid.
However, when the credits rolled, some of the sadness tried to seep back into his heart. Greg still held him and he still held teddy- yet he suddenly felt lost and unsure of his headspace. And the part about Simba’s daddy had been really
Because it wasn’t… in their line of work, a decent coping mechanism was hard to find and harder to keep. It was easy to get absorbed in self-destructive habits to deal with the immense stress of their day to day lives. It was easy to become addicted to substances, to bad people, to physical excesses.
Greg rubbed the last bit of sleep out of his eyes and swung his legs over the side of his bed while he pressed the ‘receive call’ button.
The detective rested his forehead against John’s, both of them now chilled to the bone, and restlessly caressed his long fingers over John’s cheeks, eyebrows, jaw; rubbing away the wetness that was gathering relentlessly.
The weight of the situation dawned on John momentarily (and pushed him to age up a tiny little bit), as his eyes flickered between his best friend and his partner.
He just couldn’t stop replaying the argument in his mind and he kept running around in circles over the fucking pull-ups.
He got to play with the different ducks while Daddy took care of getting him clean. It was a lot more fun than doing it himself in the shower; and the warm water eased the pain in his leg- which had been turning a vivid shade of blue- to a small throbbing.
Greg fought the urge to pull him in for a hug, unsure if his affections would be welcome right now. After all, it seemed like there was an absolute riot going on in John’s mind.
There was a significant pause; in which John fiddled with the blanket draped over his knees and Sherlock silently counted the seconds. He didn’t realize how invested he became into these new dynamics that only just barely surfaced between them. He might have gotten a little carried away with his deductions. Maybe he had miscalculated again. Maybe John didn’t want him to do that; maybe John needed comfort, but he wasn’t comfortable with Sherlock giving it to him. While Sherlock figured he would be a tad too devastated about this possibility (considering he only just acknowledged his caring side twenty minutes ago), John’s consent was vital.
The little doctor just nodded, already rushing to the bathroom with the bag, Sherlock had brought with him last night. While he wasn’t so ashamed of the pull-up now that he was little, he still wouldn’t want Greg to find it in his trash bin.
I have so much more ideas in store, now that Greg's part of their little age-play dynamic, too. I just love writing Greg, he strikes me as a really fun character, so I wanted to make him really fun. <3
“Which of these do you guys want to watch?” He indicated to the screen with the remote. John chewed his lip in a moment of complete concentration (which was just the cutes thing, especially since he also did it when he was big).
“Might want to slow down a bit, yeah? I don’t want to have to carry you back to Baker Street and have your highness lecture us both on alcohol consumption.”
The buy made him embarrassingly confident, he was eager to prove that he was a thoughtful partner after all (Insecurity, another concept he hadn’t been familiar with until John hobbled into his life).
“A little after six. We spent all night crammed up together on the couch. Well, me on top of you, more accurately.”
Aside from the morning John and Sherlock had spend at his flat, he only had ever seen ‘little John’ once. A smuggler investigation lead them right into the London Zoo, and after the case was over, the doctor had asked in a very small voice if they could stay and look at the animals. Judging by the way he was fussing right now, Sherlock must have died on the inside from nervous energy but had remained cool and collected on the outside in the face of John being little in public (well, semi-public).
Somewhere in the far corners of his head, big John was having a break-down over the humiliation of one of his best mates knowing that he liked soft things and called Sherlock ‘Daddy’. Little John, though, was only mildly concerned with big John’s issues (which was very, very rare; if it had happened at all. Usually, shame was enough to kick the doctor completely out of headspace again. This time, however, he was settled into it quite firmly; and the childish items around him helped him feel small).
Helping his mum when dad left; left with another woman, left and returned and left again; every meeting filled with promises the man didn’t keep- he was ten when he realized that his dad didn’t really want to be a dad and was doing a poor job at it.
The detective’s gaze rested on the offending item in question. He then pursed his lips, sighing a little. He opened his mouth, but John beat him right to it.
It were facts of the last nature that were baffling him, as they unfolded right before his very eyes. You see, John Watson was by no means an easy person. The war had taken its toll on his mental stability and self-esteem, the hunger for danger and action posed a contradiction within the otherwise gentle doctor, his self-image revolved around expectations he believed other people had in him. Most of all, he was eager to please, eager to be recognized by a figure of control, making him excellent in following orders; but he didn’t trust others enough with himself, taking the control right back. Additionally, John was caring by nature; not used to showing vulnerability of any kind; but he was also sensitive and sweet and tempter-driven; a peculiar combination altogether. One would best describe John Watson as complicated, for lack of a better word.
“You don’t have to be little if you’re not feeling like it. We can just hang out this weekend. I’m fine spending time with you either way.”
“Be good for Daddy, yes?” He asked softly; in the most tender voice Greg had ever heard him use. It was dramatic, but so genuine that Greg felt a little pull in his stomach. He was getting sappy in his old age.
Instead, John was sitting in his chair, not looking at Sherlock and instead appeared to be busy on his laptop. Sherlock watched him, quickly taking in the most important facts. John was tense. Agitated, restless. He hadn’t been sleeping very well. He was rubbing the jumper at the place where Sherlock knew the exit wound scarred the skin.
Big, dark blue eyes looked at him with great concern and his voice carried an odd softness to it. “Are you well? I tried all the others, but I fear they are all dead.” he said from where he seemed to hover in the ocean, unaffected by the cold.
“Sherlock Holmes, hm.” He seemed to mull the sound of it over in his mouth. “I like that.” he finally concluded.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him in challenge. “Then I'll cut it open. Although I am fairly sure that I'd lose a lot more blood that way.” For demonstration, he moved to get up.
“Just a few cycles more than you, I should think. Oh, you call it, what.. Years, I believe? What is the number? Look,” he paused his speech to show Sherlock, with his hands, three tens and one eight.
“It's nearly 11am, I thought I might tempt you with a bite now.” Sherlock said, mild amusement on his face.
“Well, then, Mr Pirate. Why do you not show me how your youth outweighs my looks? I see you are slender, but you lack my strength. Will you really fight someone who could strangle you – more so in their own element?”
The shrill scream had both Sherlock and John wake up with a head-start, jumping out of the bed and running into the living room to look what had happened to make Hamish shriek like that. Fortunately, as soon as they arrived and Hamish had met their worried looks with one of his curious stares, the clever eyes light up with joy as his mouth squished his chubby cheeks upwards in a very toothy grin, his angelic voice gifting them with his bright laughter as he trampled, pointing at the presents beneath the Christmas tree. They both let out deep breaths, sighing, John grinning at the whole scene while Sherlock just rolled his eyes at the overzealous display of excitement by their son and would later deny even the physical ability of having smiled.
It was a strange day, shady newspapers printing half-stories about some weird and brutal incident over in Germany. Apparently, a man bit off a strange passenger's ear, continuing to 'feed on his flesh' amidst the rush of life in the middle of a street. Other passers by tried intervening, helping the attacked man, but said 'cannibal' was said to be unbelievably strong and bit four of the helpers until he could successfully be tackled and held down. The police took the man in for custody; the hurt persons were taken to hospital. That was it. Further development was still to be seen.
John drank like a dying man, probably literally, until he could tell that Sherlock wasn't too far off from being re-balanced. He pulled the arm away from himself, wipe over the holes in the skin and then over his mouth.
“No, I'm not!” Sherlock replied like it was a personal offence. He then took John's silence to let his eyes roam over the smaller man's body, analysing him for answers. He sighed when he understood. “John, I may be a narcissistic arsehole, but this is not a bad thing. You are doing nothing wrong.”
They had even tried sharing a bed once already, but found that was too much for Sherlock as for now. A strange sense of urgency and stress had overcome him quickly, and he asked John to leave for his own room. John had calmly and kindly agreed, pecked his cheek and trotted back upstairs sleepily, not holding a grudge against Sherlock, which had been a great relief to the brunet. Anyone else, he was sure, would have accused him of making a fuss and not making an effort; which made him even more glad to have John and made him feel even less like he deserved his kindness and respect.
Guns were raised to their heads immediately. John tried to dissolve the situation by offering food in exchange for shelter and protection by the group. There were some negotiations, but in the end, hunger won out and they were accepted in, ultimately won over by the mention of John's military career and Sherlock's intellect.
None of the respectable papers told of such an incident. A prank? The attempt to raise attention to smaller and less respected publishers?
Even with three people in the house, it seemed lonely, silent and cold. Mycroft had left the day he had come by to get to their parents and they hadn't heard of him since. He had ensured them to inform them as soon as he arrived, to see if it maybe even was safer in a smaller area like where they were living. Three days later and no word. He could be dead, for all they knew.
“What did you mean, 'read a book'.” Sherlock interrupted as he sat up, his feet planted on the stone.
Sherlock looked around them for witnesses. “You would believe me.” he murmured lowly, even though there was nobody to hear him. “I was rescued, not by a boat, by a man. Mycroft, a man living in the ocean.”
And he'd felt bad about getting them thrown out of the group like that. He hadn't meant to, not with John having it had set as a goal to find and stick with other people, Sherlock told him quietly from where his head rested on John's thighs. The older man caressed his head and told him he didn't mind.
Sherlock's eyes were hard, distrust flashed up in them and John hated it. They were friends. Sherlock was the maddest and bloody well best friend John had ever had. He couldn't look into his eyes if they spoke to him like that. “Sherlock, please. Just drop it.”
A long moment passed in which they looked at each other with mixed emotions. “Wow, er..” John broke the silence eventually. “That's awfully kind of you and I want to say 'no' immediately, but let us see where we go first, yeah? Just see how we develop, how we fit together and then we'll see if I need that sort of thing. I'm not generally fond of cheating, even in an open relationship. I might play the field a bit when I'm single, but when I'm committed, I'm loyal.”
A week into their new relationship, Sherlock has been rather open to explore the basics. Not that John would be surprised. But at least, he was flattered.
Sherlock frowned. John sounded so honest saying that, which made Sherlock understand even less. “B.. But then what's the point of-”
“How are you feeling?” Sherlock asked, ignoring the last statement. He moved over to the sofa and sat down beside John.
John sat down outside the door, knife to his left. With great relief, he recalled not seeing Greg among any of the corpses they had dropped in here – there was a chance their friend had somehow survived. He regretted having had so little contact with the DI before London got overrun.
Yes, he could have done without Sarah getting into this kind of trouble, but she'd gone with it. All of it. From Sherlock's rude behaviour to almost dying and she still wanted to see John.
“I alone decide about my life. I don't care that we come from 'different worlds'. We both need adventures and I will travel the world with you to find them.” He was aware of how foolish he sounded, desperately in love like a simple man. “What are you so scared of?”
“Just water, thanks.” she replied curtly, eyeing the flat around her. “So, how are you two getting along?”
There was a silence in which Sherlock did his best to be unreadable, which was a tad difficult under John's concerned stare.
After readying his tea, letting it sit for a couple of minutes, he turned around, leaning against the counter top and looking at the kitchen table just because it blocked his view to the floor. His body was obviously already released of some of the tension, but he was still noticeably agitated. “Are
It turned out the group was not planning to rob them, but they were a bunch of arseholes, at least in how they treated Sherlock. John forgot sometimes, that Sherlock wasn't compatible with everyone and that most people didn't take kindly to be being brutally turned inside out by his deductions.
“I want to commit to you, to this relationship. I don't feel like I would do you justice if I kept my word to Mary.”
The doctor frowned at him, clearly confused by his behaviour. He wasn't stupid, bless him, this wasn't his 'Sherlock you are being unnecessarily complicated and irritatingly proud' face. This was the face John made when he suspected a reason beyond his grasp and knowledge. He was intrigued, but uncertain if he should ask about it. “Something the matter?”
“Thousands of years ago, minds were different. That is, if you believe in this story.” Mycroft raised an eyebrow at John, who looked like he wanted to not believe but couldn't help himself.
John, however, was adamant about apologising. “No, it's not. I'm sorry I said that. It was incredibly insensitive and really unnecessary. I do hope you can forgive me that slip up.”
Sherlock stopped his pacing around the living room, head turning to watch the TV screen, his eyebrows drawing together in, not scrutiny, but disbelief, the incapability of accepting such happenings.
They were taken with on the loot of the shop, which didn't have too much left, and were then lead back to the group's base in the middle of a village. Detached and quiet, just as John had hoped. They had settled down in a house, with all but one bedroom taken, sofas included. It didn't matter to them, really, neither of them minded any more, which, of course, earned them snickers and comments, but whatever, they weren't alone any more and they'd get used to them.
John looked up at him a little taken aback. He didn't know that was actually a thing. “And I thought you just liked me a lot. Well, I won't complain..”
It was just a little peck. Nothing significant. But somehow it made Sherlock incredibly nervous. Not strictly because he didn't like to be touched, John was almost always an exception to that, but because it made him realise something: He had absolutely no idea what he was in for. John had experience,
They shared a fond grin and shortly after, Holmes let him know that he was good to continue. Watson rocked them back and forth on the tiny space that was the chaise longue. It wasn't long until Holmes began to moan his pleasure into Watson's mouth. With a closer look, he could see the flutter of Holmes' lids, his eyes rolled back. His hand grabbed the doctor's shoulder, the other hanging on to the furniture, and he dug in his short nails, over and over with each tilt of his hips by his partner's doing.
There was a kindness and honesty in John's eyes, that rarely anyone ever saw on him. Sherlock had seen it before, but it had never affected him like this. He whispered a soft 'thank you' and John smiled. “Don't worry,” he replied.
“Yes, this definitely needs stitches.” He carefully moved the skin around, looking at the cut edges and how it would line up when put back together. “I can do it here, if you want to. I've got some stuff for small stitching. Otherwise I'll have to call an ambulance.. Your call.”
The look on Sherlock's face when John posed as the man behind the Game was so full of disbelief, hurt and betrayal, that it hurt John in return that Sherlock thought he'd actually be capable of doing these things. Seeing that look being replaced by pure worry as John revealed the bomb beneath the jacket was sort of comforting. Still, he couldn't help but wonder: would Sherlock be here if not for John's involvement?
John did just the same. They had their clothes together in one bag and two more spacious backpacks with their canned food, some of it packed with their clothes, just so they could take as much as possible. The mobile and internet networks had broken down two days ago, electric utilities had shut down in the entire country as well. Everything had shut down. They still hadn't heard from Mycroft, so he was either dead or wouldn't be able to reach them again. They were going
John took his tea and the newspaper into the living room, flopping down on his chair. “No, it's my day off. Why? Have any plans?”
“A couple.” John breathed. “My vitals will begin to fall again once my body's used up all your blood. But we need to wait for your body to detox itself.”
“I won't be content.” Mary said I a way that screamed to raise pity. But John had been friends with Sherlock Holmes for years now, he wasn't manipulated that easily any more.
“I'm not sure.” Sherlock answered, mouth lowering John's shoulder again, from where he started kissing his way to the doctor's neck. “I've always been interested in you.” He threw his mobile onto the other side of the bed and moved to straddle John's lap. The blond gave a small “woah” at the sudden attack, but was otherwise very okay with the turn of events. Sherlock continued kissing his neck and throat, working in little nibbles and sucks. John breathing became laboured under the attention and he could feel, not for the first time in these last 24 hours, how his cock responded to his arousal. “I've never felt any of this before.” Sherlock's deep voice rumbled against his throat and chest, sending a pleasant shiver through him. “I've never wanted someone like this before. I can't remember the last time I was actually aroused.” John could confirm that he was definitely aroused now, if the hardness rubbing against him was any indication.
The government remained silent, no sign of the army, the police or even the common criminal with a gun.
Meanwhile, Sherlock was sitting on his bed, thinking. Well, not really thinking, just sorting through a couple of things. John's evaluation had been a self-ironic statement, but it cut deep into old wounds with Sherlock. He needed to irreparably cut those links to avoid false accusations and guilt-trapping John in the future. His rules on 'playing fair' may have been set the pretty way, but he really didn't want to push John into leaving. John had proven that he was too important for that. Two years of torture for him were one thing, but the fact that he'd wanted desperately to go home and see John again had really made some switches click into position.
As Captain Blackbeard, he had been sailing the seas for more than a decade and while most pirates feared these fantastical creatures, he did not. He was not as sure about his crew, but it hardly matters. He had not grown up and deserved himself the title of a Captain to have his men doubt him or order his beliefs. To Sherlock, the sea was the only mystery to worship.
John regarded him for a moment, wanting to deny him further, but he also didn't want to die. He pulled the limb back towards himself and bit down on the fleshier part halfway up to the elbow, fearing his lack of control over his strength in such a situation. He sighed as he pulled his fangs out, sucking eagerly at Sherlock's arm, who hissed at the deep bite, but didn't complain.
“John. John, come on, you need to get out of here. They've taken the bullet out. But we need to get you home before they find out.”
“Oh, let's see..” he commented and began unwrapping the present in the same way that Hamish did. It was nice to see how much they valued getting presents. “A pair of gloves and safety goggles. How nice.” he said in amusement.
It may not have been the best timing, but he'd found himself work as a physician right in the middle of a case that Sherlock was convinced was not a coincidence of a threat(?) colliding with a suicide, but actual, deliberate murder.
“I was about to say, John, I have thought a little more.. And I wanted to suggest to you that, if you ever felt the need to have sex with someone, I would be okay if you went out and got yourself a partner after talking about it to me. I would propose an 'open relationship' to you, so you could have sex with changing partners, just as long as you don't fall in love with them.”
“I'm a doctor, I see bare chests on a daily basis. There's nothing I haven't seen, Sherlock... I won't be appalled by a third nipple or a caved-in chest or whatever.” It was reassuring and at the same time, it wasn't. Sherlock wasn't trying to hide a pectus excavatum, he was trying to hide something he'd kept secret from anyone who wasn't his family, something you weren't born with. “And confidentiality applies as well. Not that I would have told anyone anything you didn't want to share anyway..”
“Well, you already know those aren't true. Also, we don't sleep in coffins. Well, most of us.”John added as an afterthought. “You know how people can be.”
His brother straightened himself and released a sigh of disappointment “What dear John is so clearly afraid of is an old story. To sum it up, it tells of a curse that was once laid upon a family of English sailors. In their travels they came across a sea witch with a long-held grudge against humans. She cursed them, making them what you see in John now.”
“Because I hoped it was a one-sided affair.” she admitted, looking sadly at John. “Obviously I was quite blind in that.”
“I've read a myth that the transformation is considered a rebirth that can heal any lethal wound or disease?” Sherlock inquired further, curious.
“Break-in at a bakery, another text on climate change like we didn't know already, celebrities, celebrities and relationships, David Cameron as if you even knew who that is..”
Disheartened, I drew back into my chair, but his kind tone sat with me and spiked my rationality to emerge once more over the sentiments that had had a grip on me the last few minutes. “Quite right. We would hardly want to let the emotions of these moments to guide our actions with the promise of euphoria. So often has it mislead good people into hasty mistakes.”
“Really, it's fine. No need for any of,” he indicated the kit with his hand, “that.” John had treated wounds on him before and there had been casual touches more than a few times between them. However, and Sherlock was certain that it was the source of his nervousness, John had never touched nor seen that general area of Sherlock's torso. And he wasn't sure he was quite ready to share that with John just yet. Or ever.
For all the times he'd mocked, insulted and disappointed John, he was now rewarded with more acceptance, respect and understanding than he knew he could ever give back. What was John even gaining from this, except sexual frustration. He probably even thought Sherlock ungrateful as he never once had said 'thank you' for going at this slow pace. He was useless to John. A friendship that now bound him more than it is supposed to as a relationship of that status.
John looked at him in surprise. “Coffee.” he replied and watched Sherlock make his way back into the kitchen.
Only a force much fiercer, much less forgiving crossed their path. If Sherlock believed in luck, he would call this journey the most unlucky they have had. The English ship they came across overpowered them easily, in their weakened state and he watched his men be slaughtered and drowned. With a nasty trip in his step, he fell backwards over the lip of his own ship. He landed flat and his vision swam before it went black.
“Are you crazy?!” John yelled at Sherlock, who was laying on his back on the moody river bank. John looked at his pale skin a blue-tinged lips.
“I'm sure you have.” Sherlock found himself smiling genuinely. He turned on his side, moving his head closer to John's, swept away by him like a tide. The merman's eyes dropped to his lips and as his own thin stripes of pink parted, his chin tilted away.
One night, about three months in, Sherlock hadn't left the sofa by the time John had finished his routine. He lay there, on his belly, staring at some unidentifiable spot on the floor. John told him he wanted to drop now, but instead of leaving the cushions, Sherlock rolled unto his side, his back pressed against the back of the furniture as if in invitation for John to take the free space, eyes still fixed on nothing. And despite knowing how awkward it was and how many lines he'd be crossing, John lay down next to him, his back to the other man, naturally. Even as he thought it, John couldn't help but notice how incredibly lonely he felt, how much he craved closeness and human touch. It felt bad to use Sherlock like this, but, even though John knew the man didn't view things that way, the younger seemed to feel similar, if he was willing to share such a small space with him. Three months. Three months without contact to the outside world, a bit over two of them without any social contact beside each other whatsoever and they rarely talked, still. So now, cuddling up with Sherlock seemed more comforting than unsettling. Everyone thought them gay already and now no one was around any more, so what did it matter anyway. Right now he was good with just feeling that he wasn't alone in this. All this madness and he didn't have to go through it alone – good enough for him.
Moments later the corpulent figure of Mycroft emerged from the upstairs corridor with an insincere smile. “Ah, brother-dear. I was not told your ship had arrived. You promised your arrival one day ago!”
Sherlock, oblivious as ever, offered a nonchalant “you're welcome” hand waving dismissively. John sneezed suddenly and Sherlock looked at him a little startled. “Getting ill, doctor?”
John sat there for a moment and thought. It had gone rather well, he thought; not perfect, but better than imagined. With a sigh of what was to come, he stood and went to talk to his wife.
In a matter of minutes, they were completely undressed, Watson cradling Holmes' head as he laid him down on his back with another kiss. His hand, the one which wasn't supporting his weight, travelled down Holmes' side, dipping into every little hollow between his ribs until, finally, he grasped his hip by the bone, lifting it with Holmes' own effort as help, and placing one of the cushions underneath. Holmes watched hungrily as his partner poured some oil from the vial into his hand, smearing it around one palm with the tips of his fingers, coating them on all sides before drawing them around his destination to encourage relaxation. One finger pushed inside and his slicked palm closed around Holmes' penis, pulling in gentle, long strokes. When he was sure enough, Watson added a little more oil and inserted a second finger. The calm and peaceful that Holmes had felt before started to vanish, but the pain he felt from the added stretch was only temporarily without further pleasure. He pulled Watson's head down to him.
enticing to you?” the merman asked with a grin. Truly, Sherlock had to admit, he was handsome and he didn't seem too indecent. His curiosity spoke of an eager mind. “I do not wish for your demise, Sherlock, there would be no point. I do envy you, however. You get to conquer both land and water – I am tied to one of them.”
John chipped in. “There's fibres from the rope stuck between her teeth. She must have bitten hard on it.”
Sherlock didn't answer, though, just bit in his toast and continued to analyse a sample of a potato he'd found at their last crime scene.
And Greg did. Sherlock was able to provide brown hair and Turkish roots from the first crime scene and the second revealed that he'd been to a known drug den just before he'd killed his second victim because of a shoe print, apparently. John didn't really get it and Sherlock didn't show any intention in explaining it to them any further.
“Why-ever not?” Sherlock asked, stepping out of the kitchen, cup of tea in hand. His look was one of genuine irritation. And a bit of.. hurt?
However, the sound was curious. There were arms pushing through water, but no legs. If a man came down here to loot further, even without a boat, there should be adequate sounds of a swimming body. Yet the second part of it was missing.
“Because,” John dragged out the word as he turned around, leaving the kettle to boil the water behind him, “I don't think you're quite open to this sort of thing.”
That next morning, John woke to his own sneezing. Dread immediately settled in his bone. He swung himself out of his bed, put on some pants and a t-shirt before making his way downstairs. Sherlock was already awake, leaning over his microscope. John greeted him with an unceremonious “mornin'” and set to brewing some fresh tea.
Sherlock frowned at that. “I wasn't lying, John. Just because I am horrible to adults does not mean I am horrible to children. On the contrary, I find it a lot easier to sympathise with them.”
“Chinese, I should think.” Sherlock replied, mind already a little absent again, as he had stuff to think about and John being out of the flat was the best condition under which to do so. Until he did something unexpected; something
“No, yes of course, I want to. I'm just.. surprised. You know you don't have to do this kind of stuff, right?”
The taller man was intent, however, on getting more attention than that and also gave an answer to all unspoken questions by gently grabbing John's chin, turning it to face him and dropping a long kiss on his lips. They looked at each other for a solid second before Sherlock closed his eyes and John followed him, kissing him back.
“No. That is entirely your decision to make now. I made you an offer – take it or leave it. I'm not going to keep up a pretence marriage under which everyone would suffer.. And I was hoping I could move back in here? Even if you're going to keep up
John hung his head, licked his lips and sighed. “I found you where you were bound to die. I am not keen on having you back out here.”
“This decision is not mine to make, Sherlock. Not that I was ever able to reign in your rebellious mind.” Mycroft said with regret weighing down his words.
“Okay, different game, please!” John moaned, though he sounded amused. “Is there any game you can play without being a smart-arse?”
John sighed. He'd kind of expected that. “Well- just-... look.” he concluded, pulling back his lips to give Sherlock an unhindered view of his teeth. The brunet focused on them with both intrigue and nonchalance, only to spit out his sip of tea when said teeth quickly shot out to become two rows of long, very sharp-looking spikes. It was only the incisors and canines, but enough to have Sherlock clumsily splash more hot tea onto himself from his mug as he tried to dab away at his chin and lips.
John chuckled. “Mainly decoration.” He flexed the muscle briefly, like a handshake. “Is it working?”
“I confess to not knowing much about your kind. I am aware you exist and how many of you live in this country, I keep the number in check. As for you motivation, I remain clueless, albeit, I have never had the chance to really talk to one of you in such kind. I hold no interest in doing so.”
Then, I could not even stay sitting across from him. My excitement forced me onto my legs and I paced for a minute or two. Never had I allowed myself to trust a man like I did my dear Watson and yet there were things strangers knew that I had never dared to tell him. In this one moment, it felt like I had betrayed his trust, but I knew it was a mere fancy of mine. He understood why I had kept it a secret. It was not because I did not trust him. It was out of pure fear. “You are correct.” I finally found the courage to admit. I still dared not to set my eyes upon him, scared that I may reveal more than I intended, but I could sense his own body humming with anticipation, the confirmation to his theory so close to his grasp. But he said nothing. He waited for me to share my part and I was and am grateful for that. I would scoff time and again at my own hesitation and how I took a breath for several seconds before uttering the sentence, “I am a homosexual.” At once, my attention was drawn back to the face of the man who had given me room to admit this. I felt a strange kind of relief, especially as I saw that his face carried no judgement.
“Just figured you might want to put on something clean.” He also left a strip of painkillers on the coffee table and then left for the kitchen, giving Sherlock privacy and filling the kettle with water. By the time tea was ready, Sherlock had turned on his unharmed side and faced the wall.
Sherlock regarded him for a moment, looking him up and down. “I would very much welcome back your constant presence at the flat. Everything else can be discussed another time. You'll excuse me.” He got up and walked down to his bedroom, closing the door behind him.
Holmes smiled briefly, but genuinely. “You seemed interested in it, so I thought we might go Friday night?”
“Jesus, Mary... Won't you even make an effort? This,” he gestured between the two of them, “is not going to work, the sooner you accept that, the sooner you'll be able to find yourself something new, better. She won't be missing a parent; she could have twice as many..” John tried to reason, staying calm and collected although he was getting pissed now internally.
“Okay, stop! You know you could have just waited and asked me when I returned, right?” John requested and judging by Sherlock's expression, the man could not have waited. “Well, first of all, you've seen my fangs. The teeth just morph into shape when I demand it. It's true that human blood is very... enticing to us, but not for the sake of nutrition. It's more like a survival instinct. A vampire's blood can transport all vital nutrients through the body, but not the components of the immune defence system. They are still inside our bodies, but they cannot be transported, so they just die and are replaced without ever doing their duty. That means, that even the smallest illness can be lethal to us
John chuckled lightly. The boy might be incredibly mature and intelligent, but beneath all of that, he was still a five-year-old. “Your father and I will talk about it. Now, let's eat, or you'll never be getting your presents.”
John would spent a lot of time looking outside, watching the stumbling figures with something akin to pity and envy. At least they didn't think about it any longer. Didn't worry.
John immediately retrieved his teeth. They morphed back into the normal set Sherlock was accustomed to seeing in a human being. “Careful!” John's concerned voice rang through his ears and the mug was out of his hands before the trick played out in front of his eyes had even sunk in.
“What? Will what hurt?” John asked, taken entirely off-guard. Sherlock said nothing but simply inched his arm closer to John's face, holding his stare steadily. “Wha?! No! Sherlock, what're you thinking?!”
John turned around putting bacon on a plate. “What are you talking about?” he asked with a smile towards his boys.
The look Mary gave John said more than he cared, but he knew Sherlock hadn't actively antagonised her; he just didn't know better. And he liked routines like that.
Nobody knew how it happened. Of course. No one ever does. Or rather, no one ever informed the people. And then, it was too late.
“I do seem to recall that name and also your account on the case, yes.” I remember it today like I did back then. A trivial affair, but with a number of interesting points that are best told in Watson's words.
Legend has it, merpeople appear only for sailors in desperate need – to save those unsavable. Other myths speak of sirens, luring sailors to their death with beautiful voices to have them crash their ships into rock.
Sherlock gripped the banister, if only to give some venting to the pain, and when he arrived upstairs, John had already removed his jacket. Noises were coming from the bathroom, no doubt John was getting his kit, as Sherlock peeled out of his coat, wincing when the movement stretched his flesh around the wound. He hissed as he peeled his shirt away from the wound, sticking to the coagulating blood.
know. We know we can trust each other to always be there when need be. To know, that we can trust each other with things that we wouldn't tell anyone else. To know, that warmth and intimacy are right here when we need them. That
Immediately, the boy tucked in, but the thoughtful look never left his eyes. He seemed unable to let topics go as easily as other children his age. John looked at Sherlock, who took his hand in a reassuring gesture and started eating as well. He and John had come to an agreement before adopting Hamish: Sherlock had to eat with them when he was home. John didn't want their son to take Sherlock's eating habits as an example and refuse eating as well. Sherlock coped with that surprisingly well. Yes, now and then he commented in annoyance at having gained 3 pounds in the almost 5 years, but it seemed he was more than willing to sacrifice this for the small boy. Sometimes John wondered who loved Hamish more, he or Sherlock? Anyway, he was glad his lover was so consumed by his love for their son. He'd feared Sherlock would have lost interest after a week or two, but it seemed he found great joy in passing on his knowledge on to an empty 'hard drive'. Or maybe he was just enjoying the possibility to constantly show off. Either way, John enjoyed it, too. They were a lot more peaceful and in harmony since they'd included Hamish in their relationship. They weren't as tense towards each other when it came to arguments and were just incredibly glad to get a minute to themselves. Their shared time was rarer, but more intense; cuddling was a real relaxation technique that had them fall asleep on the sofa a lot; kisses were always filled with a certain longing for some time alone, to go deeper; as for the sex, it was mind-blowing, quite literally. Not having your libido constantly satisfied, made the enjoyment all the greater. If sometimes John wished he could spend more time with his husband, he'd make plans with Mrs. Hudson or Greg or Mycroft to take and occupy Hamish for a day or two so he could drown Sherlock in love and romance and sex. Thinking about it, Hamish could really spend a day with his uncle before they'd all travel to the Holmes' the day after. He could play with his new toys and the way too expensive stuff Mycroft always bought him while John tried out his own new toys with his playmate. A kick to his shin under the table made the inappropriate grin on his face vanish as Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him.
With a jolt he sat upright, looking around him until he found John, sitting not far from him, a smile growing across his lips. “I must apologise. We were getting too close. I wanted to see you safe back home and it was easiest to have you out for the time it took us here.”
“Ah, no, sorry. I've Mary come over in an hour or so to discuss a couple things. You tell me all about it when you come back, though.” John replied sympathetically.
Sherlock would have blushed had he understood the concept of embarrassment and not felt so safely embraced in John's presence.
Were John not who he was, he would have picked at Mycroft for that mistake. Speaking specifically of his brother instead of just naming his name, Mycroft had shown weakness, although, John expected, that was just what the pale man had wanted. If John made use of this, he would prove the suspicion, that brought them together here, right. “I can guarantee you that I have no desire in getting close to Sherlock in that way.”
Sherlock pressed his arm against him more forcefully, trapping John head painfully against the wooden headboard. The blond shoved at it with his own hands. “I need too much! It'll kill you or turn you!” he protested.
Holmes retrieved and regarded his pocket watch to find that Watson would still be another two hours. Another sigh escaped him, this time not a luxurious savouring of the moment, but rather resignation to the cruel ways of the universe and its outrageous laziness regarding an increase in the speed of time's progression. He stretched his limbs to work out the little kinks, then resumed his position, hands steepled under his chin, and wandered back off into his memory palace, where minutes progressed at an alternative pace.
He eventually pulled away, licked the limb clean in one swipe of his tongue and cleaned his own lips as well before speaking again. “I should be cooking lunch. We still need to eat.”
Sherlock's lips stretched into a smirk. “Of course not.” He averted his eyes. “So this is it then? You met me again to tell me that we can't happen? You flirt, give me hope, you lead me on and then abandon me?”
It is not my usual fancy writing in prose, however the good man asked me to contribute to his private collections of our adventures in my own hand and there has rarely been a day that I could refuse one of his requests. In his interest, I will recall the events not just as precise as is my usual habit, but also with the touch of romanticism and dramatics that come so naturally to him and have given me many opportunities to frown so very fondly on him.
“Slow, John!” Sherlock whispered, stopping John once he was sitting on the edge of the bed. He carefully pulled off the equipment attached to his friend and then stabilised him as he stood up. He opened a bag he'd brought with him and helped John dress. “Can you walk?” John hummed a vague reply and leaned heavily against Sherlock as the brunet lad him through the halls of the hospital, sneaking him out undetected. They got a cab back to Baker Street.
John chuckled. “Shut up!” he replied fondly, taking a second to rest his tired eyes. “Seriously, though, you don't need to do this stuff. Nothing has to change between us.”
Sherlock, remembering and blushing with a mild shame, pulled his legs to his chest. “So you wish not to see me again? Or is it not possible either way?”
“You were shot. In Afghanistan. You said you never bit someone before, so how did you recover?” Sherlock suddenly asked where he sat, leaning against John.
Every time John asked, she just fussed around more, nervously, almost snappily, insisting that she was alright. So he stopped asking.
The other man had a chance to kill him, and he didn't take it. Instead, he seemed alarmed and with inhuman strength he pulled Sherlock along the water's surface and heaved him onto something wooden. Then a powerful punch to his ribs knocked the wind completely out of him and, with it, the water. He sputtered and rolled to his side as he lost the last gulps of salty water from his lungs and got his first clear view of his saviour. He wasn't an English sailor. In fact, he was no sailor in the first place.
“Breakfast first, love. We can go through the presents together afterwards, hm?”John suggested gently, waiting for Hamish to accept.
John shook his head. “I don't get it, then.” His eyes fell to were the blood-stained shirt hung limply, released by Sherlock's fingers as soon as with John's first words. “Really, I just want to make sure it won't be a problem... Do you. I mean, is it...” John seemed unable to finish his sentence, though his thoughts seemed to have a very good and precise objective in this.
we drink human blood. The fresh blood is capable of transporting everything through our bodies until it's used up by them. That doesn't just count for the immune system illnesses, but any healing process. Broken bones, open wounds. It can all be healed, but nearly always requires fresh blood. That's why we can smell and hear it rushing through bodies, so we have a natural desire to drink it and heal ourselves. It's a rather stupid thing about us.”
“It's hardly my field of expertise, John. I rather thought you would like to take on that task, especially since you are all about doing things the 'child-friendly' way.”Sherlock said, rolling his eyes.
Then again, it had been the night that Moriarty had nearly taken both their lives. Surely that's something to bond over, too, right?
“Is that so? I had not noticed.” Naturally, this was a lie. I cannot claim to speak the truth if I said to have ever held the slightest interest in a woman romantically. When I observe her body, it was ever purely for practical reasons, such as deducing her affairs or assessing an abusive man in her life. Saying it like that, however, did not seem a wise thing to do to me at the time, so I made few adjustments. “However, it is not and has never been in my interest to see a body in light of its aesthetics. My observations are driven by intention, and that is to see through and solve crime.”
John tilted his head in amusement and irritation, looking at Sherlock. “You're teaching him three different languages, Chemistry and sodding forensics, but you can't be bothered to bloody educate him about reproduction?” he asked disbelievingly.
At some point, they heard guns being fired in the distance and made their way in that direction as quickly and undetected as possible.
John and Sherlock's eyes met in the spreading silence of shared knowledge. There was a storm coming.
He didn't correct the taller man when he remarked with a smirk that John was enjoying this. In a very sad way, he did. Sherlock had it all there, in his mind, John could picture it. This was back to war; this was Captain Watson again and yes, the world was dead, their closest friends and family were all likely dead, but he couldn't help it.
John was practically marching inside and up the stairs to the flat, his own pains apparent in the slight limping and swaying.
John could practically hear Sherlock roll his eyes along with the, mildly disgusted, sigh. There was some noise in the kitchen and when it stopped, the detective returned to the room with two plates of steaming lunch. Sherlock himself sat down in the chair by his small desk while John was urged to remain in bed. They ate in silence and John began to wonder.
“You are a captain?” he asked softly. He put his elbows on the wooden plank and rested his ching in his palms. “I have never talked to a captain before. You are quite young!”
Sherlock gasped and put on his worst expression of exasperation on. “You think I'm mocking you?! Oh, no! John, I take it very seriously when you tell me you have lived through two world wars and only got damaged after a hundred years fighting in Afghanistan!” Sherlock would have laughed, John knew he would, only the unmoved features on the blond's face seemed to stop him. “Come on, John, this is pathetic. What kind of game is this? Are you taking the piss on me because I doubted you? Which, frankly, I did not even do.”
Sherlock's gaze fell upon the black hat where it lay halfway between them. He stood and walked towards it, plucking it off the stone by its rim. “Was.” he corrected. “My father died when I was a child. He left behind my mother, brother and myself. I followed in his footsteps, whilst my brother became an English nobleman. He sees keeping me out of trouble with the Queen and the law. Still, I could not stay with him. His reputation denies me that. Our mother is sick. He takes care of her best he can, but we doubt she is long for this world. My crew was my family and my friends. He does me great favours, but I would trade one Lestrade for five Mycrofts.”
Hamish looked back and forth between them for a second before erupting in a loud “Eeeeeeeew!” having John laugh like an unusually amused, ripe tomato.
“Alright, Hamish, you go first. That's your pile over there, pick one and open it.” John instructed as he and Sherlock sank into their armchairs.
After a while, the younger man used his right hand to cup John's chin and turn his head towards him, only to capture his lips in a slow, searing, open-mouthed kiss. Tasting his own blood on John's lips only seemed to encourage him and John let him stick his tongue into his mouth, where they danced for a while until John had to pull back a minute later. He licked his lips, looking over Sherlock's body, knowing the man understood why he'd stopped. The look in Sherlock's eyes, however, was absolutely priceless, his usually so bright and pale eyes dominated by large, black pupils. John pecked his cheek because he couldn't not do it.
John considered that for a second. “Nah, it's not that far yet. I think it's better off compressed a little longer.” With that, Sherlock got up from the bed and went straight next door to get the medicine kit. Back in the room, he followed John's instructions until he was all patched up again.
He moved back in, catching John's lips in a new kiss. One of his legs he hooked behind John's knee, pushing his ankles apart with his heel.
There was a brief flicker of understanding in John's eyes, but nothing more. He reached for Sherlock's wrists, far enough away from the scars and motioned for him to pull down again. “Here, why don't you just undo the lower buttons? You won't have to hold the shirt and I won't see anything.” The care with which John said these words made Sherlock well up with warmth and gratitude. He unbuttoned his shirt until just below his chest. It fell open to his sides and revealed his stomach and the wound, keeping his scars hidden. John said nothing, just quietly cleaned the area. Sherlock tried to suppress any urges to flinch at the pain of the alcohol being rubbed, almost like silk, over his skin, but it stung badly. John inspected the cleaned wound with some gauze in his hand, absorbing any new blood that welled up as he took in the damage.
was real! And if neighbouring countries had been affected with their borders closed, who could guarantee it hadn't reached England yet? Some travellers bringing it in? Something in the water? The air? Birds? There were more possibilities than John wanted to think of.
The whisper drowned in his ear as a long forgotten desire stirred awake inside of him. A feeble sigh escaped his throat and he felt blackness consume him. When next he opened his eyes, the thing on which he lay was not wood. It was hard and slick, uneven. A stone beach. The waves licked up at his side and he wondered how long their soft tones had guided him in his sleep.
Sherlock grinned at that, his hand falling to John's arm, squeezing his biceps. “Then what are these for?”
Sherlock's next question sounded like genuine curiosity, like John was an interesting new specimen or a case rating 8. “Why-ever not?”
Sherlock smiled back at him. There was a silent 'likewise' that no one heard but both knew it was there. “I guess that explains why you became a doctor. Staying healthy so you don't have to drink blood.”
“Don't make yourself too comfortable. We will need...” Watson's speech slowed down as Holmes bent down sideways to produce a vial from beneath the piece furniture they were occupying at the present. “You have planned this all along, haven't you?”
He trusted John. Had trusted him from their very first case together. The possible reaction to his scars was beyond trust, however and he was in awe seeing how John didn't care in the least to even mention it any further.
In the evening, when they were alone in their room, sorting themselves out, Sherlock raised concern over the group possibly just wanting to steal their food and be gone. John argued that even if they'd manage, they could still go back to Baker Street and collect the remaining cans, the ones they weren't able to fit in their bags. It would still be enough for quite a while.
“And you choose to rely on me?!” Sherlock said with an ironic grin that soon changed into a warmer smile when John chuckled.
“I think so.” It was a clear statement that sounded like it had been given a lot of thought. John sounded convinced of his decision.
The smaller man fully climbed on the bed then, sitting up against the headboard next to Sherlock and leaning against him. “You're okay with this, right? The whole touching and kissing stuff?”
“WOW! I can't wait to read them!! Thanks you so much!” another round of pecks followed and Hamish put down the books on the nearby coffee table. Sherlock threw John a contented smile. “You now, papa!” the boy said waddling towards Sherlock with a small bundle in hand and climbing into his lap.
“I figured you'd prefer something less visible, more private. I mean, something that doesn't distract from the important bits.” John smiled, hinting at the engagement and wedding ring that both sat on Sherlock's left ring finger.
On hindsight, John wished he had spent more time talking to her, even before all this had started. He should have listened to her stories, as uncomfortable as they made him feel sometimes; as little as he wanted to know about all that stuff.
It was no exaggeration, this had actually happened before, though John had been asleep in bed at the time. Now, he was nudged and protested being ripped out of his safe-haven.
“There's a lot of children living in patchwork families these days, Mary, and while I could imagine nicer things for my child to grow up with, this is just how we'll have to take it. I'd rather she grows up with content, loving parents, than with unhappy, stressed-out ones.”
Especially at the end, when the old woman became a murder victim. The long time she'd had to wait had driven her to give in to fear and, despite being warned, started describing. Sherlock went still, features carefully schooled, but John read it in his body and his silence. He read it in Sherlock's petulance afterwards: He'd passed the test, but lost the round nonetheless because he couldn't save her. He did care.
“Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.” Sherlock exhaled. “A woman of her height and build? He must be rather strong to lift and hang her up like this. Also at least as tall as she is, as the only thing he could have stepped on in this room was that stool laying on the floor because the only dents in the carpet are those of said stool and that is barely high enough for her to have stood on and touched the ceiling. It must also be someone with particular knowledge of this part of the city. How else would he have know about this unused room
They actually made it out of London by dusk, clearing out and settling in an old apartment building for the night. John dropped the backpacks with a relieved sigh, stretching his back, ignoring Sherlock's offer to swap at least the 50/50 bag with one of John's. However, the younger man did not let him battle him down over taking the night watch, Sherlock just insisted and John was too tired to keep his persistence up.
Hanging his head with a breath bursting out of him, he stood once more, climbing up the rocks into the city. He recognised it the minute his boots touched stone. He was back in London.
Unsure, he leaned forward bit by awkward bit, asking for, but feeling insecure to initiate a kiss. Luckily, John understood and slowly crossed the now very short distance between them, just laying his lips against Sherlock's finding how much he already knew and how far he should take it. Sherlock didn't move, just closed his eyes and John didn't push him, just kept steady against him, making tiny movements every now and then to show the potential of a simple kiss, but leaving it there for now. After a while, he drew back, waiting for Sherlock to process and open his eyes. When he did, John smiled kindly at him, caressing his cheek lightly. “I'm tired, I'll go to bed. Shall I put the rest of your food in the fridge?”
have a key to it. So either raised here or lived here for a while. You will have to show me the other crime scenes for more information on him.”
“It seems to be getting easier each time.” It was merely a whisper from Holmes, but it carried as much weight as anything said out loud.
Sherlock took in the deep circles under the man's eyes and the wrinkles forming all across his face. “Well, I should hope my beauty has not left me when I reach your age in five years time.” he answered in an arrogant joke, closing his eyes.
Mary nodded, unimpressed. “Sorry to have wasted your time.” she concluded, then left the room. It was no use trying to talk about this serious topic when everyone was just edgy about it. Another time.
“No,” John raised his index finger to shut him up, “no, I have not done this for nothing, Sherlock. This is incredibly difficult for me, you know that perfectly well, I have spent valuable time and effort trying to figure these things out and I'm not going to be stopped by your pretentious cold attitude.” something in John's voice made Sherlock quiet. Something always did. “I am sorry for what I said when you came back. I'm sorry for ever blaming you. I'm sorry for leaving you alone.”
