John's forehead furrowed. "Sherlock, I don't want you to push yourself - or worse, allow
"Of course I'm sure. I love you."
Sherlock opened his gorgeous eyes. John could still see fear in them. John took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "It's one of the smaller ships. It's French, returning to the continent. The crew is small, and most of them don't speak English."
Sherlock walked with John across the street to the cafe. John couldn't help noticing that Sherlock looked both ways before stepping into the street this time.
. Let me in."
"Do you enjoy your work?"
John struggled to speak. "
." Then Sherlock's hand was on John's head again, urging him lower.
"You won't do it wrong, John. I promise." Sherlock pressed his mouth to John's briefly. "Although I think we shouldn't be wearing all of these clothes." He grinned at John.
He leans very close to Sherlock, wincing in pain as he moves.
John felt Prince Sherlock tense up against him.
John walked into the dining room. There were five plates on the table. "Who's coming over?" he called out. "I thought it was just me and Harry."
Then he moved on to John's neck, kissing, licking, and nipping at it gently. John felt like he could melt right into the mattress. Sherlock made his way down to John's collarbone, then onto his chest. He continued moving lower, kissing every inch of John's skin. As he reached John's abdomen, John tensed up. He'd put on weight over the years, and he worried sometimes that Sherlock would be put off by his soft belly. He squeezed his eyes closed.
Mike started turning red from stifling his laughter. Sherlock had his hand over his mouth. His shoulders were shaking and he wasn't looking at John.
Sherlock smiled. "Yes, several times. I'll tell you about it when we're somewhere quieter."
John rushed to the bed and gently pushed Sherlock back down. "No, no, no. You're going to stay here and rest."
When he caught sight of John, Sherlock smiled brightly and walked over to him. "Hello, John."
wanted, I would have done it by now."
, John." He put one still-trembling hand on John's cheek. "
"You're not so bad yourself," Sherlock whispered back. He stroked John's hair. "Let's get off the floor. We should have time to lie down and recover for a while before dinner."
Sherlock draped an arm around John's shoulders. John's hands were stroking Sherlock's sides as his mouth began to move over Sherlock's chest and stomach again. "I have wanted you so badly for so long," John whispered against Sherlock's body. Sherlock's head fell back against the door again.
"And look at you, all dressed up! Do you play for the Philharmonic?"
Sherlock's eyes widened in shocked pleasure when he heard the endearment. John stood up and kissed Sherlock again, brushing his hair back gently. "I want you to keep resting. I need to check on some other patients."
Sherlock's POV
John didn't respond. He picked the bread up and took it to the dining room. The doorbell rang. He stood listening to his mother chatting excitedly with her friend for a minute. He sighed.
John smiled into the phone. "I want to cook dinner for you tonight. That way I get you all to myself. I could even kiss you right at the dinner table."
“Oh, John, the mere thought of it makes me weak at the knees. The next time I touch myself I’ll be thinking of you. Would you like that, John? I’ll close my eyes and put my hands on my body.” He tipped his head back slightly, his eyes fluttering shut, his expression enraptured. “And I’ll imagine it’s you, John. Your hands, your mouth, your thick cock. Oh, John,” he moaned. “I’ll come all over myself with your name on my lips.”
"You weren't scheduled to work tonight. I thought..." Sherlock put a trembling hand over his mouth.
"Have you got anything here?"
“We’re offering you the greatest sexual experience of your life,” Sherlock said plainly.
This work is dedicated to L. The journey John takes over the course of this story is one that L. couldn't take. I hope he has found the peace that eluded him in life.
John's hand was on his shoulder. He'd leapt up from the table while Sherlock was talking. "
"Well, yes," Sherlock said, still grinning. "But not as much as you might get think."
Sherlock looked stricken. He stopped struggling and let John push him up into the back of the wagon. John drove away quickly.
"You don't expect me to believe all that gossip, do you?"
Mike gave them bread, salted pork, and milk to eat. "John's told me about your situation, Sherlock. I'm happy to help in any way I can. I want you to make yourself as comfortable as possible here. John can help me with the horses. It'll be quiet here so you can rest."
Sherlock didn’t need to be told twice. He hustled Greg off the barstool, propping him up when his knees gave out.
"Okay."
John's heart was aching for Sherlock. He kept stroking his hair, singing quietly to him until he slept.
Festive Overture, Op. 96
He looked up at Sherlock's window.
John sat at his kitchen table, staring at the phone on the wall. He'd barely slept, tearing himself apart for panicking when he saw Sherlock at the hospital. He rubbed his hands over his scratchy eyes and sighed. He felt nauseated.
When he’d finished, he dropped his hands onto the bed to support himself, taking a moment to recover. He breathed heavily, his wings moving slightly in sympathy with his chest. With his head down, his sublimely beautiful curlicued horns were visible.
"Only women."
"Yes, you do. Come on. I've got more medication for you, but I can't give it to you unless you eat."
When Sherlock relaxed, John sat up and fumbled at his own breeches, his neglected cock aching with need. He freed it, grasping it and moaning quietly in relief. He tipped his head back and closed his eyes. After just a moment, John realized that Sherlock was pulling at his arm and saying, "John, John, let me."
Sherlock looked down at his own hands. He flexed his fingers. He looked back up at John. "The vein in the third finger leads to the heart. That's why women wear their wedding rings on it."
." Sherlock's hands tightened on John's jumper and pulled him a bit closer.
John locked eyes with Sherlock. He nodded once and, drawing in a deep breath, turned and walked away.
"Then it's settled. We just need to decide what our signal is."
John looked down at his wrist. He stroked his fingertips over Sherlock's watch. 8:10. Late enough that Sherlock will definitely be awake, early enough that he won't have left for work yet. John steeled himself and got to his feet.
But I thought-"
And Sherlock was asleep.
John moved higher. As he reached the inside of Sherlock's hip, he could feel Sherlock trembling with anticipation.
“So.”
apologize for that!"
Sherlock shook his head. "Not that. You.
John couldn’t help but wonder if he’d imagined the entire encounter, particularly because the man was the most stunningly beautiful person he’d ever seen.
"Put your weight on me."
Sherlock bent to kiss Greg’s neck. The thick, dark waves of his hair cascaded over Greg’s shoulder. “Take us home,” he pleaded breathlessly, his deep baritone smouldering with desire.
1:50pm
John smiled sheepishly. "What do you want to know?"
John staggered backward, looking away. "It's... it's too small to share comfortably. You wouldn't be... comfortable. With... your leg." He squeezed his eyes closed.
John dropped the box and grabbed Sherlock. Something the old woman had thrown hit him in the back. He dragged Sherlock out the door, even though Sherlock was still yelling in French and was fighting him every step of the way.
"Yes, John." Sherlock reached for his water skin.
Sherlock glared at him. "What do you care?"
true. You don't know. People... don't like me. They don't come near me unless their jobs require it."
John captures Sherlock's hands in his. Sherlock looks down at their joined hands, speechless. He blinks rapidly.
John's eyes were bright. "I'm not everyone else, now, am I?"
So he stayed awake for a long time, memorizing the way John felt in his arms. He didn't want to miss a moment, knowing that any given moment could be the last. As the first pale glow of dawn approached, Sherlock finally closed his eyes and let sleep take him.
"Oh, my love, let me,
Sherlock returned to the rail, finally succumbing to illness himself.
John looked up at Sherlock's window and sighed deeply. Lightning streaked across the sky to the west.
John turned and looked back at the horse. He frowned. "Beau." He looked into Sherlock's eyes again, clearly concerned for him.
John took a deep breath as he burst out of the stairwell and onto the roof of his building. He was still trembling. The night air was cool against his sweat-drenched body.
"I'm looking for adventure after having been laid up with my injury. My mother had family in Wittenberg. I thought I'd start by seeking them out and then see where life takes me."
John sat down on the couch just as the music began. He took a sip of his scotch. It was the most delicious scotch he'd ever tasted.
Sherlock lifted his head. His first priority should be hiding himself as well as possible until he could form a new escape plan. He was way too exposed on the stream bed. Even Mycroft's dimwitted thugs could find him there. Sherlock looked around. He spotted a hollow in the hill with a large tree on one side of it. It was his best chance of staying out of sight until he could come up with a new plan.
"Will you let me hold you?
do it. Someday."
He was just drifting off when he heard it. Footsteps. Someone was running at full speed, approaching the house.
Sherlock's mouth dropped open in shock. He shoved his chair back and stood, glaring at John. His eyes were nearly glowing. "And now you're too concerned about what these
John took his shoes off by the door and left his footlocker in the entryway. He padded to the bedroom to check on Sherlock and found him sleeping deeply. John watched Sherlock's chest rise and fall for a moment before to going to take a shower.
John hung up his cloak before refilling Sherlock's mug. As he handed the mug to Sherlock, Sherlock could smell John's fresh sweat. Sherlock's eyes fell closed for a moment.
John froze.
Sherlock glanced down at his jeans, combat boots, and black Thin Lizzy t-shirt. He looked at John again, tilting his head. "Did you expect me to wear a suit to an Iggy Pop concert? The crowd would tear me apart."
seen. John looked down at his boots again. He slid them under the chair.
All too soon, Sherlock broke their link, returning his hands to their work. He dipped away from John’s mouth to lavish kisses, licks, and caresses over his neck and collarbone. He worked his way lower, lower, covering John’s body with his attentions. John’s head lolled back, his eyes falling closed as he gasped for breath.
John grinned. "I'll think about it. I've never been to the Philharmonic."
He smiled brightly. “Indeed.”
"What, Mom setting me up?"
." Mike stepped closer to Sherlock. "It's your best chance of keeping him safe."
John took a deep breath and walked up to Sherlock's door. He knocked quietly. Sherlock opened the door immediately. "Come in, John. I was just getting a scotch. Would you like one?"
“That is indeed a big, fat cock.” He cupped John’s bollocks, weighing them in his hand.
John laid in bed quietly, absently stroking his fingers over Sherlock's watch. Flashes of lightning filled the room intermittently with harsh light. The answering thunder sounded closer each time it occurred. Large raindrops began to fall against the window. John listened as the rain grew steadier. He shook his head and sighed.
Sherlock ducked around the shelves and found one of his and John's personal bottles. When he came back, he found John still resting on the floor, slumped against the pillar. He'd managed to do his breeches back up, at least.
of this?"
The bartender was back. "She called the ambulance," he said to John. "She's going out front now to flag it down." He kneeled down at Susie's other side and took her hand.
John lowered his head and claimed Sherlock's mouth in a desperately passionate kiss. He rolled his hips gently, dragging his cock against Sherlock's.
"How's the mead coming along?"
After a few minutes, he moved the hand up from his bollocks, stroking his moonlit body indulgently. He’d begun making little noises as he approached orgasm. He moved his flattened hand over his pectorals before abruptly pinching one of his nipples, hard. He cried out, threw his head back, and began to come all over the sheets between him and John.
Sherlock hadn't been able to see the house in the dark. Now that the sun was up, he could see that Mike's house was much like John's. As they approached the door, Mike opened it. "Come in, come in! It's an honour to meet you, sir."
" John hissed. "We're getting out of here!"
made myself clear!
John laughed. "This is what it takes to get you to eat? I can work with that."
"I'll wait for two more days if you want me to. But I don't need them." John leaned in even closer. "Can I take you out to dinner?"
Sherlock sighed heavily. "
"That's it, my love. That's gorgeous," John murmured breathlessly. He began to thrust his hips lightly.
Sherlock nodded shyly. He sat down and picked at the food, eating
After allowing Sherlock a few minutes of experimentation, John took control of the kiss, guiding Sherlock's inexperienced mouth. Soon Sherlock was trembling. His knees threatened to give way again. He reluctantly pulled back so he could speak. "
Sherlock worked his way down John's chest agonizingly slowly as John gasped for breath and clutched at Sherlock's hair with both hands. Sherlock spent an extravagant amount of time teasing each nipple. When the water began to cool, he reached out and shut it off. He pulled up to his full height and stared heatedly into John's eyes before lowering himself onto his knees.
"What's wrong?"
John tamped his anger down and put a big goofy grin on. "You really think he came this way? That would make quite a story to tell next time I visit the village!"
John pulled back. Greg was already wrecked. If Sherlock hadn’t been holding him, he might’ve fallen to the floor.
Sherlock held John tightly in his arms. He was amazed that this exceptional man wanted to be with him.
The world shrank down to just his racing heart and his panic. He found himself at his apartment door with little memory of walking home. He struggled to get his key into the lock with trembling hands. When he finally shut himself inside his apartment, he dropped his keys and shopping bag and fell back against the door. He put his hands over his face and slid to the floor.
Sherlock began to respond. He put one hand on the back of John's head, stroking his fingers through John's hair. His other hand fell lightly against John's waist. He deepened the kiss, opening his mouth to allow John's tongue in. He tasted like scotch and heat and
"Oh, Baby, do anything you want. Your instincts are
John sagged against the fridge in disappointment. "Yeah. Hi. Sorry."
Sherlock was standing near the door, clutching his violin case to his chest. John walked over to him. "Are you okay, Sherlock?"
Every time John opened Sherlock's shirt and found his dog tags there against Sherlock's chest, warmed by his body heat, John paused to touch them. In those moments, his heart felt so full he thought it might burst. The presence of his dog tags against Sherlock's chest and the now-familiar weight of Sherlock's watch on John's wrist were tangible reminders of their growing devotion to each other.
5:20pm
Confessions are made.
John grinned. He looked down at Sherlock's hand. Tap, tap, tap. John's heart swelled. He locked eyes with Sherlock, then stepped forward.
John was silent. After a moment, Sherlock reluctantly turned to look at him. John was staring at the gold in his hands, his mouth open in shock. He looked up at Sherlock. "You're joking."
Athens. I was running
John put his hand around his dog tags. Sherlock moved over him, holding himself up with both arms. John looked up into Sherlock's eyes and let go of the tags. They fell onto his own chest as he wrapped one arm around Sherlock's waist. He put his other hand in Sherlock's hair and pulled him down into a deep kiss.
"Hmm?"
Greg responded beautifully to John, melting at his touch. Sherlock was off his barstool and had both hands on Greg’s shoulders. He stroked down his back and then ran his hands up onto Greg’s chest, embracing him firmly from behind. Greg gasped against John’s mouth.
As they walked to John's car, John glanced around nervously. He hoped his neighbors wouldn't see him escorting a disheveled young man out of his apartment just after dawn. He was already worried about what they must have heard the night before. Sherlock had been kind of... vocal.
Every time John closed his eyes, he saw Sherlock. He saw him sitting in the cafe across from John with his eyes bright. He saw him laughing. He saw him crouched in front of John on the sidewalk. And he saw Sherlock's face when John pulled away from him. He saw the pain in Sherlock's eyes. The confusion.
John giggled against Sherlock's neck. "I might be convinced to make that sacrifice."
John put his hands up in surrender. "All right... Sherlock." John bent down and pulled Sherlock's right boot off. "You should probably change into something more comfortable. Do you have a nightshirt in your pack?"
"Don't take your eyes off me."
"Henry Baker, musician. Hobbies include horse training and gentry cuckolding. I can remember that."
He felt Sherlock's chuckle. "Indeed."
John smiled to himself when he heard the huge crash of breaking glass behind him. The poor bastard must’ve been holding a nearly-full bottle. Greg didn’t seem to even register the sound, lost as he was in Sherlock’s kiss.
Sherlock rushes back to John, kneeling next to him.
John knelt down next to Sherlock and put his hand on Sherlock's cheek. "You look much better. How do you feel?"
John managed to jerk his head back up.
John was only inches behind him now. "Perhaps not."
"I didn't know it, but I was waiting for
Sherlock was looking at John with unmasked adoration. He reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out a small box. John's mouth dropped open in shock. Sherlock smiled radiantly. He opened the box. Inside was a gold wedding band.
Sherlock's hand landed on John's shoulder. "John, I'm sorry."
Sherlock's fingertips made their way from John's shoulders to his neck to just behind his ears. Sherlock cupped John's face in his graceful hands and slowed their kiss. John sighed as Sherlock's mouth became more deliberate, more tender, almost... worshipful. John responded in kind, pouring all of his adoration, wonder, and yearning into their kiss.
Sherlock propped himself up on his elbows. "As many times as I've tried to tell you, you still have
As soon as Sherlock bolted the door, they both shed their boots and clothes. Sherlock glanced at their mantel and smiled when he saw that John had put two sprigs of fresh lavender in his mother's vase. John's bed was closest to the door, so they collapsed into it clad only in their underclothes, tangling their limbs together. Sherlock sighed contentedly. Then he giggled quietly.
John watched Sherlock’s expression grow more and more aroused as he took John’s pleasure. His hips began to roll, in time with his other movements. He clutched harder and harder at John’s leg. Just when John thought his claws would surely break the skin, filed down or not, he raked his hand down John’s thigh and shoved it between his own legs.
The first time it happened, John was on the tube. He swayed slightly in his seat as the carriage rocked, arms draped loosely over his cane.
Sherlock grew more and more relaxed and heavy in John's embrace. His breathing was slowing. John found himself drifting toward sleep as well.
John threw his trousers and pants aside and got into bed next to him. "Impatient."
Sherlock turned his head so he could see John's face. John's smile vanished as he saw Sherlock's expression. "
"No, John, I was so thankful you weren't anywhere near those guards!" Sherlock leaned a tiny bit closer to John. "
John froze, suddenly unsure of what Sherlock expected from him. And afraid he wouldn't get it right. Sherlock was watching him carefully. He reached up and put his hand on John's cheek. "John. We don't have to do anything if you don't want to."
John thanked Mike profusely and took Sherlock upstairs, straight into a warm shower. Sherlock's whole body had stiffened up from the battering he'd received in the water. Bruises were blooming all over his pale skin. John got into the shower with him, gently shampooing his hair for him while carefully avoiding the stitches in his temple.
They didn't talk much at dinner. John picked at his food. Sherlock didn't take a single bite. He sat with his arms crossed and looked out the window.
"John, your bed is the other way."
. Perfect. Come on, show me!"
Sherlock was utterly lost. He gasped for breath when John's tongue darted across one of his nipples and then the other. He whimpered desperately.
"Smart," Sherlock said. John ducked his head, smiling sheepishly.
His brow furrowed. “Pardon?”
John whimpered again. With great effort, he lifted his head, nodded, and dropped it back down on Sherlock's shoulder.
John closed his eyes. "I hope you're right, Sherlock."
6:00am
John pushed on. “My name is John Watson.” He flexed his hands in the demon’s hair, stroking his scalp even as he used his grip to keep that small distance between them. He raised his eyebrows expectantly.
John watched Sherlock again. He began to notice the other violin players - in fact, all of the string players at times - looking to him as well as to the conductor. Then he began to notice the signals Sherlock was giving the others as he was playing. He was communicating with them by gesturing with his head, his violin, his bow, his shoulders, and even his facial expressions. John was struck again by just how remarkable Sherlock was.
Monday, August 1st, 1977
Sherlock hesitated.
John sighed against Sherlock's mouth. He gently pushed Sherlock against the back of the couch and leaned over him. He slid one hand up into Sherlock's hair. It was even softer than it looked.
"Why would you want to?"
Why was John pushing him away every time the heat between them began to build? Sherlock knew John felt it. He'd seen the desire in John's eyes several times. And yet, each time, John had abruptly broken eye contact with him.
After dinner, John walked with Sherlock back to his car. Sherlock stopped and pulled a record out of his bag. "This one is for you," he said, handing it to John. "I think you'll like it if you give it a chance."
Sherlock pulled John's hand closer, gazing at his father's wedding ring around John's finger. He rested their joined hands over his heart and closed his eyes. "So am I."
John backpedaled quickly. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean -"
"But as for this morning, John, I want to see you spend for me
Pleasure surged through every cell in John's body. He arched against the window, crying out uncontrollably. "Oh, Sh-Sherlock, oh, God,
"You sure? I don't want to wind up in the stocks, you know."
Greg nodded. “I do appreciate that, actually.”
John's body relaxed, going so limp he almost fell onto Sherlock. Sherlock finally released him. John pushed back from the wall on trembling arms, sliding back into the bed next to Sherlock. "Oh, God,
Sherlock tucked John's left wrist between John's own right wrist and Sherlock's left hand. He then dragged his right hand down John's arm, continuing down his chest and stomach before plunging his hand into John's underclothes. He took hold of John, dragging his thumb through the precome on the head of John's cock.
John and Sherlock stayed at the restaurant until it closed. John kept catching himself gazing at Sherlock instead of eating. He was transfixed by the way the light from the candle on their table played across Sherlock's face and caught in his eyes with a verdigris glow. He was admiring the graceful curve of Sherlock's neck when Sherlock brought his hand up and rubbed at it as though the muscles were cramping. John's breath caught. As Sherlock lowered his hand, he dragged it down through his open collar. John felt his cheeks going pink. And then he saw the wicked little smirk that passed briefly over Sherlock's face.
John fidgeted nervously. "I... I can't stop thinking about you. Monday was... well, I haven't connected with anyone like that since... well, ever."
Sherlock leapt down from the second level of the storage shelves. As he straightened up, he smiled. "After all this time, you still think you can sneak up on me."
He heard the water running in the bathroom as he finished cooking the bacon. He kept himself busy, waiting. Sherlock appeared in the doorway, smiling sheepishly. He'd put on his trousers and shirt, although the shirt was untucked and only partially buttoned. His hair was tousled and his feet were bare. He was
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=V_ew2bEKxw4
," John growled. He turned and rushed through the door, refusing to waste another second looking at the sneer on that prick's face. Sherlock's Mustang flew past him as he ran out onto the sidewalk. "
John grinned at Sherlock. "You complaining?"
"No, John. I don't."
John is clutching at Sherlock's arm with his other hand.
Disappointment flashed across Sherlock's face. "Why would you cause a problem?"
John smirked a bit and relaxed down onto Sherlock's shoulder.
John pulled his underwear and trousers up. He shook his head, still marveling at his luck. He was grinning like a fool when Sherlock grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the entryway, through the living room, and into a spacious and elegantly appointed bathroom. Sherlock handed him a washcloth.
. John leaned over the table and spoke quietly. "Okay. We're even now."
Sherlock reached out, lifting his hands to hold John's face. "But - why didn't you say anything until now?"
The human immediately sat up straighter. He looked first at Sherlock, eyes widening as he took in his arresting beauty. He turned to look at John.
Sherlock dropped the shirt on the floor next to John. His eyes were bright with passion as he took in the sight of John standing in front of him. John saw him shudder. "You're stunning," Sherlock whispered.
"And you're her
"No, you're not!" John wrapped his arms back around Sherlock and looked to the police officers. "What happened? Where did you find him?"
A wave of guilt crashed over Sherlock. John was in danger because of him. He never should have let John help him. If John Watson came to harm because of Sherlock...
When Sherlock opened his eyes again, it was dark outside. The only light in the small house came from the fireplace. The house smelled incredible. John had placed the rye loaf on the kitchen table. He was putting flat bread into a small bag. Sherlock looked into the fireplace and saw two potatoes roasting. The pot of rabbit stew was hanging above the flames.
The entire room went out of focus. Sherlock had hesitated too long. Oh,
Sherlock shook his head slowly.
"I love you, Sherlock. I
"Not yet," Sherlock said quietly.
"Then why can't you believe me?" He took Sherlock into his arms.
Sherlock's face lit up anew. He turned his head to the side and giggled quietly.
John's eyes softened. "All right, Sherlock." He took his hand away from Sherlock's. The top of Sherlock's hand felt cold without John's. John took a small bite of stew. "You, too," he said, gesturing at Sherlock's plate.
"But I've kind of had this idea in the back of my head." John took a moment to compose himself. He took a deep breath. "I was thinking, maybe instead of looking for another job at a hospital or a clinic, maybe I could... start my own practice."
like it... quite a bit." He glared at John accusingly. "What have you done to me?"
"That's... you're... remarkable."
"I'm still going to
Sherlock put his boot into the top of his pack, and put the glove back between his teeth. He began to shove himself backward toward the hollow. He stopped to sweep his cloak over the rocky bank to camouflage his drag marks. He slowly made his way to the base of the hill below the hollow, stopping frequently to disguise his path. Tears streamed down his face. His teeth were clenched around his glove. He was trembling from shock, exertion, and pain.
A note about protection: As an incubus, Sherlock is not susceptible to human disease. He doesn’t need protection, but humans do. Please be safe!
John was patting at Sherlock's head again and trying to speak. Sherlock knew John was trying to warn him that he was going to come.
"Yes... in French. Will you tell me what you said?"
He dropped clumsily down onto the ground, pushing his hands into his hair and fisting them.
, John."
He leaned in and splayed his hands over John’s chest, stroking him just a bit too aggressively. John gasped at the contact on his bare skin. He shuddered hard.
The demon’s mouth had opened against John’s neck. The heat of his breath and the soft, wet pressure of his tongue sent ripples of desire through John’s entire body.
"I just don't know what the point is. He's been gone a week already. He'll have crossed by now. Or he went north instead."
"And you know that over the last couple of weeks, I've been contacting as many people as I can, asking around about possible job openings."
Sherlock groaned again. "Don't want it."
John was still retching, but had long since stopped bringing anything up. He slid down into a heap on the deck. Sherlock was leaning down over him, holding his upper arm. "John!"
His cheeks became even more flushed.
"Indeed. You did well to choose a spot by the railing."
, Sherlock!"
He chuckled deeply. “They would tend to draw a bit of unwanted attention.”
Sherlock nodded.
"That doesn't make sense, John."
John went back to the house. He quietly put together some food for supper while Sherlock watched. When he was done, dusk was falling. He went outside to wait for Mike, planning to take care of his horse for him.
The two guards were absentmindedly looking through the crowd. As they got closer, Sherlock began to be able to hear what they were saying to each other. He lowered his head another inch, obscuring his face completely.
7:45pm
Sherlock's brow furrowed. "I've interrupted your work. You were hunting this morning?"
"I'm sorry, Sherlock." John was still backing up. He felt dizzy with panic. "I'm sorry. I have to... go. I have to go. I'm sorry." He turned and started walking away quickly.
John leaned a tiny bit closer. "I think I understand, though, because it hurts me when I can't touch you." His eyes searched Sherlock's. "It hurts when I can't kiss you. Is that what you mean, Sweetheart?"
John turned to see a man approaching them. Sherlock stepped toward him. "Hello, Angelo," he said as he shook the man's hand. "Angelo, this is John. John, this is Angelo, the store's owner."
Sherlock tried to smile at John. "Nothing, John. It's nothing."
shows up in your bedroom and you ask him to be your
John poked at the macaroni again. "That's all, though. These are ruined."
"Okay," John whispered. He got out of Sherlock's car and quickly got into his own car. As he watched Sherlock drive away, he realized he was shaking. He folded his arms on top of the steering wheel and dropped his forehead against them.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fs1Omb47ins
I am. Where did you get this, Angelo?"
John’s arms strained against his bonds as his heart ached with the need to wrap them around the astonishing creature in his lap and hold him closer. Sherlock moved his hands onto John’s shoulders. He traced his way down John’s arms and over the ropes to interlock their fingers. John thought his heart would crack open. He held on to Sherlock’s hands for all he was worth, and Sherlock kissed him as though the world was ending.
Sherlock's eyes darted back to John's.
"Have to get used to calling you that." John smiled ruefully.
"You're sure about this?"
John closed his eyes, struggling to stay calm. He was squeezing Sherlock's arm.
"It's all right."
John looked terribly worried. "Yes, of course it's me!" He put his hand on Sherlock's cheek.
Sherlock tensed up. "John, I need to ask something of you."
After he'd cleaned his shoe, John dropped onto his couch and draped his arm over his eyes. He was exhausted. He drifted into an uneasy sleep.
The weight on John's head lifted. John looked up as Sherlock grasped the baluster again.
John hadn't slept in his own bed since the first night they were together. He couldn't get enough of Sherlock. And Sherlock couldn't seem to get enough of John. But this wasn't just sex - although the sex was simultaneously the most intense and the most loving he'd ever experienced. John had never opened his heart to anyone the way he had to Sherlock. They talked about
Mycroft nods again and exits.
Silence.
Sherlock's POV
Sherlock and John picked up their shopping bags and walked outside. The evening air was pleasantly cool. "Which way are you headed, Sherlock?"
John stroked his fingertips over the letters. He moved to put the watch down, but found he didn't want to let go. He smiled again as he slipped the watch into his pocket.
He watched in awe as Sherlock held eye contact with someone behind the bar. John pulled back a bit more to give him room to work. Sherlock dragged one of those big graceful hands back over Greg’s body and up into his silver hair, never breaking eye contact with his new quarry.
The prince glared at John. "And just who do you think I am?"
." Heat was building in Sherlock's gaze.
Sherlock untied his own breeches and tipped his head back, sighing in relief as he took himself in hand. The ache in his jaw only increased his arousal because it was a reminder of what he and John had just done.
John's voice was tight. "It's my pleasure. I'd do anything for you, dear heart."
Location Note:
. He looked down at his wrist, tracing his fingers over Sherlock's watch.
to push you - into anything you don't want."
Sherlock knew he needed to leave. It was tearing him apart to know that John would be hurt when Sherlock disappeared, but he couldn't stay and continue to endanger him. Sherlock couldn't bear the thought of John suffering because of him. He would wait for John to go to sleep and steal away into the darkness. The problem was that Sherlock was finding it increasingly difficult to imagine a future for himself that did not include John Watson.
Harry's 39, not 100." He looked up at the ceiling and sighed. "You've got to stop doing this. If I get married, I'll do it when I'm ready."
. If I... come out... she'll disown me."
Sherlock's foot came off the accelerator. "Sorry."
Sherlock grinned against John's neck. "Yes, I know."
When Sherlock finally took John's aching cock into his mouth, John whimpered quietly. He rocked his hips up to meet Sherlock's movements. After only a few minutes, he could feel his peak approaching.
Sherlock closed his eyes. His heart was already pounding in anticipation.
“Do you want to touch me, John?”
Sherlock bit John's earlobe lightly before pulling back. "I heard you, you know."
"Arms out. Hold on to the shelves."
"If I wouldn't be imposing..."
"I can meet you outside in ten minutes."
Sherlock let out a loud, exasperated whine.
John trailed a finger down the back of Sherlock's neck.
an idiot!"
"Yes, John."
"Fourteen."
Sherlock nodded, smiling shyly. They walked together for a long while, eventually circling back near Angelo's. As the hour grew later, John suggested stopping for dinner at a small Chinese restaurant just around the corner.
"I'll bet it was more than a few."
Rimsky-Korsakov, Scheherazade (The second movement begins at 10:20):
"Good night, John," he said softly.
, Sherlock..."
Sherlock sighed and squeezed John tightly before letting go and sitting up straight. "Fine. Let's go."
Sherlock began shouting at the old woman in French. The old woman screamed back at him.
"Why don't you sit down, John," Sherlock said quietly. "I'll put the record on." He walked over to an impressive stereo system built into the shelving on the walls.
3:15pm
John walked quickly toward him, heart pounding in his chest. "What are you doing here? Is something wrong?"
He got up and tended to the fire, making sure it wouldn't go out overnight. "I should probably get some sleep. I'll be out hunting before dawn."
"It's fine."
John stood frozen, afraid to move or speak, watching Sherlock. Sherlock returned his gaze for a few seconds before backing up and taking hold of the door.
"The men around me managed it. They got married while they were in school. Before they shipped out. Hell, some of them got married while they were on leave. If I'd really wanted a wife, I'd have one. But somehow I never found the right person." He squeezed Sherlock's hand and looked into his eyes. "Now I know why."
He drifted for a few minutes before opening his eyes. Sherlock was leaning over him. He put his clean hand in John's hair and kissed him tenderly. John smiled. "I love you, Sherlock."
"A little," John replied sheepishly. "Want to go get something?"
This chapter contains references to suicidal thoughts. Please skip it if this will adversely affect you.
"Can I get you gentlemen anything? Ale? Water? I've got a fresh rabbit, just shot it this morning. You're more than welcome."
." Sherlock's arm tightened around John's waist. "I feel the same way about you. You're incredible. And you have the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
John groaned again and rolled over.
"For telling me about yourself. I get the feeling you don't do that with other people very often."
"I stole these from the Lord I'm running from!"
John smiled weakly. "Of course. Are you sure about the car?"
"Doctor Watson."
"All right, Sherlock."
"I just need to check if I got the height right. We need to get you mobile as soon as possible. It's too dangerous to have you laid up." John was still grinning at him.
"Because I'm still over here. With you looking so gorgeous over there." John leaned forward. "
"I didn't forget my watch this morning."
Sherlock was in agony. He watched John walking away at a brisk pace, knowing he had no hope of catching up to him on crutches.
"Sherlock!" He was touching Sherlock's shoulder, shaking him gently. "
John nodded. "Yes, I think so." He stroked Sherlock's hair. "Oh, Sherlock, I've never been so terrified. Not even in battle. I thought I might lose you." He buried his face in Sherlock's cloak.
Saturday, September 10th, 1977
After cleaning up, they twined themselves together under the covers. John lazily kissed Sherlock's neck, tangling his fingers in Sherlock's hair.
Sherlock looked up at the ceiling. "You are clearly a man of integrity. You would never keep an item of value such as my watch. You would bring it back to me, even if you..." He hesitated. "Even if you... changed your mind about me."
"I tried to call you, but you didn't answer. I couldn't just stand there and watch."
" John dropped his hand a little too hard on the table, rattling the silverware.
John kissed Sherlock senseless before sitting back up. "I need to go to the cellar before it gets any later. I'll be back in a few minutes, my love."
Sherlock tensed back up. "John..."
John lifted his head a couple of inches and let it thump back down onto the door. "Sherlock,
Sherlock just shook his head.
A pained look crossed Sherlock's face. He moved to get up. "We can spread your things out in the office to dry. I've got a fan in the cupboard, and we can open the window."
"Shhh." John rubbed Sherlock's thigh soothingly.
"Think nothing of it."
. They talked for countless hours, whether it was over a meal or tangled together Sherlock's bed. Sherlock hadn't just let John into his bed. He'd let John into his heart.
John was incredulous. "Best day of your - Sherlock, you
John put his cloak on and shouldered his bow and quiver. He crossed the room to Sherlock's side. He stroked Sherlock's hair. "I'll be back as soon as I can." He leaned down and kissed Sherlock. He moved to stand back up.
He finally dropped into the hollow. The glove fell from his mouth as he buried his face in in his hands for several minutes. He took a deep breath, slid his pack off his shoulders, and pulled the boot out of it. Sherlock took his vielle case out of his pack and pulled his other glove off. He opened the case and checked the instrument for damage.
Sherlock waited outside the horse seller's barn while John chose their horse. He would have liked to have helped John choose, but he knew it was a risk. And he knew John's knowledge of horses was solid after working with Mike.
“Goodbye, John.”
"Kiss me."
“Are they sensitive?”
John drove Sherlock to a cocktail bar. He felt self-conscious about his car, a green Chevy Vega, after having seen Sherlock's Mustang. But the main thing on his mind was how grateful he was that Sherlock seemed to have cautiously forgiven him.
John was amazed yet again with Sherlock's abilities. "Which languages can you speak?"
He was exhausted from his night shift at the hospital.
, John thought.
After a few quiet minutes, Sherlock got out of bed and went to clean up. John stayed where he was, drifting toward sleep.
"Now?"
Sherlock drank gratefully. John opened his pack and gave Sherlock some flatbread, dried meat, and chestnuts as well. He sat down next to Sherlock. Sherlock pulled him close. He untied his cloak and wrapped it around both of them so he could keep John warm. They ate silently.
John sat up a little, propping his head on his hand. "Mauled?"
Sherlock closed his eyes. John kept stroking his hair.
hard cock rubbing along Sherlock's.
Sherlock grinned at him. "That sounds nice. Mind if I join you?"
2. The Story of the Kalendar Prince
3:50pm
to want those things. But, Sherlock, I'm thirty-seven years old. If that was what I
John turned his head to look at Sherlock. He lifted his arm and pushed Sherlock's hair back from his forehead. "I love you, dear heart."
"Well, I'm not sorry." John put his hand on Sherlock's cheek. "We'll build a better one. Somewhere no one will find us."
," he pleaded. His eyes fell closed and he swayed unsteadily.
John gazed up at Sherlock. His dark curls were shining in the sunlight and his indigo shirt was playing up the blue in his eyes. "Which way shall we go, John?" he asked.
You're stunning, John."
You knew I was going to do this!"
John was quiet for a few moments. "It took a long time to recover from my injury. After I was healed enough to be on my own, I wanted the solitude. I may eventually move back to the village, find a wife. But I'm happy here for now."
John's hands were trembling, but he managed to put the condom on.
Sherlock's smile was brilliant. John instantly felt lighter. He smiled back as he was swept into a tight embrace. "Thank you, John," Sherlock said quietly. "I don't want to go without you."
Sherlock smiled shyly at him. "You look very dashing."
"I'll hold it back here for you while you finish looking around," Angelo said. "You and your date." He grinned at John.
John sat back down on the edge of the bed. Sherlock put his hand on John's right shoulder and began to move behind him. John turned to see what he was doing. "Stay right there," Sherlock whispered.
"Baker."
He released John’s hair with a shove and pushed back, dropping his hands onto John’s thighs, just above the knee. His claws dug in hard, the filed-down tips the only thing keeping them from puncturing the skin. John gasped.
"You're so good for me. And so beautiful." John stroked Sherlock once before pressing an open-mouthed kiss against Sherlock's aching cock.
! How could it possibly be the -"
“Try me.”
"Much better, thank you." Sherlock smiled at him genuinely. He wasn't used to liking other people, but Mike was easy to like. And John's regard for him was the best possible endorsement anyone could have.
He raised one eyebrow. “Perhaps, but was what I said inaccurate?”
John took a moment to look at Sherlock, trembling beneath him in the firelight. "So beautiful," he whispered. He put his hands on Sherlock's waist. He dragged his left hand down the hollow of Sherlock's hip and grasped his erection. Sherlock cried out, arching his back. John stroked him once, pushing his thumb across the head. Sherlock shuddered and cried out again. "J-John!"
John groaned. "Oh,
Elgar, Enigma Variations (Ninth Variation 12:20-15:50):
Sherlock had never known anyone quite like John. He had seemed like a simple man at first, but the longer Sherlock observed him, the more fascinating he became. There was such strength in him, and he was clearly intelligent. He was handsome and pleasant to talk to. Why hadn't he married and had a family? Why had he hidden himself in this remote place? Sherlock found that he wanted to know
“Oh, God Sherlock,” John muttered under his breath as Sherlock panted into his mouth, working himself up from the thrill of it alone. John gripped his arse, egging him on, and Sherlock continued to hump without shame. Sherlock reached down to cup John through his trousers, groaning at just the feeling of him hard beneath his hand, till John’s patience broke down.
“You’re the one that said I looked about 12, but that I was undeniably charming anyway – what does that say about you, I wonder?” Sherlock delivers breathlessly, entirely falling short of haughty.
I’m begging you to stop. But they’re both laughing now, and John’s pleased. Very pleased. Even that’s perhaps an understatement.
He received no response, beyond John’s mouth falling open, his face a mixture of shock and confusion.
John was stationed in Kandahar when Sherlock Holmes died. He wasn’t the first to learn of it, despite having preordered the novel. By the time John received it overseas, he was given a sympathetic look from the subordinate handling deliveries. News traveled fast, and everyone now knew it was to be the last instalment.
Except, after having already been asked three times, John finally answered, “Starving.”
“But how could it have happened?” he wondered aloud. The visit to his mind palace had provided him the opportunity to assemble puzzle pieces of John’s past behaviour, but had not in any way explained the event itself. “You would never have drawn a gun on someone without cause, you treat firearms with care and respect. You would only shoot to kill if in self defence, or in defence of someone else’s life.”
Sherlock’s anxiety did not abate. Moriarty being glad, encouraging him to find this number, did not bode well. Sherlock stared at John, but John was no longer looking back at him.
John was forced from that moment onward to live in a state of constant fear of discovery, and with the knowledge that everything he had done in the name of his parents’ legacy was largely for naught. John had brought Mary on himself for the good of Manderley, had suffered her and their loveless marriage for years, and he knew now it was for nothing at all - beyond ensuring his own eventual ruination. A futile attempt at selflessness, and all John had gained in return was a limp and a guilty conscience.
And there was the rub, the reason why it seemed undeniable that this fling was over before it had even gotten off the ground—she honestly might have. His being a doctor might have just slipped her mind, given the nature of their superficial, no strings attached relationship—as dictated by her, not him. Not that it was anyone’s fault. She had made it clear from the outset that she didn’t want anything serious, or monogamous. They were adults, John had thought, and a friends with benefits arrangement was technically “doing something,” though John imagined that was not what his therapist had envisioned when she suggested it.
As the doors close Sherlock realises this time he hadn’t actually had any destination in mind.
“No,” he said, turning to look back out the window. “I’d rather not.”
“When?” Sherlock demanded, eyes searching John’s entire person, as if he could deduce it from one of John’s loose cardigan buttons.
“Frankly, I’m terrified in my own home,” she concludes, looking across at John entreatingly.
“Er, yes," John said, thinking he wasn’t much of a young man. “Do you mind if I borrow your broom by the way?”
He decided it didn’t matter. He would protect the memories regardless of what Watson thought. And he would never tell anyone about these drives, ever, so that they could never be tarnished. Especially not by Wilkes.
Only, being angry with John ultimately meant thinking about John, and the true source of his frustration. Which had only been mounting. The sweet kisses from the day before, which John had broken off. The figure he cut in his suits. His still-tanned skin, all covered up beneath starched white collars. His tongue peeking out to lick his lower lip. Maddening.
It was his turn to stare at Lestrade’s profile, while Lestrade faced ahead. What a peculiar thing to say.
Last night he dreamt he went to Manderley again.
“Really Sherlock,” Watson said, and the sound of his name was warm and natural. Perhaps they had been on such familiar terms for some time. Yes, that seemed right.
“Never mind that, I can start without you.” It did feel a bit wrong to see their rooms without John, but surely he could do this simple thing alone.
“That was Colonel Barclay just now, and all the arrangements for pulling the boat out have been made,” John said as he closed the door behind. “Tomorrow morning the diver is going back down and they’re going to raise the boat. I’m going to go out with them.”
Not for the first time since beginning this case, John feels completely out of his depth.
John read on, expecting the same detached tone that was used to discuss enemas to continue into the more amorous parts of the proceedings. However, while language and style remained unchanged, John was surprised by the suggestions for how to “warm” the partner up. A bum rub and analingus were listed in the same breath as spanking, for God’s sake, and John had to wonder who the hell had written this with such a serious and determined air. The guide informed him that if enough warm up was provided, the partner in question might even beg for it, which had John’s eyebrows meeting his hairline, and his lips meeting the rim of his scotch glass.
"Good morning, John."
Sherlock's hips pushed up against John. He cried out, "Oh, God, John,
Hours passed. Sherlock's body began to adjust to the motion of the ship. When he felt strong enough, he stood slowly and went to John. John was curled up on the deck, pale and sweating. His eyes were closed. Sherlock bent down carefully and put his hand on John's back. John opened his eyes. Sherlock spoke gently to him. "Come sit with me."
"All right, Henry, I'm going to put down my bow and you're going to put away your knife so I can help you."
,” he hissed.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kD5X5OGLySI
Sherlock's chest heaved as he tried to catch his breath. His eyes remained closed. John took each of Sherlock's arms and moved them down, one at Sherlock's side and the other draped over John.
"No?"
He let Sherlock's hair loose, turned around, and leaned back against the window. It felt cold on his back. He looked up at Sherlock. Sherlock took John's face in both of his hands, looking into John's eyes heatedly. He surged forward and claimed John's mouth in a scorching kiss. John fisted his hands in Sherlock's shirt, pulling him even closer. Sherlock pressed all the way in, pinning John to the window with his body. John groaned against Sherlock's mouth and began working at his buttons.
Sherlock leaned across the table. "If this is a woman who would disown her only son, why do you care so much?"
Sherlock flopped back down. He reached across John to capture his left hand, weaving their fingers together. "I'm completely serious, John. I'd never seen anything sexier. It's a wonder I survived, really."
, I'd have flipped you over and swallowed you down by now."
Sherlock helps John stand up. John is unsteady, clearly hurting.
John went back to the barn to see if he could make himself useful while they waited for Mike. He'd insisted that Sherlock rest on Mike's bed while John worked. He decided to muck out the horses' stalls. When he'd finished, he walked outside. The sun had dropped low in the sky.
John squirmed at the sensation on his overstimulated skin. He nudged Sherlock with his knee. “Give us a better look at it? I can’t quite see all of it from this angle.”
John’s head lolled against his shoulder as his eyes rolled back in ecstasy. A firm pinch to his thigh jolted him back upright. Sherlock flicked his tail and stared intently up at John. The message was clear:
John kissed Sherlock quickly and ran back up the stairs. "I'll come back for you."
Sherlock smiled and wrapped his arms tightly around John.
They stood silently for several more minutes, looking out over the lights. John felt Sherlock tense up slightly. "John, I've been wanting to talk to you about Christmas."
"Why?"
John's blood ran cold.
"What's her name, John?"
John sighed against Sherlock's shoulder. "Neither have I, Sherlock." He lifted his head and put a hand in Sherlock's hair. He drew Sherlock in for a tender kiss. Then he put their foreheads together for a moment, stroking his fingers through Sherlock's hair.
He reached up and stroked John's shoulders, keeping his touch light over the scarring on the left side. John's arousal surged again when he felt Sherlock's touch on his bare skin. Sherlock's hands moved down to stroke John's chest. John leaned down to kiss Sherlock again. He pulled Sherlock's shirt up, reluctantly breaking the kiss again so he could get Sherlock's shirt off.
When John opened his eyes, Sherlock was staring up at him, eyes glassy with pleasure and wonder. John kissed him tenderly and reached into his pocket. He pulled out his handkerchief and gently wiped them clean. He dropped the handkerchief to the floor and finally lowered his body, half on top of Sherlock. Sherlock's arms wrapped around him.
John turned to face him. Sherlock was pale with fear. John tried to calm himself. "Yes, they're moving down the dock. I didn't think you could see the dock from there."
Sherlock:

"You'd better start this car and get us out of here, because I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to keep my
John knocked. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. He fussed with the collar of his suit jacket. Sherlock opened the door.
Sherlock was still silent.
John smiled broadly. "I'll tap it with my thumb." He held his left hand up. "I'll tap my thumb against my third finger. Three times. I," tap, "love," tap, "you," tap.
The sun was glowing brightly through the floor-to-ceiling windows when Dr. John Watson welcomed me into the apartment he shares with his husband, Sherlock Holmes. Watson and I sat down for this interview as Holmes roamed restlessly through the apartment, collecting documents and scribbling notes.
"Come on, John, up to bed with you," he said as he pulled John up by the right arm. John stumbled to his feet, swaying a bit. Sherlock locked their arms together at the elbows and led John up out of the cellar. They made their way unsteadily to the house they'd built together at the back of Widow Hudson's vineyard.
. He opened his eyes. "It happened while I was in country. With my commanding officer, Major Sholto. There was something between us from the moment we met, but neither of us had ever acknowledged it. One night I went to Sholto's tent to deliver a message. Before I knew what was happening, we were on his bunk. With our tongues in each other's mouths. And... our hands in each other's pants." John looked up at the ceiling. "That's when the mortar fire began. We jumped up and straightened our clothes. The field hospital was hit hard. I was trying to save a dying colleague when I was hit." Sherlock squeezed John tighter. "I woke up in a different hospital. I never saw Major Sholto again."
how sexy you were in that threadbare army t-shirt. And oh dear God, those indecent little shorts. I had to go home and wank myself half-blind."
"You got it, Doc," said Sam. He and Joe shared a raised-eyebrows look and retreated.
Sherlock looked up at John, his cheeks turning pink. John wanted to know everything about Sherlock, just as much as Sherlock seemed to want to know about John.
Sherlock pulled back, grabbing John's hips and pinning them to the wall when he tried to follow. John whimpered loudly. He glared at Sherlock. Sherlock held John against the wall firmly. He was panting and trembling, clearly aroused almost as helplessly as John was.
As the discussion turned to their recent wedding, Watson retrieved a handsome leather-bound wedding album from its place of honor in the center of their extensive bookshelves. As I paged through it carefully, he told me about the intimate group of close friends and family in attendance at the ceremony.
John lifted his chin a little to look at Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock put his other hand on John's hip to keep him steady. He pushed his mouth down onto John's cock and took in as much as he could. The head pushed past the roof of his mouth and back into the top of his throat. John cried out. Sherlock gagged hard and had to pull off, tears springing to his eyes.
"Perfect, John." Sherlock lowered his voice to a whisper. "You're incredible."
Sherlock didn't look up from the record crate when John walked up next to him. "All right, John?"
"What does what mean?"
Sherlock grabbed John's shirt again. "John, I want you," he pleaded. "Kiss me.
John's voice was quiet. And close. "That's good, darling. Very good."
"You know, I didn't think it would," Watson said when asked if it felt different being married after decades of partnership. “But I was wrong. Being able to tell the world in such a simple yet profound way that I belong to him and he belongs to me has meant more to me than I can possibly express."
John had entered through the kitchen door. He must have been looking for a safe place to set the the food. (He wouldn't find one.) He brought the bag into the sitting room, where Sherlock was still frozen.
When John was sure Sherlock was relaxed, he rolled him onto his back and crawled over him. Sherlock looked up at him with heat and adoration in his eyes. His hands had fallen back onto the pillow on either side of his head.
John nodded slightly, already lost.
. "Thank you, Joe," John managed to croak out. He turned to the other officer. "You, too, Sam. Thank you
After a moment, John pulls away and sits up straighter, grimacing in pain. Sherlock is looking to him for direction.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Then his brow furrowed. "Wait - why are you so good at that? You said you weren't gay!"
Sherlock took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "While I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music. His name was Victor. We were friends. Well. He was my only friend. I don't make friends easily; I never have. And I fell for him. Hard."
John dimly registered the sound of Mrs. Henderson's chart clattering to the floor as he sprinted down the hall. He rounded the corner and made eye contact with Sherlock. He was at the other end of the ER, thrashing against the grip two large police officers had on him.
Sherlock bit his lip and nodded his head, blinking back his tears.
Sherlock chuckled. "Maybe you wouldn't
The second guard's voice was gruff. "There doesn't have to be a point, Anderson. Our job is to look for the little shit, not to think."
When they were finished eating, John helped Sherlock lie down, raising his leg onto the higher part of the makeshift mattress. He put Sherlock's cloak over him. He untied the fur coverlet from his pack and put that over Sherlock as well. He pushed the covers off Sherlock's leg. "The cold air will help with the swelling, my darling."
"Yes." Sherlock looked mildly impressed that John knew the book.
He looked at Sherlock's window for another moment. The wind was picking up. John turned and went back down to the ground floor. He went to his kitchen, picked up the phone and dialed Sherlock's number. Sherlock wasn't answering. John let it ring. Fifteen rings.
"Don't let go," John said quietly. Sherlock gripped the baluster, his mouth falling open slightly. John reached over for Sherlock's left hand and guided it to another baluster.
While they ate, John worked very hard at not thinking about licking the barbecue sauce off of Sherlock's fingers. And his mouth. And... and John was spectacularly unsuccessful. It didn't help that Sherlock seemed to know
John looked down at him and had to stifle a moan. Sherlock was gorgeously debauched. His clothes were pulled halfway off, his cheeks were flushed, and his hair was mussed. His eyes burned into John's. "Please, John."
Stay tuned for another addition to the series next week.
"No. I don't care what people think. And I don't hide, John."
"I'm so sorry, John."
John was lost. He struggled to stay quiet as he came over Sherlock's hand. He gasped for breath and collapsed on the ground next to Sherlock.
"I was remembering that time I went for a run, right after we had first met, before we were together, and I found you there by accident."
When he woke, the morning sun was filtering down through the trees. His pain, while still present, had subsided quite a bit. The swelling was considerably better as well. John was warm, slumbering at Sherlock's side.
"Yes..."
going?"
Sherlock looked down at their joined hands. "It was... an original composition."
“Don’t be absurd. Observation and deduction. Child’s play.”
John was completely unmoored.
John was leaning against the wall when Sherlock came out of the bathroom. "Better, yes?" Sherlock looked down and nodded slightly, his cheeks still hot. John's feet were bare. He must have removed his shoes and socks while Sherlock was in the bathroom. John took his hand again and led him up the stairs to his bedroom.
The orchestra sat back down and began playing. It was loud. And fast. With cymbal crashes and everything. John watched Sherlock for a couple of minutes before peeking at his program. "Festive Overture."
"Yes."
When the last note of Sherlock's last solo faded, the music hall was completely silent for a moment before Lestrade lowered his arms. Then the audience began applauding enthusiastically. Lestrade stepped off his podium, turned to face the audience, and bowed. He faced the orchestra again and began signaling wind players who had performed solos to stand individually. The audience and the rest of the orchestra applauded for each one. Lestrade turned to the young dark-haired cellist and she stood, smiling shyly. Then Lestrade turned to Sherlock, shook his hand, and pulled him up out of his chair. The audience started getting to their feet. John jumped up. Sherlock smiled broadly. One of his curls had freed itself to fall over his forehead. He was stunning. The audience continued applauding while the rest of the orchestra stood.
John turned his back on Sherlock and placed the takeaway bag on his desk. He put his hands on the desk as well and let his head drop down between his arms. Sherlock watched him take a deep breath and let it out slowly. He lifted his head and turned back to look at Sherlock again. "And why do you think dating will lead me away from the work?"
Mycroft, stepping forward:
getting away."
to me! I didn't mean it! I was just angry!" Sherlock looked panicked.
Sherlock, leaning forward and snarling:
John growled into Sherlock's neck and rolled his hips against him again. He moved his hands to Sherlock's hips and under his t-shirt to grasp his waist. Sherlock's skin was warm. John sighed against his collarbone.
Watson and Holmes have faced adversity over the years. In 1998, they were attacked in the parking lot of Watson's clinic. The incident left both men seriously injured. Watson's right knee never fully recovered, and he now walks with a cane. Holmes carries a scar on his temple. Their assailants, who shouted homophobic slurs during the attack, were never caught.
John’s clipped responses were really starting to make him agitated, which caused him moments later to blurt out, “For God’s sake, I’m not going to
“This is my private office line, as you well know Mr Watson,” Magnussen replied. Sherlock could hear the man’s amusement, even over the phone line. He could also hear that his speech was slightly muffled through his broken nose. Bless John.
John laughed in shock. “Not important—? When will the name of whoever is hunting you be important then?”
But John didn’t see him. Or he must not have, as John drove past him with no recognition, and leaving behind only a cloud of dust. Was there anyone in the car’s passenger seat, where he had once sat? He couldn’t tell - it kept changing. Sometimes it was empty, and John was alone. Sometimes he thought he saw the translucent outline of a person - a woman.
“I’ve already seen it all, haven’t I? Listen,” John insisted, “I don’t want you focused on anything else other than—well—this.”
He had wondered why he'd never heard of it, seeing as he read the papers consistently. Perhaps the description had reminded him of the last drowning he had taken an interest in, Carl Powers, which had never brought him any resolution. Perhaps it had just seemed too boring, a cut-and-dried death by accident on a huge estate. Either way, he had likely removed it from his memory, as he was always looking to keep his mind free from clutter.
You see, goats can scale mountainsides. They can walk along almost vertical inclines. This goat lived on the mountain, knew all the best places for salt, and he’d been told about the ram who lived half-way up it. As the goat came toward the ram who lay there injured, the ram couldn’t believe his eyes.
Sherlock turned and reached for him, begging John to escape, but before his very eyes his own hands turned to twine, his arms to thick rope, and Sherlock could do nothing but watch as John received him, and consequently placed his neck into the noose of his hempen embrace.
Why’s that?
John drove with his usual steadiness, cane still tucked in by his leg. They had both decided John’s limp could not appear to have improved before the trial. It was tied to grief in the public’s eyes. If Sherlock thought they had been putting on a show before, he’d had no idea it was only a warm-up – though he could never have predicted needing a warm-up for this.
“Nothing’s been discussed, but if you desire it back on, today is your lucky day. In more ways than one.”
“Oh!” she cried, lowering her broom from overhead. They eyed each other for an extended period before she released a small laugh, and waved towards the only uncovered chair in the place. “Well, you’d better come in then.”
He turned his face away from Watson in response. Would his embarrassment ever end?
“Well, where do I turn next?” Watson asked.
At last she did pull away, and he watched her retreat back into the gaiety of the hall. What did she mean? His marriage with John, the farce though it was…… If he asked John, pleaded with him, would John truly not fire Moriarty? And how would Lady Norton of all people know John’s mind on the subject?
have –
John breathed in deeply in a poor attempt to calm himself, and dipped his chin in closer to his chest. “What are you saying? That you’re going to take the poacher’s ship, and that’s that? We go on our separate ways?”
“Don’t be sorry for me, when you’re the one who - who has to go through this all,” Sherlock finished lamely, also overly aware they were out in plain sight.
The slight twitch of Watson’s lips at this comment was a pale imitation of his earlier languid smiles.
, with much more sternness than he had before.
“John,” he said plainly, “I want to consummate our marriage.”
Vision still hazy, John focused on the nurse at his bedside, who had been checking his chart, and was now standing at his elbow.
“Yes,” he blurted out, voice hoarse, without conscious thought.
him, he’ll fucking kill that man –
“Would you care for a drink Mr Magnussen?” Sherlock offered. “Tea? Or something a bit harder?” He crossed the room to ring the bell for the servants, not waiting for his response.
“So,” John said, “you’re the one who’s been breaking all the bots, I take it.”
Their lips meet before he can finish and the next thing John knows he is kissing Sherlock hard and sloppy, and it’s hotter and messier than he’s ever kissed anyone in his life.
Sherlock felt like his heart would burst. He wanted to give John
Sherlock and John laid in the bed quietly for several minutes. Sherlock's leg was throbbing from his flight to the cellar. He considered John's plan. It was as sound a plan as any. It wouldn't be pleasant for Sherlock to walk ten miles, but he didn't want to stay here waiting for his brother's men to find them. He spoke quietly. "John, I think we should leave at sundown. I'll be slow, but I can walk the ten miles. I can do anything if it means the chance to be with you."
"That's just it, though. I...
He rolled his eyes extravagantly. “Don’t be daft. I said energy, not blood.”
"If you... if you would prefer I leave my shirt on, I understand completely."
John looked away, sighed, and rubbed his hand over his face. After a moment he turned back to Sherlock. "Let's make a signal, my dearest."
" he cried.
"Hey, it's me."
Sherlock panics.
Sherlock leaned toward John as a dirty little grin crossed his face. "Wrong. I didn't let you
Sherlock dropped his head back down against John's neck in relief. "Don't go hunting, John. Stay here with me."
"Good night."
Sherlock opened his eyes but couldn't seem to focus them.
"It's no problem, John. I'll meet with Lestrade tomorrow. I'd like to make amends for accosting you in the street, however unintentional it was." He took a drink of his Coke.
"Now I'm a little worried, but go on."
John shook his head. Remarkable. But he was still livid. "You put yourself in danger over it. You could have just told me not to keep the pork. You didn't need to charge in and start a screaming match."
"I adore you, John."
John took a drink of his iced tea. Sherlock grimaced at him and John snickered. "This is very good." He held the glass out toward Sherlock. "Want to try it?"
. "Okay. You got me." John trembled against the wall, knees weak.
"Good. So have I." Sherlock kept his left arm around John's chest as he pulled the right one back. He raked his fingers upward through John's hair. John let his head fall forward, sighing. He shuddered as Sherlock's mouth slid wetly over the back of his neck.
"No, no," John said, putting his hand out toward Sherlock. "It's all right. It was years ago."
. You are
John clenched his fists. “
"John."
"I love you, too, my angel."
The guards were walking toward the ship. The crew was slowly releasing the ship from the dock. John squeezed his eyes shut for a moment. He opened them again. The guards were still walking toward the ship, but the crew was finishing their work. The gap between the ship and the dock began to widen. John's heart was hammering inside his chest as he watched. The guards kept walking, passing the dock where the ship had been moored. They continued on. John slumped against the rail, trying to concentrate on breathing. As he began to calm, he realized that his hands were cramping from clutching at the rail. He released his grip and stretched his trembling fingers.
"I heard you moan. Before I came in." Sherlock leaned in, lowering his voice again. "Were you touching yourself?"
Sherlock's cheeks were turning pink. "Well..."
"Yes, although there are definitely things I miss about home." He looked pointedly at John's tea.
"You'll have to walk to my friend Mike's farm with me. It won't be easy for you. It's ten miles. But Mike can help us. He raises horses. We can buy two of them and get to the port. We'll get you different clothes, disguise you. It's the only plan I've been able to come up with." He stroked his hand over Sherlock's chest. "What do you think we should do?"
... thinking about something...
John took his boots off and sat down on the bed. He stroked Sherlock's hair gently. "I'm ready, Sherlock. We can leave at sundown."
October, 1977
occasion.”
"I'm all yours if you'll have me."
"You were busy. Medical school, the war..."
." He put his hands out against the wall, suddenly concerned about his ability to stay on his feet. Sherlock ran his hands over John's hips, thighs, and belly. Everywhere except where John
“Just so.” Sherlock looked at John in triumph. “See? You only have to tell him what we want!”
" The knife clattered to the floor. "What is it?"
Sherlock brought his clean hand up and pushed his own hair back from his face. His eyes were closed as he tried to catch his breath. "Love you," he said softly.
Sherlock continued stroking John's hair. John sighed against Sherlock's neck. "What does it mean, Honey?"
John kept Sherlock's watch on his wrist at every possible moment. He only took it off to shower, although sometimes Sherlock took it off of him in bed. John blushed slightly, thinking of the times Sherlock had taken the watch off and pressed his mouth to the inside of John's wrist.
." Startled, Sherlock looked up at John with wide eyes. "I'm helping you because I want to. You're not going anywhere until you've got your strength back. And
Sherlock's heart ached as he watched John. He felt an incredibly strong connection to John, even though they had known each other for such a short time.
Most of the musicians were already on the stage, making their final preparations for the concert. John looked around, but he didn't see Sherlock.
John laughed. "It's because you bring out the best in me, honey."
Sherlock sat up, letting John's dog tags drop back against his chest. "That people will know what, John? That I had sex?"
Sherlock raised his hand and put it over John's. He took John's hand and kissed it. He turned and started walking again.  Sherlock's leg was already throbbing. He worried that he wouldn't be able to make the journey, but he pushed on, cresting the next hill.
John let out a strangled whine.
The combination of the change in sensation and Sherlock's words in his ear threw John over the edge. He thrashed in Sherlock's arms, keening against his own hand as he spilled over Sherlock's hand.
So he surrendered completely, allowing Sherlock to kiss him deeply and thoroughly. Sherlock was unexpectedly generous, lavishing John’s mouth with all manner of kisses. He was overwhelming and unpredictable. A sweet press of his lips against John’s in one moment could be followed by a filthy thrust of his tongue in the next.
"Vest" is American for waistcoat.
"Have you ever... slept with a man?"
John stared down at the top of Sherlock's head incredulously. Sherlock let out a frustrated little noise and put his hand back on top of John's. He pushed at John's fingers, curling them into his hair. John flexed his fingers in Sherlock's hair and seized as much of it as he could. He felt Sherlock gasp. He gave his hand a little twist. Sherlock moaned around John's cock, and John nearly came. John bit down on his own hand, determined to hang on a little longer. He closed his eyes and dropped his head back against the wall with a thud. He groaned into his hand.
He shut the laptop, poured his now-cold tea out in the sink, rinsed his mug, and went out for his daily walk.
"I couldn't. He would have been too easy to track."
Sherlock squeezed lightly as John began to guide his hand up and down. John was lost in pleasure. He started thrusting gently into Sherlock's hand. "I'm - I'm so close, Sherlock!" He dropped his head forward to look at Sherlock. "Are you - are you close, Sweetheart?"
John's heart lurched.
"All right, but you're still staying where you are."
.  He looked at the crew.
As he moved lower, John shifted to kneel beside Sherlock's legs. He licked at Sherlock's stomach, smiling when the muscles twitched under his mouth. He looked up at Sherlock's face.
"Yes, sir!" John grinned again. The two guards rode past the house and over the hill. As soon as they passed from sight, John ran up the hill after them. He slowed as he approached the crest of the hill to avoid making too much noise. He watched the riders until they crested the next hill and went out of sight.
7:20pm
John kissed him gently and reached out to turn off the lamp. He settled back and wrapped his arms around Sherlock.
"No, not at all."
“What I heard was that your years with Victor were among the most meaningful years of your life.”
When John finally had Sherlock's clothes off, he tipped him back onto the bed. His fair skin glowed in the faint light.
They pulled at each other's clothes, giggling as they nearly knocked each other down in their haste. When they had cast their clothes aside, they tumbled into John's bed together.
Sherlock was affronted. "You are no such thing!"
John stirred next to him. He made a quiet little groan. Sherlock watched him stretch slightly and open his eyes. John smiled when he saw Sherlock looking at him. He spoke very softly. "Good morning, beautiful."
"You know I hate repeating myself."
"I will
, John! Just give her a chance. You're my only hope for grandchildren! It's too late for your sister!"
" He looked down at Sherlock and let out an anguished whimper. "What are you doing?" He released Sherlock's hair.
" He squeezed his eyes shut.
Sherlock continued his washing. He stripped off his underclothes and finished up. He opened his pack and dressed in clean underclothes and his nightshirt. He laid back into bed. He looked at John and grinned. "Your turn."
John pushed off the counter. He went to his bedroom, shed his clothes and got into his bed in just his briefs.
Sherlock's hands came up to stroke John's upper arms, before moving to his back. John shuddered at the feel of Sherlock's hands on his bare skin. He pushed his remaining fears aside and reached for Sherlock's vest buttons. When he had the vest open, he went after Sherlock's shirt buttons.
After several minutes had passed, John was no longer capable of words. Sherlock took John in even deeper, stopping his own breath. His fingers dug into John's hips. He pulled back just far enough to gasp for air before plunging back down. John's entire body was shaking hard. He was completely lost in pleasure, his orgasm approaching rapidly. Sherlock rose up to take another quick, shuddering breath and dropped back into place. John pawed at Sherlock's head in an attempt at warning him before gasping deeply as his vision whited out.
John helped Sherlock up onto the wagon seat. He drove them through the village, stopping several times to purchase items and put them in the back of the wagon. At last, he said, "I'd like to buy some salted pork before we leave, but I think that's the last thing." He turned and looked at Sherlock. "What do you think? Have I forgotten anything?"
7:45am
"Not yet. I'll wait for you here."
Sherlock grinned at him. "I don't see why not. You're very sexy."
"I know, my love. I'm sorry, too."
"Give me your hand."
John shuddered. His hands flew up to cover his face. "Oh my God. Are you sure you're ready? It's okay if you're not. We can... do something else if you're not ready."
Sherlock was quiet.
Sherlock looked down at their joined hands. It was a relief to feel John's skin against his again.
John spoke quietly. "We can't use your real name here, darling. If anyone hears it, they could tell the King's men."
. What are we going to do now?"
“You are going to watch. You will not take your eyes off me.” The intensity in his eyes gained a new dimension. “
Sherlock's face flushed a little. He followed John to the couch. Both men took a sip of wine and set their glasses down on the coffee table.
"You don't have to answer that if you don't want to."
Sherlock lowered his hands, wiping at the tears. He looked up at John wonderingly. John was still stroking Sherlock's hair. John's eyes were wet.
Sherlock watched him sit down on the flour sacks. John laid on his side, facing away, and pulled his cloak over himself. He hadn't undressed at all beyond removing his boots. Sherlock could see the tension in his body. He hadn't looked at Sherlock again yet.
"Good." John took Sherlock's left hand and gently pushed the ring onto his finger. Sherlock held his hand out to look at it with a slightly dazed expression. Then a spark of mischief flitted across his face. He slid off the bench and onto his knees.
He looks intently into Sherlock's eyes.
. He put his hands on the back of the chair in front of him.
"Lovely as always. They didn't want to take the gold piece, but I told them you'd have my head if they didn't."
John's POV
"Ah. There you are. I brought green curry. Are you eating tonight?"
, no!" John exclaimed as he crawled back into bed under the sheet and pulled Sherlock against him. "Do you... do you
He gave the poleaxed man a wink and turned to follow Sherlock.
