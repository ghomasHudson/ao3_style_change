At this Clint grinned, taking a sip of his drink before replying, “How could I be? I’m marrying the best guy in the world, I’m chilling at a pool in Mexico, and I’ve had a couple shots of tequila. There’s literally nothing that could faze me right now.” He lifted his empty shot glass as if to prove his point, grinning when a staff member grabbed it on their way by.
Tony gasped out a moan and ripped his head away, panting for breath as he ground down helplessly. Steve let out a low groan, pressing lips and teeth to Tony’s neck in a move that made his knees weaken just slightly. Steve must have felt it because he hefted Tony up just a little, bracing his feet and suspending him in an effortless move that turned Tony’s knees to jelly.
“Hm,” Steve said, continuing the delightful torment with his finger. “And here I was hoping that I could get you to stop thinking for a moment.” With that, the hot line of his cock jutted up against Tony’s thigh, sending any coherent thought scattering as his brain became a livewire of
Tony had never really understood when people got all choked up over some dancing - and in theory it isn’t anything different from the slow dancing they did before - but even he could admit to shedding a few tears as they swayed in the middle of the dance floor.
The excuse wasn’t really needed, considering that Steve had already pecked his way up to Tony’s ear, but he hummed in response, sending a hot trail of desire down Tony’s spine. He felt teeth nibbling lightly at his ear and uttered a soft groan, letting his head fall back on the door.
“Tony,” Steve began, offering the champagne out again, “Would you like to go out sometime? With me?” He turned an absolutely gorgeous shade of pink at the fumble and Tony held back a grin, reaching out with shaking fingers to take the stem.
Clint shot him the dirtiest look as he slid into his seat, panting slightly but not entirely late. Tony did his best to relay his remorse and an “I’ll tell you about it later” all in one glance. It must have worked to some degree because Clint just raised an eyebrow, turning to Bucky and the minister with a doofy grin pasted on his face.
“I don’t have sex with strangers.” Tony blurted out, wishing desperately he could reach out and grab those words once they had escaped from his mouth.
“What I was going to suggest,” He said, nosing into the hair behind Tony’s ear, “Is that I slick you up right here-” A hot hand trailed down between his thighs, caressing with far more intent than he had at the reception. “And I don’t stop until we’re both satisfied.”
”). By Tony’s best estimation that meant that attempting the same with his dick might not be the most excellent plan.
He groaned throatily at the display, using the hand in Steve’s hair to haul him closer for more kisses. Tony could taste himself on Steve, which was probably the hottest thing he had ever experienced in the history of ever. They stood tangled like that for a minute until Tony stopped thinking with his dick long enough to feel Steve’s up against his thigh.
Tony was under no illusion that the reception was really for him and Steve. Natasha and Pepper had co-coordinated the reception and it showed in the open bar and old world elegance of the venue (Tasha’s taste) combined with the sleek table settings and precise flower arrangements (that was all Pepper). Tony knew Steve would much rather have preferred something small and private, if anything at all, and Tony didn’t drink much anymore. The girls (“Women, Tony. They’re women.”) had put in their two cents early on in the planning of the wedding, and at one point Tony, stressed out and likely sleep deprived, said semi-jokingly that they should plan the reception if they felt so much about it. That was that and it was out of his hands from then on.
But that was the past. This was the present, and he was on vacation. He didn’t have to close a business deal with him the next afternoon. The most he had to do tomorrow was get dressed and clap politely.
They stumbled through the door, leaving him giggling in a way that Tony would absolutely feel embarrassed about when he was sober. Steve locked the door behind them, then turned Tony right around into it, slipping a broad hand into his hair and swallowing Tony’s breathy moans when he grasped at it gently.
So, when all of their things were safely indoors, the heater was turned on, and a fire was started in the living room; it only made sense that Steve would scoop Tony up, march them straight up the stairs into the bedroom, and drop him heavily onto the plush mattress.
He really did have tipsy pool-bathroom sex with a stranger last night. And the bitch of it all was that he enjoyed himself. A lot. To the point where thinking about it for too long was enough to get him going again and he really didn’t have time for that, considering that he had a pre-wedding brunch to make before jamming himself into the monkey suit for the ceremony.
after a playful argument, but the whole phrase - was the day they got married, right after Tony stepped up to share a disappointingly chaste kiss with his new husband.
It was like smacking lips-first into a brick wall.
In fact, the first time Tony could really remember hearing the full phrase - not a mumbled
“Oh, nothing,” Tony began, idly stroking the muscles of Steve’s back, feeling the knobs of his spine. “I’m going to fucking kill Loki the next time we see that little bastard.”
“Oh, nothing much. Just a little experimentation.”
It was a little bit like the mother of the Bride taking over, Tony mused, slumped halfway out of his chair and into Steve’s. He shivered as one of Steve’s big hands came down near his inner thigh, caressing at the seam of his trousers in a way that Tony knew was self-soothing. Dinner had come and gone around an hour ago, with their first dance preceding just before.
The tall stranger was a fascinating study in contradictions, that was absolutely certain. He towered over the other patrons, even halfway seated on a submerged barstool, but he held himself like a much smaller man. Tony could hear the deep base of his voice from across the bar, but as far as volume went he was far more quiet than the tipsy vacationers that surrounded him.
Tony heard Bucky grunt from the next chair over. Clint let out a yelp, and then turned around. Tony heard more than saw the ensuing shoving match, and cleared out before it inevitably evolved into a makeout session that was just as interesting as it was disgusting on multiple levels.
His head fell back onto the door, and his chest rose in uneven pants as he met Steve’s eyes. They shone with an absolutely wicked gleam as Steve carefully brought his hand up to his mouth, licking it clean in precise little laps. Without ever breaking eye contact.
Tony woke up gradually, only really being awake when he fully opened his eyes. He had a vague, warm awareness of his limbs, but everything seemed so very unimportant when put against the fact that he was probably the most comfortable he had been in a while.
Steve paused, looking puzzled, then morose. “Ah,” He began, and Tony knew he needed to stop him right there before this got more out of hand.
Ok, maybe he was a bit stressed. That didn’t mean that he didn’t know how to relax; that was just baseless slander.
Tony set to work, bobbing his head back and forth along Steve’s cock. It really was a thing of beauty - long and hard and a perfect weight in his throat. At some point Tony looked up when Steve’s hand slid into his hair to see Steve propped up with one hand against the door. Tony stiffened for a brief moment, almost expecting the firm hand at the back of his head to guide his pace. Instead, all Steve did was pet gently at his curls, scratching lightly at his scalp and murmuring praise while Tony started again.
They separated in fits and starts, with several attempts at straightening out their hair ruined when Tony pulled Steve into another kiss, or Steve took a fistful of hair to leave open-mouthed kisses on Tony’s neck. Eventually they got themselves together, but were definitely fooling no-one with the loose grins plastered on their faces.
” right before disappearing with a flash of green light and a gust of wind. It’d be just like him to leave such a charitable wedding gift as a no-nookie curse.
It’s not like anyone noticed, with Steve ugly-crying right there in Tony’s arms. Tony didn’t mind one bit, even if it did make his handsome husband look like a tomato.
Tony felt his mouth water as he started squirming a bit, both silently asking to be let down and desperately trying to feel more of his hot length against him. Steve grunted, but got the hint and set him down. He let out a murmur of dazed surprise when Tony slid straight to his knees, sliding the waistband of his trunks down as gently as he could. His cock sprung free, fully erect and curved slightly to the left. Tony followed the line of it with his eyes, licking his lips in bare anticipation.
“D-Don’t leave any marks,” Tony gasped out, gasping a hoarse moan when Steve gave an inquisitive noise against his neck. “I’ve gotta wear a suit tomorrow, or I’d absolutely let you go wild.”
Tony really wanted to be shocked, but with the kind of lives they lead something like this was actually pretty tame. He even had a bit of an idea what the cause could be - they had run in to Loki earlier that morning where the trickster had intoned “
His hair was combed into a neat arrangement on top of his head. Tony longed to mess it up, just a little.
“Ok, nope, can’t do that then.”
He had slept all through the night, like a fucking baby, and woken up feeling sleepy and good and like he could fall back asleep and do it all again. He knew he shouldn’t do that, somewhere in the back of his mind, but that didn’t stop him from being tempted.
“Close-” He choked out, jerking a little when all Steve did was pick up the pace. Before Tony knew it he was cumming into Steve’s hand, gasping out his name and a tangled string of explicatives.
After a few moments Steve turned to him, coasting a hot hand over the quivering planes of his stomach, his ring catching the low light of the bedroom. “Wassamatter you?” He slurred, nosing sleepily into Tony’s hair.
Steve must have felt something from that because Tony could feel him grin against his hair, and brought his hand back around Tony’s chest. This time the pressure was much more firm, he’d thumb over it a few times and then pinch at it lightly, firm enough to keep him interested but too slow to really speed anything up. The hot slide of his thigh between Tony’s legs offered a delicious counterpoint, and Tony found himself grasping weakly at Steve’s arms just to have something to hold on to.
Once they both got over their shock, and the wedded couple shared a kiss that was a little too heavy for their audience, there was a small “reception,” which was really just everyone who had been able to make it mingling together for cake and cocktails.
into the pillows after sex, or a sarcastic
Tony was hiding next to the cake table when he felt a presence by his side, a glass of champagne appearing in his line of sight not long after. He turned and looked up (and up, and up, and up) to see Steve, looking sheepish and small in all his finery. Tony felt his stomach drop as musings on contradictions filled his head once again.
Tony felt a shiver run down his spine, his head rolling back on the pillows with a hoarse moan. He nodded furiously, spreading his legs just a little more and earning himself another rich, vibrating laugh and a hot puff of air at his neck. There was a waft of cold air as Steve reached for the lube on the bedside table, the faint smell of artificial cherries filling the air. His dick twitched with what was practically a pavlovian response to the scent.
He was asleep before his head even hit the pillow.
Tony was all at once too tipsy and not drunk enough for this.
“Honey,” Steve began, looking askance up at Tony. The kicked puppy look was kind of ruined when he was laid out ass-naked on Tony’s bed, but he appreciated the visual all the same.
Tony huffed, wiggling a little on his pool chair. “Just because I’m stressed about this going right doesn’t mean that I’m not enjoying myself.” Which was absolutely true. He was enjoying his stay at the resort very much, he just wanted the wedding to go as planned. Even though he wasn’t the wedding planner, or the best man, or anywhere remotely involved with anything other than celebrating.
Now, Tony really didn’t care all that much about the man’s friends, or the other marriage that was apparently happening at the resort that week. What Tony really cared about, at that point, was what the fine gentleman’s name was, and if he was willing to follow Tony into the cramped pool bathroom to play a little beat the clock with him.
It’s not their fault. They don’t even realize anything is wrong. He’s just being ridiculous, pathetic. He’s an attention-whore, right? That’s what anyone would say. They’d roll their eyes and tell him to get over it.
There are less people here, only a handful stretched along the dim hallway. As he walks away from the grand doors, the, frankly sometimes, overwhelming music begins to fade away. It’s soon replaced though by something different, softer, yet grander still for all of that.
“I’ll see you around, Mr. Stark,” Steve said, mocking him with a salute before he took the case and sauntered out.
“That is definitely not a comforting thought, and the mutated genetics are still unidentified,” Tony spoke at his normal level, knowing Jarvis could hear him without problem, “which means we’re working with a super, where before I’d assumed it was just some beefed up lackey. Any leads at all from the dirt?”
More prepared this time, Tony pressed it into Steve instead of trying to take out a kidney, and then Steve was wrapping his arm around Tony’s hips and hauling him up on his cock. Tony’s shoulders dug into the brick wall now, but he looked far beyond caring, fucking himself onto Steve’s cock much like he had in his last attempt at distraction.
Tony looks at him, fingers curling around the steel rod and feeling it just like any one of his other tools. Except it’s not. It’s so far from not that Tony’s cock twitches in his boxers. “Yeah, okay. I got you, baby,” he promises. He grabs the lube and squirts a generous amount, as directed, onto the planes of Steve’s stomach. Steve doesn’t twitch, already practicing keeping still.
General Carter raised her brow. “You don’t know? You just happened to, what, fall into a fight that had already started in a closed room?”
“It was a pleasure meeting you in person finally. I look forward to seeing you again, Captain America.”
Steve’s eyes closed and he sighed, but he didn’t let Tony go. When he looked back at Tony, he tilted his head to the side and asked, in all seriousness: “Do you trust me, Tony?”
What was unknown to her was the angry scuffle taking place not two meters out. From where Stephanie stood, she couldn’t make the figures from the shadows, but it was obvious there was fight starting.
"Steve!" Tony shouts and bones grind together as Steve holds him tighter.
Steve’s heart stops, and he can’t hear anything else but Pepper and the suit crumpling. Just like that, Tony’s entire world is gone. Later, Steve will wonder if Tony realizes the significance of what’s happened. He will wonder if Tony ever let himself mourn their passing. He reaches for Pepper’s body as it falls, but before he catches her, Bucky’s metal fist connects with his temple and the world goes dark.
“Okay, it’s not just vodka. She called it ‘Samohonka’. Apparently her father made it. He’s in Ukraine. She just got it the other day.”
Anonymous (rose-on-the-mountain) asked: Historical, 'You need a doctor?', Steve/Tony! :D
“... Fuck…” Steve rubbed a hand over his face.
The next day, he finds himself against a rocky outcropping, picking at strips of green fabric and wondering why his mouth refuses to make an ‘N’ when he should be more concerned about how high the snow goes. He thinks this is the longest it’s taken him to get through the alphabet, wonders if he’ll be able to form the letter ‘S’ when the snow takes him that far, wonders why he cares.
"Tony."
The room was dark, the hands were smooth, the mouth familiar. The music from the party was loud, thumping against the door and the walls, through Tony’s body, pulsing with his heartbeat. It was frantic. His mind was not.
“I’m fine,” the man mutters, words a little breathy, but growled out in a language Steve recognizes after a moment.
'Stop' he pleads. 'Stop giving them clues.'
The thought was fleeting, gone before Tony was really aware of thinking it, and he followed it to the muffled sound of a low rumble that vibrated Tony’s arm down into sleep.
Tony swore, low and vicious, and banked sharply to the right as a structural warning for the Holland Tunnel blared across the HUD. It brought him into the middle of the attack as he slammed down to the ground in the mouth of the tunnel and immediately destroyed two of the closest bots with a repulsor blast. In the next moment, his panels were opening to dispense his projectiles. Their ion trails glowed blue in the flickering lights of the tunnel as they pressed all along the collapsing concrete ceiling. Blue webbing spread out between them, their humming pitching higher as they all connected and drove upward as one to support the tunnel’s shape.
"Stark!" Steve yelled and Tony knew he was close, but the case was falling apart as the armor burst out of it, called by the seemingly harmless bracelet they'd given back to him. The end of the airstrip was coming up fast and Tony was starting to feel the exhilaration of the chase. He wasn't going to make it. Steve was going to catch up. He could feel him shouting from just behind, and he twisted around briefly to shove his palm out. A pulse of energy waved out from his bracelet, and Steve just barely ducked behind a pallet of crates before the pulse rocked everything around him.
His mother had gone on trip to Aspen for one of her fundraising benefits, so when the maid had found Maria’s prescription bottle in Tony’s room, she’d gone to Howard.
.”) and rimming (“
“Oh-!” Steve’s baffled face stopped centimeters from Tony’s, the muscles in his neck flexing as he strained against… something.
Steve flung his arm over his eyes, groaning in frustration. Tony wiped his lube-slick fingers on his thigh with a grimace, feeling his cock twitch at the wanton image Steve made.
Tony sipped at his drink as they chatted, feeling himself become easy and loose as the alcohol did it’s job. Steve, as he turned out to be, was also loosening up. After another colorful drink he slung his arm over Tony’s shoulder, leaving goosebumps to rise over his arms at the wonderfully warm pressure.
For such a big guy Steve was awful quiet, though as to how much of that was intentional Tony wasn’t sure. He went heavy on the praise - something that always made Tony’s spine feel like a livewire - and only paused when he came. He tried, bless his heart, to pull out before, but Tony just grabbed his hips and held him there, brought his hand up to press his thumb to his perineum and rolled against it. That's all it took to have Steve spilling into his mouth, going silent when he bit into the meat of his hand to keep quiet.
“No, but thanks. I, um, didn’t know exactly what to get, so Coulson told me about this place a few blocks past the National History Museum. I hope that’s alright.” Rogers looked like any negative response might make him sink into the floor, so Tony huffed out a smile.
“Oh, that’s… I probably have a spare in the car,” Tony hedged, hooking a thumb back towards the elevator. He laughed slightly, “I’ve always got that crap lying around, you know.”
Later that night, after dinner, the house was quiet and Steve and Tony were alone. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck again, hindering Steve from removing his shirt completely.
“Shall I begin to compile a list of pet names for Captain Rogers, as well?” Jarvis asked, and at Tony’s grunt of negation, continued, “Consistency with the tampering notwithstanding, Helicarrier Beta would have stayed up approximately one point four hours after the final malfunction in the turbine caused an overload in its other engines.”
“It's okay, Master Anthony,” he heard Melissa whisper. Or maybe she spoke normally, but his consciousness slipped from him as he felt cool fingers at his brow. “It’ll be over soon.”
It was dangerous.
“Crossbones has caught up, sir,” Jarvis said helpfully.
Pepper makes a low noise of approval, and Jarvis does as he's told, as his creator wants...as he wants.
“I know, baby,” Steve murmured, smirking. He massaged Tony’s perineum, the beginning curves of his ass cheeks, teased and stroked. He breathed in deeply, let it out on a growling groan. “You’re so flushed… Straining up and so wet for me.”
Tony’s quite proud of his boys, to be honest. They’re shaking, sweaty messes, but they’re quiet and behaved. He and Pepper are relaxed on the center couch, signing stack after stack of paperwork that Tony had let go unnoticed. They have an almost empty bottle of wine in front of them, and their glasses are half full. The television is a peaceful background documentary of the mating habits of the dung beetle.
“Daruĭte!” he called down to the bartender. When she looked over, he held up his empty glass. “Dva? Bud’ laska.”
“Huh,” Fury said thoughtfully, and Candace appeared to deliver their food. She dropped off extra napkins, topped off Tony’s soda and left. “Is that what you young people call it these days?”
doing is being acerbic and bratty,” Victor replied, setting his glass down on the bartop, “and clearly, you have no head for this tonight. Perhaps after you rest, we may speak more of this over breakfast.”
The man, Steve, was beginning to look nervous. Right. Date. Motion. Tony stepped forward, finally taking off his hat and the glasses. His smile was wide, wider than it should’ve been. It probably looked fake.
By the time he’s finished and he’s dressed again, Pepper is still pacing. She stops as he comes out of the bathroom and arches a brow at him.
“You heard the authorities, Iron Man. Stand down and surrender quietly,” the Captain called across the distance where he stood between Iron Man and the police.
,” he said. “What is that?”
His coding trips and tangles when Tony shifts sharply, causing Pepper to cry out in pleasure, and purposely moves one of the suit's hands between Pepper's legs.
Steve wanted to laugh, incredulous with Iron Man’s audacity to claim frustration. The smooth, metal plug shifted inside of his ass as another wave of stimulation sent Steve shaking once more. He panted through his nose when it finished and felt more sweat bead up and slip back into his hair. He couldn’t care about that, though, as he was hyper-focused on the much smaller, thinner rod that was currently invading his dick.
…/something/. Something is missing in this deserted and icy wasteland. He thinks it might be a name, but whose? He doesn’t know, but that doesn’t stop his tongue from curling, his lips protesting as they numbly try to form the shape of…
The phone in Steve's pocket has been quiet for the four months it's been there.
“Make fun of my boyfriend for being a huge sap?” he whispered. “For being so ridiculously in love with me that he wants to actually go in a tandem love boat regardless of his image? Never.”
“Would you like your updates, sir, or would you prefer to concentrate on the road?” Jarvis asked as the windshield HUD flickered on.
He bit down then let Clint force his hands around the bow. He attempted to snicker and offered up another muffled, “That’s what she said,” at the same time as Clint fit his own hands around Tony’s calf and knee and popped the bone back into place. He valiantly tried not to scream, but he did black out again for at least a few seconds.
Steve woke up on the cold concrete of a warehouse floor. He kept his eyes closed, taking in the bruised, hot feeling of his skin and the way it felt stretched too tightly over his bones. The weight of a metal muzzle framed his jaw and kept his head pinned to magnet in the floor.
It left Tony bristling in indignation. “Siri is an assault on humanity, Steven Rogers! I swear to God you better drown that crappy tech!”
“Is that why you’re running? Because you think he’s America’s Hitler?”
“You’re going to go surprise a group of children who want to be scientists when they grow up with full-fledged AI-operating robotic mechanics,” Steve breathed like the very idea of it was the Eighth Wonder of the World.
Tony ignored the call, feeling his gauntlets humming with power. He’d protect himself. He wouldn’t let them hurt him anymore.
He wined and dined Natasha, who watched him with a faint smile (the expression practically screamed approval) and sipped her whiskey. He flirted with subtly with Bucky, which only seemed to amuse Natasha more, and made something ache in Steve’s chest.
"Go back to sleep, Tony," Steve says again, tone soft but not pleading. There is no shame or worry in it, only warning. "You’re safe here."
“I’ll get it,” he says.
“-turbines one and two were performing normally, but turbine three kept sputtering. No one believed that I could tell the difference, but Fury said to pull it and bring you in. So, we brought the carrier down, and after a hell of lot of noise, there’s now the biggest engine I’ve ever seen in my life in the working bay. ”
“They’re hitting the expressway?”
Steadily, Steve’s dripping blood counts down the end of the day; the end of another one in a month of nightmares.
“Ah, you learn quickly. That’s good. You are Stephanie Titanborn. I am Natasha Stark. I don’t allow many to call me Natasha, but I’ve been waiting to meet you for a long time. I think, I shall let you.”
“I tried calling,” Tony heard himself say, very aware that Steve was still quiet, still in the doorway. He’d dressed in loose sweats and a shirt dark enough to hide any evidence of injuries, but Tony had already seen them. “SHIELD said you’d come home, so I was worried when you didn’t answer. Is-”
“He is on the helipad, Captain Rogers. Sir is with him.”
It came to him then, sudden and staggering. The sorcerer that had mind fucked him the day before, the green light that had pushed the blue of his own wider and stronger than it should’ve been.
“Wait, hold the- Oh, thank god, I’m so running late and taking the stairs was so out of the question,” a woman is saying and a man, who’d slipped on with her, mumbles a courtesy reply. Tony wonders if he’s as wide-eyed as Pepper. He doesn’t remember the last time they were this close together.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony muttered, ducking his head back to his notes in front of him.
Not to say he wanted to eat it, but the point still stood.
“C-Code Tammy!” he nearly shouts, stuttering it at Pepper like a lifeline. His cock is so goddamn hard, he doesn’t think he’s going to be able to ever stand up. He doesn’t think he could jerk off on the table three times and actually lose his erection. He’s so fucking hard, is what he means.
Blackout screens concealed identities, but their equipment and their pristine states denoted them easily as Government, capital ‘G’. Pierce’s men had finally been sent to take Stark from SHIELD. Clint had always bet that Stark wasn’t so crazy after all. He wondered where Captain America had gotten to, but he didn’t have time to care about that. He wasn’t part of the plan, not really. He adjusted the mask’s goggles and yawned.
“I didn’t- I tried-” both of which Tony meant to start his response with, but what came out was:
“Piss off,” Tony scowled, shaking out his hands and going back to work on one of the Doombots.
Steve freezes, expression abject horror, and Tony turns back around to watch Natasha's body slump to the floor. They both watch Bucky step back once, then once more.
“Yes, exact number undetermined. Survivors appear to be barricading themselves inside the Newport Center and emergency services cannot break the line to retrieve them. There are multiple officers down.”
“Look at you,” Tony says. “You’re so fucking gone on it. You wanna do this again already, don’t you, and we’re not even finished yet. I can feel it inside you, sliding and fucking you. Is it good? Does it feel like when I’m fucking you, baby? When I’m sliding my dick inside you and dragging it slowly out?”
“With all due respect, General,” Stephanie began, hesitated, then continued. “My past is just that. I’d like to keep it that way. I’m here because I believe I can do some good, and if I have to deal with a few bumps along the way…” She shrugged.
?” Maria asked gently, stroking soft fingers gently across his brow and temple.
“You know by now that I don’t really keep a schedule, but right now, you’re at the top of the list, Cap,” Tony replied, “Though, right below the Marian Koshland Science Museum today. There’s a group of prospective engineers visiting, and I wanted to surprise them with Dum-E and U. I figured the robots would get a kick out of it. They love playing with children. So I ca-”
“I really hate you sometimes,” Tony muttered, rolling his eyes as Victor’s laughter tumbled around his speakers.
Silence followed Tony’s pronouncement, and Tony slowly lowered his hand with a vicious curse. He angled himself to look back at Victor while leaving an easy twist point to his armor.
Tony doesn’t flinch, but his face is covered in Pepper’s blood as the bullet tears through her and cuts across his cheek before it disappears into the night.
He doesn’t know where those words had come from, but they’d earned him a bruising backhand and a ban from Howard’s lab for a week for sassing. He’d cried into his mother’s dressing gown as she’d returned him to his bed.
“You designed something, didn’t you? Some new… anesthetic that knocked me out? That’s why I can’t remember anything, isn’t it?”
Then, he was staring at his hands pressed to the ground, but it wasn’t the ground, and they were his hands, but not. Not as they should be. He stared as the image of his gauntleted hands overlayed his younger hands. His stomach twisted up in knots and sweat dripped slowly down his back as his fingers slipped into vomit and blood.
Tony blinks at him, mind shooting off in a thousand different directions until he connects the dots with the expression on Steve’s face. The careful determination coupling with the blush and, ah. Tony covers Steve’s hand and squeezes it.
The rapport of the gunshot filled Tony’s ears before the impact of the bullet threw Steve and Tony forward.
Tony bites his lip and thrusts against the man's grip. There's only a little resistance as the man chuckles, low and knowing.
"Jarvis!" Tony shouted, running flat out along the strip. There was a brief moment where nothing happened before the agent in the jet cursed and Tony's case was shooting out of the jet.
Steve’s mouth is insistent against Tony’s as he’s backed against the table he’d been sitting at. He admits that his brain melts just a little, so it takes him a few seconds to get in gear and respond. But just as he’s about to go romcom and slide his arms around Steve, the blond pulls back with a lick of his lips.
“Tony’s case is here somewhere,” he said, rubbing at his knuckles.
“Put your hand on me one more time, and I’ll cut it off and feed you your fingers,
“Tony, please,” Rhodey says, dragging tired arms up to his helmet and ripping the faceplate off. He looks at Tony’s impassive, iron face and tries to pour all of his emotions for the man before him into his expression, his voice. “Please, at least let me see you.”
The feed cut back to the studio reporters and Sam laughed. There was a note of incredulity in the sound.
“You’ve been doing so well,” Ty continued, fingers mapping Tony’s skin under his shirt. “I’ve been so proud of you. And then you started fucking the teacher, blasting it all over the papers. He’s not really your type, is he? Were you trying to get over me? Did you go Ken-doll to get back at me?”
Because that’s what Steve still believes. He has to. This shell before him can’t truly be the genius and hero, Tony Stark. This can’t be the man Steve had come to… He doesn’t let the word form. He can’t confirm what Tony already knows about him. He just meets that empty gaze with his own, and the words come on their own, dredged up in defense and morbid curiosity.
Stephanie bit the inside of her cheek, fingers flexing for a moment before she nodded and fell into step beside the elf.
“I’m not a fan of people touching what’s mine,” Ty said on a low growl. “And once upon a time, that meant you.”
"You're not cleared to be out here, Stark," and that wasn't Steve -it hadn't been since Tony had woken up- it was clearly Captain America ordering him back inside the base.
He isn’t aware of the details of Tony’s plan yet, but he knows that this will get messy. In his other hand, he carries a duffel bag with contents specific to a list he’d been given. Metals, tools, drugs. The drugs are strong enough to knock him out. Tony had been very clear about that requirement.
It's four months after, and Tony starts receiving post cards of all things.
“Why do you think I’m asking for help?” Iron Man said, modular tone leaning towards frustrated. “I’m an asshole, yeah, but I know when I can’t handle something on my own. And this, this I can’t handle anymore.”
It's been awhile, but Tony knows his body. He'll need prep, but it shouldn't take long. He eagerly twitches his hips down against Steve's hands.
He reiterated: he should’ve known better.
“That’s really not necessary,” Steve murmured, and Tony paused halfway into the hallway.
Tony swallows again, feeling the slight tightening of Steve’s hand. He can’t look away from the shield.
Dinner, as it also turned out, was nice.
He's surprised that HE doesn't immediately throw them away.
Tony absolutely didn’t flinch at the bluntness of Steve’s words. His tongue was sharp as he spit his own venom. “That day in the kitchen, you’re right, you asked me if I trusted you, and I said yes. That was the truth then. I did, and fuck, it was so true. It was
“How do you ever get any work done, Stark?” Ty smirked as Tony kissed him in answer. His hands slid inside Tony’s tight jeans, sliding them over slim hips as Tony knelt up. They both laughed as the chair rocked off balance, but then Ty’s hands were on bare skin and Tony was on fire.
“Wow,” Tony muttered to himself, waiting until Rogers was in the elevator to actually utter anything. “If only anyone I was interested in was that easy. Alright, J, let’s get this baby pulled apart. Where’s the crane?”
There’s resistance, but Tony is patient and steady and doesn’t try to shove past. Steve throws his head back, but it’s the only movement he allows himself. His mouth parts, a whine easing up from his throat. His flush is darker and Tony is enthralled. The sound slides further inside and Tony can feel it moving through the shaft of Steve’s cock. He stops just before his fingers would hit the head and takes a breath.
“So, what if Fury’s right, Stark knows he’s made, and we’re all just playing the long game?” Sam finished, more statement despite his questioning end.
“Shut up, Jerry.” Tony rolled his eyes. “Always contradicting me.”
Pepper is panting, twisting against Jarvis with each expert roll of Tony's hips, and she growls a little 'Oh god, yes' when Jarvis finally moves two of those fingers against her.
Steve rips his mouth away, turning his head to watch from the corner of his eye as he pulls Tony's hand free. The plug drops over the side of the bed in the next few seconds, and Tony's cock gives a hard throb in anticipation.
“Doctor Doom was alerted sixty-four minutes ago. He has since initiated airspace lockdown and has sent exactly three messages in the order of merely informing you of the incident, requesting your presence, and, finally, demanding your presence no later than your first opportunity. As you were with Captain Rogers in SHIELD, the messages were banked.”
Tony rolled his eyes, hooking his cane on the booth back. He unrolled his silverware and wiped the napkin across the table before crossing his arms. Fury looked amused. Well, as amused as he could look when he wasn’t a smiler. He opened his mouth to say something snarky, but a shadow fell over the table as a peppy server bounced up to the raised section of the booths and greeted them.
Fury was watching him again, with a smirk that said he knew what Tony wanted to order. “-diet.”
A few months later, Steve stirred sleepily on his stomach. Something tickled at his skin, and he murmured wordlessly without opening his eyes.
“Yes,” replied Tony, “It was the twentieth anniversary this past December. The city threw them a huge celebration on my dime. I don’t doubt for a minute that Pierce didn’t stay long. It’s hard to stomach when you know the truth, and the people don’t. They celebrate brilliance and forward thinking, and they mourn senseless death at the hands of alcohol. They shake their heads and whisper behind their hands about how ‘it’s such a shame he got himself and his wife killed drunk driving.
All three men are staring at Tony, but the one in question finally shakes himself out of it and glances at his left arm.
“You brought me into this without asking, so I’m not asking. You’ll strip and do as Tony says then meet in the living room. Do we understand each other.”
“Take the suit.”
Warmth, unbidden, flooded through Tony at Steve’s exclamation of delight. Always the same, day after day they met, always pleased and still just a little surprised, and always sweeping forward to offer his hand to Tony. They didn’t shake anymore, though, because Steve had taken to just holding Tony’s hand for a moment or two longer than Tony should have liked, but found he didn’t really mind.
“God, you’re a real comfort, Wilson, you know that?” Steve rolled his eyes and slapped down a wad of Russian currency. “Daruĭte, vsya plyashka. Budʹ laska.”
Steve looked tired; the lines around his eyes were noticeable in the dim lights of Tony’s bedroom. He had a few bruises himself that were healing around his jaw and the bridge of his nose. His breathing seemed okay, though, which made Tony relax a little more. He reached for him, fingertips just barely contacting the denim crease at Steve’s bent knee. Steve smiled easily, shifting the balance of the notepad to take Tony’s hand in his own. He laced their fingers together and Tony was aware of how clammy his own felt.
It took until well into the evening for Tony to outfly his anger at Crossbones getting away, at the imposter for being able to scare him, and… Well, for the fact that he’d intentionally fought against Steve, regardless that Steve didn’t know. He’d watched the news on his flight back from where he’d lost Crossbones past Bermuda and hadn’t missed the careful way Steve had held himself while directing cleanup. He certainly hadn’t missed the darkened spread of blood beneath the Captain America uniform, nor the tight expression around Steve’s eyes even beneath the cowl.
“Tastes like it too. One drink will probably put you on your ass,” Steve said easily, shelling another peanut. He knew Sam would read it as a challenge.
Crossbones walked easily with him towards the smoking remains of his car, and with a laugh, mused aloud; “I’m really not interested in anything you have to say.” He tossed Tony down and kicked him into the car, “So why don’t you just be a good boy and bring Daddy your armor.”
Once the meeting had finally ended, he’d made a run -fast walk- to his office on that floor (he has one on every floor just in case - sue him) and shut the door behind him. Frantically, he’d leaned against his back to the door to get his hand into his pants, but the vibrations stopped immediately.
“You want to know why, Tony? Because you’re soft!”
Ronin shrugged. “The masses are just dumb, blinded by Pierce’s accomplishments. It’s pretty obvious once you look at the big picture, plus I’ve seen what Hydra’s done.”
“Sometimes they want to do tests,” Steve said with a shrug, “Which, yeah, I can see why, but when they want to make the injuries worse just to s-”
Steve’s head shot up, eyes wide. The chair he was sitting in clattered backwards as he rushed to his feet. “Tony! You’re awake!”
Gallinius scoffed loudly. “A beast like you isn’t smart enough. Walking around here like you’re better than the rest of us!”
Pepper's hair is coming loose from the tight bun she'd had it in, and Jarvis' hands are pressed against her stomach and hip, helping her remain upright as Tony watches from between her legs.
“Excuse me, sir,” Steve calls out as he nears. The decorative cane in his hand clinks on the stone path before passes it over his shoulder to his valet and crouches, wanting to help the man up. “Sir, you need a doctor?”
It took far too long for him to get his phone to light up, and even longer to find Victor’s number. It didn’t strike him as strange at the time that the digits looked wrong, but before the phone even finished connecting the call, he closed his eyes. The phone clattered to the ground beside him and he sunk into unconsciousness.
“Good afternoon, sir,” Jarvis greeted Tony.
“If you don’t give a damn about hurting me, then at least think of the innocent kids that get caught in your crossfire.”
“I’ll, um, just-” For some reason, he thought of Steve and he felt a fist around his heart, “I’ll just have a Ceasar Salad.”
Steve was quiet for a moment, gaze tracking the black lines curve over Tony’s skin up towards the music notes he knew where Tony’s neck, had memorized their shapes and placements with fingertips and tongue.
“Yeah, well some of us don’t like killing children,” Tony said, tone casual, dismissive, but his gaze was sharper than any word he would give when Victor looked back up at him.
“Do you think that’s true?” Scarlet Witch asked, one leg swinging absently. “What a time to be in where the good guys are the bad and vice versa. Very exciting.”
Steve stayed with Tony until his driver showed up and, this time, he held Tony’s hand.
“I think I can sweep you off your feet until you let me.” Steve smiled brightly.
Just like his parents.
Steve laughed and pushed to his feet, slinking into Tony’s space heedless of the other people wandering about the block-wide garage sale. Tony’s breath hitched as Steve nuzzled in against his cheek.
“Tony, don’t you dare!” she hisses again, mortified.
“Isn’t that interesting,” Loki purred, but Thor stepped between them, hands up towards Steve.
“I’ve got everything I need, so I should be fine,” Tony replied, amused, “Run along and… save the world, I guess.”
Tony scribbled note after note along Steve’s spine, words and bars taking up the broad expanse of his muscles. He worked on it for another hour until the words finally stopped scrolling behind his eyes. He capped and tossed the marker and sank back against Steve’s side, sighing in satisfaction. He kissed Steve’s shoulder, lips going slack as he fell asleep.
“If this is the long game, then I need to decide if how I feel about him is worth more than what he’s done,” Steve finally answered, quiet but firm.
Rogers cleared his throat again, looked like he was almost about to salute, but thought better of it, then turned and left.
“You leave me in here, and I won’t make it to a prison cell. Pierce won’t risk leaving me alive,” Tony said flatly, choosing to split his attention between Steve’s rising frustration and feeling out the bandages around his head. He saw Steve’s gaze dart to his hands, and there was a moment where Tony thought Steve might reach out to pull his hands away, but he didn’t.
“And how many people are going to die before you get your way?” Steve asked tightly.
“I’ll see you in Hell,” Tony promised thickly.
But the Captain’s grip had crushed part of the flight mechanics in the suit’s left leg, sending Tony off course enough that he had to resort to firing at Crossbones from a distance.
“Are you quoting
“It smells like paint stripper.”
“Iron Man!”
“Because I’ve given you everything you could ever need and you spit in my face. All you had to do was stay out of trouble for one weekend. One! One of the biggest goddamn deals of the new age, and you nearly fuck it up by-”
He was cut off as Steve swooped in to grip him by the bicep, unintentionally shaking him and spilling the coffee between them.
“It was just a dream. It was just a very realistic dream.”
“Do you see what I see?” Tony asked, shaking a finger slowly at the film.
“Great, I’ll put these in. Let me know if you need anything else.”
Tony signed the bill that had been left with their meal and stood. He felt the table shake slightly, most likely from Steve shoving his foot back into his shoe. He met Pierce’s gaze again.
Tony startled when a thumb brushed over his nipple, shivers starting a delicate tremble in his muscles as Steve hummed quietly in question. “I’m alright,” Tony said on a sigh, “just thinking.”
Tony forwent a goodbye, leaving Steve with only a stern “Stop looking like you just got laid,” before moseying his way down the hallways towards his room. The deep baritone laugh that followed him kept him warm until he crawled into bed, feeling satisfied in the most bone-deep way.
When Tony managed nothing more than staring dazedly for a long beat Steve began to lower his arm, his smile dimming into something more polite and apologetic.
“If you’re going to try and suggest that we just roll over and go to bed I’m gonna lock you out of the cabin.” Tony let his breath out in a huff when the world spun and his back hit the mattress, 200 plus pounds of super soldier settling like a blanket on top of him.
Ok, maybe he was a bit twitchy for some other reasons as well. In his defence, they had been at this for a while and it was beginning to look like mutual masturbation was going to be the wedding night shenanigans of choice. Kissing was a no-go, meaning that despite their most enthusiastic efforts they could rule out oral (“
Tony contented himself with trading sloppy kisses for a while, just enjoying the buzz of alcohol and a warm body against his, but apparently Steve wasn’t as happy to slow down. In the space between one kiss and the next he slotted a thigh between Tony’s legs, pressing right up against his cock and
He felt heat rising to his cheeks as he thought about Steve’s huge hands in his hair, muttering praise that Tony couldn’t even fucking remember but fuck had it been hot.
“You need to relax, Tony,” Clint said, resting a hand on his shoulder, “Hop in that magnificent pool, go to the swim-up bar, and have yourself a drink. Chill out a bit.” He huffed when Tony just looked askance in response, rolling his eyes and shoving him slightly. “Just go. Get a little drunk in honor of the last day of my bachelorhood.”
“C-close-!” He gasped, fisting the sheets in one hand as he pumped his cock. Steve kept up a stream of filthy praise, taking him right to the edge and shoving him off. Tony spilled over his fist, feeling the warmth of Steve’s release follow shortly after.
“He’s not even lucid! If you want to cuff him to the goddamn bed, then you’re going to have to move me to do it.”
Tony couldn’t even come up with a defense, trying his best not to just shrink away from Steve and any touch he might inflict. He saw his faceplate crumpled in Steve’s hand.
“Or amazing, at least,” Bucky grunts.
“Tony, wait. What? Are you saying you don’t think it was an accident?” Steve stopped walking, tugging Tony around and to a stop too. “Do you think he did it on purpose?”
“Excuse me?” Tony asked.
He pushed to his feet and walked over to his suit. His name was on the tip of Steve’s tongue again, but he couldn’t bring himself to open his mouth.
The room beyond the glass is now empty, and Steve can't hold himself up anymore. His body sags, the weight of it pulling him towards the floor. He's been injured for too long to put up much of a fight for long. He's fought and struggled, begged and offered Tony everything in his power to give, and it, all of it, has been rejected. One after the other, until all that Steve had had left was himself.
The room shook from it all, or maybe it was just Steve’s gurney. He didn’t know, and he kind of cared, but the constant pain was fading to an ache, so he didn’t question it. A voice came at him like an adult from the Peanuts show he’d found had been made from those funnies that had appeared in the papers after his death. It was followed by another sharp pain that he couldn’t flinch from, but at least it was a short-lived one. Besides, in the grand scheme of things, what was one more prick?
“I’m sorry,” Steve was saying, “the meeting was longer than I expected. Do you still have time for lunch?”
“Right. I’m assuming no hospitals still… so am I calling someone else for you since you and the good doctor are on the outs?”
Tony groaned in answer, the sound short and wet with the metal o-ring holding his mouth open. Steve smirked, watching the drool pool up and spill out of the corners of Tony’s mouth as he pushed his tongue against his teeth, against the ring, anywhere but flat in his mouth.
The rest of his ‘time off’, Tony brought Iron Man out for little things, much to Victor’s amusement, which Tony largely ignored. He couldn’t go much bigger than stealing from pocket cells’ shipments that basically amounted to nothing more than gang-war terrorism. If he tried anything larger, then SHIELD would be alerted, and Tony really wasn’t in the mood to face Captain America so soon, or again really.
Seawise Giant
Tony wants to pull his hands free, drag Steve's hips forcibly into each thrust, but Steve's grip is tight, unyielding, and he starts to meet each thrust on his own. His skin is positively slick with sweat, the beads of it dropping to splash against Tony's skin.
Tony will swear that whine of the motor in the butt plug is loud in the quiet cafe on level five, and he grips the edge of the table as his foot jerks out to kick the wide base of the table.
Victor paused, leaving Tony to blow out a breathy sigh.
“You sure know how to pick ‘em, Rogers,” Sam said, turning on his stool to face Steve, “Potential brainwashed best friend from the 30’s running around like a ghost --which, thanks for the invite to the coldest place in December by the way-- and now… Now, you have a potential supervillain boyfriend that’s practically throwing down the- He’s throwing down the gauntlet! To Pierce!
“You trust her with D.C. already?” Victor stepped away from the fireplace then with a thoughtful hum, “Are you sure you don’t have a concussion? I believe the last I heard of that AI, you were railing against the injustice of creating such a contrary, useless program.”
"What the hell?! I can't just pretend everything is okay, Tony!"
“Stand down, Iron Man!  If you do not comply, we will detain you under force!”
“Tell you what, Cap. I’d really hate to get all cleaned up just to come back here and get all dirty again, so why don’t you run out and get dinner, and we’ll eat here?” Tony watched Rogers’ expression process his words then go quietly neutral. He felt bereft for a moment when the hand on his cheek pulled away.
“So che è difiicile, Antonio,” his mother murmured. Her hand smoothed down the forming wrinkles in his black suit, “Mi mancherà anche Jarvis.”
It’s not the first time, he’s sure, but it’s the first time that it hits him so plainly between the eyes.
He can’t even take off the helmet and he doesn’t know if he wants to. There’s a pit in his stomach that tells him he won’t want to face this.
The War Machine goes dark, leaning back as the vital signs fail and the locks are released. Pepper is frozen in shock, dangerously unguarded, and Steve can’t process anything that’s beyond kick-punch-move as he struggles to get to Pepper and Rhodey. But he sees Bucky isn’t coming their way. He’s standing off to the side, seemingly taking his cues from Tony who is still standing a few feet away, watching Pepper break down over Rhodey. Sam’s damaged wings are signalling his position on a rooftop where he’s firing back at the agents closing in on Clint.
“Jarvis,” he growled, watching the bot that had thrown him. It seemed to watch Tony for a long moment before it was joined by four others and began to walk down the street towards him.
“Fuck you, you want my help or not?”
“The news said there were at least fifty bodies in the containers,” Hydra Bob helpfully informed, “not to mention the employees. Most of them were dissenters that had been previously reported missing.”
So fucking grateful that he doesn't mind being shoved up against a wall again, but this time they're chest-to-chest, and Steve's smile tastes like margaritas and the promise of a good ride.
Tony snarled, but when he went to turn over, Pierce just caught up the chains and dragged him up the pier.
Ronin didn’t visibly react. He just replied with a sardonic, “You look like shit,” that got a pained, tired laugh out of Tony.
“You forgot one thing about bad guys like us,” Ronin hissed, “We got friends too, asshole.”
"Of course," he says smoothly, perfection in hiding the bitter acidity in his tone. He secretly hopes the girl is allergic to peanuts. And he almost doesn’t manage to feel guilty about it.
Secondly, or maybe one-b as an addendum to the first, never trust anyone.
, of your songs debuted in the top fifty. That’s amazing!”
“When you had the flu, but your files before that,” he answered, “We’ve suspected you for a long time. Fury just wanted the proof.”
She frowned as his heart began to beat faster, too fast. He was restrained in a bed with machines. He had to get free. If Pierce found him like that, he’d be a dead man with no chance to fight. He pulled at the cuff, yanked at it like a baby grasping at a toy. The woman backed up once, mouth moving. Her words came to him from a tunnel, muffled and indistinct, spoken to a shadow in his peripheral.
“Aww, I thought you’d never ask.” The reply was deadpan, but Tony had to hop down from the lab table and turn away to hide his reaction. Except, he could never hide from Steve, at least not anymore. That was made evident by Steve’s heat that was suddenly pressed against the length of Tony’s body. His large hands slid forward and around to cover Tony’s hands.
"S.H.I.E.L.D. agents?" Tony nervously licks his lips and Steve hums low in his throat.
you that they’re connected to Pierce.”
He never did get a chance to ask Tony to be his best man. He’ll have to remember to do that when he wakes up, make the time. He should…
“It’s a garage sale,” the engineer pointed out. “You’re supposed to buy strangely compelling, useless crap.”
“Now, J!”
Blue netting formed from the repulsors, shooting out in all directions to connect together and create a barrier between the airport and the two planes behind Tony. The wall barely reached the roof of the airport when the crates exploded. Instantly, the Terminal disintegrated into debris of glass and shrapnel. It slammed into Tony’s shielding like heat-seeking missiles, slicing through in places despite Tony’s best efforts to reinforce the barrier. A few of the repulsors flickered out and fell to the ground, leaving gaps in Tony’s defense.
Steve was quiet, then he pulled Tony into a hug. He waited until Tony finally brought his arms up, too, to return the gesture before he spoke.
“Hold the elevator!” Pepper yells across the marble floor as a man exits the glass lift.
“Oh my god, just do it!” Tony nearly shouted, quickly losing focus again. He barely registered Clint knocking the shotgun further out of Tony’s reach, then folding the belt in half before shoving it in Tony’s mouth.
Steve is distracted by his own mutterings concerning the investments his company had wanted to make with a particular piece of art, but he’s not so distracted that he doesn’t notice the lump of a man struggling in the gutter just ahead. He pauses and contemplates the situation as the man tries and fails to get back on his feet.
Harmony
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis answered. He went quiet and Tony turned the radio on, choosing soft classical instead of his rock that he normally would. He wasn’t in a loud sort of mood and Tchaikovsky was doing wonders for his stress level.
Tony had to force himself -and seriously, he’d examine that thoroughly later- to avoid the date-like setting of dinner with the Captain. He made a thoughtful noise, like sucking breath through his teeth.
“What was supposed to happen,
, got stuck in his head. He kept his back to the restaurant doors and waited for the maitre d’ to return to elegant podium.
That seals it. Tony has Pepper get him the next available appointment and she sounds amused when she relays that the tailor has refused Tony’s request to have the fitting done at the Tower.
“File it,” Tony grunted as he was pile-driven into the ground. He latched onto the Doombot, kept hold of him atop the other struggling metal bodies. “Now, Jay!”
Tony glances up at him with an emotion in his eyes that the asset can’t decipher. It’s gone after a brief moment, and he does recognize that it was a slip.
The presence disappeared, taking the fake suit of armor with it and jarring Tony forward. He stumbled as the world rushed back into motion. He could hear Steve suddenly, yelling out orders for him to stop, and barely had time to hear the incoming whistle before he was bending backwards to avoid the shield that cut through the air above him. He fired a repulsor at the ground, spinning himself to the side and back into flight, skimming the ground to avoid the rebound of the shield.
“And the suit?” Steve wondered.
"Safe from pain. And truth. And choice," Steve is right behind him now. Tony feels Steve’s hand curve against his neck, fingers brushing the pulse in his throat that’s beating too fast. "Those other poison devils. They don’t give a fuck about you, not like I do."
“Dinner?” It finally registered that Rogers had said he’d missed lunch. Without asking, Jarvis supplied the time in his ear; past dinner time. He leaned back against the turbine and eyed Rogers. “No ulterior motive, huh? Just doing your duty as a concerned citizen to feed me? What about the other bay workers in here? Jerry over there hasn’t eaten either.”
He shudders out a breath and goes to grab a box.
The man beside them is snickering. “I told you it was a she, Buck.”
“I assure you, Rogers,” Tony murmured, “I’m being deadly serious. I want you to take the suit from me. Lock it up. Keep it on you. I promise you, then something will happen. It’ll all culminate right before your eyes after that.”
He keeps his hands to himself, shoving them into his pockets and rocking forward into an aimless path through the store. He’s crouched down to examine a roll of blue acetate fabric. It’s such a clear azure that Tony immediately thinks of calm skies and flying. He wants it.
Bucky drags himself upright, and there’s a gun in his hand. Tony punches in a code, and the chamber begins to fill with a cryogenic solution. Steve can’t hold his breath, can’t do anything but let it happen as Tony uses a small adhesive disk to destroy the buttons of the console.
Tony husks out a laugh, the burn of it ripping along his throat. He moves his shoulders a little to the side, and he knows he's thrusting the plug maybe a little too hard, but he can feel the fine tremors under Steve's skin, and they're driving him crazy.
Steve’s heart thumped once at the expression that washed over Tony’s face. It was fury and pain, and then it was a mask. A perfect shift that hid him from everyone who didn’t know any better. Steve knew better, and he hated that facade.
“For now,” Steve repeats with a knowing smile. “Come, up on the pedestal, please.”
Her mouth twisted, hands fisting at her sides. It wasn’t her fight and, if she threw herself into to help, she’d probably just make things worse. No one in the fight would certainly thank her for it. And the brass would definitely come down hard on her, Carter’s ‘tough love’ meted out with an unyielding hand.
Pepper hadn’t noticed and he’d let her continue as if nothing was amiss all the while surreptitiously looking for Steve or Bucky. Certainly he’d know if they’d come down to the lower floors.
“Tell me,” Tony says and his voice is wrecked just from that act alone.
Tony was a songwriter; he was used to sappy declarations and sexy guarantees. And he chanted Steve’s name as they wrapped around each other, as Steve eased himself in Tony with a slow, torturous stroke.
“J,” he said tiredly, “compile everything from the incident and all reports following. I want to look at them later with a clear head.”
The next night, Tony slipped into Amara’s with a hat and sunglasses on. He felt like a complete douchebag, but to be fair, he always did when he had to wear sunglasses at night, because that old song always,
“Going to be my knight in shining armor, Mr. Stark?”
Tony’s mouth waters. “Steve,” he says, dazed. Steve’s gaze jerks to his and his hips shift forward like he was already looking for friction. Tony settles a careful hand on Steve’s hip bone. “You’ll have to keep still.”
“It’s not good, Cap,” Sam says lowly. “Buck’s… Bucky’s gone, but so is Tony.”
“Jarvis?!” Tony shouted as the two beams of energy connected and shockwaved out with enough unforgiving force to rip apart the GCT terminal. In a corner of his HUD, Tony saw the body count rise, but it was dismissed, shunted to the side under the push forward to slam into Crossbones. He staggered down to a knee as Crossbones flew backwards into a crumbled pile of metal containers.
His valet walks slightly behind him, mouth downturned at having allowed his employer to walk. But then again, not many people could tell Steve Rogers no, not many would want to. So he follows and subtly directs Mr. Rogers when their directions require a turn at a cross-street.
“You keep saying ‘he’. How do you know for sure?”
It’s irrational, he knows that. He knows it on a visceral level that he’s being ridiculous. All he has to do is sit forward and join the conversation.
Tony smirked and leaned back against the table, the expression pulling at the bruised skin around his eye and mouth as he said; “What, Cap? Did I hit the nail on the head? Do you think my suit is sexy?” He certainly had in the dream, Tony knew, almost salivating every time Iron Man had come close to where he knelt. “Maybe after humping my leg, you can clean it up with your ton-”
Time stretched and stretched, Steve’s mind wildly conjuring up images of rubber bands extending until their material was going white under the strain. And then, the immediate sensation was snatched away as coolness hit him in patches across his body. Odd noises filtered through his muffled hearing: squeaks and squeals, numerous voices that ranged from low to high to funny to exasperated.
“Ah, I think I can manage that for you. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
This was neither the beginning nor the end, the asset remembers. His instructions are clear.
“Make sure Pepper and Rhodey have nice memorials.” Tony looks over as Bucky stirs, and he drops his head once with an unsteady breath out. “‘You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.’ Isn’t that what they say?”
“Of course it is,” Victor sneered. He stepped away from the portal and waved Steve towards it, “Go on. It’ll take you to Anthony, and we will follow with his suit. I assume you’d like to be the one to ride to his rescue, the white knight.”
“You need to leave,” Steve says to Pepper.
The argument, for their voices had gotten very loud by that point, faded to a buzz of conversation that Tony couldn’t quite decipher. He kicked off the wall to take the few steps across the hall to the windows. Looking out over D.C., Tony felt a lying sense of peace. The cherry blossoms were bright and pink and filling the air with their thick, floral scent. Tony knew, though, how much of a lie it really was. If one got close enough to the trees, they’d see the browning petals, the buds dying that would never get the chance to be full blooms. They would see the ground littered in a graveyard smeared over pink and yellow.
“‘It don’t,’ she said, ‘It makes ‘im human.’”
“Run,” he thinks he says, but the world is already falling away, and he hopes that he gets to see Carol again when this is all over. He thinks he could really love that woman for the rest of his life. He thinks of the ring on the dresser in his apartment, hidden there because Carol stays in his room at the Tower. He thinks of his last year at MIT and how he and Tony had promised to marry each other when he was fifty and inevitably still single.
Pepper answers, “To be fair to you, that’s not the worst thing you’ve ever done on me.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony croaks out and Steve’s sigh is audible.
"I’d like to take you to dinner, Tony," he says softly, smiling like he hasn’t just blown Tony’s mind a little.
Tony ducked around the last of the obstacles and heard Steve call out, but it wasn’t angry this time, only worried.
Turning around to find more than a half dozen men crowding the doorway to the shed, Stephanie put her hands slowly up, palms forward. “Now, fellas, think about what you’re doing. Surely we can work this out.”
Steve shook his head, muttering, “Goddamn it, Tony. There’s already no going back. All that’s left for you is a prison cell if you don’t even try to cooperate.”
He pulls away from Steve and their friendship. Hides in the catacombs of his lab. Buries himself in wires and metal and inventions, lets Jarvis recommend new places and ideas for Steve to take obviously more deserving people than Tony. So he doesn’t see Steve’s hurt gazes or dismayed expressions.
” The music was too loud. The singer was right against his eardrum, pounding against his brain like a bass beat. His eyes were open, but only enough to see that the lights were changing too fast.
“Yeah, uh, um.” Tony flushed and swallowed. “Please.”
“You okay there?” Ronin asked rhetorically.
“Do you need anything else, or should I just let you get to work?” Rogers asked, shifting again and seeming to firmly ignore the blush that was back in his cheeks.
“Tony, you haven’t dated since Tiberius,” she said, tone cautious around the ex-boyfriend’s name. “You haven’t even pretended to bring home a groupie! It’s been four months, the press has noticed. I know you don’t care, but I’m tired of the rumors and the gossip that you’re still heartsick over him.”
It was much later that evening that it happened.
“We’ve gone over everything more than once. Even you had to agree that Iron Man wasn’t responsible for half the shit they’ve said.” Sam put his hand up for another round, and Steve briefly considered asking for something weaker before Sam passed out on the floor, but he just let it go.
“It has to be this,” Tony replies, running a hand over the console attached to Steve’s chamber, “Do me a favor when you wake up.”
He tries not to think too much about it.
“I’d have to hear your platform first,” Steve teased, leaning down to kiss Tony goodbye, “Text me later and tell me how the tour went and if the kids loved your robots as much as I do.”
“Looks like your left patella is making a bid for freedom,” Clint answered casually, prodding Tony’s leg again.
Everyone is gathered around the large dining set in the common dining room. They’re all laughing; playing cards and having fun betting with pretzel sticks of all things. There are little piles of the salt-ridden snacks all over the table. Half of Thor’s are broken and scattered as he keeps forgetting they’re there.
think about. Her shoulders were too broad, her arms too thick. The muscles from carrying her frame across her back were thick and too manly.
“No,” he said faintly, body going hot and cold at the implication that they’d had the same dream, shared the same experience, that Steve would have heard how desperately in lo- “No. No, you’re the one lying this time. It’s not possible without magic!”
“You’re here...now. You’re here…” Tony tugged at Steve’s shirt. “You couldn’t have known. No one… He… I didn’t want...I love you. I love-”
“Shut it all down and get Victor on the line,” he ordered.
“Bud’mo!”
Good, at least he won’t die alone.
When he tried to move his hands, he found his wrists caught in what was most likely the same metal that was wrapped over his mouth. He let the frustration well up through every inch of his body, disgusted with himself for his predicament.
Steve pulled back then, despite Tony’s attempt to keep him close, and brought Tony’s hands down from his head. Tony watched him stare at his hands, thumbs swiping over Tony’s callouses.
“You’re an idiot. But yeah, I can.” It was clear from Ronin’s tone that he was rolling his eyes.
The noise that rips out of Steve is a broken and ragged version of Tony’s name and Tony can feel Steve’s orgasm building through his balls up through his cock. The first spurts of semen spill out around the sound, yet Tony is still strict in how careful he pulls the rod out.
"You don't know what you're talking about," Tony yanked once, in vain, against Steve's hand, certain that he would find bruises later.
Tony makes sure he won’t lose the sound on the floor then ducks down to lick up Steve’s mess, lube and all, before he turns his head to lap at the head of Steve’s cock. It’s red and angry and drooling the last of his orgasm. Tony eagerly sucks it up and Steve’s hands clench now in Tony’s hair.
“People like you?” Steve asked. He waited for Tony to take a seat before returning to his. “Peggy said it was difficult for you because you’re a musician.”
what it does to you! And you’re just going to keep letting them take you apart until there’s nothing left! And then what?! You’ll pull yourself together and go back out there to
(sexy scenes arts)
“Tony, please.” Steve’s voice is barely audible, and he thinks he might just die from fear alone before the process starts. He feels guilt as he thinks the others’ deaths had been easier. Mercies.
He pushes away from the docking station of the Mark VI and the wheels on his stool squeak once as he wheels over to the closest table between Steve and him. He folds his arms over the tabletop and rests his chin on them, watching Steve with a fond smile.
“I know who it was.”
“You didn’t see yourself on that table,” was Tony’s low response as the door swung shut after him. Iron Man’s faceplate turned towards Steve, empty and eerie.
“Hello, sir,” Steve greeted with a smile.
He tried to blink, but his eyes wouldn’t open. The weight of his body still held him down, and his breathing was beginning to slow. He tried to grasp at his train of thought, Tony and his feelings, but everything was slipping through his fingers until finally…
“Just pull out the ten best bottles of whatever liquor you pretend you don’t have, and open up. I’ll be there soon.”
“Oh, Cap, they’re sheltering you,” Tony laughed. He made a ‘shooing’ motion with his hands. “Go on, then. Dinner. I’ll be right here, starving.”
“Maybe it was the open bar. Though, I’ll admit I wasn’t there for long. The same speeches and platitudes. I know how much you hate those,” Pierce said with a jesting tone that quickly disappeared as Steve frowned. “I was actually meaning to make time to visit you myself this month. I heard the strangest thing last week.”
Tony smiled, this time fake, fake as anything he could do with sunglasses on. “For a moment there, you almost had me. I’m always aware of what revolves around me.”
“Captain!” Before his title was even finished, Steve was halfway across the room, striding towards that redheaded agent as if his conversation with Tony hadn’t been life altering. The woman eyed Tony, and he forced himself to turn away, waiting until their steps had faded before he braced his hands on the table. After a moment, he sunk down and pressed his forehead to the cool metal, breathing out in counts of five to calm himself.
Tony continued to clutch at his guitar like a security blanket, contemplating on using it as a defense if he had to, but Pepper’s touch was soothing, and he felt himself relaxing next to her.
“I’ll take a sampler as my meal, just the one in the picture. Tony?”
Tony had laughed in their faces. He was Tony Stark, playboy, remember? He’d stretched out on the bed, naked and blissed out from their morning activities.
Crossbones sighed like it was the biggest hassle and pulled forward a large shotgun that had been strapped to his back.
“Hey,” Steve smiles, a soft expression meant to put them both at ease. “I didn’t think you were coming out.”
“Welcome home, Cap,” he said.
“A lot of people died today, Victor,” Tony pointed out with frustrated grunt. “Maybe we can focus on that?”
“Fried...oreos?” Rogers looked puzzled, slightly horrified but also slightly intrigued.
“Get him up there,” Tony instructs shortly, pushing to his feet by bracing his hands on his knees. He indicates the set of hooks suspended from the ceiling. They’re on cabling not quite as strong as Steve’s shield, but Tony had tested them with one of his suits. They held.
Rogers lifted a hand, hesitated as he searched Tony’s face, then carefully rubbed at Tony’s cheek. Tony felt grease give way under Rogers’ thumb, and while he was relaxed against the turbine, his heart was pounding fiercely.
Tony just shook his head and picked up his fork to poke at the romaine.
Fury was silent for a long time, taking longer and longer sips at his margarita until he simply plucked the umbrella from the side and drained the glass. Tony listened to the ice clinking around, focusing on the bright colors of the umbrella. The glass came down onto the table and Fury was leaning in again.
"It's okay,” Tony says, because it is. He hasn't told Steve who he is yet, or confirmed if Steve already knows. Who is he to judge? They're young and in lust, maybe love. They get drunk a lot, get matching tattoos; two streaks of twisting colors, red and blue, passion and clarity. Steve's goes on his bicep, and Tony's goes on his left hand in the curve of his thumb and forefinger.
I think you can do,” Fury continued, “Despite how you’ve attempted to handle things, you’ve been doing good keeping Hydra from getting their weapons where they want them to be. Granted, we’ve lost a lot along the way too.”
“You know,” Steve says quietly, musing, hands stroking lightly over Tony’s skin. “I read that these can also be used in electro-stimulation.”
“And get some of those cases signed, Tony. I mean it!”
Tony’s fingers twisted around the cuff grips, smacking his hands against the wall. Steve ignored him, ducking down to nuzzle into Tony’s cock. He licked his lips then licked from the base of Tony’s shaft to the tip, sucking lightly at the dripping slit. He made sure to avoid the carefully-tied ribbon around his balls and base.
Steve backed up once, assessing, as the man stepped forward.
-- climb to his feet, but he couldn’t stop the rage, teeth bared inside the suit. He wanted to scream, but instead, he fired everything he had left in the suit. He didn’t wait to see the ground collapse under the Captain’s feet, or the debris from the previous explosions fall into the crater after him.
“Pep, no! I need-I need-”
“You were wearing a wedding ring…”
“Captain Rogers’ field evaluations indicate that it is a possibility.”
“He’s dragging you through the mud, Tony! If he keeps getting you negative press, your f-”
Stark kicked the soldier for good measure, smirking as he dry heaved in the grass. Stephanie had enough presence of mine to kick the cadet in the face as he tried to rise behind her.
“It’s just…” Tony trailed off then came back to it, “Bob was lookin’ for some…”
Perfunctory words. Perfunctory response. Neither of them mean anything they say now.
He shrunk back. He didn’t want to see this. His heart was in his throat as he met his own eyes across the room. They were dull, dilated. Wet. He’d cried. He hadn’t known that. He hadn’t known any of it. He’d hidden from what was happening, drugged and uncomprehending.
, nicely,” Natasha said, low and promising. She slid their palms together and heat sang up Stephanie’s arm. “But come. I’ve been waiting for this for too long, Titanborn. I’ve watched you swing that sword like it it’s a twig in a storm. And that shield? Bah! I’ve seen training dummies wield it better.”
Because then Steve noticed how Tony seemed softer with him, more affectionate. They moved around each other in the kitchen while they made dinner for Bucky and Nat and Steve was hyper aware of Bucky’s raised brow and quirked mouth at Tony’s seemingly innocent touches. A brush against his arm. A hand at his lower back. A playful nudge of an elbow.
Hand-drawn postcards that depict cities.
Tony snorted. “You came back to me, Doom. You wanted my company’s good name to help you facilitate good relations with the U.S., and you wanted my good name to prove you were going on the up-and-up. It just so happened that I needed your help too. Mutually beneficial arrangements abound,” he finished dryly.
And he dropped his ribboned fingers to Tony’s ass, stroking the soft material where Tony was stretched open on his cock. Tony’s heels kicked, words inaudible but long and desperate.
Iron Man kicked the grenade as the projection on his HUD directed, but he wasn’t counting on Captain America interfering again right away. The Captain slammed his shield down over the grenade, glaring at Iron Man as the explosion rocked them both.
It just so happens that SHIELD and its affiliates will no longer have access to it. So go ahead, Nick, blackmail me all you want. Splash my name across the papers, but have fun crawling to Hammer to resupply everything SHIELD touches.”
Tony’s heart swells with adoration and he all but scurries into the bathroom. He makes himself slow down and carefully wash himself up. He uses the special soap he’d purchased just for this to make sure his hands are as clean as he can make them. He’d been careful not to let grease and oil collect under his nails the past few days, so it’s easy enough.
He pressed the number for his floor then leaned back, resting his head against the wall and crossing his arms. Watching the numbers climb, he thought about the weight Tony had still carried long after they’d returned to the helicarrier. Through the glass windows of the lab, Tony had looked paranoid and distracted even as he’d gestured wildly between Agent Coulson and the litter of robot pieces they’d hauled back. He’d caught sight of Steve watching eventually and had turned his back, but not before Steve had seen his haunted gaze.
He looked over to Tony then, and if he was surprised to see Tony awake, he didn’t show it. Perhaps he’d noticed the change in Tony’s breathing, the shift in the atmosphere when you’re no longer the only awareness in the room. He just kept talking like Tony had been listening the entire time.
Burning hot. In love.
Steve frowned.
“You try saying no to them,” Tony snorts then tenses, because he’s not sure if he’s allowed humor -sarcastic or not- yet.
“Sir, if you’d please, my rooms are just on Praed Street. If I may assist you there, my valet will fetch a physician for you,” he said. “I’d like to see that you’re taken care of.”
okay?” Tony asked, kneeling close to the curving edge of the turbine. He braced his hands on his knees as he peered down at Rogers. The smile he was given in return was pleased.
According to the way Steve’s gaze dipped down to Tony’s smile, and the way his own expression flattened, there was no ‘probably’ about it. Steve held out a hand.
A few days later, Clint was perched on a rooftop that, with the right equipment, afforded him a view of Stark’s room. His cowl was rumpled against his shoulders, and the heavy night-vision mask sat on his face, causing a bead of sweat to trickle down along his jaw. He’d been on this rooftop every night since Captain America had taken the Iron Man suit, and honestly? He was getting a little bored of watching Stark sleep and was kind of hoping that something would finally happen.
“I don’t want to bruise you, Captain,” Tony said coolly, the voice mechanic, the tone ringing true despite it. “Bruises are personal, intimate. You haven’t even given in yet.”
“Eh. That was easy. Making you scream was more satisfying.”
He could easily snap them all, so why hadn't he? When he tried to even focus on the answer, it slipped away, just out of his grasp.
"But you-" Steve cuts him off, leaning down with a swift, hard kiss. One hand plants itself beside Tony's head on the covers and the other takes Tony's hand and brings it back to Steve's ass.
