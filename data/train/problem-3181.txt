After getting no response other than a blank stare, she utters, “well, you better get a move on then, or I guess I will.” Leaving no time for judgement, she turns more fully so she is seated sideways in her chair, the better to project her voice so she won’t have to repeat herself. Straightening his body, Dean braces for the event that he has been internally dying to hear out of curiosity this entire morning.
Dean seems to match her gaze and looks back at his brother almost as if asking for permission to which Sam only shakes his head in disapprovement. Anael drags the giddy prince away in a hiss of whispers and giggles. Castiel can’t help but feel a pang of... jealousy? What is wrong with him? He knows the older Winchester prince is out of his reach, and besides they both look so happy together and even better as a couple. Shouldn’t he be delighted at other people’s happiness? His own sister’s? He feels disappointed in himself and something of a small pout must have shown on his face between the sulking because Anna picks up on it immediately and hushes him in a sharp, strict whisper, like she is cursing a misbehaving child.
Before Dean can muster a valid excuse for his actions, he is interrupted by the hushed growl of Sir Robert Singer, Dad’s adviser, from behind, “listen to your father, boy.” Grumbling under his breath, Dean zooms in on the tedious exchange of pleasantries between the two monarchs.
Chortling, they join the cracking joke and Dean is glad to have eased the agitated tension between them. It’s the second time he is impressed and rather shocked at Anna’s personality, but it just proves to show that he should really get to know this family better. Sensibly, it should be his top priority to make everyone’s lives easier and it would at the same time get the king off his back, Dean thinks as his thoughts return to the cold conversation they had yester afternoon. However, more positively, he silently admits that he is feeling more than a little excited to show his guests more of the Winchester way of life, and in turn learn about theirs, incredibly eager to start this possible new friendship. He already has a feeling that these two are a few of the better siblings, easier to get along with, but under no circumstances will he judge others by gossiping tales of young girls. Besides, that’s what he’s expected to do anyway.
The flat statement holds no true meaning behind it but Anael still abruptly leaves them with a wink and prowls over in her iconic hungry stance.
Under his breath, Dean voices, “yeah, we kinda got that already,” loud enough for Sam to hear who promptly elbows him in consequence. He was getting impatient and quite frankly he just wanted someone to tell him
As a means to cease the sudden outrage, Sam sits quietly and reflects on the current situation. If it is truly as helpless as Dean makes it out to be, then it looks like he may have to be the one to step in. “Fine. I’ll talk to Anna, try to find some middle-ground. Don’t do anything stupid while I’m gone,” and with that Sam strides out of the room.
“ – would be beneficial for both parties, don’t you think?”
A curt scoff is enough to awaken him from his thoughts. “I knew it,” is all Sam has to say to have Castiel enveloped in a flood of red, hot embarrassment at being caught staring. He really should know better when it comes to Sam. It kind of makes him feel as if the whole silent exercise was on purpose, and he shouldn’t be surprised if it was, but Castiel is too busy trying to cover up his mistake to dwell on that much longer.
“Aw, shit. Believe me, I truly didn’t mean it like that, it’s just...” the prince falters in his speech, evidently taking a breath before saying “weird, I guess. Could we like, skip the formalities? I’m kinda used to everyone calling me just Dean, and I definitely don’t act like a prince.”
“I thank you for the warm welcome, John. I do hope it is not a bother if we stay for a while -“
For a while, Dean just stands there too shocked to move but as he eventually comes to, he looks around to see his brother having witnessed the whole affair from the archway, wearing a mirrored expression of dumbfoundedness. Dean’s features harden as he clears his throat and rumbles out a snappy, “What?”
Stalking through the halls, he finally stumbles to his door, when the one adjacent opens, revealing a young, blonde fellow, tall and lean, stumbling out in front of a giggling Anael. He can’t be more than a stable boy, so how he got in here he has no clue. Neither had he any clue that Anael had left the meal, but then again, he currently isn’t in the right head-space to pay attention to anything, really. Lurking quietly in the shadows, Castiel watches the display a little longer, and it looks like he successfully hasn’t been spotted yet by the pair, so he refrains from entering his room just a little while longer, despite how much he wants to sink into that soft mattress. He has a few words to tell Anael anyway.
Suddenly, blasts of trumpets signalling the arrival of the King alert them back to reality.
“I don’t think you realise just how truly we’re fucked without the help we’re getting. So, I’m just going to lay it out, plain and simple.” He can see the dark storm rolling over the hills of green in his eyes, clouds of captivating terror, and suddenly John is stepping into his personal space. “You are going to go out there and please their extravagant asses for as long as it takes to get us through this war. I don’t give a damn about what you have to do. So, I’m telling you this, man to man, that if you fuck this up for us, that’s on you.”
“Yeah well, some douchebag couldn’t keep quiet at this ungodly hour and disrupted my beauty sleep. Seriously, if I find out who did this they are gonna regret ever opening their damn mouth.”
“Nothing.” Whereas Sam would usually be trying his best to hide a smug, devilish grin, now only a faintly amused, slightly perplexed look remains. “What was that for?” he inquires instead.
(See the end of the chapter for
. If he could remember, he would surely tell him it was a fun night except there is nothing but a black, empty void in his memory designated for those few dwindling hours at the end of the night when he was basically unconscious, completely unaware of his actions due to his intoxicated state.
“Hello Prince Castiel. Is anything the matter?”
“I have successfully reached the conclusion that our father cannot be trusted.”
“Not for long,” he mutters under his breath, equally as quietly. Anael must not have heard his response or is just used to his silence, so she rambles on, “He’s just so sweet. He’s perfect, but daddy would never allow me anywhere near him, so he mustn’t know. What do you want? I’ll give you anything, just please don’t tell him,” she cries, defeated to begging. Cas ignores her.
“Last time you said exactly the same thing, and you were so drunk, you plummeted 15 barrels in the winery and you ended up sleeping in the stables.”
Watchful, Garth nervously flicks his head both ways, tongue darting out to wet his cracked lips, extremely wary as to not get caught. “They’re sayin’ somebody’s done somethin’ real bad.” He drops his voice lower into a conspiratorial gossip and Dean has to strain his ears to hear him properly, “somebody’s going to hell, that’s for sure. It’s an unforgivable sin.”
The only benefit from the whole ordeal was the awakening and acknowledgment that maybe he just doesn’t find the opposite sex attractive. In fact, he is pretty sure that the first time he came out was to his brother Gabriel completely by accident, but he was good about it, completely not acting like Gabe at all. Afterwards, they had a soothing long talk about his situation and together they worked out a few solutions. He couldn’t really stay in a lasting relationship with anyone, and as heartbreaking as that might be, he knows that it will most likely cause Chuck to get suspicious. Ruling out relationships completely might work but only because he knows that he allowed Anna to focus more on her training, and to be quite completely honest, that is his best shot, but his father had been nagging at him for over a year now, and there is a slightly higher chance that he might not get away with it so easily. Gabriel had been so nice as to go looking outside the village for research of his own accord, and when he came back with intel he told Castiel about a few cases in the neighbouring villages further up North. He told him about a few couples who married in pairs, and then all agreed on secretly seeing each other outside of their marriage. Of course this was unfaithful in the eyes of the Gods and literally broke all the rules in existence, but Castiel wishes he could find someone else that he could possibly do this with. Of course it’s common knowledge that when all the men go off for the annual hunting trip in the summer season or will soon inevitably go to war, the girls like to have a bit of fun, but they are all in it together, so none of them snitch on each other. They keep the secret to themselves and even if Castiel tried to pry some information out of them, none will own up even if it is by the Prince’s command. With the men, it’s a lot different. They also screw around and it is well known among them all that the men of lower rank fuck each other for entertainment, out of boredom or otherwise, especially after a really long period of war when they sit around doing nothing all day while lords and leaders like Castiel himself work their asses off reviewing and strategising their plans of attack. He surely isn’t looking forward to the jokes or rumours circling around camp when they inevitably go to war. The thing is, even if he wanted to take one of the soldiers to bed, he wouldn’t be able to. Edenish custom says that royal marriages are to be the union of both sexes in order for there to be peace and no gender bias when they are on the throne. It is a stupid rule to protect the people from having to follow unfair rules if the monarchs decide to impose some gender biased rules to follow. But should you really be on the throne if you command such infidelities?
He stands up and if all the royal lessons spent stuck in the high tower taught him anything it’s to never leave without speaking out your gratitude. It’s just common courtesy. So, that is why he is now making his careful way over to the youthful Prince Sam, currently perched on the edge of his seat, likely keeping a lookout over every man in this room. Wisdom and morale runs within his body language, making the prince age beyond his years and Castiel is glad to have made his acquaintance.
“No, no, my prince. Just that we’re waiting on you is all.”
“How about: I agreed to a dance, so you must promise me something in return.”
On this particular morning, the hall is full with soldiers despite the early hour, standing, laughing and throwing food, their loud chatter filling the enclosed space. Sunlight pools in through the high windows, illuminating the castle with its early summer glory, and birds are chirping away as they take flight outside. Castiel thinks it’s a really good day for training. He thinks it might even be a good day in general, which for him comes very rarely nowadays.
“It can’t be nothing if I have heard it halfway across the continent. And anyway, I could do with a different sparring partner.”
“Well that’s easy for you to say. You’ve still got jobs to do every day like accountancy, Mr Master-of-Coin. Things Dad
. He knew he walked in on this one.
“Actually, Dean happened.” Already sensing the rise in anger building behind Anna’s eyes, he quickly diffuses the flame. “He just showed his potential I guess. You could say he’s a future rival,” Castiel shrugs off bitterly. Anna listens intently to the vague description of events which she lets slide for now, surely going to interrogate him later about it, and heaves his body up off the ground, catching his bruised arm. Despite trying his hardest not to reveal his pain, Anna still sees through the slight wince he allows himself to show.
Slowly, the congregation sets off again down the narrow, winding route with Castiel hovering nearer to the back and keeping Anael company. They converse about nothing in particular, - the visit so far and likewise –which deflates him with gladness that the usual interrogation is over until eventually, Anael asks the inevitable.
“Aren’t you too drunk for this?” Castiel tries to politely ask, but all condolences seem to fly out the window as fear grips all his senses for worry if he will be the one to throw up tonight and that certainly won’t be a pretty sight. He wouldn’t want to be the one to ruin the party.
“Oh hey there, Dean. You’re up early,” questions Sam.
his body seizes up and Dean can’t say he has ever seen a look of such intense, concentrated terror upon the Prince’s features. It’s worrying and Dean has a wrong feeling in his gut that whatever he’s about to hear is not going to be pretty.
Like ravenous animals they wolf down every inch of beauty this one of a kind fortress caters to provide, and when Castiel thinks that it could not get any more meticulous, they step into the main reception area off which doors are flung wide open for the better access to the other castle facilities to which servants are hurrying to fill with boxes and crates, flying from room to room.
Next door lives Uriel. The servants look like they have already fashioned his space with those ugly curtains and matching sheets that he insists on bringing with him everywhere. Castiel feels a wrong, hideously seething joy from seeing his brother assigned such a sad, gloomy place. He also doesn’t seem to be the only one, because from the uninterested, bored look Prince Dean wears upon Uriel’s depart, it is clear they share the same opinion.
Understanding, Anna lifts her brother gently by the other arm and guides them towards their respectful rooms, slowly progressing through the long castle corridors. Once the tiresome journey has lead them to the comfort of their chambers, Cas gladly peels off the tight leathers but keeps the tan outfit on, mindful to keep it clean throughout the meal as it is his favourite.
Either way, he doesn’t feel up to waiting around here any longer, so with one swift communication to his companions, he makes it clear where his priorities lie. From the look he gets from both of them, it’s quite clear that they couldn’t agree more. Simultaneously, the party of three friends stand and quickly hurry out of the compacted hall, leaving a stunned Dean behind, who has now gone unusually quiet.
“Oh really? So tell me and the rest of the court what it does look like then because we aren’t blind, that’s for certain-“
Castiel thinks as he sways his heavy stick around with him in one fluid motion to greet his brother. However, as fate would have it, he is greeted by the unwelcome sight of the Winchester prince grinning widely like a lunatic, to Castiel’s dismay. Before Castiel has a chance to deny him, Dean gets in the first word.
He is a virgin to the purest extent. He has never come close to any man even friendship wise after his rumour got out, and he utterly refused with girls. He would get teased by it, sure, but he never let it affect him. He knows the men like to joke about, but those words never truly mean anything. They will forget about it in a few weeks time and he won’t be mentioned again until the next season they’re out hunting together again.
At that, Dean’s smile returns and they go on talking about light, conversational topics, easing the walk with a light-hearted atmosphere. Before they know it, they have reached their destination and are approaching the great hall which casts the dark corridor in a dim, yellow glow.
John takes a long hard look at Dean which just borders the line of becoming awkward when he hears the soft croak of John’s voice. “Make welcome our new roommates. Show them around, share strategies, the lot...” John trails off, the sentence lingering in the air around them, demanding silence, and when John speaks again, his voice seems to have dropped an octave or ten. “I mean it, Dean.” A pause. Dean thinks his Dad must be psychic or something because he seems to have witnessed the internal eye roll that Dean had been hoping would go unnoticed. Alas, his father knows him too well.
Returning to the room, he finds Anna in a clean robe already tucked sound asleep in the large, comfy bed. The glowing embers of the slowly dying fire envelop the room with a nice, aesthetic atmosphere, hugging Castiel with softly spoken whispers of safety, comfort and tender love. Quietly, trying his best to not wake the sleeping angel in the bed right now, he tiptoes across the room to his side of the enormous bed and lifting the comforter, climbs in eagerly, the faster to get out the contrasting coldness of outside the warmth of under the sheets. But it seems as though nothing can get past Anna, like she is an all knowing being of the universe, as his sister stirs and drawls out sleepily a, “heya Cas, you done already?” accompanied by a long, wide yawn. Castiel tucks himself safely in one corner, quite content to just fall asleep like this when he feels the slither of a small, slender hand slide up the length of his shoulder and twist him round. A muffled sound voices “come here, you” as he lets himself be tugged at until he is buried against her frail, flat chest, Anna perching her chin atop his crown of hair. Settled in, he whispers a feeble “Goodnight Anna,” into the still night darkness of the room. Silence imprisons his words for so long that Castiel thinks she has fallen into a peaceful slumber, when her hot breath tickles the hair on his forehead, carrying the slow, slurred words of “Night, Cas,” so quiet, he almost can’t make them out. Sometimes, Cas is surprised he isn’t seeing a vision of an angel before him.
Having finished his little speech, most of the siblings seem to return to a state of squalor, as siblings do, talking amongst themselves in whispers, or in Gabriel and Balthazar’s case, not so much. He can see how they are going to become an all too annoying problem all too soon. He turns to his younger brother and with an usher of his hands, declares “lead the way, Samuel.”
“I think that’s enough for today,” Michael says carefully, eyeing the two princes suspiciously, “go get changed boys.”
“Don’t worry, I’m sure it will be far too late to do anything about it at that point. Though it’s also highly encouraged by Mrs Tran, so in any case, I can’t be in the wrong, can I? Don’t you think it’s a great idea?”
. Calmly, Sam is determined to try again.
“Ouch. Can a brother not have a simple conversation with his fellow comrade?”
I'm still unsure if I want to keep Sabriel as a running side plot to the story... it might just complicate things and I am new to writing this pairing. I'm very open to it, it's just that I'm not sure I know the characters that well in a relationship environment to be able to think of something unique for their story.
“Yes,” is his simple answer. The brothers exchange a look that says what-the-hell-is-wrong-with-this-guy, both quite confused at the fellow prince’s behaviour. A beat passes between them and when Dean thinks they aren’t going to get anything else from him, he speaks in a sad, guilty tone, “the young girl is fine, I assure you but it might take a while for her to realise the truth. Please hear the verity from our point of view, I promise it was a misunderstanding. I fully understand if I cannot grace you with my presence any longer, however I hope you would be considerate enough to not judge the rest of my family upon my actions. My apologies but I truly did not take into consideration the Lawrencian custom, I must say I should have familiarised myself with them beforehand. I take full responsibility for what happened so upon a sinful man’s dying wish could you please leave my sister from any harm. It has truly been an honour to have personally met you both and I also understand any punishment that you may wish to inflict upon me. I will take what I deserve but I am afraid I-“
A ray of realisation dawns on his face, but despite working his mouth open and close a million times a minute, he doesn’t seem to be able to produce any general vocal sound. I mean, what is he expected to say when he hears something like that? In all truthfulness, they should be scared with what people might say if they hear some sick, twisted version of the story. In the eyes of the Church, to say it is a crime is an understatement.
He can only hope that she doesn’t charm the whole castle.
Disbelieving, Anna scolds the young prince with a, “you mean you haven’t told them yet?”
“No worries, you could almost say what a coincidence,” Dean replies, stifling a chuckle. “May I ask for one dance?”
“No, I’m just an excellent businesswoman who knows how to take advantage of an opportunity when I see one.” She winks and turns towards the door, ready to walk her brother out, her confidence so profound, that it renders Cas silent. At least she has been taught well on the negociative side of things, he thinks and can’t help being both frustrated and utterly impressed.
“CAS! Are you drunk? I thought you weren’t going to drink that much tonight, you swore by it yourself. Look at you!”
“Okay, but um...” Dean clears his throat as he buys time to think of how to phrase the next awkward question properly. Soon enough, Dean finds that there really is no way to word this comfortably. “You err... didn’t um.... do anything, right?” Dean tries to leave it on a hopeful, positive tone but fails miserably in comforting the targeted audience.
“I love you, so much. I’m going to say it all the time now.” He muttered quietly against Cas’ neck. The Angel just laughed lowly and he felt lips against his head.
Castiel closed his eyes he concentrated now on letting his wings start to form physically inside the room, the span of them filling much of the space. They trembled somewhat as the air of the room brushed over them, a few loose feathers already falling, glimmering a little in the light.
Cas hadn’t been in their bed this morning when he’d gotten up, but a quiet search of the Bunker had found him out in the little garden area out back, talking to the bees in the hive that Dean had absolutely not bought for him the day after they rescued him, thank you very much. Finding that Cas was clearly occupied for the morning, Dean had made coffee, fixed some toast, and then turned his attention to the family dinner tonight.
“Excellent. I’ll be there at 6:30 then. Dress comfortable,” Dean ordered with an ease that tickled the back of his neck pleasantly. “And make sure you text me your address. Now let’s go settle the bill.” He eased himself up now and Castiel quickly followed with a smile.
The human just sucked quickly, his mouth working him over, and Cas—his body trembled at it, his fingers going into Dean’s hair almost at once. The man didn’t even flinch at this, only continuing to suck eagerly, now adding motions which Castiel found most pleasurable. He groaned lowly and his hips rolled up some. The chair seemed to be quite stable, thankfully, and he used that to set a good, slow pace into Dean’s mouth.
“Hmm, of course Dean.” Cas tilted his head slightly, his eyes open, bright and blue and happy. Dean just let his own answering smile raise his lips, and he laughed as Cas slotted himself right up against his side. “Now you have to reintroduce me to everyone,” he muttered lowly. A look of frustration crossed the young academic’s face.
“You know I wouldn’t,” Castiel nodded, and he slipped out of the shop, locking the door and putting the “out” sign up. Then he headed for the edge of town, not far away, and made his way through the trees. Dean was mostly quiet again, though he chittered from time to time, getting similar sounds back. The squirrels were telling him something, it seemed. It was an easy walk to the clearing that had an old tree buzzing with bees, and likely heavy with honey. Castiel hadn't been out here to actually harvest honey in a while; he tried to think politely of the creatures that made it.
He never commented on Cas’ more human behaviors since his return, but he knew his Angel was still very much an Angel too. The flashes of bright blue in the dark when they were together in bed made that clear.
“Next time I groom your wings, I hope you fuck me with that gorgeous cock,” Dean said, his voice raspy, his eyes bright.
“Thank you for this, Dean, for helping.”
He had the bottle of white wine he’d promised to bring and before long was pulled into the parking of a nice apartment complex not too far from his own. The excitement that fluttered in his stomach grew as he got out and texted Dean he was there, making his way up to the door and looking for ‘D.Winchester’ on the list. He found it and reached out to press the buzzer button. The door clicked open almost at once to permit him.
The words were soft and low and Castiel shifted to turn away from Dean as he continued working at the noose of fabric around his throat. “My duty keeps me here, and I cannot trust anyone else with this time of...”
He put that look there, he was the one making Dean’s eyes flutter closed and his lips part in a soft soundless moan.
“Yes, that would be him. Small world, so to speak.” Cas couldn’t help a little chuckle leaving him, which made him glad that Dean wasn’t tattooing him right that second. It felt good though, being able to connect outside of the job like this with the artist. “Any other siblings?”
“....A pillow fort.”
Castiel loved the way his green eyes were soft and expressive all at once. Cas relaxed and let himself just look around some more. “This shop is very cozy I’ve noticed.”
He couldn’t wait for that, though. He was starting to wonder if one of those branches would come to hold Dean’s name. He’d never had that thought about Naomi, and he’d been planning the tattoo even longer than he’d been with her.
“All supplies Cas, just trust me. My phone says there’s a Walmart three blocks away, you can get it all there.” Dean said with a smile. Cas was very confused, because not only was whiskey and junk food on this list but there was a strange assortment of decorations? He thought they were anyway. “If we’re going to be stuck here for a few days because of this snowstorm coming outta nowhere then we are going to enjoy our holiday, Winchester style.”
“Hey, Dean, your appointment for noon next Thursday canceled,” she reminded him, “so I think that opens up a whole block of your afternoon.” The pretty girl grinned at Castiel. “I’m Charlie by the way, glad to see you picked us!”
Dean moved closer and he let his fingers curl around the length of his cock and stroke it a little bit. Castiel couldn’t help the way his lips parted. He wet them a little with his tongue, his breathing catching slightly now.
“I can tell.” Dean leaned up to kiss him properly and warmly now, slow and tender as he worked the finger slowly in and out of him, letting him feel the slide, the way his muscles tried to tighten automatically.
Dean was quick about running the card and handing it back and Castiel found himself tucking it away and signing the receipt in short order. By the time he’d finished, Dean was handing him a proper appointment card. “I’ll email you the art options, and my number is on the card if you have any questions before your appointment.”
“I’ll go.” Castiel said abruptly and he moved to get up, the rustle of his overcoat, the trench coat that was so much him startled Dean out of his thoughts and he grabbed the fabric as Castiel moved to go past him.
“Dean…” He breathed, their foreheads pressed together. Dean blinked, there was, a shimming, he turned his head slightly  and gasped, the sight of wings, well sort of anyway, wrapping around him, spreading over his shoulders, from Castiel’s back.
“Right here.” Dean flashed the card briefly before making it disappear back into his suit jacket pocket. He managed, just barely, not to startle when Castiel took his hand and laced their fingers together. He glanced at his friend and they shared a smile, making Dean miss the look of delight on Sarah’s face.
“D..Dean...I….” Castiel’s eyes flicked around the room quickly and then back to him. “I...I don’t know what to say….”
He neatly plucked the small rose quartz from the bowl, dried it and set it near the candle with a soft click. Castiel quickly blew the flame out, watching how the remaining smoke curled a little with a smile. Then he moved to dispose of the remaining water in the bowl, pouring it outside in the soft soil. He hummed a little blessing to the earth as he did. Two for one – he should remember that for next time.
Dean felt his heart thud. He felt worried, his stomach twisted. What was Cas trying to say? Did the angel want to leave? Even if he did, where would he go? He started to open his mouth.
Cas smiled and then he moved to pour the wine into two glasses that he found in a cabinet. It seemed almost natural to move around Dean’s kitchen to get into things as he could and help set up their dinner dishes. Finally, though, they were settled across from each other and Cas couldn’t help taking that first bite slowly, carefully.
In the middle of this dizzying pleasure, Cas used one hand to work Dean’s jeans down his hips and then he coaxed him to step out of them, only pulling back for a moment to get Dean to spread his legs somewhat further apart. “Cas, please…”
“Actually, this would be my first,” Castiel admitted but then he patted into his trench coat pockets lightly to find the carefully folded paper inside. “I have a sketch of what I’d like, as a base sketch anyway. I would be more than a little interested to see what you do with it, if you take me on?”
Castiel let himself laugh softly now, liking how keen Dean seemed to be at the idea of taking him somewhere he’d never been. He relaxed easily at that, enjoying the music on the radio and the comfortable feeling of being next to Dean. “I like to cook, but Ellen, she’s got some damn good burgers.”
“That can be interesting. Any particular reason why that’s what you teach?” Dean asked casually, but with quite genuine interest.
“Then I’d say it’s a good thing you have my number,” Dean replied, straightening slightly though under Castiel’s gaze, amusement in those beautiful green eyes. Castiel blushed a bit deeper as he realized he did, actually. Dean had given him his personal number when they’d first started talking about his tattoo a week ago.
“I just want to grab a few things from the room, and it will probably make Sam feel better if I at least give him some real idea of what’s going on.” Dean paused and then he shrugged, his fingers full of feathers. “And I should step outside to burn these.”
“Yes, sir.” Cas wet his lips automatically and then he testingly let himself roll up against the press of the finger. Dean seemed amused, not annoyed, which sent a rush of pleasure through Cas, and he just took in a quiet breath, slow and steady as he could manage now. “Please, sir, I want more.”
Their hands met on the bench seat not even halfway there and Cas found himself wishing the night wasn’t ending. He knew better though. He was not going to rush this, mess any of it up—he wanted more than just a couple dates, or even quick fucks. He was fairly sure that Dean could tell, and he suspected the other man had already figured out what he was doing to Castiel, but it was worth it.
For a bit it was quiet between them, though Cas couldn’t quite keep a smile off his face. It was just too wonderful to share this time with Dean. They ate their breakfast steadily and quickly and when they were done Cas moved to get up and take care of his dishes.
When their lips parted a soft little sigh left Cas, not quite a whine, but it wasn’t so far from being not a whine either. He couldn’t believe how much he wanted to just take Dean home with him already. He knew better though; this wasn’t to be some one night stand. Deans fingers brushed against his jaw and then cupped it lightly.
“Should I dress nice?” Cas asked with a laugh in his voice as he looked at Dean, enjoying how the artist leaned in to kiss him slowly. He let his cup settle on the table once again as he shifted closer to him, settling almost into his lap. Strong hands slid down his back to grab his ass.
He slid from the car and took a breath, letting the door close and locking it quickly behind him. He fixed his trenchcoat around his shoulders and then he moved to quietly head toward the front doors of the shop. Within a minute he was stepping inside, the atmosphere open and welcoming. He could see the artist’s work stations in the back, but there was a counter just inside the door and there at it was a handsome man with a well kept beard and a number of tattoos visible on his arms, his green eyes warm and welcoming.
“Sam will be fine with it.” Dean snorted and then he tipped his head to study gorgeous blue eyes. “Honestly? He probably already knows.”
Food in his stomach, another couple drinks down and finally he got the courage up to jerk a thumb at the dance floor “Care to have a go?”
“I can manage that,” Dean agreed.
“We are building a nest,” he announced, as if ignoring Castiel’s protest earlier. The angel’s brow furrowed up once again. He didn’t need a nest. He knew where home was, he had his sort of nest at the bunker, It really was just the mess he’d made of the bed in his room. He’d made sure to lock the door to his room though, always, so that nobody saw it. It was a little embarrassing.
“No, No, Dean.” Castiel quickly squeezed his hand, stopping him from finishing. “Yes. Yes, I’ll marry you, Dean,” he said quickly, as if he realized his blunder in his hesitation and had to get it out. A cheer went up and Dean swallowed hard, scrambling to his feet, his fingers moving to cup that beautiful face.
“How did you figure it out?” Dean asked, his expression soft but worried. Cas was comforted by that and he shifted his weight again.
“C….Cas..” he mumbled quietly and huskily as lips moved to his jaw, down his throat. Cas just made a little noise of want against his skin, and he felt teeth digging against his throat. Quickly he tipped his head back, and Dean slid one of his own hands around to grip his shirt and he rolled up to press their hips together more firmly. “T..thought you said….”
“Then please do,” he murmured softly, only to find his mouth was then quickly claimed by the rather lovely soft lips he’d thought of many times since meeting Dean. He didn’t even notice the soft scratch of his beard. It wasn’t even really a scratch really, but part of him shivered at the sensation when he could focus on it. The idea of that leaving marks on his skin was delightful.
“Fuck, Cas, warn a guy!” Dean yanked away from him the moment they were settled, and the brunet stumbled a few steps back quickly. Castiel blinked at him. Dean glanced around. “...Are we still in the motel?”
“Hey Cas?” His eyes flicked to the bowed dark head of hair. In a moment the other man was glancing up at him, blue eyes bright and his eyebrow up in a way that made a lot of women (and a few men) a bit weak in the knees.
He sighed in quiet delight. “Oh, Dean…”
“Hey, I got you, Cas, just breath,” Dean soothed gently and automatically.
Part of him was surprised with how quickly Dean returned, complete with some things from his bag clearly, but not seeming to be under duress. “Sam apparently has things he could be doing.” Dean’s little frown worried him.
“Come on dude, we’re friends right?” He said firmly and then he moved to get out of the car before Castiel could stop him. He’d help him with whatever it was. He was sure of it. “Girl trouble.”
This was really happening. He was making it happen.
Dean moved around him just as if he were another piece of the furniture. The man starting to undress after a few moments longer, he could hear the shuffling of the fabric. Cas ground his teeth just a little bit—he wanted more, wanted to look, to see Dean, to see how far his tattoos went.
“Oh, good.” Dean laughed and leaned in to kiss him warmly, their lips meeting so naturally that Cas couldn’t help a rush of pleasure, a content happy pleasure. “Can you stay the night?” Dean asked softly as he broke the kiss.
There were some real photos of people, including a handsome brunette with shoulder length hair, his arms wrapped around a pretty blonde woman. There were other photos that had different people, including Dean himself. Art hung along the walls, too, and Dean’s license, as well as multiple pictures of beautifully detailed tattoos.
“You look like you wanna throw yourself into them and snuggle dude. It’s cute” Dean’s words made him squint further, he was fairly sure that Dean was drunk.
Cas drained the last of his own beer and Dean lay down some cash on the table to pay for their food, clearly knowing how much this should cost. Castiel almost protested but there was something in those green eyes that made him hesitate and then just smile. Within minutes they were walking down the street from the roadhouse, and Dean’s hand was around his own, gently tangling their fingers together. It was comfortable and he slowly leaned against the taller man as they walked, enjoying how easy this was this as they went.
“Maybe.” Dean winked before he got up and moved to clear their empty plates.
“Dean!”
Castiel wasn’t concerned; he knew Dean Winchester’s mind. The Righteous Man was not turned away by the male form, though his attraction to it was pushed deeply down and rarely surfaced.
“I don’t dance.” Castiel protested and then Dean just laughed quietly and took a swallow of whiskey, before smirking at him.
For a little while they watched the TV, and just sat there drinking. Cas was relaxed, he could almost imagine letting his wings out, letting them curl around the man next to him. Honestly it would be a pleasure he could never allow himself. Dean was a good friend, and saw him as a brother. It wasn’t the same as when an angel called you brother, not as intimate.
Castiel didn’t even ask what all of the windows on the screen meant. Most of it looked like gibberish, and that was saying something since Castiel happened to be an expert in a number of dead languages. He moved to sit on the end of the sofa and relaxed into it. Abbadon had lifted his head from where he’d curled up behind Lucifer’s head and was watching him, and he smiled at his cat.
“Just wait till you get a chance to eat it,” Dean’s voice called to him from down the short hallway and he stepped into the kitchen. “Figured if you enjoyed Ellen’s burgers so much you had to try the best.”
He tried to think if he’d used candles at all in the last several weeks. He had, but he thought perhaps that the little squirrel had been in his nest and hadn’t seen. He kept the candle away from the little creature, watched how it relaxed as he moved it slightly further away. Fire scared it, then. Not the candle itself.
“Let’s go to bed? The nest will be warmer.” Dean’s voice was low and gentle. Castiel was amiable, after all, this man loved him, and that warmed him more than anything could. He adjusted his wings, keeping them out instead of tucking them away as they lazily moved to settle down. Cas let Dean fuss with the blankets and get them covered before adding one wing warmly to the mix. Dean giggled quietly and reached out to pat the feathers gently. He could tell Dean was tired though.
“Less than you think, and rarely when it’s someone I want to hit on me.” Dean winked at him easily, a clear display of pleasure. “I can get off work early on Saturday.”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“Y-yes,” Castiel choked out.
“I am going into Molt, which I was not expecting. I cannot go back to heaven for it, and so I need a molt companion.” Castiel considered the man before him quietly. He was a good soul and he loved his wife deeply. “There are few on earth I can trust with this time of weakness. But you... you have never been with a man, nor wished to lie with one.”
“...Do you ever feel like you live behind a mask Dean? I mean…. You wear one for work yes? But…”
Castiel swallowed hard. It was very possible he’d made a dreadful mistake in asking Dean to share his molt with him. He was not sure he could regret it though.
“Nah, but I do work with my hands, I’m a mechanic.” Dean winked playfully at the handsome man and wished he knew if there was a blush rising on cheeks under the mask. They’d made it over to the food and It was easy to place his drink to the side and start filling a plate with a handful of treats. Eyeing some of the appetizers curiously. Ellen had been nice enough to label things with ingredients though, known allergens. Helped him avoid the crab meat in one. But the rest was safe enough to eat.
“Well, Thursdays are my day off during the week. Would it interfere very much in my ability to wear a suit?” Castiel asked curiously. He’d done quite a bit of research, but he still wasn’t sure if it would be possible.
“It’s never, not thinking. If our wings do something we are very conscious of it.” Cas said after a long moment, “but you can’t see if they do because they’re on another plane…”
It all started with a business card.
“You’re not so bad yourself,” Dean murmured before leaning in to kiss him slowly, more tenderly than he’d even imagined. Their lips just seemed to lazily work together,  and it wasn’t hard to just got lost in this for several minutes, or what felt like minutes. A knocking on the window made Dean jerk and he bumped his head and swear before he twisted around to frown at the blurry form of Sam who was looking amused.
He double checked the number once more before he dialed it. It was mid afternoon, he knew it was likely too late today for any sort of appointment, but he didn’t really have much time today to do  more than make the call. He hoped it wouldn’t take too long to get in and see the artist for a consult.
“Cas, you may look up,” Dean’s voice sounded, almost startling him now that the man seemed to read his mind on this. He slowly lifted his head though to look.
“Fuck me, Sir.”
A strange feeling of relief washed over him, and Castiel let his head bow as they were silent like this for some minutes. Dean turned his attention towards his left wing after finishing with the right. Castiel let his now groomed right wing flex a little and curl around as he hummed quietly. It would need some more preening, many more feathers would fall by the end of his molt, but he wasn’t complaining about the current attention that Dean was giving him.
“For the moment. Never know when Ms. or Mr. right might fall into my lap.”
He didn’t want to get dressed and go back out. Lucifer could take care of Abaddon, and nobody expected him to come home, so he was going to take advantage of that and just bask in the soft afterglow of this moment, and at how right and settled he felt.
“You won’t need it.”
“You’ve been?” Surprise colored the other man’s expression for a moment, but not disgust. If anything there was another hint of interest in his face, Castiel relaxed with ease at that.
“Meg, don’t scare off clients. You might be a friend, but that doesn’t mean I won’t boot you,” Dean warned as he moved to head back to his station and clean up.
Dean didn’t leave his side until they were back in the shop. Castiel moved to put things away and set the jars and combs aside so he could tend to them in a little bit.
“Sorta the idea,” Dean admitted. “Want my customers to feel like they’ve stepped into an extension of home,” he explained with no shame at all. “That’s why it’s just me, Charlie, and Benny for now. Hoping to expand of course, one day. Got some feelers out, do events, that sort of thing.”
Dean laughed softly now. “I don’t want the stress of working in a restaurant,” he admitted, then he shrugged one shoulder, their feet playing together now. His green eyes studied Cas a bit more and then he took a breath. “We should talk about where this is going.”
“You’re comfortable?” Dean asked quietly as his eyes swept over him, clearly approving of this.
He was just used to being alone now. Castiel’s home was small and tucked away above the shop he ran. A simple herbal shop to most, but to those who knew what they were looking for – be it comfort, or specific items – it was more. There was a symbol near the door anyone of the sort knew, and a second to designate his place a safe sanctuary for the hurt.
Cas wished it was him, that the man was here working him slow and steady. He was so hard already, he knew he wouldn’t last working himself like this. It was easy to let go, to keep fucking himself, pressing the toy just right so every pass made his skin light up with pleasure as he panted into the pillow, just working it until he couldn’t ignore it. Dean’s name was on his lips as he came, clenching around the toy.
“I trust it’ll be just as fun as this one has been,” he murmured now, finding it so easy to give Dean this control. Just as he’d trusted the man with his back, with putting something so permanent as the tree he was getting tattooed on his skin, it seemed like nothing to let him do this, to let him decide what their dates should be, where they go.
Maybe, Cas had found the right one at last, He’d just have to wait and see if a world of books, ink, and laughter was the right place or not. He let himself sink into kissing Dean, enjoying it. They had a few hours before they had to think about meeting up with Sam at the Roadhouse. He could think of a few ways to enjoy that time before they had to get ready.
Dean just nodded at that and then he finished making up the bacon, setting it to drain and quickly fixing them both a cheese omelette and some toast. Cas couldn’t help just taking the time to admire the other man and the way his hands and arms worked as he was cooking, the smoothness he had.
If Dean was honest, the only thing that had really changed between them was that they were now sharing a bed, and having frankly amazing sex. Oh, and that Dean Winchester became Dean Winchester-Novak. But that was something completely different.
“Ah, thank you.” Castiel couldn’t help a nervous little chuckle. He quietly moved up to Dean now, studying the man’s face with interest. “You look rather good, too,” he admitted now. Dean straightened up and winked at him, and it went right down his spine to curl in his gut. His breath caught in his throat. “So…”
“No, no that’s fine actually. More than fine,” Castiel assured and then he took a slow breath.
It was almost easier this time. He wasn’t anticipating the feel of the needle against his skin as badly as he had when they first started and they seemed to settle right into the work again. Dean made various comments about things happening on the show as Cas started to slip into a relaxed zone in his mind.
“Come for me, Cas. Show me how good you found this.” His voice was low and firm against his ear, an order to let go, and Cas did, crying out raggedly as he  started to come, his fingers digging into Dean’s back, his body curling up into the other man quickly and needing more from him.
“Very understandable. All right, you’ve got a few options. I have Netflix, some DVD’s, or we can just turn on some music.” Dean turned to put the box down but he gestured at a small TV that was angled for someone settled on their stomach in the chair.
Dean felt his cheeks heating further than just what the alcohol that he’d consumed would cause. The instant fear that Cas was going to reject him washed over him. Dean took a breath. “I...I shouldn’t have….This is too…”
“Castiel?” The voice of the man inside of him was not very intrusive, and he continued to show his faith, which was helpful. “You seem troubled.”
Castiel couldn’t help the grin that spread onto his lips now.
“...Cas are you okay?” He asked, his hand resting on the handle to let himself out. Watching the angel closer.
“All right, think you can sit up?” Dean asked now and Cas nodded his head, shifting slowly to ease himself upright and then twisting around to sit properly for the second time that afternoon. He smiled as he saw the artist was holding his shirt in hand. He reached out to accept it and carefully tug it on.
Satisfied, she is met with the acceptable, small shake of the head by Sam so she starts up again, this time taking on a tired, pleading stance. “So being the kind, caring sister that I am, I let him stay the night and you can probably figure out the rest from there. What a nasty shock it must have been for the woman who walked in on us at the break of day.”
“I may... haaave... gottennnnn... a bit carrrrried....awwway.”
“Looks like I’ve got competition,” Prince Dean says in a light-hearted tone, “you can prove yourself to me someday, if you like.”
Finally, with the youth gone, he approaches Anael, fully aware of what may be going on here. Finally, she seems to awaken from her trance and gasps at finding her brother just a few feet away, seemingly having witnessed their departure. Resignedly, she huffs and invites him into her room, knowing that there is no escaping the questioning that is sure yet to come.
“Then let me show you. I would like to ask the Edenish Prince for a dance.”
Time for a time skip!
A moody storm circles above his head, putting him in a frosty mood all throughout the meal, so much so that nearly everybody close enough to know him personally at least notices. Once he got here, everybody sits in perfect replica of the first night, and he’s situated between Anna and Gabriel, but they seem to get the idea pretty quickly and leave him alone. Tonight he has enough to put up with all of the staring eyes, without having to fake a front for everyone, so he’s glad to be sitting close to the most trustworthy people in his life, even if he isn’t up for talking much. He broods in silence as he ponders whether the staring is coming from what they have heard of a few hours ago or just in general. At least he knows for a fact that it can’t be because of his arm, since that’s covered up well with his sleeve, and he can feign the pain to a certain extent. That is until the food arrives and he can’t even pick up the damn knife.
“Look Cas, I’m sorry, alright? I thought Anael had already told you,” Dean’s words are meek and vulnerable, completely exposing the man before him, but Cas just retaliates with harder strikes.
“I do, Sam. The view is very beautiful up here.”
An astute, portly man with a well kept beard is the first to approach them from the vehicle. He almost seems too confident for his slender form, giving Dean the impression that this is simply a false character the man uses to mask his true identity. It’s not long after that a heard of silks and leather accompany the man’s right side, forming a line of immaculate royalty.
“You think I want to hang out with those clowns?”
“Come on little bro, you really think I’m gonna screw up? It’s only a few cups, and besides, I don’t need a babysitter.”
"Well I don't believe in such blind faith in a man who runs on alcohol and pure revenge. I mean, we don’t even know this Chuck guy, and Dad thinks it’s acceptable to let him under our roof?”
The group is eventually strayed away from the captivating artistic view and lead to complete the rest of the tour.
Castiel had always just learned to ignore them as best he can. It was never a real bother to him what other people were saying about him or the Novaks. However, he found his temper harder to control when they involved their mother. Where are the manners? Where is the respect when talking about the dead?
“No worries, and anyway, if you need anything, me and Dean are in the eastern wing, - you know, the big, spiral-y tower? You are welcome to drop by anytime.” Sam pauses, considerate in his behaviours before he starts shaking his head, deciding better against it. He settles for “I hope to get to know you, at least properly, soon.”
Hurriedly, since he already feels bile rising up his throat again, he waves Benny off and whirs down one set of stairs cautious as to not up-heave last night’s dinner when he literally flies into Sammy. If his brother’s long, gangly arms hadn’t stopped and caught his torso in time he would surely be sprawled across the floor carpet right now. Fiddling with one of the tassels on his wrist must have distracted him enough that he hadn’t seen Karma’s lingering shadow on the edge of the hallway as his distracted self must have spiked her interest.
Sam stalks through the halls in search of the princess but to no avail he stumbles around the castle like a lost puppy. Giving up, he goes where his feet lead him, one foot after the other, head hung low and in his own subspace of conscience, lost to his thoughts. Aimlessly, he steps into the throne room when from the corner of the large palace window comes a loud hiss. Confused, Sam lifts his head as curiosity gets the better of him and he goes to investigate. The weird noise comes again, probably from behind the curtain, until he hears the call of his name. He has never heard of talking snakes before, even from the exotic trainers who all those years ago brought in animals on display for the Royal family’s entertainment that Sam had never even heard of. The harsh whisper speaks his name again, but this time commanding him to follow his words.
Castiel quickly averts his gaze and turns back to his sister. He knows that there won’t be anything in his power that he could do to stop the inevitable from happening. But when that does happen, he will promise to be the best big brother to Anael and support her and all of her decisions, so he does the next best thing: “Go get him, tiger.”
my pretty mouth though.”
Anael’s lips purse into a tight line, clearly without a plausible answer. Cas doesn’t think he will much enjoy anything else that comes out of her mouth anyway. Suddenly, Castiel feels sick to the stomach.
“Castiel Novak of Eden you are to tell me what happened right now,” Anna’s simmering rage slowly boils to steaming temperatures once again. “Was it the prince? Because I swear-“
“My apologies, I only thought-“
“Someone’s eager,” Dean states raising his eyebrows, hinting. “Your brother, Michael, and I were just discussing that earlier. Said he knew a whole lot on training up the men properly. He mentioned you too, but exclusively good things, I assure you. Apparently, he believes you will do well since you are his best knight, am I correct?”
A swell of pride fills his lungs as he battles an ache of longing in his chest. He quickly glances over at Sam to see him staring right back, wearing a parallel look of gratitude with something else entirely. Something heavier, Dean guesses, with a much deeper meaning; a look Dean is glad to have shared with Sammy.
It seems as though the nasty morning alarm has set him in a terribly foul mood. Pair that with the annoyingly banging headache and nasty hangover which makes his head swim and stuffs his ears with cotton. He mentally takes note to go visit Rowena the glamorous local herbologist who will surely give him a remedy for the disgusting state he is feeling right now.
As soon as Anna opens the door, he is scolded and ushered inside like the no-so little child that he is. It’s kind of sweet how she cares so much for him, and he wouldn’t mind it if it prevented him from pursuing his plans all the damn time.
“Prince Dean, what are you doing?” Castiel tries again.
“Good evening, Prince Samuel. A little tired is all, so I shall retire to my room if I may.”
The rest of the meal goes pretty quickly. He actually engages in conversation in all attempts to forget about the pain but they fall weak and he has to dismiss himself early. Retiring early means that he can get a head start on training tomorrow at sunrise and maybe even have time to check his nuisance arm up before training starts.
“Well, I’m not dreadfully exciting. I teach theology and biblical mythos at the university,” Castiel said lazily. Most people didn’t know what to say to him after that and Dean didn’t reply right away. Then he felt the odd sensation of the gun against his back, the quick, only slightly painful pricks now as Dean got to work. “I work four days a week, lecture two of those days, and research the others,” he added now, still soft, keeping his breathing steady for the artist.
“Relax, Castiel. I know you don’t go on dates often, but this guy seems safe enough. I’ve looked him up and everything. Also noticed his little brother is an up and comer to keep an eye on,” Gabriel said cheerfully from on the screen. Cas snorted softly now to himself, shaking his head.
“While I am a switch, I do like to take a dominant role in a relationship,” Dean said quietly now, “and I’ve noticed that you do respond well to that.”
The man didn’t try to thrust into his mouth, but his fingers flexed some in encouragement, and Cas let his head bob in response. Somewhat to encourage more, somewhat because he loved the friction. He breathed out hard and then he gave a good swallow and Dean growled audibly. That was a good move, then. He shifted his position forward a bit, allowed his jaw to relax further, and then took a little more. Dean was not so long that he couldn’t comfortably take all of him; it was just something he had fallen out of practice with.
Cas paused blinking a few times to clear his vision, though he couldn’t hide the flush on his cheeks now. It was clear and in the open that Dean had read him correctly, there was no point in hiding it.  He did duck his head just a little.
One Dean Winchester had founded this business, along with the artists Benny Lafitte and Charlie Bradbury. It had been doing well over the last few years it’d been open, and each of the artists’ online portfolios had looked beautiful. Cas was fairly sure that he was going to see if Dean himself could do the piece he wanted. He liked his style, it was natural and the realism of it was just what he wanted.
Castiel quietly sighed and then moved to look at the papers on his desk again. He had enough grading to keep him busy and hopefully not to fixate on the upcoming appointment he had.
“I’m sure I’ll have nights where ’m just as distracted with the shop and tattoo design.”  Dean nodded quietly and then his hand was cupping Cas’s cheek and the professor leaned into it slowly, relaxing at the firm touch. “I want this to work, though, if you do.”
“Fuck no, they are bad enough to share a meal with.” Castiel rolled his eyes and then he leaned in to brush his lips to Dean’s softly again. “However, I would like to get your phone number.”
Castiel liked the little squirrel though, he was very cute and didn’t disrupt his shop during the day. Didn’t dig, seemed content to just curl up and watch him, and occasionally steal some of the stones from the loose bins.
Dean wasn’t very long, and it was just a few minutes before he appeared with a box in his hand. “Hey, Cas.” His eyes were bright with cheer, and a toothy smile showing from his beard. “You ready for this adventure?”
“Oh….Cas..They’re beautiful.” He whispered, his fingers raising up, though he didn’t quite touch them yet. “Can I....”
//Can we go back now?// Dean scampered up to Castiel’s shoulder after he was cleaned off. Castiel simply nodded in agreement before moving to collect his things. He left the spilled honey – the bees would recycle it – but he did scoop the jar up. They started back home. Dean settled down against his neck, half curled against it, like a soft scarf.
That cry was the only warning the Angel got – not that Cas minded, swallowing down every drop. Cas was practically purring as he pulled back, looking up with slow-blinking blue eyes to meet Dean’s hazy own. “Call Sam. I need my wings preened.”
There was a flurry, chitters, bites, slashes with small paws...then the darkness disappeared. There was a smear or two of something on Dean’s fur as the familiar returned to his side.
He felt the first itch days after meeting Dean Winchester face to face. Castiel could admit he ignored it for the first day or two; he was on a mission. His molt hadn’t been due for some time yet, but time moved so differently down here. And people were strange and confusing, leaving him with no idea what he was going to do about it. Molt required privacy, a secure location, and, preferably, the company of a trusted companion.
Castiel imagined that he could hear the man moving around in the shop. He was oddly relieved at how quickly he could be fit in, fairly sure that it was a sign from above he had approval to continue with this daring venture.
“It creeps me out how easily you can say that.” Castiel sighed and then he turned to look at the screen, eyes narrowed. His brother was notoriously open. Gabriel had left their family and never looked back, just made his way into the world and was happy to enjoy sex, life, and everything else that being a rather skillful lawyer allowed him.
“Deannnnn, your appointment is here!” she called out.
“Mm, tonight is about us, Cas.” Dean’s words were soft and he pressed a soft kiss just above his belly button. Castiel’s muscles twitched automatically. “And I am going to wipe all thoughts of her from your mind,” he whispered. “Is that okay?”
For some reason that thought stuck in his mind.
“Damn, Castiel, you drew this yourself? It’s really good, I can see what you want to do with it,” Dean said after a moment or two and he placed the picture carefully aside to grab up a tablet from the workstation next to his stool. “I can make a suggestion or two if you don’t mind, but I promise you this is a peice I would absolutely love to do for you.”
“All right, if you’re all with me now, let’s talk about care, and when we can book your next appointment.” Dean said, his voice still gentle. It was clearly routine and Cas found his instructions simple and easy to follow. A care kit was set out for him to take with him. Throughout it all there was something intensely comforting about how Dean spoke with him.
“....It’s not something that you can help with.” Castiel lifted his head and looked at him, blue eyes, perhaps a little sad.
“Tell Gabriel he can mind his own fucking buisness.” Castiel growled and then he was tugging at Dean. “I have better things to focus on, thank you Sam.”
“I think I’ve already wooed you,” Dean teased lightly as he put some jam on his toast. “I just have to keep feeding you and you’ll stick around.”
His reward was the nudge of a finger, teasing, dipping just barely into him. Cas carefully spread his legs a little more, just a bit. He hoped that Dean wouldn’t see it as too eager, or too forward. Instead ,it seemed the man hummed around him and his finger pushed slowly deeper, letting him savor just how it filled him—not as good as a cock, but promising.
It was simple enough to pull himself into the mind of the vessel and find Jimmy, who was in a replica of his living room and seemed content enough to be there. “Castiel…” He paused and then laughed. “It’s strange to be speaking to you and seeing my own face.”
“It was easier to tell him I was gay than that I was bisexual. At least with bisexuality there is the chance some girl will convince me to be completely straight,” Castiel admitted quietly and then he sighed. Dean just kept working for a while without breaking the silence. There was something easy and comfortable about the quiet between them.
Dean was almost done with the task when the power went out, everything falling dark and quiet. Castiel could hear the swish of the wind and snow outside. He just focused on the feeling of Dean fixing the last few feathers by feel, already so good at it. Then, warm arms slid around him and there was the soft press of lips against the back of his neck.
“Huh?” Castiel was confused, Dean wanted to do something for him? How was any of this really about him? Dean had declared his feelings, had kissed him, but, because he wanted too right? He didn’t understand.
“Please, sir,” Castiel started, and then he paused, wanting to know what Dean would do with it.
“So why the hell aren’t you going back up to heaven and asking one of your angel buddies to….er.. assist?” Dean asked uncertainty now, but his green eyes were faintly curious, despite the way he held himself stiffly.
“My wings need preening,” Cas informed him, and then suddenly his back felt quite cold and Dean groaned in frustration. He turned around and let his eyebrow go up, as Castiel was looking lazily pleased with himself.
“As long as you can put up with my tons of books of weird religious materials and getting lost in my work from time to time,” he joked easily, though it was true that he did do that when he was focused on a task. “I’m in the middle of working on a new paper about the archangels.”
“I’ll get you food—this is more important,” Castiel growled out, his eyes narrowing. “It’s necessary that we go now, before he returns.”
“No reason.” Dean said,  now he’d settled down on a chair with some of the popcorn he’d asked Castiel to get, tossing kernels into his mouth “Can you pick up the pizza I ordered a bit ago?”
“A yes, hmm?” Cas smiled and he moved to get his supplies out, setting up a small bowl, grabbing a white candle, a piece of rose quartz and salt. He smiled quietly as he organized his ingredients. “Yes, Simple cleansing spell I think,” he said quietly. “Then perhaps burning a little incense, if you’d like to pick today’s scent?” he suggested, though he didn’t expect the squirrel to do a thing. He wasn’t bothered if it didn’t.
It was strangely lonely when the human stepped out of the room, the door closing behind him. Castiel started to contemplate what was yet to come. He just hoped that Dean would not become disgusted with him.
“We’re under MIstletoe Cas.” Dean giggled again, harder and Cas felt the bed shifting, the man rolling onto his side. He looked down to find wonderful fingers curling around his tie, yanking him a bit and he moved with it, his eyes searched Dean’s slowly.  “Yanno what that means?”
It was clear his calm reply was surprising to Dean. The man probably hadn’t expected him to reply so willingly. “All right, if I’m ever in need of the same courtesy, mine is Impala,” he returned with a smile. Cas couldn’t stop a grin on his lips at that; he thought it was adorable, and not at all surprising.
“Any time, I’ll see you next week.”
“I wouldn’t let you freeze Dean…” Cas said quietly “I could have flown us home….”
Instead, Cas gathered himself up and he moved to leave. He couldn’t help glancing back though and returning the wave that the pretty redhead, Charlie, he reminded himself, gave. He then stepped outside and took a slow breath—just one more step that he was taking away from his past. One more step into his place in this world.
Dean grinned a little at him. “I love what I do, what can I say.”
The other’s tongue flicked out against his lips now, gentle brushing against his lower lip then between them, with that Cas was lost, his tongue meeting Dean’s lightly and playful, his breath hitching a little bit into the kiss. Slowly their mouths parted but neither pulled back far, heated breaths mixing a little bit.
Cas couldn’t imagine how that could feel. He’d seen subs like that, submissive but demanding in their own ways, wearing on their doms. He hoped that he would never be like that. He didn't want to ever be like that.
“Holy fucking shit.” It sounded almost like a prayer coming from Dean’s lips.
“It is going well, though? You had good reviews,” Castiel pointed out honestly. He’d enjoyed the research of the place and was glad he’d chosen it.
“Dude I’ll give you a pass,” Dean said and he lifted his free hand to make a twirling motion. Blue eyes indulged him, making a full turn around briefly so he could take it in. The boots were right, the jacket was properly embroidered, if only his hair was a few inches longer. Otherwise it was perfect. He couldn’t help wondering a little who this was, the mask they’d chosen hid most any identifying feature of their face except for gorgeous blue eyes and lips he found himself wanting to kiss, the voice wasn’t familiar enough for him to place. “So, friend or foe?” He asked with a little playful wink.
“Hello to you, too,” he said as he moved over to the cat and scratched gently behind an ear, getting a purr in return. “I just had a lovely evening,” he murmured and then he scooped up his lovely white devil cat and settled down to cuddle him. “I think when you meet Dean you will like him, too.”
Once a pair of loose sleep pants were on his hips he slowly flopped down on the bed, easily settling on his side and sighed heavily. Their next date was going to be fantastic. He couldn’t wait.
“I won’t break, sir,” he protested softly now. Dean’s head lifted at that, and his cock felt downright chilled at the lack of heat around it. Castiel forced himself to open his eyes and blink up at the man above him.
“Well have fun, you two. You don’t have to worry about driving; Dean you got a room assignment, right?” she asked eagerly, even in her tispy state wanting to make sure things went smoothly for the event.
Dean seemed amazed with watching him, the man’s hand sliding around to cup his chin and tipped his head up. “Oh, you do like this, don’t you,” he rumbled now, his thumb brushing over Castiel’s lower lip.
He yanked at it some, wishing his hands were instead buried in Dean’s hair. Cas wanted to pull at it, to push, to…
“Yes, sir.”
It was only moments longer before he was fucking himself with the fingers, letting them press just deep enough, and curling them just right only every few thrusts, making his muscles spasm. Cas loved to do this, to tease himself. He loved making sure he was comfortable and well opened before he used a toy. Not that he didn’t like it rough sometimes, but this was different. He wanted his first time with Dean to be different. He wanted to let the man dominate him properly, possibly hold him down. He moaned again as his fingers hit deep once more, making him tremble a little bit at the intensity from brushing right right inside of himself.
“No, no, I’m quite fine,” Castiel promised now and then he rolled his neck and stretched, considering how he felt. “Ready for me to settle back down?”
“I do not wish to destroy this vessel’s clothing when my wings form.” He then blinked a few times. “And yes, molt. Old feathers falling out and new ones growing in. I need assistance with it.”
It did not comfort him in the slightest to be feeling the early stages while inhabiting a vessel of a willing man and all but trapped on earth. He found himself checking almost automatically on Jimmy Novak. The man had little idea what he’d agreed to, really, in accepting an angel into his body, but the man was good and he was honest and he loved his family very much, and his faith was strong.
“But now that you know….”
Surprisingly, when the end of the semester rolled around and he came back from winter break, there was a bottle of his favorite tequila on his bed and a note thanking him for not bringing his various conquests back to the room all semester.
Mentally cursing himself, he allows himself to be nudged out of the room, no longer a welcome presence, before the sweet smile of the innocent girl slams the heavy door closed behind him, contrary to what her fake persona would lead him to believe. Huffing a sigh, he resigns to retreating to bed and hopefully sleeping the day’s events away in his sanctuary, stress already gnawing away at the insides of his skull. He mustn’t afford to worry about little debates like these, for the better to train clear-headed. Hell, he does it all the time because even his own family don’t trust him at all, . But as he sinks under the soft, warm sheets of his bed that night, his dear sister’s truthful words keep him awake until the early hours of the next day, as he replays them over and over again in his mind.
“Wait until you see it from Dean’s room,” the young prince chuckles reminiscently. It doesn’t look as though he regrets skipping the formalities, letting slide a personal, friendly comment to their conversation.  “Glad you like it.”
Yes, they aren’t getting married after a one night stand, but it would certainly be seen as unrighteous if they are caught. So that is the story of Castiel’s life. No wonder Gabriel is surprised he has survived this long, but then again the years have made him rather grumpy and act “with a stick up his ass.”
