“He’s not slowing--” Thor started to say, but then a cut lashed across Steve’s back and Steve screamed, pain wrenching through his body. A flash of gold surrounded them, a burst of energy knocking Thor off his feet.
“Steve,” Tony’s voice, rough and crackling with pain, pulled Steve from his thoughts in an instant. “He’ll be back soon.”
But then - a spark of red in the sky. Falling, always falling, and Steve felt the pressure build, the anger and unrelenting need to
Heat flowed up the back of Steve’s neck, and he pulled away from Tony to sit back on his heels. He wanted to argue but the way Tony was looking at his wings made the words catch in his throat. When Tony finally pulled his gaze away from them, it seemed like a struggle. “Did you know you had wings?”
Tony, so physically powerful. And all because he was mentally incredible. His arms tightened around Tony’s torso, and Tony’s flightpath waivered just a hair. It thrilled Steve that he managed to affect Tony, but he also didn’t want to fly into a skyscraper so he left his wandering hands still, for now.
Steve swallowed hard and heard Tony suck in a breath as he leaned back again. Steve mourned the loss of his warmth, but then the hand was back, sliding down his chest, lulling him back into that magical place of hypersensitive peace.
Steve admitted to himself that it was an obvious failing in his own leadership that they were still deciding if the mission belonged to Steve or Tony, minutes before takeoff. In Steve’s defense, he had claimed the mission first. Tony had just immediately rejected that claim.
When they landed, Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and led them to the penthouse they now shared. As soon as the door closed, he pushed Tony against it, hands running along the armor the way he’d been imagining midair.
Steve didn’t know how long he’d been napping, but the light that kissed his eyelids was softer than when he had first closed them, so it must have been a while. A slight rustle of clothing next to him let him know he hadn’t woken naturally, but the sudden increase in his heart rate meant it was Tony crouching down next to the couch. Steve kept his eyes closed, waiting.
All morning, an idea had been forming, one Steve had hoped to execute with the help of the storage closet in SHIELD medical but now Steve had to change gears. He didn’t particularly like theft or subterfuge, but he was going to have to do at least one to successfully help Tony, and helping Tony seemed to be his top, and only, priority these days.
“Oh sure! That’s all this is. You’re not looking for the lurid details about how the doctor held me down, as Obie stretched me open, too fast and too rough. The way the doctor examined my slick off the glove, how he sniffed it and licked it when Obie crudely offered a taste from the source, is that what you want to hear Steve?”
More than just the Iron Man boots spilled out of thin air, wrapping around his calves and legs. “Like you could.”
He held his breath, wanting to hear news about Tony, but knowing his name wouldn’t be uttered over the airwaves. The omega had been just out of MIT when his parents passed away, any news corporation would think ignoring him was doing the grieving young man a favor. But without the spotlight, darkness had clearly crept into the forgotten corners of Stark Tower and no one seemed to notice or care. Except for Steve.
“Tony,” Steve whispered, unable to hold back, all the horrors compounding and Tony was at the center of it. This would be bad enough, if it was a perfect stranger, an enemy even, but to Tony. To
Their leader reached out a hand, while around him the others bowed a brief hello. “Namjoon,” he said in a way of greeting. “You must be Captain America and Iron Man.”
Tony chuckled behind the glass of his helmet, shuffling forward into Steve's space. "Well, you slept through the moon landing, so it's all got to be a bit startling." He reached out and squeezed Steve's arm just above the elbow. His glove was huge and puffy, but Steve could still feel the grip of his fingers underneath. "I just need to pop up and do some magic with the satellite. I'll be back in a jiffy."
Tony looked towards him but couldn’t quite get his eyes to reach the bed from his position on the sofa. He made an affirmative noise in his throat. “And we--” He shifted, and Steve was about to protest but Tony held out a hand “--I’m fine. We need to make a plan, is all. With Obie.”
Steve ran. If he hadn’t been enhanced, he’d never had made it down the stairs as fast as he did, out into the lobby, even as the front desk guards started screaming at him too. He ran through the doors and kept running until he was halfway back to his apartment.
The memories broke off, perverted and conflated by fantasy and Steve tore his hand away from his cock and rolled over, willing himself to sleep.
“They really don’t teach alphas much at all when it comes to omega sexual health do they?” The pharmacist shook her head.
Without visual input, Steve’s traitor mind immediately supplied the hundreds of things Tony could do with his hand twisted into Steve’s hair. Pull him around wherever he went, shove him to his knees, press him into the couch.
The vibrating on his desk pulled him away from his CFO’s presentation, and Tony let his gaze drop to his phone, heart starting to race even before he got visual confirmation that it was Steve. He flicked the message open and what a visual it was.
Tony secured the knot of his Windsor tie and met his own gaze in the mirror. It was the final piece of his suit, tailored from Steve’s design to hug his shoulders and his ribs until it narrowed at the waist. While beautiful, it was not what required the special design. The pants, on the other hand, appeared fitted but along his upper thigh and between his legs, the seams allowed more room for Steve’s dastardly plans.
“Turn right,” Anthony interrupted. “And please stop. We’re about to see this man, well at least my version of him.”
Steve felt his cheeks heat at the thought, at how wrong it was. Pressing his lips together, he willed the color to fade from his cheeks as he handed Tony the drink. The drink he’d been ordered to make.
“No.” He wanted to arch up and press their lips together, the tease of Tony's barely there kiss almost too tortuous to bear, but it wasn't his move to make.
Tony, of course, felt it and pounced. “What about you big guy?” He ground his hips forward, down, so that their cocks lined beautifully together. Steve had no idea if either of them expected the feel of it, Tony’s bare cock along Steve’s pants covered one, because they both swore and shuddered together.
“No. Researching a private matter. Um--” he should have come up with an alibi but he’d always been quick on his feet. “Stark. Howard. I served with him, or, well, near him.” Steve forced himself to stop rambling. “I was wondering what happened to him. I keep hearing about SI on the news but not…”
murmured into the dip of his spine and goosebumps emanated from the spot, shivering down between his thighs.
“Crap,” Steve reprimanded himself. The man that got on the train next to him shot him a glance but a mumbled swear was next to normal when it came to New York’s subway system. He hadn’t meant to flirt with Tony, though. Yes, he was an attractive omega, Steve wasn’t blind. But he was obviously in need, and what he needed
The next morning, with his mind on Tony, Steve rolled out of bed and into his shower. He knew what he had to do, the plan coming together easily as soon as he’d decided where his priorities lay.
Tony must have noticed the effect he was having on Steve, but he didn’t seem to have any urgency in his explorations. His fingers wandered anywhere they liked, without pattern or rhythm. Occasionally they brushed along his straining erection, but they never showed any inclination to linger there.
“Of this?” Tony stepped on his toes and brushed their lips together, just the faintest of touches but it sparked between them an electricity that shot over his mouth and down to his heart. He knew Tony felt it too because when he stepped back he whispered, “Wow,” into the space between them.
the Jingle Bell Concert, but it certainly mattered to Tony. He looked over at Steve in his peacoat and superserum warmth and had to will himself not to step closer again, this time for his body heat.
“I hope no one kiss--” Tony’s gaze was fixed on Steve’s. “I must’ve knocked my head, because I’m seeing an angel in place of a tightly wound super soldier.”
“You as well,” Tony found himself saying, even if he had no idea who these pop stars were twenty fours ago outside of recognizing a few of their ear worm choruses after Clint had played him their latest album in the common room.
They were intoxicating, able to drive Steve wild with a single touch. His hands dragged up their sides, holding them closer to him; the evidence of their matching arousals against his thighs took his breath away. He pulled back from the kiss with a gasp, growling under his breath, “You don’t have to ‘guess’ anything. You two are
Tony shook his head and tried to keep his awe at bay. “Thank you for the tour,” he said, trying to sound natural.
Steve quirked a smile, stepping towards the couch. Steve watched for any sign of Tony tensing or flinching back from his scent or closeness, but neither happened. Tony looked thoroughly exhausted, strips of bandages wrapping along his back, tan skin tinged with bruising dotted throughout. Steve wanted to touch him, almost reaching out to, but then he realized Tony’s back wasn’t moving up and down in a steady rhythm. He was holding his breath. Steve stepped back, towards the door. “Sure,” he replied, unable to keep the soft affection from his tone and not really wanting to. “I’ll bring you all the cheeseburgers.”
Tony’s cheeks lit up with tingles that spread to his forehead and chin. It took a second for the sensation to clear, and he knew by Steve’s reaction when he wore his own face again.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Oh, come off it. Trust me, okay. I know how important this man is--” Steve pressed his lips together and dropped his gaze away from the two Starks. Tony turned back to Anthony. “And, let’s be real here. We both know this isn’t our decision at all.”
A warm weight under Steve’s arm shifted closer, back fitting against Steve’s chest and waist dragging against Steve’s hips. His body reacted, blood beginning to flow south and brain ticking to life--
Stane’s spat at Steve. “So you’re the man--the alpha--that thought he could take what’s mine right out from under me.” Shifting his weight, Stane crossed his arms over his chest. “Well let me tell you, kid, you messed with the wrong--”
Tony looked around the entryway of the hut. Inside, it looked like any other recreational room. There was a desk and office in the far end by the doorway Steve had walked through that presumably led to showers and a locker room. “Why doesn’t he spell himself clean?” Tony asked as he walked over to hanging sports equipment - brooms, different sized balls.
Every so often Tony would rub his hand up and down Steve’s thigh, his fingertips ghosting into the sensitive skin between his legs. The soprano sung, while Steve squirmed. He’d known what the toy was when Tony had offered it to him, but hadn’t thought about how one might feel inside him.
He couldn’t stop staring at the chain, and so many thoughts flooded his mind. Tony holding the handle of the briefcase, pulling Steve along at his leisure. Bound. As long as Tony held the briefcase, he’d have Steve near. Wanted.
“You sure do compliment him behind his back a lot.” Tony let the comment hang in the air for a moment, watched as it flushed Steve’s cheeks.
The more Tony saw him lose control over himself, the stronger Steve’s control over Tony became. He wanted nothing more than to give in to Steve’s command.
Steve’s rhythm sped up. Tony’s head banged painfully against the wall again, and he closed his eyes, losing himself in the exquisite pleasure of being Steve’s plaything. His own erection strained, forgotten, in his pants, his hands clasped impossibly tight around the dog tags, terrified that if he dropped them by mistake, Steve would stop, leaving him bereft.
Their heaving breaths echoed in the sleep capsule, and Steve kept his hand around them long after they’d stopped coming. It was Tony who moved first, some talented stretching and foot grabbing to bring his pajama pants up to their hands without hitting his head or moving much at all. Then Tony rolled onto his side as much as he could with Steve flat on his back and handed it to Steve after wiping himself with it first. When Steve finished, Tony cuddled back up to his side and Steve wrapped his arm around him and pulled him close. Pressed together like this, there was plenty of room in the sleep capsule. More than comfortable, Steve fell asleep easily.
instructor--pressed his lips together. Tony knew that expression, even if it was clear Anthony did not: Steve was jealous.
“Sir, we need to go.” It was the first words he heard from the younger man, whispered under his breath and aimed to the floor. The alpha gritted his teeth, but still kept his gaze on Steve. Down the street, the noon bells began to chime, ultimately breaking their standoff.
The gemstone hovered, floating next to them as they flew back over the forest towards the castle and the hut. Tony wondered if he was imagining the heat that radiated from the stone, the hum so like the ring. There was a connection between the stone and this world, like there had been between the ring and Tony’s. He wanted to tinker, just like he’d wanted to do back in his workshop, but more than anything he wanted to return home. To Steve.
“Why must you ask that?” Steve had groaned. Tony just winked at him, pressed a brief kiss to his lips and sashayed his way to the elevator.
One of the rows of shelves to their left had a box with a lid half opened, photographs spilling out. “I bet there’s some great baby photos of a tiny-Tony here.”
“He’s catching on pretty quick, won’t be too long until he’s saying words,” Bruce comments. Peter looks over to him when he speaks and watches his mouth.
As admiring as Steve is from his ability to survive in arctic ice for nearly 70 years, be a successful subject of a superhuman enhancement process, and a suitable captain for the Avengers Initiative, the man often did questionable things; like right now, for an example. The married couple is considered to be one of the richest couples in the world and is living in the heart of New York City so they have plenty of well-suited orphanages to visit or choose from. Ones that are definitely better kept than the one they are about to enter.
The next morning it’s evident that the couple didn’t get as much rest as the others. Natasha cracks a joke as Steve is a usually chipper man in the mornings and his current behavior is very out of character. Bruce takes initiative by feeding the baby some mashed fruits and the two eat their own makeshift breakfast: toaster waffles.
They had gone through the easy part when it was time for Peter to get his shots. Peter was not pleased when he first saw the sharp needles. The boy was curious about the needle, not knowing what its purpose was. Steve lightly held Peter’s arm still for the doctor. When the doctor proceeded to administer the needles into his skin, Peter’s mood instantly soured. As expected, the baby cried from the pain of a few shots, but Tony and Steve didn’t want to risk the chance of Peter getting sick. The doctor returns for a few finals words with the parents. Peter, on the verge of tears again, starts to crawl away or he tries to in Steve’s iron grip.
“Well, Peter does not cry as much as other kids. It is not too uncommon with orphans but it is a little hard because when he is hungry or he wants something, he does not get the attention of anyone else. Some parents find it off-putting,” she explains.
“Tony, do you think that’s okay?” Steve asks. He has faith in Tony but there are a few inventions and machines that aren’t as safe as they were supposed to be. Just ask any one of the unfortunate S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that volunteered to be lab rats for Tony’s experiments.
He follows through with his offer and goes to Peter’s room. He leaves the baby’s room with a lot of toys and a fuzzy red blanket. He bumps into Thor on his way back. It isn’t surprising since somehow you almost run into everyone about four times a day in the large building. The god looks at all the small toys and deduces that they are for Peter.
“Who is it?” he asks the AI. At first, speaking to the robot was weird and uncomfortable but over time, Steve adjusted to it. Their interactions became more plentiful and Steve communicates with J.A.R.V.I.S. as if he is just another person living in the house with them.
“We are here to adopt,” Steve quickly adds, getting to the point of their visit. As much as the woman is being pleasant, Steve would feel much better when he has their son in his arms.
The car ride does not take long and they arrive at their home but not without complications. As soon as Peter was placed in his car seat, he became upset. He didn’t cry or scream but made it extremely difficult for Steve to buckle him into the car seat. The wiggling baby made it harder for Steve to make sure he was strapped in correctly as he was just barely grasping how the seat worked. The baby had thrown or dropped his toy and whined an awful lot. Tony specifically chose a route that was longer to calm Peter. The quiet hum of the vehicle and smooth motions did the trick. By the time the car stopped in front of the tall and futuristic building, Peter was yawning and sleepy. The baby is, thankfully, less grumpy when taken out of the car.
Exhausted and slightly out-of-breath, Steve blinked blankly at the man who stood in front of him, trying to figure out of Clint was really there or if Steve's wound had finally gotten the better of him.
But Coulson wasn’t everyone, and Coulson knew Steve Rogers’ reputation as much as Captain America’s. “We have a recording that puts you by that table in R&D on the day of the theft.”
Tony sat in front of Steve, on the lid of their hotel room toilet. Steve’s sweater was fisted in his hands.
Steve nodded, moved back and let Tony lead them to the elevator. He pressed the button not for the lobby but for the crew floor--the kitchens. “They aren’t--”
Coulson answered his own question in the asking of it, but neither of them acknowledged it. “I hope you find what you're looking for Agent Coulson.”
Tony continued through the Manhattan Project remnants, and Steve followed him over to a table where medals, awards, ribbons and plaques covered the entire surface. “Mother put this together for him.” Tony chuckled. “Father would’ve let it collect dust on the floor somewhere.” After a moment he turned to walk towards another cluster of objects, letting his hand drag along the edge of the table.
Steve's lap, covered in those damn khakis of his. The image featured a good amount of his thighs, spread open just a tease, with the hand not holding the camera gripping his inner thigh. Tony loved Steve’s hands, big and strong, able to wrap around Tony with ease. Tony could feel that grip along his own inner thigh, teasing up to drag talented fingers lightly against his balls.
Steve let out a shaky breath and let himself ease in Tony’s hold. His hands were smaller than Steve’s but managed to be everywhere at once along his stomach. Steve wanted them to wander higher, or lower, or wherever Tony wanted to touch, he just didn’t want him to stop. In the small confines of their capsule they were pressed so close together there was actually room on either side. But it still didn’t seem close enough. “Don’t stop,” Steve replied.
Stane appeared to have other plans, he grabbed Tony’s wrists before they made it to his neck, and sneered. “Unruly whore. Bet you let him do whatever he wanted with your slut holes. This room reeks of everything you two did together. It’s well within my rights to--”
“Ah- Tony, your mouth is so hot. You take my cock so well. So filthy.” Steve squeezed the base of his dick once, then ran his thumb along the corner of Tony’s mouth, spreading spit down his chin. The hand traveled back up to Tony’s hair and gripped tight. Tony jerked his head back against the wall, thrilling in the pull of those clever fingers. “I could use you all day, choking on my cock, whatever I want.”
“Hey, hey.” Tony’s hands tightened on his shoulders. “I get it. And, hey! Technically you did tell me.” He leaned in again, pulling Steve into a kiss and his head was spinning from it all, the revelation, their first kiss, the way Tony fit so perfectly in his arms. It was terribly hard to pull back, but he needed Tony to know, to understand. “I really am sorry,” he whispered against his lips.
“Shh,” Steve whispered into the darkened room. He heard the unbuckling of pants, and he rubbed his legs against the sheets as he waited for Steve, relishing the cool stain on his naked thighs and hardening cock. The mattress shifted again, and Steve walked around to the side of the bed, cock in hand, then positioned it in front of Tony's mouth. “Open for me.”
Steve startled when Tony’s arm slipped around his waist. The easy affection was new and he tried not to focus on how much he enjoyed it, unsure if he was reading too much into the casual gesture.
Steve nodded, thinking. He needed to do something in the immediate. He wanted to strike multiple punching bags to a pulp first but he couldn’t waste the time; he needed to do something productive, something to help Tony. Steve stood and Tony craned his neck to see him. “I’ll go get supplies and run by SHIELD, see if they have any intel on Stane.”
“Tony!” his Steve shouted, pulling at the sheets. “You’re British!” Everyone but his Steve chuckled, he just sent Tony a confused expression. “Am I still dreaming?”
“Right.” Steve said, running a hand through his hair and Tony did the same, feeling far more flustered than he should from a simple conversation. But with Steve, it seemed nothing was simple. After they both nodded, Steve did the knock and the door slid open.
He’d pulled it out of thin air as a distraction, thankfully he was a genius who could manage the ramp up.
“Just this last bit and you’ll be ready.” A pause and shuffle then a lube covered plug teased at his rim. “Spread wider,” he ordered, voice low and determined. “Still loose from last night. Good for you, considering…” The tip pressed inside without much more warning.
Together they assembled, the two stragglers continuing some joke that apparently had started in the car, laughing and shoving each other even as they continued to look like they’d fallen out of the latest Vogue catalogue.
Knowing all of this, Steve followed Tony’s pull until he was on his back, facing the curved capsule ceiling, then Tony’s face, now hanging in between him and the ceiling. Steve wanted to close his eyes again, hide from the prying and the obvious questions that painted Tony’s expression. But Steve knew a few notable facts: he was stuck in the middle of outer space with this man for months and, more importantly, the itch under his skin had blossomed into a full blown heat, fixated on the mere proximity of Tony. And the sensation only seemed to be growing. So he kept his eyes open, caught Tony’s gaze and met it dead on. “We are very close together, physically. The effect is…. surprising, and because of that I was momentarily shaken. It’s not the first time I’ve felt this way about a fellow teammate, I know how to handle it. I won’t let my...reactions interfere with our mission or team dynamics.” He nodded resolutely then curled back on his side, away from Tony.
“Yes!” Tony snapped his fingers, pushing away from the entryway to walk around what appeared to be a classroom, with rows of desks facing a large one at the front end of the room. “Woke up against a tree. Definitely, maybe, passed out? Wizard of Oz style, that’s always an option. But no--”
Steve froze under the harsh abuse, momentarily overcome by how quickly and fiercely Stane tried to bring Tony down. But next to him, it was as if Tony came to life. A roared, “No,” ripped from his lungs and he surged forward, hands outstretched. “You’re wrong, Obie!” he shouted right into the man's face. “You know
“We should.” Tony’s hand hit the box of chocolate at his side and Tony reached for a piece, holding it up for Steve. Warmth from Steve’s lips wrapped around his fingers, cutting off the chill of the wind.
It was a message for Steve, it had to be. The fine, fixed handwriting--it was Ana, leaving him a location. She was always the one to tell Steve where Tony was on their Wednesdays.
“Yeah. Thanks for entertaining and distracting me. I bet you’d beat the heck out of the real Captain America in chess.”
They stood there for a moment, each probably more focused on the omega upstairs in a Board Meeting than what was happening in the kitchen, but then a pot of food hissed and Steve broke away. “I should go. If Stane--”
“Probably the fact that a line cook is now walking around with tech that should not, on the record, exist yet,” Tony chimed in.
The whimper that left his body made him grateful Tony had stayed in the hallway; the thought of Tony made his feet start moving. He rushed to the closet and continued his mission.
It was only when he floated past the first rooftop that he realized he was flying. He caught his reflection in a building window across the street and saw the truth of it, even if he couldn’t believe it: there were wings sprouting from his back, large white expanses of feathers shifting in the wind to support his weight. It all happened in a moment and then he focused back on Tony, Tony who was starting to get worryingly close to the ground. From there, instinct won over, pushing away all of Steve’s questions. It had to be the serum, some unexpected consequence that hadn’t manifested until this all-consuming need rushed through his body to save Tony.
“You’re a menace,” Steve mumbled as Tony slid onto the bench next to him, accompanying his teasing with an elbow to the ribs. Steve was unable to hold back a smile even as he covered the nymph with his arm. It looked too much like Tony. But the way the man’s eyes flickered to the page made him wonder if Tony had seen anyway.
Steve crossed his arms and remembered when they were half their size, when Tony would’ve towered over him. “Maybe. A little. But that doesn’t explain all this.” Steve gestured to the camera in Tony's hands.
This time, it wasn’t the sight of him yelling into a cell phone on the sidewalk, it wasn’t the way he snapped at Tony or radiated anger and aggression. It was his acrid scent, enraged and determined, reeking a line straight through the hotel lobby.
Tony snorted and surprisingly didn’t break out into another ramble. He did keep flicking Steve assessing gazes out of the corner of his eye, but neither of them commented on it. The fact of the matter remained, Steve had been staring at Tony Stark because he looked soft and--his gut clenched at the thought--adorable, rambling in the slightly oversized pajama set.
It was a shuffle of white and black, the dark night and the bright life dispersed throughout the city.
Steve wanted him here, at his desk and at his mercy. Teasing Tony all day, it was easy to recall the pleasure darkening Steve’s blue eyes, how fierce he looked when he ordered Tony around. His cock twitched in the ring, and he purposely shifted his weight so the plug would move inside him. He could get off like this, if he really tried hard enough, focusing on Steve’s order, his control over him, how his lovebites were so familiar after nearly a decade together that he could feel the ghost of Steve’s lips running down his neck. But it was all a tease. Steve loved to build him up. Loved to leave him hanging, too.
“I didn’t need the ‘Previously on’ portion of the meeting, but your concern is noted.” Tony sent the board member a smirk and he volleyed another insult back. It was their usual repartee and it helped Tony sink into the meeting.
Tony may've been asking him a follow-up question, or inquiring as to why he was staring at Tony's half naked body, but it didn't matter because before Steve could think it through, he sputtered out a a flimsy excuse, more random consonants than actual words, and walked out the room.
Anthony swung his gaze from Tony to Steve. “You’re going to help him,” he spat. “Because that’s what you do.”
Laughing, Steve threw a piece of chocolate at Bucky, whose reflexes allowed him to catch it in his mouth without a second glance.
The world disappeared; Tony was safe here, in the curve of Steve’s body, surrounded by nothing but him.
The clock in the corner of the monitor rolled over to 9:04 and Tony pressed the "Join Meeting" button.
“I’m talented. Anyway yes we will be rolling out the newest model next year, third quarter and it will be more than ready. We may even be able to bump it up--” all the other members of the call expressed their delight and Tony was able to settle back, the focus switching back to the numbers guy after Tony’s announcement.
The reactor was heavier than Steve expected. A thick, braided cable ran from its base into the casing cut deep in Tony’s chest. Steve cradled the device, intensely aware of the power he held in his hands. His heart pounded so loudly he was sure Tony could hear it. He wanted Tony to hear and know the effect he had on him.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Tony whispered, and the mood shifted between them with only a handful of words.
Steve closed the laptop; he knew everything it’d tell him about Tony Stark, knew more even...except. The SHIELD file on the Stark Family contained the most information on Howard. He was a founder, a former acquaintance of Steve. It had the least on Maria, a bit on Mr. Jarvis, and then there was Tony. He’d memorized the file like he memorized anything else he turned his eidetic memory to, but that photograph of a twenty one year old, recently orphaned Tony looked absolutely nothing like the weak and withering man he’d seen on the street. His cheeks had hollowed out, his skin turned a muted beige, with purple, sunken eyes. The bruises…
Steve bucked his hips up, in part because he wanted to see Tony’s reaction and also because now that he knew how good they felt together he needed more.
As he reached the near end of the pool, Tony stopped and pushed himself out, water freely flowing down his body and over the elastic waist of his too-tight bathing suit that was nothing more than a tiny, thigh hugging, second skin. “Hey!” Tony greeted him with a smile “I must have lost track of time.”
The sensations eased after a moment, then sped up at random, sometimes coming from just the ring gripping the base of his cock, sending tremors up through his shaft, and other times coming from the plug, stretching him so wide, so open for Steve that he could just walk up here and slide it right out, a perfect hole for Steve to slide right into. His hips jerked behind the podium, and no one could see, no one except Steve. The sensations abruptly stopped, and Tony bit back a whimper.
He’d never been to the ninety-first floor before--it was part of the private residence, Steve knew that much. He swallowed and crushed the post-it in his fist. A barrage of thoughts ran through his mind: Had Tony done it? Had he confronted Stane, even though he told Steve he’d wait, that he’d let Steve be there? It was Tony’s fight, but they'd agreed Tony wouldn't go alone to confront his horrific excuse of a bondmate. Steve’s mouth soured at the word, reminding Steve of Tony’s scent when he was distressed.
He whispered a spell and a small cut appeared, like it had over the false-shield. Tony held his breath as he watched the single bead of blood, his last chance, as it fell through the air until its
Closing their hotel room door behind them was like an echo of their alone-ness. They’d been by themselves dozens of times, but for some reason it felt different outside the shadow of the tower.
Minutes crawled on without anything. He was hard and aching in the pants Steve designed for him, the ones that showed nothing to anyone else. Only Steve knew, Steve who sat in the front seat with his legs spread, and Tony could see now, his hard cock pressing against the inseam. His hand was still there too, running up and down his hard, thick cock through his pants. Tony’s mouth watered, wanting. His body clenched around the plug, remembering the feel of Steve in him, just last night. His body wanted more, but all Steve seemed to want was to keep him on edge.
Reading the name made Steve’s jaw clench. It seared into his memory in bolded, angry red. His mind provided a loop of the man gripping Tony’s throat. In his mind, he stepped forward. In his mind, he pulled the man’s arm away or he got in between them both, or he ripped his hand straight off his wrist. Steve could do it, the serum had given him the ability.
Facing away from Tony, Steve squeezed his eyes hard and tried not to focus on the muscular corners and soft edges of Tony’s chest and stomach. His arms pressed into the sides of Steve’s back, a smaller frame that would fit so well in Steve’s hold if he were to turn around.
Next Wednesday came by slowly after that. He was sent on a weekend warrior mission into the jungle, a simple drop and grab of alien technology that somehow got into the wrong person's hands. Steve barely got a scratch on him, which was good because the entire time he was in uniform he stressed about what he was going to tell Tony. About Captain America, about the suppressants, about what he thought about sometimes late at night but knew he had no right to say.
“Very good, Tony.” Then he pushed Tony back so his ass dragged along the seat and he saw stars, the vibrator pressing even deeper. By the time he recovered, Steve had his pants unbuttoned and was pulling out Tony’s swollen cock. The first drag of Steve’s tongue around the tip almost had Tony believing he’d be able to last. But then Steve sucked down long and hard, so that Tony hit the back of his throat. His hips jolted, shifting the plug along his prostate and then Steve swallowed around his cock, muscles constricting and Tony was done for. His hips raised into Steve’s hands, cock pulsing as Tony fell over the edge, shivering with each wave of pleasure that rippled from his prostate to the tip of his cock.
Suddenly, unease churned his stomach, and he froze with a violent, startling realization: he was stalking Tony. The thought of knocking on these doors, of following his nose to the one that smelled the most like Tony and testing the knob, it made his blood run cold. As much as he wanted to see Tony again, he didn’t want to violate his privacy, insert himself in the young man’s life unasked.
Tony turned so he was walking backwards, sending Steve a devastatingly shy smile, one he hadn’t ever seen before. This was important to him, and he wanted Steve to like it. Steve’s heart  clenched along with his stomach.
The elevator doors opened, and Steve hated the sour scent that assaulted his nose, spiked with fear and soiled humanity, but it proved that Tony was still in fact alive.
Steve felt cold inside; he wanted to rip down every shelf, pull the pages out of each book, burn it to the ground. He took a deep breath, but it was too full of too many scents to do anything to calm him. “What does that mean?”
“This is incredible, thank you for sharing it with me.” Steve didn’t much like war memorabilia, but he liked that Tony wanted to share it with him.
Steve didn’t like violence for violence sake but it was that thought that finally lulled him to sleep.
When he finally pulled back, it wasn’t far, unable to get more than a few inches over Steve. His eyes were dark and his chest heaving; he sent Steve a sly smile that went straight to his cock. “Here I thought my devilish good looks could stop anyone, at any time.”
The meeting started to come to a close, and there were no more messages, no more vibrations, just his work day and the fading fantasies Steve’s photo had elicited.
An unsteady breath broke between his lips and he gave in for just a moment, pressing his palm into his lap. His hips jerked to meet the pressure, and he knew he could come through the ring, knew that if he kept it up that was where he was going to end up.
They finished in twenty minutes. The distraction did nothing to eradicate the phantom feel of Tony in his arms that morning. When he’d still been under the haze of sleep Steve had tugged Tony close because he’d felt so warm, there in his hold. Behind the helmet, Steve knew there was a wild head of curly brown hair. Steve had felt tickling at his nose as he nuzzled in the strands. The cold hard lines of the armor hid the lithe legs that had run along his own in the artificial morning light of the dormitory capsule.
“Hey!” Somehow Tony had moved without him noticing, tugged on his hand, not letting go. “You don’t have to run away. I’m not mad. About any of it.” Tony scented the air, a small sniff but an intentional one. Steve’s scent gland throbbed and he had to bite his lip against a moan. Their hands were still clasped together and Tony looked at him from under his impossible lashes and smiled, private and vulnerable. “I like it,” he whispered. “I like you.”
Steve cleared his throat and pasted on a smile, trying to mask his frustration. “You know me-- getting used to this machine.”
Tony had taken control of the fight in the end. He’d flown right into the brunt of it, repulsors lighting up the sky, but Steve’s imagination had to provide the rest, because Steve had turned to throw his shield towards three aliens about to intercept Tony’s path. Then he was knocked off his feet, as Tony shot the core of the alien’s weapon with a single shot.
Steve’s stomach churned and he hunched against his apartment door as soon as he closed it, feeling a physical pain from everything that had transpired. He needed to get back in that building. Again. He was right back where he started, only this time he was on Stark Tower’s radar.
The alarms blared overhead, alerting everyone on the launch pad that time was running out. Steve pushed Tony towards the exit door but Tony was ready for it, the Iron Man boot materializing on his foot and fixing him into place. They glared at one another.
Tony sighed. “Wonderful.” He blinked long and heavy once, twice. “I’ll make sure to be conscious for them.”
Tony pulls out his high tech phone. Sure enough, a small list of stories that Peter should be able to slightly comprehend was picked out and set aside on a folder. The parents take turns reading from the story’s digital pages. Peter looks up and sucks on a pacifier watching holographic images of cartoon pages fly by. When they exit, a sleepy Peter listens as J.A.R.V.I.S. begins to play soothing classical music.
“You know I don’t like being handed things,” Tony muses half-heartedly but accepts the small baby into his arms anyway. The billionaire briefly considers if the boy’s size is too small but dismisses the thought.
Tony opens the door to the back seat of the car, tosses the box inside, and moves for Steve to place Peter in the car seat that they bought beforehand. Actually, Natasha bought it with Clint when the two had heard they were going to adopt and bring the baby home today. In fact, when each of their fellow superhero teammates had heard of the final decision of adoption they promised to offer a gift of sorts. The nerdy scientist, Bruce, bought clothes that could be easily returned if sizes were incorrect; Clint, an archer with a love for the color purple, had said he knew a great place for toys and could cut a deal; the Russian assassin, Natasha, had promised to buy a few bottles and pacifiers when she learned that no one had thought to buy some; and Thor the God of Thunder was going to bring a weapon from Asgard but had been talked out of it. Either way, the god promised to bring something worthy for the boy when he was of an appropriate age to accept the gift, whatever it may be.
In the short window of time, the team was given, they finish just when J.A.R.V.I.S. states that the woman is waiting on the ground floor lobby; a few minutes later than expected. Steve is ultimately the one to go down with Tony. Since Tony is the owner of the building, the woman has to talk to him and Steve follows because not only are they married but the super soldier is the only one to promise that Tony would not treat the woman rudely. After all, first impressions need to be pleasant.
Sandra, on the other hand, seems a little less enthusiastic about this part of her job. She walks over to briefly thrust Peter into Tony’s arms before taking several steps away from the couple and glare with hateful eyes. The billionaire’s arms twitch in the confrontation of accepting Peter or fighting back with words and exaggerated hand gestures. Of course, Tony held his son with care but that didn’t stop the feeling akin to hate that stemmed from how rude that woman was in
Without any place to lay Peter down, Steve continues to hold him in his left arm as he formally shook Fury’s hand and then Maria’s. He shows them to a seat by him on the comfortable yet modern furniture.
J.A.R.V.I.S. alerts them plenty of times that night when Peter awakes or starts crying; sometimes it’s both. The couple takes turns in assessing the fussy baby. Sometimes the problems can be solved in half an hour and sometimes it takes the full hour and then some to put Peter back to sleep. When Tony’s turn came around for what felt like the tenth time, he just couldn’t seem to leave the room without the baby resuming his cries. It was like Peter was addicted to the feeling of being surrounded by people. In a tired and fed up attitude, he decides to bring Peter to his room. Steve awoke after being shaken and he understands that the baby would have to sleep with them tonight. Peter stays in the middle of the bed with pillows around him to keep the adults from accidentally rolling on him in the night. But both parents are way too alert at night to accidentally do something as traumatizing as that. The rest of the night, the three sleep without much complication.
Steve gently holds the bottle for Peter to drink from as they sit in the living room. The amount of the drink slowly going down and the audible sound from Peter are indications of him sucking from the bottle. The tiny hands curl around the bottle and one even curls around a few of Steve's fingers. The soldier settles with placing the empty bottle on the coffee table beside the couch and looks over Peter when he finishes with his meal.
“Will this not scare him?” Bruce quietly interjects when he spots Natasha take Peter, and the group, to one of the large couches nearby. He stands quite a few inches lower than the other but the two don’t mind the difference.
“Welcome,” she proclaims cheerfully as the two walk closer to the desk. Her bright emerald eyes open a little more as there is a hint of recognition in her head. “Wait, are you Iron Man?”
Peter has to get his shots for obvious reasons but the couple also wanted their son to get a checkup. Their caseworker had said Peter was healthy but it never hurts to double check. When the doctor walked in, the man clarifies that Peter is in a perfectly healthy condition. The couple, at first, had some questions for Peter’s doctor concerning how they planned on raising a child. The doctor was patient and kind, ensuring the superhero couple that they would do well and Peter would turn out just fine.
“Yeah, what did old Scarface have to say?” Clint adds. He comes in behind Natasha with a half-eaten banana. He wears a very similar outfit to Natasha but with dark purple leggings instead.
“Here, let’s go. By the way, my name is Heather,” she offers while starting to walk deeper into the building. The three exchange handshakes and the couple trail slowly behind.
“Yeah, yeah, it’s okay.” Tony waves a hand to hush the already overprotective man -- soon to be a father.
“So, I see the rumors were true,” Fury muses with his deep voice as he watches Steve hold Peter before looking at the steamers left up from last night. Steve nods along.
Natasha smiles and stands next to the much older man to hold the baby. Steve hands him over and starts to head towards the elevator, the quickest way to get to bedrooms. He pauses before stepping in.
They stand at the end of the sidewalk before a few concrete stairs that lead to an old building. Tony is dressed head to toe in expensive yet casual attire for the occasion. His outfit in dark gray tones matches his black, greasy hair and metallic eyes. A rusted metal plaque bolted on the wall to the right states that the building is an orphanage established some time back. The billionaire is, of course, skeptical about coming to the building with his husband who is standing to his left completely confident and dressed as though he is just another person on the street; blue jeans and a shirt that just barely fit of his muscular build. His outfit selected carefully that morning to make him blend in and to not stand out, unlike his counterpart.
Natasha then holds and compares the baby’s hand to her own. A gentle pain pricks her chest when she remembers that she can never have a child that is
The next morning Steve wakes up early. With not much to do at 7 o'clock in the morning, he goes to check on Peter. Even though J.A.R.V.I.S. did not notify them during the night about Peter, the baby surely needs to be attended to. So, while his husband slept -- his body sprawled out over the large bed they shared -- Steve takes care of Peter. The boy is awake and sucking on a pacifier that must have been left in the bed for him. Steve picks the quiet boy up and brings him to the changing station tucked away in the corner of the room. From there, he changes Peter’s soiled diaper and wipes him clean. He brings the boy with him to the kitchen to warm up another bottle as breakfast when the task is over and done with. He briefly wonders if Peter could handle any form of solid foods but decides against it since he is clearly too small for it.
“That’ll be okay,” Tony answers quickly with a chill to his voice despite secretly freaking out about holding a baby. It’s like holding parts of machinery except a baby is just a little lighter and can’t be dropped a dozen times without consequences.
“I promise to you that Tony and I will always be there to defend Earth, no matter the circumstances. If you have anything else you wish to add then say so now or leave,” Steve warns; his voice rising slowly with each word. Fury detects his tread on thin ice and realizes that he’s overstayed his welcome. He stands to leave and Maria does the same.
“Yes, we know.” Steve is the one who answers. He and Tony had done extensive research when they had seriously considered adopting. The number of hours that Tony had spent climbing out of bed in the middle of the night to fervently search the internet for even the glimmer of hope in a family was countless.
His first trip to the doctor wasn’t the best but a friendly nurse tried her best to make it up. She gave the boy a brightly colored green sucker. Peter immediately stops crying and takes the sucker.
“About four months,” Steve answers. The super soldier has to admit, although he didn’t want a baby shower, he is very grateful for his friends’ effort.
“And there is nothing wrong with that, but you should know that having a kid isn’t the smartest move to make at the moment. The controversy and threats are too great, not to mention the complications of working if you have a kid with you.” Fury emphasizes by gesturing to the baby. The baby just looks to Fury and back to his father, sensing the hostility in the air.
“You really think we wouldn’t do something,” Pepper says with a smug grin. Her pink dusted cheeks are pulled back with dimples as her pearly white teeth shine through. Behind the beautiful woman, a group of their close friends is around with drinks -- most likely champagne -- in their hands. Decorations are strung all around the room with little aesthetic or effort to them.
The flash from a camera in the corner of Steve’s eye pulls his attention to look up where he sees Natasha smiling beside Clint. She holds a camera pointed directly at them. The picture barely affects the baby and he continues to play around in the wrappings. Steve pulls at the paper some more and eventually Peter is able to successfully rip it enough to reveal a stuffed animal; a tiny brown teddy bear. Peter squeals in delight and holds the toy close to his body. Steve smiles and goes to pull the tag from the bear’s ear but the baby moves away from his hand the best he can so that Steve can’t reach his toy. Steve retracts his arm so he can properly observe Peter’s offended gaze.
“Do you guys want to hold him?” Tony proposes, secretly wanting to get away from the group that has swarmed him. As much as he hates to say it, the billionaire wants a drink. Big events with lots of social people have that effect on him. He blames it as a coping mechanism to deal with all the fake and snooty parts of being rich and powerful. His therapist called it being alcoholic. But he’s over that now, or else he wouldn’t have Peter.
As the evening draws closer to bedtime, Steve and Tony decide to give Peter a bath. It isn’t as hard as they thought it would be. Nonetheless, the couple gets extremely wet. Peter finds water rather amusing and wants to share his love with his parents. He seems to like his bath at first but as it goes on longer, it becomes evident he wants to be out.
The couple trail after Heather again for a final time to her tall desk in the lobby. Steve takes the papers and the two began working on it together while sharing a small writing space provided by the tables. All together, it doesn’t take too long and in an hour the paperwork is done, signed, and officiated. Everything else can be done at a later time or by someone working under Tony.
“Blah,” Peter coos. This grabs the attention of the billionaire. Looking down he can see Pepper make similar nonsense noises and exaggerated expressions for the boy,
Clint hums and starts to engage with the baby more. They barely acknowledge Steve who passes through to the kitchen with a disheveled Tony grumbling about coffee and possibly liquor. He barely registers the others but it is particularly fine since the two on the couch returns the same amount of care.
The speed of the car decreases slightly and the world beyond the tinted windows comes into focus instead of just blurs and colors. The appearance of the sleek car attracts the attention of some. The vehicle practically screams money to the people of a rather poor, residential area. Taking a turn, the driver switches the blinker on as he slows down more effectively and parks on the side of the street. He pauses for a moment; a jittery feeling in the tips of his fingers and toes has him slightly uneasy. The sound of the man’s partner closing the door pulls his attention back to the present time.
Steve notices how her height drops. It isn’t, however, that surprising since she was sitting on an unseen chair at level with her standing desk. That and Steve is used to being taller than a lot of other people.
Tony and Steve take their time to look around and observe each child as Heather takes a more relaxed role in locating their baby out of the rest. Little names are drawn carefully in thin, black calligraphy on each of the headboards of the cribs. Names of varying origins given to the tiny yet abandoned human beings. All of the children are fast asleep and cuddling their toys or blankets for comfort; almost all of them.
It isn’t until later into the afternoon, about 4 o'clock, that Tony and Bruce came through the elevator, back from working in the lab. Natasha glances through the large windows, seeing the sun’s position and looks back at the pair.
In their bed, Tony complains about how simple and dumb the children’s story is. Steve argues that it is a children’s story and nothing more, it is supposed to be simple. Tony let it be at that but says that they should start reading Peter something a bit more advanced. Steve jokes and asks him if he wishes to read scholarly articles for their baby. Tony gives him a serious look.
When Steve disappears, Clint moves next to his friend and teammate to clearly observe the baby. Up close, Clint can see how the couple fell for Peter the moment they saw him.
To say that the Tower was a mess would be an accurate description. Tony had refused to pay for or hire any maids when he started designing the official Iron Man suit. His reasoning is for a matter of security. That and with the amount of those living in the building, they should be able to clean up the messes they make themselves. But, the ‘house’ is big and requires a lot of time and effort. Decorations are still up in hard to reach places since they were not taken any other day. It took creative measures to be quick and effective.
“Yes. I know you’ll be a great father,” Steve Rogers responds. The man’s golden hair lights up in the sun and eyes as blue as the ocean practically melts the other’s heart once more. A lopsided smile gives Tony the mental image of a golden retriever.
“Only 12% of it,” Pepper retorts. The blonde haired woman instantly turns her attention to the baby in his arms.
Steve inspects the contents of the envelope when they leave. Inside is a registration form for S.H.I.E.L.D. The extremely secret branch of the American government is known for being very skeptical of the people they accept. It’s not a job that can be earned with ease. The unfiled paper is top secret on its own.
“But there’s nothing she can do to stop you. After all, Peter is yours.” Heather gives another one of her typical, friendly smiles and starts to type into the computer again. The noise from the keyboard gives off an oddly satisfying sound. Tony nods along with it. It is rather soothing for some unknown reason.
. The quaint smile on her lips falters. Becoming an effective assassin comes with consequences. She’ll never be able to have children of her own.
“So, you’ve decided to raise a baby in the Avengers Tower.” Her voice is already strained and mundane. Her opinions are of something close to skepticism. Tony’s feelings are mutual of her but he does a better job of concealing it. Steve glares at Tony for a millisecond to make sure he curbs his attitude with the person who could make the decision to take away their new son.
the baby over. Luckily, Steve aids him by taking Peter quickly with a less than pleased expression on his face but he holds the baby in a gentle grasp that contradicts the soldier's emotions.
There is one baby still awake, squirming around quietly in his bed. His name is painted above in cursive with a gentle pastel blue covering the entirety crib. Steve gets Tony’s attention right away and the men share a long look with the baby who returns it by watching with curious golden eyes and a small tuft of brown hair adorning his crown. Small hands reach up and try to grab at them as a reaction to the attention he receives. Heather walks over and gives a little smile as she picks up the small boy and takes him out of the room. The couple follows her because they have finally found their son.
. Tony finally manages to step out of the elevator with more help from Steve than he’d care to admit. Tony takes only a few more steps again before he’s flocked by mainly female friends entranced by the charm of the baby.
“Fine,” the woman scoffs in return before swiftly making a turn to leave. Her heels sending reverberations down the hall as she leaves. Steve questions how someone working in with children could be so rude.
“Sir, there are people in the lobby requesting to speak with you,” J.A.R.V.I.S. spoke, interrupting the flow of Steve’s early morning thoughts.
When the party officially ends for the team, Tony feeds Peter a bottle of baby formula. The baby falls asleep rather quickly with his new toy held tightly in his tiny arms. Before everyone went to bed, Steve takes the opportunity to ask around in order to discover who gave Peter the toy but no one claimed it. The tag has no clear name or company; not even a barcode or purchase tag. Steve and Tony find no trouble with the mysterious toy and allows for their son to keep it. Peter’s sleeping form is then placed in his new crib surrounded by other stuffed animals. The small baby lays there at peace. Tony has J.A.R.V.I.S. play soft, gentle music for the boy and makes sure to have the AI keep an eye, or scanner, on Peter while the couple heads off to their own room to sleep.
“Okay, I found it. Seems you are all set up to take Peter home. I believe that right now the babies are taking naps. We can still get him for you two though, but you have to be quiet,” she notes as she types into the computer some more before standing.
The baby makes no noise when he is moved to another’s arms. The billionaire tries to take initiative in arousing the baby similar to Steve, as of to not be shown up, by pulling out a small object from his pocket and giving it to Peter. Steve, just barely grasping the purpose of his husband’s inventions, briefly questions if it’s safe for the baby to have. Regardless, Peter takes the object into his little hands and begins to chew on it without hesitation.
Heather comes back and views Tony holding Peter. “Well, Peter ate so he’s probably too awake to take a nap. That happens sometimes. I’ll take Peter to Sandra. She’ll get him ready and you guys can do the last bit of paperwork in the lobby. Then you can take him home today.”
When the teddy bear that Peter was carrying around all morning fell, he picks it up and hands it back to the baby cradled in his arms. He wonders what Fury wants and if he should wake up the others. While Clint and Nat almost always wake up early, like himself, to train or just spend the day doing something productive, the rest are not as prone to the early hours as them. Bruce likes to keep to himself and Thor had demanded that when he stays at the Tower to never be disturbed from his slumber unless it is important. Tony is pretty much indifferent due to his already abnormal sleep schedule, but Steve likes to spoil his husband with late mornings and breakfast in bed.
Natasha’s eyes light up after hearing Tony’s offer. It is slightly concerning for him to see since the last time Natasha gave him that look, he hadn’t been able to use his left hand for a week.
The couple can hear a quiet chatter radiating from each colorful door they pass when going through the large doors that lead to the back rooms that hold the majority of the children. Steve smiles sadly, wishing he could adopt all of them or at least make sure they got the families they deserve. Tony makes a mental note to offer more donations and funds for not just this orphanage but for the rest in the city, or maybe ones all over the country. They take the stairs -- the building is too old to have an elevator installed as Heather mentions -- to the second floor and it’s much quieter than the first.
“What was that about, Cap?” Natasha asks as she steps into the living room from the kitchen, an apple in her hand as if for aesthetic. The color of its skin matching the hair she’s thrown into a ponytail. She uses her other hand to wipe lingering sweat from her forehead and brow. The soldier assumes she was training. Her outfit of a black t-shirt and shorts helps with his theory.
The clicking of keys bounces around the room as she gathers and searches for the correct information. Her mouse joins the symphony of noises with more clicks as she moves it around on a pad.
“All I know is that his parents are probably dead. Tony said he would look into it,” Natasha answers while looking down at the boy. She is very glad that Peter isn’t a fussy or a shy, skittish baby.
From the moment they step in, Tony and Steve can tell the atmosphere is very different from initial thoughts. Not only is the temperature warmer inside the building than the early spring bite of outside, but the aged look has no visual effect on the interior. The first, spacious room is a large and open lobby littered with modern decor. Plain black sofas and armchairs set out in perfect angles accompanied with knee-height tables holding slightly outdated magazines to pass the time. A T.V. placed high on the wall plays the news at a quiet volume. Steve briefly catches the sight of Tony on a cover of one of the magazines looking as handsome as always but decides not to bring it up.
The party made its way later into the night. The moon had peaked out in a quarter of its full glory accompanied with twinkling little stars. Quite a few of their friends left to resume their normal lives. Of the ones who stayed were Bruce, Clint, Natasha, Thor, Steve, and Tony which are also the same people who live in the building. By that time, everyone decides they should open the presents left for Peter. The baby watches with wide eyes and his mouth in a little ‘o’ from the floor as the gifts are placed in a pile before him. Steve grabs one of the smaller wrapped presents and encourages Peter to open it with him. The small hands try to grab at the slippery paper to the best of their capabilities. The baby’s face contorts from all the effort. Steve chuckles and helps by pulling off the clear tape and ripping the light blue wrapping paper to offer up traction and grip. This doesn’t help but it keeps Peter entertained.
A young and pretty receptionist waits just behind a simple desk not too far away from the door for the convenience of newcomers. The woman’s blonde hair is held tightly in a ponytail that curls at her mid back, swaying in time with her bobbing head. Her eyes light up when the two enter. She smiles brightly and straightens her back. The curve she creates looks almost painful and her loose curls mimic her movements in waves.
Clint empties his armful of toys on the ground and Natasha lays Peter on his stomach after she sets down the blanket. The trio keeps him entertained by gaining his interest in several of his new toys. Thor awkwardly maneuvers around Peter. It is clear to see that the much stronger god is exercising restraint with the weaker baby. Natasha laughs at how the man acts. To push upon their relationship more, Natasha gently places the baby in Thor’s arms. He frantically looks to his partners who laugh even more as he holds the baby in his rigid arms. Natasha even takes it upon herself to take a few pictures to capture the precious moment before she complies and lays Peter on his stomach again.
An older woman arrives quicker than expected. The woman’s dark brown hair cut neatly to her shoulders and straightened so well that it didn’t look natural. In her arms is the baby. He isn’t moving or squirming around anymore, much to the woman’s delight. Peter is still dressed in footie pajamas but it’s different than the other. This outfit bears more designs of cute, cartoon dinosaurs and of better quality. The baby’s chubby face is emotionless as always but when he’s brought closer to the couple, a tiny smile forms due to recognition.
The next day is just as early. It’s always early for Peter but more so for the rest of the team. Tony picks out an outfit for Peter and Steve manages to fit the snug clothing over the wiggling baby. The small family makes their way to their private clinic. Steve waits anxiously with Tony and Peter in a childish painted room.
Tony shrugs and grabs a not-so-healthy snack from one of the kitchen’s many pantries before heading off into the training room.
“Adorable,” Natasha comments as she walks over to see the baby too. The natural saunter of her body makes her seem dangerous and sensual. The striking red hair curling at her shoulders adding to her natural flair.
“He’s probably hungry. I’ll ask Sandra,” she mumbles to herself, just barely heard by Steve’s heightened hearing. “There are a few things that need to be done before you can take him home, you know that right?”
The couple knew that today would be perfect upon checking the news. The well-dressed man had pointed to the map of northeastern America, zoning in on the region of New York in particular.  He declared the weather for the day and the rest of the week to be sunny skies with only a slight chill still hanging in the air. People can be spotted on the cracked sidewalks as they drive. Some are bundled in long, trendy coats with matching hats and scarves.  Those who are bolder wear t-shirts and shorts.
“Yep, that’s me.” Tony returns the smile with a cocky half smirk that he did not mean to do until he caught himself afterward. In truth, Tony is not in the mood for chit-chatting with a fan. He shoots a quick glance to Steve for help.
Thanks to Steve’s hidden cooking talent, breakfast is cooked quickly and is being served at their large table when Thor and Bruce leave their rooms. Peter is kept in Steve’s arms since he can’t eat extremely solid foods like the rest of them. The friends sit at breakfast talk and enjoy each other’s company, also thanking Steve for the breakfast. Steve then notices how intently Peter is looking at him. When the two hold eye contact, he can see how Peter’s eyes go a little wider and he listens as Peter makes a noise with his mouth. Steve doesn’t exactly understand but he smiles anyway. That seems to cheer Peter on ever more and continues to make nonsense noises.
“Well, that’s something to look into later,” Tony mutters to himself. Knowing that Peter is going to be in their possession, he will most definitely do some research of his own or have Natasha do it when he gets back to the Avenger’s Tower, or home. Steve looks over at his husband with curiosity and wonders what the hero would find if he were to look into Peter’s past.
“Why’s that?” Clint uses one of his fingers to poke and tickle the boy’s belly. Peter giggles and laughs in response. Pure belly laughs making Clint smile happily.
J.A.R.V.I.S. later announces to the team of the eventual arrival of an agent from Social Services. They would be arriving in two hours. He also reminds them of doctor appointments Peter has tomorrow, all set up by yours truly. Completely forgetting the meeting initially, the Avengers leave Peter in a little swing adorned with bright colors, lights, sounds, and toys while they run around the huge building to clean it.
“Well, how many kids do you have here?” Steve asks to fill the brief silence and to start some small talk. From his childhood days, Steve remembers playing with the other orphans but he never really knew how many children were housed.
“Alright, alright. It’s yours.” Steve laughs and grabs another present. He lightly shakes the present to get Peter’s attention but it doesn’t stick. Peter is too involved in his toy to care about anything else. Steve just pulls him into his lap and begins to open the other presents, slowly eliminating the pile over time. Many of the gifts are clothes that Steve admits to being absolutely adorable and can’t wait to see them on Peter. Besides outfits, there are shoes, superhero-themed toys, and bottles but nothing is better received than the teddy bear.
“Well, I have to wake up Tony and make breakfast. Do you want to watch Peter for a while?” Steve suggests.
to be asleep,” she apologizes as she looks the little boy over. The baby shows no signs of struggles or protest. In fact, to Tony, the baby looks pretty content; not happy or sad, just content.
Steve holds out his large hand above the baby and twirls the calloused fingers around to amuse Peter when he gets comfortable holding him. This works to amuse the baby since Peter opens his eyes fully and starts to make more attempts to grab at the soldier’s fingers. Peter brings the captured fingers to his mouth to suck and chew on them when he is successful. Steve stifles a laugh and resists the urge to pull away from the drooling mouth when the weird, wet feeling makes its way to his senses. Tony continues to watch with great amusement and looks up to see Steve’s face. The soldier looks so happy and pleased. Tony feels his heart pulse in a loving response to his cheery husband. A sense of longing and rash decisions meets the billionaire’s mind.
Thanks to Steve’s strength, he holds Peter tightly as he struggles to get to the billionaire for the unintentional chew toy. Tony notices his desperate attempts and rewards him by handing the object back to Peter. The baby coos happily, returning to a more calmed state with the object in his mouth. Heather smiles to herself and the memorable clicking of heels signal Sandra’s return. Still not pleased when she meets the couple again, the woman takes her hostility out by pushing a box right into Tony’s chest. He has no option but to take it. He holds the box with his fists clenching tightly, glaring at her as she leaves once more.
“No, that’s all, but I am a little upset that you didn’t invite me to the baby shower. I even got the kid a little something,” Fury says while walking back to the elevator, a smirk definitely on his lips. Steve gives him a dubious look.
To everyone’s surprise, Bruce did very well with handling Peter. Steve was quick to ask if he could take Peter off his hands when the little boy began to grab and pull Bruce’s glasses off his face but the scientist just laughed it off. No one had expected the man to be so patient; especially when he turned into an unstoppable and invulnerable hulk when angry. Peter is then passed on to Thor again and the god still expressed his anxiety. That is until Peter started to pull at his golden strands. Thor felt no pain and found it extremely amusing. This only encouraged Peter to pull harder and Clint took the baby to not continue bad habits since there is a long-haired woman that would
“You want me to get some toys and a blanket from his room,” Clint suggests while he watches Natasha place him on the couch beside her.
“I honestly saw no danger in this. I made sure that no one other than the people in this room has knowledge of the party. Besides, sir, I believe this is good for you,” the A.I. responds with its disembodied voice in the form of a British accent. Tony just gives a slightly defeated sigh and pretends to be angrier than he is.
It felt weird to Steve to think such a thing. From today on, he would be a father. He had never really thought of anyone to raise a family with. When he was a young man, he had only thought of the second Great War. The first woman Steve had ever loved was clear to express her idea of work before relationships. Now he had Stark.
Now that they have reached the door, Steve’s hand makes its way to Tony’s shoulder as he holds it with loving affection and support. Tony places one of his own hands over Steve’s and squeezes it tightly while he lets out a shaky breath. They both turn forward and stare down the door with a sense of newfound inspiration. The only obstacle in their path is a dark brown wooden door with a knob made of brass in desperate need of shining.
Tony grins and plucks the little metal object from Peter’s weak grip and hands the baby back to the young woman.
place. Though the man never stated his reason for doing so aloud, Tony is fairly certain Steve used to come here before he went under the ice. The building is rather old and surprisingly stands a few stories tall with a slight lean, most likely due to the instability of the entire foundation. The wood paneling has aged a great deal and is in need of a new coat of paint or replacements. It wouldn't be a stretch to guess the connections with the super soldier from WWII since Steve had lived near this part of the city and was alive around the time it was established.
It’s a bittersweet feeling for Tony as he watches his husband hold the baby. His mind wondering what kind of neglect could have led to the poor boy’s silence. How long did he have to cry to realize no one would come to his aid?
“Indeed you did.” Fury chuckles lightly. “Then you do remember how dangerous it is to have a baby, especially in the Avengers Initiative Headquarters.”
J.A.R.V.I.S., the AI computer system hooked up to the entire house, greets them as Tony enters the building with Peter in his arms. The little boy had practically forgotten the toy from before and left it for Tony to pocket it once more. Steve carries the box this time around with little effort and they ride the elevator to the main floor a.k.a. the living room or the party room. As they step out of the elevator, Tony and Steve freeze.
“Maybe, but he did just give me this for Peter.” Steve holds up the manila folder for the pair to see. The assassins are smart enough to realize what its purpose is. The special ink stamp of the branch is a dead giveaway. They return a look of astonishment to Steve.
“Uh, yeah. You can help Nat and me with Peter for today. It’ll be good for him to get to know you,” Clint says. He heads for the living room with Thor beside him.
“Steve, do you really think he’s… the one?” Tony looks to the frozen form of his husband and then back down at the baby. Peter, noticing the lack of movement in the fingers, stares at the two with his beautiful eyes.
Steve lightly grabs for Tony’s hand under the desk and away from the view of the receptionist. Tony can tell almost instantly that the taller and usually sturdier man is slightly upset. He wonders if her dream job was to try her hardest in providing children with homes or if this is just a way to make ends meet. Either way, Tony won’t ask for fear of being too personal and intrusive.
Natasha finishes her plate and walks over to the sink to rinse most of the sticky residue from it. When she puts her plate in the dishwasher, she looks over at the table and glares at the rest of the people sitting there. All of them had finished and look up expecting her to take their plates as well. She ignores them and walks over to Steve, the only one that has not finished eating his meal.
“There is a little under fifty here currently,” she responds with more professionalism than seen before by the couple. “Most of them are kids under the age of 10 and we do not have any over the age of 16. The older kids usually go to foster houses or other orphanages.”
Steve and Tony finish quickly and dress him in new pajamas. They take Peter to his room, conjoined their own, and attempt to put him to sleep. However, Peter does not go straight to sleep as they want him to. Even with his teddy bear, Peter does not stop stirring in his crib.
“Sandra,” Heather warns with a pinched expression and tight voice. “Can you get Peter’s box, please?”
Peter couldn't care less about the other woman. He had long since traced his attention back to Steve -- one whose large body covered most of his vision. Steve looks like a giant and while Peter can’t comprehend a lot, the little one is sure that he has never seen someone quite like him. The tiny hands pull at the man’s shirt to get his attention. When he doesn’t receive it, the baby looks over to see Tony not that far away. He then sets out on a new mission to search for the same metal object from before.
Steve nods and awkwardly holds out his arms to carry their very soon-to-be son. Heather complies with a small giggle and carefully hands Peter over. The soldier supports the fragile neck and cradles the baby’s body close to his muscular chest as he was instructed during the classes he took with the rest of the Avengers to ensure everyone knew how to take care of a baby.
“Yes, as you know, Peter was discovered all alone. The police conducted an investigation but without finding any relatives, he was placed in our orphanage. They found his home but nearly everything was gone or taken as evidence. Some of the possessions that were not taken were given to us for Peter when he grew up or was adopted,” Heather informs with a more solemn attitude. Grim reality settling in on the boy’s past.
The Avengers do their most important work that needs to be completed. Some shower and others spar together or work on major projects while they still can until J.A.R.V.I.S. alerts them of Peter waking. Steve is the first to get up to grab the boy. He has Tony take the baby from his arms in the living room and goes to make another warm bottle from baby formula. When Peter finishes that bottle, the cumulative group each takes turns holding him.
The couple looked to her at the end of the day with hopeful eyes. She sighs and tells them of her rating. The house is in suitable condition for Peter. No immediate dangers whatsoever. They celebrate after she leaves by ordering several pizzas from a nearby place. Peter just giggles and babbles the entire time.
Some close friends also discovered their plans through the grapevine and offered to buy something too. Most of them encouraged the idea that the couple should throw a baby shower but Tony shot down that idea. A party for their adopted child most likely meant that there had been a lot of planning for the event. The media would be present just to make headlines and get coverage while all types of celebrities that don’t even care for Tony would show just for the public image. The whole ordeal that should be special and personal would turn into a silly charade. The superhero couple decided that a baby shower wasn’t something that they really needed.
