"You tell me, detective." The last word was said nonchalant and superciliously.
The detective was surprised.  It didn’t happen often.  It made him uncomfortable.  Of course he had locked the knob—absurd as it had been to lock the last memories he had of John’s body, mouth, and kisses from his mind’s eye—but he had deduced that the intruder would have left the doors open.  Making a disgruntled grunt, he knocked on his own bathroom door and waited.
His body required sustenance and there was take out left in the fridge that would be sufficient. The door to the safe room latched behind him and he took two steps towards the kitchen until he became immediately aware that they were not alone in the house.
There was a hefty woman, in her mid-forties, near a table in the back, itching to smoke even though she was quit, who looked like she was about to give in to temptation, and there was a young pock faced teen who was obviously ditching his curfew to work on his fake profile on a hook-up site, away from the prying eyes of his parents.  They did not fit the profile he had put together either.  His calculating gaze moved to the woman seated by the large bank of windows at the front of the store, as the bell for the door signaled John's approach—but the she was gone.
The incredulous look wasn’t lost on Sherlock, yet he was distinctly aware that John wasn’t entirely convinced of the current opportunities afforded to them through the unique mind-link they shared. Pivoting to his left he snatched up the perfectly balanced rapier that appeared as if by magic. Without hesitation, the thin steel sword was lunged forward, the pointed tip sinking the cleanly through John’s torso. The movement was swift, decisive, and John stood frozen.  His hands had only risen half-way into a defensive position before the blade had pierced him with a strange detached pain, akin to being pinched.
The detective went then to his bedroom and undressed, tossing the ruined shirt into the waste basket.  When he was dressed he went to the kitchen, still adamantly avoiding the bathroom, and soaked a dish towel in warm water, mopping at the dried blood around his collar bone and neck.  When he was cleaned the wound sufficiently enough he threw on another dress shirt and did the collar straight up.  Having all the buttons done up made him feel slightly squeezed about the neck, possible swelling of the muscles from the trauma.  It didn’t matter.  He threw on his coat and tied the scarf in place, before leaving the flat.
The younger vampire managed to swallow his sarcastic response and instead shot a more pertinent pair of question at his maker, “Why are you here?! What exactly are you planning to do with Sherlock?”
This one was unlike the previous two to come before it.  The speed with which these little clues were being dropped before him, obvious bread crumbs leading to a dangerously sweetened trap, was increasing rapidly.  It had not even been two weeks since the drug mule in the alleyway, yet it seemed somehow unintentional—as though the brain behind this scheme was no longer intensely calculating his next move.  This had all the hallmarks of an act of opportunity.  Well, it certainly had piqued the detective’s interest.
“No.  Please,” John found himself croak, he tried to reach for the creature, but his body was slow to respond to his command, his hand lifting only weakly.  “I want more.”
“It’s not her! It’s not Mary!” John snarled to the voice. To Sherlock.
“No need, Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock concluded, receiving a warm smile of understanding from the woman before she welcomed his return and bade both gentlemen good night.
“No, poor thing was feeling a little—drained by that point.” Lestat grinned at himself. “He didn’t offer an introduction, rather rudely he just showed up. He didn’t look like much. I’ve handled far worse than he appeared but the black eyes were a little over dramatic.”
Sherlock’s fingers were cool as they absorbed the heat from John’s own beneath them. His lazy gaze admired the site of his hand on the other man’s and he squeezed a little, unconsciously, to lock the sensation in his mind. "If not for the effects of the alcohol lowering my inhibitions than perhaps I would never have gotten the courage to express my feelings."
John was loyal and strongly empathetic, almost to the point of weakness.  Perhaps it was the interplay between these two redeeming qualities of the man's personality that was resulting in this betwixting scenario.  The splash in the bath after his injury had not been the last of their shared sexual adventures together, it had been only a small part of the beginning.  John had not expected nor had he been prepared for Sherlock to grapple him into that sudden change in their relationship, but the man was all heart.  The satisfactory experience in the tub being one of the major factors for accepting the change that the detective had so blithely rushed into proposing, albeit from a loosened sense of himself due to the administered anesthetic, even if it was against what John had originally considered his sexual orientation.
“Came as soon as I could, Mrs. Hudson.” He said.  It was an automated response that years of Scotland Yard had trained him to regurgitate at the sight of tears and the sound of sniffling.
and the glass vase was also dated.  There was the slight variation in the wooden table’s surface just visible around the circular base of the glass vase that was indicative of a water stain.  He lifted the vase to assess the mark further, quickly noting that the stain did not match the circumference of the vase present.
Icy blue eyes rolled and Lestat all but yawned, before he volleyed back, with a flippant gesture and a disgusted scoff, “Oh, please!  Don’t play the victim, John, it doesn’t suit you.”  He leaned forward again, a hand raised to his chest, as he casually explained, “You know who I am by now, I’m sure Louis left nothing out, and I have been given the right by the natural law.  You should be thanking me.”  Then the hand left his chest and gestured at his newest fledgling, with a wicked grin stretching his lips, “I just turned you from a little fish, into a bigger fish.”
The doctor swore again and then snatched back at the curtain that Sherlock refused to release, managing to cover himself somewhat.  “Piss off, I’m busy.”
How was John changed, for that matter?  Where was John?  What day was it?  How long had John been gone…All of these questions flooded his mind, plugging in the bottle neck the morphine had created on his system, causing a back up that seemed to stall all progress.  This was infuriatingly useless.  He would get no where like this.  Perhaps there was a reason why the morphine had been provided, beyond his own need for a painkiller.  Lestat was up to something.  Why else would he leave him alone?
“I will not have you pity me through the manipulations of Armand.” The words were heavy and pained leaving his lips.  His hand stung and his chest ached. “You really never did want me here and I will not suffer watching you be puppeted along, all the while tsking at how pathetic I am in being an honest monster.”
Sherlock? Why isn't he here?" The question had sprung from John’s lips quickly.
There was a brief silence and then a swift response.  “I’m afraid I am unable to oblige this request.”
When Lestrade had received a ‘yes’ to his pub invite from John for the first time in months, he had arrived to find a new man with a brilliant woman at his side.  They had been happy and giddy in one another’s company.  John was amiable and his warm smile had returned, even though it seemed to only be for Mary.  The three of them shared a grand time together and Lestrade thought that just maybe John had finally made it through and had moved on.  They had met together a couple more times, once for John’s birthday, another to watch the game, and all of them came with an ease that the inspector had relished.
He had been laying in a prone position on the café floor when the puffin girl had nicked him from the Starbucks and here, as the scene blinked from one to the other, he was upright. He could feel his feet touching down, with all the rough shock of a sudden short drop—that sensation that twitches you awake from a fall in your dream—and she was standing before him, her eyes still closed. In that split second of transition, with her eyes closed, her auburn lashes fanning across her pale skin, he could see a bright white light bleeding from around the edges of her lashes, as though her eyes were not glowing, but burning white with a light that needed to escape. The thin skin of her eyelid was translucent with its brilliance and just as he had noticed it, wishing to analyze it, it was gone. His feet were on the ground and her eyes were open, her hand letting go of the lapels of his jacket.
John settled himself on the younger man’s hips and drew the silk shirt along his still stretched arms to bunch at Sherlock’s wrists and held it there for a moment. His eyes narrowed at the makeshift binding it made while he debated on using that to secure the genius’s hands. With a slow shake of his head, he finished tugging the cloth off. It would be far too easy for the man to get out of John decided and tossed the shirt over the side of the bed.
“Calm down, John,” the man pleaded—no more diplomacy—this was an earnest plea for reason.  His hands were raised in surrender, showing good intention.  “It would be wise for you to stop resisting and heed what I have to say.”
Like the true childish deviant that Lestat was he renamed the contact at the head of the list, sending it far below his own with the new name ‘RepugnantArmand’.  He noted that Benji followed on the list, then Cybil.  He found his own contact and skillfully sent it to the top of the list by adding the word ‘AMAZING’ in all capitals before his name. He stifled a wicked cackle, as the thin pale finger scrolled down through the remaining list now beneath himself and he stopped when he saw ‘John Watson’. He had not noticed it before.  Curious, he opened the text message history and read the last message.
“You know I do,” Sherlock’s voice was strained, breaths coming in short ragged bursts. His chest heaved while fingers clenched tightly around blond locks. His muscles strained as he found himself torn between trying to force John’s mouth on him and allowing the pace the other man set.
Immediately John looked down, letting the guy get an eyeful of his wig. “J-” He paused with a wince. “Jean.” He couldn’t believe he was going along with that ridiculous name or the idiotic plan. This had to be the worst one that the genius had ever come up with.
David nodded his affirmation.  His golden irises flickered, as they passed under the illuminated street lamps, terribly beautiful and fierce at the same time.  Then the significance of this fact hit Mycroft.  “Which also means that the organization is aware that they had members who have defected to this radical faction.”
The detective didn't respond to the scathing accusation.  There seemed no reason to argue his point further, here in this place.  Instead he returned to his own more immediate concerns.  "If you ingest blood, as sustenance, than are you limited to only feeding on humans?  What about mammalian or reptilian? Does the flavor change between species? Between ethnicity?"
Sherlock cocked his head slightly to the right, forcing his attention back to their conversation. “I haven’t figured that part out yet.” He admitted.
The vampire rose off of the mattress and dressed. Louis always slept in his clothes. He said it made no difference, but it was just one more of those mortal tendencies that the John was having trouble negating. The other vampire also wore the same things, almost it seemed to the point of worn through. Their immortal bodies were hardened and did not flow with regular human excretions of any kind. This was probably one of the most convenient things about a damned life that was also the most unnerving.
There was a curl at the corner of the full lipped mouth that seemed rather satirical on the creature’s face.  He shrugged, it looked heavy.  “Perhaps redemption,” Louis said.  His voice sounded forlorn and melancholy, as though this was a conversation that the creature must have had with himself many times, without resolve.  Those ethereal eyes caught his, and he added, “or possibly forgiveness.”
Sherlock sucked him hard and deep as his finger breached through the outer ring of muscle. John cried out again, his hips thrusting into that delicious heat. Slowly the single digit worked its way past the second ring of muscles. He found himself trying to shift to get more comfortable, his inner muscles clenching around the foreign feel of Sherlock’s finger, but all thought was lost once more when the man’s mouth slid down the length of his cock and swallowed him to the hilt.
Yet what had happened in the alleyway?  Sherlock had been skirting around his inquiries deftly, always choosing to redirect instead of answer.  Surely that implied that he was hiding something.  Sherlock groaned a heavy sigh, as he rubbed both his temples with his gloved hands, and rudely blustered at the doctor, "Out with it, John.  Watching you think is dreadfully painful."
“Ah, now sunshine, how are you feeling?” The nasal voice barely registered in the ears of the immortal, his head pounding as he fought the impending blackness of unconsciousness. The voice continued to talk.
John leaned down over him, as the detectives brows came together over his intense eyes that calculatingly scanned the small section of alley-floor.  The doctor searched as well and felt stupid beside his friend, as he leaned back none the wiser.  He couldn't see anything.  It was dark and the cement was just as black and dirty as everything else was in the alley.  "Are you sure that’s where the body was...?" he asked, only to be cut off with brusque wave of a black gloved hand, which called for silence.
John rolled over onto his side, cradling his head on the pillow, hoping that if he pressed its softness against his temples that it might in some way dull the splitting pain.  As his body moved over the sheets, his mind slowly registered the slippery soft feeling of the silken sheets that wrapped him, the plushness of the duvet that he had cocooned himself within.  This wasn’t his bed.
The thought plucked from his mind with little effort Armand made the offer, proffering his own more simple residence, whose confines were filled to the brim with books, of which Armand had collected conscious of Louis’ love for the written word.  It was his vice.  An offer which Louis could not ignore.
With a low growl of possession, he pulled his mouth away and withdrew his fingers. In a lightning quick motion, he settled himself against the curve of Sherlock’s ass, pressing lightly against his entrance. Mine, the thought filled his mind again. He bowed his head to catch Sherlock’s gasping mouth in a deep bruising kiss and slowly pushed forward, breaching his lover until they were finally one.
“It says, ‘Out on a case with Sherlock, if you were worried.  Not sure when we will be back.’” She read aloud.  He could hear the paper in her hands.  “And then he signed it, just ‘John’.  I don’t know what to make of it.  I thought that the post card was strange but this is…well, just odd, is what it is.
John didn’t let her utter the name.  He cut her off with a derisive interjection, “I am not going out.”
"Why all this?" Sherlock asked, he needed to stall for time to find someway out of this inescapable predicament.
The doctor was as porcelain white as the other two, his short cropped hair was an unreal golden luster, and his eyes were crisp and bright, the shift between the dark slate and the caramel brown centers was intensely lit, as though somehow illuminated from behind.  His face was a twisted snarl, intermittently covered by shameful hands that otherwise clawed at the vampire that held him back.  His face was smeared with crimson.  It stained his tongue and teeth, his lips and his chin, but it also seemed to be under his eyes, falling as though tears.
The pink tongue darted out and vainly attempted to moisten his lips as, Lestat made a show of being nonchalant. He gave a flourished roll of his eyes and a tried to strike a casual gesture, explaining, “I went for a little trip. Where you may ask?” He paused for a moment, looking entirely confused. “I’m not exactly sure but I wasn’t very fond of the accommodations so, I let myself out.”
"It won't come to that, Armand. What I need from you is you're trust and your patience." Louis felt a pit in his stomach at the reality of Armand’s statement.
John glared up at him through his brows.
John tore open the ensuite door that opened into the same bathroom and stepped inside the small room, slamming it behind him.  “Yes, that may bloody well be, you massive wanker!  But I care greatly and you will damn well learn to consider that!”
He went stock still.  Neither man breathing, both hanging in that moment for an eternity, with their lips just barely touching one another. Sherlock had actually kissed him.  The detective had gotten into the liquor, told John he wanted to have babies with him, asked him to bed, and then
“Now John,” The order was panted out through gritted teeth as Sherlock’s fists twisted in the sheets. Those odd eyes blazed as they stared down at him, lust written clearly across his face.
He felt Sherlock lean forward then, putting pressure on his shoulders as he slid further down to sit firmly on his rear. John bit the inside of his cheek to stop the protest on the new position. If he complained about every little thing that his mad friend did he would never get anything done.
In a sweeping gaze imperceptible to the mortal before him he took in the man's person.  The dark trousers, wrinkled from a day’s wear, the dress shirt unbutton at the collar and folded up to the elbows, the sheen of sweat glistening on the pale triangle of flesh revealed in that opening, and the stain of fresh blood drying around a circular tooth marked wound from a bite on the lean length of neck.  His eyes were narrowed in scrutiny and his hair was disheveled, as though someone's hands had roughly been through the curls.  His mouth was an impassive bow, the man trying to stay in complete control of the emotions that obviously had propelled him down the steps.
The blogger cursed to himself and shut the file on the laptop. He had not even gotten halfway through the document, and there was still more to add. That didn’t matter now. The blogger left his flat mate to sleep in the chair, mentally logging the time, before he slipped into the shower to get ready for his date.
“Right.  She gave me a call after she received a note from you,” he paused, and corrected, “at least what I believe was a note from you…?”
Being this type of a creature seemed to have inconsequential draw-backs, so long as you could over-come the morality of killing, which in itself was easily thwarted by ensuring, like John had been taught, to target those who deserved to die or those whom wished for it. Giving up the daylight hours was easy enough, Sherlock preferred working when less people were about to muddle up his work.  The only bother about it, the fact that he would indeed be incapacitated during the daylight hours by the Death Slumber, which certainly would be irksome to become accustomed to.
The air within the croft was chilled and now that he looked about the room that he was in, he realized instantly that he was very likely still within the United Kingdom, based solely on the beam-work overhead and the plaster on the walls.  He pushed himself with his hands to the edge of the bed.  It was a simple mattress on a raised brown metal frame and below his feet he could see crude wooden floors, covered by a fraying wool rug.  He hesitated then, just before jumping off the mattress, at the memory of the last time he had done so after a drug cocktail.
The vampire crossed his arms, one hand coming up to stoke the sides of his chin. “I believe now that Moriarty’s power stems from some kind of demonic entity. He’s not possessed. In my experience with the like, I would surmise that he has somehow come into this power, although I haven’t the slightest idea how.”
The mobile flew from his hand as John was bodily spun in the terrifyingly strong arms of this vile creature.  There was a hand at the back of his head and one against the small of his back, as he felt the stinging clench of the teeth once more deep within the muscle of his neck.  He let out a startled gasp and winced, as a burning pull laced the vein-work of his upper half, and he realized his blood was being greedily drank.
John wanted none of this.  “Ha!  Why don’t you stop lying and say something worth listening to?”  He had wanted to sound threatening, but he was all breathy.  He felt winded still and the punching hadn’t helped improve his dominance.
They had said little until the jet had taken off and even then Lestat was slim on the real details, focusing instead on elaborating all the fanciful little distracting tidbits regarding his time away.  He explained that the jet was his, that he had learned to be financially successful early on in his immortal life, and had the means to buy a small country at his disposal if he so desired to do so.  He talked briefly about his early vampirical years then, portraying himself the hero or the victim in the struggle with the very real gifts and slights of being undead, and then when his questions became too pestering and boring Sherlock was tossed a couple of paper backs.
Sherlock came to a stop, glancing askance at the man and answered, "No it's not." It was easy to tell that name was a lie, the stranger obviously knew someone by that name but the inclination by which he said it was not the way someone carried their own name.
Sherlock was getting tired of waking up to the dreadful silence of being alone in the Baker Street flat.  The feeling left what was starting to become an all too familiar weight in his gut—completely illogical but very real yet the same—made all the more dreadful by the levity that it brought with it, of his current unprecedented predicament.  John was missing.  Mary was murdered.  He knew nothing.  He could do…nothing.
Deciding his mind was too weary for much else the man acquired what he wanted from the upstairs flat and then, shutting the door behind him, returned to the basement. Flopping down on the chaise lounge that was along a far wall overlooking the bed, the man quickly fell asleep. After all, there was really no point in sleeping elsewhere if this was, indeed, the safest room in the house, and his work on the case could wait at least a few hours of rest.
The man took his mug to his work desk in the parlour. This place too needed some tidying, after the rampant pace they had started out with yesterday on their current unsolved, case. He straightened the papers, bothering only to sort them into two piles: the current case and everything else. With this clutter pushed aside he retrieved his laptop from under the long couch—where he had ditched it the other day to keep up with the consulting detective, who suddenly had gasped knowingly and then darted out the door.
With a speed that defied to detective’s obvious state of fatigue and dishevelment, he had snatched Lestrade’s elbow and had propelled him the short distance out of the door.  It was all he could do to reel back around and wedge a toe in the jamb so the door wouldn’t close.  He could hear the detective give an exasperate grunt of complaint.  The inspector peered back at the man through the gap and repeated his last sentiment through clenched teeth.  “Find John.”
Louis spotted the figure of the elderly land lady, arms heavy with the burden of bags as he pulled up to the front of the flat. As soon as she had saw the expensive car roll to a stop in front of the flat, almost as if on que the bottom of a bag let loose and sent a cascade of oranges rolling down the step as she let out a string of curses and tried to rescue the remainder of her items while fighting with the house keys. Louis was out of the car and had gathered up most of the fallen fruit while the woman’s back was turned and as she dropped the rest of the bags in the entrance with a disgusted huff, she turned to collect her fallen groceries.  She let out a startled yelp at the smiling man on the ste, arms full of oranges.
“I like this place much better than… than your weird, endless library.” John commented, his dark blue eyes flashing up at the detective with a certain fondness in their depths.
"Mmm, a while." she answered, vaguely.  After a glare, she amended, "A couple of days.  You were not in the best of shape when you showed up and I think the morphine helped to keep you out."
Like it was meant to be a car that approached from behind slowed its pace, coming to a stop just in front of him with its light on.  A cabbie.  He gratefully opened the door and climbed into the back seat.  He gave the haggard hazel eyes in the rear-view mirror the address and settled back into the seat, exhausted, yet content.  Soon.  Soon he would be home and he could pretend none of this had happened.  Then he could ignore Sherlock altogether. At least, for a while.
The detective wondered if she was deliberately putting him off due to her employers’ instruction or if she was doing it simply for her own enjoyment, when he realized his leg was fidgeting and that he was scratching the inside of a elbow.  The morphine withdrawal was taking up too much of his conscious mind—there was a reason Mycroft had cleaned him of it.  He tried to read more from the girl, managing only to deduce that she was an animal sympathiser, particularly for stray cats and the noisy puffins outside, that she was a world traveler and could very well have no home in particular as she had said, and also that she was roughly between the age of twenty-eight and thirty-two, was an only child—no had a sibling, who had died as a child—and that she loved chocolate.  They were all rather good deductions, could possibly be useful later, but were as of right now, rather useless.
“Why did they do it?” he asked the blunt question that was hanging in the air between them.
“It is a stretch.  We have no evidence to suggest that Moriarty is linked to the Talmasca in the least.” Mycroft scoffed, made even more irritable with this new information.  “It’s still something to throw to Sherlock that would keep him relatively safe.”
The consulting detective went to the window, pulling back the curtain with a long finger to glance at the doctor’s fleeing form on the dark silent sidewalk below.  It was late but even still the man was racing away, too consumed by the confusion and his own surprise to even think of attempting to flag a cabby for the trip back to his other lover—his other home.
Lestat repeated this process with the man’s legs, pinning the screaming torso down with his foot before yanking the limbs free. The head was last. Moriarty still screamed and cursed, around the object in his throat. When it was done, the vampire held the head of their tormentor out towards the puffin girl. He bent his knee, making this an offering to her. She bowed her head in return, before stepping forward to pry to dead man’s jaw open. She pulled back on the chain and out came the ancient amulet.
Excruciating pain.  He felt as if he must be crying out but the sound was drowned by the rush in his ears.  He felt his body become weightless, the ground was a blur beneath his person.  Before he realized it he had been hurled across the room, had hit the wall with enough force to crack the dry wall, and was now sprawled on his own cold hardwood flooring, gasping for a precious breath.  His mind reeled, consumed by fear of the unknown—
Lestat took the towel with a grateful nod of his head, the wet tendrils of blond curls dipping with the motion.  He gave the detective a cheeky grin and, motioning at the stack of towels in the cupboard, the vampire suggested, “Looks like you could use one yourself.”
It was all she said before she left down the street, latching the gate behind her. Sherlock let her go, somehow knowing if he pursued the question further she would either lie or fain ignorance.  There was that duplicitous sense of duty and force about her again that made the detective question whether she was helping or delivering someone else’s message. He watched her walk away down the street, realizing as he lost sight of her around a building that it was the first time she had not disappeared on him. Although his mind longed to know what powers the strange girl possessed, the note in his hand and the task ahead called his attention back.
The mortal was just as eager, ready to continue, and those greedy fingers pulled at the buttons on his fly, popping them open.  David helped him to push the jeans down, along with the pants beneath, revealing his own hard need.  Mycroft grabbed the vile of oil and quickly slicked the length of dark golden skin, before leaning back and raising his legs in offer.  David’s smile grew, as he stepped up to the desk between them and hungrily leaned forward to take the mortals face in his hands.  He smothered the others mouth with his own, entangling their tongues, as he rocked sensually against the other.
Mary was everything he had.
John had begun to struggle a little now, the loud and sudden smack of his friends somewhat self-inflicted punishment, sobering him by proxy. Although the vampire seemed to be growing more aware he was still terribly weakened and it hurt Sherlock to see John only manage to squirm against the steel arms of Moriarty’s slave.
Lestrade went straight back into the crime scene, finding that Donovan had done a bang up job seeing to the evidence, the body, and the crew.  The inspector took back over and helped finish the few loose ends that were left and was out of the scene in an hour.  Sally was pleased to have been handed the reigns to the murder-suicide investigation and Lestrade instead headed straight for Baker Street.
“Demon possession?” asked an incredulous voice. “Isn’t that a little bit of a stretch?”
It was cold and wet outside.  The city lights illuminated the low hanging clouds, making it appear as though London was glowing, warm and brilliant.  He was anything but.  John cursed loudly and wrapped his arms about himself to keep the chill from setting in.  Heat from his body rose as a mist about him, his rapid breaths freezing as they hit the frigid air, as he mulled the phone conversation over in his head.  The doctor cursed his own stupidity—his natural need to selfishly only think of himself in his panic.  His captor had made contact, had somehow been in the suite, left him a damn phone, and he had learned nothing.  He didn’t know who had him, why he was being held, when he would be released, and worse yet…he had not asked about Mary.
“The scent was…somehow familiar.” John replied, trying to make sense of the memories that surfaced when he tried to recall the scent. In his mind’s eye he could see a face. He could see his hand reaching out and shaking the delicate white digits of a woman’s hand. “Does she have red hair?”
The fisheye of his vision was focused on John’s sightless eyes, welling with bloody tears, as the vampire’s teeth gnashed together. He strained to somehow manage the pain.  Moriarty was there, his head thrown back as he guffawed with laughter and applauded them both. Sherlock tried to tune it out, just like he tuned out the feeling of his own fingers circling John’s beating heart.
The ping of a text message, the phone sliding back into the deep wool pocket then a tug on the bottom hem to straighten and John found himself, once again, trailing behind the lengthy gate of taller man. Taxi flagged, streets navigated and the doors slammed as the pair stepped onto the deserted and broken sidewalk in the shadow of an old brick building.
The vampire inspected the discarded strip of toilet paper, noting something written on it with a permanent marker.  Bringing his attention back to the mobile at his ear still, he quickly ended the call, “I’m sorry, Armand.  I have to go.  Thank you for your offer.  I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow.”
“Yeah, I did.” She retorted, appearing pleased with herself rather than guilty.  “I just wanted to hear you say it.”
John must have still appeared apprehensive, for the detective’s shoulders straightened as his hands found his hips and gave a very exasperated sigh.  “You know I wish not to leave you here unattended.  The consequences would be dire for both you and the hapless fool that finds you.  We can co-exist together, John.  Why do you think I have been laboring so hard to experiment with our proximity?  This can work, if you just trust me.”
can do about it."
Lestat watched the younger vampire with a well-kept poker face before drawing in a breath and matching pace.  The two men made their way out of the putrid London ally-way, back into the amber glow of the quiet street. The elder vampire had seen the look that flashed in those fathomless jade depths before, Louis approved of his change in fashion since the airport and that Louis had done his best to not show it, made it all the more endearing to Lestat. He knew he was a wicked and troublesome creature to love and there was no doubt that Louis felt that, and a great many other feelings, for him. He needed that love desperately, that much he knew now about himself.  After endless escapades that had left him teetering on the brink of absolution and utter oblivion, it had been Louis who was always a voice in that darkness that drew him back from the abyss.
With a grunt of effort, John tilted his head back, spying the nightstand by the bed. He was close enough that he could reach a hand back over his head to grab the single drawer’s knob. He struggled from below and backwards to open it. After it had slid open far enough, he fumbled around inside, finding nothing but a nearly empty bottle of painkillers and the discrete sized bottle of personal lubricant. The illegal Sig Sauer P226R, which normally rested there or in the belt of his jeans, was missing.
He mentally shook his head at the thought as the cool air rose goosebumps along his skin. He knew a way that he could warm up. John knelt at the edge of the bed and began crawling up the younger man. He dipped his head to place slow, lingering kisses across the exposed stomach and abdomen as he moved. He leisurely worked his mouth over the man’s torso while pulling the sides of the open shirt up, forcing Sherlock to sit up the slightest amount so that he could pull the material out from beneath his body.
The soft and familiar creak of the steps leading up to his flat alerted Sherlock that Mrs. Hudson was ascending, as a soft rap on his only partially closed door revealed the older lady in her conservative evening wear.
Suddenly intensely disinterested in physically continuing, Sherlock’s gaze went distant as he began throwing out theories. In a matter of seconds, he had rattled off a rather long list of reasons why a vampirical body may respond differently to sex than a mortal one. Half, he immediately rescinded, before tossing out the next idea in a rush of thoughts. Suddenly he stopped.
David just continued.  “Perhaps, does the term
Sherlock let out a startled cry that was half moaned, as he felt the sharp pierce of his lover’s fangs. The teeth tore without grace into the deltoid, where his neck met his shoulder.  He could feel the hot well of his own blood being pulled into the mouth of his lover and suddenly his body was overwhelmed.  In a shuttering constriction of muscles, he came, spilling his own hot fluid, as John drank from him.
A single question ghosted from the man’s lips, in utter disbelief, “Where in the hell…am I?”
Four men were dead on the floor while a fifth was tied in quarters to a huge king sized bed that overlooked the wide skyline through a wall of glass. Lestat didn't waste time in draining the man and enjoying the shuttering fight of him as the hot thrum of his heart pumped eager mouthfuls for the immortal. Three dead and drained of blood should be enough to stir the pot. Two he had disposed of when taking over the penthouse from its drug cartel owners. Two others had died of gunshot wounds from the cross firing when the panic broke out at the disbelieving cry.
Hands trailing down over breast and abdominals, shifting with each shallow breath, as the detective spread the soldier’s legs and positioned himself between them.
“Have I sufficiently earned my freedom, then?” Sherlock asked, elegant dark eyebrow arched behind the unruly bangs. When John failed to respond Sherlock executed his best ‘woe is me’ look and John scoffed, rolling his eyes.
"Oh, very good Mr. Holmes! Why don't you tell me what it is then?" There was a predatory slyness in the grin that was spreading across the pale man’s narrow face.
“Shut up, David.” Lestat grumped. “I am hurt that you care so little for my tender behind. Where I was really was torture, even if I can’t recall where that may have been.”
That had been bloody amazing, he thought with a sigh. Well, mostly amazing. Their initial argument hadn't been much fun and it had been rather painful when Sherlock had first entered him, that hadn't been very enjoyable. Afterwards, the thought trailed off as John twitched again, his inner muscles clenching at the remembered feel of the genius filling him.
Molly cleared her throat with a mousy chirp and their eyes broke.  “Is it what you were looking for?”
"Hm. How exactly, is it fancy that you followed me here?" The dark-haired man replied as he shifted in the faux-leather seat while Lestat, a stunningly attractive and pale skinned man smoothly lifted the messenger bag, replacing himself in the seat. The bag dropped to the carpet with a soft thud as Louis caught a glimpse of the other man's pale lips quirking into a painfully devious smile.
think that this is all bloody fascinating.
The flat was just as terrible.  Everything was in a disarray.  There were papers pinned to the wall above the couch, chaotic and rumpled, papers spread across the floor, tossed haphazardly in every direction, and papers spread across the table beside the laptop below the giant bison skull.  Tea cups and beakers were nestled in amongst the clutter.  Clothing here and there as well.  It was a general disaster.
“Stupid!” He snapped at himself, expelling a long breath and closing his eyes for a moment. Taking in a deep breath he attempted to clear his frustrated mind and remembered that he had somewhere he was supposed to be.
As John walked through the drenched streets of London he found himself chuckling. For all intents and purposes, they had dated since the day he had moved in. The only difference now was that things had turned physical and that had been bloody amazing. So yes, he was willing to take that step. Now, all he had to do was convince Sherlock that he didn’t regret what had happened and wanted to see where things went.
John grimaced at the detective’s word choice. “People died, Sherlock.”
Dark curls fell over his brows as he changed his viewing angle multiple times, bobbing up and down and around to gain the desired 360 degree view of the man, and behind him he heard as Molly clarified for the other doctor, "You would know as well as I do, John, that even with the kind of trauma that the body has sustained it would not be this depleted.  Cardiac arrest would cease the flow and then pooling would begin. There was additional blood-loss due to basic gravity when the body was moved but...just look at the feet."
John allowed himself a victorious smirk, leaning over his mouth to the others ear to whisper a quick jibe, "Mm-hmm, yeah, I never said I would fight fair."  Then dismounted, pushing himself up and off of his flat mate, offering the other a hand up, "now come on. Let's get you to bed before you have any more great deductions."
The soldier in him stood firm and resolute, sternly reminding John that this came with the part.  He had better grow a back bone and get used to it or it could over throw his equilibrium.  Louis had admitted as much, had known others who could not handle it and ended themselves because of it.  John did his best to ignore the two young ruffians and began to mentally roadblock the bombarding sounds and smells that flooded in from all around him, as he made his way on his unknown course through the London streets.
Lestat was standing, on one side of the room and John was with Louis on the other.  They were arguing in a deafening tone that Sherlock was unable to fully comprehend.  Louis was holding John back.  The detective’s eyes were frozen on his friend.  It was John, but it wasn’t.
His mobile seemed to elude him as well, lost somewhere in the parlor’s eccentricities.  He had left the flat just after dark, no longer able to allow himself to be confined within the stifling rooms of the Baker Street flat with his own disappointment and failed experiments.
Kissing a trail down he made a point at stopping and lathering attention on first one nipple then the other before continuing his southern trek. His teeth grazed over ribs as he continued nips and sucking until he reached his navel. Tongue dipping in, he had to hold Sherlock’s hips for a moment until the other man sank back into the bed.
The alley was dark and conveniently quiet, with no direct line of sight from the casual vehicle or person that might pass by on the nearest road.  It was a downtrodden area of the large city, known for its share of derelict building, warehouses, and grungy pubs and peelers.  Even as such the body had been reported rather quickly, long before the stiffness of rigor mortis had taken a foothold, which had even John wondering if the murderer had not reported the death.  Obviously they had not stuck around to be questioned by police, which had significantly limited their search.  With little to go on and no desire to dig any further Lestrade's men had left it to go cold.  It wasn't worth their time—it was another drug runner off the streets.
The dark head gave a nod of agreement.
The doctor fought his struggling flat mate, managing to keep him pinned down with his body weight, letting him breath at fairly regular intervals between the smothering.  The long limbs attempted to push him off, all failing, as John cackled wickedly.  This was revenge and he was not afraid to admit that he loved every second of it.  That was until a sharp knee caught John in the shoulder blade, thrusting him forward, as the hips beneath him bucked sideways.  Thrown off balance the two tumbled off of the couch and onto the floor with a loud whack, swearing and fighting and laughing.
More wicked still was the strings he sometimes seen attached to the pairs joints, leading to the marionette’s paddle.
“Scoot up.” He ordered the other man, his voice deep and husky as he drank in the sight.
"That was in poor taste, Lestat.” Sherlock found the will to spurn the narcissistic prick. “I think I'd rather bleed out.”
His hands were slapped away with a simple chop and Moriarty stepped a pace back.  He glared in an over-acted display of disgust, as he swiped his hands over his costume, taking the time to straighten it.  Then he smiled again, replying with a bored sigh, “Conquering the mortal world was simply too easy.” His nose scrunched up as he admitted, “I needed more of a challenge…and one just so happened to present itself.”
The detective shrugged.  “To be fair, there were many that followed him back to the flat.”
“Think, Sherlock, what are you missing?” He spoke allowed to himself in the room. Eyes that looked down at the unremarkable carpet closed and he brought the ally rushing back around him out of the blackness.
The reality remained that he had no idea where they would be going or what they would do once they got there.  The only thing for certain was that they were in a level of danger, of which John was still attempting to comprehend and that this creature—vampire, whatever he was—was legitimately trying to help.
For once, the detective was considerate of his landlady, sleeping in her own flat.  That was all they would need.  They made their way up the stairs with a respectful modesty and Sherlock could not help but detect that John was physically and mentally repressing his natural vampirical speed, forcing his new body to slow down and take things at a more moderate pace than was given to his kind.  Like a gentleman, he walked through the open door and gave a welcoming gesture of his arm, before John reluctantly stepped through the threshold.
John began drifting, his muscles unclenching as he relaxed into the bed. The edges of sleep were creeping in, pulling him under, one breath at a time. Something warm and wet dripped onto his back. John’s eyes flashed open and he spotted Sherlock, standing at the side of the bed, a bottle small clutched in hand. “What in the bloody hell do you think you’re doing?” John exclaimed as he made to sit up.
David was no fool.  He realized of course that the mortal was also seeing memories of his own life, both when mortal and when damned, yet this was only a testament to the level of trust that the two men shared and was part of the drive they had to be in one another’s arms once more.
The body behind him moved, a slow gentle motion that made the bed springs creak and groan, and soon he felt the softly draped hand run up the length of his bicep. The other’s head came close to his ear and he whispered, “Did you want to try again, John?”
John was standing before him, looking down at him with those intense blue orbs, searching his face, his being, looking for an explanation of some kind and not finding one.  He enjoyed that the doctor had followed him into the privacy of 221B but at this particular time his staring was increasingly distracting.  Sherlock lifted his chin from his steepled hands, “You have questions.”  It was not a question in itself and it was not a demand.
Instead, he took stock of what he had around him. He was disappointed when he realized there was nothing to occupy himself in arms reach. Well, since he couldn’t quite muster the energy for standing yet, he would just stay here until his body stopped aching and head stopped throbbing so much. He took another long swallow of the rich tea, ignoring the pain the heat of it caused; good tea, after all, was worth a bit of pain.
"Ah, John," Sherlock's voice called to him.
The creature gave an inquisitive tilt of its head, the mouth curling in an enthused smirk.  The hands quickly unzipped the jacket and the vampire leaned back into the chair, resting his arms on the rests of the chair—a movement that was far faster than any human could easily conduct.  Mycroft understood the underlying display.  “Now you have my attention, Mr. Holmes.” The pale man intoned, resting his chin in the fingers of his left hand.  “Pray, enlighten me.”
"I'd appreciate it, John." Sherlock commented casually, seating himself and pinning his eyes on the passing scenery through the window.
John frowned at his reflection in the mirror. He didn’t seem to look like the man he had been. He resembled his younger self, a man fifteen years younger. He had been no fool, age had not been as kind to him as it had some, and neither had the heat, sweat, and sand of Afghanistan. All that was gone now. His skin was ruddy no more, the wrinkles around his eyes and his mouth had vanished, and all that was left was white smoothness.
Holmes.  Well, I see you have lost none of your charm.”
“I do not fear for my safety and if you do, Inspector, than you are welcome to accompany me.” The detective snapped contemptuously, narrowing his pale cold gaze on the other man that was openly scrutinizing him.
“It is.” Was all he said.
“Someone she did not want to be any longer.”
“I believe so, yes.” Sherlock replied, explaining simply, “The larger problem does not lay, however, in the type of power itself but from whence it came. I suspect Marisa may know more on the subject, but I made the inference to late to question her about it.”
Lestrade confirmed that Sherlock had discarded it, when he had shown it to him, and so John knew where he would be after this.  There really wasn’t much more he wanted to know then and he certainly wanted to avoid those other questions that he could hear in Lestrade’s mind—how much younger he looked, how good he looked, and why that was—so John gave the convenient excuse of not lingering in case it drew unwanted attention from his attackers to his friend and the two parted ways.  John left not completely unscathed.  Lestrade had pulled him in for a quick strong embrace, again repeating his apologies for what had happened to Mary, and gave John his word that he would watch over his land lady while he and Sherlock sorted out this mess.
Mycroft’s thin lips pulled back over his perfectly aligned teeth, pristinely white from constant diligence and care, as he countered the comment deftly, “John’s disappearance is precisely why you must leave, Sherlock.”
The thoughts quickly evaporated with the need for oxygen registering right around the time the lips against his own stirred slightly and, as his own mouth parted to suck in a breath, he felt the inquisitive swipe of a wet tongue dart out against his mouth. The flush that rolled over the doctor swept up from the legs entwined with his own, all the way up, though the press of the other man’s hard stomach against his groin, through his chest, speeding up his heart, sending a wave of tingles through to his fingers and up to his own lips, which in turn slowly reacted to the probing digit by parting further.
How unassuming that little strawberry-tart had been. So conveniently available to take in his detective and care for him, for such a small insignificant price. How he hated himself for ever falling victim to that blasted demon Moriarty and his schemes. He certainly felt the fool. It mattered little now though. He could solve nothing by rebuking himself for his past mistakes—he had not yet and he did not want to make a habit of starting now. All he could do was move on and make the best of it. He had hurt many but hurt he knew could be mended, like any garment, with time and care.
John gave a noncommittal shrug of his shoulders, as the detective noted that the vampire seemed unconcerned about grabbing a jacket.  He was busy deducing exactly how the temperature effected his kind, as they headed out the door, when John responded, "There ought to be something close by."
The statement transformed Sherlock's expression from indifference, to interest, and then quickly to indignation, all within a fraction of a second. "Where are we going?"
Before they left, he had made a few inquiries with Angelo and asked for a few favors.  The man had a criminal history and with it always came certain contacts that one generally kept, in case of emergency.  He received nothing new that he didn't already know and when they were finished, he sought out his homeless network contact to check in with her.
He turned and headed back in, the automated glass doors retracting as he approached to allow him back into the warmth of the suite.  This was something at least, as crude as it was.  It was an attempt to escape.  He was going squirrely.  The phone call from his mysterious captor the other night had only made things worse.  It was like an itch that you couldn’t scratch.
John woke with a sharp cry of panic, bolting upright in the pitch black room. His pulse was racing, he could feel sweat on his brow.  It dripped into his eyes.  It stung, so he wiped at his face with the back of his hand. Blinking rapidly he tried to find focus or light in the room, neither of which came as he took a deep breath and deliberately exhaled in a slow hissing fashion.  The dream was still hot and fresh in his mind as he closed his eyes and pulled his knees to his chest, the bed beneath him creaking with his movements.
She laughed aloud, pulling at her partners coat to keep him from swaying too far off balance and falling into the street. In her attempt to keep the man from certain peril she over-compensated, pulling far too hard, and lost her grip. Fumbling wildly back she slammed into the unsuspecting and distracted veteran who cursed in surprise, as the drunken women fell atop him.
There was a window straight out from him and another at the end of the bed.  They were both of old construction, wood and single pane glass, drafty as hell.  The room itself was cold and his naked skin lit with goose bumps in immediate response.  It was light outside but there was the telltale darkening of sunset and even though he could not see it, he could hear the ocean.
There was a small boudoir immediately in front of the doorway, small but enough.  As he approached he could already smell the disinfectant, whose residue still coated the cheap piece of IKEA furniture.  He opened the doors.  John’s shirts and trousers were hung in orderly rows—
Armand had given Louis a reply but the vampire was distracted and missed half of what the other had said.  Something damp and unpleasant had fallen with the sleet from the sky, plastering itself to top of his head.  He grabbed at it, pulling it down to see that it was no less disgusting than he had assumed—a sopping wet and torn piece of toilet paper.
"Yes, alright?  Yes, I could.  But am I willing to?  No." the vampire snapped, "So, stop thinking about it.  I can't fly!  I'm not Superman."
David was not about taking things too quickly.  A few of their earlier encounters had been too new to be taken slowly and sometimes one’s lust was too strong and too urgent to allow for it.  Now David had all the time in the world and even though he had the gift of speed by the nature of his species, he would take this man here, on his own desk, slowly—if only to greedily soak up the sound of that last moan.
Lestat’s hands rubbed together in delight as the young woman confirmed what he suspected.  John had gotten a message out and Lestat knew exactly where he was.
“Dear beauty, now I must admit I am out of great plans for the evening and so the next move is yours. Am I taking you back to that stingy little flat you’ve decided to rent below the brooding detective or did you have any other more enjoyable ideas in mind for the end of this evening?” There was no mistaking the intent of the statement from the moistened lips of the pale young man, yet Louis took a brief moment to ponder his own desires.
"Sherlock!" His name being yelled shook the consulting detective out of his foray, as he looked up with a swallow at John who was standing in the flat, arms crossed over his chest, looking annoyed.
Sherlock didn’t bother buttoning the jacket up but calmly strode the few steps to the door. As his fingers rested on the handle he glanced back at John. “You are in no shape to be doing anything. It would be best to continue this another time.” His tone was almost bored as he stated the words, as though he had already dismissed John entirely and was now thinking about something else.
Lestat gave a soft chuckle and took out a small glass vile from somewhere on his person, placing it into her small hand.  “As promised.”
David wondered what that could possibly mean.  In truth, he had not quite believed that the conversation Lestat had relayed just prior was all that accurate—his maker had a well known penchant for exaggerating—but now this was obviously the same antagonist and he used the same odd analogy-ridden speech.  It was cloaked, like speaking in code, never truly saying what one means.  This left one to imagine the true intent, to find it challenging, intimidating, or offensive.  It was not hard to discern how Lestat would take it.
“Well...” the creature admitted with a nonplussed tilt of his head, “Nothing is truly eternal. Not even for me.”
“The subject is male, early forties, no visible signs of trauma to the body to indicate how he died,” she was listing for him all the particulars he would normally expect from her upon his arrival.
“Texting you?  Sherlock?  Why?!”
Lestrade shook his head again, pursed his lips, and chuckled, “Not a chance in hell, mate.  I’m going home to sit in my pants and watch telly.  Maybe have a brew too.”
It was easy to ascertain that the comment had not the intended effect on his partner. The drawn look tightened and it was easy to see the tension building on the doctors face by the line of his mouth, the clenching of his jaw, the flaring of his nostrils. He was holding back. Then he broke, the thin line of his mouth pursed and his brows knit over his marbled blue orbs, too dark and deep, mottled with that odd touch of brown around the pupil. His chin jutted forward, commanding, dominating, as he rebuked in a firm and steady voice, "Things aren't like they were before, Sherlock. Don't expect that to change."
His saliva had begun to drip down, creating the lubrication his fingers needed and on a torturously slow downward motion with his mouth, he pushed his index finger in. He relished the full body jerk and the near painful fingers in his hair as he slowly withdrew with both mouth and finger before plunging in again.
“Surely you know who was after Mary, who murdered her in her home, and staged it for John to find.” The detective hated the quick stricken sound of his own words as they left his lips.  He was unaccustomed to be at the losing end of controlling his own emotions and the effect was increasingly irritating.  He felt the irrational urge to leap across the desk top and wring the information from his elder brother’s strangling throat.
The blackness was consuming. He felt like it ate at him, slowly devouring one morsel of his flesh at a time as the seconds ticked by.
Behind the croft he found a crude wash line, where a few of his belongings were strung up to dry.  He went over to it and snagged them down, wrapping them in a bundle to take back inside.  It was cold and the wind was bitter, even the wildlife was hunkered down against the high rocky cliffs.  He could hear the birds, the gannets and the puffins squawking, but few were in the air now, they too wished to escape it.  Quickly he made his way back inside.  His bare feet were red from the cold and the shivering only made him more nauseated than the morphine withdrawal had.
Whatever and whenever this had happened it didn’t matter now.  It was clear that Sherlock Holmes had been away a while.  With his curiosity piqued, John found himself back at the penthouse in the high-rise where he had been held captive.  He was disturbed to find it was no more.  Upon investigation he realized it had exploded and wondered then if this was the reason why over the last few weeks he had a growing sense that his friend was in trouble.
“Arrogant cock!” Lestat spat, allowing his anger to flare once again, now that the imminent threat had removed itself.
"Excuse me?" He had been trying to keep the muffler on Sherlock’s thoughts resounding in his head as he also attempted to formulate some loose idea of what the hell he was going to do.
Once under the covers, with his head resting on the adjacent pillow, his outwardly limbs skimming the very edge of the mattress, he let out the breath he had been holding. So far so good. As long as he could maintain a safe distance from his bedfellow, he would prove that they could, indeed, share a bed. Seeing as John was not apt to move, it was entirely up to him to stay still. Releasing another long breath, he closed his eyes and shortly allowed his exhaustion to take him.
He must have hesitated a moment too long, for his flat mate eagerly cut him off. “The time of day is of no consequence, John.”
He leaned down, dark hair brushing across the doctor’s cheek and nipped hard at his shoulder, hands drawing sharp trails of heat down his arms to link his fingers in John’s. In a reversal of roles, he forced John’s hands along the bed until they were beside his head before he leaned down, the green of his eyes nearly drowning out the blue and grey. “Or should I fuck you instead?” He breathed the words across John’s parted lips, smiling down at him wickedly.
"It's just...annoying." John replied, taking his hand away.  "You're thoughts are so fast and furious.  It's worse than a machine gun barrage over head."
As John grasped the straining erection in a firm grip his other hand continued down, brushing lightly over balls and across the perineum before circling his entrance. He moved slowly, hands working in sync as he watched Sherlock’s face for any sign of distress, absently noting that the man had yet to look away from him since this had begun. As he stroked his index finger breaching the outer ring of muscle, causing another groan to escape. Emboldened by this John continued his slow invasion, timing each firm stroke with his finger penetrating deeper.
John wasted no time searching for the bastard. He reached out with his mind and tried to find the familiar connection of Sherlock. Almost instantly the methodic words entered John’s mind from the consulting detective, ‘
The blonde’s large blue eyes rolled back and she stifled a chuckle, as she shook her head.  With an adoring smile she rested the temple of her head against the side of the door she was standing half behind and replied, “Why do you think?” And then she left, saying simply, “I’ll see you later tonight, after chocolate cake.”
—and when he opened it his mind was inundated with information.  The bed was before him, against the wall, nightstands on either side, white metal frame—
The smile on the full lips drew ever so slightly wider and the head gave an almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgement.  “Very good.” The man almost purred the words, soft, low, and in a tone that was both menacing and seductive.  “Perhaps you know already then why I have come uninvited into your flat tonight.”  A statement.  Another test?  Or just a means of forwarding the conversation without admitting it himself?  Why would he detract from ownership of his own purpose for being there?
She gave him a nod and turned away to hide a wide straight toothed grin, as she walked back over to the side board.  She proceeded to pull out bowls and spoons—soup then—and returned to ladle out the broth.  She set both bowls on the table and then moved her chair to sit down.  He followed suit, getting up and sliding his own chair to the round table.  Seated across from her he paid the woman little mind, focus intent now on the soup in front of him, his stomach echoing his hunger.  They ate in relative silence for a while.  The broth was well flavored with onions, carrots, and potatoes, that were soft in his mouth as he chewed.  The meat was savory too, but not quite chicken.  Taking a moment, he paused in his gluttonous consumption of the filling soup, to inquire, "Puffin?"
John didn’t listen to the change of words that the voice spoke to him. The woman in his grasp was losing. Her pink skin was turning ever more blue and purple, the veins popping out along her temples. Her sclera’s becoming more bloodshot, the lack of oxygen and the struggle popping blood vessels over her cheeks. Ludvik was almost dead.
“Very good, Mr. Holmes!” Lestat trumpeted loudly, as he jumped from the light standard back down onto the sidewalk.  He pointed a finger at the detective as he added in a whisper, “But have you solved the most intriguing part of the puzzle yet?”
John knew this. He had practiced avoiding it routinely and was regimented in his resolve to appear as mortal as possible. He fully understood the reasons why and the repercussions of not doing so, and yet now...he could not find that resolve.  He could not resist that scent and the reactions it caused in his new body.  Worst of all was the over powering feeling of possession that slowly claimed his senses, given even greater power by the strong aroma of his own scent overlaid on the man, his
“You’re worried.” Louis spoke. It was not a question, even though he wished a response much the same. Those emerald orbs eyed him from over top of the steaming mug.
His fingers were working in tune with the marching story he laid out for his readers, sentence by sentence, with a languid fluidity. He marvelled at how the quiet of the usually raucous flat aided in his progression. He thanked his lucky stars, perhaps a little too soon.
Sherlock stood unsteadily on the cushions of the long sofa. He’d pushed it back against the peeling print of jacquard wallpaper, to adjust a crooked piece of paper he had pinned there. His eyes scanned the myriad of hastily scrawled notes, all in red ink. Here before him, he had gathered all of the information he knew so far. They were grouped together to see what was fact, what was conjecture, and what was influential. He mapped them all with red twine, connecting each related item.
The man’s ghostly pallor was accentuated by long straight locks of jet-black hair, which was swept back behind one ear, his features punctuated by glassy emerald-envying eyes that seemed to almost glow in the dim lighting of the foyer.  Those eyes crinkled slightly at the corners, as the man smiled pleasantly at him in greeting, John suddenly realized that he was staring.  Shaking his head, he offered a quick apology as the other man quietly approached him, and stuck out his hand.  “I’m sorry, I don’t believe we’ve met.  I’m John.”
Being the dear that she was Mrs. Hudson had heard the raucous calling and was soon toddling up the stairs with a freshly brewed cup.  She was nattering away, something ridiculous about the break-in’s on the news, and she set the warm flowered mug down on the kitchen table beside his microscope without stopping to expect a response from him.  Sherlock pretended to be intensely busy concentrating on the half readied slide shoved under the light at the sound of her approach and she in turn continued yammering in her melodic lilting way as she swept from room to room, tidying and straightening what he had left undone.
The voice cut out and the detective’s gaze instantly met the narrowed icy orbs that were cast his direction.  The man’s eyes were as ethereal as ever, unbelievably intense in color, the navy colored ring around the circumference of his iris making the lighter azure speculation pattern within seem to glow.  It was not a phenomenon that Sherlock could pinpoint a name for but its effect on his person was obvious—it created a strange animalistic like quality that was more than threatening, akin to being caught in the gaze of large wild cat.  His analysis was interrupted by the man’s address.
“Indeed.” Sherlock answered simply, taking up his own cup and taking a draw from the perfectly steeped liquid within. They sat there for a while in silence, sipping tea and Sherlock felt his calm returning as he pondered the obscene notion of someone hacking into his mind from a distance. Then he began to consider from where that dart of fear had emanated from.
“You are essentially immortal.” With a flick of his fingers, he popped the first button. “Not constrained to the loathsome decomposition of time and these fragile bodies.” Another went with the same ease. “Your restraints and burdens are few and pale in comparison to your gains.” The third opened, revealing a hint of the smooth line of his chest. “You must drink blood to survive and essentially shut down during the daylight hours, yet you don’t need to kill to acquire the blood you need to sustain yourself.” With every statement, Sherlock revealed more of his skin.
Sherlock’s eyes seemed to crinkle one degree more before the smile was dramatically dropped, lost completely.  Those ardent eyes never wavering from direct contact—even though John felt the other man’s urge to roll them in disgusted scorn must have been nearly impossible to resist.  In the mechanical tone that John was fully aware the detective used on boring dim-witted people, he spouted his empirical evaluation that would brook no contention. “Your hair is washed, your body is pink from scrubbing, so you were therefore obviously already done cleaning.  Come.  Now.”
He grabbed the taller man with his free hand, twisted and pulled, shifting to harshly slam Sherlock into the wall he had just been pinned against. He wanted to shake the bloody genius, or punch him, or kiss him. “I want you. I want this. I want us.” He all but growled up at the detective. Wasn’t that enough?
“Whoa, I never-” John began. Sherlock cut him off as he pulled back, releasing his restraining grip on the doctor’s hands. He straightened atop John, legs tightening around the man’s hips.
Sherlock said nothing in response to those demanding words and John thought that he might actually be getting through to the other man. He relaxed his guard slightly and began to pull away, only to have the man’s fingers coil into his wet coat and forcefully shove him back.
John took a step back from the table, he could feel the heat on his face as he turned to look away from the only two other living occupants in the room and pointlessly, through the tiny glass windows on the swinging steel doors that lead into the morgue.
“You really are an ass-hat.” She said.  The sound of her voice was low and rather surprisingly bored.  She had bottled the rage that she had been exhibiting moments before and in doing so had taken all the fun out of annoying her.  Her use of language really was deplorable.  She was highly intelligent and still chose not to use it when criticizing him.  “You know, you make it really hard for anyone to have sympathy for you.”
The sentence was cut off as the main entrance to the flat was heard banging against the wall and was shortly followed by the sudden intrusion of the infamous consulting detective, swinging wide the door of 221A with a holler, “Mrs.Hudson!”
“Is he physically capable of combustion?” Mycroft wondered, slightly disbelieving.
Armand dipped his head, eyes pinning Louis with a seductive glance upwards, as the fingertips played against his skin temptingly.  In a sickly sweet tone, he asked, “And do you please, Louis?”
Sherlock's mouth curled at the corner, as their eyes met for the first time without anger for the other.  "It really was quite fascin—interesting." Amending his statement at the last moment did seem to calm John.  "After garnering access to the room, which really was quite difficult, even for myself, I came upon you in the bed in a state of what appeared to be unconsciousness.  You were very still and you did not respond to audible stimuli."
“March first.”
"Then show me." Sherlock was past asking nicely, the words were as much a command as they were a challenge. There was obvious distraction in every movement and action the man took, the words he chose, his nudity, overt sexuality in his body language, disillusioned romanticization of the concept of killing and blood consumption. Dangerous, absolutely.  He knew without a doubt that this man was a psychopath, whom he was caught up in a perilous game against.  John, yet again, was in the collateral blast zone.
This is Sherlock Holmes, he reminded himself. Your bloody git of a flatmate, the genius who pisses people off within a minute of meeting them, often in less time than that. Unfortunately, his body didn’t care. All his body knew was that the person sitting on him had long legs that framed his hips nicely and magic hands.
“I’m not sure how long or to what extent but one thing is clear.  Moriarty has some control over Lestat.  I had my theories before but I just couldn’t nail down how he was doing it.” Sherlock explained in a rush of words.  “All that doesn’t matter now.  Marisa texted me an address.  We need to get to Prague now.”
"Certainly a lead we must follow up on." Sherlock repeated his original sentiment, this time with more conviction.
When he felt Sherlock’s hands twitch and begin to rise John just tightened his grip and slowly drug them up the wall until he had them pinned above the man’s head. He was not about to let Sherlock get off easily for the way he had tormented John earlier.
John nodded again and swallowed the sudden panic that rose within him. The thirst seemed to double in strength at his resistance to the offering.
“Besides,” she added, finishing her previous remark, “John makes Sherlock laugh and that is a rare thing, indeed.”
If he were honest with himself, John was pretty certain that he would have to admit that his brain had been running away to prevent an undesired epiphany.  He did not want to think about Sherlock, or the alley, or 221B—because all of those things had brought back emotions, sensibilities, and sensations that he had long since managed to bury.
Still, the detective grimaced at that point.  It was not as though Sherlock Holmes was easy to handle.  At best the consulting detective was intolerable.  There were moments, most often that John Watson was responsible for, when the man was endurable but those were few and far between.
A sinister cackle bubbled up out of the older girl. “You bet.”
"Fuck, Sherlock!" the vampire barked, so loud it was piercing.  He raked a hand back through his glistening short crop, pulling at the hairs in his frustration and palpable regret.  Those dark blue luminescent eyes darted about the room, anywhere but at the detective, until they had nothing left to focus on but Sherlock.  When their eyes met it was kinetic, like an electrical impulse surged between them, sharing their thoughts.  Sherlock's allowance of the incident, his need to reassure the other man that his vampirical act was not only accepted but desired, only proved to escalate John's ire.  "You can't—we can't—this just..." the vampire struggled to make a coherent sentence, even though Sherlock didn't need him to in order to understand what he meant to emphasize.
When Louis heard the doctor say the detective’s name, it was muffled by the dreamscape that shaped it, low in tone and questioning.  Sherlock reciprocated, his own darker timber rumbling the doctor’s name with a finality that was claiming.  Louis could see the thin fingers tracing over the bare skin of the other man’s body, over the muscled arms, the shoulders, the scar—
"Apparently." David replied, completely unfazed by the outburst as he continued, "And so you find yourself in my company, for which I am grateful, as always."
The genius was unsure how he had given himself away, but wasted little time dwelling on the short coming.  “Lestat enlist your watching again? I do believe I have made it very clear that it is not needed nor welcomed.” he grumbled, the words pleasant but his tone growling.
The doctor gave an incredulous gusting laugh. “And you think that I know where he is?  Last I saw the cock, he was with Lestat.”
He toweled off his hair and did a quick sweep of his body, before wrapping the towel about his waist and heading out into the hallway.  The flat was still dark, save the lamp still on the desk, and was still fairly quiet as well.  If not for the size of the place the detective might have been hard to find.  He wasn’t in the living room or the kitchen, which John found odd.  When he did find the other man he was even more perplexed and perturbed.
