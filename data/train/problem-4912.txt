It had been over a decade since he last saw Tiberius Stone in person. They had parted on amicable terms but neither had bothered to reach out in ten years. That clearly—well—it meant something. Perhaps it had something to do with Tony cutting off their friends with benefits arrangement out of nowhere and picking Pepper over him.
He had thought that he and Steve were on their way to good footing—their conversation had been hard and awkward—but it had been good, right? After dinner he wasn’t so sure anymore. And god, he hated not being sure about something. He had half a mind to storm over to Steve’s room, bang on the door, and demand an explanation.
Just a distraction, he surmised. An attempt to keep any and all attention away from the Tower where the real threat was. Well, he wasn’t falling for it.
“Well, I guess that means when it gets dark soon, we’ll have to go up there to watch, doesn’t it? Right, Tony?” Steve looked over at him with a smirk on his face, and Tony knew the bastard was aware it would be Morgan’s bedtime soon and that he was making promises to earn her favor. Little did Steve know he did not have to do a damn thing to make Morgan love him—he was, quite literally, her hero. She slept with a Captain America plush toy, for god’s sake. And Tony considering protesting, reminding them of Morgan’s bedtime, but then he saw her big, curious eyes and he was a goner. Pepper would yell at him later, but how could he resist watching a meteor shower with his daughter, Peter, and Steve? God help him.
And god, did he hate it. He occasionally thought it was a lot easier when he just got drunk and blindly slept with whoever he could find. Easier—maybe—but significantly unfulfilling and life-draining.
“I’m serious. Get out or I will actually let Natasha break your bones the way she wants to,” Tony replied. He stepped away from his lifelong friend and sat down on a stool on the other side of the island. “Get your things. Friday will call you a car. It will meet you outside.”
Tony’s hand reached out and rested on Steve’s bicep, their chests now touching, the only thing keeping their lips apart: a battle of wills. They stood there, chests rubbing together as they both breathed heavily, silently waiting to see who would give in.
Tony threw the screwdriver in his hand against the wall. Whenever his train of thought ran wild he was prone to having temper tantrums. He hated that habit, but never bothered to put much effort into stopping. What could he say? Sometimes it felt good to throw things.
“So, we think it would be a good idea if you moved in here—the Avenger’s Compound—for a while,” Steve started, turning to face Tony. “It isn’t a good idea for you to live alone and wallow. We’re here for you Tony—we care.”
After showering, brushing his teeth, and slipping into clean sweatpants and a Stark Industries black tee, Tony stumbled his way out into the living room. Steve, Nat, and Bruce were sitting around the coffee table in a huddle with hushed voices.
“Steve—seriously. I wish you saw you the way everyone else does. And no, I’m not talking about as Captain America,” Sam said. “I’m talking about the way we see you—how the rest of the team sees you. How Tony sees you? You’re one in a million man. Maybe someday you’ll believe it.”
This was officially the worst hangover of his life, Tony decided as he stumbled into the kitchen. It felt like a team of sculptors had taken ice picks to his skull. The pounding was what he assumed it would feel like to get repeatedly bashed in the head by the Hulk’s fist. Pain was usually something he could bear, hell, hangovers were something he had thought he had mastered—he was wrong. Apparently, your first hangover after your longest period of sobriety ever was murderous.
Steve cautiously peeked his head into Tony’s room—automatically spotting the bottle of whiskey on Tony’s side table. Steve’s stomach clenched. This was not going to be easy with Tony inebriated.
He closed his eyes and saw a photon blast, Steve’s shield, and his face looking down, tears streaming down his cheeks—why was Steve crying? Tony wanted to reach up and wipe away the sadness on his face, but was jolted back to reality when he heard Nat’s voice.
Peter and Morgan were the embodiment of everything on this living planet that mattered to him. There was no limit to what he would do to ensure their safety—to make them happy—and to see that their dreams came true. They each held special places in his heart. They were what got him up in the morning. They were his inspiration, his motivation, and everything in between. A few years ago, Tony lived in a world where he never thought the two of them would meet. He had lost Peter on some horrific desolate planet millions of miles away and it had broken something crucial inside of him. He had never known a failure like that before, a pain like that—nothing compared. His first words back on earth had been about losing Peter. And Peter had been the reason he ever figured out time travel—why he ever bothered with the ridiculous Time Heist Lang proposed—it had always been Peter.
Maybe talking to Peter was exactly what he needed, maybe not, but either way he was too drunk to know the difference at this point.
“Just because we’re in a relationship now, doesn’t mean I’m his keeper,” Tony grumbled, fiddling with his cufflinks. Pepper smirked.
“Tony, the gala starts in a little under two hours. Where’s Steve?” Pepper asked, walking into the living room of the Avengers compound. She paused between the kitchen and the living room, stopping to fix her earrings and necklace. She was wearing an elegant black gown—Pepper was never one to shy away from dressing up for a special occasion.
Tony could not deny that he carried that chip on his shoulder into his first interactions with Steve. Hell—maybe he never stopped carrying it.
Tiberius Stone unleashes a nefarious attack on Tony that leaves him reeling and Steve with a strong sense of duty to do something about it. And after Tony and Steve share an intensely intimate moment, both individually panic about the implications of what could happen next.
Probably, Tony thought grimly. He knew that being Tony Stark—being Iron Man—required greater and nobler things from him. Most days that was precisely where his motivation came from, but this evening, on the edge of recovering from a hangover, it was what made him want to hide away from all the responsibility. Run away from it. Let someone else handle it for a little bit.
When Tony looked down and saw Steve’s expression his breath caught in his throat. What had he ever done to deserve such steadfastness from him? Steve was a man with a heart of gold, but even so, this was something more than that—Tony could admit that much. And Steve would not lie to Tony, not again, and not about something this significant.
“Anyway—thanks for helping me take care of that Mysterio stuff,” Peter said, stuffing his mouth full of pancakes and syrup.
“I’ve come to the realization that I have feelings for Captain America,” he said, sounding entirely displeased and burdened by the whole thing. Tony was about to continue, but Pepper started to chuckle on the other end of the phone.
“Old age makes you extra sappy. At least that’s what Aunt May says every single time she cries over me,” Peter laughed. Tony elbowed him hard in the ribs. “Ow! Okay, I give, I give. You’re not old.”
“Oh thank god,” Tony cried, nearly weeping from the relief of knowing his daughter was far away from the danger.
Internally, Tony’s heart was hammering against his ribs. He was alternating between embarrassment from almost eating shit again and being captivated by how wonderful Steve smelled—he smelled like petrichor, that beautifully refreshing and hopeful scent after it rained, and it was the single most intoxicating thing he had ever experienced.
“Alright well, Bucky said that my crush wouldn’t be on a dating app and I just don’t understand that. I don’t have a crush?” he said, but the last part felt like a question. He was not aware of a crush, but it seemed that everyone else was.
Tony slowly starts to forgive himself and settle into what his life looks like now. And Steve becomes increasingly more aware of his feelings and where he's at.
Their lips moving together and their hands hungrily grappling onto one another—it’s an offering of safety and peace. It says, “the rest of the world is dark and dangerous—but here together the light shines brightly.”
He was a glutton for self-inflicted punishment. Even with the serum coursing through his DNA the cold wind burned his cheeks. And the length of his runs when he got into this mindset wreaked havoc on the soles of his feet. But god bless that serum, because both ailments healed themselves within the hour after he got done.
Steve grabbed the empty scotch glass and put it in the sink. He went over to the counter and grabbed some paper towel.
“I just don’t want to mess it up now that I have it,” he confessed, staring down at his feet. “Tony clearly thinks this is worth a shot and I just don’t want to let him down.”
“What—what for?” Steve’s eyes got wide and Tony found himself wishing he could jump into the depths of those blues.
“Sorry—” Steve blinked. “I was just trying to…never mind. I’m not having this conversation right now, I’m running late for meeting Tony in his shop.”
“For a genius, you really are stupid, you know that? Tony—I love you so deeply and I know you love me, but sometimes things just don’t work out. And I think we both knew this was coming a long time ago. But we pushed on anyway—probably because we were so lonely—especially after Thanos, we only had each other, and it seemed like the only realistic solution.”
When they stood, Tony’s previously injured leg gave out on him and Steve caught him. Tony cursed under his breath and Steve could have sworn his cheeks were red.
They had argued so much back then. Steve probably thought Tony hated him, but the it was really a defense mechanism. He couldn’t let Steve see how soft the other man actually made him. And it was a fun game—winding Steve up was hilarious and something Tony still did to this day whenever he got the chance.
“Okay, well, you may have a little bit of a point there,” Steve conceded, hands up in defeat. “But even if that’s what I want, I don’t know how to date in the 21st century. And I’m not exactly connected with anyone outside of the Avengers.”
Tony stared at Bucky—mouth hanging open in awe and cheeks burning red. His brain was repeating what he had just heard over and over and over again. He was not a stranger to men and women fawning over him. And even though his ego was usually just an act, he knew that people tended to feel a draw towards him. But for some strange reason he never expected that to happen to Steve. In the best moments of their friendship, Tony had just assumed they were drawn together because of shared experiences—living the life of an Avenger was not something many people could relate to. But this new information, Bucky saying that Steve eagerly talked about him when he wasn’t around—and to his best friend of all people—had him euphoric. And a little baffled, if he was being honest.
It was a toss up between the two of them for who was more surprised that Steve had closed the distance between them and captured Tony’s lips in a kiss. But despite freezing for the briefest of seconds, Tony easily melted into it. And the ease of the kiss quickly turned into eagerness and desperation for more.
“I guess I didn’t notice because I thought they always did that. Do you think they’ve finally come to their senses? I hope not—that would mean Sam won the money pot.”
Besides, this was not just about who Steve was or wasn’t, this was about the likelihood of him dating Tony Stark. And who were Nat and Sam kidding? Tony could have literally anyone he wanted, why would he even want Steve? A meager text message would have any suitor speeding their way towards the Tower for a date with Tony.
They fit together perfectly. Tony’s legs wrap around Steve, pulling him in deeper, and throws his head back in pleasure. It doesn’t take long for both of them to start coming undone at the seams. This is their first time together, after all, and the sensations are overwhelming. The strength of their emotional connection surging through them is what sends both of them toppling over the edge.
Tony pulled away, both of them breathless, Steve’s eyes half-lidded. He looked confused, a little worried, at Tony’s breaking away so suddenly. It made Tony’s stomach clench, knowing that Steve could read him so well and tell something was wrong that quickly.
Steve leaned forward a bit, lightly kissing Tony’s forehead. “I love your brain. Your genius brain that creates things that make the world a better place—that literally saves the world. And your smile—god—I would do anything to see you smile,” he says, kissing Tony’s cheek near his lips.
Later that evening, when he finally regained consciousness, Tony would try and remember the things that occurred. He was not sure how long it took the following events to happen, but it had to have happened in under a minute.
“Bucky, Nat, and I will take care of the bots on the ground. We need you and Carol to deal with Avengers Tower. But you have to be cautious. We don’t know what the situation is like since Stane wiped out Friday’s system inside.”
Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey. It means the world to me. I hope you enjoyed it! I definitely poured bits of myself into this fic. And it is the first multi-chapter fic I have ever written or tried to write. I learned a lot during this process. Please continue to give it love and share it with any other SteveTony fans out there. I love you all. <3
“Because you literally did something badass and then something really stupid back-to-back,” Bucky chided, but he was met with a flat look from Steve.
“My point is—the rest of us are tired of your pining and love-sick puppy dog eyes every time Tony isn’t looking,” she explained. “So, I’m going to need you to ask him out already.”
“No, I just know you. And everyone in this damn place seems to forget I’m trained to notice these things in people,” she chuckled. “I see things no one else does.”
“I took Peter home this morning so you don’t have to worry about him,” Nat started, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees. She looked concerned.
When Steve got back to his room he spent longer in the shower than usual. He rested his head against the tile and let the hot water spray over him until the bathroom was a sauna. It almost felt good to have his skin singed by the scalding water. It almost took his mind off his worry for Tony.
Immediately, Tony retreated to his workshop—his ultimate place of solace and comfort. Whenever he needed to figure something out he took refuge there. He started to work on updates to his suit in hopes of distracting himself from the implications of what Bucky said. Tony was an expert at avoiding his emotions and his primary tactic was burying himself in work, but his thoughts kept nagging at him this time. Eventually he gave up trying to work, sitting at his bench with blue holographic renderings all around him, staring blankly beyond them.
Something in the far back corner of Tony’s brain said this was not a good idea. It was the same voice he easily silenced back in the restaurant over an hour ago. But now the alcohol all but drowned it out.
Tony tactfully slotted his leg between Steve’s—pressing his thigh against the prominent arousal in Steve’s pants. Steve let out a gasp that melted into a moan and Tony took the opportunity to draw him into another kiss. Except Tony was insistent on being rougher as he nipped at Steve’s lips, biting his bottom lip and pulling at it.
Tony spiraled so deep into his worries that he did not hear Rhodey enter the workshop. He practically jumped out of his skin when Rhodey spoke up.
“Alright—listen up. My entire life Steve, I have sat back and watched time and time again how you make yourself out to be unworthy of the affection of whoever you’ve got feelings for at the time,” Bucky was pointing a finger in Steve’s face, continuing, “And I’m sick of someone talking about my best friend that way. You think everyone is better than you. You think Tony and his fancy gadgets and futuristic mindset are all too good for you. But you’re wrong, Steve. Sure, you two are different in a lot of ways—you’re something old, he’s something new,” Bucky explained, entirely too pleased with himself for the joke.
When their drinks arrived Tony downed his in an act of desperation. The taste of it on his tongue felt familiar and right, despite his two months of sobriety, he suddenly could not imagine a moment longer without it. Its spicy warmth trailed from the tip of his tongue to the bottom of his belly—it was comforting. It was liquid safety. The buzz reverberated throughout his veins. God, this felt good.
“Oh my god—I’ve failed you as a 21st century guide,” Tony whined. “Friday, queue up the first Harry Potter. Steve—you’re in for a treat. Well, actually, pretend you have no idea who Strange is and then you’ll be in for a treat.”
He swallowed hard and looked at his folded hands in his lap. His body was shaking but he decided to pretend it wasn’t—he didn’t have time to think about the depths of how hard this was for him.
He considered indulging himself—letting his fantasies come to life, remembering the feel of Steve’s lips against his, and sliding his hand into his pants. He was able to consider this for less than a minute before the crippling fear of his inadequacies overwhelmed his fantasies. His anxieties—the deep seated fear that he ruined everything he touched—tumbled down like an avalanche. They suffocated out any semblance of hope.
“They’ve started? Aw man—come on Tony, we gotta go look,” Peter exclaimed, leaping to his feet and rushing outside with Steve and Tony close behind.
“Well, even if she didn’t, the rest of the world was screaming about it. I do have an iPhone, Steve. And I actually know how to use mine,” Bucky said. “Go on.”
“Tony—what’s wrong? I literally just told you the Tiberius situation was handled, there’s a restraining order saying he cannot come anywhere near you, any Stark or Avengers properties, or Morgan,” Pepper sighed. “I don’t understand.”
“That traitor—wait—which one was it? My A.I. or my former best friend?” Tony snapped, staring at him accusingly.
When Tony woke up the next morning Steve had already left his room and his headache was so severe he couldn’t see straight.
Steve crossed the room to where Tony was. He stood tall and confident—emitting all of this Captain America energy. When he came to stand next to Tony the suits trying to get something out of him visibly shrank. Steve knew how to make his presence intimidating when he needed to, but thankfully Tony somehow knew it was not directed at him. Instead, Tony seemed to have formed an amused smirk at Steve’s antics and overprotectiveness.
Sometimes, in his weakest moments, Steve imagined how things might have turned out if he had been honest with Tony about his parents long before they ever got to Siberia. He knew, without the shadow of a doubt, that Tony would have forgiven Bucky. He would have known it was Hydra and that Bucky was a pawn in their scheme.
Thank you for reading! I promise, while it is still a bumpy road ahead, it starts looking up from here. And the next chapter will have some very soft Tony and Steve moments together.
The further Steve spiraled into the cycle of shame for how he hurt Tony, the faster he ran, as if his pace could help him outrun his regrets.
Bucky walked over, gently zipping her up and brushing her flowing red hair over one shoulder. He bent down and kissed the exposed side of her neck and hummed.
Ultimately, he knew Bucky and Nat were right. He was tired of waiting and wondering what could possibly happen between him and Tony. Literal decades of intense glances, sharing beds on missions with tension radiating between them, and all the moments in-between had finally come to a head. Steve finally had a chance to see if they could build a romantic life together. And yes, they both had their fears, but Steve was not one to let fear hold him back. Hell—if he could face off against Thanos he could talk to Tony about what was going on between them.
Granted, he had woken up in Steve’s arms, warm in his blankets with the sunlight softly spilling in from the window across from his bed.
“Stupid, I know,” Nat continued. “But now that’s hardly the point. So, he’s always been jealous and then you and this man, who not only murdered his parents, but stole you away from him tag team jump him in Siberia—nearly kill him—I mean. Yeah, that’s a hard wound to stitch up after one good conversation.”
“Ty must have leaked the story. He must have taken a photo when I was passed out for blackmail,” he replied. “That’s the only thing that makes sense. I mean, hell, he runs a media conglomerate. He has probably orchestrated this whole thing.”
This chapter is dedicated to the lovely @Nan_Yelo on Twitter. My Winghead. My idea partner. Thank you for all your support.
Yeah, no, that’s too much. Especially since he had no proof that he was the problem, but he couldn’t help but see the facts in front of him. And they pointed his way.
“I know I just—I guess I want to fix this on my own. I don’t like being dependent on other people. And I don’t want to be a burden—with my bullshit, my mistakes—I know this is a disease and I shouldn’t be as mad at myself as I am—but I am.”
“Yes, I can see that,” Steve mused. “And I can venture to guess that you have not moved from this spot all day and therefore, you need to eat.”
“I’m glad we didn’t have sex last night. I want to do this right. You, me—date night. Dress nice, I’m taking you out on a proper date tonight,” Tony said. He slipped out of Steve’s arms, kissing him on the cheek, before confidently sauntering off to his walk-in closet.
But there was that simultaneous feeling that in some way he would ruin Morgan’s life if he and Pepper did not work things out and stay together.
“Okay, okay!” Peter held his hands up in surrender. “I’m just sayiiiiing, it’s better to do something than wonder what would have happened. It’s better to do something before it’s too late. I mean—you’re both superheroes, you almost die all the time.”
“Alright, well I guess that means I gotta give my gift old Winter the Boy Wonder, huh?” Sam said, walking over to the tree and tossing a present at Bucky’s head but he caught it before it hit him. Inside was a first edition print of Agatha Christie’s The Mysterious Affair at Styles that was in near mint condition. Bucky looked up at Sam with mouth open and wide eyes.
“That was a lot of information at once, man,” Bucky said. “Way to go for punching Stone—he deserved more than that, but way to go. Next, you’re an idiot.”
“The fact that something has clearly happened between Steve and Tony, but no one has said anything about it,” Natasha sighed.
Sam’s words cut him to the core, because he knew they were true. And Sam was not the first person to say that to him within the last month—within the last 24 hours, even. Bucky, Nat, and Wanda had all echoed similar sentiments.
“Thank you, Sam,” Bucky said. He gave his Secret Santa his gift—he had gotten Thor and gave him a special Wakandan polish that Shuri made to keep Stormbreaker clean. “She makes this stuff for my arm. So I figured it would be good to use on your giant axe, too.”
The next day they got another Assemble call for a Kree orchestrated Chitauri attack on Washington D.C. Previously, Tony had been certain that the Chitauri were long gone and would not be a problem again. Clearly he was wrong. Thankfully, their many encounters with them in the past made quick and easy work of ending the threat. This time it was him, Steve, Bruce, Thor, and Nat who answered the call. If he was being honest, this was his preferred team anyway, because of the history they shared. A bit of him ached knowing that Clint was no longer with them, but they were all still alive thanks to his great sacrifice, and everything they did honored him.
He walked over to his closet and pulled out a bottle of Sandeman 30 Year Old Tawny whiskey he had stashed away. There was no point in using a glass—he popped it open and drank straight from the bottle.
Why had he been anxious to meet Steve, all those years ago, when he first came up from the ice? Was it because Howard never shut up about him—his precious experiment—friend—the perfect hero? Was it because before Tony had ever met Steve it had already been engrained into his mind that he was perfect? Howard seemed convinced that Steve was flawless and Tony was anything but.
“Well then it is pretty pathetic we haven’t really talked about it before, huh? Instead we have both committed to being haunted by the same memories over just owning up to what went down. Having a real conversation like goddamn adults,” Tony scoffed, but then smiled a small smile.
“Sounds good, see ya later!” Tony shouted, pretending to busy himself behind one of his work benches.
“Actually—wait a minute—Bruce, I never explained it to you, did I? We got viciously attacked by Thanos’ monstrous space children before I could,” Tony continued, ignoring Nat and Steve, and standing. He walked over to stand in front of the couch and everyone on it—he was vibrating with energy.
His heart was swelling with joy at the sight. And there was a noticeable presence of butterflies in his abdomen. But instead of questioning these feelings he just let himself feel them, because, well—they felt
“You two have come a long way in the last year. Team meetings are almost pleasant. Tony actually listens to some of your orders—hey, some is better than none and we were batting none for a long time there,” Nat laughed, thoroughly amused by the look that crossed Steve’s face when she said ‘Tony’ and ‘listen’ in the same breath.
A short and simple brushing off what happened between them sufficed when the Time Heist was at stake, but that could only last for so long. In the weeks of the Time Heist they had worked together as partners better than ever before, but even those side-by-side victories could not undo the damage done by a shield in the chest.
“I’m an expertly trained assassin who has a specialty for reading other people and understanding them—picking them apart, knowing what makes a person tick just from one glance—so what were you saying, Steve?”
“No Tony—no. God,” Steve continued to sputter like a broken motor. His face was bright red and the blush was spreading down his neck. “Buck—he’s—he’s my best friend. We never—no. Never. There wasn’t any time for that and—there was Peggy back then.”
“Because I haven’t loved my ex-wife for a few years now and I pretended that I did. And the pretending wasn’t good enough, because even though we have a daughter, it still fell apart—and that’s all my fault,” Tony spat out, surprised by how little resistance he felt finally confessing this all.
“Yeah—yeah, you could say that,” Tony admitted. “Hey—wait a minute, you’ve got to tell me. How the hell do you know?”
Never mind—she was a traitor, too. Steve shot her a look that he hoped communicated his anger and his intention on yelling at her later. She just shrugged.
“It was nothing Friday couldn’t handle. She deleted every trace of it off the internet—and will continue to monitor and delete anything else that comes up—and we have effectively shown how slimy and unreliable Mysterio is—should be good to go.”
“Yeah, I’m sure that’s it,” she added, her tone sarcastic and teasing. In moments like these Steve could smack her—she always knew more than she was ever willing to let on. But what could he expect from an assassin trained in discerning every detail about her targets? It was just never fun to be on the receiving end of those all-knowing eyes.
“You’re safe. It’s okay. It’s just me now.  Me and you, here, safe,” Steve said. Tony’s hyperventilating began to slow, but he could still feel his heart racing.
After Steve stabbed his shield into Tony’s chest he had felt his heart actually shatter under the weight of that moment. It was a break up—the worst one he had ever experienced.
Steve promptly dropped down to sit next to him, flashing Tony a smile before looking over at Peter and Morgan racing around. Tony’s heart was pounding loudly in his ears. He was certain that his crush was painfully obvious, especially now with Steve sitting so close that their knees were touching, and that Steve would notice any second and run away.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re lucky you’re pretty and that my daughter idolizes you or else you’d be in trouble,” Tony teased, bumping Steve’s arm with his elbow.
Bruce gave his Secret Santa his present next—he had drawn Scott’s name and gotten him a canvas print of his favorite photo with Cassie and Hope. It made Scott bawl his eyes out for several minutes before he was able to compose himself and grab his gift to give. He handed Nat a gift bag (because he could not wrap to save his life) and inside it was an exquisite emerald Russian shawl—it had crimson roses and golden embroidery throughout.
“I’ve been hoping that no one would notice, you know? My uh, drinking, that is. And then Pepper told you guys, I didn’t even get to tell you guys—my family, on my own terms, and I sort of spiraled even further. I’m not great at not being in control, Cap, I’m not sure if you’ve noticed that before.”
“Okay, that’s a lot of new information for us to take in, Steve,” she said. “Why didn’t you tell us before?”
Down on the ground Steve and Thor were fighting back-to-back—Stormbreaker in Thor’s hands and Mjolnir in Steve’s. The Chitauri did not stand a chance against their coordinated attacks and swings. The lightning show was magnificent from above—Tony was constantly in awe by Thor’s thunderous might and now Steve’s, too. Part of him resented Steve’s worthiness for wielding the god ordained hammer, but the other part of him was not surprised by it in the slightest. If anyone besides Thor was worthy, it was Steve Rogers.
“I s’pose I’m not in love with her anymore, either, and that I agree. It’s better for it to be over. I don’t want Morgan to grow up in a household like the one I grew up in—Howard was always yelling at mom—they were so unhappy.”
“Tony,” Steve said, making his presence known. The other man nearly jumped several feet in the air as he spun to look at Steve, eyes wide, and heart pounding.
“You should always expect a maniac to attack you while you are peacefully at home! Have you learned nothing from dating me?!” Tony shrieked.
This was his third AA meeting and he still had yet to share anything personal beyond his name and that he was an alcoholic. He had spent the previous two meetings listening to politicians, actors, and other various people who held public positions of some sort moan about the difficulties of their lives.
The photo that accompanied the story was of Tony in bed, clearly naked under the covers, with bottles of alcohol on the nightstand in the background.
“No, but crawling out of the bottle by yourself with your willpower alone, that’s impressive. Do I still think you should get professional help? Yes. But your willingness to have that difficult conversation with Steve—to start making things right—even though you feel like shit—I admire that."
Tony had been avoiding Bucky ever since he snapped in front of him and the others. He knew that even though most of his comments were pointed at Steve that the other man inevitably felt terrible about the entire situation, too. God—Siberia and the Avengers Civil War—that’s what the press had called it—felt like so long ago. But even though it happened years ago, he and Bucky had never cleared the air. Hell, he had yet to even have a full conversation with him. Tony knew it was because of his own childish jealousy and the grudge he held—no matter how hard he tried to let it go—that he refused to fully acknowledge Bucky’s existence. He was letting him live under his roof—the compound—and paid for his food, his new gear—wasn’t that good enough?
Steve laid awake all night with his ears eagerly listening for Tony. He knew it was not his responsibility to keep Tony away from the bar cart in the kitchen, but he felt the need to try. Plus, someone would probably need to restrain Tony’s drunken rage when he discovered Nat had removed all the alcohol and hidden it away.
At the same time, Steve had his own fears and insecurities. He had been doing his best to stamp them down, but seeing Tony run away after their kiss had reignited them stronger than before. Ever since he had met him in 2012, Steve had felt less than Tony—Tony, who was everything good and amazing about the future, was way out of Steve’s league.
Now there were years of time and space between the hostility of the early days and where they were now, but one thing remained the same: Tony’s infinite intelligence. Steve did not think of himself as dumb, his awe of Tony’s own brain was not done out of comparison or self-deprecation. In fact, Steve was confident in his own mind, his ability as a tactician, and his willingness to learn anything new. No—his fascination for Tony’s expansive mind was pure and honest enchantment.
“I have an idea, but he won’t like it very much,” Nat said, breaking Steve out of his train of thought.
“How much a person should spend on a Secret Santa gift,” Tony grumbled. “I say we are allowed to spend whatever we want to.”
“You’re right. I’m exhausted anyway,” he said. “Alright ladies and gents, it has been a wonderful evening, but I’m off to sleep for ten, maybe twelve, hours.”
“My, my, that’s quite the praise coming from ego-maniac Stark,” Sam laughed, patting Steve on the back.
“Yeah, didn’t think so. Your crush ain’t on Tinder anyway,” Bucky commented, opening the fridge and taking out a plum.
It took a few minutes for Steve to work up the courage to start this conversation with Tony. Anxiety was not something he had felt often in his life, but whenever he did, he found it usually involved Tony. He was someone incredibly important to Steve—so important that he was sure he had failed to ever properly articulate the gravity of Tony’s significance in his life. And ever since the battle at Hydra’s Siberian facility, Steve felt compelled to handle his relationship with Tony as if it were the most precious and fragile thing on earth.
“You do know there is a Stark Industries gala coming up in a few weeks, right?” Nat asked, casually slipping it into conversation over breakfast as if Steve had not been thinking about the gala for months ahead of time.
“My mom—she was pretty epic. Brilliant and strong. She taught me how to be a good person,” he replied, smiling at the thought.
Steve paused, wondering if he really should elaborate or if it was too risky to keep bringing this up with everyone he talked to today. Just a couple hours earlier he had discussed it with Wanda too. It was probably a mistake to keep discussing the same topic with everyone in the Avengers, because he knew word spread fast, and some secrets rarely stayed secrets among his friends. Gossip was a hot commodity.
“Tony has had the hots for you since 2012—and now that he’s single that desire is a raging wildfire, my friend. You were reading the signals correctly, but Tony Stark hates himself and probably convinced himself you are going to reject him. So, he ran away,” Bucky explained. “You shoulda kissed him, man.”
Tony slipped his sunglasses back on and flopped onto his back, folding his arms behind his head. He basked in the sun and the peacefulness of the moment. A life like this was one he could get used to.
And even though Steve had acclimated to the future, that was mostly due to Tony giving him a home in a new century, and that made him feel like a relic of the past. Tony deserved someone as sleek, suave, and brilliant as he was—hell, Pepper was certainly all of those things and more. Over the years, Steve had tried small, albeit pathetic attempts, to prove to Tony that he was also all of those things. His mild attempts ranged from wearing leather jackets to quoting modern movies he knew Tony loved.
It was still achingly fresh in his mind—the moment they all came back to 2023 and Nat, falling to her knees, sobbing. Steve was certain her tears did not stop for days while Tony, Bruce, and Rocket worked on building the Iron Gauntlet.
“I apologize—I did not realize it would open up a wound. I had thought he and Steve had reconciled,” Thor replied, frowning. It was apparent he felt guilt as if it were genuinely his fault.
“Yes, and it will remain super secret in order to guarantee maximum levels of surprise that will result in awesome sex later,” Tony smirked, relishing the bright blush that grew on Steve’s cheeks.
Were the only trains of thought racing in Steve’s mind, but a sudden spark of inspiration—a way to turn the tables on Tony—came to mind.
Christmas time arrives for the Avengers, so Scott and Sam decide that this year there should be a proper Christmas party. Which means Secret Santa, mistletoe, and other antics.
This was the moment—the big one—where Tony finally realized what he meant to Steve. And the gravity of it was not lost on him—his stomach was full of butterflies and he was fairly certain his hands were sweaty.
“Thanks—you’ve uh, given me a lot to think about,” Tony whispered, still staring at his feet, afraid of the intimacy of this space. But he genuinely did have thoughts to chew on after Adam’s response.
“Thank you, Pep,” he finally choked out, pretending his voice was not raspy. He kissed her hands and rested his forehead on them for a moment. “You don’t know how badly I needed to hear that.”
“Pepper—no, it is my fault you were in harm’s way—I’m so sorry. I ruined our marriage—our family—and then suggested you move there and put you right in the middle of a beacon for terrorism—I’m so sorry—“
Natasha was an oxymoron—both incredibly gentle in her love for her friends but completely capable of tough love when necessary. This was one of those tougher moments, Tony figured.
When Stane fired off his second repulsor blast his aim had significantly improved. The memory was blurred with the image of Carol’s fiery photon blast, Steve’s body and shield jumping in front of him, and the Iron Man armor flying away.
However, the ache in his chest was an entirely different feeling but he pushed it to the side for later.
“Pepper—god, where is your Rescue armor?” he asked, scolding, but also trying to find viable solutions.
“She’s out with Happy—they went out—for ice cream. They’re at a safe location now—Friday let them know what was going on,” Pepper explained, breathless.
“When in doubt, go to dinner with Rhodey, that’s what I always say,” Tony sang, slinging his arm around his best friend as they walked into their favorite restaurant.
A week later, Tony greeted Happy and Morgan outside the compound as they drove up for Morgan’s day visit with her dad. She ran into his arms and he stood up and spun her around.
The look Steve gave him was so intense it made his heart and stomach tangle together in the middle of his chest. It was a shared glance simultaneously full of genuine gratitude and something much deeper and far more complicated that Tony was able to process in this instant.
“Grown-up conversation, huh? You know I hate those?” Tony grumbled, swinging his legs over the side of the bed and sitting up. He scrubbed his hands over his face in preparation for whatever Pepper might lob at him next.
“Thanks, Cap,” he hummed, sipping the coffee and observing the food before him. “I’d say he’s mastered breakfast. It took a decade, but he did it.”
“Oh—and one other thing—if you hurt him,” Rhodey didn’t bother continuing, he just raised his eyebrows at Steve and crossed his arms.
He slowed his pace as he reached one of the main doors to the compound. Though he was not really out of breath, he hunched over, hands on his knees, breathing in deeply. He figured he probably ran over ten miles and it was only sunrise.
“You care?” Tony asked, forcing out a laugh. “You? Captain America—care—about me? Since when? I don’t remember you fucking caring about
Before Tony could even breathe another word, Steve’s lips were against his. Steve’s mouth was open and wet and desperate as he poured every ounce of his emotions into the action. Suddenly, that nagging voice in the back of Tony’s head telling him he wasn’t good enough for this was overridden by primal desire and the deliciousness of Steve’s plush lips moving against his. He wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, holding him close, and arching his body against the taller man’s.
“If it makes you feel any better—I totally plan on using the money you put in my bank account,” Sam offered.
“Ty—“ Tony started, looking alarmed and reaching across the table to grab his friend’s arm. But Tiberius stared him down, raising his eyebrows, and waiting to see if Tony would continue his protest. It was Tony who backed down. “Okay.”
“Unfortunately,” Tony chuckled. “Happy won’t shut up about her. But go him—your Aunt May is a—nevermind.” Peter’s disgusted look stopped Tony is his tracks.
Tony’s eyes wandered over to the boxing ring in the center of the room where Steve and Bucky were currently sparring. He was hyper aware of the ways that Bucky was making Steve laugh and smile, even in the middle of a spar, with ease. It seemed so natural—their interactions, the laughter, and their ability to anticipate the other’s next move as they fought.
She leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees, and gripping one of Steve’s knees with her hand—she squeezed it tightly. “You know Tony, but you’re acting like you don’t.”
Tony took a deep breath. The nausea lingered in the periphery but otherwise he felt fine. Finally, he emerged from his refuge and made his way into the living room. Relief washed over him when he found only Nat, Rhodey, and Steve there. He was not ready to face Bucky or anyone else. At least with these three he felt safe—comfortable.
Steve clasped his hands together in a praying form and apologized before walking into the room. Natasha just rolled her eyes before retreating back to her room.
“What? I don’t think I’ve shared it with the class yet. You know what—even if I have—fuck it. Yeah, Buckaroo over there murdered my parents. What a trip, right? God—I can only imagine how furious Howard would be now. Me, housing his murderer and an ex-Hydra operative,” Tony laughed darkly.
Steve was in his boxers, Tony in pajama pants and a t-shirt. Either they didn’t have sex or they did and decided to get dressed after—which was not Tony’s usual post-coitus protocol unless he had somewhere to be.
“Tony, I know it can be hard to share how you’re doing or what brought you here. But at the end of the day you are only going to get out of this what you put into it. If you put nothing into it, you get nothing. And I know you’re not the type of man that wants to waste his time.”
Tony was on anxiety medication for a reason. Between PTSD and the chemical defects in his mind—medication was an absolute must. But even with the regulation his medicine provided, nothing was a cure all. In his worst moments, Tony still spiraled down anxious trains of thoughts and got lost in them. It just so happened that any romantic topic was something he was extremely susceptible to become anxious.
Steve left Tony’s workshop feeling incredibly defeated and frustrated with himself. How did Tony not automatically understand the implications of that gift? But even he could hear Bucky’s laughter in the back of his head telling him he never knew how to ask people out correctly. He should have known.
She scoffed and Tony knew better than that—he knew he couldn’t throw her off his trail now that she had seen his jealousy written across his face.
“Yes, that happens when you have an Italian mother,” Tony teased. “I’m surprised you haven’t heard me use it before.”
Steve was on Tony’s side of the table in what seemed to be faster than the speed of light, holding him and looking as concerned as ever.
“Tony—Tony, I understand, I do,” Steve started, holding his hand up to ask Tony to pause. “If you think you’re alone in that, you’re not. What went down between us—it plagues my every waking moment.”
“Petey said there’s a meteor shower tonight! And that if we went up on that hill over there,” she stuck out a tiny finger to point at the top of the walking trail to their left. “We could see it really nice!”
Tony was great at giving extravagant gifts—giant bunnies or new cars were his go-to. Or even better, when he had been with Pepper she had gotten accustomed to just purchasing whatever she genuinely wanted with his credit card. But neither of those things would work for this Secret Santa situation. Steve was not the type of man to be wooed by expensive gifts and Tony could not just hand over his credit card—that communicated none of the feelings he was hoping for.
Steve knew he was not responsible for Tony’s sobriety. He was not responsible for anything Tony did or did not do. But he could not shake the feeling of failure that washed over him. If only he could have been there—been more for Tony—maybe, then this would not have happened. Then Tiberius would have never made his way into Tony’s bed. And Tony’s sobriety would still be intact.
“I fuck everything up when it comes to romance, you know that. You’ve been with me through almost all of it. My only successful long-term relationship ended in divorce.” Tony ran a shaking hand through his hair and let out a loud sigh. “And I can’t mess this up, not with him.”
The other part of him, the one that made his heart stop, was secretly elated to see Steve’s abs before him—still glistening from the shower. Tony gaped at him.
When they were in the elevator heading up from the garage under the compound, Steve finally broke the silence.
For Tony beating the shit out of this punching bag was cathartic—with every hit he pounded out another anxious thought. He finally had the motivation to turn to healthier coping mechanisms and goddamn it, he was going to get the most out of them. But he’d be lying if he said it wasn’t also partly to avoid having to talk to any of his friends about how he was doing.
He slipped into the other side of the bed, staring up at the ceiling, listening intently to Tony’s breathing. After a few minutes his breath evened out and softened. Steve smiled, quietly pleased that his presence was able to soothe him. An hour later sleep was victorious over him as well.
“Fair point, but,” Tony sighed. “Rhodey, you know this is different. What? It is. It is. Because we’re the Avengers—we’re on a team—we have a…complicated history. And that’s putting it lightly. And—well, Cap isn’t exactly from this decade, even. He didn’t grow up—I mean—I know he isn’t homophobic, he isn’t capable of that kind of thing. But—I’m pretty sure he’s straight. Like, ninety percent sure, anyway. He’s only ever brought women around—and by that I mean Sharon anyway, because it took years for him to even get over Peggy—and.”
He rolls over, laying beside Tony, who cradles his face and gives him messy kisses. They lazily clean up their mess, whispering sweet nothings, and lulling into sleep in one another’s arms.
The clock across the room eventually came into focus—it was just after noon. That meant it was approximately twelve hours after they have gotten the assemble call for Stane’s attack on the Tower. God—where had the time gone? How did he end up here?
“The night is still young. They’ll notice we’re missing soon,” Tony said. It made his heart drop, but it was reality.
“And I know she said she fell out of love with me too—but I can’t help but feel that was a reaction to me. To the ways I distanced myself. I mean—I’ll always love her, she’s one of my best friends—but I haven’t loved her the way in a long time. And I think I hate myself for that failure as a husband.”
“So, you wanna talk about that or?” Nat prodded, leaning in closer to keep their voices down. “I mean—you do know Bucky is my boyfriend, right?”
“Okay—listen, I know we don’t usually do big parties because—well, actually, I don’t know why we don’t,” Scott said, frowning. “They’re great. A great idea. And don’t worry—we will do Secret Santa so there’s no pressure to spend money on everyone. Tony—that’s especially a warning for you. Only a present for the one name you draw.”
“And I loved sharing it with you. Thank you—uh, thank you for wanting to be apart of it,” Tony replied, his own cheeks finally going red from the sweetness of Steve’s words and the intensity of his blue eyes locked on him. The elevator dinged and opened up to the main floor hallway and Tony mustered up some semblance of courage, grabbing onto Steve’s hand, and leading him towards his suite. His heart was thudding in his ears and he was pretty sure his palms were sweaty, but if they were, Steve took pity on him and didn’t mention it.
“Can you uh…can you stay here? In my room, I mean? I don’t…I don’t want to be alone,” he asked, voice small, timid—two things Steve had never associated with Tony’s voice before.
“No offense Tones, but you can’t hide anything from me. I’ve watched you hook up with everyone who would give verbal consent all throughout college and beyond. I’ve been at your side through countless relationships, both good and bad. But there have only been three people you have ever had a major crush on but refused to act on it, because for some goddamn reason you’d rather pine after them like an idiot,” Rhodey revealed.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Steve whispered, captivated by the warm and loving expression Tony was wearing.
It wasn’t until Tony reached to pour himself a glass of water that Peter noticed the glint of gold on his ring finger.
When Tony sat down on a barstool at the kitchen island, Steve handed him a mug full of coffee and placed a plate of food in front of him. Tony smiled happily up at him, still shrouded in sleepiness, and barely functioning.
Steve finally loosened up and let out a laugh. He grabbed Nat’s hand off his knee and squeezed it back. Slight waves of relief washed over him and the guilty fire in his belly subsided.
Steve crossed the room to stand right in front of Tony and it wasn’t until Steve’s fingers were gently wiping away tears that Tony realized he was crying. When did that happen? But Steve’s touch was gentle and it made his stomach flip—he leaned into it without meaning to and closed his eyes. He couldn’t run from this—not here—it was at the surface now, how he felt for Steve, his fear and feelings of unworthiness. It was time to deal with it all.
The door to the restaurant opened and jingled the bell in the doorway. Steve and Tony sauntered in, entirely unbothered by their late arrival, hand in hand.
“So do you, Tony. You know, relaxation looks good on you,” Steve responded. “You should try it more.”
Rhodey sat there, staring at Tony evenly, giving his words considerable thought. Something in his eyes told Tony he knew—or had an inkling. He secretly hoped Rhodey would play coy. Maybe for once he would not call Tony out on his shit. Tony was not certain he was capable of stating it explicitly. If Rhodey asked—would the name leave his lips? It was only earlier today that Tony had decided his attraction may mean a little more than thinking Steve had a nice ass—that there might be legitimate feelings attached. This was a fresh idea. One that Tony had yet to explore every aspect of and one that felt scary. Saying Steve’s name out loud—admitting that it was him—it made it real. Tangible. More than just a thought that Tony could bury away if need be. It let someone else in on the secret—which also made it more likely the information could slip out.
“Yeah, of course you don’t, this got you out of school,” Sam countered, smacking him on the back of the head. Peter let out an overdramatic yelp.
“Thank you guys. You’re right—I feel better, really,” Steve said, smiling and looking between his two friends. “I would be lost without you two.”
Tony could not hold back the laughter that erupted from his chest—the entire team had caught Steve and Thor’s exchange over the coms. Joy was bubbling in his chest—which was an odd feeling to experience in the middle of a fight—but he had not been able to shake his high spirits since he woke up.
“Steve,” Sam said, exasperated. He set the glass down and leaned forward on the kitchen’s island, to give Steve a stern look in the eyes, as he stood on the other side. “You’re a hopeless romantic at heart. You went into the water in love with Peggy and woke up alone. You’re lonely because you miss romantic companionship. I’m not an idiot—you kissed Sharon right in front of me.”
“You know how he gets in his head about things. You know how, despite his exterior confident attitude, he’s often very anxious and insecure about things. You know that he thinks his divorce with Pepper was all his fault. Now, what can you deduce based off of all those things?”
But it was also very worrying to have Tony in charge of it—to have no idea what was coming his way or how to be prepared for it.
Tony’s head snapped up from his work station and he dropped the screwdriver that was in his hand. He stumbled over a box of tools on the floor as he tried to pick up the item he dropped. Suddenly, Steve’s behaviors from earlier made a bit more sense and Tony flushed at the thought.
“Come on kid, let’s go chat,” Tony said, walking over and wrapping an arm around Peter’s shoulders to steer him back into the bedroom.
From there the evening devolved into a vicious game of Monopoly that ended with Nat victorious and Tony and Rhodey arguing that she cheated. Steve was grateful that they were all able to settle back into normal conversation and banter after his odd exchange with Tony. And when Nat and Rhodey shared looks that communicated things he did not understand, he elected to ignore them. It felt too amazing to be watching Tony laugh and finally let loose for him to be concerned with the others hyper-analyzing his every move.
And after Pepper called it all made sense to him. He was devastated on Tony’s behalf. And furious on his behalf, too.
“Hey, Mr. Self-Sacrifice, no moving for you yet. You’ve got that giant nasty wound on your left thigh and it just got stitched up. You rip that sucker open and it only gets worse from there.”
Another silence stretched out between them, Tony’s resolved faltering a bit before he squared up his shoulders and stood as tall as he could manage. Steve felt his chest tighten, preparing for the impending blows that were going to be hurled his way. Tony was a professional verbal boxer and Steve knew that if they were going to get anywhere, he would have to be the one to stay level headed.
“One second,” Tony said, out of breath, as he reached over to his side table drawer. After a moment too long of fumbling around, he pulled out a bottle of lube with a sigh of relief. He squirted some on his hand before wrapping it around both of their lengths together. Steve’s body stuttered forward, uncontrollably thrusting into Tony’s hand, which earned moans from both of them.
“Okay,” Steve whispered, tentatively bracing himself for the worst. Hell hath no fury like an angry Natasha.
Tony was struck by how beautiful Steve’s eyes looked. Upon noticing the depth and wonder of Steve’s eyes, his heart skipped a beat, a sensation he actively chose to ignore for the moment. There was something swimming in his eyes, beyond the emotion of their apologies, and Tony was mentally fumbling to figure it out. And just when he thought his fingertips were about to grasp it—
And sure enough, the next evening, Thor burst into the living room with a bushy tree 9 feet tall. It was placed in the corner near the large bay window so that its sparking lights could be seen from outside. Sam and Scott followed closely behind Thor, carrying several boxes of decorations—from ornaments to lights to garlands. The group got to work immediately. Bucky served everyone non-alcoholic warm spiced apple cider while Scott, Sam, and Natasha diligently wrapped the tree in shimmering white lights.
“Yeah—figured you’d have noticed that. And yet, when everything in my life goes to shit, instead I’ve looked for ways to feel out of control. Funny, isn’t it? Alcohol lets me be loose, not feel, not care. It stops the mental spiral about my failings as a husband and a father, but let’s other things bubble up to the surface. Yesterday, you were trying to help me, and I’m grateful for that. But the alcohol melted away my filter and I guess, despite my best attempts, I’m still hurting.”
“I know, but can’t we just stay like this a little longer?” Steve asked, not bothering to hide the desperation in his voice.
Steve quieted his teasing by capturing his lips in a soft, early morning kiss. Tony eagerly wrapped himself around Steve’s body, his hands getting tangled in that beautiful blonde hair, successfully distracted from his previous complaints. Just as the kiss started getting indecent, Friday’s voice broke them apart: “Boss, you have a Stark Industries meeting in an hour. Ms. Potts has included in this reminder that you must be there—or else.”
She popped up from behind the large gray couch in the far corner. The scene felt all too familiar to the attack at the Miami house. Pepper was covered in soot, blood, and sweat. He was at her side in an instant, steadying her, and scanning her for any serious injuries. Thank god there were none.
“Steve!” he shouted. There was no time to panic or figure out why he had bothered calling the other man over, because Steve was at his side in a second.
“Yeah—that sucked. A lot,” Peter grimaced. “How did you, uh, undo the whole…revealing my identity thing?”
Finally, Peter looked over at Steve and Tony with the same goofy, amazed expression on his face. It was clear that the kid had only ever lived in the city and never got to see Christmas decorating to this degree. That had been the point of it all—yes, Tony wanted to surprise the rest of the team and spoil them since Sam and Scott decided to make this such a big deal this year—but it was really all for Peter. The kid had not grown up with much in his life and Tony was determined to spoil and amaze him whenever he could.
“You’re not an idiot, but you’re acting like one,” she replied, rubbing her temples and closing her eyes. “Now, you know I love you, but I think it is time for some tough love, okay?”
Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t absolutely giddy to celebrate this way. He was actually surprised it took him until this late in life to do a showy Christmas—considering his predisposition towards grand gestures and glamour.
Steve shamelessly watched the sway of Tony’s hips as he walked away, but then it hit him—a proper date? He had taken Sharon on plenty of nice dates and they had gone well, but doing the same thing with Tony was entirely different. For all he knew, a ‘proper date’ with Tony meant a private jet to Italy and dinner at a Michelin 3-star restaurant.
“I know his dad had a problem with alcohol and Tony’s had his struggles in the past too, but I didn’t expect this—not now,” Bruce sighed. “I guess it goes to show it doesn’t matter what good things in your life you have that are worth fighting for—sometimes the depression inside you eats that all away from your mind.”
Tony led them out of the gallery, locking up before starting to walk down the street, Steve curiously following behind with a confused look on his face. It would be easy to let him in on the plan—they were just going to dinner now, after all—but Steve’s confused look was too cute to get rid of. They were heading to Bamonte’s, one of the older classic Italian restaurants in Brooklyn, that also happened to be right down the street from the gallery. Tony was nothing if not a strategic planner when he wanted to be.
Tony sat there, quietly appraising him. He should have known that Ty wanted to jump in bed with him the second he heard about his divorce. That’s what users and takers did—they used, they took.
He held out his hands, making grabby hands, with a large grin on his face. Steve could not help but chuckle as he gently placed the framed sketch in Tony’s palms. His heart pounded in his throat as he waited for Tony’s reaction.
Tony wasn’t sure if this was a date or a simple catch-up conversation. Either way, he could roll with it.
The desire pooling at the base of his stomach surged at the sight and he couldn’t resist sweeping his tongue along Steve’s bottom lip. The wanton groan that escaped Steve’s mouth only encouraged Tony to keep going. He gently bit his bottom lip and pulled, the hands on his hips squeezing noticeably tighter.
The room was crackling with electricity. The space between them was simultaneously a massive cavern and too small—suffocating. They were honed in on each other—everyone else melted away like they always did whenever they bantered or argued. Their gazes rested on one another—comfortable, familiar, and yet a little forbidden. Enticing. Everything they should say—that they wanted to say—remaining unspoken but undergirding each word.
He looked up from his daughter to see Pepper standing awkwardly just inside the door—she gave him a small smile.
“Yeah—I am,” he replied, staring up at Steve with his wide bambi eyes. Steve smiled sweetly down at him.
“Yeah, thanks Rhodey, but Steve is supposed to be Captain Obvious,” Nat groaned, hiding her face in her hands as Steve looked affronted. “What can we do?”
Inside the paper was a black art folder that contained several marvelous sketches of the Iron Man armor, Tony working in his workshop, Tony laughing with Morgan, and Tony with his arm around Peter. The detail was magnificent—they were utterly beautiful. Just as beautiful as the man who had drawn them. He looked over at Steve, mouth hanging open a bit, and eyes watering.
Bucky’s words haunted him for the rest of that day—even when he was sparring with Nat in the gym. At one point he got so lost replaying Bucky’s comment in his mind that Nat seamlessly landed a right hook.
Steve sat down, cracking open his sketchbook to a blank page, and got to work. Tony couldn’t resist stealing glances of Steve drawing—the way he pursed his lips, the smooth movements of the pencil against the paper—it was enchanting to watch him perform such a delicate task. After all, he was Captain America—all muscle and impeccable strength—and while the amazing work he did out on the battlefield could be considered its own art form this gentle hobby created a beautiful juxtaposition.
“Oh yes, that does sound familiar,” Tony grumbled. “Apparently I have a thing for hot blondes that also like to bully me into taking care of myself. Ridiculous.”
Everyone was hanging out in the living room after dinner—Thor, Rhodey, Bruce, Nat, Bucky, Tony, and Steve—and it had started out as a great idea. Tony wasn’t sure where it started going downhill, but once it began it blew up fast.
“I’m glad you took my wardrobe suggestion,” Nat said, appearing behind him out of nowhere. Tony jumped slightly and gave her a playful frown. “The black suit with the crimson shirt and black tie—quite literally a perfect look on you.”
“No—it felt very good. At least, I think so? We were so close to one another, if I had leaned down just a bit we could have kissed. It felt electric, but I think I was reading it incorrectly, because then Tony practically jumped across the couch away from me and started shoving food into his mouth. And then he kicked me out,” Steve rambled, barely breathing between words as it all tumbled out. Bucky smirked—Steve had always been like this about people he got feelings for—giddy and excitable as a teenager.
“What happened between us—Siberia, Bucky, the Accords—that’s never healed. Not really. Not properly. Sometimes—sometimes I wake up in a panic because I feel your shield slamming into my chest again. I don’t say that to upset you, Steve, but. I’ve got to be honest—of all the people in my life, I truly never expected that to happen between us. Not us. Never us. But then it was us—it did happen. And I don’t think I’ve ever found my footing again since then.”
“Natalia!” Ty exclaimed, sauntering into the kitchen on cue as if he had been listening in and waiting for the right time to show himself. “It has been too long.”
When he looked down, he saw Tony moaning in pain, clutching his side. The man was utterly delirious—far away from the present moment due to shock and agony. Dark crimson blood was seeping out over Tony’s fingers and onto the tile ground beneath him. It was an image that got seared into Steve’s mind—Tony, wounded below him and because of him, helpless and fading with each passing moment.
The tension visibly melted away from Tony’s body and he smiled. Up until this point the worst case scenarios had been reeling in his mind but he was pleasantly surprised for it to be going so well. Tony was not a stranger to difficult conversations, but having one with Bucky had felt dangerous and like he was treading on thin ice. But now Barnes sat across from him smiling warmly, forgiving his sins, and setting the tone for a better future between the two of them.
“Rhodey-bear, whatever do you mean?” Tony hummed, picking up a screwdriver and mindlessly tightening a bolt on his repulsor prototype.
But then he remembered—Tony wasn’t his. No matter how much he wanted him to be or how much Steve already felt like he was Tony’s. But it was Steve’s fault that he was here alone and not as Tony’s date. If he were Tony’s date then he would have every right to punch those asshole suits in the face—but he wasn’t.
“Alright, so what’s this about new web tech?” Tony asked. He decided to scream at him about Scorpion later.
Tony looked up at him, dark circles under his eyes, and sweat glistening all over his skin. He stared for a few long, hard moments as if he was not sure if Steve was real or not. His heart was pounding violently in his chest and his hands were trembling uncontrollably. Finally, he got the courage to speak up again, “No. Really bad nightmare. Really bad.”
Steve just laughed, stepping under the ropes and out of the ring. He wiped the sweat off of his brow and took a giant chug of water before responding to her.
“I used the resources at my disposal. I know an archivist or two as well as family genealogy experts. It was nothing—really, I promise,” Tony said, hands up in defense, expecting to be berated.
Tony yawned and stretched his body out, arms reaching way over his head and legs far out in front of him. He jumped to his feet and kissed Nat’s hand.
If only he had seen the inferiority of the machines below from the beginning—he would have been up here with Tony to begin with—he would have had his shield ready. He would have protected Tony like he was supposed to.
