“Kate—don’t—please,” he said as she moved in even closer. She nearly had him pinned against a wall. Steve almost felt pity for the kid.

“Run,” Kate agreed. The three of them rushed to the nearest staircase.

“NOTHING? NOTHING? WHAT’D YOU SLIP HER?” James kicked the guy in the ribs, and he groaned, falling flat to the ground.
For everyone curious about what happened with this story, and what happened with me, know that I am fine. My life situation changed quite a bit. I will update the story and finish it at some point, but I have no idea at what point that will be. I sincerely apologize to every reader of this story who has been left hanging for quite some time now. I am unwilling to give a timeline and possibly create further disappointment in doing so.

“Well? How could he? His wife’s dead. Dead, dead, dead. And so’s their baby. And their hopes and dreams and shit,” Tony said. He drained the bourbon. Steve gently took it out of his hands and put it on the bedside table.
“You know,” she said, “she reminds me of myself at that age sometimes.”

“Glad to know I haven’t quite sunk to that level just yet,” Stark said sardonically.
“Well, that’s comforting,” Tony muttered. “Are you going to be fighting me all the way to Manhattan?”
“No need to tell me that,” she said, thinking of Steve and Tony of 1610. “We got nicknamed Disney-verse by the last set.”
“Sorry, who are you?” Steve asked.
“Oh. Well. This is…unexpected.”
“And Thor? He could be a problem,” Dr. Banner pointed out. Tony shrugged.

“You know, the old Cap comics left out the whole ‘vaporizing guns’ thing,” Tony said through the comms when they arrived on the scene, just after a Hydra agent demonstrated their weapon on a nearby car.
“What? Oh, sure,” female Tony said, as if only just realizing their presence. “They’re from Earth 199999. Names are the same. The guy who looks like a guy version of me is unsurprisingly a guy version of me. Look what a handsome couple they make!”
drunk yet. Still, the blue liquid was powerful stuff. His state of intoxication, therefore, was probably why he didn’t realize—why no one in the room realized—what was happening until 3490 Tony was hyperventilating, her husband in front of her and urging her to concentrate, to breathe as he did. Steve still didn’t understand what was happening. He didn’t understand why 3490 Tony and 3490 Steve suddenly were grabbing their coats and rushing out the door. He didn’t understand why Bucky—and it was so difficult to remember that he, too, deserved a label, had

She was sad to finish the lesson as always, but still coming down from the high of endorphins that filled her body. She walked through the house, still in her point shoes (there weren’t, after all, any damaging surfaces in the house, and she needed to break her painful new pair in). It was late, her class didn’t finish until nine in the evening, and it was ten by the time she got back home. The Alts were either sleeping or consumed in their own quiet activities. So Kate stepped softly through the house, heading to her own bedroom, when a light caught her attention. It was the light to her father’s art studio. She peered inside, through the small gap in the door. Her father sat on a stool, dabbing paint onto a canvas mounted on an easel. She pushed the door open a bit wider. It creaked. Her father looked over, and he smiled when he saw her.
, that’s weird.” It took Other Clint a moment, but eventually his son-in-another-universe’s pointed stare sunk in.
“Sometimes the advances your mom has made—and you now, I guess—blow my mind a little, kid,” Tony admitted. Peter smiled, and Tony—feeling just a tad guilty and manipulative—decided this was the perfect opportunity to segue to his topic. “Particularly with the whole multi-verse travel thing. We didn’t even know there
and we’re trapped in an underground bunker with about twenty young children and teenagers. Oh, and we’re still trapped in an alternate universe, there’s that too.”
“He’s going to get killed over there,” Steve said.
“Seriously?” he asked. “That was your criteria? Guy stops making death machines, clearly he’s not senator material?”
“Mom will kill
“I don’t take well to threats, Rogers,” Fury replied, his voice low and dangerous.
“So you assume it’s bad news?” James asked. “Thanks, little sis. Glad to know you have such faith in me.”
Peter came back with the nurse, and Steve excused himself. He didn’t want to make James uncomfortable, and aside from that, he had work to do. No way in hell was this group getting at his family again.
And with that terrifying thought, Steve realized that, while his counterparts may have initially appeared to him to be more perfect versions of himself (and yes, of Tony, at first), there were plenty of things they’d done that he personally, he thought to himself, could never do.
“If they’re treating us as enemies,” Steve said, “at least they’re quite hospitable about it.” Tony let out a laugh, but internally his heart had begun to race in panic. Steve was looking at him, all his attention focused on

“You and me both, Bruce. You and me both.”
“So you’re leaving now?” Kate asked. Her dad nodded. He still looked exhausted. He was exhausted and upset and Kate could read it on her face, and that made her worried. “Can’t you stay just another day?”
“So you’ll be on my team in D.C., right? Heading up security?” Tony asked.
“Couldn’t he use a cosmic cube? An infinity gem?” Steve suggested

“If you’re still alive this time next year,” she said, “I’ll be thankful to get to clobber you in battle once more.”
“I’ve got this, guys,” he said. He shoved his sunglasses down over his eyes and opened the gate in the fence, which was for some reason—laziness, probably—unlocked. Peter still stood, waiting, and looking mildly horrified. Tony just waltzed over to him and shoved the form at him. Peter took it. “Permission form. Your mother wouldn’t let us leave the house without it.”
since middle school and probably before. But no matter his reason, James felt tense for his little brother—he knew what was coming. He’d been on the receiving end of it before.
“No, no, I meant—why are you bringing me food?” 3490 Tony asked. Her gaze was unrelenting. It was the most undivided attention 3490 Tony had ever afforded him, and he felt his face heating.
“How could you keep this from me?” 3490 Steve asked. There was raw pain in that question, quieter now. Antonella looked so very lost.

He had been reassigned to the team after the incident at the bunker, though Jane—along with Pepper and Phil—was still at another location. “They violated every sacred law of guests and hospitality. But I think we would all appreciate the chance to be judged upon our own natures.”

“It’s…complicated. I think we have the best chance of keeping an eye on them here. We’ve put precautions in place—you know about those.

you in there, because it was all for him. I wanted to do the same thing for you, Kate, but I didn’t know how. I couldn’t fill your room with science; you didn’t care about it. So I put a piano in here that took up half the room and you hated it. And then I tried putting up mirrors and a ballet bar, but the mirrors scared you at night and, oh, you came running into our room that night, screaming your head off and crying and for half a minute I thought you were being chased down the hall by skrulls!” Tony said. “So I took that down the next day and put up a little dart board for your Nerf bow, but you preferred the real bows down at the archery range so that didn’t hold your attention. I put up a vanity and gave you all sorts of silly make-up to play with—you
. She held in her hands a large stack of papers, and a Bluetooth was permanently glued in her ear (metaphorically speaking; though, the way that mature Tony integrated tech and the human body, Pepper would not have honestly been surprised if her double had a Bluetooth implant). Pepper sat in the living room with Tony and the rest of the Avengers, minus Jane and Thor. Pepper had initially taken their near-constant absence as a sign that they were off having some much deserved couple time, but had been proven wrong the other day—Jane was having far too much fun at one of mature Tony’s labs in Manhattan, studying the multiverse she had previously suspected existed but never before been able to pin down. Thor, desiring to be near her and himself moderately interested in Midgardian science, went with her whenever she left. In absence of anything else to do, the other Avengers of their universe had returned to Mario Kart. Steve and Clint were engaged in a head to head battle. When Kate and Peter arrived home from school, Peter sat down and joined them while Kate disappeared. Natasha read a book in Russian. Bruce was absent from the room, because video games tended to agitate him. Tony was busy disassembling a remote control because mature Tony had refused him access to her personal lab. That was not a conversation that had gone over well.

. I’ll—we can talk about it later. But you’re going to start training hand-to-hand with me from now on. Maybe even once a day,” Steve said, lacing up his sneakers. His teammates—especially Tony—looked at him like he was nuts, but Steve didn’t care. He’d found the perfect solution to their problems. A
“Just the extra Maria Hill with a gun pointed directly at my head,” Other Tony replied, sounding as casual as possible. Tony knew that the tone was a bluff. Everyone knew and feared Maria’s marksmanship skills. Other Maria looked rather startled upon seeing her double. Tony decided that she didn’t have time to wait around for them to figure their situation out. They hadn’t meant to land in this universe, that much was obvious.
, I’m not telling you,” James said. Kate pouted again.
“You need to eat something, Katie,” Francis said, sitting down next to her. She could just feel herself tensing. Her right hand was balling into a fist, her nails digging into her palm almost painfully. She couldn’t process everything that had happened to them all just then, but she
“Because we believe in what we’re doing Kate,” he said softly. “Because we’re stronger together. We all have families Kate. If it isn’t me, it’s Clint and Bobbie, or it’s Luke or it’s Sam or Rhodey—“ Kate knew this. Kate knew all of this before she had even asked her question. Kate was simply beyond caring.
“And how long is

anymore, considering most of the 199999 Avengers had scattered, but she stood there, looking for all the world like she was trying to get a hold of herself. 3490 Steve spoke to her in a calm voice, from a slight distance. Tony could see the worry on his face.
“I got shot, right?” Steve asked. His voice was hoarse, his throat dry. Stark looked up abruptly.
“THE HELL DID YOU DO TO HER?” James screamed at him.
“He doesn’t have to,
,” Peter said. He threw his ball up in the air. Kate glared. Kate punched him on the shoulder. He glared right back at her. “Ow.”
“Jamie?” his father whispered from the bed, and James realized that he’d been late to this idea. There on either side of his dad were Kate and Peter. Peter had genuinely passed out. Kate had one eye peeked open to see him come through the door, but it fluttered shut again as James came inside and shut the door.
Steve’s world disappeared in the moment that he spotted him. The happy chatter of the room around him was drowned out by this singular realization. James Buchanan Barnes of 3490 was alive and well. He smiled at friends and said hello as they fussed over him and Natasha and suggestively teased them for being late—what had been the cause? He greeted 3490 Steve with a warm hug and a hello. He had a metal arm.
“I think what Tony
“Do you have a knife?”
“HURRY!” Peter screamed down the tunnel. “THEY’RE TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE WALL AND JAMES IS UNCONSCIOUS!” Peter could hear running footsteps, a bunch of them.
“I was wondering how long it would take you to show up,” he said. Tony felt caught, like a deer in headlights.
“It’s not about his emotional well being,” Natasha said. “It’s about his physical one.”
“You ok?” James asked.
“I’m no Reed, though,” Peter said even as he contorted himself into a position that made even Bruce, with all his years of yoga, wince to look at. As he got up, Bruce wrote down the final pieces of their findings. The only thing left were the biological tests, most of which would not show results until the morning.
eavesdropping. This was no longer stumbling-upon-the scene innocence, and he was beginning to feel a bit perverted. He walked away a bit until all he could hear was
There was a troubling quiet that settled over the room then. If they were at a dead end, they were in serious trouble. Kate tried her best not to think, too often, about the fact that the multiverse was in danger of collapsing in on itself at any given second, but whenever she allowed the thought to occur, the panic would rise through her stomach and into her throat, and she’d swallow it down and see what could be done around the bunker. (This, too, Kate thought, must be how her parents had felt all the time. She understood, now.) This particular kind of panic had her itching to get out of the bunker, take a needle and thread and stitch the universe back together herself.
When dinner finished up, Tony turned on some music and started to do the dishes with her husband—the maid, they explained, was visiting a sick relative. Still they didn’t seem any worse for wear as people began to trickle out of the room, handing up plates to the sink on their way out; they were having far too much fun dancing to the music as they worked.
.” Peter just shook his head, tears finally spilling out of his eyes and falling onto James’ clothes. If this were a Disney movie, Peter thought idly, his tears would heal his brother. James would get right back up and they would fight the AIM agents together. But this wasn’t a Disney movie.

“I will not violate my principles—agh!” female Tony started laughing hysterically, and the cause was apparent—mature Steve was tickling her. “Stop! St-stop!”
“Hang on, so, if we fucked, would that be sex or masturbation?” Other Tony asked. Other Pepper rolled her eyes in obvious exasperation. Tony smiled a bit and shrugged.
a pissy mood, and it never failed to put Dad in a pissy mood, too.
When they had pulled up to the building, Francis had raised an eyebrow. Kate had texted every student
“S’not…that,” James said. He cracked his eyes open again. “Can’t tell you.”
Peter shifted himself up, leaning back on his elbow as he swept the room with the flashlight. Some of the metal shelves had collapsed, spilling their contents all over the ground. It was one such metal shelf that was resting on top of his leg. It hurt like a motherhugger, but he was glad his leg hadn’t been completely severed. The front half of the room was, well, squashed. Peter couldn’t see the door anymore—all he could see was collapsed plaster, and chunks of ruined concrete. The roof seemed closer than it had before. He could hear worrying crumbling noises from above.
“Budge up,” James told his little brother as he maneuvered his way into the bed next to him. Peter groaned and rolled further into the bed as James shoved him over. It was quiet for a little while, the only sound being the deep breaths of sleep from his brother and sister.
“These aren’t my dogs, Tony,” Other Fury said slowly. She could see his eye scanning the situation, and lingering on her. She kind of wished she’d had time to fix her hair. She couldn’t look intimidating, so she settled for bored. Sometimes bored was intimidating, and Tony figured that this was one of those times. “Look around, you recognize anyone?” Other Tony looked around. His cocky stance shifted slightly, almost into a fighting stance.
, Mom,” Peter said.
“There’s ABCs in it,” he said. “I don’t think I’ve had alphabet soup since I was six.” He picked up the spoon and took a gulp, but he wasn’t really tasting it. What he did taste was tinny. He put the spoon back down and went back to mindlessly watching the movie. It was stupid and cheerful and hopeful and everything the kids needed just then. He felt a warm hand on his shoulder, and he turned his gaze to Steve.

“Apologize? You—no. No it’s not—ugh, ok, this is going to sound really lame, but it’s not you, it’s me,” Tony said, internally cringing at himself. Steve just stood there and blinked for a moment.
“Fat lot of good that’s going to do you. The collapse is exactly what the Skull wants,” he said. Steve sighed. He pulled up another old rolling chair and sat down. Natasha smoothly followed suit.
Steve was pissed. Steve was pissed at 199999 for disobeying their orders and coming out to fight anyway. They could have caused an absolute mess—he was
“M’sorry I’m an asshole,” James apologized, the ghost of a grin skittering across his mostly slack face.
Peter could hear them yammering on, but he paid little attention to what they said, zoning in and out. He could hear much more clearly, though it was so soft and inconsequential a noise Peter guessed the Alts hadn’t really heard it, the little gasping noises his sister was making as she struggled not to cry and to get her breathing under control. He should unfold himself, Peter thought dimly. He should unfold himself, get off the couch, and wrap his sister in a hug. He should take her trembling hands and dry them off, pull her away from the sink. But Peter couldn’t find the strength to move. Now that the adrenaline had worn off, all he could see was Stark Tower crumbling in on itself, his mother still trapped inside. It played in his mind over and over again, and he couldn’t get it out.
“Let’s wait it out,” Steve suggested again.

He ran an affectionate hand through James’ hair, and James feared he might throw up right then as his stomach and entire nervous system rebelled. “But he was

not to. So instead he bloodied his own fists on the punching bag. He was strong enough that usually it wouldn’t come to that, but he couldn’t remember how long he’d been down in the gym area, taking everything out on the punching bag. It was long enough that his knuckles had begun to chafe, to crack and bleed. It was preferable to being on the upper floor of the bunker at the moment, listening to Kate’s muffled crying as she sat in a corner, refusing any and all comfort or human contact. He’d rather bloody his knuckles than see his little brother’s hollow stare.
“We’ve got out little side project,” MCU Jane said. Side project? “We won’t be stuck here.”

“Oh. Well. I’m sure they’ll be glad to have you, darling. Let’s get you a glass—” Tony grabbed a glass off Kate. Steve suppressed a groan of frustration. It wasn’t that Tony didn’t know what Camp Dwyer was—it was just her reaction that bothered Steve.
His heart ached, and tears sprung to his eyes that had nothing to do with the physical pain he was in. Even in what might be his dying moments, he just missed his mom. No, not his dying moments. She’d never forgive him if he didn’t

“Other Me doesn’t have Extremis. He won’t be able to detect it, and none of them will suspect,” Tony said. “I’ll slip the nanites in carefully. In brownie batter or something. They’ll never know. And once the nanites are in their bloodstream, well, our universe will be safe from whatever threat they may pose. This is how we neutralize an Asgardian, Bruce, this is how we take secrets straight from Other Fury’s brain, this is how I make sure Rogers doesn’t go insane from the stress of his short new life and start a killing rampage. I’ll link them up to JARVIS. He’ll monitor the situation for me and if any of them come close to touching a hair on me or my kids’ heads, or any innocent civilians’—well, he’ll knock them cold where they stand.

So, explaining to her teammates she was going to get some air that didn’t smell like perfect cookies, Natasha left the tower and headed across the street to the nearest Starbucks.

“Want a ride?” Tony offered as Clint and Natasha headed over to Thor. Bruce hadn’t joined them for this outing; 3490 were concerned that his Hulk, a less controlled Hulk, might do unnecessary damage to the city. Bruce had seemed frankly relieved that he wasn’t asked to join in. Steve didn’t answer Tony, he just grabbed on to the back of the suit. Tony put his faceplate back on and fired up the suit.
Kate had come home just after spending over twenty-four hours at the hospital. She was doing fine, medically speaking. Steve was as gentle with her as he ever was. He’d given her the stern, “I’m disappointed in you, Kate Rogers” talk, but that was it. The pedestal might have been chipped a bit away at, but it wasn’t gone entirely. He still loved her—that had never been a fear of Tony’s—but he was also still

“I’m sorry ma’am, did you say you’re…Tony Stark?” Steve asked. He looked extremely confused. She winked at him.

“Mostly,” Natasha corrected him. He swung around to look at her. She shrugged. Technically, she wasn’t supposed to share that bit of classified information. But the rules seemed hardly to apply in this situation.

He jolted back, but it had little to do with the cold. “Agh—just—let me—” Tony swiped the ice pack for himself, putting it where Steve had seen fit to put it—yeah, that was definitely the spot that was going to bruise.
“Let us help you!” Steve shouted after them.

last Tuesday when you were getting your ass kicked.” Peter felt his face redden a bit. He was still embarrassed that the Alts had been witness to such a humiliating moment for him.
“And after that?” Azari asked. “The next safehouse is just as small.”
Tony stared back.
“Hello, this is Nurse Maria Collins from St. Vincent’s Hospital. Am I speaking to Mrs. Bishop, please?”
“Of course, that would be great,” Tony agreed.
“Mind if I join you?” James asked. She looked up. His eyes were red rimmed and puffy as well. He hadn’t been exercising in the gym. Kate latched onto him and cried into his shoulder. His arms tightened around her. She never heard him cry, but she felt his shoulders shake. Kate just held on tighter.
, she still felt her heart hammering away.
Tony Stark was happy. Unbelievably happy. Some days she just sat and wondered how she had managed to get so lucky in life. She still had no answer to that question, but she didn’t much mind.
“Sure, they have us there,” Natasha agreed, “but couldn’t we just as easily hold a gun to Peter’s head and demand they help us? Demand they send us back through, universe holes be damned? It’s a
“—home without her?” MCU Clint asked.
“Fine. I was dying. Cancer. Brain tumor. It was making me crazy as it was killing me, all right? We knew that would happen. And I didn’t want anybody to look at the will, see I’d left almost everything to Steve and the kids, and challenged him because we hadn’t been married at the time of my death,” Tony explained dispassionately. “It would have been easy to do if we waited too long. Before the end I was hallucinating, forgetting I had children at all—we had a full time nanny for a while, as much as I hated the concept. We couldn’t cope, Steve couldn’t cope, and we knew he’d need one once I was gone, anyway. It was a safety precaution when I started losing my mind—I would forget I was supposed to be watching them, or forget they existed all together. I would leave the oven on and never remember to go back to do whatever it was I was doing before. If we’d waited until that point Steve would have been challenged left and right over his part in the will. So, I went to him one day, sat him down, and explained to him all the logical reasons why we had to get married. I’m pretty sure I ended that conversation with, ‘and well, my wagon’s been hitched to yours until the end of my life, anyway, right, so what’s the difference?’
. Which means Stark, you need to stop pulling shit, and Rogers, if he pulls shit we at least have to back each other up against 3490.”
“Are we British now?” Peter asked dryly. Kate punched him in the arm.

” she could hear Francis behind her, following after her. She sped up her walk. Maybe he’d take the hint and go away. She could feel tears prickling behind her eyes. Both of her hands were balled into fists as she made her way to a bedroom. She burst in and shut the door behind her. She went straight to the bed and threw herself on it. Unfortunately, a closed door was no match for Francis. He opened it carefully and then shut it behind him again.
to say.
Peter wasn’t Tony’s son. Peter kind of wigged Tony out, honestly. It was weird seeing that kid’s Bambi eyes and knowing that the color was his and the set of them was Steve’s. It was weird watching him sketch in perfect form, the same way he’d noticed Steve did whenever they had down time at the Triskelion, while at the same time he scratched equations in the margins. Kate Tony could get over. Kate was a younger copy of her mother with blue eyes, a dryer wit, and no apparent scientific aptitude—or at least enthusiasm. Her mix of her parents wasn’t so obvious. But with Peter it was an incontrovertible, visible fact. So Peter freaked Tony out a little bit, but at the same time he sympathized with the damn kid. He might not be his son, but he sure could understand living in this big house with absent parents.
достаточно!”
,” he said. He returned his gaze to the target and let the arrow fly. Kate’s bow fell to her side as the arrow sliced through the second—an even more impossible shot, and he’d made it. Clint looked back at her. Ten year old Kate was all wide blue eyes and open mouth. He slung his quiver across his back.
“I don’t want a lecture or anything right now,” Kate said, finally looking up from her coffee.
when you came to visit us. It happens—sometimes people just fall through the cracks but this…” Dr. Richards went silent. He looked disturbed.
“Yeah,” Kate agreed. “I’m sorry you got dragged—“
“Who exactly is team leader, B team?” the Commander demanded.
. Natasha glanced up at the weary face of 3490 Steve as he landed on his feet beside her. The Thors better find that gauntlet fast, Natasha thought, or they were all going to crash and burn.
“Uh, yeah, fine,” Peter said. Man. First bruised ribs now a spider bite. It was a great week, really. “Thanks.” She smiled again.
. Possibly
“I want my
“Did you get a girlfriend?” Kate asked.
“Oh, Katie,” she said with a sigh. “I never meant to say you had to.”
“We held a funeral,” James’ father finished the tale solemnly. “We burned their bodies and sent their ashes back through the portal to their own ruined earth. Can you understand now our mistrust? Can you understand why we tagged you, why we needed some form of control? They didn’t actually accomplish much—but they nearly killed James.” His dad turned his gaze to him, and James stared back resolutely. It had been difficult to listen to the story again. It was the first time they had really mentioned it since it had happened. After everything they’d thrown it under the rug, never to look at it again. It had been even more difficult to tell his part of it—that he’d run back in the house for Kate’s teddy bear, that widow had caught him, that he’d been dragged into the living room while a version of his own father grabbed him by the neck and counted down to his own death. But his father hadn’t wanted to speak for him, and had asked him to take over for that part. He could feel the looks of pity focused in his direction; he ignored them as best he could.
“Oh, back to last names, are we?” Steve asked, the ghost of a smile playing at his lips. Tony quirked up an eyebrow.
“Oh, please do your magic, Tudo,” Kate said. Tudo started on whatever drinks he decided to concoct while Kate continued to flirt with him. Francis and James stayed back.
“Ten,” James said coolly.
, Tony? What are you doing? Just get out!” Steve shouted.
“But if they’d come for us in the bunker maybe James wouldn’t be—” Peter started, but Steve shushed him.
“Kate here, on the battlefield—what the hell is going on? Do we have a status on Peter?” she demanded, no longer content to just listen. They could discipline her for being out later—all that mattered at the moment was her twin.
Peter was fine. Tony checked on him too. He didn’t have much to say about his school day, but that wasn’t unusual. Peter’s knowledge had long since passed the academic capacity of his public high school, but he’d never wanted to graduate early. Tony could understand that. She guessed, by the lack of friends he possessed, that he didn’t have the best time of it in school, being so small and kind and smart. Sending him to college early would be a mistake—it would only ruin the social aspect for him. Tony had offered private schools and home schooling, but Peter preferred to be where he was, so Tony didn’t argue. Whatever made him happy was fine in her books.

“Nothing to apologize for, Katie,” Clint repeated, pulling her back in. Kate put her arms around his neck and put her face into his shoulder. Kate had thought she was all out of tears, but still they leaked from her eyes and onto Clint’s shirt. She let herself just take comfort in the hug, take comfort in knowing that everything between them was okay again, even if Kate felt like nothing, in general, was ever going to be ok again.
“Oh, Pepper told me what he did,” Steve assured him. “Sounds to me like you already paid him back—gave him a bunch of cool new toys, updated the garage… You could have been done. Could have washed your hands of him. But you keep answering his e-mails. Sent him a birthday present. Apparently you’re sending him something for Christmas too. You’ve become his…what, patron? Benefactor? Is it so hard to admit you’re really a father figure?”
“I could carry you the rest of the way,” Peter said anxiously. “You’re not

to hold a bow. Kate, it had turned out, was a much more adept student and thrilled to do something Francis could do. They’d had practice together as soon as Kate turned six and could hold a real bow, and even when the Barton family left the mansion, Kate had continued lessons with Francis and Clint. The two kids were attached at the hip—until Francis hit about fifteen and stopped coming around for the most part. Still, it sometimes felt that Francis had simply always been around, always been underfoot, perhaps due in large part to the fact that he was the only Avenger child other than Kate and Peter (and indeed more so than James) to have grown up in the mansion. Clint had moved in when Francis was just a year old, and Clint and Bobbie hadn’t moved out until 2006, the year when Tony and Steve tied the knot, and Bobbie got pregnant again. They were the last to leave. Francis had lived in the house until he was ten years old, and sometimes Steve forgot he

“She’s the type to slip us all trackers in our food or in our sleep,” Tony said, annoyed.

, though his mother seemed less inclined to punishing him when he said, honestly, that he’d just fallen asleep on the subway. Hence the lack of a phone signal. They had yelled at him, and Peter didn’t like that. He also didn’t like the suspicious looks they kept sending him. He didn’t like them being suspicious of anything, for he’d never had anything to hide before.

“No?” Tony asked. “Then you and I have very different definitions of the word ‘hero’. You’ve stepped in this house again and again and again even with the Alts here. And that—that takes a special kind of bravery, James.” James just shrugged, examining his gift instead. Tony put a hand over his. James reluctantly met her gaze. “I’m sorry, you know. About how you found out. If I’d known you were coming home, I would have warned you.” James shrugged.
“It’s not just today,” he admitted. “I don’t—Tony you know I wasn’t the biggest fan of this move in the first place. They’re here, alone with the kids a lot of the time.”
“Just fine. Now—you mentioned you were thinking about some upgrades for the armor—mind if I take a look? I might have some suggestions,” he said.

“And so I did,” Tony agreed. “Do you remember what I told you?”

Thug #1 had gotten out of his webbing and grabbed a gun, too. It was too late to remember that the formula in Peter’s shooters was

This is a plot line that I have endlessly debated the inclusion of. I had debated it when I first began the story, threw it out, and then had a friend (who knows the full scope of this story) suggest this very thing without any previous knowledge of it having been a thought in the first place. I put it back in, because I do think it fits well with this story, but with reservations; I did not want to turn female Tony magically into a 'baby machine' as chartyourowncourse so aptly summed up my concerns. 3490 Tony will address some of those reservations of mine directly in the story at a later date, but I felt it important to acknowledge this potential issue in the notes on this chapter as well. Please feel free to add your own commentary; I would love to hear everyone's opinions about this and, of course, the rest of the story.

“I know, I’ve got one just like it—” Tony said.
Steve’s words heralded the end of the meeting, and everyone seemed to know that it was time to dissipate. Steve implored Natasha to restore the surveillance. He was uncomfortable with cutting it in the first place as it would make 3490 suspicious, but with any luck they would understand their need for privacy and not think much of it.
Steve reached to the end table and got the glass of water with a straw meant for James. Wordlessly he helped him sit up by moving the bed into position, and held the glass for him while he sipped. He was already looking better, even if he was still pale. He had that familiar glint in his eye.
Steve looked up in the sky where he knew he’d find Tony—sure enough, there was Iron Man, dodging a few shots of deadly blue.

“So all of that happened earlier for you?” Jane asked. Tony looked at Jane.
“Rude.”
But then there was another Tony. A woman Tony. A Tony who was all snark and humor but without the sharp edges. She was funny and vibrant and ridiculously intelligent (maybe Tony from his universe was too—certainly he was intelligent, but all his humor was used to tear others down, all his vibrancy was drained by the press constantly in his face). Her words and attitude were never cruel. She was obstinate, obviously still a wild card, but somehow she made it charming instead of irritating. And she was his double’s wife. His double, who had friends abound, who had clearly adjusted to this new century with ease, managed to embrace it and everyone in it, managed to move on and thrive. He worked a lot, but he didn’t drown himself in it. Steve didn’t like admitting it, but that was exactly what he was doing. If he was always at work, he didn’t have time to think about anything else. Now that he couldn’t work, he was at a loss.

“Where’s Dad?” Peter asked, scooping a heap of noodles onto his plate before passing the bowl.

There was a
“Busted,” Peter said in between coughs in a fake coughing fit. Kate leveled a glare at him before following her mother out of the kitchen. 3490 Steve just watched them go, a frown tugging at the corners of his mouth. He finally sat down with his own plate of pancakes, taking the seat on the other side of his doppelganger. He clasped his hands together and closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them he crossed himself.
No one on the team commented. Clint had no idea what he was supposed to say to his double. He was having difficulty processing the fact that he was talking to another him, still. 3490 Clint didn’t seem to be expecting them to say much, though.

“Or just be a dumbass, sure, whatever, that’s not at all the start of every Super Villain origin ever or anything,” Alt Tony said. Peter shifted his weight from one foot to the other.
A big, warm hand fell over hers, stilling her incessant tapping. The younger replica of her father looked at her with the same compassion her own father always did. His hand slid off of hers as she looked up into his face. He had a small half-grin playing on his lips.
“Powdered,” Ben Banner replied, taking a seat on the floor next to them. Kate knew that Ben was a decent chef, but there was little he could do to make powdered eggs more appealing. Kate hadn’t taken a plate, opting for a mug of coffee instead. Peter just made another face of disgust and disappointment and poked at the eggs again. Thankfully, the younger kids didn’t seem to notice that breakfast was a little less than up to their usual standard; they were watching DVDs of various cartoons that Azari had popped in for them. Kate knew they had to be reeling from the night before—not to mention upset about the fact that this was supposed to be

Tony had decided to take up the issue of Kate’s slipping grades, so it was left to Steve to figure out what Peter was up to. Peter’s grades were impeccable—in everything except for history, which was a solid C+. Steve found Peter playing Other Clint on the Xbox in the living room, with Other Tony sitting in an armchair and working on a tablet and Other Steve watching the game intently. Other Clint was wooping and howling and Peter occasionally shouted an obscenity, which made Steve frown in disapproval. It struck him, sometimes, how different Clint was from the other universe. He took up games more readily, gambled harder, and overall was just a

The kitchens weren’t on the ninety-third floor, but rather on the ninety-second. They slipped down the private staircase, tucked away in a corner of the penthouse, and emerged into the kitchen. If Kate had wanted somewhere they could speak in private, she didn’t get it. All of the Avengers and company from 199999 occupied the kitchen. Someone had brought or found a pack of cards, and they sat at the kitchen table playing—well, Peter thought it was poker until MCU (yeah, Peter had to admit that James’ little nickname had stuck) Clint shouted,

It had been almost two years that Steve had been assigned to the crazy man—two years (well, a year and six months, really, given that they both spent the first six at a cool distance) of three AM hamburger runs, of games of HORSE on the basketball court, of heated debates about movies and surprisingly less heated debates about politics, of touring the country in swanky hotels as the campaign picked up pace—and of waiting outside bedrooms, as usual.

say in their household, but the team seemed to get the message:
“No,” James replied, fully aware of the quiver that ran through that note. Peter dropped the spoon and stared off into the distance.
“Couldn’t sleep?” a soft voice asked. Tony was about to tell him why. Tony was about to spill all the beans, hearing that soft, sweet voice that she so loved. But when she looked up, it was Steve but it wasn’t. It was Other Steve, his young face looking at her in concern. It still shocked her, how young he was. At twenty-seven, he wasn’t much older than her Steve’s oldest son, James. He still had a bit of awkwardness left in him, awkwardness that Tony could vividly remember smashing out of Steve with a healthy dose of MIT parties in Cambridge and clubbing in NYC. She had enjoyed rubbing that layer away, to see the man beneath, but now she appreciated the awkwardness of youth that this Steve still carried. She smiled wryly at him.
The alternate Avengers did not stir until well into the afternoon, which of course was not going to help their universe induced jetlag, but Tony couldn’t blame them—she herself had slept until four alongside them. She could have slept longer, but there had been a pleasant sensation at her neck, and she had woken, still half-asleep, to her husband’s kisses. All in all, it wasn’t a bad way to wake up. In fact, it was the way that Tony would prefer to be woken up every morning—but usually her alarm clock or villains plotting to destroy the world had other plans. Still, in that moment when Tony woke up, it was just her and Steve. There was no one else. Kate was not getting into trouble with drugs, there were no alternate avengers living in the mansion beside them—it was just her and Steve, in their own little world. They’d enjoyed themselves for a little while—too little a while, in Tony’s opinion—but eventually had to emerge to face the world. After all, Tony had a whole set of Avengers to send back home.

There had been a lot of commotion after Steve accidentally demolished a building. People were running around, yelling—at him, around him—it didn’t matter. For a few, terrifying minutes, it seemed like he had killed his own son in his recklessness. Even when Kate and his double pulled Peter out of the rubble—Peter, his boy, who he had almost gotten killed, Peter, whose leg now stuck out at an unnatural angle because of

“Do we know who’s behind this?” Steve asked his double. The Commander shook his head.
Natasha clearly recalled that day on the helicarrier with Clint. She had known the world was getting weirder, but she would never have believed that one day she would step into an alternate universe, that she would stare in the fact of another her, that she would team up with adolescents with incredible powers with incredible powers to save the multiverse from tearing asunder. And yet here she was.
was what Tony had meant. Trust him to make the right decisions and come out on the other side a better person for it. It was why Kate had ended up the way that she did, Tony’s laissez-faire parenting style and her own deep fear of parental rifts.
“I think he was anyway, Steve,” Natasha said calmly. “Ease up.”
“Tony, don’t you think this is overreacting a bit?” Steve asked, pulling off his shirt. “She probably just checked the GPS on your phone.”
like she could use a bit of sleep, which was unusual for her. It was difficult to look intimidating with your hair down and messy and slowly forming bags under your eyes from lack of sleep. Well, she’d just have to do her best.

and disarming the girl was easy. When he had her gun, he shot his web out to grab the other one just as the thug lunged for it.

“That wouldn’t be possible for us,” Other Tony explained. “I didn’t invent the suit until a few years ago. Bruce didn’t Hulk out until around then either, and Thor wasn’t Earth-bound until after all that. I guess Widow and Hawkeye have always been out doing their thing, but Cap was a Capsicle until recently. There was no team to put together.” None of them seemed disturbed by this, but the thought turned Tony’s stomach.
“Kate, if you want us to be together, I’m going to have to live to see your eighteenth birthday.”

“A likely story,” Alt Tony said to him as he left. Peter just saluted him with two sticky fingers and left.
“What made you change your mind?” Tony asked.
Ok, there was something desperately wrong with this picture.
“No archery with Francis and Clint for two weeks,” 3490 Tony answered. “No training session at the Academy for the same amount of time. Grounded for a month, and no medication for her hangover today.” 3490 Tony sat with her newly filled coffee mug, still looking murderous.
“We’re sorry for your loss,” Tony spoke from beside him. 3490 Steve just looked further wounded as he glanced up at Tony. He looked out at the other kids, then to James.
“Tony had a secret and you don’t know if you should tell—who, the Commander?” Steve asked, looking puzzled.
“Everyone, move to the sides so they have nowhere to go. Bruce, come at them straight on. Less smash, more… roar?” Steve suggested, though it was still unclear how much instruction the Hulk understood through Banner. He didn’t hear Bruce reply though. A few seconds later, a terrifying roar ripped through the air. It was enough to make some of the younger teens pause, even. Some of the hydra agents paused—and then they all started running as the great green monster came barreling at them. Steve jumped off the winter hut and joined his team on the left side, making sure the agents ran back into the ice rink and towards the breach.

“Dad?” Steve turned around to see Peter at the door. He had a bandage on his arm and a bloody lip. He looked as drained as Steve felt.
” James barked. Tony put them up, knowing that Natasha, Clint, and Steve were, at this point, thinking of several ways to disarm the kid. The unfortunate fact was that he was too far away from any of them to take him down before he would manage to get a shot off, unless they hit him with a projectile. Injuring, or killing, the kid was not a good plan or something Tony knew any of them wanted to do. “You could’ve hacked him. Think of something else.”

And yeah, it was pretty damn obvious that Steve had noticed considering usually he was halfway through saying, “Hey, Tony, we should—“ Talk. Talk was the end of that sentence, Tony was 99.9% certain. But he never let Steve get to the end of that sentence. It was amazing how easy it was to avoid someone even within a single building. Tony glanced at Steve, who was busy taking down a much larger bot that was set to a much higher difficulty. It probably wasn’t fair of Tony to be doing the avoiding when it was Tony who had started the pursuing (or at least started the kissing) but hey. Tony had never claimed to be a completely fair guy. Sometimes he was even downright selfish. And he was going to continue to be downright selfish because
“Not one of those either then, huh? It must be because you’re an android,” he concluded. Steve rolled his eyes. “Be ready by seven!” With that, Stark wandered off. Steve looked at the flyer again and sighed. At least, he figured, Natasha would be there with him.
“What
shocked when he heard a loud
Months ago, Steve was pretty sure this wouldn’t have worked. Tony probably would have just gotten knocked out of the sky by the shield as he ignored Steve’s call, and even if he’d caught it he probably wouldn’t have guessed what Steve intended. But after all of these little battles, and all of the extra training as a team, Iron Man easily caught his shield and figured out exactly what Steve intended. He dove at the beeping disc and slammed the shield over top.
He walked to Paley Park and sat on a bench for some time. He stayed there until it was dark. When he looked up and could see the stars—stars that were more luminous now than he’d seen them in years, with most of the city evacuated—he realized that people would be missing him. They would be looking for him, maybe. Relieved of his command, Steve knew where he ought to go and walked back to the safe house.
Kate (Bishop) Rogers – Hawkeye
“Good work, Iron Man,” Steve said. The words felt utterly inadequate—he’d have to come up with better compliments later. But for now— “Let’s finish this.”
—Pepper call an ambulance—Rogers, talk to me,” Senator stark commanded.
“Do you know how
else. He supposed there were probably eyes on him at all times. Or at least he likely had a chip somewhere in his body or bloodstream that was tracking his every movement and that bothered Steve in ways he hadn’t found a way to voice yet. But there wasn’t any
“We’ve been trying to herd the civilians toward eighth,” Steve explained. “The kids have been doing a great job of that so far, but every time I try to start in—” Steve was interrupted as he had to dodge the bullets from a sniper in a building above. A shot went off, the sniper fell, and James was stunned to see his little sister holding the gun that felled him.
“Well, I mean, yeah, I guess it was nice not to tell Dad, because he probably would have freaked out and grounded you for the rest of your life—but that ended up happening anyway, didn’t it? And now it’s worse, because he’s upset with you
“Why would I tell
“But,” Tony said, “that would be a lie.” Young Steve looked at her hard, and Tony laughed. “I’m not spying on you. JARVIS isn’t tracking your movements. It was a guess. Ease up, Cap.” Comprehension dawning, young Steve relaxed. Well, perhaps he wasn’t wholly like her Steve. Her Steve was, even at that point, more relaxed than this Steve, who seemed wary of surveillance and not all together trusting. Her Steve had been totally trusting—or, if he hadn’t been, he had never shown it to Tony. But then, her Steve had been an artist, and Tony couldn’t help but recall that this one was an immediate Avenger. She sympathized. He’d been tossed from one war straight into another with no time in between to grieve, no time to recuperate, no time to remember who
“I know,” James replied quietly.
“I am not Peggy Carter, Steve,” she said evenly. He looked bewildered by this obvious statement, but she shook her head. “I am

anyone we were married after the first. The team knew, but it wasn’t a public affair. In my last month, what should have been my last month, I mean, I injected the Extremis virus into my system. It was after I forgot my children existed—again. I couldn’t take it anymore. I was sick and dying and so very tired of fighting. I wanted it to end or I wanted my life to end. Either way, I wasn’t going to keep going like that. Clearly, it worked out. It could have gone wrong, but I did all my calculations right and I came out of it alive and better than ever. And still quite married to Steve.
“Clint!” she shouted so he’d see what she was doing. The more explosives, the merrier. She loosed her arrows and, as soon as they made contact with the stone and mortar above the great hall’s entrance, they exploded on impact in a great, fiery ball. The old stone cracked, and began to crumble. Clint added his own arrows to the fray, and with a great tremble, the stone collapsed and Hydra agents yelled as it began to come down on their heads. There were still many—Kate quickly counted twenty—that had been clear of the door and the area that collapsed. Some of them had the blue light weapons, but some didn’t.

home. Back to the manor. Back to their family. Back to where they were—and, he thought, glancing just briefly at her swollen belly—moving forward.
“They seem to like me well enough, sir,” James said. They both fell silent for a bit. Steve hadn’t spoken to his oldest son in a month, and their last conversation had been restricted to a five-minute phone call, but they were both already out of things to say. Steve had finished most of his dinner before he spoke again.

“They know we need them,” Steve pointed out. “They have us there.”
“What are you drawing?” Tony asked, not even looking away from the computer screen that held his attention. “You’re always drawing. When are you going to show me something?” Steve hoped that the blush he felt didn’t actually show on his face. It probably did.
“Peter, do you have a handle on—” James’ voice said in his ear.

“Hm,” her father had hummed, pausing for a moment as he considered. “I guess I just thought about everyone I cared about who was there, and everyone who I cared about who might get hurt if we didn’t pull through. And then I did what soldiers do, Kate. I just grit my teeth and kept going. Feel the fear, feel the pain—but don’t let it control you.” He’d pushed back her errant lock of hair again as it escaped from behind her ear and fell towards her face. “I guess most people would say, you have to
of his own. His right was occupied with yanking the gun from Thug #3 with another string. Peter jumped down from the rafters, using a new strand to slow his descent and swing him towards Thug #3 once more. He hit him full on the chest with both of his feet, and this time when the bald guy went down, he didn’t get back up. The girl, Thug #2, had not escaped her webbing—she still struggled in the bonds. Peter ran to James, his heart in his throat.

“He didn’t hurt anybody,” James said. “I heard you talking. Nobody got hurt. Maybe some kid got his massive ego bruised. Was it right of Peter? Maybe not. But you can’t punch somebody over and over again and not expect a little backlash someday. You want to talk about consequences? I think that other kid just learned a lesson in them.”
“True love knows no age,” Francis said airily. Kate snorted loudly.
“Dad?” this time, the question was a croak. Steve looked down, barely daring to hope that James was awake so soon. But there he was, peering up at him through half-lidded eyes.
“Um, I’m pretty sure the fact that you have a
and James had no idea where he’d gotten it from. Eventually he landed by the group. At James expression, he showed him the little black device on his wrist.
“No,” Katie replied, “of course not. I just—”
“We wondered that too,” the Commander said. “If you’ll submit to a blood test, we’d appreciate it, but I understand if that’s not something you’re willing to do. Other than the serum, it could be revenge. An old enemy of yours. Or it could be somebody with a Captain America fixation—but I don’t know why they’d go to another universe to grab one.”
“That’s fine. I just need somebody to hold him down. I didn’t want Peter to do it,” Bruce said. Azari’s lips thinned to a tight, hard line, but he nodded. “All the blood’s pooling by that leg. I need to do in-line traction to get circulation going, and then we have to stop that bleeding. Peter’s done a decent job of bandaging with that web but that’s not going to help for much longer.” Already the web was dyed a deep, dark red that Bruce didn’t like the look of. “Ready?” Azari nodded. He took over with one hand to keep pressure on the puncture wound—bullet, Bruce guessed, and he didn’t have time at the moment to flip James over and see if it had gone cleanly through or if it was still inside doing damage—and one arm holding his upper body down to provide Bruce something to pull against.
“I…yeah, I mean, of course. I’ll be happy to see my other co-workers again. Natasha’s happy that she’ll be able to see Clint more often,” Steve said.
“Really? Because all I see is a poor imitation of your parents,” Jeanne said. She said it as she said everything else—factually. “You haven’t even graduated

“I’m game if you are, Cap,” Tony said.
“Steven,” she said softly. Then she reached out and took his face in her hands. She wiped his cheeks with her thumb, and Steve marveled at how soft her hands were. How warm she was. “I’m not a skrull. I’m not an alternate. You’re not dreaming. Or crazy. Or being tricked by a hologram or something. It’s me. It’s Tony. Can you talk to me?”
“And what’s the long term solution?” Natasha asked. “Any chance the universe heal on its own?”
“See?” Peter said, looking damn pleased with himself as well he should. Tony reached out and touched it—it was sticky, but he could pull his hand away. It was definitely strong.
“You got a thing about killing yourself to close portals?” the Captain demanded. “Supersoldier. With a vibranium shield. I’ve got the best chance of surviving an explosion this close. Get off the roof, Iron Man, and that’s an

The real shame of it, Natasha thought as she shot a masked soldier in the thigh, was that for all they knew the soldiers cried for peace or to surrender themselves, but no one understood their tongue. Natasha wondered how many ancient wars had been started in a similar fashion.
“No it’s…thanks,” he said. Tony watched him carefully. She wasn’t, in retrospect, entirely certain that this was a good idea. It had taken her three years to perfect the magic liquid that would get Steve drunk. Which meant, of course, he had a life he enjoyed and had largely recovered from the grief and shock of his enormous loss. This Steve, however, seemed to be wallowing a bit. She would just have to make sure wallowing didn’t turn to drowning.
“You’re not going to believe me.”

“All right, everybody take one shot now,” Tony instructed as she finished filling up all the glasses in the circle. It was just like MIT all over again, with everyone sitting cross legged on the floor. Only, at MIT she hadn’t had a sweet penthouse to house everyone—now, they played a drinking game on the floor despite the abundance of leather seating, in order to sit closer to the windows with the irresistible view of New York City at night. “Always best to get a little lubed up before the main event, know what you’re drinking.” Everyone obeyed her order without question. Other Tony examined the shot glass when he finished, staring at it in confusion. The other Alts held similar expressions, but her own team was well used to her masterful mixes.
“Yeah. You

. Groaning, and then moaning—all entirely from the pain—Peter got up, grasping at a fallen shelf to help balance himself. He looked around, this time remembering what he was looking for and where. There, in one corner of the room was a simple air vent. It was high up—what Peter would usually be able to jump up to, he would have to drag himself up with his sticky hands. That is, if he could even make it over there. Breathing hard, Peter grit his teeth and made his way over.
was wrong with that smile. It looked like every smile his own father had ever given him. There was nothing malicious in it, no hard hint in the eyes. He meant what he said.
“I’m just saying you should really stuff your face today,” she said with an answering smile, but it faded quickly. So did James’.

, Tony thought privately. She wondered when she’d get a chance to send a text. She didn’t want Steve to think she’d stood him up or forgotten. Tony removed the needle from Other Jane’s arm, placing a cotton ball on the injection site and handing her a band-aid she could apply herself. She took the syringe in hand and looked at its contents. Well, at least it wasn’t Skrull blood.

was slower in catching up.
“I don’t know.”
“Then I dare you to go out on the balcony and climb over to us from outside,” Callum challenged. Peter looked out the window. It was, of course, free of any ledges; it was nothing but a sheet of wide glass, uninterrupted to allow for the best view. The balcony was on the other side of the penthouse, and they were 93 stories up—a thousand feet in the air. Peter had never been a fan of heights, but Callum had his arms crossed and an eyebrow arched and Peter had never felt a stronger desire to show up a ten year old.

“Exactly,” she said. “He can’t take over my specialty. I’ll be put out of business.”
Bruce couldn’t count the amount of times he’d wished and dreamed. He never put much stock in it—his wishes never came true. But just seconds later, when there was an even brighter flash of blue and then Bruce was standing in the middle of the emergency room with a collapsed James and an exhausted Billy beside him, Bruce wondered if maybe it wasn’t wishing and dreaming that was the problem—maybe it was just him.
“The big

doing great. Mostly.
“Last week Steve and I made a startling discovery,” Tony said as casually as he could, taking a coke from Pepper as she and Thor handed them out. He popped the lid. “Aside from the fact that Rogers here has a thing for being ordered around—“
“I just,” Francis said before Kate could gather her thoughts enough to say something else, “if that Fury has found the Red Skull, then I’d guess we’re about to go into battle again. Like, probably the worst one yeah? Those guys always save all the worst shit for the end. And if that’s what we’re headed towards, I just—I don’t want anything left unsaid.”
“Tony and I talked it over—” said Steve.
“That is—I don’t—You don’t
“Can’t miss, Katie-Kate,” he said, pulling an arrow from his quiver. He nocked it and took aim as he spoke. “I’m on a team with super-humans. And one god, in case you’ve forgotten. I gave up a lot for this life. Bobbie and I could have had a good, simple life. But we wanted to play with the big boys. And if I miss, it means I’m just another dude with a bow. It means I’ve been fooling myself this whole time. And that’s why I never miss.” The arrow flew, splitting the one he’d let fly just before it as it hit the exact same mark. Kate looked down at her own little bow, shiny and black.
“Hey Peter,” he said, “why don’t we get some work done on the bike before dinner.” Peter nodded.

“No wine with dinner,” he said, and Tony’s brain caught up with her reaction.

He didn’t know how long they were there for—but eventually Lizzie suggested they go back to her place. James was all for that—but, no, he had responsibilities.
“Yes, sir,” James shouted back.
“You know what, Tony, I could believe a lot of things of you, a lot of unfavorable things. I really could, because while I know we’ve been through a lot in the past, and
“Copy that, Commander,” Tony said as she landed on the balcony and disappeared inside the building. “Ok, running down the stairs now…through the kitchen, through the dining hall…more stairs…ok, your old floor…”
“We’ve got company,” Torrun spoke suddenly. James shot up from his seat; Francis put Lewis back on the floor. Steve and Tony both got up as well as everyone but the youngest of kids in the room scrambled to their feet. There on the monitor was a set of Avengers—presumably, 3490 returned. They watched them complete eye scans and give passwords, and then heard the hiss of the door opening. The 3490 Avengers filed inside; well, some of them. Clint, Carol, Natasha, Steve, Bobbie, Wanda, and Bruce, plus Reed and Susan of the Fantastic Four.
“Kill you. Paralyze you. Monitor vitals—and, thus, check for signs that you’re lying. Mainly they’re controlled through JARVIS here, but we do have trigger words in case of emergency,” 3490 Steve said. He spoke so clinically Steve felt his whole body tingling in horror, like he no longer wanted to be himself, like his soul was trying to jump out of his body and become somebody, anybody, else in that moment. Steve took a few breaths, doing his best to keep his expression schooled to Natasha levels of blankness.
“I’m not flying into the void, Capsicle,” Tony said. He was rolling his eyes and it was a shame the Captain could not see the degree of his exasperation. His exasperation level was at like, a thousand at least. They’d been fighting these aliens for quite some time now, and that portal wasn’t getting any smaller. “I’m shutting it down.”
“Yeah, thought so,” Dad said, steely toned. “So the minute you’ve got the
this?” Other Tony demanded.
“Hi Mom,” Kate said in a small voice.
“Morning,” her dad replied, his voice still rough. He went to the table, kissed the top of Kate’s head, and took a seat. He watched her with concern written all over his face. He asked her quietly, “How are you doing, Kate?” Kate shrugged. How did he want her to answer that, anyway? More and more people were filtering into the kitchen. When some of the younger kids showed up, she helped pass out bowls of cereal.
Steve snuck out all the way, a bit loathe to do so. He didn’t even know where he was going. Everyone else had disappeared. He could watch a movie, he supposed, or play a video game if no one was using the TV. He could read a book; he had yet to visit the library Pepper had told him about. He was just wandering around indecisively near the kitchen when he heard hushed voices. The music nearly drowned them out, though; almost all he could hear was:
“I am

“James. You’ve done well here. I know I can count on you to keep everything together. Keep an eye on your brother and sister, won’t you?” their father asked.
“So. We tagged you all. With nanites,” 3490 Steve said. He took a seat in the only available armchair as the older kids and 3490 Avengers stood around.
,” Dad said, his voice stern again. Peter felt eight years old all over again. Dad pinched the bridge of his nose like he had a headache, and Peter felt guilty. He still felt angry as hell at James, but he wasn’t about to drag Dad into their problems. He just sighed and kept looking at James. “You’re mad at me. I get that. You’re right to be mad at me and I’m not going to argue with you. I just—” he swallowed, put a hand on James’ shoulder, “I just wanted to say I love you.” James didn’t say anything. He just kept staring at Dad.
“No, Tony.”
Until 199999 Steve threw his shield at her husband.
. So Kate showered, using her most potent, floral-and-fruit bodywash and strawberry scented shampoo. She smelled like a candle store when she exited, but it had washed away and masked the smell of weed. Hair still wet, she crafted it into a perfect bun on top of her head and dressed in a simple black leotard and pink tights. There were all sorts of fashionable things you could do with a leotard—you could wear one in a different color, or buy one with a design to it, or add a sheer skirt—but Kate preferred a simple, low-back black leotard and pink tights. Anything else detracted from the real beauty of ballet—the movement, the body, itself. She put on yoga pants and a comfortable t-shirt over it for travel, and then she was out the door, on the way to the studio with Happy.
James’ bedroom was, all told, fairly plain. He hadn’t decorated it with any posters. He didn’t have any pictures tacked to the cork board Tony had put up in the corner when he turned fourteen. The only really personal items he had in the room were on the bookshelves. The books that he had read as a kid lined the shelves, and in front of them were action figures and army men, plastic dinosaurs and little spaceships—remnants from his childhood. He had larger collections at home in California. His eyes came to rest on a little wooden box in the corner, next to a very old Captain America comic. He reached out and took it. He blew a thick layer of dust off the top and ran a hand over it, feeling the smooth wood beneath his fingers. He hadn’t come here for this. He had come to the mansion because Tony said she had something she wanted him to test in the lab—a puzzling request, but James was not about to say no to his formidable stepmother. James traced a finger over the latch on the box. He hadn’t come here for this, but something had drawn him straight upstairs instead of down to Tony’s lab. He took a seat on his bed.
? Peter sure hadn’t. On three separate occasions, Tony wandered into the room with a pack slung across his shoulders, then stopped midway, cursed, and headed back again.
“It doesn’t affect me. Doesn’t mean I don’t drink occasionally,” Steve said easily. The bar tender returned with a pint, and Steve took a long swig just to prove his point.
That was the end of that conversation.
“Of course,” Tony replied. He let her go, feeling a bit embarrassed. He still couldn’t quite believe the gift she had given him.
“We might as well get this elephant out of the room now,” Tony piped up. “Yes, in some distant, far off universe, Steve and I have fucked. Are fucking. There is
“We can always choose to leave,” Steve said. “If we feel that our safety is threatened.”
“You know JARVIS would never let them get hurt,” Tony said.

“It’s settled, then. If you have no objections, I’d like to take the team downstairs for our own meeting,” MCU Steve said diplomatically.
“Then he doesn’t have to be on
“Will he make it there?” Azari asked.
“Hey, I know you need to take the high ground, but I also know it’s pretty damn useless to have four of your guys fighting and one just floating around in the air while everybody else gets assaulted!” Tony fought back.

“Work with the alternates but do not let your guards down, people,” he told them team over the communication systems. “I have no idea where that other Tony found that suit, but he’s obviously more clever than we gave him credit for despite being behind technologically—”

“I shouldn’t have acted the way I did after…everything,” Clint said. “I’m sorry, Katie-Kate. I should know better than anybody that sometimes we fuck up and that doesn’t define us as people.”
Steve argued, but he never shut her down so quickly, or so firmly, or without explanation. Not for something as tiny as a blood sample.
“Because living on the streets of New York City would be so much better than living in my double’s family mansion,” Tony said sarcastically. “What do you think they’re going to do, drug us and harvest our organs for nefarious purposes?”
“Well…all right,” she agreed. “I am a bit tired. If you all need anything, I’m sure Steve will be around to help…but help yourselves to anything in the kitchen, and there’s a rec room Steve can show you. There’s a gym as well, complete with training simulations. You’re free to go anywhere in the house except James’, Peter’s, and Kate’s rooms, of course.” 3490 Tony headed out of the kitchen, yawning as she went. 3490 Steve smiled.
,” Azari said with sudden venom as he shot up to a standing position. Blue lightning shot above Bruce’s head. He heard a thump as a body hit the floor behind him. Azari squatted back down. Bruce was vaguely aware of the fact that the shouting had gotten much more distant—the avengers and their young defenders had pushed the AIM group back outside. There was little else Bruce could do in the middle of this dank hallway with no equipment to speak of. He looked at Azari.
“Not by the time
“Don’t be ridiculous, I bother Azari, too,” Francis said, still cheerfully french braiding Kate’s hair. Peter didn’t even know how to do a french braid. He wondered, briefly, when and why Francis had learned that particular skill.
“I’m not gonna take a picture Flash, come on, put him down. Gordon, Gordon, don’t eat it. Don’t eat it,” said Peter. Oh yeah, Tony remembered with a start. At school, his name was Parker. Peter stood at the edge of the crowd, his oversized hipster camera slung around his neck. Tony had called it that the first time he saw the scrawny son of the Captain running off to school with it. Peter had replied that he might be a hipster, but at least he didn’t need a red and gold suit to compensate for anything. Tony had sputtered at his sass, not expecting it. 3490 Tony just laughed.
“Well,” Steve said, though his voice still felt and sounded rough, “Now that the funeral isn’t needed anymore, I guess it’s time to get them all home.”
get a bad grade Mom threatens to stop letting me go to parties, or take away ballet lessons, or ban me from training with Francis and Clint for a month.” Kate flopped back onto her stomach. “Speaking of, our report cards are coming out soon and I’m probably dead.” She basically muttered that last, head stuck into Peter’s pillow. It smelled like her shampoo because Peter’s had run out a week ago and he was too lazy to buy more and instead kept stealing from her shower. Which probably explained the tampons thing.

of his. But then, in the whole time Steve had known him, Tony had never really let up on that look.
“Oh,” 3490 Tony said, looking at the group. “So I did. I’ll just—” But whatever 3490 Tony was going to do, no one ever found out. At that moment, 3490 Steve Rogers walked into the kitchen. He had an easy, commanding air about him, more so than their Steve Rogers. He was noticeably older, probably by thirty years or so, making him as old as Tony. It was obvious he lived there, and Tony began to wonder if all the Avengers did before 3490 Steve grabbed 3490 Tony about the waist and kissed her passionately.
But Steve couldn’t ease up. He felt like a violin string pulled too taut, winding tighter and tighter and ready to snap. He would get these monsters after his family. He would wipe them from the face of the multiverse if it was the last thing he did—and he knew with a cold certainty that he would do anything needed to get there.
. No super-soldier genes had graced his muscles, and thus Peter was a geeky, defenseless kid the same way Bruce had been. The same way Peter’s father—who had been an inspiration for young, elementary school Bruce—had been. He had none of Tony’s blustering confidence or arrogant charm, either. He had no defenses, not even emotional ones (though, his snarky attitude came close). Bruce was more than a little taken aback to find him able to flip down from the ceiling with all the grace and ease of any of the kids who trained at the Avengers Academy.
“I think we’re all done with the weird shit for this year,” Fury said with some bite. “I’ve exceeded my goddamn quota.”

. He promised, he swore, and I knew Steve’s promises were as good as gold, that a swear he made to a friend was as sacred to him as a marriage vow. And so I turned to him and made him swear that if I went through with the pregnancy he would always be there to raise the kids when I couldn’t, that he would take care of them and make up for me being a shitty mother,” Tony said. Her mouth twisted into a bitter grimace, but she quickly shook it off. “He told me not to be so ridiculous, that I would be a great mother, but that yes, he promised, he swore, he would always be there for the kids.
And so familiar.
Steve turned away from the Red Skull and ran.
“You’ve got nothing to be sorry for, Cap,” 3490 Tony said. She looked apologetic. “I’m sorry too—I didn’t want to have to mention it. I know this must be embarrassing, even if you honestly don’t have anything to be embarrassed about. I just think it’s better if we don’t…get close.”

. Everyone was incompetent in science in her opinion,” MCU Hill said.
“And?” Tony asked. She decided she would have to soften herself up a bit when her double seemed to recoil slightly at her dry tone.
“Tony,” he said. It was the first time he’d spoken her name since that night at the hospital. She looked up at him. He was still so angry. It wasn’t in his face, but it was in his eyes. “I was looking for you.” Tony couldn’t formulate a response. She just stared at him. She knew why he was looking for her, the only possible reason given the evidence before her. He at least had the decency to inform her that he was leaving. When she didn’t speak, he continued, “It’s gotten a little crowded here.”
“Lovely imagery there,” Peter remarked.
Bruce had seen a lot of grisly things in his days as a doctor. He could remember the man who’d had both eyes gouged out in a gang war with perfect clarity, could still smell the piss on the man’s body as his bowels emptied in terror and pain. He could still see kids ripped apart by bombs, could still hear the moans in makeshift hospitals for people undergoing medical treatments without anesthetic as much needed drugs were sorely lacking. He could remember a thousand last days—every sick person, often with a disease that could have been preventable with better health care or cleaner water or safely regulated food or just a roof that wasn’t so drafty. Bruce did not know how much death he had seen. So really, when he looked down at this beaten and bloodied twenty-two year old, Bruce had seen much worse a thousand times over. But that didn’t mean he didn’t realize how dire the situation was. He pushed his glasses further up on the bridge of his nose and rolled up his sleeves as he kneeled on the concrete next to the unconscious boy. Bruce knew with certainty that without the extra help of James’ special genetics, he would already be dead. They didn’t have much time.
“No but

“What?” James heard his brother’s response.

“Oh yeah, you’re so much better than the rest of us,” James said, rolling his eyes. “Tell me, Pete, how has that superior intellect of yours gotten you out of regular ass-kickings at school?
Tony would know later, from the recordings, that the battle was actually quite quick once 199999 showed up. They had experience with these creatures. And they also had a guess as to where they were coming from—a cosmic cube, lodged in a metal device at the top of a building. They worked together with Commander Rogers to take the cube out, and the moment that they did, the signal was lost, and all the Chitauri collapsed to the ground, dead or unconscious or…something.
“Awwww,” Teddy said, moving to join the ‘rejects’ for the session on the other side of the room; they would leave before things got started. Dad had invited a bunch of the most promising students at the academy (plus Peter) to help assess the alternate avengers in fighting technique, teamwork and communication, and ability levels. The team they had ended up with, however, was whittled even further from the invites—Dad had picked a single player per Avenger, trying to match them as best as he could. James was the head of the team, playing as Alt Cap’s equal. Kate had gotten booted off the team in favor of Francis to play Clint’s match—they had decided that Kate’s extra super genes were an unfair advantage. Peter was on the team to play Natasha’s equal, though David Alleyne, a mimetic mutant who had gotten rejected from the Xavier’s after a few questionable involvements, had been another considered option. Torrun was the obvious choice to fight Alt Thor, and Teddy

interesting. Tony was paying very close attention, and he couldn’t help but notice so was Steve. It was too tempting—Tony was fascinated by how these two people fit together. Like an engine Tony had never seen before, all he wanted to do was take them apart, see what made them tick. After all, one of them was

At any rate, Peter was feeling
“Has everybody eaten?” 3490 Steve inquired. James nodded. “Let’s get anyone under 16 to brush their teeth and go to bed.” There was no collective “aw” from the floor or any word of protest. The younger kids decided to get up and start heading to the bathrooms quietly, Ben Banner walking behind them for supervision. 3490 Steve watched them as they left, and only turned back to everyone else once they were gone. His eyes focused sharply on Steve, and then each of the 3490 Avengers in turn.

“I hate just watching,” Steve admitted. Tony frowned.

“So the Captain’s in charge?” Fury inquired. Tony arched an eyebrow.

—better.” They all hit the ground as the Mark 42 swooped over head, Steve shielding them all as it attacked with its repulsors. Tony recalled, in the back of his mind, developing those repulsors. He recalled Pepper coming in, asking him what he was doing, she thought he had stopped making weapons.
look so much as it was an exasperated one.
He’d shared a look with Tony, right before they headed out. There was something silent there that they’d never really had before: understanding. Oh sure, they’d tried. Sometimes. But now, after these months in another universe, after spending far more time with Tony Stark than he’d ever thought he’d spend, Steve felt like he finally understood the other man. Maybe not all the way through. Maybe not one hundred percent—but they knew how the other ticked, now, not just how to tick each other off.
“It was one of our first missions, when we’d just formed the Avengers officially. We’d been about to sit down to breakfast all together at the manor; Tony had gotten donuts. I didn’t know it at the time, but they weren’t just any donuts. She’d flown out to California, picked up Randy’s, and flown back to New York before eight in the morning. I assume she’d been up all night. But the alarms went off, and we weren’t prepared. And things—things went bad pretty fast. We hadn’t really gelled as a team yet, and we made some sloppy mistakes we wouldn’t later. But we hadn’t learned yet. And I’d told Tony before the mission that we needed to stick together and so, of course, Tony being Tony, she took off at some point and disappeared. By the time the dust cleared, we’d won the fight—and Tony had been a huge part of that—but we couldn’t raise her on the comms, and we were all afraid she wasn’t coming back.
“So you gave me my bracelet,” Kate said, able to fill in this last part of the story.

“So…how do you have friends, then? Does anyone know who you are?” Pepper asked, sounding concerned.
“Unless we have help,” Tony said. He didn’t look happy either.
“Sure,” Peter said. “You want me to fetch her back when Dad starts
“Tony,” Steve said, his voice soft and quiet, but commanding all the same. He closed the distance between them and put a hand on his shoulder. He had a little, amused smile on his face. “We’re on kind of a deadline here. I’m not throwing you off a roof again.”
“Ugh, no, that’s even worse. Antonella,” 3490 Tony, Antonella, said. She looked at him pointedly over her coffee cup. “But there is exactly one person who is allowed to call me that and keep his testicles, and you are not him.”

“What?
bad news. The good news is, these holes tend to repair themselves. The bad news is that we simply have to wait until they are both repaired before moving you safely back.” Tony internally winced, waiting for the angry and/or devastated reactions. The only one to speak was Other Steve.
“Yeah?” Steve asked. Internally he winced.
“Uh.”
It had to be weird, Peter reflected. For years and years he’d been off doing the super hero thing and now here he was, watching his kids all get ready to rush into danger instead. Peter knew that in his shoes, he’d definitely be feeling more than a little… unmoored. He supposed it was expected for his dad to look a little sad, with everyone rushing off without him. But what worried Peter was that he didn’t look sad. He looked—vacant.
“Don’t want to get your own sheets messy? Well, it’s not exactly gallant, but—“ Tony said as Steve opened the door and crossed the hall into Tony’s room. He made Tony sit on the bed.

to just yet. Alt Tony just rolled his eyes at his hesitation.
“The breach should close in three minutes,” James’ voice came over the comms. “If we can herd them straight back through it, we’ll have a lot smaller mess to clean up here.”

Really, it was a rhetorical question. Ready or not, they were at their destination five minutes later. Steve hadn’t felt this jittery or this determined before a mission since ’45. The Red Skull brought it out in him, he figured. But the shield on his arm, its familiar, solid weight was a comfort; and, more of a comfort, the team at his back. He wasn’t alone in this. They were going to get through this together—and with a little extra help.

“Want to go somewhere a little quieter?” the brunette—James thought she’d said her name was Lizzie—eventually whispered in his ear, her breath hot on his neck. Considering that she was grinding on him at the time, James found it impossible to say no. She dragged him to one of the lesser-used corners of the club on the middle floor and pinned him against the wall.
“…No?”
“Yeah, yeah, I heard you the first time,” he said, irritated.
,” into her hair over and over, but they both knew it didn’t matter. He was going to leave again anyway.
Tony regarded him with a look that spelled suspicion. Caution. Perhaps, even, if he squinted, sympathy. But if there was any of that last there, it was gone quickly.
“Kate,” he said softly, when it was clear she was determined to stare into her cup. “I am.”
“This area was evacuated last week,” a voice replied beside her. It was her father, staring at the building, expressionless. Kate felt goosebumps rise on her skin. “The only ones inside were Hydra. And maybe Peter. His last GPS ping came from over there.” Her father pointed just a bit of the way down the road. “And then we lost him. But Hydra was swarming inside this building.”
“Of course, sir,” the pretty woman at the desk answered, her eyes flicking briefly to Steve. She ran the card, then handed it back along with two electronic key cards. Tony snatched them and moved quickly to the elevator.
Stark mansion had beautiful gardens. The best part about the gardens, though, was that they were at the moment empty. There were no people whatsoever. There was no Tony chatting animatedly with Clint, no Thor and Jane speaking softly to one another on the couch, no Bruce or Pepper or Natasha reading, no Peter watching television whilst hanging upside down from the ceiling just because he could now, no Kate rushing about getting ready for ballet or archery or any one of the number of things that girl did in her free time. It was just Steve and nature and nothing else. Well, not
arrow that Kate could find no use for—and they were mainly using stunning devices to take out the soldiers. After all, who knew whose ancestor they might accidentally take out if they used lethal force? Not that Kate wanted to use lethal force, anyway.
“If I’m an ass, what are you?” she asked simply. “The innocent victim of this circumstance? A normal girl, being put upon? A star pupil, who has risen through the ranks on all her own merits?”
“All right, all right, enough!” 3490 Steve commanded. Both to Tony and Steve’s surprise, they shut their mouths. 3490 Steve just rolled his eyes. “You’re worse than James and Peter, you know that? B team hit the showers and cool off. We’ll debrief when you’re not still incensed.”

Damn it. Kate had figured they’d
“We can call out a couple of Agents, see if they can’t give us a hand canvassing the area—you stay here, Tony, to let us know when Peter comes back, all right?” Steve said. James, for once, actually had a look of concern on his face.
“Heard James was around, thought I’d come torture him,” Francis said cheerily. He played with the apple as opposed to eating it, tossing it from one hand to the other.
“I think that would be best. Kids, swap teams—Billy, Teddy, Kate, Tommy, David—you’re up. Let’s see how the MCU does against a different skill set,” Mom said.
“Does it matter to you?” he asked.

“Because we’re friends. Aren’t we? And I’d miss you,” Steve said. He shrugged.
“I’ve got apartments beneath this one—you can each take one since we’ll be in New York a lot. I travel extensively and frequently, so you should always keep a suitcase packed and your passport on hand,” Senator Stark said. “Like it here or hate it, that’s your choice, but your time will be easier if you just enjoy it.” Steve guessed that comment was directed at him. He raised an eyebrow, which he knew would peak out over his sunglasses.
And that, at least, James believed whole-heartedly. He’d always known that much.
“I don’t really think it would be that bad,” Peter said. “If someone starts talking to you about something you don’t understand, you just, you know, let them know you’re Alts. Boom, problem solved.” There was an awkward silence. “Or not, ok, whatever.” The Alts lapsed into a slightly more comfortable silence as Kate and Peter waited for the first batch of cookies to be finished and spoke about innocuous things. After waiting through the third and final batch of cookies, Peter and Kate piled them onto a pair of plates and headed up the stairs.

“Ditto,” he replied, and returned to his meal. He watched Torrun out of the corner of his eye. She took a few bites, but ate slowly and not much. It really wasn’t like her. She usually had an appetite to rival James’. James put down his fork.
“I don’t see him anywhere here eith—” Steve stopped as he heard a muffled groan.
“Uh, ok? What do you want me to stick to?” Peter asked.
Woops! There was a chapter posted out of order last update. Please go back and read chapter 65, 'Pedestal'!
“Just once, I’d like to handle the tourists,” Tony grumbled. Steve couldn’t help but grin. Some days he wished they could handle the tourists, too. But his grin faded as they continued watching the coverage of everything that was happening outside. Maybe tourists would be a nice, easy job—but there was nothing he wanted more right now than to help the rest of his team and the 3490 kids. They were still exhausted from the previous fight—they couldn’t keep this pace up forever.
much like the ones he had in Malibu. Even if their passwords weren’t the same, Tony was fairly certain he could hack 3490 Tony’s system and get into the lab. He just wanted to tinker. And maybe he a little bit wanted to see some of 3490 Tony’s toys. Ok, maybe he wanted that a
“Has it only been ten?” 3490 Steve said, his voice teasing. “Feels like ninety.” 3490 Tony swatted him on the arm. He turned to the ‘Alts’ as they had termed the 199999 Avengers and smiled warmly. “Can I get anyone some coffee? Peter should be back soon, the grocery store is just down the street.”
is the right word,” he said. “Come take a look.” Tony moved forward, joining Bruce behind his desk and looking at the screen he had pulled up. It was filled with results and variables, complex equations that, as much as Tony was loathe to admit it, Reed Richards would have an easier time comprehending. This was not her field of expertise.
“Ok, A) do you realize how absurd ‘I was about to kill Bruce’ sounds on so many different levels, and B), he’s not that kind of doctor,” Steve said.

“I’m not sensing any immediate threats,” Natasha said cautiously. “They seem to be exactly what they say they are—other versions of us, trying to help. Commander Rogers told me today that they hope to have the machine to send us home up and running today. If all goes well, we’ll be on our way home before dinner.” Steve did not miss the change in title. He hadn’t been aware that the Steve Rogers of this universe had moved up in rank, but, of course, it made sense. ‘Captain’ was only symbolic, anyway.
When Kate was seven, she remembered her dad got grievously injured. He got injured all the time, but this was the first time Kate could really remember that he had needed to stay in the hospital overnight. He’d been very badly burned, all over his back. He had been laid up in a hospital bed , stomach down, bandaging all over his body. Mom had held her and Peter’s hands and taken them in to visit. It wasn’t for her or Peter’s sake, Kate didn’t think, looking back on it. Her dad had been back (mostly) to normal just a couple of days later. They could have easily been kept at home and just told that ‘daddy is resting’ or something. No, Kate was pretty sure, thinking back on it and recalling how her dad’s face had lit up like a Christmas tree when Kate and Peter ran into the room, her mom had done it for her dad. He’d been hurt terribly and was stuck in a hospital bed—for her dad, Kate knew, there wasn’t anything that would cheer him up more than his family.
“Thanks for coming to my rescue and all,” Peter said as they were lifted out of the basement. “I didn’t think anybody knew I was down there.”
“It was my fault—I tossed Commander Rogers his shield, but I guess it looked like—“

“I had a friend who laughed, too,” Steve said. Tony looked up, his arm still surrounded by the blue of the holograph he was manipulating. “Never stopped, really. He was always cracking jokes, like it was his job. But that wasn’t his job, of course. His job was to be a soldier. His job was to listen to my command. He did that job well. I was the one who didn’t do my job well enough. He wasn’t still laughing when he died.”
“Oh,” Lewis said.
A trick. It had to be a trick. He would not let himself believe this, not even for a second. He could not let himself believe it, for fear of having it ripped away.
“I take my job very seriously,” James informed him. Peter just sighed exaggeratedly and grabbed the spoon. He swallowed some soup.
“Peter, son, we love you, spider powers or none. But I just don’t think you quite understand,” Dad tried to explain, looking pained. Peter wrenched away from his Dad’s warm presence.
—and I don’t even know your first name. I can’t even google you, Giggles,” Senator Stark said, exasperated.
“It’s not about right, Bruce. It’s about Universe Security. We won’t breach their privacy any more than we have to,” Tony said.
“That was an
“I wanted to start off by—by thanking all of you for coming today,” he said. “This is ah, not the kind of funeral Tony would throw, I think. I mean, Tony planned all of this. Everything here today, she orchestrated years ago, when she had cancer, and we thought—well.” He cleared his throat. “But, it’s not really Tony’s style. I think if we—if we saw a funeral that Tony would have liked, we’d see something really spectacular. A viking funeral, maybe? Sail everybody out on her yacht, then set another,
“I didn’t realize until the last second your comm was down,” Tony spoke, his voice oddly modulated by the Iron Man suit. “Glad you kept him talking though, gave me time to get behind him. Someone really should have taught him that if you’re going to stand around land mines as a defense you should probably make sure no one can fly around and knock you right into them.” Tony waved his other hand around, in Steve’s peripheral vision. He had not put it on, but he was holding the gauntlet. He must have snatched it out of midair from the Red Skull; and what was more, dangling from the thumb of it was the chain that hooked onto the space stone.
“Not unless you’ve a direct line to the Great Beyond,” Steve said with a laugh, but Stark’s troubled expression only deepened. “I mean, there’s no one. Thanks for uh, checking in on me, I guess.”

The only way there’s no signal from Extremis is if—I’m sorry. She’s gone.” The room was eerily quiet. They had all expected it. It wasn’t news so much as confirmation. Tears had already been shed, and all the sobs had already been torn out of the Rogers children. All that was left was silence.
“Oh, I will be. Will you?” Stark asked, but he didn’t seem to expect an answer.

matter,” his father said. He sounded upset. James couldn’t bring himself to care. He was too angry. His father sighed, returning his attention to Peter. “Just go to your room, Peter, we’re done here.” Peter, with one curious glance at James, headed down the hall and up the stairs without a word.
Steve turned to look at her. She was beautiful, as she always was. Whether covered in grease or dolled up and perfumed, talking with a mouthful of doughnut or singing very softly to herself when she thought no one was around, wearing baggy sweatpants or a low-back ball gown, Tony was singularly beautiful. At that moment on the beach, her dark curly hair fell about her head in gentle halo, the perfect frame. He would paint her, later, and then feel guilty for doing so. She turned her head then, meeting his blue eyes with her brown, an eyebrow quirked a little bit. “Can you, even? Get old?” Steve thought about it for a moment.
. She’d have to text Steve when she got the chance to let him know the situation.
“Weneedtogettoahospital, weneedtogettoahospital, weneedtogettoahospital—” Billy muttered over and over, his eyes tightly shut.

“How do we have scrambled eggs?” Peter asked, poking at the rubbery substance on his plate and making a face. Kate had to wonder the same thing.
“Hey Uncle Steve,” he replied with an impish grin. If there was any word to describe Francis Barton,
“You’re physically incapable of being polite, aren’t you?” Rogers stated more than asked. “I’d figure someone with that big of an ego could use a psych eval more than me.” Stark just laughed.
“No,” said Natasha, unreadable as usual.
“Pardon me for bothering you, Mr. Stark,” Steve replied sarcastically. “I forgot you’re so busy these days.” He left, feeling angry and upset. Tony generally had that effect.

“Uh, Happy’s taking us,” Peter said, glancing quickly at his sister.

“Run?” Francis asked lightly, a note of stress in his voice.

“I don’t disagree,” James said as amicably as he could, “but I think you also need to recognize that there’s a difference between personal gain and what Peter did. Was it petty? Yeah, probably, I don’t know what happened. Was it the worst thing ever? Does it indicate a problem with Peter, fundamentally, and his personality? No.” His father frowned.
Then again, he really didn’t want to find out.
“Oh, but he will!” 525 Steve said. “He
, but he’d just hunched his shoulders in and walked on bent knees the whole time and it had worked out all right. They’d ended up coming out of a hatch in the floor of what must have been the kitchen once, judging by the relatively small space but massive hearth. There were empty barrels down here now—filled with alcohol, or filled with gunpowder or other weaponry, Kate did not know and did not want to stick around to find out, so, led by Natasha, they crept cautiously through the castle, Kate’s heart in her throat the entire time.
“All right then,” Steve replied, doing his best to mask the uncertainty there. He should never have pushed the issue, should never have flirted the way he had. He was the team leader—what had he been thinking, jeopardizing everything this way?
practicality. But he was wrong. I didn’t really like admitting it, even to myself, but I was happy to get married to him. I was happy to spend the rest of my life, even if it was supposed to be very short, with the best man on the planet, and my very best friend. So really, despite all this elaboration you asked me for, my original point still stands: I married him because I love him. So what brought this on, anyway?”
“I like you just fine, Tony,” he said. “Maybe more than I should.” Tony didn’t have time to process that last sentence, let alone ponder it, before Steve had stood back up. “I’m going to get some coffee—I’ll grab you some, too.” He left abruptly, leaving Tony in the conference room, this time his heart
could she do?” Jane asked.
“No. No, you know what, Cap—it’s not,” Tony said. He took a step forward. “I can’t begin to detail how weird and confusing and bizarre the last few months have been—”
Peppers. Why hadn’t I thought of this before?”
“But—”

“Don’t be a baby. Get going, both of you. I suggest you announce your presence to this world’s avengers loud and clear on the comm channels—otherwise you’ll get blasted out of the sky or off the street,” Kate said. Tony stepped into the armor taking a deep breath. The armor closed in around him. For a quick moment it was dark, but then the HUD lit up.
“Right, Tasha came with you. But—”
y out there. I’m sure the actual Avengers have their hands full—if the other ones want to hide, what’s the big deal?” Katie asked. James could hear the bald man’s shoes squeak as he watched them turn right around abruptly. Katie took a single step back with her right foot.
Peter shrugged, and Tony rolled his eyes.

Tony, his beautiful, ridiculous, eccentric, genius, loving wife waltzed into the kitchen just then and began rummaging about the cupboards. She’d dressed in her favorite Black Sabbath shirt—the one she’d had for longer than she’d known Steve—and simple yoga pants. Tony, he knew, adored yoga pants for working in the workshop because they were “basically pajamas but also semi-acceptable outdoors clothes”. Tony leaned down to pull a pot out of the cabinet, and Steve had to admit—he liked yoga pants, too. As he averted his eyes for decorum’s sake, he noticed that someone else liked yoga pants, too. Well, perhaps he wasn’t someone else, exactly, but enough so.
“That’s not ever going to be you,” Steve said. Tony blinked and stared at him for a moment. “You don’t have Extremis, and you don’t need it. You are Iron Man, even if you don’t have the suit seeping out through your bones.”
. James was going to have to do something. He could slide out from beneath the machine, shield armed and ready to go, defend himself from the rifle, take cover and then throw it at the guy, knocking him off the rafters he now laid on, looking out over the warehouse. He’d have to watch the other two though, they were both armed as well. And where could he take cover? There were a few shipping containers left, but they were made of flimsy wood; they would slow down a hit but not stop it. James grimaced. He might just have to accept the inevitability of getting shot in this situation; he would just have to control
“Well, your Daddy is right, don’t ever repeat it,” James said, putting aside his soup and pulling the little boy up onto his lap. “He’s also a hypocrite. You can tell him I said that.”
Partway through the day, after spending a little surreptitious time in the gym and discovering that his strength was through the roof (stronger, even, than James or Kate or probably even his dad), went back up to the kitchen to eat. Super strength meant a super metabolism—something Peter had observed but never felt. It was weird to be sitting in the kitchen eating all of the leftover spaghetti and then still attacking a jar of peanut butter afterwards. Knowing he would polish it off, Peter didn’t both to even use a spoon. He just licked his finger.
. I thought I might actually get out of work on time today, that I might actually see my husband for dinner today, if you can believe that,” Tony rolled her eyes, approaching the command center. “Hill, get me a blood kit from the med bay, and get me Banner, please. JARVIS put Richards on the line, on one of these four screens here.” There was no way she would be home in time for dinner. She would be lucky if she was on time for
toss you in prison until the end of your stay, clear?”
“To James!” everyone repeated, and the sounds of clinking glass filled the room. When the noises died down, there was a bit of an awkward silence, but Tony, as ever, was the first to break it.
“Blue?” he asked.
“You’re right, it’s not me who should be talking,” 525 Steve agreed amicably. “It’s
