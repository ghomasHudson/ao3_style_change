Sherlock can hear the hiss of Anderson’s voice as clearly as if there was no door between them.
He cannot help himself; Sherlock’s glance leaps from sailor to sailor just to be sure, just so that he can be
“Oh, it’s no concern of mine really. I just thought I would spare you the trouble of trying to figure out what’s in all of these containers by telling you that in fact none of these items are contraband.”
, Sherlock reasons with himself.
Thanks to everyone for leaving comments and giving kudos! I know I sound like a broken record at this point, but really, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. YOU FILL MY LIFE WITH JOY.
He couldn’t manage to take as much of it into his mouth as he would have liked but he compensated with the hand that he’d wrapped around the base, starting up a slow but measured stroking, breathing carefully through his nostrils so he could hollow his cheeks and suck without pausing for breath.
He never mentions Sherlock again.
He tries to summon up some genuine warmth to impart—he’s always liked Molly; there is something solid about her despite her somewhat fragile appearance and her affection for Sherlock is clearly more than just skin-deep. In a way, he feels a funny kind of affinity with her, as he does with those few people in the world who not only manage to put up with Sherlock, but actually seem to appreciate him, cruelty, lack of social skills, eccentricities and all. It’s a rare person who can see past Sherlock’s often-unpleasant veneer to the hidden depths that lie beneath.
“John,” he pleads, not bothering to hide the need in his voice as John’s thumb begins to apply more pressure.
the feel of him, hot and hard and aching under Sherlock’s hands, it’s like nothing Sherlock has ever experienced—Sherlock can feel his own cock bearing heavily down against John’s thigh as his own desire swells in the wake of John’s. He feels John’s fingers tighten against the flesh of his arse in response, dragging Sherlock closer against him.
There’s one critical moment where Molly’s boot slips and Sherlock has to shut his eyes in terror.
since those events—since last he saw John—is inconceivable to him. It feels like an eternity, as though the pall cast over his life at the conclusion of yesterday’s events has always been there, shrouding his days in darkness.
Ferguson stares at Sherlock with open hatred. He’s now within arm’s reach of Sherlock, his voice low and shaking.
The world seems to freeze around Sherlock. He holds his breath, certain he has misheard.
He shook his head, unable to speak around the tightness in his throat.
There’s no point trying to go back to sleep so Sherlock washes and dresses, feeling the sticky heat of the tropical day already settling itself over his skin like an unwanted embrace.
He is not going to linger—he is simply going to take one turn around the deck to see who is there, and then he will return to his room.
The rest is a blur—the memories flickering in and out like images on a poorly focused projector. He remembers falling, and then Sherlock’s arms around him, lowering him into water—he remembers vividly the sensation of being in water—and the terror that Sherlock would leave him again. He wanted to break his nose, but instead he’d kissed him. John had kissed him.
other people and experience that same otherworldly feeling that he’s previously felt only when playing by himself.
Come follow me on
Every step between him and the privacy of his cramped cabin feels like an eternity. Sherlock tucks his head down, walks as fast as he can, prays with every fiber of his being that no one will see him, no one will speak to him.
A chorus of laughter erupts at this remark. One of the men pounds Anderson on the back in triumph.
of it in Sherlock’s mouth feels so good that he finds his hand is moving instinctively again to his own cock, tightening his fist around himself and moving it in a long slow stroke that makes him moan around John’s cock even as he takes it further down, saliva running out of the corners of his mouth.
“Please don’t have any regrets about what happened tonight. What we did… what you showed me… it would kill me to think you had regrets about any part of that.”
The unrest seems to grow at Baynes’ discomfort; no one speaks a word, but there’s a shifting uneasy quality in the assembled men, and Sherlock knows, even though he’s never witnessed any kind of naval punishment before, that the captain’s sentence is excessively harsh. The men’s reaction tells him so as clearly as if the words had been spoken aloud.
As always, when John’s friends express this sentiment towards him, Sherlock finds it difficult to believe, but Stamford does look genuinely pleased to see him.
He sings quietly, presumably so as not to arouse the attention of the man on watch, but the presence of John’s voice at Sherlock’s ear is so intimate, the touch of his breath so warm, so alive against Sherlock’s neck, all Sherlock can think is that John’s voice is only for him. The words in the song seem to speak it true.
But then he is turning, his eyes searching the shadows between the bulwarks where Sherlock stands.
“You know me.” John cracked a smile. “I’m slippery like that.”
The feel of it—John in his mouth pushing into him, stroking him, hot and slick and wet, makes Sherlock melt, at the same time as it incites a fire inside him that feels as though it can never be quenched. It’s not enough. He needs more, so much more.
he thinks, as he tugs the ink well toward him.
, it feels so good.
Miss Gibbons and Miss Long both lean eagerly forward.
The prospect of never having to see any of their disappointed faces again, to be confronted with their disapproval, their regret at having brought Sherlock into the world—it offers its own kind of relief.
There’s a somewhat weighted pause before Sherlock speaks.
“And I’m going to look and look.”
Sherlock sat up, and just as John had predicted, there was a fine mist of powdered sugar coating the top of his dark head like freshly fallen snow.
The man does not spare a second glance for Sherlock. He shoves past him and is out running into the sunlight of the ship’s waist.
“Christ, Sherlock.”
There is a pause while John digests this information and the implications that come with it.
“It’s in my—ah!” John bucked forward into Sherlock’s hand as Sherlock pushed a slick finger into the crease between his buttocks. “In my suitcase,” he panted. “There. By the door.”
await them, or at least, those members of the group eager to spend their hard-earned coin on whatever vices the port has to offer.
When he does so, space on the ship transforms again so that it seems as if Sherlock is walking through the rooms of some abandoned house or tavern, the corridors between each empty room stretching on and on.
He spares a moment to dry himself off, watching out of the corner of his eye as John reaches for the soap and begins to clean himself in a series of quick, efficient movements that Sherlock suspects must be second nature to John now after years of life at sea.
Anderson is standing, watching him, unmoving. There is something about his utter stillness, the unwavering quality of his stare that makes Sherlock’s skin crawl. His face is vivid with bruises from where Sherlock hit him yesterday; the skin around his nose badly swollen, and Sherlock cannot help but experience a savage jolt of pleasure at the knowledge that he is responsible for the violent markings on Anderson’s injured face.
“I simply explained to him that Anderson wasn’t doing his job properly, that he was misusing his position of authority.”
Lestrade rushed forward to intervene but John had already seized Sherlock by the elbow. He could feel Sherlock shaking with rage under his hand.
capacity.
Mr. Graves casts his disapproving gaze over Colonel Jackson’s robust figure where he stands beneath him.
“You’re extraordinary, Sherlock.”
“Oh god…”
the work going around them—is being done by people who have been enslaved—stolen from their homelands across the Atlantic Ocean and shipped to foreign shores where they are worked to the death.
Well, to be fair, that part
John stays where he is, crouched by Sherlock’s knees, and Sherlock lifts himself up on his elbows to look down at John, where he is leaning forward to settle his palms on Sherlock’s shins.
John suppressed a moan. “This isn’t…”
John smiles down at him and then rolls his hips deliberately into Sherlock’s, dragging their cocks back into alignment and causing Sherlock to let out a guttural moan.
Sherlock nods, breathless, lips still stinging from the taste of the rum and he watches John’s eyes drop to his mouth as he licks his lips.
“I have an idea,” he said, hands gliding back down the insides of Sherlock’s thighs until his thumbs stroked the twin curves of Sherlock’s buttocks, pulling them gently apart. “Pass me a pillow.”
When Sherlock opens his eyes again, finally satisfied with the storage of his new memories after shifting a whole portion of now unnecessary clutter out of the old night-nursery to make more room for John, he is relieved to find that his headache is mostly gone.
“Well then, as your superior officer I override your decision, and request that Mr. Jackson remove himself from the quarterdeck at once.”
“Do you have any idea who might be responsible?”
In any case, there will be more of this very soon!
He needs some proof; some confirmation to convince him this is real.
John kissed him again, unable to keep the smile off his face. “I really do. And I love you all the more for it.”
At John’s words, Sherlock suddenly realizes that the material on his back is soaked through with sweat. It suddenly occurs to him how ridiculous he must look, fully outfitted in jacket and waistcoat in the midst of all the bare-chested sailors. He shrugs out of his jacket, rolls his sleeves up to his elbows, and tugs his neck cloth loose. The relief he feels is immediate. He never realized painting could be so much work.
John could hear the savage triumph in Sherlock’s voice, even if he hadn’t been able to see it on his face, but John could see that very clearly too as Sherlock grinned up at him with wolfish pleasure, his teeth gleaming in the muted light from the lanterns through the fog.
Before he can follow after Molly though, John stops him, catching him gently by the arm.
“Good,” John says, offering Sherlock a final blinding smile before straightening up. “I think I know just the song.”
For one desperate moment he thinks of telling Miss Hooper everything—about his fear and his misery and his longing, of his love for John and his terror at what might be happening to him at any given moment, his hatred of Anderson and what he’s done, his utter despair at being rendered so helpless to intervene—but even as he thinks it, he knows that he cannot.
, Sherlock, you—touching yourself while I… f-fuck your mouth…”
John watched Briggs go utterly still.
As the boundaries between them had come down, the edges of their lives locking together as neatly as two pieces of a puzzle, the physical space between them had begun to evaporate. Their unspoken communication was almost seamless. John could anticipate when Sherlock would ask him for things, reading the question in Sherlock’s eyes when he was uncertain, reaching out to offer Sherlock his phone before Sherlock had even opened his mouth; every day drifting closer and closer to Sherlock, like a planet caught in his orbit.
“Are you suggesting it was dumb luck that he happened to bring Watson to your aid?”
“Come for me, love. Now. I need it.”
She looks worried so John tries his attempt at a smile again. Mistake. He sees her visibly recoil at the expression on his face.
Billy nods slowly, eyes wide. “I’ve never seen him so angry, sir. He went all still and cold but I could see fire in his eyes.”
“Likewise, I’m sure.”
Sherlock waits until Anderson has vanished from sight before going over to the boy who’s still sitting where he fell, his cheeks flushed dark with shame.
He dreams of a city sunk beneath the sea, its spires and turrets coated dark with algae, the delicate majesty of its intricate architecture now home for schools of fish. Where light once shone upon its rooftops, radiant and clear, now shadows creep and stretch dark fingers over crumbling stone. Eels wind their way through the arches in the colonnade and polyps climb the spines of buildings like multi-colored hands. Where panes of glass once gleamed silver in the sunlight now blank windows gape like empty eyes.
He loves worshipping John like this, he loves hearing the break in John’s voice, the breathless singing way he says Sherlock’s name—all the different cadences in his lovely expressive voice as Sherlock tastes him, finds new ways to bring him pleasure. If only this could be his profession, his one purpose in life—to give John Watson pleasure—he would never ask for anything else.
John arched up off the couch as his orgasm ripped through him.
Something in his voice must call John back because he turns, one hand on the doorknob, and in the soft light of the candle Sherlock can see for the first time the mask John has put in place fall away, and at the naked longing in his face something in Sherlock’s chest breaks open.
“Will you…” John licks his lips, his lashes heavy. Sherlock can see his body trembling faintly. “Touch yourself for me, now?”
It’s only after he’s made it to the stifling darkness of his room that he realizes he forgot to say thank you.
If John is surprised by the question, he only looks it for a moment. Then his face is softening into a look of tenderness. “Oh, love. Sally is a good friend of mine, but there’s nothing between us anymore.”
“Were you…” John stared at the stem of his own wine glass, unable to meet Sherlock’s eyes. “Would you have kissed me that night? If we hadn’t been interrupted? If Lestrade hadn’t called about the case?”
Sherlock holds up the chain around his neck that John has given him, adding, “He gave me this to show I’m acting on his orders.”
Sherlock remembers with fear the fading bruises like a collar around his neck, and is suddenly, savagely grateful for the semi-darkness of his cabin.
“John, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t—” He would babble, and John would kiss him quiet, pushing his tongue in between Sherlock’s lips, twining it around Sherlock’s own tongue, tasting the sound of his whimpers where they issue from low in his throat.
John kisses him quiet, crowding him back against the door, his sweet mouth hot against Sherlock’s own. He lifts his fingers to tangle briefly in Sherlock’s curls.
Sherlock drops down to one knee in order to be eye-level with the boy. “What did he say, Billy? When he found out? Was he angry?”
The pressure of the condescending voice inside his head is getting more and more difficult to resist.
But as soon as the thought enters Sherlock’s mind, he dismisses it as implausible.
The thought of her makes Sherlock’s heart beat painfully fast. Just the invocation of her name fills Sherlock with a vicious, wounded curiosity. What did she look like? What color was her hair? In what state were her teeth? Was her voice soft or shrill? What were the first words she spoke to John? How slender was her waist? What passed between them? Did John ever take her hand in his? Did he kiss her?
He wouldn’t have heard Sherlock approach but the tiny bell on the shop door gave him away. Sherlock didn’t sit; he walked down several steps and hovered nervously at John’s side. John didn’t look up but he could feel the concern emanating from Sherlock like a faint pulse.
against the cool pane of the window,
Sherlock’s mouth goes dry with horror. He finds himself stricken once again by the dual shock of Miss Hooper proving far cleverer than he had assumed, and voicing sentiments that he is daily haunted by.
“Oh yes, that’s lovely. Yes,” John breathed in a low rush of adoration, placing his warm palms on the inside of Sherlock’s knees and stroking them up toward the heat between Sherlock’s legs.
Sherlock swings his legs out of bed and notices, as he does so, the bottle of oil, lying where he left it, beside him on the mattress.
Sherlock can tell he’s trying to brag about the opportunity, but there’s something in Ferguson’s voice that rings false, that makes Sherlock suspect that Ferguson had no interest in coming to India at all, and it isn’t just the aura of bitterness that Ferguson seems to carry around with him wherever he goes, that resentment that seems to hang around people of Ferguson’s class—like polish worn off a cheap replica of a counterfeit good.
His cheeks blush hot in the wake of his own request, but also because of the lewdness of what John has just said.
Why hasn’t John written back by now?
The glimmer of fire that lies at the center of John has rarely had cause to make itself known, but now is one of those times when Sherlock can see it blazing out of him, can see why John survived being pressed to sea with no knowledge of seamanship, why he was able to endure three years in service at war with the French, loading the cannons and lowering the sails in the heat of battle, three years spent up to his knees in blood and bilge-water sawing off men’s legs in the stinking bowels of ships that were being blown to pieces all around him.
Sherlock’s mouth against his was as soft as the sound he had made when John had taken him in his hand. Nothing Sherlock ever did was soft—and this softness, this new tenderness, was all for John.
“Oh, that terrible clanking night and day, night and day!” Mrs. Whitehall all but wails. “Why it’s hideous! It keeps me up half the night. Henry never hears it of course.”
Sherlock ducked his head to kiss John’s mouth, his fingers still tight around John’s wrists. He kissed him slowly, sweetly, licking his way into John’s open mouth, like John’s mouth was some rare delicacy to be savored.
Lestrade raises a hand for silence.
John made a keening sound, arching his back in an attempt to prolong the sensation.
The words seem to break Sherlock’s spell—either that, or his body decides he simply cannot bear any more, and before he’s made the decision to do so, he is running from the room, almost colliding with the porter on his way into the dining room, tearing down the hallway and back to his cabin.
Sherlock spends the rest of John’s free shift deducing various details about members of the crew. When he’s done every available seamen in view, he moves onto the passengers, which somehow still manages to impress John even though he knows very little about any of them.
“You look like you could use a drink,” John says, reaching into his jacket to pull out his flask. He passes it to Sherlock, who takes it gratefully, and takes a long sip. He doesn’t cough at all this time. The burn of the liquor in his throat and belly is a welcome one.
Using his long fingers to grasp the base of John’s cock, Sherlock worked his tongue in a slow circle around the tip.
The look on the doctor’s face shifted again, this time to one of barely concealed contempt.
“How many people in this city, John, have been brought here against their will?”
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John murmured, trailing one hand down the delicate web work of his ribs that stood out as he stretched. “I think you’re the one that needs to be worried right now.”
He readjusted his arm on Sherlock’s waist and moved him toward the stairs, but Sherlock wasn’t helping. He had pulled his face in against the side of John’s and his lips were currently moving over John’s ear.
John waited.
John lets out a long breath, dropping his hands from Sherlock’s shoulders. “I don’t know, Sherlock.” It’s as if all the weariness has returned suddenly to his body; he looks wrung out, exhausted. “I don’t know if it is.”
The awfulness of this sentiment seems to hang heavy in the air.
Sherlock nods to show he's understood, unable to speak around the sudden pressure in his throat.
His eyes were shut, the dark smudge of his eyelashes like twin shadows against his pale cheeks, the lines of his expressive eyebrows drawn together in an expression close to one of pain.
“Um… I didn’t. S-seventeen, sir.”
He thinks of how the room transforms when John is here with him, the way the candlelight seems to warm and fill the dingy space, how the four rough-hewn walls take on a different quality, become a private sanctuary that could be worlds away from the surrounding chaos of the ship.
“When will I see you again?” he blurts, so panicked he forgets to feel self-conscious about the question.
Everyone looked at Sherlock, waiting for the inevitable explanation.
However, every part of the letter that seems as thought it might have contained useful information appears to be missing—gone in the unthinking consequences of Sherlock’s juvenile fury.
Moriarty’s fingers skimmed the skin above his hips. John could feel the repugnance in the gesture, as though in touching John he feared he might contract some disease, contaminate himself.
When Redbeard died, he replaced the grand entryway downstairs with Redbeard’s favorite meadow so that Redbeard could run and run through the sunshine all within the structure of Sherlock’s family home.
Ferguson grunts in affirmation and lights it for him, and as Sherlock takes the first puff of tobacco, he remembers all at once, how much he misses smoking.
The captain seizes Sherlock by the hair and pulls him from the bed into the corridor. John, leaping after, his nudity somehow rendering him all the more glorious, his body lit up by the splendor of his fury like Achilles charging in the heat of battle, jaw clenched and muscles gleaming, but before he can reach Sherlock’s side, he is restrained. It takes half a dozen men to seize him, and when they finally succeed, his arms pinned to his heaving sides, John roars like a lion they have chained.
John drew his knees up against his chest, gritting his teeth to force himself to continue speaking. Here was the part he had never wanted to confess to Sherlock, the part that showed him for what he really was, that revealed that his attraction for Sherlock had just been another result of Moriarty’s manipulations. But he had to do it now so that Sherlock knew the whole truth. Otherwise, Sherlock would continue to mistakenly think he was responsible for all of it.
Rage fills Sherlock—irrational and swift.
Sherlock feels stung—betrayed, even if he knows that isn’t fair.
Before he can decide what set of exercises to do next, he has fallen asleep.
The strange pink light of the dying day was still just visible over the tops of the trees outside—one wavering patch of it pale and shimmering against the bathtub tiles—and John was hesitant to turn on the light and chase away the strange lovely impression it made. He paused just a moment before letting go of Sherlock’s hand to switch it on.
John’s eyes are shut, his temples slick with sweat, his whole body shuddering as it sinks back down against the bed.
Sherlock stares at the steaming bucket for another few moments in mesmerized rapture.
To his great relief, Miss Hooper is there, seated as ever in the domineering shadow of her chaperone, Ms. Grimsby. She gives Sherlock a tentative smile as he seats himself at the other end of the table.
John let his lips brush the part in Sherlock’s hair and smelled the bitter antiseptic smell of hospital.
John was so sick of this; sick of being unable to control his body's responses while Sherlock read him like a book, laying him bare one piece at a time. It wasn't fair; he was tired of always being the vulnerable one, tired of being manipulated.
“God, Sherlock, yes. Please.”
“Sherlock!”
John let out a hard breath. “If I had known—”
“What?” he asked, breathlessly.
The hot throb of his own desire suddenly feels as though it’s choking him.
However, based solely on what he had observed so far, John could deduce that this first time between them might be relatively brief.
The lights in the kitchen went dead.
“I was the one who pointed out that this time would be best because Andersen isn’t on duty,” Billy adds, looking so full of pride now that Sherlock is afraid he may burst. “They said I could help keep a look out.”
“Have we been invited to this ah… gala event?”
, and John had said he’d brought his opponent to the floor.
“Oh, my darling.”
…” His voice going faint as Sherlock presses gently with just one finger. “Please will you—”
Sherlock’s whole body is tingling. He feels as though he has caught fire.
I am posting this new chapter on an auspicious day--on June 5th, SEVEN YEARS AGO, I posted the very first chapter of OFD! So today is OFD'S BIRTHDAY! *blows small party kazoo and flings rainbow confetti* Happy 7th Birthday, OFD!
He feels John’s heels digging in on either side of his spine and he wonders, distantly, if John is coming too, but before he can piece together how he might help facilitate that his elbows are buckling, his body collapsing against John’s chest as pleasure unravels his last ounce of muscle control.
And then finally—finally,
It is a frightful realization.
“I couldn’t—” Sherlock is encouraged by what he hears in John’s voice, but he is still too shy to look up and confirm it. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you. I couldn’t… I couldn’t think of anything else.”
He can feel his body seizing up against John’s as pleasure overtakes him, his hips driving forward into John’s hand, John’s fingers clenching hard on his arse as he shoots his release, hot between their bodies.
“Oh John,” he breathes, reaching for the piece John has torn off for him as if he were accepting the sacrament—something reverent, almost indecent in Sherlock’s sigh of ecstasy upon taking it into his hands.
Sherlock sees the flash of answering curiosity in John’s eyes. He presses his tongue in at the corner of his smile as he considers Sherlock.
And as always, if you'd like to come stalk me on tumblr, please
you escape being burned to death?”
John reaches down to push the sweat-soaked hair off of Sherlock’s brow, his eyes full of tenderness and something else, something that seems to spark like a living flame at the center of each iris.
His bed is cold when he climbs into it—his shoulder is already aching. He turns over on his side, squeezes his eyes shut, and listens to the sound of his pulse throbbing against the mattress. He tries to breathe deeply to calm his beating heart when he hears the door to his room open.
“Just—”
Sherlock looks over at John—at his cheeks flushed dark from the exercise, his blue eyes bright in the direct light of the sun, pupils shrunk to almost invisible pinpricks. Other than the color in his cheeks, he doesn’t even look winded from the exertion.
“Good,” he said, pressing another kiss to John’s hip as John obediently spread his thighs. “Just like that.”
“I’m waiting for John!” Sherlock blurts out. “Have you seen him?”
Sherlock feels amazement filling him up, hot and sweet, like a mouthful of the strong spirits John drinks.
Sherlock watches John descend the ladder as if in a dream.
He cannot keep the smile from his face. “Really?”
of waiting.
he sees him it’s as though it is the first.
I didn’t…” Sherlock shook his head, both hands suddenly coming up to cover his mouth in an anguished gesture. “No wonder you didn’t want to see me. What he did to you… I—” He raised his hands helplessly and then let them drop at his sides, shifting his weight off of John’s legs, his face stricken. He looked down at John, and John realized that the expression on his face was not horror but fear. “Can you ever forgive me?”
Matthews is the first to notice their approach. He breaks away from the small group and comes down the deck to meet them.
“See? They don’t even mind it.” He was smiling a sick, self-satisfied smile, watching the expression on Sherlock’s face. “You think these animals feel pain like we do? They don’t. Here’s a little game I like to play—how many shots does it take to stop ’em?”
It’s only after John has left, that the full force of Sherlock’s unhappiness makes itself known, breaking over him like a wave. He sinks down onto the bed, his shoulders bowing with the weight of his grief.
The angst will abate very, very soon, I promise! Thanks for all your lovely comments so far and your support on this story. Can't wait to hear what you all think of this installment. :)
Sherlock might turn his nose up at it, but even his refusal of it is a luxury John can never afford.
John resists, laughing. “Wait a minute, let me just get the rest of these things off.”
“Start your punches right by your face and keep your motions tight. Follow through is everything. Keep your arm level with your shoulder, and always bring your hand right back to your face. Good, just like that. Feel the power that’s coming from your hips? Bring the tops of your knuckles just below your eye level, and snap the hand back—good!”
“You can’t leave already! You’ve only just come back. Stay for one drink!”
Sherlock let out a strangled yell, his body clenching hard around John’s fingers, hips thrusting up, and then he was coming, shooting into John’s mouth in pulse after pulse as his orgasm ripped through him.
He double checks to be sure that no one up on the quarterdeck is taking any notice of where he’s standing by the capstan down below, and then, assuming every iota of confidence he possesses, Sherlock strides past the sailor at the helm and through the door under the quarterdeck leading to the captain’s quarters.
He was tempted to make Sherlock articulate just exactly
Sherlock feels a smile stealing over his face; he can’t help smiling in response to Billy’s sheer delight. “Thank you, Billy.”
This sets them off again.
Sherlock bristles at his own twinge of guilt.
Sherlock’s eyes perform another careful sweep of the surrounding deck before answering. “I’ve spoken with Lestrade since then and he is unwilling to investigate the matter further for fear of negative repercussions. As you can imagine, he feels compelled to dissuade my further involvement as he fears in doing so I put my own life at risk.”
He’s never heard John like this before. There is such a cold resolute quality to his voice, as if hope is a concept completely unfamiliar to him; as if he’s never known anything but sorrow. The contrast between this and John’s normally bright disposition makes it all the more troubling.
He rotated his shoulder cautiously and then flexed his arm, trying to ascertain the depth of the cut. It was bleeding freely now, soaking the sleeve of his shirt, but that was more than likely a result of the rain.
“I told him I knew who took the ship’s manifest from his cabin.”
He declines to acknowledge the Colonel, but he turns instead to Sherlock, features still twisted in a sneer of pure hatred.
Tongues and cocks, he thinks. Yes, they are definitely two of his favorite body parts.
“You got the raw end of the deal this morning,” John said, lips returning to the hollow of Sherlock’s throat, then skimming down until they caught on the edge of Sherlock’s robe. “I plan to make it up to you.”
“Alright,” Sherlock says stiffly. “I won’t.”
It was several moments before he collapsed on his side, his stomach sticky with his own semen, his heart hammering in his ears. He rubbed his hands over his face, a feeling of horror descending to replace the hot intensity of what he had been imagining only moments before.
He’s again struck with the fruitless desire to do something to help them both but he isn’t sure what he can do. So he leaves her alone, lets her go back to her room without questioning her further.
Miss Hooper shakes her head, eyes fixed firmly in her lap. “No. As you can imagine it’s… well, it’s nearly impossible to speak with anyone without my Aunt’s approval.”
“I think it’s really romantic actually. I mean… it’s obvious how much he likes you.”
“That song—” Sherlock tries again but is immediately overwhelmed by the inadequacy of language. How can he possibly convey to John what it was like to hear him play?
“You know perfectly well what I’m talking about.” Ferguson lowers his voice several degrees but not low enough that Sherlock can’t hear his next words. “The document,” he hisses. “The document I described to you in confidence. It’s gone missing and you’re the only one who knows I have it. Where is it?”
John kicked out at Sherlock hard, but Sherlock dodged the blow, throwing his weight forward to push John down on his back against the bed, pinning him by his wrists. Before John had a chance to react, Sherlock had climbed astride his hips, straddling him, pushing down with his knees to keep John’s legs still. He leaned down over him, one dark spiral of rain-swept hair spilling into his eyes.
“No. For… earlier. For everything. Thank you for… for what you did.”
“We tease each other a lot—it’s part of our rapport. I can tolerate teasing as well as any man, better than most actually. But this morning, they were teasing me about… where I was last night.” John clears his throat conspicuously, lifts his chin, his spine straightening imperceptibly to make himself taller even as he’s sitting down. “They were teasing me about us.”
that was how you felt.” Sherlock can see the wry glimmer of John’s grin through the darkness. “But I had to be certain before…”
“I do believe, my dear Bartholomew, that you are entirely mistaken. I heard from Mr. Jackson earlier this afternoon that the sort of primitive rituals to which you are referring are precisely what Lieutenant Lestrade and the captain wish to avoid. No, no, this is meant to be a far more civilized affair.”
John didn’t like it. He didn’t like it one bit.
“J-John?” It takes all of Sherlock’s self-control to break free of John’s warm, insistent mouth.
Sherlock shakes his head.
“Oh, but I think you do.” Sherlock’s mouth climbed higher and then paused hovering over John’s, and John could feel the unsteady rhythm of Sherlock’s breath against his parted lips. “I think that’s exactly what you want.”
“But he’ll fall!”
Instead he sits rigidly with his hands clenched at his sides, aching with the wrongness of not touching John, but too afraid to reach out to him and somehow make it worse.
There was something forgiving about the darkness that allowed for this moment, that seemed to open up a space for intimacy that had never been possible before.
They are both witness to the incredible splash made by the anchor as it is finally dropped into the sea, the rattle of the chain as it’s pulled up from the depths of the ship louder than Sherlock would have imagined possible. The feeling of the ship connected—however distantly—to solid earth once more is enough to make something that’s been tightly wound in Sherlock’s chest loosen slightly.
Then they are standing, shirtless, breathing hard together in the dark, and Sherlock is momentarily grateful for the fact that they did not stop to light the candles because he is certain that if he could see John now, the rise and fall of the muscles in his heaving chest, the hard gleaming lines of him, the storm-dark flashing of his eyes—he would not be able to go on standing.
The comment makes Sherlock’s jealousy flare up, hot and bright again, but the grin on John’s face as he says it is so absolutely, heart-stoppingly gorgeous that Sherlock forgets the feeling as quickly as it comes, his body arching up into John’s hands almost of its own volition.
Terror wiped his mind clean. John thrashed, senseless, kicking his legs as hard as he could to throw the body off.
It’s almost unbearable—the force of his love for this man. John is like heat—like light—like the heart of a star; he is too good, too bright for Sherlock to contemplate without feeling seared to the core of his being, too much to hold in his mind at once. He should be impossible. No human should be able to have all the qualities that John has—to walk the yardarm with the casual grace of a dancer, to fight three Frenchmen with blood pouring out of his side and emerge victorious, to sing so softly and sweetly even after all the suffering he’s faced, his smile, so lean and bright and full of heat, bringing out the color in his eyes as blue as the ocean’s waves—and yet there he sits, within Sherlock’s reach.
The pacing alone would be sign enough that the anger is still with him, but now that Sherlock can see him better, he can see evidence of it everywhere in his body; there is tension in the line of his jaw, in the taut muscles of his forearms, in the continual twitch of his fingers as though they long to tighten into fists.
Sherlock drops back against his pillow, exhausted just from the effort of lifting his head to drink.
“I am intending to eat the equivalent of all the breakfasts I did not eat throughout the week. I would say I’m about halfway there.”
The expression on John’s face is transformed, the hunger in his eyes like two low fires burning.
“What will it take? To convince you how much you mean to me?”
The ease with which John moves him closer makes Sherlock think back to the last time they were together, down in the shadows of the orlop deck, and how easily John lifted Sherlock in his arms, the bulge of the muscles in his biceps under Sherlock’s hands.
John swallowed and lifted his chin, blinking hard, glad that Sherlock didn’t see. He didn’t think he had the words to explain how this was affecting him.
The brief spark ignited by his conversation with Miss Hooper is already fading, like a match that won’t catch, and by the time he reaches the gloom of his cabin, the flicker of brightness has gone out, and sorrow has returned to his chest, heavy as a stone.
“My god, Sherlock… how can you not realize it?”
“Very good,” Dimmock says. “Now get back to work!”
The captain is an intelligent man. Even if his intent had been to put Lestrade out of commission for a few days, he would know that someone had intervened to make him well again. And if Anderson had told the captain about seeing Sherlock, he would know John was involved in the matter.
He did feel compelled to apologize to Lestrade when they arrived, which turned out to be a good decision as he was overtaken by a fit of hysterical giggling when Sherlock told Anderson he looked like an underfed iguana. Lestrade simply raised an eyebrow and attempted to hide his amusement without much success. When Anderson started shooting him evil looks, he decided to go stand quietly by himself for a while until he managed to calm down.
“Thank you.”
He falls to his knees beside his bed, groping in the darkness until his hands find the contours of the case, easing loose the straps and drawing it towards him with infinite tenderness.
The mug shattered, sending lukewarm tea and shards of fractured mug in every direction.
“Tell me one thing though…” John reached behind him for the bowl of ice he’d left on the dresser. He dipped his hand into the icy water and then placed his open palm against the fading flush on Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock gasped sharply. He ducked his forehead to Sherlock’s mouth, his voice a murmur. “Haven’t I given you a reason to like the heat?”
He sits in an agony of hesitation, the tip of the quill against his bottom lip, searching for some manner of expressing all he felt in that moment. How can he put into words the experience of feeling as though his soul had evacuated his body before John’s letter came, only to have it come flooding back to him again upon its arrival? How can he tell John that his letter saved Sherlock from potentially beating himself to death against the walls of his own cabin in misery?
Sherlock winces internally at the violincello’s plodding rhythm and helps himself to a glass of punch to give himself something to do. He makes his way to a far corner of the room—as far as possible from the industrious musicians—and stands between two guttering candles with his back to the wall, wondering suddenly why on earth he decided to show up at all.
John pauses, and Sherlock can hear something in his voice shift imperceptibly at this particular detail.
“He said a lot worse than he did. It wasn’t—” John clenched his trembling hands under the water. “It really wasn’t anything.”
They finally stop to refill their glasses and catch their breath, and it is only when he lowers his instrument that Sherlock realizes how long they have been playing. His fingers are filled with a buzzing sting; it’s been so long since he has played his calluses are almost gone. His forehead is damp with sweat, all his earlier efforts to tame his hair rendered ineffective as several dark curls have slipped free and are hanging over his brow.
He’s breathing through his nose hard and fast—he can hear the sound of it harsh in his ears. His lips are tingling; there is drool sliding out of the corners of his mouth and dribbling down his chin; his jaw is aching worse than ever, but all of these discomforts somehow only sharpen his arousal.
“Is that alright?”
He smoothes his thumbs over the bones just behind Sherlock’s ears.
He refuses to let Sherlock take him to the hospital. Sherlock brings it up after Mrs. Hudson’s gone back downstairs, breaches the subject in a roundabout, casual way but John shakes his head.
He wants to fight back, to argue.
John nods, but does not step away, his eyes alighting briefly on Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock can feel all of a sudden that John is experiencing the exact same irresistible pull towards himself that he is experiencing towards John.
He’s praying that John has been listening to the exchange and that he’ll take the opportunity to make his exit now that they’ve all filed into Sherlock’s room.
He licks his lips, forcing himself to hold John’s gaze, relishing the sight of John’s pupils growing darker before his eyes.
It’s like trying to read a sheet of parchment that is utterly, frustratingly blank.
He stroked his hand up Sherlock’s length; felt his hips twitch closer at the movement, hearing the little moan caught in Sherlock’s throat.
Sherlock recognizes him instantly by the sound of his approach—the heavy, dragging tread is unmistakable.
John’s eyes are growing softer by the minute. Now they are the color of sea-glass worn smooth. “It’s… beautiful.”
He knows whatever it is John has planned, it will be brilliant.
“Would you… I mean—”
He scarcely notices; he’s so focused the implications of what he’s just overheard.
Never in his life has he longed for a bath as badly as he does now. He’s fantasized about baths for weeks at sea, with only the occasional basin of cold water to splash on his hands and face. Granted, the small bucket of hot water is not large enough for Sherlock to immerse himself in fully, not like a proper bath, but just the fact that the water is clean and hot is a wonderful prospect.
He hauls the shirt up off John’s shoulders and over his head, John growling in frustration at having to separate from Sherlock for even a moment, and the sound does something to Sherlock—he can feel the effect of it low in his belly—and suddenly it’s all he can do to continue standing upright as John’s mouth slides down the front of his chest, fingers moving like quicksilver over the buttons of his waistcoat, pulling them apart and pushing the fabric off of Sherlock’s shoulders.
John sat, looking out at the rain, terrified that if he lost hold of his rage, his fear would overwhelm him.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say.
He moans again, clenching his fingers hard around his cock to stop himself coming.
He tasted of salt; he tasted like the sea.
—Sherlock can feel the twitch of his cock as his body stiffens and he has to pull off slightly to keep from choking, but he feels the first warm burst of John’s release against his tongue, and he feels something primal go off in him at the sensation, making him swirl his tongue around the head and then pull all the way off so he can lick, open-mouthed over the slit of John’s cock.
Sherlock shakes his head, breathless from the sudden intensity of John’s tone. He seems to be growing brighter with rage before Sherlock’s eyes, like a coal gathering heat at the center of a fire.
“So what shall we do this morning, Mr. Holmes? I am entirely at your disposal.”
“Sherlock, what in god’s name—”
“It nearly ruined me.” Sherlock drew a shallow breath, his head on John’s chest. “Keeping myself from you.”
“Call me Sherlock.”
John felt a burst of emotion at the gesture—white-hot and searing—so intense it was like a lick of pure flame.
He looked out at the city to distract himself from thoughts of Sherlock’s mouth and the lovely shape it made when he sucked. Out on the balcony, the glow of the city was brighter than ever. John could see the illuminated spires of St. Stephen’s Cathedral dominating the skyline. In the crisp winter air, each twinkling pinprick of light looked like a star, rendering the city beneath them into an inverted night sky. The lights along the river, reflected in the water, doubled the impression. It was beautiful.
John drops down into a crouch in front of him.
Sherlock closes his eyes briefly, feels the dread coiled in his belly tense like a snake.
for John Watson. He understands the conviction because he feels exactly the same.
Sherlock looked up at him, mouth still around John’s cock. A shudder of pleasure went through him at the sight.
“Let me make it up to you. You’re not alone anymore. I’m here now. I’m here.”
Sherlock interprets this as a sign that he too might share the bucket of paint, and he tentatively reaches over to wet his brush.
No, thinking about it won’t do him any good. It will only make him feel more afraid, and Sherlock certainly doesn’t need to feel any more afraid than he already is.
Sherlock stared back at John, searching, desperate.
Billy lingers a moment more, his expression agonized, and then says: “He’ll be here. Tomorrow morning. You can ask him then.” He shakes his head again. “I’m sorry, but I’ve got to go.”
John reached up and began stroking the hair back from Sherlock’s forehead. He felt Sherlock melt a little against him.
“Before what?” Sherlock asks, his mouth dry as a bone.
John shut his eyes.
“J-John, I need…”
Sherlock didn’t loosen his grip, he stayed curled around John like a weed, his breath starting to even out against John’s neck, and at the feel of Sherlock’s heartbeat solid and real against his chest, John felt relief move through him, as cool and sweet as water to a man dying of thirst.
There’s a strange fluttering sensation in his stomach that is half exhilaration, half dread; and he suddenly realizes just how much assisting Molly has helped keep his mind off the unnamable terror that he has been suppressing since the previous evening, the fear that something will prevent him and John from getting to that glittering expanse of sand.
Sherlock’s heart turns over in his chest.
All this time they have been in one another’s company, it’s been like a spell, a dream, some completely different reality—the spark between them—the light—like nothing Sherlock has ever experienced, but he knows things are different at sea. The same rules don’t apply, and he cannot take the risk of
And he does.
The feel of it makes Sherlock remember vividly how John performed the same sort of licking gesture on another part of him the previous evening.
did for this scene. It is seriously one of the greatest pieces of fanart ever created (in my humble opinion). :)
He buries his face in John’s shoulder, gasping, savoring the feeling of John’s arms so strong and solid around him. He can feel his own heartbeat pounding through him, and after a moment he realizes he can feel John’s as well—only slightly slower than his own, kicking steadily against his breastbone.
“A desperate little bottom?” There was a smirk on Sherlock’s lips but his eyes were blazing. “Have I ever asked you for something I wasn’t sure about? Now, stop talking and
Sherlock holds himself very still, heart pounding hard against his ribs. He is frightened in spite of himself, remembering with a sudden lurch of unpleasantness just how thin the walls really are, how flimsy a barrier they provide between him and John, and the hostile world of the surrounding ship.
“No, but Sherlock, listen—”
“Aye, sir.”
“Sherlock, listen to me. How did they give it you? Was it an injection?”
Sherlock’s eyes snap open. He sucks in a sharp, delighted breath, and then lowers his head to take John’s cock back between his lips. This time he does not relent. He strokes his tongue along the underside as he slides, hollowing his cheeks to create suction like John did for him. He lets the hand that’s holding the base of John’s cock stroke as much of it as he can reach, two long fingers slipping down to find John’s testicles again and tease them lightly. Sherlock hums in pleasure at the feel of them and feels John’s hips give another involuntary jerk.
Sherlock made a sound like a sob.
John breaks the kiss to look at him—but they cannot see each other through the dark. Sherlock can feel the unsteady rush of John’s breath against his face, feels his bandaged hands move up to cup the back of Sherlock’s neck.
And then a horrifying thought occurs to Sherlock, comes creeping toward him through the darkness like some pale, unwanted, nocturnal creature—what if the reason John hasn’t written back by now is because he’s decided Sherlock isn’t worth the trouble? Or worse still, what if he never considered Sherlock worth the trouble at all?
His voice is strong and clear, the melody sweet but full of sorrow. The only accompaniment to his lovely, resonant voice is the time he keeps with his foot.
more than that.
Sherlock had chosen to stay onboard the ship largely because he did not wish to be in the company of the other passengers for any duration that the various activities required, but looking back now, he realizes that some part of his decision was also motivated by the fact that he did not want to miss any opportunity to spend observing the actions of the blue-eyed sailor.
Sherlock listens to the words of the old sailor singing, and feels all the more perplexed.
“It is,” John says before draining the contents of the cup and leaning backwards to reach the bottle off of Sherlock’s desk, somehow managing to do all this without moving his hand from Sherlock’s leg. “Styles got it off a French ship. I told you—he assured me it was the very best.”
John awoke the next morning with a sharp pain in his neck, slumped over in the chair beside Sherlock’s bed. He rubbed at his shoulder. That had clearly been a mistake.
He didn’t know where he was going. He hadn’t even taken his jacket. He was so upset he couldn’t think. He felt like the world was coming apart before his eyes.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No, no, I want to go. I do. I’m just… nervous.”
If that was true then that couldn’t have been the captain’s motivation for poisoning Knott…
“You can repay me by staying alive—yeah?”
“Wave hello then,” Sherlock drawled, unconcerned, and then dropped his head to take John’s cock into his mouth.
Sherlock presses his forehead harder against his knees, a wall coming down in his mind.
“Did she see him?”
It’s only as he turns to go that he sees John, previously hidden from view behind the bulk of a cannon. He is lying in the narrow space between the cannon and the foredeck rail, stretched out, with his eyes closed, arms pillowed underneath his head.
Several voices murmur their assent, and Sherlock can feel that the awkwardness incited by his remark has dissipated thanks to the Colonel’s cheery response.
Instead, he levered himself up off the floor and made his way to the bathroom. He was still filthy from their chase through the alleyway; his hands covered in dried traces of Sherlock’s blood. He would take a shower and he would wash away the memories of the whole encounter—Sherlock’s blood welling up between his hands, Sherlock’s arms around his neck, Sherlock’s mouth sweet and warm beneath his.
Indeed, she looks so pleased by the activity that Sherlock doesn’t have the heart to dismiss her at the dance’s conclusion. They’re halfway through the next dance (it is a quadrille), when Sherlock feels a tap on his shoulder.
But worse than that, worse than the hurt in Sherlock’s eyes was the expression of disgust as he was shoved forward and forced to his knees.
Back and forth he paces the length of his narrow room, back and forth.
“Is it—is it all right?”
“John—!” he rasped, reaching down to clutch John by the shoulders. “Enough—enough of that, I need you to—”
He wrenched his arm out of Sherlock’s grasp with such a violent motion that he sent Sherlock staggering backwards into the coffee table.
“Don’t you want to look your best for all the young ladies?”
Sherlock lets out a long breath, dropping his hands into his lap.
Playing with John is much like the way Sherlock feels about John in his life, he lets John’s voice take the lead and serve as his inspiration, his voice providing the structure that Sherlock works around, Sherlock’s playing echoing the melody but offering its own take on the sequence of notes.
John pressed another kiss to Sherlock’s hair. “It’s all right. I’ve got you. You can let it out now.”
John nods, and Sherlock feels his fingers trace another delicate line up the inside of his arm. He shivers in response.
He cannot meet John’s eyes.
John grins at him then—confident and beaming with pride, and Sherlock cannot help but smile back.
“Don’t you worry,” Burns says, clapping Sherlock on the shoulder with formidable strength. “John is as strong a swimmer as ever I saw. He’ll be alright.”
He casts around again in some desperation to change the subject. “You were right though to suspect that I wanted to ask you about the night of the party. Have you…” He knows the question is presumptuous but he’s too curious to stop himself from asking. “Have you had a chance to speak with Lieutenant Lestrade since then?”
“You asked me yesterday, or I should say, the implications of your words led me to believe that you were asking me whether I touched myself… thinking of you.”
Cursing, John sits up on his elbows.
Later, he’ll tell John later.
“I hope that lot wasn’t giving you any trouble.” John gestures with a jerk of his head to the other end of the bar.
As Sherlock struggles to think what to say, John’s eyes flicker back up to Sherlock’s and he laughs suddenly, self-conscious, sad. The sound of it is like a knife through Sherlock.
“WHO MAKES POISONED PIE AND LEAVES IT LYING AROUND? YOU’VE NEVER EVEN COOKED ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE.”
“Jesus, Sherlock.”
John didn’t let him finish. He couldn’t help himself. He pressed his mouth to the trembling line of Sherlock’s and tried to convey all of his yearning, all of his tenderness, in the touch of his lips.
“No, thank you, Lieutenant. I’m sure Holmes and Watson can see themselves back. Tell Deverall I’ll meet him in the wardroom shortly. I shouldn’t be long.”
“But now I get to fuck you here… on silk sheets, where you deserve to be fucked. Do you want that, too, John? Do you want to feel me inside you, on top of you, all around you, fucking you into the sheets? Is that you want?”
Sherlock wants to be good, he wants to lie still and appreciate this new, gentle, sleepy John, whose hard lines have all gone soft as molten fire, whose hand is stroking lazily up and down the line of Sherlock’s back, drawing shivers out of him; but his own cock is hard and aching again, his pulse pounding insistent along the length of it and Sherlock cannot help but squirm a bit against John’s side.
boat, you will simply take a seat on the next boat that is headed to shore. There is plenty of room for everyone, but you will have to be patient. Lieutenant Dimmock will be sure that you get a place on the next boat, won’t you, Lieutenant?”
Ok, and now without further ado, onto the chapter!
“Right then. See you in a bit.”
“No.”
His arms are still around Sherlock, loose but protective, and even in slumber, the muscles in his arms and shoulders are sharply defined, the downy hair covering his forearms bright gold from so many hours spent in the sun.
He watches Billy make his way to the front of the ship and descend through the hatch into the forecastle, and then turns his attention, finally, to the sailors gathered beneath the foremast.
John also produces a piece of hard yellow cheese that they eat in thin slivers with their torn off hunks of bread. It’s wonderfully salty with a pleasant nutty flavor.
John turns to glance over his shoulder, letting go of Sherlock’s shoulders as he does. He turns back to look at Sherlock but Sherlock cannot see his face through the darkness.
Sherlock manages to shut his gaping mouth but that’s about the best he can do with John’s cool hands still resting on his forearms, his warm blue gaze so focused on Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock flushes scarlet from the roots of his hair down to the tips of his toes.
Sherlock’s own trunk is standing beside his cabin door. He walks past it without interest—there is little inside of it to give him cause for excitement.
“I told him the truth. Eventually. He had no idea it was Molly, and he’d noticed Marcus’s…. attentions towards Lestrade. He was concerned that Marcus had feelings for the Lieutenant that he could not return, not being inclined romantically towards members of his own sex.”
Sherlock kissed John’s trembling mouth, and then added a second finger.
Sherlock makes a stuttering sound of pleasure at that first long stroke, his open mouth pressed hot and desperate against John’s.
Besides, no matter how much he wants to deny it, he cannot ignore the fact that he longs to catch another glimpse of John up in the rigging, or doing anything really, so long as Sherlock can see just one of his brilliant smiles, the reassuring white flash of his teeth.
He may well be asleep, but Sherlock thinks the possibility unlikely. He is not the type to retire early.
When he finally looked up he found Sherlock watching him.
Sherlock is pulled out of his ruminations by Colonel Jackson’s silence. He must have asked Sherlock a question because he is looking at Sherlock expectantly now. Sherlock is about to ask him to repeat it when he’s saved from having to reply by a sound that causes both him and the Colonel to freeze where they’re standing and look up.
John began to slide his fingers gently in and out.
He heard the sound of the water shutting off, the click of the bathroom light, and then Sherlock was crossing the room toward him, a lean shadow moving silently over the lush carpet, pausing by the table where John had left the full glass of champagne.
“When you sent me…”
Sherlock is stricken silent, awed by the fact that John is thanking him for precisely what he’d hoped to do; he almost can’t believe what John is saying.
The Colonel himself has not yet made his appearance at the breakfast table; judging by the amount of private spirits that he doled out last night, Sherlock isn’t surprised by this fact. The man must be sleeping it off in his room.
His cousins were always convinced he cheated. Once they got so angry they dragged him out back and tied him to a birch tree. They snapped off the branches to make switches and struck him on his arms, on his stomach, until he told them how he cheated. He got so angry his face turned bright red, but he refused to lie so they kept on beating him until he was covered all over with welts, his swollen cheeks streaming with angry tears.
John could feel his heart hammering against his breastbone. He shifted Sherlock on his lap, hoping the bulge of his erection wasn’t becoming invasive.
There is some appreciative nudging and tittering as the song begins, which makes Sherlock think it must be a song John has sung before.
Sherlock looked down at him in alarm and John saw that his cheeks and the bloody column of his throat were smeared with soot.
“We up and tumbled all night long, oh!”
“What did you say?” Sherlock whispered, all traces of humor gone from his face—his expression utterly vulnerable; laid bare.
was playing that instrument now could only mean one thing—someone must have brought it onto the ship in one of the first boats that had arrived from shore, laden down with curious people from the port city, eager to meet the people onboard and sell them goods.
Sherlock shifts forward, eager, determined. “Let me,” he says, carefully lifting John’s fingers off himself to replace them fully with his own. “Let me do it, John.”
“I waltzed up to the Angel Inn, oh.”
He lifted his head off Sherlock’s neck, wriggling slightly backward to break the circle of Sherlock’s arms so he could reach down between them and take Sherlock in his hand.
Sherlock had acquired the last piece of evidence they needed to make LaRoue’s arrest. Their target would be attending a production of Giuseppe Verdi’s
“I never would have gone along with it! It was all Sherlock’s idea, you’ve got to forgive me.”
It is only a matter of seconds before sweat is beading on his temples, his brow, trickling down the back of his neck, and Sherlock is more grateful than ever for Miss Hooper’s practical gift to him.
The flood of new activity means there is precious little space to stand in that isn’t in someone’s way—Sherlock has to leap aside twice within the space of a minute—first to avoid being run down by a sailor carrying an armful of heavy cable, and then to narrowly dodge a beheading from a boom being swung over the deck.
“Something I always meant to do when you were alive. I’m not going to miss the opportunity again.”
“He’s tried to leave twice—once after each injury, but the truth is, this life is all he knows, and he knows no other trade so he just kept coming back. He smokes a great deal, never touches liquor, and can play the mouth organ with quite a bit of skill.”
thing to do), is wait until the ship makes port in Rio to see if any items listed on the manifest get taken off the ship. The tradable goods are destined for the markets in the East—their stop in Rio is simply a matter of restocking necessary supplies for the passengers and the crew. But if the captain were being light-fingered with the goods, Rio would be the place to do his selling, rather than Madras.
He found he was panting just as hard as Sherlock now. His cock was so hard it was aching, leaving a trail of pre-come where it was stretched taut against his stomach.
And Sherlock cannot have that.
Miss Hooper blinks up at him in mild surprise. “G-good afternoon, Mr. Holmes.”
His eyes are wide open, studying every detail of John’s face up-close, the golden blur of his eyelashes, the slope of his nose, his heart racing as the reality of the situation makes itself known.
The reassurance in John’s voice is too sincere to be faked; tentatively, Sherlock opens his eyes.
He’s starting to understand now why John would have taken a liking to Sally. She’s strong like he is—has lived through fire and darkness and come out the other side fighting. He saw a glimpse of it himself back at the tavern, that spark in her eyes as she’d looked him over, reminded John that she could take care of herself.
He hears the gentle intake of John’s breath as he laces their fingers together, the intensity of the contact shocking even through the bandage on John’s palm, and Sherlock feels something in his chest catch fire.
At Sherlock’s look of confusion, John goes on to clarify.
He sits up on his haunches and leans into Sherlock, sliding a hand around the back of his neck to bring their faces close together.
to be jealous about? Especially when it comes to Sally. He’ll never be strong like that. Not for the first time, he finds himself wondering what on earth John sees in him.
John’s eyelids flutter at the touch of Sherlock’s fingers but do not close. Something dark moves through his gaze like a shifting storm cloud.
“I’m not sure yet, but it’s going to be something big.”
Sherlock walks out to him, even though it hurts to leave the cool darkness of the house, it hurts to see the sun bright on John's face, the wrinkles in the corners of his eyes as he looks up at Sherlock, the grooves of pain around his mouth deepening.
“This is the end. From now on, I’ll stay away.”
Sherlock’s question about John’s whereabouts withers on his tongue.
“I’m Lieutenant Lestrade by the way.” Sherlock looks up, his gaze sharpening. Lestrade. A French name. But the man’s accent is clearly English. Curious. “If you ever need anything, well…” The officer inclines his head. “I’m at your disposal.”
No, he cannot bear it.
Sherlock’s face is pressed in against John’s neck—he can feel the hot rhythm of John’s pulse against his cheek, but he cannot see his face. He pulls back a little to see John’s expression.
What will John do when he finds out? Will he be able to stop himself from beating Stevens to a bloody pulp, as Sherlock knows he will want to do, as soon as he learns what happened?
“It isn’t that I can’t do it myself—I just… I want you to do it.”
to do with the captain’s desperation to reach the port in Rio in good time. I’m certain of it, John.”
Sherlock’s head is already swimming from the delicate movement of John’s thumb up his thigh, from the intent look in John’s dark blue eyes, his whole body tingling with arousal, but he takes the cup, long fingers brushing over John’s as he does.
“What happened then?”
Sherlock closes his eyes to try and hold onto the feeling.
When they emerged through the doorway to the outside, the cold air that rushed them felt wonderful on John’s flushed face. He drank in several deep breaths to cool his burning lungs.
“Like that—just like that. Keep—just keep doing what you’re doing.”
As Sherlock draws nearer, he realizes these are the woods that edge the Holmes estate, the woods where he spent the majority of his childhood, wandering through the dense underbrush with Redbeard at his side.
He hears John swear above him and then feels his weight shift as John falls hard into the wall at his back.
Sensing this, Sherlock comes forward and takes hold of John by his upper arms. His grip is firm but gentle, blue eyes softening as he looks into John’s. “John, listen to me. It’s my fault you’re here at all. You wouldn’t be in danger if it weren’t for me. I won’t let you die on my account. Do you understand?”
“John!” Sherlock seized John by his upper arms. “Stop.”
Lestrade stared at Sherlock in disbelief. “No point? Then what the hell was all this about? Why the bloody hell did the two of you come out here in the first place if not to catch Moriar—”
John glances over at the enormous bed. The corner of his mouth quirks up.
One song ends and another begins and Sherlock barely has time to take off his jacket and roll his shirtsleeves up before they’re racing off again—this tune, much faster, bolder—the rhythm infectious, moving like quicksilver through Sherlock’s veins.
Sherlock is going to tell him it isn’t necessary, but John has already slipped through the crowd and is making his way over to the place where the three musicians sit.
Lestrade drops the sheaf of papers in his hand with a loud string of curses.
“How could you possibly know any of that?” the other man snarls.
Sherlock turned back to John. “Can you walk?”
John stroked his hair, pressed his lips again to Sherlock’s forehead. He curled his body around Sherlock’s as though to offer him a physical shield against his sorrow.
Sherlock nods, speechless, still shocked that another human would not only take an interest in him, but show him kindness.
It seems that the officers have been given a bit of a break as well because Sherlock spies Lieutenants Moore and Dimmock drinking together by the main mast, their jackets off and their shirt-sleeves rolled up, seemingly trying their best to ignore the loud and pointed giggling issuing from the two young ladies standing across from them, their heads tucked behind their fans.
Sherlock pulled away from him. “No. John!”
Sherlock waits; listening, his own breathing fast and shallow, his arms slung low around John’s waist.
He saw Sherlock visibly relax, and then lift his eyebrows at John with a look that was clearly intended to communicate the sentiment, ‘If you think I’m leaving your side for one minute, then you are far stupider than I’ve ever given you credit for.’
Sherlock has to stop himself from physically grabbing ahold of Billy and asking him every detail about how John looked, how he sounded, what he’s seen John doing in the last twelve hours, but he restrains himself; manages a tight-lipped nod of thanks.
The lanterns suspended overhead cast everything in their swinging golden light, the wreaths of the pipe smoke coiling in and around the bodies of the men like friendly ghosts. The slide of the lights over their faces, the sinuous movement of the tendrils of smoke, gives the scene the shifting other-worldly quality of an underwater grotto, puts Sherlock in mind of the dream he had when he was ill, of the drowned sailors congregating at the bottom of the sea.
“It wasn’t Lestrade the captain meant to poison—it was another passenger, John Knott. He’s a clerk at the law firm where Ferguson works. One of the partners died suddenly before Ferguson came to work there—the rumor was that he was poisoned. Ferguson filled his vacancy.”
The cup vanished momentarily behind the pillow. John heard Sherlock give a sigh of pleasure.
Sherlock recognizes the slight form of Billy, whose ruddy smiling face is turned up toward his with good humor.
“I said I don’t see what the problem—”
At this realization a pang goes through Sherlock.
A tiny bubble of hope has risen up within him. It could be John—John could be one of the sailors coming to take the trunks back down.
Now it’s Sherlock’s turn to feel the heat rising in his cheeks.
However, before he can lift his head to speak, sleep has crept in to pull him down to darkness, sponging the words from his lips for the second time that night.
But Lestrade, much to Sherlock’s amazement, continues standing in the captain’s way. He steps closer to the other man, lowering his voice, the urgency on his face plain.
Sherlock has never been so sore in his life. Pulling his coat on over his shoulders makes him hiss in pain.
“Yes?” John asks, one corner of his mouth quirking up in a smile.
Sherlock sucks a breath in and feels something begin to uncoil deep within him.
“Those two weeks when you were away, I… let myself examine how deep it went—my desire for you—as an experiment, just to see. It was…” Sherlock shut his eyes and John watched the slender line reappear between his eyebrows. “Intolerable.”
As the figure playing the guitar finally comes into view, Sherlock stops dead in his tracks.
Lestrade threw his hands up in exasperation. “Oh, well in that case—”
It’s well after midnight by the time Sherlock is satisfied that Molly has learned all he can teach her; and now, all that’s left to do, is wait.
“Ahh Johnny, you know I’m good for it.”
Sherlock tipped his head back, exposing the long pale expanse of his neck. His lips were parted, his expression far away as he gazed up at John through lowered lashes. John licked his lips, struggling to tear his gaze from the shadowed groove at the base of Sherlock’s throat, which he was dying to lick.
He is holding it so tightly in his hands that he is frightened he will tear it, that the pressure from his palms will make the ink run and dissolve the message. He forces himself to ease his grip, smoothing the paper flat against his thigh.
All at once Sherlock is nervous, the dreamy heaviness of his mood evaporating in the space of a heartbeat, transforming to a torrent of nameless anxiety.

He has no desire to cross paths with the captain under any circumstances, and certainly not when he is in one of his moods, as he clearly is today. But there is no sign of John up in the rigging, and it’s too hot to venture back below decks.
Sherlock’s eyes were lowered to half-mast—clearly so overcome that it was an effort for him to keep them open but resolutely holding John’s gaze, looking up at John through his eyelashes as his tongue stroked the head of his cock.
When he wakes, shaking, shirt drenched in sweat, sheets twisted in a vice around his torso, he knows it isn’t real. Just a nightmare; and for a moment he experiences a surge of relief. It couldn’t be real because he wouldn’t still be here if it were true, because there is no world for John without Sherlock.
“Better?”
Sherlock’s admonishment sounded more like a plea.
Sherlock stares at John, his mouth agape. John is speaking the very feelings that Sherlock feels every day. John—glorious, beautiful, confident
“Sherlock, look at me.”
“We’ll have to go slowly. It’s a been while since I… well.” That flash of a smile again, bright as sunlight. Sherlock aches at the sight of it. “And you’ll have to help me since I cannot use my hands—”
Sherlock stands with a sudden determined movement and makes his way over to his desk.
“I’m sorry to wake you. I’m off duty for the moment and won’t be able to get away later. I thought I’d better check in on you when I could.”
But he can tell from one glance at both of them—could tell even before he opened the door—that they have no interest in being there. It’s obvious that Anderson, desperate to enact some kind of revenge upon Sherlock for getting him demoted, has been hounding them all night in an attempt to catch him and John in the act.
“You’re not dreaming, my love.”
He kept his eyes shut, head tipped back against the wall behind him, let wave after wave of rage wash over him.
The water is not heated of course, which makes the process much quicker. John offers to make a fire and heat the water properly, but Sherlock dismisses the idea. In the heat of the tropical afternoon, the cool fresh water will feel just as exquisite as a warm bath would on a chilly day in England.
His foot had been caught in a hunting snare. The teeth of the vicious trap were sunk deep into his hind leg. Sherlock tried to get him out but his efforts were useless, fingers slipping in the blood, his own two hands of flesh and bone powerless against the metal jaws of the trap.
John cries out above him, hips jerking forward as another wave of pleasure overtakes him, fluid gushing from the swollen head of his cock. Sherlock laps at it, like a cat, running a tongue around his tingling lips before taking John fully back into his mouth and sucking lightly. He looks up at John as he does and John curses softly, moaning, as his cock gives one last spasm, and more bitter liquid surges into Sherlock’s mouth.
Now that they’re out in the open air, he’s inundated all over again with the lush green scent of this place—so wild and alive, so unlike any place Sherlock has ever been before. He draws a deep breath of it into his lungs, grateful to be free from the close confines of the tavern. The air is laced with strange, tropical smells. Breathing it in, feeling the sunlight full on his face, the reality of their situation hits him with renewed force.
“The winds have changed. We’ve lost the head wind that was giving us such an advantage. From what I overheard, we’re no longer making the speed the captain wants to get us to port on time.”
This surprises him. He knows it's rare to dream during such heavily sedated sleep, his body thrumming with drugs, with fluids, with the IV that is keeping his heart running.
He should be able to survive four days without seeing John Watson. After all, he’s lived nearly eighteen years of his life without any of this and somehow he’s managed just fine. He should be able to do it now with no trouble.
John had never seen a room as elegant as the one Sherlock had requested, much less
It’s several minutes before they both recover enough to remember John’s suggestion—swimming yes, that was it—and several minutes more before they manage to think about moving. Their progress is significantly slowed by John sliding down the doorframe to pull a boneless Sherlock into his arms and kissing him thoroughly—deep and slow and open-mouthed—until Sherlock is sighing and melting in against him, and they’ve both forgotten all over again that they ever had any intention of doing anything besides kissing naked in the doorway of this sea-side hut.
Now it was John’s turn to drop his head back exposing the length of his neck, stomach muscles tightening, his calf clenching over Sherlock’s hip as the first low ripples of his orgasm began to spread outward from his abdomen.
It’s not because he’s afraid of seeing Anderson again—no, it isn’t that at all, he tells himself firmly, and only half-believes it—it’s because he feels too tense and jittery, too hot, too full of feeling after those brief moments on the deck with John.
Sherlock realizes then, with a sudden cold, draining feeling that he is saying farewell.
He knows now he is no longer dreaming.
“Also, easy. See the tattoos on his arm? There are two—one with two dates and a pair of initials—that’s for his wife, year of birth and death. The other is a pair of initials and just one date, eighteen years ago—that’s the year his son was born. And the tattoo on his neck? That’s a Chinese character. That’s how I know he worked the Eastern trade routes to China and back. No Englishman would know how to make a symbol like that.”
He was aware that he was making a steady stream now of pleading sounds, increasing in intensity with every roll of his hips against Sherlock’s. He could feel his own pleasure rising in him; any moment now it was going to brim over and he would be carried away.
. He doesn’t know anything about your capacity to love because he doesn’t have the ability himself. He can’t see it because he doesn’t know what it looks like.”
But then John’s fingers are tightening in his hair with purpose, suddenly desperate, trying to pull him off.
John moaned into the kiss, let Sherlock stroke the inside of his mouth hungrily as his hand began to move on John’s cock, mimicking John’s movements from earlier but with a slight variation that was suited precisely to John’s tastes.
Sherlock’s voice is stiff with pain. “I didn’t run away.”
He pictures himself digging a hole in the earth and tossing each image in.
John was moaning continuously now, savoring the sound of Sherlock’s gasps as he bucked against him, fucking his fist against Sherlock’s stomach, the fingers of his left hand holding Sherlock’s shoulder hard enough to bruise.
It’s so completely unprecedented he wants to demand the real reason behind Lestrade’s decision, especially after what he heard the captain say about him and John. How can he just say yes and trust that this is real?
He feels John smile against him before licking a stripe up to the base of his ear.
John watches from the doorway as Sherlock drops to his knees and crawls forward to pull his instrument free from where it’s strapped beneath his bed. One shoulder propped against the doorframe, arms crossed over his chest, he is the picture of casual nonchalance, but Sherlock is observant; Sherlock knows otherwise.
Sherlock tightened his arms around John’s shoulders, hiding his face.
But Ferguson doesn’t let go. He clings to Sherlock’s arm, the hysteria in his voice increasing.
His hands find Sherlock’s arms, close around them, and he is pulling Sherlock to him with a terrible strength, using his body to communicate what his voice cannot.
He was following Sherlock through the corridors of the ship, trying to keep up as Sherlock ran ahead of him. The fire was all around them—the air so thick and hot it was difficult to breathe.
“Don’t be tedious, Doctor. You’re doing beautifully so far. What on earth could you hope to achieve by resisting now?”
“Mmm?”
Mercifully, he does not remember them after he wakes, each terrible scene transforming into the next before he can grab hold of it and try and think of how to stop it from happening.
But when he glances up at John again, he realizes that John is quiet because he’s thinking. When he finally speaks, his eyes are full of steel.
He thinks about John in bed beside him, John lifting his strong body up over Sherlock’s, holding himself up by his arms, the weight of his groin coming to rest heavy and welcome between Sherlock’s legs, the feel of the length of John against him—blood-hot and hard as steel. He thinks about John, grinning down at Sherlock, eyes glittering in the low light, both soft and bright at once, and how easy it would be for Sherlock to push up with his own hips, push back against John and feel the sweet slide of their erections coming together, how John would moan above him—the sound as low as sin—as he pushed back against Sherlock; how the muscles in John’s arms would stand out as he lowered himself down against Sherlock, asking in a rush of heat against the side of Sherlock’s neck, voice trembling slightly, “How is this? Is it good? Tell me how good it feels, my love.”
He begins to bob his head in a steady rhythm, sliding his mouth up and down, creating the perfect amount of slick wet friction. Finally, finally, it’s just the right amount of speed, of pressure.
“The poor man.” He shakes his head. “God, I wish I could thank him.”
The other man turns to look at Sherlock and Sherlock feels panic rise in him at the cold, disinterested expression on his face. His eyes flicker up and down Sherlock briefly, as if trying to ascertain the reason for Sherlock’s sudden attempt to engage him in conversation.
Sherlock has seen John climb the rigging before but never with both his hands occupied. How he can navigate the tangle of ropes and sails and cables with both hands full is a mystery to Sherlock.
John leans back, taking hold of her hands between his own.
“You’re a creature of magic,” John murmurs, looking up at him with lights in his eyes. “It’s the only plausible explanation.”
He kisses Sherlock hard, the stubble on his jaw scraping Sherlock’s cheek, his arms circling Sherlock’s waist. The kiss goes on for so long that Sherlock forgets to breathe—he clutches at John’s shoulders, dizzy with relief, unsteady, grateful for an anchor.
