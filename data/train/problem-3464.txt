"I am done with you." Dean angrily yelled. "I'm done. I don't care any more."
"But... how?" Sam sat down. "You exploded."
Cas didn't hesitate this time. Not knowing what else to do, he scooped the lighter from the floor, and in less than a fraction of a second he was across the room, dropping the lighter into the basket as he sunk to the floor, the sheer act of this minor use of grace painful. Apparently, even teleporting was a huge drain. He forced himself to look back to the bookshelf, where he could see the spirit go up in flames, and Dean fall back against shelves, breathing heavily.
"We fix what rips, and buy the same stuff again when it's too far gone." He told him, watching carefully as Cas paused at a plan blue shirt that was a shade very close to Cas's own eyes. He shook away the thought, taking it out of the rail and making Cas face the mirror again, holding it up for inspection.
CW: Masturbation.
"About you drinking? Every night? All the damn time?" Sam shrugged. "When was the last time you woke up not hungover?"
“Yeah, I remember.”
"Why?"
with the task, but Charlie saying she thought it was set up was good enough for him. They switched it on, watching with baited breath as lights blinked on the map, colour coded.
Fuck.
Not so long after, back at the car, Cas gratefully having finished anxiously pacing, they got Charlie on the phone to discuss it all through.
"Nice moves, Cowboy;" She joked. "Where'd you pick them up?"
He didn't say anything, choosing instead to slap the red metal hard with his hand.
“Don’t read them.” He warned, and he heard her hesitate.
Cas, of course, didn't notice any of this. He had never really been that in tune with the nuances and prejudices of Earth, and since his return, he didn't seem any different.
"She was the one chosen." Livvie told him forcefully. "Trust me; of all the angels I wanted to hurt, she was at the bottom of my list."
Cas grabbed Dean behind the knees, hoisting him forwards, and Dean yelped as he fell back against the sheets. Cas quickly undid Dean’s fly, pulling the remainder of his clothes off in one sweep, and then Dean was naked too. Cas leaned forwards, pressing himself against Dean, and this was a whole different ball game, the feel of hot skin against his own, the press of Cas’s erection against his own had them both gasping into each other’s mouths, kissing and touching and grinding, their bodies instincts taking over and chasing pleasure. But the movement started getting urgent, and Dean pulled back when he felt the tension in his belly rise closer to the point of no return, panting Cas’s name against his neck.
Dean froze, hand on the banister. Cas was still, very still, lying flat on his back, as if he had learnt to sleep from a textbook. Dean felt the chain slide from his hand slightly as his chest tightened, throat closing up slightly. He felt panic slowly work its way up as he stared.
He shook his head. “What would Jimmy think of tonight?”
He pulled away, taking a few steps back, and Dean coughed, getting air back into his lungs. He glared at his brother, pride wounded at being so easily overpowered, which Sam ignored.
He was back for Dean. And apparently he was here to stay.
It didn’t go well. Sam had to actually duck out of the way. And Cas almost threw up afterwards, sitting on a log for a few minutes before feeling strong enough to get back up. Dean felt bad about that one.
“Ice cream!” Dean laughs.
“Everyone wants something. Does it feel like something is missing in your life?” Dean doesn’t like where this is going. That’s another thing about Cas. He always seems to figure Dean out before Dean figures himself out.
“What about hunting?” Cas asks, sitting on the other end of the couch. This gives Dean food for thought. He takes a second before answering.
“Right…” When Dean doesn’t offer further explanation, he continues. “Eileen and I found a case. Couple vamps in Oklahoma, shouldn’t take long.” Dean nods.
“The dog?” Cas asks.
“But we can discuss that later.” Billie said, in a commanding tone, “first, let’s talk business.” She approached Amara and Jack. “I assume you haven’t had time to explain any of this to them?” She asked.
”Huh. That’s weird.” He tries not to let on how much the mention of Cas is affecting him. He’s opening the can of Spaghetti-Os, pouring it into a bowl for Jack. He throws it in the microwave, punching the two minute timer.
Cas scratches behind Miracle’s ears, which he really enjoys.
“Hmmm. I dunno, I think I kind of always knew, in a way, without knowing. Does that make sense?” Dean wishes he could say no. He only nods in response. At least he
. Then he feels it. Dean’s stomach drops at the realization. Cas has wrapped his arms around Dean again, securing him in a warm hug. For a split second, Dean ponders staying that way. Then, common sense kicks in, wrecking any possible peace Dean had with the idea. He launches himself out of bed.
“Yeah. Cas thinks it’s teeth marks. I think it’s been scratched up by a squirrel or a raccoon. Sam’s money is on some sort of bug, but Cas is convinced it’s a rogue rabbit.” Dean furrows his brows.
“I suppose Jack’s finding it hard to adjust. He is a half-angel child after all.” Cas suggests, staring at the sky, which is starting to lighten a bit at the horizon. As Dean sits back upright, the wooden board under him creaks.
ends up with that damn card. Every time.
I might be… bisexual.” He finds he can’t meet Charlie’s eyes.
“Sure.” Dean replies. Charlie sets down her glass.
“Well I think it’s best to respect everyone’s opinions. Even if they’re wrong.”
“Uh… hey.”
“What?” Jack asks.
“No. I’m here on business, with you actually.” Billie replies.
“Good idea, Jack! Why don’t you sing Blackbird, Dean?” Dean sends Cas a glare, before reluctantly grabbing his guitar from the corner of Jack’s room. It’s impossible to say no to the kid, Dean’s tried before. No dice. He tries not to focus on Cas’s eyes, as they burn into Dean. He sits at the foot of Jack’s bed, plucking the strings. He almost wishes he’d never picked up the guitar from the garage sale in the next town over, but it was the only instrument Dean ever learned, and it was a beautiful cream-colored acoustic. He remembers sitting on the couch at Sonny’s boy home. He plucked the strings on that guitar, knowing it wouldn’t matter anyway. Sam was still in middle school, and John would only take him away two months later. But Dean found he actually enjoyed playing the guitar, and would spend a lot of his free time on that couch, exploring different sounds. In those two months, he learned two songs, and one of them was blackbird. The other was smoke on the water by Deep Purple. Neither were exactly his favorite songs, but Dean was just happy that he got to learn anything outside of hunting, even if he didn’t admit it. It was short-lived, but now Dean can play that song every night for Jack. Even if Cas is standing there watching him sing, too.
It takes an hour and a half to talk Jack into trying his vegetable pizza. Dean’s glad Cas was there, and vice versa, because Dean knows either of them would have lost it or given up if the other wasn’t there to cut in. Toddlers are hard. Dean crashes onto his bed, and doesn’t even bother to crawl under the covers. He barely had enough energy to take a shower and wash the dirt all off of him. He whips up when he feels weight sinking on the other side. It’s Cas. Dean rolls his eyes, far too tired to even try to argue with him tonight. He offers Cas another pillow and he takes it, though he just sits, reading a book.
“Jesus, Cas. Just sleep up here.” Dean says, patting the pillow next to him.
“Right… so you’re… straight?” She asks him. Dean knows she’s not asking out of her own curiosity, but to help talk Dean through it. Usually, Dean wouldn’t burden her with it, but Dean figures maybe this is the one time he should be selfish. He sighs, sitting back up on the bed.
“Hello, Dean.” Dean felt the anger rising in his chest, pure rage. He turned around to face her.
“She showed you her game?” Dean asks.
“Oh yeah, I think I vaguely remember hearing about that.” He shrugs. “Sounds fun. Maybe Jack will get to see a monarch butterfly!” Jack grins.
“Good morning, Charlie. How are you?” She smiles.
“Orange sherbet is my new favorite flavor.” Dean smiles to himself.
“I’m not gonna get sick. Even when my grace drains down to my wings, I’ll be perfectly fine. As long as I take it slow and don’t use too much at one time.” Cas says.
“Ahh.” Cas nods.
“What happened?” He asks. Dean sighs.
“Good.” Amara placed her hands on Jack’s head, just like he did with Chuck, and drained him of Chuck’s powers. Jack turned to face Sam and Dean.
“Because it’s different.” Jack seems to be having a hard time grasping the concept.
. Dean whips back around, running back to the abandoned bench. He hears it again. “
“Good morning, Cas,” Dean booms, “did you sleep well?” Cas squints at him,
“So we need a secret code word for when I don’t want you to use your superpowers to keep you safe.” Dean says. He thinks for a moment. “How about ‘Bub’?” He looks at Jack, who nods, though not understanding. “If you ever hear me call you ‘Bub’, that’s the code word to not use your powers.” Jack nods.
“Well I think they’ll be lucky to have your talent with them. Good luck.”
“You…’re... you’re Cas!” Then he went around the room, pointing at each of them. “You..’re... S...Sam!” He waddled up to Dean, who was now crouched next to Cas. Jack points at him. “You’re Dee!”
“You can’t.”
kiss. And what’s worse is that Cas kissed him
“Listen, Jack, this…” he holds out his hands to show him. “Owies? They’re normal, right? And sometimes I get small owies, like my hand. And sometimes, I might get big owies-”
homophobic. Dean feels something… anger? Something twisting inside him. He thinks of how his father would react seeing gay people as out and open as they are nowadays, how he would react knowing Dean supports these people.
“Charlie said she might get a job.” He pauses for a moment. “Hey Dee, are you gonna be busy today?” He asks. Dean’s gut wrenches. Of course he wants to spend time with Jack, but he knows wherever Jack is, Cas is never far behind. He’s surprised Cas isn’t here to watch Jack right now. As if on cue, Dean hears steps coming up from downstairs. His dread quickly subsides when he places the footsteps as Charlie’s. Not Cas. She enters the dining room.
He presses the gas pedal into the floor of Baby, careening down the highway. He needs to get out of here. Do something, anything to get it out. He pulls off some shady road near the woods. He rips the key out of the ignition, throwing his door open. He storms into the woods, and when he’s far enough in, he grabs the first branch he finds on the floor, ramming it against a tree. He cracks it against the tree like a baseball bat until it splits open, wooden splinters shooting out from the spot where it hit the tree. He grabs another branch and does the same. Eventually, he finds tree branches aren’t enough, and turns the trunk of that tree into a punching bag, slamming his fist into it over and over again until his knuckles bleed. And even then, he throws a few more punches until he’s too exhausted to continue.
"Yeah," Cas replied casually. He didn't quite understand why that was relevant right now, but sure, it was that song.
Jo chuckled and shrugged. "Got me. A really smart cookie he is, your daddy," she leaned in and spoke to Claire, who laughed in response.
"Okay," Cas answered quietly.
"No, it's ... I mean it's weird. Kinda. But maybe I just need to get used to it"
I wasn't able to answer, only kept staring at him.
"Oh now that is a first-hand confirmation, ladies and gentlemen," the moderator said, "that Dean Winchester is off the market! Does that mean we can expect an official introduction of the happy couple in the near future?"
"Yeah," Dean said again, now standing right in front of his two colleagues with Cas by his side. "He's Cas. Cas, that's Ed and Harry"
"Mh," Cas made thoughtfully. "No, I think I'm gonna do that later" Not that he wouldn't have enjoyed having Jo explain how amazing Dean was. But he simply didn't know how to act if she'd show him videos right now, he didn't know how to pretend it was his first time seeing Dean.
"Anyways," Dean then said. "Let’s forget about that. So," he changed the topic, "that, what was it, paint accident you mentioned? What was that about?"
"Not gonna lose any time then," Dean chuckled as he dropped his phone over on the coffee table and pulled his shirt over his head. "I'm ready"
"That's fair," the moderator said. "Will there be a certain theme for the new songs, just like your last one went with sort of a western, cowboy vibe?"
Feeling Dean next to him as his alarm rude awakened him, Cas immediately felt a lot better than the previous morning. He just loved waking up next to Dean. He loved feeling his warm body next to him, he loved hearing Dean's little groans and mumbled complaints because his boyfriend was a grumpy mess in the morning, he even loved having Dean's arm in his face from Dean's extensive movements in his sleep. It was annoying, sure. But it also was Dean, and it meant Dean was there.
Without giving it a further thought, Cas watched his thumb hitting the call button, and he listened to the dial tone.
"There's gonna be photos," Cas explained calmly, "of Dean Winchester and me. There has been one already, online, but that wasn't part of the plan and he tried to keep it down because it was accidental and Claire was in it and ... anyway. There's gonna be photos that will look like snapped by chance, and they're gonna make tabloid headlines and some gossip and all that, but they're approved by his PR team. They're staged, to some extent."
"There's, uhm ..." Cas started, "well we've gotten closer than necessary when there was no one to pretend for. When we were literally alone. Happened a couple times. But there's this one thing that ... it really confuses me. It fucks with my head, really"
"Okay," Jo made, now it sounded like she was thinking. "What's your pros and cons? I know you probably made a list"
"In what way would having a one-night stand with him make my feelings easier?"
"Well that's refreshing," Dean smiled. "Was a nice feeling to be just a guy out there with you"
I remembered how I had told him to buy me a drink without thinking about it, and how he had reacted to it. How his reaction had been so different from what I had expected, from how a straight man would have reacted. How he had actually invited me to the bar later, how he had bought me that drink, and many more since then.
And sometimes, Garth said, he'd also just scribble some stuff down on his own and present it to Dean, proposing an idea that they'd then realize together - or not, if none of the others could be convinced.
“It probably will be either way,” I said. “And if you need any help, you can always ask me. I wouldn’t mind showing you the way again”
He now smiled back at me, and we kept that eye contact for a moment. Just two teachers standing there out in the fields behind the school, smiling at each other.
With a deep sigh, I answered. “I’m scared of the consequences,” I explained quietly, with an honest look into his eyes. “I’m scared of what happens when the wrong person finds out that I like the
Is it a competition?
you mean happiness to me
Before I could answer, though, the school bell impolitely interrupted our moment. Dean winked at me – he seriously winked at me - before he threw a single red M&M in his mouth and walked past me with his typical charming grin.
Yes, Cas knew all that. But knowing that didn't change that Dean was so unfairly handsome, so ridiculously attractive to Cas. It didn't change that his freckles had to be pretty much the most adorable thing Cas had ever seen in an attractive man, and that his eyes with their sparkle and their intense green colour immediately caught Cas's attention as soon as he even glanced by them.
While they were walking to the bus stop, Claire was by Cas's hand, excitedly hopping along his steps and trying to find out anything about where they were going, but no matter how hard she tried and how much she asked, he wouldn't tell her.
"Yeah," Cas agreed. And again, they were smiling at each other. This time, Cas didn't try to look away, to break the eye contact or interrupt the moment. This time, it was okay. That was Dean, that was his
"He's also Dean's little brother," she said, "Which explains
"Did you really?" the Angel asked.
"She's gonna be fine," Dean said softly, "God Cas I promise she's gonna be fine"
lately. His music isn’t even good. I really don’t get the hype”
The girl nodded, but she still held onto her father a bit tighter. They said goodbye to the young employee and followed her to the back door that she closed behind them as they stepped out onto an empty alleyway.
Another sigh. "I, uhm ..." he hesitated, "Please don't make fun of me"
“Are those the ones you don’t like?” he asked.
Tonight, both adults focused on Claire once again, letting her babble most of the time and telling them about things she had done with Missouri this past week, things she had learned and how much fun she had had.
“Hear what?”
"Oh we got no fixed times," Dean smiled. "I'm usually here at 9, some of the others start earlier. You don't have to be here before me, though. So, 9 or after is fine."
After what felt like an eternity, the steps moved away from the closet, out of the room. They heard the bedroom door close, and in a quiet but incredibly relieved sigh, Dean let his breath go again.
A short but intense look into Cas's eyes, then Dean leaned down and kissed him. Cas kissed him back, of course he did. It still gave him that feeling. Every time Dean kissed him, even though he must have had done it more than a thousand times by now, it still made Cas's heart beat faster and it still gave him that tingle in his stomach, it still made him feel like he had just fallen in love with Dean and that was their very first kiss.
"Jo's here with me, she can look after Claire," Dean immediately offered. "And don't worry about what to wear, I got a suit for you. I just need you here, all else is taken care of. How fast can you make it?"
I liked him, and he liked me. For the first time in my life, I actually had the chance to have someone I wanted. Not only stolen looks and secret fantasies, no. I really could
"Yeah," Dean said as he wiped the last remains of ice cream from his jacket. Then he smiled right back at the employee. "I had a change in the schedule and thought I'd pop in today; I hope that doesn't throw things upside down for you?"
So after that talk, even if he didn't want to, Cas was forced to think once again about what Dean might possibly see him as, and which intentions Dean could possibly have for things between them.
"So, let me get this straight," she said. "You've got a weird as shit agreement with
Dean chuckled at that.
"Yeah. Things I can and probably will ask from you. First off, close physical contact such as hugging, having one arm around you, stuff like that." He looked up from the paper and over to Cas. "I'm reading all that to you. If there's something you don't agree with or want defined more closely, please interrupt"
“Well, we’re
Cas couldn't even believe it when Charlie looked up from her computer screen to tell him that they were sold out at two venues already, and when Dean came in later and Charlie told him the news - at that time the number had risen to six sold out shows - he at first thought she was kidding.
with you
"Success, then," Cas smirked with a glance back at Dean.
Now, Cas chuckled as well. "That doesn't say anything," he said, "I'm not really ... I mean I don't keep up with ... you know. The rich and the famous."
"Sorry, what now?"
She nodded, then her expression got sadder.
"Claire," he said calmly, "we're guests here, yeah? Looking. No touching, okay?"
He can't help but smile at the familiar little icon, and his smile gets even bigger as he opens the blog and faces the header that is just as familiar, as well as the description. It's nothing special, and definitely nothing personal. Just your average tumblr blog. What makes Castiel smile is not that blog itself, but rather the thought of the person behind it.
What do you do when you fall in love with your best friend?
(See the end of the chapter for
Finally, it was me who looked away and that way broke the eye contact. Not that I hadn’t enjoyed it, God no. I did it because I got nervous. I did it because if I had looked into his eyes like that for a little longer, I couldn’t have guaranteed for me to not lean in and kiss him. Having him smile at me like that was just too much of a risk, I thought.
Cas nodded. "Thank you"
because I talked to you like 20 minutes ago
The girl's smile faded slightly, and she first looked over to Dean, then back at Cas.
“Why would they?” Cas asked.
Dean stared for a second.
"No, it's just ..." Dean said, and he seemed strangely nervous to Cas, "I was just playing around. Trying something. But it's nothing. The album's finished, yeah"
Anyways, Cas had realised how much time had passed, and after some more talking, they had agreed to move in together. They had started to look for a place to live, since Dean's flat had no room for a room for Claire, and Cas's house ... he liked it, it was a nice and cozy place, but come on, it wasn't exactly luxurious, and with Dean being an international pop star and Cas being a rather successful lyricist on his team, they could definitely afford a place that didn’t have squeaking floors and heating problems.
"What," Cas chuckled, "you don't want me to try on the other one as well?"
Claire glanced over to her father in surprise as if she had never thought about what his name was (and she probably hadn't). Dean's eyes followed hers over to her father, who chuckled and now smiled at Dean.
“Would it really be?” Dean asked quietly, it was almost a whisper. “If I’m no man? For you?”
"I've loved you ever since we met," he whispered into Dean’s ear.
Cas eyed his boyfriend with a smirk.
Dinner that night was served to an accordingly small group, and afterwards I walked back to the apartment building together with Dean. We were walking next to each other, but maintaining a platonic colleague distance between us. It wasn’t very likely for anyone to see us, but just in case. You never knew, and we’d rather not hold hands for a little longer than running into a student while doing it.
"I'd love to hold your hand," he whispered into the Angel’s ear, "I want to hug you, and I want to kiss you. And I ..." Here he paused and swallowed down his nervousity before feeling ready to continue, "I think I love you, Cas"
"Yeah," Dean smiled, "he does, and he's really really good at it"
Speaking of habits, there were quite a few things that started to become some sort of rituals between us the following weeks. Every morning he would greet me at the breakfast table, smiling at me before taking a giant sip from his coffee. Dean wasn’t a morning person, I soon learned. Best was not to talk to him at all before his first cup of coffee in the morning, and frankly, knowing that detail about him did explain his typical Sunday-morning-mass-face extremely well. Every night for dinner we’d meet again, in our exact same spots opposite each other at the teacher’s table. He started stealing carrots from my plate with a grin one night after I mentioned I didn’t exactly like them. I always let him, even right the first time, without batting an eye.
"Yeah," Cas breathed absentmindedly as Charlie was already dialling a new number. He kept staring at the screen for another moment until Dean softly pulled his arm around his waist and dragged him away from Charlie's desk.
"Cas-" she started, but he interrupted her.
Cas sighed. "That wasn't supposed to happen," he said. That was the first time in that conversation he straight up lied to her, and he felt horrible about it. Everything could have been just as well true, if you twisted it a bit at least, and Cas had been talking about Dean in terms of his own feelings. But now, he was straight up lying.
, was written on the post-it,
"Yeah. I think"
"Okay," Cas said seriously, "Claire, look at me."
"Yeah," Dean chuckled, "that's generally the most interesting part for anyone who's new"
"Lexie," Cas said, "she seems nice. And she puts up with that regularly?"
The two men smiled at each other for a moment. It was Dean who finally broke the eye contact by turning to look at the street behind Cas's back.
"You ..." she started, then interrupted herself. "No, hold on. So when you asked me about him, and I was teasing you about how he's your type, you knew him already?"
Inside, he stopped and took a moment to eye the colourful Christmas decorations that was spread all across the room. There were various Christmas lights all over the walls, illuminating the entire room with their red and green colours.  A couple of paper cut-out stars and snowmen added onto the Christmas-feeling, and the highlight was of course the small Christmas tree on top of the table right next to Sam.
"Yeah," Dean smiled at him. "Tomorrow sounds good."
There was one interpretation, of course, where it all fit in. One interpretation that Jo would've screamed at him if she would have been there, and the one interpretation that Cas didn't want to see, that scared him to the bones and that he deliberately ignored.
They’re always there, and you can always talk about anything.
so I really can't help you with that.
"Great," Dean said. "Now that we've discussed rights to your body, we're left with identity rights. Basically, your face and name"
“Yeah,” he smiled back at me. Right as I thought this was the end of our conversation for now, he added: “Hey, uhm … Would you be up for going to that bar tonight? I still owe you a drink”
"Fine," Cas chuckled. He was trying really hard right now to not burst. One, because he could not believe they were having this conversation just now, and two, because she was absolutely right and Dean was exactly his type, but he hadn't thought she'd be so aware of that, and more importantly, her pointing it out just like that made him think about what he had gotten himself into, and maybe that agreement with Dean wouldn't be that much fun after all.
“As someone who got eliminated ten minutes ago, you got no say,” he groused.
"Y-yeah...?" Dean said, and now he was straight up confused. So was Cas.
For a moment, none of us said a word. We were just standing there on the cold, empty street, staring at each other. Dean’s face was still pale in shock, and I probably didn’t look any different.
“How is your relationship today?” Dean asked further. “Are you still in contact?”
“I’m right on my way back down to the gym,” he explained, “I had to get another class list from administration for my next set of practical exams. Had to walk all the way up here, during break, can you believe it?”
"Actually," Cas had a thought, "could we do that right on Wednesday?"
“It’s alright so far,” I then answered.
"Only when you're there," the girl mumbled in a sad voice.
"You're gonna, though"
“That’s between me and God,” I said.
Before I met Dean, that sounded so weird. Before I met Dean, that was a whole different version of myself. A whole different time. Sure, it was a time only 3 months ago, but at the same time it seemed like an eternity away.
Dean reached for the ring that was still sitting on the table, and with shaking hands, he struggled for a moment until he finally managed to put it onto Cas's finger.
With a quiet sigh, Cas let the pen sink down. He loosened his grip around it to let his hand rest for a moment. He looked down at his hand, his old, thin skin that was covered in countless wrinkles. Many wrinkles, bearing witness of many many years this man had lived already.
“He wouldn’t,” Cas said, “And neither would I”
"Well, that's the point," Cas smirked. "Now that I've gained some new insights concerning that song, I'm looking forward to the full experience. You know, without being oblivious"
It was that smile again, the one Cas loved so much to see and yet feared, because it was so mesmerising to him and it always ended in their smiling at each other in silence for way too long thing.
As he said that, he turned to look directly into my eyes for a second. He smiled. I smiled.
“It was,” I agreed.
Dean didn’t think of Cas as his best friend back then, he probably didn’t even know the concept yet. He didn’t call him that, but looking back, Cas still was his best friend, even back then, even at only a few years old. One of the clearest and at the same time most important memories Dean has of Cas is of the day of his mother’s funeral. Dean was only 4 years old back then, and he doesn’t remember a lot from that day. But one of the things he remembers clearly is Cas being there next to him, and Cas, just a little kid himself, trying to comfort his friend as good as possible, Cas pulling his little arms around Dean and hugging him as he noticed his silent tears.
He took a peek inside the pack to see that the only colours left were red and yellow. Then, he brought his eyes back up to meet mine with another grin.
A few hundred meters away from the restaurant, Dean suddenly softly pulled on Cas's hand and led him over to the fence. He leaned against it, looking over the water, Cas close next to him.
"Daddy writes music with you?"
"I missed you too," she mumbled against his chest.
“No,” Dean breathed. “What I did never was enough. It always was, why can’t you do this, why didn’t you do that. Why can’t you take care of your brother? Why can’t you keep the house clean? Why won’t you work more hours, why aren’t you more enthusiastic about the business? Why are you so ungrateful, and why can’t I trust you even with the simplest task? Why did you let you brother go? I just … You know, he expected a lot from me. All my life, he expected everything from me, even though I was just a kid. I don’t think he ever understood that I was just a kid. And he didn’t really let me be a kid, not after Mom died”
"Kinda, yeah," she said. "Overall, you are what we were looking for. I'm really digging the just a guy thing. Dean told me you had no idea who he was, that's pretty much perfect. And apart from your vibes as a sympathetic person, you've also got great chemistry with Dean in my opinion, and that just makes it even better."
Cas smirked. "I've left you a post-it," he said, "you can read it tomorrow"
"Actually," Dean now said, "Your Daddy and I were talking about what you would like to do today to make it the most amazing birthday. And what do you think, would you like to make some music with me?"
The next time I looked up again was quite a while later. It was almost time for dinner, so I started packing up my things. My sudden movement caused Dean to look up as well. He eyed me with a questioning look.
After the door had closed behind us, the very first thing I did – before even turning and looking at Dean – was to close all the curtains. I was on ground floor after all, and it being dark outside, it would have been way too easy for someone walking around in the yard to spot the two of us in one of the alit windows.
But life’s not always just fun and games, Dean has learned that the hard way. No, life’s not always easy. Life has rough parts, it can be hard sometimes; and because life isn’t all fun and games, the thing about best friends isn’t either.
"Yes?" Cas put down the pencil he had been using to make notes in the lyrics in front of him and turned his face to Dean.
"Yeah," Cas breathed.
"So we hit more than one nerve?" Cas asked.
"It won't be for long," Dean said. "Whoever posted this will have to take it down, and so will anyone who eventually reposted it. Maybe some people have seen already, we can't change that, but we're stopping it from spreading as fast as we can"
“Though, those stickmen have got some rough edges,” he added after a second.
"And what is it?"
Jo apparently didn't know how to interpret his silence, so she added something.
“Okay,” Cas tried to understand, “But you were children. You probably wanted to celebrate just a bit, like everyone else?”
It's quite nice, yes
Dean went with the movement and the hand that had grabbed Cas's hip until now wandered further back until it stopped in his back and helped Cas with his attempt by pulling him in even closer.
I walked up to him. It took me longer than expected as he was standing quite a distance away from the school, presumably in an attempt to be all alone and at peace with his thoughts.
Charlie pointed at a chair, and he sat down in it, Charlie next to him.
I started to lean in. Slowly, insecurely. I had never done this before.
Dean chuckled, but Claire turned her head towards her father and protested: "I'm no monster"
who had scared me? Had it really been him, or had it rather been my own mind, my own panic?
"Oh, I did!" She replied, "But at the same time, I kinda thought you'd go through with that distance thing. It was a 50/50, really"
Cas's smile faded immediately as he was reminded about that.
"I get that you're nervous, but can you
"Well, of course I do," Dean said, "if I wouldn't want to hear a yes, I wouldn't have made the offer"
We’d go down to the bar together every other night, having a drink and chatting about this and that. He made it a habit to pay for my drinks, and he wouldn’t stop, even though I repeatedly told him he didn’t need to. Some nights we would leave the bar early and take a walk around the village before returning to the school grounds.
"Yeah," Dean said, "Claire, remember what you learned? Do you wanna show Daddy?"
I like to remember how I got into his car the last day of that school year, and the wonderful summer I spent with him. That summer we told both my uncle and his brother, and it was fine, just as we had expected it to be.
Then we continued our walk down the other side of the hill, and we kept walking in complete silence. It wasn’t an awkward kind of silence, though. It was a good one. I felt entirely comfortable with him. I felt good.
Dean replied with a soft smile. "Yeah," he said. "But you know, I think it'll get better, now that there's those photos. And again, it really shouldn't be that way, and I ... I know I don't have to prove my sexuality. I don't owe anyone a proof of who I am, especially not people who insult me on anonymous social media accounts. But I think it'll just be nice to no longer hear
"Yeah," Dean smiled. "Anything else? I understand that this is rather confusing"
Dean couldn’t stay that night.
Cas scrolled through a couple more replies, and his eyes spotted the word
“Yeah,” I sighed.
He understood so many human emotions all of a sudden, and he cared. For the first time ever, after millennia of existence, Cas had started to care instead of blindly following orders.
"Garth isn't in," he said. "He took some work home, because one of the kids got sick"
A bit later, Dean leaned in closer and pressed a kiss on my neck as we were walking. I could have told him to not do that, I could have pushed him back to an appropriate distance, but again, I wanted him close, and so I didn’t.
“It was fun,”, he then shrugged with a happy smile on his face. “She used to put on Christmas music for baking, and we always sang along in our horribly off-key child voices.”
Dean looked at him with a soft expression.
"Yeah it's funny
"Oh my God," he said, "Did she do that with the ice cream? I'm so sorry! God I-"
Not for this.
you mean happiness to me
my reaction," Cas chuckled.
"She was slightly confused, rather than upset. Because I usually try to spend as much time as possible with her on the weekends, and I couldn't really explain why I had to go today. But a little bribe and the promise of her getting to pick a movie tonight did it"
Cas's face had gotten paler with every second of that video he had just watched. That of course explained Missouri's messages. He felt Dean and Charlie both turning to him, but all he did was staring at the now moveless screen.
He shifted his phone and showed the screen to Cas.
“It for sure was,” Cas chuckled. “Though, I’m not sure if I’m happy with the style yet. It’s different from what I normally write”
It was one of those tabloid magazines, Cas noticed. Probably the one Claire had been talking about in the video. Him and Dean were on the front cover, the picture of them taken at the charity even, but also way smaller at the bottom, the one where they were kissing at the café. There was a sensationalistic headline saying
Dean answered with a soft smile. "I promise"
"Uhm, hard choice," she said, "but I'd say it's
Seriously, fuck those stupid motel rooms
Dean and Cas scattered apart as if they were teenagers caught by the high school janitor in the broom closet. They both turned to the source of the sudden disturbance.
Then, Dean softly let go of him. As he slowly retreated, his steps slow and dragging due to his age, Cas’s eyes followed him.
"Thank you," Cas said. "Then, I'm in"
"What do you mean," Dean asked calmly, "you feel
, she wrote.
With now heavy breath, he watched Dean's mouth moving on him. Soft, slow at first, but within a few seconds, he seemed to really get into it. Cas placed his hand in the back of Dean's head, in his hair, holding him in place as Dean worked some true magic down there on his knees.
"Mh," Cas repeated, "And you want me on top?"
"Alright," Cas said.
With a content smirk on his face, Dean let go of Cas and they both took a step back like an embarrassed couple that just got caught making out.
Both of his mind's voices did have a point, Cas knew that. On the one hand, Dean had been very understanding so far and he probably would let this one little freak out pass as well, given that Cas could ensure him that we wouldn't do the same thing again tomorrow. And he wouldn't, Cas was quite sure about that. Kissing Dean out there as part of his acting, he could do that. But this very first kiss just now ...
"Okay," Cas agreed.
"Oh believe me," Dean smirked, "You'll get plenty of chances to observe that"
"You made it look really good, though," Cas said. "I think it suits her hair the way you did it. Don't you think?" He turned to Missouri.
. I know it was, and you know it, too. I was an idiot, an absolute idiot. And I was a selfish asshole, because I dragged you into this even though you
, was everything he wrote on it.
"Alright," he sighed. "I feel like I'm wearing clothes made out of literal bags of money, like this suit is worth more than my entire goddamn closet back home, and I just feel wrong. But that's nothing you could change, so yeah. All good."
"Congrats," she smirked, "you're now officially an employee of WMR music"
"Mh yes he does," she smirked. "He saw a chance and an excuse to make out with you and he took it"
Cas imitated what Dean was doing and reached for his coffee as well, his mind still slightly fogged, the kiss still on his lips, his heart still racing.
"Well," Cas said, "A bit nervous, maybe? But good"
"Hey!" Cas chuckled. He pulled it off and turned it around to see what was written on it.
It was later that week when Dean stormed in and asked for Cas and Garth. Neither Garth nor Charlie were currently there though, and Cas, who was sitting alone in the office breaking his head over a bumpy line in the lyrics he was currently working on, looked up at Dean with a smile.
anymore, no, now there suddenly was a second player in this game.
Most of the time best friends just have fun together, of course. They maybe play a video game together and insult each other over Mario Kart, or they do silly little things like making up funny dances to their favourite music or falling off the couch laughing about inside jokes they come up with while watching a bad movie. Best friends are, first and foremost, friends, of course. Friends who spend time together, have fun and laugh together.
"Why not?" Dean looked at him with puppy eyes and a fake pout. "Come on, it's Valentine's Day, and I just made the sappiest post about you on my blue-checkmarked Instagram"
“Can’t prove that,” Sam muttered, more to himself than to anyone else.
“Not exactly long,” I answered, “It’s my third year here”
"So," she then said and looked up to meet Cas's eyes after she had finished, "bottom line is, I can't tell anyone what you told me, I especially am not allowed to talk to press in any way, and generally the only one I should talk about the topic with is you?"
She made a short pause, then added: "Anyways, you
I gave you my days
On the outside, everything was good. We were just two men having a weirdly personal conversation about our family backgrounds and relationships with our father figures.
He quickly scribbled something on it, this time with his free hand hiding the note from Cas. His hand stopped writing, and he hesitated. Looked at Cas. Then added something very quick to the note, and sticked it onto the page, right in front of Cas.
, it said in Dean's handwriting. With a smile, he started reading the next few lines.
"That's really on you this time," Cas chuckled. And he didn't even know what caused him to do it, but the thought was suddenly there, and he added with a smirk and a mocking voice, "babe".
"Hey," Cas smiled back.
that conversation would make you
That included checking on Claire, getting her washed up and dressed. Making breakfast, and making sure she ate it right. Cleaning up the kitchen, because of course Claire made a little mess, as always.
you’re the best that ever happened
My hips pushed up against him again, and without taking his mouth off my body, he moved back at me, causing me to let out a quiet moan.
She didn't seem too happy about it when she learned that he would be gone for that time every day for quite a while, and she said she had already hated that with his old job - to which Cas chuckled in response saying that nobody really liked going to work that much, but he had to.
"Yeah," he shrugged. "I still don't understand why Dean told me to take the break if he knew he was working on another song that stressed everyone out, but yeah"
you’d listen, you’d be there, you’d take away the cold
"No idea," he said. "It's a good song, though. He did a great job. I just wish he wouldn't have thrown it in last minute."
! It wasn't so much when I had to clean up her and the entire room. I still got stains on the floor!"
And that human, that one silly little human that seemed so unimportant at the first glance, that one single little American man, the one that meant so much to him that words couldn’t possibly describe it – that one had made him understand a lot, almost everything.
"Alright," she sighed. He knew that she knew he lied, but she didn't mention it and he was thankful for that. "Are you sure that's what you wanna do?"
"Yeah," Cas agreed with another smile.
There was nothing like that between them, at all. Maybe he was crushing on Dean, okay, but Cas certainly wasn't the only one. And maybe, yes, just maybe it was a bit more than that, maybe it was more than just a crush, admittedly. But that still didn't change anything. Because no matter how fast Dean's kiss made his heart race, and no matter how good Cas felt in his arms, Dean didn't feel the same way.
"Claire," the woman repeated, "I like that. Hi Claire. I'm Jo."
“Yeah,” Dean agreed quietly. “Yeah, it really was”
"See," he said, "I knew they would do that"
"Yeah, I wish I still had that choice," Dean said. "To just not keep up, I mean. It can be really tough, the PR shit. One bored wannabe journalist puts out a rumour and you're busy for weeks trying to keep the damage as little as possible. That's why I told you to cover her face. They can be ... I mean probably those people out there didn't mean any harm, but the wrong person gets their hands on those photos and makes up a story and suddenly you got your kid all over national tabloids."
"I don't know," Cas sighed. "Maybe, yeah. I just ... I'm just scared, you know? Because I don't know what's gonna happen, and I have so little control over everything that's happening, and he ..."
"Yeah," Dean sighed. "Cas, when I say you can talk to me, I mean it. Really. If you don't want to, okay fine, I can't make you. But please don't feel like you have to pretend anything for me. If I do anything that's too much for you, you can tell me."
But the thing was, Cas didn't
"They're idiots, Cas," she said. "They're nothing but stupid hateful losers. You're way better than that, and especially now, you're in a position to just not give a fuck about them."
That was the moment when the meeting room door was opened and Charlie came in, only to stop right away and eye the both of them with visible irritation.
He was nervous again the next morning when he woke up with Claire snuggled up against his chest, and he was even more nervous when he said goodbye to her at Missouri's doorstep. Apparently he was nervous enough for Missouri to notice, because she asked if he was alright.
"What, just like that?"
"Our plan is, and Charlie, please correct me if I get anything wrong, to approach this without giving out your name. I told you about our basic idea already yesterday, and that's what we're working with. A down to earth guy who doesn't want any of his boyfriend's publicity. We're gonna do the sunglasses thing in public, mostly at least, maybe there'll be a couple 'accidental' shots that show more you without. Depending on how it goes, maybe I'll ask you to let me take photos for my official social media, but I'd do that also without showing your whole face. It might happen though that some journalists start digging and figure out your name. But there won't be an official mention of your name on my side. Also, as we discussed, your daughter will not be part of this agreement at all, I won't ask you to involve her in any way whatsoever, and we're gonna do our best to not get her into another situation like the one yesterday. Which I'm very sorry about, by the way."
All cleaned up and freshly dressed in his sleep clothes, Cas climbed into bed a couple minutes later. His daughter was still deeply asleep. He pressed a soft kiss on her head and tucked the blanket in all around her before he made himself comfortable and fell asleep surprisingly fast, in his dreams finally free from the worries about Dean and Jo.
"Good," Dean then said. "It's really ... you don't have to put up with that, seriously. As for me ... I'm inured to that by now, I'd say, because after years of this, I'm somehwat used to it. Doesn't mean it can't hurt. But I think I've grown to the point where I can read such a comment and realize that it doesn't mean anything. It's not important. It's just some idiot on the internet being a dick, and it doesn't matter the slightest for what I do, and there's many many other people who don't think that way"
“Yeah,” I smiled at him. “I got the impression”
"Yeah," Cas nodded, "I've overheard some talk about that"
"Leave that there," he told her as he was softly placing it and her hand reached for it, "it cools your head down"
After a moment, Cas suddenly stood up. As Dean looked up to him in surprise, Cas offered him his hand.
"Okay ..." Cas mumbled thoughtfully. He looked at Dean for a moment.
I turned my face to eye him for a moment.
"It's, uhm ..." Cas hesitated. Yes, what exactly was it? "It's complicated. Shaky, right now. I don't ... to be honest, I'm not sure."
"Cas!" Dean greeted him with a big grin. "I'm wishing you the happiest of mornings!"
The entire team went on with their work, by now that involved preparation for the tour a lot more than work on the album, as the latter was finished, and then, suddenly, it was the day before the release already.
"Okay," Cas replied quietly.
I kept asking in my mind.
, just Dean, right there with him.
even though there's only like 5 women in SPN (I know it's more than that but like ... you know) the show is horribly uncreative when it comes to their names, and as a result of that, this chapter introduces this fic's 2nd Jo. I try to always make it clear which one we're talking about (mostly, Dean goes along with Jo Harvelle and Cas with Sister Jo/Anael). Sorry about that bit of confusion, I just really love both of them and wanted to include them :)
Cas scrolled through the article. It didn't exactly reveal any news, except for the obvious
After unpacking the presents, they spent some more time together before Jo and Missouri both said goodbye and left the two of them alone.
"Yeah," Cas sighed, "that could be a reason. I try to keep her busy, but I got things to do, you know?"
Because that’s what best friends do.
"She loved every second of it," Cas said with a happy smile towards Dean across the table.
Cas startled at the sudden noise, and a bunch of the sprinkles flew through the kitchen.
"Yeah," Cas stuttered, "Yeah, I, uhm ... yeah. Sure. Of course."
Dean had posted a selfie with Cas. They had spent quite some time picking a photo for this post, and in the end, Dean had decided to go with the one that showed Cas's eyes the best.
Inside his own room, there was only a dimmed light on. Claire was peacefully asleep in the bed, wound up in the blanket that was way too big for her.
There’s the truth, but you don't want
"You good?" Dean now asked quietly.
“You’re incredible, Cas,” he chuckled.
"Mh," she made and leaned in to look into the pan on the stove, "you're cooking?"
After a quick breakfast with Claire during which none of them talked much, they both got into the car. Cas dropped her off at school and after their usual "have a nice day" - "you too" - "love you" - "bye Dad" exchange, he finally was off to work as well.
Dean Winchester need an English teacher for?"
It's a notification from the tumblr app. And admittedly, the fact that he's even getting this notification is a miracle considering the functionality of the app, but that's not what makes him smile.
I looked back at him with a smile before I leaned in a bit and whispered into his ear:
Your beautiful soul
. That was all that Cas felt and thought in that moment,
Without a word, I pulled my hands out of my pocket. I immediately felt the ice-cold air on my warm skin as I held them out in between us, open, inviting.
“I’m sorry about that,” I said without looking at him.
"At first, I didn't really think about it," he continued. "What I saw was a nice poem, but well, you are an English teacher, after all. And maybe it is a rather romantic poem, but I thought, he's young, and whatever he does with some green-eyed girl is none of my business. It didn't click right away. I read
You're feeding ducks?
“Well ‘cos men don’t-“
I looked around, turned in every direction, but it was just me standing lonely on the empty street. The person was gone.
"No," he said. "Come on. They're probably waiting for us"
They both were there on Dean's bed, breathing heavily, still holding each other tight at their wrists. Cas on top of Dean, both trying to catch their breath back, sweaty, sticky skin, the stickiest between them on Dean's stomach.
The next day, the album launched. Well to be exact, at midnight the streams became available online and physical copies went on sale in online as well as real life shops, and as Charlie tracked, lots of people went to stream it right after launch. The album sold well right the first day, as both Jo and Charlie had predicted because of the numbers of pre-orders, and what sold even better were the concert tickets.
Several minutes later, I finally stopped. I tried to articulate a clear line about what I asked for, then ended my silent prayer with a just as silent “Amen”.
“Good morning,” he greeted me.
"Nothing," she said. "Sorry. I was just thinking"
"Probably, yeah," Cas laughed. "So, what are you going down to L.A. for ?"
"Mh," Cas smirked and looked up directly into Dean's eyes, "I could, yeah. But you wouldn't have anything to look forward to if I did. Gotta keep your work experience exciting"
quite a few more times. It seemed like a close assumption for many of Dean's fans, and slowly Cas realised that the plan Dean had told him about really could work. Especially on the basis of this photo, it really had good chances to work.
kind of like. Not
Cas shrugged a little. "Because you don't know where we're going. I know you're usually asleep at this time, so you could be wondering if I'm going to keep you up all night, the answer being 'possibly,' and—"
Cas smiled proudly. “Race you?" he suggested.
Cas laughed, and Dean felt it rumble in his chest before he heard it. "Wake up. It's morning."
Castiel took the book and flipped absently through the pages.
"You could kiss me now," Cas said suddenly.
"I'm fine, Cas." Dean brushed dirt off his slacks before holding out his arms. He couldn’t hold back a grin when Cas clung to the tree for support. “You next.”
“Shut up.”
"There's one wrapped in a napkin behind the coffee maker."
"I like it," Cas said, leaning against the trunk for balance.
"No worries there," John interrupted. He met Dean's eye. "I'll get it out of him."
"Hell no."
God. It wasn't like Cas was going to see that Dean's socks were the same shade of gray and tackle him to the ground in the middle of church. (But Dean still checked his socks in three different lights to make sure they were the same.)
something. Dean wasn't exactly sure if it was supposed to. He thought that untying Cas's tie for him and stripping to undershirts and bare skin meant something, but perhaps it didn't. He thought that the gentle brush of Cas's hand through his hair meant something, thought that the heat of Cas's palm gripped tight to his meant something. But perhaps it didn't.
He shook it off as best as he could, and took the paper towels from Sam. As he pat his shoulder dry, Dean glanced back at the door.
"Oh," Cas breathed.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Hush. There's nothing to apologize for."
Dean didn't like it when his dad hit him in front of Sam. He didn't like it when his dad hit him at all, but Sam's sad eyes and ineffective pleas just made the whole thing worse.
Dean was pretty sure that he was headed straight to hell. And he definitely wouldn’t see Sam there. “Sure,” he lied.
Dean cleared his throat and tried (but failed) to look Bartholomew in the eye. "My dad isn't at church. He didn't come today."
Cas’s grin faded but his eyes stayed cheerfully crinkled. “Goodbye, Dean.”
"Ready?" Cas asked, so close to Dean that his lips brushed Dean's jaw.
"Is Lot really the hero of this?" Dean asked.
Dean shrugged and rolled to his feet. "I don't know."
know that sign, and
But this. The sweet, gentle rub of Dean's thumb on the back of Cas's hand meant something. Girls had released his hand for that, gone for his collar instead, and drawn him in for a kiss. It was more than that, though. And by the way it made Cas's frown fade, he knew that.
"Race you!" Cas called, already taking off for Dean's house.
"It's nothing." Cas wiped his face with the back of his hand and turned away from Dean.
Sammy didn't have to be like this. He could be loud and free; he could do his homework in peace; he could spill a glass of milk without his eyes growing large and panicked.
father says?"
"His name is Dean," Castiel corrected reflexively, even though his heart was pounding.
"That's very noble."
Sammy grinned into his bowl. "Jerk."
"Both heroes of God's people," Bartholomew acquiesced.
Dean remembered his first conversation with Cas years ago. How Cas had touched his wrist so gently, had traced his hand over the tiny cuts on Dean's palm. Dean had deserved them. He deserved the burns and the cuts and the bruises. He deserved it all.
"There it is!" Dean pointed to a tree with branches as wide as Dean himself. It was low to the ground at some points, but Dean had once climbed a few stories high in this tree. "It's perfect, Cas, I swear."
"How?"
“I would like to try again. That is, if you’re amenable.”
don't make me go."
"No, I am perfectly content," Cas clarified. "Unfortunately, I have family."
"No, it's not. I'm nothing. I'm going to live here forever, hating myself. But Sammy's better than me, Cas. Swear to God, he's gonna be a bigshot lawyer someday. That kid deserves everything I can give him."
"I thought..."
Dean laughed and glanced over at Naomi, the preacher's wife. She was bouncing her youngest son on her hip, a fat baby boy named Gabriel. He was always clad in little blue onesies, or tiny green t-shirts with tractors rolling across the front. Meanwhile Anna was clinging to her dad's leg with a pink bow the size of her face perched on the top of her head.
“Very well.” Cas gave Dean a gummy grin. “Would you like me to walk you home?”
At first it was a careful press of their lips together. Cas's lips were chapped but soft, and his nose bumped against Dean's gently. Pressed against Cas everywhere, Dean felt warm and safe and giddy.
"It is very nice to meet you," Castiel said in a way that felt weirdly real.
The church service was a little longer than usual and included a very pointed sermon about obeying your father and mother. Bartholomew never used any specific examples, but he stared at the front row enough to set off a flurry of whispers after church. (According to the soccer moms, Anna quit ballet. According to the old men, Cas was smoking weed.)
," Sammy complained.
"Still. Please be careful."
"There you are!" Dean crowed triumphantly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I love you more than you know, Castiel," Naomi said, eyes welling with tears. She put light fingertips on his shoulder. "This won't be easy, but you'll come to see that I'm pushing you because I love you."
"You just know you can't catch me," Cas taunted.
Dean found that Cas really
Trigger warnings: homophobia, child abuse (emotional and implied physical), discussion of Bible text (Sodom and Gomorrah), references to conversion therapy
"In this book, he recounts the time when earthly desires turned him away from the Lord."
Dean moved his hands from Cas's shoulder and leaned over Cas, so so slowly, resting his forearms next to Cas's head. "Okay?"
"I mean in the future. Later."
"Hmm?"
"It's a nice color on you," Cas offered, looking back up at Dean.
Cas sighed. "Dean, it seems that you are looking for a specific answer. I do not understand what that answer is, however, so I must ask you to be more direct."
"And?"
Dean rubbed a hand across his face. "Just. If anyone notices, you're singing
"I wish I could sleep forever."
Naomi always took the dust jackets off of the books before she gave them to Castiel, leaving them bare in dull green or blue or black, the author's name in gold along the side. Castiel loved the feeling of the cloth binding, so different from the leather cover of his Bible.
Cas wrapped his arm around Dean. "Falsehood. We're your family, perhaps. But not the only objects of your affection."
“Try what? Kissing?”
Naomi was crying.
"I'm not uncomfortable!" Dean rushed to say. If Cas thought he was uncomfortable, he would never give Dean that soft look or touch him so tenderly again. "Just confused."
Dean stuck out his hand, but Castiel didn't take it. He furrowed his brow and touched Dean's wrist lightly. "What happened to you?"
Dean felt almost uncomfortably warm.
Cas smiled a little. His eyes darted to his house, and he handed Dean his skateboard. “You need to leave, Dean. I apologize.”
, and then Dean couldn’t track every point of contact anymore, could barely tell what was up and what was down and what was Cas.
Idly, Castiel wondered why these camps were so far from civilization. Was it to keep people from running away? Or were the screams and sobs of hell on earth too loud for respectable neighbors?
Cas made a soft sort of hum at that, and they fell quiet as they rode down the block. The cicadas filled the silence, and the heavy, sweet smell of magnolias draped over them in the cool night air. Cas offered to let Dean hold onto the seat of his bike and coast as Cas pedaled for both of them. Dean wasn't going to protest, especially when their new arrangement had him even closer to Cas.
Cas's eyes focused back on Dean and he didn't say anything, but it was obvious. Dean had known for years.
Cas moved into the space Dean created. "It was mine when I was a child, but it fell into disrepair when we moved away."
(Possibly?)
"Hello, Dean," Cas said fondly.
of it?"
Dean wasn't sure if Cas wanted him to say something in response to that. (What
Eileen's eyes widened.
"You can not have faith in God, and be okay with homosexuality!" Bartholomew boomed. He seemed to realize he was yelling, because he forced a smile. “But this is about love.”
Cas moved his hands to Dean's chest, resting there for a brief moment before busying himself retying Dean's tie.
"Quit sniveling," John ordered.
"What's the difference?"
(Sometimes Dean wasn't sure if he wanted that.)
Cas stiffened at the sound of his sister's voice and whipped his head around.
Then Cas's little sister Anna nudged him and pointed up to their father. Cas didn't exactly smile before turning back, but he crinkled his eyes at Dean and that was just as good. Maybe better, Dean decided, grinning to himself.
"And my name is Castiel. Not 'preacher's son.'" Castiel illustrated his point with air quotes. "If you would be so kind."
Cas's eyes were pointed at Dean, but Dean kinda got the feeling that Cas wasn't seeing him as Cas inhaled deeply. "I must be separated from worldly concerns," he finally said, the rhythm of his voice unfamiliar. "I must do what my Father commands me to do."
"Cas?"
Cas just smiled and tipped his chin up in that proud way he had. "Let's go," he said, instead of really answering.
Cas rested his head on Dean's shoulder. "I met you."
Dean rubbed his hand across his face and sighed. Sammy was just an awkward preteen who was too smart for his own good. There was no point in getting mad at him for things.
It's not that Dean was nervous. Of course he wasn't. Cas was still Cas (even though Dean had recently discovered that his lips were softer than they looked). He was still rumpled and thoughtful and weird. And things hadn't really changed, had they? The look in Cas's eyes right before he kissed Dean's forehead was one Dean had seen millions of times but had never understood. Now, though? Dean thought he kinda got it.
It took a moment for Dean to join Cas in his sprint. Dean must be forgiven, though, because the place Cas had kissed on his forehead still tingled, and that was impossible to ignore. The promise of midnight also had him slightly unsteady.
your old man says?"
Dean hated himself.
"I'm trying, Mother," he said, holding up his pamphlet. "Look. It's on a lake."
Cas didn't say anything.
Cas rolled his eyes. "Take peace in the Lord," he said. He looked completely serious and completely sarcastic at the same time, and the expression was so familiar that something in Dean ached. He wanted to tell Cas that the Lord wouldn't give him any peace.
Castiel looked up.
Dean bumped Cas's shoulder lightly. "What grade are you in?"
"Yeah."
Dean opened his window and grinned. "You wanna come in?" he whispered. "I'll pour you a lemonade."
"Apologies." Cas took a deep breath. His shoulders slumped in his deep red dress shirt, and somewhere at the edge of Dean's mind, he thought of communion wine and fresh blood.
"The devil!" Bartholomew Novak shouted.
(Dean resisted the urge to pull Cas close and stay with him forever and ever. Just the two of them.)
“Yes, really. God, what kind of monster do you think I am?”
It didn’t take long to reach their destination, running and laughing like men gone mad. When they unbuttoned their dress shirts, breathless and hot, Dean realized Cas wasn't wearing an undershirt. He wondered if that was also an act of rebellion against his mother. (He wasn't complaining, whatever the reason.)
Dean wasn't sure that the protection he was giving himself was worth the punishment of disobedience. He dropped his arms back by his sides and looked at John.
"Why would I worry?" Dean asked.
Dean ruffled Cas's hair. It was a familiar gesture between the two of them, not charged with anything except late-night giddiness. "Lead the way then."
Cas shrugged, looking up at the branches soaring above his head. "I'm afraid of falling."
"I'm not anymore," Cas hastened to say, as if Dean didn't know that. (As if Dean didn't know Cas better than anyone.) "It's just... my family isn't about love. It's duty, I suppose, over anything else."
"You?" Castiel asked bluntly.
? What was Cas going to do that couldn't be done on the church's front lawn?
(Dean wondered if maybe there would be a time when he wouldn't want to be alive anymore.)
Cas rolled his eyes, a flash of blue in the dark, and held out his hand for Dean. It was unnecessary aid, given that the window was just a few feet above the ground, but Dean took it. Cas's grip was stronger now, and as Dean tried to slide out the window quietly, Cas's hand went instinctively to his waist to steady him.
"Lot wasn't," Dean decided. "Not to his own kids, at least."
And it was true. Castiel loved his mother. He knew she wanted the best for him. In bed, staring into the darkness, Castiel wondered what he should do.
Anna looked up at Cas thoughtfully. "I
"It looks good," Dean said finally. "Matches your eyes."
"The air quotes were unnecessary."
This time when Cas stared, Dean stared right back. The tension was like something Dean could touch, could hold. They were already smushed together, but now Dean could feel the heat of Cas's body; he could even feel the soft rise and fall of Cas's stomach as he breathed.
The bright green numbers on Dean's digital clock cast a strange kind of light on his wall as he retied his shoes for the fifth time that night. It was 11:58, and Dean had already brushed his teeth twice since dinner.
"Shall I read from the Scripture?" Bartholomew finally said. "Perhaps it will help you see the evil of your ways."
"It's close?"
He jumped.
. You don't gotta talk about it."
Cas didn't exactly smile when Dean pulled back to check his expression, but his face relaxed and his eyes went soft and he pulled Dean into a tight hug.
"There's no toilet."
Cas let Dean help him up, then frowned at him. "What makes you confused?"
Dean stared at his little brother's face. The preteen jumble of adult and childish features, awkwardly proportioned. The trace of guilt in his eyes.
Dean grinned. "You can save my sinful mortal soul later, Cas."
"I love you, Castiel."
Sam wrapped the bandages tightly around Dean shoulder, biting his lip in concentration. Dean closed his eyes. With any luck, he was close already. If he stopped clinging to Sam and Cas and the future, maybe he could just... slip away.
Cas licked his lips. "Hello."
Cas pulled Dean into his chest, rubbing his back and pressing kisses into his hair.
"Nothing, Cas." Dean put his hand on Cas's shoulder, feeling a little self-conscious. He couldn't remember how he used to act around Cas before. It definitely wasn't like this. Dean felt judging eyes on him, but he turned around quickly and nobody was looking his way.
"So are you," Sammy argued, his little face screwing up. "It's not fair."
Just then, the light turned green and John turned his attention back to the road.
"I know you love Dean Winchester," Naomi began, "but you're young. You know the love of childhood friends. You can't understand the love between a husband and wife."
Both of them loved him in a different way. He, too, loved them. It felt alien for Castiel to love so strongly that it made his stomach twist and his chest hurt. He was accustomed to love as a steady, consistent truth. His family’s love was comforting yet remote, like a Bible verse he memorized but couldn’t quite understand.
"Good."
"I've seen the way you look at the Winchester boy."
Dean flicked the Bible closed. Sam glanced at him questioningly, but didn't say anything. Dean kind of wished Sam would elbow him in the side and hiss "what's your problem" quietly enough that nobody would hear. Dean would tell him. Dean
Cas coughed to disguise a laugh.
Cas hummed thoughtfully. "I don't think you do. I wasn't me."
Cas bit his lip. "I don't...."
"You said that already."
," Sam hissed.
to tell him.
Just to know that he was okay.
Sammy squeezed back. “I love you, too,” he whispered into Dean’s shoulder.
"Rest, Castiel," his mother said gently. "You've had a long day."
"And now?"
The boy sat next to Dean on the small stone bench. His eyes caught the engraving on the side and traced the Bible verse with his fingertips. "You are not at peace," he said, this time as a statement.
"Hello, Dean."
Normally, Dean would've snickered at such a ridiculous name, but the look on Castiel's face told him not to. Instead, he just nodded. "I'm Dean."
Bartholomew saw that it was good.
Dean sighed again and stood. "Keep your voice down, Sammy. He's hungover."
Cas grinned. “You’ll miss me.”
"Why not?"
"Please tell me you're praying. Or singing
There was a weird kind of feeling in Dean's stomach. He was so
"And Moses. Good guy, Moses." Dean tried to pull biblical figures out of the cobwebby parts of his head. "And Esther. I liked her."
of lying to the boy he loved. But even though Cas couldn't read Dean's mind (or his heart) the way Dean wished he could, he trusted Cas more than anyone else.
God's plan," Dean offered. He wasn't sure if he believed what he was saying (wasn't sure if he believed in God or angels or Jesus fricking Christ). But Castiel Novak was having a crisis two feet away from him, so Dean tried. "Things happen for a reason, and all that?"
"He won't hurt me, Dean. He was going to, once, but he
"Yes. A man of faith."
"I'm leaving when you move out," Sam whispered intently. "I'll live with my friends, or call Bobby—"
Castiel Novak, the preacher's son, was already staring at him. Cas seemed to know what Dean was thinking, always seemed to know. He smiled, those ridiculously blue eyes looking right into Dean.
"Are there any more buns?"
(Both brothers knew what snoring meant. Their father always snored after passing out drunk. He'd be angry and hungover when he woke up, but his sleep would be heavy until at least midday.)
Dean gestured to the deep slash on his shoulder, and Sam set to patching him up. "Tight or loose?" he asked, holding the roll of bandages.
as though he had sinned.
Cas rolled his eyes and sighed heavily. Dean didn't feel too bad for him, not with Cas's crinkled eyes and roaming hands. "You could kiss me, Dean," he repeated.
Dean rubbed at his forehead. "You don't know
Dean grinned and squirmed out of Cas's loose hold. "Woah, no way!"
"Hi, Cas!"
"Do you remember what happened last time we tried to call Bobby?"
Dean checked the quickly thinning crowd outside the church and spotted Sam. "I'll see you later," he said, flashing a quick smile at both Cas and Anna.
"Dean."
"How was your week?"
"I got you," Cas said quietly. He hooked his chin over Dean's shoulder and stayed there, pressed against Dean's back until Dean's breathing calmed. When Dean relaxed his shoulders and placed his hand over Cas's, he got a soft hum in reply. "There you go," Cas murmured.
"Is he asleep?"
"Good."
"Cas!"
Cas kinda rolled his eyes at that, but he also smiled, so Dean knew it was okay. Cas started walking again, one hand twisted up in Dean's t-shirt. There was a full moon (or something real close to it), but it was blocked by the trees. Cas seemed to know the way, though.
"Church is starting soon," Dean said, mostly just to say something. (He really didn't like this kind of silence. It felt too loud.)
to grab Sam by the hand and find somewhere where they'd both be safe.
"I thought you weren't allowed to watch movies."
Sam bit the inside of his cheek. “Okay.”
aren't learning anything."
go near you again. If the cops won't arrest him, try a restraining order or —"
Sam nodded and slipped out of the bathroom, quick and quiet in a way he so seldom was. It hurt, like a knot somewhere between Dean's heart and throat, to see Sam so small.
Dean felt his legs turning to jelly, felt his heart beating so hard that his whole body was drumming. Bartholomew gripped Dean's shoulder (hard), and smiled so charmingly that people barely acknowledged Dean as they marched back into the church.
He grinned widely. "Cas."
The boy blinked quickly and tilted his head again. "I'm the preacher's son."
Dean spun around at the sound of Cas's voice, tripping over his little brother in the process. Sammy pinched Dean's arm in retaliation, but Dean barely noticed.
"Maybe this
Castiel stared at his mother, heart in the back of his throat. "What have you seen, Mother?"
"Uh... yeah. Why?"
God-knows-what, but Cas stopped him with a single finger barely pressing into Dean's chest.
Cas grabbed Dean's hip and squeezed just hard enough to make a point. "And I always follow directions?"
(Dean almost swooned at that.)
“I don’t think you’re a monster.” Cas stood up a little taller. “And don’t use God’s name in vain. It’s rude.”
In his room with the pamphlets, Castiel halfheartedly flicked through the glossy pages. One was on a lake. Another featured miles of gentle green hills, not a single McDonald's or Walmart to be seen.
"I love you, too."
"Nothing?"
"I love you and Sammy and my father," Dean countered. "Nobody else."
of suffering in silence, so
"He's sad that Mom died," Dean answered, because that's what the school counselor had told him. He tried to understand, but he really didn't care that
"Her name's Eileen. She's new."
"I think we all three know what I'm about to say, right?"
Dean grinned. "Damn right, kid. You're gonna do great things."
"I'm not going there on vacation," Castiel snapped, feeling a pang of guilt when his mother flinched.
"Hey, Cas." Dean glanced over his shoulder at Cas, shooting him a winning grin. "Gimme a minute with these hooligans."
Cas reached out and brushed a stray hair into place. Dean froze at the feeling of Cas's fingers against his skin. Cas was taking his time, it seemed, but Dean couldn't stop him, didn't
"Make sure you're decent. I'll come around midnight. You still have that skateboard, do you not?"
yet. That's part of growing up, Cas."
(Once, when Dean had smuggled some beer from the fridge into his room, he came to the conclusion that Cas must be an Angel of the Lord sent to save Dean from being gay. When he woke up the next morning, he remembered that he absolutely was
Dean couldn't help but chuckle as he pushed off on his skateboard. "That kind of oh?" he teased.
Cas just laughed, something Dean could feel against his chest more than he could hear. It didn't feel mean, but Dean still felt his face turn red, buried in Cas's shoulder.
"I brushed my hair," Cas said when he was done laughing, and now it was Dean's turn to laugh.
Cas cleared his throat. "That's kissing."
Sunday. God, that was almost an entire week to go without seeing Cas. Especially after that almost-kiss. And the feel of Cas’s hands on his bare skin. Dean had never looked forward to church so much before.
"Nothing." Dean couldn't remember how he got the large, splotchy burn on his wrist, so it wasn't exactly a lie. (He still felt kinda guilty for not telling the truth though. It was something about those blue blue eyes.)
"Yeah, I am."
Hope y’all enjoy Cas’s POV!!
Castiel turned Dean's hand over gently to squint at his palm. A dozen tiny cuts littered his skin where John had hurled a beer bottle at Dean and left him to clean up the pieces.
"Why does Dad hit you?" Sammy asked, like he did almost every time this happened.
Sammy nodded. “Sure, Dean. But I’ll see you again, right?”
"It's a blur, man," he'd say, rubbing the back of his neck casually. "You know how it is."
"Well, of course you weren't
Dean took a deep breath. "He has a temper."
Cas grinned and climbed the fence easily, dropping lightly to the ground on the other side. He peered through the slats of the fence at Dean. “Coming?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The view out of the treehouse was, in Dean's opinion, awesome. A few stubborn stars clung to the purple-gray of dawn, but he could see orange sunlight through the trees. It was early enough that dew was clinging to Dean's hair, but the birds were loud and cheery.
"Hey, don't sound so surprised." Dean tugged Cas into a hug and peppered kisses on the top of his head. As Cas clung to his t-shirt, Dean realized that Cas really was surprised. "You're stuck with me for a while yet, Cas."
He still felt the touch of his mother's soft hands in his hair, so different from Dean's. For a second, a moment of blinding clarity, he knew it was either her or Dean. It was safety or freedom.
He took a breath.
They dived back back into each other, their ties forgotten in the grass. It was slower this time. Dean felt (with a combination of horror and glee) like he was the star of a romcom, like maybe a violin should be serenading Cas and him as they kissed each other breathless in the grass.
"Mhmm." Cas made a weird motion, like he would've shrugged if he wasn't pressed against Dean. "I think loving like that
"Who hurt you?"
It’s not actually the last day, y’all, I’m just dramatic. More chapters are coming. What are your thoughts on this change in events?? Please let me know if I should add any other trigger warnings!!
“Have you been teaching here for long?” he asked after we had walked a couple of steps next to each other in silence. It was nothing but some casual small talk, I was of course aware of that, but for some reason him initiating a conversation did get me excited.
"I got a job," he then said.
I watched him park, and when the door finally opened and that stranger set his foot onto the yellow gravel of the yard, it took my breath away for a second. Out of that car stepped the most beautiful man I had ever seen. And that is not an exaggeration. I had seen beautiful men before; I had been attracted to beautiful men before.
"Yeah," Cas said honestly, "I will"
"Thank you," Dean whispered back. Just a second later, he pulled back out of the hug and after another smile at Cas, he finally gave in and lifted Claire up on his arm.
Claire had looked up again, this time she was staring at Dean with a smile on her face and big, surprised eyes.
Her father gave the performance a little applause, and she broke free from Dean's arms and climbed over to him. Dean carefully put the guitar down next to him and watched with a smile how Claire climbed into Cas's lap.
"Yeah," Cas chuckled before he took the first one to the bathroom to try it on.
"The suit," Cas sighed, "yeah. For that event where the kiss happened. It was sort of a fancy thing, and I don't have clothes for that obviously, so he gave me one of his suits to wear. Like a really fancy thing. And expensive. Hella expensive, Jo. And when I tried to give it back to him, he told me to keep it. Said it looked good on me and he didn't need it"
"Sure he doesn't," Jo said and rolled her eyes to it. "Anyways," she picked Claire up, " love, what was your favourite parts of Dean's show, huh?"
"Hey," Jo greeted him, and without a word, Cas got up and pulled his best friend into a tight hug. Slightly perplexed but very gentle, she put her arms around him as well and held him.
"What's wrong?" She asked. "You've been zoned out completely all night, what's it?"
There was a spark in his eyes that seemed familiar to me, though I had never seen it anywhere but the bedroom. And speaking from a sober perspective, I should have never seen it anywhere near public, and definitely not out on the street.
He laughed at the memories.
“Yes,” Dean agreed with me, “It could be, probably, but so far we’re rather good at finding ways to entertain ourselves”
Now that made me wonder: Did he know about me? And if he did, how had he found out? Had he picked up something? Had he caught me staring at him at the library without me noticing? Had he seen the page in my notebook when I was so sure he hadn’t?
"The singer"
He felt Dean's body relaxing, he heard Dean's breath become calmer, more quiet. With his hand on Dean's naked chest, Cas could feel his constant heartbeat.
He of course felt like they knew. He felt like someone just had to know. And maybe, people did. Maybe some of the parents really did eye him for a little too long when he took Claire to the playground on Saturday, and maybe the cashier gave him sort of a weird glance when he was paying for his groceries later that day, but nobody said anything.
This was the moment. The one perfect moment, and we both knew it. But I knew just as well he wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t, because this wasn’t his choice to make. It was on me. If I wanted anything to happen right now, if I wanted anything to happen with him, this was my chance. This was my perfect chance to let him know.
He looked down to see this gesture, then looked up into my eyes again. Insecure, surprised. A nod from me, and Dead pulled his hands out of his own pockets.
Now both of us fully naked, he came down on me again. He’s right there on top of me, I thought. Dean Winchester, naked, in bed with me. Never, not in my wildest fantasies, had I ever imagined it to be like that.
“Yeah,” I smiled. “We always got along well. My uncle’s always been a great man. Very understanding; and he can give the best advice. We exchange letters regularly, and I try to make a visit at least once a year.”
Cas really didn't want it to be that way, but fact was, right now his heart was beating a lot faster than before, he could still feel the soft skin of Dean's lips on his own, they were still moist from the kiss, and his mind was screaming about it, about Dean, unmistakably reminding him that this was Dean, and he'd just kissed him, and he
Fair enough, the second player had been there from the very beginning – I just hadn’t realized he was in the game. All this time I had thought, or had rather tried to convince myself, that it was just me. That Dean was that your average heterosexual male in his mid-20s, that we were just being friends. Maybe not even friends but instead rather the only two colleagues close in age who spent their free time together for the sake of social interaction.
At one of those walks Dean, without a warning, threw a snowball at me. That quickly escalated into a snowball fight with no sign of mercy and ended with him tackling me down into the snow. Having me pinned to the ground like that, he kissed me tenderly before dropping another handful of snow right into my face – to which I responded with a nice load of snow in his coat’s collar.
"Wow," Cas managed to breathe. He had never exactly thought about how a place like this would look like, but what he was looking at right now definitely was impressive.
He didn't
"No, it's ..." Cas sighed. "You were right," he then said. There it was. She had been right. She had been right all the time, Cas had to admit that. She had been right, and he had been one big idiot.
"Everybody has a flower crown face," Claire decided and already started picking some daisies out of the grass.
"Yeah," Cas smiled, "I think if that's okay for Dean, we can come by now and then"
desperate. Or at least that was what he liked to tell himself.
Cas’s wouldn’t dare to say that he now understood love, because he didn’t. probably nobody had ever truly understood love. But he was content in saying that the word now had meaning to him. If someone was talking about love, he could definitely imagine something, make out a meaning below the word – no matter in which language.
"Oh just some rumour bullshit," Dean said, "I'll explain later. How fast can you be here?"
"So, he was an absolute ass to you and didn't even apologise?"
"I do love him," he said calmly. "Like that. The fairy tale love of my life kind of way"
Then the breaths became calmer, the tight grip around the other one's wrist and arm loosened, a condom came of, and then they were there, lying next to each other now, in silence, just breathing.
Cas swallowed hardly at what he had just heard. He acknowledged what Dean had said with a slight nod.
"Yeah," Dean now chuckled, "let's hope they enjoy that"
And this
"Thank you"
They were sitting closely next to each other, their shoulders almost touching, and when Dean pulled up his leg to place it over his other knee to sit in a more relaxed way, their legs touched.
A short ficlet for the Day 9 Prompt "Wishes". Some fluff to make you smile on the last day of this horrible year :)
She learned fast, at least that was the impression Cas got, and after a while she could play little melodies already all by herself. Claire was incredibly proud of her new skill, and Cas was even prouder.
They smiled at each other in silence once again.
Next chapter coming on Tuesday (there's only 2 left! crazy how fast the time went by)
Yes, Christmas break was wonderful, and it ended way too soon.
, and you don't need to pretend you're not. After all, my boyfriend's just a normal guy. If anything, you just make this way more authentic."
One time she fell asleep on the ground leaning against Cas's legs, another time on top of one of the equipment boxes. Mostly there were some sort of couches available backstage that she crawled on to and fell asleep, and Cas was genuinely impressed with his daughter's ability to fall asleep in that situation and additionally be funnily unbothered about falling asleep at a concert and waking up the next morning in a hotel room.
"So if I kiss you tomorrow, you won't storm out on me?" He asked calmly.
He nodded understandingly. It was just a little nod, but very reassuring.
"Kitchen!" He replied and turned to Claire with a smile. "Do you hear that? We got a visitor!"
I rebuilt it, you
"Yeah, kinda," Cas smirked.
Claire, who had never been at a hotel before, immediately started running around and exploring the room before she ended up jumping on the bed. Cas let her do it, even though he never let her at home. Whatever, he though. Who knew what else had happened to that bed before.
“Jesus Christ, Dean!” he exclaimed. “What’s wrong?”
"Yeah," Cas said with a proud smile, "yeah, five. I can't believe we're that far already. It feels like yesterday when she was just a baby"
"Do you wanna talk about what's wrong?"
“Right,” I chuckled. “I was raised by my uncle, who is a priest. The religion obviously runs in the family, and growing up in that surrounding, it really was … omnipresent, I’d say”
"Going up," the elevator voice announced, and that was the first time after that kiss the both of them actually looked at each other.
When we finally arrived at our destination, Dean pulled me close into a new hot kiss already. He pushed me backwards without breaking it, pushed and pushed without ever letting go, until I felt the bed frame in the back of my knees.
"You're voluntarily staying away from the buffet?" Cas smirked.
"Dean is really nice," she said, her eyes sparkling, "and he's funny. And if he's your boyfriend, that means he's around a lot, yeah?"
"No," she answered in a shaky voice.
We didn’t even kiss as we quickly said goodnight in the hallway. “I’m sorry,” was the last thing Dean whispered before he disappeared into the darkness that was surrounding the stairwell.
But Dean, think about it for a second
It'll just be confirmation.
When Cas woke up the next morning, Dean's side of the bed was empty. At first, he was irritated, he turned around and felt the bed next to him. Cold. Then, he understood. He distinctly remembered Dean talking to him earlier that morning, he remembered Dean saying goodbye and kissing his cheek. And he remembered, sure, Dean had that thing today. Cas wasn't fully awake yet and didn't remember what exactly it was, but Dean had told him about it. He was ... somewhere, the entire day. Where was it again?
Cas gave Charlie a smile.
is a bit much. I come here from time to time, and she's been here since the very first time a couple years ago. She's always been very discreet, and even though she knew exactly who I was right the first time I walked in here, she never made a fuss about it. And she's just really nice. But we never talked much or anything"
"I see," Jo said more to herself that to Cas as she turned back to watch Dean.
And Dean dropped some notes on the desk in front of Cas and started explaining some changes he needed done in the lyrics. It was only one song, but from what Cas caught so far, they had started playing around with it during practice and now Dean was asking him to shift the chorus around and make corresponding changes to the second and third verse. Short version, he wanted him to rework the entire second half of the song.
"Fuck me," Dean breathed. And Cas did.
"You could've still written that down," Dean now smirked, "I was looking forward to getting another one of your little blue post-its"
With his thoughts still drifting off now and then, Cas now finally got into his actual work. He was almost finished with the lyrics he was currently working on. His first draft of reviewing Dean's text had been finished rather quickly, and from then on he had changed details here and there and adjusted some rhymes. He even had started thinking about the texts at random times and then hustling to scribble an idea down. That was, according to Garth, a good development - or at least something he did as well, and that was good enough to make Cas feel like he was doing a decent job.
"Uhm," Dean had replied in perplexity, "yeah. I guess."
Then, finally, a message from Dean pops up. For a second, Castiel feels like he'd pass out on the spot.
Truth was, I was rather happy about that certain distance. It made hiding easier. Maybe it was kind of lonely that way, but on a positive note, I never was close enough with anyone to have to face questions about love, about women. Things you talk about with your close in age friends. Yes, maybe I was kind of lonely, but at least there never was the risk of anyone finding out about my sexuality.
They both were eating in silence for a while, then it was Cas who spoke again.
“Mh,” Cas hummed. “So, if I was in a female vessel, would you think of me as a woman?”
"Yeah," Claire said, "because he's her boyfriend and they wanted to live together"
"No," Cas chuckled. "No, I didn't. Jo told me"
Again, Claire nodded, and now she was still sniffing still, but she had stopped crying.
"That's nice of you," Dean said, his smile getting a bit shorter, "But I really wouldn't"
being circled, and it still didn't click. You know when it finally did?"
"Thanks," Cas smiled. "Uhm, one more thing, though. The contract only said flexible work hours, so ... I mean, if I'm working as a lyricist, what do the hours look like? Because I gotta make sure I have someone to look after Claire"
“Yeah you know, you can have it,” I laughed. “I’ve had it for three years, about time someone else becomes the baby of the staff”
"Yeah," Cas chuckled. "By the way," he then said, "have you ever heard of Dean Winchester?"
Then, after Charlie and Jo had returned to their work, Dean and Cas stole a moment alone in the kitchen. They often did this. Despite their initial pretentious disgustingness thing, they tried to not be too obvious around the others now. They all knew about their relationship, of course, and they probably would have been okay with a lot, but the two of them had agreed to keep it professional at work, at least as long as others were around.
“Yeah,” I confirmed.
"So he's not ... I mean you hear that all the time, right? About celebrities who are the worst assholes you've ever met if they don't get their way for once"
"Good," Dean smiled and pulled a business card out of his pocket. "Here. Call that number. It won't be me who answers, but I'll make sure they know about you and let you through to me"
turn this into a-"
I have one regret about this story, and it is that I couldn't let Dean drive his beloved Impala. I was halfway-through describing him getting out of it when I realized ...
The elevator interrupted them with its loud
"You're influencing millions of lifes," Cas argued.
There he was, standing right in front of me in the studying area in the back of the library, his deep green eyes staring at me, a smile on his face, awaiting an answer. My notebook was still lying open in front of me, all the words associated with him and the entire poem, right there, right in front of his eyes.
"Nah, it was pretty close," Dean laughed.
"Mh," Cas made, "what number is that? 14?"
"What?" Was the only thing he managed to say in response.
“Yeah? How old are you, then?”
“No, Cas,” he said. “No matter how you try to explain it, whatever words you use to try to tell me it wasn’t my fault, it
"I think it'd be quite unfair to make me bet on that, since unlike me, you're used to the situation," Cas said. "But I'd love to hear your prediction"
"Oh did she?" Dean laughed, "Have you got my youngest fan at home?"
Dean chuckled slightly. "Well," he said, "I mean, I do love what I do. The music and stuff, that's something I've always loved, and now being able to make a living from that ... it's amazing, it really is. But everything that comes with it, you know, the attention, the interest in everything you do, the speculation and the photos and the tabloids ... I could really do without that."
“Yeah?” he breathed.
Cas buried both his hands in Dean's hair, he grabbed it hardly as he pulled Dean even closer for yet another tongue kiss.
"Yeah," he smiled. Then, he looked at Cas again. "You gonna be here tomorrow?"
"Yeah," Dean sighed. "It is. It is, and some days, I really just want to grab some people by their collar and scream right in their faces. Other days I just wanna cry about it. But at the end of the day, you know, I just sit down and remind myself that I know myself best, and I know who I am, and the people that are important to me do as well, and even though it pisses me off infinitely when I see yet another person claiming I'm straight, I can't do anything about it. What more can I do than literally saying out loud in front of a camera that I'm bi? I just ... Well, have to above it, I guess"
He didn't really want to. Sure, sometimes he missed the times when his face wasn't going around in a snippet of a picture on Twitter. Grocery shopping had become harder as well with mostly teenagers recognising him now and then, and even though they always had been respectful so far and hadn't bothered him, he still had noticed they knew who he was.
"What?" Dean chuckled, "You thought I weren't?"
with Cas? He was literally in love with him, and he was heartbroken because he thought it was unrequited?
"Good," Dean said. "Yeah, good. It's ... I mean, it's kinda weird, and I'm hella nervous, because we ... like, I thought, we've done all that before, with the kissing and the touching for the cameras, but ..."
Again, Cas only nodded.
"You're used to people randomly taking photos of you? You're used to paparazzi? I’m sorry, what?"
"But what's your favourite, though?" He asked her, as he was sure that decision would be easier for her.
"Now shoot," she said seriously. "My lips are sealed."
With shaking hands, Castiel replies.
"Don't panic," Dean whispered into his ear, "I got you. You're all good"
"Okay," Cas said calmly, "Then what's stopping you?"
She shook her head, and he could see her eyes fill with tears again.
Their way back from the restaurant led alongside the river again. The pathway was well lit in comfortable lighting provided by a row of streetlights. A solid iron fence secured the side of the pathway from the river further down, and separated from the fence by a broad walkway, there were a row of trees with some benches in between them on the other side.
it with him …
, though?"
Claire had incredibly much fun, and both Cas and Jo couldn't complain either. There was one ride that Cas took with his daughter that he immediately regretted afterwards, as the seats were obviously not designed for adults and his back was not amused at all about sitting in that weird position, but she had fun, that was pretty much worth it for Cas.
"Yeah?"
Upstairs in the studio, Cas mostly stayed off to the side a bit since Claire only had eyes for Dean and the instruments at the moment, and that was okay for him. It was actually more than okay for him, because seeing his daughter having that much fun automatically made him happy as well, and Dean did so great with her, it was just so adorable and sweet to watch.
"Mh," Cas made. "No paint, though"
Dean, who was standing there in a borrowed suit, because none of the fake-FBI ones he owned had seemed fancy enough, right next to a little fake-fountain, having a fake-smile on while maintaining a fake-friendly conversation in which neither partner seemed to really pay attention to what the other one was saying.
, the woman had said, and that word …
Both father and daughter turned towards him with a smile when Dean appeared in the doorway, and both of them greeted him with a happy "Hey"
"Well," he said, "you had us both convinced. Like, totally. So I guess, the right amount of disgusting? You'd definitely fool some paparazzi with that show you just pulled off back there"
"You're serious?" He asked. "You're not setting up a weird joke?"
“Well, now I’m here,” he smiled. “I could be some company from your generation, if you want me to”
that.
"Uhm," Dean made, and for some reason, Cas had the impression he had been blushing while answering that question. "Yeah. I've never given a single comment on those rumours, but by now it's pretty obvious, right? So I might just as well clear up on that right now and say that he's my boyfriend"
"Well, not
He pulled his face back far enough to look at me, waiting for what I had to say.
"Oh I'm sorry I'm causing her an inconvenience," Dean chuckled. "I assume then that she wasn't happy about you leaving today either?"
“Psssshhht!” an entire group reacted to Dean’s interruption all at once, causing him to look up and throw an apologising smile into the room.
They smiled at each other yet again, until after several seconds, Dean broke the comfortable silence.
"Okay," Cas smirked, "You can have that"
"Well, not writing them. Improving them, maybe. Adjusting them. Not exactly writing from the start"
"Yeah," Dean smiled, "it does"
She had been absolutely right, Dean was his type, and he did find him attractive. That of course hadn't been news to him, he had known that before she had pointed it out. Cas had known Dean was
Then later, they watched Lexie on stage give a quick speech, and after that, it was Dean's turn. Cas was left off to the side, suddenly very alone and a lot more insecure than he had been before on Dean's arm. A few words into Dean's talk, Cas noticed Lexie appearing next to him and giving him a friendly cheer-up smile.
"I see," Cas said. "One thing surprises me, though"
“Easy,” Cas said. “Any way you’re comfortable”
“Mh,” I made and took a second to look around the area. “That is a very good question”
"I see," Dean said thoughtfully. "Yeah. I try to avoid getting too deep into the comments, for that exact reason. But I don't wanna ignore people's reactions entirely, so I see some stuff now and then. But I haven't really found the perfect strategy to handle it yet."
“You know the one,” I said. “Blue cover, I always have it out on the table in the library. Have you seen it anywhere?”
"If that happens," he said calmly, "and I do anything inappropriate ... I want to make a differentiation here between two cases. If I do something that I wasn't aware of doing, like if my hands wander too far down while kissing, things like that, please talk to me about it. Because I'm gonna try my best, but maybe something like that might happen where I just don't realize what I'm doing, and in that case, please make me aware of it. In the other case ... which I could say I wouldn't ever do, but that's not the point ... if I deliberately try to make you do something that's on the no-go list, if I ever try to come too close to you, you're absolutely free, as Charlie said, to kick me in the nuts. And I mean that. Give me a solid kick, run out and tell Charlie. She may be my friend, but I can guarantee you that she takes no shit when it comes to sexual harassment. Though, I would like to add at this point that it does work vice versa and I won't hold back from kicking you in the nuts if necessary"
He glanced up to me with a grin, then wordlessly moved further down and without a warning buried his face in my still fully clothed crotch.
“Yeah,” he then said. “That does make sense. So, are you a teacher who relates as well?”
"I got no experience at all, though"
The thing is, Dean isn't Castiel's boyfriend. Castiel for sure wants him to be, no doubt of that. He has been sure about that for a while now. After now more than 3 years of knowing Dean, he has admitted to his feelings. Well, silently. In secret. Not to Dean, and certainly not to anyone else.
“No,” I said and couldn’t hold back a hint of a smile. “He won’t make us break up. It’s okay, Dean. He’ll keep our secret, as long as we do as well”
Cas leaned in as well to see that he wasn't in it, and he showed the two girls a quick smile as Dean said "thank you"
Just like Dean, I did show up for mass slightly tired and not fully listening to the sermon, my mind still hanging in some of the rather sinful thoughts I had had about Dean the night before. Sadly enough, that would become a habit as well.
the damn money. And if that meant holding some celeb's hand in public, so be it. And he knew Dean seemed like a decent guy, at least he had given him the impression today, he had been very sweet to Claire, and Cas just thought he seemed nice. Nice enough to trust him and just give this a try.
That conversation was yet another thing Dean and Cas didn't mention again. Though this time it didn't give Cas the impression that Dean was avoiding to talk about it, it seemed to be more like there was nothing left to say. Dean had shared all that with him, he really wouldn’t have had to, but he chose to tell Cas about his struggles. He trusted him enough to share this personal trouble with him, and that was another thing for Cas to think about.
“Okay,” he chuckled. “We’d have to stop for food now and then”
"Oh," the man made. "Yeah. Sure" And he took off the sunglasses and clipped them to the neck of his shirt instead.
“Yeah,” Cas only breathed with a smile.
"Not at all," Dean smiled, "that's totally fine. It's not for anything unpleasant, though?"
"Nothing to thank me for," he said. "I found it in the library. It was just sitting there on the table, open for anyone who might want to have a peek inside. Even if you're neglecting your possessions, maybe you should be more careful about your secrets."
Cas replied with a soft smile at Dean, and just a second later, he felt Dean's hand on his cheek, his thumb softly stroking his skin before it laid still and held his face in place as Dean leaned in.
"Oh I hate you so much right now," she said quietly.
"Well, there's those rumours. And my PR team and I, we've talked a lot about what to do about it. I mean I know I don't have to prove shit to anyone, but as a person of public interest I just don’t need rumours like that. Now I of course could make statements and give interviews and all that, but I doubt that would really change people's minds. Easiest would be for me to openly date a man. The thing is, I'm not looking for any relationship at the moment. Focusing on my work for now, you know. So, we've talked about hiring someone to, well ..."
Suddenly, Cas felt Dean's lips on his naked skin, on his sides, his belly, anywhere Dean could reach in that position.
Cas sighed. He had in fact asked himself the same question, was that a normal thing? Or was it rather one of those just-a-bit-too-close moments? He wasn't quite sure about that himself, but what he knew was that he definitely wasn't in the mood for discussing that topic right now.
"Yeah," Dean said. For a moment, both of them were quiet. "We, uhm ..." Dean then started, "we haven't even kissed yet. I mean, for real. As a couple."
"Yeah," he smirked. "I knew him already when you told me how hot he is"
Cas could've facepalmed himself that moment. So, he was an idiot. He was an absolute idiot, and his best friend had been right all along, with everything, with every little detail she had suspected.
do it. Two, if the thing that’s holding you back is the idea of having to be a man … you don’t have to. You know that, right?”
And as he asked that question, mimicking Cas’s whispery voice, even though he didn’t understand why, he did hear it. Footsteps. Not anything supernatural, and definitely not the ghosts they were here for. Just normal, human footsteps coming up the stairs.
I closed my notebook and moved it off to the side to bring my attention back to the stack of essays that was still waiting there, silently judging me and my crush that, admittedly, maybe started to get slightly out of hand.
"Yeah," Charlie said, "That's the basics. Any more questions?"
," Claire said.
Attached was a photo from this afternoon, Dean and Cas both crouching down there on the ground, Cas with Claire pressed against his chest, only visible in profile. Dean was there right next to him, looking directly in the camera's direction. Claire's face wasn't visible at all, it was clear that Cas was holding a child in the picture, and her blonde hair stood out from his dark jacket, but her face wasn't visible, and in that moment, Cas was really grateful for Dean warning him.
After breakfast, we went right into the campus tour. Starting from the dining hall I showed him around the communal areas for the students, the tract with the dorm rooms in it, the offices and classrooms until we ended up in the inner courtyard.
"Yeah?" Cas asked with what was barely more than a whisper. Was this … Did that mean that Dean considered them … yeah, what? Friends? Something else? Definitely something closer than just colleagues, but Cas was thinking,
“I gotta be one of the two,” Dean breathed.
At first, they experimented a bit with holding hands, they were just there walking up and down the corridor, holding hands, and after a while, it started feeling almost natural. At some point, Cas looked over to Dean, and as their eyes met, both formed a little smile. It was alright.
"Hey!" Cas protested with a slight chuckle that made Dean smirk and Claire laugh. She finally agreed to let Dean help her father for that one round, and as it turned out her concerns were unreason, since even with Dean's help, Cas lost that round again.
No, Dean is fine with it, and he and Cas have talked about it, about Cas’s doubts concerning his sexuality and his realization that maybe he’s just not straight. They have talked about it, and Dean has really tried his best to be helpful, as good as that was possible with that insane and weird feeling sitting there in his chest, refusing to leave.
and I don’t think I tell you enough
Cas had informed Garth about their new - admittedly, intense - task, and both of them started working hard on it in order to finish the lyrics by the time Dean would come back. They did consult Ed and Harry twice, and they actually managed to agree on a final draft the day before Dean's planned return.
"Yeah," Dean said. "So, about that tour. Charlie and me were talking, and we need your opinion on something before we make further plans"
Immediately, the pair of tear-stained little eyes moved to meet her father's.
“You’re not from around the area, then?”
"Yeah?" She asked. "What does he do?"
Jo stared at him for a second.
"Friends?"
feeling, though?"
"I mean, I do like ice cream," Dean shrugged, "it works kind of like a magnet for me. At least it's not
"Absolutely," the elder lady confirmed with a smile.
"I wanted to make it clear that this agreement doesn't put you in an inferior position to Dean and if he comes too close to you, you don't have to take shit from him," she explained to Cas. "Which does not mean that I think he would do anything like that. But I want you to know that you don't have to do everything"
"Mh," Cas made. "I don't know"
"Well, actually," Dean started and reached for Cas's hand, "it's not so fake anymore"
“I want to be doing that all the time,” he breathed, barely loud enough to hear it. “Just never stop. No more teaching, nothing. Just kissing you forever”
"Well," Cas chuckled, "that's a matter of definition. She has no idea who you are, so she can't exactly be a fan. But on the other hand, you're the funny ice cream man who taught her how to make music, and she indeed seems to be a big fan of you in that context"
“Another round?” he asked.
"Yeah, I said it sounds weird," he said. "This basically means two things. One, things you can say and comments you can make. If asked about our sex life - and yes that may happen, some interviewers got no shame at all - you're gonna give an answer that does in some way imply we have regular intercourse. That doesn't mean you have to make up any detailed stories or something, literally just saying
"Are you out of your mind?! Of course we're gonna talk about the other thing!"
They had a great time at that first show. Jo loved it, and Claire, even if she didn't exactly understand why there were so many people around and why she wasn't allowed to walk any closer to Dean, loved it even more.
They liked me back. Absolutely insane.
"Smile and look good," Charlie explained. "Dean will have to do some talking, and you don't have to be on stage with him, but down in the room, stay by his side, do your disgustingly cute little hand holding waist grip thing. Maybe, if you can't avoid it, engage in some conversation. But Dean won't leave you faced with anything on your own"
"Well," Cas said, "it's also that I wouldn't really have a lot to do. I get to travel for about a month all through the country and see all the shows and get to visit all those new places, and all I have to do for it is some pretend hand holding with Dean. That's not a bad deal."
"I see," Dean chuckled. "Cas listen, I'm really sorry to ask this while you're on a break, but I kinda need you"
Cas let out a quiet sigh.
The line was quiet.
"Yeah," Cas said, "she's got a lot of energy currently"
Even though, he also thought, it was kind of ironic to have a musician as successful as Dean be this event’s celebrity face and not utilize any of his music at all.
"Babe, do you know where we put the lights?" Dean asked.
back.
She dropped a magazine down at the table in front of him.
"Right," Cas agreed.
The thought scared me. Well, to be exact, not the thought of doing it, of having this. What scared me was, knowing that, if we really were to do it, we had to be extremely careful. Knowing that there would be consequences if anyone would find out. Knowing that, if anyone, only one single person, found out about that, we would both lose our jobs, our reputation.
“What’s wrong?” Dean asked from the couch.
Cas only saw Dean again late that day. That television meeting thing had taken quite a while apparently, because Cas and Claire had had dinner without him already and were now sitting together at a game of connect four at the living room coffee table.
"Yeah," Cas sighed. "Well, not exactly. I like the job, I really do. But the ... you know, the pretend boyfriend thing. It was weird enough already without my photo being on title pages of the all the tabloids, and now I just feel like everybody's staring at me all the time. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but it's driving me crazy"
There I sat, making myself nervous with all those thoughts while pretending to work on an essay. Had I calmed down just a bit, though, and looked up one more time instead of driving myself insane with the questions, I would have noticed that Dean himself was trying to hide a faint blush on his cheeks by leaning down closer into his book.
"What, you mean what's my job?", Cas chuckled.
he replied.
I quietly looked at him for a second.
“Don’t say that,” I said softly.
“I’d say I am, yeah,” I chuckled. “Though, I probably relate to a different kind of teenagers than you do”
“Here we are,” I said as we stopped right in front of the door. “I’ll leave you to it, then”
"I'm sorry," Cas said quietly.
“My back does
Dean seemed to notice Cas's confusion, and immediately cleared it up.
Cas had nodded at what Dean had said, and now he looked at him again.
“Dean,” I started, “I understand that you’re worried. I really do, who would I be to tell you to not worry about it when I’ve been lying awake the whole night panicking about the exact same thing. And I see why you feel guilty. I don’t
I eyed him for a second. He really seemed concerned, and to be honest, even the simple fact that he was here at the chapel right now proved that he was concerned about me.
would hear them and just make it a bit easier for me, give me the strength and the courage to overcome them.
“I’ll be in the library,” I said. I spent most of my free time in the library. Well, to be exact, I spent most of my work time in the library as well, at least when I wasn’t teaching. I did have an office of course, all the teachers had a guaranteed office space, but mine was a shared office with another colleague from the English department, and even though we did get along quite well it was simply impossible for us to work in one room. This issue may have been due to his habit of mumbling to himself while grading and me being overly sensitive about any kind of noise when trying to concentrate, or maybe it was only because I simply preferred the atmosphere of the library (No, it was definitely about his mumbling). In any case, the result was me working in the library most of the time.
“I don’t know,” he shrugged. “It’s just … I think that maybe I get too close to those kids. In the sense that I worry too much. See them struggling with their teenage problems and maybe relate too much, you know?”
"Hey," he said, "is anyone hurt? Can I help?"
"Ask you," she said.
Cas only stared back at Dean, panting as well. He didn't know what to say. There was only one thing on his mind, and that was exactly what Dean had said just now.
When he was finished with that, Claire had indeed calmed down significantly and didn't protest at all when her father tucked her in and kissed her goodnight.
"I really wasn't," Cas said calmly. "You don't have to sign it. Your decision. But if you don't, I can't tell you"
"That's right of course," Dean said, "but you called, that's a first step to be happy about, and also, can't I generally like talking to you, no matter what your answer is?"
"Yeah," Cas smiled, looking right back into Dean's eyes. "Sometimes a late, honest apology is better than an immediate one that you don't really mean"
“Yeah,” I said. “He knows. It was him who saw us last night. But I won’t lose my job because of it, and neither will you”
Sam chuckled with him. "But you know, I think the important thing is that you've talked, no matter why. You've cleared it up, and I mean I've only seen you together for like half a day, but I got the impression you're happy. Both of you. Plus, your kid, she seems happy as well"
Maybe, if he told Dean right now that he couldn't do it, maybe they wouldn't be too disappointed in him. Maybe, if he'd stop this right now, there wouldn't be too much damage done.
? What they wanted was pictures of their pretend relationship, staged photos where Dean was in control. Though this one ...
Cas took the card and eyed it for a second, twisted it in between his fingers, then glanced up to meet Dean's eyes again.
“I want to see you in my office. 20 minutes,” was all he said before he turned and disappeared into the crowd of students flocking out of the chapel.
"Yeah," Cas sighed. "Guess you're right. I just ... doesn't matter. I'm overthinking"
They were looking right into each other's eyes again. Just a second, intense eye contact, and those smiles. Two seconds, three, and they both leaned into a kiss.
how can it be
“Sure, it’s not like everyone would make fun of me. Sam first of all”
Even though I was still fully dressed from the waist down, the feeling of his mouth on me was incredible. I could feel his hot breath on me through the fabric, and it made my hard penis twitch up against my pants.
Silence fell over them again. Still an uncomfortable one, but this time they were looking at each other.
Cas took off the headphones and handed the entire combo back to Charlie. He didn't say anything, but his eyes quietly met Dean's, and he gave him a soft smile. He would've loved to talk about it right now, to say that he was sorry about holding back, about avoiding the conversation, that he never meant to hurt him, just anything. But that wasn't a conversation to have on the bus with Charlie right there, it just wasn't.
"Is he good, then?"
"Are they?" Dean returned the question. "I don't know, Cas. You're raising an amazing little girl all on your own. I'm just ... singing."
“You were smiling,” Dean explained, “What were you thinking about?”
"Can I tell anyone that I'm not actually dating you?"
ask you to actually do it. Then, as we said earlier, touching intimate areas of your body. I can't do that, and if I do, you are totally allowed to call me out on it. Furthermore, I can't ask you to undress any further than appropriate for the situation - translation, I can't ask you to get naked for me. All of that, is that all clear to you, understood and accepted?"
“Yeah?” came his panted answer.
“Oh,” he made softly, “Did you like it?”
Every time Cas looked at him, he thought, despite his age, he was still the same man. Still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.
The week after that one was pretty much the exact same. There were more lyric meetings, more practice sessions, and even though Cas saw Dean a lot those days, he never actually found himself alone with him.
Yes, Dean has been there. Dean has yelled at his best friend for no reason, Dean has blamed his best friend for various bad things happening in his life, and still, his best friend is always there.
Dean seemed to notice that, so he gave Cas a soft smile.
"I've already read it twice," Cas replied with a smile. "It's perfect as it is. Stop worrying, and just do it. It'll be fine"
"Sue me," he chuckled.
Monday started just like every other day the previous week had, with one little difference. When Cas dropped Claire off at Missouri's, she wished him fun at work, and this time she meant it, knowing that he was going to see Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean's answer was a heartfelt smile and a soft "see you then, Cas" before he disappeared into the hallway.
“I mean, I just …” Dean started talking again, “The entire thing about trying to make your father proud but just never being enough … I just know how that feels. And I have the impression that there are quite a few boys here whose fathers have some unrealistic expectations for their sons’ future.”
“I’m not sure,” he finally said. “I mean, at the first look, maybe. But it’d still be the same you, and I know you, and the Cas that I know is … is a man”
Dean’s face went pale. “What?” he breathed.
Castiel stares at the message, trying to pick up the tone. Is Dean angry? Is he taking it as a joke? He can't tell, no matter how hard he tries.
And as he was nervously looking into Dean's eyes, losing himself in them, and as his mind and entire body were freaking out over Dean and the kiss, there was a tiny little part of his mind remaining reasonable, and this tiny little part was only just now realizing that probably agreeing to this job offer had been a big, a very very big mistake.
"Yeah," Jo sighed. "The internet's all over it, doesn't matter. Not to me, at least. I'm just worried about my oldest friend"
"Good," Jo said, "I'm glad"
"That's the spirit," Dean grinned.
Cas looked right back into Dean's eyes for a moment, then he nodded silently.
"Understandably," Charlie said. "I totally get that you're nervous. Heck, I'm nervous and I'm not even physically involved. That's totally valid, Cas. But I know you got it. Just relax and don't pressure yourself that much"
“But I started it,” Dean now said with an intense look into my eyes. He was tearing up now, it was only a bit but still visible to me. His eyes were starting to get wet as he talked to me. “I started this yesterday, and I started it all, a couple of weeks ago. It was me, Cas. It’s all on me.”
“How did you end up here, then?” I asked. Two states over, for a substitute job as a P.E. teacher that was planned to last for only a few months, that seemed somewhat unreasonable to me.
“Dean,” I said his name in a calm voice, as calm as possible given my rising panic. “Don’t apologize for it. It’s not just your fault. I should have stopped you, but I didn’t. It’s just as much my fault.”
"Does he ...?"
"Yeah," Dean sighed, "I'm aware. Your kid's face isn't visible, though"
“How the fuck am I supposed to- Did you see the gymnastics I’m doing here? It’s literally impossible-“
Come over.
He could see Jo's eyes widen.
He was still thinking about it when Dean came in to ask him if he'd made a decision, and after one more thoughtful look at Dean, Cas told him that yes, he had made a decision, and yes, him and Claire would join the tour.
"Seriously?" Cas asked, and he couldn't hold back a little smirk. Dean had pretended to be so cool and relaxed about everything, he really hadn't expected him to admit he was nervous.
Cas looked at him for a moment, then looked at his daughter who was giving him a begging look, then he said "okay"
That fake dinner date had made him weak, he knew that. He had felt so good, so comfortable around Dean, he had felt so good holding his hand and looking into his eyes the entire time. Too good, maybe. Too comfortable.
Though he doesn’t say it out loud, of course. She hums.
“Or, maybe you’ll realize what an idiot you’re being, and you’ll let me help you.” Cas returns.
Dean wonders.
This movie ends without incident. Cas did fall asleep again, but not until the last twenty minutes. He fought it for a while, it was actually a little amusing to Dean. Seeing Cas curled up hugging a pillow, eyes glued to the screen, forced open out of pure stubbornness. Dean slinks under his covers.
Sunday Night:
“Yes.” Cas answers, rubbing his eyes. Dean leans forward, the mug in his hands scraping against the table as he does so. He looks concerned, his brow furrowed.
“Sam-”
“Want to try?” He tips his cone to Dean. Dean laughs, thinking he’s joking at first. Then he realizes Cas is 100% serious.
“Wee!” Jack laughs. Dean offers an awkward chuckle.
“Crazy 8’s.”
. Not just any random “boy” as if he was in the seventh grade and just found himself kissing boys. Dean’s never done that. If he had, boy John would have ripped him a new one.
. It’s
“What’s it for?” Dean asks, now taking the phone and scrolling through all the pictures of people laughing, different multicolored pieces of art, and the word “love” painted on signs. Charlie beams, and Dean comes across a picture of two girls kissing, holding up a sign that says “love is love” with a rainbow heart as the “o” in “love”.
She purses her lips, but releases her child, who runs to the slide where Jack is. She doesn’t look away from Dean. Cas must have noticed something shift, because he looks to Dean, no longer focused on the phone.
“Thank you.” Cas takes the pillow from him. It’s finally quiet. After a few moments Dean feels himself about to drift off, when the bed shuffles. Cas is scooting down, so he’s curled up at the foot of Dean’s bed, so as not to disturb him. Dean rolls his eyes. Cas is the most stubborn being on the frickin planet.
“Huh.” He chuckles. “I tell you, man, you could teach philosophy. Ever think about that? Getting a job as a professor at a college or something? Get a degree in it, teach it to others?” Cas lets out a light laugh.
“And a game for those who don’t have anyone else to play with.”  Sam teases. Dean glares at Sam before returning to his cards, realizing he has reached the end of his deck, losing the game.
“Nah. Who told you biting ice cream was psychopathic behavior?” Dean asks.
away. And you always give up on things before trying. You never give yourself the benefit of the doubt. I’ve never seen you do that. Not once. Throughout all the years, I’ve seen you fight vampires, ghosts, even God! And you always come out on top. But you know the one monster you’re never willing to face? Your own demons.” Sam stands, “You’ve spent so many years helping me through my crap, Dean. And you know what? It’s my turn. I’m not gonna sit here and pretend there’s not something eating at you. For once, we don’t have something to fight, or save, or kill. We can deal with this stuff now. So please, Dean, let me
“Chocolate raspberry truffle.” Dean answers, trying Cas’s cone.
“Like what?” Dean thinks hard about how to answer this one.
It then lists off four answer boxes.
“Jack caught a butterfly.” Cas explains. Dean peers into the glass jar, and sure enough, there’s a small, brown butterfly opening and shutting its wings.
. Dean wasn’t prepared for that. It’s silent for a moment, and though she says nothing, Dean knows Charlie too well. He decides he’s already dug himself into a hole, why not jump into it? He’s just going to pretend this whole conversation never happened anyway.
No. Dean won’t lie to himself, that was the promise he made Sam about finding what he wants. Dean must be 100% honest with himself.
than a best friend?” Dean feels like a fourth grader talking to Charlie in code like this. But what else is he supposed to say?
“I could ask you the same.” Sam answers.
“It’s basically where I get paid to hack into their software, networks, and databases to show them where their weak spots are.” She says. Cas and Jack enter from downstairs, Jack sets a jar on the table.
“Hey, Buddy. Good morning.” Dean manages, ruffling his hand through Jack’s hair. Jack peels away, and grabs Dean’s hand dragging him into the kitchen.
“Thanks.” Charlie says, visibly more relaxed.
“We have strawberry in our garden!” He says. Cas nods.
“Mmhmm.”
“Jack?” Jack waddled over, falling onto Cas’s leg, giggling.
Dean waits until he hears everyone upstairs to leave his room again. Nothing will happen between Cas and Dean when everyone’s there. So, Dean decides to make an appearance to convince them all that there’s nothing out of the normal that’s bugging him. It seems to work. Sam offers that Dean join them for the fireworks, and Dean repeats his earlier excuse of working in the yard, tacking on the extra fact that someone should stay and watch Jack. They all leave shortly after, leaving Dean and Jack alone in the house.
Dean startles to another nightmare, turning to make sure he didn’t wake Cas, just to find that he isn’t there. Right. Of course he isn’t there. And Dean doesn’t admit to himself that he wishes he was. Here he is, sulking in his room like some emo teen. He forces himself out of his room, to avoid raising suspicion. He’s almost immediately greeted by a very high-energy toddler, who wraps around his legs like a kid on a coconut tree.
“Dean, I know you. Sometimes… I don’t know, you just like to keep things to yourself. And you do that until it tears you apart, but this…” she pauses, finding the right words. “Just… I want you to know you’re not alone. No matter what happens.” He purses his lips. Charlie really is the sister he never knew he needed.
After Dean emerges from his shower, he heads to the kitchen. Today is the perfect day to make sun tea. Especially since Sam is gone and can’t make fun of him for it. Dean learned from one of Bobby’s friends. Another hunter who was passing through while Sam and Dean were staying with him. Her name was Vanessa. Dean couldn’t have been older than nine or ten. He saw her placing the pitcher of tea outside and he asked why. She explained to him that “sun tea” was the best tea ever. Showed him how she made it, and let him try some when they had dinner, which Bobby helped her cook. Dean still remembers to this day thinking that was the best sweet tea he ever had. Jack waddles in as Dean’s finished filling up a pitcher with water.
“Well, yes, Dean, I think things are definitely going to be different.”
“Yeah, it’s just a small cut.” He answers.
“I guess.” Cas lets out a little chuckle.
“Sure.” Jack springs to life, darting for the sandbox. Dean chuckles.
“What was that, seven?” Sam asks. “So the storm should be seven miles away.” He pulls out his phone, looking it up. “Okay, so apparently it’s every five seconds, which means that this storm is just under two miles away.” Sam explains.
“What a nice surprise!” Cas says, bouncing the half-asleep toddler on his hip.
“Because I found him when I came back from the empty.”
“Liar. You do too need sleep, your grace is still fading. And you don’t need to lose it on my account. It makes me feel… I dunno. Bad.” Dean watches a smirk crawl across Cas’s face.
“Now you go home. You’ve done enough. Once again, the world is saved. And soon, humanity will be too.” She looked at Jack, who was playing peek-a-boo with Sam. Dean handed Sam the keys to the Impala.
“Dude. You conked out halfway through the last one. We don’t have to watch the next one if you’re already tired.”
“And if I don’t?” Dean asks.
“Maybe a little older than that.” Cas says.
“Okay. Okay.” Dean says, taking his seat once more. He feels like a child for losing it like that. But Sam is right. He hates to admit it, but he is.
“Well tea is just a bunch of dried out plants. Like peppermint tea is from peppermint leaves. And chamomile tea, the one that makes you sleepy, is from a chamomile plant.” Jack’s eyes grow in wonder.
“Eh, that faster I get it done, the less I’ll have to work on it in the future. Right, Jack?”
“I’m confused… I… did I… is this not what you want?” Cas asks. Dean feels his face burn.
“No.”
“Sure, he’s my best friend. He’s family.” Charlie lets out an awkward chuckle.
“Whatever.” Dean replies. Cas hits his head on the bed frame trying to get under the blanket, sending a loud
- internalized homophobia
“They started a couple weeks ago.” Dean admits. There’s a pause. “My nightmares, I mean.”
“I help!” He says.
“But he’s back now. Jack brought Cas back.” Sam reminds him, as if Dean was somehow oblivious to the fact.
Dean wakes, wrestling his blanket. Another nightmare. Dean leaps out of bed, tossing open his door. He marches into the dining room and grabs his jacket from the chair. He slings it on, throws on his shoes, and climbs the stairs. He grabs the keys from the hook, yanking open the bunker door, disappearing into the night.
“That was a mistake, Cas! That’s it! it was never supposed to happen. I was tired, and… and a wreck, I wasn’t thinking. It was just a mistake. Nothing more.”
“Look what I drew!” He says, pointing at another colorful page on the fridge. It’s covered top to bottom with rainbows. This time, they have small blue scribbles on the sides for clouds.
“Yeah. Do you remember what you told me to get me out of there? You turned it into a game.” Sam says.
“Drink plenty of water. I read an article about heat stroke yesterday and Kansas gets really hot this time of year.” Dean lets out a light chuckle.
“So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye?!” He shouts into the fake mic, making exaggerated expressions into the mirror at Jack, who is laughing so hard, his face is turning red. He turns the mic to Cas, who reluctantly sings along.
“Dean,”
“Hey.” Dean stalks over to the coffee machine, pressing the buttons. “Cas and I are gonna take Jack to the park today, if you want to come.”
“How?” Dean scoffs, a scowl on his face.
“Nah, I’m just making some lunch, you hungry Jack?” He asks the toddler. Jack nods his head yes.
Dean sits for a minute, the realization of what he’s just admitted creeping into him. He needs to do something. Forget all about this. He decides the best idea would be to work on the sprinkler system in the garden, but when he swings open his door and steps out, he nearly body slams into Cas on his way down the hall. For a second, neither of them say anything. But after a moment, Cas’s brows knit in worry.
“That doesn’t mean they’re your fault.”
Dean is almost amused when he clicks on the link, but his curiosity has taken the best of him. The screen loads, and he clicks the “
“Woah, wait. What’s wrong?” Dean blinks.
He opens the book so that the cover and title are face-down on the table. Usually, he would tilt the book up to him so he could read without lurching over the table, but he doesn’t want anyone reading the title. So he hunches over the book, scooting his chair as close to the table as he can. He looks at the table of contents.
“Because I’m scared. I’m so
“Whatever. I’m too tired for this crap.” A grin slides across Cas’s face. Dean ignores it, hugging his own pillow to his head.
“So what? You hate Dad?” Dean asks, indignant.
“Well, because it’s not normal.”
“Ugh, I don’t know. I think it went okay, I was super super nervous though. And a lot awkward.” She explains.
“Yeah, no problem.” He says. “Now when can we dig into this delicious stew?!” He asks. Charlie opens the pot, stirring it.
” Dean breathes. But Dean finds himself just standing there, unmoving. almost melting into it. He shuts his eyes. But Cas doesn’t kiss him. Instead, he swiftly backs away. Dean’s eyes fly open, and he watches Cas’s heart shatter.
to be human we just are. We just exist, that’s it. We- we try to make sense of it all, find some huge meaning for everything- some purpose, but the truth is, Cas, there isn’t one. In fact, I think you’re already part human.” Dean says, encouragingly.
“Dean, I’m not following.”
“Just wait and see.” He goes down to help Jack carry up the pitcher, grabbing a rag on the way down. When they return, Dean sets it on the table, the rag covering it, so Cas can’t see it.
“Cas? You good, buddy?” He asks. Cas turns his head to look at Dean.
“What, you weren’t before?” Sam asked.
“Dean,”
“Well then why don’t you see if you can find out?”
“Dee! Dee! Look!” He tugs on Dean’s shirt, dragging him toward the table.
He clicks on the tab, reading the description.
“Sorry, I probably should stop that, huh?” Dean asks.
Dean finds no matter how much time he spends toiling in the Kansas heat, twisting the knobs on the sprinkler, making adjustments to the hose, burying the pipes, he can’t escape his thoughts. His harsh words bounce around his brain, echoing in his mind. No words haunt him more, however, than those that Cas told him. Mostly because he was right. Dean was sending mixed signals. But what else was he supposed to do? Dean doesn’t know what the hell he wants anymore. Everything just confuses him. He feels like some kid again, burdened by the questions of life and the problems of the world at far too of an age to actually understand or fix them. Until he was old enough. Until John started bringing him along on hunts. Dean screws the last sprinkler head into the pipe. He walks over to the hose, double checking that it’s secured to the spicket. He wants to avoid another water-spraying-directly-at-his-face incident. He hesitantly cranks the knob on the spicket. He turns, watching as the water shoots from the sprinklers, raining down on the flowers and vegetable garden. He grins, shutting it off.
“That demon
“I got it.” Cas says, approaching the swing. Dean walks Miracle over to a bench, and shockingly enough, Miracle sits without fighting him. Dean pulls out his phone to start recording Jack’s first time on a swing. Someday, after they move on, Dean will be glad to have it as a memento.
“What? What do you mean?” Dean asks, a hint of warning in his voice.
“And you?” Dean asks, expectantly.
“Jashabananaahi for me, for me, for meeeee!” Jack songs along. Dean slaps the wheel as the beat drops, hitting air drums with imaginary drum sticks.
to be on that forest bench… with Cas-
“I suppose this does make me his father.” Cas added.
“You don’t remember?” Dean nods no. “I think you said ‘woah dude, your eyes are, like, really blue.’ or something like that.” Charlie answers.
“Uh, yeah. You’re right, Jack. I’ll stop crying now.” Dean nodded, feigning a serious tone.
“That’s not how I see it.” Cas says. Dean doesn’t realize that Cas isn’t used to sleeping. Cas values these talks, he thinks they are a fine replacement for the time he used to spend watching over Dean, protecting him.
me to help you raise him?” That sounds a lot more stupid of an idea when Dean says it like that.
“Whatcha making?” He asks, curious.
“Are you alright?”
“What happened to ignoring it?” Cas asks, giving Dean a look.
“Okay.” Dean smiles.
“Sometimes, Jack, when I would have to eat a food I didn’t like, I would sprinkle some salt on there. That usually helps.” Dean offers.
“Just let me finish.” Dean sits on the edge of Cas’s bed. “Recently, I’ve been working through a lot of heavy crap. And I’m sorry that I’ve been taking it out on you. You didn’t deserve that, it’s not fair.” Cas crosses his arms, leaning against his dresser. Dean takes in a breath. “I think…” he feels his blood run cold. “I think I might be… bisexual.” His guts twists on itself. He doesn’t dare lift his eyes from where they are currently fixed on the carpet. Dean feels the mattress shift as Cas sits next to him. It startles him, he whips to face Cas, who no longer seems closed off or annoyed. Dean continues, filling the silence with more rambling. He returns his gaze to the floor. “And it was… hard for me to accept it- it still is, really. But that’s no excuse, I shouldn’t have… well I shouldn’t have done half of the things I’ve done, or said half of the things I said, really.” He meets Cas’s eyes again. “I hurt you. I realize that. And I know there’s no way to make up for it. And I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, Cas.” He feels tears sting his eyes, so he takes a deep breath, rising. “Anyway,” he clears his throat. “I just… you needed to know, you deserved to know that you’re not crazy, and none of this is your fault, it’s on me. It’s all on me, Cas. And I promise to try my best to fully communicate how I feel, from now on.” Dean heads for the door.
Cas was awake. Cas never went to sleep. The constant flow of tears down his face had overwhelmed him. He’s never had to deal with this before. He’s been upset, but it was never this heavy. This… deflating. He hugs his pillow close to his chest, squeezing his eyes shut, hoping that will somehow dampen the wells inside him, beckoning for the streams of tears to trail down his cheeks. But it brings no relief. This pillow isn’t as comfortable as the one he’s gotten used to resting on in Dean’s bed. It’s not as soft, or welcoming warm. Cas isn’t frustrated by the lack of sleep as much as he is by the lack of guidance. Of direction. He’s spent hours racking his brain for a way out of this, but knows it’s only up to Dean now. Still, he finds his brain refuses to wind down, or forget about the events that took place a few hours before. So Cas turns on his side, staring at the wall in front of him, stuck in between action and inaction. Thought and after thought. Wondering if Dean ever meant any of the things he told Cas before it all erupted into ruin.
“Human?” Dean asks.
“Because I know I’m new to human emotions, but I thought… I thought sometimes you would say something, or do something. And I thought, maybe you wanted something more. I thought you meant it.” Dean’s face falls.
“Would you let him raise Jack?” Sam asks. Dean is taken aback by this question. He scrambles for an answer.
“Am I crazy?”
“Yes- no, no. I just…” Dean takes a breath, trying to organize his thoughts. He says the only thing he can, the thing he knows Cas needs to hear. “You’re not crazy.” Dean forces himself to meet Cas’s eyes. Cas returns his gaze, his stormy eyes piercing into Dean. He swings open his door, much to Dean’s shock. But Dean steps in. “You’re right. I’ve been a dick. I was… I don’t know what I was doing. But you’re right. I should have made it clear how I was feeling.” Cas shuts the door behind him.
Cas himself was definitely perplexed by Dean's unexpected hug, but he quickly adjusted to it and put his arms around Dean as well, holding him close just for that moment with a happy smile.
“What is it, then?” Dean asked. “The thing that scares you?”
"Yeah," Dean said with a smile. "You should bring her again. In a while, when we're finished with all the album stress. She really seemed to have a great time the last time she was here"
a chance.
“So?” he grinned at me. “There’s nothing wrong with making it quick”
was close,” Dean breathed.
"Well I don't know," she chuckled, "you've had an album release and multiple sold out shows tonight, maybe that sparks some positivity?"
"You know what?" He then said with another smile. "Keep it"
He didn't say anything as he sat back down, but Dean looked up as he felt the cushions moving.
"Mh," Dean shrugged with a cheeky grin, "so you're an old man as well"
“September,” I grinned. “So, it may only be 4 months, but you’re still the baby of the staff”
“That was never intended to be subtle,” Dean said. “You didn’t react to the subtle things, so I decided to give something else a try”
“Here,” he said excitedly, pointing at the tray of cookies he had prepared.
"Not much," Cas said. "Nothing, basically. Only that you're there as well. That elevated her opinion of it by a lot, by the way. She actually got kinda jealous when she heard that"
"You've met Dean?" Missouri asked, "that one?"
“Yeah,” he said.
Since Dean showed no signs of planning to get up, Cas awkwardly walked over to him.
"Uhm ..." Cas thought out loudly while still holding the mistletoe in place, "They're in one of the boxes in the hallway. The smaller one, I think."
He wasn't entirely sure what he felt as he read that, but his immediate reaction was thinking
"Mh," Dean made, "yeah, maybe. It's not really a writer's block, it's just ... just a little barricade, I think. I'll come by later and you can have a look at it"
"Please," Dean added, "screw that stupid contract. God, Cas, I want you so bad"
Charlie greeted him with a smile as he arrived next to her.
“Okay,” he then breathed, and before I got the chance to say anything else, he had closed my mouth with a kiss already.
"Great," Dean made. He didn't look at Charlie, though. He was looking at Cas.
"Yeah," he said. Well, not right now, not at 6 in the morning. "You're gonna have to wait a bit, though. It's really early. But I'll get you some medication later, that will make it better"
"Usually, and around?" Jo chuckled. "He's here every morning at point 9 o'clock am, and you can literally set an alarm for that. Which is weird to me, honestly, because he's not a very punctual person. But I guess he just really loves spending as much time as possible here"
They smiled at each other for just a second before Cas took his chance.
"Yeah," Cas smiled. "My favourite part is when you smile at me during that one song"
Okay, Cas thought, trying to calm himself down just a bit. Okay, this was happening. This really was happening. He was about to do this with Dean, and he was so going to make it unforgettable for both of them.
Dean only smiled at him in response. Only a second later, the young employee came back into the room, placing a bag on the counter.
"No," Cas said, "no, I ... It just was that I hadn't really thought about that before. I mean you told me about the rumours, but I didn't really think about the situation that much. And then I read that comment, and I realized that you've been out for quite a while, and people knew that and simply chose to ignore that. Or rather, they chose to invalidate your own stance on your sexuality and decided that they know better. That's ..."
Cas listened to the other man’s heartbeat for a second, taking in every single beat through his chest.
"I get that," she said. "But then, don't you think Dean does as well? I'm pretty sure if he offers you to bring her along, he's aware that she's a child and needs a safe calm space now and then?"
Dean didn't move from the bed. "Yeah," he sighed.
A follow-up for Chapter 1 (Day 2)
squishing in a quick comment at the beginning this time to put a little smut warning (I guess?) It's not really explicit but if you wanna skip it, go to the * :)
"No," Cas chuckled. "No way to sugarcoat that. She won three rounds, and she's gonna win this one as well, that's just the ugly truth I have to face"
Days went by, and then, they reached California, L.A. to be exact. They would be playing two shows at one venue, two nights in a row, due to the high demand, and now that Claire was back to her full energy again, Cas made good use of the time taking her sightseeing around the city and, what had her most excited, to the beach. Sure, she had never been to the beach before, and Cas spent hours watching her playing around, digging in the sand and building little forms out of it. They went into the water together, Cas wouldn't let her go alone, and Claire really seemed to be having the time of her life paddling around and splashing water at her father.
All that time, Dean was tightly holding onto Cas's arm, and as he found a steady rhythm he was rocking the two of them on the bed to, Cas closed his hand around Dean's wrist as well, holding him and looking straight into his eyes as he was moving inside him.
“Oh, so you’re implying that I am not a gentleman?”
… yeah,
Dean's eyes met Cas's with a look that was seeking confirmation, and after Cas had given him a quick nod, Dean answered.
Now, the older Winchester brother walked the few steps over to the door and opened it. He was now facing Castiel, who was standing out there in front of their door, dirty trench coat, a few single snowflakes in his hair, and a worried expression on his face.
I don’t mind all the travel
“Yes,” I quietly agreed, “So? Dean, I knew that. I am a grown man, I make my own decisions. And this was a decision I made, I deliberately chose to take that risk. It’s not your fault.”
"That sounds nice, though," Cas smiled.
What Dean is also scared about is disappointing Cas. Unknowingly leading him on, playing with his friend’s feelings. Because just hypothetically, if Dean tells him he likes him, and Cas happens to feel the same way, and they give it a try but Dean realizes he doesn’t
"Yeah," Dean said and looked directly into Cas's eyes. "Would you be willing to join me on the tour and pretend to be my boyfriend at certain occasions?"
Cas stood there in a rather awkward way for a second in which Dean closed the door, then Dean was finally back right next to him and introduced him to the ginger woman.
Dean must have noticed I was in thoughts. He eyed me for a moment as I was standing there, silently thinking.
"I won't bring a little kid into this," Dean said seriously. "We'd keep her out of it entirely. Well, as good as possible, considering that she already has been dragged in today. But I for sure wouldn't ask you to let me use her for my image. Definitely not."
Claire didn't react. She looked up at him out of her cute little blue eyes for just a moment.
Cas grasped the idea of what to do quite quickly and got to work with the pdf that was already on his laptop. Before he started checking the lyrics, though, he scrolled through the whole thing once to have a look at the design. When he reached the second to last page, he stopped.
"I told you," Jo laughed, "fucking idiots" Then she turned to Dean and Cas. "I'm glad you figured it out though," she said, "And I'm really happy for you. But to make that clear, I won't sit and listen to you two fucking ever again"
I am.
"Do me a favour and stop reading comments," Dean said softly, "okay? For your own good. You really don't need that in your life."
, right now."
"I, uhm ..." Dean stuttered quietly, "Well, there might be something that I wanted to do for a while. That I wanted to tell you."
"Mh," Dean made, "
"For how long has that been planned?" He asked.
“I don’t know,” Dean replied. “Right now, we’re just two guys, on a couch together. Whatever we will be, that’s on us to decide”
? What if it really had been Mr. Price standing there, who had caught us making out against the wall in a dark alley? And what if it hadn’t been him, but one of his neighbours instead? And what if this neighbour knew who we were, knew we were teachers at this school, and what if this neighbour told Mr. Price about it?
“Yeah,” he said, “Of course we did. And sometimes we tried to, I mean as good as two little boys can celebrate Christmas on their own. Like we got each other really small presents and had hot chocolate while watching a movie. But that’s it. And when Dad was there, we didn’t do anything at all. So … yeah. There was no Christmas baking for me.”
stop?!" She groaned at some point.
think it was good and let him show it to Dean knowing fully well he wouldn't like it?
and the way it feels so right
Then I started thinking about the time we spent together in the library on a regular basis, how he was just there, watching me work. He had no reason to be there, except for him actively seeking my company. But from a professional perspective, he had no reason at all to be in the library that much.
"What?" Both Dean and Cas made simultaneously.
"Don't mention it," Dean smiled. "Alright. Back door it is. Claire, I'll have to put on the sunglasses again. Can you handle that?"
“Oh don’t you think you’re suddenly the big brother of the staff,” Dean laughed. “It’s probably nothing but a couple months, you’re still a baby. We’re both in this”
His smile, Cas thought, it felt so good. It was beautiful, of course it was beautiful, it always was. But apart from that, it was also warm, it was honest, and it sparked that nice feeling inside his chest.
Finally, Dean reacted.
"As if we've ever had any sort of separation between work and private life," he then said.
Coming out took some courage, Cas knew that. Of course Cas knew that, he had been through it. And as scary and nerve-wracking his own experience might have been, he couldn't even imagine what it must have been like for Dean, working up the courage to be open about your sexuality to millions of people worldwide, and then watching people you don't know, people you have never met once in your life, calling you a liar and an attention whore, complete strangers acting like they knew your sexuality better than you ...
Cas's reply was a quick nod before he turned back to looking around the hall and manifesting his impression that he definitely didn't belong here.
He sent a quick message to Dean telling him 11.15 was alright, then he returned back to his work.
The tickets became available at 9 a.m. the next morning, and the first shows were sold out completely only 15 minutes later.
“Yes,” he said. “You’re not seriously telling me now you didn’t even notice?”
He was absolutely right, it never got boring.
Before I could get my mind even deeper into an analysis of what his words could have possibly meant, we arrived in front of Mr. Price’s office.
I had a hard time making up my mind, and Dean noticed that. After our talk at the Chapel he had told me again that he would give me all the time I needed, that I shouldn’t stress myself out too much over it. He had told me again that it was okay. And no matter what my final answer would be, it would be okay.
"He doesn't like me back," he then breathed.
"We wanted to do, like, a test run," he explained calmly. "We already did something similar downstairs with Jo, but she knew who I am, so we decided to try it on someone who's got no idea at all. We wanted to see if we'd pass as a convincing couple. What do you think, did we?"
