Tony can’t help but wonder if Natasha and Clint are okay. Where is Thor—he’s heard nothing from Asgard since that ill-fated mission. Nothing from Bruce.
Steve lets out a pleased hum when Tony bucks up against him, trying to force him off, and grinds down instead.
Tony shot him a look--much the same as the one he’d speared him with on the helicarrier back when they first crossed paths and he’d blatantly backtracked away from insulting Stark Tower--and Steve let it fall back to the bed. Not so easily forgiven, then.
When he drinks water, all he can smell is the bottle’s plastic, all he can taste is dirt and chemicals and it’s horrible. He doesn’t dare try the tap.

And if he told Tony about what the Winter Soldier had done to his parents…Mab had been fond of both Howard and Maria, and for all the strain between them, Steve didn’t believe for one moment that Tony

“Cat got your tongue?” Steve’s voice was smug and thick with self-satisfaction as he leaned against the doorframe of Tony’s bedroom, just casually lounging there as if he wasn’t perfectly well aware that Tony’s brain was leaking out from between his ears.
were powerful things, artifacts forged from the most powerful of curses. They were specifically crafted to affect a particular target and were hideously difficult to create. And rightfully so; it shredded the soul as well as the body. It was the sum totality of true death; a final, horrible, end. It took vast amounts of energy, resources, and skill, and more importantly than that, it took
Steve’s voice was dark with promise, and Tony screamed again, entirely at Steve’s mercy with no end in sight. He closed his eyes, praying that Steve would finally relent and touch him, he was so hard, so ready and it wasn’t enough, it wasn’t enough, it--
Tony was going to speak again, but broke off in a happy grunt as Steve manhandled him into a more comfortable position so that he could get at the plug again. Steve tossed the wide plug aside while Tony rooted around underneath the pillows until he produced a black and gold bottle of lube--waterproof and extra-slick because
Heaven. This was Heaven, and if anyone tried to drag him out he was going to throw them right out the window.
[[I mean, I’m glad to see the backstabbing fucker go down, but I feel compelled to remind you both this is a recon mission, not a murder-Nazis-and-drag-Rumlow-off-into-the-vengeful-dark type of mission.]]
” Steve grit out, eyes stinging with angry tears. “I thought Bucky was dead, when he fell from the train, but he wasn’t. I...I didn’t even
Tony’s right. It’s been nothing for him to just grab onto the armor for a quick lift, and then there’d been that time he’d literally plopped down on Iron Man’s back like he was riding a horse,
Natasha’s smile was vicious and smug, like a cat who had stolen the cream, eaten the mouse, caught the bird, and pinned the resultant carnage on the dog.
Tony goes stiff beside him, and Steve feels a flash of self-loathing that isn’t his, but before he can delve inside himself to pry at the nasty emotion brewing across the way, he feels Tony withdraw from him, leaving a burst of desperate reassurance and affection in his mental wake.
"Captain America downed everything from bathtub gin to torpedo juice, and whatever the hell it was Howard and Gabe were brewing in the still behind the mess hall. And that’s to say nothing of the various alcohol stashes that we liberated from the Nazis.”
He didn’t get to keep things, just memories. At least his perfect recall meant he’d have something to trot out on his lonelier nights.
“Okay, that thing is super old, and not even all that big of a deal. It gets trotted out every once in a while, but we got it discredited. Obie paid off some random actors to claim it as theirs. Most of the world thinks it’s a very good fake, nothing more.”
He darted the tip of his tongue out, wetting his lips, and watched Tony fixate on the tiny motion, eyes near black with intensity, felt Tony’s cock twitch sharply in his hands. Tony’s mouth fell open and Steve quickly swallowed down his guttural moan with a kiss, chasing the traces of aged scotch and spiced apple from one of the cider chasers Tony had stolen from him on a whim.
Tony’s safe enough in his armor—even vampires can’t bite through the gold-titanium alloy—and he’s not worried about Thor or Hulk, both of whom are more than capable of holding their own.
Tony, say it.” It’s more plea than demand, really. Tony’s abandoned his lips and is trailing his tongue down the side of his neck, pressing kisses into his taut muscles, and Steve is squirming beneath him, his breath coming in rough pants as Tony using lips and tongues and teeth to besiege each and every one of his erogenous zones. Down, Tony goes, down from his neck to the narrow ridges of his collarbone, nipping and licking at Steve’s sensitive skin before continuing further down, scattering kisses and gentle nips and licks over his torso.
Natasha snapped an ammo clip into her gun and holstered it before giving him truly spectacular side-eye.
must have caught on to his indecision, because he shrugged eloquently and wagged a finger back and forth like a metronome. “Tick tock, Officer Beefcake. You can write me a ticket and just pretend none of this happened and I’ll go on my merry way, but if you want you some, ball’s in your court.”
Keeping it classy, InTouch. Tony started to speak, but Steve flicked his hand and swept away the first holographic tabloid, only to be met with the same image but a different headline.

something in them. This chance not taken will see them ruined, too much between them too long unsaid. Tony will see himself dead before he spits it out and risks what they are for what they
Tony jerks his head to the side, breaking their eye contact as he swallows jerkily, but remains infuriatingly quiet. Tony
Tony continued to rock in and out of him, his pace unhurried but purposeful, a steady deep glide that built Steve’s pleasure upward and upward but still wasn't quite what he wanted.  Tony fucked him almost aimlessly, as if climax was an unexpected but nice surprise, like finding the prize in a box of Cracker Jacks.
Oh shit, yes, yes that was a thing, that was a thing that was happening right the fuck now. Tony’s mental workings recovered from the stall out, and he was all action again.
There’s barely enough time for him to register the commotion and get curious before Bulldozer and Thunderball plow through a crowd of bicyclists, Piledriver and Wrecker on their heels.

corrupted serum—enhanced and infused and warped to sinister intent—had made contact with Steve’s bloodstream, and somehow
His workshop is a technological marvel, taking up almost an entire floor all its own. There he designs new tech, weapons, and armor for the Avengers, or upgrades his various suits. It’s his musing room, his workroom, and is his usual haunt when he’s in the Tower.
Steve hooked an arm around Tony’s neck and snatched him down in reply, pouring all of his desire and appreciation into a long and filthy kiss that was really more of a mauling than anything else, drinking in Tony’s whimpers and murmurs and soft gasps. He wanted
I love it, love the feel of you, the way you’re so heavy and just dripping for me.” Tony nibbled at Steve’s ear as he continued the obscene litany, and Steve broke, crowding into Tony’s space until he was flush against him, grinding and rubbing against Tony, letting out a pleased hum as he grew more and more aroused until he was just as hard as Steve.
Tony threw his hands up in disgust, and turned away to gaze out the window at the Manhattan skyline. Steve said nothing, not really having any ready justifications. He was of a mind to just let Tony have a moment to chew through his feelings. Tony was a mess of emotions, but he liked to deal with them on his own terms instead of leaving himself raw and exposed to the world.
been in the wrong in the first place, and then he’d compounded things by digging in his heels and being contrary just to spite Steve, and had let things get wildly out of hand. When they’d returned to the Tower, Steve had reclaimed his belt and avoided Tony for almost two full days, citing a need to clear his head and think some things through. He’d returned with the belt, now neatly studded and attached to a length of welded silver steel chain, and searched Tony out.
“But…” Tony trailed off, stunned at the implications. IF that all were the case, then...shit. Ty was exactly enough of an asshole to pull a stunt like this, especially if his goal was to drive a wedge between him and Steve so he could move in for the kill.
Was the damn tape going to haunt him for the rest of his life?! If he could go back in time, he was going to punch Ty in the throat for suggesting they film themselves back on that stupid weekend trip to the Hamptons. They’d been drunk as hell, and Ty had been high as fuck, and Tony had been stupid enough to agree to the stupid bullshit, and now the world could watch 24-year-old him get tied down--badly, because Ty was
“I warned you before we began that it might not work--there is wild magic afoot here, and my own powers work on improbabilities, not formal spells. There
Tony closes his hand enough that he can trace the bottom half of it with his middle finger, and a warm curl of something light and joyous winds around his heart. There is a sort of answering recognition in the metaphysical distance, and then something butts against his leg.
Steve registered Tony shifting around, and when those same (wonderful, glorious, magnificent) hands began to work over his glutes, Steve realized with a vague sort of interest that Tony had turned around, and Steve could only hope that….oh hell yes….
Steve hadn’t felt quite this miserable since the days of World War II, and all he wanted was a too long shower, and maybe a rub down with that BioFreeze Tony kept stashed before he crawled into bed. Steve felt a little guilty. Tony was always so keyed up after combat, but he was always in so much pain he had little to no energy to attempt anything, and more often than not after a mission--after he’d showered and crawled into bed and tried to will as much numbness up as he could--Tony would eventually slip away into the bathroom and take care of himself before returning to cuddle up against Steve and drift off to sleep. It wasn’t even like Tony
“It’s okay, Wanda. You and Thor did what you could.” Tony sighs and reaches out to run a hand over Steve’s head.
, and he’s content to let Steve have it. If it’s even Steve anymore. Tony’s tried to focus on his magical tattoo or whatever the hell it is, but nothing works. Steve’s not in there right now, and he can’t figure out if it’s temporary or if the goat brain is all that’s left and Steve is
Tony never gets enough sleep as it is, and he’s not going to wake his fella up now and drag him along so he won’t turn into a goat again, all just to get a sandwich.
he understood the full breadth of that expression, and it took everything he had not to turn around and just go back home.
Tony renews his struggles against Bulldozer, aided by the chaos, but it isn’t until Carol flies in and punches his captor in the back of the head that he manages to free himself.
It registers finally as the lack of pain catches up to him. Steve’s not fighting him back—the ripping and the tearing is the sound of
worked alone. Steve has a way of...rallying people to his causes. Tony doubts Steve is going to return to the European wilds to frolic with the vampire neo-nazi Hydra agents—and quite honestly he expects that Steve quite gleefully murdered the whole lot of them before returning to the Tower—but Steve has stolen his mother’s bones to recreate Howard’s serum, and it doesn’t take a genius (even if he is one) to figure out his next move from there.
his nipple, the soft and moist heat almost too much to take as it sent constant bursts of pleasure radiating out from it and down through his body and straight through his erection like a livewire. Tony continued to mouth at the pert nub as he trailed his other hand up to flick and stroke over the other.
it. It’s something there in the back of his eyes when he makes contact with his reflection, something that sets his nerves to stinging like ants swarming their unfortunate target as rage churns like acid in his veins and his lungs constrict. His instincts recoil and Tony is seconds from hurling the kinetic energy sculpture on his nightstand at the mirror when his mother’s chilling caress passes over his cheek, dampening his emotions until he can breathe again.
He does his best to ignore the lack of anything solid, winces and turns away from the trashcan and it’s contents before he gets sick all over again. The water from the bar sink removed the worst of the taste from his mouth, leaving him feeling a little less gritty.
Tony presses a soft kiss to his inner thigh, then scoots his way up the bed until he’s resting on the pillows beside him, still taking care to stay in contact with Steve’s body. No one wants a goat inserted into these proceedings. Tony’s smiling, and it’s one that Steve’s never seen before. It’s a little fond, a little soft, and his eyes are so warm and blue with a gleam of genuine happiness in them. It’s a devastating look on Tony, who usually so in control, so unflappable and guarded. This is the deepest part of Tony, the truest part, the one he’d always
There were already countless internet archives dedicated to his nude pics that had been taken back during his Jamaica trip when he’d been sunbathing on what was supposed to be a private beach, and dozens of invasive snaps of him skinny-dipping at his family’s villa in the Italian countryside.
“You sexy beast. That was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen in my life, holy crap, Steve.” Tony tucked his head into the crook of his neck. “You need to go off on that kind of a tangent
JARVIS is offline, somehow; Tony doesn’t know enough to guess what happened, but this is who he suspects: Steve.
“I knew the state was having budget problems, officer, but I'd think they'd be able to spring for some clothes in the proper size. I do
fucked, and shit, Steve was barely even registering any of it because Tony hadn’t. Fucking. Stopped.
Steve glared furiously at Tony when the vibrations stopped altogether, leaving him on edge and frustratingly bereft. He remained tense for another moment, braced for the vibration to start again, his nerves primed and on edge, and...nothing.
Steve was thick, possibly twice the size of anyone else Tony had encountered, and as he lightly ran his hand up and down the hot, hard length Tony was unable to stop himself from spreading the already leaking precome across Steve’s blunt head.
Oh, he’s never been ashamed of his body, never thought he was unattractive or ill-formed, and it’s nice to find out that even though he’s temporarily without the serum, the years of proper medical attention, rich food, and high quality of life that only comes from exposure to luxury (bless you, Tony) is enough that he he’s filled out some and is still quite healthy. But he’s not conventionally attractive. Not like Tony’s usual fare.
Steve glances up at Tony to offer up a bit of comfort because, well, Tony looks like he really needs it, but when he opens his mouth to speak all that comes out is a startlingly loud bleat.
Tony swore and had his hands in Steve’s jeans a moment later, and it felt nice, felt amazing, but the tangle of limbs was awkward and Steve pulled free of the kiss.
He wants to relive the hazy memory of soft lips and warm breath over his throat, wants the way his heart pounded as pleasure rushed down his spine and blew through his veins as Steve sucked greedy mouthfuls of his blood. He wants to revisit the ecstatic pleas, the writhing and dizziness and screaming as he shattered again and again as Steve held him down and
Steve finally manages to knock Wrecker's crowbar out of his hand, and without the key to their powers, the next few moments are very, very ugly for them. The police take possession of the crowbar and arrange for prisoner transport for the now unconscious Wrecking Crew while the Avengers huddle up around Steve and Tony.
Tony finally (sadly) abandoned the scalp massage and moved back to his torso, rubbing his hands across the hard planes of his abs and his pecs, scratching lightly through his chest hair. Steve shuddered suddenly, the vague pleasantness shifting and turning into something more urgent, heightened to an arc of sudden
Steve rolled his eyes at Tony’s teasing grin, though it took some doing to keep an answering smile off his face.
his old neighborhood, not by any stretch of the imagination. It looked...sterile. Whitewashed. All the life and energy and hectic buzz of life that he’d known was just...gone. There was a Starbucks taking up the space where The Velvet used to stand, and a case of dried out looking pastries taking up the spot where he used to bum cigarettes and listen to Gypsy Rose Lee fondly bitch about Madame Tirza and her “precious” wine fountain to whomever she was holding court with at the moment.
He finished the Glenfarclas 25 on Saturday, the Dalmore 28 the Thursday past, the Macallan he threw at Howard’s smug fucking head—
“And what? You didn’t trust me?” Tony’s cheek twitched with the force of his not-quite repressed ire. “You share my bed and are a fixture in my life, but you couldn’t even be bothered to pick up a damn phone and call me? It was my own fucking tech, Steve! Did you think I wouldn’t be of any help?!”
Afterwards, Tony only ever saw that collar when Steve was doling out punishments, and Tony had to fuck up
Tony snaps awake with a stomach roiling in rage and guilt and shame and heaves last night’s dinner onto the floor.
Tony’s lips quirk, imagining Yinsen’s wry commentary. He gets up like an old man, first one leg then the other, his limbs weak and momentarily unsteady. He almost faceplants, tripping over the full bottle of Rhum Clement.
No one would respect him. He’d be right back to the weakling he’d hated being, a disgraced failure of a science experiment who didn’t even have the balls to fight alongside his unenhanced comrades. Unable--and even more unwilling--to expose his suffering, Steve followed in the fine tradition of a millions of shell-shocked soldiers and remained stoic, sucking in his pain and holding it inward, waiting for when he could safely unleash it and vent in private.
Tony, Thor had informed him, had manifested armor for him just to see him safe. Powerful armor. He wasn’t even
“What a sight that would be, huh? Half of the silver spoons in New England crowding in the doorway to see what the ruckus was and discovering it’s you getting fucked senseless.”
He can’t draw him now, but there’ll be other nights, other moments, and he’ll indulge himself then. For now, though? Steve stares down at Tony, and whispers it again into the quiet. “I love you.”
Tony wants to deny it, but the strange curdling of his stomach, the growing hunger that he can’t seem to sate even as he feels like he’s starving—those are things not easily overlooked. The only thing more disturbing than the hunger itself, though, is what he suspects might sate it.
to normal people, and oh fuck, this had to be the serum. There was a bit of fear--was this a thing--was he always going to spring wood now, as if his body was just going to constantly hand erections over as some sort of consolation for the utter wreck he’d been ever since he had the serum? Mostly, though, was a rising sense of euphoria, like he’d felt when he’d finally gotten to really cut loose after getting the serum.
He allowed his gaze to travel lazily all the way down and back up the officer’s body before he tossed out the filthiest leer in his repertoire and followed it up with a roguish wink.
“That’s it, babe, that’s good, c’mon Stevie, c’mon, does it feel good, you feel so good and I want you in me after this, babe, you sound so hot, scream so pretty for me,
Tony considered staying put for a mutinous second but knew it would go worse for him in the end. Besides, Steve had a point, didn’t he? And Pepper...he was going to catch hell from Pepper too. She always got a bit testy whenever Ty came into the picture, and any week that damned sex tape came crawling out of whatever hole they’d buried it in was a bad one. Steve would’ve been the one to bear the brunt of that inevitable explosion, because Pepper would’ve told him about the tape, and that conversation always went badly for anyone involved. As leader of the Avengers, Steve also would’ve been the one inundated with phone calls and emails about the headlines. The sex tape would have only compounded the whole mess exponentially, and Tony had no illusions about how all that had been going for Steve. It was going to be two weeks, maybe three, before everything died down and was replaced with a more interesting scandal, and if Steve didn’t snap and go off the deep end before it was all over, it would be a miracle.
Steve took in a deep breath and nodded, exhaled as Tony took that as his cue to move forward. It went this way for a short while, Steve gulping down air and controlling his breathing in order to better handle the thick, delicious slide of Tony inside until he finally bottomed out, whispering a fervent string of curses under his breath.
“Our fair Witch does not cast with incantations, but this is a mixture of Asgardian curses and Vanir sorcery, and we would see the risk lightened. You must remain silent once we begin.” Thor moves to Tony’s circle, parallel Wanda yet outside the barrier of crystals.
Even in private, there was a fine curl of humiliation that wound through him and set him off balance whenever he wore one. Tiberius had insisted because he couldn’t stand to bypass the display of power, Obie had
Steve was used to it, though. From the first struggling breath he ever drew, he had known pain. His spine was crooked, and his back had long been a knot of tension and strained muscles. His legs ached, possibly from polio though he’d blessedly missed it ever fully presenting. He was weak and fatigued easily, and his own sparse weight sat too heavy on his brittle bones, leaving him wishing for a moment of relief, fleeting though it might be. His joints ached in the winter and when it rained, and when it was hot his skin burnt and peeled, leaving him miserable whether he was inside or out. His asthma reared its head often and without mercy, leaving him gasping and wheezing and struggling for a breath that just wouldn’t come, and when it did it was just barely enough air getting through his burning lungs that had squeezed tight and left him light-headed and unsteady on his feet..
Tony snapped his fingers and leveled a finger at Steve. “I will admit to being quietly astounded. The bastion of American Strength and Righteousness isn’t 100% straight. Holy shit, it’s the end of days.”
He’s got his Razr phone out and is ringing Carol when a sudden aggressive squawk and a surge of irritation that isn’t his washes over him. It calls to mind the look of irritation Steve gives D-list villains for wasting his time before he knocks them a good one. It’s all there; the glare, the frown, the way he sets his jaw, and clenches his shield strap. Tony half expects to see Steve there in full Captain Regalia when he glances up from his phone, but the reality is much more ridiculous.
He’s a salvager, a fixer, and he’s certain he could somehow unwind what’s happened to Steve with enough time and research...but
Jan heads back into the relative safety of the mansion, joining Clint (who is munching popcorn in the common room’s window, and Carol (who is sipping from her coffee mug).
“What the hell, is this a third elbow??” Tony reared back slightly. He’d realized that Steve was big, but he’d apparently failed to give enough thought to just what that massive ridge in Steve’s pants was all about. Fuck. Steve was definitely the largest Tony had ever encountered. Easily.
He can feel the grin tugging at his lips, and idly twirls a hand through Tony’s curling hair. Tony’s been wearing it straighter and more neatly trimmed now, but he used to have such curls. In his idle daydreams of things he once thought could never be, he’d wanted to just bury his hands in the unruly mass and bask in his presence. Some stupid silly thing, born more of a deep-laden desire to wrap himself around Tony.
Steve moaned brokenly as Tony tightened his legs around his hips and rocked against him in a slow grind that sent heat rushing down his spine. “Can’t you just fucking flex and shred your shirt? I feel like that’s a thing you should be able to do?”
Tony caught Steve by the hand and drew him over to the shower, pulling him along until he was in the middle of the different sprays, and the easy flow of warm water over and around his body--such a difference from Tony’s own painfully rough and scorching blasts--began to offset the worst of his aches.
Oh no...oh yes, god...Steve groaned lowly in the back of his throat. Tony...Tony was an attractive man, and Steve didn’t go a day without wanting him, but yet another excruciatingly awkward encounter that left them both unsatisfied and treading carefully around the other would break him right now.
He has a thousand things he wants to say to Tony, but that can be later. Right now, though, he focuses on Tony’s face. Tony hasn’t met his gaze once since their midnight confrontation, and God, who could blame him? Those blue eyes go warm, and Tony’s pupils dilate, and Steve can see him trying to mask it, to recall his composure, but there has always been intensity between them, and Tony has never been capable of indifference where he’s concerned.
“I can’t believe I’m bypassing that little revelation about you and the SSR raiding booze, but hold on .My dad...was bootlegging hooch during the war?”
“I love you, Steve Rogers. I always have.” There’s a gentle roll of emotion through the bond, love and peace and tremulous hope, and Steve greedily luxuriates in it. It’s not everyday your most impossible dream comes true.
He glanced across the ballroom at Natalie, who had easily insinuated herself into Stane’s circle of sycophants, and was quite busy flirting for all she was worth. Stane seemed more focused on the dark red curls that framed her wide green eyes and the sparkle of her large diamond studs under the chandelier’s light; money and beauty was a powerful combo. So powerful, in fact, that Steve was certain the man had no awareness of the tiny red-haired tsum picking his pocket.
Tony had subsided, burning with humiliated rage about the collaring for almost the entire span of the mission, which shifted into just plain humiliation because he
“I…” Tony’s words dry up as a wild expression crosses his face. God, he’s such a mess over this whole situation.
Steve had been hurt, could have been killed, and that was all Tony could see--a thousand what-ifs, and no consideration for what actually was. Steve was alive and mostly well--would be just fine once the serum did its trick-- but all Tony could see was the grim alternative. He was stuck on it.
“First of all, you could've left along with everyone else, and if nothing else, you should have ducked that kiss!! I meant it when I said he doesn’t get to touch you!”
“Aye! The Man of Iron’s love for our esteemed captain is most powerful indeed, and it has marked him!”
Weak fool that he is, Tony had simply left Steve in his room, with a bowl of water and the evening’s leftovers in case he got hungry, and assumed that would be enough to tide Steve over until morning. He’d expected Steve to sleep soundly in familiar surroundings.
“Rebirth? Um...I’m Steve. Rogers. Steve Rogers, that is. I should tell you that upfront? And, um, I uh...I mean, I was just here for my shield, but...I mean, I’m not averse to helping you clean out Stane while we’re here? Return the favor and all that?”
Steve huffs out an ugly burst of laughter. He’s perfectly at home in his own skin and the only thing he had ever disliked about himself had been his weakness and propensity for sickness that kept him out of the military before Project Rebirth, but he had no illusions--he wasn’t beautiful, not like Tony is.
The first sign things had gone horribly awry was the miniature version of himself peeking out from around the corner. Steve
Tony shelled out for the fancy stuff--and snapped it open. Tony took hold of Steve’s erection and lubed it up with the same quick but efficient touch he’d used in the shower, then shoved the tube back under the nest of pillows.
Instead, he has to sit here and watch Tony damn near have a stroke over the whole damn thing, has to watch as he blatantly backpedals away from everything they could be, denying it all as he frantically builds an defensive wall between them.
it, and he could hug Amora because this whole mess has put paid to almost a decade’s worth of pining and yearning on his part. He’s not been subtle, but Tony is the master of poker faces, and for all their closeness he couldn’t get a clear read on Tony. Not on this. He’d been content to let things lie because he’ll be damned if he ruins their friendship by greedily pushing for more, but he
Tony pulled back and shot a wickedly triumphant grin up at Steve, who was looking dazed and startled, and set back at his task with obscene enthusiasm, unleashing a decade’s worth of carnal prowess that Steve had no other option but to endure.
, his whole body rocking as he got closer and closer to his peak, then he would slow down, let himself come down a bit and then work himself back up to the edge again.
He would chase it sometimes, goading Tony on, or forcing himself to push past it until he was a near sobbing ball of frustration, rubbed raw and on edge and too wrapped up in his own head to do anything productive about it. Tony, bless him, always seemed to take it personally, comforting Steve and calming him down and never quite daring to ask if it was him, if he was doing something wrong, but not entirely able to hide the self-blame that lurked deep within his eyes. Steve wasn’t stupid--he could see the way Tony seemed to retreat into himself once the inevitable occurred, no doubt mentally replaying everything to find the flaw, the moment everything went wrong, and devising a game plan for next time.
Tony shifted off of him again, and Steve made a protesting noise as Tony’s comforting weight was removed, but then Tony got one of his feet in his hand, and pressed, and Steve went limp, entirely limp, as all of the remaining tensions fled his body.
“To be fair, tall, blonde, and handsome always was your weakness, wasn’t it, Tony?” Good ole’ Jan. At least
Steve let himself be pushed down on top of a pool of cool black satin sheets and buried his face in the mound of pillows, rubbing his cheeks over the slick fabric and breathing in the fading scent of the lavender dryer sheets mingled with the tobacco and sandalwood afternotes of Tony’s custom cologne, and enveloping it all, their mingled scents. Steve, long adjusted to his own, inhaled again as he stretched and shifted about until he was comfortable, seeking out Tony’s own unique scent.
Bucky was a marked man. Winter’s Queen was not merciful, and Steve couldn’t envision a singularly worse person to incur a grudge from.
Tony glances over at Carol, who doesn’t look much impressed with not being as up-to-date on information as she could be and holds his hand up. “I... this appeared after the Blue Ādaraya exploded. I can...use it to talk to Steve?”
” Steve arched into the sensation as Tony bit his collarbone and then licked up the side of his neck before nibbling at the patch of skin just below his ear, wreaking havoc on his nerves.. “Or do you want me to drop you?”
Tony shifted, blatantly unsympathetic, but still listening. Tony was categorically unable to ignore information freely offered (or stolen, or purchased, or traded), and he would often lecture anyone he thought needed the lesson that “all knowledge is worth having.” How he held himself back from looting SHIELD’s database back during the invasion was a miracle in and of itself.
chill, born of the kind of cold that reminded him of the arctic water, icy and unforgiving. The kind of chill that crawled up walls and frosted windows and mirrors and turned a man’s breath to vapor. The kind of cold that followed scions of the Winter Court, when they deigned to remind the world just who and what they were dealing with.
Coffee churns in his stomach, acidic and bitter. Bread tastes like sawdust, meat is gritty, and the shredding and grinding and chewing grates on his nerves, sets his teeth on edge. Canned food tastes like mush and metal, fresh vegetables taste like dirt, and carbonated
The warm liquid slides down his throat, a metallic hint of copper behind a snap of ripened apple and dark sweetness, and Tony’s shelled out thousands for 100-year old ports that couldn’t hold a candle to this. Steve lets out a happy murmur of pleasure and yanks at Tony’s hair, keeps him drinking as he wraps his other hand over Tony’s waist and tugs, urging him to thrust harder, and harder still.
Steve was leveling an especially dour look at the European Wax Center that replaced what once had been a house shared by three families he’d grown up with before the war, when he felt the warmth of another person settle in beside him.
The officer studied his license for a long moment, then pinned him with a disgusted glare. “Mr. Stark, what is
Steve’s dick hardened again, stirring to life underneath Tony’s weight, and a pregnant silence fell between them, Tony looking like every major holiday had come at once bearing copious amount of presents. Steve wasn’t sure what he felt--there was a bit of appalled horror because
Tony stares quietly for a long moment, wonders briefly if he might not be able to just go back to bed and close his eyes and start this day over. This? This is more than anyone can reasonably be expected to put up with. He immediately feels guilty on the heels of that particular sentiment, because, well, he’s not the one who’s actually a goat.
Tony has just enough time to activate the emergency signal on his Avengers id card for backup before he’s snatched up by Bulldozer and held in place with superhuman strength as the Wrecking Crew form a defensive wall around him, daring the police to try anything.
He ignores the truth screaming at him, locked away in the darkest recesses of his mind, because Tony can’t—
” and sucking it sent the man howling for God. Tony didn’t much think there was anyone listening, but he was all about helping out his fellow man so he would take Steve deep during those moments and
Steve had wandered into the minefield of Tony’s emotion processing to know to pick and choose his battles. He let Tony take the time he needed to regain his equilibrium, and rubbed the soft satin sheet pooled around him between his fingertips, wondering how everything in his life could have gone completely bottoms up for the second time now. He’d finally gotten his feet back under him, had started to adjust, and now this.
Tony freezes in shock, his brown eyes snapping up to meet Steve’s azure blue gaze. It feels like drowning in still arctic water, like being seen and pulled apart and
was the playboy here, thank you, and sassy cops who got too damned full of themselves and talked shit about what he personally could or couldn’t take needed to be put back in line. Tony continued, persistently gentle as Steve relaxed even more into it, humming in encouragement as the cop’s hips began to shift back and forth as he fell into Tony’s rhythm.
Tony circled around him, moving from his right arm to his back, and Steve pressed back into Tony’s touch, seeking the contact on his sore muscles for a moment before losing his nerve and backing away as the perfunctory scrub grew uncomfortable. No fool Tony, he eased up on the pressure and pressed an apologetic kiss to Steve’s shoulder blade, light and almost teasing, and it was just enough to tip back over into pleasurable. He’d been halfway hard just from the shower and Tony’s tender ministrations, but he stirred to full attention, and Steve groaned inwardly. This was going to be a disaster, please don’t be a disaster, couldn’t his body just cooperate for once an--
Steve’s voice was still heavy with erotic menace, but there was also careful attention underneath it, and Tony knew that all he had to do was nod and Steve would call a halt to everything.
No updates since then. It was already ten minutes after--if this ended with him being stood up, he was never trusting Nat again. Steve pocketed his phone and leaned against the streetlight so he wasn’t blocking the sidewalk flow, and took in the sights and sounds of his old neighborhood only to realize that there was nothing there that was familiar.
weird!” He doesn’t mean to snap or interrupt Tony, but the thought of loving and being loved by Tony, of suddenly being connected to him at such a deep level and having it written off as ‘weird’ is...appalling. He draws in a calming breath, tries again.
Steve got himself settled in the tub, leaning back against the built in cushion and stretching out fully so that the gently churning water bubbled and foamed across his body. Tony sprinkled a liberal amount of epsom salt into the tub, and the scent of eucalyptus and spearmint rose up from the steaming hot water as the crystals dissolved, mingling with the lavender and teakwood bubble bath Steve had borrowed once from Natasha and never returned.
Steve pushed back and up into Tony, urging the man on as he rocked against him, enjoying the sharper-edged pleasure in the wake of his orgasm. The serum meant he could--and usually would--go off twice in a row, and the second one was always so intense. Great sex had already redeemed the day in his eyes, but the sudden chance to serve Tony back some of his own was the cherry on top. “Sure. Think you can do better than your driving and not come too fast?”
He’s been barricaded up here for hours, days, a week, perhaps; he’s lost all concept of time, and JARVIS doesn’t speak to him anymore. No help there. JARVIS is gone. Where’s JARVIS? JARVIS doesn’t speak to him anymore. No help there. JARVIS. No help. This should terrify him, should drive him wild with fury and fear and he’s floundering and the thoughts run loose and spiral and he needs help he needs—“JARVIS!
“I’ll call you with the details. Answer your phone, or I’ll give that old grandma who hangs out at the lobby coffee shop your phone number. She swears she was your number one fan back in the day. ”
Tony stares in horror at the grotesque apparition placidly watching him from the opposite end of the table, blue eyes cold with malice and glinting with promised violence. It’s the gaze of a starving predator, and Tony can’t help but shudder, entirely at a loss for words and not quite sure if he should just run screaming from the room or blink so that it would disappear when he opened his eyes.
filling his nostrils. It smells beautiful, like bussed cheeks and lingering hugs, of Sunday brunches and a goodbye he never got to make.
“Love is one of the most powerful goads in existence, a potent magic all its own, and nothing is more intense than what True Love manifests in its protection. Too late, and to their sorrow do those who would hinder it learn their fate.”
Tony draws in a shuddering breath, curses softly, and rolls off of Steve. “Yeah, no, we’re not doing this. Our first time isn’t happening on the floor.”
. Steve needs a bath, Clint has skills. They can get some soap, hose him down in the backyard, and call it a day.
When they finally break apart, Tony’s expression is soft and mystified--and dazed, Steve is pleased to note. They are both breathing raggedly, and Steve wonders if it’s too soon to go back for more. Tony had poured so much of himself into that kiss, and he wants more. He wants Tony to kiss him, to hold him, to cry out and move in him, to shower him with sweet loving words as he shatters apart again, and again, and again, until he is a wrung out ruined mess under Tony’s hands.
In the center of it all was Tony, wonderfully, gloriously naked, an inscrutable expression on his face. It might have been appraisal, might have been lust, might have even just been Tony mentally off on a tangent and staring through him.
“I’m a thief too!” Steve froze as the words tumbled out, then hung his head in resignation. “I mean, I’m not a
“Aye. Asgardian magic was the catalyst for our cursed friend’s state, and it shall be the trigger for this night’s work. Mjolnir will provide Wanda the mystic spark she needs.”
Steve trembled, intensely aware of that solid presence sitting rigid just past his opening, and how big it was. Oh, he’d had
Did Tony stop? Just work himself open and stick it in? He doubted it. Tony was too self-indulgent for that. No, he’d probably took the plug, traced himself with it, slowly worked it in and then pumped it in and out, nudging it against his prostate while he stroked himself off. Tony was quiet in the bedroom, all whimpers and low moans, husky, broken pleading... but alone? Was Tony noisy alone, giving reign to the need to vocalize his pleasure, or did he keep to the sweetly obscene murmurs and pleas, a dark and low tribute to his pleasure? He probably came so hard on it, twitching and gasping and--and--
Slowly, Tony curved his hands into claws and the massaging became scratching; nothing too vigorous or rough, however, but a careful scrub that worked up the thin layer of mission sweat and days of product residue that hadn’t entirely been washed away.
Steve wanted to kick himself. Tony was a friend and colleague, and a prime catch. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t at least a bit intrigued by the man. Lord knew Tony popped up in his fantasies quite often these days.
He’d never known loss could ache worse than any physical affliction. It was bitter in his mouth. It crowded in around his ribs to crush his lungs and rip and tear and stab at his heart like a poisoned blade. It churned the acid in his stomach and the fatigue of making it from one moment to the next cramped his muscles, and he wasn’t sure which was worse--all that, or the physical pain that was ever present, and had somehow grown even worse because all that time in the ice? It had set the serum on edge, made it more sensitive, and he’d had no choice but to soldier on through it all and try to scrape out some sort of semblance of acceptance with his horrific lot in life.
,” Tony snarled, ripping open one of the condom packets. The noise of the crinkling foil triggered an almost Pavlovian response in Steve, who groaned throatily in anticipation and licked his lips, eyes fluttering closed.
? That captured me long before your physical attraction.” Tony ducks his head a little, as if unused to speaking so plainly, and maybe that
. Tony suddenly twisted his left nipple at the same time as he sucked at the other one, an almost rough sensation that sent molten heat careening along his nerves and Steve’s knees buckled as he nearly whited out from the intense sensation of his orgasm crashing through him, shuddering and twitching and panting for breath as he collapsed on Tony.
Life, protection, healing, positivity. The energies are complementary and bolster each other, contained within a tool that is both elegant and functional. Tony can almost hear his mother’s approving hum. It’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever made.
He didn’t even have the luxury of his own damn name anymore. Steve Rogers was dead because the world was through with Captain America, and Steven Grant walked in his place. Steve had floundered at first, unsure what to do with his life, so he’d traveled a bit, studied a lot, and in between the mad rush to learn as much as possible about the new era he was in and escape the crushing weight of being utterly alone in it, he’d gone right back into public service as an officer of the law, because he’d be damned if he wasn’t going to do
As if to contrast the luxuriant gloom of the dining room—or, perhaps, to accent it—the meal is red, red as wine,
Steve looks smug as hell about it, rolls them both over so that Tony is on top, rocks up against Tony as if to urge him to action, and Tony can’t help but sulk because he wants to take in that glorious expanse of muscle, the pale skin and chiseled perfection. Some sights deserve being burned into memory.
Tony’s resolve weakens and he wants to eat, but he knows that will spell his undoing—he knows his lore, and it’s always that voluntary surrender of humanity, that final step that seals the fall, but it’s so tempting and smells so wonderful and he’s
Tony taken care of, Steve continued, not releasing Tony’s cock as he chased his own orgasm now. Tony convulsed and bit at Steve’s shoulder, muffling his high-pitched whines of overstimulation, shivering and trembling and falling apart as Steve pumped up and down their cocks frantically.
Tony relaxed into the task, time blurring around him as he danced Steve towards the edge of an orgasm only to lead him away again and again. It became a bit of an experiment for him, and Tony greedily pursued his data.
Tony’s been too focused lately on not getting eaten alive and trying to string a coherent thought together to find time to think about how much he wants to fuck Steve through the nearest surface—which is constantly—but he’s got 250 lbs. of vampire Steve settled in his lap, and apparently, a good tussle gets him going. Almost as much as winning does—Tony’s observant and he knows that grin well—it’s on Steve’s face every time he watches a Hydra base go up in flames, or he pisses off a bigot, or he gets Tony up in arms and verbally tongue-tied when they argue.
“That man holds one of the blackened denari, one of Judas’ silver pieces now possessed by fallen angels. Orthiel’s coin.”
“Time to what? Sit in your room and mope? Brutalize another hapless punching bag? Skip therapy sessions?”
Tony panted into his mouth as Steve got his hands on his cock, trailing his fingers over the heavy length before swiping the steadily leaking precum down all six...and a half...seven...
and Steve shakes and shivers and desperately gasps for breath as his pulses races and his muscles tense and a scorching heat rushes up his legs and pools low below his stomach as he finally tumbles over the edge and comes in thick, pulsing ropes. Tony thrusts once, twice, and then stiffens and makes the most incredible noise, hoarse and breathy and low, like he wants to scream but his vocal cords utterly fail him, as he shatters apart, spending himself deep inside Steve's body.
. Afterwards had followed an intensely wretched day-and-change of wearing the collar before Steve called things as square, and Tony could’ve wept. He thought he actually might’ve, when Steve had removed the collar and let him sink into his body and rock them to completion.
, I’ll drag you off to jail and--” Steve’s threat broke off into a low, halting grunt as Tony pressed into him, and even stretched and turned on as he was, he had to make himself relax and not clench up around the sudden intrusion. Tony was solicitous, rubbing his back and staying as still as he could.
“I didn't know about Hydra, Steve. I got into the systems at SHIELD, yes, but I didn't go deep enough. I never got the chance to. I know we sometimes operate in radically different spheres, but something like that? I would have blown it wide open. I would have told you, if I’d even
Tony laughed wildly as they almost fell to the floor, a triumphant and joyous sound that Steve was unable to do anything with save answer with a muzzy, wry smile of his own, half-drunk in his afterglow. “Way to get almost crushed, genius.”
Tony tried to tug away from Steve’s cock, had to try it twice more before Steve paid attention. “Okay, baby, okay, I’m going to get you ready now, okay? Do you still want me in you?”
Steve removed his hand for a moment to reposition one of Tony’s legs and shift him back into a more manageable position, and Tony’s voice was loud and strained above the wet, sticky slapping together of their flesh and mingled frantic, gasping exertions.
There was another hand at work in his upbringing, however, a master’s touch far more subtle and deadly than Howard would have ever believed—if he’d ever known at all.
Steve jerked away from Tony when he pressed another finger in, the sensation too much too fast, and rocked his hips this way and that to assist with the stretching as Tony murmured an apology and went back down to two fingers. It took a few more false starts, but Tony finally got a third finger in and Steve gripped the ridges of the Saleen’s hood as he worked through the discomfort, hoping he didn’t do any lasting damage to the car.
Tony glanced back out of his rearview mirror and perked up in interest as he took in a rather magnificent ass clad in tan uniform pants so tight they must have been painted on, tucked into a pair of leather boots. God, what a view. Tony blinked in shock as the cop straightened up from the saddle box where he’d dug a flashlight out and strode over towards the car.
The days blur together, and he doesn’t remember if it’s Monday or Saturday or the next month already.
Steve reached from behind his back--that’s right, Steve had kept one arm out of view, hadn’t he?--and held up a length of chain and attached to the end of it. Oh.
He realizes now, two decades and a box of film reels held hostage by SHIELD later that his father had never quite known what to make of that. Howard’s spark of genius had blazed like a star in Tony, and his father obsessively nurtured and jealously dampened it in turns, raising him in a fury of love and resentment that Tony was still unraveling emotions about to this day.
A pained silence filled the room as the echoes of Steve’s shout faded. Tony’s cheek ticked as he fought down the urge to  land his own retort and make it all worse. Patience. Steve would be so damn proud. Steve drew in a calming breath, and let it out slowly, then did it again. And again. One last time.
There was an urge Tony had sometimes to act out. Maybe it was mischief, or the end result of being spoiled, or simple random whimsy. Maybe it was because he was Tony Fucking Stark ™, and he could get away with murder. Whatever it was, it reared its head and the words were out of his mouth before he could even contemplate censoring them.
“God, no, just...I mean, I would have dressed up if I’d known it was you. I um...I thought this was a casual thing.”
show.” Steve’s voice was low and husky and challenging, thick with want. “Show me a good time, why don’t you, gorgeous?”
“I know all too well how quickly things get out of control when rumor and hearsay get involved. I can be discreet.”
Tony’s hands aren’t clean. He’s killed before, both on purpose and accidentally. This though...this isn’t weapons he designed in the wrong hands, or literally battling his way out of a cave for his survival. This isn’t fighting off an invading alien army or dealing with murderous Hydra agents. This is Tony, deliberately deciding to
, just give me a moment.” They lay still against each other, letting the night breeze blow over them and then Tony was pulling back out and easing back into him, slowly at first, letting Steve adjust. Slowly but surely, the overwhelming feeling of intrusion was overridden with frissons of pleasure, and Steve relaxed even more, allowing Tony to move uninhibited.
"I was an art student growing up in Brooklyn Heights who cruised the St.George Hotel and lived a short piece away from the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Arnie wasn’t even my
Tony let out a broken sob and threw his head back, gasping for breath, and it was all too much for Steve and he rolled them over in order to get better leverage as he pumped himself in and out of Tony, lost to his own pleasure again. This one was even better than the shower, better than the one he’d had earlier because he was fully aware of this one and not gone off on a mental jaunt, and all he felt was good and relaxed and so damn wonderful. It had been so long, it had been so long and it was so good, so perfect, and he loved it, had never felt like so completely blissed-out and at peace in his life, and he wanted more, more,
” Tony’s voice was deathly quiet, bitter. Tony, Steve abruptly realized, wasn’t angry. Well, no, he was. But there was more to it than that. Tony was...Jesus. Tony was
Tony had held on as long as he could, but Steve had set a stringent pace and it was all Tony could do to hang on to the here and now. Time slipped sharply back into focus and Tony whimpered against his impromptu gag as began to harden again, his breath coming in rough gasps as his erection bobbed up and down to the force of Steve’s movements.
Bucky was alive, but had been brainwashed so hard all he knew was murder and targets in between scraps of memory and Steve had failed the one person who had mattered the most in his whole life. Completely and utterly
Steve let out a stuttering cry as Tony suddenly latched onto one of his nipples, teasing the pert bud with his tongue. Tony alternated between circling it and flicking his tongue against it as Steve whimpered and moaned and writhed and
When Steve came back to himself, he was limp, boneless with pleasure, utterly satisfied and ears ringing--he’d been screaming, shouting Tony’s name, he’d--he’d come again, he was sticky and a mess, long ropes of come shot over Tony’s chest and across his own stomach, and hell, Steve wasn’t sure he even had it in him to feel
Steve shook his head solemnly. “Because the Knights of the Cross weren’t founded to destroy the Denarians, Tony. We exist to save them from the Fallen. We help them, however we can, get them to give up the blackened coin. The Fallen that inhabit the coins are the enemy, and their hosts just as much their victims as anyone else. The Winter Soldier is Orthiel’s victim.”
There is no back and forth of emotions anymore, the bond has been entirely overwhelmed and enlarged, and it no longer feels like Tony’s bond, but
Tony latches on to Steve’s neck with a sob, slams into him with a rough snap of his hips that punches a maniacal laugh of triumph out of the vampire, and knows he’s lost.
“Concentrate on Steve, Tony, and it will be fine.” Wanda’s voice is gently chiding as she takes her own spot outside the circle and lifts her hands.
Does Tony feel the same thing when he says it?  Does his world go warm and bright and blissful? Tony has never put much stock in words, but would those particular ones somehow be enough?
Steve briefly considered closing his eyes and feigning sleep, but he was a Knight of the Cross--the wielder of Esperacchius, the Sword of Hope, no less--slayer of vampires and all manner of ghouls and goblins, and he’d gone through a World War, fought a Nazi cult and their human abomination of a leader, and survived being frozen 70 years in the Arctic, only to wake up and immediately fend off an alien invasion. He could damn well face down his (exceedingly) angry lover.
"I’m still game for a date, though. I’d...maybe been trying to figure out how to ask you out for a while, and I’m still interested. Let's go scare up a good time. Hell, try to get me drunk." Steve quirked a grin at Tony's disbelieving snort. "It's doable, but it'll only last a few minutes."
Tony stopped partially off-road next to a small copse of trees along the wider edge of the road and made himself comfortable. The mp3 playlist switched over from Bush to Stone Temple Pilots, and Tony pettily decided that the cop wasn’t worth turning down
Steve strokes a hand along Tonys jaw, brushing along the goatee before cupping a flushed cheek in his palm. “I love you.”
Tony gave up the fight then, unwilling--unable, really--to move himself away from Steve’s fingers, and he rode the steady pumping thrusts with ease, letting his hips roll with the movements.
Unfortunately, overexposure to such a strong sensation began to work against him, and his scalp was tingling more and more sharply, the cooling sensation just a bit too strong, and he began to edge towards uncomfortable from the astringent effects of the tea tree oil.
Tony winds up falling backwards onto his bed, and Steve takes the initiative since Tony is stupidly clothed right now. Tony’s got
Steve shook his head ruefully. “Sorry about that. Hell of a ride though.” Steve would definitely be trotting this little interlude out on his lonelier nights.
“Let me make you mine, Tony.” He lifts Tony’s chin with the crook of his finger, staring deep into his soul as he twists the verbal knife with exquisite precision.
“More,” he pleads, and Tony rolls his hips, grinding against him as he steals more and more control back from Steve, makes him steadily come undone.
Tony’s got Steve's other hand now as well, stretching his arms wide to either side of them as he bounces him up and down from the sheer force of his thrusts. Molten heat shimmers through his veins and electricity goes down his spine as Tony relentlessly hammers against his prostate and lets his heart spill out past kiss-swollen lips.
It feels like forever before he finally works himself all the way down, and Tony lets out a sobbing gasp as Steve settles in his lap. Tony feels so good inside him, hot and hard, the stretch and heavy sensation of being filled so tightly making him tremble and pant as he adjusts in achingly intense stages.
The Blue Ādaraya, Thor had said, had the power to make the wearer entirely irresistible and could serve as a conduit for True Love. It had, at one point, belonged to Empress Theodora and later Shah Jahan, but it first belonged to the mystical sages of Vanaheim and was even more potent in the hands of a skilled magic user.
Tony’s stronger than him right now, but oh so attentive, and when Steve shifts his weight Tony moves with him, letting himself be rolled over in that massive bed so that Steve’s on top.
Tony, confronted with the proverbial nature of the beast, wondered if he could make it to the elevators before Steve caught him. He wanted no part of the looming disaster. Steve got very irrational about Ty.
climaxing, but no, he was just the sort that produced inordinate amounts of precome, the unusual but not unpleasant taste of him thick in his throat and Tony was certain he would never taste an apple again without getting harder than a rock.
Tony had thought that would be the end of it, that he would be offering up an apology and a blowjob for leaving Steve back at the starting line, but an erotically sinister laugh had registered over the rushing blood in his head, and then Steve had lowered himself to the floor so that he was kneeling with Tony’s back pressed flat against his torso and his still-trembling legs were braced on either side of Steve’s rather massive lap.
“Steve?” His voice comes out slow and wary, the ache in his stomach back and almost forcing him to double over, it’s so strong…
Steve sighed. “Pepper had JARVIS trace as much of the initial source as he could. There was a cameraman planted in the restaurant, Tony. A little digging, and guess who hired him?”
There is a picture of him walking Steve through Central Park. “Tony Stark, Satan Worshiper?” Below it in a sub headline, “Eccentric Billionaire Lets Sacrificial Battle Goat Run Amuck in Central Park.”
Tony’s briefcase crashed to the floor with a loud clatter that he scarce paid heed to, because...because…
but this time he kept it slow and light, and all the more intense for it. When Tony finally pulled back, Steve was unable to stop himself from trying to follow after him, but was met with Tony’s index finger, pressed lightly against his lips.
Steve dropped his mouth to Tony’s ear and traced the outer curve with the tip of his tongue before whispering “Touch me” and then nibbled on his ear.
There was a shifting of weight during one such moment, and then a massive hand tangled in Tony’s hair, the blunt edges of roughened fingertips holding his head in place as Steve finally let go of what little restraint he had left and took control. Steve let out a throaty, satisfied moan and began to fuck his mouth, running roughshod over Tony’s attempts to regain the upper hand.
His unwanted dinner guest smirks, as if fully cognizant of what Tony has done to clear his senses. “Cheater.”
“She reamed in the neck with a syringe, once. Just...shot me up with random drugs. No consent, no safeword, just strolled up and shoved it in there.” Tony pointed at his neck, which was absent of the deadly crosshatch that Steve had seen in his SHIELD file.
“By Love’s own hand, by craft and art, unbind, dismiss and fly apart! Through powers aligned this curse now fall, the form of old reveal, recall!”
“Shh. It’ll happen if it happens, but don’t worry about it,” Tony murmured in his ear as he moved from his back to his left arm.
sort of privacy in his life, and mandatory NDAs all around, backed by the most vicious pack of lawyers he could find.
“Holy shit,” Tony murmured reverently and paused behind him. Steve whimpered, first missing the sensation and then fearfully, realizing that Tony was planning out his next wave of attack. It was going to be wonderfully horrible and Steve tried to steady himself for it, but it was useless. Tony was quicker, fiercely relentless, and Steve found himself screaming his pleasure into the night as Tony unerringly hit his prostate with every thrust.
A twisting unease turns his stomach sour, and it’s everything Steve can do not to hunch in on himself.
It was so hot outside. Or was it just him? Maybe it was just him. He was so hot; his skin was flushed and sweaty and his shirt was uncomfortable on his back and sweat beaded his brow and dripped onto the windshield as he thrust as much as Tony would allow him, his intentions utterly derailed once again by this infuriating
An incredulous silence settles over everyone as they stare at the most patriotic goat alive. A few of the NYPD officers actually switch their aim over to Steve, not sure who to trust anymore. The Wrecking Crew are all just as stunned, and the only sound heard above the background noise created by the park at large is Thunderball’s plaintive, “
Steve’s third orgasm of the day sizzled up and down his spine before breaking over him, and Tony twisted and undulated as Steve pulsed deep inside him, tensing and straining and desperately pleading for Steve to finish him, and god, how could he refuse him? Tony had thrown himself so thoroughly into tending to Steve’s every whim,
Tony’s hand dropped from around his neck to reach for something set aside on the nearby shelf, and the distinctive snap of a tube cap being snapped open sounded just above the dull roar of the shower. Warm gel was liberally poured over his erection and Tony spread it across the rigid length with a feather-light touch that left Steve throwing his arms out so he could brace against the shower wall and not collapse on top of him.
He’d forced things to a head on the Quinjet, had forced them into a do-or-die confrontation. Tony had never answered if he loves him or not, but his actions... it had been
The black and gray marbled sunken tub that took up most of the northwestern corner of the room was filled with steaming hot water and a neatly organized assortment of bottles were laid out on the shelf carved into the matching marbled wall. A stack of the luxuriantly soft bath towels Tony preferred were settled on the nearby counter in the center of the room, and the massive shower opposite the tub was running, and Steve gazed longingly at it, already envisioning standing under the spray created by the massive rainfall shower head that reached across the entirety of the shower’s ceiling while the four horizontal jets--two each on the opposing walls of the shower--soothed away his aches and pains for a while.
Steve moaned desperately, arching sharply in an attempt to either escape the sensation or somehow shift the vibrator inside of him to a less sensitive position. It didn’t work at all, and all Steve wound up doing was writhing around on Tony’s ridiculously fancy satin sheets.
Tony sagged, head falling limply back against Steve’s chest and all his weight settling down into Steve’s lap so that his next thrust went deeper and deeper until every thrust hit directly against his prostate, and Tony wailed against Steve’s hand as pleasure, brilliant and overwhelming, surged through his body in an electric flash.
It was all rapidly becoming too much for him--he’d been right at the edge from the gloriously torturous blow job, and any lost ground from the initial discomfort of being prepped had been overridden by the fact that Tony seemed to be operating under the delusion that fingering him to incoherency was the end game.
“That is troubling indeed, but we are a learned and mighty lot. I do not doubt that between all of us, we might not uncover a way to right this mischief cast upon our bold Captain.” Thor rests a companionable hand on Jan’s shoulder, gesturing cheerfully with Mjolnir. One of these days Thor is going to knock out a light fixture. Tony just knows it.
the ones that dig their claws into your brain and never let go. The addictions drive a man to kill, to steal, to throw aside all reason and morality for the next hit, and there is no wine, no drug, no perfect sin quite like Steve’s blood.
be distracted away from it, could be overwhelmed with softer, headier sensations, and be made to forget for just a while. Tony--always a quick study--was rapidly mastering that particular art, and Steve was more than glad to reap the benefits.
“....I just offered you the juiciest promotion of your life and you’re swindling me for Girl Scout cookies?”
Wanda turns and hurls the mystic ball of energy straight at Steve, who lets out a panicked cry and collapses down on the shield like he’s hugging it.
Well, when it was put like that... “What will you need to do? Are there any sort of protections we can use to stack the deck in our favor?”
They were long, dextrous, and--especially important--well manicured. It was never a good thing to have raggedy nails poking around inside your most sensitive parts, and Steve had been on the wrong end of poorly maintained hands before. Tony’s hands were soft and only slightly calloused, and most of that only around the pads of his fingers. Realizing that he didn’t have that particular problem to worry about, Steve found it easier to relax around Tony’s fingers.
Steve laughed, bright and genuine, and good goddamn, but didn’t that take a few years off the man’s face. He’d originally pegged him at early thirties, but Tony wouldn't put Steve past twenty-eight now. They were of an age and Steve, Tony realized, was an achingly common byproduct of war: a veteran who had obviously gone through too much far too fast and never really come home. Tony decided right then and there that he was going to give Officer Steve Grant the time of his life.
Steve fell into step beside Tony, who had taken advantage of the brief lull in pedestrians to start moving down the sidewalk.
and a brilliant slash of crimson against the snow. Steve’s dead and Tony’s firing wildly at the shadows and horrors in his periphery and 19, 20, 21 shots for the honored dead, this shouldn’t/couldn’t/wouldn’t have happened if he wasn’t so
Steve let out a frantic whine and scrabbled for purchase when Tony braced one clever hand on the back of his neck, the other low on his hip, and plowed into his ass even harder. He was pinned in place and unable to do anything except writhe helplessly against the sloping candy-red hood of the S7 as he sought a release that was tantalizingly just out of reach. Steve was halfway to plotting murder or screaming in frustration, or maybe outright begging if it would do him any good, and Tony was still moving at that same infuriatingly leisurely pace, and good God, he was going to
They worked each other up slowly, Steve too large and wide to do anything except rub and push against Tony’s prostate with every thrust, and Tony so gone on it that his teasing had devolved into reflexive clutching and squeezing of his pecs. That was coupled with the steady swipe of Tony’s thumbs back and forth over his nipples, and Steve whimpered and moaned and groaned and panted and cried out louder and louder as his orgasm suddenly built up lightning fast. It wasn’t like the shower, where he’d been coaxed and played masterfully into one, or like the one he’d just had that he hadn’t even expected until he was there, cratered in the aftermath of it.
Steve’s hands are like steel bands, keeping him pinned to the floor as he latches on to the prickling nub with too-sharp teeth. Tony arches beneath Steve, bucks and writhes and squirms as he licks and sucks and teases. The sensation is almost too much, his nipple throbbing and burning from the attention, sharp flutters of pleasure in his stomach warring with the pulsing of his cock as Steve moves with and against him, chasing more of the groans and soft murmurs, all the more intense for the undercurrent of active danger.
Not that there had been much Avenging going on. Thor had been busy tracking down Loki, and Bruce had been puttering away at Stark Tower while Tony…
Steve broke the kiss and moved to lick and nibble at Tony’s ear as he walked them backwards towards the S7, somehow still managing to remain in control while Tony felt like he was about to go off at any moment, and he would resent it, he would, but that delicious grinding roll of Steve’s hips was making it hard to hold onto any sort of ill will. Or reason. Or restraint. “Oh fuck me, you’re bringing your A-game, sir.”
Tony went slow when Steve urged him to go faster and upped the pace when Steve adjusted to the slower, more languid pace. He used tongue and hands to urge Steve towards greater heights, pulled off and used feather-light strokes and teasing caresses to calm him back down, moving perfectly contrary to whatever Steve indicated he wanted. Tony was merciless, reveling in the increasingly frantic whimpers, moans, and profane litanies that dropped from Steve’s lips.
A fly buzzes in the background, the pitched drone of flight traversing the room with startling speed, first in the far corner, over towards the stagnant fountain water, then irritatingly close to the table. Tony shoos it away, breaks his gaze for a moment to make sure it’s gone.
“So, according to Natashlie, you’re a really sweet veteran that dabbles in art. She sent me a few pictures of the NYC skyline that you’d drawn.”
“You are almost out of time, dear.” Tony follows Maria’s gaze to the reflection of the neat bite mark on his neck. “He’s had his taste, and more than once for you to react so strongly. There is venom in your veins, Anthony.”
“You okay, Tony?” Jan, still shrunk down, settles on his shoulder and neatly crosses one leg over the other.
love in some part, no matter who was in the picture. There was history there that Steve would never touch, and Tony supposed it drove him up the wall.
“Orthiel...Orthiel was one of the Host’s strongest warriors, Tony. When the Archangel Michael flung Lucifer into Hell, Orthiel was there, casting out many of the Fallen after him. He went to the Northern lands soon afterward, and then...he Fell himself.”
Tony hadn’t been expecting it at all, and had shot off like a rocket, going up in a brilliant flare of light and heat and intense sensation that had sizzled along seemingly every nerve in his body and then rushed outward in hot, powerful spurts that seemed to go on and on.
Tony reached for Steve’s pants, and taking the lack of tasing or pepper spray as tacit permission, quickly unbuttoned them and yanked them down as far as they would go--which wasn’t very far since those ridiculously tight uniform pants tucked straight into Steve’s boots--as he sank to his knees in front of the Saleen. Tony managed to snag Steve’s black briefs along with the tan pants, and there his erection was, bobbing proudly out in the open for the whole world to see.
“You have a job and spend your free time working out or trolling joggers. That’s not a life. It’s just depressing.” Natasha shifted onto the balls of her feet and scanned the area, no doubt planning a swift--and deadly--approach.
Steve’s own ire rose. Tony had his point, but he was holding on to this slight like a dog with a meaty bone, and
“I trust you Tony, and I sure as hell wouldn’t be standing here right now if I thought you had, but you’re delusional if you think I’m supposed to not be at all bothered by any of this.”
The abomination has no right sounding so silkenly cordial, so teasing, as if they are striking up with a dear friend. Steve is even wearing a
Wanda straightens up, a decisive resolve settling on her shoulders. “This evening after dinner. I will need time to prepare.”
Tony gasps as Steve rocks up against his cock, his hole already slick and Tony could just glide right in, couldn’t he?
in his mind. Tony, naked and spread out on the bed, his eyes fluttering closed as he dropped one of those crafty fingers to his dick--Tony was so big, long and thick enough that he was easily able to backup everyone ounce of his swagger and dodge accusations of overcompensation--he would have slowly stroked himself until he was rock hard.
Steve rolled his eyes and folded his arms, and the khaki uniform top he wore--already snug on his body--stretched tighter. He’d been complaining for over a year that the uniforms didn’t fit him properly, but no one ever did anything except give him shit for being so damn large or look at him like he was crazy. And no, he wasn’t unaware of all the covert (usually covert) attention it got him. He was actually pretty certain someone was deliberately sizing everything wrong for him, but what could he do about it?
“I don’t need a concrete answer for another month or two. I’ll have HR put together an official offer once things are a bit more solidified. I just wanted to make sure you’d bite before I went any further.”
darling, you’re taking me so well.” Tony relaxed his grip on his neck just enough to scritch lazily at the nape of his neck, running his fingers through precisely trimmed blond hair. Steve tried to reply, say
, this time. Steve was ruthless, seemingly delighting in the fact that Tony had been knocked off balance and was rapidly losing more and more of his control.
There’s no way Steve’s going to come out of this on top, none at all. Wrecker has an enchanted crowbar that gives him and his cronies superpowers, and Steve’s a
There is a loud curse as Clint, Jan, and Carol approach, and Steve rolls his eyes when Clint slaps a bill into both Carol and Jan’s palms.
Tony goes still, disbelief warring with pure longing as he pulls in precious air to fight down the panic, the sweet amber and warm spices of Dior’s
The blue-white energy and red magic that has been crackling over the shield is suddenly entwined with warm gold light, and the three energies twine around each other, slamming through Steve and into the shield. Instead of dissipating, the energy is conducted through the shield and is instantly flung against the black tourmaline circle, and then the energy spreads out, following the flowing script and sigils drawn in between the circles until the whole thing is pulsing and glowing with the three different energies. Steve glows more and more as the spell takes hold, and then there is a flash of energy, much the same as when the amulet had originally exploded. There’s a shattering of glass in the background as a shockwave explodes out from the circle, knocking Tony ass over teakettle, and then everything dies down back into a strained silence.
