“Jarvis, hack into the computer in closest proximity to the tsum tsuit. Look for anything related to a plan to amplify puppet magic enough to spread it all over New York City, and send it to Bruce. I doubt Bob’ll get far enough to actually implement it, but the team might want it, just in case.”

Just remember to stay focused on why we’re here.

“Well… crap,” said Tony for lack of anything better to say.
“Better get to your point fast, detective, we’re running out of time,” said Clint uneasily as he eyed a few wisps of green swirling outside the window.

“Both of you shut up!” yells Natasha.
“Yeah, what’s Clint gonna do?” echoed Steve, disapproval practically oozing from the comms.
“Ain’t that the truth. Nat, you know Fury’s criteria for becoming an Avenger. Was ‘romantic taste for evil’ one of them?”
You pull back from the microscope and rub your eyes. Sometimes it’s hard being equal parts scientist and superhero but you, Dr. Bruce Banner of the Avengers, do your best to strike that balance between work in the field and work in the lab. When you look at your watch, however, you wonder if this time you’ve leaned a bit too hard on the scientist side; you’ve worked through the night again, without intending to. Your counterpart, the big green raging creature known as the Hulk, tends to be more inclined to assert himself when you go on work binges like this, which is why you usually leave them to your friend Tony. But you also know there’s no way you would’ve been able to get a good night’s sleep knowing the samples were ready to be categorized and documented. The results are less promising than you’d hoped, and you know you’ll eventually need to revisit your original hypothesis, but that’s tomorrow’s task. Right now you still have more categorizing to do, although you can sit back for a minute or two.
I think we have to wait until the next blog post, Steve. I dunno, I’ve never had my entire essence distilled into an internet comments section before.
“12:04,” said Tony.

“Rhodey, I hope your affairs are in order,” said Tony.
They were in the car driving up FDR drive on their way uptown. It was starting to get properly hot, and the sun was reflecting off all the new glass buildings across the river. Steve’s fingers itched to get out his sketchpad, but they’d be past the buildings by the time he even got down the outline, and he’d been told enough times that cars weren’t allowed to stop in the middle of the street anymore.
“Tony, either I am going crazy, or you just said you’re in love with me.”
“On the subway.”
“What? No it wasn’t,” says Tony.
“We were
“Here’s the thing though,” said Hammer. “What am I getting in return?”
Steve opened his mouth to protest, then closed it, knowing it was useless.
Tony was audibly crying with laughter.
“Broken nose,” said Steve, his head still tipped back.
“Ok. Who’s got an educated guess?” you ask.
“What? I mean, yeah, we’re friends now.”
“I just needed to get your attention. I know when I’m being humored, Steve, and if it was something less important I’d let it go. But I need to hear you say it.”
Tony looks like he’s going to object, but Steve cuts in with a, “You know what? Sandwiches sound great. Let’s go make some.”
“Sorry about that,” said Tony, “Bit of a hazard when you’re out with an Avenger. But we can still catch the game.”
“There is only one sure way to break free of this enchantment,” says Thor. “We need to find the artifact that is maintaining the spell on our home and destroy it.”
“Let me go out first for the HC floor, please,” said Bruce as he pushed the appropriate button. “I don’t really have a reason, other than it’s sort of also my floor, and I’d like to drive if it happens to have a driver.”
they were scheduled to see in a few days. When he was finished, Rhodey had a weird sort of smile on his face.
“What?” said Steve, who was barely holding it together.
“The point is, Tony’s not doubting for lack of evidence, he’s doubting because he’s got some serious personal shit feeding his delusion, and that’s something we can’t fix here.”
“No, it’s— ok, yes but that’s not—” Steve took a steadying breath, turned to face Tony and said, “Remember at the aquarium when I said I couldn’t promise you we would be together forever?” He reached into his jacket and pulled out the little square box that had been burning a hole in his pocket all night. “Well, it turns out I can.”

“I’ve been pulling Clint’s weight for years, he can pull himself,” said Nat.
“Mr. Hammer, there must be something else you want that you’d be willing to exchange for the scepter,” said Steve.

Then Steve was pulling him into an embrace, and Tony had nothing left in him to fight it. All he could do was let Steve hold him, and wish things were different. Wish that this could last. But it couldn’t. The sky was blue, water was wet, and if they ever got together then one day Steve would look at Tony and there’d be contempt in his eyes again. And if the thought of it hurt this much, actually living it might just kill him.
“Please tell me whatever asshole did this didn’t christen themself ‘The Puppeteer’,” said Tony as Steve laid him down on the stretcher.
“I’ll come back later,” said a small voice at the door.
Before Hammer could ask what the hell was going on, Tony Stark shimmered, then fizzled as the armor closed again, cutting off the projector for the image.
Could go for a few more educated guesses on where to start looking.
Then Steve’s hand was on Tony’s arm and his other hand was on the side of Tony’s face, guiding Tony to look in his eyes.
“So the difference between a slam poem and a regular poem is, what, emphasis?” said Steve.
“And maybe check out those quarterly repor—” said Pepper just before the line went dead.

Tony chuckled, and it made his chest hurt, which made the guilt he’d been hiding in the shower crash down onto him yet again.

“Tony, this isn’t a dream,” said a soft voice to his right as he was shaken again.
Commander Romanov, you have the bridge. Keep us alive long enough for me to get to cargo bay three.
“Doesn’t matter, they’re eating it up,” said Natasha, and Clint saw her kneel down and start unscrewing the vent cover from the wall.
Every emotion Tony had been holding back from the moment he’d met Steve surfaced at once, and before he was even conscious of it he wasn’t just kissing back, he was pinning Steve against the glass, his hands running over Steve's body and his tongue tasting the inside of Steve's mouth. It was like he was finally where he’d always been meant to be. It was like a wave that had traveled the entire ocean was finally crashing on the shore. But Tony just kept
I just wish they’d established in the (first, and in my heart the only) movie if he’s single.
They were near the top of the spiral, so they took their time walking down the ramp in silence. Steve knew if there was one thing Tony couldn’t abide it was silence, so all he had to do was wait and see what Tony was comfortable saying. Steve had once hidden in a tree for nine hours waiting to ambush a nazi caravan, and Tony had five coffee makers in his workshop because he could never wait for a pot to be full. He had a feeling he could wait Tony out.

Steve turned his head to look Tony in the eye, then held out his hand to shake.
“Where’s the artifact, you discount David Copperfield?” —Tony

“Magical artifacts are often immune to their own effects. Suppose, for example, the artifact is an enchanted chalice. If there were a floor of the tower entirely comprised of swords, it is unlikely it would be able to change into a sword to disguise itself.”
“I cannot say, sir.”
“I don’t know why you’re being weird about this,” said Rhodey as he fiddled with the ends of his chopsticks. “It’s ok to say you like spending time with the guy. Why would that be—”
Had that reason always been so pathetic?
You take a moment to choose your words and then say, “Thor, if I wanted to cast a fire spell, could I do it with a bottle of water?”
“What? Steve, Tony’s not in his lab.”

“Alright, let’s get the ball on the road,” said Tony.
Steve nodded, more curious than ever at what Tony had up his sleeve.
They searched under arm chairs. They searched under rugs. They searched under tables, and labels, and mugs. They searched under pillows, and under bedsprings. They searched under archery what-cha-ma-things.
“And now we’re at the end! Great! Good night, Tony,” said Pepper.

“I um, I made up the will,” Steve continued. “Everything’s going about where you’d expect it would. No surprises there for anyone to deal with.”
“No, Tony, I didn’t mean—”
Still consummate professionalism. Just a bit heavier on the consummation.

I don’t mind. What about you, Bucky?
haven’t you been answering your phone, Tony?” Rhodey snarled on the other end.
“I think there are some things going on that I don’t understand,” said Steve finally, “but let me address the ones that I do first. I should’ve listened to you when you said we shouldn’t go."
“I think Operation Stark Lark can make a tactical sacrifice for Operation Steve Smooch,” said Tony. Then he added, “Look, if your date sucks, just buy some extra cronuts or whatever, bring’em back to the lab, and we’ll commiserate over carbs.”
“Let’s get on with it,” said Clint as he settled down into the conference room chair. “I’ve got Knicks tickets tonight with a smokin’ hot neurologist and I’ve already cancelled on her twice.”

Busy as ever.
“Of course, sir”
“Tell me anyway.”
“Don’t bother, I have it in the bag this year,” Tony yelled back through the suit as it gestured for him and the others to leave, before it turned back to Steve and added, “Need a lift?”
STEVE steps back and puts one hand on the side of BUCKY’s face while the other is on his chest, the conflicting emotions of grief, joy, and disappointment playing over STEVE’s face as he touches his best friend and lost lover for the first time since he fell from the train.
Aww, sheriff, I thought I was your favorite.

“About what?”
“A project?” said Pepper.
“Do they even have trolleys to dodge in Los Angeles?” said Steve.
HAPPY blushes harder and walks behind the bar. NATASHA walks over to GALAGA GUY by the piano and playfully drapes herself over his shoulders. He jumps and plays some wrong notes at her touch, as if he’s been discovered doing something he wasn’t supposed to be doing.
“Yeah, well—”
“This,” said Tony as he drew Steve in for a kiss.
Tony practically leapt out of his seat and willed his heart rate down as he picked up some nachos for himself and an entire tray of chicken fingers and french fries for Steve.
No fish were harmed in Tony and Steve's escape.
Super old and very married. Also, this guy turned out to be a huge dick after the war when he jumped on the McCarthyism bandwagon.
“Yeah, I knew the ducks would get you, big guy,” says Tony, as he flies over next to you, then sits down with you.
“Oh y’know,” said Steve vaguely. “Have a nice time while I was drawing?”
12. INT. PEGGY'S ROOM - DAY
Tony leaned in close and said, “I know you were off-world for my origin story, Odinson, but the long and short of it is I’ve been where you are. I’ve made choices that have led to a hell of a lot of people getting hurt. Only where you did it to protect people, I did it to make a quick buck. But one day I got wise and I could’ve done what you want to do now. I could’ve run. But I

“Do you want something to eat?” said Tony in a rush, “There’s a whole buffet back here, and I know those hot dogs probably didn’t top you off.”
“Nope, too far. I will come up with at least a million scenarios to panic about in the walk from here to the kitchen. I’ve got a quarter million already. I need to know what you’re worried about.”
“I can’t even remember the last time I did karaoke,” said Natasha. Then she added, “Well, that’s a lie. I did it in Tokyo in ‘09 at a yakuza’s birthday party, but that was at a bar, not a noraebang.”
Sandra swallowed her terror and turned to face the woman behind her.
it was. They would remain forever stuck on that horrible, horrible first meeting in the helicarrier, when Tony didn’t know anything about Steve except he was Howard’s golden boy, which meant Tony had to prove that he wasn’t. And it didn’t matter that since then, Tony had realized Howard may have been full of shit about a lot of things, but he wasn’t about Steve. The damage was done. Steve would never, ever look at Tony and see anything but the little shit son of his wartime bff. The

“Great so… something small that doesn’t stand out. That narrows it down,” grumbles Tony.
It was after the game, and they were in the car back to the tower, which was considerably more comfortable now it was just the two of them in it.
“I’m not a trainer Nat,” said Steve.
“Alright, Mother’s Day this year, we’ll visit them both,” said Tony. “And now you know what my plans were I’m not telling you which of these I’m proposing at. Got to keep you on your toes. Also because I really doubt I can wait till Mother’s Day. The only reason I haven’t proposed already is because Pepper’s got your ring in a safe somewhere to stop me from doing it.”

to look away from Bruce’s collapsed form on the third floor R&D lab.
“But Sir—”
He plodded over to the lab’s bathroom and re-examined the damage to his hair. The second fire had taken out another patch of hair, plus a noticeable chunk of his left eyebrow. Perfect. He glanced at the drawer that contained his body hair clippers and briefly considered just shaving the rest off off. He squinted at the now bald half of his head to try and get an idea of what it would look like, and realized with revulsion that he’d look like Obie. Yeah, that wasn’t going to happen.
“Well now they
moved on somewhere else, Tony turned to everyone and said, “C’mon, we’ve got to get out of here, now the whole crowd knows we’re here.”
“Either you skipped a few lines in the conversation we were having or you’re seriously about to try to convince Captain America to steal an ice cream truck, and I sure hope it’s not the second one,” said Steve.

YouKnowWhoIAm
There once were six heroes who lived in a tower, and their super-friendship was their super-power. But one day it happened, without trace or hint— Those six became five. They had lost their friend Clint.
“What if you want to be an Avenger and I don’t?” said Tony quietly.
I realized as I was writing this chapter that technically cronuts weren't around yet in 2013, but I've decided in the aftermath of the battle for New York, some baker walked into his hulk-smashed cafe, saw a donut and a croissant smooshed together and went "by God, that's it" and invented cronuts a few years sooner.
“Where’s the damn switch? Actually, forget it, no time,” said Tony, as he stopped fumbling along the wall and rapidly unbuttoned his dress shirt to expose the arc reactor. “We need to get out of here before Hammer catches the scent.”
to make it work, though.”
“You’re gonna have to speak up, buttercup. That last orgasm literally melted my brain out of my ears,” said Tony.
“It’s a Kansas City shuffle scam,” said Natasha. “Make the mark
“Do I get an A+? Do I get to skip the final?” asked Tony.

“The Avengers are pathetic and so are you,” snapped Bob. “And none of this will matter by this time tomorrow. Now that we know the amplifiers work, by tomorrow morning I’ll have all of them powered up and ready to blanket Manhattan with my magic. Then it’s only a matter of freeing my brother, and—”
Tony dug his hands deep into his pockets to try and get some warmth back into them when he felt his phone there, still completely busted. As badly as he didn’t want to see or talk to anyone right now, he knew in his heart of hearts he should probably call Rhodey. Rhodey would know what to do about this whole clusterfuck with Steve, or at the very least he’d provide acceptable commiseration about it, and right now Tony needed whatever he could get. So he ducked into a Best Buy, picked out a fairly basic Starkphone, and took it to the checkout counter.
Ten minutes of explanation later, Bruce was leaning against the elevator bar, taking it all in.
And that gave Tony pause. Because there was real
“Excellent! Then it’s simply a matter of sneaking in and using your computer skills to open it,” said Thor.

That wasn’t a no.
“So what now? Get everybody else and search the tower for the artifact?” asked Bruce.
CLINT grins as everyone puts away their weapons.
“We’d be here all week if I had to list mine and sadly, we have more pressing matters,” said Tony. “J, dim the lights, mirror the tablet on the screen.”

“I love you too,” said Steve.
“Roger that. Somebody text Bruce, let him know he can leave. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got vents to crawl,” said Nat as she shuffled down the length of the vent, doing her best not to let the heavy scepter case dragging behind her make any noise.
Tony never could stay away from a pretty face in distress.
for it,” Natasha agreed enthusiastically. “Gonna need either a fiddle or a pig-in-a-poke to make it work, though.”
“You’re right. There’s nowhere that’s safe from me,” said Thor.
“You don’t believe me,” said Steve, and he sounded hurt that he wasn’t selling his act.
“...connecting with God,” said Steve warily.
I’m not—
“Please don’t kill me,” said Tony a little pathetically as he swung at her.
I’m sorry. I don’t know why I wrote that.
“For the plan I have in mind, we won’t have to,” said Natasha. “But if something goes wrong and we’re cornered, we might have to use violence to get out. I can promise it’ll be the least amount of violence available to us.”

“It’s too early to overthink, go back to sleep,” mumbled Tony into his pillow case.
CLINT and THOR have made a proper mess searching through the desk and shelves of the small JAILHOUSE. There are two cells, one empty and one with a lump of blankets in the corner, with a dirty bare foot sticking out and an occasional snore escaping as a DRUNK (40s, permanently drunk, mercurial, petty) sleeps beneath. Behind the desk is a bulletin board with various wanted posters on it with recognizable bad guy faces from the AVENGERS’s past, including one for IVAN PETROVICH offering a $1,000 award, and one for AMORA ENCHANTRESS, offering a $10,000 award.
“Jarvis wants you to know he finds that deeply hurtful,” chuckled Clint.
“Suit’s going to my private island off the coast of Australia. Can’t be called back from here. I’ll need to go get it myself.”
“Was I unconscious this long after my floor?” said Tony’s familiar voice, and Natasha felt herself relax. She allowed herself to show signs she wasn’t unconscious.
“If you had to sneak something into Avengers tower, would you do it under the noses of the trained spies?” asks Clint. “Maybe it’s just my ego showing here, but I think Nat and I are probably the least likely to have something snuck into our pockets and the most likely to notice if something shows up on our floor that isn’t supposed to be there.”
“You know, I had the strangest conversation at the supermarket today,” said Steve as he stirred the pan on the stove.
“Ohoho, who’s the oblivious idiot now? It says it right in the title,” said Tony, as he reached into his pocket and took out his keys. Then he took the list from Steve, and shone the blacklight on his keychain at the paper.
All are walking down stairs. At the top is Bruce, carrying the bird seed box and standing next to a target with an arrow in it. Below him is Steve, holding a hand above his eyes as if to look, and in the other hand is a wrapped pop tart. Right in front of him is Thor, who is holding his hand out to Steve as if asking for the pop tart. Below them is Natasha, who is kneeling and looking concerned in front of Clint, who is sitting and hugging his knees with his eyes closed and a tear dropping down his cheek. Visible from the side of the stairs, as if in cross section, is a skeleton in the dirt, shaped like a dragon.

“Well thank you, Tony son of Howard. So are you.”
“Do you ever regret it?” asked Steve. “Falling in love with me?”
Bruce shakes his head a bit and says, “It could mean that not only is the artifact not on Thor’s floor, but it’s not on the floors above or below it. The ‘more than a few steps’ might be the literal steps to another level of the tower,” says Bruce.
As the security guard dialed up Hammer’s office and people around the lobby took very un-subtle pictures of Captain America in the lobby of the Hammerplex with their camera phones, no one noticed Natasha Romanov, dressed as an office worker, slipping through the gate with a stolen key card, moving quickly to get to her next position.
YOU’RE DAMN RIGHT I’M FEELING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW
The ship lurches with the impact of the torpedo. Sparks fly out of CLINT’s comms panel, although luckily he’s unharmed.
Steve squeezed Tony around the shoulder, and said, “I’d like that. And look, my ma’s here too, at number six. It’s about time I introduced you two,” he said.

“According to the diagram, it should be there at the left junction ahead,” said Natasha.

There was dead silence for a moment, as everyone’s hair stood on end with a sudden abundance of static electricity.
It is so hard not to ask a question about the best way to de-seed a bell pepper right now.
Five minutes later he burst back in the coat check room, shouting, “I don’t know what kind of game you’re—”
“Jarvis, un-lock the door. Steve, meet me down here at 11:00 tomorrow.”
For lack of any better ideas, Steve decided to go visit Bruce’s floor of the tower.
“JARVIS, is what we’re saying true?” said Bruce.
Tony turned around and scowled. “There is nothing about this that’s pity, Steve.”
“Thanks for keeping everybody on track in your little skit, Bruce,” said Tony. “As much as I love improv, which is not at all, can I please go now?”
, what about you?”
Clint loosed an arrow at the same time Thor hurled mjölnir. The hammer was like a part of his own body, and it was easy as breathing to guide it to follow the arrow directly.
“Nope, gonna need you to go back to the original conversation subroutines, Jarvis,” said Tony as he got to his feet.
“Yes, your friends. And… and you know I think of you as my closest friend, right?”
Of course, how could I forget your disenchanted elevator? Speaking of which...
Madam PEGGY CARTER (mid-30s, professional, coy, affectionate) stands in the open doorway of the WHOREHOUSE in a red satin dress, fanning herself with black lace fan.
Of course that was when my beloved Jane came back from her work, so Clint will have to wait for another recipe to try, but luckily, dear reader, you don’t!
“We made a pact last year that we’d all go together,” said Bruce. “Tony’s the one who suggested the Pride show, since they do some fun extra stuff that night. And their last one this year is on Friday, which means it’s now or never.”

“Stop,” said Steve. “Give me your phone.”
“Something about this floor has us all talking over each other, and we all need to hear each other’s educated guesses if we’re going to get out of here any time soon,” you say as you rotate the shield a bit threateningly in your hands. “Now, who's going first?”
IVAN takes one of his tall stacks of chips and tosses it over to NATASHA.
“Yes, if you were a sufficiently powerful sorcerer,” says Thor. “However, it would be very, very difficult, since you would be fighting water’s natural properties. It would make more sense to use almost anything else. Why do you ask?”

Steve looked like he wanted to dissolve into the floor, and as strong as the urge was to tell lewder and lewder jokes until Steve finally broke and started fighting with him, so both Steve
You’ve got to be an especially incompetent therapist for a trans woman to come to your couch with dysphoria and come away with plans to make a skin suit.
“Thank you,” said Tony. “Now, I think we’re past the point of trust falls and we might well kill each other on a weekend retreat, but I came here to ask you if you wanted to try doing something together.”
Steve snorted, then (reluctantly?) slid his right hand out from under Tony’s and signed, “I was crying laughing when you mimed punching Loki in the dick. You didn’t see?”
“Come on! It’s— oh! You don’t know any of this music, do you?”

“We’ll make a lewd comic of you yet, Rogers,” said Tony as they walked out the bathroom door and into the restaurant. “Although if you think a restaurant bathroom is an uncouth place to have sex, I don’t know if I should tell you what happened later between me and Penny in that ice cream truck.”
“I invented new pigments just to get the stripes in the right color without the lead paint, you know.”
They climbered and clambered away up the stairs, to the top of the tower, out in the clear airs. They all looked around on the top of the roof, and they hoped to see Clint standing there all aloof...

“Did you have a dream when you were there?”
“Nothing, don’t worry about it Bruce,” says Tony quickly. “I just… need to talk to Steve and Nat about something real quick. Back in a sec.”
I turn to Donny and say, “Ah, listen. I’m flattered but I’m not looking for any, um… for any butt-pounding right now.”
“Hm? Oh, kind of,” said Bruce.
And Tony was speechless.
Steve walked down the hall and to the left from Hammer’s office, just like they’d planned, doing his best to look as confused as he could before slipping into the small conference room with a sheet of paper taped to the door that said, “Nursing Room, Do Not Disturb.” Sandra was the only one who needed it so they’d have it to themselves, and apparently people had gotten oddly skittish about nursing since Steve had been on ice, enough that a whole private room was necessary in the first place. Steve had a recording of the pump in action and Sandra shouting “I’m busy, don’t come in!” to play by the door in case any guards stopped by later, to amplify the effect.

“You’re the best, Tony,” said Steve, as he took the box and then promptly got to work demolishing everything in it. Ten seconds and four hot dogs later, he noticed Colleen was staring at him.

“Don’t care. She’s not invited to my birthday party,” said Tony, barely finding the energy to rub his wrists.
And Tony swore internally, because the damned filter on his mouth was supposed to catch things like that. But Steve always did have a way of getting Tony to talk around his filter.

“Yeah, let’s skip the trip to the uncanny valley until this is over. I’m closing in on Cap, what’s your ETA?”
“Why are Steve, Tony and Nat acting so weird?” you ask.
“Righty,” finished Steve, something like a smile curling the edge of his lips, even as he dodged another punch. “She has an accomplice.”
There's something that I hoped I made clear in this fic but in hindsight I want to spell it out. For Steve and Tony specifically, closing a door in Avengers Tower in front of them is the equivalent of dropping a bead curtain. In real life if someone loks a door in the direction you're going to keep them with you, that is NOT healthy or respectful of your boundaries and it absolutely counts as a red flag.
Tony took a deep, shaky breath and stood up with his hands over his head. The group of onlookers gave an amused titter now that the view of Tony’s genitals was unobstructed by the water, and Tony couldn’t stop himself from saying, “Oh
“Sorry, old habits,” said Clint, shrugging his shoulders. That was when he noticed that everyone was wearing what looked like Dr. Seuss versions of their combat outfits.
“His. He wants to talk to you.”
"We've found you!" said five of them shouting with glee. "I've found you!" said Clint, just as glad as could be. They hugged, and they couldn't believe that they'd found, their high-loving Clint, down so low in the ground.
“Mr. Hammer, I need to speak with you!”

“Where is this bad boy streak coming from? I mean it’s pretty hot so I’m not complaining, but you don’t” said Tony.
Wanted to add - just saying "no" should be fine, but if you're worried about looking rude, pay attention to what Steve and Tony did. "No" + move the ball into the other party's court on something else. "Don't touch the arc reactor" + "Can I send you a paper on arc tech?" and "Don't touch my abs" + "Do you want to take a selfie?" Other examples can be "I don't want to talk about my diet" + "Have you seen [movie]?" and "Don't touch my hair" + "Can I borrow your pen?"

“Do you really think you could keep me somewhere I didn’t want to be, Tony?” asked Steve.

“Is that so? This is platonic pining I’m seeing here?”
You roll your eyes and say, “Yes, the old man is old, but maybe… hey, could it be a TV or a smartphone? Something that could display examples of everything we’re seeing?”
“I know this probably doesn’t need to be said,” said Nat, looking around the room. “But I’d prefer if you all didn’t share this. I’d rather not spend the rest of my life castrating horny fan-boys trying to fix me with their magic dicks.”

“If I’d been given the mission to sneak something into Avengers tower, ideally I’d want it to be something small and easy to conceal. Something that wouldn’t stand out on an ordinary day, like a quarter or a pair of sunglasses,” says Natasha.
Steve leaned in and whispered in Tony’s ear, “You look good in a corset.”

Before Steve and Tony could debate whether to leave or stay, Clint spotted them and made his way over toward them. After a somewhat awkward conversation involving Tony’s phone doing speech-to-text (Clint had left his hearing aids at the tower), Steve coming clean about how much ASL he knew, and Clint marveling on the dumb luck that they happened to come do this item on their list on the one night a month Nuyorican’s did ASL poetry, they came around to the question they’d been debating at the door.

“We should runaway & make a band with Seve and Rony!!1” said Loki all excited.
Then the movie started and it was a lot more fun than Steve expected. The film itself was a weird mix of complete nonsense and pieces that resonated strangely with Steve, and the shadow cast (gender-swapped for Pride) was full of twenty-somethings happy to ham it up in feather boas and high heels for maximum ludicrous sensuality. Tony knew all the callbacks by heart plus a few of his own invention, and the movie ended with Steve blushing more from laughter than embarrassment. It was definitely one of the more bizarre experiences of his life, but Steve really enjoyed himself.
“Do I have to?” said Clint in an undertone.
“Somebody wanted to know if they’d figured out in the 21st century how a country full of normal people let a guy like Adolph run the show and murder all their neighbors,” said Steve, “and if there was a way to make sure it never happens anywhere ever again.”
“Bruce!” said Tony, disentangling himself to walk over and clap Bruce on the shoulder. “Good to see you too, man.”

Let’s hear it, then.
For one thing, Tony retained control over smaller movements. He could still move slightly, although not enough to run away or throw a punch. But if he moved slowly enough, especially while the other Puppeteer was busy doing God knows what on his computer in this make-shift sewer lair, Tony could shift his posture, change the position of his fingers, inch his hands closer to his pockets. That was until his captor noticed that was what he was doing, and he felt his arms immediately jerk back to where they were.

The last thing he heard before he blacked out was Steve shouting his name.

“Unidentified energy signatures being emitted from an unknown person in Central Park,” said Jarvis.
“I am in whatever state means you’ll let me go home and sleep until tomorrow.”
Steve had those absolutely gorgeous blue eyes fixed on Tony, and it felt like Steve was seeing right through him. Like if Steve kept looking at him like that, Steve would see how desperately Tony wanted to close the distance between them and kiss him until the room spun. And if Tony didn’t think of something quick, he might do exactly that.

ENCHANTRESS dismounts her horse, gives it a tap on the flank to send it walking off. She’s still holding the chain in her hand.
Steve felt the tension he’d been holding in his gut turn into something else. Something that had nothing to do with whatever he’d been worried about five seconds ago and everything to do with how Tony’s hand felt on his body and how soft Tony’s lips looked under all that makeup. Steve would’ve traded everything he owned right then to put his own hand on Tony’s cheek, and shrink down the universe even further, until there was nothing between them at all. But that wasn’t him. That wasn’t them. It never could be. So all Steve could do was look at Tony and

“Belgian,” Natasha corrected without lowering her pistol or looking away from Amora. Not even a minute ago they’d been sitting in a circle, with Inspector Steven Rogers and private detective Anton “Tony” Stark standing in the center of the room, the latter about to announce the identity of the killer of the Lord of the Avenger manor. Of course, since their own brains were casting the parts, the culprit was obvious, so before Tony could say anything, Natasha, the victim’s widow, had taken the bag from Amora, the maid, pulled the murder weapon out of it, and pointed the gun at her before she could try anything. Clint, the groundskeeper, was tying her up as they spoke, and Amora was not shy about voicing her displeasure.

what a year it had been. The collapse of SHIELD, finding out Bucky was alive only to lose him again, adding Sam to the Avengers, and Tony holding Steve’s hand when he came out publicly. They’d been through all of it, and it had only strengthened the home in his heart Steve had built with Tony. It was like having an anchor when before he’d had to go where the waves took him. Like he was lit with a candle on the inside when before he’d been reaching in the dark. Like all the glass panes that used to stand between him and the world were gone, and he was finally

“Except I came up with it, and I’m not giving you permission to use it.”
“It’s not the interpreters,” said Tony.
“No, Tony,”  said Steve as the elevator doors opened into the garage level. “Now c’mon, we’re going to be late for the matinee.”
“Is anyone actually going to enjoy this?” said Tony, who could always be counted on to say out loud the things everyone was thinking privately.
“Yeah, well, next time? Thor’s mashing the damned avocados,” muttered Tony. “Where is he anyway?”
“If you weren’t overthinking you’d be going back to sleep, starting your day, or making a move. You’re doing none of those things, which means you’re overthinking.”
“Oh come on, that’s a

“It’s not. We— I’ve been holding you back, Steve. We should— we should take some time apart to—”
“Look, if you guys are gonna lie to me like this, you’ve got to nail down the details a little better.”
“Sorry, continue, detective,” said Steve hastily. The green energy was now dissolving everything outside of the room.
“Can we please just— do we have to talk about this right now?” he asked weakly.
The alien attack on New York that Steve is referencing may be fictional, but after 9/11 New Yorkers really did line up for hours to give blood. It was actually the only time the NY blood bank has ever had all the blood it needed to fully stock all NYC hospitals. They've been running a shortage ever since.
“Oh God,” said Natasha. “Steve is gonna
“Agreed,” said Natasha. “The fact he thinks it’s an equal exchange says enough. We might lose more if he holds onto the scepter, but either way we still lose.”
“Friends!” shouted Thor when he saw Steve and Bruce, “Drink with us! The night is young and you are far too sober!”
“...I don’t know which of those names I hate more,” said Steve.
“Oh none taken. Steve’s my favorite too,” said Rhodey as he took another cup. He took a sip of his frozen hot chocolate straight from Serendipity, savored it for a second, and said, “Although Bruce did bring rainbow bagels to that joint Army-Avengers meeting last Fall.”
“What do you mean you wish it was?”
“Ok,” said Steve, who felt… like he still didn’t know what to do with that information.
Thank you for not hulking out, Bruce. Thor might’ve kicked us out if we smashed up his kitchen as well as his dining room.
“Why there?”
“Either you two need to start speaking out loud or we all start splitting up your PhD's so we can be in on the psychic conversation too,” said Clint.
“Yeah, me too. J, call Porchlight, let’em know we’re coming, and that Steve counts as a party of eight.”

Tony was wearing a wig, a full face of makeup, a corset, fishnets, and glittery, strappy black heels. And Steve immediately got the deepest blush of his entire life not only because Tony was looking like

Tony turned off the torch and headed toward the couch in the lab, which was really his bed far more so than the one in the room next door with the closets that contained his clothes. If there was one universal constant in Tony’s fancies it was that they were passing, so he’d just have to wait this one out. Tony was trying on a lot of new virtues since he’d been spending time with Steve: understanding, communication, mutual respect, and now, he was going to try patience.
Then Steve had his eyes closed, his forehead pressed against Tony’s, and his fingers in Tony’s hair, stroking gently.
“Do you want to know what I love about you, Justin?” said Tony Stark’s voice on the other end of the line. “You’re not just unimaginative. You’re
“What?” said Steve.
“What are the ones you said we could skip?” asked Steve.
with the rest of your lives, and you see if you match. But here’s the problem, Steve - once you have the future talk, you can’t un-have it. If you find out that one of you wants to settle down in podunk Oklahoma and never leave, and the other one wants to join the circus and move from city to city once a week, then from that point on you know you’re dating on borrowed time. And you can keep the relationship going for a while if you want, but you know that it can only be for fun, not for keeps. That eventually, you’re going to have to break up.”
“Yep we’re good, Cap,” said Bruce as he got to work on Tony.
“No, we talked about this,” said Bruce. “Give me some research to do or some experiments to run and I’m golden. Put me in a high-stakes heist and I’m gonna fall apart. And we know what happens when I fall apart.”

“How much farther do you have to go, Widow?” asked Steve.
“Wait,” said the guard behind Natasha as he put down his gun on the table and raised his hands over his head. “Wait, we’re with you.”
“I remember you dropping the shield you were laughing so hard.”

to pretend he was too shy to come up close so the driver would have to come out to him, and then stole the truck to drive over to the party. And you know what the kicker is, Steve?”
Alright, Steve wanted a fight? Tony could give him a fight. He reached back in his mind and found the tent poles that had been holding up his justification for staying away from Steve and brandished them like lances against an onslaught.
The blush spread from the apples of his cheeks, like a rumor in a church on Easter Sunday. It was sweet, but it stung a little, having that reminder that at the end of the day, he was just a lost kid in a lonely world. The captain might have come here as a prank from the guys at the station, but he still had a look in his eyes that spelled ‘danger’. Something was weighing him down, something big.
Tony looked up and smiled. Everyone else either rolled their eyes or sighed.
“Well, some people have guideposts they want to hit at least. Do you want to… run for president, write a New York Times bestseller, become a foster parent, start a business, be a movie star—”

“I resent that. My usual ripped jeans make my ass look much better than these do,” said Tony, turning around to illustrate his point, and utterly oblivious to the blush creeping up Steve’s neck.

“Wh— Nat! Get off!” shouted Tony. They were hovering a few feet above the landing pad now. Natasha was clinging to him like a limpet, but Tony knew if he took off any higher he’d have to take her with him.
Clint turns to Thor and says, “Seriously?”
Clint blinked and said, “I’m sorry, were we just—”
He and Olivia had unwittingly forged a relationship somewhere between crazy uncle/weirdo niece and mentor/mentee back when he and Pepper were dating, starting when Tony showed up to Olivia’s family birthday party with a raspberry pi as a gift. Tony didn’t see what the big deal was at the time. Obviously anyone who makes a blog for their Barbies is going to be interested in Barbies
Tony was about to tell Clint exactly where he could stick his phone when he felt someone grabbing his elbow and forcefully hauling him out of the kitchen.
“It’s not important,” murmured Steve as he placed a kiss on the crown on Tony’s head.
“First, please kill the music, I’m about to spontaneously combust with sheer kawaii energy. Then send the following message to the team’s cell phones,” said Tony as he braced his hands on the top of the casing. “Hi, guys. Sorry I missed movie night. It turns out the Puppeteer has a brother and they were combining their powers. I ran into him in a sewer workshop below where we fought today, but he escaped and I can’t go after him. Don’t worry, I’m fine. But he’s got puppet magic amplifiers set up around the city and he’s planning to set them all off tomorrow morning. First name is Robert, about five and a half feet tall, brown hair, wearing some embarrassing-looking multi-color bad-guy spandex and a domino mask. He said the guy we caught was his brother, maybe start there? I dunno. Please don’t come after me, I really am fine, and I’m not in danger or wounded, I promise. Ok Jarvis, you can send that.”

“Faith. I’m never going to stop being an atheist. If you can’t live with that or if you decide it’s your life mission to show me the light, this relationship is over.”
Tony turned his face away from Steve. Every single thing about this was hell. The second they got out of this mess Tony was kicking the Avengers and everything there was to do with them out of the tower, because they were responsible for this, and there was nothing he had ever experienced worse than Steve saying out loud and with complete certainty that he was miserable because Tony didn’t love him.
“I know. Weird way to get a new best friend, huh?” said Steve with a grin.
Give me a minute, Thor...
Steve looked around, then reached up to the top of his collar, and flipped it inside out.

Ultimately, all Tony got was a splinted finger, some extra-strength tylenol, a short stint on an IV drip, a crap-load of gatorade and a ride back to the tower.
“What did Dr. Mitchell say about you being so hard on yourself, babe?” said Steve.
...There we are! Just in time after all. Hulk, be a dear and kill your friends for me.
“JARVIS, call the elevator,” said Tony, because he wasn’t sure he had it in him to so much as press a button right now.
“The other guy’s not coming, you can stop worrying,” said Bruce. Then his thoughts caught up to him and he said, “Wait, I’m— the other guy wasn’t just here, was he? Did you dress me or something?”

“Are you alright, Dr. Banner?” asked the tech who was with him, a twenty-something year old with long braids and green nail polish.

My perspective was pretty limited, being two-dimensional and all, but I remember a lot of round things. Bottle caps, buttons, earrings, marbles… and I don’t think anything there was bigger than an orange or smaller than a washer.
“I’m fine, thank you,” said Steve, as he did his best to make himself comfortable in a seat that was clearly designed to make whoever used it feel small and uncomfortable. The giant portrait of Hammer looking down at him to his left and the full Captain America suit he was wearing did nothing to make him comfortable either. But he knew the effect the image of his gear had on people, and he was going to need all of it if he was going to be successful at what he was trying to do here.

“Calling janitorial office.”
“But you’re blonde! That counts for something.”
“You know the comms are still hot, right?” said Clint.
“Lucky you,” said Steve. Then he added, “Can I ask what your plans were, or will that ruin the surprise?”
From this point onward, there's a picture of each Avenger on their dedicated slide

“Yep,” said Tony, popping the ‘p.’ “One arrow and one lightning strike is all it’ll take.”
“Tony, this might be the last time we spend time together for a while,” said Steve, as he walked over to look at one of the tropical fish displays. “Let’s be adults and look at the damn fish.”
“This is probably the most excitement the Christmas party’s ever had,” said Frank with a chuckle.
and Clint had another picture of him in the hat.
“Hey, Tony,” said Natasha directly into the suit’s earpiece, “Time for movie night!”

Steve laughed and said, “And what if you’re right?”
Either she saw me press the button for Steve’s floor or she changed it as a precaution once she heard me say I knew what and where the artifact was. Looks like the search is going to be more difficult than we thought.
This recipe is so incredibly easy, part of me shudders at the idea of calling it a recipe. When I asked my dear friend Tony what he thought, his reply was, “Oh my God, you’re a recipe blogger. Guys, we’re in a recipe blog. Thor, the only man I know who can burn a salad, is running a recipe blog, and now we’re in it too. This is hilarious.” (Tony does tend to go on strange tangents. Sometimes, it’s hard to believe such a genius can be as dense as this, but I’ve seen his workshop with my own eyes. While Midgard is still far behind my own home in terms of technology, he is quite brilliant for his time).
“Wouldn’t blame you if you did. I’ll keep in touch,” said Natasha as she left the car.
STEVE runs his hands over BUCKY’s buttons and pockets, casts final, wistful glances at both BUCKY and PEGGY, then his hands drop to his sides and he straightens up and goes back to play-acting the Sheriff.

Steve took Tony’s closed hand between his, kissed each of the knuckles, then opened it enough to pull out the roots he was holding. Without taking his eyes from Tony’s face, he tossed them over his shoulder and into the wastepaper basket.
Tony looked quizzically at Steve for a second, then said, “Somebody’s been reading.”
“Laying it on a bit thick there, Steve,” said Tony over the comms.

“Please narrow request parameters,” says JARVIS.

Very big of you to let Tony have his way back there. And wise to get Steve to watch him. In a whorehouse. I’m sure that won’t dredge up any suppressed emotions.
So Tony turned toward Steve and as much as he didn’t want to open that wound, he did try. He tried to imagine someone as good, and kind, and beautiful as Steve Rogers, the scrappy kid from Brooklyn who never knew when to quit, who chose what he felt was right even when it was hard,
Bruce straightened up and took stock of his situation. He was clothed, in an elevator with Steve, Nat and Tony, and he had been unconscious a moment ago.
“...ah. Dammit, I knew I should’ve hacked his browser history. I’ll add that to the list of things to check for in the next one.”
“Sarah Rogers and you would’ve gotten on like a house on fire,” said Steve.
“Do you want to leave the team, Tony?” asked Steve.
Clint squinted at Tony’s phone screen, then signed, “Sandwich?”
>GIVE CLINT ENERGY BARS
“Slowly, slowly, it’s too nice a job to rush,” said Tony with a wiggle of his eyebrows, which made Steve blush (and get) harder.
For the record, "nudibranch" is pronounced either "NOOD-ee-brank" or "NOOD-ee-bronk"
But before Steve could even panic, Tony was standing between him and the camera, striking a pose, then blowing kisses to the crowd. Then he turned around and shouted, “WHO WANTS A SMOOCH!?” to the area around them. And as soon as hands started shooting up, Tony was kissing everybody around them. Everyone in the stadium was cheering, except Steve, who was currently stewing in a combination of panic, relief, confusion, embarrassment, and a strong desire to get the hell out of there. And Doug and Colleen didn’t look too happy either.
Tony passed by the room full of festive decorations and what was undoubtedly the party planning committee putting the final touches on a truly pathetic-looking Christmas party (not even a DJ, just an iPod in a speaker) and walked over to the room with a sign that said “Coat Check” scotch taped to the door. The pings on his phone were getting stronger.
“I’ve got this, Steve!” shouts Tony, who is now buzzing around you.
“Jarvis, how much whiskey is in the liquor cabinet?”
“Did you think he was dating the hot chocolate?” said Tony, as he clasped Steve on the shoulder. “Steve’s making a heroic effort to escape single life and while I will miss him in bachelor-dom, I commend him for his efforts.”
Clint buckled the helmet under his chin and picked up the shield. He was a little less broad than Steve, and his chin was more rounded, but with the helmet and the similar build, you’d have to look hard to see he wasn’t who he said he was.
“You can work and read at the same time?” asked Steve.
Tony leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes, tipping his head back until it thunked painfully against the wet bricks of the building.
...This isn’t your fault, Thor.
“I’m right here, you know,” said Tony irritably.
“That,” said Steve, “is an astonishingly terrible day.”
, ok? It was gonna be romantic as
Steve was about to say something affirming but Tony's tone was hard when he continued, "Let me explain what I mean, Steve. Someday you might have two choices. The first one is easy and saves the day, but it’ll mean… it’ll mean you don’t come home. The second one is hard, nearly impossible, risky, but it saves the day
Steve slipped on his pajama bottoms and Tony put on a robe, and they opened the curtains of their hotel room and looked out over Times Square. There was confetti in the air, the ball was at the bottom of the pole, and “2014” was lit up brightly at the top of the square.
“Tony? Tony, are you ok?” said Steve, sounding a bit frantic.
Tony tapped his chopsticks to his chin.
“You get me, Doug,” said Tony, as he fist-bumped Doug. “But I still love coming to baseball games. There’s something about the peanut shells under your feet and the organ music and the lulls in the game when you can talk to the people next to you that makes it all just so damn
“Are you trying to pick a fight right now?”
“Don’t tell Pepper,” said Tony.
“I have several messages from members of the team asking for Sir’s location. What shall I tell them?” said Jarvis’s voice emanating from both the open clam shell suit and the computer’s speakers.
“The one picking your moves isn’t seeing through your eyes,” gritted Steve, “Which means—”
What the hell was going on?

Jade shook it with both hands (or, the hologram made an approximation of shaking it), and said “Oh

One thing this movie got right, mediocre white men in positions of power are scary as shit.
The year is 2030. You’re standing on a pile of rubble that used to be the Empire State building. Judging by the position of the stars, first watch is about to end, and you’re looking forward to getting a good night’s sleep, albeit with an empty belly. For a moment, you think back to your old life, when you used to look up and long to see the stars in New York City. You belatedly wish you’d combed the tower for a monkey’s paw.
Give it up, Enchantress. One way or another, we’re getting out. You can’t keep us here.
There is some good news here. She wouldn’t have had to change the floor if she’d had time to move the artifact. And she wouldn’t have changed it at all if you were wrong.
“Aye,” said Thor from where he was standing, scratching his beard. “Many a night has been spent here in this room, listening to him wallow pathetically over your lack of returned affection.”
“And yet, I don’t ever get tired of saying it,” said Steve as he stroked the side of Tony’s face. “I love you, Tony. I wouldn’t ever want to love anyone else.”
“Did you really have to promise not to make scans of the documents or tip off the police about them?” asked Steve over the comms.
“Look, Steve, if we can’t hang out unless I keep it PG around you, I will try to figure out a way to do that. It will suck, and I will be less fun to be around, but I will do it. But I don’t think I’d be doing you any favors. I’m sure you’ve noticed by now that pretty much everything is a lot more explicit these days and if you want to spend the 21st century living in fifty shades of red that’s your prerogative, but personally I think it’d turn out better for both of us if you could stop doing your impression of a magenta crayon any time anyone says anything about sex.”
“Shhh,” Tony purred into Steve’s ear, just before he nipped at it gently.
“Nah, you were apologizing in the only way you knew how, because God knows I didn’t give you any other ways to do it. I was a real jackass, and I’m sorry.”
“I’m a completionist about this,” said Tony. “Besides, I can’t leave Steve high and dry.”
“You knocked on my door at MIT and said, ‘This asshole won’t stop complaining that my music is too loud, please deal with her,’ then you

“I think I was the Hulk too?” said Bruce, who was looking down at his now shirtless torso.
“Your turn,” said Tony as he reached out and made a grabby hand at the case.
“I’m fine, Bruce, really,” said Steve, who was already walking out the door in case his face betrayed how not fine he was, “I’ll catch you later.”
“So adoption, if ever. I can live with that,” said Tony.

his eyes were dry. He must’ve been staring at the wall for a long time.
“I may have underestimated your commitment to verisimilitude.”
Tony whirled around and said, “Give me three seconds to get changed, then let’s get the fuck out of here.”
“And every time I asked you how your costume was progressing you said, ‘Don’t worry, I’ve got it,’” said Tony.
“I’m alright! Jarvis, talk to me, tell me what’s going on,” said Tony as he tried and failed to lift his arms, leg, head. The motor control mechanisms were clearly busted, but if he could just access Jarvis, he could probably get them rerouted and get back into the fight. But of course, he couldn’t reach Jarvis at all. Which was just fucking fantastic. Two seconds into the fight and the suit was completely offline.
Hammer slipped right back into his pitch for Hammertech for another few minutes, before they were interrupted by someone running across the hall.
“I thought you and I weren’t planning this until tonight,” said Tony.
you’d try to kill me for it.”
“Fuck this spell,” they all did groan.
“Hey, have you set up the movie yet?” said Tony as he grabbed the remote from the common room table. Tony thanked the lord for his teenage preoccupation with escape artistry and sleight of hand, which allowed him to press the right buttons to get to the movie options for the TV while opening the secret compartment in the bottom of the remote and pressing one of the three panic buttons inside.

“It doesn’t matter! I’m the team leader! What the hell is the point of having a team leader if you’re not going to follow their lead?”
“What the hell is this?” he asked no one, before leaving the vault.
Steve’s thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the elevator dinging behind him. He turned around and immediately felt his blood pressure go up when he saw it was Tony.
"Free trip to Rome for a recipe blogger," said Tony with a little self-satisfied smile. "Thor never stood a chance."

Nat only watches fighting-related sports. Clint watches archery religiously and enough soccer to make it easier for him to blend in when he's under cover abroad. Tony sometimes tunes in for formula 1 racing and battle bots, and he sponsors a ton of high school robotics teams, but he can't really pay attention to anything that isn't a project or a party long enough to get into it. Thor thinks every sport is great but lost his shit when someone introduced him to
Which of course made Clint go crimson and start a litany of apologies that weren’t necessary; Steve knew this adjustment was going to be the hardest on him. But all around, they were truly making an effort to respect his boundaries, and Steve was so, so grateful he had the friends he did.
“Yep. Those sound like things that I said,” said Pepper.
“Ok so, why continue then? Sounds like the job is done.”
“You’re right about that,” said Steve evasively.
They smooched.
“Didn’t sound right to me either, but that’s the only explanation I can think of for why I hadn’t seen it before she showed it to me on her phone. And when I came back to the tower to watch it again, JARVIS couldn’t find it. At least, he couldn’t find it for

Gonna start this by saying Tony and Steve have the right idea in this chapter - never go to Times Square for New Years Eve. It's cold, the portapotties are gross, there's nothing to do but stand there for hours, then after midnight it takes forever to leave.

Tony was going to make a quip about having a hair braiding night, but it died in his throat when he noticed Steve, looking like a kicked puppy as he cradled his maybe four-inch shield in his hands.
“I have no idea what any of these mean, but I’m proud to stand with you,” said Thor, which was when Tony realized his cunning scheme had a Thor-sized hole in it. Technically a Steve-sized one too, not that it mattered in his case.

“Alright, sounds like the lunch rush has reduced to a trickle, and I’ve got all the information I need here.

a good pick for Tony. He was this sort of beefy blonde art history professor (Seriously, Pepper? Haven’t you ever seen Tony at an art museum?), and Tony was dutifully talking art with him but Steve could tell his heart wasn’t really in it.
Murphy’s jaw clenched and his eyes narrowed.
It was early in the morning the Sunday after Rocky Horror and they were gathering in the living room, getting ready to take their place to march in the Pride parade. Clint had to go back to his floor of the tower to get more comfortable shoes because he’d assumed, incorrectly, that Tony had commissioned a float for them to ride in.
Hello! I'm Thor, and I am simply delighted you've decided to partake
Why do they always monologue?
“What’s type C?” asked Steve.
Steve debated saying something, but Tony was already in his zone. At best Steve could expect grunts or one-word replies until he was done with whatever he was working on. So Steve turned and left the lab.
They went back to making out for a while, but Steve broke away to ask something that was niggling at him.
He wasted no time getting back to his floor on the tower, but he had a hunch a few SI employees had snapped pictures of him on his way to the elevator. He confirmed that hunch when he made the mistake of checking Twitter and saw that #TonysHats was trending. And half the tweets were asking if Tony had shit his pants. Thanks a lot, Clint.
“Mr. Hammer, that scepter is an extremely dangerous magical artifact. It’s not safe here.”
The hell had he done to earn
“Pepper had a point,” mumbled Tony as he watched Steve get farther away until he disappeared into the crowd. “This
“Doing what?”
Tony chuckled and said, “If I didn’t, every date I’ve ever had would run screaming for the door before we even walked through it.”
Who here knows how to ride a horse?
“Well, by all means, take your time telling us, then,” says Tony impatiently.
“I’m trying, Pep, but he’s such an asshole sometimes. And that turns me into an asshole, and then we get sucked into the asshole vortex, and everything ends up worse than where we started.”
Tony thought, but he said, “Hey, are you sure this is enough potatoes? Pretty sure Thor’s going to need this many just for himself.”
BUCKY
“Yeah, ok,” said Steve half-heartedly.
“We do. Because if we don’t, it’s going to hang over our heads until we do talk about it. And I’d rather do this on a day that couldn’t possibly get any worse already. So go ahead, Steve, lay it on me.”
“I don’t give a damn about the hat.”
“It’s not ballet. You’re not being trained. Everyone here is safe.”
Steve shook his head.
“I’m not sure what you were trying to accomplish here,” came Bob’s muffled voice from the other side of the casing, “But it sounds like you forgot to account for the fact that you can’t enact the manual override while you’re under the influence of my magic. I’m going to revise my earlier statement: clearly the Avengers are pathetic
“Just send me an email with whatever you want and JARVIS’ll get it to me” said Steve over his shoulder, as the elevator doors opened.
“And is it working? Are you fighting all the time anymore?” asked Rhodey.
be easier with a distraction, though,” Natasha mused.
"Oh where could he be?" said the one who's called Steve, "He could be in Boston, or London, or Kiev. We haven't a clue, and we haven't a hint, of anywhere, any place where we'll find Clint!" "I miss him so much!" said the one who's called Bruce, "From the top of his head right down to his caboose." "We miss him so much!" They all wept and cried. "But where could be be? Oh, where could he hide?"
from you.”
“If Enchantress managed to find an encyclopedia current enough for a Chuck Tingle page, she deserves to keep us trapped for a bit,” says Tony.

excuse, but Strange cut him off and said, "Captain Rogers, we may not have much time. I understand you're upset, but if you'll let me speak, then we can get to the part where we rescue your friends from a malicious sorcerer. So please." Strange gestured at the empty armchair across from him.
“Steve, you don’t have to tell me anything you’d rather keep private. You got a nerve struck. Happens to the best of us.”
“I know to the rest of you it looks like it’s fun to design quinjets while half-drunk with exhaustion, but sometimes it’s really painful, existing with a brain like this. I don’t want to risk passing that on to someone else, least of all my own kid. As for whether I want to have kids at all, the jury’s still out. If you’d asked me two years ago I’d’ve said not a chance in hell but sometimes I look at you and I think, maybe. Maybe with you.”
“Why?”
Steve held the plastic tub up to Tony’s chin to catch the petals with one hand and stroked Tony’s hand with the other.
“No. But maybe someday.”
As soon as Nat said it, it was confirmed by the delighted squeals of the women around Clint.
Does not seem to be beholden to restraints or wounds or death.

Both STEVE and TONY look uncomfortable for both the same and different reasons.

The spell is getting stronger. It’s like there’s a current to it now, guiding our actions, pulling us along if we’re not careful.

“Because that way you can go back to the car and play grab ass while... oh my God, I have been kicking myself for so long that I didn’t figure out we were dating all that year until Bruce said it, but my subconscious had it figured out from the fucking Guggenheim!”
Tony sighed and said, “Do you really want to be an Avenger for the rest of your life?”
Being puppeted was different the second time around.
Tony scoffed and said, “Yeah, well, having absolutely mind-blowing sex with you the second you get back home has a way of shutting down some of the doubt that grows back every time you leave my side for five seconds.”
“What? No! I’m an asshole but I’m not

“But not for me,” said Steve.

“You had a suite this whole time and we still went down to the field?” said Steve.
“Steve tried to force you somewhere you didn’t want to go,” says Tony as he reaches down to help you up.
Tony looked at the floor and fiddled with the empty coffee cup. “I know your frame of reference is a bit skewed, but I live kind of an unusual life, Steve. And I want to do unusual things with the rest of it. My likelihood of finding forever with
So Tony and Steve headed inside to find their seats, and Tony hoped Rhodey and Pepper discussed whatever they had to in order to cut the crap. Although apparently not, because before they were completely out of earshot, Tony heard Pepper say, “Are our friends really this stupid, Rhodey?” and wow,
Much as I’m enjoying exploring your accent kink, I should probably tell ye we just got phasers back online. I’ll have torpedoes in a few, but shields aren’t going to last if we keep taking knocks like this.
You barrel through your fight-friends and through the wall, and go towards a place where you can see large windows and natural light. You ignore the couches and chairs and stacks of books you run through and immediately begin to pound your fists against the windows. It’ll take a little time for them to give way, but nothing can withstand your fists and your rage for very long, and they’ve already begun to groan and crack.
1337 was stupid.
The repulsors fired. Tony could feel the case rumble as it slid rapidly across the floor.
They picked a row in the back so people would watch the show instead of them, and Steve sat down with Clint on his left and Tony on his right. They spent the evening watching performers get up on the small stage with the brick backdrop and do improv, tell jokes, and, eventually, share poetry. Clint performed an absolutely hysterical
There was a beat, then Tony said, “Christ, how do we keep getting sidetracked like this?” as he moved away from the table and rolled his shoulders. “Ok, ordinarily I’d have you run the scenario again until you got the hang of saying ‘no,’ but the whole point of social engineering is that it preys on your inability to know what’s coming next. So I’ve got a couple more scenarios to throw at you, some with social engineers and some without, and I’m not going to tell you which is which, or which of the holograms in each scenario are the con artists. The goal is to get you to start listening to your gut about your bodily boundaries no matter what the situation is. Got it?”
Tony felt his feet take him over to the proverbial scene of the crime and he ducked under the police tape to have a look around. There was a small crater where his suit had landed, lots of trampled grass, and that damn oak tree he’d had to fight around. It was all the same as he remembered. There was nothing new to explain Tony’s persistent questions.
Nathan's annual hot dog eating contest on the fourth of July is an event anyone who's spent a significant amount of time in NYC has at least *heard of.* And every year the question is whether Joey Chestnut's gonna break his record again (although recently he's tied with some other competitive eaters). I'd say google a video of it, but um... it can be a little nauseating to watch the man work.
Hell yeah it is.
It was empty, except for a flip phone sitting on the table in the center of the room, next to a piece of paper that said, “For Justin.” Almost immediately, it began to ring.
Immediately, the warehouse resonated with gunfire from the rafters, as a dozen members of the Sokovian mafia fired on Tony.

Oh dear. Sounds like you really might have. I’m sorry, Tony, Rumiko’s picked up and moved to Defender, but she’ll be back next week to take the rest of her belongings.
“Jarvis?” said Tony quickly.
“God, you came so close to winning, didn’t you? Real fuckin’ shame your son gave that tell-all interview to Barbara Walters about you kicking him out on his ass when he came out. You might’ve weathered that storm 20 years ago, but the times they are a-changin’, aren’t they dipshit?”
That got Tony’s attention. He put down the soldering iron, and spun around on his stool to face Steve.
And… did they walk through the fucking looking glass? Where the hell did
“Whose party is it?” you ask.
Tony could see Steve now, taking shelter behind an oak tree. A teenager with tomato-red and purple–highlighted hair and a black patent leather coat (why did the magic users always look like fanfiction Mary Sues?) was surrounded by a shield of blue light that emitted blast after blast at him and Natasha, who was darting from tree to tree, trying to draw fire away from the civilians still running from the scene.
. This was
Wait! Wait, guys, are you feeling something right now?
As they anxiously watched the monitors for the third floor lab, the monitor to their left showed a vent cover falling from the ceiling, immediately followed by a woman landing in a crouch.
“Mr. Hammer,” Bruce stammered, “I— ah— thank you for—”
I have been vibrating out of my skin in an attempt not to spill the beans on this epilogue update, and I'm so glad I can finally share it with you all!
“I never said anything,” said Rhodey.
“No, we’d get a notification if it had. The security camera in front of the vault showed nothing, but—” José licked his lips. “But it’s possible someone was there when Dr. Banner was— was having trouble a few minutes ago. We had to coordinate the security response and we might have—”
Steve set his jaw and looked back at the front of the theater.
Tony lost it. And then Steve was laughing too, which just made Tony laugh harder.
I take back everything I said about keeping the Thor who can cook.
They went on like that in silence for a bit, with Natasha practicing on the bag and Steve holding it in place. About 20 minutes later, Steve went to go sit on the side of the boxing ring in the center of the training floor. Natasha grabbed a sports drink and sat next to him.
For a moment, neither of you does anything but sit there, looking into the embers of the fire.
“I mean, if anyone might believe us, it’s Bruce,” says Tony.
” said Steve with a start.
“Is that what who is?” said a familiar voice.

“I’ve got a new suit down in the lab based on it. If it works, I’ll be able to condense the suit down to something that’d make Hank Pym cry. If it doesn’t… well, I’d say let’s not worry about it, but Steve will probably get really upset if the suit folds down to the size of an atom with me still inside it. Want to check my math?”
“Changed — m’mind,” Tony gasped, “Kill — me — please.”

“Missed you too,” said Tony.
The small you would no doubt find it touching. You find it enraging. You’re about to roar when you hear, “Whoa, there big guy!”

Knew it didn’t matter, so he went back to the plan he’d known,
“Yeah, if you want to get bored to death talking about Norman Rockwell,” said Steve as he sat down next to him.

CUT TO:
There was a tense silence for a moment, when Tony said, “Alright, first thing’s first: show me the scepter’s in the case.”
“Uh… y-yeah,” said Steve. “Me and my date, her name was Darla, we went for a walk. And they… fell out. Down the leg of my pants. And she asked what… and instead of answering I bolted and ran home.”
Quick as a flash, IVAN takes the gun off the table and points it at NATASHA’s retreating back.

“Yeah, I think we both knew that wasn’t going to happen,” said Tony as he tried to sweep Steve’s leg.

“Same old me. I just really want to try Ethiopian food today,” says Steve brightly.
Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark still happened in this universe, but nobody knew any of Peter's back story so they just made one up. Spider-Man's secret identity in the play is Maxwell Kane, a 30-something struggling playwright with a cocaine addiction and a chip on his shoulder. The play starts with him having sex with a hot spider goddess who promptly dies tragically in his arms and he gets her spider-powers. The play follows his mission to avenge his hot spider-wife while spurning hoards of girls who love how much of a sulky asshole he is.
I tried the IAB card. They won’t budge.”
“Why do they always show me with my hair down?” muttered Natasha, as she produced a hair tie from nowhere and started tying back her now waist-length hair into a ponytail.
STEVE
“Steve, you have to believe me. There is no universe where he hands the scepter over willingly,” said Tony.
You chuckle a bit and say, “Nat, why are all of our friends so emotionally constipated?”
Yeah, I know. Let’s go.
“I dunno, you seem pretty turned on when I put on the uniform,” said Steve with a grin.
: on his coat, down his shirt, on his pants, inside his hat, in his boxers. The second he got to his feet he was running and stripping off his clothes. By the time Tony came back to his senses, he was sitting in the bottom of a fountain, maybe two feet deep with very, very cold water. His teeth were chattering as he ran his hands compulsively over every square inch of skin to confirm again that he was not covered in spiders. And he was buck fucking naked.
“Only if dinner is also a metaphor for sex. Right now. Seriously, hop on the suit, I’m not waiting for NJ Transit.”

We’re not—
“No! No, no. It’s fine. Look, I’m leaving, ok?” said Tony quickly because he did
Dr. Mitchell was old enough to be slightly deaf, but Tony could hear Steve mutter, “the ice.”
“And that’s it?” asked Steve.
Asshole.

“Are you wearing chap stick?” said Tony as he pulled back.
“NO!” shouted Enchantress through the gag as she struggled against her bindings.
“Why?” said Steve.
“I never said I’d buy you a keychain,” said Steve.
“Wait ‘til you hear about the time I got blown up and imprisoned in a cave,” said Tony dully.

“When isn’t there?” said Natasha. Then she turned to Tony and said, “I’m about to go get Steve. This is your last chance to tell me your side of whatever just happened.”
“It never made it to the blog post, but she said, ‘you’re more than a few steps from freedom’,” says Bruce.
“You said you’d never wear it!” Clint practically squealed. And before Tony could say anything else, there was another
“When have you ever known me to be a man who loves simple things?”
You walk back down the pile of rubble to where your friends (what’s left of them) are sleeping around the remains of a fire, and shake one of the bundles of blankets awake. Nat grabs your wrist the moment you touch her shoulder, but years of this routine has converted her instinct from kill-on-touch to just this. You’ll never admit it, but her hand on your wrist is the most human contact you usually get these days. Part of you looks forward to it.
“Oh my
“Interesting,” Frank said, like she was deep in thought, and then she added, “and I’ll bet you were good friends with her first, weren’t you?”
“Oh no,” I say, the anticipation already ratcheting up inside me, “If this is what I think it is, and I’m the main character, then I need to get back in the elevator
But they couldn’t be together. It was too risky. He—
“Did you—”
“Nothing for me. This is an inspiration coffee run for Tony. He’s been working on a problem for the last eighteen hours and he’s hit a wall,” said Natasha.
The New York Aquarium still has large chunks of itself under construction since it was hit pretty badly by hurricane Sandy (back in 2013 very little except the main building was open), but if you like aquariums it's a nice day out. Plus you can walk the board walk after and make a Coney Island day trip of it. Personally I recommend stopping by Rita's Water Ice and getting a gelati while you're there.

know what had gotten into Pepper and Rhodey tonight. He’d been counting on them to be his better angels when he took Steve to the play tonight in case there was another glitter incident, but they’d apparently chosen to spend the one time the stars aligned and they were both in town and free at the same time to break out their mean streaks.
Steve smirked. “I remember you liking it a lot when I met you in the common room earlier,” said Steve.
“Right, fine, whatever,” said Hammer with a dismissive hand wave.
The second page shows Steve and Tony standing in the living room area we just saw in the last two panels, overlaid with the conversation Steve: "Oh yeah, Strange said the artifact left a lot of residual magic here. It'll dissipate eventually but it'll flare up like this from time to time until it does." Two panels of a close up on Steve and Tony, the first just of them talking, the second of Steve counting off on his fingers while Tony looks concerned. It's overlaid with the conversation Tony: "Wait, you've been living in a comic strip since the Enchantress thing?" Steve: "Oh no. It's been a lot more than just a comic strip." Tony: "What?" Steve: "Yeah, just this past week it's been... a silent movie, an infomercial--". New panel. Steve's speech bubble says "A puppet show", and the panel shows the same living-room setting, only with the background looking flatter and curtains on either side. Hand-puppet versions of Steve and Clint are talking to each other, with puppet-Clint saying "Hi Steve! Oh my God! Where are my legs!". The next panel has Steve's speech bubble saying "An Ikea Catalogue--" and shows the living room setting with more dynamic lighting, the word "IKEA" overlaid above the scene, and the words "MORABO sofa $399" next to the chair. The next panel has Steve's speech bubble saying "A Dali painting -- that one was wierd --" The same living room scene, only the books are floating and have odd markings on the front, the shield is melting off the cabinet, the lamp shade is floating off the lamp, and the NYC cityscape has the buildings in contorted shapes and the statue of liberty pointing its torch toward the viewer. The next panel cuts back to Steve with a hand on his chin and another hand still counting, as if in thought. Steve: "A radio play, a cooking show--" The final panel shows Tony taking Steve by the wrist and leading him back toward the elevator. Tony: "C'mon, we're going to my floor."
Then they scrambled towards the ringing where the phone was sweetly singing,
“On to the chorus, Cap!” said Tony, and so Steve pressed on.
“We are no longer friends,” said Tony dismissively.
“You’ll what, run away?” said Tony.

7. EXT. JAILHOUSE - DAY
So Tony did another spin.
Also no real evidence, except proximity.
“It never made it to the blog post, but she said, ‘you’re more than a few steps from freedom’,” says Bruce.
PEGGY’S ROOM is neat and clean, but with enough scarves on the mirror and costume jewelry on the wardrobe to remind you where she works. STEVE is going through a hope chest at the foot of her bed, and TONY is digging through her underwear drawer, looking like he wants to die.
“I wasn’t going to say him, Tony.”
“Are you screening my calls again?” hissed Pepper as she continued to drag him to the elevator.
PEGGY
“Since when do you know ASL?” asked Tony incredulously.
“It’s never going to be like that, Steve.”
“What does my hat say?” said Tony, too afraid to look himself.
“Good point,” said Tony, taking out his phone. “JARVIS? Book me and Steve box seats for
“Oh?” said Tony, as he handed over their tickets to the person at the front desk.  “How about
Steve did not read. He went back to his room, stared at his ceiling, and wondered how he’d managed to fuck up this badly before he even started.
BRUCE’S FLOOR
“That’s rule number three. Rule number one is ‘They always forget to look up’,” said Natasha, as she pressed the button for the roof.
And Tony might not have been a sports guy but he was a fantastic guy to watch baseball with. He knew when to shut up and play with his phone when the bases were loaded and there was a full count, and he knew how to fill all of baseball’s natural spaces between plays and innings with running commentary on… well, everything. There was definitely some weird tension going on with Colleen and Doug, but hey, nobody had asked if they could stick their dick in Steve’s shoe yet, which made this date orders of magnitude better than his last one.
HAROLD
“Thank you, Clint,” says Thor without a shred of irony.
Tony froze.
“What’s left of the non-residential floors?” asked Clint, who was counting floors on his fingers.
We’re in a Western, Steve, not a rom com.
“But do you specifically?”
Before Tony could answer with either a quip or some more pathetic whining (he’d know when it came out of his mouth), a familiar voice said, “What’d you do to my Iron Man, Cap?”
“Wow, you are
UPDATE: I had so much fun writing this chapter I expanded it into its own fic so the rest of the Avengers can tell their embarrassing sex stories too. Once you're done with this fic, check out
“Help yourself,” said Steve, who started walking over to the corner of the room to begin depositing the 5… 10… 15 broken punching bags down the garbage chute specifically reserved for this purpose.
STEVE
“C’mon, Cap, let’s go join the others before they think we’re boning in here,” said Tony.
Within moments Bruce was explaining the concept of a kick line to Thor as they locked arms on the little stage, but Nat went stiff. Clint walked over, put an arm around her shoulder, then started signing rapidly with one hand. And Steve tried to avert his eyes but even in his peripheral vision he could see what they were saying.
As the security guard dialed up Hammer’s office and people around the lobby took very un-subtle pictures of Captain America in the lobby of Hammertech with their camera phones, no one noticed Natasha Romanov, dressed as an office worker, slipping through the gate with a stolen key card, moving quickly to get to her next position.
“Ok, either way this plan sucks but I need to know: would they just
“What are my other options?”
Natasha landed in a crouch on top of the vent cover and wasted no time sprinting over to the controls to open the vault. Within seconds, the skimmers were in place over the retinal scanner, fingerprint scanner, and keypad.

“I don’t think it’s on my floor or Natasha’s,” says Clint.
“How do you mean?” you ask.

Tony turned his face upright so his chin was resting on Steve’s chest, and looked Steve in the eye.
I hope you all have as much fun reading this chapter as I did writing it.
You’re fully aware Nat’s story is probably bullshit, but even the slightest possibility of seeing a weird bug is enough to tempt you to enter the elevator and see for yourself.
“Then why did you just tell me you’re in love with me?” asked Steve.
“We should put her in a cage and let her whine and quoth and groan.”
(See the end of the chapter for
, all he wanted to do was rush up to him and hold him and tell him he was sorry, so sorry.
I’m givin’er all she’s got, Captain.
“Not right now, Enrique, I’m in a meeting,” said Hammer with a pained smile.
Then his footsteps grew fainter and fainter, and he was gone.
“It’s not relationship-ending. If anything it’s more of a… special occasions kind of deal.”
Direct hit. Shields are down. Captain, we’re being boarded.
“At least Doug left too. How did you not fall asleep talking to him?” asked Steve.
Clint clapped Bruce on the shoulder and said, “Bruce, we’ve all been there: right at the precipice of being seduced by a tower floor. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“Nah, the lunch meat’s gonna go bad if I don’t eat it soon. And I know you don’t care about that, Tony, but Steve makes puppy-dog eyes whenever we waste food, and my heart can’t take it.”
"Let's meet in the middle next time," Clint decreed. They nidded and nodded, and said they agreed. So they walked to the lift, as they giggled and chattered, all together again, and that's all that mattered.
“I think we know the love of God in a lot of ways, Tony. One of them is in the love of the people around us. And you have so much love in your heart, Tony. I know that if we ever decide to have children, that you and me are going to make a home for them that is so completely full of love. In a way we already have. And if that’s not living with God, I don’t know what is.”

You hear the lab doors open. In walk your friends Natasha, Tony, and Steve. All of them have that look on their face like they’re determined to get you to see some sunshine.

The top of Avengers tower. Tony frowns as he drops a little bird seed from a box. Thor sits with his legs between a railing, looking sad. Natasha leans over the edge of the tower to examine the bird cage hanging off of it.
“You should be inside the aquarium now, and thanks to a generous security upgrade from Stark Industries, thank you Pepper, the doors are now locked with adamantium bolts.”

hotter,” said Tony flippantly, his hand on the doorknob. There was nothing this asshole could say that Howard himself hadn’t alrady told him personally, and every additional second he spent in this room was just more time wasted in this shitty, shitty day.
“I’m not hurt,” said Nat, but her voice sounded strained.
“Like you don’t get all hot and bothered when I get into the suit,” said Tony with a matching grin.
Tony glared at Steve. “Oh we’re doing sightseeing? Because that’s just what I need right now.”
Tony said nothing, which was the biggest testament to how badly Steve had screwed up.
“Jarvis, prep Dummy with the hose. Outside on the launch pad this time, I don’t want him hosing down my electronics again. And the second we’re done here I’m bricking myself into the lab with a cask of Amontillado,” he grumbled.
Yeah. Yeah, I see what you mean.
“When I get out of here I am going to kick your ass straight back to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob,” growled Tony.
...One
“Worried you’ll see your second bare torso in your life?” said Tony with a wink, which of course sent the blood straight to Steve’s cheeks (and a little somewhere else too). But then Tony added, “Relax, I’ve got a layer on under this. Everyone’s delicate 40’s sensibilities are all accommodated here at Avengers Tower.”
“Don’t worry, sweetheart, I turned him down. We don’t pick anyone under eighteen or over eighty. Too awkward.”
“Right.”
STEVE
“You know, Tony, ah… I’m always here to help keep you safe too,” says Steve with a blush as you all walk down the hallway toward the elevator. “I mean, we all are.”
There was a moment of silence where everyone tried to figure out what to say to that, except Natasha, who nodded sagely.
I never said I was straight.
“I’m not here to hurt you. I’m a friend of Tony Stark,” said the woman.
There was Tony, seated on a bench in the middle of the greenery and medieval stone columns of the courtyard, deep in discussion with a kid who couldn’t have been older than six.
