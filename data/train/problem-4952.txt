“Are you really planning on asking me if something’s ‘acceptable’ again?” Dean rolls his eyes to make up for the blush he still hasn’t managed to shake off.
Castiel nodded, reluctantly. “The universe has a sense of irony. It seems to take the ‘what hurts you, hurts me’ philosophy to soulmates quite literally.”
“A few times, yeah. We’ve also been the ones to break it on occasion.”
Dean made a half-cough, half-choking noise. “‘Course not. I claimed one of the guest rooms, but I mostly just sleep in the Dean Cave, to be honest.”
“Dean,” a low voice rumbled from behind him.
For a minute, I try to picture it. What life would have been like if she’d stuck around. Dad might have stayed a mechanic. We’d have grown up in a house—had regular meals and friends. We would have gone to one school and maybe Sammy and me would have been typical, selfish teenagers—who, OK, probably wouldn’t have been as close as we are now. And there’d probably be a lot more monsters in the world….
he told himself.
There are fingers under the divot of his chin, and he realizes he’s being asked to raise his head. To look into the man’s face. To meet the man’s gaze. So, with agonizing slowness, he does.
When she did, she leaned back in her chair, hugging her sweater around her more closely the way that she tended to when she was cold. “What are you trying to tell me, Dean?” she asked softly.
—and Cas
But then, Dean’s bright grin faded slightly, a crease forming between his eyebrows that Castiel wanted to smooth away with his fingers. “You gonna be okay to get home…?” the actor asked, concerned.
She wonders if this is cheating—taking this much interest in a not-even-boyfriend of two weeks—but she isn’t doing it hoping to reconnect. With a new disaster in the world seemingly every week, she just needs to know that he’s out there—balancing the scales a bit.
Dean glanced at him again. “
“You’ve seen your father choose a path that led him away from his soulmate. So did my mother. We’re not—following a script.”
The whole cabin is one room with almost no furniture in it. A twin bed against the wall. A table, lined with tools. A trashcan piled high with food containers.
“On a Monday night?” Dean repeats, disbelievingly.
“I think the angel said it best. He’s you, but not you as you are right now. To be honest, he’s someone I wasn’t sure you’d ever get the chance to be.”
him listening, like a thrum beneath his skin. “I assumed… for a while… that things would go back to normal with him gone. But she missed him. She’d get sad—and remember some small thing he’d gotten her or a joke they’d shared and I—I thought having a soulmate must be terrible to make you love someone like that.
, they had ended up getting into a debate over Aristotle.
- right there—
Cas plopped the napkin off to the side of his plate where it caused the silverware to clang together, menacingly. “You truly take compliments the worst of any person I’ve ever met.”
There is a pause where all he hears is Cas subtly shifting on the bedspread. When the silence goes on a beat too long, he glances back up only to see Cas hide a smile behind his usual stoic expression. A second later and the smile reappears, then immediately gets tucked away again. And it’s fascinating watching him
“Can’t—” Jody manages. “People get—too close to him—pass out.”
“Cas?”
“Hell no!” Dean exclaimed as Castiel returned to the bed, the springs groaning under the weight of his knee. “Cas, you take that back!”
“Those are pretty words, Cas,” Dean spoke wryly, as he took his arm back. “It’s almost like you’re a writer.”
“And that's everything you know?” Bobby asks, with raised eyebrows.
“I… I knew that.”
—I would never try to
“Dean…” Cas warns, but Sam seems non-perturbed.
Castiel considered his words carefully. “To be fair, I think most paparazzi assume the worst of every celebrity relationship—whether they’re soulmates or not.”

sequel.
Castiel defiantly picked up another bottle. “Just because they claim to have a certain fragrance doesn’t mean that they are mimicking it accurately. And that’s not counting those with metaphorical names like ‘Mountain Breeze.’”
Cas shook his head. “I know that the chances of you believing me are slim to none, but I think I dragged myself into this.” He hesitated. “Insomnia aside, I can’t quite bring myself to regret it either.”
Dean almost starts to say something dismissive—but then he remembers what it was like after Sam left for Stanford—when Dad was pretty much all he had at times.
Dean scrubs his face with his hands. “OK, I have no idea how in the
“Why? ‘Cause being a man-whore offends your angelic sensibilities?”
Dean is about to give an unthinking, “Me, too, Buddy” when—wait a minute. “Gender?”
“Exactly! And, I cussed God out back in 2008—and for most of the years after. I couldn’t understand why he allowed all that stuff to happen—the earthquakes and the plagues. Why Sam of all people had to jump into the Pit or lose his soul. I yelled at Him every single time you exploded on me. And even when he brought me or Sam or you back, I was still angry because he knew what was coming and let us die in the first place.”

“Without what, Sam?” he asked, testily, even though he knew the answer to that, too. Without worrying about
And Cas—Cas should be worried about that—about the sounds they were making and the very thin walls and the neighbors who already disliked him. But Dean went from kissing him long and intense and deep to finding a spot on his neck that made him move up the bed, towards and away from the sensation at the same time—and he
“An agreement?” Bobby repeats, voice low and dangerous, and thank fuck, there’s someone not insane on my side.
“If that’s fine with you,” Castiel hurried to add.
Cas stalks forward, blue eyes blazing like a gas stove, and even though it’s squarely directed at the man—demon—in front of him, we can all feel the heat.
A few minutes later, the two of them are sitting on the Impala’s hood, parked on an overlook above a valley. The beer seems to calm Dean down, which is both helpful and worrisome at the same time, but Sam waits until the silence between them has become easy to speak.
Dean snorts. “Cas has felt up
“Hello, Sam,” Cas responds, leaning across the bench seat to make his voice heard better. “You’re pretty clear already.”
I went back and added these after I realized they were popular partway through the story. There's a chance I missed some so feel free to shout out in the comments. (In general, I don't include references to people as Easter eggs since very few people in this story aren't in canon).
Dean: Unless. You wanna come with us to laser tag?
His brother looked down at his hands—cleared his throat. “When I imagine who I want me and Jess to be someday, it’s not Mom and Dad. Or any marked couple I remember from when we were growing up. It’s Bobby and Ellen.” Their surrogate aunt had lost her first husband to a freak hunting accident, while Bobby and his wife Karen split when they couldn’t agree on kids.
Dean’s scowl is reflected in the windshield glass, but Castiel has to agree with Sam. He knows his upbringing was… unconventional. But he doesn’t understand why that’s especially problematic. Is Dean just worried because there are more people with powers out there than he realized? Surely, he must know that the number of Specials in the world is growing—with or without the government’s interference.
in their bedroom.
“Who is the Red Hood?” Castiel answers the game show host, at the same time Benjamin says, “Who is Jason Todd?”
Can’t you… do it for me?” he asked, casting hopeful green eyes at the techie.
and he thought there was an unspoken agreement that he would be going back to his apartment at the end of the night: Dean’s preference, not his.
And, of course, one of the pre-requisites for joining the agency is that your fingerprints and soulmark get uploaded into the database.
Unwilling to visit his own wife and watch her move on with his life, the narrator often went to visit a living woman named Julia, who’d recently lost her fiancé, Liam, to cancer.
I also just wanted to leave a general FYI saying that the rest of this fic will not be solely memory sharing. There will be some visitors coming and some other hijinks interspersed throughout. Really hope you guys like the chapter!

“Computer needs either a password or a soulmark scan. Figure that’s a job for Charlie.”
“Good.”
“That’s right, Kid," Dean agrees, fighting down the sudden urge to put his hand on the kid’s shoulder. "Did Darth Vader mention any place special? Maybe somewhere he hoped to take you?”
“What about you?”
His feet automatically led them towards his bedroom so that he could at least change into something less sticky after Cas finished yelling at him. Of course, it didn’t take him long to realize his mistake, causing him to stop mid-step.
So, Cas did. Instantly, a crackling recording started playing. “Hey, Cas,” Dean’s voice called out from a thin, circular device embedded in the paper. “I know I told you that… there were some things I had trouble saying. But I figured if anyone deserved to hear it every day, it’s you. So—just for the record—okay? I… love you.
“Trapped in an underground lair fighting with my other self for days because he apparently never got a memo saying he was wanted around here?”
“Don’t be crude,” he muttered, grateful—not for the first time—that he didn’t tend to fidget when uncomfortable.
started pounding on his chest harshly. Both Cas and the bellboy were tense with concern—and Cas was just about to get in position for the Heimlich maneuver when Dean gave out a ragged breath, like a dry vac sucking up the last bit of water out of a pool, making it fairly clear that he swallowed the stem. “I’m good… Totally fine,” Dean promised, still coughing around the words.
know that dinner’s like… eight hours from now, right? You going to be downward dogging all day?”
“It’s only for a few months—until Stanford starts in the fall.”
talk about me until I come back,” Dean grumbled, moving towards the stairs since he and Lisa kept their more expensive alcohol in the basement.
He’s still uncoordinated and only causes the chair to topple onto the well-worn hardwood floor with a teeth-jarring crash.
Michael invited us all out—though from the way he looks at you, Angel Eyes, I’m guessing he wouldn’t mind if it turned into a private party.”
Instantly, he stood up straighter. “I’m taking cooking classes now. I’m not terrible anymore.”
“Fine. Then be a Dean who’s kinder to himself,” he countered. But the tight cramp in his stomach was finally unknotting slightly.
“What did you mean about saving Sammy’s soul?” I ask, getting right to the point.
Cas looked down at his hands. His skin, especially the lines of his palms, was dyed a translucent red and there were squiggles of ground beef still clinging to them like slugs. “Dean, what happens now?” he asked the actor, who was laying the hamburger patties they just finished shaping into one of Cas’s seldom-used pans with a
Today’s discussion is apparently called “The Devil in the Details.”
“I’ll grab us a table,” Cas announces, while Sam, young Me, and I head up to the bar to place our orders.
“Bribed the heck out of him.”
“Yes, well, stop. And you agreed to do this with me, so you can try to have a good attitude.”
“Right,” Dean huffs.
“He says like Spock. What’s the point of debating with me if you have the same answer?”
Dean raised his eyebrows, going for the guitar he kept in the corner of the room. “How about two?”
As soon as they had gotten home, Ben had raced off to find Lisa, but once his footsteps faded away, it was like all the other sounds vanished with him.
And then, suddenly, a screen was being shoved in Dean’s face—and his eyes were struggling to focus against the light. When the spots finally cleared out of his vision, he found himself looking at a picture of him and Lisa on date night at that Italian place, talking down at their food instead of each other.
Dean smiled. “
A second later, Richard came into the room from a side door. “Lisa, Ben,” he greeted, followed by a “Dean.” And maybe the actor was imagining things, but he thought that there was a harder edge to his name than usual. “You’ve been making quite a splash in the press this week, haven’t you?”
It was kinda crazy how much adrenaline he felt running through his veins—especially considering they still had 45 minutes to go. His whole body was buzzing like an electric fence.
“For that matter, my schedule is very flexible. I could probably volunteer a few times a week….” He’d gotten quieter as he talked and, by the end, he realized he was mostly thinking out loud.
Inside his studio, the quiet continued; it almost seemed to echo—likely a symptom of the other college students in the building having already moved out. Opening Netflix, he set it to play a Dean Winchester movie he’d seen a dozen times for background noise and began assembling boxes.
Dean frowns—because he’s heard Cas say “I’m afraid I might kill myself” before in that same tone of voice—and he thought,
They went home afterward and tucked Ben in together, went to sleep in the same bed, and woke up the next morning in a house that had always been too big but was even more so now. They went to date night on Tuesday—some Italian place with white tablecloths and too small portions—and talked about the new belt Ben earned in karate and where they should go on vacation when they got a chance.
“Dean!” the accountant says again, rushing towards him.
/////
“All of the things Dean said, he and Castiel do
Cas hesitates, but nods. “Well, sometimes if you’ve had an OK day, you go to sleep and the next day everything goes to hell.” He knows it’s irrational to think that he’s not allowed too many good days in a row before the next end-of-the-world event comes. Even if he is, tomorrow’s creeping up regardless—but sometimes, he just…wants to hold on to today.
“Sooooo…” I say—just to say something. “Seen any good movies lately?”
“I… why?” he wondered, the beginnings of a headache starting behind his temples.
“Yeah? And what else have you been up to lately?”

Sam doesn’t seem to notice the last part. “You know Netflix will still be there after breakfast,” he says, arching his eyebrow, already picking at his own food.
As for the rest of it, I don’t envy the decision those three are facing. Not one bit. If I got the chance to change what happened to Karen… God, I can’t even imagine. But if she hadn’t died, I woulda never become a hunter, woulda never gotten to be there for those boys….
Cas, meanwhile, looks somewhere between bewildered and amused. “I don’t know how I would know the answer to that question. It’s not like I can ask anyone.

Wherever Dean was, Cas apologized for the painful clenching in his heart that the actor was sure to feel. “I’m not going to let you get away with this,” he declared—equal parts unsure what he could do about it and absolutely certain that he would find a way.
“I’m gonna be honest. There have been times I have been pissed at you—really, really pissed. But even when I hated you the most, I never
“Yeah… I think we are actually,” the actor murmured, voice turning soft around the edges like the point where waves spread out along the beach.
“Holy soulmark, Batman!” Charlie gasps at his side, which is apparently the signal for everyone in the room to start talking again—the noise like a dozen TVs that someone is turning up, up, and up.
“Seriously, Gabriel,” he said, trying to keep his voice as low and even as possible. “There are easier ways of contacting me than enlisting a… a… sing-a-gram… to come to my door.”
“Dean,” Lisa finally answered—very seriously—in the same tone someone would use if they were telling you there was a bear behind you. “You

—which I do not.”
Luckily, his fans don’t seem to mind.
“Heard from Cas recently?” Dean asks him, holding onto the doorframe one-handed.
Suddenly, the car door opens with a creak—and bodies are climbing inside. Samandriel gets shoved into the backseat first, and then Dean and Hannah are opening both front doors simultaneously. “
He seems to have, at last, caught Brady off guard, his practiced congeniality flickering and then eventually failing altogether like a dying light bulb. “You have

Dean sighed, wiping his palm down his face before scrubbing at his cheeks. “What I meant was—I already had a chick flick moment with Lisa today. I can’t deal with one from you too.”
the actor lowered his voice some. “I wasn’t sure if I said something that really pissed you off when you were eavesdropping on me earlier.”
Cas huffed, equal parts fondness and exasperation in the sound. “I was just going to point out that if I

“Sam?” he repeated, dazed.
Dean stared at his ex, open-mouthed—before catching sight of his other ex, now drinking his beer with a smirk and a raised eyebrow, before finally turning to Castiel. “He wanted to meet Benny!” Dean defended, throwing a thumb in the author’s direction.
Dean tried his hardest not to flinch.
As if noticing the subtle twitch in Cas’s jaw—or sensing
Apparently, LA had these… establishments—places where people donated old household items for the express purpose of letting other people beat them up. “It’s cathartic,” Meg explained, grinning as they approached a wall of weapons, featuring chainsaws, hatchets, bows and arrows, and hammers.
Cas just stared at him.
By the time Darth Vader is battling Luke, they’re touching from their shoulder down to their leg, which means Dean should fully be able to feel Cas’s gasp of shock when Darth Vader declares “I—am—your father”—but there’s nothing.
“I don’t know, to be honest.”
Castiel looked at it, uncertainly, before abruptly realizing he was asking for a handshake and meeting him halfway.
I can feel his thoughts holding very still, trying not to give anything away, so I just keep going.
He was used to having time to arrange words exactly so—to make sure they conveyed what he wanted to. More than that, in his books, he could control the other characters’ responses to those words. He couldn’t do that here. “When we were just friends, part of me wanted to find reasons not to fall in love with you. And I also wasn’t trying to make you fall in love with me. So, I didn’t hesitate to push topics that I thought were important.
“No!” I announce, emphatically. “What would I even get out of that?”
“Don’t be an idiot, Cas,” I say, meeting his eyes in the rearview mirror so he knows I’m serious. “She probably just timed it to the start of the Apocalypse stuff is all.”
to be the angel of temperance, as well,” he states, solemnly—but he seems pleased with the involuntary smile that brings to Dean’s face.
“Here,” I mutter, tossing my phone into my younger self’s lap, when my anger has lowered down to embers.
“You guys decided already?” Dean questioned, seeming genuinely surprised.
“I’m glad you know him so well. I wish I could say the same since he was apparently allowed to take you out of a place where I knew you were safe without my permission.” This time, even Jack can’t miss the bite in those words, though Cas doesn’t stop stroking his hair.
about to erupt—and if we don’t figure out what they’re really up to, we’re going to be caught with our pants down and no bug spray.”
“I’m not saying that messing with my mind without my consent is OK—because it’s far from it—but I didn’t come over here to beat you up about it. I figure you feel guilty enough. I came over here to tell you to stop it.”
“Don’t you think you would have had some kind of warning if I was going to break up with you?” Castiel asked eventually after a few heartbeats had passed and Dean’s breathing seemed to slow down. Cas hadn’t realized it had been fast before.
Gabriel's general take on soulmates/destiny parallels his thoughts on destiny throughout Season 5
There’s his name again—only it gets cut off before the “tiel” by someone nearly tripping over him.
Dean raised his eyebrows.
“From what I can tell, he’s a poorly performing author, trying to boost his profile by attaching it to yours. I mean, Crowley did market
“Yeah, it drives Lisa insane. Says she always feels like the third wheel when the two of us get together,” Dean joked.
“Drop it, Sammy!”
“U interested tues @ 2?”
“Well,” Dean shrugged, “Feelings mutual.” He brushed crumbs from his hands, “So… what? You’re gonna call her more or whatever?”
“Yes, but, as illogical as it may be—”
Cas jolted, as Dean’s mouth was suddenly on him too. And he wanted to gasp out an apology, except Dean seemed to welcome the involuntary rut of Cas’s hips—bobbing his head short and shallow and then longer and deeper, echoing every one of Cas’s groans with a moan of his own and—
Dean sighs; he’s just about to pick up another book when he hears a shuffle over by his desk and he quickly gets to his feet.
“Not since I dropped off those books this morning.”
“I mean, stretch your legs if you want to, but we’ll meet back here in a few.”
dad—might reach out.” Charlie’s voice tried to treat him delicately—the same way she would treat a rare comic book. “Or even if… something’s happened to him, you might hear from an uncle or a grandparent.”
“And you guys have been best friends since you were fifteen. Doubt Cas is looking to be impressed.”
Cas still wasn’t very good at taking Dean deep—but Dean groaned loudly anyway when he paid special attention to the head, flicking his tongue against the frenulum, creating a seal around it and sucking, and—
“So, lots of pants suits.”
“It feels weird flirting now that—you know….” his brother mutters, fingers tight against the steering wheel.

“No. Nope. Absolutely not.”
—Dean knew he was in for it.
Dean sneaks into the classroom the same as before—only he’s a little bit later than last time and Hot Guy is already seated.
“What?” Cas managed, his throat more gravel-gargled than usual.
this was something that Cas had seen before. Over the last week and a half of self-imposed quarantine, he and Dean had had a couple of “lessons” that had… fairly naturally evolved into each of them grasping themselves in hand, gasping the other’s name as they worked themselves over—until they finally erupted over their own stomachs or bedsheets.
have one argument in his favor up his sleeve—literally—it wouldn’t be right to bring that up here with people who actually know and love Cas. So, instead, he blurts out, “The Angel Killer murdered my mom!”
Castiel had to admit there was something strange about sleeping at Dean’s house again—with Dean beside him. It was nice, of course, but strange—as if part of his mind was time traveling back to when this wouldn’t have been allowed.
“I would need an order of magnitude more than this to feel tipsy.”
“Not that. Well,
when he took a shower this morning.
“No… But it’s delicious,” Dean insists with a whole-face grin that makes him look ten years younger. Cas bites the inside of his cheek—one of his new human gestures—and just like that, Sam knows he’s lost this one.
Castiel sat in the only unoccupied guest chair, which smelled vaguely of mouthwash, and surreptitiously snuck a peek at his phone. He frowned when he found no new messages.

“But ‘ass’ and ‘butt’ mean the same thing,” Cas insists. “It’s not contradictory at all.”

When Dean pulls away from a dazed looking Cas, he doesn’t bother wiping the shine off his lips. “I don’t share,” he tells Toby pointedly, dragging Cas by the hand back to the Impala, leaving Sam to awkwardly wave and follow in their wake.
“Yeah, well, I hope to be a good 60 years from yelling at inanimate objects. Point is, I just got to thinking about how it would be cool to introduce my soulmate to those same shows someday—see all
She shook her head. “Of course,” she responded with a smile. “But Dean, we’re still on for tonight, right?”
“You’ve
Cas looked at him, squinting. Suddenly, Dean remembered their first conversation where the author admitted to knowing how to hotwire cars.
Dean’s laugh felt ironic. “Okay, you shouldn’t be a doctor either.
“For that matter, you probably also have positive sense memories attached to pie—your mother making it for you, having it on special occasions—so you eat it now to evoke those same feelings. Should you deny yourself that specifically because it makes you happier than you would be otherwise?" Castiel shrugged. “I’ve come to think of soulmates in much the same way.”
Cas doesn’t really glare at him, but there’s judgment there, none-the-less.

” he asked, pacing. Dean opened his mouth, a frown between his eyebrows.
On the other end of the line, Gabe seemed to know that his message had sunk in. “Now,” he segued, tone abruptly shifting with his smile, “Why don’t you fill me in, for real? From the top. Preferably while tap dancing.”
Burning bright.
“Now, let’s see if
Eventually, Sam seemed to notice his rambling and abruptly cut himself off. “She would have made an impressive lawyer is all I’m saying,” he summarized with a blush.
fill in the silence while we pass yet another cow farm.
“You—” she started.
There is a muffled shout and then the sound of a fist connecting from outside the car.
“Now, your turn to talk some,” Dean interrupted himself, pausing only to stuff his mouth with another overly large bite of burger. “I feel like I’m being the only Fruit Gusher over here.”
“Beer!” I exclaim a little too loudly, causing the Other Dean to jump. “I mean…beer? Anyone want one…? Because I’m going to…uh…”
. As an advanced reader’s copy, it had a soft cover—one that had been bent backward at the corner. There were also several cracks along the spine. As Dean flipped through it, Castiel noticed several pages covered in different colored ink and what he thought might be a macaroni and cheese stain.
“So he was--” Dean asks, scrubbing the back of his head.
Dean turns the book over. A stylized version of Cas sits on a park bench, looking up at the sky as if asking for a sign. He flips it open to a random page. “
numbers, not just crunch them.” As they talk, Dean buttons a black vest over Cas’s royal blue T-shirt, an outfit they’d bought specifically for this case. Of course, Cas is probably perfectly capable of putting on his clothes himself, but neither he nor Sam have mentioned that.
Dean rises from his chair—fully intending to cut the smirk off the guy’s face and stitch it back on upside down—when suddenly, Benny is there, pinning his arms behind his back and manhandling him out of the door.
Dean clenches his jaw. “How do you know that anyway?” he questions at last, the car racing to catch up with the glow of the headlights on the road and never succeeding.
—to hear about me and Lisa?” Dean disassembled his own sentence with the efficiency of someone taking apart a gun.
Unbidden, a picture comes to his mind of him and Cas versus Sam and Eileen playing Pictionary someday. He and Cas would lose because Cas “didn’t understand that reference.” Meanwhile, Sam would be trying to convince the room that kale chips were just as good as potato chips until Dean decided to throw one at his head and—

“Oh.” The angel looks slightly embarrassed.
Gabriel, who had been distracted by the boy standing next to him, turns back to Dean with the interest of someone whose TV show just got interesting.
Lisa rolled her eyes at her son’s question. “If they
And to dig the knife in a little deeper, this was followed not two minutes later by, “Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing? Why?”
“…like this is a stupid question,” Dean grumbles, looking over Cas’s shoulder at the phone to make sure he read it right. “I mean, it’s written even more awkwardly than the stuff that comes outta

“What do you expect me to say, Cas? That it makes a difference because it’s you? You should

That he’s only going to close his eyes for a minute until the slight aching in his head disappears. That, any second now, he’s gonna get back up and work on the case. He’s…
“No, of course not.”
Castiel raised his eyebrows. “Did you bring paper with you?”
“Didn’t have to. Eve said he was always gone the nights the Angel Killer struck. Had a library full of books on angel symbolism. Doesn’t take a genius to put 2 and 2 together.
Dean scoffed, even if the sound had a little more air in it than usual.

Dean demands.

“Mmhmm, and how are things going with Crowley?”

Dean thought. He was really on a roll tonight.
The pause from the other end of the phone was like the sound a drum makes the moment
“For that matter,” he says, remembering something that kind of bugs him. “You totally know when someone’s checking you out. But they try to tell you you’re hot or whatever and suddenly, you’re all, ‘My temperature is perfectly regulated at the moment.’ What gives?”
The slap of their skin was amplified by the sound of the water—and if there was no going back

He stopped pacing.

“OOOOOkaay…,” Dean said, tone still skeptical. “Fine. So, she’s got a stick up her ass. That kinda prompts an obvious question.”
Cas tilts his head to the side, “Wouldn’t that just be married?”
“I’m very pleased to hear it.”
“There is a botanical garden and bee sanctuary in California--” And even though that sounds only slightly less suck-ass than Sam’s thing, Dean lets Cas ramble on for a few more sentences about
“Shut up, Cas,” Dean said, pushing the speedometer up higher.
“And I, you. Sam Winchester…,” Castiel responds. “The boy with the demon blood. Glad to see you’ve ceased your extracurricular activities.”
“I think that, if I cut it, you would miss making fun of me for it.”
“Jack calls you ‘Dad’ too!” Dean interrupts.

“And then I saw all those messages from everyone afterward and booked it over but… it doesn’t matter. The facts are: you needed me, and I fuckin’ ignored you. So, if I disappointed you before—I’m sorry. Turns out I’m even worse of a boyfriend than you thought I was.”
“Who’s your friend?” Memory Dean whispers. Castiel ignores the part of him that wants to deny that Uriel is his friend. What is a friend besides a companion, an ally? And Uriel is both. The fact that Castiel dislikes him is almost irrelevant—not to mention unfounded. Instead of answering The Righteous Man, he launches into a long interrogation about the Winchester’s progress finding the witch.

life—where Dean regularly went out to A-list parties and drove around in his collection of classic cars while Castiel spent weekends in his room, interacting with friends he mostly met only over the internet and lying to his mother about how excited he was to become a doctor someday. “It’s better this way. I’m not attached to Dean, so it’s not like his absence from my life will change anything.”
“Of import, I said.”
My mind shudders to a stop like it’s a subway car that just lost power. When it starts up again, I’m genuinely worried about Sam’s mental health. “Are we sure those Brits didn’t do some permanent damage to your head? I do

The way you connect disparate ideas together to make me think about situations in a new light—all while never giving yourself credit for it.

Dean knows it’s impossible—but he’s genuinely starting to wonder if the angel
“There’s nothing to apologize for,” Castiel insisted, gentle but firm. “I’m only grateful that you trusted me with all this.”
“Because we’re not supposed to be seen together in public. And the news thinks you’re married, and you always pre-screen the places you go to minimize attention and this—this would not be doing that.”
“Are you sure you and Cas are even related then?” he asked, mostly sarcastically. The cousins might not look alike, but the popping out of nowhere

“Well, shit,” Dean muttered when he told him as much. “And here I thought Sammy was the only one who could make me feel like this much of an asshole.”
All the facts of his life were the exact same as they had been yesterday.
Castiel frowned in the direction of his computer screen. “I wear boxers—and they’re perfectly comfortable at the moment.”
“Dean,” he murmured—or maybe prayed—when their mouths parted for just a moment. And then he was realigning them again, chasing the taste of Dean’s mouth—which was sweet with a hint of bitterness from the beers he’d drunk.
“Not to be a dick—just because there’s probably gonna be extra press and sometimes that crap affects Ben. But, uh…” Dean hesitated. Sam got his eyes from their dad—the color at least—d
“So, you really did blackout that night, huh?” Gabriel laughed, causing Castiel to grimace.
“I know,” Lisa murmured, and when he glanced up, it was to see her eyes softer than they had been in days. She scooched closer, tucking Dean’s head into her shoulder and petting his hair, the way he’d seen her do with Ben. “I know.”
“And you’re considering it—
He’d been planning to take this as slow as the rest of it—to move them closer inch by inch, giving them both a chance to back out if necessary. But apparently, Cas didn’t get the memo because a second later, warm lips crash against his, already nipping, prodding—and Dean must not have gotten enough air, because his head’s already spinning.

Dean grumbles under his breath, but eventually lets out a curt, “
Charlie narrowed her eyes at him. “Would I have to move?” she questioned after a minute.
“So. Angels,” Bobby says at last—a statement and a question at the same time.
“Fuck,” the actor whispered—before turning back to him, eyes bright but clear. “I did. I did know,” he managed.
“Nah,” Dean promised, propping himself up on one elbow and turning to face the author better. “I mean, I probably won’t be able to hang out with you much today. The kid’ll be home soon, and I promised Ben we could work on the treehouse we got going out back. Then, I have a meeting with my agent to discuss what interviews I’m up for in the next few months. And Lisa and I have this charity thing tonight. But I mean, Sam’ll be here—he’s the room at the other end of the hall—and he’s already planning on ordering pizza, so…”
Cas raised one eyebrow and crossed his arms over his chest, which made him look—taller somehow. Or something. “Shakespeare

Turns out the angel is fine—annoyed, but fine—trapped in a circle of Holy Fire at one of the crime scenes. And when the relief of that sinks in, Sam finally gets around to asking Dean how he knew.

“No idea,” Brady smirks as he leans forward, conspiratorially. “And I’m pretty sure that’s your job to figure out. Not mine.”
Dean snorted, finally turning around to face the author.
“She…?”
. No, my old man had a DNA test run about five minutes after he knew I existed. He gets another performed every birthday just to make sure there wasn’t a mistake.”
“Would you feel better if you, uh, met Benny sometime?” Dean asked the question hesitantly.
He quickly discovered that it didn’t work at this angle—not without having to contort his wrist to a ridiculous extent—and Dean gave out a snorting laugh.
“But left to their own devices…they’ve got their fair share of issues that they’ve never really worked out. So, they bicker. A lot. And it drives me completely insane—but just when I think about locking them in a room together and throwing away the key, they’re suddenly fine and in sync again. It’s…well, normal is probably not the right word for it. But normal for them.”
“Just like you don’t know who Castiel Novak is?”
It was—surprisingly enough—their first kiss of the day. Maybe their fourth or fifth kiss overall. It was also perfect, as far as Cas was concerned.
“Yeah. They’re making a movie about it.”
the one you got to watch out for. That girl loves loading people up with the frou-frou girl drinks and roping them into Truth or Dare or some other sorority-game shit.” Castiel couldn’t help but wonder exactly what she’d dared Dean to do—and whether or not there was video footage.

Cas had had many awkward moments in his life—but perhaps, none so awkward as this.
“It’s

soulmark flayed from his skin—while Dean’s apparently no closer to finding him than when he started.
“Of course. Apologies,” Jessica agreed easily without looking like she was sorry at all. “And who is it my job to flirt with today?”
Castiel didn’t have any other words besides, “…Thank you.” And then, because it was true, he added, “I do choose you. Every day.”
“Yeah. So… what do you think?”
“And why would an angel rescue me from Hell?” Dean demands at last. Castiel genuinely doesn’t understand the question. He knows, of course, that few people get the second chance that this one is given—but he’s also seen the Righteous Man’s soul, how it shone pure and white against the reds and greys of Hell, the way it called out for its brother—not to ask for rescue from his torment, but because his soul is made of utter devotion—and he only finds it strange that his garrison wasn’t called to collect him sooner.
So, he jogged; he deep-cleaned his bathtub and reorganized his kitchen; he worked on his crossword puzzle; and, at one point, decided to buy every strange kind of Oreo he could find at the grocery store to decide which flavor he liked best. So far, everything but the original and the Double-Stuf varieties was disappointing.
“And just like that, I feel much more entertained,” Gabriel said, reclining against the couch with both of his arms behind his head.

“No, Cas,” Sam shakes his head with a painful smile. “Apparently, the truth spell doesn’t mind the use of sarcasm.”
Out of focus of the frame but still noticeable was Sam.
“Snore? You know--” and Dean proceeds to mimic the noise he means. He figures he’s getting a little sleep-drunk, which is why he has no control over his mouth, but now that his brain has thought of it, he’s really curious.
Whether it was the soulmate connection or not, he
“Well,” Dean retorted. “At least you think I’m pretty.”
Cas leans back. “Those two things have never been mutually exclusive before. I don’t see why they would start being so now. All that’s changed is that you’re aware that the emotions coexist.”
“Yeah, I figured we’d start with
“And I mentioned that I still struggle to understand the differences between what you say and what you mean sometimes. He suggested that, for today, I just ask you.”
Castiel’s chest burned again, except he had a better idea what it was about this time and tried not to copy the movement of Dean’s own hand as he rubbed at his shirt over the area of his heart.
Dean shrugged in a way that didn’t come off
“What?
Cas was already surprised that the actor didn’t skip the produce section altogether, but then—“You’re getting sweet potatoes?” Castiel questioned, once again contemplating the idea that this whole day was an elaborate dream.
“What’s up, Sammy?” he asks after a minute of Sam silently standing there, hand on the knob.
“Eh. I’ll buy him a new one. Maybe I’ll even convince the author to autograph it for him,” he mentioned with a wink.
“Yup. It’s
“Don’t move,” she reminded him, sternly.
“But you want to be.” Dean sounds so sure of himself that I really wish that I could prove him wrong. Except Eileen is incredible and I get the feeling from our late-night Skype conversations that she wouldn’t be opposed to… exploring things a little further.
“Well, when you put it that way….”
It took them the whole hour to Dean’s place to get through five songs, what with the author stopping the music after each one to question Dean more closely about the meaning. And, for a while after they passed the wrought-iron automatic gates and pulled into the garage of the modest Spanish-inspired mansion, they just sat in the car to listen to the closing lines of
“Or this—” Gabriel continued, revealing a third picture—of Dean and Castiel standing outside the Impala two days after the Rowena auditions. Lisa and Ben had been at her family’s weekly Sunday brunch, so Dean had suggested breakfast at his place, followed by a few episodes of Firefly—but it turned out the actor didn’t have bacon, so they’d had to make a quick reroute to a grocery store.
he realizes—and that makes no sense.
“Sammy! Are we talking about--” I hear before the line clicks off.
Cas heaved a sigh, trying to ignore the slight churning in his stomach.
The actor dropped the fist he’d been using to knock, stuffing both hands in his pockets. “Cas,” he repeated, staring at a point over the author’s left shoulder rather than at his face. “We need to talk.”
“Look, there’s no way we’re going anywhere with you,” I tell him honestly, remembering the table full of supplies we’d left behind in the barn with regret. “We don’t even have silver on us to test--”
“—I’ve been paying more attention to the way you are around each other. And it just seems like… you guys live side by side, but not… together.

“Pretty sure… we do,” Dean murmured, breath skipping over Cas’s neck, before capturing his mouth in a kiss. And despite his better judgment, Castiel found himself giving in to the moment—to the feel of Dean’s lips moving against his, to the way Dean reached out with his right hand and tangled their fingers together, to the subtle rocking of their hips that wasn’t quite as subtle anymore. To the feeling that was building in his stomach—that they were building together. Dean pulled back just a bit—flicking the button of his jeans open…
Castiel blinked. He had somehow not considered that, once at Dean’s house, he had no way to get back to his apartment without another ride. “Yes,” he breathed. “I’d like that.”
“Agent?” calls a voice belonging to a tall woman with a short brown pixie cut, carrying a cardboard box filled with canned goods. “Sorry to keep you waiting. Claire, would you mind helping Kaia and Alex in the kitchen?” she asks, hefting the box over to her.

Dean was gone by the time that Castiel woke up the next morning.
“Like the other day, we were talking about—” Sam waved his hand, “Dad and everything.” Dean felt his body stiffen. “And I just started getting worked up about all the stuff that he did—or didn’t do. And she reminded me that even if he sucked, I had you basically being my parent. Making my lunches, picking me up from school, asking if I did my homework.
“Scary thing is, I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or sincere,” Gabriel muttered. “Either way, you are normally waaaay snappier when I call and that means something’s up. Tell your big cousin… what’s got your panties in a twist?”

I mean most of the people who saw me naked in those years would probably have been fine with me not having a big ass handprint on my arm…And past Me will probably just come up with a stupid excuse for why it’s missing…like it disappeared because we met or something.”
“I thought about it…” Dean admitted. “Even… went to a place to have the procedure done, but… uh…” Castiel’s hand had stilled at the point of the tail, the smooth skin of his wrist just brushing his pebbled nipple. It had never felt particularly good to pinch them during the times he’d pleasured himself—but out of curiosity, he tried again, now—letting out a slightly punched-out breath at the sensation.

Chapter 13: "Castiel sat on top of the closed toilet lid, scrolling through his phone. The photo he was looking for was several years old, but—at last, he found it—the selfie he’d taken of his soulmark back when he’d first learned the truth."
Here Cas was, worried about the possibility of breaking his and Dean’s friendship forever, and the actor was making
“The hell I am. There are pictures of them up on social media already being all buddy-buddy.”
“I capiche.”
“Of someone else’s money!”
And then froze in place. In fact, all of Dean’s body was suddenly,
“When did you meet her?”
“I suppose I should start by saying that it was my agent that accessed my phone records,” he mentioned, slipping the button out of its hole. “The day of my launch. He confiscated it before my reading.”

For a lot of reasons. Starting with his vessel having a dick and ending with the fact that he deserves someone who treats him a hell of a lot better than I do.
Sam raised his eyebrows.
“It’s—” Castiel tried, before coming across the same block he always did when he thought about it.
“And where are his novels set?”
“It shouldn’t be about maintaining the status quo, Cassie. Your life sucks. You should be aiming for better.”
It was more awkward than hugging Dean—Castiel wasn’t quite sure what to do with his arms—and Gabriel also seemed to be taken by surprise—but when Gabriel finally pulled away with an “Alright, alright. You’re squishing the merchandise,” there was something secretly pleased in his tone.
“I’m coming to your launch too, by the way,” Dean informed him. “And don’t tell me I don’t have to,” he added when he saw Castiel’s expression. “I

like a nerd, Dean’s suddenly sure he’s a nerd that could mess someone up if he wanted to. Still, he accepts the challenge and stares right back.
“Great. And you’ve got a chick’s memory,” Dean grumbled.
“Here,” Dean offered, stripping off his jacket to reveal a shirt similar to the one Cas was wearing, and began undoing buttons. His arms were out of the sleeves and he was starting to peel off his undershirt when Castiel developed the sense to stop him.
“Hopefully, you washin’ your hands,” Dean drawled with a quick glance over his shoulder.
Eventually, the angel huffs at my continued silence, and it’s almost enough to make me smile. Because, yeah, he wants me, but I obviously annoy the shit out of him, too—which is just safer ground for everyone.
Dean blinked rapidly. “…That’s you thinking about nothing?”
When Sam leaves, he doesn’t close the door.
“Yes—but—”
Cas instantly seems skeptical. “This question is non-applicable to me. I am already several millennia over 90 and have had no problem utilizing vessels regardless of the age or gender--” He looks down at his white button-down shirt and black slacks, the oversized clothing hiding a body that, Dean has seen from glimpses, is surprisingly tan and muscular. “I suppose I have grown rather fond of this shape, however.”
Dean’s blood ran cold and he immediately sought out a private place to take out his phone.
“Uh, can you put it on the counter actually? Hands full,” Dean said, lifting his supplies in demonstration.
“Had my suspicions, of course,” he murmured past Cas’s huff. “Considering that this thing,” the actor tapped the area over his own heart, “—started up a forest fire in my chest about an hour ago. ‘M

Dean blushes, “Uh, Cas was the one who—” he makes a swiping motion over his head with his hand, which she takes to mean he is the one who altered her memories.

Dean’s lips became softer—more giving than taking—as he shifted from covering Cas’s mouth with his own to focusing on just the top lip, then just the bottom lip—alternating—sucking lightly—the kiss sliding smoother the wetter it got.
“That’s surprisingly profound, Dean. Maybe you should write fortune cookie messages.”

“But,” he added, extending his arm to grasp the back of Dean’s empty chair beside him. “That’s not really any of my business, is it? I don’t have to like you. I don’t even really know you. Dean likes you. The way he talks… It’s like he’s spent a long time searching for you and now that he’s got you, don’t think he’s letting go until you make him.” His eyes flicked back over to Lisa again and she ducked her head at the sympathy. “I’m not one to get in the way of what makes my friends happy. You understand me, brother?”

Dean steps forward to stop him from tripping, which somehow winds up with his arms around Cas’s waist and Cas’s hands pressed against Dean’s chest. Around them, his fellow interns give nervous chuckles, Benjamin coughing something Cas can’t hear.

Because when I find you—and I will find you—if he is not in one piece, I will take you apart. You understand me?” She hangs up then, but it’s only a matter of time before I’m looking her in the face—watching it dawn on her what a terrible mistake she’s just made messing with a Winchester. I bend the phone in half until it breaks, letting bits of glass rain down on the floor.
He nodded.
“Let me guess…. You learned that from the pizza man?” he asks to break the tension.
thing he wanted was Cas pissed at him, too.
“You’re a cool kid, you know that?” Dean smiles a little sadly. So far, he'd done a good job not thinking about the fact that his soulmate is all set up to be a parent—meanwhile, he's sometimes too lazy to do the laundry for three weeks straight. But at this moment, he almost wishes that he could take Jack home, play Star Wars with him until they both could forget their problems. At least, he seems to have a good thing going here—food, toys, people who care about him. It was more than Dean and Sam got with John a lot of the time.
He wasn’t the only one. “Jesus, Red,” Dean admonished, hands to his ears. “You trying to summon dolphins or what?”
The actor got up with a growl to pace, the bow of his legs somehow even more prominent than usual. “What’s his angle? Get your soulmate to pop out of the woodwork to cause more drama? That’s not even smart. The media is all hot for

what happened between them this morning. You can’t take that shit back. Cas might end up regretting what he said—claiming it wasn’t real or that he changed his mind. But he can’t pretend like it never happened.
Cas had been more intimidated to meet Ben than anyone in Dean’s life—and that was back in the very beginning, when he’d still had every intention of keeping a professional distance from his soulmate. That feeling of uncertainty in Ben’s presence had definitely

“That just means I’m not ableist or whatever. Someone gets too close to Baby—I don’t care who you are—you’re getting some cuss words and the finger.”
“That would be appreciated.”
“Look,” his cousin sighed when it was clear Castiel wasn’t going to answer. “I hate to do this when we just reached your chewy caramel center, but I have to go.”
“Dean…?” a voice repeated.
He was halfway through typing an apology when Dean rang back.
“You mean… an apartment door?” Sam asked as he and Dean both squinted at their screens.
“Longer than 48 hours.”
a little concerned about how close you two have become.”
“Yes,” Cas repeats, stoically.
“It’s my first since… Anyway, it’s probably going to be a disaster, but—that’s the process, right? Have to keep putting yourself out there.”
“Your worry is precious, but I’ve never known a hunter to croak from too much peace and quiet before,” I grumble, cell phone threatening to fall from where I have it cradled between my cheek and neck. I readjust it before it can fall into the pot of chili, which is already billowing steam.
“Get me a new toothbrush while you’re out,” Sam tells Dean as he pulls on his jacket. “And get
Easter eggs:
The car swerves—not enough to take us out of the lane, but enough that I grip the dashboard in front of me. Meanwhile, Dean is white-knuckling the steering wheel. “What is wrong with you?!” I yell, already looking for a place I can demand he pull over—when I notice Bobby is wearing the same expression of tensed-jaw fear.
And yet, it was only when he got back to his apartment an hour later—muscles achy and back sweaty—and picked up his phone again that he began to feel a bit better—not to mention slightly embarrassed by his overreaction.
“Maybe, I just like sitting in the dark by myself.”

know that? They haven’t even said one word to each other.”
And then he did. Still with some of the anger that had been there in the last meeting, but something else too. And the more they looked at each other, the more Dean’s eyes changed—until finally, all the tumblers matched, and something closed off unlocked between them.
I pull out the burner cellphone I’d been given—filled with pictures I sent myself from my Other Half’s phone—and with a few contacts I decided might be useful.

“How are you?”
Dean scrubs the back of his head, where his short hair meets the nape of his neck. “Yeah,” he breathes.
He was out in the hallway—just about to reach the elevator—when his next-door neighbor’s door opened.
“Anyway, he needed to get away from everything in New Orleans and… since we’re still friends, he came here.” There was a question in there—even if one had not been asked.
“Now what?” she asks, when she has the cooler transferred over Samandriel’s head. Even miles away, Castiel can feel—or more likely, just knows—how scared the teenager must be in this situation, his cries muffled but still there.
Dean took another sip of his drink. “You looked like you were going to.”

Castiel had wandered over to his computer, still open to the search results for “What is a bird’s sense of taste like?”, when he heard his phone ding. Considering Naomi had transitioned into talking about his cousin, Raphael, who—according to his Uncle Uriel—was on his way to being top of his class at West Point—he chanced a quick peek at his messages.
A half-hour later, I realize that Dean hasn’t interrupted me once—and when I glance over, that hidden fear in his eyes seems to have lifted somewhat, replaced by a barely-there smile hiding in the corners of his mouth.

“Did I ever tell you about the future Zachariah sent me to all those years ago?” Dean barely pauses before answering himself. “‘Course I didn’t. Never told Sam much of anything about it either.” He scooches forward in order to fully lean back, folding his hands over his chest, and closing his eyes—like he’s telling a bedtime story but also like he’s trying to fall asleep. Those few days shouldn’t have stuck with Dean like they did—considering his memory is crap, considering none of it came true. But they did. They have. Every word Lucifer said with his brother’s mouth. Every look Cas gave him.
Instead, Dean speaks—not even cracking open an eye to look at him. “Stop staring at me—it’s creepy.”
“Is that what you want me to say?”
Dean laughs, causing his body to press against Cas’s more closely, the sound warming Cas from the inside out. “You gotten food yet?” Dean asks; Cas shakes his head ‘no’. “Got to tell you, I was surprised at what they’re serving up at the buffet over there. Onion rings AND fries at a hospital? Took a picture to send Sammy.”

For the next couple of minutes, Dean makes appropriate noises as the Falcon gets chased by enemy ships—and a T-rex. To be honest, he was getting kind of into it when Jack made the ship land on the carpet near Dean’s foot.
“Cheeseburgers,” he says again. “We both like cheeseburgers and comfortable silences and--” He scans his thoughts while licking the slight cut that is on his bottom lip. “We both know that family isn’t just about who you’re related to. Next question.”

His pulse calmed down a little when he realized it was only Charlie asking to be patched through.
He’d look up from his book to find Cas studying him from the other end of the library even though his long fingers held his own volume. The angel sat across from him at their favorite local diner, examining Sam as the hunter read over a menu he knew by heart by now. On movie night, Sam squirmed uncomfortably when he caught Cas watching the side of his face instead of the screen, a frown between the angel’s eyebrows.

around each other. Cas actually asked if he was standing too close to Dean at one point (while he was a good two inches farther away from him than usual). Dean, in turn, offered to stop at some tourist traps on the way home that he thought Cas might be interested in. It’s a new layer added on to their already painful tension—and somehow, we all keep pretending like we don’t notice it.
“Can I inquire what you’re making?” Cas asked, having come over to Dean’s side. Bent in half the way Dean was, this meant his gaze was pretty much lined up with Cas’s crotch—and the actor barely avoided hitting his head again while attempting to stand.
Dean checks Cas’s eyes, which look suspiciously bright. “Yeah?” he double-checks.
She gave a wet laugh.

At one point, Lisa suggested they ask for a clue. “Hell no!” he responded, louder than he meant to, and yet, he was still drowned out by similar answers from Charlie, Dorothy, and Jess. Then Cas noticed that there were colored numbers on the floor, which seemed to match a colored pattern from the first room—and then half the group was scrambling back there, screaming excitedly.

“Dean?!” Another voice exclaims—and it doesn’t matter if it’s said with a three-year-old’s lisp or a twelve-year-old’s awkward crack or a man’s rumble—it’s a voice I’d know anywhere. “Heya, Sammy. Gonna admit, you’ve looked better. Must be getting old.” Because when else is a big brother going to be able to make that joke?
“Anything we have will put you completely under. You won’t be able to dream,” the EMT, Amelia, informs him.
“I’m just worried he’s back there, color coordinating my underwear or some shit.” Dean defends himself, thinking about Cas’s habit of going through his toiletries when he’s bored on cases.
“Fine,” Dean says, shifting on the bed slightly. “I’ll let you win this fight so long as I get to win the next one. Just tell me about newly-created Cas.” Even though he knows it’s not what the angel would have looked like, he can’t help but imagine a pint-sized version of Jimmy Novak, all too big blue eyes and scraped knees.

“I didn’t think it was a mystery, darling.” Balthazar turned to Dean. “You’re up, Mr. Celebrity. Convince him to come with us.”

The youngest Winchester was in the middle of talking about how he and his dormmates hid a dog in their room for two semesters when Sam’s phone buzzed.
“It’s a dermatologist’s office,” he pointed out, pacing the length of the room. “I wasn’t sure how vivid a description you wanted of the various rashes that I see in a day.”

Michael. Which meant that they would see each other—at least occasionally. The word “destiny” came to mind, followed immediately by Dean’s quote from the article, “Fate, destiny—it’s all a bunch of bull-crap.”
They each take seats. Dean passes over the court order, and Brady spends the next ten minutes reading it over carefully.
He was still riding high on his post-orgasmic good mood, which might explain why the sound of the exterior side door bursting open caught him so off-guard. He jerked his head up, hitting it against the top of the fridge.
“Yeah, OK,” Dean breathed in what Castiel thought might be relief. “I’m serious. It wasn’t like a test or anything—but….”
“Ooooh.” Cas sensed Gabriel vibrating from several thousand miles away. “Hand the phone over. I want to talk to Boy Toy.”

Castiel breathes a sigh of relief, even as everyone turns to him, expectantly. “What is Enochian?”
“I killed over a thousand versions of you as a part of Naomi’s brainwashing program,” I confess.
She purposefully looked over his shoulder rather than at his face, but like a magnet, she was slowly drawn back to where she started.

Castiel raised one eyebrow. “So why should I be jealous?”

“Thank you,” the security guard rumbles, face mostly hidden behind the boxes, when Dean opens the door for him.
Now that I’ve re-established a link, I can feel Dean’s curiosity burning through me, but I don’t bother to answer it with words. Instead, I pull up the next memory.
“‘Course it took me a while to realize she was right. It’s part of why this—” Dean gestured between the two of them, “—hella awkward conversation doesn’t actually seem so bad by comparison. I’d rather tell

to. I just—”
And while a part of him thinks it’s dangerous to have any sort of serious conversation when he’s sleep-deprived, the floaty feeling in his head is kinda nice. Things don’t seem as overwhelming at the moment.
And then his mind stops—because he just realized what
“Yes and—strange thing is—not a single one of them remembers seeing you after about 10 o’clock.”
Blinking rapidly, he cast his eyes to the ceiling and left them there.
“Okaaaaay…” A frown formed between Dean’s eyebrows to match the one on his lips. “Well, are you going to tell me what’s up or just Van Helsing me some more? ‘Cause I gotta say—you look hella nervous right now and it’s kind of freaking me out.”
“I’m the car. You’re the iron.”
Dean slumps over his steering wheel in relief. He’s not even quite sure what he’s afraid of—except the knowledge that there is no way in a hell that the son of the Angel Killer and the son of the Angel Killer’s executioner were assigned to be dormmates just because of

Sam looks down at his phone with humor. “If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?”

“I think you already know anything I haven’t said yet. And you’ll tell me when you’re ready to hear it,” Cas explains, leaning slightly into his touch.
Castiel was alternating between scribbling notes for himself on the margins of the script and absently rubbing his chest when the door creaked open a third time. His eyes flicked up. Widened. His pen dropped to the floor.
“—chances are that the layout of the rooms echoes a place that you or your soulmate know well—their home, for example. It’s why people who sleepwalk tend to not run into walls—because they remember all the turns and obstacles.”
…and how it seems…different…from what Sam and Castiel have. I mean, I’d never really had a best friend before—and I’m also not used to angels. Maybe they all stand really close and soul-strip people with their eyes. That’s gotta be the explanation. But I’m not sure if Bobby understands that’s all that’s going on there. Maybe I should tell him. But only if he brings it up first.
He’s almost drifted back off to sleep several times now—always to be interrupted by Dean’s short, “

Dean wanted to believe him. Of course, he did. But looking back on his track record, it seemed like the more he cared about something, the more likely it was to disappear on him. His Mom. His Uncle Bobby. Even Sam had run away for two weeks when he was a kid. Nearly sent Dean into an early grave looking for him…
The young doctor had also confirmed the presence of drugs in Cas’s tea, which he said had only failed to render him unconscious immediately because the sedative used wasn’t meant to be heated. Trace evidence from the mud in the kitchen also revealed black bear scat. Considering the relative rarity of black bear sightings in Kansas, except for in wooded areas on the border with Missouri, it is likely that the Angel Killer lives or regularly hikes in the forests. Of course, that only limits things to a few million acres.
Dean is an Aquarius and, for the first time in his life, he wonders if he should have read his horoscope this morning, just to see if it had any warnings about the sheer number of redheads he’d be dealing with today.

“Dean,” Sam claps the other Me on the back. “Stop being judgmental over something that a version of you did.”
The fresh air helps. It’s a nice day outside—by Dean’s standards anyway. Open leather jacket, warm apple pie and cold ice cream kind of weather. Students rustle past—same as the leaves on the ground. Meanwhile, Hot Guy is quiet, not pressing—just soaking in the moment alongside him.
“You’re kidding, right? That’s freaky, too. I get that Heaven is apparently upside-down Hell, but I don’t know if I wanna find out what happened to make an angel fall like that.”
The two of them were carrying plates over to the kitchen table to eat when an influx of text messages caught Castiel off-guard. “It’s probably Gabriel,” he told Lisa in apology, setting his food down and slipping his phone from his jeans pocket.
“I will

The few times he’d tried to ask his mother about the other half of his genetic makeup, she’d cut the conversation off very quickly—and even the person most likely to know family gossip, Gabriel, seemed not to have a clue.
Dean grumbles an answer that doesn’t contain any actual words.
“Hey, wait,” Dean called, grabbing his arm at the last minute to tug him back. And then, strong arms were around Castiel’s waist and Dean was kissing him.
If Cas had told me any other way, it would be different. I could have said his jokes were getting better. I could have mentioned he was important to me and Sam too. I could have run away only to tell him to

“Huh,” Dean turned off his phone, stuck it in his pocket. “It seems like we were always probably gonna meet sooner or later.”
A tall guy wearing denim-over-denim has his back turned to us, working on the engine of the SUV that was in the surveillance video.
Dean attempts to stifle a yawn. He apparently doesn’t do a good job of it, though, because Charlie points in the direction of her couch. “Go take a load off for 30 minutes.”
At Dean’s snort, the former angel turns to him more fully. Sam can’t see Cas’s face, but he can imagine what his blue eyes are doing just based on Dean’s reaction. “If we watch this now, I’ll watch Tombstone with you tomorrow. Is that acceptable?” Cas asks after a minute.
Dean let out a shuddered breath.
“No. I mean, yes. Not the way you’re imagining.” He sighed. He needed more than icy air with chocolate dust in it for this conversation, so he returned to the fridge for a beer. It was cold and soothing against the back of his throat, and he wondered why he didn’t just start there in the first place.
Cas had said he was going to start thinking of the bunker as home from now on—had seemed to like spending so much time with Dean yesterday—and just because he hadn’t seen him this morning didn’t mean he was having second thoughts about either of those things. And,
“I’m serious. You told Ben ‘everything.’ What does that mean? What was his response? If he was upset, I doubt he truly got over it that quickly.”
“All right, look, she didn't give me her name,” the vet insists, sweat building on his forehead. “When we were done, the driver bailed, I got paid, and then some other chick shows up, and they all drive away.”
Dean glances at Castiel’s bare wrists again and his pulse stutters. Can he be wrong about this? God, his real soulmate is gonna kill him for perving on this random dude five minutes after—

And yes, it’s always in the name of trying to help us or spare us--” Dean pictures crossroads demon deals and the light of angelic grace behind his brother’s eyes and a knife point buried in a book by Cas’ shoulder. “But you still do it and sometimes, it has some shitty consequences.”
Turned out, Crowley had been offered a new position—as a partner at the publishing company Cas’s book was being run through—so they still had to work together for promotional purposes. (“Oh, he’s

His eyes smile even if the rest of his face doesn’t. “Yes. You seem equally excited and disturbed every time I don’t understand one of your references. But then, when we watch the movie, you spend so much time talking over it, I still don’t always get them afterward. Admittedly, you’ve also told me to ‘Shut up, Cas’”—this, he says, complete with air quotes—“for attempting to explain elements that are historically or medically inaccurate, but you only seem to mind if I do it for cowboy movies or Dr. Sexy.” He pauses for a moment. “Apologies. We were discussing movies and Dr. Sexy is a TV show.”

“Why?!” Dean demands.
“Hello, Dean.”
really. But it seemed his agent had been able to lure in a few reporters, wearing badges around their necks or clipped to their shirts. The rest, he assumed were the kind of people who liked to be ‘first’ to new things. Idly, he wondered if any of them had stood in line for the cronut.
with him?!” Gabriel screamed, loud enough that Castiel had to pull the phone away from his ear.
there was no in-game chat feature, but Charlie had shown him how to hook the headphones up to his smartphone so that they could just call each other while playing.
The corners of my lips twitch as I stand, still facing the door. “I know.”
“I…” he grits, attempting to fight what’s coming next. “I also can’t help but wonder if you don’t call because you don’t want to deal with us anymore. I mean, you’re an
” Cas repeated. “You’ve been spending a lot of time with me lately. I wouldn’t want to take advantage of your—or Lisa’s—hospitality by—”
“You’ve said before that you don’t appreciate it when people talk about you to the press,” Cas explained at last. “I thought that you might have been angry that I couldn’t—dissuade them properly or that it seemed like I was using you for the recognition…?”
“For what, Benjamin?” Aaron interrupts with a dangerously raised eyebrow.
Jamie smirks. Just a little, so he probably thought it went unnoticed. “Blonde? Sorry, mate, you got the wrong--”
“As long as you and Sam can avoid getting life-threatening injuries in the next few hours that would require me to be at full strength.
Still, the author had always liked quiet moments at home the best—and now that Lisa seemed fine with it, Cas stayed over at Dean’s place a few times. They made a point of not doing anything intimate there, but just going to sleep together after trading a few soft kisses was amazing—and something that Cas was always greedy to repeat.
“You look ridiculous!” Dean calls after him, just so his brother knows he means it.
“You’re not trying to lift with the spatula really. You’re trying to flip it in place,” Dean instructed Cas on his third attempt, coming behind the other man. He hadn’t been lying before when he said Cas smelled fine. A bit like sweat, but also like fresh-cut grass, and even more strangely, like the Impala. “Imagine it like… turning over a page in a book real fast,” he added.
Dean tries to find fault with his partner’s argument, but ever since they picked Brady up, it’s been hard to think anything except
I don’t think this kid has realized yet that if I break his arm, I can just have Cas fix it afterward and it will do absolutely nothing to
“Most soulmate pairs aren’t—attuned—like that,” she explained while he sunk onto the padded seat. “They would probably feel something if the other died or was seriously, physically injured—like in a car accident—but you shouldn’t be able to tell Dean is—what? Peeved? Annoyed?”
“Oh, and he’s also not allowed to drink either,” Gabriel said, ticking off his fingers as he went down his mental list. “So that 30-year-old Craig he loves so much—he’s gotta throw it out to avoid a penalty. What else? What else? Sam, jog my memory.”
The two of them looked at each other—before clinking their spoons in solidarity.
“But who’s to say that was a net positive?” Castiel had exclaimed, throwing his hands into the air in exasperation.
“But Cas—” Dean tried, even as the author slipped out of the door.
“I…don’t understand,” Cas murmurs, tilting his head to the side.
“Some of it sticks though. Not by choice. It just…does. Like this time he was telling me about how infinity works in math.”
