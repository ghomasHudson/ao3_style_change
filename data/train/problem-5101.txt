“If you're good, maybe I'll let you,” Tony somehow manages to tease, and something dangerous and feral glints in Steve's eyes at his words.
They find their friends in the den as they walk through the house, Thor loudly and enthusiastically clapping Steve on the shoulder, clearly already several drinks deep if the empty plastic cups surrounding him are anything to go by. “Our captain!” he booms. Jane Foster from Tony's Advanced Physics class is perched next to him on the loveseat, sneaking glances his way every few minutes. Clint is sprawled on the couch between Sam and Natasha fielding admirers complimenting him on his winning play. He's laughing and joking but Tony can tell his hearing aids are switched off from his rapid fire signing asking Bucky to get him a drink. Steve waves to the other members of his team where they're gathered by the table of alcohol as they walk by.
Thor’s enormous shoulders are heaving with sobs where he sits next to Bruce, and to their side is an empty chair left for Nat. Clint is on the other side and Tony sees Bucky bury his face in Sam’s shoulder next to him. Scott is openly crying next to Hope and a scowling Hank Pym. Somewhere towards the middle, Carol and Valkyrie are grinning with bright joy. Wanda has a hand covering her mouth, her eyes crinkled by her smile as Vision holds her tight against his side. Strange is sitting with his wizard friend Wong, and T’Challa and his Dora Milaje. Pepper is sitting with May and Happy, next to Morgan, Peter, and Harley at the front. Even from the distance, Tony can see their beaming happiness and eyes glimmering with tears.
Tony isn't sure how long they kiss for, but it's not for nearly long enough. He's breathless by the time Steve moves away, the end of the kiss tapering off slow and languid, turning into sleepy little butterfly kisses peppered along the line of Tony's jaw before ending with little nuzzles of Steve's nose against the sensitive skin of his neck. Tony's heart is jackhammering out of his chest, painful and stuttering but he can't get enough of this, can't get enough of Steve. He curls his fingers into Steve's shirt and holds on tight.
Tony pauses momentarily in the kiss to look out over the open skyline where the sun is sinking low behind the high rises in its descent. The sky is already dark and lights are starting to flicker on around the city, New York spread out in an endless map of sprawling lights a hundred floors below them. He sits up a little in Steve’s lap.
“And it's not like you're going to have a ton of time,” Tony continues, “with orientation and then classes and whatever weird hazing bullshit you macho military people like to do in ROTC and all the new friends you're going to make and you're totally going to forget me—”
“This isn't a violation of the contract?” Steve murmurs against his lips and Tony pauses to look down at Steve's open expression that looks a lot like hope. But that can't be right.
“Yes it does,” Tony says, scowling. “Come on, Rogers, follow along here. It makes perfect sense and it's the best way to avoid all around hurt. And you didn't hear the best part of this proposition.”
Steve is bright and golden, blinding like the sun, and everyone else fades into the background around him. Has he always looked like that, Tony wonders, or is this the rosetinted vision Jarvis told him about?
They lapse into a silence that stretches long and heavy. Outside the Compound, the city looms in the far distance, a small speckling of lights. Tony remembers them being far brighter and much more abundant. Everything is too dark and too quiet, and both hang heavy, physically weighing on Tony’s conscience.
Tony digs deep to find enough willpower to tear his attention away from Steve’s skin long enough to reply with an exaggerated pout and deep sigh, “it hasn’t been a very good morning for me.”
“Have I told you,” Tony muses, making no secret that he’s drinking in the sight of his husband from head to toe, “that black is most definitely your color?”
Tony is at his most comfortable when he’s at home with Steve and their children. He’s usually a ball of kinetic energy and fluttering hands, floating from one end of a room to another, free flowing affection and endless streams of chatter, the embodiment of warmth and love and laughter.
“There’s no greater joy to me than seeing your smile in the mornings, hearing your laugh, listening to you talk about your newest projects, the rapid fire thoughts I can’t hope to keep up with. I'm the luckiest man in the universe because you let me see these private intimate parts of yourself. I marvel often at how perfectly you fit in my arms, and how anyone can be as bright and beautiful and amazing and smart as you.”
“Then what is it?” Steve prods gently. “You’ve been looking upset whenever you walk past it these last couple of weeks. We don’t have to keep it.”
Tony looks over to the far side of the room and sees Steve on the couch bent over a piece of scrap paper, scribbling away with a pencil nub. His brow is furrowed in concentration, bottom lip caught between his teeth as he squints at something on his paper.
He won't see Pepper and Natasha until fourth period lunch and who even knows when he'll see Loki. Loki comes and goes as he pleases and Tony hasn’t seen him in five days. To be fair, Tony probably should not have teased him about how hunky his step brother Thor is. Tony knows Loki will eventually come back around but he is going to pay for that one, he can feel it. He's going to suffer so much.
He nods decisively and hightails it out of there before Steve can reply. He breaks into a run as soon as he rounds the corner, bringing Happy up on speed dial.
who looks inexplicably older and sadder and so, so broken, with furrows in his brow and lines around his mouth Tony has never seen before.
“Hey—” Tony protests weakly, letting the steady rhythm of Steve’s breathing lull him to sleep. The last thing he feels as he drifts off is the feather light touch of Steve's lips against his forehead.
“We always sit together during lunch. We can divide the time in half with some days at the team table, and other days with your friends.” He ignores the second face Tony makes. He is beginning to think they are going to make very bad boyfriends if Steve
Sarah laughs. “Fine, fine, I'll leave you both to it. Holler if you boys need anything,” she says, the smile stretching across her face and crinkling the corners of her pretty blue eyes. “Condoms? Snacks? Let me know,” she chortles as she leaves.
“I always thought if we had enough time,” Steve continues, “we could’ve gotten past this thing between us and maybe one day I could earn your forgiveness. But then—you didn’t come home. We had no choice but to think the worst.”
came out) and finished it around March, but I didn’t feel confident enough in what I had to post it.
They find lethal amounts of diazepam and prozac in her blood, and the press somehow gets ahold of that information. On the Monday Tony returns to school, he’s hounded by journalists on the front steps shouting in his face, “I heard Maria Stark was found dead in her bathtub. Is that true?”
“Is that the only thing you know how to say to me when Tony is around?” Sarah laughs. “He usually has such a mouth on him,” she tells Tony as Steve's scowl deepens.
“This,” Steve says, cupping the side of Tony’s jaw where the Infinity Stones had done irreparable damage and taken his right eye, now milky white and sightless, “this is the receipt from when the universe owes you a debt. You gave
“Everyone makes brownies,” Natasha says, handing Tony the vanilla extract. “That's boring. The holiday bake sale needs more than just a dozen trays of box bake brownies.”
That thought doesn’t stop him from pulling Steve close though, and wrapping his arms around Steve’s broad shoulders as Steve nods and leans down for another kiss. It certainly doesn’t stop him from helping Steve tug his clothes off and draw him close until they’re pressed skin to skin. It doesn’t stop him from breathlessly crying out Steve’s name as Steve busses tender kisses down his body, from neck to ribs to navel and finally to take Tony in his mouth.
The day ends with everyone gathered in the common room with a fire roaring in the hearth, the blaze big enough to warm the cavernous room. Snow is drifting down outside the windows again, pale moon reflected silver glimmering against the dark night sky.
Tony wakes again later that morning when Steve rouses him for breakfast. Tony groans and tries to avoid the morning kisses tickling his jaw by pulling up the covers. What’s the point of a vacation if they can’t sleep in? Steve laughs and leaves him in bed, disappearing into their adjoined bathroom.
The spark of agitation ignites into flame. “It doesn't fucking matter, Rogers,” Tony says, all but baring his teeth. “Your letter was written a long time ago—”
They're interrupted by a kernel of popcorn hitting Steve on the nose, making him go cross eyed as he follows the trajectory to where it drops on the floor. Tony looks up to see Clint with more popcorn in his hand, ready to launch a full on assault.
Steve makes a sound like he's choking on a laugh. “Not my finest moment, sorry. But I meant it then too. It just slipped out at the time because I couldn’t help myself—God, Tony do you even know what you do to me? I can spend my whole life trying to draw and paint you like that morning, haloed by sunlight in our room, wearing nothing but the sheets and the marks I left on you.”
,” Tony breathes, feeling the breath knocked out of him. He can barely speak around the lump that suddenly rises in his throat. “This is so beautiful…. Is that—is that how I really look like to you?”
Steve finds him in the kitchen. Tony startles when warm arms wrap around his waist from behind and he relaxes back against Steve’s chest once he pushes past the fog of his Howard-inspired fugue. He can feel the sharp point of Steve’s chin pressing into the meat of his shoulder as Steve leans in close, his jaw aligned with Tony’s own and he can feel the movement when Steve speaks.
They had fought monsters and titans and the whole world and each other to be together. After everything, how can Tony possibly think there may come a day when Steve will not love him anymore, because of something as trivial as the transient state of a physical body?
Tony can’t help but feel a little flutter in his stomach at the idea of the last part before he sharply reminds himself that whatever notes Steve writes him are not real. He’ll probably be thinking of Peggy when he writes them. Tony swallows the bitter taste on his tongue and looks away to focus on the tablet in his lap. “Sure,” he says, trying his best to keep his voice blank.
Janet gives him a sharp look, her nose scrunched in thought before her expression smooths into a slow smile. “I just know,” she says. “You're smarter than that. I can tell.”
Steve stays curled over Tony’s back for a long moment, nuzzling against his neck. Tony arches back against him, clenching again around his cock as Steve laughs and swats lightly at his ass. Tony pouts when Steve gently pulls out, turning his head to glare.
Up close, Tony can see the shine of moisture glimmering in Steve’s bright eyes. He can’t help himself as he smiles back at Steve, reaching up with one hand to catch one of the tears with his thumb and Steve turns his head to press a soft kiss to his palm, large hand closing atop his.
“I know, I know,” Tony says flippantly. “It's not all that simple, right? I'm sure there are probably things you need to work on to show that you've changed and you can be a better boyfriend now.”
The first thrust always feels like too much as Steve’s dick stretches him wide. Tony moves his hand away from his own cock and reaches back to where his rim is open around Steve, feeling desperate to touch where they’re joined. Steve is barely halfway inside of him, going slow and gentle as always, but Tony has had enough. He sinks greedily down the rest of Steve’s length even as Steve’s hands tighten to bruising around his hips, and pulls him in for a wet and messy kiss.
It takes Pepper shoving a very unsubtle elbow into his ribs to snap Tony out of his temporary stupor and he turns to glare at his best friend. “Close your mouth, Tony,” Pepper chides softly. “You’re going to catch flies like that.” Her tone is gentle despite the teasing, but Tony can see the worry in her eyes.
A growl would be the only way to describe the noise that comes out of Steve as he pounces, claiming his lips with a harsh kiss. Tony arches shamelessly up to meet him in a wet desperate press of lips. Steve carefully stretches him open again as they kiss, his fingers moving in slow thrusts that brush the exact spot that has Tony seeing starbursts behind his eyes. It's ridiculous how quickly and easily Steve learned every sensitive part of his body and all the right touches to make Tony electrified with pleasure.
“Ma was so happy when Buck and I got into our school,” Steve continues. “The testing program paid our tuition and she was so relieved knowing I got into a good school. She thinks there's a better chance of me getting into a good college with our prestige, but if you ask me, it just makes it harder with smartypants like you and Jane Foster always topping the dean's list,” he says. There's no hint of resentment in his voice, but rather something that sounds a lot like pride. “Now we just have to get one of those fancy football scholarships. I think maybe my chances are pretty good after we won state. The Boston College scout was watching the game and he only had good things to say, but there’s that pesky little AP Lit grade I need to bring up.”
Tony laughs, and Steve is gratified to see some of the tension easing from his shoulders and mirth returning to his bright eyes. “Silver fox
“Wow, I'm so proud of you,” Steve tells him, the corner of his lip is tugged up in a grin, his face barely visible from behind the stack of parcels.
. I had these—romantic notions. My mom showed me letters Howard wrote to her and I was inspired. So I wrote some letters of my own. I would write one when I developed a new crush but I never sent any of them. They were just catharsis, my way of letting go of my romantic feelings for the people I write about and they’re not meant to be read by anyone. Yours was written impulsively. No big deal. They don't mean anything,” he adds, clamping his mouth shut before his rambling really takes off.
“Yeah,” he mumbles as Rhodey moves to hug Pepper. He turns away as their hands linger at each other's waists, trying to give his friends some semblance of privacy. He doesn't miss the soft kiss Pepper presses to the corner of Rhodey’s mouth with tears glimmering in her bright eyes.
“I'll ride to Brooklyn with you,” Tony promises, a wide grin tugging at his mouth. “We can make out in the car and annoy Happy. Or you can call your mom and spend the night again. Besides,” he continues, peering up at Steve from beneath his lashes, “if you leave now you're going to miss out.”
Uncle Obie greets Tony warmly enough, but the glare his father directs at him is enough to freeze Tony's blood in his veins. He can see the glass tumbler of amber liquid sitting on the desk by his father’s hand and there's a flush high on his cheeks. He knows what that means, but Starks are brave, so he stands taller and raises the bot in his hands to show his dad.
“Doesn't mean you should treat it like rent,” she says. “Now let’s go. You can finish this another day. You can come back tomorrow. But we are going to get some food now and then
Steve has been getting increasingly panicked about him if his texts and notes are anything to go by. His messages keep asking him how he's doing and his little handwritten notes keep imploring him to eat and reminding him that coffee does not count as a food group.
“Fucking dead is what you'll be soon,” Loki replies, merciless, yanking hard at his arms. “We're going to be late for the game. The only seats left are probably the highest sections now, and it's all your fault.”
Steve takes him to a little deli at the end of the block. It’s a small squat bodega cramped next to a high end furniture store. The front has a hand-painted sign and there are wooden stands full of slightly wilted flowers near the door. The interior is stocked with overflowing shelves filled with cereal and baby food and cleaning supplies with a wall of clunky old glass faced refrigerators housing endless brands of soda and artisanal waters towards the back. A long counter housing enough candy to make Willy Wonka jealous sits towards the front with a grill somewhere in the far back and a handwritten menu listing sandwiches hangs overhead. Tony shouldn't even be surprised anymore, but the guy behind the counter knows Steve by name too.
Tony doesn’t let him get away this time. He raises his arms to loop them around Steve’s neck, drawing him in for another kiss. He coaxes Steve to deepen the kiss with little nips until his husband concedes with a sharp intake of breath, and their tongues are sliding together as Tony presses in closer. Steve’s hands tighten their grip at his waist, thumbs stroking along the dip of his back where his own ink and Steve’s stamp sits on his skin below the layers of his suit, and Tony burns with the need for
“But I'm so close,” Tony says, despite the glare Pepper levels at him. “A breakthrough is three hours away, max.”
Steve ignores the comment but he greets no less than eight people who come up to his locker to talk to him. After what feels like an eternity, he finally finds what he's looking for and stuffs the book into his bag.
Tony is so absorbed in his own thoughts he doesn’t hear the sliding doors open until it’s too late. There’s a soft “oh!” behind him and he turns to see none other than Peggy Carter standing on the deck with him. Speak of the devil, he thinks bitterly.
“We’re going to get started on some cookies,” Loki declares, his voice too bright, too cheerful. “You're just going to get underfoot and mess up the recipe again. Shoo! Off with you.”
Steve tries to talk about it the next morning, and the day after, and the day after that. But each time he tries to bring up the subject, Tony panics and distracts him with desperate kisses until they forget they were ever trying to talk at all.
… Only mutually approved posts on social media… No kissing… Wow, this is a lot. Tony, how are we supposed to sell this relationship if we don’t even touch?”
“It does make me happy to see you happy, Anthony,” Jarvis says. “There is nothing I want more in this world than for you to be happy and warm and loved.”
Steve laughs and steps back. Tony immediately wants to reach up again and draw him in again but Steve is already moving away to his side of the closet. Tony watches the long strides as Steve walks up to his rack of tuxes, carefully pulling a black velvet number off the hanger before going to the other end of the room with his jacket in one hand and shoes in the other. Tony eyes the red bottoms hanging off his finger with no small amount of happiness. Steve has come a long way from ill fitting suits off the sale rack and brandless dress shoes to bespoke Faragamo and Louboutin. Tony is very proud of him.
Steve loves him beyond that. He loves the very core of Tony, his person and mind and soul. But if Tony has any question of Steve’s love for him, clearly he must be doing something wrong. He must work harder to wipe any such doubts from his husband’s mind.
“And,” he continues before Steve can answer, sliding his phone across the table and tapping the screen to wake it up, “we’re trending on Twitter. It’s humiliating for both of us now if we don’t do this. The whole school already knows. The whole goddamn city knows. We can pretend to date for a few weeks, maybe a few months max, and then we amicably break up and everything will blow over. I get to keep my friends without fucking things up and you get Peggy back.”
Excitement is buzzing through the gathered masses in their seats as everyone eagerly waits for the game to begin. The sun has long set and the sharp October night air is inky crisp blue. The stadium is washed in bright white halogens, enormous spotlights that cast everything in cutting clarity with sharp shadows on the edges and there’s a wet breeze in the air that promises rain for the upcoming weekend. The brass band is already playing as the cheerleaders hop and jump and somersault across the field.
By the last leg of their trip, Steve has a suitcase full of trinkets from Alcúdia and the Quartier Habous and Casbah for Morgan, Peter and Harley, little clay sculptures and hand beaded jewelry and sweet jams and leather bound journals that he thinks they will like. Tony looks on indulgently as he strolls hand in hand with Steve through the cobblestone streets of Fira, his husband (god, Steve is his
Tony smiles but doesn't say anything. He presses his cup-warmed hand over Steve's name, scraping his nails lightly over the silk thread and settles in to watch the game as the brass band marches onto the field to open the first quarter.
Rhodey listens sympathetically and doesn't say anything as he tells him about the letters, the plan to get Peggy back, the fake relationship, how much it hurts to actually lose Steve. Tony had expected sympathetic anger maybe. He remembers the shovel talk and thought Rhodey would jump at the chance to punch Steve in his perfect teeth, but instead he sighs and gives Tony an unreadable look when he winds down from his explanation.
“It’s not,” Steve agrees. “But I would’ve still protected my friend. Just like I would’ve protected you if it was you on that end of the battle.”
Tony laughs again, the sound even uglier this time. “I know you're trying to make me feel better, but it's not really working. No one really loves me, J. I've accepted that.”
On one occasion, he brings Tony a breakfast burrito that tastes so good, his eyes nearly roll into the back of his head at the first bite and he’s sure the sound he makes when he takes his second bite is positively obscene. Tony is wholly impressed with Steve’s skill in making various breakfast foods.
“Shut up, I’m a senior citizen,” Steve returns. “I’m allowed to be confused. But you’re still my gorgeous, young, silver fox husband,” he adds, punctuating each word with a kiss just to see Tony smile. “And I’m the old man who gets to have him.”
before his tenuous hold on lucidity finally gives and he slips down into the darkness that swallows him whole.
Tony's whole world grinds to a screeching halt, and the shock hits him so hard, he nearly falls over. His knees are weak and his legs are unsteady, he thinks he might throw up.
“Yep,” Tony replies. “Top secret and all. Happy is on your six and I have a Dragunov across the street waiting on my signal if this doesn’t go as intended. Red dot on your forehead and everything.”
The class has just started learning letter writing and correspondence, and Tony hates it. He sees no reason to write letters that are meant to be sent through snail mail when there were texts and emails and instantaneous communication with modern shorthand and popular colloquialism. The idea of a physical letter on paper feels archaic and wasteful. What's the point of waiting so long for something when they can communicate at the speed of light?
Steve, Tony decides, is a little shit. And Tony—Tony is so very, very fucked. Especially when Steve has the audacity to ask—
“Look, Rogers,” Tony says, not unkindly. “It’s not that I don’t trust you not to spill all my secrets to the press and sundry but I really can’t take that risk. Especially not with college next year, and my dear old dad breathing down my spine about keeping a squeaky clean image for Stark Industries. It’s nothing personal. It’s just business. Now, please
“Unless you have a guest room I don’t know about, yes, Steve,” Tony says slowly, waking up a bit more. “Don’t be a blushing virgin now, you’ve slept over at mine several times now. You already know I snore but I won’t grope you in my sleep.”
Tony takes a shaky breath. “Steve and I made up the relationship,” he confesses, the words feeling like thorns stuck in the side of throat, and it's all he can do to get them out. “We pretended to be dating to make his ex-girlfriend jealous. So she'll take him back.”
“I dunno,” Steve says with a crooked smile. “It certainly adds another level of excitement to do it in public, doesn’t it?”
Tony quietly swears up a blue streak when he realizes it's Pepper and he really doesn't want to deal with this right now. Everything is such a mess, he's going to hurt her and Rhodey one way or another, and they're going to realize it's not worth it to be his friend, he's too much effort, he's too messy, he's too selfish, she probably read the letter already, he can hear the confusion and regret in her voice, and oh god why did he ever write those letters he's so dumb and stupid and childish to do something so ridic—
He barely notices the days passing, the hours smudging into one another, and he loses sense of time as the minutes tick past while he’s frantically trying to solve equations and calculate measurements. Every inch of his dry erase board and all of his monitors are filled from corner to corner with numbers.
Tony hums quietly to himself as he stands at his vanity, pulling out drawer after drawer of neatly organized trays. He taps at his chin thoughtfully as he browses his collection, running gentle fingers along each watch face as he thinks.
He doesn't wait for Steve to say anything else, shoving past him to get into the car and slams the door shut.
“Me neither,” Steve says, moving in very close to be heard over the loud music. “Never really danced before.”
“Oh my god,” Tony groans as Steve laughs. “If I knew you were going to go into that big brother mode of yours, I would've shut the door in your face. I take back what I said earlier. I'm shipping you back to your precious university right now. Get out of my house.”
your job to spoil him, so this is good so far. Because my best friend deserves the world, Steve, I'm sure you know that.”
Tony barely pays any attention to the game, spends the whole time tucked up against Pepper’s side, munching listlessly at what's left of his popcorn. He can't stop thinking about the odd looks Steve is always giving him and he spends the entire last quarter trying to dissect what they can possibly mean.
Tony comes first with Steve’s tongue in his mouth and his hand stroking his dick. After Tony comes clenching tight around him, Steve’s thrusts grow erratic as he chases his own orgasm, Tony coaxing him along with breathy encouragement whispered against his ear.
is a hackneyed Frankenstein of a ship, desperately cobbled back into functionality with parts begged and stolen from planets Tony never thought he would see. It’s barely any better than a junkpiled plane and it already took damage passing through the strato and atmospheres. One more hit from anything would’ve killed them. The landing was more crash than landing, and Tony is amazed they even survived.
He makes to shove past Steve again but his stupid giant shoulders are filling up the entire doorway. Steve wraps his hands around Tony's arms as though to stop him and Tony jerks out of his grip.
It’s not so bad, Tony thinks as they wait on the platform for the next downtown train. It’s only moderately crowded, the odd time of day slotted right between the end of school rush and the beginning of rush hour means they’re barely jostled as other commuters jockey for position on the subway platform, craning their necks out onto the tracks to see if they can catch the headlights of the approaching train coming from the dark maw of the open tunnel.
They spend the entire blissful month of January exploring the new facet of their nonrelationship with enthusiasm, ambition and a lot of creativity. Which is to say, it's nearly gotten them in trouble several times when they can't keep their hands off of each other during school.
Steve stands close to Tony the entire time, his bulk a warm press against Tony’s side and his hand a warm grip around his fingers. It’s really not bad at all, Tony decides when the train arrives with a
“Oh, Anthony,” she sighs, taking him by the hand. She tugs him upstairs and gestures for him to sit by the foot of her bed as she goes to rummage in her huge walk-in closet.
Tony may not know the rules of the game, but he can't help the swell of pride he feels when it looks like Steve scores a point. His eyes track Steve the entire time, watching the impressive display of muscle and strength as he powers through the water, proving again and again that he, Bucky, and Clint are an indomitable team, no matter the sport they play. The guys on the opposite side don't stand a chance. They end up drawing quite the audience, and there are admiring spectators lounging by the side of the pool to watch by round two.
Tony leans his head on Pepper’s shoulder and refuses to stand as their team is announced. Pepper takes one of his hands in hers and squeezes softly.
Tony pauses, pushing away slightly to look at Steve. “Yeah, I do,” he finally says after a beat. He hates how low his voice gets when he says it and he's certain Steve knows he's not just talking about body parts. “I really fucking do. I can't fucking believe the first time you said that to me, you were telling me to brush my teeth.”
“This,” Steve says, tracing the three inked Ms on Tony's chest, right beneath his heart, “is for our daughter. Our baby girl, who loves you so much. She gets to grow up in a safe world because of you. You’re the best dad in the world, and she loves you
Steve's other friends had the common decency to not make any other comments on his new relationship and Barnes had ignored him for the rest of the day. Tony was perfectly fine with that. The other team members were friendly enough and he knew Thor by proxy of his stepbrother Loki.
It's probably one of the most luxurious things Tony has ever experienced to wake up in the morning with Steve in bed next to him. The sun is just starting to rise in the silver hours of morning, washing the room with cold light and painting them in shades of purple and blue. The snow glimmers outside like mounds of diamonds, beckoning ice cold but the snowfall has stopped and the day is promising to be clear with blue cloudless skies.
Steve must’ve noticed his frown because he reaches over and drags Tony close with an arm around his shoulder. His side is a warm line against Tony’s arm and he settles closer shamelessly, letting the rumble of Steve's voice soothe his rising anxiety. “I'm a fast learner. I'm already adjusting.”
Time seems to stop when Steve is settled between his legs like this, and all Tony knows is the sensation of his husband's mouth against the most intimate parts of him. He’s over-sensitive and overheated, cock flushed and pressed against the chaise with nowhere to go and no friction to be had as Steve holds him down, licking into him again and again until Tony is an incoherent mess. Nonsensical words and sounds tumble from his lips, pleas and moans for more as he tries to push back against Steve. Silver edged darkness begins to creep into the corners of his vision as he tips further and further towards the edge, but just when he thinks he can come on Steve’s tongue alone, Steve pulls away and Tony nearly sobs.
Of course Steve has got him, he always does. He always takes such good care of Tony. Steve who is so tender and gentle and loving as he worships every inch of Tony’s old and scarred body, reminding him these scars were the price of saving the universe, Steve is so proud of him, he always will be, he loves him so much.
Tony leans up for another long kiss, one that deepens into something soft and slow, and Tony can’t get enough of him, can barely believe he can have this, have
“Just Boston,” Tony repeats to himself, feeling slightly numb. “It's not like that's all the way in fucking Massachusetts.”
He doesn’t say any of this. He can’t bring himself to tell even Steve the full extent of his relationship with his father and even his dearest friends know only the surface story, but he warms a little at the genuine sincerity he finds in Peggy. There is authentic empathy there and quiet strength. This must be why Steve loves her, he thinks, and doesn’t feel entirely bitter about that thought for once.
That night feels like a lifetime ago, and Tony feels numb now as he rips the newsprint to shreds. It doesn’t make him feel any better for having destroyed it. Tony rubs his hand over his chest and he can feel the emptiness echoing as though everything's been torn out of him and all he has left is the familiar agony of heartbreak.
“A proposition?” Steve asks, sounding amused. The Sullen Steve Stare melts away into a small smile as he leans forward. “Well hello to you too. This feels like a spy exchange”
Steve chuckles. His cheek is pressed flush against Tony's and Tony can feel the smile curving Steve's mouth as he says, “I guess we're all a bit nerdy. Don't let the football uniforms fool you.”
Tony can't quite help the smile that tugs at his lips, and he's sure he looks like an idiot as he all but traipses to his next class. It's so silly, to feel his heartbeat quicken simply because of a couple of words on a piece of notebook paper. Definitely spontaneous onset fever. That's the only possible explanation for his suddenly erratic heartbeat and the strange warmth building in his chest.
Steve winces away from Tony’s ice cold fingers and wraps them between his own sleep warm hands. He pulls them forward to press soft kisses against the knuckles.
The walk from the subway station to Steve's house is a short one but Tony has never actually walked through any part of Brooklyn before. Sure, he's been to the little diner his mother loved and once to the botanical gardens for a fundraising event, but he's usually driven to these places by Happy or Jarvis, and that night he had met Steve in Brooklyn to sign their contract was too dark to see much.
and let him have waffles and ice cream for dinner. Where she gave him quarters for the jukebox and bopped her head to “You Can't Hurry Love.” Where her touch was warmer and her smiles were brighter. Where she sighed and told Jarvis who looked very sad when she said, “just give me another minute and I'll be ready to leave, Edwin.”
He can see the quickening rise and fall of Tony’s chest as the moments pass and Steve’s hands dip lower to linger at his hips. If Steve spreads his fingers, the span of his hands can almost entirely encircle Tony’s waist. That’s a thought that’s always heated Steve to the core, the very notion that he can hold so much of Tony in his hands. Seeing it in the mirror quickens Steve’s breath and fans the embers igniting in his chest.
“Not yet,” Pepper replies with a fondly exasperated smile. “But I think I get the idea. And here—” she hands Tony a pen and spare notebook when she sees that Tony had come to school empty handed, yet again. “We need to have a long talk about forgetfulness.”
Steve listens with rapt attention, not interrupting once, but once Tony is done pointing out the different projects, he says with a sorrowful tone, “you hate doing this.”
That's why they get along so well, despite their vast differences in personality. They all have their own shit, and really out of everyone, Loki is probably the least likely to judge him, with similar family dysfunction and even more skeletons in bigger closets and money older than Howard can hope to dream of—
For the first month of school, he often sauntered into homeroom late with coffee in hand. Loud mouthed and full of childish arrogance, he knew he was smarter than everyone else including the teachers, and he wasn’t shy to let others know that. Tony can admit now, he was a bit of a dick. Naturally, that drew the bullies like blood in water drew sharks.
Eventually Tony’s mind spins in circles until he thinks he might go crazy if his lab is silent any longer. He puts on a playlist and pushes the volume higher to drown out the rest of the guilt he feels and the yammering pestilent thoughts. On the fourth day, he turns off his messages and sends all of his calls to voicemail.
“Let’s be honest though,” Tony grumbles, “I met your mom totally by accident. We didn’t even know she was coming home early that day and that was kinda embarrassing and Sarah is never going to let us live that down—”
Tony could've graduated early and followed Rhodey to Boston. Why the hell didn’t he think of that? It’s not too late. Another option is finishing his senior year in Boston. It isn't too late to transfer now, is it? It is only the third week of August, he probably still has time and he can probably pay admissions to make it all go faster, and if he grabs his transcripts now and gets his application in before the semester starts—
“Of course I have,” Tony says, not quite able to look Pepper in the eye. “I shouldn't have written those letters. I should never have let anything get between our friendship.”
“I, um, saw that the Museum of Natural History has this new special exhibit on space exploration,” Steve says, still not quite looking at Tony. “I saw it on their website and it made me think of you—I mean, it seems like something you might like. So uh, you know, if you want to go—“
“That’s not what I mean,” Steve says, sighing in frustration. “I—I just know you’re a better man than that, Tony. You would’ve regretted killing anyone. Especially since you’ve given so much to protect people. You would’ve regretted killing a brainwashed man who wasn’t himself when he—did what he did.”
Maria returns with an old fashioned hatbox in her arms. The box is enormous and round, a cylinder of hideous faded blue jacquard silk embroidered with branches of gardenias and birds hiding between the leaves. The fabric is peeling at the edges, dark cardboard peeking through the tattered seams. Tony wonders why his mom would even keep such an ugly old thing when she has mountains of lacquered black boxes topped with white silk camellias and piles of bright orange boxes printed with horse carriages Tony knows are filled with very expensive things.
But to have known Howard as a man like this, someone who had loved her so much and to have once been good and soft and loving, Tony thinks he would've wanted to cling to the memory and live in the past too. He now understands the
Tony smiles down at his arm as Steve’s broad thumb strokes along the bone at his wrist and lifts his hand to press a kiss to the back of it. He raises Tony’s other hand, the metal one, and kisses the alloy knuckles too. Tony is so grateful for the new implant that allows him to feel that soft touch in his prosthetic, but before Tony has the chance to pull him in for another, real kiss that will most definitely make them late, Steve laughs and steps away.
Thank you to everyone who’s stuck by this fic and gave it a chance! Here are a couple of little trivia things I can share now that the fic is done:
Not for the first time, Tony wonders fondly how someone like Steve Rogers even exists. He shakes his head. “No,” he admits. “But I want to.”
“Oh, did we?” he asks, perplexed. He tries to recall but his memory is failing him. “I don't really remember.”
The look Steve gives him is unreadable. “Yeah, maybe,” he agrees. “Maybe things would've been different.”
And every time they pass Peggy in the halls and Steve turns that same bright smile on her, Tony feels washed cold and brittle. The vise in his chest tightens and tightens until he can barely breathe, and he feels as though he can shake apart into a million pieces if not for the warm press of Steve against his side.
Tony almost does a double take when he sees Bruce. Bruce, for lack of a better word, looks haggard. There are grey streaks in his temple, and the normally warm eyes behind his glasses are dark ringed and glassy with exhaustion. There are furrows around his mouth and lines in his forehead, deepening when he looks from Steve to Tony, but he doesn’t say anything when Steve gets up silently from his chair and leaves the room.
The diner Tony asks Steve to meet him at is a little hole in the wall in Brooklyn, a real neighborhood joint. It’s the one that Maria had taken him to a couple of times during some of her good days. The shabby rundown little coffee shop is the same as it was years ago. Everything is still beige and the floors are still stained and the vinyl booths are still cracked.
They land with explosive force just outside of the New Avengers Facility, kicking up a storm of dry dust that blocks out the windshield and coats the ship in grime. In the singular moment when the particles of dust hang suspended in the air, Tony thinks about his friends. For that brief morbid second, the memories of Titan flash before his eyes, the sharp acrid smell of smoke burning his nostrils as they all turned to dust. He has to forcibly keep his mind from tumbling down that rabbit hole again, not when he’s yanking desperately at the unresponsive controls, and Nebula is yelling next to him.
There's talk of a party at Thor's house as the stadium slowly empties, where there's an abundance of expensive alcohol and a distinct lack of caring parents.
“Later, sweetheart,” Steve says and ignores Tony’s pout. “Pepper will murder us if we miss another gala.”
Tony pauses mid bite and turns to look at him. Steve is gazing out over the crowd, where a group of tourists are posing by the fountain. He watches Steve watch them as they do Fortnite poses for their photo.
Tony briefly assesses his locker to see if he can fit inside of it (he cannot) and pretends to closely examine the contents, ignoring the call of his name. It's not until he feels a hand on his shoulder before he flinches and slams the door shut a little too loudly. The clang of metal echoes in the empty hallway. He doesn't want to turn.
“Your friends are a bunch of losers,” Tony murmurs in Steve's ear, pressing the words close so the others don't hear. He thinks he might've failed when he catches Bucky’s glare directed at him. He blows him a kiss.
That is all Tony can take before he runs out of the study, leaving the pieces of his bot scattered on the carpet. He will be stronger, Tony promises himself. Stark men are made of iron. He
Tony settles himself into one of the lounge chairs with his coffee by the edge of the pool to watch. The linen towel lining the bench is already warm from the morning sun shining overhead. He lays down comfortably on his back with a soft sigh, cradling his cup in his hands and trains his gaze on the water. He settles in to work on his tan and waits for Steve to notice him.
“I can ask Happy to drive you back later,” Tony says, trying not to sound like he's begging but he desperately wants Steve to stay. He doesn't want to be left alone with his cold realization, to have to face it by himself, and think of what it'll mean for the not too distant future. “Stay for now.”
Tony wonders. Steve deserves to be happy, that much he knows, because Steve has only ever been good and righteous and strong. But Tony himself has done more than his fair share of harm, and he doesn’t know if he deserves to ever be absolved of the guilt and pain and the weight of his own consequences. He sighs and raises his arm, palm upturned.
“Oh fuck,” Tony moans, catching Steve’s lips in another searing kiss as second finger joins the first inside him. They move in slow shallow thrusts, stoking the flame at Tony’s core, and he needs
Tony feels like throat closing in one part panic, and two parts fear. “No, I don't,” he lies. “What you see is what you get.”
Tony nearly chokes on his drink. He tries to imagine Steve pompously name dropping and nearly dissolves into a fit of laughter. “Probably not,” he says, chuckling. “They’ll probably skip
“Hey there, beautiful,” Steve whispers as he drinks in the sight of his husband spread out underneath him. Tony is all gilded skin and lean muscle and dark eyes surrounded by inky lashes, Steve’s beloved and only. He closes his hands around the tops of Tony’s thighs to draw him in closer and with some gentle coaxing and encouragement, Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist.
“Aw, are you jealous, darling dearest?” Tony recovers enough to snark. “You know you’ll always be my favorite.”
“Pepper gave me the keycode when you didn’t answer her calls,” Steve says, ignoring Tony’s mutters about betrayal. He pushes a brown paper bag into Tony's hands. “And what do you mean you haven’t slept in
Hatched in ballpoint is a drawing of him asleep in bed, backlit with the sunlight spilling from the windows behind. His shoulder is bared with the edge of the sheets trapped in his fist, his other hand outstretched as though reaching for Steve. His hair is a riot of curls, looping circles spread on the crosshatched pillow, with dark lashes dusting the crest of his cheeks. He looks so soft in the drawing, expression lax as he sleeps, looking for all the world like he's having the best of dreams. Tony sighs and replaces the paper on the nightstand for safekeeping as Steve walks back into the room with only a towel wrapped around his waist.
are my best side,” Steve had said nonsensically, pulling him close for a kiss. Tony couldn't help groaning at the time, despite how warm his heart had felt on that cold winter night after hearing those words.
Steve knows this isn’t all it takes to fix the issue and to eliminate the pertinacious negative thoughts in Tony's head. He would be arrogant to think so. It’s going to take a lot of hard work and love to pull Tony back out of the dark he more and more often slips into, but that’s a challenge Steve is more than willing to tackle head on. It’s what he had knowingly signed on to do with their wedding vows, and it’s a privilege to even be the one who can try.
Everything was an arms length away. All he had to do was extend his hand. A whole world just inches away.
Steve is waiting in the hall just outside his physics room when class lets out. The rest of the class stare unashamedly at the both of them as they file past even as Tony stands stockstill in front of his fake boyfriend in the middle of the hall, disturbing the flow of traffic and feeling unsure of himself. The note is still clutched in his hand. He quickly shoves it into his pocket.
Tony hums in agreement and tucks his nose in the space between Steve's neck and shoulder. The smell of coconuts and ocean settles him, and he lets the rhythm of Steve's breathing lull him into contented silence. They don't say anything for a long time, simply laying in the fort together cocooned in warmth and ignoring everything outside of their little world.
“I loved you then,” Steve replies. “I love you now, and I love you more and more with every passing day.”
“Are you doing this to torture me?” Steve asks, his eyes flicking up to Tony’s face again. His voice is gravel rough and his grip on Tony’s ass tightens.
“No,” Steve says, agitation rising in his voice. “I shouldn’t have let you walk away that day. I shouldn’t have given up so easily. I should’ve tried harder. I should’ve—I'm not getting out of the way until you hear me out because it
Tony smiles and arches closer, warmth washing over him. He wishes so hard for the truth in those whispered words, everything aches with the fervency of his desire. He's sure Steve can feel his echoing loud heart beneath his fingertips.
“No,” Tony says sharply, all the strength he’s tried to gather slipping from his grip. There’s only so much he can take when Steve says his name like that. His wrist burns where Steve still has his fingers wrapped around it. “This went way too far and got out of hand because we were both trying to scratch an itch. What, did you really think I still feel the same way I did when I wrote that stupid letter?”
who jogs up to them with wild disbelieving hope in his eyes and tears shining on his cheeks highlighted by the wane moonlight above.
“I really like dinosaurs,” Tony blurts out, sounding way too eager to be talking about a pile of old bones, because apparently his intelligence is at an all time low when Steve is touching him in any way.
“We broke up a few weeks ago and we’re just friends now,” Steve continues. His voice is sad and regretful and the lost expression on his face twists painfully at Tony's heart. He obviously cares a lot for Peggy. “But of course, I'm not going to get between this thing you have with Pepper.”
On the third and fourth days, he skips school, uncaring of the rumors and things he knows are being said about him. He walks through his house like a specter, barely lucid enough to form coherent thoughts. He's listless and empty and everything hurts. From all of the times his heart has been broken and remade shard by shard, he doesn't remember it ever feeling like this.
Steve nods as though gathering himself. “What you saw in the hallway—with Peggy, that was not anything, I swear.”
“Come on, you useless cretin,” Loki snarls as Tony hangs limply from his clutch. “You're awfully heavy for someone so fucking puny.”
“Not a word out of you, Rogers,” Tony growls as they finally step off the train somewhere deep in Brooklyn. Tony's legs are feeling just the slightest bit wobbly and he might or might not feel like he's going to throw up all over Steve's shoes any second now. Steve only smiles and holds out his hand for Tony to take as they climb the steps out of the station.
Tony startles and nearly knocks over his tea when Jarvis reaches over to pat his hand. In that instant, he feels so small, like he's a child with a scrape on his knee again, coming to Jarvis for a bandaid and comfort. He had known with such conviction when he was little that Jarvis could protect him from anything, fix anything, and he wishes fervently Jarvis could fix his broken heart now too.
Steve presses a soft kiss to Tony's temple. “Please let me finish. I’m going somewhere with this, I promise,” and he waits for Tonys halting nod before he continues, “This,” Steve says, raking gentle fingers through Tony's greying hair, salt and pepper between warm mahogany brown, “is a life well lived. You experienced so much and it’s only made you stronger and better. Gold might be your color, but silver is beautiful on you.”
On the first day, he can barely get out of bed. He wakes up with his face wet with tears after a handful of hours of fitful sleep and wishes he didn’t have to go to school. He stubbornly drags himself to class, ignores every single one of Steve's attempts to talk to him and pointedly walks in the opposite direction when Clint and Bucky try to get his attention. His phone blows up with missed calls and messages. He ignores every single one of them. He blocks Natasha’s phone number.
Steve obliges him with a chaste peck, but pulls away to say, “go brush your teeth,” with a lopsided smile.
“Well, I'll take your word for it, Steve,” she says lightly, the corners of her lips tilting up. “But a reminder that you have a perfectly nice bedroom upstairs,
Rhodey’s smile widens. “I know,” he says gently. And of course Rhodey knows. He’s the only one Tony’s ever told of his childhood crush on Captain America. “I remember the Captain America posters in our dorm, years and years ago, and the action figures. Remember that one time I walked in on you with th—”
Sarah prepares Christmas dinner for just the three of them on Christmas Eve, with the big Christmas dinner taking place with family on the actual holiday. Steve had invited Tony to go with them to his aunt’s house for the big dinner, but Tony thinks they’ve taken things too far already for a fake relationship. While he doesn't regret meeting Sarah Rogers for even a single second, he would feel like a fraud going to his big family holiday dinner. So he lies, saying Howard expects him at some Stark Industries gala for that day.
“Yeah?” Steve says. He seems to take it as a challenge, and resumes his kisses with new determination, leaving Tony breathless and overheated as he squirms in Steve's lap.
Tony owns his whole being, and Steve had always been willing to lay his beating cracked heart at Tony’s feet, years spent hoping for the day Tony finally thinks he’s worth keeping. Steve belonged to him even when they were on the opposite ends of a battlefield, and now that Steve gets to finally have Tony, has had him for years now, the excitement and novelty never leaves. Steve is overwhelmed with wondrous elation every time he gets to be this close to Tony.
”s. She’s as immune to Steve’s charm and good manners as any poor mortal soul met with the full brunt of his apple pie warmth, and much to Tony's amusement, she adopts them both on the spot. She insists they call her
Tony sees Peggy dancing with someone from the corner of his eye and ignores the sour taste that bubbles up behind his throat. He turns slightly so he no longer sees her and reaches up to pull Steve closer, letting the coconut ocean smell wash over him.
Jarvis gets out of his seat and comes to stand next to Tony. He strokes a hand through Tony's hair like he used to do when he was a boy, a habit Jarvis hasn't indulged in years and one Tony doesn't realize he missed as much as he did until he aches from the familiarity of the touch.
Steve hums, a deep bass rumble Tony feels against his spine. The vibrations travel along his shoulders until he feels as if he’s tingling all over. He doesn't resist when Steve turns him with gentle hands on his shoulders but when Steve presses a kiss to his forehead, Tony freezes, not expecting it. He melts slowly when Steve's lips linger against his skin, fingertips branding hot where they rest at the nape of Tony's neck.
“Maybe when I was like, five,” Tony replies, still perplexed as he finds himself staring at Steve covering the nest of blankets he made on the floor.
“Steve…” Tony says warningly, his voice tapering into a sharp gasp when Steve sucks at the column of Tony’s neck and scrapes his teeth against the sensitive skin.
in his back pocket. He groans and sets the bowl on the counter. They're going to have to make another grocery run. Maybe cookies will be a better idea.
All these months, wondering who sent out the letters, wondering if it was his own stupid fault for misplacing them, wondering if the press dug through his trash again, berating himself for probably donating them by accident, wondering if it was all a cruel joke. All these months, and it was Natasha, of all people who had done this to him.
Pepper sighs as she reaches a hand up to brush Tony's hair away from his forehead. “He told me you haven't slept all week for one,” she says. “He also told me you've been feeling guilty about me.”
On impulse, Tony reaches up with one hand to cup Steve's face, and presses a kiss to his jaw. Clint makes a gagging noise. There's a pink flush high on the crest of Steve's cheeks but he's looking at Tony with an unwavering gaze, seemingly unnoticing of Peggy five tables away. Steve's eyes are ridiculously blue, and Tony
They move languidly for long moments, savoring the feeling of each other’s skin as they kiss, unhurried and undemanding. There’s quiet beauty in soft moments like these but Tony is capricious, and his patience only lasts so long.
Tony is gathered in the living room with his favorite people in the world, with the promise that Pepper will come by later with Rhodey who is finally home. Calling Rhodey hadn't been easy, but he had sighed much the same as Pepper, called him silly for worrying anything could've come between their friendship (“we've known each other for ten years, Tones. Have a little trust, man”) and promised to box his ears the moment he comes through the door for not telling him about Steve firsthand and he had to hear it from Pepper. All in all, Tony is relieved Rhodey is home.
The Tower rooftop is lit up in a way even Tony has never seen before. The city below them is set aflame by the setting sun as it dips behind glass walls, sparkling orange and pink and purple as it goes. Tiny twinkling lights that shine like starlight stretch across the span of the roof, a canopy of constellations strung above them. Peonies and roses shaded in gradients of red, pink, and yellow are garlanded along the small flock of chairs sat in neat rows on two sides. The arch that once assisted Tony with his armor a lifetime ago sits a silent oculus framing the sky, lit in gleaming gold.
He feels a little guilty for dragging Steve into this, but it's going to work out in the end. He's going to make sure of it. He's going to get Peggy and Steve back together, no matter what.
He's seen the new influx of tweets from his classmates and the snaps from acquaintances talking about him and Steve. He's seen how they all wonder why someone like Steve would ever trade the gorgeous cheerleading captain Peggy Carter for snobby rich nerd extraordinaire Tony Stark. Peggy and Steve were a match made in teen romcom heaven, and Tony is well,
who looks absolutely devastated as he whispers, “Tony,” the sound deafeningly loud in the silent clearing.
“That’s not a no,” Tony points out. He leans in closer and lowers his voice to a gravel pitch. “How about a full set next time? A little bra with panties? Translucent lace. All black. Maybe heels? Maybe some lipstick that’ll get smeared all over your dick when I suck you off. You can fuck me on my hands and knees with the bra and panties on, so you can see your mark above my ass as you fuck me open—”
“I expect these distractions to cease once the weekend is over,” Howard says, his voice deadly low. There’s the clink of glass and pour of drink again. “Don’t think I don’t know what you’re up to, boy. This so-called relationship of yours? I know all about it, seen your shameless parade on social media. There’s only so much I’ll tolerate. Make sure these distractions don’t get in the way, or I’ll remove them for you.”
Steve is laughing uproariously, cheeks pinked from the cold as he leans down to kiss Tony in apology, and Tony can feel the curve of Steve’s smile pressed against his lips.
They all sprawl out on one of the bearskins by the fire and Clint leads them through a verbal horror story roleplay, a simpler version of the elaborate D&D games they play at home. It's almost midnight by the time Tony is finally killed in a broken ship floating in the nothingness of space, and the story ends.
Tony pushes the overwhelming nostalgia away and focuses instead on the task ahead of him. Operation: Convince Steve Rogers. Steve is already sitting at a booth in the back nursing a cup of coffee. There's a full pot with an empty cup and half a sandwich in front of him.
He starts going to the gym. At first, it’s to watch everyone else train. He watches as Natasha shreds paper target after paper target with precise shots. He watches Thor’s unrestrained rage, his only true match Steve when he’s gone that far with pain, howling like a wounded animal as he goes berserk on the reinforced mat. He watches Nebula jog the indoor track until her legs give out and Rhodey on the bars until his knees buckle. He watches Rocket clean his guns over and over again without shooting any of them and Bruce collapse in exhaustion when the other guy wears him out.
Steve pauses, his hand still outstretched and reaching for Tony. The look in his eyes are determined.
dangerous and it’s not like he’s going to have to take the subway for an hour and a half to get home because he refuses to let Happy drive him back—“
Rhodey is laughing as the first trickle of tears begin to track down his face. “No, Tony, you can’t buy MIT. I’ll see you soon.” He smiles through his tears as he begins to walk away.
“Sass,” Tony says. “All I get is sass here! Nat, my buddy, best friend, darling. You have faith in me, right?”
“Gonna show you off to everyone,” Steve says, pressing a lingering kiss to Tony’s shoulder. “Walk around town with you gorgeous young thing half my age hanging on my arm. Everyone in the neighborhood’s gonna be jealous.”
“Hello, sweetheart,” Steve murmurs, his voice a rough low timbre, soft and intimate, words meant only for his ears.
,” Tony breathes. He wriggles back against Steve’s thick cock, feeling heavy and full. He swears he can feel the shape of Steve inside him when he presses his hand against his belly. There are warm puffs of air against the nape of his neck as Steve breathes against him, pressing soft kisses to the top of his spine, and he arches back, encouraging Steve to move.
His husband shushes him gently. There’s the rustle of fabric as Steve quickly shucks his pants and in lieu of Tony having to climb off his lap again, Steve simply rips the panties off. Before Tony can form the words to complain, the slick head of Steve’s cock is pressing at his entrance, and he sighs with relief as Steve finally, finally slides home inside him.
Steve rejoins him in the parking lot after he showers and changes out of his gear and Tony can't resist running his fingers through Steve's still-damp hair as they settle into the backseat.
Tony crawls out of bed as Steve is struggling with his shirt, rising on his tiptoes to help Steve pull the hoodie down over his head. Tony laughs when he realizes it's his own sweatshirt with the big MIT logo splashed across the front but he does have to admit it looks much better on Steve, filled out with his broad shoulders and thick arms. He smooths down the collar and if his hands linger a little too long on Steve's chest, who's to say he isn't just brushing out the wrinkles? It makes his heart ache with something fierce to see Steve wearing his clothes. With one last stroke down Steve's side, he leans in for a kiss.
“Fine,” Tony says with a good natured roll of his eyes. “My big handsome husband. A wet dream of a man.”
She's definitely sassing him too, and to be fair, he's not really sure why the batter is green this time. They're supposed to be vanilla cupcakes and he doesn't even remember buying food coloring, nor would he have any reason to add it to his batter. He frowns down at the bowl in his hands.
Tony smiles, slow and warm. He raises their hands where they're connected and gently spreads his fingers, Steve mirroring the action until they're pressed fingertip to fingertip, palm to palm.
Tony finally manages to shove Steve off of him when Sarah Rogers extends her hand for a shake with an amused smile. He wills away his rising blush and manages somehow to not stammer when he takes her hand with a hoarse, “nice to meet you Mrs. Rogers. I'm Tony.”
How ridiculous it is now, to ever think Steve had been as small as Tony, as he stares incredulously at Steve's bulk towering over the reporter who looks like he's about to cry. Steve is huge now, with broad hulking shoulders that look like they can hold up the world, big hands gripped in the reporter’s shirt as he snarls in his face, star quarterback in all his intimidating glory.
“That's good,” Steve says simply as he withdraws his hand. “I feel much better now that we're out here. I've been trying to adjust all day with all of my newfound fame. I didn't realize any relationship of mine would garner so much attention.” He laughs lightly. Tony squints at him.
Tony can’t help but laugh at his expression, and what starts as nervous laughter triggered by his own stupid comment becomes full bodied uproarious laughter Steve joins in on. Their faces are aching by the time they calm down, and when they notice the parents and kids have left a wide berth around them, they laugh again. The conversation somehow gets easier after that.
Howard had been very unhappy to find Tony worshipping his mother long past what he had deemed “an appropriate age,” and immediately dissuaded her from allowing Tony to spend so much time with her the moment he turned seven. Howard was worried he would grow up to be a sissy if he keeps letting his mother paint his toenails.
“What the fuck,” Tony whispers, chest heaving as he flops back against the couch to stare at the ceiling.
? You can’t even lie to your old man on his big day? I’m disowning you and writing you out of my will. Peter is going to inherit your share.”
There's the sugar warm smell of baking cookies and the golden ginger heat of spiced cake wafting from the kitchen. Jarvis has been in a frenzy all afternoon, baking treats for Tony to bring over to Steve's for Christmas Eve.
Tony thinks nothing more of the matter and forcibly pushes it from his mind. Not his business, he reminds himself.
Tony stays carefully still as his daughter uncaps the tube of strawberry flavored lip gloss in her hand and meticulously dabs the applicator at his mouth, mindful to keep the color within the lines of his lips. The gloss is sticky and tacky on his mouth and Tony can feel it smearing on the side of his cheek a little, but he makes no move to wipe any of it away.
Steve’s eyes crinkle at the corners when he smiles, and he’s so handsome like this. A vision in black, the only hints of color are the ink tattooed on his hands. Steve raises one questioning brow. “
Jarvis sucks in a harsh breath as though Tony has said something that hurts him. “I beg to differ, Anthony. It is frankly insulting that you think so. Your friends love you a great deal. Your mother loved you. Ana loves you. And of course, I love you, my dear boy. I love you very much, we all do, and I want nothing but the very best for you.”
Tony turns unsteadily to see someone running out from the clearing of trees behind them. There are black spots crowding the edges of his vision but he fights for consciousness, in case he and Nebula might have to defend themselves. His legs are unsteady even as his tries to plant them firmly.
“Hi, you,” Tony replies, feeling the tenderness well up high in his throat as Steve rises on his elbows to get closer so he can press a kiss to Tony's collarbone. He instinctively wraps his arms around Steve's shoulders, as though that can be enough to keep him there and sinks back into the pillows when Steve relaxes against him, draped over Tony like a heavy warm blanket.
“But that never stopped you from doing what's right,” Tony says trying to keep his voice as gentle as possible. He sits up slightly and regrets the decision immediately when the furnace warmth of Steve's body dissipates but he doesn't have the excuse of dozing anymore to press close again.
Tony sighs, realizing despite kissing Steve, he hasn't said anything in answer. They need to work more on communication; not talking to each other was what put them in this mess in the first place. They need to do better. They need to communicate more because he realizes enough to know it's both sides messing this up. They were both dumb enough to make assumptions of each other without putting to voice the words of what they meant to each other. The whole mess is as much Steve's fault as it is his own, and he promises silently to himself that he's going to do better, they're both going to do better, because this is too important to fuck up again.
Tony gathers up every ounce of bravado he has and says nonchalantly, “I don't have to try to impress Steve. I'm naturally a very impressive person.”
“Wait,” Natasha says, holding up her hand to stop Tony’s ramble. She raises an incredulous brow. “You’re complaining he’s
“A what,” Tony says, not quite understanding. He's still confused when a pillow hits him in the chest and he blinks down at it, not comprehending.
Steve is silent for so long that Tony thinks he might've fallen asleep too. “And the baby blues,” Tony mumbles softly to himself. Steve still doesn't say anything. Tony is dozing off again when Steve finally answers.
Christmas Eve dinner is warm and full of laughter and Sarah insists on piling Tony’s plate with her delicious cooking until he's about to explode. Then, she stuffs him some more with mincemeat pie and chocolate mousse until he begs for mercy. Satisfied, Sarah bids them good night soon after dinner with a kiss on the cheek for each of them, and heads up to her room early.
be fine. It may still hurt now, the wound still sluggishly bleeding, but he's never been so good at anything than healing his own stupidly fragile heart. He'll simply lance out the poison and excise the necrotic tissue, leave it behind like Steve had so carelessly left him, and he will be
be his friends. He would never have expected half the football team to be laughing in his living room with Christmas carols playing from the speakers as they decorate for the holidays, warming his cold musty mansion.
Steve and Tony try to give as good as they get, but they don't stand a chance when the bowl is behind enemy lines. Steve makes the valiant effort of trying to shield Tony from the assault by turning his shoulder and trying to use his own body to protect Tony but between the team efforts of Clint, Bucky, Nat and Sam, the two of them get buried in popcorn.
“Maybe we can save round two for when we go back inside,” Steve says placatingly. He reaches over for a towel on the chair next to theirs to help Tony clean up the mess between his legs. “After a shower and some breakfast.”
“I don't want to go,” Tony says, not petulantly at all. “I didn't wear my team gear. Didn't take you one to be so eager for football either. Wouldn't you much rather go host a seance or something, Hocus Pocus?” He gives Loki’s wide brim hat and all-black attire a pointed look. Loki is wearing a dress and pointed boots to a football game and they call
Steve sighs. “Sandra is my friend,” he says. “The soda is just because she’s doing me a favor. It’s my way of thanking her. I don’t take advantage of this special privilege because I would never want her to get into trouble because of me. It’s not about what you can do for people, or how much you can pay them to do something for you, Tony,” he says, and Tony doesn’t have a reply for that because that’s all he really knows. In his world, everyone has a price.
,” Tony croaks. He holds up his hands to stop Steve from saying anything else when he opens his mouth again. “And there never will be,” he says firmly. “Pepper is one of my best friends and I'm not going to get between her and Rhodey.”
Tony looks back up at Steve while he turns over the thoughts in his head, turning over the heartache to tentative joy, pushing aside the remnants of betrayal to uncover the bone deep relief, and finally embraces the entirety of how much he loves Steve. He watches as Steve squirms while he stays silent for a little longer, and Tony would be lying if he says he doesn't enjoy it just the tiniest bit that Steve is so clearly anticipating his reply.
Steve looks at him for a long moment and Tony steadily holds his gaze despite his rabbiting heart until Steve turns away first.
With his precious cargo in his arms and Tony pressing a smile against his neck, Steve makes the walk to their bed. He gently deposits Tony in the middle of it, and steps back to make quick work of removing his own pajama pants and sleep shirt. Steve watches with hooded eyes while Tony shimmies out of his shorts and slowly spreads his legs with a suddenly shy smile as Steve moves to crawl on top of him.
Steve rising out of the water is a sight to behold. He breaks from the surface with a cascade of droplets raining from his body, a monsoon dripping from his illustrated skin. Tony tracks the rivulets of water sliding down Steve’s chest avidly, eyes following the drops as they trail along his husband’s perfect golden inked torso and feeling fiery hunger flare redhot in his belly. He feels greedy and jealous watching the water touch his husband so intimately when he himself is still too far to reach.
He doesn't know if Steve realizes what he said, but the words lance through Tony like a strike of lightning. He recovers enough to laugh lightly, but the ache in his chest intensifies into burning pain. He presses down on it with his palm as he leans in towards Steve.
. “My clone wrote it? I was framed? I was hacked?” The eyebrow climbs ever higher into Steve's hairline with each ridiculous thing Tony says as Steve patiently waits for him to get it all out of his system.
Tony's world all but shatters and the bile rises in his throat alongside the animal anguished cry that bubbles loud and piercing. He barely realizes the sounds are escaping his mouth until the static roar in his ears dissipate slightly and he can hear Natasha again and he feels her thin arms around his shoulders as she holds him.
“Oh,” Tony says, catching on. “Our fake dates. You don’t—we don’t really have to do those if you don’t want to, you know.”
Tony is seventeen the fourth time his heart breaks. He is getting so used to it by that point, it shouldn't even hurt anymore. But it is agony. At first, it feels like numbness until the burn flames through his chest, and it hurts so much he wonders how he will survive.
Nat walks over to sit next to him on his bed, her small hand a comforting weight on his chest. “You’re not an idiot,” she says gently.
Jarvis already has a plate stacked high with the cookies he baked that morning waiting for him. He's smiling softly at Tony from where he sits at the counter, sipping his tea.
“There will be no wild cocaine parties in this house,” Jarvis says as he walks in with armfuls of boxes for the things Tony is going to donate. “The powder will be a pain to clean and I’m getting old.”
Steve can feel the slow breaths Tony is taking beneath his palms as they expand his diaphragm in rhythmic pulls. There's a little hitch in his throat when Steve skates his fingers from the side of his chest to graze the edge of his nail against Tony's nipple. He watches their reflection intently as Tony shivers, lips parting slightly as their eyes meet in the glass.
If I had had words to speak such a thing, I would have. But there were none that seemed big enough for it, to hold that swelling truth."
“Never had anyone to build a fort with,” Tony replies, not wanting to tell Steve that he never had the luxury of simple childhood pleasures like this. Most of his childhood was spent shadowing Howard so he could learn the workings of SI and after that, he was building projects and manufacturing weapons for his father's company.
Steve doesn't say anything for a long time. He simply stares into his cup of coffee as Tony talks and just as Tony is starting to get irritated, he says, “I don't want your money and that plan makes no sense.”
Jarvis makes a contemplative noise. “And you do not believe that Steve had genuine affection for you, Anthony?”
Tony is about to say more and bury Pepper in an avalanche of praise when his phone shrills with Howard’s ringtone and Tony feels as though a bucket of ice has been poured over him. He’s sitting frozen as he stares blankly down at the phone in his hand, and it’s so fucking stupid that he’s such a coward when it comes to his own father, but dread washes over him at the thought of speaking to Howard. His father doesn’t usually call unless there’s something urgent, or he’s very angry, and Tony does not want to pick up.
The second reprimand from Howard comes from abroad. He somehow still manages to find the time to scold Tony even when he's fucked off halfway across the world “in an important conference.”
“Alright, Rogers,” Tony says as he slides into the bench seat across from Steve. He whips the sunglasses he's wearing off his face and places them on the tabletop. His fingers tap a nervous staccato rhythm on the formica and he has to forcefully will himself to stop. Steve waits patiently for him to talk.
“Are you sure this will work?” Nebula asks, looking concerned and dubious. Her eyes flicker to the fuel readout on the dash, dangerously low flashing reds.
“And what makes you think I'm any different?” Tony asks, thinking of how he's going to intern at Stark Industries in a couple of years with a sick twist in his stomach.
Tony pauses with one foot in the door to look back at her silhouetted against the snow and dim moonlight. Her dark hair is a stark contrast to the white of the landscape, black shawl wrapped tight around her shoulders and fluttering in the light wind. The plume of smoke from her lips makes her look ethereal, a wraith in the winter night. She really is very beautiful, he thinks, especially when she smiles so softly.
“It seems like I have no choice, do I?” Tony snarls, crossing his arms. “You're standing in front of the only exit.” He makes a mental note to add more fucking doors to his fucking lab, he needs to be able to escape in emergencies.
Tony is so proud of Rhodey. He graduated as valedictorian of his year and now he’s off to MIT on full scholarship, and he’s going to join the Air Force afterwards. Rhodey already has a plan for his life, and he’s well on his way to achieving all of it. Tony honestly can not be more proud of his best friend, go best friend, but he also cannot help the worry that grows heavier by the day, knowing that Rhodey will be hours away and he is going to
It’s peculiar and a little concerning and Steve wants to get to the bottom of it. If Tony doesn’t like the mirror, the solution is simple: they’ll just get rid of it and replace it with some other giant piece of decor. No big deal. But why does Tony hate this mirror?
“You know, I think I might take up painting again when I retire,” Jarvis says apropos of nothing. Tony frowns slightly at the abrupt change in subject as Jarvis continues, “I often painted when I was younger. I drew a lot too. You might guess who my favorite subject was.”
“Someone's been playing too many war games,” Steve says lightly but he does turn around to greet Happy in the booth behind him, and Happy the traitor actually smiles cheerfully and says hi back.
“Hmmm?” Steve shakes his head slightly as though dazed and his eyes are heated and gaze locked to Tony’s mouth.
Tony sits up, letting the sheets pool at his waist as he looks around the room, spotting Steve’s neatly folded pajamas at the foot of their bed and briefly wonders if Steve went out into town. He’s thinking maybe he should text his husband to ask where he is when he sees a tray with a closed silver cloche and a thermos of coffee on their little table in the sitting area. Steve must’ve ordered room service before he left.
It takes six weeks for Howard to realize Tony is distracted. The new concepts he comes up with are lacking, the prototypes are not innovative enough, the output not powerful enough.
Tony slips out of bed, not bothering to pull on a robe. He helps himself to a cup of coffee just to feel a little bit more awake, breathing in the sharp dark aroma. His gaze sweeps around the suite as though Steve might pop up from behind the couch at any given moment when Tony hears the splash of water just outside on the balcony. He bites back the smile that threatens to form. He should’ve known.
The crowd roars with thunderous blue and red applause as Steve Rogers leads them onto the field. His ridiculous shoulders look even broader underneath the uniform padding, sharply contrasting his trim waist and long legs, and despite his best attempts, Tony can't get himself to stop looking. Steve jogs onto the grass with a jovial wave to the crowd and runs a lap for his adoring fans before immediately heading for the sidelines as the rest of the team follows.
“None of that,” Pepper says, snapping Tony out of another spiral. Her hand feels warm against his cheek, anchoring and strong. “I can see where your brain is going, Tony. Just email Rhodey tomorrow. Everything is fine. He's just worried about you and he’ll call you back once he gets the chance.”
Tony laughs hollowly. “I don't have time to play video games. I’m way too busy building actual weapons of mass destruction for Howard in my spare time.”
He spends the entire class on his laptop fine tuning the behavioral code for his bot, distracted every few minutes by his own traitorous eyes surreptitiously glancing over at Steve's note folded at the corner of his desk. He barely gets more than a couple of lines done before the bell rings.
day?” he tries sheepishly, digging into the bag to find a chicken parm, still warm and wrapped in foil.
He nearly drops the slip of paper that Steve presses into his hand between second and third period in the hall and almost collides into a freshman when he turns whipquick to see Steve hiding a smile behind his hand as they pass. He holds up the paper and looks across the hall at Steve with a raised brow in question, but Steve only winks and adjusts the strap of his bag on his shoulder as he walks away, Tony staring after him this time.
The tiny restaurant is owned by an elderly woman who doesn’t speak any English but she knows just enough French for Steve to order their food. He wins her over with his clumsy American accent and his earnest “
The guilt weighs heavier in Tony's stomach and he feels as though he might retch. He's made such a mess of everything, hurting everyone around him with all of his stupid decisions, and nothing he ever does is right, it's all wrong, he's wrong—
“Yeah, sweetheart,” Steve says and Tony thinks he might be going into cardiac arrest, his heart is beating so fast. Steve pulls him in for another kiss and all higher thinking flies out the window. All he knows is the feeling of Steve's lips against his and the echo of
Steve's normally clear blue eyes are darkly intense as he trails long fingers up and down the sensitive skin of Tony’s ribs and skims over his sternum, tracing circles over his burning skin. Steve buries his face against Tony's clavicle as large hands span his chest. The pads of his fingers brush against the peaks of his nipples, and Tony groans, arching up into the touch.
- The fic was originally titled “Some And Now None Of You” from the song, “The Night We Met,” by Lord Huron but ultimately that didn’t quite fit, but it’s a lovely song for stevetony.
“Went to my first comic con because of Steve,” Sam says, ignoring Steve. “I think that was what? Two summers ago?”
Until he remembers one of the letters were addressed to Pepper, and he remembers Rhodey and Pepper’s lingering touches and
The reprimand Tony is expecting doesn't come. Instead, one of Steve's hands covers his own on his chest and his fingertips are light where they tenderly touch Tony's cheek, thumb sweeping over the dark smudges under his eyes. His lips follow his fingers, a gentle kiss pressed to Tony's cheek followed by the softest of sighs.
“State champions!” Bucky crows loudly, his arms linked around Thor’s to carry Clint on their shoulders.
“Untrue,” Tony mutters. “She does not make me uncomfortable.” There’s the familiar swell of guilt rising in him. How can Peggy be so lovely and selfless when Tony’s been nothing but shitty and selfish towards her?
“Nat,” Tony says, proud of how calm his voice sounds. “I-I think. I—” He swallows thickly and wipes at his face, his palm coming away wet again. He gently untangles her arms from his shoulders. “I can't do this.”
sorry I’ve done anything to make you think otherwise, and if you really don't feel the same way about me, I can understand that too. Or if you don’t yet, but you’re willing to give me a chance, I would spend the rest of our days proving how much I love you. I just needed to—I needed to tell you this. I didn't want you to keep thinking I was pretending this whole time.”
The trip down the aisle feels like an eternity before Tony and Rhodey finally make it to where Steve is waiting. With another touch to Tony's elbow, Rhodey hands him off to Steve and moves to his position in front of them.
Steve hums in agreement as he leans down to mouth along the column of Tony’s neck. Tony's breath hitches in his throat as Steve nibbles on the sensitive skin, pressing wet kisses along his collarbone as he continues his way down. He pays special attention to Tony's scars, gentling his touch as he kisses each and every one. The feeling of how tenderly Steve handles him brings tears to the sweep of Tony's lashes, and he wonders for the millionth time how someone like Steve even exists and wonders what he’s done to deserve him.
He glances quickly at the notification and with suffocating dread, Tony opens his email to find another one of Howard's curt notes. “
Steve rolls his eyes but there's a smile tugging at the corners of his lips as he rifles through his locker. “Actually, I'm pretty good at math and science. Lit is the tough one.”
“It felt real at the end,” Tony says, “I really thought it was, but I was an idiot, and I only saw what I wanted to see. I wanted so badly for Steve to care about me, I managed to delude myself into believing it for a little while.” He laughs bitterly. “They've been calling me smart my whole life. Prodigy, genius, futurist. But they're all wrong. I'm not sure what's worse: getting into the situation in the first place, or actually thinking Steve liked me. I was an idiot to ever get myself into this mess, J.”
“Hold onto that for me,” Steve had told him, pulling on the collar of the letterman so it laid flat, long fingers carefully brushing over where his scripted name was embroidered on Tony's chest. His blue eyes were dark in the low light and his voice was rumbling bass deep as he pressed his words with a soft kiss to Tony's cheek, his lips grazing the corner of Tony's mouth.
“The poor kid was in there for probably hours before we came in to change for practice,” Steve is saying. “He never told us who did it but we all had a good idea it was probably Viktor and his merry band of assholes.”
Tony remembers the framed sketches and paintings hung in Jarvis’s house. He remembers asking about them when he was little and Ana's proud answers. He thinks also of the eyes and hands Steve doodles in the notes he gives Tony, and wonders who they belong to.
The streets are quieter than Manhattan. Instead of harried businessmen and oblivious tourists, Brooklyn streets are mostly filled with families walking dogs and strollers. The pavement is covered with carpets of bright leaves that crunch underfoot. The evening light shines down on them through the gaps in the trees that line the streets as the sun sets to the west, the gold and purple unobscured by tall glass spires and concrete towers.
Tony sighs and puts his phone down. He’s about to dive back into his lines of code when the lab doors open and Pepper walks in.
Tony shrugs, feeling his pout curve upwards into a grin. “We’ll see,” he jokes. “He's brand new. I’m still giving him a trial run.”
“We’ve suffered enough,” Steve says. “We deserve this. We deserve to be happy, even if it’s for a second in between everything else.”
Tony inhales sharply and doesn’t have the heart to tell her it won’t be the same without her son there. “I know, Mama, thank you,” he says instead.
“In the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. Their hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun.”
style,” he tells Steve imperiously. “It’s called artfully tousled. One of the children told me,” he says but quiets under Steve’s gentle hands as he gently finger combs Tony’s unruly locks into some semblance of order.
“This is ridiculous, isn’t it?” Tony asks when they settle down for lunch at a small cafe near the museum. He picks idly at his cheeseburger and watches with rapt fascination as Steve eats his fries one by one, licking his lips to catch the salt after each bite until they’re cherry red.
It feels strange to see Steve outside of school somehow when they meet outside of the museum on Saturday. They’ve never hung out before, not even when they were friendly and Tony feels completely out of his depth on their fake date. He’s never been on a date before, and he’s not sure what to expect, fake or not.
Then Tony presses another kiss to the corner of Steve’s mouth before stretching across the bed to reach to their bedside drawer. Steve almost stays his hand so they can continue their unhurried easy touches, but the sight of Tony slicking his own fingers and reaching between his legs to stretch himself open proves to be too much, even for Steve’s normally ironclad control. In the span of seconds, his desperation is matching Tony’s as his fingers slide in alongside his into the tight heat.
“Yes,” Tony says behind clenched teeth. “I heard you.” As though his words don’t echo in Tony’s head every day and haunt him every night when he’s feeling his lowest and can’t will sleep to come fast enough.
Tony's brain screeches to a grinding halt. “Wait wait wait wait wait,” he cries, finally managing to stop Steve's tirade as he holds his hands up. “Stop.
Tony can barely breathe for the emotion clogging his chest and throat as Steve takes him apart. He doesn't think he's ever loved anyone so much, or ever will love anyone this much again. And that's the kicker, isn't it, to fall in love with someone he can't have like Steve Rogers not only once, but
“The plan is perfect, see,” Tony interrupts excitedly, ignoring the vise squeezing his heart. “You help me fix this awkward state with my friends by fake dating me so they can see the letter to Pepper is meaningless and I help you get back together with the love of your life! It's so simple. It's ingenious. We get together, it makes Peggy a little bit jealous, and she realizes she can't live without you, and she’ll beg for you to go back to her.”
Everything feels different that night, and Tony isn't sure if it's the high of victory or something else that allows him to believe the thundering of Steve's heartbeat beneath his palm might be meant for him. The haze of the darkened room and loud music that echoes in his bones allows Tony to be brave and stupid and he pretends just for a little while that this is real.
“Finish getting dressed,” Steve tosses over his shoulder as he turns to face the mirror. Tony watches him from the other side of the closet as Steve dresses, making no moves to finish getting ready.
He wipes furiously at his eyes before his father can see his tears and from somewhere above him, he is aware of yelling but he can only hear snatches of it between the rising buzz in his ears.
Tony finally, and very reluctantly turns. Steve is there standing behind him with a determined set to his jaw, holding that damned letter. Tony wants to reach out and grab it from his hand and burn it but it's far too late for that.
Eventually, they resort to simply holding each other close as they sway to the beat, Steve trying his best not to move his feet at all. Steve's hands are cupped loosely around the dip of Tony's waist, easily spanning the full width as his thumbs stroke along the line of his hips, slow and careful beneath the borrowed varsity jacket Tony is still wearing.
him, one of his best friends and closest confidants. Someone he trusts with his secrets and some of the darkest parts of himself. Someone who’s seen everything that happened with Steve.
Steve laughs softly and steadies him with his thumb stroking along Tony's jaw, easing the kiss into something slower, sweeter. Tony feels a rush of blood that heats liquidhot through him as he arches closer to Steve, who moans lowly when he shifts in his lap. Steve's fingers are burning pressure points on the crest of Tony's hip and they grip tighter as he shifts again, earning another sound from low in his throat that Tony would do anything to hear again and again.
“We can’t miss another event,” Steve murmurs, even as his hands are sliding up underneath Tony’s suit to grip at his waist. He leans in closer until his nose is pressed to Tony’s cheek, his beard tickling Tony’s chin. “Aren’t you supposed to be giving a keynote speech tonight?”
Tony tries not to wake Steve as he sits up, but Steve's eyes flutter open anyways, blinking at him blearily before his gaze turns soft and warm.
Usually his memory is pretty damn good, but at the moment he has no recollection of what he might've done to make Loki look so uncomfortable and he's the guy who usually takes all of Tony's weird quirks and grossness in stride and matches it with his own.
“I'm smart and logical and great at everything, with an asshole dad like Spock,” Tony says quietly, ignoring the way Steve snorts softly. “And you. You're like Kirk. You're reckless and fearless and people are naturally drawn to you because you were a born leader.”
Tony finds himself crowded up against the door as soon as it's shut behind them, and he returns the kiss with equal desperation, fingers reaching up to tangle in Steve's hair. Steve's strong hands are reaching under Tony's thighs to hoist him up and he instinctively wraps his legs around Steve's waist as he walks them both across the room.
“It's okay,” Steve says, smiling gently. “We're doing better now but we were poor when I was very little. Sometimes, the shitty places we lived in didn't have any heat in the winter. Building a fort helped keep me warm, because the space between the blankets was small enough to be warmed by a little electric heater. I was sick a lot when I was a kid. So I would spend a lot of time between blankets like that, trying my best to keep warm. We couldn't afford for me to get sick again and run up another medical bill.”
“You keep saying that,” Steve grumbles, but he catches Tony’s hand in one of his own to press a kiss to his palm. His other arm wraps around Tony’s waist and holds him tight against Steve’s chest. “We made a mess of ourselves, didn't we?”
That was when the first fist flew. Before Tony had even realized what was happening, someone was stepping in front of him to block the punch. It was Steve, then scrawny sickly thin Steve Rogers from second period English, had saved Tony from a sure beating, taken it himself and later that day, Tony taped up his bleeding cuts in the fourth floor boys bathroom. They never spoke of the event again, not even during the endless hours of detention they served together.
Now Tony has a lot of things in his life that he regrets doing, starting with ever thinking he could live up to Howard's expectations to writing the very letters that led up to him giving Steve Rogers his first kiss, just so he can avoid talking to his best friend. If mess isn't his middle name by now, he doesn't know what is.
Tony thinks maybe he should feel some kind of spark at that, satisfaction maybe. Vindication perhaps. But all he feels is empty. He squeezes his eyes shut.
They make popcorn and fight over what to watch. Eventually Steve wins and they work their way through two episodes of the original series before Steve finally concedes to watch the reboot, and only because Tony makes his best puppy eyes at Steve. The sun has long set outside the windows, casting the living room in long dark shadows, the only illumination glowing from the TV screen.
dating for months, and neither of us were smart enough to just say it outright? Fucking stupid. So stupid.”
, c’mon Steve, I love seeing you like this. Covered with my name and wearing my armor. I want the whole world to see you like this, how you belong to me—ah, right there—just as I belong to you.
They do this little dance for a whole month, wherein Tony does his best to avoid any instances where he might see Steve at school, ducking into empty corridors and classrooms just to avoid him in the halls. He refuses to talk to anyone on the team, and spends every spare second in the labs. He tries his best not to throw up whenever he sees any flash of red. Jarvis tells him there’s a new note in the mailbox every day, and Tony refuses to look at any of them.
Steve slings his arms around Tony’s shoulders to hide the profanity on his shirt as they walk from the space exhibit to other parts of the museum, Steve cheerfully pointing out his favorite sections like the hall of North American mammals which had cases full of taxidermied animals behind glass with beautifully painted tableaux and plastic flora. Tony can’t help but get caught up in his enthusiasm and he relaxes slowly as the day progresses, despite the prickly feeling at the back of his neck that comes with being in large crowds.
Steve shrugs his big shoulders and settles back against his seat. “I’m kind of hoping this attention will pass soon.”
“This is way too fucking deep for Star Trek,” Tony groans, deflecting and desperately trying to bring the light mood back.
He tucks his head down and chips away at his MIT application bit by bit and eyes the Boston apartment rental website contemplatively. He has more important things to think of than football. Tony, personally, has a few hangups about the football team anyways. Namely, one captain in particular.
It's all his own damn fault for being so stupid and it's frankly pathetic that so much of his life has revolved around Steve. He's been in love with Steve twice, and an old adage comes to mind.
The flurries pick up speed outside, and the snow piles up higher and higher through the day. They spend the first afternoon lounging in the common room with their friends, hot cocoa in hand and board games spread out on the rug by the fire.
After that, he finds some semblance of peace in taking apart every failed project Howard gave him grief on. He smashes three prototypes and rips four printed schematics. He spends two hours tearing apart the bot he's halfway finished building and later realizing what he's done, he breaks down amidst the parts and sobs.
Tony relaxes marginally as they become old news. It doesn’t stop Steve from being outwardly affectionate in public, taking the charade personally as though he has something to prove. Besides being ridiculously considerate, Steve is also ridiculously romantic. He walks Tony to all of his classes, presses kisses to his cheek in the halls when they part, and always sits with him for lunch. On the days with nicer weather when they’re not eating with friends, Steve will sneak them both out of school as Sandra gives them knowing looks and he’ll take Tony back to Ben’s deli for sandwiches. They’ll sit on the steps of the Met, people watching as they eat their lunch.
That will never not take Tony's breath away, to see his claim on Steve’s skin in red and black and gold and unfading permanence. Steve is beautiful like this, pale skin colored with Tony’s mark, and Tony is reminded again of the surprise and flare of dark obsession he’d felt when he first saw Steve’s tattoos for him. His fingers find their way along the ladder of Steve’s ribs and further up to ghost the edge of his nail against a pierced nipple and Tony shivers together with Steve as they close the space between them.
Tony grins and begins to quietly pad across the room. Steve startles a little when Tony drops down onto the cushion next to him but relaxes immediately.
“My point is, she understands, Tony,” Steve says. “She's happy for us. She sees that you make me smile and walk around like a fucking moron with my head in the clouds all the time, because all I can think about is you. She sees that you make me happy because I fucking lo—I
Besides, how does he dare to say something like that to her when he feels like an absolute hypocrite? He’s the one trying to give Steve everything, if only to have him for another day, for another handful of hours, for as long as Steve will keep him. He’s the one bending over, literally and figuratively to keep Steve away from Peggy. He can feel the shame of it all clogging his throat, and he has no right to even be in Peggy’s presence like this, not when he still aches with how Steve felt inside him this morning and aches to have him again.
A deep rumble sounds from Steve’s chest as he closes in, pushing up on the lip of the pool to climb out. He moves quickly to the chair and leans over Tony, settling between his legs. He smells of sharp chlorine and salt, and Tony moves in to get a taste of the water dripping down the line of Steve’s neck. He can feel Steve’s large hand like a searing brand where it closes around the curve of his ass to pull his leg over Steve’s hip, fingertips pressing into the sensitive skin and dragging a moan from Tony’s lips as he arches up against his husband’s chest, needing to be close.
Later, when Tony is asleep tucked up against his arm, Steve watches the rise and fall of Tony’s soft breaths and trails gentle fingers through his husband’s dark curls. Tony is still in his sleep like he never is awake, the furrows in his brows smoothed and the tension in his mouth gone.
One night after his shower, Steve sees Tony frowning into the mirror as he’s getting ready for bed. Tony is standing in front of the glass dressed only in his sleep shorts. Steve watches him from across the room as Tony squints his eyes at his own reflection and drags frustrated fingers through his hair, mussing it into disarrayed tufts. He sees Tony heave a heavy sigh as he attempts to smooth down the greying sides again before pinching at the skin of his own belly, his mouth set in a deep frown.
. He drops his hand from Steve’s face but doesn’t let go when Steve catches it and closes his palm over his fingers, squeezing gently.
“There's always next year,” Steve murmurs, looking like he's already drifting off again. “Merry Christmas, Tony.”
A month later, Tony finds Steve in the fourth floor boys bathroom gripping one of the sinks with white knuckled hands as he gasps for breath. His face is tear streaked, nose swollen and dripping. Their eyes meet briefly in the mirror and Tony
Tony straightens each scrap of paper and smoothes them out meticulously. He saves them all and brings them home to place in a little box he keeps under his bed, still lamenting the loss of his mother’s old hatbox. He builds his collection of Steve notes like magpie treasure, and tries not to think of the day he won't have any more to add to the hoard.
“Thank you, sourpatch,” Tony says softly, the emotions swelling again when Rhodey’s eyes soften. “I can’t think of anyone else I’d rather have up there with me today.”
“Not delicate!” Tony protests from where he's seated on the rug by Steve's feet, sorting through a pile of tangled garland. “Don't let the size fool you. I'm vicious and strong.”
Steve steps back a little and Rhodey comes into view, panting as he runs forward, the joints of his leg braces whirring quietly. He’s followed by several others Tony cannot make out in the dim light, but if Rhodey and Steve are here, that means he’s safe. They’re both safe.
“No,” Steve says, his voice sounding gravelly rough. “I want you to see,” he repeats, gentling his tone. “Please. Do you trust me?”
“Hey, it's not so bad,” Rhodey says as he pulls away. He squares his shoulders and takes a deep shuddering breath. “It's only Boston, Tones. There's always FaceTime and Skype. In fact, I’ll call you as soon as I get there. Will that make you feel better?”
He cheers every time Steve makes a particularly good throw and when Bucky or Clint makes a touchdown, shouting encouragement whenever Thor makes a particularly brutal tackle and when Sam makes an especially dexterous pass.
The first color Tony sees when he wakes up is white. The light is white. The ceiling is white. The walls are white. The sheets tucked around him are white. The noise that buzzes around him is white, staticky and rhythmic.
“How’re you enjoying the wildlife?” Bucky asks, grinning wide as his eyes track the bruises and marks decorating Tony’s throat and chest. The lowest ones taper down beneath the band of his swim trunks, and Tony smirks as he turns, a sarcastic pirouette to show off the marks above the dip of his waist.
“Hey, is now a bad time to ask if you want to go to prom with me?” Steve deadpans and Tony can’t help it, but laughter bubbles out of him and soon they’re both laughing, unable to stop.
Tony worries at his bottom lip, eyes still avoiding his reflection and he is silent for a long minute before nodding determinedly. With a steadying breath, Tony turns to look back to the mirror, eyes half lidded as his gaze settles on Steve’s hands. He watches Steve trace his fingers along the contour of his torso, slowly dragging his hands from Tony’s waist to the ladder of his ribs, feeling the warm skin beneath his palms.
Tony doesn’t give himself time to adjust as he thrusts all the way down to take all of Steve’s cock, moving immediately. He bounces up and down on Steve’s dick without any real semblance of rhythm, his gasps and whimpers swallowed by Steve’s kisses. Tony is fueled by the blaze of desperation that burns deep in his chest when he’s this close to Steve, and he still wants
Did Tony do something especially offensive last week? He hasn't a clue and his brain, something that's usually pretty reliable is failing him now and he has no idea what's going on and Loki looks like he's ramping up to say something big—
Happy frowns but moves away to walk over to the driver’s side of the car. “I’m right here, Tony, if you need me.”
Tony doesn't tell Jarvis he barely has time to take a breath with three prototypes he needs to build, much less eat. He sustains himself on handfuls of leftover mincemeat pie Sarah had packed home for him and cup after cup of cold stale coffee to keep himself awake.
There’s a sharp inhalation from Steve as Tony resettles on top of him and his hands immediately fly to the crest of Tonys hips. His thumbs make slow circles against the slip of silky fabric he finds there. When he looks up to meet Tony's grin, Tony can see the flame in Steve’s eyes burning out the blue irises.
asked him to do this. I knew what the end result would be, but I didn't know—” he rubs absently at his chest. “I didn't know how
Steve, bless him, doesn’t notice the turmoil Tony feels swirling tempestuous chaos in his mind. He smiles when he sees Tony, and Tony can’t help but smile back.
“Jealous when I call out another man’s name in bed with you?” Tony laughs and obediently raises his arms as Steve slides off his shirt.
Tony can almost fool himself into believing everything is perfect when he's gathered with his friends on the night before Christmas Eve decorating the house. It's admittedly a little late to start decorations with two days til the Big Day, but Tony has only just finished his finals the week before and spent the first couple of his days off of school editing yet another damn project for Howard, who decided he'll be spending the holidays in the Maldives.
“No,” she says. “He doesn’t know anything anything about this aside from the letter he got. He had nothing to do with sending them.”
There’s an enormous mirror in the sitting room area of their suite, and Steve had always thought it looked ridiculous and ostentatious. It’s taller than him and twice as wide, framed in gilded wood and intricate baroque carvings. It’s something the decorators brought in to fill the space.
He thinks about what could’ve been done in four years, when he was drifting through space fighting to get home. He thinks about what steps they could’ve taken to defeat Thanos, what they could’ve done to avenge their friends. It spirals him in circles and while he realizes the futility of the thought because lost time can never be regained, he aches with the hollowness of failure.
Rhodey has been with him since he was a scrawny kid stepping foot for the first time in Boston, scared out of his wits and trying his damnedest to hide it. Rhodey had seen right through his cracking bravado and adopted him as little brother and best friend, and they have been inseparable since.
, “Just breathe. Gosh, Tony I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you so badly. I thought you heard me calling your name. Jesus, I’m so sorry. Breathe. Just breathe.”
“Forever,” Tony echoes, surprised at the rush of relief that floods him. He knows Steve loves him, but standing here now, words to describe the emotions he’s feeling escape him, but all of them are warm and
Pearl buttons glimmer in a straight line along his sternum, shimmering against the intricate white lace of his shirt. His jacket is long, nearly to his knees and colored a pale dove grey. His pants are tailored to skim the top of his shoes, oxfords buffed to a high shining gleam. His hair is pushed back out of his face, spots of concealer dotted on his cheeks to hide the redness on the worst of his scars. It’s as good as it’s going to get.
“What is this about?” Steve asks, holding up the envelope and sure, burning it might not make Steve unread it, but it would feel so fucking good to have it gone.
Thankfully, Howard is away on a business trip and Tony only has his mother to contend with, and true to form, Happy, the traitor hands the note directly to her. Maria scans the little post-it quickly and looks at Tony with soft sad eyes.
“Ma, please stop embarrassing the both of us,” Steve groans, dramatically thunking his head against the back of the couch.
Tony knows now why Steve had always seemed just the slightest bit uncomfortable with shows of wealth and offers of money. Steve had never looked like he belonged in Tony's world of modern lines and soulless glass in the city with personal drivers and butlers and high rises bearing his father's name that touch the sky. Tony can't help but wonder how Steve ended up in their expensive magnet school uptown, and thinks maybe that's a question for another day.
It takes Tony a minute to stop shaking when Howard finally hangs up and his phone dangles limply in the lax grip of his hand as he stares unseeing up at the sickle moon. He’s surprised Howard hasn’t bothered to say anything about Steve for so long, but his words are clear as day.
Eventually, he finds a sliding door to the huge wrap around deck, and the first breath of crisp fresh winter air is a balm to his overly tight heated skin. He breathes deep and slows his sigh so Howard doesn’t hear him on the other end. The deck is thankfully empty, most others unwanting to be out in the cold night as snow drifts steadily down.
The school year starts like any other, the air turning crisp as summer backflips swiftly into fall, the northern fronts bringing wind and lower temperatures overnight. There's the sharp green scent of grass in the air with a red bite of incoming autumn as September dawns, the wind flavored with anticipation and excitement. There is already a thin carpet of orange leaves underfoot, smelling like brown bark and charcoal tinder. They crunch loudly in crackles that echo against the flat asphalt of the concrete jungle.
Their school group gets one of the smaller side buildings to themselves, but it's no less luxurious with high beamed ceilings and a huge common room. There's a sprawling fireplace that dominates an entire wall crowned with a rack of antlers. The floors are piled with fur pelt rugs, armchairs and couches scattered in front of the fire to create a warm semi circle as snow drifts steadily down outside the huge picture windows. All of the guest rooms are comfortable and spacious, dressed with soft grey wools and sheepskin rugs. Tony has to admit he’s impressed as he sets his bags down in the room Steve claimed for the both of them.
- It went through so many rounds of editing, everything from the title to the plot points to the ending that it only vaguely resembles what I originally had.
He should’ve done more. He should’ve protected them. He should’ve saved them. He should’ve saved Peter.
“I’m fine,” he repeats, plastering a press smile on his lips as he shoves his phone into his back pocket. “Peachy, honky dory, and just swell.”
This was what they were working towards, wasn’t it? This is the end goal, and Steve is finally getting what he really wants. This is Steve’s choice, and it would have been the same even if Tony presented him with the option of a real relationship. Tony has always known this was coming, and he was still
Tony swivels quickly and nearly elbows whoever is behind him before he realizes it’s Steve. It’s just Steve.
“In a bit,” Tony promises as he slides off of Steve’s lap to kneel at his feet. He looks up at Steve from beneath his lashes as he settles on his knees, knowing what that look does to his husband. Steve stares down at him with his lips slightly agape. There’s a wondrous look in his eyes as he slides gentle fingers back through Tony’s curls, a guiding undemanding touch. Tony starts to remove his glasses when the grip in his hair tightens slightly.
The whistle blows and the game starts. It's a brutal game that starts with a jarring clash. It starts off well enough and neither team gives an inch throughout the first half but by halftime their team is crushing the opponent, Steve leading them through each coordinated play.
Every day, like clockwork, Steve brings him breakfast and coffee in the labs. After second period, he would be waiting in the halls outside of Tony’s classroom door to drop a note into his hands and again right before the start of seventh. Sometimes they're about Tony, sometimes they're little anecdotes and punny jokes. Lately, they've been slowly transitioning to more doodles, usually observational sketches Steve makes of eyes and hands. Sometimes, they're comic characters, and Tony soon realizes the big muscly one is supposed to be Steve and the high tech robot armor is Tony. He likes those notes the best.
“People like us,” Janet says on the first night, “will never fit in with people like them.” She waves a hand at the rest of the circle. “It's not about money. We're all at camp rich kids. It's about how we think. We
“I want to,” Steve replies, and Tony almost smiles, thinking of old conversations when Steve said that exact same thing. And he knows by now that it's a foregone conclusion that if Steve Rogers wants to do something, there's no stopping him. Steve busses a kiss to Tony's temple and steps away to settle down on the couch.
Tony still carries the flip phone with him, hidden in his pocket and within easy reach. The small weight of it comforts him, especially when he feels unmoored, as though the vacuum of space dogs his steps, waiting for the right moment to sweep him back up into the black nothingness.
Tony pulls her hand up to press a kiss to her knuckles. “Thanks, Nat. Have you seen the tweets about us? Some of them are even kind of funny, like Steve dumping me because of some dark family secret, but imagine if they knew the truth—”
Tony hums noncommittally and tightens his arms around Steve, dragging his nails lightly over the expanse of bare skin beneath his hands. “Don't want you to go,” he mumbles. “Too comfy to move. You're being a bad blanket right now.”
Steve waves cheerfully at the security guard at the desk who, to Tony's amazement smiles and greets Steve by name as they head out the front doors, “Don't forget to grab me a Pepsi, Steve.”
The sentiment is nice, he supposes, but Peggy doesn’t even know the half of it with Howard. She has no idea how far his demands stretch and how far his hold reaches, claws sunk deep beneath his skin from day one and he’ll never be free. She might know a thing or two about tough parents, but Howard is a whole other animal.
Steve looks like he's trying his best not to laugh. “Oh poor you. I once waited over an hour during a snowstorm, only for them to finally announce they were closing the station.”
Steve had squeezed his hand tightly, a warning or reassurance, Tony still doesn't know, but it had prevented him from launching into a ramble that definitely would have been taken the wrong way by the team, none of whom were used to Tony's charms.
After a stretch of silence that is far too long not to be suspicious, Tony pokes his head out of his blanket to glare over at Natasha, Natasha who is—on
“We should probably talk about this,” Steve says reasonably, his voice gravel rough. Tony knows this, agrees with this, just thought about this, but he’s so so
“Was he now?” Tony says, a smile curling his lips. He glances over at Steve whose cheeks are beet red and he's refusing to meet Tony's eyes.
Sometimes on the weekends, they take the train for fun. Tony doesn't like to admit it, but Steve brings a sense of magic to everything they do, even something as mundane as taking the subway. They've taken the train with no destination in mind before, going from one end of the D line to the other, which takes them from the very tip of Brooklyn to the edge of the Bronx. They do it for the simple pleasure of letting the swaybacked rocking of the train lull them into quiet conversation and they spend lazy weekend days riding all over the city, transferring to other lines on whim.
Tony has never cooked before. He had often baked with Jarvis and Ana when he was little, but he hasn't made anything more complicated than a bowl of cereal in years. He hasn't had the time to learn to cook since his responsibilities at Stark Industries grew so he's not much help in the kitchen, but he enjoys watching Steve and his mom throw together a simple meal, notices the warm way they tease one another and realizes that's who Steve gets his sense of humor from.
Tony makes a decision, just as the silence hangs for a moment too long. “She is,” he replies, and the relieved smile that hesitantly curls Steve’s mouth is enough to make his chest ache anew.
“But—“ Steve starts to protest but stops when Pepper puts a hand on his arm. He nods. “Okay. I’ll see you back in our room?”
He turns in a stumbling circle as uncontrollable laughter bubbles up in the back of his throat, disbelieving that the plan worked, it fucking
“Of you?” Bucky asks incredulously. “Nah, I would never let Stevie get close enough to me to do that. You look like you've been mauled by a wild animal.”
Christmas at Steve's house is an Affair, with a capital A. Sarah and Steve have been cooking all day, and Tony can smell it as soon as he steps inside the house. He is greeted at the door by Steve pressing a kiss to his cheek and the delicious smell of warmed eggnog and toasted hazelnuts wafting from the kitchen.
He hasn't seen Steve in four days since Howard emailed him about his newest blunder. Steve is very understanding, if not more and more worried sounding with every passing day that Tony doesn't show up during their lunch period and he knows Steve has been asking Loki and Nat and even Jarvis for updates on him.
“A centenarian,” Tony croaks, apparently instinctively choosing fight. His eyes widen and before he can make any moves to try and leap off the couch and make a run for it, Steve pounces.
“I wouldn't have known that about you now,” Tony reassures him. “Couldn't even say that about you then.”
Steve had always thought “making love” was a sugary graceless epithet, an outdated saccharine idiom that wrinkles his nose every time he hears it. That was until he got to have Tony.
“Hi, honey,” she says directly to Tony, and Tony wishes a chasm would open up in the rug and swallow him whole. “I'm Sarah Rogers. It's nice to meet you.”
Tony’s borrowed time is almost up. Even if the farce isn’t ended by Steve, Howard will make sure it’s over soon. He can’t afford to have Tony so constantly distracted, not when SI’s future is on the line and Tony is leaving for MIT in a few short months. Even Howard concedes he won’t have as much time for company work with college courses and bigger projects. After all, he expects Tony to get several degrees in the next couple of years.
