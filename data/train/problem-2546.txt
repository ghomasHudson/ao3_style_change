“I would never want to leave you, Dean. I chose you over heaven countless times, why would I do that if I wanted to leave? I didn’t want to impose.”
“Earlier. Anger’s always my first go-to. And I was scared and- and you were dying and saying things and I’m sorry,” He stumbles over his words, “I’m trying, and I’m not angry with you. You didn’t deserve that.”
But Cas was busy. Dean was busy. They had a job to do and pursuing anything would be unrealistic. It would only break their hearts. But Dean thought they would all come out of it alive. Maybe Cas had given him too much faith.
Suddenly Dean didn’t want to die anymore. He didn’t want to fuck off to the ends of the earth only to drop off the surface. He wanted beach vacations and fruity drinks with tiny goddamn umbrellas. He wanted karaoke bars and not having to worry about what lurked in the parking lot. He wanted Christmas Eve with Jody and Donna and the girls, he wanted fishing trips with Jack. He wanted family barbecues because they had a day off work at a normal job, not because the world might be fried and crispy by sunrise.
Two weeks later, Dean and Cas are pressed together in a booth at a small diner. Jack and Sam across from them. The conversation isn’t particularly riveting, it’s mostly between Sam and Dean, but Cas has his eyes focused on Dean, as he usually does. Then Dean turns to make a comment to Cas, grinning, and his hand falls on Cas’ thigh casually, only he doesn’t move it until he has to reach across the table for the condiments, but then a few minutes later, it’s his foot. Knocking into Cas’ and Cas nudges his foot back and he thinks they’ve crossed another line.
One afternoon, Cas is coming from his room to get a new book, but he stops outside the library when he hears Dean and Sam whisper-yelling.
“It’s okay. I don’t mind.” Cas says. He turns his head on the white hospital pillow to look at Dean fondly. “How are you, Dean?”
Regardless of how it happens, Cas’ room hasn’t been in use for almost a week, and Dean steals blankets and takes up too much space, he rolls over, crowding Cas to the very edge of the bed until he has to push Dean back to his own side, and every morning, they wake up right next to each other. It’s a miracle Sam hasn’t noticed yet.
“It’s okay if it’s just Dean though,” Sam says once Dean is out of earshot. Cas scrunches his eyebrows in confusion.
“I know. But I don’t want you to, okay? No more ‘happy to bleed for the winchesters’ shit, got it? You don’t deserve that. I’m not gonna ask that of you, not if I don’t need to. You gotta take care of yourself, man. I appreciate it, but I’d rather have you alive, so no more sacrifices.”
The nights that aren’t so silent are the days off. It’s beginning to feel peaceful again, between hunts, and things are tense, building up because Dean and Cas both know there’s more to this now. They both know it goes farther and deeper than either of them have been able to admit. It’s always been like this, but neither of them can figure out what kind of beginning is big enough for a love like theirs. So it continues to go unsaid.
During their family movie nights, Dean freely commented on the men and the women, then he rested his arm over the back of the couch and when Cas joined them, sitting under Dean’s arm, he moved in closer, not quite touching Cas, but Sam still shook his head at their ridiculousness. They were hopeless; Cas trying not to breathe the wrong way while Dean wrestled with himself over whether he should just put his arm on Cas’ shoulder or keep it on the couch.
“I love you too,” Dean says, his voice is thick and his hand moves from Cas’ arm to the back of his neck. “God, Cas, I love you.”
“It was easy. Just a salt and burn, we haven’t had one of those since… I don’t even know, everything’s gotten so complicated.”
Cas can’t take another sip, not wanting to wash away this grief with liquor, but not wanting to feel anything.
“I don’t expect anything in return Dean.” Cas says carefully, eyes still boring into Dean’s, “I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable with my devotion, Dean, I understand that this is not reciprocated-”
His voice is wrecked. He hasn’t peeled himself from under these covers and he knows he feels the worst he’s ever felt, but he’s making a promise to Dean.
He looks desperate, his eyes hopeful and scared and a little bit angry. His face is the most open Cas has seen from him in a while, he’s letting himself feel, but even more, he’s letting Cas see. He’s still as beautiful as ever. Still Dean Winchester. Maybe this is his breaking point, and maybe he’s already hit his breaking point. Maybe this is the beginning of rebuilding. That makes Cas heart flutter up in hope.
And they love him still, obviously, no question about that. Dean even feels he loves Cas more now: loves the visual of Cas brushing his teeth, loves the sound of Cas' soft snoring, even loves how Cas smells like sweat after hunts.
It's selfishness. Pure, naked selfishness. Undisguised and uninvited, yet there. It lights a fire inside of him when it arrives, a fire that wants to be fed. It burns and it pains, but Castiel knows that giving in to it would only make it unstoppable. So he tries his best to subdue it, ignore it if necessary, live with it. The fire roars when Dean is as close to him as he was earlier. Castiel can feel his hands wanting to reach out to claim Dean as his own. The flames licked on his insides when Dean touched Cas' lip, and Castiel wanted nothing more than to lean in without question, without consent, without hesitation.
Dean leans in to kiss the corner of it, soft and quick, and when he pulls back Cas' eyes are closed.
"You can open mine now," Dean says mysteriously, and pushes one of the gifts towards Sam with his foot.
The bedroom door is closed, and Dean presses the handle down to find out that it's locked as well. He knocks gently with a curled index finger.
"Really?" Sam asks, glancing at the bag. He walks over and pulls some of the stuff out - flour, milk, cartons of eggs, and a small box of cookie cutters. Dean takes them from Sam and throws the box on the counter next to where Cas is standing. He rips it open as Sam stores their food in the fridge and cupboards, then turns it over to empty its contents on the countertop. Cas glances over, interested.
And before Dean has the chance to do something dumb he presses a clumsy kiss on Cas' damp, salty lips. Cas is warm and responsive, pulls when Dean pushes, and Dean lays a hand on his cheek and brushes the tear-stroked skin with his thumb until they break apart with heavy gasps a minute later.
It's December 7th, and it's the first frosty day of the season. The bunker's heating system is turned up slightly more than usual, and its inhabitants stir in their beds as they slowly wake up.
He stares at the towel on the counter, where just a moment ago he was holding Cas and trying to get him to explain.
The Heritage Center has many stuffed versions of local animals, on display with walls of information about them. There's even a dinosaur model.
"I know," Dean says. "But me and Sam, we're going to help you, okay?" He smiles at Cas weakly and repeats, "I'm going to help you."
It seems so. Cas looks at the honey and brightly-colored bee-print socks in his lap and grins stupidly.
He wants to stay awake, Cas at his side. He wants to pretend this is their normal. He wants to feel Cas' breathing deepening, wants to hear his soft snores, wants to notice every time Cas moves. But he's tired, and wrapped up in warm blankets, and his stomach is full with delicious self-made cookies which remind him of his baking adventure with Cas, so soon he slips into wonderful dreams about a Christmas angel in a trench coat.
"Oh," Dean's good mood is back instantly. "It's fine, I'll go first." He picks up the last present and hands it to Cas.
Cas wants to ask why, but the food is smelling too delicious to ignore. He grabs a fork from the silverware drawer and starts eating without even sitting down. As he does so, he feels Dean's gaze on him.
"Cas..." Dean moves his hand on the counter, grabs Cas' wrist gently. Cas' grip on the towel tightens.
Dean notices though, and licks his lips nervously. "Uh-huh," he gets out, and takes the hat off. He looks at Sam with knitted brows as he puts the hat down on the couch's armrest. "Thanks," he says humourlessly, then suddenly there's a glint in his eye that Sam knows doesn't bode well for him.
"Tree's ready," Sam says as Dean begins to stir as well, then closes the door and dashes down the hallway before his brother can get a chance to throw a pillow at him.
Cas can understand that a bit better now. He feels love for Sam, but he loves him differently than he loves Dean.
"Nope," Dean disagrees simply and checks Cas' other bruises, pressing into them gently and asking how much they hurt.
Not the way he used to be, back when he was an angel. Fighting wars for heaven was exhausting and difficult, but Castiel was never
He thought he loved Dean back when he was an angel. Now he isn't quite so sure that what he felt was love. Maybe angels couldn't
Cas squints at the light in the main room and immediately feels sick again, which Dean seems to notice.
Dean shoots him a stern look, but it grows softer when Cas' eyes meet his. "Are you kidding? I only showed you how to cut your toenails
A second passes before Dean lets go of the hem of his shirt and it falls down to cover him again. Cas pulls his arm back quickly.
They’re driving home from a hunt and Dean sees Cas in the passenger seat from his peripheral vision, dark hair messy. There’s a smear of blood across his cheek, reminding Dean that Cas is human now. Cas can bleed. The sun lights up Cas’ eyes and Dean’s heart stops. He smiles to himself, thinking, this has to be the moment. He has to say this now. Because he feels it in every glance. Every touch. Every smile. He feels it so much he thinks he’ll explode.
When they reach the bunker it’s starting to get late and the rest of the evening is spent washing up and relaxing. Sam pats Cas on the back, assuring him that his cheek will heal just fine without stitches, and he says that he’s glad Cas is okay, which makes his heart warm a little bit.
He hunts as vicious as ever, the blade falling just as heavy in his hand as it always has. Slicing through skin as easy as it always will. He hunts like he was made for it, and he was. He was made for thick blood and red eyes and slit throats. He was made for gunshot wounds and suffering. Watching his baby brother die, keeping the bodies of people he loves in the living room like maybe they’ll wake up if he doesn’t burn them. He was made for this.
“Yep.” Dean says, getting in next to Cas. He sends his best friend a wide grin and Cas offers a small smile in return. Dean pats his thigh before turning the key in the ignition and backing out of the parking space.
“That’s ‘cause you were just… staring. Creepily. I don’t care if you’re sitting there. Even if you’re watching not creepily. It’s just the… intenses… eye thing…”
“You.” Cas says easily. Sam looks between the two of them with wide eyes, like he’s excited for them to finally admit their feelings, but then Cas turns to Sam. “And Sam. And Jack.”
Dean kind of hates Cas for leaving like that. He hates him for ever leaving when Dean so badly needed him to stay. He hates himself for not saying it back. He had been trying to. He’d been trying to say it for years, even if the words wouldn’t come out straight. He tried to say it in purgatory. Cas had heard him, he said he knew.
Now Sam has to look at this corpse, the face that doesn’t really look like Dean at all, though he’s looked like this a thousand times before. He had to lower this weightless heavy body to the ground. Onto the dirt, and it wasn’t holy enough for him, it wasn’t good enough, but Dean was never holy, he only seemed that way to Sam.
So they sit together in silence. It’s not sad, actually they feel happy for the first time in a while. Cas let’s himself think about it, this feeling. Dean makes him happy. Dean has always made him happy. The silence doesn’t last long though, and this time it’s Dean who interrupts it.
They took out the rest of the vampires and Cas has drawn a large complicated sigil on one of the walls and a few minutes later, he can hear Sam coming through the speaker of Cas’ phone in his pocket.
He opens to the first blank page and at the top he writes ‘Dean Winchester’. ‘Micheal's sword, the righteous man, human.’
He already cried on this case. When the ghosts had shown up, taunting him like they knew who he was. Like they knew what he might become. Taunting him for being the same as them.
Over the next few days, there’s more grief. They don’t talk about it again, but Sam sees how Dean pours himself over books in a way he never has before. When he’s not researching, he’s drinking, or he’s driving, mixtape in and windows down, or he’s fixing up Baby with the radio on, listening for odd weather patterns, weird fires, anything angelic. Anything that sounds like Cas.
Now Dean's over there, still a gun under the pillow, but in sweatpants and a Henley, no amulet, Cas on the other side of the bed, and shit— Sam really should be happy for him, should be happy about where their lives are headed, that Dean's alive and safe and not alone, about how much has changed since Dean showed up at Stanford with a smiley and playful façade to hide his worry and his fear.
Dean's breath hitches. He doesn't know what to do, so he does nothing. Then he feels icy fingers on his chin, gently pulling down. Dean lets himself be guided, and meets Cas' eyes for what feels like the millionth time today.
"Cas, of course I like you like this," he says finally, and inches a bit closer, careful not to lose his balance. "It's just... You're different than before."
"Good job, man," Dean says as he sits down on the opposite side of the table. Cas's attention is on Dean's eyes, which are full of pride. He bathes in that glory for a few moments, regarding Dean with a soft expression, making sure to savor the feeling of being useful. Dean looks back at him, unwavering stare, a smile on his lips, and mossy-green eyes to get lost in.
By the time they finally put lametta on all parts of the tree, Sam is done with ornaments and is already putting on the string of lights. He would prefer candles, but this is what they have, and introducing a fire hazard to the bunker wouldn't be the smartest thing he's done in this life.
make Dean's thoughts go haywire, nope), is soft and warm and just perfect against him, and Dean makes sure not to move his hand once Cas accidentally knocks against it with his knee.
"Don't thank me yet, it's been a while since I've done this." Dean reaches to close the door behind himself. It shuts with a quiet click. "I'm doing this to say sorry for being all over you earlier," he explains. "I overreacted."
Cas offers him the flower pot and Dean takes it carefully, avoiding looking at Cas' eyes. He spends the rest of the morning looking at the flower whenever he felt the urge to look at Cas. Sam turns up the music at one point, and Dean keeps his eyes on Cas' gift for the entire duration of a song Cas seems to enjoy enough to hum to.
In the beginning, Dean doesn't want to be kissed in public; that's hard. Sometimes he doesn't want to be kissed in private either, when they've been fighting or sometimes just because his brother is there, or because it's been a rough day, or week, or month, and Dean needs space for himself; that's harder.
Sam teaches Cas how to do research. It's way easier than stitching wounds, even if it takes longer, and Cas soon as a hang for it. He knew the basics already, having watched Sam typing away on his laptop for years, and being well-read on newspapers. Now he knows which websites to check, which keywords to type into google, and how to print it all out in a readable format. He also learns about library cards and fees and librarians shushing him when he's talking too loudly.
When Sam comes into the kitchen a few minutes later, Cas breaks the eye contact and starts eating his eggs. They're already cold by then.
Cas sleeps in Dean's bed more frequently with time, and it's hard to fall asleep when Dean's body heat burns into him, and it's hard to sleep through the night when Dean wakes up screaming from nightmares, again and again. It's hard to get up in the mornings too, though, when Dean's fingers are curled into Castiel's hair lazily, or when his arm is wrapped around Castiel's waist, tugging him closer. It's hard when, one day, Dean doesn't stop kissing Cas, and his hands are wandering under the hem of Cas' pants, and Cas remembers that Dean said he likes experienced women, of which Cas is neither, and it's a scary thing to lose yourself in another person like he did that day.
"Still not happening," Dean says, throat dry. He fights to put a sarcastic smile on his face. He's not going to confess to yearning for the feeling of safety Cas watching over him would inevitably bring.
Dean puts another strip of lametta on Cas, who is finally starting to smile at the ridiculousness of it and proceeds to take a bunch of lametta from Dean's hand and throw it over him.
"In a holiday mood?" Sam teases his brother. Dean straightens up, moves towards Sam, shrugging to the rhythm.
Sam takes one look at the pair of them strolling into the war room - Dean flustered and Cas smiling delicately - and somehow he just
He doesn't mind that; doesn't mind that he feels himself growing older physically; doesn't mind that he's going to die soon or - with a bit of bad luck - any day. But it just isn't enough time for him to completely adapt to this earthly, small way of living; a life full of love and hurt and
"Thanks, Cas," Dean says automatically. "Really, thanks," he adds after closing his eyes for a second to calm himself down.
"I love it, Dean," he says, picking up one of the socks and examining it closer. The bee print is pretty and detailed, not cartoonish, and the golden color ties it all together. "Thank you," he says and meets Dean's eyes.
Dean's words are cut off when suddenly there's a weight against him, Cas' breath in his mouth, their teeth clashing together, and a hand on his jacket pulling him closer. A soft sound escapes him, and he melts into the kiss instinctively, burying his fingers in the front of Cas' shirt. Only after several seconds he grabs ahold of his thoughts and pulls away from the angel.
They put on their winter coats and boots (a recommendation by Dean, because Cas doesn't seem to think it necessary - he hasn't been human for long, after all) and Dean even slips on a winter hat he finds in the pocket of Sam's coat. They exit the bunker, cold wind blowing at them as they step outside. It's not late, but dark except for the single light at the bunker's entrance. They stay close to it to stay inside the protective spells and light. A blanket of clouds is covering the sky, and big scattered snowflakes fall down onto the men.
"Cookie cutters," Dean explains, and Cas meets his eyes and nods, towel and plate still in his hands. He looks at the shapes a while longer, then goes back to drying off dishes. Dean huffs, unsatisfied with Cas' reaction. He picks out one of the cutters and slides it towards Cas. When Cas doesn't look at it, Dean puts a hand on Cas' hip and tugs gently. Cas looks up like a deer in headlights, staring first at Dean and then, at Dean's nod downwards, at the cookie-cutter. It's the shape of an angel.
"You don't like me like this," Cas says and glances down at Dean for a second. His trenchcoat is hanging down behind the branch, moving in the wind, and one of his hands is touching the trunk of the tree, fingers sliding over the rough tree bark in concentration as if reading Braille.
"Good. I greatly dislike this kind of pain," Cas tells him. "There is nothing I can do about it, it's infuriating."
Dean's not there for those learning sessions, which Sam seems to be more than okay with. So Cas concentrates hard on learning, on Sam's advice and praise and acknowledging nods, and less on how much he wants Dean to be here as well.
"Don't you dare give me something self-made," he tells Sam over breakfast one day, and Sam just scoffs into his coffee mug.
Cas stares at the still half-filled box of lametta with a wistful look in his eyes. "What do we do with the rest?"
Dean raises his eyebrows at him, then quickly turns away and rubs his face, muttering "No, I don't..."
, and despite everything Dean makes breakfast for the lot of them, every day, waiting for Sam's polite
Somewhere in the middle of the movie Dean gets up to get a blanket and spreads it over him and Cas, who pulls it up to his neck and nestles into the warmth, getting drowsy. Dean fights the urge to stretch his arm around Cas, completely with a fake yawn and everything, because Cas wouldn't know that stupid trick anyway, and Dean really wants an excuse to get closer to Cas.
Dean gathers his courage and takes Cas' hands in his own, warming them up for him. Cas leans in even closer at the touch, pressing his forehead into Dean's shoulder. Dean stiffens at the intimacy, unsure what to do.
Dean presses his lips together. "Good. We'll find something." It's a reassurement more for himself than for Cas.
Dean smirks and claps his brother on the shoulder. "Baking goods - I read a recipe and everythin'. We're making cookies," he announces.
And yet here he is, jealously writhing inside, and a venomous taste like gall. And he can't sleep, of course. Because his ears pick up every little faint sound that comes from behind the wall.
"Yeah." Dean stands up and helps Cas get up before walking over to the light switch and switching the lights off. Not a second later Sam turns on the string of lights, and the tree lights up in white and gold.
understand. Is this— is this just how you are from now on?" It sounds a bit harsher than he intended.
"I'll, uhh, I'll go talk to him," Dean says after staring at the door for a minute. Cas rushed out of it a few moments ago when the Winchesters and Meg kept trying to convince him to help fight the leviathans.
He parks in front of a bar, checks his face in the mirror and heads inside. He hasn’t hooked up with anyone in… years? Something feels wrong as he scopes out the nearly empty bar for someone who catches his eye. The bartender slides his drink across the counter and pulls around a stool to take a seat across from him. He takes her in, faded sea-green hair chopped jaggedly at shoulder length, big hoop earrings and black lipstick, eyeliner sharp enough to slice a man's heart right in two. He smiles at her, but his heart isn’t in it.
They go on a hunt that day. A ghoul a few hours away. Sam and Eileen ride in the backseat together so Cas takes shotgun and Dean lets him pick the music. He puts on Dean’s top 13 Zepp traxx.
“Of course, Cas.” Dean rolls his eyes and pulls his friend into a hug. “You keep us updated alright? We’re in this together, you dick.”
Then years had passed. Years, and years, and years, and eventually Dean came to realize that he didn’t give much of a shit anymore. He still denied it and he couldn’t force himself to act on it, but he didn’t grimace when someone called him gay. He didn’t get angry when someone assumed he and Cas were together. They did stand uncomfortably close. It was an honest mistake.
In the end, hell-hounds ripping ribbons of his skin and his guts being left in a puddle around his hell bound body... it made sense to him. He was always meant to go out bloody. At least he did it to save his brother, his one true purpose fulfilled.
Afraid and lost because they dared to love someone who wasn’t meant to be loved like that. Dead because they rebelled. Dead. For no reason besides that they had loved each other enough to die for it.
Castiel is ‘of god’ in the same way that he defied God more than anyone has ever dared to. Dean is too tired and too drunk to find the tragic beauty in Castiel’s name or story or life and death. So instead he closes the pocket knife and tucks it away.
“I’m okay, I’m good.” Dean mumbles and Cas tilts his head to the side, inspecting a bruise forming on his cheekbone. “Don’t heal me, Cas.” Dean says and Cas looks at him sadly before nodding.
“I love you too.” Cas says, and he’s already said it but it sounds more real now. Confirmation that it wasn’t all in Dean’s head. Cas loves him. He loves him even when he isn’t about to die. Maybe one day they can have this.
‘He wanted me to live. I don’t know what he saw and I don’t know if I will ever see it myself, but he saw a good man so I’m going to be as good a man as I can. I picked up a job application yesterday. Cas, I promise, I’m going to do my best.’
Protect Sam. Kill monsters. Save the world. Protect his family. Kill demons. Stop the apocalypse. Protect everyone. Kill angels. Stop Chuck.
Dean isn’t an early riser, but now that Cas sleeps it’s been discovered that Dean is an early riser compared to Cas. Either way, Dean has coffee ready for Cas when he wakes up. Sam goes out with Eileen sometimes, and on those nights, they make sure Jack is settled for the night early and Dean pulls out convenient store pie and puts on Zeppelin, and it isn’t a date. Not at all. But what else could it be?
“Yeah well,” John shrugs, there’s nothing they can do about it. “Maybe he deserved a bit of a beating.”
“How about the grace?” Sam asks quietly. Cas looks off at nothing for a minute, then he closes his eyes and moves to try and sit up. Dean puts his hand on Cas’ back to help him, and Cas winces, making Dean pull away worriedly.
Dean is sitting in his bed scrolling through Netflix on his laptop when Cas comes in. He sits on the edge of their bed and looks over at Dean.
They talk about everything and anything except for the big thing they need to talk about most. They know they have time, they’ll get to it eventually.
Dean taps his fingers on his glass in contemplation. He can’t stop thinking. He can’t get Cas out of his head.
Dean calls Sam, but he’s already backing out. Three long-ass minutes later, a sleep rumpled Sam is in the passenger seat, still in his pajamas, and looking awake and wide eyed at the prospect of Cas being alive.
“We should head back,” Sam says, breaking their staring contest. Dean nods and the three of them head towards Baby.
“I’m not angry.” Sam sighs. “I’m just... I’m not going to stop this just because you’re worried for us. Eileen is strong. We both are. And we know the risks.”
, but not expecting anything from Cas because the sight of Cas beaming, shoveling eggs into his mouth like his life depends on it, makes up for it thousandfold.
Being part of the team, like everything else it seems, is more difficult once Cas is human. He's a decent hunter - he knows this - when it comes to the actual
He stares as Dean looks up at him, gets up grudgingly, and cracks more eggs into the still-hot pan as if directed to do so instead of doing it of his own free will. He took the coffee with him and knocks it back while shuffling the eggs.
"Got it," Cas says, voice muffled in the pillow. He runs his hands over the linen beside it, preparing to grab it to calm himself. His whole body is screaming at him, the points of contact between him and Dean glowing hot, shooting sparks through his veins.
"Please explain," Dean says, grip on Cas tightening, not letting him run away, and moves in closer to Cas, beautiful green eyes looking down at him. Cas wants to get lost in them, dive in and never come up for air. Before Cas knows what he's doing he tilts his head up and touches his lips to Dean's. It's barely a kiss, quick and dry, and once it's done and Dean's eyes go wide Cas rips his hand away from Dean and says "I'm sorry."
It's hard for Dean, too. It's hard to stop pushing all his feelings down, expressing them instead. It's hard to work jobs because now he worries even more that someone might get hurt.
"Last night, when I was trying to fall asleep," he begins awkwardly, knowing very well that Dean misses context here, "I thought maybe I could do it, but I can't, I think," he says.
Sam takes a ball ornament from the box and demonstrates putting it on the tree. "Like this," he says.
"I'll start," Sam says as Dean sits down close to Cas. He gets up and takes the smaller one of the two gifts wrapped in newspaper and hands it to Cas. "A little something for you, I hope you like it."
Dean stops him with a raised hand before he can stutter out more nonsense. "Woah there, cowboy. Wanna try that again?"
It's just a few more hours until Christmas eve, and Sam finished putting up the tree. It reaches the ceiling of the bunker; it's big and wild, just perfect.
Sam lies. Lies on the old box spring mattress that's poking him in the back, cheap bedsheets under his skin and a light blanket thrown over his bare legs. Lies there in the shine of the motel parking lot's streetlights filtered through dull and dusty curtains, lies there listening to the hammering rain outside in Who-knows-where, Oklahoma, after a day of wading through a muddy forest in desperate and ultimately fruitless search of the monster that killed a John Doe not two days ago. A warm shower had cleansed him of the dirt and grime that had been collecting all over his body throughout the day. Now he lies there, squeaky clean, damp hair spread around his head as he stares up to the ceiling and thinks. Thinks about the case at first — why didn't they find the monster, how much longer will they have to stay here — and then about Dean, who's on the other side of the wall, in the room next door, with Cas. Thinks "this is okay".
"Shit, Cas, it's probably a concussion," Dean's voice says somewhere close to him. "Sam, can you finish off the spirit? I need to get Cas back to the hotel."
Castiel feels something bubbling up inside of him occasionally, something ugly and unreasonable, and when it's there he feels as far from heaven as he could possibly be.
They arrive at the bunker at sundown. Sam, exhausted from driving, practically falls into bed to catch a few z's, but Cas is wide awake, so Dean is too. They're in the library for a few more hours, Cas picking up a book, reading for a few minutes, then getting up to pick a different one. Dean watches him, asks him what the books are about, asks him how his head is doing ("Fine, Dean, thank you."), asks him what he thought about the hunt, asks him questions until Cas finally got tells him - very politely - that he would like to concentrate on reading. Dean shuts up for approximately four minutes before becoming restless. Then he takes out his phone and scrolls through some social feeds, opening the same apps again and again as if expecting something new each time. When his expectations are not fulfilled he locks his phone's screen again and places it back into his pocket. Then he's staring at Cas again, watching his eyes follow the text, flicking back to the start after each line.
Sam looks at his brother, and Dean looks back at him. There's a pause again, Cas stretching his legs out in front of him, then Sam says "So, last gift?"
Cas sees right through him. It's obvious by the way the corners of his mouth travel up ever so slightly. Bastard.
Cas feels Dean's gaze and returns it, and then suddenly Dean feels soft skin against his hand and Cas' fingers wrapping around his own, gently interlocking them. Cas turns his head towards the tree again, but his hand stays in Dean's, and Dean feels like his heart is about to explode into a million pieces, when Sam interrupts the moment.
Soon after that Dean goes to prepare their holiday meal - burgers. Sam and Cas join him in the kitchen to help and chat about Sam's new fancy book while Dean flips burger patties in silence.
"I know you said you wouldn't want to give me a massage. I just thought... maybe I can change your mind."
Dean doesn't say anything anymore, just lies there and feels Cas' eyes burning into his back. He thinks Cas is going to turn around and leave, walk back to his own bedroom like any normal person would. But of course Cas doesn't. Instead, Dean feels the bed tip towards the other side as Cas sits down at the edge of it.
"Guess so." Dean throws his jacket onto the couch to use as a pillow. Thinking about Victor Carr, he adds "I'd be pissed too if my buddy shot me for the gold we were supposed to share."
But Dean doesn’t have a normal life. He doesn’t have a normal family. And that morning he woke up feeling just as shitth as he always does.
‘Jack? Is Dean… is he okay? Is he dead?’ Cas doesn’t say the prayer out loud, but Sam can see it on his face.
‘Young man jumped outside grocery store last night... hospitalized... hate crime... wearing makeup... the attacker was not arrested.”
“Good.” Dean nods, mouth still full. He can’t look at Cas, but he feels his eyes on him, curious and confused but not prying. Dean sneaks a glance at him, smiles, and then puts the rest of his fries in his mouth.
“Career? Love… all of it?” Dean rubs a hand down his face, he doesn’t want to bother her, but she looks kind, “I’ve always had a purpose, a responsibility, and now… we’ve taken care of it, we’re free. I’m not sure what to do now.”
A few weeks have passed, and Dean has grown used to their new family dinners every evening. They still go on hunts, but the majority of them have been close to home, and Jack, with his new soul and strengthening powers, has been able to reshape their technique single handedly.
“I know Cas, I meant… you always leave.” Dean says, feeling helpless when it comes to words. “You could just… relax. Read a book. Listen to music, I don’t know. You don’t have to take off.”
When Cas wakes up in the morning the first time, Dean Winchester is asleep, he’s sprawled out on his stomach, halfway on top of Cas, one leg thrown over Cas’ legs and one arm wrapped around Cas’ waist, his face tucked into his shoulder. He’s breathing deep and content and Cas has warmth in his chest and his cheeks and wrapped up next to him.
Cas doesn’t know whether he wants to leave Dean’s room and never look back at it, too overwhelmed with the fact that Dean Winchester isn’t coming home this time. Or if he wants to stay here forever, reminding himself over and over that Dean Winchester was once alive and the world is better for it.
“Well, get in bed, you look too formal,” Dean grumbles, pulling back the blankets. Once they’re both under the covers and laying on their side, resting up on the elbows, Dean turns off one of the lamps so the lights aren’t as bright but they can still see each other well.
“Yes, Dean. Weak. My grace has not been strong in years, I thought you knew this.” Cas says, unbolting the door carefully and peaking around the corner. All clear.
“Why not?” Cas says eyes searching, not quite mocking, but Dean feels like he’s being told off. “Because you think you don’t deserve it?” He leans toward Dean over the arm of his chair, only a little “Dean Winchester I have never met anyone more deserving than you,”
“I mean, no. That’s not-” Dean turns bright red, shaking his head. “I didn’t-” he gives up trying to find an excuse, instead stuffing his burger in his face and avoiding both of their looks.
“I uh,” Dean clears his throat, hands tightening on the steering wheel. Cas straightens in his seat, like he knows what’s about to happen. Dean stares straight ahead. “I love you.”
Sam, Dean, and Cas head back towards the car, Sam still ignoring Dean in favor of his phone. He’s typing furiously, probably to Eileen, and Dean gives him a side eye behind his back.
"If he didn’t already know he loved Cas, this would be the moment he realized. If there ever was a moment he doubted whether Cas were an angel… if he hadn’t known angels were actually assholes… he’d say Cas is angelic. He’s otherworldly. He’s gorgeous, ethereal, breathtaking. All the stupid cliche stuff he sometimes hates himself for feeling. Dean feels all of it. Cas is everything and Dean is absolutely in love with him. For once, he’s not sure he can push the thought away."
Cas smites one quickly, moving on to fight violently with two more at once, and Dean is successful knifing down the biggest of the group and Sam takes down two in quick succession. But when Sam gets a hit to the head, going down far too quickly, Dean gives a last slash of his dagger before hurrying to his aid. Cas doesn’t get there in time, still struggling with his low grace, and things go downhill from there.
“It’s okay, my ‘mojo’ had been depleting slowly for a while before I… left. I had already come to terms with the idea of being human. I’m just sorry I won’t be of much help anymore.”
“Then go pack. We got time.” Dean says. He lifts the beer cooler and the snack cooler and carries them both to the impala in one trip.
He didn’t plan on Castiel becoming one of the most important people in his life, but when it happened, he realized he wasn’t so surprised. Still, he pushed away assumptions, buried possibilities. Ignored his own brain’s speculations.
Somehow, Dean finds himself standing at the edge of the universe. He’s staring out at a bloody sea, the rain falls heavy like heaven’s tears as God chokes on air by his feet. He doesn’t know what he’ll do now. He’s not sure how he’s supposed to live without something to kill. But when they get home, Cas settles down beside him with a glass of whiskey and a smile.
“And do what?” Cas tilts his head wonderingly. Dean shrugs, finishing his glass and pouring another one, he tops off Cas’ too.
Eileen and Sam are happy together. Eileen lives in the bunker almost ninety percent of the time, and it makes Dean sick with happiness for his brother and sick with grief all at once.
“Good. Well, uh, not good. But… I’m glad you’re here.” Dean stumbles over his words. “And I’m sorry about you mojo being gone.”
“As if you wouldn’t do the same thing,” Cas says, rolling his eyes, Dean almost smiles at that, but then Cas is looking at him seriously again. “I would sacrifice myself for you a hundred times over.”
“Well, I am. We don’t have any impending doom hanging over us at this particular moment, so… I’d say we’re pretty good.”
“I love you too.” He says. Cas pulls him back into a kiss. A few minutes later, Dean pulls away again. “You know, your bed still has pizza sauce in it. You could always take up that offer to share with me,”
So Cas grabs Dean’s abandoned weapon and follows him out the door and down the hall. Sam is waiting impatiently against Baby when they reach the sidewalk, blood smeared across the side of his head and his shirt. Cas wishes again that he could heal him, he still has some grace left, but it’s weak and fading. He knows it’s not enough to save a life, but the Winchesters have refused even the smallest bruises to be fixed. Cas stopped healing himself ages ago, not wanting to waste grace on himself in case something happened to the Winchesters.
It’s a sweet moment. Dean’s worries for his friend fading with every breath Cas takes. Smiling at each other, and feeling at peace. They’ve always stared at each other, haven’t they? But it feels odd to do it so openly. Dean wonders if Cas knows how Dean feels. He wonders if Cas feels the same. There’s no way a straight man would hold another man's hand like this. But Cas is strange, maybe he’s an exception. Dean almost wants to find an excuse for himself, the thought of being comfortable in his sexuality seems daunting. But Cas’ eyes are kind and caring and Dean has been working on this. He has. He’s not going to turn his ass back into the closet as soon as the option of being out presents itself.
They go everywhere. They do everything. They go on hikes through mountains and stand under freezing waterfalls and they go to all the museums Cas found online. They go to the grand canyon and Dean can feel Cas’ awe beside him, having never seen it from the human perspective before. Dean tears his gaze from Cas’ face and looks at the rocks. He feels like he’s falling. Not the aimless, hopeless, descent from the painful reality of their life into hell, but a peaceful falling… The pleasant drop in his stomach every time Cas laughs at his jokes, the twisting in his chest when Cas looks at him like Dean is the only thing he sees.
Dean forces himself to open his eyes then, He’s slouched against a cold wall on a cement floor and everything is dizzy. Cas immediately kneels next to Dean, a hand on his cheek and checking for injuries.
Sam chuckles. "You mean, your stomach twists, you start feeling dizzy, your hands are shaking, ...?"
Dean swings the door open slowly, and it reveals Castiel sitting on the edge of his bed with red-rimmed eyes and a face shining wet with tears.
He doesn’t realize it’s been a few minutes until Sam has his hand on his arm and is pulling him out of the room.
“But he did. You can’t change that. He obviously thought you were worth it.” Sam says. “And you are. We stopped Chuck,”
But now… eyes hovering on their names on the graves, the flames growing in front of him, the sudden stillness, the warning of the warm flames. He feels numb to it now.
“You wanna dance?” Dean holds out his hand. Cas takes it and Dean pulls him up and close. One hand on Cas’ lower back and the other still in his own hand. Cas’ shoulder comes up to rest on Dean’s shoulder over where the hand print used to be.
Dean hugs him again and once it becomes awkward, he holds on for a little bit longer. When Dean does pull away he’s misty eyes and hopeful, clutching onto the trenchcoat like if he lets go Cas will just disappear.
‘I saw a good man because that’s what you are, Dean. You didn’t need to believe it, but you were. You were kind and you were deserving and you were completely and wholly beautiful. I make to you the same promise you made me; to live. To do the best that I can. I love you, Dean Winchester, and I will until the day I die. Until then. Love, Cas.’
By the time the sirens are approaching, Sam has taken care of the demon’s bodies and put their weapons back in the impala so they won’t end up in jail. Sam gets them a room at the closest motel, and as soon as Cas has been stabilized, Sam manages to get Dean back to the hotel, promising that if there is any information at all, he’ll call.
Dean serves the burgers and Sam and Dean fill in Cas while they eat.Eileen arrives a few hours later and she hugs Cas as well, welcoming him back excitedly. Jack drops in and informs them of what happened. He’s rebuilding heaven, he says, and he needed more angels. He needed archangels.
They don’t stop hunting. Not right away at least. There are a few close encounters and a few injuries that don’t heal when they should and a fight that leaves Cas locked in his room and Dean driving aimlessly.
A while later, they’ve both showered and changed and have moved over to Dean’s bed to watch TV since Cas’ bed still has rice in it.
Plus, the revelation didn’t seem too important with the whole fighting God thing on their plates, and although for a while there had been hookups, times when he let himself let go for a moment, no harm in flirting, afterall… but it soon became clear that Dean wasn’t interested in that anymore. Neither men nor women made him feel the way he ached for.
“Dean, he’s Cas. He drinks coffee and watches bad movies with you and doesn’t know how to tie a tie the right way.” Dean’s grip tightens on the steering wheel. “He looks at you, he always has.”
He digs his hands into his pockets, not expecting to find anything, but coming up with his phone, low battery but alive. Thanking Jack for small miracles, Cas scrolls through his contact list, starting to make his way towards the main road, clicking on Dean’s name.
“I’m proud of you Dean.” Sam says, Dean scoffs. “Seriously. I wasn't sure if you were gonna let me mention it. I’m happy for you, you deserve this.”
“Dean, answer the phone please.” Cas sighs and Dean looks at him, gaze hard, before finally answering the call from Sam, his hand dropping from Cas’ shoulder to his wrist.
They drive in silence, Dean can’t think about anything but Cas, but thinking about him is just as bad. He can’t let himself hope until he has Cas in front of him.
Dean’s voice is loud in the suddenly silent room and they can both hear it shaking. Cas turns to look at him and Dean takes a minute to let his brain catch up before he’s scrambling to his feet. He’s not sure if he wants to rush to him, to hold onto him in case it comes back.
“I deserve this.” It comes out sounding unsure, so he repeats it. “We deserve this.” It sounds more confident, but not any less scared.
“Yes, but do you mean weak as in… not strong, or as in becoming human?”  Dean asks. Cas is silent for a moment, and Dean gets enough of an answer from that, he claps Cas on the shoulder in sympathy. “You should have told us, man.”
But he’s already glowing, the demon holding Cas back shrivels to dust and the demon holding back Dean looks on in fear. Cas’ wings spread out behind him, only visible in shadow, and Dean gapes. They’re broken, and missing nearly all of their feathers, and it makes Dean’s chest ache to see Cas, who had been so powerful, so unwavering in strength, look so weathered. Yet he still radiates strength and his glowing eyes stare right into the demon while he smites him. Sam is released from the invisible ropes, and Dean slumps back against the wall, the blade that was against his throat falls to the ground.
Little does Sam know, Miracle will soon begin to favor Dean’s bed to the pile of blankets on the ground, even though Cas, Dean, and a dog don’t all fit into one small bed.
Suddenly there’s light, the angel falls back a little, knife clattering to the ground, eyes lit up and burning away, Cas shields his eyes until he sees the brightness fade and hears the body hit the floor. When he looks again, Dean is standing in front of him, angel blade in hand. He looks worried, and before Cas can fully realize that he isn’t about to die, Dean has already dropped his angel blade and moved his hands to grip at Cas’ shoulders, his coat, holding his cheek and examining the cut.
"What, are you blind? Do you even know what Cas' lips look like?" Sam rolls his eyes. "Hey! Stay here," Dean commands as Cas takes a step back.
And he really does love Cas. He loves Cas like he loves Sam, fully and unconditionally and eternally; Cas is his family, through and through. But... sometimes Dean questions whether that is everything he feels for Cas. There seems to be a thread connecting the two men: tiny, silver, glowing like Cas' grace used to, strong, never letting go. It's not the scars on their skin or the blood in their veins that connects them, it's something else entirely. When Dean falls, the thread pulls Cas down with him; When Cas is gone, the thread tugs Dean's heart along.
Cas looks confused now, and honestly a bit annoyed, and puts the book he's been reading on the table, not breaking their eye contact.
Dean would be a lot more okay with). It won't help anyone if he scares his brother off by being too bold. Cas is already having a hard time as it is, Sam doesn't want to make it all worse for the poor guy by effectively forcing Dean to prove his heterosexuality. (Yeah, right.)
If he were still an angel he would simply ask the Winchesters for advice. But, as it is, with him being human, he can't. He simply
blind, and knows very well that Cas looks at him. It was strange at first, but now it's a familiar feeling he welcomes - a tickle on the back of his neck, like a soft touch, a
"You're gonna make some," Dean sighs. "Hell, you've made many." He holds up a hand to stop Cas from interrupting. Cas looks up at him with hurt on his face. "It's okay, we all did. You shouldn't worry about it so much."
Cas and Sam stare at Dean, but Dean just laughs it off. "Come on," he mutters and promptly adds another strip of lametta to Cas' hair.
against his nerves, repeating every few hours, growing more frequent. He feels like he's holding the floodgates, pressure building up on the other side. Micheal is using everything he has got to break free from the prison Dean has built in his head, and it's only a matter of time until he succeeds.
"I cooked, you clean up," he says to both of them, meeting Cas' eyes for a fraction of a second. Dean is too full to complain, so he takes the plates and lets the sink run full with water.
, mind already somewhere else, probably going over their plan again. Meg shoots Dean a look he can't quite decipher as he leaves the cabin.
Dean clears his throat and hooks a finger into a belt loop, aiming for a casual stance. "Cas, we're— I'm sorry," he says, tilting his head in an attempt to catch Cas' eyes.
Dean looks down and sees Sam, hands in the pockets of his jacket, hair tucked behind his ears. He looks somewhat puzzled.
"It's spiked," Dean explains. The redness of his nose and quiver in his tone suggests that the alcohol in the hot chocolate isn't the only one he has consumed.
Cas is impatient and often embarrassed, but mostly, Dean knows, Cas feels useless. It used to be so easy for him. Be loyal, be family, okay, that's hard, or maybe not, but: be part of the team, that's easy, or it used to be anyway. Smite some demons, heal the boys, zap them here and there with no real need for a car beside its comfort and homeliness, and boom, you're part of the team.
Thoughts of Sam too: Talking to Sam, confessing to him, laying it all out before him, asking him for help with this. In his mind Sam is gentle and supportive, yet honest, giving him advice and guidance, which, unfortunately in his thoughts, is just white noise, unknown information.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you," the angel says, worry on his face as clear as the bags under his eyes. He looks just as exhausted as Dean feels. This whole situation is taking a toll on everyone.
Dean claps his hands softly. "Alright, that's enough." He clears his throat and crawls off the bed to stand, leaving Castiel feeling very light but also cold.
"But," Dean continues as he drops his hand from Cas' face, "we could save so many people. Hell, maybe
A minute passes, maybe two. Finally, the hammering subsides, and Dean is left with nothing but stillness. He meets his own gaze in the mirror and breathes slowly, once, twice, blinking the dizziness away. Whenever Michael is quiet Dean can almost pretend that everything is okay.
About an hour later there's a quiet knock on the door. It's Sam, here to check on Dean. He only finds Cas awake, a fond smile on his face, and Dean hugging the angel's thighs, using them as a pillow, snoring softly.
Cas wipes his mouth and tries very hard to believe him. He stares into the toilet bowl for a few more minutes, spitting occasionally. After a while, Dean gets up and hands him some tissues and a glass of water. Cas accepts them gratefully and cleans himself up.
, strange, unknown. Again and again, Castiel has to deal with a first time. The sensation of something being stuck in his throat. Words not coming out when he wants them to. Shaky hands. There seems to be an endless amount of things, and each time he discovers a new one he sinks further into the hole he's hiding in, attempting an escape from it all but only finding himself deeper in his own thoughts.
"Yeah, well, your birthday's coming up," Sam says, and can't help but look over to Cas to see his reaction.
of the light switch and a turn, then he's staring into the dark, lying on his side, facing away from Cas.
Sam goes for a run, Dean makes breakfast while Cas sleeps in. They got into a certain rhythm here, and there were almost no hunts in the past month. They're safe, and warm, in their home.
Cas moves, then suddenly there's a hand in Dean's hair, fingers threading through carefully. It feels amazing, and Dean closes his eyes and sighs. The gentle movement of Cas' fingertips on his scalp sends shivers down his spine. He holds on to the feeling, forcing it deep into his memories as to never forget it. And that is how he slips into unconsciousness; with Castiel's loving touch on his mind and a heart full of hope.
"I mean— It's fine, I'm fine," Dean assures him, moving his hands through his hair. "I'm just worried I won't be— in control anymore, once I wake up again."
Dean is thrown back to all the times Cas has said the same to him in the past. So much has changed since then. Cas isn't as clueless as he used to be, Dean is sure that the angel now is aware of every significance and implication of his suggestion.
Dean can't help but break out in laughter and throws up the rest of the strips in his hands towards Cas. Cas has a big lopsided grin on his face, and Dean feels his stomach flutter at the sight. They look at each other for a moment, then - at the same time - throw themselves towards the box to grab more. Dean is faster, and he manages to unload a fistful of lametta over Cas's shoulders. Cas, with his proclivity to the dramatic, laughs out loud, and defends himself by picking up the whole box and upending it over Dean, who goes to the ground, half from the lametta raining over him, half from laughing so hard that his knees have given out. Cas chucks the empty box away and hears Sam laugh with them as Cas follows Dean to the ground. He starts picking at Dean, grabbing tufts of lametta and attempting to decorate Dean's clothes with them, which isn't easy because they're both shaking from laughter. He takes from Dean's shoulder and puts some in the pocket of his shirt instead, then picks some from Dean's hair and sticks it behind Dean's ear. Dean calms down at the touch, so Cas does too, and they grin at each other as Cas continues his work.
Sam quirks an eyebrow at him and rips the Christmas wrapper off. Two small packages fall into his lap. He picks up one of them, and his face falls.
Cas nods as if that was all the reply he needed. Their eyes meet for a moment, and Dean shys away from them, fearing how well Cas could read him.
"Hell, I wouldn't mind if you did it again," Dean says with a chuckle, and feels a blush spread over his neck. He's playing with the hem of his shirt, searching for something to grab onto.
Dean clears his throat. "I don't mind -," he starts, and gestures vaguely into the direction of the hallway, "that you kissed me."
"Oh god," Sam says, and averts his eyes as Dean pulls up the new pair of jeans. He puts on a belt and the new buckle, sticks his thumb in the belt loops, and poses.
When Sam gets sick of asking questions he starts staring out of the window quietly, as he so often does, and Cas looks at him for a few minutes before turning his head towards Dean. Watching Dean is for Cas what looking out the window is for Sam. They remain like this for the last two hours of their journey, only occasionally exchanging words. Cas knows that Dean feels him staring, but Dean never complains.
Dean's not going to admit that seeing Sam with old-people glasses makes him feel warm and safe. He's also not going to admit that the glasses actually look really good on Sam. Instead, he raises his hand in a peace sign and says "How many fingers am I holding up?"
"I'm a burden," Cas says. He's going for matter-of-factly, but it ends up sounding a bit whiny. He's sitting on his bed, Dean standing in front of him.
Sam cocks a gun from a corner of the room. "It must be the gold. He never actually owned it but it was technically his because of the deal," he says.
"It's not just any flower," Cas explains. "It's from the garden," he says in a tone that suggests some kind of importance that was lost on the Winchesters. "It was Adam's first gift to Eve," he continues when he meets blank faces.
Cas tries to sit up, and the building begins to spin. He makes a choking sound instead of answering, and presses his eyes shut in an attempt to stabilize his surroundings.
Dean shoots a glance at Sam. "Well, Sam's sleeping, I think the booze got to him," he explains needlessly.
There are good things and bad things about having an angel as a best friend. The good things - well, Dean doesn't even begin to list those, because it would take years - and the bad things... There's really only one. And that's the fact that apparently it can all be taken from you rather quickly, and then all those good things are gone.
Sam huffs. Dean is right of course, but that doesn't make this any less mortifying. "Thanks," he says.
Cas seems to sense it, because a few moments later he's dropping his trenchcoat, carelessly abandoning it on the floor. He climbs into bed in what seems to be slow motion, and the weight of his body dips the mattress, almost sending Dean tumbling in his direction. Cas props himself up against the headboard, leaning on the wall, and turns his head towards him with a sigh.
Castiel isn't used to being hurt, pained. He isn't used to being incapable of doing certain things, to being forced to rest (not just for hours every single night, but more than that even when he was sick or injured). Dean aids the ex-angel as best he can, with all his energy and all his heart, and all the booze and classic rock it takes to keep himself from going mad at Cas - Cas, who's always moping about, always drowning in self-pity - it's ugly, really. Cas, caffeine-addicted, I-want-the-ones-with-the-dinosaurs-on-them, aspirin-abusing Cas. And Dean, just doing his best, aching himself, with a bad back and tired eyes and messy hair and layers of scars. And Sam, dealing with troubles of his own, watching them, losing sleep over them, hovering always two steps behind, ready to jump in and help if his brother and Cas needed him to.
"Thank you," Castiel says again, and looks Dean in the eyes. There's a new feeling again: It's like tufts of cotton are clouding his brain. He doesn't want the moment to stop. He doesn't want Dean to go and leave him here alone. Even if it's all based on a lie Castiel wants it, and he's ashamed of it, but the thought of Dean trumps everything else there is.
Dean can't help but smile at that, and turns away again. "You're really gonna stand there all night?"
But he doesn't say anything, keeps his mouth shut and his breath held, face in pillow, fingers clutching the bedsheets.
Cas pulls back as if Dean gave him an electronic shock and apologizes, and Dean wants to tell him that he's not mad, he's not upset, just surprised, but all that comes out is a weak "Cas..." and before he can will his body to move, Cas is gone.
A noise comes from the kitchen door and Cas turns around, plate in hand, to see Sam. He looks well-rested and healthy of course, in his running outfit, glowing compared to them, and even has a smile plastered on his face.
In short, Cas feels like a burden. And he tells Dean so one day when he can't take it anymore. Dean just disinfected a wound on Cas' shoulder, and it keeps stinging even after Dean has wrapped it in bandages.
"Good choice," Dean says, lets go of Cas, and shakes off some of the lametta stuck to him. He forces himself to stop looking at Cas, and looks at Sam instead, who's watching them not very inconspicuously.
Soon after that, on a cool summer evening, the three of them go for a walk together, slow, with many breaks for Dean to rest his leg, even if he insists that he's fine. The wind rushes through the trees above them, making Cas' coat flutter and Sam's hair dance in front of his face. They stop on top of a hill and Dean says "Let's live like this forever" with a gentle smile while the setting sun's orange glow lights up the freckles on his face, and Cas pulls out the little box from his pocket and kneels before him and asks him to marry him.
Then they’re going on errands together, Dean says he needs to show Cas how they do things, show him which brand of shampoo they like and where to find the good beer. But then Dean continues to accompany Cas, just because it takes half the time with two people and when Cas finds some odd organic snack to try, Dean gets to bicker with him about it.
