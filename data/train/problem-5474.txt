He decides to chance it. “What did it? Does it have anything to do with Peter?” he asks, not allowing himself to stop making the sandwich and turn around. If he does that, Tony’ll see how much this affects him.
“I love you, Steve,” he finishes in a rush of breath, eyes wide, pupils blown out so the blue is but a thin ring of color around the dilated pupil, his fingers twitching and trembling crazily to make up with the lack of touch they’re getting, and Steve’s heart has just about stopped in his chest, because,
. And what had he done, instead of thanking her and telling her goodbye or even hugging her like she’d wanted?
Peter tries to convince him otherwise, but Steve knows better than to let his hope get the better of him. Just because he’s dodged this bullet—just because he hasn’t lost Tony this time—it doesn’t mean to say he’s completely out of the dark yet. He doesn’t want to run the risk of losing Tony, especially now he’s found himself this close to risk flourishing into actuality, and so his mind’s already made up; his resolve iron-clad. He’s not going to pursue Tony. He can’t do it. If he does, he’ll lose him forever, and it’ll leave Peter without his own father, and he just
years old, Steve! They’ve got so much time that’s been fucking lost, Steve, and I can fix that, I can bring them all together, but I’m so worried about losing him that I can’t even tell the kid that they exist!” Tony’s chest is heaving, and he looks like he’s ready to rip something apart, and now Steve can understand why he’s been so angry recently—he’d be, too, if his morality was fighting with his selfishness.
Tony’s confused, but at the same time, he’s beginning to content himself with the prospect that Steve’s come to his senses.
“Tony, never say that again!” Peter calls from his place sandwiched between Natasha and Clint on the couch, “You are hereby banned, forever, from
“You’re doing so good,” he mumbles into Steve’s skin when he presses their chests together, one hand remaining on Steve’s hip while the other pressed into the mattress for leverage, “So damned good, Steve.”
It’s the second day of Peter’s most recent infiltration of Steve’s apartment while Tony was away in Copenhagen for yet another conference, which he’d (for lack of a better way to put it) bitched and moaned about having to go to for about two weeks straight before Happy had to come in and physically drag Tony to his jet
one, the one I’m pointing at, please, Steve—but he’s also more triggered by people pushing him out of his comfort zone more than he’s willing to be—Steve, please, I’m losing respect for you, the purple handle you’ve passed three
I'm sorry this is such shit. I was beginning to upload and then I realized I don't like the ending (which possibly has something to do with the fact that I'm crap at writing sequels and such and this is really uncharted territory for me) and so I just hope you don't hate me as much as I hate myself bc I had to explain Steve's feelings for the next one up in this series just don't hate me if it helps I'm writing a teen!Peter fic right now set after Ultron in this universe and I'm trying really hard at that so be kind and don't hate this
“Don’t change the subject to the arbitrary, Rogers,” Clint says as he wags his finger at him, “There’s a real issue we need to talk about, right here.” He holds up the tablet. “You did not honestly tell this man that
Steve looks horrified as he quickly responds, “Of course not,” seemingly aghast at the idea, “Why would you think something like that? I just wanted to ask if you wanted time to think about what I told you. To, I’m not sure what—grieve?”
Steve nods. “You’re right. I can’t say that,” he responds, which knocks Tony off-kilter a bit, “I would do it without a thought a thousand times over, but the difference is that I don’t have people who need me like they need you, Tony, so I can commit the selfish act. You, however, don’t have that luxury.”
Tony looks at him for a long moment before he laughs, shaking his head. “Well, that’d be weird, if you loved me like a dad. Considering that, you know, you predate the dinosaurs and all, whereas I, in comparison to your state as a relic, am in the springtime of my youth.”
It’s said so out of the blue that it takes Steve embarrassingly long to quantify what exactly it is that Peter’s even said, but when he does, he’s almost instantly gone scarlet in the cheeks, pinching the bridge of his nose as he contemplates the life decisions that’s led him to the point that a middle-schooler finds reason to fuss about with his romantic life.
“Tony talks about everybody a lot, Peter,” Steve informs the child, “If that’s the logic you’re going to use, then Tony should just date anyone. Maybe Clint.”
And, if there is a bigger travesty to come out this whole mess, Tony can’t see it, and it just wrecks him, because it’s one thing for him to lose a love—it’s entirely different for his son to lose yet another parent. It’s something he wanted to spare him of, save him the pain of, and yet, here he found himself; a catalyst in the destruction of the small family Peter found himself, finding himself shouldered with pain like no other.
Clint pauses mid-bite. “Oh?” he asks, pulling the apple away with a frown, “He didn’t mention that.”
“Besides the point,” Rhodey sighs, “I don’t think Steve’s the kind to let something like that get to him. All he said was that he wanted to talk, right? It doesn’t necessarily mean anything’s wrong.”
, just make it all end, because he’s just tired, he’s tired of his life just throwing shit at him, tired of this being his lot in life, having things taken and taken and taken when he’s done nothing more than try to do the right thing for other people.
“We could tell,” Clint responds dryly, arching a brow as he takes another spoonful of rocky road, but he’s hardly annoyed at it now, not when Nat keeps looking over at Clint with such a worryingly guarded look—and especially not when Clint’s looking the way he is at this moment, like he’s less likely to crack a joke and more likely to crack a skull. Steve puts down the eraser when he notices it, crossing his arms over his chest in order to look more confident under the scrutiny of the two master spies, because neither look to be in a particularly jocular mood, which is typical for the redhead but completely out of sorts for the archer he knows.
Tony’s not sure what to say for a few moments, enough time for Steve to settle back, looking a bit worried about the possible reaction, so Tony informs him,
He follows Steve back out to the main area, sitting down on the couch like Steve motions him to, and immediately begins to fidget with his fingers, having never been able to remain completely still. He watches Steve carefully, gauging his emotions as best as he can considering Steve isn’t expressing all too much, which the man is more than aware of and purposefully trying to do, because he’s afraid that if Tony knows that the least of all of what he’s feeling is anger, he’ll make him lose his resolve.
From the couch, Peter asks if anyone’s gonna talk about how Tony just called him a shitbag. No one does, mostly because they all know that Peter doesn’t actually mind it as much as his tone suggests. He only argues it for the sake of arguing it, not really because it bothers him. If he truly wants it to stop, then he could stop it any time, because he’s got Tony wrapped around his little finger and he
“Only by accident,” wiping hard at his cheeks to rid himself of his frozen tears, his body trembling from the cold that seeps past the insulation, glaring at Tony half-heartedly with those beautiful eyes of his, “You can’t do this to me, Dad.”
It doesn’t feel like too long before Steve’s on the stage, standing behind the podium; staring straight forwards through the flashing bulbs showering upon him from the crowd, doing his best not to seem like he’s not been a mess these past few days, because the public can’t know how close he is to shattering apart like glass—he’s here to let them know that the Avengers are standing strong in reaction, not crumbling like ruins. Steve’s hands grip the podium, and if he pretends enough, he can almost pretend he’s sitting on the couch of his living room, watching television with Peter, who’s looking at him from his place in the front of the crowd with a quiet encouragement in the depths of his eyes.
Steve can’t help but chuckle at Peter’s hopefulness. “It’s a bit more complex than that, Peter,” he tells the kid whose head rests in the crook of his neck, his eyes on the tablet screen as he reads through the latest news update just after he gets news that Tony’s been intercepted by Clint, and is currently being checked out with a local medical center in Florida, along with Rhodes and Pepper, whilst Killian’s operation is being dissolved.
“Well, now that I’ve fulfilled my Peter traumatization quota, how’re you, Steve? Still in a relationship with your right hand?” he asks.
Steve pauses now, too—Clint’s good at reading people. In fact, as good as Natasha is at knowing how people operate, Clint’s surpasses her by far in actually
“I didn’t, either,” Steve says with a chuckle, holding out his hand for Peter to shake (which he does—vigorously), “And I told you that Steve’s okay.”
Tony whistles. “You’ve been swearing an awful lot today there, pal,” he says, pushing up so that he's sitting upright, waggling a finger in Steve’s direction with a smirk, “Makes me think that we let you hang out with Barton too much. The man’s a bad influence.”
films, which he has to admit aren’t too bad, though he feels like he’s kind of missing something at the beginning of
Peter almost sounds vaguely frustrated when he responds, “Okay, yeah, that’s all good, but that’s not what I
Steve and Tony, your focuses should be on not only each other, but the needs of yourself to communicate them, and from what you’re telling me, I’m guessing you guys only do about half of that.” Rhodey smiles softly now. “You two just need to discuss what the other needs to give each other what you two want. That’s all you need to do.”
“I don’t hang my own art,” Steve replies absent-mindedly. Bucky had tried to convince him to for the longest time back in the day, but he'd never taken to the idea, finding it to be weird.
Tony doesn’t argue, doesn’t speak; his throat’s too dry from the guttural voice Steve’s just used, removing his fingers and grabbing more lube from where he’s left it upon the nightstand, trying to slick himself up quickly so he can find a similar release. Steve watches him all the while, with bleary eyes that don’t match up with the focus he apparently has, his cock barely losing any hardness before it’s back to an angry red color, twitching impatiently against Steve’s abdomen.
Tony’s back on Sunday morning. He knows because Peter accidentally and literally runs over him on his way out the apartment, stepping hard on Steve’s abdomen. It doesn’t hurt, but it definitely wakes him up. It’s about four-thirty in the morning and only really a half-hour off from the time that he usually wakes, so he gets up, finally deflates the mattress for the first time the whole week and gets out of the tower for his run before the rest of Manhattan really wakes up, before he can be asked for any sort of photos or autographs or the like. He runs down to Central Park, loops around the entirety of it about five or six times before he breaks a sweat. By then, the homeless are beginning to wake up as life breathes back through the city’s inhabitants. He stops running somewhere after seven and decides to head back.
Tony’s gaze doesn’t stay on him for long. It moves over to Peter’s sleeping face, and the heat smolders behind the adoration that surfaces for the boy, Tony’s hand moving to Peter’s forehead as he brushes his hair out of his face, and Steve can see the layers of tension just disappear from the lines of Tony’s face. He’s definitely looking like all he needs right now is to sleep the next few days away, and Steve can tell that he’s going to do so whether he wants to or not, but he forces himself to stay awake regardless, caressing Peter’s face gently, as if he’s afraid he’ll disappear if he’s not careful. Steve has half a mind to wake Peter up, but it’s really the first time throughout this whole ordeal that Peter’s sleeping peacefully, and not at all due to utter exhaustion, so he’s not all too keen to do so, which Tony doesn’t seem all to upset with, based on the way he rubs the bags under Peter’s eyes with the pad of his thumb.
He shakes his head rapidly. “No,” he says, maybe a bit too harshly, so he tries to settle himself down, forcing himself to explain quietly, “If we wait, it’s just going to make it worse on me, so for the sake of my ongoing sanity, we should probably get this over with.”
Most of the free world finds Rogers attractive, Peter. Six-foot-tall blond muscle heads tend to be found alluring.”
Clint grumbles but acquiesces to Steve’s wishes, contenting himself with continuing to scroll through the messages. Steve doesn’t even bother trying to stop him—it would be but an exercise in frustration, because Clint’s the kind of guy who will just bug him until he hears what he wants to hear. It’s easier for Steve, in the long run, if he just lets him read it instead. Clint gets what he wants and Steve, for his part, doesn’t have to waste the time trying to find the words to explain.
have fun when he stays over, even if it is cooking and watching movies, and to an extent he does like having someone to take care of. It’s a welcome feeling, to be relied on, rather than to be the one relying on the care of another like he’d been forced to so often in the past, though he’s aware that Peter doesn’t actually really need him. In fact, he sometimes finds himself a bit saddened when Tony comes home—it may mean he gets to see the man again, but it
THIS IS MY FIRST SERIES AND IT'S MY PRECIOUS BABY AND YOU ALL LIKE IT AND I NEED TO FINISH THE PETER FIC SOON BC I'M GONNA NEED SOMETHING TO UPLOAD WHEN THIS GUY IS DONE WHICH SHOULDN'T BE FOR ANOTHER FEW WEEKS BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW QUICKLY MY STORIES HIT THEIR VIEW MILESTONES FOR UPLOADS WHICH MEANS Y'ALL SHOULD SPREAD THE WORD
Peter’s lips pucker slightly as he actually thinks of a good example to give, staring into the oversized green blanket he always brings with him every time he comes to stay at Steve’s. It’s more than a comfort, for Peter at least, what with the well-worn corners that threaten to tear into holes, as well as the multitude of stains—some grease, some tomato sauce, and some entirely too unidentifiable for Steve’s comfort—and Peter holds this ratty old thing as if it’s some sort of anchor, hands fisted tight into the fabric.
into Steve’s shoulder as he releases inside of him like he’s always dreamed about doing, lost in the sound of Steve’s cries and the feel as the muscles around him milk him for his orgasm. Steve comes between them with a moan, their stomachs sticky with the feel of Steve’s cum.
attractive he found said man), initially surprised by how well cleaned-out Steve is and filing it away for a future topic of conversation before he focuses on coaxing the man into relaxation, because, as he so aptly puts, “This isn’t going to be a whole lot of fun for either of us if you snap my finger in two,” which Steve apparently agrees with as he relaxes just enough for Tony to pull out the finger just a bit.
How can he, after all, when he’s so busy resisting the urge to scream in frustration? Honestly, between Natasha’s pestering and her near-constant setting up of blind dates for Steve and now Peter’s badgering, Steve’s nearly ready to take up a life of priesthood just to spite the pair of them.
“Steve, you’ve been here months,” Tony says finally, “Not even a picture? You make a crapton of them, after all.”
And they are. They’re really good friends, and, if Steve’s being completely honest with himself, Tony’s probably his best friend, which Steve’s more than thankful for every single day. He treasures the bond that Tony allows him to have with him. It’s sacred for Steve; one of the most important things in his life in the modern age.
, like Tony tends to assume; and so within seconds, he’s online, searching randomly through the pages upon pages to catch up.
Peter pouts, but it’s all in good spirits, Tony can tell, his eyes twinkling as he says, “Hope you don’t keel over and die, old man,” all but running out the door with his coat on upside-down, struggling to pull on his backpack.
Steve knows the way, by now, to Peter’s school and group home alike, so he’s understandably a bit confused when Tony goes right past the turn that would lead to the neighborhood that Peter currently lives, his jaw visibly tightening.
in time to keep Pepper off of both their asses. Tony’s set to be gone for the next week or so, and so Steve knows that he’s probably going to be playing the role of Peter’s caretaker for the week. Fortunately for him, the air mattress he’d ordered came in the weekend previous, and patiently awaits inflation for when Peter’s too conked out from all the films—however, he’s got to make it past the whole fact that there is
“I’m good,” Steve informs him with a laugh, meanwhile, in the background of his attentions, Bruce gives up, making his way over towards Natasha and plopping down in front of her in a wordless demand to undo what she’s done, which she’s more than happy to comply with, content smile in place as she continues her drinking contest with Clint, but in front of him, Tony laughs with him, smiling brightly at him, happiness infectious, and it’s suddenly taking a bit too much of Steve’s self-control not to burrow his face into Tony’s neck.
It’s been a while, since Tony was last rendered nervous about the notion of sex, but in all honesty, it’s also been just as long since Tony was so enamored with the person he was having sex with. He hadn’t felt this way probably since his college days—not even Pepper made him feel as excited, as nervous, as he feels as he walks down that seemingly expansive hallway to his bedroom, Steve only steps behind, the two of them silent as the implication of what may come (hopefully, the both of them) became less and less of fantasy and more of reality. He does his best to ignore his inner preteen, who hoots and hollers in triumph, their mutual dream of finally getting to bone Captain
The pause is almost audible, even louder than the clang of the tool as Tony puts it down as he sighs. Steve can picture him rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Why do I get the feeling you’re trying to pseudo-parent-trap me?”
Steve’s on the phone with Pepper within minutes, Peter hot on his tail as he goes to the communal floor, which already has Clint and Natasha already prepping for flight, both of them having been obviously otherwise relaxed, if Clint’s bedhead his any indication to the fact, neither of them looking pleased at all with the situation (Clint especially), while Bruce busies himself with trying to get in contact with Tony himself, which Peter latches onto almost instantly. The TV plays the various news channels, which all focus on the fact that a billionaire superhero just challenged a terrorist, and Steve’s
When they get to the tower, Tony manages to coerce Steve into sticking with them for a bit, so he does; he joins them on Tony's personal floor and challenges Peter to a game of Mario Kart, which he knows he’s not going to win only because he can’t bring himself to actually play his hardest against Peter (he saves his hardest for Bruce, who is scarily good at the game), while Tony watches them, occasionally making commentary about how shit Steve is despite knowing full well that the man isn’t trying, as Steve’s always beaten him, and Steve doesn’t mind at all, because it’s keeping Tony calm and Peter happy. So Steve simply laughs, not minding one bit that his Waluigi (not his favorite, he likes playing as Toad, personally, but he only picks Toad when he actually wants to win) is being completely abused by Peter’s Princess Peach, much to the boy’s sheer delight, if the screams of joy are anything to go off of, flicking glances over at Tony intermittently.
He’d thought up these scenarios, ideas of how he could’ve saved them if he had been there, because Mom didn’t know how to drive, so he pictured himself leaping to the rescue when Dad clenches at his chest and lets go of the wheel, veering them out of the way in time to avoid hitting that tree. Fantasies of how he could’ve saved them both, how he could’ve still had his mother’s kind words and his father’s constant pushing, fantasies now being ripped to shreds right in front of him because they could’ve never been true; there would’ve been no saving either of them because he would’ve just been killed with them instead, and in that moment, all he can think is how much he’d preferred that to knowing that the story he’s believed for over twenty years has been a complete and utter
“They love him so much, and they can give him what he needs, Steve,” Tony says, but he’s no longer saying it to Steve, not really, he’s saying it to himself now, “And they’re the best thing for him. They’re his actual family, Steve, and they’ve wanted to find him for so long, and I did the looking with the belief that there were people out there who’ve wanted to find him, and he deserves to know that there’s been people who’ve loved him this much all this time, Steve—”
, the one he destroyed with a piece of 3-foot steel tube stock his dad had left lying around the workshop while working on another fucking gun.
,” he says, and Steve has to withhold the wince he feels because, while he’s finally officially left the realm of ‘Mr. Rogers,’ he’s only made it to being singularly known as ‘Steve,’ which is a start, admittedly, but not where he wants to be, “Tony loves you so
Tony wrinkles his brow. “Six weeks, give or take. Do normal people wait that long to have sex?” he asks.
“JARVIS had a hard time pulling up any results because most of information contained in the files of Peter’s parents are redacted,” Tony informs him, not waiting to see if Steve’s truly up to speed yet, “And then even more because he had literally millions of people to search through. It’s kind of just luck that JARVIS pulled anything.” Tony dips into his pocket, pulling out a folded up piece of paper. “2003, a Benjamin Parker filed Peter as a missing person with the police department. Someone—SHIELD, I’m betting—got that pushed far in the back burner. But not far enough for JARVIS, because he found the documents.” Tony opens the page, revealing the missing person’s flier with a toothy baby boy with eyes far too familiar. “They started looking for Peter before they looked for his father or mother.”
, right?” he asks, smiling now, but it’s not the smile Steve loves, it’s the fake one he uses to mask the hurt, the ugly one that threatens to stab Steve right through the chest, “Because they’re his

Oddly enough, Tony doesn’t actually seem to mind. He doesn’t repeat the inquiry; he merely lets Steve finish. Later, Steve would feel guilty, but for this moment, Steve just wants to finish a song he hasn’t heard since the thirties.
want Steve in his bedroom? Steve’s a walking, talking embodiment of almost ridiculously unbelievable bounds of sheer and utter perfection practically not meant for the eyes of mere mortal beings, and for some strange reason, the guy seems content to be with someone like Tony, and while Tony himself may not
, probably because it’s titled as episode four but Peter adamantly refuses to let him watch the numerically first three because apparently,
It’s stunning, how much he is at juxtaposition in comparison to his attitude towards Tony a little over a year ago. There was a time he wouldn’t even let lick Tony Stark lick the dirt off the bottom of his shoes, and now he just wanted to make Tony as happy as he can make him with what little resources he has to give. The thought makes him want to wince, to be honest—he can’t fathom that there was a time that he hated Tony, especially when he’d hated him for really no valid reason whatsoever. He’d let himself make face glance opinions at a man far too complex for the surface value, and, worse yet, he’d dared to compare him to a man who, as Steve would come to find out, didn’t turn out to be the man he’d known in the war.
Steve trembles under the weight of the praise, making the idea of a praise kink all the more real as he jerks his hips in time with Tony’s, mumbling damn near unintelligible words of sheer adoration for Tony as he’s fucked. Tony sucks harshly at Steve’s shoulder, knowing he’s none too far away from losing it and wanting to mark him before he does, fully aware that the mark would be gone far before his own disappear. He manages to leave a reasonably sized, and easy enough to hide, hickey before he loses it, biting
It isn’t all too often, thankfully, that Tony is called away for business, but it’s often enough that Clint can identify the pattern with an almost laughable swiftness, already creating for himself a photo album on JARVIS’s system, leaving it open so that all could enjoy the so-called beauty of it all. Within the first week of it being in the system, Tony has already downloaded all of the images. Saved them for later blackmail, he claims, but Steve catches a flash of a little picture of Peter burrowed into a blanket burrito on Captain America’s lap as his phone background and he knows the unspoken truth that Tony’s none too inclined to share.
As soon as the bag touches down on the countertop, it seems his team begins to arise from the dead, the first of whom being Natasha, who’s dressed down in one of Clint’s purple t-shirts and a pair of boxers he assumes to be Bruce’s, shuffling across the floor like an inordinately graceful zombie, smiling sleepily at Steve as she quietly takes a paper cup of coffee for herself, helping herself to a glazed doughnut before she makes her way over to the couch, affectionately tousling Tony’s wet hair before sitting down next to him in the only free space left on the sofa. Tony mutters some kind of greeting at her, too focused on his work, whilst Natasha has JARVIS begin to do a scan for any sort of security discrepancies for the night before, overly cautious even in her half-awake state. Bruce follows none too long after, already dressed and in a lab coat, leading Steve to safely presume that he hadn’t been asleep, either, grabbing for himself a plain doughnut and the one cup of tea that Steve grabbed before heading back to his lab, greeting Tony on his way. Again, Tony only grunts.
Peter’s eyes flash a bit before flattening out. “Took off when I touched down,” he responds, beginning to gather Tony up into a more dignified form, “Was apparently waiting for someone to come pick you up, like the cowardly asshole he is.”
Steve sighs now himself. “What brought this up, Peter?” he asks, “Why is this what we’re talking about?” It’s all kind of out of left field, at least to Steve. There’s no rhyme or reason for this to be current conversation—it had no precursor, no build-up into the discussion. There’s something being left unsaid, Steve knows it—and, honestly? It’s a little bit worrying.
(Steve’s brow wrinkles enough for Peter to automatically request JARVIS to add Harry Potter to their ever-increasing list.)
,” he gasps out, watching Steve tilt his head back and laugh, pushing off the edge of the unnecessarily large bathtub that Pepper had insisted she had as penance for her troubles, wrapping his arms around Tony’s trim waist and burrowing his face into Tony’s neck. Tony feels the cheeky grin that arises when he pretends to struggle against Steve’s hold, which is more for show than anything else, really, because while Steve’s got that whole inhumanly enhanced strength thing going for him, the hold is so loose that Tony doesn’t have to put in any effort at all, really, to get away.
“Which one?” Tony asks, “Iron Jackass or War Machine Badass?” Rhodey doesn’t dignify it with a response—simply narrowed eyes and a dangerously uttered
“Good,” Tony says, probably going back to his work, “Because that’s not something you should be holding out for. Anything you want to happen between Steve and I probably doesn’t exist in the realm of possibility.” That statement kind of hurts, Steve has to admit, but not as much as what Tony says next: “Not that he’s even interested in someone like
Tony’s not really a fan of Steve’s driving style, as, despite popular belief, Steve isn’t all too keen on following local traffic laws, least of all ones that prohibited how fast he could go on your standard block, and so Tony drives, Steve finding himself in the shotgun seat of a severely uncharacteristic and safety-rated Honda Civic rather than one of Tony's flashy sports cars, because it is, after all, far safer for Peter than one of his beautiful babies. Tony’s not exactly the epitome of a safe driver, either, but he does tend to pay far more attention to the lights than Steve does. Still, it only takes them slightly longer to get out to Queens than it would if Steve drives, and Steve doesn’t complain. He wouldn’t even if it had taken forever, though, because Tony only grows more and more nervous as the drive goes on.
There’s something unspoken, and Steve is almost afraid of what it is, because he’s got the feeling that he knows exactly what Tony’s avoiding saying, but he doesn’t get the chance to contemplate any of it, because Natasha shouts his name suddenly, and he turns just in time to see the news stations airing the image of a helicopter racing towards Tony’s Malibu house, the Malibu house he’s
The conversation is all but forgotten within the next few days, Tony and Steve both returning to their regular banter as the inhabitants of the tower resume with their daily lives. Tony goes back to spending eighty percent of his time in the lab, the other twenty percent almost entirely utilized in his role as Peter’s slightly abnormal role model. Sometimes, ten percent of the time is used for situations demanding the attentions of the Iron Man, but that’s not every day, maybe only a couple of times a week. Even less time is designated towards S.I duties, which is only atypical; he put Pepper in that spot for a reason, after all. A month passes, and Steve’s pretty much forgotten the conversation he had with Tony—even more so, the conversation with Peter.
“They’ll hurt others,” Tony says, “Maybe next time, it’ll be Natasha. Or Rhodey. Or Pepper. Or Clint. Bruce.
Tony checks in with them throughout the week, through call and text alike, video chatting Peter once on Thursday before passing out mid-call due to utter exhaustion, as they find out that Tony hasn’t slept in four days and, in a last-ditch effort, Happy’s laced sleeping pills into his dinner that night. Peter takes many screenshots of Tony’s sleeping-and-drooling face so that way he can scribble on it in the paint application on his tablet, giggling all the while and sending off the pictures as he finishes them to a group chat that includes Clint, Natasha, Bruce, Rhodey and, of course, Steve.
about when he spoke: fantasies rampant of Tony draping himself over Steve, his lips dragging across Steve’s throat—fantasies that he does his best to clamp down off as so not to risk allowing himself to get swept up in them, because he feels as if the ground’s going to drop out from underneath his body and leave him to tumble to the ground stories below, he’s so nervous, and he has to force himself to look away from Tony’s eyes, which he tells himself he’s only imagined were only rimmed with a slight edge of blue due to blown-out pupils, his thick lashes only adding to the allusion of arousal Steve thinks he’s made himself see in Tony’s eyes.
, which is the third movie of the day. He allows Peter to shoot him small glares all throughout dinner, during which they take a break from movie watching to tend to their headaches and their hunger, pizza boxes crafting a makeshift wall between the pair of them. He even willingly allows the ‘accidental’ kick Peter delivers to his ankle while Steve tends to the dishes afterwards.
Tony sighs now, smile near gone. “Yeah, it is, because it was a fucking stupid thing to be stressed about, Steve, you’ve got no idea. Still is.”
It’s quite common for him, when he’s drawing, to lose focus so much that he forgets to pay attention to his surroundings, so while it’s not entirely shocking that when he looks up and finds that both Clint and Natasha have entered his suite, he can’t help but be surprised regardless. Clint looks at him with a supremely unimpressed look on his face, having begun to help himself to the scant items Steve had in his fridge—like the half-pint of rocky road he’s been trying to save, he notices with a flare of annoyance—and taking possession of the seat immediately across from him at the kitchen table. Natasha has a similar look upon her face, though it’s slightly harder to discern because her face atypically looks this way, sitting atop the mahogany countertop and kicking her feet lazily against the cabinet doors.
They sit in the living room of Tony’s flat, Peter sleeping just down the hall, the television off and phones tucked away so they can have the talk that Steve desired. Steve spends most of his time in this flat, verging on just simply moving in due to the ease it would provide on their lives, since the only time they’re separate anymore is when Steve goes back to his floor to sleep and wash up only to return back to here. Some of his drawings have begun to migrate into the space, populating a few frames around the apartment, and the first time Steve saw one, he nearly choked Tony out with the hug he gave him. It was kind of funny, only because Steve actually hates seeing his own art but appreciated it so much that Tony found enough importance in them to hang them up, and every time he sees one he both grimaces and smiles.
Also, I'm basing my Tony off of comicverse Tony so just imagine RDJ with blue eyes instead of brown and we're all set because he's still going to be a midget as opposed to his true over-6-foot self (I don't want to remove all the midget jokes that are possible as Peter grows up)
Tony blinks a bit, owlishly, before humor returns to his eyes, and he asks if he’s not pretty enough as is. His hair isn’t all too long, not nearly Bruce’s shaggy length but somehow Clint managed a nice French braid with a ribbon of unknown origins laced through.
” He sounds angry when he responds, which makes Tony flinch, so when he speaks next, he’s audibly trying to sound calmer. “I was doing the same thing to you, Tony, don’t you see that? I was doing the
older than Peter because his body is still convinced he’s only just entering his thirties)—but he’s not upset about it, to be completely honest. When he really, truly thinks about it, he knows he hasn’t really hidden his desires for Tony: he just denied them, for his own sake, for fear that admitting he’s in love with Tony would cement the inevitability of losing him.
, because Peter’s crying so hard right now, the tears turning to ice upon his cheeks, “You should’ve had
Steve’s singing to him again, he’s dimly aware, but he doesn’t want to hear the song; he just wants to scream until his lungs give out, but his voice doesn’t seem to want to work. It’s broken, just like the rest of him is, like he always is, and it’s just his lot in life, isn’t it, to be the one who has to take the beating, who’s not allowed even to keep the solace of his own mother’s death. It’s broken, he’s broken, and he just keeps breaking into smaller and smaller little bits of himself with every breath he dares to take
It’s none too long until the two men stir the boy awake, because while they don’t have to be concerned about the time for themselves, they come to a quick remembrance that it’s still weekday. Tony’s not looking to have Peter miss any days of school if he can help it, so he ignores Peter’s cries of argument, all but dropping the boy into the shower that Steve gets started for him on his way to get him ready with a quick breakfast of some sort, which becomes instant oatmeal with raisins and honey, Steve combing Peter’s wet hair for him as he eats, earning the complaintive reminder of Peter’s age all the while, despite the fact that he’s not only put his t-shirt on inside-out, but also backwards. Peter tries to insist that he doesn’t
“Doesn’t seem that way,” Peter murmurs under his breath, but Steve—with his super-soldier hearing—he hears it regardless.
as he manages to work his [crisp, bright, sparkling white] t-shirt over his head, revealing the muscle structure that Tony already knows to exist but can’t stop the inclination to run his mouth over, his lips tracing a course down Steve’s jaw and the chiseled-out lines of his neck, leaving a small trail of saliva as he gently bites at the surprisingly supple skin.
Tony smirks, not looking away from Peter. “Thanks, Steve,” he whispers sincerely, barely loud enough for a normal person to hear him, but thanks to Steve’s enhanced hearing, it comes loud and clear.
Blissed out, he allows a rare silence to come over him, losing his focus in Steve’s soft humming and the lazily tracing finger he has drafting a mystery image across his stomach, staring up at the ceiling as he tries to regain some sort of semblance of his normal self. What’s just occurred is a moment that he’s never really hoped enough would happen, and his fantasies had nothing on the reality of it all. He wasn’t as ready for it as he’d thought he’d be, and yet, he can’t imagine it have going any better than it had—it’s a moment that he wants nothing more than some sort of image to remember, because his mind is great for remembering plans and blueprints, but not so much for these few, fleeting moments of complete and utter happiness.
“Somebody had to after you decided to be a selfish jerk,” Steve responds with a snap. He’s trying to use the anger he barely feels to keep Tony at arm’s length. It’s the only thing he can do to keep his feelings for Tony from forcing him into making another mistake.
It’s Gaelic, and Steve knows the meaning behind every word. His Ma had made sure to teach him before he’d even really learned English, and he’d never gotten to practice with anyone but her. He’d taught Bucky a few words, but he’d only gotten passable enough to catch the gist of when Steve was insulting him, and he’s never taught anyone else, even if Dum-Dum did ask persistently about it. He hasn’t even spoken a lick of it since the war, it means far too much of a life that’s getting further and further from his grasp every passing day.
“I will admit the situation could’ve been better handled, yes,” he acquiesces as his anger visibly builds, “But at least I didn’t take down an entire espionage organization and put millions out of jobs and cost the government billions in damages.” He crosses his arms. “I didn’t see you jumping to call the team then, Steve.”
Clint nods. “Sounded that way.” He shrugs. “But we’re not talking about our intrusion of privacy right now, Steve. I’m more curious about where you get off being such a goddamn prick.”
, he can’t do it, so as afraid as he is, he tells Peter what he knows now to be the truth. Peter lets out a little gasp of breath, and Steve looks away, ashamed and afraid, because now he’s opened himself up for more pain, because now he’s lost Tony, now that he’s admitted what he means to him—now he’s going to lose Peter, too, isn’t he, because that’s what happens, he loses the people he cares about the most, and he can’t afford to lose Peter, not Peter too, it’s not right, he can’t—
it, and it’s as terrifying as it is thrilling. No one’s ever looked at him like this before in his life, not the way Steve does, with so much adoration and reverence, and in that moment, Tony’s not sure if there’s actually a world beyond this oversized bed now, with his two most treasured people close.
The cold is getting sharper now. More poignant. Nobody will find him in time, he knows: without the arc reactor functioning, FRIDAY would’ve already stopped sending his location. By the time someone gets here, he’ll already freeze over, he’ll already find himself finally walking into the embrace of death, and he finds himself kind of laughing about it, despite the agony, because he’s avoided death for so long, despite wanting it for a while back there, and here it came, courtesy of Captain America, his childhood hero. He had memories of cuddling with a Captain America bear—hand-stitched by his Mom—believing with that childish desperation that it would keep him safe from evil, that his hero would never, ever,
And Tony just can’t help the fact that he kind of wants to punch Rhodey, but it’s probably because he knows that the man’s right, though he himself has no idea how to properly go about communicating his wants and desires, considering he’s been taught all his life that what he wants wasn’t of great importance. Whatever Steve wanted to discuss, he’s realizing, he’s going to need to be able to communicate what he wants in return, or what he wants at all, because he’s fully aware that he’s not doing it currently.
Peter doesn’t spend a lot of time talking for the first two days, and Steve doesn’t exactly blame him, as he’s not entirely sure how to begin a conversation about any of what’s happened, least of all to a child, so he doesn’t push Peter. For the first two days, the two move about in a virtually wordless dance with each other, eating together, watching television together, playing together, but neither daring to converse with the other, and he’s entirely aware that, at his age, he should be pushing Peter to talk through this, but he doesn’t know how to do it when he doesn’t know where Peter is yet, emotionally, through his process of grief, and he doesn’t know how to push him to talk about it all.
They end up in Tony’s bed. It’s the first time, since that night on the couch, that they sleep side by side, and it’s the first time ever that it’s in a bedroom. As far as Tony knows, Steve hasn’t seen as so much as an inch of the room, which is almost sterile in its order and cleanliness, so the first thing he notes on is how much it’s in an apparently dire need of at least one photo on the wall. Tony wakes up covered in blankets he hadn’t even been aware he possessed, including one of a more human variety in the form of a Peter draped over him. It’s a bit concerning, only because standardly, Tony’s not the heaviest of sleepers, and Peter’s not the lightest of children, but somehow the boy managed not to disturb his sleep and cuddle the crap out of him with his octopus-esque tendencies.
“Do it and you’re paying the cleaning bill, Rogers, and trust me, I’m not one of them cheap broads.”
—and he’s noticed that the more he cares about them, the worse he loses them, that’s why he had to watch is Ma wither away, why he’s got to deal with losing Peggy still; why he has to suffer with the knowledge that he’s the reason that Bucky has suffered through the past seventy years, and it
“It’s not a problem, Tony,” Steve says with a shake of his hand, “I like having Peter over. It’s nice.” Tony arches a brow, seemingly incredulous. “Really,” Steve insists, “I like it when Peter sleeps over. I like having the company around.”
Steve still looks awkward and uncertain as he says, “Tony,” but the man in question is more concerned with the lack of movement that the other gives in his direction, so he takes the lead, walking towards the statue-imitating Steve Rogers with determination in his stride, pulling the [over worn, hole-ridden, pit-stained, formerly white] t-shirt off over his head, tossing it carelessly to the side, greedily drinking in the look Steve gives him in response, which, despite the worry they still hold, speak of how he’s going to
Peter’s not all too willing to let go of him after that, forcing Steve to keep him against himself when he moves upright, because while he just wants to focus on the pain he shares currently with Peter, he can’t, how can he—he’s needed now, Captain America is needed now, because the Avengers need a game plan now that the extraction idea is shot to shit. He sends Natasha off to follow the grapevine that’ll lead to the identity and location of this Mandarin, whilst he sends Clint and Bruce off to Malibu after receiving a call from Pepper, who makes contact what Steve doesn’t realize is nearly two hours later. She personally sends in a Stark Industries PR personnel in order to talk to Steve about the next public move following these attacks, about what the Avengers are going to say—about what Steve is going to say, because, after all, he’s what the public have attributed to being the leaders of the Avengers.
Clint shrugs. “He asked Nat an’ me a couple of days ago. Asked us for advice,” he says in way of answering indirectly, “We didn’t exactly convince him to the contrary.”
“I love you,” he says in a shaky voice, “And I need you to come home. So listen to Pepper and get out of there before the situation gets worse. I need you here. Peter needs you here. Please, just listen to Pepper. Get packed.
Tony’s eyes go wide, so wide that the man himself is sure they’re going to pop right out of his head. “Fuck,” he whispers softly, “It’s like you’ve seen my dream journal.”
He slams a hand against the table’s surface, and Steve can’t help the flinch, nor can he help the anger rising hot in his throat, because it’s becoming abundantly clear that, while Natasha’s seemed to give Clint a few of the details, she hasn’t given him the full story—probably to stay within the stipulations of the promise she’d made to Steve when they’d learned about what Hydra had made Bucky do—and it’s even clearer that, without these details, Clint can’t possibly understand what he’s asking of him. Protect Tony and Bucky—his love and his brother—or lose them both.
Steve doesn’t look up, but he knows Tony’s grinning based off the way he says, “Still Doctor Stark, though.”
Tony shrugs. “I think I’ve grieved enough for a couple of years,” Tony says slowly, considering his words carefully as not to give Steve the wrong idea about his state of mind, “I’m too tired to think about any of it right now, to be honest.”
Steve immediately closes his mouth, his mind stuttering a step before rushing to understand what Tony’s just said, because that can’t be right—if this is Peter’s family, right here in Queens with Peter, then how could it be possible that Peter’s in the system? How can they not have found each other by now? But then Steve remembers—Parker’s a common last name. And this is not a small city. It’s not a village or a town. It’s practically its own little planet, made up of five distinct and vast microcosms filled to the brim with such a variety of people that anyone can get lost.
“I get that, but even a poster would be nice,” Tony responds, “And you could’ve painted if you wanted. It’s damned near surgical in here with all the white.” He turns the pixelated black-and-white of an assumed Winter Soldier sighting in the Ukraine, smudging the paper with his dirtied fingertips. “I feel like I should be scrubbed in.”
“Every time I think I know you’re a good person, Stark,” Steve grinds out, unable to withhold the utter
Tony, of being forced to lose you. You mean so much to me, even more than what you meant to me just a few weeks ago, and every day the idea of you getting hurt because of
Tony frowns, “I’ve never heard anyone tell me that and have it end positively, Rhodey. It’s got to be bad. I did something, I know it.”
Clint’s look is serious as he takes a bite of his stolen apple before saying, through un-chewed, saliva-sodden chunks of fruit, that he’ll look into it, which is more than enough to soothe nerves that Steve hadn’t even realized are frayed.
at the praise, his cock leaking onto his stomach (and, admittedly, the idea that Steve might have a praise kink is threatening to wreck his patience and makes him just want to take him before he’s ready). Tony kisses at the inside of Steve’s thigh as he works, slowly stretching and torturing the other man, watching him come more and more unraveled as he does frustrated, his hips moving to match Tony’s motions. By this point, Tony knows he’s more than ready, stretching him still with more than four fingers, but he’s fascinated by the wanton expression Steve has on his face; the tightly clenched jaw and the blown-out pupils, so much so that he’s actually kind of surprised when Steve cries out suddenly, his cock dribbling with his release, his body shaking with an apparent weight of the orgasm that hits him.
Steve can’t help but laugh. There was a time in their relationship when Peter couldn’t even make eye contact with any one of them, least of all Steve, out of shyness and reservation and the slightest bit of hero-worship, but that was pretty much entirely eradicated probably the first time he saw Clint naked (the archer tended to treat the entirety of the tower like his house, other than the singular floor he was gifted, so it wasn’t exactly unheard of to spot a nude Clint just sitting on the couch eating a bowl of strawberries, for example). Seeing them in their natural habitat tended to humble the opinions of people, Steve could expect.
to say a word, Peter’s groaning, unwrapping himself from his current state in his blanket cocoon, diving for the remote they’ve left atop the coffee table, hitting pause on the movie. He sits up, rewrapping the blanket around his body as he glares at Steve, like the man has done something wrong, which as far as the man in question knows, he hasn’t—right?
when he finds out about the atrocity and begs for its immediate removal. Rhodey, understandably, and very politely, refuses.)
Peter finally looks at him. “I know,” he says, his voice shaky despite the decisive nature of the statement, “You’re just a selfish prick.”
He stares for a moment before sighing. “We’re going to have to work on your self-esteem issues, because they are
His fight gradually breaks down as he grows tired, as the intensity of his emotions tapers off, leaving him exhausted and malleable, quietly begging to be let go, his face pressed against Steve’s oversized chest, his arms limp at his sides. His entire body is cradled into Steve’s lap, their legs tangled together, Steve’s arms wrapped like steel bonds around his torso. The man holds him so tight he’s barely able to breathe, but other than the begging, Tony can’t make him release him whatsoever. He feels far too heavy, and far too cold, to put up any really fight, which he knows instinctively that, without his suit, would be a pointless venture anyways in the face of Steve’s ridiculous stubborn nature, which apparently acts against what’s good for him.
Which is why, the moment Clint lands eyes on Tony about week or two after the panic attack and he’s grinning ear to ear without a Peter in sight, he immediately declares the night to be Mexican Madness Medley Monday (M to the Fourth, it’s officially dubbed later), breaks out the tequila, cues up shitty horror movies and forces Bruce to help him make what he deems to be ‘necessary’ foods for the night ahead—nachos, taquitos, chimichangas, burritos, empanadas, namely—and has everyone take a shot (everyone except Tony and Bruce, the former because he’s a recovering alcoholic and the latter because drinking hard liquor wasn’t exactly an idea he encouraged, what with his constant tagalong) to get the night rolling.
fault, he knows it without question, and it’s just not right that others suffer because he wants to love Tony. He’s made a mistake in admitting it, but he wants to fix it. For his own sakes and for the others around him.
It begun succinctly, right under all their noses, but at some point along the line, Steve had found that whenever Tony left the tower on any sort of extended trip, Peter would turn up at his door, armed with a pillow, some bad movie from the previous thirty years and a thick comforter wrapped around his shoulders with an increasingly overly familiar look of expectation upon his overly adorable face, and would then take it upon himself to stay for as long as he desired to—typically, until the moment he got notice that Tony was back within a two-mile radius. He would stay, force Steve to make spaghetti and watch as many corny films as he can force JARVIS to follow up the DVD he brings, wrangle him into the parent-like duties Tony is forced to leave behind every single time business calls for him.
Peter stares at him for a second before he shrugs, turning back towards the movie. “I mean, I always get this feeling when you’re around him, but I just wasn’t sure, and Tony’s always encouraging me to ask as many questions as I can until I’m sure about things, so…” Peter bites his lip. “Am I wrong?”
Tony’s smile turns anxious with the drop of a hat, and he looks at him with something akin to agony in his eyes.
It’s getting increasingly rarer and rarer to find Tony on a good day, much less one that Peter’s not around for, because it’s usually for Peter that Tony pushes aside his responsibilities to focus on his favorite one, and Steve’s afraid to say anything about the hiccups in the process in front of Peter, for fear that he’s not actually aware of the difficulties Tony’s encountering, which is entirely too within the realms of possibility for Steve’s comfort but, as there’s not much he can do about it, he doesn’t allow himself the luxury of thinking about it. Peter comes around often enough that they do get to see him legitimately happy for even just a little bit, which is more than they can ask for—it’s worthy of celebration when it’s not a direct result of Peter’s presence.
Tony’s quiet when Steve’s done, which is only worrying because he’s unused to the highly unfamiliar prospect of a quiet Tony, so Steve reluctantly lets him go, releasing his arms and moving back a good few feet to give the man space if he wants it. Tony stays still, slightly curled on himself, head down so Steve can’t see his face, his breath still heavy, but far less than before. Steve stares at the back of Tony’s neck before he sighs, getting to his feet. When he’s upright, JARVIS informs him that Bruce had come in about seven minutes ago, and awaits them on the communal floor with Clint, and Steve can’t help but smile, because Bruce must be all types of antsy, and so would Clint, and Clint’s type of antsy tends to get other people really annoyed, even the zen-like Bruce types. Steve knows he shouldn’t be amused, but all things considered, he just can’t help it. Any little thing is a peace right now.
Steve is privy to updates from his team members, but he makes it clear early on; he can’t join on this mission. It’s not that he doesn’t want to—it’s because he can’t bear the idea of leaving Peter alone at this time. Peter’s so fragile, so on the edge that Steve’s honestly afraid of leaving Peter alone, and all he wants to do at that very moment is shelter Peter from the entire rest of the world. So he does his best to—he allows Peter to hide in his suite, keeping him close and distracted at every possible moment, putting on various movies and TV shows and playing video games and teaching him chess; anything he can think of, and Peter’s just receptive enough for this to even work. Steve’s just happy he doesn’t cry every waking moment of the day, that he can even smile for just a hint of time, and it’s pretty much all he can ask for.
They don’t talk about what happened that day. Tony obviously doesn’t want to, and Steve doesn’t desire to push him, and so he doesn’t. He gets him fed, talks with him, eventually manages to coerce him into going with him to assure Bruce that the hour and a half he spent dealing with Clint’s rapid-fire chatter isn’t for nothing, but not at any singular point does Steve actually push Tony into talking about it. Steve minds, but he doesn’t allow himself to push Tony, no matter how badly he actually wants to, even if it’s what Tony needs him to do for him.
Tony meets him halfway, and Steve knows that he may not have the most experiences in kissing, but he knows that this kiss blows any others he’s ever had out of the goddamn water and, in fact, if it’s the last kiss he’d ever have before he died, then he’d have died a happy man, but then Tony tilts his head just a

“So, Cap, I just wanted to say, ‘cause I never did,” Tony says after they laugh for a bit, smiling still but visibly cautious, “Thanks.”
Steve sits next to him all throughout the dinner, smiling and laughing like nothing’s wrong, and so Tony does his best to follow suit, laughing even though he kind of wants throw up, he’s so nervous and anxious about the idea of having a ‘talk’ with Steve. He’s trembling and sweating and he can’t bring himself to take a bite to eat, which Steve doesn’t seem to notice even with his arm around Tony’s shoulders, warm and heavy and safe and threatening. He’s still convinced that Rhodey’s kind of wrong in a small way, that there’s something he’s done wrong that’s a big deal, and that Steve is just going to leave him for someone more fitting of a person like him: perfect and unbroken like Tony himself isn’t.
“The internet doesn’t know Tony as well as it thinks it does,” Bruce reminds him with a more than slightly sardonic smirk, “As much as it wishes to.” He visibly tightens something, and he straightens slightly, looking more than slightly pleased with himself before looking over at Steve contemplatively. “I didn’t tell you how impressed I am with how you handled things Tuesday. You did really well, Steve.”
signs of obvious emotional distress due to his finding the situation to be too amusing not to enjoy, but that doesn’t mean to say that he doesn’t see it whatsoever. He looks carefully at Clint, trying to gauge if Clint’s withholding information, if he knows what’s bothering Peter, perhaps, but Clint’s blue eyes are clear and open for him to read. Clint’s not hiding anything; he genuinely doesn’t know what’s bothering Peter. Wouldn’t have known, if Steve hadn’t said anything.
Dimly, he realizes that he can only be thankful that Peter’s not around to see this. Knowing what he does of the boy, Steve knows that Peter would see this as his own fault, and if there’s one thing Tony does not need to happen when he’s in such a state, it’s knowing he’s the cause for Peter’s guilt.
, and Tony’s got no idea of what he’s doing to Steve, or at least doesn’t care, because he comes closer, repeating it like a mantra,
. All he can do is shift so that Peter’s cradled into his chest, arms tight around Peter’s shaking body, and bury his face in the bed of messy brown locks and take in all the pain Peter has to give him, all the pain that Peter doesn’t deserve to feel.
Just like the title says: it's just the calm before the storm. The time for Steve to bring close those he loves the most is beginning.
Steve can’t help but chuckle. “You had two slices and you were complaining about being full halfway through the second.”
And, because in his heart of hearts he’s in fact a selfish creature, Steve stays away in order to protect himself. He all but runs out the room when Tony walks in, keeps any conversations he’s forced to have with him brief and on topic—he doesn’t even allow himself the luxury of
(That doesn’t mean to say that he isn’t at all, though—he’s just also aware that Tony can hold his own if need be, even if it’s against just some stalker with a Twitter account.)
Steve hadn’t been aware how much he’s missed this. Every so often, he flicks little glances over at Peter, and he can’t help the flush of warmth that floods through his body. It’s similar to the brotherly bond he feels with his lost friend, but, at the same time, it’s entirely unfamiliar, though not unbidden. Though Steve doesn’t quite understand the feeling, he’s not quite willing to let it go, either. So he just doesn’t try to think about it, he instead just basks in the feeling, watching Peter as the boy laughs at Donkey’s ridiculous speech.
allow him to be hurt, and yet here he was, injured by the very man he had praised for years, left alone to rot while the love of his life walked away in the embrace of the man who’d stolen that of his mother and father’s.
“I’m just curious,” Peter responds cryptically, “Really just curious. Would you date him, by any chance?”
As Steve hadn’t been in the right frame of mind when he’d said it, he doesn’t quite recall it in whole detail, but he knows exactly what Peter’s talking about, and he’s surprised because he realizes what the answer is, and it nearly rocks him to his core, because it’s along the lines of “I think of you as my son, too” and it hurts to even think that it’s what he wants to say because it’s just not his place to say anything of the sort; Peter’s not his kid, no matter how he feels that he is.
Peter’s face is buried into the crook of his neck, so he feels more than sees the drool puddle the boy’s leaving on his collarbone, which isn’t so much gross as it is endearing, which he hopes is just par for the parenting course, his hair tickling at Tony’s jaw and ear. His fingers clench tightly at Tony’s arm and torso, as if he’s trying to hold on for dear life, which he figures isn’t all too inaccurate; his legs on either side of Tony’s thighs, ankles clasped together underneath his shins. He’s wrapped them both up in the old blanket he stole, and if he’s being entirely honest, smelling it kind of hurts because the whole point of him taking it from the old estate was to be able to smell the tobacco and vanilla that seems to be embedded still into its fibers after all these years, now mingling in with the ever-present scent of the cheap orange-scented bargain soap from the dollar store by Peter’s school, a pleasant but annoying scent as it’s a source of frustration for him, because Peter still insists upon using despite the fact that Tony can afford a product that doesn’t give his kid the occasional rash.
Tony grimaces. “He’s a bit overmuch,” he confesses, “His heart’s in the right place, though. He’s just got major mother-hen tendencies sometimes.”
The next day is significantly lessened in its tension, marked by the image of a sleepy Peter still in his pajamas from the day before shuffling into Steve’s kitchen in search for food, which Steve provides by handing him a plate of eggs and fried bologna, which the boy makes a point of turning his nose up at but eats nonetheless with a notably excited vigor. They don’t spend the entire day together—at some point, Peter disappears downstairs to work on a project—but by six, they’re baking ziti and settling in for another movie, Peter having procured another set of pajamas to wear, wrapped up nice and tight in his blanket, smiling wide despite having been wanting to decapitate Steve only a few hours previous.
In annexation to avoiding Tony, Steve sees far less of Peter than he’s truly comfortable with, the boy having become a virtual staple in Steve’s day-to-day routine, but as Peter and Tony come as a sort of pre-packaged deal, Steve sees no other choice than to avoid Peter, too, and the pain he feels compounds. Steve really doesn’t notice how important Peter is to his life until Peter’s spot becomes an empty one. If he sees Peter approaching, he’ll typically take an alternative route. If he sees Peter simply resting in the communal area, then he’ll backtrack and go out for a run.
, it’s wrong, it’s selfish, and it makes his hope blossom hard, and fear rise heavy in his throat, and his mind scream at him to
When Steve tells him they need to talk, Tony’s first reaction is to assume he’s messed everything up.
was supposed to go with them. They’d apparently been planning on going to dinner at their favorite restaurant to celebrate their anniversary, and since for once Tony was home for the holidays, Tony was supposed to come with, but he’d refused outright—he didn’t want to spend his holiday break with Howard any more than necessary, not wishing for the night to end in some lecture about how great he wasn’t or for his mother to wipe tomato sauce from the corner of his mouth like he was five again. His parents couldn’t reconcile that he’d grown up, just like he couldn’t reconcile that he still needed them. He’d brushed both of them off, and though Howard was a bit annoyed and his mother frustrated, they didn’t fight it. His mom even promised to bring him home some pasta and some cake—tres leches from the Spanish bakery down the street from the restaurant, specifically, because it was his absolute
, the last time being when Tony had left for three weeks just a few months after Peter’s official adoption.
“You’ll want to claw your eyes out. Now shut up, it’s big reveal time,” he says as his eyes are glued almost reverently to the screen, as if he hasn’t seen this a million times. On the screen, Luke and Vader are fighting in the sky city that Steve can’t remember the name to, and Steve’s a bit more intrigued in knowing the reveal than asking Peter what he meant.
Steve sighs, letting his head loll back to rest against the head rest of the seat, hands tightening and untightening as the unease tightens in the pit of his stomach. He wants to scream at Tony, but he also wants to beg Tony to say anything, because he’s so worried about Tony at that moment, so worried that Tony is going to have a breakdown and worried because he can’t do much to stop it if he does. The tension is fisting painfully tight around his throat, threatening to choke him out if he doesn’t push at Tony, doesn’t make the man bend and explain himself, and Steve knows it’s the soldier side in him that desires this, to make Tony follow his orders—no, actually—it’s the Captain side in him.
“I thought you were done with this,” Steve manages to groan, suddenly unable to make eye contact with a person not even a fourth of his (chronological) age, whom, based on the little giggle he lets escape his lips, is more than smug that he’s embarrassed Steve, and Steve has to resist the sudden desire to whine that rises hot up his trachea, because although this a conversation that’s entirely unsanctioned, he is still the adult of the room, and if his Ma’d ever taught him a damned thing, it’s that adults don’t whine—no matter how much said adult didn’t want to have a conversation with a preteen gung-ho about setting Steve up with his adoptive father.
It’s not because he’s the closest—in fact, if anyone’s remotely close, it’s Bruce from his place on the thirty-fifth floor to Tony’s twenty-ninth. It does have a lot to do with the fact that he ran up those twenty stories like his ass was on fire, taking as many steps at one time as he feasibly can, heart attempting at that very moment to come ripping out of Steve’s chest with the fear that’s running alongside with the endorphins currently fueling his movements, his mind racing through what it could possibly be to set Tony off in such a way. His heart’s beating so fast that all he can hear is the beat itself, and he can barely register the steps before him as he sprints up them, and all he can do is worry about Tony.
Steve to hate him, he realizes now, because if he really thinks about it, Steve’s looked at him this way damn near close to every day, though usually he’s not as blatant about it. For every day for these past two months or so, Steve’s put the two of them—Tony and Peter—before everything else, showing them more devotion and care than Tony really thought himself deserving of. This look is nothing new—in fact, if he digs deeper, this look stretches
), but he figures that he knew what he was signing up for with the former ROTC student that Rhodey was back in the day. Rhodey does his best to make sure that they don’t fall out of touch, randomly messaging him to check up, answering the video calls whenever he can, which is practically all the damn time despite how annoying Tony finds the connectivity problems that so easily can be rectified by simply a change in devices.
Tony sits himself down at the table, sitting in the only seat available, taking in the room, which Steve knows to be Spartan as he finds it hard to find the time to search for furniture and decorations. In fact, if it weren’t for the fact that Tony had the table in place before Steve had moved in, he’d just sit on the floor for his meals.
“Your dad and I are friends,” Steve says quickly, before he can consider Peter’s words too deeply, “Nothing more than friends.”
They wait until Peter passes out, which isn’t hard because Peter’s worked himself into a tizzy about the robot as the competition is within the next few weeks, so when he nearly face-plants into his hot bowl of tikka masala during the team dinner for the fourth time, Tony makes a soft suggestion to the boy that he possibly venture into going off to bed. He argues, but it’s to be expected, Tony figures, because Clint’s promised to show him how to get through Banjo-Kazooie and the old game is one of Peter’s new obsessions, but in the end, he relents, possibly because he’s been nodding off all throughout the dinner, much to the amusement to the entirety of the team, particularly Tony himself, who finds the face Peter makes when he’s about to fall asleep utterly
“I’m not going to allow anyone else to be hurt, Steve,” Tony says, “I care about all of you so much, and I’m not going to abandon my fight because you asked me to. It’s because you asked me to that I can’t.” He takes in a shaky breath before saying, “The Mandarin needs to be stood up to, and I’m the one with the power and the ability both. It’s my duty, and my choice.”
There was a good few months where Steve hadn't talked to Clint other than the professional; stubbornness, guilt and indignant anger refusing to allow himself to be friends with Clint in the wake of the ultimatum he'd delivered, which did hurt more than he's willing to admit but he also can't deny how right Clint was in everything he said that day. In fact, they're still not wholly back on the track to being the friends they were before: Clint sometimes eyes him with an air of distrust whenever he gets apparently too close to Tony for his liking, and Steve can't shake the idea that Clint would rather put an arrow through his eye than let him continue to hurt Tony with a secret that Clint himself can't really grasp the enormity of. Steve understands where Clint's coming from with his anger; Nat's explained more than enough the kind of borderline destructive relationship he used to share with his older brother Barney and the emptiness that was left in his late brother's wake, affection and care reserved entirely for Barney becoming the property of one unsuspecting Tony Stark. Steve
He shoots him a message before he searches online, typing the billionaire’s name in the search engine to yield the response he wants. Gossip mags already have things to say, not all terrible, but not all really that great, either. However, Steve expects to see the bad, and with a sort of terribly practiced ease he finds himself navigating through the gossip to find something akin to a read-out of Tony’s entire day, which creeps him out slightly because it essentially means that someone is actively
They talk for two hours. For Steve, it’s just bordering on twelve AM, but for Tony, it’s now six in the morning, which means that he’s been up since at least four AM (Steve later discovers that Tony hadn’t actually slept at all), so Steve shoos him off with apologies and threats alike, which would be counterproductive with a lesser person but works perfectly with Tony, who simply shoots back with sarcastic snips and vaguely flirtatious one-liners that has Steve blushing. It’s nothing he’s strictly unused to, however—it’s just who Tony is.
Not all those in love agree all the time. Not all those in love can move immediately pass such a big divisor, and I've made it a point to not only to stay as true as possible to canon, but as true as possible to reality. I do not push the idea of a storybook romance and I do not try to; my goal is to represent love in the real world. Neither Steve nor Tony are perfect, and I SO do not think either is in the wrong, which is the problem I have with the movie itself, but as I do try to keep it in canon; I had to write the last part as I believed Tony to feel in that moment. He will be angry, he will not understand. That's simply what he believes, in that moment, and that's all I can portray, because that's how you end the movie. But am I going as far to outright say Steve's in the wrong? No, because I don't believe he is.
Steve’s resolve, by then, is but a distant memory, chased away by the smell of engine grease and hot metal and expensive cologne that is Tony’s usual, and Steve swallows before getting to his feet before him, hand reaching out to rest on Tony’s hip. Heat slices through the fabric of Tony’s MIT t-shirt, and it’s so enticing that Steve has to place another hand upon his hips in order to fully experience it. He watches as Tony’s tongue darts out to lick at his dried lips, speaking towards some sort of dehydration, and in the back of his mind, Steve makes it a point to, at some point, Tony drinks some water before he passes out. He doesn’t think about it too much now, though, not when Tony’s looking at him with such utter desire evident in his eyes.
But he’s singing it now, no longer bothering with the pretense of humming, the words escaping his lips for the first time in over seventy years and he’s fine with sharing it as long as it’s with Tony, because knowing it’s Tony makes it feel like less of a secret needing keeping. Knowing it’s Tony makes him feel like he’s not too far displaced out of time—like he belongs here, with the team, with Tony—and it makes him feel like he belongs here, in this Tower, defending the world amongst some of the best group of individuals he’d ever been blessed enough to meet.
He has to beg Steve to stop, only because he’ll be damned if he’s going to let Steve forget about his own want, which Tony is almost worried is one-sided until he sees the outline of his cock pressing against the fabric of his pants, Steve’s legs shaky and unsteady with sudden trepidation, reminding Tony that the man is pretty damn close to virginal, in the grand scheme of things, especially in the realm of gay sex, according to him, so when Tony says,
Steve grins. He really likes it when Tony does the dad voice, mostly because Tony doesn’t even realize that he has one in the first place. The dad voice predates Peter, but its usage has only increased since Peter joined their lives, and it’s always a treat, to get to hear it.
—which is actually a movie he’s seen already, but in an odd twist of opportunity, Peter hasn’t (or just didn’t remember if he had)—focusing his attentions instead upon Peter and not on the drawing he was currently doing of the preteen, capturing the image of Peter’s enraptured face through pencil.
, and Steve has almost no time to process it before he screams Tony’s name into the receiver, ordering him to grab Pepper and get down, watching in horror for the barest moment when the rocket is fired before he drops the phone and dives for Peter, wrapping his arms around the boy and turning him bodily away from the televisions, putting himself between the screens, because the last thing Peter needs to see is this. Peter screams, hitting his arms, but it’s more out of agony than of anger, because despite the fact that he can’t see it, he knows what’s about to happen, what’s happening, because they hear the sound of the resulting explosion before one of the other heroes manage to mute the sound of the televisions, and with his enhanced hearing, Steve can hear the phone cut abruptly short, and Steve has to force himself not to collapse right then and there, because the pain he feels is
The ending of this tale, which starts happy, gets a bit weird around the middle, gets happy again, and then ends up kicking the author's ass because she can only end it the same way in any of the different iterations of the chapter she writes because this story is about love in all its different forms in the real world and she can't give it the fairy tale ending she wants because this is the real fucking world folks.
“Yeah, when it comes to Peter,” Rhodey agrees, “But that’s a different type of relationship you two share when it comes to him. Your focuses are entirely different there, just like your focuses are different when you’re Avengers. It’s all entirely different, no matter how much they overlap. With Peter, your focuses are on Peter’s needs, on Peter’s wellbeing; and when you’re out in the field, your focuses are on protecting those in the line of fire and fulfilling the mission requirements. When you two are
It’s a responsibility if there ever was one, and Steve can’t even fathom how it even begins to affect Tony. Fatherhood is a stress in and of itself; adoption another entirely its own. How Tony even manages to maintain even the very semblance of stability is far beyond the scope of Steve’s meager understandings of the situation. How Tony can continue to push forwards despite all around him trying to keep him back just astounds Steve.
Steve looks off to the side, rubbing the back of his neck. “Not sure about that. Nat told me that one of them turned out to need stitches.”
“No, I’m not,” Tony snaps at him, finally looking at Steve, anger and misery aflame in the back of his eyes, “I’m just some lonely asshole who pushed my care and love on a kid who doesn’t know any better. I’m not his father, just like he isn’t my son. He isn’t my kid, he belongs to the couple in that house over there who’ve been looking him since he was two
“You live in a day and age where you can screw anyone with only limited public backlash, Steve, and you refuse to take advantage of it. Your hard Christian morals are your downfall,” Clint tells him before asking, “But did Peter talk to you about it last night?”
Tony makes a noncommittal shrug, but he responds, “Because I knew you’d get it.” Tony flicks a glance over at him. “You get me better than Bruce does sometimes. Maybe even better than Rhodey, but we can’t tell him that.” Steve can’t help the small smile that arises. “I figured if there was anyone who was going to steer me in the right direction, it’d be you. And you did.”
“Just tell me,” Tony encourages, though he can’t fathom why he does such a thing because it’s only just going to hurt when Steve tells him that he wants out.
Which is why he almost trips up the stairs when he hears Peter asking his father what he thinks about him.
He can almost hear the shrug. “Yeah.” He says it so plainly, so matter-of-fact, that for a moment, Steve’s heart sings. He, of course, shuts it right back down, before he can even really consider the feeling. “And? Why’re you asking, anyways?”
yes), but he knows that’s not the way Steve means it, and he doesn’t need the rampant blush overtaking Steve’s cheeks to inform him of the fact.
(In the back of his mind, a conspiratorial part of him reminds him about his own secrets he keeps from the man beside him—the man he’s in love with—whispering to him how much of a coward he is compared to him.)
“Such a lie,” he says as the other three party members make their way back over to the couch, Nat holding the tres leches cake she had delivered when Clint first prosed the idea to her earlier that day, Bruce and Clint obviously on fork and plate duties. Tony croons in reaction, excited because, evidently, while he’s not a big sweets person, tres leches is the one real allowance he’ll make without social cues dictating he does, and it’s not too long until Tony is curled up on the other end of the couch with a honking slice on his plate, eyes glued on the corny mess that is
Tony’s on the communal floor when he arrives with the food, Peter’s head in his lap as the boy snoozes peacefully, his father’s fingers woven through his hair as the man’s other free hand swipes lazily on the screen of the tablet in front of him. Five news stations are struggling to speak over each other on the wall-to-wall display before Tony, alighting his face with an array of color that Steve would like nothing more than to pause this moment on so he can attempt to recreate it through use of pastel. He doesn’t notice Steve’s presence, and for that, Steve’s glad; it allows him to fully take in this moment for all it’s worth.
“What?” Tony gasps out, confused, the pull of gravity feeling a bit lighter as the lead seemingly is shaved away. He can’t have heard that; he must be dreaming. Steve pulled him here to break up with him, not to tell him this. Maybe it’s some sort of way to lessen the blow of the end of their time together? Tony shoots the idea down instantly, looking carefully at Steve’s face. The other man looks so scared, so terrified; looking at Tony as if afraid that he was going to hit him for his lies, because it can’t be the truth, can it? His dad had a heart attack. That was what he was told. Howard Stark, the great Howard Stark, the god of weapons manufacturing and science itself, died a regular death like the regular man he secretly was, a heart attack causing him to lose control of the wheel and the crash taking from Tony not only his father, but his mother too, and it was tragic but it was
Tony shrugs. “Nah. I like ‘em. Clint’s good with hair.” He looks up at Steve’s head. “You should let yours grow a bit more so you can experience it yourself.”
“That’s cool, Mr. Rogers,” Peter says before continuing, “Didya wanna see my robot? I don’t think our mentor left yet. It’s so cool! I’m gonna have the program finished by Sunday. I can’t wait to launch it! It’s gonna win for sure at the regional! Are you coming to my regional? Please tell me you’re coming to the regional—Tony, tell him he’s gotta come to the regional! It’s so cool! There’s gonna be teams from everywhere, and then the high school kids build bigger robots with a driving period rather than wholly autonomous, and that’s three days long, so I was gonna watch it, and it’s so
“You said ‘we have Peter’. To my dad.” He looks hesitant as he whispers, “What did you mean by we, Mr. Rogers?”
Steve shakes his head, still grinning in a way he knows to be utterly foolish, “If you really don’t want to see the pizza again, you should probably stop right now.”
It takes a while for them to regain their sense of order, lying side by side in the ruined remains of Tony’s sheets, covered with new rips and tears that the man is
Steve scowls (adorably, because of his blushing), “Look, I’m not as practiced as you might be, so I don’t really know what we’re supposed to do.”
doing something wrong.” Tony’s breath nearly stops dead in his chest, but before his anxiety can take over, Rhodey continues, “You have too romanticized an ideal about Steve and the way he handles things. You have this idea that Steve’s damn near infallibly perfect, and it’s unrealistic. You’d rather blame yourself than blame Steve, and that is something you two need to discuss.” He gives Tony a look. “I’ve told you this back when you were dating that stupid pedophilic meathead back in college and I’ll tell you again: relationships are a two-way street, Tones, and both parties are fully capable of creating a wrong; it’s not entirely the burden of yours to carry. You and Steve need to work on your communication skills with each other, because you’re in the same chapter, but definitely not on the same page.”
Steve laughs still, head tilting back. “I’m glad there’s no lightning to strike you were you are, Stark.”
Natasha’s quiet, but that’s not an issue because Clint seems to be more than willing to do the talking, as is apparent when he says, “Oh, nothing much—wanted your views about global warming, how the NASDAQ is fairing, how much of a fucking hypocrite you are—you know, small talk.”
