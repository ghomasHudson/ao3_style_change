They both took stalls on either side of him, yelling to each other as though there wasn't several slabs of metal in between them.
But Steve was nothing if not tenacious, and he slid his hands down Tony's arms then wrapped his own arms around Tony's waist and reiterated, "Why shouldn't I find you attractive in this body?"
Tony slapped the comb down on the dresser and turned to glare at Steve, but there was no heat behind the glare. The twist to his lips and the glimmer in his brown eyes said he was more amused by it than annoyed.
"No," Esmeralda said, her lips twisted a little in thought. "No, I chose you specifically. See, you are a fighter, but your bonded is a warrior, and there is a difference."
They broke the kiss as the car behind them sounded its horn to alert them to the change of light, and as Steve pulled the car through the intersection, Tony turned to Bruce and said, "You're going to miss us when we're gone, you know."
"There was too much evidence to the contrary. The photographs and the filmstrips and the history books."
He nodded and settled in, the duvet soft and warm and familiar around him, Steve's comforting scent permeating the swath. He ached, but the icepack felt good, and after the excitement of the last twenty-four or so hours, sleep, which he'd been robbed of for so long, finally began to overtake him, his body relaxing and his eyes drooping.
"We both...have things we need to deal with first," she finally admitted, and Tony nodded in understanding.
Cold, brutal awareness slapped Steve in the face at that. It was a coincidence, sure, but the 'sergeant' rank as well as the name — he presumed it was supposed to be the person's name — sounding an awful lot like 'Barnes.' He could only see his failures, only see Bucky falling from the train because he was too slow or too stupid or too
Whereas Steve's mother had looked serious, Tony would say that Joseph Rogers had a stern look about him — like if the Stare of Disapproval was Steve's normal look rather than something that came out when he was, well, disapproving something. Steve clearly resembled both of his parents, but it was obvious that he took after his father just a little bit more, though it was hard to tell if his father was tall or short in this photograph.
He shook his head like the rest of the thought didn't matter before he exhaled a heavy breath like a weight had finally lifted from his chest, and he rubbed both his hands over his face then looked at Tony and said quietly, almost sadly, "And maybe if he hears that from
Bruce let out a heavy sigh and said, "Steve's the kind of guy that likes to look directly at the person he's addressing."
Steve just nodded, his face taking on a sort of faux-serious contortion like he was merely humoring Tony. "Sure," he said then cupped Tony's face in his hands and stroked his thumbs over Tony's cheekbones. "If you say so, honey."
does this woman look so much like Tony Stark? Is she a long-lost sister? A cousin? Or maybe — just maybe — Tony Stark got turned into a woman against his will and
"You wish me to do something to allow the King to produce an heir," she said as they were taking their first bites of what could, at most, be called a 'stew' but was more than likely little more than 'gruel.'
"'70s soft rock, evidently," Tony said and changed the station to something less saccharine. Somehow, he must have hit some psychedelic '60s station, going by the…
Steve. The one I drove here with yesterday morning. The one that warned me about this last night after he
Wilson and Barnes and Rhodey all exchanged looks before they all shrugged their agreement and said various forms of 'Yeah.'
He dropped his arms from where he had them so tightly folded, and he put them around her and held on, and as she continued to murmur soft words in Russian to him, he let the tears fall, something achy and sad forming in his chest.
But the doctor merely laughed and said, "I'd like you to have an ultrasound. And I'd like to order some blood and urine tests just to make sure everything
But Tony didn't hear the rest — or he didn't pay attention to it — as another sharp pain hit, and he gritted his teeth again and squeezed his eyes shut and waited for the feeling to subside, tearing at the sheet a little bit as he did so.
But gather there they did, and eat all his food, and imprint their asses on his cushions and watch his television and make his AI settle all their stupidest disputes (the 'chicken and the egg' argument was probably at the top of the list of
Tony just got up off the bed, grimacing a little at the ache, and went over to the bassinette. Olivia was awake and waving her arms in the air, wiggling in the swaddle she'd somehow come loose from, and Tony scooped her up, blankets and all, and carried her over to the bed.
He glared at him, but with the way the rain water had begun to run through his hair and soak through his suit, he looked the quintessential 'drowned rat'—
"I know that sounded like a really sucky explanation, but I meant in a good way," Tony said and began to scrape cookies off the table and onto the sheet.
"Touch that to pull up some crap video about Electro the Garbage Man and you can show yourself out of my building."
"You know," Rhodey was telling Steve, "I expected more from Captain America. Maybe that's on me, but I totally expected more of you. What was all that bullshit about you loving him and not wanting to hurt him? Was that just so you could get with him? Was that just so I wouldn't kick your ass, because I'll tell you right now, I don't care if you are nine hundred years old, I am really restraining myself from kicking the shit out of you right about now."
The penthouse became, in those weeks, a revolving door of Avengers and cohorts, popping in under the guise of 'helping' when really all they wanted to do was play with and cuddle with the baby. Which wasn't the worst thing in the world. Having other people there to pick up the slack allowed Tony some much-needed time to himself — even if he, for whatever reason, couldn't stand to be away from the baby for long. And it was also funny watching the others argue over who was or would be the favorite aunt or uncle, Wilson and Barnes, no surprise, being the most vehement in their disagreements. Barton, weirdly enough, was the most at ease with a baby in his arms, cradling her and feeding her with a bottle like he was an old pro, and when Tony shot him a perplexed look one time, Barton just shrugged and said, "They train you for everything."
He shut his door and walked around the back of the car to meet up with Tony and said, "Need some help?"
"Do you think it's fair that you and Captain Rogers, two men in a same-sex relationship, should be so easily allowed to have your own biological children when most other same-sex couples that wish to have families either have to adopt or find a surrogate?"
"One of these days," he said as he got the bottle open and poured a generous helping onto his fingers, "I'm gonna gag you so you can't say a fucking word."
"Unquestionably," Steve said, either not understanding or not caring about the move Tony had telegraphed. "You turn a lot in your sleep. I think it's even gotten worse since…"
"Eh, don't worry about it. It's cable. Coaxial cable. That's how they transmit the sound and the image, anyway. Want to watch something? Think the next showing of
to get married as soon as you get knocked up, but I just… I want to marry you, and who am I kidding? I'm not getting any younger. I might be dead in five months—" Steve opened his mouth to protest that, but Tony reached out and put a hand over his mouth to stop him before he could. "And if I don't, I'm still going to spend the rest of my life with you. Why the hell not? Besides, I could use the tax break."
Without thinking, and because he hadn't actually been out in public in close to two months, he made his way over to the men's room and was just about to put his hand on the door to push through when someone beside him said, "Where do you think you're going?"
"Cool," Bucky sniffed with a snorted laugh. "Even I know what that means nowadays. I don't think you do."
Bruce took her hands, and they greeted each other in the very European tradition of a kiss on each cheek (even if the woman's accent

loved, and there was no question that this rambunctious ball of fire loved him. And it wasn't necessarily the way her eyes lit up when he walked into the room or when he cut her peanut butter and jelly sandwich up in to quarters. It was in the way she took for granted that
"Do not ever compare what I designed and created with my own two hands to that pile of vacuum tubes and scrap metal."
"Uh, it's a little coffee klatch that Steve and I didn't know about. That's pretty much the definition of a secret club."
true, he would know anything about that. I mean, since when does Barton know anything about pregnancy? Are you telling me he reads up on this shit in his spare time? I mean, that's got to be it, right? It's not from experience. There's no possible way any woman would let that asshole within ten feet of her
let him go, wouldn't they? Well, no, that wasn't the right way to phrase it. He could make a career out of this, but they wouldn't just keep him cooped up in a lab after the war, would they? They'd let him live his life, right? They'd let him get married (if he was so lucky) and have a family (if he was even luckier), wouldn’t they? Had he read the fine print on his enlistment forms? Jesus God, he wasn't partially the property of Stark Industries, was he? Stark was a nice-enough fella, but sometimes he would get this odd, maniacal look in his eyes that Steve knew was him on the verge of another technological breakthrough, and once — but only once — Stark had leveled that look directly at him. He'd quietly excused himself from the room after that and kept his distance for the next forty-eight hours. Stark appeared to have gone onto something else by the time Steve met up with him again, but Steve would never forget that look — the one that made him wonder if, sometimes, Stark saw him more as 'project' than 'person.'
Other Tony opened the box and tucked the bottom into the lid as he said, "I can't promise you anything, but I hope this is something like what you're looking for."
She shrugged and leaned forward onto the tabletop again. "Yeah, 'ventally." She gasped and sat back up on her knees again like she'd remember something important. "That's right! You weren't there! That's when Papa said you were in—" And she stopped a moment like she was trying to make sure she got the exact wording her papa had used. "—a piece 'f shit rat-hole on th' Ganges."
But Tony just reached up and patted his chest. "That's OK, babe. I wasn't actually trying to lay a guilt trip on you. 'Antonia Natasha' is actually…kind of nice."
He stood up, leaving his empty champagne glass on the table, and he made to turn, probably assuming his parting words were a proverbial 'mic drop' of some kind — if he even knew what a 'mic drop' was — but then stopped himself at the last second and turned right back around.
him touch himself and pleasure himself, but Steve was asleep, and Tony wasn't about to wake him, especially considering that he was still a little annoyed with him. OK, a lot annoyed with him. He'd been promised a weekend of sex and goofing off with his husband, and instead, he'd been virtually ignored from the moment his husband's little pal had appeared from out of the shadows and seemingly decided to stop running.
They moved to another part of the large gymnasium, and Natasha stood and watched them depart before she stepped over to where Steve and Tony were on the mat, Steve at his hundred-twentieth pushup. She stood above them, arms folded but a gentle smile on her face as she said, "So, I hear you're going for an ultrasound later."
He made some weird 'witchy'-type hand gesture at that, and Steve just stared at him flatly before he pushed himself to his feet and brushed off his jeans.
And then Steve gently pulled him upright, and Tony's muscles clenched from the push and tug of the plug, and Steve turned him around then backed him up slowly until he felt his calves hit the bed. He gently lowered Tony to a sitting position, and Tony gasped and tried not to moan as he felt the plug in his ass hit against his walls. He flexed his fingers, his wrists still bound, and squirmed a little, wanting to get the most from that full, tight feeling. But Steve put his hands on his shoulders, chuckling a little as he held him still.
"I don't buy it," someone said and looked around the group for acknowledgement and support. He got a couple of shrugs and a couple of nods in return.
"Yeah, well, we can't sell tickets to what you and your little princess get up to. I mean, that shit's NC-17."
She leaned closer, folding her arms on her desk. "Let me get this straight. Tony Stark hasn't been seen in months. Few days ago, Captain America shows up on a date with a mysterious brunette. Now, today, Captain America and this mysterious brunette—" she narrowed her eyes at Tony as though inspecting him, "—yeah, you look like the same woman—"
"No one's going to call her by her full name, Steve!" Tony said, exasperated. "And we're probably overthinking this, anyway. It's probably not a girl—"
"Principle of the thing, Steven. We're out here all alone, and I don't care if you are Captain America. Blood-thirsty murders don't care, either. They only care that we're a cute, young couple out here by our lonesome and will make great Innocent-Victim Stew."
whether to remain as he was or to go back — to back as he'd wanted so desperately to go back several months before — truthfully, honestly, he… didn't
He lessened his hold and pulled her away so she was back to just sitting on his lap and not hugging him. "Did you not hear who her 'Daddy' is?" he asked and looked between Rhodey and Bruce. "Even if I felt that way about Captain Needs-to-Learn-How-to-Take-a-Joke, which I clearly don't—" he shot a glare at Bruce, even though Rhodey was the one to say,
Tony spit out a laugh and nearly faltered at putting the pot back into the apparatus. He turned to Steve, grinning wildly, and Steve frowned as Tony stepped over to him, cupped his face with his hands, and said, "You. Are my favorite person. Ever."
Steve was still a moment, staring at the photos, before he nodded, and Tony watched his Adam's apple bob up and down as he swallowed.
"Here," Tony said and held Olivia out to him. Steve scooped her into his arms and held her against his chest, and he waited for Tony to situate himself with the bag and shut the car door before he followed him onto the sidewalk. The shoes he wore weren't exactly made for the snow that hadn't quite been cleared away, but he was able to gain enough traction not to slide around. How Tony was doing it with his 'lifts' was anyone's guess.
"I think Steve would see the symbolism in it," Bruce said and dug a spoon into the flesh of the fruit.
He just nodded, and Steve squeezed his shoulder and made his way toward the kitchen, leaving Rhodey in the living room with Tony for the time being. Rhodey turned his attention to him, and there was nothing but contempt written over his face as he said, "I don't know what you think you're doing or
"He was right," Steve said, not exactly answering his question. "It was tough to lead that kind of life back in those days. And I— I mean, I
everything seemed to be, I still can't help but think that something's going to come along and take it all away and I'll be back to square one again and I—"
"I shall attempt to contact the Goddess Esmeralda. Perhaps she may be willing to remove every last remnant of the hex that afflicts our friend."
"Whatever," he said and took a sip then went back to the matter at hand. "But what the hell? Why change what they've been doing since the dawn of time?"
"Wouldn't a nice neighborhood bar or a coffee shop be much more fun?" he asked over the noise, and Natasha snorted a laugh and said, "You're not that old, Stark."
Tony rolled his eyes. "Yeah, here's the issue, Einstein: You've got this parasite stuck in me, and let's face facts here, it is, technically, a parasite, but because I'm like this—" he motioned over himself again, "—there's no way to actually get this parasite out of me without, you know, gutting me like a fish."
It wasn't his form. He was, now and forever, physically female. He would take that over… It wasn't his child. He had inexplicably birth to a daughter, and he wouldn't trade his tiny bundle of fury for the world. Granted, that now meant he now owed that asshole Barton fifteen thousand dollars, but to a billionaire, that was a small price to pay. Well, in dollars. Pride was another matter entirely.
"Please don't use that sort of crass terminology in front of my impressionable daughter," Tony said as the rest of the gang piled onto the elevator, Thor, for whatever reason, bringing Mjölnir along.
, I am in no position to judge anyone about their lifestyle choices. So, did this fella have a name or was this one of those sordid trysts—"
"Mmm...it will be, Captain. I do think you may need to revise that half-a-dozen you secretly long for, however." When Steve set sharp, confused eyes on her, she smiled a little and added, "I told you, I know everything."
"Good girl," he said, and Tony felt him reach down and slowly and carefully twist the plug out of his ass. He gasped and arched his back just a little, and Steve shushed him and rubbed the hand that rested at the small of his back.
"Hmm?" Tony asked and looked up at Steve just as Olivia dropped her hand from her mouth and began to fuss a little in his arms. "Oh, right," he said and turned back to the baby. "I was about to get you something to eat, wasn't I?"
That seemed to put DUM-E in a better mood, as he happily whirred and zipped away to continue on his task. Tony just glared at Steve and said, "When he starts defying orders because he thinks he's too 'good' for them, I'm putting the blame square on you."
"Yeah, well, we'll see if that's still the way you feel when you have to push something the size of a watermelon out of something the size of a straw."
Tony, to his credit, didn't seem surprised in the least, and he put the Styrofoam cup to his mouth and took a sip before he smiled a little sheepishly and said, "Hi."
Barnes stayed quiet at that, and Tony had a feeling he hadn't believed a word he'd said but was too big a person to fight him on it. Tony, mentally sighing in relief at the lull in conversation, finished setting up his program before he decided it was time to get to work.
"It wasn't just that," Tony said, and, fuck, did he feel a sob working its way up through his chest? He swallowed like he was trying to swallow the embarrassment down and added, "It was… I liked nursing her, all right? I enjoyed it. I enjoyed how I looked. I enjoyed how I felt. I enjoyed what I could do — you know how clumsy these fingers are in comparison?" He unfolded his arms and held up his hands as though to show Steve his practically useless meat-hooks. "And I just— I feel old, all right? I feel— I didn't realize how old and broken down I actually was until I came back to
The conversation is clipped, concern belying Peggy’s easy words. Dusk falls as the call comes to an end, her fingers gripping the receiver tightly as she hangs up.
Steve steps back and lets her settle in to his desk chair while Clint leans in over her shoulder, whispering instructions that she bats away with pointy elbows. He doesn’t even stop to watch them; he trusts Natasha, trusts Clint by extension, and is grateful that he’d made the decision to take them up on their offer of Friday night beers back at the end of his very first week at the office. There’s no way they’d let him do this alone, he knows, no matter how much Clint is probably holding himself back from all kinds of inappropriate snarky innuendos.
By the time they get back to the house, Steve’s told Tony all about everyone. They pick up dinner on the way, and the kids are all thrilled to open styrofoam boxes full of pasta and garlic bread. There are containers of soup, cannolis for dessert, and Tony holds court like a king, knowing everyone’s name and never slipping up.
“Okay,” Tony says, tucking his head to kiss Steve’s knuckles where they’re fitted near his, and it’s an awkward fit for a temptation too impossible to resist. “You ready?”
Tony’s driving with his left hand, right elbow propped on the center console while his hand rubs at his mouth.
As it is, he slides a plate in front of Tony, who stares at him from across the island before cutting his eyes towards Bucky who is helping himself to the pan of still-frying bacon.
“Yeah, I am,” Tony says, and Steve doesn’t like it one bit, how he says it like it’s been said to him a million times before. “Got Pepper a bunny, she dumped me. Got you a tux, you hate me.”
“Cap, the entire room was on fire,” Tony says, feeling exasperated just thinking about it. “You could have made out a lot worse than a couple of nubby nails.”
“It didn’t win out the first time I asked you to take a look at the suit?” Tony asks, looking sideways.
To Steve’s abject horror, she turns to face him with her tongue caught between white teeth and cherry-red lips, and jabs the center of his chest so that one of the minuscule hidden buttons marching down his front pokes uncomfortably.
He keeps half expecting the world as he now knows it to crack into tiny pieces, expecting to go crazy, expecting things to go differently than they should. Bruce and Tony had talked about the science of it all, physics and branching timelines and phrases that elude his mind now. He knows he shouldn’t have stayed, but he did, and surprisingly, the world doesn’t end.
Thanks to everyone who took the time to let me know how they feel about chapter length! I appreciate the feedback, and you guys overwhelmingly advocated for longer chapters, so that's what you'll be getting.
Steve’s about to vibrate out of his skin. Every inch of him is buzzing when Tony sweeps in just as they’ve started eating, fixing himself a plate and then sliding into the seat next to Steve with not so much as a greeting.
“You gonna be that easy, sunshine?” Tony teases, and he’s giving himself whiplash at this point, so maybe he needs to pick a mood and stick to it. Steve’s still in one piece, disappointingly, so Tony brushes the backs of their hands together and tilts his head. “How would you feel about taking this to the bedroom?”
knows himself and Steve, and knows there are a million reasons they’ll never explore it, with Steve not reciprocating the feelings at the top of the list and the fact that they’d bonded over getting chummy with Steve’s alternate self somewhere in the middle.
This time, it’s whether or not Iron Man has done more good than harm over the years. Something impossible to quantify, Steve thinks privately, but then again, he’s not the one being paid to argue it.
Tony sees it. He can see the parasite it had been, eating away at the other Steve and forcing him to feel like he had to do things a certain way. At the very end, he’d been so single-minded it had nearly been too much to think about. Tony had tried, tried to deliberate on the moral dilemma of sending an old man back to his past like that, but the philosophy of it had overwhelmed him. He’d eventually given up trying to sort it out, deciding that the man was entitled to his own decisions.
Natasha refuses to indulge Steve any longer, stretching out in an Adirondack chair a ways from where they sit. She doesn’t look like she’s listening, eyes closed and entirely motionless, but Steve knows her and knows that she’s eavesdropping.
“Tony and I are old friends,” he says, because she’s sixteen and he’s not going to get into a decade of interpersonal dynamics with her. “I guess we move around when we sleep. It’s not a sexual thing.”
She’s still avoiding Steve’s eyes. “You two - I know that sexuality can be complicated these days. But I thought that, maybe I should mind my own business, but I wasn’t going to tell anyone and no one else saw anyway, and - ”
It’s not anger that he feels, because anger is too easy and whatever emotions Steve’s held towards Tony for the last couple of years are complicated, to say the least. He won’t do himself a disservice to reduce it all down to something as simple and secondary as
“Oh, I wouldn’t say that,” Steve remarks. “I quite like the idea of building my own rooms from scratch. I’m very particular about mattresses.”
“The other you,” Steve says, and it’s so gentle that Tony is taken aback by it. “He was in love with the other you. That’s what I meant by, he did everything because of you.”
“Where’s your room?” Steve dares to ask, and he watches Tony’s eyes flicker to the empty room, to Steve’s duffel, and then land back on Steve’s face.
“Easy,” Tony had murmured, and Steve’s eyes were wild, hand shooting out and grasping at thin air. “You got knocked down pretty hard there. Not many people would have survived that.”
Beth sits in the front seat, feet kicked up on the dash as Steve drives. She’s been restless all day and Tony is busy trying to play nice for some investors, so Steve had suggested milkshakes and fries and a night drive.
Steve regrets not pulling on a thicker jacket over his sweat-wicking performance-wear long-sleeved shirt now that the endorphins aren’t protecting him from the elements, but he uses his shoulder to nudge closed the glass window anyway. His breath puffs cloudy white against the endless gray before him; it’s only a matter of time before the first snow of the year. Leaning against the railing of the fire escape with his post-run protein shake in hand, he braces against the frigid chill while listening to the woman in his ear.
It shocks Steve when Tony reaches out to knock the back of their hands together. It’s such a short burst of contact, skin cool now that the sun is no longer around to warm them.
When he goes back to the house, he sits at the counter and eats the bowl of rainbow-colored ice cream that Beth scoops out for him.
Steve slides his eyes back to Tony, but then Serena is there and tugging on his shirt. He reaches for her, hefts her into his arms like it’s nothing, and she wraps her arms around his neck.
“Later,” Steve mouths at him, and Tony nods, forgetting all about criticizing Natasha for wasting very important resources. A warm feeling spreads inside of him - surely due to the bruise, he figures.
“I’ve got an alibi,” Tony says immediately. “Whatever it was, it wasn’t me. Tell him, Steve. I’ve been right here this entire time. He’s prepared to swear to it in front of a jury.”
so loud and intoxicating - it’s impossible to do anything but give into him, and Steve takes his time until they’re both breathless and Tony is nodding fervently and curling fingers into the sheets under him.
“ - Stark continues to respond with canned statements, despite rumors that he’s been meeting with government officials regarding the matter,” one of the news anchors says, and Steve wonders if this isn’t a little heavy for a Saturday morning. “One has to wonder if he’s really as well-intentioned as he pretends to be, when he continues to evade - ”
“All your friends are back to being superheroes again,” she says, as stern as Denise. “And you’re here.”
The wall of the elevator keeps him upright as he rides to his floor, holding his hand to his chest like he’s stemming the flow of phantom wounds. It feels like there’s a trail of blood dripping behind him, invisible to everyone who doesn’t know how sweetly Tony kisses, how kind he can be, or how much of his famous charm is simultaneously both put-on and more real than almost anything else in the world.
“Steve, no,” Tony says. “You can’t - I know you loved her, but - maybe I didn’t live in a parallel universe, but I don’t think it works like that.”
He tells Christina when she spikes a mild fever and has to stay home from school. He strokes her hair as she rests her head on his lap and watches daytime cartoons, mouth purple from the popsicle he let her have for lunch. She’s half asleep but clings to him, and Steve knows.
Bucky and Sam and Wanda look good, if tired. They eat in a diner, and Bucky demolishes several burgers while Sam complains about his table manners.
“Who says I’m not having a good time?” Steve asks, and it comes out too quiet but not quiet enough to get lost in the music and hollering of other club patrons.
“You’re part of the public,” Tony points out, much to Steve’s chagrin. “So don’t I get to hear your perception?”
But this is Steve they’re talking about, who had shown up in Tony’s office more than four years prior and changed his life in infinite ways from that moment onward. Steve, who is fearless and selfless and the same man Tony had teased upon first meeting, just a million times better. If anyone is worth speaking up to, worth speaking up
“Hey,” Steve says one afternoon. They’re enjoying the sun on the balcony, sprawled out and at ease with a bowl of cherries that they’ve been feeding each other.
He’s tending to the cosmos the following week, carefully cutting off blooms to bring inside and arrange in a vase, when Peggy comes outside. She sits on the front steps and soaks up the sun, and when he joins her, she speaks.
“If you know me, then you knew him,” Steve says, weighty without all the negative connotations of heavy, and Tony nods, parsing through the sentiment and running through several dozen responses in his head. It takes mere milliseconds to come to a decision, and he walks around the hood of the car before holding out an arm, beckoning Steve onward.
And because Peggy knows him, knows him in a way that very few have ever known him, she studies his face and gets it in one.
“Anything for you,” Steve says, accepting the not-a-gun to inspect. And then, leaning over to catch the corner of Tony’s mouth in a kiss, “You damn romantic fool.”
He’s teasing the sensitive skin leading away from Steve’s navel when the tube bounces off his upper arm.
“While I’m pretty sure GQ doesn’t do random drug tests,” he drawls, “I can’t imagine your editor loving that in print.”
“Tony,” Steve attempts, only it’s weak and cracking, and Tony must know it as he lets out a satisfied sigh.
Steve gropes blindly, feeling cool wool and there’s a distressed noise that might come from him, but maybe it doesn’t. He needs to not be like this, to not always be hopelessly in love with a man with a personality too big for the entire universe, talented and selfless and unaware of how phenomenal he is. Steve needs for Tony to know -
This universe is too similar to his own, perhaps because he’s done his best to leave the rest of the timeline untouched. He thinks that maybe he hasn’t done the right thing at all, and that he should have followed his instincts and told Peggy everything, should have changed everything for the better. He should have hunted Bucky down the moment he came back, should have spent the last twenty-plus years rooting out HYDRA agents one by one, should have dug himself out of the ice and figured out how to make it all work.
"Totally and completely," he said with a nod. "I mean, if you need to verify it, I can call in the rest of the Avengers, or Ms. Potts, the CEO of Stark Industries, or Colonel James Rhodes of the United States Air Force—"
He glanced down at the table he was sitting on, and he thought back several long months before to that infamous battle downtown, the one they'd never fully explained to the public, the one that had ended with him being transformed against his will.
He didn't miss the lecherous looks he'd gotten from a good half-a-dozen men that he knew were just looking for something to stick it in for a night (hey, he'd been there when he was young, horny, and desperate), and he swore one of them 'accidentally' brushed up against him just to grab a feel his ass.
He sighed and pulled back, and Tony followed suit, and as Steve furrowed his brow and tried to figure out what was wrong, Tony realized he'd grown used to her cries over the past couple weeks. He knew what that one meant.
"Antonia, do you remember what I said about you coming?" Steve asked, cheek pressed to his and hands still stroking over his belly.
inappropriate inches above the knee. They were very good-looking women, and dressed and styled and posed as they were, they
"I didn't say that," Steve said with a shake of his head over the chuckles of the other attendees. "And when did you try to—"
"Maybe," Steve said and reached out to put his hand on Tony's arm. Tony felt it and jerked his arm away before Steve could clamp down on it. "You're mad at me. Why?"
No! Oh, fuck no! Not if this was the outcome. The hell he was ever allowing anything like this to ever happen again. Granted, the only way that could happen is if he were to be turned into a woman again, but the fact of the matter was he'd just used the term
"Not sure 'privilege' is the word you're looking for," Tony said and made a face at the voice he spoke the words with. "I think 'burden' is closer to what you want."
"Jealous? Who says I'm jealous over Barnes? Just 'cause Steve drops everything at the mere mention of his name—"
Tony speared a sausage link and bit through half of it, and he chewed it then said, "I don't even understand how that waste of oxygen isn't still in a federal penitentiary," waving the fork with the remaining piece of sausage in the air as he did so. Steve watched the pattern — or lack thereof — of the fork then grabbed Tony's wrist and stilled it to pull the rest of the sausage off the fork with his teeth.
"—a bunch of assorted ones all clamoring for the power and prestige and to finish what the Red Skull's original band of merry pranksters couldn't."
"Starting to think I could use a vacation here," he muttered and set the eggs and butter on the counter and grabbed a pan from a cabinet. He looked at it askance as he set it on the burner, and he glanced back at her. "You don't mind if they're burned, right?"
He motioned over his body as though to explain what he'd left unsaid, and Tony just stared at him, blinking and frowning.
"Yeah? That's sweet. But unless you want your head taken clean off your shoulders by a guy that wears the fucking American flag for a uniform, I'd get the hell out of here and never look back."
OK. Not how it had happened, of course, which was so heavily outside the scope of consent it was laughable, but the fact that it was now his and all the denials in the world weren't going to turn him back. Not until he'd completed this…mission…for lack of a better word. This
Tony rolled his eyes and shook his head. Yeah, it was totally Steve's fault Hydra had attacked the power grid. Not that it was an easy target for anyone looking to cause chaos and destruction. No, it was definitely a personal attack against Steve.
"Yeah," Sam said, "nicest guy in the world. I mean, he's Captain America. But man, does that guy have a temper sometimes."
"It's a long story," Tony said and wondered where in the fuck they were going from there. They had been on their way back to the cabin so that Steve could watch Tony masturbate, but he had a strong feeling that was off the table now. Steve was standing right behind him, pressed up tight against him, and he could tell Steve's previous interest in their future activities had dwindled down to nothing.
“Yes, and no,” Tony says, looking up to see Steve regarding him intently. “Maybe you started out the same, but life shapes us. Everywhere your life has diverged from his has changed you.”
“Let me give you a ride,” Tony says, and when Steve starts to protest, it’s his turn to shake his head. “I’ve got a car, let me save you the fare. I know Vanity Fair doesn’t actually give a shit about you, so let me.”
By the time he’s ready for a shower, Bucky and Sam head to get some sleep. Tony’s still busy so when Wanda invites him to the media room and asks for his input on a few things, if he doesn’t mind, he goes with only minor hesitation.
“No,” Steve says, tongue stupid-slow in his mouth as his mind catches up to what he’s feeling. Tony’s lips go thin and pale as they roll together. “I can’t.”
“Tony,” Steve interrupts, looking up from where he’s testing the coffee temperature with the tip of his little finger. “You don’t have to tell me everything.”
He could do it now, the suggestive voice in his head whispers. He could ask Steve if he’d be willing to take a chance on him, could press Steve up against the hall wall and pull his lips down to meet his, could slam their hips together and -
“Nice,” Tony says appreciatively, and then he’s under the covers. “Do you mind if I get the light, or - ”
“And I meant what I said about always needing you,” Tony says finally. “I couldn’t have done any of it without you.”
“Then stop turning the door into splinters, and let me kiss you,” Tony tells him, and Steve nudges their noses together to make it easier for Tony to find his mouth, covering it with his.
“Put it on my tab,” Sam responds, eyes glued to some news channel reporting on absolutely nothing of immediate importance. Steve walks to stand in the draft the still-open window is letting in, knowing he should shut it and stop burning money to heat the outdoors, but the balance of hot and cold distracts him from how the news anchors announce a change in topic when they come back from the break.
“My nails are fine,” Steve says, flexing the fingers in question for Tony to see. The entire appendage is perfect, scarless and better than brand new. “And these are going to heal up just fine, too.”
“Told me to let him know if I need anything,” Steve says, lips curling up into a rueful, pained smile. “I’m not even mad at him. He’s allowed to go around with anyone he wants, now, isn’t he.”
“I don’t know how the world works,” Steve says. “I just know that you’re mine, and the stars aligned so it would work out like this. Maybe they align differently in the other universes, but I don’t want to think of a world where we don’t end up like this.”
Steve tilts his head to the side as he contemplates the contents of the fridge and Tony gets a mug for coffee.
Never once does Tony’s breathing return to that uneven alertness, and Steve just about drowns in the privilege of it all.
“No orange juice,” Sam says, pulling a shirt on as he enters, Carol and Rhodes coming in behind him. “Hey, man. Look at you.”
“Tony.” Pepper half-snaps half-groans, but Tony pays her no mind as Steve feels his tongue swipe over his lips. “Please. It’s too early to be sued for sexual harassment, and we’ve got a meeting to get to.”
Tony looks older but just as beautiful, and every inch the Tony that had never been his, no matter what his deluded younger self had believed.
Halfway through editing the thing and trying to decide whether or not it would be weird to include the part where Tony ribs him for almost getting sick on the plane all those years prior, his phone vibrates. He glances at the screen automatically, the notification only registering once his eyes have drifted back to the sea of words on his work desktop.
“It was nice,” Steve allows, because sure, death is never pleasant no matter how predictable, but for a couple of days it had felt like a field trip for adults.
“Stark seems to think they will stay friends,” Wanda says, but there’s something in the way her upper lips curls as she does that gives Steve pause.
“Well - first we tried to salvage the shield, but that didn’t really work out. We’ve got quite a few weapons of mass destruction around, but turns out you can’t reverse engineer things that way. Thor thought he could work some Asgardian magic on it, but nothing successful. So I scanned the specs, and may have spent the last - how many months has it been? Nine-ish? Eight? Anyway. I’ve been trying to negotiate with T’Challa, but he’s one stingy bastard, let me tell you.”
“Oh yeah, you can say that because you missed the hard part,” he scoffs, elbowing Bucky away from his fries.
It’s weird enough that they’re teammates, gearing up to face a giant alien threatening to wipe out half the universe, without thinking about how Tony has technically known his alternate timeline self since he was a literal infant. Realistically it’s not horribly weird, but it feels strange, and that’s without factoring in how many times Tony has found himself awfully suspicious about what had truly happened between the other Steve Rogers and Tony Stark.
“No,” he says. “Every day I had with her was more than I deserved, and I cherished it immensely. She made me happier than I could have ever imagined, but I don’t miss it. I’ve moved on.”
but he doesn’t have another name for it at the ready, and he doesn’t know how to proceed. This was certainly the last thing he expected upon rolling out of bed this morning, but now it’s happened, and he has to deal with it.
Steve grins back. They unpause the movie, and eventually the noise lures Morgan back downstairs. When the credits start to roll, she slouches in the cushions and kicks at the coffee table.
When Steve glances over the saturated royal blue shoulder of his tux, thinking that maybe he’s imagined it, he sees Tony’s mouth drawn into some semblance of the smile Steve’s been missing all night. It’s curved just wide enough to be genuine, and Steve can’t help but smile back, as half-turned and inside-out as he is.
“I'll be at the tower tonight. I have some business to take care of in town. You can meet me there at, say, six o’clock?”
Tony spins around, taking a second to catch himself from tripping over his own two feet before his eyebrows engage in some ridiculous waggling thing. “You been keeping tabs on me, Rogers?”
“More like him getting behind the wheel of a Formula One car that was blown to bits stopped it from happening,” she says, lips pursing in disappointment at the missed opportunity. Steve’s skin feels at least three sizes too small, and he fiddles with the cocktail straw in his drink. “Oh, come on. You can’t possibly be judging me.”
“Maybe later,” Steve says, but it feels like a lie. He’s been in Houston for a couple of months and November has finally freed the city from the oppressive heat he’s grown used to, and he’s in no hurry to leave before he’s made sure that every kid who could have a home, makes it there.
With Steve at the helm once more, they set off on their next great adventure. Tony knows he’s being obnoxious, tossing things in the cart based on whether or not they catch his eye for more than a split second, and Steve remains impressively stoic as he snags Tony’s elbow before he can even pull the fifth consecutive bottle of shower gel off the shelf.
Tony turns his face into Steve’s palm, lips pressing gently to the center, and Steve thinks that of all the worlds he’s existed in, this world -
Because it’s obvious that Tony’s in pain. He’s gone through a breakup, has lost his house, has undergone the very public destruction of what had been an estimated few dozen Iron Man suits - it would be too much for anyone. Steve is sure that it’s all tied up in one ugly package, and compounded with how Tony had acted back in May after the whole aliens-on-Earth thing, he can’t imagine what Tony is going through.
That’s an easy one. “Didn’t want to hear that I was wrong.” He pauses, and it’s almost liberating to have the truth out there. It boosts him up, the two of them level on a platform high above everyone else, and he knows that even when he leaves for lower ground, he won’t have ceded anything for the first time in a long time. “Didn’t want to hear that you regretted it.”
“He’ll keep it,” Tony says, shooting Rogers a look as if daring him to argue, and Rogers just nods again.
“It took me a long time to stop thinking of you as mine.” When Tony doesn’t move, he elaborates. “You, as in the you in this universe. It’s how I thought of you, how I differentiated between you and the Tony in that timeline. I thought of you as mine, and reminded myself that he wasn’t. But that wasn’t entirely accurate, was it? Because you have never been mine.”
It’s the definition of picturesque, and Steve carefully snaps shots of the scenery and sends them off to Beth and Josie, knowing that the latter will show everyone at the house.
Everything feels charged, Steve’s ears buzzing as he wars inside, between what he’s wanted and what he knows they’re not ready for. In the end, he licks his lips and looks away, hating the glimpse of disappointment he catches on Tony’s face.
Denise has a head full of plaits that show off how young she is. She would’ve still been a kid when it all happened, and he tries not to think about it. About how she probably lost her parents, about how he’s pretty sure the whispering kids behind her are her younger siblings, and how it makes him sick to his stomach.
“Well,” Tony says, the single syllable stretching between them like taffy as he flicks his lighter. “Not like you’d write about it if I did.”
He’d picked it up the first time they’d happened to be forced to sleep in the vicinity of each other. The team had avoided that kind of intimacy, but when they’d been hunting down HYDRA, it had become unavoidable. Only when necessary, and in shifts, and almost never Tony and Steve at the same time. But the first time, in the back of the Quinjet after a particularly long and grueling excursion while Clint piloted them home, Steve had laid down and paid attention to Tony’s breathing before falling asleep with military efficiency.
Tony’s breathing is that alert off-beat staccato, and that in itself grounds Steve enough that he can resist the urge to fist the sheets in his boundless frustration, the agony of having no idea what’s going on and where he belongs in it. He hates that Tony can come along and shake the very foundation of the almost-home he’s helped build, and more than anything, he hates that more than a decade of knowing each other has cemented the fact that there’s nothing he can do about it.
Steve doesn’t want to talk about how he wishes he had someone to hold him, to tell him he’s safe and it’s okay to sleep.
“Peggy’s husband?” Steve pauses for a beat, weariness oozing from every minuscule pore of his carved-from-marble face, and Tony nods. “He’s me.”
“You didn’t rob her of anything,” Tony disagrees, shaking his head. “She wouldn’t even know what she was missing if you didn’t tell her, and it’s pretty hard to miss something you never actually had.”
And Tony does have him, because he comes long and pulsing as he collapses down onto Steve who clenches around him till Tony is certain he loses his grasp on all his senses. It takes several moments before he can gather himself, and he braces himself to move out of Steve before there’s an aggressive slap to his ass.
“You will,” he says quietly. “Everything Howard told you you couldn’t accomplish. You will do it all and more.”
“Thought we didn’t need to worry about birth control,” Steve counters, and then Tony is grumbling something about getting Steve away from children for once in his life.
He disentangles their hands so he can plant himself fully for proper leverage and Steve’s mouth abruptly forms into a perfect circle, so Tony thrusts like that again.
“Not unless she goes for the future doctor,” Steve says, banging his head against the headrest. “Maybe I need to stay back and - ”
He could stay in New York. Help with the relief efforts. There are so many people that need to be reintegrated into society: jobs have since been filled, entire buildings condemned, and he could be good at that. Steve has always been good at directing others, at coming up with a plan and pulling it off. The task is daunting, and it would fill something inside of him. It would give him a purpose, after feeling so helpless and defeated.
Tony talks in winding circles, directing them down aimless tangents about an android who walks through walls and how he managed to convince James Rhodes to dedicate less and less time to the military. He goes on about Stark Industries’ relief programs and energy initiatives, and expertly pivots the conversation every time Steve takes a stab at gently leading him down an avenue that would require him to talk about his own personal involvement. Steve’s not new to interviewing, and certainly isn’t new to talking to Tony, so he waits until Tony’s prepared and drank himself another shot of espresso to press harder.
So Steve dog-ears his place in his book and gets up to hand Tony a neatly folded white undershirt and sweats. They’ll be too long, workable at the waist because of the drawstring and Steve’s proportions, but they’ll do.
“My apologies.” Her voice is crisp and not apologetic at all, but she gathers herself and stands tall, looking out before them like a lioness surveying the savanna. She doesn’t even bother bidding him goodbye, which is perfectly fine with him, and he doesn’t bother watching as she slinks away into the crowd.
Thor has yet to find an American prepackaged highly-processed junk food item that doesn’t fascinate him endlessly. Bruce leaves tiny cups of tea and tacky smears of honey wherever he goes and Natasha favors a wide range of takeout that represents every corner of the world, from Bolivian to Belgian to Bangladeshi. Clint vacillates wildly between ordering ten pizzas at a time, to cooking hearty stews and casseroles before neatly separating them into single-serve Tupperware containers and storing them in the freezer, complete with a note detailing outrageously specific reheating instructions. Tony is the culprit behind the neat rows of glass-bottled pressed juices and the abundance of healthy pantry snacks, much to Thor’s kale-hating chagrin. He’s also got a stash of protein ice cream in the freezer that he’s notoriously protective of, even though Clint snorts at it and claims that it’s no substitute for the real thing.
Because less than a week after the fact, GQ had courteously informed him that they would no longer be taking legal action against him.
“I can do it,” he offers. “I can open myself up. I can show you, or we can do that another time. As I said, it’s been a while, so it’s not the worst idea for me to do it myself.”
it - hell, he’s semi-seriously dated other people and still hasn’t gotten over it - but that had been just as much a part of acceptance as the rest of it.
“I thought things were okay,” Tony says, and Steve hates how he can hear the hint of desperation there. He hates when Tony gets like this: so generous, so eager to please even when it’s to his detriment.
and they’ve been together for a while, long enough that Steve’d feel like an asshole for taking anything Tony is saying as anything more than professional kindness muddled with leftover playboy charm - but his face is still warm and his stomach still feels weird, and pushing all that aside requires more brainpower than he’s accustomed to using before the start of his workday. So really, it’s not his fault for blushing even hotter while mumbling out, “Yeah, of course,” the words coming out in an unsophisticated tangle that, unreasonably, makes Tony grin even
“Just be glad you don’t need to help anyone buy condoms again,” Tony says. “In fact, be glad that there’s no chance of pregnancy for this one.”
“Do you want to try again?” Tony asks, all body parts back on his side of the car as he glances at Morgan in the rearview mirror.
“He’s got a...personal errand to run,” Tony says as delicately as he’s capable of, which isn’t saying much. “He asked me to come along.”
Steve feels paralyzed, bolted to the concrete as he watches Tony slide along the black leather bench seat until he’s out of the car and drawing himself upwards with a single-minded focus. Some warped sense of tunnel vision sets in, one where Steve can feel the loaded gun pressed to the small of his back, threatening him with flashbacks to that February night years before. He watches Tony join their little quartet, and in the back of his head Steve knows that they’re at high risk of garnering nosy bystanders, but no one else seems bothered by the possibility as Tony pulls the trigger on a wide grin that absolutely transforms his face, beginning with half-moon wrinkled eyes and continuing on past the moment Steve realizes he’s
Steve wants to leave before he makes this worse than it already is. Because he’s seeing something he kinda thinks he shouldn’t be able to, and there’s a part of him that wants to stick around to fix whatever being sucked into a wormhole did to Tony because there’s no other explanation for why he’s baring his soul over top of a cocktail table, only they don’t know each other like that and it’s been less than a week and none of that is a recipe for anything less than disaster.
“If you’re good for your mom,” Steve says, lowering his voice conspiratorially, “I’ll work on getting your dad to say yes to Disneyland.”
A man like Tony Stark is always charming, and Steve’s been struggling not to read into that all night.
“It’s not a bad idea,” Steve allows, arms crossing against his massive chest, and without something to fiddle with, Tony starts tapping his fingers on the arms of the chair. “What, you want to put off retirement, or just have one last hurrah?”
Once the sun is up, enormous and buttery, both mundane and inspiring at the same time, Steve kisses Tony’s hairline, right below the crown he’s still wearing.
because he’s angry and has done this before, he only feels like he’s flying high because it finally feels like the twisted relationship they share is finally in his control. It’s ugly and inappropriate, rude and alienating, but it’s the closest he’s ever gotten to feeling like it isn’t all up to Tony.
If Steve is going to do this, he’s not going to write that story. He’s not going to write about playing with power, and he’s not going to force Tony to hold himself accountable. He’s going to stay true to the facts and his own standards, and -
And then he comes back, furious and right out of the hospital with stitches still marring his pretty face, and Steve forces him to sit down and be quiet before he wakes Peggy.
“A prototype,” Tony confirms. “I messed around with some other materials, but nothing else compares. I assume you know that.”
“I get that,” Steve says, and Tony can tell that he means it. Tony watches as Steve stretches his arms above him, mouth going stretched but staying closed in the way it does whenever he’s holding back a yawn.
“No,” Tony says, and then suddenly he’s close and Steve’s eyes fall shut in shock as arms tuck around his midsection and tug him in. He can’t remember if he’s ever hugged Tony before, but he’s certain that this Tony has never hugged him before, and all the worlds seem to have come together to let this singular moment exist. “No. I’m telling you, that’s not how it works. I mean, do
“Hard to be Cap when you gave away the shield faster than I gave away my virginity,” Tony says begrudgingly. “Borderline same level of enthusiasm, too. Kind of frightening, when you think about it.”
Steve knows he’ll have to convince his legs to work soon, so he can clean himself up before everything gets gross, but he just lies there and drips blood into the sheets while knowing that he could’ve known, could’ve asked and gotten an answer, could’ve had this for real if only he’d been able to work up the courage.
Any momentary confidence Steve may have possessed earlier when messing around disappears. Because Tony is a notorious womanizer, something he’s been able to keep in mind without questioning too much; because Tony is a ruthlessly efficient businessman, and this is technically business. It’s for Tony’s career, yet another piece about one of the most desirable men on the planet, and it’s been difficult to discern the motives behind the flirting that seem to come as naturally to him as making money always has been.
He ignores how much he likes that, and extends a hand in what anyone else would interpret as a parting handshake. Parting, because Happy is clearing his throat obnoxiously and going on about cops and fines and loitering, but Tony doesn’t get the memo. No, instead he grabs Steve’s hand as he should, but that’s about where the interaction stops following the script and turns into something that normally would only be found in some Ambien-influenced dreamscape.
Peter, who’s been doing a good job of keeping his head down and laughing at all the appropriate moments while tucking into his food, jerks his head up while his knee hits the bottom of the table.
“So now we’ve got to get these kids back with their parents,” she says, ignoring him. “Some of these kids, we know they don’t have any. There were a lot of deaths in the aftermath. So then we’ve got the ones who blipped back, and don’t have anywhere to go.”
It must be answer enough, as Steve encourages him with every little movement and noise. He’s more responsive than Tony would have dared to hope for and it’s sexy in a way Tony hadn’t anticipated, watching Steve react to him. They’re a little all over the place and Tony knows synchronicity will come with time, he’s not worried about it. Besides, it’s hotter like this, the lack of a choreographed routine keeping him on his toes and entirely focused on the unadulterated sensations.
The days tick forward. A countdown. Steve writes letters to no one and burns them. He considers his future, how he wants to live out the rest of his days, how to account for what may or may not change now that Tony knows the truth. When he’s not with Peggy, he sits and plans it all out, decides what he wants his legacy to be, in this universe and his own.
“I’ll be right back,” is what he settles on, and Tony feels his mouth drop open as his front goes instantly cool. It’s not an unwelcome feeling, exactly, when the literal heat between them had been enough to make his head swim even without taking the circumstances into consideration. He still feels left, though, and blatantly checks Steve out as he makes his way across the room and into the bathroom.
in letters that could only belong to Clint, and through his laughter, Tony manages to motion for Steve to join him.
It is hard to stay away from them. Natasha feels close enough to touch, but he refrains. While he might know them, they do not know him. Still, he misses them all so much he aches with it.
Navigating away from his contacts list, Steve does his best to ignore the conversation. Those people get paid to speculate and hit certain talking points to garner the largest audience possible, sensationalism be damned. It’s not too different from what he does, not really, and he shouldn’t feel anything about it.
“Because it doesn’t work as well as I thought it did,” Steve says. “Turns out, when you leave something up to someone else, neither of you end up getting what you really wanted.”
“I can handle it,” Steve says, because Tony might not have shared this thought with him, but Steve knows him well enough to know that he’s been thinking it anyway. “As long as I get there.”
“Should I assume we’ll be seeing you tonight?” Clint asks, hopping up and cursing when one ankle wobbles perilously. “Unless, you know, you’re too good for us now that you’ve been inducted into the very elite club of ‘People Who Have Blown Tony Stark and Lived to Tell the Tale.’”
She points out the rest of the rooms, tells Steve that Morgan has her own next to Tony’s on the next floor up, and he says he’ll check out his room later. For the time being, they mosey on back to the common area where Carol is now dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and Rhodes is at the stove.
“I’ll bring you one,” Steve tells Tony, and it’s the first they’ve spoken directly to each other, but the warmth on Tony’s face as he shoots him an appreciative look more than makes up for it.
“I’m just the journalist,” Steve says, nodding at Natasha’s desktop screen. “The journalist who got blackout drunk and tagged along home with him.”
Tony slides the hangers off the rod, one at a time. “You’re absolutely right, for once. I should just get both. Hey, what are the chances we make it out of here for less than a buck fifty?”
Tony drums his fingers against the wheel for a long time, in some nonsensical pattern, and Steve wants to scream at him to stop as the car picks up speed. They’re passing everyone else on the highway, almost out of the surrounding area entirely. Steve wants to go back to the house and huddle around the tv while everyone throws popcorn at each other, only for him to find it wedged between the couch cushions when he goes to bed later.
“Ah,” she says, a guilty look crossing her features. “I don’t drive in the traditional sense, exactly.”
“I’d like to get going,” she said, clapping her hands together, the universal signal for him to chop chop. Denise was in the passenger seat, hiding a giggle in her shoulder while Manny checked his mirrors and made sure no one was in danger of shooing the car out of the departures lane. “I’ve got a bus to catch, in case you forgot. Callie says she got tickets to a soccer game, and I don’t want to be late. She just got her license, and her step-brother’s wife is letting us borrow the car.”
But Tony’s breathing shifts, the snores giving way to the easy pattern of deep, even breaths. It’s small, but Steve doesn’t want to risk it. He can’t stand what might happen if he reacts the same way he reacted last time, and so he forcibly relaxes every muscle in his body. Besides, there’s no legitimacy to the possibility that sleeping together had changed anything before, so there’s no reason to worry about anything changing this time.
“I didn’t know how it would change things,” Steve claims, if only to wipe that look off Tony’s face. It doesn’t work, and Steve keeps going. “I was - after Peggy couldn’t get pregnant - Tony, I was terrified that anything would change. I kept thinking about you, and a world where you didn’t exist, and I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t do it. I’d have ended up changing everything, and I couldn’t live in a world where you didn’t.”
“How would I?” Steve points out. He hasn’t been carrying a phone, and if the kids don’t mention it, he keeps his nose out of the news.
Tony looks around at the home he visited a handful of years prior. He remembers it well without even trying, not eidetic but impressively close, and reaches for the memory easily. Steve doesn’t give him time to verbalize the recollection, too itchy with expertly concealed nerves.
“Couldn’t have done it better myself,” he tells Tony, and it’s hard to stem the obvious pride flowing over him.
It both placates and enrages him. Yeah, he’ll write an article that most editors would yell at him for, will defend Tony to the ends of space and time as long as Tony’s got good intentions and solid reasoning - but he hates that Tony knows he’ll do it.
He’s pleading and it’s so much that it’s all Tony can do to listen, chasing his own end as much as he’s trying to give Steve his. Everything comes down to this, and Tony can’t remember if anything else has ever mattered as much as this does, as much as cementing what they feel and what they’re going to have from here on out, this consummation the most vital point of any timeline to ever exist.
“More like, it’s freezing outside and I’m not really up to you offering me yet another ride-along with Iron Man,” Steve says, just in case Tony offers up yet another extravagant form of transportation.
“I’m not sure it helped me,” he admits, but he calls Fury, gives him the okay, and carefully sets to scouring the house for anything that might give him away.
Steve remembers what that used to feel like, and how rare it had been. It had been like winning a contest on the radio, something that you didn’t think would ever happen until it did, and it was a thousand times more exciting than it had any reason to be.
“There’s no way I would have missed that,” Tony says with a surety that he doesn’t quite feel, because there’s absolutely no reason for Steve to lie about this. The guy might be an uptight asshole most days, but he’s not a liar by any stretch of the imagination. “He knew me as a kid. I saw him during breaks from school. He and Peggy stayed with Jarvis the entire week of the funeral, for crying out loud. He doesn’t even look like - ”
“And here I was,” Tony says, and he’s got that look again, the one that isn’t hurt. “Thinking I might get a chance to have some fun with you off the clock.”
Tony leans back into the embrace, amazed at how seamlessly they’ve transitioned into this, like their friendship had always been fated to evolve into a loving relationship.
When they break apart, neither of them make any movement backward. They’re so close that Steve’s nose is brushing his, that Tony can see the sweep of his eyelashes, that they’re just breathing each other in.
Now is the first time Tony’s ever really stepped down to proclaim that he might be worth as much as the rest of them - no, maybe he’s brought the rest of them higher; yes, that’s it - and Steve’s running out of excuses. Because if he sees Tony as a higher power and Tony doesn’t even believe in one, then there’s nothing left but a manageable distance that only requires Steve to put one foot in front of the other.
“It was the first one,” Steve corrects, trying not to let his embarrassment show. “Half the kids in my major in college wanted to be the next Christiane Amanpour, and the other half just wanted to interview famous people.”
“I just wanna forget about it,” Steve tells her, misery tugging sharply at his throat and the corners of his eyes. “It’s so stupid, he’s not even worth it.”
He wants to cry. He wants Tony to leave and he never wants to let him go, and he wants to get a hold of some Pym particles and go back to 2012 and live another life that doesn’t feel more bitter than sweet most of the time. He wants to press a hand to his chest and remind himself that he’s alive, that they’re alive, and there could have been more casualties than there were, and the prime example of that is in the other room and undressing right now.
“Sorry,” Steve says into the receiver. He’s a little surprised Tony is still there. “I’m borrowing one of the kids' phones.”
Eventually, they peel themselves off the twisted, sweaty sheets. Tony makes a comment about having to upgrade his shower to super-soldier standards, but Steve just grips his backside tight and kisses him against the glass partition while the water heats. His eyes are bright as Steve nudges them under the pressured spray, delivering wet kisses behind his ear, along his forehead, down the back of his neck until hands wander and they’re both sprouting goosebumps even as steams gathers around them, slipping in the infinitesimal space between them.
“Or we can go back to just kissing,” Steve offers. “I was trying to be polite. Didn’t want to force anything.”
Steve just shrugs. “It’s my job,” he points out, “to get people to talk about what I want them to talk about. Sometimes that involves letting them go down a rabbit hole of ass-related non-sequiturs, and other times that involves interrupting them.”
“We haven’t fully figured it out,” she says with a flippant shrug that tells him she couldn’t care less about figuring it out, and Tony has been doing most of the figuring on the subject. “Not everything seems to be exactly as it was on Earth, but similar enough. It’s impossible to know where we are because transportation isn’t necessary here, and trying to determine our relative location is pretty useless when we can alter our surroundings on a whim.”
It’s just research, he tells himself. He’s paying attention, and that’s just good journalism. It’s got nothing to do with how Tony’s so close that Steve can smell the barest hint of cologne still clinging to his pulse points.
“Maybe they were friends,” Tony suggests. “Maybe he wanted someone to blame. Maybe you scared him straight, and he never kept anything from anyone ever again.”
“Damn,” Tony says, and he smacks the tube against his palm, enjoying the way Steve is scratching at the dark sparse hairs littering his kneecap. “I must have been way off my game to completely miss this.”
Steve sits in his favorite spot, the second cushion from the left. His arm stretches out along the back of the couch, nodding along and sipping his water as he listens to whatever Natasha is saying. He looks recently showered but has completely forgone all social norms in wearing sweatpants and one of his indecently tight shirts, and Tony doesn’t even hesitate before falling into the space next to him.
“I don’t need Neosporin, Tony,” Steve says patiently, standing up to take stock of the state of his uniform. “You know that.”
It’s going to be a controversial choice, Steve knows, to appoint him Person of the Year. Stark Industries and associated organizations have contributed more aid and technological advancements worldwide than any other entity, Tony’s last name plastered all over everything, and that’s even without factoring Iron Man into things. Some people think he’s a fraud, though, a man in an expensive tin can with a god complex who’s spent way too long unchecked.
Other Tony snorted a laugh and said, "You know, I can still remember— I was just a kid, but I can still remember my gramps throwing him out of the house.
Bruce probably had something, come to think of it. And if not that, he probably had something he could take a toke on.
“That an open invite? We might be tied up for a while. Thinking about calling Wanda out for backup.”
It doesn’t go on for long. By the time Steve opens his eyes against the melting orange painting the inside of his lids, Tony’s crouched down and slumped over. Steve doesn’t look at the contents of the toilet any longer than it takes to register that it’s full of pure liquor and bile, flushing it away with one hand while angling for a wad of toilet paper with the other. He wordlessly offers the wad to Tony who takes it, looking up with curiosity in his bleary eyes.
So Tony stays, readjusting his hold on Steve until he’s working him with any vestiges of technique he might no longer possess. He swipes a thumb over the head, feels the weeping slit and can’t believe how much there is to ease the way, and it doesn’t take very much for Steve to come after that. Tony does his best to commit it to memory: the sharp pleasure-pain of overstimulation as Steve’s every muscle contracts, the screwed-up ecstasy overtaking his features, the white-hot spurt of spend between his fingers.
“You can ask me whatever you like right now,” Tony offers eventually. “This is a secure line, so there’s no need to worry about - ”
“There’s got to be something,” Tony insists. “Do they need a bigger place? I can find an abandoned McMansion down there, they can each have their own bedroom and en-suite. Tennis courts, a pool, the whole shebang. How many are there?”
It’s not perfect. Steve tries to help him by bearing down and then ends up grimacing, and Tony jerks reactively to add insult to nonexistent injury.
He’s stroking over the bridge of Steve’s nose and standing dangerously close when Steve’s hit with another wave of deja vu. He isn’t even sure of what jumpstarts it this time, only that one moment he’s irritated with Tony’s forwardness and the next he’s remembering a dream full of laughter and kisses sucked into tender junctions.
“Sam was getting annoying,” Steve says, tucking the Neosporin back in its slot in the kit. “Figured it was the only way to shut him up.”
It’s been more than five years and the girls aren’t very old. He wouldn’t expect them to remember anything.
“I hope Happy’s back soon,” he says quietly. He’s mostly out of the car, doing his best to smile at the driver, when he hears -
“Us,” Steve says, motioning between them, hand stopping just shy of making contact with Tony’s chest. “And the parallels between us and them.”
“What?” Tony says, a beat too late to be considered normal, but Steve doesn’t seem to notice as his mouth does that thing again, the one that gets Tony nearly every goddamn time.
“I’m surprised they haven’t already,” Tony comments. “With how long he’s been here, you’d think some would have thought of him by now.”
“Alright,” Steve says, injecting the words with as much earnestness as he can muster, considering his disappointment at the lack of a proper goodbye. “You’ll call and chat.”
He thinks, for a second, that he’s having a heart attack. Between the lack of air circulating to his brain and the roaring in his ears, it feels entirely possible. Steve is distantly aware of Pierce talking, but the only thing he can focus on is the news ticker at the bottom of the screen, clean black letters spelling out the latest disaster like it’s nothing more than a headline.
“Together,” he says. “And yeah, maybe that time I was the one who left. But I thought I made it clear this time around. I didn’t want it to be like that ever again. When I came back? When I brought your shield and solved time travel for you and wore the gauntlet? Did none of that make it painfully, abundantly clear that I intended for the rest of it to be together?”
They both move around as little as possible, trying to get comfortable without disrupting the delicate balance between them, and maintaining as much distance between them as they can. Steve doesn’t want to push, but he has so many questions, and he parses through them methodically until he finds one that feels adequate without prying. Then, he listens for Tony’s breathing.
“I think your interrogation skills could use a little more work, sunshine,” Tony tells him, delighting when he sees how the experimental term of endearment makes Steve frown and go pink. “Might want to spend some more time with Romanoff. It took you like, two seconds to cave and tell me what was up.”
Steve does that weird thing where he yawns with his mouth closed, and Tony wrinkles his nose at it. They’ve long since passed the point of Tony forcing him to explain why he doesn’t just yawn like a normal person, and it’s not a discussion worth revisiting especially now.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees, and then he twice pats the empty stretch of thin mattress beside him. It’s a small motion but it holds the weight of the universe, and Steve’s heart pounds away in double-time.
“The compound’s been rebuilt,” Sam says, once Bucky has passed off the phone. He hadn’t said much beyond a greeting, telling Steve that it was good to hear his voice and he hoped he was doing well. “It’s not the same, but it’s something. We’ve got Wanda, and Rhodes spends a lot of time here. Scott came by a couple of weeks ago to consult on something, brought Hope. That was one hell of a time. You could drop in.”
Happy grumbles as he circles back to the driver’s side, and Pepper remains utterly nonplussed in her seat.
“Only if you do too,” Steve says, and it’s kind of funny, the way he tries to inject a commanding tone into the words but only barely manages it.
Steve thankfully ignores both of them, instead kneeling directly to Tony’s right, and Tony curses under his breath as he reaches for the hem of Tony’s shirt, the strong line of his torso bumping against Tony’s thigh.
“Even I’m starving,” Tony says, motioning to his spread of plates and bowls as he salts and peppers his poached eggs. “So for you, I can only imagine.”
Rhodes snipes Tony’s mug, prompting loud complaints as it’s carried to the pot that’s in desperate need of refilling.
And now, stepping out of a hired car onto the lawn of the giant glass-and-steel structure of a compound that Tony’s built upstate, he refuses to roll over and let Stark take advantage of his soft underbelly one more time. He’s even ready to record everything like a proper journalist this time, goddamnit. No more rookie mistakes, like sitting across a white tablecloth from a manipulative and intimidating stranger who’d taken one look at the device and tossed it into the passing waiter’s water pitcher. No, this time he’s got his phone and it’s going to be different, he’d decided that the moment he’d accepted this gig, and letting Iron Man convince him to go for a quick aerial tour of the property is absolutely not a good idea if he’s going to stick to his guns.
"I'm saying I just need you and me and a nice evening in," he replied around the bite, and Tony nodded and parsed the words for what he could make out from them. He hadn't denied that he
Tony closed his eyes and grimaced, and he groaned a little and pressed he heels of his palms into his eyes. God, he always felt so funny afterward whenever she did that.
He'd noticed she'd sounded a little frazzled and flustered the moment she'd picked up the phone. He'd just assumed she was frazzled and flustered with him. That was usually the way it went, wasn't it?
He did — of course he did. His hormones were raging. But he still gave a flat smile and shook his head some and said, "No. Go give the old lady a thrill."
He took one last look at the table where the SHIELD dossier sat, and he closed his eyes and pictured his Tony one last time — the way he smiled, the petulant tilt of his head when he'd pointed out the difference in their heights, the soft and tender way he tended to his daughter — and finally closed that book for good, swallowing down the memories along with any hopes and dreams that he might have had that
"It doesn't look like a spider," he said and let Olivia go back to crunching on it. "It looks more like the silhouette of a woman."
"Look," he said, suddenly finding all eyes in the gallery were now on him, the small crowd moving away from the various panels and moving to gather around them, "long story short, there's a certain occupational risk that comes from being an Avenger."
Tony shrugged some and reached up to run gentle fingers through Steve's hair. It was shorter, softer. He must have had it cut since the last time he saw him. "Subtle differences. Steve Rogers can say sarcastic shit that Captain America could never get away with. Steve Rogers is allowed to have doubts. I don't think the Cap is."
Steve just shook his head and took a sip of his drink, but Tony turned to him and said, "Steve, I just thought of a new game we can play."
Steve turned his head some so that he was able to rub his face into Tony's side, and he murmured, "I get that feeling, too."
"As an insult? Yeah, I know." He sat back up again and began to run another test on the arm circuitry. "But sometimes, I wish he could be just a little more…tactful."
Tony waved him off. "I get it. Yeah, it's… It's an adventure. I make for a hell of a knockout dame."
Steve needed only a second to process that before he was grasping a firm hold of Tony's hand and practically dragging him back up the road.
"Uh," Tony said and blinked at Steve before he turned back to Natasha, "I think that's the whole point of this? We
Truth be told, the pelvic exam wasn't the most offensive thing ever to be done to him. It didn't hurt, and it was over pretty quickly, and the doctor assured him everything was as it should be.
of things — that were just a bridge too far for him, and he was much more comfortable listening to the music of the era he'd come from or stuff recorded not long after.
"It was stupid in 1944, and it's still stupid in 2014," Steve muttered and switched the channel again.
"You don't know that. You don't know what the serum did to your DNA. And hey, I've been dry for well over a year now! Look, I know it sounds stupid, but it's just… Would it be such a bad thing?"
," JARVIS replied, and Tony rolled his eyes and sped up toward the falling red, white, and blue blur, and as he got within reach of him, he grabbed him by the waist and clung to him, pulling him up and away from the ground they were a little too close to.
Someone earlier had done the math and figured out it was Christmas Eve, and that had turned into talk of Christmas Eves past and Christmas Eves to come, and Steve would be lying if he didn't admit a little pang of jealousy hit him listening as the others reminisced over days gone by and plotted out happier days ahead. Sure, Steve had seen his share of happy — cold, barren, but happy — days of Christmases past, but so many of those featured memories of Bucky, and Bucky…
Jim just raised an eyebrow, and Steve shook his head a little like he couldn't believe how... unsmooth Tony had been, but Thor just grinned and said, "I am sure the Captain and his beloved put a great deal of thought into their selection and weighed the pros and cons of all of those whom they would gladly entrust the health and welfare of their daughter."
Steve rolled his eyes then came around the station and grabbed a chair. "Did you seriously not see it?" Sam asked as Steve logged in his info.
But Tony had actually been looking for an opportunity to try it because, well, he was horny as fuck, Steve was amazing at driving him mad with pleasure, and, well, he wanted to.
She chewed her lip some and narrowed her eyes. "I know what Steve looks like when he's faking happiness," she said. "Those few months after he came out of the ice — when he was trying to convince everyone he was fine and he didn't need to talk to anyone—"
And then, it was like a light clicking on in Steve's head, and he blinked and cocked his head to the side a moment like something had just come to mind, and he shot Tony a sly look and said, "You're right. I would
Olivia jumped up and tried to get closer to the phone. "Daddy, I love you! When're y' comin' home? I miss you!"
"Where do they come up with this shit?" he muttered and scrolled down the article a little further, stopping when he came to a 'quote' from Avengers team member, Clint Barton.
He sighed and moved over to the door, and he switched off the lights and made to go back to setting up his easel, but as he picked up the canvas, his fingers flexed around the framed cloth, and he suddenly found himself desperate to head back upstairs, something inside him screaming at him to go and see his family. Oh, it wasn't anything portending danger, he thought as he set the canvas back down. Just...some desperate need to see Tony — to put his hands on Tony and feel him in his arms and assure himself that Tony was, well, real and here.
He took a sharp inhale of breath and used both Steve and the mattress as a counterbalance to push himself to his feet, grunting out the breath, and he reached down and took the baby out of Steve's arm and shuffled over to the rocking chair. Taking care to cradle the baby and sit down as gently as he could, he settled into the chair, Steve turning back to watch his every move, an eyebrow slightly raised in question.
Tony waved him off. "Don't worry about it. It's fine," he said, even if his body argued rather voraciously with him.
to go through it. Every time he thought he came just a little bit closer to accepting what had happened and what was happening to him, it felt like he fell five steps back right after that.
"I told you. It doesn't matter." He dug the spoon in and shoveled another taste into his mouth. "He was only with me until he could get his old life back. Well, Howard's dead, and Peggy's in a nursing home with dementia, but
"Uh, yeah, sure, kiddo," he replied because what the hell else was he supposed to say? It seemed to work, but the kid's face clouded over a bit at that, her eyes narrowing and a little crease forming between her brows as she pursed her lips.
"You expect me to believe over seventy years later that Hydra is still around? That the Red Skull is still alive? That we still have to deal with them?" He shook his head. "No dice. Not on my watch." He set focused eyes on Tony and squared his jaw. "I don't know what your aim is, and I don't know who exactly you're working for and why, but you tell your superiors that so long as I'm here, Hydra will never win this fight because I will never stop fighting them. Even if I'm the only one left to do it."
"Oh, I know that," Bruce said. "That's why I asked. It's an early sign— If you had told me that it just started this morning, I would have said you probably have days to go—"
, uh... I don't think you're ready for that, so why don't we just say yes, we have a daughter. Olivia Louise. Named for no one but herself because we couldn't agree on the order of our mothers' names. Flipped to a couple of random pages in a baby book Barton threw at our heads because he thought we were arguing too much. Like I said, sixteen months old and stubborn as a mule. Or her father. Same thing."
Did she really think he might willingly do this a second or a third time? OK, to be fair, she had no idea who he was, but
The assembled group went silent at that — either contemplating or looking for an excuse to run or trying to make sure their phones were recording everything, he couldn't tell — before one brave soul towards the back said, "So…are you like that forever now?"
He stopped, not bothering to wait until Bruce told him so, knowing that that was as far as he could go at that moment, and he relaxed back against the arms that supported him. Natasha again murmured to him that he was doing well, and he smiled lightly in acknowledgement at that and let out a breath, closing his eyes and trying to drum up the last reserves of strength he'd all but spent.
Tony just waved him off again. "That's what I have you for. You can give me the Reader's Digest version of things. Now, get out of here before I make you sit down here and help me."
He sat up and clutched at his chest, unable to breathe. He tried to suck in several breaths, but he couldn't seem to get his passages to open, and he sputtered and gasped and threw his legs over the edge of the bed and leaned so far forward that his forehead almost touched his knees.
Rhodey just shook his head in disbelief. "This is… You know, I expected this from at least half — if not more — of Tony's other lovers, but you, Cap? I really expected more from you."
The little girl had scrambled off the couch and was back over at the gifts. Sure, this was an odd ruse even by Hydra's standards, but if they were trying to trick Steve, throwing him into something like this, giving him everything he'd ever wanted, was a surefire way of buying themselves some time while they worked to better their weapons and, of course, take over the world. Isn't that what every bad guy wanted to do? When had comic books become real life? When had it become
Steve swallowed, and though his mind screamed at him to stop, to put an end to this before he got himself hurt, his heart pushed him right along.
"My parents died literally, like, a week before Christmas," he added and shook some crystals onto a snowman. "I mean, not that— We didn't spend a whole lot of time together anyway — not even during the holidays — but...it was still... I didn't want anything to do with Christmas for a long time. Tried to play it off like I was too cool for it or something, but it wasn't..."
Steve just shook his head, but he dropped his arms and went over to grab the clothes. He went to hand them over, but he held back at the last second and instead pressed his face close to Tony's. Tony rolled his eyes at the puckered lips, but he still kissed his idiot of a husband anyway and received the bounty of clothes in return.
She shrugged but didn't seem particularly proud of herself. "I did what I had to in order to get what I needed. And for the record, I'm talking about both."
"Yeah, yeah," he grumbled but closed his eyes, and he exhaled a deep breath as he heard Natasha let herself out of the room.
He reminded Bruce when he saw him in the kitchen while he was stealing coffee and a bagel (Tony was stealing; Bruce was sitting and eating something he thought came out of a box labeled 'Kashi'). Bruce made a face and said he would probably be coming down with the flu that night. Barton, who was coming into the kitchen just as he was making his way out, hedged a bit and said he'd
Tony looked up, and to Steve's surprise, a smile broke out over his face. "Hey." "Waiting for someone?"
"Hey! Tony, hey!" Steve said, and Tony blinked and shook his head and only then realized that he was literally shaking — with fear, with anger, with desire, he didn't know. He clutched at the edge of the tabletop and took a sharp intake of breath to calm himself, and Steve said, "Honey, it's OK. It's…OK. We'll deal with what happens as it comes. Just… It's OK. I understand. I want— I want that, too. I want what I saw that Christmas. I want hot chocolate and presents and Captain America and Iron Man pajamas—"
Tony had no doubt in his mind that this was his daughter — that this was the same Olivia that had come crashing into his life years earlier — but there was one surefire way of proving that this was her.
Natasha drove him over to the restaurant in the R8 because a) she insisted that Tony couldn't drive over himself and b) Tony suspected she really just wanted to take the R8 out for a spin. He let her, told her not to rack up too many miles on the car, and then walked into the restaurant, biting his lips to keep from grinning at the pretty obvious looks he was getting. He was used to being admired in his other body, but this was the first time he'd had strangers doing it to
Steve merely blinked at him, and his jaw fell open as he tried to think of something — anything to ask—
He must have ignored them for far too long because the next thing he knew, Natasha was leveling a serious look at Bucky and telling him to be on his best behavior tonight.
So, Steve talked. About everything. About what had happened after Barnes had fallen from the train; about what had happened when he'd put the plane down into the snow; about what had happened about when he'd woken up nearly seventy years in the future.
"Is it?" he asked with faux-innocence, and Steve dared to glance up from his menu for a moment before he swallowed and averted his gaze.
Still, something about it didn't sit right with him, something that, if he was being honest with himself, hadn't sat right with him from the start.
He shoved the last bite of food in his mouth then went about scraping the plate, and everyone was quiet as he did so until Barton said, "So, did you ever agree on whether it should be 'Sarah Maria' or 'Maria Sarah'?"
Thor frowned like he didn't believe Barton's assertion, but Wilson piped up, "It's true, man. Chicks and dudes alike dig the god of thunder."
Tony motioned to a clearing just off the road. "If you'd really rather not wait, there's always that.
"But that doesn't mean that you aren't the absolute most important person in my life, and I swear on my life, I will make you believe that or die trying. Because it's the absolute truth. Because I've never met someone that could get under my skin the way you did from the moment I met them. I've never known someone that I could just share a look with and they'd understand every single thing I was thinking. I've never known someone that can read my mind the way that you can."
Tony stared at him a moment more before he moved over to the stove and began to take the cookies off the sheet and set them on a cooling rack.
"Don't mention it, babe. I got you covered." He picked up his own menu and opened it. "God, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse."
Tony screeched as Steve went for all his weakest and most vulnerable spots — his ribs and under his arms and behind his knees. He squirmed and squealed and tried to fight him off, but his laughter betrayed him, and somehow, he found himself on his back against the spread of pillows, Steve over top of him, looming over him as he methodically hit every single one of Tony's weakened defenses.
One that had come back to life and shoved his ridiculous hotness into Tony's face every time he turned around, but still, a fantasy and nothing more. What had made him think that he was even good enough for someone like Steve? Someone that deserved so much more than what life had given him — than what Tony could give him.
Steve finally tore his eyes away from the baby to look up at him. "Yeah, but compared to us, she's tiny."
He reached around and fastened the collar around Tony's neck, and Tony closed his eyes at the scintillating touch of leather against his throat, those particular muscles of his anatomy clenching once again as Steve finished clasping it. He felt Steve take his wrists and gently pull his arms down to his sides, and after he had, he put his hands on Tony's shoulders and slid them down his arms.
Barnes shrugged and reached out to grab another slice of bacon. "'Cause I'm not telling people to watch their language like some old grandma." He sat back and bit halfway into the slice, and he crunched on it before he pointed what was left of it at Steve and said, "You know, there really is a time and a place for that."
"Really?" Barton muttered and looked at them like they were all a bunch of traitors. "Oh!" he said and nodded. "I get it. It's 'cause they're in the room, right?" He motioned to Steve and Tony and added, "Don’t want to bite the hand that feeds you. Got it."
married someone just because Rhodey didn't approve of them — though, to be honest, it would probably have given him pause — it was nice to know that Rhodey, at least, accepted and approved of what he was doing.
“I don’t think it’s that bold at all,” Steve counters, and he knows that adoration is thick in his throat.
Crunching gravel under hesitant footsteps. The belated slam of a car door. Honeysuckle perfuming the thick air. It’s the definition of picturesque, a tableau worth scoffing at, but he politely refrains for the moment.
“I suppose this is an afterlife of sorts,” he says as they start down a well-worn footpath, so defined that he would wonder how it came to be if there was any point to wondering. “Tony said it’s as real as it gets, so I assume it hasn’t gone away yet. I’m guessing it works - well, how does it work?”
“There aren’t so many babies anymore,” Elliot says, soft-spoken as he trails after his sister. “They’ve all grown up.”
Steve heads south until he smells salt in the air and finds a small but clean motel on the beach when he knows he’s nearing the end of his endurance. Along with his room key, he’s handed a coupon for a half-priced appetizer at the local seafood shack. He discovers he enjoys the soft-shelled crab and the crisp beer that the waitress recommends, and she doesn’t seem to recognize him, but she does bat heavily-mascaraed lashes at him. It’s simple and meaningless, and Steve smiles because having someone smile back makes him feel okay for a fraction of a second.
“He needs to learn to handle the kid on his own, anyway,” Sam says. “With Pepper moving back to California - ”
He sits for what feels like hours. The sky darkens slightly, still enough to see by, and the air grows humid with a chill that aligns with a distant rumble. Before the first drop can fall, footsteps so quiet they wouldn’t disturb an ant come upon him. Proof that his senses are as intact as ever, Steve thinks, as his other self comes to sit beside him.
The funny thing, he recalls distantly, looking into the rapidly darkening steel-colored distance as he breathes needle-pointed air, is that seven years ago, he would have been more than content to be blessed with an afternoon of Tony’s attention before leaving it at that. If he hadn’t ever been left with a gaping question in the middle of his memory, he thinks he could have moved on and, if chance had permitted their meetings the same way it has, then he wouldn’t have cared. He would have never tortured himself to this end; would have never allowed himself to want more than this, to think that all-or-nothing was the answer.
“I could put in a good word for you,” he offers, and Tony pouts for as long as it takes them to finish eating. Then he’s forced to stop, mesmerized by the way Steve licks his fingers sparkling clean.
They hug, awkward but fierce over the middle of the car, and if Steve forgets himself and holds too hard, Tony doesn’t say anything.
The way it’s never even when he’s awake, unconsciously dancing around the same way Tony does when he’s on the move. Steve knows it will eventually even out before slowing down, turning to the softest snores that barely even count as such. For now, he just measures the length of each inhale, and knows it’s short enough that he won’t do too much damage if he speaks.
He hadn’t realized how much he was counting on Tony making an appearance. Steve knows exactly when it’s supposed to happen and so far everything has happened as it should. It makes sense that this universe is so similar to the one he’s come from, but suddenly, the uncertainty drowns him.
He can’t focus on that, he decides, but then half a dozen phrases pop into his head, and he’s stuffing giant bites of horrendous breakfast down his throat all while typing furiously into his laptop, fingers striking the keys with a ferocity and passion that he hasn’t felt in years.
Tony comes close, and just as Steve thinks he is about to continue his path of figure-eights, he falters.
“Behave,” Denise says then, finally stalking across the room to the stairs, like a cheetah after its prey. “We’ve got kid ears everywhere.”
“My turn for what?” Tony asks, nonplussed as Steve snaps the waistband of his sweatpants into place. “Refusing to use the bathroom as the changing room it was intended to be?”
“You should meet everyone,” Tony suggests - orders, really, and Steve coaxes the emotion to climb higher so it coats his insides. “Could be a good opportunity. Help flesh out the context of the piece, and everything.”
Steve just gives Denise his best smile, the one that calms all the kids and charms all the donors and never seemed to work on the people who had mattered the most.
“Thanks for swimming with her,” Tony says. Morgan’s in the back, playing on a tablet and verging on cranky as her bedtime approaches.
Tony calls and Steve tells him about texting with Sam, who is over the moon about finally being able to keep in touch with some more consistency. They compare stories about the goings-on at the compound, figuring out where the truth has been stretched, and Tony exaggerates just as badly as Sam does. Orange juice has been banned from the premises after an altercation involving Red Wing and a visit from Peter Parker, and there’s minimal twinging in Steve’s chest cavity when he laughs as Tony defends Peter’s honor and claims that Barnes had been just as guilty.
The other Steve’s stories had sounded a bit like something out of a horror movie, if Tony is being perfectly honest. He’s still grateful the recounting of events hadn’t given him nightmares.
“I wasn’t sure,” Steve says, and he’s so rarely unsure that Tony needs to put a stop to it right this instant.
His heart aches, and he’s reminded of why he doesn’t like to remind himself. The band grows tight, and he doesn’t register Howard speaking at first.
As it is, by the time he’s up in the penthouse for the night, the only thing he’s got to show for his hard work is an address in D.C. and a sliver of damning evidence from JARVIS.
“I’d just rather not make a drunken fool of myself on the job again,” Steve says, feeling the need to cushion whatever blow he’s landing. He tells himself that it’s nothing, that it’s just a tiny chink to Tony’s gargantuan ego, but Tony flashes him a tiny smile that feels like lying and failure all wrapped up into one miserable package.
But that second doesn’t come, and Tony just disentangles their semi-joined hands so he can cradle Steve’s face fully, preciously, kissing like he means it and owns that meaning. Steve lets it happen, lets his knees fall open and his body go pliant as he gives himself over to soft lips covering his. Tony knows how to kiss, all dragging slow with the right amount of distracting tension so that Steve isn’t properly aware of how eagerly he’s kissing back until his knuckles clench with how tightly they’re locked in the freed tails of Tony’s shirt.
“Okay,” Tony says, a palm to Steve’s chest and goddamn he’s solid. “Either kiss me like you mean it, or tell me what the hell is going on.”
“Easy to say that now. That’s what he said to me when I went to see him, you know. I told him that I wouldn’t have gotten mad at you for not telling me about my parents, and he told me I could only say that because you already had.”
It’s fascinating, trailing kisses from Steve’s neckline up to his earlobe and cataloguing every little twitch beneath him. Tony darts back down, tugging at the shirt to expose more skin continuing along his collarbone.
“You’ve been a wonderful husband,” she tells him, still mostly lucid but weak and occasionally forgetful. “I wouldn’t change a single thing about our life together.”
“Sorry,” he says for the third time. “Christina scraped her knee, and well, I guess you know what a six-year-old with a skinned knee is like.”
“I will not be an accompaniment to your booty calls,” Sam says, and Steve promises with an extra-wide, extra-genuine grin.
