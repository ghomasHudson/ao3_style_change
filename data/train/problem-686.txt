Sherlock scoffs, glaring up at his brother whose false grin falters a little, his eyes slipping away from Sherlock’s gaze as Sherlock turns back to the tarmac below him, wishing that the earth would swallow him up.
“What came before this, what we used to be, maybe what even you used to be. Did you know that you were a captain in the army John?”
It doesn’t take a genius to give an accurate response and Sherlock returns John’s pronouncement with a soft smile as he whispers back:
He admires his attire for a moment, the mismatched combination of wrinkled white T-shirt and posh jet-black pants. He should really change out but he can't be bothered.
“You’ve been so brave Sherlock, so brave and selfless and kind - that’s what makes you beautiful,” he finishes, planting a final kiss on the nape of Sherlock’s neck as the man shivers, “So gorgeous.”
“They’re the sharpest I have ever seen,” John cups Sherlock’s cheek with his palm, stroking the outline of the bone with his thumb, “Do you know how ethereal you look in the dark, when we’re out on a case and all that’s there to light us in lamplight? You look like a fucking model.”
Sherlock, look don’t panic. It’s not like it’s your fault that he’s back... So you didn’t check then?
His chest is crusty, covered in drying, white come, his thighs too, surprisingly. It seems John didn’t do as a good a job of wiping him up as he thought.
“You’ll be safe, right?” Sherlock questions instead, blurting out the words in what he hopes is well disguised anguish as he searches John’s eyes for an answer, a sign… anything that will give him an inkling about what the hell John is about to do.
It doesn’t take him very long, something tells him that John is rather experienced in this area, and soon, his whole shirt is off. John flings it in the direction of the laundry basket. Sherlock’s not sure if he manages to get it in or not.
The tension only mounts as they pull up to Baker Street, Sherlock’s veins singing every time he turns to look at John.
“Would you like to come for lunch tomorrow with Mike and I?” he repeats, fixing Sherlock with a broad grin. “I promise you that it’ll be fun… and cheap.”
“I’ve let you go in the past,” John starts, voice carrying an undertone of annoyance, “but you really do need proper nutrition, especially after all the weight you’ve probably lost in the hospital.” He raises his voice slightly at this, not loud enough to be threatening but loud enough to sound cautionary. “That portion wasn’t even that large for crying out loud so Sherlock, god help me. Finish. Your. Dinner.”
However, if John were to be honest with himself, he’s doing it more so to keep his mind off the dog tags.
He extricates the petri dish from the spidery mesh, transferring it to the sink before proceeding to clear out the fungus, grabbing it in fistfuls and dumping them immediately into the bin.
There’s a moment of abject shock that all people experience when they’re about to be hit by an oncoming object. It’s a deer in the headlights moment. Sherlock knows it all too well, after all he’d just experienced it slightly over an hour ago. It’s a moment when people stand absolutely still, eyes wide, unable to do anything, surrendering to the possibility of imminent pain. This is the look that John currently has on his face.
And just like that, a glass of water had appeared out of thin air, materialising just above his palm, as if waiting for him to make a grab for it (which he did).
John collapses onto him, his body shaking as Sherlock cards his fingers through John’s silky blond hair.
John gives a prolonged sigh, raising his head to the sky, blinking several times before turning to face Sherlock.
John seems to have come to a similar conclusion. His hands are trembling, shaking as he turns the package over.
“JOHN!” Sherlock all but yells, his hips bucking forward into John’s fist as he spills onto his lover’s chest, his eyes squeezed shut as he collapses onto John, completely spent as water sloshes about him.
The man smiles weakly at him in answer, gingerly picking up his spoon before proceeding to toy with his food, rearranging the rice before scooping a sample into his mouth.
And it hadn’t felt necessary at the time. John had still felt some apprehension at pursuing a relationship with Sherlock, fearful of rejection and the subsequent fallout because he did not want to lose this - this thing that they had going on, whatever it was.
So it seems that despite his pretty obvious declaration of love, John’s still willing to stay with him. Well... at least there weren’t any indicators that suggested otherwise. John has succeeded in surprising him once again, except that this time Sherlock doesn't know if he should be happy or upset about this.
He turns it over in his hands, admiring the way the gold lettering gleams in the sunlight before setting it down gently on his old bed, turning back towards the drawer and rummaging through it’s contents.
He hopes that John will laugh at the joke, the idea of naming his child after him as ludicrous a notion that Sherlock has ever come up with. However, now that Sherlock’s given these thoughts a voice, it seems like someone else has used these exact same words before…
“She had backup, called some of her men over to help her get out of the house. We managed to incapacitate two of them… But unfortunately, Mary Morstan managed to slip through our fingers.”
Anyways, what had he spared Mary for? She’d never called an ambulance that day, she’d meant for him to bleed out onto the ground, dying in John’s arms as he watched on pitifully so that she could make her escape.
All he has to do is immerse himself back in the Victorian world. Yes, that’s it, that’s all he has to do.
“Morning John,” Sherlock sighs happily, a hand curling around his shoulder to rest in John’s hair, “Or should I say, good evening.”
John sighs in response, already used to Sherlock’s over-dramatic nature. He fishes out a notebook and pen, preparing to take down as much of Sherlock’s imminent monologue as he can.
He rubs the conditioner almost lovingly into his hair, taking deep care to avoid the roots. Sherlock purrs softly in contentment, smiling at John who mimics him with a goofy-looking smile of his own.
“Yes, darling,” John murmurs, his tongue following the outline of Sherlock’s lips just as he crooks the three fingers inside of Sherlock, thrusting them up into the heat of Sherlock’s body…
Mycroft did offer them a place at a safe-house down in the country but Sherlock would rather wait for John’s input on the proposition before getting ahead of himself.
Sherlock remains silent so Mary continues, “Do you really think that this is what's best for him? Living with a flatmate who is well known for cocaine addiction and destructive tendencies?” Sherlock is still keeping mum, except that he's now gripping the armrests with such force that he thinks the leather might tear, so Mary goes on, “This isn’t like the old days Sherlock. John has a family to think about right now. He has a wife and a child. Don’t come in between him and what’s best for him.”
Judging by the layout of the level, his only safe way out would probably through the door he came through. The window seems promising but it’s a three-storey drop and he’s not prepared to deal with such theatrics just yet.
He pulls apart the plastic lock, emptying the contents of the bag out onto his bed, sending the bottle of pills rolling off towards a corner.
“That’s why you hate me so much, not just because I was the one standing in the way of you rebuilding your network… but because you thought that I’d stolen him from you.”
“That’s nice,” John replies, smiling up at Sherlock even as something dark and vicious starts to settle in his belly.
His breathing eventually slows, his body relaxing as he slumps against John’s chest. He relaxes his grip on his jumper, John’s fingers continue to card through his hair.
John smiles up at him in response. His eyes are an iridescent blue, a gentle gradient that goes from dark blue at the tips of his irises to sparkling cerulean at the base.
Sherlock giggles a bit more once they've reached the sanctity of their flat. It’s ingenious really, several disgruntled students pouring salt onto the field in the shape of a sad face to spite their principal. When John had described the look of anger and shock the principal had had on his face when he had discovered the huge frowny face lined with dirt where the grass had once been, Sherlock had had to grit his teeth to stop himself from laughing too hard. He wishes he’d thought of it himself honestly, when he was back in uni. Well, it’s too late now.
He’d considered calling Mycroft up and begging him to watch over John before Mrs Hudson had come in to tell him that if he were to continue like this for the rest of the afternoon, he was probably going to wear a hole in a carpet.
“Well, I’m friends with you, doesn’t that count for something?” he says, the corners of his lips upturned in a cheeky grin.
“He’d been a dancer once as well, not a professional danseur but a dancer all the same. He used to do ballet in university for recreation and he thought that I could do the same or even better.”
“Poor old Sir Eustace,” he tuts, making his way over to the far end of the living room. “He got what was coming to him.”
“I’m fine,” John replies, left hand visibly clenching and unclenching, which basically means that he’s lying too.
Sherlock’s hair is standing on end, goosebumps erupting out of his skin. How the fuck is he going to cover this one up?
“John, you do know that she’s right, right?” he says earnestly, “Sherlock really does adore you and I’m not sure anything could ever really change that.”
“David this is extremely important,” he begins, intoning the words calmly as David lifts his head out of his palms.
His eyes make another circuit of the room before he turns to his side, his eyes settling on a familiar, wan face
Taking the bowl from John, he gives the man a reassuring grin as John tries to manage one of his own in return.
“Please tell me you didn’t dissect them,” John interrupts, his eyebrows furrowed as he stares up at Sherlock.
He used to go to John’s room every now and then, making his way upstairs every time he had a particularly hard case and John wasn't free. It'd been far easier to conjure John up in his mind palace in that room than anywhere else in the flat, surrounded by John's familiar, still lingering smell and the accumulated detritus he’d left behind from the 2 years that he’d lived there. Despite this, the John in his mind palace had only been an adequate sounding board, nothing more, nothing less. His imaginings had always paled in comparison to the real John, whose opinions or responses had always been unexpected and stimulating.
John suddenly stops mid-sentence, his face taking on a ghostly pale colour as he fixes his eyes on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock frowns in confusion, turning to stare at the spot that John is looking at and oh, oh no.
Sherlock’s eyes shoot wide open in response, his breaths picking up as John gulps, turning his eyes away from Sherlock’s.
John focuses his energy on the dog tags, willing the metal to morph and smoothen. However, unlike any other object in the universe that John has lived in for so long, the dog tags refuse to budge.
On the one hand, he’s been hoping for this for ages, hoping that John secretly wanted him and desired him, hoping that one day John would come back to him. And yet…
They’re silent for a moment, each one of them staring resolutely at the ground refusing to make eye contact.
“No, Sherlock,” John replies sternly, interrupting Sherlock in turn. “We’ve been together for two months and I know evasion tactics when I see them.”
He fiddles with his phone for the better part of half an hour, scrolling through news feeds and old messages from John.
There’s no time for lubricant, no time to go slowly so John swirls a thumb around their leaking heads, using whatever precome that’s there to pump them both over the edge.
“You’ll be notified once her contractions start?” Sherlock queries as John lowers his hand, clutching the card tightly to his side.
“FUCK JOHN,” Sherlock yells, shouting loudly as his hips snap up off the bed, his body bending forward as he digs his fingers further into John’s skin. It’s probably going to leave a mark but John honestly doesn’t mind.
At this, John yawns, burrowing under the covers. Sherlock follows suit, drawing the duvet up to his chin.
From Mary’s point of view, it would seem like John had been shirking his duties as a loving husband and a father. As far as Sherlock knows, John hasn’t had any contact with Mary since the altercation at the clinic and he clearly doesn’t wish to. He hasn’t been keeping tabs on her pregnancy and most definitely has not been keeping tabs on the baby.
He enjoys the sensation of warm water beating down against his bare skin, reaching up to thread his fingers through his hair to massage the shampoo into his scalp.
“You’re fucking gorgeous,” John breathes, his lips leaving Sherlock’s in favour of licking a long stripe up the shell of his ear. Sherlock shudders in response. “Absolutely beautiful-”
The air in the room seems to thicken, a dense, syrupy ocean that washes over the two of their bodies, settling deep in their bones.
And what of his marriage? What if John finds out that all through the time that he’s been semi-intimate with him that Sherlock has been pining after him, wishing that they had been something more than friends. What of his marriage then?
“Yes, of course,” Victor smiles, shuffling over to John’s side as Sherlock follows suit, “How close by do you think we are?”
And his rugby teammates have all stood up, their phones all flickering to life as some hop over the diner table while others still have the presence of mind to file out slowly from the booth.
Sherlock’s eyes fly wide open as he reaches for the bedside drawer, pulling out a bottle of lubricant. He uncaps the bottle, squeezing its contents liberally onto John’s open palms as the man goes back to work. And this time, Sherlock’s hips buck wildly off the bed, rolling upwards towards the pressure of John’s hand.
He remembers watching the slow heave of John’s chest, resting his palm gently on the curve of John’s hip to reassure himself that he was really here and that this wasn’t a dream before maneuvering himself back down, curling up next to John as sleep pulled him under once again.
Oohoooo ;) I guess we all know what's coming next chapter HAHA. Tune in in... one or two weeks? We'll see how this goes.
The next chapter is when things really start to get personal and when we finally get Sherlock and John interacting as they should be. Stay tuned for the next update :)
I'll try to get the next chapter up by next Sunday but I have an internship this week that leaves me with lesser time to write so it might take longer than expected...
“Bet you slept extremely well last night after slamming a door in my face. What an excellent way to say goodnight!” Mrs Hudson continues, viciously stirring a cup of tea that Sherlock now believes to be his.
And to top it all off, John had fallen madly in love with him over the course of their first week of living together.
“Yeah, sure thing,” John answers, tracing the ‘Watson’ block letters on the jacket that is still adorning Sherlock’s torso.
To be fair, John has never been particularly good at lying, in the sense of hiding facts (With the exception of the museum tickets… That was ONE TIME). John gives too much away through his body language, making his true motives transparent with the twitch of an eyelid or the clenching of a hand.
He lets the sentence trail off, the implication not lost on John as his brow furrows, staring down at Sherlock in confusion.
He’s never seen Sherlock this hungry before to be honest. Sherlock tends to deny himself food, ignoring his stomach for long periods of time, mostly because his “body is just transport” and his transport “cannot function after ingesting large quantities of food”. However, ever since John has moved in with him, Sherlock has improved. He’s improved
It turns out that Sherlock had indeed left an experiment there to rot before he got shipped off to the hospital.
“You spent half the day lazing about in bed and watching clips of “Britain’s Got Talent” on your mobile phon-”
He relaxes at the touch of John’s hands as John rubs the shampoo into his skin, cupping his palms every now and then to draw water out from the bath, pouring it gently over his head. Sherlock closes his eyes, savouring the sweet, alternating pressure on his scalp and the feeling of warm water cascading down his cheeks as he inclines his head towards John’s, smiling softly at him.
“Take a seat won’t you,” he says, eyeing Sherlock as he pulls out a chair, moving to sit. John follows suit.
Sherlock turns around, feeling utterly lost and terrified. He knows that this conversation will hurt him, that John’s next few words will be sharp enough to strike him down. But, if it makes John happy, or gives him closure, then Sherlock will oblige him.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock inclines his head sluggishly towards John’s, his brow knitted in a slight frown.
Sherlock had been sitting at his table just as he’d entered, engrossed in work before the loud clacking of the door had gotten his attention.
He scrambles for his phone, reaching for the electronic device before typing out a quick message to John.
“It’s just that I heard some yelling and I wondered if-” she continues, “if you were in any trouble of any sort?”
The water is still running, which would normally have given Sherlock some cause for concern, but the splatters from the spray alternate between soft and loud, suggesting that John is at least moving in the bath.
“Alright then,” John replies, turning into a pathway leading to Regent’s Park with Sherlock following close behind him.
The kiss had felt uncomfortable and unwelcome, as if the contact had turned his nerves to ice, extending freezing cold tendrils that had reached deep beneath his skin, chilling him to the bone.
He loves them, god he does. He loves them in low-slung pyjama bottoms, the bone just peeking out of the tattered cotton and he loves them especially after sex, when the sides are bruised and marked with his fingertips. God...
Sherlock is drawn to John’s voice, charmed by the sonorous articulation of his name. He doesn't realise he's moved any closer till he bumps noses with John, watching him with his eyes wide as John licks his lips, a swift swipe of his tongue against chapped skin.
He finishes with the buttons, slipping his shirt off with ease before tossing it in the general direction of the laundry bin. He has absolutely no idea what to do now. Should he turn around and face John? Or should he wait for John to make the first move?
“Did you just drug my pregnant wife?” John almost yells, his eyes fixed angrily on Sherlock who’s pottering around the room.
, Sherlock thinks. Something about the tone of John’s voice, the utter vulnerability and humanity of it strikes something deep inside of him... Because John can’t be unhappy because of him, not again.
They’d both thought of showering together, the latent fear of either of them losing the other hovering around the edges of their consciousness even as they’d stepped into Mycroft’s car. But, they had decided against it, preferring to actually get clean.
“It has come to my attention that John Watson has returned to 221B Baker Street,” Mycroft begins, levelling his gaze at Sherlock.
“Look, Sherlock. I haven’t seen you in literally a month and then you barge in and spend 6 consecutive days here. There’s clearly something bothering you,” Molly says, her eyes fixed on Sherlock as he turns away from her in favour of examining a sample on the far side of the table.
“Sounds like a change I’m willing to accept,” Sherlock smirks, ducking his head down for a chaste kiss.
She flashes him a wide grin, pleased as punch at her son’s best friend’s politeness while simultaneously despairing the fact that not enough of John’s mannerisms have rubbed off on Sherlock.
“We might have to talk through some things first though,” John mutters as he starts the engine again, “And boy, I do believe there’s quite a lot to get through.”
He groans, using his hands to spread Sherlock’s butt cheeks wide as his tongue darts out, licking his way down Sherlock’s perineum down to his arsehole.
There’s silence for a moment, the room still but Sherlock can tell that John is thinking, thinking hard. He can practically hear the imaginary cogs in the man’s brain clunking and creaking.
“Damn it, Holmes,” Watson says angrily, possibly annoyed at Sherlock’s evasion, “You are flesh and blood. You have feelings. You have... you must have…”
“And I’ve wanted you for, god for so long. Since before Barts, maybe from the first time I met you, I really don’t know. And it hurts, oh god it hurts so much to be so close to you and yet not together with you at the same time…”
Mrs Hudson had obviously anticipated their return because there’s a silver tea tray on the kitchen table. It contains a plate filled with puffy crumpets, an assortment of jams and two cups of still steaming tea.
Sherlock obliges, clutching the brown envelope like his life depends on it as he reaches for a penknife, cleanly severing the adhesive as he pulls out the contents of the package.
“For the sake of Mrs Hudson’s wallpaper,” Sherlock starts, ignoring his subconscious, schooling his face into a cool expression, “I must remind you that one false move with your finger and you will be dead.”
He watches as John taps the screen, bright white light stealing the colour away from his face before his face visibly darkens upon reading the Caller ID.
Dust swirls in rising columns, sparkling in the morning sunlight as he raises his violin to his chin. He lifts his bow, resting white strands of rosined horsehair on silver strings.
It’s just his subconscious, barging in and bombarding him in his drug-addled, weakened state. Nothing more-
His heart is racing, he can hear the muffled “lub-dub” in his ears in the quiet of the room and oh boy, this isn’t good because John’s going to notice. He has his hand right over his heart for God’s sake.
“Whenever I called that boy up, it was always John this and John that. Before you came along, he barely ever spoke about his day to day activities! Just talked my ear off about Chemistry! I mean, I’d listen to him, of course I would, but Chemistry was never something I was interested in,” she smiles and says, “I was always more of a math person.”
Never in a million years would Sherlock have thought that Mary would have dared to have pulled this stunt.
He exhales sadly, shaking his head as he lays a new set of sheets down on the bed, tucking in the corners neatly (as John would’ve done) before arranging the pillows neatly.
“Mary was the last person to be here,” David answers, “Before she came… I mean… She was also the last person to be here.”
“So you’ve figured where the signals are being transmitted from?” John pipes up, materialising by Sherlock’s side.
Sherlock cries out in response, the bulge in his pants visibly engorging as his hips jerk up off the bed.
“Sorry?” Mike apologises, even though he’s not particularly sure what he’s apologising for, “but I think I’m missing something.”
“NO,” John yells, his voice piercing the silence of the room as he shoves his chair away, standing up abruptly. He holds his hands up close to his ears, his fists clenched as his chopsticks clatter to the floor.
It hadn’t been intentional, honestly. It was just that he had needed something to distract himself, something to prevent himself from drowning in a merry-go-round of speculation and conjecture. Because, really for all he knew he could have misread the situation, extrapolating the evidence once again and reading too much into John’s actions.
John seems to be completely ignoring the topic of Sherlock’s affection for him… which is to be honest quite worrying.
“It was apparently an almost weekly thing?" Lestrade goes on, stoically ignoring Sherlock's tells of impatience. "The landlady apparently visited her every other week, offering her food and whatnot."
He’s hard, has been hard since he woke up to be fair. Morning wood and all. And as John thrusts upwards, his hips aligned with Sherlock’s, it seems that the man is in a similar state.
But John is different now, they’re both different now. John’s married and he has proven to be extremely loyal to the ones he loves. Which means that Sherlock has to thank Mary for the fact that he will no longer get any intrusive thoughts of a very naked John having sex with a very naked woman.
The bathtub is big enough for one person to lie in, possibly two if called for. And thankfully, this hotel provides bath salts. That’s always a plus.
Sherlock’s cheeks redden as John peers down at him, his eyes zeroing in on his groin and he has to fight the urge to turn around and shift it out of view. He’s more self-conscious than he thought he would be.
He leaps out of bed, rushing to change out of the previous day’s clothes into a set of fresh pyjamas (to make it look like he’d actually slept in proper attire). He slips on his blue, silk dressing gown. The one that hangs light on his skin like gossamer-thin spider webs, before tiptoeing out his bedroom door into the kitchen.
“Stop saying that, I’m not beautiful,” Sherlock pulls away from him, the loss of body contact leaving John bereft as his fingers slip out of Sherlock’s hand. “My legs are too thin, my face is too weird-looking, my back is covered in disgusting SCARS-”
Regardless, Sherlock will be there when the man shatters. This time he will be there to hold him through it. Not like before, not like how it'd gone after jumping off the roof of Barts.
He worries the skin there with his lips for a moment before biting down hard, eliciting a moan from Sherlock as he pinches the spot over and over again with his teeth, certain that it’ll leave a mark there for everyone to see.
His sister Harry had ever tried, dragging him off to gay bar after gay bar, but somehow each trip seemed to end with Harry getting drunk and John having to drive her home.
The bullet races towards the “him” on the floor, John yelling with all of his might at “him” to get out of the way as the bullet makes contact with his shoulder-
Sherlock sighs, reviewing the information several times over before giving it up as a completely hopeless endeavour. Hopefully, Mycroft’s security will be able to protect them for the time being while his brother struggles to extract information from any relevant parties.
“Congratulations,” Moriarty’s voice rings out through the sound of thundering water, “You’ll be the first man in history to be buried in his own Mind Palace.”
Sherlock flashes Victor a bright grin before turning to John. “Do you want to come along?” he questions.
Sherlock grimaces at Moriarty’s words, his eyes screwed shut as Moriarty strikes him in the chest with a powerful blow. He forces himself not to scream from the sheer force of it as Moriarty moves to stand up.
“As if our lives weren’t any less interesting before either of them came into the picture,” he says, nuzzling into John’s shoulder.
“I can drive you guys to the other side of campus if you want!” he hollers, “It’ll probably be faster.”
“Doesn’t matter,” John replies, “Mycroft’s orders. Oh and when you’re done, go and nap for a bit. Mycroft and I will get some things sorted out in the meantime.”
The door swings open, revealing a rather dishevelled and rather out of breath John Watson. His eyes are ringed with dark circles, the furrows and creases there deeper than before (probably due to the time spent staying up taking care of Lily).
Sherlock shudders in John’s arms, his back arching off the bed as John unwittingly strikes the bundle of nerves within him, setting off sparks behind his eyelids.
“We’ll solve crimes, have fights over body parts in the fridge, chase each other down dark alleyways, things probably won’t change all that much,” Sherlock shrugs, “We’ll be fine as long as we’re together.”
Sherlock’s skin prickles, his eyes shooting wide open as he immediately launches himself away from John, burrowing swiftly under the blanket so that only his head is visible.
John’s body is slumped forward, his head on the ground with his fingers still curled around his gun.
“Sherlock,” John chuckles, pulling away from Sherlock’s neck, cupping his love’s cheeks, “That was the best day of my life. Honestly, seeing you again… coming back to you was the best decision I’ve ever made.”
He brushes the thought to the back of his mind, huffing in annoyance as he moves his fingers down to John’s thighs, stroking the muscled surface there lovingly as John whines softly, his eyes going dark as he relaxes further into the bath, his chin now just above the surface of the water.
It’s now his turn to smirk as John’s jaw drops open at Sherlock’s little improvisation. His gaze is full of abject wonder, of shock and delight and Sherlock preens under the attention, a motion similar to that of a peacock ruffling its feathers proudly in the presence of a mate. He smiles arrogantly down at John, watching as John regains his composure, his lips now upturned in a self-assured smile.
He does it one more time before switching off the flame, shifting the pan so that the omelette slips cleanly onto a plate next to the stove.
“Manners matter, Sherlock!” she snaps, “And especially at my age.” At this, she grabs Sherlock’s cup and saucer, slamming them down onto the table. A dribble of tea spills over the rim, pooling in the saucer.
But then, John picks up his pace, his hand moving even more vigorously as he brushes his finger over the crown of Sherlock’s cock, swirling it firmly over the tip and it’s far too much. Far too much and Sherlock shouts, pleasure overtaking him as his cock pulses, his body shaking as he clings onto John, riding out his orgasm.
Mycroft raises his eyebrows, looking at him with something akin to surprise before he nods his head, beckoning Mary and the two security guards to follow him.
The weight of this newfound knowledge seems to be too much for John to bear because the man has sat himself down next to Mycroft, looking extremely lost.
“But still, I’m happy, overjoyed even. I can’t explain the feeling really,” John shrugs his shoulders, pressing a giddy kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, “I feel like I shouldn’t be but-”
“John, we both needed it…” he murmurs, raising a hand to John’s cheek, cupping it gently, bringing John’s eyes down to meet his, “After all those years… We needed… that.”
He’s a little surprised that he’s actually smiling in the picture, a rare occurrence in any of the early photos his mother had taken. It’s a radiant toothy grin, filled with joy and exuberance.
“We can't let the chef miss out on his own cooking can we?” he chuckles as he transfers half of the omelette to the spare plate. “You can have your cake and eat it too you know.”
He lets his smile fall the moment he’s certain that she’s no longer looking, gazing disheartenedly at the ground as Mary leans into John’s space.
“So I chose Mary… I chose her,” he continues, soldiering on bravely, “Because she was the ‘better option’ but now I see how wrong I was… It started… At the wedding, before we went off to dance. Because I took one look at you and realised that god, I wished it had been you who I’d been married to and-”
It had kept him sane, kept him from accidentally revealing anything he hadn’t wanted to. The only time he’d ever let himself go was on the night of their last practice session, when John had moved pre-emptively to grasp Sherlock’s back, keeping his chin a safe distance from Sherlock’s shoulder as he directed Sherlock around the room.
John smiles in answer before dropping his gaze. He grins down at the ground instead, working his jaw a little as he makes a gnashing motion with his teeth.
“Sherlock hey… sweetheart,” John whispers, pressing another firm kiss to his lips, “I’ll call. I’ll text. I’ll do anything in my power to get back here, to get back to Baker Street. I promise-”
“You said the bleach bottle had no fingerprints on it,” he starts, pointing at Lestrade, “which is suspicious because obviously the two women would have needed to have handled the bottle for them to have killed themselves right?” He extends his hands towards Lestrade whose eyes widen slightly and continues. “The other curious feature of this case is the fact that there is a lack of discolouration on the red bedsheets,” he says, pointing to the offending item, “As anyone who handles bleach knows, unless one is extremely careful, the liquid ends up anywhere. If the women had taken the bleach from the bottle, as the lack of cups seems to suggest, there is bound to have been a spillage of some sort, none of which is evident here. The bedsheet is still in pristine shape. Hence, the bleach bottle was placed here after the women died.”
He remembers loving the stars too. Yes, he had loved the stars as a child, when he was young and there was Redbeard. He remembers Mycroft building a treehouse on the old oak tree in the backyard one day, remembers Mycroft wiping the sweat from his brow as he informed a delighted Sherlock that the treehouse was his belated birthday present. He climbed the ladder every night, heaving Redbeard up in a pulley Mycroft had installed that had, at the time, been meant for the lifting of wooden planks for the construction of the treehouse.
“Yeah, Mycroft told me,” he says, “Said that at one point you wanted to become a pirate when you grew up.”
Meaning, that he’ll still have the privilege of looking after John for the foreseeable future. He’ll have to convince him somehow that the truth of the matter is that Mary is a better long-term companion than his dangerous, druggie flatmate. But, he still has the responsibility of ensuring that John is comfortable and happy during this period of separation from his spouse and
“What kept you?” he murmurs, watching as foamy bubbles pop and burst on the surface of the bath, prickling his skin.
“You really don’t remember much do you?” Sherlock hums, “Seems like the coding has gotten entangled with your memories, messed them up a little so that you only know what the programme was coded to...”
It’s currently a little after seven in London and the sky has darkened to a rich obsidian, a black canvas airbrushed with faded, grey clouds. The streetlights have all come on, glowing bright in the crisp, chilly air.
“The setting is a shade melodramatic,” Sherlock quips, ignoring Moriarty as he gesticulates at the waterfall, “Don’t you think?”
“You’re the most beautiful, most gorgeous… MINE,” he bends his head, licking a line up the column of Sherlock’s throat as Sherlock trembles, his body shaking as John turns his attention to his collarbone instead, biting down hard.
And if they dance and John’s suspicions are confirmed (because John clearly already suspects something), what will happen to their friendship? Will he be able to salvage it?
“Also,” Sherlock continues, dumping the bag of recycling onto the floor, “Judging from this man’s character, you should probably find receipts for both bleach and vodka in here.”
So John’s still there, he’s still there, which means that Sherlock hasn’t gone mad and conjured up some hyper-realistic mind palace version of him. But if all of that really happened, then why isn’t John leaving? Wouldn’t he have felt embarrassed by Mrs Hudson’s intrusion on their privacy and her insinuation that they were a couple? He is still married to Mary, so shouldn’t he be angry at Mrs Hudson for suggesting that he was unfaithful and committing infidelity?
“Sherlock,” John starts, his voice carrying an undertone of anger, “You really aren’t in a good position to argue right now.”
“You didn’t expect me to turn up at the scene of the crime, did you?” Moriarty drones, smiling up at the ceiling.
Well, maybe he had been, at one point. Maybe before Barts, maybe before all this mess started, Sherlock will allow himself to entertain that possibility. But now that Mary and his baby have been thrown into the mix...
“What was it? What was it? What was that case? Huh? D’you remember?” Moriarty slurs as Sherlock lifts his hands to his face, cupping them over his cheeks.
“Yes I have,” John replies stiffly, his voice sounding a little colder than normal. “And I’ve brought the thumb drive as well, just as you requested.”
“This close! And what if I had done it! What if- Look I even told you that you were ‘mine’. How horrible can I get?”
Sherlock, you know it’s more dangerous for me to be back there. I’m sorry, I wish things could’ve been better too.
“Sorry Mrs Hudson,” John chokes out, clearly struggling to get his giggles under control as well. “We’ll try to be more quiet next time.”
He finds himself keening the moment that John’s tongue makes a reappearance. It’s like a pavlovian response really, because his brain seems to short-circuit from the anticipation alone before the man even licks a broad stripe up the roof of his mouth.
“We just saw each other a little over an hour ago,” Sherlock protests, fixing his brother with a dark glare.
His passageway convulses, vibrating around John’s cock and John shudders, seeing stars as he thrusts one last time, seating himself as deeply as possible as he spills into his lover’s body, his cock twitching as he rides out his orgasm.
Sherlock lifts his head, meeting John’s stern gaze. John’s face is solid as granite, his eyes a deep cobalt as he extends a hand towards Sherlock, wiggling the tips of his fingers as if to coax Sherlock into taking up his offer.
“Do you have any idea how beautiful your cock is,” John bends down, nuzzling against the root and inhaling deeply. It smells like sweat and sex and Sherlock and oh isn’t that the headiest combination…
That’s it, he thinks to himself, that’s the end of even pretending to be remotely civil to Mary when he’s not in John’s presence. He’s done with her, done with her lies…
John growls in response, a rough, animalistic noise that goes straight to Sherlock’s cock. He reaches around John’s shoulders, fingers digging into John’s shoulder blades as John leans in, licking his way up Sherlock’s neck, rough tongue prickling against smooth skin.
The flat resides in a simple brick-layered complex, about 5 stories high. Sherlock notes that a flat on the third floor has its door wrapped in yellow police tape and makes for the lift.
“Hey you,” John mumbles, burying his nose in Sherlock’s hair and inhaling deeply, a hand coming to wrap around the chain of dog tags circling his collarbone.
“Good,” reads the text he receives as he walks briskly out of the lift, turning the corner to the waiting room.
He watches as David stiffens, his hand freezing in mid air as he reaches for the tissue box in front of him. He seems to hang there for a moment, his body trapped in some cruel limbo… And then in the blink of an eye, he breaks, his facade crumbling as his eyes begin to well with tears.
Distracted, John decided to take Sherlock’s reaction as first time jitters, giving into Sherlock’s ministrations as he pressed the man back against his pillow, his fingers tangling in the man’s hair.
“Well… He said that they were friends from secondary school,  that Victor was insanely intelligent and horrendously rich and… and to top it off he had a dog! That Sherlock LIKED!”
He bows his head, his thoughts racing even as they’re simultaneously weighed down by a horrible sense of brutal finality.
After all that he’s done… all that they’ve been through, John still loves him. John still cares for him. John is amazing, wonderful…
Sherlock’s hips practically fly off the bed in response, his erection brushing up against John’s thigh as John pulls off, wiping his lips with the back of his hand as Sherlock shudders.
I’ll thrust forward slowly, pushing merely the head in until your cries become too much and I push all the way in, holding onto you as I slap my hips up against yours, fucking you like an animal till you come.
Sherlock turns to face the door. Mrs Hudson is standing at the threshold of 221B Baker Street in her nightie, looking positively worried.
Slipping an arm under Sherlock’s, John tugs him closer, his fingers skimming across his sweat-slicked back.
“Sherlock I understand that this might be a sensitive topic for you,” John begins tentatively, his fingers still encircling Sherlock’s wrists, “And if it really is that sensitive, I won’t press it. But truly, I’d prefer it if there weren’t any secrets between us. Remember what happened the last time either of us tried to hide something from each other.”
John makes his way forward, winding his arms tightly around his madman, smiling as Sherlock stills. He can feel Sherlock’s heartbeat through his ribs, a steady lub-dub that quickens just as the man has the presence of mind to shut off the stove.
He’d bared his whole soul to John, told him the truth about his scars and even why he’d faked his own suicide. It’d hurt to speak of these things aloud, to have given his nightmares a voice once again. But still he’d told the truth. John however, John is still refusing to tell him the real reason why he wishes to go to Harry’s.
“No, no I don’t,” Sherlock mutters, shifting around in John’s loose grip, scooting further away from him.
He reappears with a small medical kit, ushering Sherlock into the bathroom as he unwraps the plasters and pulls up the antiseptic cream. He reaches for Sherlock’s hand, closing his fingers around his palm gently in a slackened grip.
Honestly, all of this could have been made infinitely more bearable if John could just remember something… anything?
Sherlock looks an absolute mess. His hair is in complete disarray, his cheeks streaked with saliva, his chest flushed and his lips a bright, cherry red. That and the jacket is really starting to do him in…
“I am your WEAKNESS!” he yells, kicking Sherlock straight in the head, the impact causing Sherlock to cry out in pain.
He relaxes, allowing his tensed up muscles to slacken, his body sinking deeper into the mattress. His breathing slows slightly as his body begins to shut down.
“I love you,” Sherlock mumbles, pressing his lips to John’s as John does the same, suckling sweetly on his bottom lip, “I love you so much-”
Because meeting and getting to know Sherlock had felt like finding something that John hadn’t known he’d been looking for.
He has just enough time to hook his coat on the rack before John is on him again, kissing him as if the world is going to end.
Sherlock turns away from the window, his elbow resting on the armrest as he pivots himself to face John.
And then Sherlock starts giggling, laughing at the absurdity of it all because how did they end up here really? Why are they even dancing too geez this is ridiculous.
Strange, he’d expected it to have been a photo of John and Mary. This photo is way too old for that.
And… all of that. The kiss… the mind-blowing sex. God, Sherlock’s never experienced anything like that before, never wanted to experience anything like that before. But now that John’s introduced him to it… Sherlock wants more.
John then turns his attention to where they’re still joined, pulling out with a soft squelch, shifting back so that Sherlock’s legs fall to the bed, limp from overuse. He zeroes in on Sherlock arsehole, as if trying to see if any damage has been done. However, all that ends up happening is his softening cock twitching a little at the sight of come spilling out of his lover’s entrance.
“But it doesn’t matter, it’s all in the past now,” Sherlock finishes, turning towards John with a forced smile.
He waits till John stops giggling before continuing. As much as he hates for John to be jolted back to reality, time is of the essence here.
“Oh Sherlock, Jim really was right about you… you’re so… predictable,” she chimes in, reaching for his cheeks and cupping them tightly before letting go.
He blunders about for his phone, the bright screen flooding his vision in the darkness of the room as Sherlock sighs, waiting till his eyes get used to the change in lighting.
“I believe you,” Sherlock answers, fumbling slightly with the words as he trembles with the force of the love and trust that he has for the man standing in front of him. “I believe you, John.”
He runs his fingers through the row of necklaces adorning the tiny shelf space to the right of the store. The pearls and chains feel like silk beneath his palms, the clinking of metal resounding through the store as the necklaces fall back into place in the wake of his touch...
They lie there for a moment, trapped in a bubble of their own making, stuck in a reality where there is only John and Sherlock and Sherlock and John. Sherlock allows his consciousness to narrow down to the sensation of John's fingers in his hair, finding bliss in the simple movement of John’s skin against his.
Sherlock curls up into a ball, his knees coming to rest against his chin as thoughts whirl haphazardly, untamed by logic, through his head.
Sherlock’s flush seems to deepen at John’s touch, his cheeks turning tomato red... Or maybe John is imagining things again.
He doesn’t finish, doesn’t need to really, because John understands anyway, levering himself downwards so that he rests comfortably on the bed again.
“Oh my god! That’s why you were so late!” John manages, struggling to stop himself from giggling, “You were catching Pokémon weren’t you!”
“I wasn’t really doing much… I kind of blanked out,” Sherlock explains sheepishly, “You were doing most of the work. I should’ve probably-”
And it’s too much, too much to look at John and see the physical evidence of the hurt and pain that his best friend had experienced the night before - and under his hand no less, so Sherlock darts back into the bathroom, locking the door soundly behind him as he makes his way back to his bed.
Sighing deeply, Sherlock sits up, listening to the click of the shower and the sound of rushing water as he reaches for his dressing gown, slipping it onto his naked body.
Sherlock is punch drunk on endorphins, his eyes glazed over as John licks his way up to his ear, nibbling the lobe gently. Sherlock sighs, relaxing back into John’s grip.
Sherlock and John stick firmly to their sides of their shared seat, sitting as far apart from each other as they can manage. Sherlock can feel it, an invisible wall growing in between them, a bubble of tension, a product of words unsaid, ready to burst. He fiddles with his fingers uncomfortably while John faces the window, streetlights ghosting past his worn features. He looks deep in thought and Sherlock notices that his left hand is trembling.
They had had to put in extra cabinets to fit in all of John’s clothing and clutter, the bedroom now strewn with signs of a shared life. Sherlock had converted John’s old room into a laboratory, fitting it with a mini sink along with the old fridge from their kitchen (they’d bought a new “untouched” one), finally giving John the clean blood and bacteria-free kitchen he’d always dreamed of.
“You guys go ahead!” Lestrade yells, pinning Cameron down, whose face is now mashed firmly into the table. More officers are arriving (clearly they'd been called to standby before the interrogation had begun) so John and Sherlock make for the door.
“Steep temperatures, yes, high temperatures burn the tea leaves, leaving behind a bitter taste that is highly unpleasant so a suitable temperature is most definitely necessary for a perfect cup of tea. This, of course, depends on the type of tea leaves, such as-”
“FIX IT,” she bellows, charging off to the left side of the room, leaving Sherlock gaping where he stands, rooted to the ground in shock.
He pauses, burying his face in his hands again as Mike sighs, setting John’s phone down on the table.
“I went to him to seek help over the Mary situation,” John explains, exhaling in exasperation, “Look, Sherlock, I really don’t love her anymore and if I could’ve I would have divorced her the day I found out that she shot you.”
“Well…” Sherlock chokes after a moment, “To remember, all I did was… follow a trail of memories, starting from the latest memory I could conjure up. Maybe… that might work for you?”
Sherlock stares after him, his heart sinking even as he admires John’s side profile, watching the way that lines of old age have cut into his skin, the way the sunlight brings out the blond streaks in his ash-grey hair.
“I’m fine,” John sighs, holding on tightly to the handles of Sherlock’s chair, tugging forcefully to right it, “I think the question should be. Are you okay?”
John gazes up at his partner, finding the man looking a little stricken at John’s blue expression, shaking his head vehemently in answer.
I’d pull down your pyjama bottoms, your cock springing free as I take it in hand, pumping it up and down.
He gestures to the backseat, opening and shutting the door for Mary as Sherlock makes his way to the front seat, tucking himself in and strapping himself up.
“JOHN,” he calls, still tied to the chair as he tries his best to angle his body towards him, “JOHN ARE YOU ALRIGHT?”
John seems to ponder over his words for a bit, his expression slightly dazed and confused before he sets his jaw, looking extremely determined, as if desperate to flesh out as much of a conversation as is possible in the short time they have left.
His and Mary’s words echo back at him as he lies there in the darkness, chasing down endless threads of thought that don’t seem to lead anywhere.
Oh god it’s bad enough that his brother knows that he’s taken the drugs, but the fact that he seems to be gunning for a reveal in front of everyone else is ten times worse.
“It’s getting a bit late though,” John continues as he stoops to pick his bag up, “What say I finish unpacking and we go out for dinner?”
“I can tell you still want to mark me, make me yours, show the whole world that I belong to you and you alone-”
It had been no surprise really, considering Sherlock’s bad experience with rugby players. But after that first dinner, his rugby teammates had really made an effort to reach out to Sherlock, even during school hours.
“Well, she apparently doesn’t want me in the room for most of it, asked me to leave so that I wouldn’t have to see her in pain,” John rolls his eyes, “Not sure if she’s trying to be accommodating or if she really doesn’t want me in the room.”
“John told me that you used to be a drug addict, told me you used to use them to take the edge off. So I thought that maybe, given the circumstances, you’d require some to calm your nerves.”
“However… by killing Magnussen, you’ve wholly wiped out Mary’s main reason for keeping a low profile,” Mycroft interjects, shifting his hand to pillow his cheek as he gazes at Sherlock forlornly, “Now, she can return to Moriarty’s network and considering the fact that she was quite high up in the ranks, it’s possible that she will be able to jump start the whole operation on her own again. She’s clearly started some groundwork, taking into account that nationwide broadcast of the now deceased Moriarty’s face.”
John chokes at this, sniggering as Sherlock smiles back at him affectionately, a warm smile that is quickly masked by indifference when Sherlock realises that he’s looking at John like a lovesick teenager.
John truly had a soporific effect on him it seemed, seeing that he had somehow managed to sleep for seven hours, three nights in a row, without interruption. There hadn’t been any more nightmares, no more dark shadows that dulled the edges of bright dreams that now seemed to greet Sherlock every time his head hit the pillow.
John nods his head in thinly veiled astonishment, arranging the final set of table forks as Mummy Holmes dries the glasses, setting them down on the table.
John eventually breaks eye contact, chancing a glance down at his watch, smile faltering slightly as he stares at the white digits.
Sherlock sighs, flopping back onto the bed. His mind is already racing, the cogs and gears in his brain turning at a breakneck speed because:
Why does his brain have to do this every single time he likes someone? Well, to be honest it hadn’t been this bad for his ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends. For his past relationships, he’d been able to shut his thoughts up with a singular “no, fuck off” to the darker side of his brain and then everything would have been fine. However, with Sherlock… It doesn’t seem to be working.
“I can’t believe I found you. God, I thought you were gone. That I was going to be alone forever and-”
He lifts his hand up to inspect them, rotating his slender fingers as blood drips in spirals, translucent streams that trickle from the cuts in his skin.
After searching for a few minutes, they’ve found lots of food containers that have not been properly washed before being thrown in, accounting for the disgusting smell emanating from the bin, and lots of newspapers, but nothing that could have held liquid.
“That’s the whole problem!” John almost yells, throwing his hands up in the air, the gesture catching Mike off guard.
Sherlock had flushed red then, melting into a stuttering, bumbling mess till John had reassured him and told him that “it was all fine”.
He must know what they're here for, Sherlock thinks as John greets the man, asking him whether they can both come in.
Sherlock does as he’s told, leaning back against a pillow as John proceeds to extricate a torchlight from his medical kit. He crawls onto the bed and kneels on Sherlock’s right, lowering his face till it’s inches from Sherlock’s torso. Little puffs of warm breath ghost over his chest as John sets to work, carefully and meticulously examining the stitches that are currently the only thing holding his skin together.
“Oh and I brought this too,” he continues, holding up the bottle of wine for Mummy Holmes to see. “Merry Christmas Mrs Holmes!”
“It’s nothing John, really-” he starts, his cheeks going red as John stalks towards him, shaking his head.
But John shifts his head just so, slotting his lips against Sherlock’s, short-circuiting his brain with the sensory overload.
Sherlock had sighed, making his way to the bathroom and escaping through the connecting door there instead, desperately hoping that John wouldn’t wake as he’d traipsed past his best friend’s still slumbering body.
They can’t change their past. In fact, even if Sherlock had had the chance to go back in time… he’s certain he wouldn’t have changed a thing.
There are men on the rooftops, unclear figures morphing into the bodies of people as they run, fleeing from some unknown terror.
When he finishes, he fixes Mycroft with a withering look, waiting for his brother to correct him. Obviously something is up because his brother hadn't interrupted him once throughout his one-person diatribe.
She’d been surprisingly calm about the whole thing, as if she’d predicted it and had expected this to happen at some point…
“Well I want my husband back where he belongs of course,” Mary continues, voice sharp and edging on sinister, “But he’s definitely not going to listen to me.”
Giggling softly in reply, John flexes his fingers in Sherlock’s grip, shaking his head as he buries his nose in Sherlock’s hair, nuzzling into the nest of curls there.
“What are we looking for again?” Lestrade queries upon coming face to face with a menacing looking recycling bin that appears to be three-quarters his height.
Sherlock rolls his eyes in annoyance, a bit miffed as he overtakes John, making his way towards the brick mansion in long strides.
He balls his hands up into fists, bringing them upwards to rest firmly against his forehead, chasing the sensation of John’s forehead against his own away. He feels that bubble of hope popping, a spark that fizzles and dies in his chest because no, John does not like him in that way, no he DOES NOT. He can’t, he can’t possibly… ever.
John nods his head in sympathy, forcing down burgeoning feelings of jealousy as he shifts off his chair, setting himself down next to Sherlock.
Mycroft’s voice had gone cold and stiff at this, his face devoid of emotion as it shifted swiftly into a mask of indifference.
He bets John likes that... And he’s not wrong because the moment he turns to face the man, John’s already giving him a heady gaze, his eyes raking up and down his thighs and Sherlock has to stifle a giggle.
John gifts him with a chaste nod, beginning to piston his fingers in and out, sliding them out slowly before pushing them back in again gently.
He’s been waiting for this, itching for them to kiss again - but John had seemed so tired, he didn’t know if he would have been-
“Oh good!” Sherlock replies. “That’s very good.” He finishes with his fingers steepled under his chin, his steely gaze meeting Cameron’s rather determined one.
They complete another circuit before John signals to Sherlock that he wants to try something else, his eyes gleaming as he lets go of Sherlock’s hand, Sherlock holding on for dear life (almost, well sort of) as John spins him out of his grip, drawing him back in smoothly with a gentle tug.
The man’s chest eventually stops shuddering, his sobs reduced to wheezes, his previously tear-soaked eyes now red-rimmed as his face falls onto Sherlock’s chest, tired and defeated.
He’s colossally fucked up his best friend’s life simply by existing, single-handedly ruined John’s marriage and family and-
He reaches out to grab John’s sleeves, shaking his arms in the hope that his friend will somehow come to his senses.
“Oh Sherlock,” he says, entwining his fingers with Sherlock’s once again, “That was then… But you, you’re my whole world now.”
Sherlock can’t help but chuckle softly, amazed by how much power John Watson commands with just that voice. And at that height too, god.
He’s orgasmed at his own hand before of course, but this? This is so very different. It’s as if fireworks have exploded behind his very eyes, his chest set aflame with tongues of fire and Sherlock is wholly taken aback by it, his body still shaking as he comes down from the high, his eyes still screwed shut.
“What’s the matter with you this evening?” Sherlock intones, glaring darkly back at him as his friend raises an accusatory finger, pointing it at Sherlock’s watch.
When Sherlock emerged two hours later, John had chalked it up to possibly something else that he had said, excusing away the situation.
“I knew you were ticklish!” John chuckles as Sherlock doubles over with laughter, “You look like the sort.”
“Are you one hundred percent certain that John and I are in danger?” Sherlock prods, watching Mycroft carefully.
Sherlock listens carefully for John’s footfalls, waiting till the soft padding fades to the muffled crackling of bedsheets before letting out a deep breath he didn’t realise he’d been holding.
How could Mary have done that to John again? How had she managed to pass him that driver without even batting an eyelid? Surely she must have had felt guilty at some point!
Shafts of light stream through the rotting wooden roof, colouring the ground in fading pools of deep amber as Sherlock makes his way up the stairs, his footsteps measured and slow as the sun continues to set.
On the third morning however, Sherlock had woken up hours before John, blinking sleepily as his eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness of the room. He remembers fumbling a little to sit up so that he could check what time it was. Instead, he’d been greeted by a sight so ethereal that at first he thought he might have been dreaming.
He remembers ages ago, their positions reversed, when it had been John who was soothing his nightmares away, tethering him to reality.
John takes control of the kiss once again, angling Sherlock’s jaw to one side as he plunders Sherlock’s mouth with his tongue, the pink muscle stroking the walls of his mouth roughly as Sherlock shudders, his legs nearly giving way as his tongue hangs limply in his mouth, unable to reciprocate as John strokes another long line up the roof of Sherlock’s mouth, sending his brain completely offline.
“Don’t be,” he murmurs as he hands John the mug and the sandwich, the man gazing up at him with a deep sadness before reaching for both items, chugging down the tea (even though it’s probably still hot) as his other hand clenches around the steaming sandwich.
He’s fixing up the takeaway when his phone vibrates, the device buzzing as he makes a dive for it, desperate for news.
John’s kisses feel like fire and ice, strong and powerful in their intensity, burning into skin wherever they make contact… and yet… Sherlock doesn’t feel scared or uncomfortable, not like before.
“How very interesting,” Sherlock continues in a lilting tone, “Don’t suppose you’ve ever heard of a Sheryl Kilgrave then?”
“I… I…” Sherlock feels absolutely ridiculous. He’s gaping like a goldfish, struggling to come up with an appropriate response but the words won’t come.
He squints, watching as camouflaged gunmen appear over the village’s rooftops, looking on as people scramble away from the scene of terror, yelling and screaming.
John slips his middle finger in, sliding it past the furled skin and Sherlock moans against his lips.
Sherlock sighs, laying out the entirety of their visit to David’s place for Mycroft, finishing off his explanation with a huff and an “Interesting how you never thought to check the place yourself dearest brother.”
“Carrying on from there,” John continues, interrupting Sherlock’s thoughts, “I came to Mycroft to seek help over the Mary situation. However, I clearly got more than I bargained for.”
“I don’t believe you’ve ever mentioned a Victor before,” he says, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible.
Sherlock stumbles blindly in John’s direction, doing anything he can to prevent the separation of their lips. However, his efforts go to waste the moment his knees hit the edge of the bed, his eyes widening in surprise as he falls onto the mattress, John tumbling on after him.
“And you might want this,” Sherlock whispers, handing John a condom packet and lube, “I don’t mind if we…”
Me: nope haha. nah I prefer longer chapters. like I only break if it sounds better if I break them up
He makes his way to the door, his umbrella hanging lightly on his forearm almost perfectly, leaving zero creases on the well-starched fabric.
“Hmmm…” John hums to himself, taking great joy in the flush spreading across Sherlock’s cheeks, “Now for your cheekbones.”
Sherlock smiles in response, the corners of his lips upturned as he mulls over Watson’s remark. Clearly the man wishes to start a conversation to assuage his boredom… He might as well humour him.
“Good God!” Watson yells, making to rise from his seat as Sherlock flinches, Watson’s voice shaking him abruptly out of his thoughts. He turns to face Watson, watching as his friend’s face begins to pale, his eyes widening in unbridled terror.
“Did you know,” he starts, his voice a bit muffled by Sherlock’s hair, “That Mary didn’t even give me the chance to name her?”
Reacting instinctively, Sherlock does the same, his hands reaching to grab onto John’s shoulders, tugging him tighter into his embrace, keeping him there.
“It seems fine,” John announces, jerking Sherlock out of his internal moral crisis. John’s left arm coming up to swipe away the sweat from his forehead, “It seems like the doctor who treated you used dissolvable stitches… so we don’t have to bother with removing them. That aside, your wound does seem to be healing quite well, you should be-”
It’d been the right thing to do and yet, his heart feels empty at the thought of never getting a chance to say those words out loud.
Sherlock gulps, wondering whether he should turn back now and spare John or if he should be honest with him.
“But let’s be clear on this one thing okay,” he raises his index finger accusingly at Sherlock, “this one simple thing - I did not mean for Jemima to die.”
So, Sherlock is going to have to ensure that John makes the correct decisions that lead him towards what’s best for him. He will not come between John and his happiness. He will most certainly not intervene for any selfish reasons.
When the last throes of orgasm ebb away, John groans, his arms giving way as he collapses onto Sherlock’s body, their chests meeting with a thump, winding the two of them.
And even though he's broken, a dead man in every sense of the word. There is one thing that he is - that he can be, just for John. And that's a miracle maker. He rises from the ground, a phoenix reborn from ashes.
“Sherlock, it was the best I could do under the circumstances,” his brother had said, “I do believe that you’ll make it through and I promise you that I will do all I can to ensure this mission’s success…”
The chain glimmers in the fluorescent light as Sherlock turns the metal pieces over in his hands, feeling the coolness of the steel against warm fingers.
Sherlock rolls his eyes in annoyance. “Of course Mycroft told you,” he says, shaking his head. “Can that man ever keep a secret to himself?”
Now that Sherlock thinks of it, they’ve not discussed anything concerning her since the incident at John’s clinic. In fact, this is the first time either one of them has spoken her name aloud in days, as if simply mentioning her name would summon her somehow.
John pauses for a moment, stopping in his tracks, as if considering Sherlock's proposition. He raises tired eyelids, giving Sherlock a once over before closing the space in between them, planting a quick kiss on Sherlock’s lips.
He turns to face him, Sherlock taking in the slump in John’s shoulders, the broken look in his eyes before John buries his face in his neck.
There’s a blackened hole where his brain should have been, the ridges of the wound rough and puckered.
He sighs, knocking on the door without much preamble as John catches up with him, his heels digging firmly into grey gravel as he makes his way to Sherlock’s side, his hands in his pockets.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock insists as John follows him into the kitchen, both of them taking a seat in their respective chairs. Mrs Hudson has already laid out a breakfast spread for them so Sherlock grabs a plate from the aluminium tray, stacking a few pancakes onto it.
And they’re kissing again, lips and tongues meeting in an elaborate dance as they sink deeper into each other, drunk on the sounds and feel of each other bodies.
Sherlock moans at the sensation, the sound unconcealed and unrestrained. It's unlike before, when they'd been in bed together and he'd bitten his lip to stifle any unbidden embarrassing noises, when he'd struggled to keep his desire for John a secret.
, John thinks to himself as he dips Sherlock at the end, like they’d done so before when Mary had still been around. Except that this time, when John lifts Sherlock back into his arms, Sherlock kisses him - without fear, without hesitation, without restraint.
“Sherlock you bastard, you said you came down early to help,” John chuckles softly, the sound coming out a little strained.
The warmth of John’s fingers, however, are a stark contrast to the cool of his skin. So when John begins to draw patterns once again onto the scars, the dips and creases of mangled tissue on his back, Sherlock feels them all the more strongly, as if John’s fingers have left fiery trails across his body.
He knows John’s physical cues like the back of his hand, knows this man’s body far more intimately than any other person he’s ever known.
“I should’ve killed you the moment you stepped into this room,” she utters simply, flicking the safety off and setting her finger on the trigger.
“There’s always two of us,” Watson answers, his voice crisp and clear, loud and confident. “Don’t you read The Strand?”
He thrusts his tongue up into the heat of Sherlock’s body once more, slowly retracting the muscle before pushing it in once again-
“It was only then that I allowed myself to dwell on the thought of you without any reservation and that’s when I realised that I was quite… hopelessly in love with you.”
Falling in love with John had been a scarily slow process. John had stumbled slowly yet surely into his heart, worming his way through his veins the more time he’d spent with him. Sherlock had wrapped his head around the intricacies of John’s personality, delving deeper into John’s heart and soul as he sought after an answer to the mystery that was John Watson, ignoring what his “obsession” was doing to him himself.
“The man was getting too dangerous, that much was clear after he’d committed that mass break-in. His network was getting too extensive, he had to be stopped. What we hadn’t planned for, was Moriarty killing himself. We'd initially planned on capturing him after he threatened to kill you."
He groans further as John slips a finger in between his cheeks, stroking the furled skin there, gently.
“I never said I had any issue with you leaving,” Sherlock retorts, reaching for a knife which he plunges almost immediately into the stack of pillowy discs, slicing his pancakes in half.
John’s breath hitches, his cheeks going slightly pink before reading Sherlock’s gaze and turning his face away as Sherlock pulls off his boxer shorts, stepping toes first into the warm water.
“He probably wished to fit in with his newfound friends, his gang, probably even tried to dress the part. Hence, the shoes. He clearly wasn’t rich, this wasn’t a supplementary pastime, as indicative of the fact that if he’d really wanted the shoes so badly he could have just had them tailor-made.”
“Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don’t,” Sherlock says frustratedly, looking at Mycroft, silently pleading his brother not to pursue this course of conversation any further.
“David lives on the fifth storey,” John says stiffly, “And he should be home because I had Mycroft check for me.”
He keeps his face tilted towards the window, reading John’s suppressed anger in his harsh grip on the steering wheel, his frustration in the furrows of his brow. John is a volcano about to erupt and Sherlock doesn’t feel up to dealing with him when he does.
It had felt like all evidence of John’s presence in his bed had been erased entirely and Sherlock had buried his face back in his pillow, desperately trying to prevent his brain from jumping to conclusions on what that had meant.
“Good morning Greg!” John says cheerfully, moving to shake the inspector’s hand. Sherlock notes with immense relief that John’s posture is now a lot more relaxed and that he looks very much at ease. Thank god for Lestrade’s sudden appearance, Sherlock thinks to himself. He definitely has no desire to see John suffer through another intrusive conversation.
He’d been extremely disappointed when he discovered that they hadn’t been drawn to scale with respect to each other, but he’d used them anyway.
John is silent at this, as if musing over what to say. Sherlock sees him out of the corner of his eye, his jaw moving up and down steadily, his eyes still turned firmly towards the road and wonders whether John is actually going to say something or not.
He crams the vegetables and mushrooms into the chiller, working with a single-minded desperation to ensure that everything slots together perfectly. He gains a slight sense of accomplishment as he watches the food pile up, the main compartment of the fridge getting the same treatment (although most of it is milk and eggs).
He grips the handle of the gun tightly, his fingers unwavering as he raises his head to the high heavens.
He’d been so sure that the mission would succeed, that he’d beat Magnussen once and for all and save John and his marriage.
“Look… I… I don’t know how to fix this. But I swear to god, Sherlock, I will get my memories back and… and I’m certain when that happens, we’ll get to be together again.”
Sherlock growls, whipping back towards the cans, shoving the rest into the dry shelves like a man possessed. He leaves a packet of instant noodles out on the countertop so that he won’t have to retrieve it later for his own dinner.
John talks more of the time he spent wooing Sherlock, remembering the time that he brought Sherlock out to the museum, of how they danced together in the darkness of 221B, of how Sherlock had pushed him away till that fateful car ride back from Mycroft’s place.
“Well,” Sherlock begins, setting him arms down on the wooden table, “What I did deduce was that James Moriarty is dead, definitely dead, or at least the man is. Moriarty however? That isn’t.”
Sherlock groans in response, tangling his tongue with John’s, his hands jerking fitfully in John’s grip as he makes soft, wet whimpers that send shivers down John’s spine.
The cab’s engine revs, a loud, guttural spurt as it shifts away from the pavement, out onto the street.
But what on earth had he and John done to piss Magnussen off, so much so that they were, as Mycroft had put it, in grave danger.
“I’ll be back,” he breathes, tears similarly starting to form in his eyes as Sherlock coughs, his eyes still wet from the gravity of John’s gift, “I promise you. I’ll come back. I always will come back.”
It’s about half past eight now, the sky now a powdery coal black interspersed with the silver silhouettes of passing clouds. The only light they have to guide their way is the glowing park lamps that dot the gravel pathway leading them home.
He wishes he could hold the other man right now, cradle him in his arms and soothe his tears. There’s a sense of protectiveness that he’s feeling over Sherlock that he’s never quite experienced before, as if deep down, there’s a bond between them that John has never noticed or acknowledged.
John’s eyes dart downwards to the thatch of hair just below Sherlock’s navel, skimming across the dark hair and zeroing in on the engorged cock currently resting up against Sherlock’s belly, already red and twitching.
“...Why do you need to be alone?” John finishes, blurting out the words as if he’d mulled over the question many times before but had just never been brave enough to ask.
There’s a brown package sitting next to Billy the skull. It looks innocuous enough, just a little bit on the bulky side. It doesn’t look like it contains anything dangerous…
He pushes past Sherlock and strides into the room, rolling up his sleeves slightly as he heaves the chair towards the door. Sherlock has always admired John’s strength, and possibly his slightly muscular form, but oftentimes this admiration produces unwanted and unwelcome reactions... like right now. He can feel his face reddening like a cherry tomato and quickly makes for the kitchen before John can catch him blushing.
“NO!” Sherlock all but yells, startling John for a moment. “I... I’m free. I’m definitely free to go for the… the… thing.”
He can't take it anymore. He can’t. The past few weeks have been extremely emotionally taxing on him, draining his energy in ways that he could never have expected.
Sherlock snarls in response, the vibration coursing through John’s chest. He’s obviously starting to get a little impatient.
I really do hope that it is healing well. Please follow the doctor’s orders and make sure you don’t put too much stress on the stitches. Don’t want you ending up in hospital again.
John’s no stranger to waking up this late, his nightly jaunts with Sherlock once again commonplace now that Mary is out of the picture. It’s just that Sherlock always wakes up far earlier than him… and tends to get into some sort of trouble every time.
“Hopefully, if we’re lucky, we’ll be able to go back to Baker Street after all this is done,” he finishes, steering Sherlock down the stairs.
“Well I’m tired from all the work I did today,” John protests, grasping at straws as he rises from his seat, half-stumbling towards his bed. “I deserve an early night-”
Maybe Mycroft will find his crumpled body on the plane and extract it from his coat pocket? Maybe he won’t even make it to the airstrip. Maybe he’ll pass out in the car taking him there.
He’s still smiling as he steps into the shower, turning the tap and letting the hot water beat down against his skin.
On the fourth morning, John had been long gone when Sherlock woke up, the other side of his bed proving freezing cold when one of Sherlock’s feet had mistakenly crept towards the patch of bed that John had once occupied.
He’s interrupted by the steady trill of John’s handphone instead, the vibration startling him as John makes a dive for the mobile device.
Sherlock smirks, thinking about how he’ll probably have to shift his scientific equipment out of the way. The retort stand will probably have to remain there but all the organic chemicals will probably have to be shifted out, as will the glassware. He’ll probably have to disinfect the whole area first, come to think of it. He vaguely remembers the presence of an uncompleted experiment sitting on the top shelf somewhere to the right hand side of the cupboard. It’d been one of those biohazardous ones… yeah he should definitely get that cleaned up.
Thank god they’ve paid already, John thinks to himself as he follows his teammates out of the door reluctantly, still miserable.
I've planned it so that there should be three more chapters and an epilogue after this. So in total 4 chapters. I will try to finish the three chapters by 1st Jan but if I can't oh well haha. We'll see how it goes!
Sherlock barely stops for breath as he makes his way up the stairs, keeping up a constant stream of deductions as John follows from behind, nodding every now and then even though he knows that Sherlock isn’t looking.
“No, that’s- that’s pretty impressive, hardly uninteresting at all,” John reassures her, taking a seat as Mummy Holmes joins him, taking a seat opposite his.
It makes John really happy, seeing Sherlock like this, comfortable around other human beings. It really does spark a warmth in his chest.
John sighs, turning to face him. He gives him a look that reads “No, it really is.” before motioning to Sherlock to dip his head down, rinsing the shampoo out of Sherlock’s hair.
“The Bride put a gun in her mouth and shot the back of her head off and then she came back,” he starts, refusing to break eye contact with him.
He feels terribly excited, grinning slightly in anticipation of John’s reaction to his cooking. He’ll probably make it a four-course meal, he has enough money for it and enough time to cook after all. And he knows exactly what to do for the main course.
Sherlock views the scene before him, walking around the room for a bit before saying, “No, no and NO. Definitely not a suicide.”
“John take a deep breath, for me, please, John,” he breathes, struggling to keep his voice calm as John’s voice trembles on the other end of the line.
He roves his palm over the puckered mess of tissue as John takes a deep breath, his fingers dancing over the crisscrossing lines of scar tissue as he maps it out, putting it to memory.
He disinfects the entire area, including the shelves above and below, spraying it with solution mercilessly until the shelves are covered with foamy, glistening soap.
He stares back, eyes wide as Sherlock’s lips slowly leave his, his eyes fluttering open as he fixes John with mesmerising electric blue eyes, rendering John speechless.
“Why didn’t you dance with anyone at the reception… that… that night?” John struggles to say, his voice cracking a little.
It no longer matters to John though. Gone are the early days where John might’ve yelled at the man or stormed off in a huff to clear his head. Sherlock is who Sherlock is and John doesn’t want that to change, ever. Truth be told, they do still fight and John still corrects Sherlock every time the man messes up, but there’s now an underlying understanding that “no matter how much you screw up, I will still accept you for who you are.” And that makes all the difference.
“Well, thank god for that because without that time difference, I wouldn’t have been able to have gotten everything sorted out,” his brother answers self-assuredly.
John’s hand comes up to rest on Sherlock’s extended arm. He grips it tightly, squeezing a few times as if wanting to prove to himself that Sherlock is still there. He then lets go, allowing his hand to fall from Sherlock’s arm. It comes to rest on the stretch of bed in between them. Sherlock notices that John’s hand is now clenched tightly into a fist.
“But there’s still the baby,” he replies, the resignation in his voice palpable as he straightens up, looking John directly in the eye.
So Sherlock still isn't entirely sure if he's been fully forgiven, for the same reason that he's unsure of the reason now as to why John wants to go over to Harry’s place.
He stands and stares as the car trundles away, watching as it turns the corner, disappearing from sight.
He surrenders himself over to John’s lips the moment the man presses them against his, allowing John to guide him as he worries his bottom lip, fisting a hand in his curls.
He didn’t seem to be in any sort of danger, in fact, the room was completely silent, devoid of any noise.
Sherlock tries to collect his wits but John flashes him a goofy smile, wrenching another giggle out of him - which in turn causes John to giggle.
He rolls over onto his front, smushing his face into his still damp pillow. Why can’t his transport behave for once and give him just a few more hours of shut-eye? He lies there for another five minutes, screwing his eyes shut. It’s not working.
However, his countenance sours visibly after a few seconds, his eyes turning downcast as he sighs, handing the phone over to Mike.
“No, no he wasn’t. He was only there on the last mission, all other contact we had was through mobile devices.”
He waits till his breathing slows before slipping out with a wet ‘squelch’, Sherlock whining softly at the loss of contact as John slips off the condom, hurling it into the bin.
