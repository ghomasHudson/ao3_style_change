As we had to spend another day alone together, I took a short walk. After all, Norwich was a pretty little town and an outing could help to forget the turmoil for a time. I persuaded Mrs Nordon to accompany me. For some time I was pleased to have managed it, but oh, how much I would regret it afterwards!
Harry Watson: clearly a family member who has given you their old phone. Not one of your parents, this is a young person’s gadget. Could be a cousin, but you are a war hero who cannot find a place to live. Unlikely you have an extended family, certainly not one you are close to, so sibling it is. Now, Clara. Who is Clara? Three kisses say it is a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not a girlfriend. They must have given it to her recently—this model is only six months old. Marriage in trouble then—six months and it is already given away. If they had left her, they would have kept it. People do it—sentiment. But no, they wanted to be rid of it. They left her. They gave the phone to you that says they want you to stay in touch. You are looking for cheap accommodation, but you are not going to your sibling for help: that says you got problems with them. Maybe you liked the wife; maybe you don’t like the drinking.”
"Mm, half an hour of feeling your muscles stop working, from the feet up, knowing you can't do anything to stop it until it finally reaches your heart." Sherlock sipped his coffee. "Mind you, half an hour is more merciful than three days."
So, he faked his voice, just like his identity. If one had just really listened to him one would observe his faultlessness; and one would have deduced that his reputation, fortune and background had been forged by his intelligence.
“It was one case, John. One could even say that no crime existed in the first place, as your grandfather staged his own death. He was getting on in years, and as he lived practically on his own, no one could truly confirm the state of his health. Further, I assume you inherited your talent for storytelling from him.”
Once John Watson had been a crack-shot. Now he had nothing, save fear of the world-beneath-the-world that meant that he would gladly spend parts of his army pension on London cabs rather than to travel underground. Still, the fogs and darkness of London comforted him, took him in.
Those were John’s immediate thoughts: queer and a rather odd mix. John wished he could move in immediately, but who would have him as a flatmate? John knew he was not an easy man to live with.
gifted to him than that of John himself and that he would bring grief to no one: also, he doubted that any of the cars
Colonel Landsbury was now looking at me with interest. Slowly, he seemed to come back to life. Flicker things, emotions.
Holmes did not comment on it. The death of a human being had never cheered him up, even when it was a vile and Machiavellian being like this woman.
hot, cloudless day. There was a full moon and stars pricked the sky. Waves dragged and crashed as the petrol-black sea retreated from the beach. The Jurassic cliffs above glowed amber, as though still radiating the heat they had absorbed during the day. In the harbour, boats bobbed and masts swayed in the shadows. The church on the hill was unlit; the rich jewel colours of its stained-glass windows had dulled to a uniform satin black. At the other end of town, outside, far from the madding crowd, Sherrington Hall was in darkness.
"The plot thickens, Watson," Holmes said, sounding pleased, as he penned the first of three telegrams the next morning at his desk in 221b. Before Bernie had died the night prior, he had slipped a note into Holmes
My patience was running thin towards Holmes’ stubbornness to ignore the elephant in the room. The night was soon to fall and dinner was well past without the great detective making so much comment.
Shortly afterwards, Mrs Hudson announced a Mr Jones. I wanted to protest, but she informed me that Mr Holmes had instructed her to let this man up, disregarding the hour.
Just google it, in 2020, you can actually find a bit about it. And yes, it's still An Issue for some (which can be witnessed in realtime on via editing wars on Wikipedia, for instance.). Seriously, even in 2020, you cannot be a hero, and being queer at the same time.
he said. “Glad, you did, sir. Additional pair of ears. Up close to the door now, please. It won’t belong.”
Sherlock can just stop himself to blurt out that it is illogical to start a movie series in the middle. Truth is that Sherlock has watched them all with Mycroft before. His brother had been obsessed with the 007 status and this special branch, and Sherlock secretly believed that the movie series had been formative for his later profession. Nowadays, he would not be too surprised if Mycroft Holmes turned out to be M.
Mrs Hudson listens to them in 221a for a while until she thinks she can leave her boys alone. She will clean up their messes in their kitchens tomorrow. Tonight, she indulges in a rerun of
Maybe John had gasped, moaned, groaned out some of it, but frankly: his best friend-turned-lover gave him the best blowjob of his adult life, and he couldn’t be arsed to think anymore.
I did not know what role I played in this mystery and what led me to forget Sherrington Hall for all those years, but when being in Holmes’ arms, it did not matter. I knew that just as the sun rises every morning that he would tell me then. He knew who I really was. I knew how I felt when I was with him, and that was all that mattered. I trusted him, simple as that.
I did not know how to answer Adèle Landsbury. Watson would have known the words. I am lost without my Boswell, and for words as well.
With a smug look, Mr Arbucklehurt gestured at the door. I saw my companion’s cheekbones flush with cold, barely contained anger.
I didn't like it that Holmes was so dangerously close on the windowsill. However, instead of showing my concerns, I turned to Miss Parker. I bathed in her surprise at my partner’s methods. I couldn’t help but smile. It’s amazing: his way of observing and deducing.
There seems to be a buzzing in the house, not unlike a beehive, and Mrs Hudson, as the queen bee, is plotting for the sweetest outcome.
. The ex-of-many-things looked tired, and his face was full of pain. He lowered his head, catching his figure in the mirror, broken.
“It was too much of everything,” my partner stated. “But before continuing… let me turn to you, sir, for a minute.”
Detective Stanley was thrilled to see Holmes again. He was sitting in front of the fire, a cup of tea in his hand. Immediately Mary-Ann came to his service and offered him some cakes.
Take away and tea, talking in their chairs. The fireplace was lit. It seemed like a normal night in Baker Street, but it was anything but. Two o’clock, time for The Talk.
Holmes later admitted something similar. He won with the setting: he had crept back into Sherrington Hall. Blushing, he shared the secret with me, in hushed tones that he had taken himself in hand in the bedroom upstairs, imagining it was my hand.
an assistant for my work. I’m a consulting detective, the only one in the world, I invented the job. You carry a gun, you are addicted to danger, and I could provide you with adventures you could actually blog about. And I have this flat and it’s an expensive spot. Even Mrs Hudson gives me a discount. She owes me a favour. It’s a rather long story, John. Let us say, normally, you only get three wishes granted,
I might have fallen into a rabbit hole of YT vids featuring women wearing (no) corsets during Victorian Times.
. How can you expect our messenger not to trust such an authority? As for the rest of me, the wearer remembers only one thing, I wore a big black beard and glasses.
Watson makes a noise suspiciously like a sob—which then degrades into a loud, keening wail as Holmes’s long finger lands against his prostate. His cock twitches sharply, heavy and erect between his thighs.
She rises to her full height, aims for the bar one last time and pours a beer. Then she pictures them, all the women of Doyle, frustrated and fed up, and a one-night-off in a tavern as their sanctuary.
With the years, Holmes even let experiments or a case rest for the day to join me earlier, or at least rest for a few hours. Therefore, I was terribly aware of his absence.
MORIARTY: Listen to me. On the 4th of January, you crossed my path — on the 23rd, you incommoded me. Now, at the close of April, I find myself placed in such a position through your continual interference that I am in positive danger of losing my liberty.
It is a frightening process, and oh, how I raged and yelled and shouted when I realized what was happening. After the fury came to the despair and after it... came nothing. Alternatively, there might have been another state, but I cannot remember it any longer. It might be acceptance or something. I could ask our housekeeper, but what could it do? The chances are high that I forget it the next day or even earlier. Who knows: maybe I have asked day after day? Like back in the old days, when I asked my Watson about interesting articles in the newspaper. Or for a better comparison: when he retold his reading experience and 9 out of 10 times it was so pedestrian that I forgot come lunchtime or supper.
It took some minutes before we could resume our discussions regarding the case. To make sure that I would finally hear the end of the story, I had partly dressed and had set myself up in the chair next to the bed. I ignored Holmes’ pouting as well as I was able.
If John or anyone else had looked at this man closer—let us say, into his eyes—it would have been a dead giveaway. As this would not happen until ten minutes later, John had to listen to one of Sherlock’s make-belief tales—which came with the jobs. Even Sherlock loved to claim that it was “not his division”.
Instead of listening to my concerns, Holmes was plunging at his violin. His mind was already set on a happier note, “Oh, Watson, remind me to buy another A-string, would you.”
I did as Holmes asked me to do, naturally. When I was thinking it was all a lie by Holmes achieving God-knows-what, I spotted a small, shining thing on the ground. Instantly, I realized what it
“Spot on, Dr Neil. No wonder why you were praised as one of the leading toxicologists at the University of London. I read one of your reports on indigenous poisons the other day.”
People gathering in small groups, exchanging pleasantries and local gossip. For some twenty minutes, they can simply be, no alcohol clouding their minds as it does in the tavern or the pressure of the economy on market day. It is a small burden to listen to the mess for roughly an hour.
“I cannot accept money from you, Mr Landsbury. You are just a mean person. Do you think I have forgotten the torments you inflicted on your uncle?”
Holmes questioned the maid, Mary-Ann, for a few minutes alone. When he came back to me, he wore a small smile.
The confused governess took us to the kitchen. There, at the request of my companion, she left us alone.
"Exactly, Watson. It wasn’t easy. I had to use my imagination. Even my cooing around Miss Parker failed to make him flinch. I may be a little too old for this kind of play, John."
“First, you suspect the devout catholic, then hours later, the ex-doctor. I’ve said countless times that you shouldn’t jump to conclusions, and what have you done? Exactly that, John."
The words left his mouth before John even registered it: “He isn’t dead.” Greg patted his back, missing the point, just like his landlady, who’s looking worried. Scarlet’s expression was cryptic. It may be she’s bored but also that she's cataloguing the body parts delivered by Molly in her head already. Molly… “You knew it!”
“You wonder.” Another kiss on the right lid. “You genius,” a kiss on the left one, “my one”, and a kiss on the nose. “And only”, as he finally reached Sherlock’s mouth.
Therefore, I proceeded down to the basement to ask Holmes what arrangements had been made for lunch.
"It all began a month ago. My daughter, her name is Anna, she's barely twenty by then, brought…" - Marley reigned himself in - "introduced this man to me. This man was a seafarer. Not even from The Royal Navy, but a common seafarer. A sailor, can you believe it!"
“How did you know Harry is my sister?” John asked. “Harry could be my brother. How did you know Harry is short for Harriet?”
Hall. He must have killed the girl, but he didn't want the colonel dead. Faced with the latter's suicide, Robert got scared and fled.”
This young maid did her job admirably, a real gem. After taking care of Holmes so kindly, she will take care of me, pouring me a cup of tea and cookies again with a charming smile. I had to pull myself together to listen. It was not Holmes' habit to share his thoughts during an investigation. We were all ears, well I tried. Even young Mary-Ann, after serving me kindly, remained in the room looking as if she was collecting dust on the cabinet.
It was almost as if I could hear his deep, cunning voice and feel his dark, always alert eyes on me; how did he manage it, repeatedly? And to hide his message to me in the medallion.
Holmes burst into a nervous laugh, then he resumed his reading. I walked over to Mrs Hudson and grabbed the letter with a hopefully reassuring smile. She thanked me and fled.
Watson’s initial reaction is natural, even though we both inwardly bristle: Watson suspects me of being Sherlock Holmes' son.
“Yes”, Holmes replied, “we will, won’t we. Therefore, something rather wonderful will come out of it all.“
. It was almost empty; Holmes, aka Captain Basil, swept a glance over the customers and we left immediately.
“It’s him!” I insisted later in the cab. It had taken a considerable amount of luck and money to convince a driver to take us, as we looked even worse coming out of the bar.
His gaze flickers down to the stranger’s hands, his throat, and then returns to his face. Sherlock Holmes registers how handsome this man is. Holmes feels something but pushes it away, fiercely. John Watson will flee like everyone else. After all, he is just a man, ordinary. Yet, Holmes cannot stop his speech, as something urging him on, making this one deduction count. It has never been a game to him, no matter what the townspeople have said, but suddenly he wants…
Holmes nodded affirmatively. He introduced me, but the coachman did not seem to be interested in my presence.
Now it should be time to go home. To go with Rosie back to their house in the suburbs, and pretend that 221b Baker Street was not their home.
The inspector turned on his heels contemptuously and joined his men. Holmes' patience was at an end and as his astonishment passed, he reacted violently to these gratuitous insults. He caught up with the inspector in a few strides and grabbed him by the shoulder. The two men looked at each other. I feared for a moment that they would come to blows. The constables had stopped all work and observed us in amazement.
Determined not to succumb to lethargy as I had the previous afternoon, I decided despite Holmes’ strict embargo ongoing near the window, I simply must have some air.
We could have been carried away, and oh, how I wished to explore our bodies further, but it was a new morning and I needed closure.
The driver swayed in his seat. His chin descended to his chest. One, two, three times. Then he began gently to snore.
For a second or two, John fears the worst and then calls himself to reason: the linen man is dead. Yet, as that has not been exactly bulletproofed in the past, John hastens up the stairs, taking two at once. It is twilight, so it is risky, as he barely sees where he's heading. Alas, he hasn’t cared for his safety before and isn’t starting tonight. Instead, he chides himself for not being faster. His shadow is dancing on the wall, creating a grotesque picture: a ghost from a gothic fever dream.
The detective did not expect such a gesture from the staid and rational doctor, who usually always maintained his self-control. Only once had he really seen him without brakes, but he had no desire to get him drunk again; he usually liked Watson much more, even if that had been a decidedly intense and revealing experience.
"Unless…" Sherlock Holmes said, looking soft, not quite the man the architect and consultant expected to meet given the background information of their clients’ more active days. The two women, mid-thirties, red-headed, career-driven, were prepared to be mocked, deduced and called names. Instead, they were watching a man following his partner's lead. "It never made it into official records…"
“One case?” I could not quite see it, let alone believe it, and I guessed that my voice carried my doubts.
If Sister Mary knew what she wears proudly in Sunday Service… Oh, the irony! It makes the two lovers giggle like schoolboys.
"Love will conquer it all," Anna Johnson had yelled, the vitriol ready that night, face to face with her father.
WATSON: Holmes, if you had not given away our private relationship by calling me by my first name...
He forces his eyes shut. His sleeping position is familiar and alienating tonight. Annoyed and huffing loudly, he punches his cushion in form. It’s no use: the space in front of him is too vast to be ignored tonight.
Holmes obliges. Slowly enough, he presses into him. He feels the head of his cock pop inside and Watson confirms it by crying out.
His thinking pose, at least, had survived retirement. It had been uneasy watching this version of Sherlock Holmes. He might have been there all along, but never for the public eye.
I had to save time. I knew this kind of criminal, so imbued with himself. All I had to do was to let him think he was dominating the conversation.
Indeed, the colonel’s eyes seemed dead. His face was extremely pale and his cheeks were hollow. His sorrow was clear not only for a doctor. Holmes, sensing something, shut the door to the living room. Instantly, a damn broke. He expressed violent sobs. I was stricken by this display of grief.
I felt nostalgic in it, and yet I wasn’t so fanciful as to believe that Sherlock’s eyes had widened when I had entered our living room dressed in it for a second.
As I stood back to get a better look at my other self, the duplicate doctor put a hand to his own face, retched at his upper brow and pulled and stretched till he had removed his entire face. Revealing underneath the mask the flaming eyes of Sherlock Holmes.
Naturally, our discussion turned to Afghanistan and India. We talked about the nightly fighting in the deep valleys, the natives that we could not see and who appeared like ghosts in the camps at night,… and always we returned to whether it had been right to invade their countries.
I follow him into the cottage, adopting his slow pace. He is using a cane again, his old war wounds, as well as arthritis, making him wince with every step. I flinch when he stumbles over a crease in the living room's carpet. When I reach for him, trying to stabilize him, he brushes me off far too soon.
Her Sunday hats are so nice they must weigh ten pounds. She is so good at weaving cloth that she is even better than the famous weavers from the cities of Ypres and Ghent in Flanders.
Sherlock and I parted ways soon after that. I was working the late shift at the local GP surgery. Sherlock mumbled something about research, which could be everything and nothing.
"That's his handwriting," the cook cried happily. “The brave colonel recognized his child. God bless his soul! How sad he didn’t dare to go on living.”
thanks to the people who read & cheer along; thanks for the kudos and the comments. This chapter is dedicated to my tumblr mutals who decided that it's time for HOUSE M.D. You ask - I deliver :D
However, when Dr John H. Watson, captain of the Northumberland Fusiliers, got shot and uttered the words, “Dear God, let me live”, all was changed. Apparently, it was true: love could conquer it all.
“You forgot to put on the taximeter,” John blurted out. Shit, shit, shit, now the taxi driver would put it up or threw him out God knows where...
Technically, we had our sides from Baker Street. Stubbornly, we wanted to try out a new order. Or, as Holmes wanted, I was too knackered from the move. My Holmes, ever curious, lectured about directions and whatever I zoned out as best I could. I love him, but I am only human. Sometimes I wish he would shut up.
“Sherlock Holmes! Blimey! You’re a lucky man! That man is a genius! My missus is a big fan. She’s pestering to name our firstborn Sherlock. Can you imagine?”
Our family are adventurers, as well as our loved ones. We always search for the unknown because we know that love will find us. It might take a while but with a changing time so changes the sea, and the tide is always turning. It is our nature.
"No news. However, I will make this woman confess, mark my words, Doctor Watson. Surely, she has buried the child’s body near to the house.
Our landlady, Mrs Hudson, was already planning. Only yesterday she had turned us out of Baker Street for her annual house cleaning. All too willing, we had found refuge in the British Library. For hours, Holmes had been studying some Old English documents. Later we had visited a tearoom which might be queer but a secret delight for Holmes. There he could observe customers who differed significantly from those who frequented the pub, for instance. Last, they offered the most delicious muffins, and Holmes had encouraged me to indulge.
The remark that "the magical car" is a London cab comes from BBC SHERLOCK. It was the starting point of LONDON GODS, by the way. Somehow my mind made the connection, and the plot bunny didn't want to let it go anymore.
Having said his piece, he shifted his focus to the Christmas tree. Oh, yes, even a tree could be found in our rooms this winter. I could not wrap my head around this; I had to find the underlying cause of all this.
It is December and with it comes the cold. There is an East wind coming, and some days ago, he was not sure if it had been his last bow.
It was worse here. It did not feel safe to look anywhere. To the left, there was the beach where I had played in my youth, or so they kept telling me. Mrs Partridge had recognised me instantly ("Will I ever..
In the soon-to-be-published version, I penned down that Holmes offered me tickets to the opera as an apology.
“Off the record then. I know nothing of this. I did not know if Holmes has a hand in it. He is conducting some very secretive business at present and possibly it is connected to that but that’s all I can tell you, I am afraid.”
? It’s not proper, it cannot be done, a voice like Mycroft quips, or is it, Anderson, with his dull remarks?
“My mother was quite distressed over all this. She refused to talk about it, which is quite understandable, I think. She passed away three years ago, always insisting that I should let it go. That searching for answers only led to madness. I, however, chose the other path: to find out what happened. This means nowadays, to find his body.”
Sherlock’s imminent silence was a clear signal: he had gone into his mind palace. Greg and I could communicate non-verbally these days. I would stay next to Sherlock. I would even fetch his smartphone from his trouser pockets, while Greg kept Anderson and Donovan in line.
The stranger looked at us expectantly. As the silence dragged on, he cleared his throat noisily, and then added, “I am [name], the CEO of X.”
Inside, the fireplace had already been lit and Sherlock Holmes was arranging Christmas decorations almost everywhere; he himself, who had always found those holidays boring and uninteresting. Hearing his lover's approach, Holmes looked out from the branches of pine and holly, woven over the fireplace and the headboard of the bed, to a small pine tree, relegated to a corner of the room, and to the small bunches of mistletoe, which hung here and there from the ceiling. Watson could admit that this way the room was much more welcoming and joyful, but taking part in those activities was strange to his intimate friend, more strange than usual, at least.
) How do I know that you have opened a consulting room and resumed the practice of medicine without letting me hear a word about it? How do I know that you have been getting yourself soaked lately? That you have an extremely careless servant girl — and that you have moved your dressing table to the other side of your room?
On his skin were several red marks, showing a circle and a cross; they dotted his throat, arms, chest, sides.
An anonymous cloud continues to hang over Baker Street, but there was nothing to be done about it. It was Christmas, but there was still Mr Norton’s death threat. If Holmes did not make light of it, how could I?
): I am afraid, Professor, that in the pleasure of this conversation I am neglecting more important business. (
First, I did not want to believe in such an idea. Then, I remembered Holmes’ lines of never theorize before: one has all data. However, when I analyzed what I had observed during the day, I might plan a hypothesis. After all, I had witnessed the eager and anxious way towards Miss Parker’s condition. So my partner was not that far from the truth.
“Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You have been abroad, but not sunbathing. Your limp is
I am telling all of this—while having still a rambling tendency as if I were a young lad, narrating all and nothing about the events at school—to highlight that my confusion about the situation was fueled by two points: I still weakened state and my; so I assumed; unrequited love for Holmes.
“Alright, Mr X. Let’s stick to the facts, shall we? We all remember the notes that were left behind. They weren’t just random scribblings but leads to the true killer. The first note gave us the timeline: all was aimed for the climax at Pride Month. What have you planned? A true apocalypse for the parade? A re-enacted judgement day for the non-believers? Yes, Mr X, we found out about your… let’s call it, inspiration. But the second note was the most revealing killer from Berlin. And as you’ve confirmed yourself mere minutes ago: You are indeed from Berlin.”
"Me too, Sherlock. And yet, everything else would be strange, wouldn’t it? Sherlock Holmes without a John Watson?"
They had first met, as he had found her near her mother’s grave. Technically, the nun had informed him, but that was a minor detail. It was shortly after her seventeenth birthday, and he wasn’t intimidated or afraid. He would play it like he tricked everyone for the last fifteen years and some, and he would never be confronted with her wrath.
After a glance at the list, Sherlock pointed out one name: Mr, formerly Dr, Neil. Apparently, he'd been struck off when his addiction got the better of him. He'd helped himself too liberally to the contents of the pharmacy.
“Mrs Nordon. You will follow us. I'm arresting you for the kidnapping and murder of young Adèle Lansbury. The maid will send you a trunk with some clothes.
“Let’s enlighten you all, shall we? Sherlock faked his own death, exact 221 days after said incident, I appear, and as we learned already, by his plea. You don’t care about
, and fan dancer extraordinaire. I am also somewhat well known for my work in documenting the remarkable talents of my friend, the world’s only consulting detective, England’s proud son, that brilliant deductive genius and foremost toffee-nosed pounce: Mr Sherlock Holmes.
“What do you think, John? A string of unsolved murders, possible hate crimes, and June on the horizon? It’s a feast for the vultures. The conference is tomorrow at 10. I expect you both to be there, on your best behaviour, unless you're right about there being another body. Then, it’ll be postponed until 2 pm.”
Surprised by our intrusion, while flattered by the words of Holmes, the cook knew how to react. She ushered us to sit down. The soon served scones were still hot.
Soon Holmes stripped off his clothes and put them on the unfortunately unrecognizable corpse. Finally, he approached me: “The second carriage is stopped right next to our pram. It can no longer ride, but the horses are virtually unharmed. There is Robert's corpse near the car.”
"Fireplace" (Dec 6) continues "Mistletoe" (Dec 1): For Nikolaus Day, have some Johnlock snogging & happily in love.
I had just shed my coat, ordered a cup of tea from Mrs Hudson and made myself comfortable in my chair by the fireplace when Holmes returned to Baker Street.
“It's all explained,” Stanley roared, rising to his full height. “She hid in the carriage, knocked out by morphine. And he walked it around as we searched all over Crevecoeur Hall. Then he quietly put it back in the vault, sure the police weren't coming back soon. How clear everything is thanks to you, Mr Holmes!
Yet, my reasoning got the better part of me for a second, as I interjected: “It’s unnecessary, old boy; after all, we are only here...” I stopped mid-sentence. I hold my breath, realizing what I was about to blurt out; carelessly cruel and so very wrong. I looked at my companion with a guilty and mortified expression. Holmes did not deserve such a sentence; he only deserved love, as I really, truly loved him.
His last assignment had been to Afghanistan. Here, the locals and the outsiders—whatever nation they called themselves at the moment–had been fighting on-off for more than a century. In the 18
"Miss Parker is pregnant! She will get married soon and certainly with the master of the house himself."
There were the already mentioned bumpy cars, a roller coaster, carousel, pony riding, and countless other amusements.
The mishaps of the day amused my friend a lot. Further, I heard the echo of one of our last private conversations. It was as good as I
Silence and the impatient huff ignored. What Sherlock cannot articulate, his daughter did tenfold. "Amazing, Dad. Brilliant, is it not, Papa?"
“Sorry, old boy, I did not want to say... I did not mean what I said. You know that I not only come here for that reason, don’t you?”
Therefore, I changed the publication date because frankly, already ch6 is such a different chapter now.
had left. Greg had offered Molly a lift home, and she had readily accepted. Sherlock wished them the best he had said so, and they had both smiled.
"Could it be a countdown?" Lestrade and Sherlock turned to me. It was a bit intimidating to be scrutinised by two men who tower over me, but I was a soldier, so I battled on. "The date, you see? Monday is the first of June."
Originally, John had wanted to go onto his knees to worship him. His cock was magnificent as well as the rest of his body, and John wanted to taste him, to find out for himself if he was hotter than a human. It was curiosity—but it was driven by lust.
The day, while already warm and bright, had not turned oppressive. The clock over the hearth ticked slowly as I settled down to my books, experiencing for the first time since my student years some of the quiet ecstasies of study.
Instead of undertaking his morning rounds as he used to do as a Rugby player in his early twenties, John hobbled across the room, heavily leaning on his cane, forbidding himself to think about how he came to the injury or how his shoulder looked without clothes nowadays. On his other hand, he had a mug of tea and an apple, both of which he put down onto the desk. Sitting down, he opened the drawer on the desk to get his laptop. He reread the entries of his blog, telling that this would pass, that his stay in this strange world was limited and finite.
“Doesn’t matter. At least, not for me or Bea. I’m a Holmes, and I’ve got a place in society now, and an uncle who’s special but I’m special too, so fit. I can get used to the clothes. The dress was actually pretty. But it’s not for Bea, so it’s your turn.”
"You're right, Jane. I’m just a fool to get on my nerves like this. Forgive me Mr Holmes, but military matters still fascinate me too much."
Further, Greg sent us a list of people with extended medical and/or pharmaceutical knowledge with criminal records. They hoped to find an expert in toxicology as a lead to the man behind the killings.
Sister Mary wears a pretty cloak and a well-pressed cloth around her neck. Around her arm, she wears a rosary made of coral beads. On this string of beads hangs a golden brooch with the letter A and the inscription
Daylight welcomed us. A fine rain had settled in. We found ourselves in the back garden of the house. While I pitied the poor state of the property that used to be my childhood home all those decades ago, I made the mistake to let Holmes out of my sight. Hearing a crash and the silent cursing of my companion, I rushed to find him. I discovered him in a hole, holding his ankle. It took me far too long to help him out of it.
Sherlock’s whispered, “Welcome back”, brought him back to the present. The jinn turned and walked away, toward what John assumed to be his bedroom. “Time to choose a side, John.”
Here, the blacksmith had explained his instruments and the enigmatic stranger was allowed to touch it all. Afterwards, Holmes had shown off his best pieces, relishing in Watson’s praise. While he had an urge to tidy up a bit of the mess he’d made, he also wanted to listen to John Watson’s “That’s clever!” forever. As an ex-soldier, Watson knows about weaponry, and he has broad shoulders and a fascinating scar.
I did my best to stand up. When I approached Mrs Nordon, I was wincing in pain. My leg must have been badly broken, but I put my foot on the ground. Mrs Nordon was in a sorry state. She was still passed out, and her face was bloodied. I had to find a solution.
Out of sheer, horrified curiosity, he opened the salad crisper and took out a clear plastic bag. Peering at its contents, he cringed when he realised what was inside: thumbs.
Several days passed in complete stillness. Holmes, more and more irritable, only played the violin with gusto, chaining the most discordant studies with the most unsightly squeaks. The snow finally stopped falling and a beautiful winter sun sparkled over London. Little by little life returned to the streets, people went back to taking walks; me first, both to escape the grinding of Holmes' violin and to take advantage of the beautiful sun. I spent quiet days at my club, happily reuniting with old friends, scotch and billiards.
I took a few steps closer to Landsbury. The rifle would still be in his hands. Sounds of crying draw me to the foot of the stairs. Little Adèle was sitting on a step. She was crying. Embarrassed, I went running away and returned to Stanley, but she called out softly. I crouched down and looked at her, about to say a few vague words of encouragement to her, but what she did then surprised me to the highest degree. I'm not used to this kind of demonstration: Adèle Landsbury stood up and hugged me while crying louder.
is always enticing. But he didn't teach me anything. I must admit that our man's way of playing is quite clever. He called a porter and waited quietly outside the door at 221b Baker Street. The porter would have sworn that this man was indeed from 221b. He was indeed Mr Sherlock Holmes.”
My blurt-out comment was replied with a confirmation and a smirk; one that was all-too-familiar for me: House had an inkling, a suspicion, and a theory.
“Apologies, gentlemen.” The man sputtered, blushed. “My sincere apologies, I know that this isn’t proper behaviour, alas; the time is pressing. Faced with such peculiar events, one has to go the extra mile.”
Here I had to scale a wall to our back of our own dingy basement; the front room being the one that Holmes had made into his makeshift laboratory.
Before John Watson and Sherlock Holmes had even reached 221b, it was as if the magic car—the London cab—had never existed
HOLMES: I share your regrets, Professor, but solely because of the rather uncomfortable position, it will cause you to occupy.
“I should stand up and leave immediately. Yet, one is accustomed to your personality and peculiarity. Good for you.” Holmes looked stunned for a minute, yet he offered no explanation or apology. Instead, he seemed to wait for me to continue. I reined myself in, but only quiet. “As you have already
"A knife, right into his heart, doctor,“ Holmes observed. A beat of silence with a more stable voice, he added: "We‘re onto something, Watson... There
It wasn’t Angelo this time, but Mycroft. His smile interpreted John instantly as “punch-me-in-the-face”. It took all his willpower to act politely.
“And he would have killed the daughter of his beloved master to achieve his ends. Your theory does not hold water, Holmes!”
Smug bastard. He was stretched out on the bed, and if Sherlock had been a cat, he would be purring. He surely liked to be petted and stroked. Lazy, gorgeous git.
that had never worked with her. Her laughter had been heard long after Sherlock had shut the door with a little more force than necessary. Oh, and Janine had rushed along to catch up with them, offering some lines about "shared cab ride". Neither John nor he had believed it for a second as all three women were surely well enough to pay for their own fare, and had come with two own cars. Live and let live...
As much as it pleases him when someone above his own station, be it a nobleman or man of the cloth, pays a visit—and God, did he remember the grace when his archbishop once set foot in the town–, something is pleasing about everyday life when he is the ruler of right and wrong, the maker of fate on earth.
It makes no sense that a man like Sherlock Holmes ends up with a man like me. He would say the same, and that is the beauty of our partnership. I was never considered beautiful, but to him, I am beautiful. He whispered it in my ear that morning, and I wanted to protest, as I knew how I look. My Holmes is a beauty, I, myself, would have called handsome years ago.
Anyway, the elderly woman shows up on the doorstep, a cake in her hand. It is a Victoria Sponge, and it might have even been homemade. The most alarming occurrence, however, is her smile. It doesn’t scare him per se, but it makes him uneasy. He has known her for over 15 years: Martha Hudson is not a nice person.
“I haven’t taken his case, John. I will investigate whoever is behind the killings on his company property. This case is interesting, with its different methods of killings and messages. Curious, John. Like you said to the man: almost always it’s not God’s word but men’s interpretation, and I imagine it’s similar here. It might look like Devil’s work, but it will have been performed by human hands. And I’ve got a suspicion that our client is involved… and if not, we’ve got a small fortune. It always comes in handy.”
"My God." All power drained out of her body. She returned to uncontrolled sobbing. “So he believes me guilty. He doesn't trust me anymore.
I was more than happy that I had not stumbled over another body, but the question remained: how could a blanket find its way into this remote corner?
Welcome to the queerest radio play of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson to-date: "The Newly Discovered Casebook of Sherlock Holmes". True to Victoriana, full of (sex) puns, and simply hilarious, it's one BBC production that far more people should know about.
I'll freely amit that I looooooove it to pieces but in no-way have the brilliance of the creative team behind it; or, my anonymous writer who gifted me a ficlet set in that universe (https://archiveofourown.org/works/16681315) for Holmestice 2018.
"I like to think of it as opportunistic", Sherlock replied and hoped that he sounds as he used to be back in the old days: confident, full of mischief, a good friend - and someone to be trusted. Someone John had been in awe with; someone who John had followed willingly and without questioning; someone who had
For a second, I was speechless. Then, I blurted out “Holmes! How do you know about that? I try my best
“I knew it, Holmes!” I really did not. And Holmes probably knew it as well. Two fools in love, what a pair we made. “That is why you expected it! I knew something was odd that you have seen it but not informed me about it. Normally, you would do it to show how clever you are. *mimicking* Watson, what can you deduce from this envelope *mimicking* passable, but I hope you would go deeper. For instance...”
I recognised his hesitant and unusual speech in a heartbeat. It was rather odd, but I did not want to get my hopes up. After all, I was only Dr John H. Watson.
the others did not overhear us, “Please, John. I am terribly exhausted, and I have missed you. Come to bed with me.”
Holmes left his spot at the window and rushed to search through the pile of newspapers on our living room floor. Being successful, he sat down opposite me, carrying some with him.
that evening, the inn was crowded. I spotted two or three familiar faces from Jones’ and my walkthrough Sherrington. The elderly man in a heated discussion with another might be even the vicar I had encountered earlier today at the church.
when he had to leave. I’m deeply sorry but Sherlock begged me to not tell anyone, especially you, John.”
by Sherlock with, “Do you want to see some more?” Blood, violence. It didn't get to me like it had before I had enrolled in medicine, or when I was shipped overseas to fight for the queen and country soon after. Yet, to witness over and over what humans could succumb to and inflict on each other made me sick.
“Landsbury Charles: born April 23, 1843, in London. His father is Sir Henri Landsbury, an officer in the English army. His mother is Mary Jane Winslow, daughter of fruit and vegetable wholesaler James Winslow.
So we made our way through the snow, as content as two men can be. The snowflakes were so thick and heavy that they fell and covered our footprints almost immediately.
“I know what you mean, Doctor Watson. There are days I think it all has to be some fever dream, and I will wake up and my father will walk through the door as if nothing has happened.”
Mr Jones and Holmes looked at me. I was perplexed. Nothing made any sense. Surely that could not have really happened. This could not be my life.
keep in mind... that maybe my fix-it might be not the perfect climax... but at least, it’s not like the original.
The next moment Lestrade’s officers came bursting through the basement door and Tobias Organ was dragged away.
“Holmes, I don’t know what’s got into you today, but I demand that you let me go.” A beat later, I added, less heated but still sharp, “We’ll meet at the door in ten minutes.” On my way out, a softly uttered, “Calm yourself, man,” slipped out, even though I was not sure of whom I was referring to, my flatmate or to myself at that moment.
“We want you to investigate. Name your price, we will double it. You see: all the bodies were found on our premises. We are a renovation company, specialised in turning warehouses into apartments. We aim for a family-friendly environment, one cannot have a crime scene in a neighbourhood. And before you say a word: yes, Mr Holmes, we are aware of the upcoming Pride Month. So it’s even more pressing, you see. We have been one of the major sponsors of London Pride for the last few years, we like to show support for good causes. When you do your research about my company - which I assume you’ll do in the wake of this conversation - you’ll discover that we’ll switch our logo to pride colours at midnight. We have a promotional video ready in which our HR head and several LG… B… whatever they're calling themselves at the moment employees talk about why representation matters. I might be a conservative man, being older in years and brought up traditionally, but I am not demonic, Mr Holmes.”
So the childhood had come to an abrupt halt when the alcohol had caught up with his sorry excuse of a father and the coming out of Harriet-turned-Harry had started a new battlefield; so the odds against him were higher than he would be kicked out too if he had ever strayed away from
The sun had just risen when John Watson woke up. The room was bathed in twilight, shadows making the few items look like monsters hidden in the dark. But he wasn’t afraid anymore. The past was buried, and with Sherlock Holmes at his side again, how could he be afraid of ghosts?
When he got all mysterious out of a sudden and seemed to have hidden something behind his back, I expected a client ringing at our door any second. Maybe someone had appeared prior? Left a clue behind that revealed their identity or a first lead for the future investigation?
Holmes disappeared after lunch, where I did not know, as he did not confide in me. This occurrence wasn't unusual for me any longer, after sharing lodgings with Sherlock Holmes for years. I knew that neither feeling abandoned nor addressing the issue would improve anything. Time has taught me to follow Holmes whenever he wished for my company, and when he preferred to work alone to not distract him with my presence or to question his actions. Holmes was a man of habit, and he has made a habit of sharing his life since the fateful day in 1881.
When I got to the front door, I wanted to make sure it was wide open, not like an unpleasant surprise. We would have an emergency exit. Knowing that the cook was sleeping upstairs, I went down to the cellar. I hadn't been to the cellar yet. The little one could only be there. It took me several minutes to find myself in front of the door.
He isn’t a good man either, so he can react accordingly: “Thank you, madam. The cake looks delicious, but you shouldn’t have. However, Beatrice will be delighted. She loves sweets.”
“We don’t know a thing about each other. I don’t even know how we met; I don’t even know how you know my name.”
Cartridge said, bringing me back to the present, “was that I was walking through the station and turned around a corner when I spotted you by the wall of the restaurant which by then was closed. You were talking to a man with a brown hat. I would have approached you, but when I caught your eyes you acted as you would not know me. And I assumed that your conversation was of some importance. The more I thought about it the more I thought it was a poor way to treat a good friend.”
of the desert then: red sands blew a dust storm through his thoughts, and the scarlet silks of the tents that
"No, not at all. All is fine," I smiled placidly. "I just wondered. It cannot be an easy task to light up all the fireplaces in such a big house, as well as look after the grate later. Could it not be possible to overlook something?
He should be alarmed, but he isn't. After living so long in quick-sand memories, he's used to being forever in limbo. If there had been a disruption, and something as soothing as
He stood up from the table and went across to the hearth. After retrieving his pipe and tobacco patch, he filled his pipe and lit it. Then he sank into his beloved armchair.

“I will not let myself be fooled, Mr Holmes. You will not strip me for this woman. My uncle died because of her. I will know how to make your throat.”
“I know you’re an Army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you have a sister who is worried about you but you will not go to her for help because you do not approve of her—possibly, because she is an alcoholic, more likely because she recently walked out on her wife. And I know we met because I am a Jinn. It is fate, kismet, whatever you like to call it, John—and believe me, I wished things were different, too. I hate surprises just like you. That’s enough to go on with, don’t you think?” Sherlock turned and walked into the room again. As if an afterthought, he added, “Yes, I am always like that.”
This businessman wears a beaver hat from Denmark and has expensive-looking boots. He speaks seriously, so everyone knows how wealthy and successful he is. Obsessively, he ensures that the navy maintains order in the North Sea between England and Scandinavia. He plays the markets well and sells a lot of Danish money in currency exchanges.
"Colonel Landsbury asked me to find his daughter at all costs. I feel obliged to tell him how you contributed to this search."
"This is one of the most pitiful letters we have ever received," I tried. "Landsbury needs your help, Holmes."
, sound in body and mind, made my will in 1875. All my fortune, movable and immovable property, capital and stock market shares, goes to my nephew Michael Landsbury. May 200 pounds be allotted to each of my servants.
My hopes for escaping the death of winter were short-lived, as the temperatures were almost identical. The tomb was a single room, damp like a cellar. At least I was protected from the icy wind here. I fumble around the walls and bump into the very low ceiling. A barrel vault. My feet encountered a soft mass where they grabbed hold of.
. These and similar thoughts had plagued my mind. Holmes and I had been both middle-aged men, accustomed to each other, the best of friends, and if it had not been for the lack of certain aspects (and the scandal), I would have been so bold to call it a marriage.
But Holmes didn’t explain himself further. Mrs Nordon finally arrived, accompanied by several servants carrying her trunks. She seemed to have regained all her joy and her beauty.
Nowadays they bickered and bantered, her visits longer each time. There was officially no plan for a move, but John might have spun a plan to rebuild a wing, or maybe even both. Apparently, Sherrington Hall had been much larger in the past.
"I imagined it was a decoration you would have appreciated," Holmes replied as he relaxed in the man's grip he loved, finally returning his embrace.
“The colonel just sent it to me shortly before his death at my accommodation on Baker Street. It was the afternoon before his suicide.
"Yes, exactly. David Jones. Why should this David Jones of Sherrington in 1903 have anything to do with Sherlock Holmes and John Watson of 221b Baker Street in London in 2020?"
One last glance, then he closed the door to the new guest room. Both men have offered John’s old bedroom to Scarlet, but they knew all too well that 9 out of 10 times she would prefer to crash on the couch. However, Sherlock would love to transform it into an archive for their cases. And who
Their wives have pushed them to take such positions of power in the guild because they, too, would benefit from being married to men of such prestige.
She sat down in an armchair, her eyes filled with tears. Holmes wanted to come over to question her when the door was banged open. Inspector Stanley walked in, his eyes shining with anger.
as it passed; a wheel dove into a water-filled pothole, spraying freeing muddy water over John’s trousers and coat. For a moment, he contemplated throwing himself in front of
Suddenly, catching both of them by surprise, Watson put his arm around the detective's waist and hugged him. He felt uncomfortable, but he didn't let go. He had been completely seduced by those tender gestures of his that he knew only for himself.
John had prepared tea while his partner had showered. He had discovered some scones in the pantry, courtesy of Mrs Hudson. The jam had looked questionable, but they would go for brunch soon, anyway.
"First, madame, I apologize for my temper yesterday. You see, I believed what the newspapers said about you. I thought you were guilty…
“In the basement. I have been all day in the basement of our house. And since your desire to be not intrusive is clearly going against your overwhelming curiosity to know I will tell you why I was there.” He paused and smiled, and then he continued: “In the full confidence that you do not breathe a word to a soul about it.”
It's almost ten when the bell of 221c rings. John is cranky. He wants to utter "piss off," when he spots the takeaway box on his doormat.
"Because our unfortunate disinheritance will not stop there," Holmes explained. “Michael Landsbury will do everything to break the will. And the Landsbury scandal is not benefiting you.”
That sentence had struck a chord in me. It replayed in my mind from the beach back to the inn and further to our room.
I did not know where I had heard or read that quote, or if I had made it up in my head myself. As Homes reminded me far too often: I am terribly romantic, and during our stolen hours at Sherrington Hall, I was drunk on my love. I had my fill of him, and I
Watson’s face burns, and he whimpers and rocks back against his fingers, desperate for more stimulation. However, he listens to the master’s orders: John Watson’s fingers stay away from his cock.
John Henry Norton had been convicted of murder and had been sent to jail. He was waiting to be hanged. However, he had come up with a plan, which involved a Christmas pudding made by his ever-loyal wife.
All he heard now were the prayers of the locals, the ones who still believed in the Jinn. All they wished for was, “Dear God, let me live”. They all knew the abominable truth: he could not grant their wish. Jinn could not grant these
John had been battling with his sexuality since he hit puberty. What he desired was forbidden, or so he had made himself believe. The aftermath of the war had put a strain on his libido. Some nights, self-love had been literally self-abuse.
deep down in his gut that Sarah Sawyer had been the woman who had spoken to Mary. “When will she be back?”
Finally, she fell silent, overcome by fatigue and drugs. Silence. The lawyer, relieved, turned to me.
The complete storyline of Salim and the Jinn is only a bit over 3,000 words. The following is the sex scene as it happens in the original novel:
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were anything but. And Rosamund "Rosie" Watson-Holmes was their legacy. They would never be
seen you use these deadly drugs — in ever-increasing doses. When they lay hold of you, there is no end. It must go on and on — until the finish.
“For this reason… I will spare the details. It’s plain and obvious and hideous in the extreme. The conduct of the killings was well-executed, intended for the biggest spectacle: you wanted a stage, that all the world could see what you believed to be true. Only a truly devilish mind…”
My heart was in an uproar. I ran up the stairs and crashed into the culprit: Mr Norton. In blind anger, I almost threw him down the stairs. A police officer, alarmed by the gunshots, saved me from becoming a killer myself.
“You won, Watson,” he huffed. "The colonel is a clever fox. Sending me a photograph of his daughter was smarter than all his tearful speeches."
That's it. Bryan Fuller and Michael Green expanded it a bit (and they made them reshoot it because Fuller, as a gay man, was like: "This doesn't work..."), but yes, the majority? All mine. Sorry, not sorry, that my sex scene is probably longer than all storyline of Salim and the Jinn combined. #love is love #representation matters #fandom is my escape room
Further questions are forced to wait, for Sherlock Holmes is not to be denied any longer. He straddles John Watson’s chest and forces the length of his eager cock down his throat. Penetrating deep, Holmes stares down into his lover’s eyes until he fully submits to him.
“You aren’t a quitter,” Ella’s voice encourages him. “Even when all is lost already, you cling on. It might be foolish, but aren’t we all human?”
I needed Holmes’ help. The transgression of a broken promise was a trivial thing, surely, in this impaling incident. I would go to him immediately.
the tone of his letter, he cherishes her more than anything. How can it be that a ransom has not already been demanded?"
Mrs Turner shrugs her shoulders. "I'm the lucky one, as mine only spills his semen once a year. It's his birthday gift. He can jerk off with his hand all year, hoping and dreaming to breed me - and on the day I am prepared so his sperm doesn't take root."
hidden compartment in his desk years later after his disappearance by sheer luck. Sadly, it did not reveal enough. Mr Holmes has examined it already and if he sees nothing of significance...”
“John Watson, delete all that nonsense about jinn being slaves to their master's wishes, up to and including sexual gratification, from your memory immediately. Modern men and their fairytales. It’s so dull. Further, it’s tremendously apparent what they’re aiming for: men seek power. There is hardly a better way to exert power than to bend another to one’s most intimate wishes. Oh, and if the other is not a man, but a creature with supernatural powers, would the commanding of that creature not turn the man into a god? Make him
At the moment, all pointed at murder, and just because I could not think of an innocent explanation did not mean there was not one. I suspected that there was probably something obvious that I missed.
It was snowing. Although spring was at the door, it was not unusual for the British metropolis. The light had changed; it was no longer clear and bright but interspersed with shadow colours, which clouded the mood. Thick snowflakes trickled from a grey-shrouded sky, turning the streets into a true wonderland.
The blacksmith is not wearing his usual clothing, practical and worn around the edges. Today, he has put on garments so white that they shine like a light. Looking suave and smart, Holmes wears the lovers’ knot on his neck. His coat shows his strength, accentuating his muscles. His legs are covered in tight pants, his long legs have never looked just
“You’re brilliant, John. I’ll skip the experiment for now. Ring Mrs Hudson, a little outing to Regent's Park is in order.” Ten seconds later. “Oh, you forgot to charge your mobile. Take mine.”
"Your father, Sir Henri Landsbury, was a brilliant officer, Colonel. He was still well remembered when I was stationed in India.
Afterwards, we would indulge in a private game, a cockfight—one might call it—highly illegal, of course, but it had pleased us both always very much.
It might have been a great magic trick and yet, I was furious! While Holmes was joking, making light of the situation, I was having none of it.
“The locals in Afghanistan swore that they had seen Jinn, late one evening, on the edge of the desert. We told them it was just a sandstorm, a little wind, but they said no, they saw its face, and its eyes, like yours, were burning flames.”
For nearly a decade we had been secretly and silently sneaking around 221b: retiring with whispers, stolen kisses and hushed endearments, only to rise early to return to our own cold beds alone. There had been cases that led us to remote cottages. A particular setting for reasons unknown to me by then which had increased as the years went on, but it had led to hidden treasures.
It terrified me no more. I had long made my peace with my desires. The harsh tone of my father, my brother, probably all of my family, were only echoes from the past, dulled and mostly forgotten.
Therefore: cooking the same dish at the same time in two different locations by two men that cannot even make homemade pasta before.
John Watson will never find out what has lured Sherlock Holmes to the place, the empty side street, far away from the town centre.
It was like a blow to his head, a punch in his stomach, like rushing over to help, frantically searching for his pulse. Forever replaying in his head,
If you walk down the pier of Brighton or the countryside outside Eastbourne, you expect Anderson-like people on every street corner. It might be an insult to the people there - and Sherlock had phrased it even harsher - but it remained true: Sussex was terribly
Sherlock, who is pressing his ear to the door when John is uploading his part of the ingredients on the doormat of 221b.
A case had led them to Sherrington. Of course, it had been a case as back as they had been Sherlock Holmes—consulting detective—and Dr John Watson; assistant, blogger and best friend. Actually, they had accepted it because the incident from
“Mr Holmes has stepped forward a bit here, Mrs Nordon. You have no chance, as the letter has no legal value.”
John has put on his best clothes, barely stopping himself at donning his old army uniform. He’s a civilian now: one that's clean-shaven and only wears a hint of military haircut. His date shoes are polished. He stands up straight; no, proud.
The lawyer quietly closed the envelope after putting the will in order. He smiled as he looked at Mrs Nordon.
had been partly leaked in the tabloids and on social media. London had been the last place John wanted to be with his daughter Rosie.
“When I’m not drunk and not fucking angry with you, Sherlock. Because you deserve better; we both do. Also, you need a shower, love. I get that you’re impatient. God, I get it, and I won’t deny any longer that I want you, too. But this isn’t the right time.”
“We can’t be sure. I suspect the police work on the theory that this is the last place he would show up.”
John’s treacherous mind instantly flashes back to yesterday: Sherlock in his arms. He has snuggled against him during the night. They woke up together in a position that everyone else would call intimate. John prays he isn’t blushing and also that Sherlock keeps his mouth shut.
I want to scream at him, the world, everything and anything, but I breathe in and out, and reply, “All right, John.”
In a heartbeat, I reach over and put my mouth on his. Maybe the saying is true: only lovers are left alive.
It’s a well-known routine by now: First, he takes a shower. There are bottles of shampoo, body wash and conditioner. Today, he opts for the luxurious brand. It’s a bit of a show, the marketing and the product itself, but that’s exactly what today’s events will be like. After all, he’s selling his music, and to a degree himself. Therefore, he is aiming for sexy and sophisticated. The Pianist isn’t silly, soft or sensitive.
“I am afraid so, my friend. If Organ through one of his spies got wind of that, the trick would not have worked two Watsons. Also, he needed to believe that you and I had quarrelled and therefore a good Doctor Watson might be in the market for a bit of betrayal. Unfortunately, your friend Cartridge saw me meeting Organ’s accomplice at Marylebone Station and almost let the cat out of the bag. It was necessary for me, for us, to put him somewhere safe. Lestrade’s men kindly subjected him to a temporal and comfortable form of kidnap.
“The previous owner didn’t lose it. I still know exactly where he is in case he wants it back. He exchanged it for wisdom.”
s not illegal per se, but it should be if you ask me. Mark my words, Doctor Watson, half of London‘s poorhouses are victims of Marley. And all for his profit: he owns a third of Whitechapel, and one hears he has ambitions towards politics now. I shouldn’t say it, but as I’m practically
Whatever has brought this on; it brightened up my mood considerably. Holmes is not the demonstrative sort, and even behind closed doors, he rarely makes an exception in broad daylight.
Sherlock had surprised him by calmly explaining "Watson" the phenomena. His best friend (?), Sherlock, had repeatedly proved his patience with her. Not once, he had called her an idiot, not even when she had disturbed his experiment. He had almost rushed out to clear up space and was close to apologizing to John and her. Apparently, he had been deep in thought, absorbed in an experiment involving - once more - thumbs. John had shaken his head when the thought had crossed his mind that the "
Somehow, John’s phone had found its way into Sherlock’s hand. While John was still trying to find a logical solution to how that had happened, Sherlock—unperturbed—turned it over.
“An interested party, one that shares your interest, is — let’s say — rather unusual methods of killing. In particular, your vast knowledge about toxicology.”
I have booked an appointment with Ella already. It was, however, too late to prevent three missteps.
Holmes walked past the couch to the open window of our cottage and held up the drooping stalk of a rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never seen him show any keen interest in natural objects. However, I mused, it made sense that Holmes would be interested in flowers as they are essential for bees. Just seconds ago he had presented me with the magnum opus of his golden years. He had picked up the volume from the table and read out the whole title,
shooting at the wall. However, he couldn’t bear to agitate Mrs Hudson further. She had witnessed far too much tonight already… Then he contemplated boxing up his things again and getting back on track with his original plan of moving out of 221b.
While pouring milk into his tea, the realisation sinks in that John would cherish Sherlock's warmth no matter what.
Others argue “Crossover chic! So woke!” After all, Sherlock Holmes has always been an eccentric sort. (“An awkward sod!”)
We couldn't help but share a surprised look. If this mysterious Miss Parker knew how long it had taken me to persuade Holmes, she surely would never have been so sure of our coming.
I chuckled seconds later, Holmes joined in. We sounded like schoolchildren, and Mrs Hudson would scold us like such if she ever would find out. But my heart was soaring with joy, and I
I was thirsty for more. That he had lapped up all that I had given him and spilt for me, and we were sated but hungry still.
It is a ritual now, one I cherish dearly. The quiet settlement in our positions, the shuffle of the blanket, always some light touch, sometimes even a kiss. There were no words exchanged, but nothing was unspoken.
“No. We arrived when the little one was chasing. It was the little one who let out a cry of fear when I caught up with her near the vault.”
His face showed surprise and interest as he fixed me with another stare, one I knew well enough, as it was normally reserved for the most intriguing of corpses. “Extraordinary, truly extraordinary.”
Mrs Hudson suddenly turns to Mrs Turner, an old friend of hers, and says, “Everything alright, dear? You’re staring so much at the ground—you look like you’re studying it intently!”
During that night, he admitted, he had slept not at all. He had haunted the countryside, following my path, trying to recreate my hours without him. To fill out the blanks, to fill the void inside himself. Obviously, he hasn't said those exact words. They are my words, the words of a poet, the lover speaking.
It was Christmas Eve. If I could not speak about it, at least I could show it with action. That was a language more fitting to us. Seconds later, as if he could read my mind, Holmes turned to me and smiled at me once more. Then he turned back suggestively, and I knew what he wanted. It was so pleasant to feel the warmth of his body again, even if there was the fabric in between. It had been two or three days since we had last met, to warm ourselves up in bed, while the snow had fallen outside, and yet it seemed a lifetime ago.
The blacksmith shakes his head, standing in front of John Watson in a cocky pose, hands on his hips; his body twists this way and that.
When the guard had throughout checked the pudding, they even allowed her to give the gift to him in person. Before, she had insisted that the gift was wrapped up again.
Ignoring my - I believed valid - questions, Holmes continued: “Watson. I'll charge you to watch the governance. I will try to play my role until the end.”
His voice had turned all silky. Rough, deep and alluring. It affected me - I am only a man - but not as intended. I laughed, or giggle - even I will deny this until my dying day because grown-ups, in particular, men, especially me, do not giggle. Full stop. For a second, House looked affronted, but then... a miracle: he joined in.
John Watson is a strict master, easy with swear words and hard labour. He demands discipline, but his guardsmen love him. Whenever he is sent to the dungeons, they smuggle some leftover food down to him.
"Not at all, sir. Normally, I would come and wake him, bringing tea and the ironed newspaper for him. This is highly unusual, Doctor. I don’t know what to do!
. I follow my heart, Mycroft.” It was the second time. The Gods were counting. Numbers had power, just like many other things when you believed in them.
I let myself fall, overcome by all these horrors. I heard Holmes walk away in the night, his footsteps cracking snow. Everything was so quiet around us except the cry of pain from the injured horse. I had to get up, but it was intolerable pain.
“A vanishing room? Holmes, are you pulling my leg?” Irritated, I intended to leave the breakfast table and make my way back to my room.
Landsbury was in an even darker mood than usual. The house seemed dead. Inspector Stanley had tolerated my presence for now. So Landsbury and I were sitting in the chairs in the living room, in front of the slowly dying out fire, in silence. Just before I could ask Landsbury if we could switch places, he asked with an unnaturally thin voice.
She had worn her favourite dress. Her brown hair was tied in a single braid. Her cheeks were so rosy that I could not even say if they or the roses were a truer red.
I dashed down the stairs, ran into the street. The driver of the cab had already whipped up the horse.
Now, I see what a struggle my complex speaking pattern had to be for all my friends, colleagues and clients.
"That's a queer line of enquiry, Watson. If this worries you so much, there is always a small reserve of wood stored in each of the rooms. Then all you have to do is to use the right tools and to have the knack to light your fire. It’s not that difficult. But I hope you don't have to trouble yourself, otherwise, Robert will have to answer me. He handles this work. "
John could not see Bea’s face, but he believes her to smile fondly. They were both idiots, weren’t they?
too young to join the war. I knew that he would have gone otherwise. Daniel Jones might be a new generation, but someone who has a grandfather who ran away with a Watson at the dead of the night wants to be a hero.
As he read the few lines, Stanley's eyes widened. Finally, they landed on Holmes, bewildered. The latter made a gesture of denial. No, he was not the author of this message.
As a doctor and Sherlock Holmes’ trusted companion, I knew my duties: I joined the house staff in the search of Colonel Landsbury. It didn’t take me long to discover a letter in his office. The quickly written words were almost unreadable.
Sometime later, they ordered take-away. More accurately, Sherlock had thrown various menus at John and demanded that he call the different places.
The trip was long and exhausting, and sometimes I feared I wouldn’t make it. It is ludicrous, as I am now my younger self, but the world is on fire, so my body is weak and even my mind is in shambles, full of memories, hopes and fears. I should rejoice and full of energy. And God, how I missed my beloved city, but how can I run down alleys to chase down criminals when my bones aren’t creaking but bombs are falling from the sky? Our London is no more.
“Why do you want to sleep in my bed, Sherlock?” John sees that he's echoing Bea's words and that he's found a daughter is another baffling fact. She didn't know the outcome. And he's gambling as well, driven by the rawest of emotions.
“Do you want a glass?” Watson turns around and heads for the bar. He stops dead when a hand reaches out for him. Sherlock’s arm burns like a brand mark. Immediately, Watson scolds himself for being so touched-starved. No, he corrects himself instantly: he is simply startled. He is only not used to such proximity, and in particular, by his former business partner.
John came the first time with Sherlock behind him, cradled in Sherlock’s arms as if he were a newborn. He was moving with him, his strokes in time; the feeling of the Jinn’s hand on his cock was otherworldly. Was it Sherlock’s nature, as a genie or a genius, that he knew when John needed faster, when he needed harder when he needed
Holmes gave her a beaming smile. I wanted to scream and throttle my partner’s throat, demanding that he speak. I play the fool for him from time to time, and sometimes I haven’t even realised that he played me, but like all human beings, I had my weak spot. On that day, Sherlock Holmes pushed all my buttons.
It’s the roll’s fault; something got into the wrong place, somewhere. Watson coughs loudly. He cannot stop. He searches for his cup. Sherlock gives it to him. Their hands’ touch; John almost
The next morning it was even earlier when Lestrade announced that another murder has happened. Again, a young man, a prostitute, crucified and possibly drugged before. Everything screamed serial killer. Two dead bodies, similar methods of killings, and in two days would be June.
I went to Holmes, uncertain still, trying to reassure him as well as myself that all was good, very good.
He admitted later, in hushed tones, that he was not sure if she was a woman or a goddess. “You are the goddess of beauty, Venus herself!” He had vowed to himself on the spot: “If she doesn’t allow me to see her again, I am going to die.”
Mr Jones was a middle-aged man, perhaps ten years my senior. Unlike me, he was wearing a wedding ring. He was well dressed, painstakingly so. His whole demeanour led me to suspect him to be a secretary or a valet. He greeted me politely, and his speech pattern confirmed my hypothesis.
John’s eyes scan the wall around the picture. It’s some flower. If John was asked, he would probably guess that it’s a rose. Hell, what does he know! Sherlock would say something poetic about it. Like the rose is something extra. That the world doesn’t need the flowers as we cannot eat them, and yet, they’re beautiful. Or, he would insist that one shouldn’t forget the bees. Sherlock loves bees, as they are fascinating creatures, or so he says. John simply would listen to him and insist that he, Sherlock Holmes, is a fascinating creature, too.
The wind was combing Holmes' curls into a spiky quiff. He was staring at the sea as if it was hypnotising
“Frankly, Doctor Watson? I am not sure. There are women ready to do anything to reach their goal. However, I
Placing the tip into the burning fire, he watches as his masterpiece glows with fury. Immediately placed back on the anvil, he rushes to mould it. Once, twice and thrice he hits the same place of the blade, causing the rod to flatten, then immediately flips the blade to remove the ridges of his hammer.
The cottage is miles away from the nearest village, and we have shut out the world tonight. I could not even hear the sea, for I’m surrounded by my Watson, only listening to his heartbeat. It’s faster and arrhythmic, but I convince myself that it is simply our proximity.
We lay entwined in the bed, Holmes’ solid weight behind my back. I did not know what today would bring, but I wished it would be like this always. I felt a featherlike kiss to my old scar, the one that brought me back to England and to Holmes, and it was as if my love could read my mind and signed the bond irrevocably. We would never be parted again.
Setting my gaze upon him for the first time in over a decade, I could have deduced the reasons John Watson finally came to Sussex and left our London for good, but I chose not to: my detecting days are over.
There is one merchant who has a forked beard and wears clothes that look like a jester’s. He is a foreigner.
"Why Holmes," I said laughing, "I fear you are becoming Mr Scrooge from the celebrated Dickens story."
"Only from a sadistic perspective. And why crucifixion? Is that someone's idea of true Christian values?"
, however, it was a narrow escape. If it was Sherlock's favourite and he did not get any, it was even worse. Their daughter in a sugar rush and his husband sulking was simply at the end.
Watson reaches down between his legs, lightly stroking himself as Holmes presses his fingers in. Soon he rocks back against his fingers once more, and that is when Holmes slaps his hand away.
It was his medical knowledge that put him on Scarlet’s track: “You’re one of Sherlock’s irregulars.” He put a mental note to send her to Mike for a check-up, also to conspire with Mrs Hudson to feed her up. “Why did Sherlock ask you to look after me?”
When the movers came, bringing in box after box filled with books and chemicals and children's toys, two chairs and a pram, clothes and all the modern gadgets and one stuffed teddy, the construction crew had left only a day earlier. They
It was a conversation through a wall. Enemies to friends to lovers. They were neighbours. Even they have never seen each other, they are going to communicate, fight and flirt through the wall.
"What? No, hell no, House." I was sputtering, and I was confused why I did not turn around and simply leave. This display of ... adult entertainment ... was certainly not that unusual for House, but me? I should be more freaked out, surely. No... slightly intrigued. "And why the music?"
“No? That’s curious, as the leader certainly remembers you. I showed him a photo, and he was quite proud to be acquainted with such a prominent figure, Mr X. It wasn’t wise to go there yourself, or at least, without a disguise. As you remind us all too often: you’re an important person. Even with a fake name, he recalled you. He will give testimony in court as well, in exchange for leniency.”
Holmes grips his bent legs by the knees and all but folds his lover in half. The marks on his fingers from the fire are burned like brand marks on Watson’s own flesh. Both men are going to forge a new unit tonight.
Entering the notary’s office, Holmes looked nervous. My uneasiness morphed into silent alarm. His mumbling speech seemed to prove my point: “She had promised. Ha, women! You can never trust them!
John put out a hand, patting his shoulder. It was the third time he reached out to him, and all was different now.
The second note he had written earlier as his writing was significantly more legible. Also, a bit more charming, or should I say, cunning:
Sherlock feels something twist in his chest. How long has he, Watson, wanted this? How long has John needed it?
he was with Holmes, he felt happy and complete, as he had never done in his life, and had no intention of changing that side of his life. He would die for those dark eyes, those lips that attracted him like magnets, that body that desired him and welcomed him impatiently. For that man who had totally changed his existence, even if he would never have admitted it in words.
The episode 'The Case of the Christmas Pudding' makes BBC SHERLOCK's 'The Abominable Bride' look straight in comparison. I haven't altered the dialogue... not my fault that it sounds queer as f*ck. As nixxie (?) in the Sunday Watchalong once famously said: Reynolds made another series because he couldn't get enough of his Victorian husbands.
“Mrs Hudson? This is Scarlet. Scarlet. This is Mrs Hudson, our landlady.” Oh, and it couldn’t be only him who was flooded with memories of first introductions,
Apparently, John Watson hadn’t been dazzling recently because the partner of Sherlock Holmes should have taken more interest in the sudden appearance of a strange girl at the doorstep of 221b. In particular, if one took her name and the timing into consideration.
Jinn was as if one was burning alive. There was a fire in their hearts, and they wish to please people, to bring joy and hope into their lives.
I begin by chronicling an adventure that I may have dismissed for several reasons, not because it lacked baffling and intriguing elements, on the contrary, but mostly I think because it was for me, personally, such a dizzying and distressing experience.
Therefore, I tried to start a conversation. It was not like the early days of our acquaintance, during which I thought Holmes all above idle chatter.
Finally, after a long walk through night and snow, I pushed open the entrance gate to Landsbury's vault. But there was nobody.
“What did I tell you? This is for me. And I can feel every time you are too worked up. You get tighter. You can’t fool me.”
“I can't even imagine it. It was the only thing I could do to catch these criminals and get them to make a mistake.”
Next to the rose, I had later found the medallion. I did not need to open it to know that there would be an accompanying note to my tale. It was quite elementary.
“Isn't it? And the best part is that we have a precise description of our man. He was wearing a long coat and a checkered hunting cap, he was smoking a long pipe… Does this description remind you of anyone, my dear Watson?”
"What does it matter to me if the child lives or dies, now, that the father believes me capable of murdering his other child?
Sherlock Holmes fell in love all the years ago, steady and fast, hard and silent, starting with the very first "Amazing", "Brilliant" and "That's fantastic". John Watson never stopped surprising him, not since he pulled the trigger to kill the cabbie (and his reaction, Good God!), and today was no exception.
"Robert has several duties in and around the house. I prefer not to have too many entourages, so I only hired a servant, a cook, a coachman and a governess. It’s enough for me. Crevecoeur Hall is no palace.
Ten minutes later, Sherlock whimpered. He had begged John to touch him, “everything, my love” had been the hushed reply.
In the cab, on our way back to Baker Street, Sherlock commented, having mind-read my thoughts: “John, obviously I bullied Mycroft into getting me a proper one. Even at 7, I was superior to my peers in science.”
"Not so much when you know about Colonel Landsbury's private life. There was a first will made a few years before his marriage. The second was written at the birth of Adèle. And the third was done four months ago."
Instead of his "married to his work" line, Sherlock had proposed to John soon after moving here. Technically, John had been close behind as they both had blurted out, "Marry me" in the same minute. However, John had been faster for once in the reaction ("YES! GOD YES!"), so technically Sherlock won (not that anyone cared, Sherlock only had a spreadsheet for sexual favours, at least, until his body overruled his hard drive aka his brain during the first time. Sherlock had been chuffed, John had been so in love. He had slipped it out, "love," which had led to round two.).
A voice whispered: “Doctor, do not try it, I will release you and then slowly face me, you must not make a sound, tap my head if you understand.”
"Good old Watson! You are a fixed point in a changing age. There is an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. It is God's own wind, and a cleaner; better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared. Start her up, Watson, for it is time that we were on our way. I have a cheque for £500 which should be cashed early, for the drawer can quite stop it if he can."
“He sews down the bars of his cell. Do not ask me how he managed that. Further, he turned his bed linen into a rope to escape through the window.
The colonel's eyes, downcast, rested on the detective. If Lansbury had been angry with Holmes, all anger was gone, giving way to deep bitterness.
“Wrong question. You should ask yourself: How is it possible that Sherlock asked me to look after you when everyone believes him to be dead.”
Maybe it was the season that let me reply with the sentiment: "But if it is loving every day, would you then want it?"
Up there, I finally released a full breath. Arriving here, in Sherrington, had solved nothing. The melancholy overwhelmed me once more. I missed Holmes and his violin, or his sudden wish to stroll through the park, our arms linked.
It’s 1942 when I reach London. It’s the worst of times to come back to England, and also very fitting. When Mycroft set me on the case at the turn of the century, he already envisioned this battlefield. What better time to be Sherlock Holmes once more, than when the world explodes? Surely, my Watson would pen some lines about how we two will survive, and we will: I carry the honey with me.
"Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts" is a play by William Gillette and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, based on Conan Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes. After three previews it premiered on Broadway November 6, 1899, at the Garrick Theatre in New York City.
, and the violin music you heard is actually me playing. It helps me to think. What else do you need to know? Partners should
“And this is what my sister called ruthlessly but deep down a good man with some remaining brain cells.”
Bewildered, John discovered his suitcase was there, as well as all his keepsakes and souvenirs from childhood, university and army days alike. There was the small wooden box in which he had stored his dog tags and the bullet that had sent him home.
Suddenly, the fog in my brain cleared away to a horrific clarity. My pulse picked up. Could it be that I cracked it? That I, unassuming John Watson, have solved it all? Instantly, I went into action. It was almost as if I could hear my dear Holmes famous line, ‘The Game is Afoot’.
The Wife of Doyle demands that once a month all women are allowed in the tavern. Not to serve the men, but to talk about the men they serve in life and bed. No men may enter the tavern then.
It’s the Wife of Doyle that sums it up: "If their cocks were for sale, they would not be worth anything."
"I'm sorry to cause you all this inconvenience, Doctor. The colonel shouldn't have bothered you with this nonsense.
the wind ripped the cries from his lips. Below him was a sheer drop. He was afraid to look down. He was even more afraid to look back.
Footsteps were approaching. Sherlock was naked beside his dressing gown, loosely tied around his waist. Some water pearls were running down his bare chest. His hair was still damp, unruly curls making him look years younger, more carefree and off-guard.
Watson took off his heavy coat and scarf, which he had worn to counteract the harsh outside temperatures, and placed them on a coat rack, next to those of the other, adding his ever-present hat.
Without further delay, it's time for the canon (!) rimjob in "The Canterbury Tales" to get the Johnlock treatment. Last time to turn around, as from now on the rating is for a reason^^
The last act has been a pure show, and Sherlock discovers how much he craves it: an audience, willing, rapture, in awe.
John had believed it to be a smart idea: he had invited Mrs Hudson, Molly and Greg for the broadcast of the BBC interview. Even Scarlet could have been persuaded thanks to Mrs Hudson’s meddling and her excellent baking.
“As if I would let anything happen to you, my dear,” he whispered, at once reading my mind. “As you wrote in one of your stories yourself, I could have been a master criminal, but I solved crimes instead. That does not mean that I don’t know how to not get caught.” He caged me in, and I did not feel
08/16/2020: Thanks to my brilliant and ever-patient beta wildismazz, chapters 6-11 are heavily edited.
Snowy roads greeted us outside. Soon, we were snowed up to the ankles. Holmes was unusually silent. All he offered were indistinct grunts.
really means nothing to you?” At least he seemed to be more aware that I demanded an explanation or would be a punch to his face. After all, he was not the only one who had picked up boxing in his younger years. “Well,” he started, turning to the window overlooking Baker Street, so I could no longer observe his expressive face. “Watson, to cut it short: during the peak of your recent fever, you rather, to be quite honest, seduced me.”
He looked at me as if he had seen a ghost. I poured him a stiff drink and placed it into his hands. He certainly seemed as if he needed one. His constitution restored, Mr Jones said quietly, “My apologies, once more... But I thought...”
John went back to the bathroom and washed out his mouth. When he returned to the bedroom, Sherlock was already asleep in the white bed, snoring peacefully.
Although I had always tried to involve Holmes in the holidays, I had never succeeded. All the years, the uttermost we could engage him was to play some Christmas carols on his violin, but mostly he had remained almost motionless in his chair, smoking his pipe. He had only reacted when the smell of goose or Mrs Hudson’s biscuits had tinted the air. In particular, the latter was a secret weapon as my Holmes was a sweet tooth, and our landlady prepared it always for the occasion to his (not so) secret delight. The reason, he had explained to me repeatedly, that he was bored without a case to be carried out, and as the London criminals seemed to fall asleep during that time of year and his mood got darker. It had frightened me long before we had become lovers.
. “Scarlet is Sherlock’s protege. She will live here from now on. I hope that’s alright with you? I would have come downstairs today...”
"Mrs Nordon is going crazy. I urge you to do something, doctor." Stanley sounded agitated at this turn of events, perhaps a little ashamed too. He was tired, clearly visible from the dark circles under his eyes. How long had he been at his post? "She's been screaming for hours that she's innocent. She refuses to answer my questions. She just throws up. I believe she will end up in the asylum. Insanity could be one of the mitigating circumstances for the murder of the girl."
The reason, he had been explained over and over again, was that the detective was bored to death, without a case to play. London's delinquency seemed to doze off during that time of the year, making it burden him was a heavy cloak of boredom.
The governor had been so shocked that when he had wished us the greetings of the season, he had rushed to say first, “Merry Christmas, Dr Holmes...”, and only seconds later caught on and corrected, “Mr Holmes and Dr Watson, of course. A very, merry Christmas.”
I remembered having read something in the evening papers. Alternatively, Holmes had pointed it out to me, which is almost the same these days.
The trees were still with no buds, swaying like consumptive cripples in the wind, and casting dark shadows. Fine hoarfrost lay on their branches and twigs, which looked like bony arms that stretched out after us. To cut it short: the weather brought out my poetic nature. Though it might have been simply the aftermath of the severe fever that had plagued me until recently still clouded my view. Yet, I could not help but sense a feeling of foreshadowing, of coming to doom.
Violinists have tactile hands, long and thick, and apparently, one could use Sherlock’s skill set of observation and deduction to find the conclusion: drive John to orgasm in 10. Together with a clever tongue.
Yet, when he witnessed Bea’s breakdown, echoing his grief (“Everyone leaves me”), he reaches out to put his hand on her shoulder. And Watson made his last vow: “I’m not going anywhere.”
The carriage that Colonel Landsbury had owned had disappeared, along with its driver, Robert. Just like Adèle Landsbury, to never be seen again.
