No one had inhabited the room in the last eight years, except for Mycroft, which meant that every surface in the room held the last physical pieces of his brother. The only other place that held any physical part of Mycroft was the coffin that had traveled all the way back to District 12 with them, and was currently getting buried next to their mother and father’s graves by people Sherlock did not know or care about, simply because he couldn’t bear to watch his brother vanish underground, never to resurface.
“Yes,” Dean replied, and John immediately stood up to go back to his seat, but stopped when Dean spoke again. “It’s Harry Watson’s turn, now.”
As soon as Sherlock had bolted out of the door, John looked at Harry, for permission to go after him. With tears in her eyes, she nodded, and he followed after his boyfriend.
have gotten together if Mycroft survived. Even though Mycroft did consider it in chapter 24 (Last, or: the last conversation Mycroft has with Dean), Mycroft has no time for love or affection or a relationship, no matter who it's with. He and Dean would have, of course, remain close, and Dean would have remained Mycroft's best friend and his top advisor.
“No pens, no pencils. Do not accept anything he offers you. Do not let him touch you. Do not touch him –”
After reaching District Twelve, getting dolled up by the prep team, having dinner with the Mayor Undersee, and making the final speech, the Victory Tour was officially over. The next day was the Harvest Festival, which was normally a small celebration any other year, but since the Capitol was throwing the party this year because of John’s victory, it would be an all-out event. When John woke up the next morning, he first took a few moments to relish in the fact that he was in his own bed, and he could hear Sherlock’s quiet, slow breathing beside him, instead of the roar of the train travelling. He considered just staying in his room for the day – he didn’t need to make an appearance, really. The Harvest Festival wasn’t about John, it was about family. In the end, that’s what got John out of bed; other than a brief conversation the night before, he hadn’t had any communication with his family for the past two weeks.
“Oh, shut up, would you?” Harry asked, rolling her eyes. “Okay, we get it; you’re Sherlock Holmes – lead the way!”
Careful not to wake up Sherlock, he maneuvered himself into a sitting position and put on his prosthetic – an act that was now becoming as simple and automatic as breathing, and he hated himself for it. He felt like this was something he wouldn’t be able to get used to, like he wouldn’t forget what it was like to live with both legs intact, but he was, and surprisingly fast.
“What’s that?” Hamish asked, and Sherlock and John dropped their spat to see where Hamish was pointing: the dark marble wall behind Mycroft’s statue, still surrounded with small gifts and letters that would never be read and bouquets of various flowers (but mostly purple irises), especially today, split up into three sections by engravings – the rest of the memorial.
I just realized that there's less than ten chapters left of this thing. That's really weird and I don't like it.
At seven-thirty that night, the Watsons, Sherlock, and Mycroft all sat before the broadcast projection, save for Mrs. Watson, who was listening from the kitchen as she finished washing everyone’s dishes from dinner. On the screen, President Snow stood at a podium, with two people on each side of him, just in the background. On his right was a small girl in a white dress – his granddaughter – holding a wooden box, and on his left stood and older man in an ugly plaid suit, watching the audience of Capitol citizens below. Snow reminded Panem how the Quarter Quell came to be, of the previous two Quarter Quell’s twists, and the winners of those year’s Games.
“No more secrets,” John repeated, sitting down in the chair next to Sherlock, taking his hand, and beginning to read Mycroft’s letter for himself.
For now though, I’m going to give myself some time. I’m going to try to retrain my brain into thinking about something else other than this fic, I’m going to make some tiktoks, I’m going to watch some anime (mostly the swimming club anime) and Shameless (I know Shameless just ended, apparently, but I have a tendency to start shows just as they finish), and I’m going to go through my movies and shows that I’ve bought and watch
Could Harry even swim? Sherlock had no idea how to swim – he and John had found a pond once beyond District Twelve’s fence when they were fifteen – John had stripped off his clothes and learned, but Sherlock – he had been too embarrassed – he was in love with John and he was too nervous to take off his clothes –
As if he had turned on faucets full blast, Avoxes flooded through the stairwell, just as they had done before. It was like if Charles Augustus had built an invisible wall on either side, and now that he was gone the barrier was lifted. They streamed through, ignoring John, trying to get to the places they were ordered to go. There was the proof that time was moving again – the proof he had needed so desperately just moments ago – the Avoxes were moving around him, they were passing him and appearing and disappearing in and out of John’s line of sight.
“The conference room is down that hallway; the second door on the left,” he instructed, pointing. “The paparazzi are already in there; I’ll follow you shortly.”
“Remember the three S’s –” she began in a whisper, picking John’s shoulders of non-existent lint, and John found himself grinning at her before she could continue. She looked at him, and returned the smile. “– Perfect.”
But John knew that already, because Charles Augustus had touched him – and suddenly he could feel his hand on his face –
“Nice aim,” John complimented his sister as they ran, and was suddenly reminded of the last time he had said that to her, and her response:
The six of them – John, Sherlock, Harry, Louise, Alexander, and Antonia – began to leave, but then Sherlock stopped next to Dean, and, still looking down at the ground, he spoke.
“He cornered me in the stairwell,” John blurted out. “He somehow convinced the Avoxes not to come near us – there were no witnesses. He blew smoke in my face and mocked me and Sherlock and I thought that was going to be the worst of it, but then...” he paused mid-step, staring at a spot on the floor. “He called me...he called me Johnny Boy. Like when I was...you know. And he told me that if I touched him he would call sabotage and have me killed, because a mentor hurting a tribute from an opposing district would get the mentor killed, right?” he looked up at Mycroft.
“Dean,” he called, and John looked up to see that he was coming back, drink in hand. “Oh, thank you for thinking of me; I was just about to get myself a drink,” Mycroft said, reaching out and taking the cup from Dean.
John was about to carry Mycroft’s conversation, about to lead it as far away from what had happened in the stairwell as possible, but then Mycroft looked up.
“Yes,” James confirmed, his voice sounding like he was regretting this decision more and more with each passing second. “Like, we could all get together and just…talk about everything. Support each other, you know?”
“Just be yourself. They’re looking for a Johnlock update more than anything so just tell everyone how well you and Sherlock are doing. Sherlock?” Sherlock, who was letting someone apply lip gloss with a brush, raised an eyebrow in acknowledgement. “Have you given thought to what we discussed?”
So, Magnussen wouldn’t be going to the Cornucopia, which Sherlock was only slightly relieved to know, since the only way for Sherlock to get to the Cornucopia involved swimming through freezing cold saltwater.
But all of these people – Nana and the victors who weren’t part of the rebellion, who hadn’t traveled to the Capitol for that night – made it to the Capitol by the morning after the Battle for the first meeting with Dean. And they were all here, now – all dressed in black to honor the deceased.
Despite the fact that Sherlock and Harry were a mere fifty feet away, he didn’t want to let go of Mrs. Hudson. Because, if he did, it would mean he would have to get up on that stage, and choose between Sherlock Holmes and Harry Watson. And he couldn’t do that – he had tried to do it before and he couldn’t, letting Sherlock make the choice before him – and he still couldn’t imagine doing so, now.
He watched as Hannibal took in the news of Sherlock’s betrayal, smirking at the way his face fell as he thought of a proper rebuttal.
“And what would they do?” Sherlock asked, quietly enough so no one but John and Harry could hear. John looked up at him, and found his eyes alight with an excitement that he hadn’t seen since they had planned on escaping Panem. “What would they take from us they haven’t taken already?”
“Would you like to view his execution, Mr. Holmes?” the guard asked, for seemingly the second time, and Sherlock looked at the man to find him and Sherlock looked at the man to find him flipping the papers on top of the forms back over on his clipboard and placing the pen back in his pocket, even though Sherlock could not recall handing them back to him. “We can have it done and over with within the hour, if you’re willing to wait.”
“That’s right I am,” she said, nodding. Then she paused. “Seriously though, I wouldn’t have known about the tracker jackers if... I would’ve been dead if it wasn’t for you. So...thanks.”
“You,” John breathed. It was the girl from before – from far before – from what seemed like years ago – from days before John’s Games – and all at once he remembered what he had said to her –
It was always hard for Sherlock when John was lost like this – lost within his own head. It was probably even harder for John, and Sherlock always kept that in mind; Sherlock’s pain was irrelevant – this wasn’t about him. This was about John, and it would only ever be about John.
“Mycroft!” John gasped, spurting flecks of blood everywhere as he made the attempt to sit up, but found he was unable to lift himself from the bed – his torso and limbs were all strapped down. “Mycroft –?”
John nodded quickly, letting go of Mycroft and shaking himself out from under Mycroft’s hands. He took a moment to look around the room, trying to recover, and his eyes landed on the television screen, where Aurora Blake’s death was being announced.
Mycroft nodded, a ghost of a smile on his face as he put his hand on John’s shoulder. “You’re a good man, John Watson.” Before John could reply, Mycroft looked behind him, at Alexander. “Do you have it?”
“Sherlock,” Harry Watson repeated, putting her hand on his shoulder, pushing him back, forcing his head up to look at her. “Sherlock –”
There was only one thing tugging at his mind – something that Mycroft would’ve had to think about, too, surely –
He went on and on, bashing the Capitol and Kitty Riley and the paparazzi and Dean for allowing this to happen, but then he heard Sherlock speak, very quietly from behind him, and John cut himself off.
And so, when John took Sherlock’s shirt and pulled it over his head, Sherlock returned the gesture and removed John’s shirt without a second thought, for their clothes were only serving as unnecessary barriers between them. Because, after everything, after everything the Capitol had done to them and all the walls they and the Games had put between them, a few layers of cotton seemed like nothing, now. Within just a few minutes, they had completely taken off each other’s clothes and discarded them on the floor.
“How old was Steven when you won the Games, Dean?” John asked. He had seen their stats – the Tributes’ stats were posted all over the Capitol, just in case the citizens of the Capitol forgot them – Steven was twenty-nine, and Julia was twenty-eight.
and I would’ve been able to help! But you didn’t!” she exclaimed, standing now, striding up to Sherlock.
Finally, at twelve o’three, according to Sherlock, there was a knock on the door – two slow knocks, and then two quick knocks. John was surprised they could hear it through the bricks, but they did.
“So you’re President of Panem, now?” Sherlock voiced his deduction, sticking his hands into his sweatpants’ pockets.
“How’s Caesar Flickerman doing, by the way?” Sherlock asked, after a moment. “Last I heard from President Bainbridge he was in good spirits.”
“Boys,” Dean said quietly, standing behind them, and both boys looked up. “Are you ready to continue?” he asked John, and John nodded.
“I dunno, support?” John replied, shrugging. “There are a few people there who bring someone with them for that. Mothers, boyfriends, girlfriends…”
“If, in the surprising turn of events that I am able to freely leave the Capitol after everything I’ve said here, today, I intend to disappear. Dismantle who I was, brick by brick, and leave.”
“I could ask you the same question,” Sherlock replied. “You lost people, too. And you haven’t slept at all,” he added, voicing the deduction he had made the moment he had seen Dean talking to the cameraman.
“Just go, Harry – Sherlock will be right behind you,” John promised, and Harry shrugged and entered the elevator, letting the doors close behind her.
And, even though there were moments where John could still feel Charles Augustus Magnussen’s hands on him, and Sherlock still found tears in his eyes whenever it snowed, they were happily married, and were still,
Sherlock felt his throat seize up. Just days ago, he wanted nothing more than to tell Harry about what had happened to the three year old boy, but now he couldn’t bring himself to say a word.
He left the paper on the desk in his room, and, realizing it was about midnight and he hadn’t eaten since yesterday, he left the bedroom to find something to eat. The penthouse was dark and quiet, with only the dots of lit windows of buildings in the distance providing the room’s light. It was obvious that everyone had gone to bed, and so would Sherlock, in a minute. He crossed into the kitchen, found a fruit bowl in the middle of the dining table, and picked up an apple. It was then he heard a voice.
“You were in the Arena, Sherlock. It was after Aurora was killed – I had asked him how often something like aftermath of Aurora’s murder happens in the Arena –” he explained, knowing that Sherlock would pick up the words that John wasn’t saying. “And that’s when he told me that most victors belong to the Capitol after winning their Games. And how I avoided that part of my victory because of my relationship with you, and how Mycroft avoided it by making the deal with Snow – but I hadn’t thought about it until now – and I had no idea that – he didn’t tell me anything about that –” he added quickly, and Sherlock nodded, slowly lowering himself back down. “Jesus – how does someone even go about
He also ended up going to the pond in which John learned how to swim in (and Sherlock regretted his refusal of learning how to swim), John’s old house, Sherlock’s old shack in the Seam, and the alleys in which Sherlock taught John how to dance in and where John and Sherlock shared their first conversation. There was even a night (two months, twenty days, six hours, sixteen minutes, and forty-five seconds after) where Sherlock found himself sobbing in the middle of the destroyed bakery.
“Cinna, isn’t Ms. Price and Mary Morstan’s prep team here to look after Sherlock?” Mycroft asked, obviously anxious to get rid of him.
Sherlock and Dean enter Mycroft's room; Sherlock finds what Mycroft left behind; Dean shares a piece of Mycroft's history, and a secret of his own.
Given the fact that Charles Augustus Magnussen would make Sherlock reveal John's assault before he killed him (because of course he would), everyone would know what Magnussen's capable of. So, they would make sure that Charles Augustus Magnussen was arrested, rescue John if they needed to, and then things would quickly turn into the eighth Sad AU:
Alexander raced them to an exit door, one of which people were also flooding through, and John and Harry quickly followed him. With a simple glance around, John recognized the place: it was the hallway that contained the dressing rooms and the storage room – John had been in this very hallway with Mycroft before the interviews. Everyone who had also found themselves in the hallway was sprinting to the emergency exit door on their right, and for a second John that they too would go to the door, but Alexander to the left – further down the hallway.
The next day, from the moment they exited the train, the Capitol’s cameras were on them, and there were reporters surrounding the four of them from all sides, shouting questions at them – questions none of them wanted to answer, especially not out loud to paparazzi.
“Seeing as Mycroft was the person who did this – who started the rebellion, thought up the plan, killed President Snow, effectively saved Panem – I thought a separate memorial should be held for him, after the more generalized one. Those of us who knew him well would say a few words, and we’d give our final goodbyes to him. You, of course, are his brother, and the only member of the Holmes family left, so I wanted to ask you: Would you rather Mycroft’s memorial service not included in the broadcast, and just have it between the all of us, here?” he asked, gesturing to the door, and, by extension, the people who were beyond it. “There would be no paparazzi allowed, so there’s no way of anything getting out that way, in case you were worried about that. I also thought that –”
And that left John wanting to know: did Sherlock really not understand? He was a fucking genius – he knew everything – surely he knew that nothing would ever be the same, after being in the Games. John knew it from the second he won, maybe even before then. Sherlock had seen three of his closest friends and family members go into the Arena and come out alive – he had to have known that just because you go home doesn’t mean things will just go back to the way they were. Too much had changed – Sherlock had changed, the world had changed, people had been lost – just because Sherlock went home it didn’t mean Mycroft would come back to life.
Mycroft cleaned obsessively – dusted the surfaces of the rooms of their house every other day, moving the rug in the middle of his room to sweep each night before bed, doing the dishes after each and every meal, washing his bedspread once a week without fail. Every object in the house had a place, and Mycroft would put every object into that place, making sure it fit there exactly to his liking before moving on. He had always been like this, even when they were children, their mother would call her boys “organized chaos” when they were together – Mycroft made up the organized and Sherlock made up the chaos. The dust was so unlike Mycroft that it almost ruined the room in general, to Sherlock.
Their family had never missed a graduation – the celebration (congratulating and acknowledging the graduating kindergarten class, then the fourth grade class, then the eighth grade class, and then, finally, the twelfth grade class) was held on the Justice Building stage, the only place where the audience containing most of District 12 could fit comfortably. The families of the graduating classes would bring blankets to sit on, and cheer for each graduate as they crossed the stage. If this went badly, Harriet Watson would have only walked across that stage three times, once when she was six for graduating kindergarten, once when she was ten for graduating fourth grade, and once when she was fourteen for graduating eighth grade. If Magnussen killed her, she would never cross that stage to celebrate her graduating from twelfth grade – she would never turn seventeen, much less eighteen.
The moment Charles Augustus Magnussen, an older man from District 1, was reaped into the Games, Mycroft’s eyes closed tightly, as if he was wincing in pain.
A wave of relief and uncertainty washed over John. Snow was dead, which was undoubtedly better for Panem as a whole, but what was to happen now? How would they even begin to pick up the pieces? Maybe the meeting today would shed some light on those questions.
It was only when the air around them changed that Sherlock noticed that they were outside. The warm summer night air felt wrong on his skin, like the world wasn’t allowed to change after what had happened since the interview. He looked away from the space in front of him to look around the Capitol’s City Circle, assessing the damage.
He glanced through the audience – through the thirty-two past victors before him – wanting to scan through and deduce what each person would ask, but his mind was too preoccupied trying to keep himself from spilling his deepest secrets unprompted.
And suddenly they were in the middle of the fray – touching each other’s faces, to ensure the other was really there – really alive, just in this moment –
As the four of them made their way out of the tiny crawlspace where they had spent the last four hours (give or take), John looked up at Antonia. Her eyes then cast over the group, and John could see what she was looking for: she was seeing if everyone was accounted for. He saw her eyes land on each of them, before looking deeper within the room, looking for Mycroft. The question was in her eyes for a moment, but when she blinked it was gone – she didn’t need to ask, because she knew the answer.
“And, because of that day, I was able to do the exact same thing eight years later, after my brother won his Hunger Games – not because of a bet, but because I wanted to. I had no way of knowing that he was going to...that a mere sixth months later, he would be... But knowing what I know now, those days with Mycroft, with our brothers off doing who-knows-what together, will be my favorite memories of him.
“What?” he mumbled, turning his head Sherlock’s way, his voice slightly slurred by his body slowly shutting down to sleep just to be used again. “Who did what, now?”
“His name was Athan Norbury,” Dean said, and Sherlock nodded, not finding anything he could say about the matter.
She glared down at her hands folded on her lap, and Mycroft held onto one, and John held onto the other.
Sherlock seemed to spend his days bouncing between three states of mind. Sometimes he would brood silently, curled up on the couch or on his bed, or sitting upright but just staring out into space. Sometimes he would be overly affectionate to John; hugging him more often for as long as he could get away with, and kissing him deep into the night – desperate to act as if things were normal or to get as much as he could in before he was gone. Then there were some days where he was as focused as he could ever be on the Games – asking Mycroft and John about what everything was like – the reaping, the Capitol, the interviews, training, the Games themselves –
“You go shower and get dressed in your room, I’ll shower and get dressed in mine, and we’ll meet each other in the sitting room in fifteen minutes – are you okay with using the elevator?” John asked, and Sherlock nodded. “Okay – remember to wear something nice –” John said, gave Sherlock a peck on the lips, and they went their separate ways – Sherlock to his room, while John stayed in his.
“I still can’t believe they did that. I mean – everyone knows you as Sherlock. Even the Capitol knows you as Sherlock.”
– he was just letting it happen. He was letting himself die. And, if he was completely honest with himself, he wasn’t completely sure whether he wanted to die or not. Yes, he wanted to stay alive for John and Harry – he wanted to get better for them and to be happy again for them – but they were just about the only things keeping him alive. At the end of the day, if he was alive, he was alive, and if he was dead, well…
The Victory Tour always started the second week of January, just after Sherlock's birthday on the sixth. It had always been this way, and showed no sign of changing. Still, John wasn't the first person to leave Sherlock for the Victory Tour; Sherlock’s brother, Mycroft Holmes, had also won the Hunger Games almost nine years ago, meaning he had to go on the Tour, too. Since Mycroft was a mentor for the tributes in the Hunger Games, he was John’s mentor, and the mentors of the Hunger Games victor were required to come with their victor on the Tour. Just as he had six months ago, Sherlock would be temporarily without the two most important people in his life.
“I wouldn’t be happy if you were just doing it for everyone but yourself. I know everyone’s been pressuring us about it, but the point is that
“John,” Mycroft looked back at him, putting his hands on John’s shoulders. John reached up and gripped Mycroft’s wrists, trembling, crying, looking him in the eyes. “He does not. Own you. He never will, John. If he wins – the second he gets here – he’s going to die. I swear on my life, he will not touch you again.”
“It’s an honor to meet you, Sherlock,” she said, reaching out and shaking his free hand, even though he had never even raised his hand an inch to offer it to her. She spoke with an air of authority, but also way too excitedly for a person speaking to someone who had just lost the last member of their family that they had left. “We have been dreaming about this day for years, but none of this would’ve been possible without your brother. I am just so sorry that he didn’t make it to the other side like the rest of us. But, if it helps, he made a noble, valiant sacrifice for the good of –”
Dean then looked down at his shoes, and Sherlock knew that he was trying to figure out where to start. He stayed quiet for a long, long, time – for at least five minutes that felt like it had stretched into years – and then, finally, he spoke:
John woke up three hours after Mycroft had sent him to sleep, the sleeping pill unable to keep his anxiousness from his head. When John realized that it was now an acceptable time to be awake, he left his room and went to the sitting room, to find Mycroft watching the Hunger Games.
“How do they work?” he asked, looking back at Magnussen. “Hm? Do they have to be on someone to work?” he quickly put the glasses on him, watching both the lens and Magnussen before him. “No –”
“I know,” Mycroft replied. “I tried to convince them to put you in a darker shade, but they wanted you to match John’s iris.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply, but then, with nothing but a wave goodbye in Sherlock’s direction, Hannibal Lecter Magnussen walked away from them, out of the building.
passed up an opportunity to make deductions, whether consciously or unconsciously – out loud or not – whether to show off, to prove that he could do it, or because he literally could not refuse, because he couldn’t stop himself fast enough.
Harry scrambled to her feet and, as soon as she was standing, Sherlock stepped to the side, blocking her from Magnussen’s view. Harry – being Harry, of course – was having none of that, and stepped up next to Sherlock, out of his protection.
But he did not go to bed. He sat up, all night, alone with a bottle of vodka in his hand, watching Sherlock sleep, and watching Harry watch over him.
There was something tugging at the back of his mind, though – something happened that he couldn’t quite remember, yet...
John nodded. He understood the situation, and he did like Alexander and was warming up to Dean, but that didn’t mean he wanted to be cooped up with multiple career victors all day with no one from the outlying districts to serve as a buffer. What he really wanted was to see his sister and Sherlock.
Emmettson Blasscliffe. John had never heard of the man before Sherlock’s detox – probably hadn’t even seen him on the streets of District 12 – but Sherlock obviously had. In fact, he had seen him enough to deduce that he had a supply of Morphling that Sherlock could tap into free of charge, fueling the addiction that almost killed him as a teenager, and now again, almost seven years later.
“And what about you, before the Games? You had to have a job, didn’t you?” River asked, but it was Dean who answered for him.
“Jesus,” John murmured, trying to imagine what that could be like. The fog had fucked with his head so much he still couldn’t remember how many times he had stabbed Philip Anderson through his own eyes, as opposed to remembering what he had seen during the recap. But living like that all the time? That would drive anyone irreversibly insane.
“Anxiety, then?” Hannibal asked. “That’s perfectly all right, to feel a little anxiety; it gets easier, over time.” He winked, and suddenly John knew that he was not talking about anxiety over something simple.
They got off the train, all together, and were led by Peacekeepers to District 11’s city hall. It was like a carbon copy of District Twelve, and every other District before them, probably. All the Districts had a station, had a city hall, had a place to gather, had children who died, children who were reaped, children who would never be the same again –
Sherlock nodded as Dean let him go, and with one final goodbye and a friendly reminder to take care of each other, the two were gone, leaving the three alone in the Victor’s Village – a population that was double that just under a week ago.
They could all hear the guns firing behind them – but only Sherlock and Mycroft were able to break down exactly what was happening back within the smoke cloud: one Peacekeeper stood at each opening of the hallway, and all three of them were shooting into the corridor blindly, in the hopes of hitting someone – in the hopes of slowing them down –
“You’re from the Capitol?” Sherlock asked, watching her over Louise’s shoulder from where he was sitting with John and Harry on the sofa. “Also, who are you and how do you know John?”
. If you knew about what he had done you would’ve thrown all caution to the wind in order to kill him.”
“It’s a Stradivarius; one of the best violins ever made. He was really confident you would win, despite your self-sacrificial plan to save Harry. He planned on giving it to you himself; teach you how to play, but…”
“Anything’s better than that elevator,” Sherlock replied, and so John thanked the Avox and then they too made the descent down to the training center.
“The first twenty-four hours are always the most difficult,” Sherlock found himself saying, trying to give him some sort of comfort.
, not around his ankle alone. If he were wearing regular sneakers then the rope would be around his ankle – there'd be no hope of escape.
After Sherlock, John, and Mycroft changed into black outfits of varying degrees of formality (Mycroft in a three-piece suit despite the summer weather, John in a button up shirt and dress pants, and Sherlock in a black t-shirt and jeans that weren’t nearly as worn as Harry’s), the four went to the center of town together. They walked in a straight line, shoulder to shoulder through the streets of District 12, Sherlock and Harry in the middle and John and Mycroft beside their siblings.
The instant John Watson started to take off his clothes, Sherlock’s eyes engaged in a war between staring at his friend point-blank as he undressed and looking at everything except for the space John’s body occupied. Luckily, the latter side won out, and Sherlock found himself craning his neck to survey the position of the sun as he spoke.
John knew the ending to the story, but he still wanted Will to win, and when it finally came down to it, John could not watch Will Graham die. His eyes snapped shut, and he heard Will’s screams as Hannibal tore through his flesh with his teeth and ate his beating heart.
“Relax, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, holding up his hand to silence his brother. “They want your reunion with John to be public, like it was last year.”
He then let Sherlock go, but Sherlock held on. Mycroft looked to Alexander Waters. “Take him. Go. For the love of everything that we’ve done here today, go.”
“John found me one night, trying to drink myself to death, apparently. I don’t remember much of that night.”
“Surely, you all know who I am,” she began, trying to smile, and a few people muttered greetings to her. “My little Abbie is in the Games, this year.”
Again, Harry was able to tell right away the next morning when she saw them, but she didn’t scream about it like she had last time, much to Sherlock and John’s relief. She did, however, stare at them, silent and slack-jawed, for about a minute straight, before finally forcing her mouth closed and finally asking if they really did it. Upon Sherlock’s quiet confirmation (as John was too embarrassed to speak), Harry nodded, giving them both a thumbs up, and then excusing herself to her room, which is where she finally did unleash the whoops of joy the two boys had been waiting for (and fearing).
“That was the longest five minutes of my entire life,” Harry decided as Sherlock sat down next to her.
“I’m glad to hear that he’s recovering nicely, from what my brother did to him,” Magnussen said, nonchalant, and grinned when Sherlock set his jaw. “Tell me, does he know you’re here today, by any chance?”
Sherlock and Harry looked at each other. They had seen this tactic played out many times before – the Capitol coaxing the tributes out of their hiding places with the promise of food. Sometimes there would be food at these feasts, and sometimes there wouldn’t be, but there was always death. They knew this was a trap.
Sherlock was the person that John worried the most about. The Watsons were a strong family, on an emotional level; John himself had survived a whole year of post-traumatic stress after his Games, proving to himself that he was capable of continuing to survive, and John knew his sister, and knew that she too would survive. Now, this wasn’t to say that the Holmes’ were by any means emotionally weak, it was just that the Holmes family (the members John knew, at least) tended to numb themselves to feelings, while the Watson’s felt the emotions and dealt with them. This meant that, unfortunately, the Holmes brothers never learned how to properly deal with whatever emotions they stifling, so when there was an emotion so strong that it broke through the numbness, they felt it so much more, and had no idea how to cope.
The next day, Harry went to school, adding it to her routine, and, though John knew she would never admit it, it seemed to help take her mind off things. She poured herself into her schoolwork, coming home with extra credit assignments, even though she didn’t need them – her grades soared higher than they ever were before the Games. She was far less sociable, though, according to her teachers; she spent her lunch period in the classroom, working as she ate. When John brought it up to Harry, she shrugged. Most of her class, even the kids who had moved to District 12 from other Districts, avoided her completely, which she was fine with, or they pretended to be her friend just to befriend someone famous, which she was less fine with.
“Um...hullo,” he murmured, and remembered that his voice was hoarse. He cleared his throat and went on. “I know you don’t need to follow orders, anymore, since Snow is dead and no one I know would make you still have to follow orders, and I know I have no right to ask for this, but I was wondering if any of you could do me a huge favor, anyway?”
“Well, when you think about it, you would’ve missed out on the joys of mentoring anyway,” John noted. “Since Snow wanted me to sentence you to death.”
The two tributes got onto their chariots, and Sherlock, with one look at John’s face, leaned forward to speak with him.
Sherlock could hear the spike in his heart rate through the ever-beeping monitor as the thought of what his elder brother had done to John and the possibility of Hannibal doing the same to Sherlock (or something far worse) in revenge for killing Charles Augustus crossed his mind, and for a moment he thought about calling out, calling for a nurse, calling for someone to save him. Instead of doing that, though, he acted as if the monitor wasn’t revealing the fear in his heart, and replied to Hannibal.
Sherlock glanced up, trying to find Harry. His eyes passed over Charles Augustus Magnussen, who had a curved knife on the platform before him – Sherlock vaguely remembered seeing his brother use it in his Games’ recording – that’s all he needed though – because after that Hannibal Lecter Magnussen used his
The moment he was outside, back under the light of the summer sun, Sherlock found his head tilting upwards toward the sky. He closed his eyes, and was surprised to feel tears escape from them.
It was then a person who seemed to be entirely made out of irises jumped into John’s field of vison.
As they walked to their room, Sherlock noticed it was a bad day for John’s left leg – Sherlock could tell by the severity of his limp. Normally, John would’ve taken his cane if he wanted to walk on days like this, but Sherlock knew his lack of it had less to do with not needing it, and more to do with trying to look as strong as he could.
And that was the end of the difficult speeches, for now. Districts 5, 4, 3, and 2 held no difficult people. Not even District 1 – the false home of Jim Moriarty – held anyone that difficult. Sure, John would have to say
Inside the building, Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson introduced John to District 11’s mayor, and the victors who had won before – who would be standing on the stage with John, reminding the District that it just wasn’t their year – that they had winners, too. But John was the special one, this year –
“And I told you I don’t care. What do you think can be done about it?” John asked. “How do you think we can avoid using it?”
As soon as he posed the question to himself, Sherlock’s memory was abruptly flooded with the sound of John’s screams of fear from last year, and he instinctively gripped onto his dog tags, still under his wetsuit.
“Childhood,” John whispered, his eyes watering. He tried to keep the tears from falling down his cheeks and smudging the make up the prep team applied. “I remember when nothing ever happened to me. I want to go back there.”
Feeling as if reaching through an atmosphere made of gelatin, John pushed past the memory and pulled Sherlock’s hand out of his pocket. John looked up at him, finding Sherlock smiling sheepishly, apologetically, blushing. John smiled back – a condescending smile, as if to say “not here, Sherlock – we’re in public.” He then stopped walking toward Caesar, took both of Sherlock’s hands in his, and kissed his boyfriend deeply, in front of everyone in the Capitol. The audience went wild with applause, and Sherlock deepened the kiss, his tongue pushing itself into John’s mouth. Feeling the heat on his own face, John figured he was probably as red as a cherry from all of the blushing. They were making out, quite passionately, in public – on national television – but John followed Sherlock’s lead; the audience was loving it, anyhow.
“...What’s he doing with his hands?” John asked, after a moment. He had seen a few people back in Twelve do something similar – he had seen
“Nobody deceives like an addict,” Sherlock said quietly, and John shook his head, his forehead still pressed against Sherlock’s.
Mycroft was furious, but then again Sherlock knew that the second John jumped aboard the chariot during the opening ceremony. In fact, he was surprised he couldn’t hear Mycroft bellow
Finally, they reached the set of double doors that served as the main entrance to Caesar’s building. John had no idea what was waiting for them beyond those doors. He glanced at Sherlock – could he take much more tonight?
“I wouldn’t miss it,” Sherlock assured John, knowing that that would touch him – he knew that John was more than aware of the fact that Sherlock hated the publicity that they still got, and that he’d rather skip out on the book release, but the thought that he wouldn’t miss it, even if it was just because he loved John and wanted to support him, would ease his mind.
So. Work's been difficult and it's going to be difficult for the next few weeks. So I'm posting this chapter, and then the next chapter will be arriving in about three weeks, when work will (hopefully) be less difficult.
Sherlock felt his stomach twist inside itself with guilt. She wasn’t just going to lose a friend...she was going to lose a brother, too.
For a moment, John considered Sherlock’s idea – letting them find them. Letting them kill them. He let the thought go as quickly as it came – shoving out of his mind –
“John Watson...you keep me right, which I think is the greatest compliment I can ever give a person. You took me in when no one else would, and you took my heart along with me. You’ve always been there for me, and I wish things were different so I could always be there for you, but this is the way things are, no matter how much we hate it.”
“She’s doing well,” Mycroft replied. “She happened to wake up before I left to come here, insisted that she was not actually awake and that she was only just getting some food and then returning to bed, and she told me not to tell ‘Hudders,’ who I can only assume to be Mrs. Hudson. I don’t think she even realized that I was fully dressed and just about to leave. She did hug me, though.”
Sherlock almost had the thought to scoff at the words John had chosen – there was no amount of doctors or time or anything that could ever possibly “fix this.”
“You convinced the Gamemakers to let the mentors in on what they’re doing?” John asked, a little too loudly, and Mycroft instantly shushed him.
“Remember what I know,” Mycroft told President Snow, voice dangerous, and John made a mental note to ask Mycroft what he meant.
“I know everyone who’s watching this – everyone in the nation, really – knows who I am, and probably knows this whole story better than I do, at this point, but I couldn’t figure out a way to start this without an introduction, so I’m going to introduce myself anyway: my name is Sherlock Holmes, and I am Mycroft’s younger brother,” he started quickly, tripping over his brother’s name, and then took a breath. He had to slow down – he was going to hyperventilate if he continued talking that fast. He tried again. “Therefore, since I am his
And it was at that moment Sherlock fully realized the weight of something that John had merely glossed over in his story.
“No, they did care. They were spending all that time making weaponry, waiting for an opportunity to strike again.”
“Alexander is going to guard you until you’re called out onto the stage while I change out of this and meet with the others,” Mycroft said, and then turned John around to face him, lifting the visor away from his face, taking away the barrier between them. “I need you to listen to me closely, John. Something is going to happen, here – right here, on that stage. From the moment you join us, it could be at any second. All I ask of you is to get control of the room and when you have it, don’t lose it. Stall for time. Can you do that?”
“I think you’re helping just fine,” John argued, but Sherlock shook his head, because he wasn’t. He voiced this confession, saying out loud for the first time that he felt useless, because he wanted to help – he
There was one day that Sherlock could barely stand it – the ache in his chest, the need to be closer to John, the feeling of John’s erection between them as they kissed – and Sherlock, who had been straddling John on the couch the whole time, made a decision he thought he would never make.
“Hey, um. This is gonna sound stupid but it’s been driving me nuts ever since we got out of the Arena...I need to know and I want to hear it from you: did you ask Sherlock to die for me?” Harry asked quickly, her voice echoing against the walls of the auditorium, and John’s mouth fell open before the words found their way past.
*If you haven't read Hungerlock yet, please stop reading. Just know this is an A+ prime time to read Hungerlock* ANYWAY.
The crowd went crazy with affection for them, cheering for John and for Johnlock – everyone was quite aware that Sherlock was only there because John was. They were delighted to see Sherlock and John holding each other’s hands, of course, but John couldn’t help but think of the fact that everyone thought they were having sex. Sherlock was probably also thinking about that, because while John was waving to the audience, he let go of John’s hand to place it in John’s furthest back pocket. This earned an extra few whoops and whistles from the crowd, but John was trying to hold back laughter at how uncharacteristic this was for Sherlock.
He approached the desk in his room, where five envelopes lay, with John’s messy scrawl on the front of each of them:
That was the last really good day Sherlock and John had. They had other good days, of course – a whole three months’ worth.
As soon as Sherlock entered the room, he could see him – his white prison jumpsuit and greying hair standing out against the dark grey room he was held in.
“Sorry; my name is James Hewlett, from District One. We haven’t met, but my sister, Helen, was in the Hunger Games with you. I was also part of the Mockingjay Alliance, I knew your –”
“Whatever,” Sherlock spat in response – reciting what they had agreed would be Sherlock’s way of telling John that he had done great. “Won’t matter anyway,” he went on, loud enough for Hannibal Lecter Magnussen to hear.
about this – about the fact that I was here, about the fact that you’ve been giving this shit to Sherlock, about
“Did I ever tell you the story of the East Wind?” Sherlock asked John one night, as they were both trying (and failing) to fall asleep.
The parachutes couldn’t have come fast enough, but Harry was still thankful as hell. Despite her legs feeling like they were made of gelatin, she still practically leaped at the first package that came her way.
Everyone watches the Hunger Games recap; Sherlock, Harry, and Mycroft attend the victory banquet; John has a question for Dean; Sherlock misses John.
The jabberjays mated with the mockingbirds – the unnatural genes that the Capitol created to make the jabberjays mixing with the natural genes the mockingbirds were born with – creating the birds who copied melodies instead of words.
In this bonus scene, Sherlock discovers exactly what his feelings for John entail (hint: THEY WEREN'T EXACTLY 100% PLATONIC ALL THIS TIME), and he quickly realizes that John will never like him back.
There was a moment of stillness in the world, apart from those twelve chariots, the horses not knowing how to do anything else but keep going. Silence washed through the crowd, and John had no idea what to do to win them back. Luckily, Sherlock did. Still with their hands together, fingers intertwined, Sherlock pulled John’s hand up to his lips, and John looked at him and smiled.
“I picked your clothes out for you,” Mycroft informed John as they rode the elevator up. “I hope you’ll find them suitable.”
And, as John knew far too well, the real monsters in the Arena kept whoever they found interesting, just to make the final kill that much more dramatic.
“He may have gotten the leg up on me that night, but he showed his hand, too: he knows everything there is to know about everyone, even our darkest secrets. He attacks people who are different and preys on their fears.”
They walked, hand in hand, back to the train. They did not speak until they were in the clearing, and John pointed ahead. “Look,” he said quietly.
They made eye contact, and Snow grinned, and that was when reality broke the spell – broke into John’s brain, and as soon as it did there wasn’t any way for him to shake it. He wanted to stay in this moment of happiness forever – he wanted Sherlock and Harry to live in ignorance for as long as they could – but he knew that if he didn’t tell them something – anything – now, he wouldn’t get a chance to before everything went to shit.
And then he turned back around, placed his hand on the knob, and left Hannibal behind. He strode past the guard, who quickly locked the door once more before jogging up next to Sherlock as he walked.
“Oh, but why not?” Magnussen asked smugly from behind him, completely calm. “I’ve already done it; the only thing to do now is kill me –”
“Very funny, little brother, but I thought I would do what I’ve been taught to do best and mentor John.”
“Oh – it’s fine. What were you trying to tell me, though?” John asked, Mycroft raised his chin, looking down at Seneca Crane.
He fought to keep his head up as he walked to the podium, trying to hold on to the confidence he had exhibited the last few times he had talked to Hannibal Lecter Magnussen.
Mostly likely, Sherlock and Harry and Mrs. Hudson were all wondering where exactly he was. He also had missed lunch in order to attend the meeting with President Snow, and his stomach was growling.
Sometimes, Sherlock ended up going to places more than once – he found himself returning to the meadow and John’s old house the most. The last night Sherlock went out, however, just when Sherlock thought he had run out of new places for him to go, Sherlock found that he had led himself to a place he had never been before: the District 12 cemetery.
Sherlock looked down at the clothes in his outstretched hand, and slowly his body moved to retrieve it. The cotton fabric felt foreign to him, but he held onto it for dear life and somehow made it to the bathroom even though he couldn’t exactly remember moving his feet there.
He heard the sound of more guns being fired, and immediately threw his body over his brother’s, trying to keep him safe as he shuddered underneath him, but Sherlock felt no pain.
Sherlock, John, and Mycroft return to District 12 from the Victory Tour; the four attend the annual harvest ceremony; Sherlock and John plan their escape; the twist for the Quarter Quell is announced.
because I don’t want you to think for even a second that it’s him that’s touching you and not me. And I know that you’ll think that it’s him – that your mind will go there no matter what, so… Yes, I think you should go.”
They walked hand-in-hand to District 9’s Justice Building, and Sherlock could feel himself dreading the moment he would have to leave John’s side – it creeping into his heart. Sure, when John would be making his speech Sherlock would be a mere ten feet from him, but he wished to be
“They did, indeed,” Mycroft replied. “Her name was Mischa. She disappeared the night before her first reaping ceremony; the year after Hannibal won. No one knows what happened to her, but I think I have a good idea.”
And then Clover Frankland joined the group, waving at Mycroft to get his attention and signing something quickly – something John hadn’t been taught, yet. Instead of translating for John, Mycroft signed a simple “thank you” and left it at that, much to John’s confusion, but he didn’t mention it.
“Yes, somewhere,” Sherlock replied, and rinsed his mouth and spat out the water. “This can’t be the only place there is – even if everywhere else is like the outskirts, there’s got to be
“It’s only been a few minutes,” she informed him, her eyes following him as he walked back and forth. “You saw the people who went to see Dean after the broadcast ended – he had to talk to them, first.”
Of course, Sherlock was going to prove them wrong. John would be pissed at him for it – in fact, he had warned him against showing off before dropping Sherlock off for his evaluation.
Then it was John’s turn. He had no idea where to look, so he just looked at the untouched food as he spoke:
Because he knew that they had no other choice, seeing as the knife was still in his hand. And yes, Sherlock had his brother’s sword, but Magnussen was closer to Harry – if Sherlock tried to attack him, Magnussen would automatically kill Harry in retaliation.
“HEY,” Sherlock felt as if he was roaring as he quickly closed in on them in the fastest walk he could manage. He could feel everyone staring – tributes and trainers and Gamemakers and Peacekeepers alike – but he didn’t care. Before Charles could touch her, Sherlock said the first thing that came into his mind: “Harry... Hi.” He could have punched himself in the face right there, but he had stopped Magnussen, and that’s what mattered.
“You revealed on national television that you were head-over-heels in love with me when you thought that I was going to die, unafraid of the consequences. You loved me at my worst moments. Christ – you’re giving your life for my sister. If that doesn’t prove it to them I don’t know what will. And you know if anyone says a bad word about you I’ll tell them exactly where they can shove it.”
The broadcasted announcements didn’t differ much from the announcements Dean had made a few moments before – he explained what had happened the night before and of Mycroft’s role as the creator of the Mockingjay Rebellion, announced that members of the Districts can now move around to other Districts freely, the freedom and release of the Avoxes, and the memorial service of those involved in the Rebellion who lost their lives during the Battle For Panem – but John still hung on to every word.
When the meeting was over, about two thirds of the thirty-three people in the audience started to get up and begin to take their leave, while the other third got up to meet Dean as he emerged from the door he had entered about ninety minutes ago, all with their own private questions or statements.
But finally, Dean took the stage again and asked if there were any more people who would like to speak, and when no one stood, he ended the service with the announcement that there would be a monument built where the training center currently stood, to commemorate all those who had passed because of the Hunger Games and the rebellion. Once the cameras were off, Dean called for a thirty-minute intermission before Mycroft’s service, to allow for Hal to make sure that Mycroft’s service would only be broadcasted to District 12, and so anyone who wanted to could eat lunch.
I'm just about finished with Constantly? Which is really fucking weird. Note the 73 chapters that I'm pretty sure is the final number of chapters for this fic, if I've done my math right. I hope it's 73 - it's a Good Number #OCDproblems.
Dean and Alexander chuckled, and they all said goodbye to John as they walked out, leaving Antonia and John alone.
He looked back up at the screen, to find his sister go back into the swarm, and pull Sherlock out, dragging him by his clothes.
“No – it’s not a step back,” Sherlock said, cutting him off. “We’re just standing still for a bit. We can afford to stand still. It’s nothing we can’t get through.” Slowly, Sherlock kissed him again. “I know that I can’t take it away or make it better but...I can try, right?”
Sherlock looked at his boyfriend, and tried to be encouraging. “You’ve only got eleven more to go,” he said, and John looked back at him. “That’s one less than you had this time yesterday. So, that’s one way to think of it.”
“No, I really don’t need to have another interview with Caesar Flickerman – and we both know that’s what he’d see a visit from me as,” Sherlock replied, shaking his head. “Besides, I was kind of hoping to just be in and out of here, anyway.”
“Dean banned them from the park today,” John explained. “We…Dean and I, I mean…we thought you’d come. We didn’t want them to scare you off. After all, you have more of a right to be here than anybody else.”
Harry and Sherlock find a place to hide out while fighting off the effects of the tracker jacker venom; Mycroft and John send Sherlock and Harry the supplies they need; Sherlock dreams.
“Okay, alright, I promise – but only in dire situations, situations where you could get hurt for saying too much –”
“Why are we all standing around?” Mrs. Hudson practically sang as she approached the four Hunger Games victors. “We’ve got a banquet to attend!”
Welcome to part four! Otherwise known as: the longest, most convoluted wrapping-of-loose-ends ever! I'm so sorry but I wanted to be thorough.
And then, suddenly, Sherlock felt Dean grabbing Sherlock by the wrists, abandoning the paperweight back on the desk.
“I...I love dancing. I’ve always loved it,” he revealed, cheeks still flushed. So that’s why he was nervous – it wasn’t the asking that made him so nervous as it was the prospect of telling his secret, despite the fact that it was his best friend he was telling it to.
It was then John heard it – the roar of a hovercraft. It was coming fast – making its rounds – and if Sherlock didn’t move, it would find them.
How could he ever look into the faces of Philip’s family and tell them that Philip died an honorable death when
Sherlock rolled his eyes, wanting to escape from the lectures Mrs. Hudson had been giving them all day. Unfortunately, the only person who could do that was Louise, and it was now that she decided to make that escape.
Sherlock and Harry turned to watch John as they left, and John waved awkwardly back at them, not knowing what else to do with himself, short of running and ripping them off of the chariots and taking them far,
Also, most of this chapter has not been beta'd - if you spot any weird wording or whatever, please give me a heads up and I'll fix it immediately. :)
And then he was moving – moving whichever way the mob was sending him – getting pulled and pushed and grabbed and falling over himself and everyone else –
No. He wouldn’t have. In fact – though Sherlock was sure he was just assuming this – maybe John would have kissed Sherlock back, if Sherlock had dared to make that move.
As he cut through the images with his sword, the smoke that remained cut at his face – he could feel the blood dripping down his cheeks – but he couldn’t even wipe it off – all he could do was keep running and killing these people who were already dead – trying to remind himself that they weren’t real –
And they still kept pecking him with beaks and claws sharp as knives, flooding him from all sides as he walked, and Sherlock grit his teeth so hard his jaw hurt in the effort to keep quiet.
“No, he didn’t... He never calls a meeting with the mentors unless...” He trailed off, and flipped the letter over and back again, as if looking for another message.
Harry looked back and forth between Sherlock and the body, but neither of them spoke until they heard the canon blast.
“I’m so sorry,” he whispered through his tears, and said it again, loud enough for the microphone to pick up accurately. “I am so sorry, for everything. Mycroft was kind and smart and understanding and he cared so much and was hands-down the best brother I could ever ask for and I’m sorry that I took him for granted. And, since this is the last time I’ll ever get a chance to say it: I love him. I will always –”
“What happened that night was a brutal reminder of everyone’s mortality – that just because you win the Hunger Games, it doesn’t mean you are invincible. And, despite how smart people know me to be – how smart I know
Sherlock spun around at the sound, wiping his tears as he looked at the person who had decided to join him. It was a young woman, about Mycroft’s age, wearing a man’s boots and a man’s coat over her nightgown, her long blonde hair in a messy bun that topped her head, holding a candle between herself and Sherlock. She was smiling – but not a happy smile, and not one of the pity-smiles Sherlock was used to getting – this smile was kind.
Or, at the very least, long enough to go into his room and shoot up before the memorial services later that day.
the best candidate, after him,” Dean admitted, giving a slight chuckle to conceal the tremor in his voice.
He hadn’t noticed, though, that John Watson had stood up as soon as Sherlock had gotten off the stage, and met him halfway back to his seat.
“John?” Sherlock questioned, gently calling John back to the present, his mouth still so close to John’s skin that he could feel his breath on the head of his –
John Watson sat in the penthouse, watching the aftermath of the scene. The scene itself was full of blurred-out images, but that was only because of the tears filling John’s eyes, and he too felt the need to vomit.
Harry had been right – not only right, but dead on. The Hunger Games finale in the Arena – leaving Harry alone just to fall into the hands of Charles Augustus Magnussen, finding out about John’s assault in the worst way possible, nearly getting strangled to death by Magnussen, seeing Moriarty in his eyes as he finally admitted that he wasn’t ready to die, delivering the final blow that killed Magnussen himself, nearly killing Harry to force the Capitol into taking them both back – it all had thrown his mind palace off balance, knocking shelves over and blocking off entire rooms, files upon files spilling onto the floor, all out of order or unreachable.
After convincing Mycroft that he was alright on his own, he walked with the Avox down the crowded sidewalk and entered the stables to realize he was completely correct in his assumption. Within seconds, Harry had her arms around him. When she stepped back, he noticed she was donned in a beautiful black high-low dress with her hair done up, only letting a few locks frame her face, and violet makeup outlining her features. It then struck John how adult-like she looked, but before he could say anything Sherlock’s lips was on his, and he was kissing his boyfriend back.
He had broken it to Harry when she was five – when he learned at the age of eight, he blurted it out when their mother tried explaining why their parents didn’t want them watching it. The next year, both of them were planted in front of the television, because they both finally understood, and there was no use in keeping them from watching it, anymore. Of course Archie had watched the Games that young, even if he didn’t remember it – he had to watch his sister play.
John sat up and pulled his shirt over his head before beginning to remove the last bit of clothing from Sherlock’s body, and it was at that moment the sound of rapid tapping filled the dark room, and Sherlock’s vision began to shake.
“Oh – okay, alright. See you tomorrow?” John asked, still so concerned, and it made Sherlock’s chest ache.
In chapter 13 (Help, or: the one where Mycroft sneaks to District Four to sleep with Dean once), Dean offers to call Sherlock so Mycroft knows that he's alright (since he can't because Mycroft's not supposed to be in District Four). We only get Dean's side of the conversation, but I wrote out the entire phone conversation:
do! This is what Caesar and Claudius and Seneca and Snow do! But this – this is the paparazzi – this is the
if he would be kind enough to refuse Sherlock, if he went to him for morphling at any point in the future. He was going to be as kind as he possibly could be, only verbally threatening if he absolutely
“But no one knows about...” Mycroft dropped his face. He dropped his face right on the goddamned floor. He was sick of it. It felt to the floor with a PLOP because it was made of dough.
After the initial thought that Mycroft was at the door, and after realizing that it was impossible, he knew exactly who was at the door. He opened the door and was not at all surprised to find Harry Watson in the doorway.
Sherlock really wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but it wasn’t this. It wasn’t any of that, actually – how the hell had he known about...about everything? About John – about the Morphling – and how dare he announce it in front of everyone?! Though Sherlock might’ve been asking for that, trying to approach him like this –
Though the day had been an eventful one, a lot of people – mentors, sponsors, and Capitol citizens alike – went home and went to bed, and soon John looked around to find that there was a sudden lack of crowds. Across the Circle, John could see a small building and three doors – one marked for women, one marked for men, and a third marked for the handicapped – and John realized how much he had gotten lost in the excitement of the day, and how much he needed to use the lavatories.
“The girls of District One,” she revealed. “As many as he could get his grubby hands on – Sherlock, he has
First, most simply: John would end up committing suicide very quickly. However, John has friends and Mycroft has friends, and they all know how devastated John would be, so the more likely option would be
Hannibal breathed in deeply again, and Sherlock felt the urge to cover himself – cover any scent he was giving off – but he couldn’t.
“Yes. You were there because I was missing from training – that’s the only reason why you were there –” Sherlock explained, his voice growing more and more frantic with every word.
“No – don’t take him away –” she begged, trying to crawl past him to grab Sherlock, but the Peacekeeper kicked her away, pulling out a gun. Whether it was another tranquilizer gun or an actual weapon, she didn’t know – she had no way of knowing, and the tracker jacker venom in her head wasn’t helping her reasoning skills, at all – and she didn’t want to test it.
“I’m sure a lot of people here have asked for me and John,” Sherlock mused. “A lot of people here have a lot of reasons to hate us, Caesar included.”
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to search Harry’s eyes – trying to find anything as to what her question might be.
Sherlock opened his mouth, but nothing came out. John had said the same thing, right after the two of them had tried and failed to have sex:
Meanwhile, Harry seemed strong on the outside, but John knew his sister. She never cried in front of him or their parents, passed out false smiles and false confidence like it was her job, and stood up straight and asked all the right questions to him and Mycroft. There was one night, though, when John had had a particularly bad nightmare and needed to go to the bathroom so his panicking wouldn’t wake Sherlock, he heard Harry sobbing behind her bedroom door. He wasn’t sure what brought him to open the door, but when he did he found his sister – his baby sister – on her bedroom floor, with a bottle of whiskey in hand, tears streaming down her face. His stomach dropped to the floor, but he couldn’t help remembering the last time he was in this position: when Sherlock had overdosed.
