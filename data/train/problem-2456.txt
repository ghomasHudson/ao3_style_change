Castiel’s arm dropped from where he’d been reaching for the flowers and he waded back towards them – wings arced high to keep his flight feathers out of the water – with a few clutched in his fist, which he handed off to Sam.  The stems and leaves were green and had little white flowers at the top.
“I imagine my name and the names of several in my garrison are likeing in at least one book, if not more.  And they still need to eat.  They must venture into the nearby town of Ivarstead occasionally to buy food, it's only natural to overhear gossip and stories. However, my suspicion is that their desperation to find this person may have pushed them to seek the assistance and information of others, so they could have found my name elsewhere.”
“…you might be able to harness my grace when it surges,” Castiel told them all, looking more confident with his idea by the second.  “The flare will be massive and powerful; it might be enough to at least weaken her.”
One corner of Cas’ mouth twisted up immediately and he dropped his eyes to his cup. Behind him, the feathers all along the leading edges of his wings fluffed and Dean suddenly felt as if his lungs were full of helium.
the path the angel’s thoughts were taking.  Just last month he’d told Castiel that he couldn’t just tell people the truth when they asked what he was doing in town.  Castiel knew he couldn’t say, “Yes, a vampire punched me in the face.”  So, in his black and white angelic brain, if he couldn’t say
His heart was aching and he wasn’t sure why, but Sam was still snoring and Cas was still breathing deep and even and his head was heavy on Dean’s chest.
Dean was about to make a, likely unhelpful, comment but froze with his mouth open, the sound of something off kilter to the waves making him pause.  But he knew that sound, feathers cutting through air, strong muscles pushing against it.  It was either Cas or Hannah, it was impossible to tell which, but as the sound of the slow wing beats came closer, neither brother could see who it was through the fog.
When he saw the small leather satchel hanging off his brother's hip, Dean had to bite his tongue, swallowing a joke about man-purses.  He had a similar bag, which had taken all of his brain power to figure out how to get on, with one strap that went over the shoulder and the other around the waist so that the bag was held against his body securly instead of flapping around like a normal man-purse would.
the angel didn't trust?  Was he worried they might find it too strange?  Or worse, did he think th brothers would hurt him some how?
When he'd escaped to the safety of the tiny bathroom, Dean leaned against the door and took a few deep breaths.  Maybe if he ignored it, he could just pretend he didn't have a hard on.  He looked down at his traitorous dick.
Dean blinked, “Oh,” he looked back towards the door where the only two windows in the bunker were.  The sky outside – the sliver of it that he could see – was pink with the glow of the setting sun.  “Shit.”
One corner of Cas full lips lifted, his eyes closed.  “Prayers, Dean.  We are in a hospital…they are deafening.”
“There's a shit-ton of butterflies around here,” Dean observed keenly, spotting a cluster of the yellow and orange insects fluttering around over the road and in the trees up ahead.
“It's fine,” Castiel assured, looking down at the ground.  “I just thought...well you always got upset with me when I...”  he trailed off, wings curling forward over his arms a little and even more feathers rising.
Licking his lips, Dean tried to convince his brain and his tongue to work together.  “Uh…I can see Cas’ eyes…er color.  The color of his eyes.”
Castiel didn’t need to be told twice.  He took a step forward and grabbed his blade – the tip was still red with his blood – hugging it to his chest.  He could breathe again, though he wondered for how long.  After a moment of it’s comforting weight against his bare skin, Castiel let it dissolve back in to his vessel’s right forearm, where it would wait until he summoned it again.
He stared down at his hand, stared at his fingers curled around the pommel; distantly confused; not understanding.
for beta reading. This chapter almost killed me and they are literally the only reason it could even be posted i s2g
Mike was growing progressively angrier, a muscle jumping in his jaw as he glared at Sam and Sam just continued to steamroller over him ruthlessly.
large bonfire hit his ears.  Off to his right and no more than twenty feet away, there was a raging fire and its flames were flickering up around the same height as the heads of the two giants that were tending it.
That was a lofty order, when so much of the floor was slick with his blood.  Still, he froze obediently, unsure of why he was doing so.  Wasn’t he supposed to be trying to escape?
“I loath airports,” Liam was saying, “The smell, the noise, the constant screeching over the speakers.  Dreadful.  But it’s better than travelling by boat, I suppose.  I remember when that was the only option.  The smell…I really can’t even describe it, so I know I shouldn’t complain.”
It was several long seconds later when the angel finally pulled his hand away and Sam was blinking rapidly, looking much more aware of his surroundings than he had a moment ago.
Sam came charging into the room with a shotgun in his hand and a wild look in his eye - given the absolute panic in Dean's voice, he likely thought his brother was on the verge of being murdered - and Castiel flared his wings defensively at the sight of the weapon.  The fact that it would do very little damage to an angel didn’t seem to matter as Castiel’s heart crammed itself into his throat.
He lied.  Why had he bothered to lie?  Four or five days ago sounded much better than six or seven…until you thought about it and realized it really wasn’t any better at all.
clear that he was meant to behave as humanly as possible.  That his angelic traits, instincts, and thoughts – everything that made him
“Dean,” Sam warned, looking alarmed. This was too heavy, his expression said, it was pushing too hard too fast and too much on the still fragile angel.
The cafeteria was packed, given that it was whatever time of day and whatever day of the week it was – Dean had no idea – and he had to nab a tiny table with two chairs the second he saw two nurses vacate it, practically hissing like an angry cat when an exhausted looking doctor stumbled too close.
Dean wiped the tip of the blade clean on his jeans and carefully pressed the pommel in to Cas’ palm, letting the angel know that it was back in his hand, that he was safe, and watching his long fingers curl around it possessively.
Hannah nodded.  “Flying just because it is enjoyable was not something Castiel ever did before I...”  she closed her eyes, pulled her knees to her chest and wrapped her arms around them, her wings shifting.  “Can you imagine that?  A creature of flight not ever flying unless it necessitated a purpose.  A sad truth for hundreds of young ones.”
“We're looking west,” Castiel told them quietly, following the brother's line of sight as they gaped at the old, moss-covered stone fort, behind which there was a gap in the trees, indicating that the road likely continued on in that direction.  He gestured over his shoulder to the massive ridge they had left behind. “If we flew straight that way, we would hit Whiterun again.”
When Guns N' Roses' Patience started playing on the radio, Dean pursed his lips and started whistling along with the intro, unable to curb the impulse.  It was just so soothing and catchy, especially with the backdrop of rain pattering against the roof of the Impala.
The thing snorted and snarled across the room, it’s twenty or so beady little eyes all trained on Castiel.  He brought his other hand to the pommel of his sword and split the grace running through it, pulling apart with two shorter, one and a half foot long blades.
Hannah had sort of become a part of their little family over the last few months.  Several times, late at night when Dean and Sam had gone to bed, Dean had gotten up to use the bathroom or stumble to the fridge for a 2AM snack and had, on more than one occasion, overheard Cas and Hannah talking about heaven.  Among other things.
, Sam, but what are our other options here?!  What if this spell drives him insane?!  What if it kills him?!”
Hesitating only briefly with the instinct to be as difficult as possible, Dean sat.  Despite the feeling in his gut telling him this was going to be difficult either way, the idea was that the more he cooperated the faster he would be able to leave and go save Cas.  Because that’s what it would be.  He would be saving the angel from whatever they were doing to him at the hospital.  Tying him down, doping him up.
Did a picture of he two of them wearing cowboy hats pop up with the caller ID when the King of Hell called him?  Also yes.
They mowed through a quick breakfast of bread, cheese, and apples and then spent a few moments arguing over the best way to get to Kynesgrove before finally agreeing on Sam's idea to cross the river and cut across a wide open blank space on the map, at the center of which was drawn a ram skull.  It left Dean feeling vaguely unsettled, to see such a wide-open space with no markers filled in.  Why had no one gone in there to fill in the map?
“So, if he left the flowers,” Jessy’s frown deepened, “Why wouldn’t he just come in and let you know?”
They cut a path up the side of the hill, edging around a wide fissure in the ground that was billowing steam into the air like a geyser.
a weapon does not mean you are not in danger.  There are races and species there that will be new to both of you but we will go over that once we arrive.” He paused, as if leaving room for questions.  “Which brings us to the next issue.  Transporting you from one place on earth to another is very different from transporting you from one planet to another.”
blood, he firmly told himself – boiled to the surface and popped, spattering the edges of the stainless steel pot.
"Of fucking course." Dean muttered, his chest tight. Why couldn't anything ever go right for them? He looked to his brother, who had been struggling with the ropes binding Cas' other wrist but now stood frozen, brown eyes wide and sad as he looked from his friend to his brother and back again.
There never seemed to be a right time for them and Dean felt another opportunity slipping through his fingers as he pulled away.  He knew Cas was in a vulnerable state of mind and, despite his urge to wrap Cas up in his arms and kiss away all his problems, Dean knew that now – as it always seemed to be – was not the time.
Dean looked stricken and a little bit angry; his freckles were suddenly stark against the paleness in his face.  “Don’t say that shit, of course it matters what you want.  Look, I don’t know how you’re blocking out all this shit, but I can tell that that’s what you’re doing ok?  You’ve gone all robo-angel on me. Just…
, to show you I am a man of my word, I’ll give you a bit of advice.  On the house.”  He paused, seemingly for dramatic effect, “You may want to consider digging out your holy fire glasses.”
“If you can find a vegetable in there that isn't rotten, buy it,”  Sam ordered sleepily from where he was curled against the door.  “I don't even care what it is, if I have to eat one more hamburger I swear to -”
He watched the creature's face, watched it smooth over, watched it's body go tight with energy. It twitched like it might lunge for him and he flinched in response, but then the energy was bleeding out again. It looked like a conscious decision and it seeped out through the cracks and fissures in it's skin like smoke.
“I’ve never worked with an angel with any white left in their wings before.  I don’t know much about determining their age, we’ll have to ask them when they wake up.  My concern is that, even if Castiel hasn’t fully matured, they should at least be large enough that that dosage would have been fine.”
For a moment, Crowley stared at him, as if weighing the pros and cons of actually telling them, before grinning like the Cheshire Cat.  “If I told you, you wouldn’t give them to me.”
thing they could use their grace for.  As for it sending poor little Cas into a frenzy, well...there really is no comparison that will make you understand just what grace is as a human, the best I can do is this: Grace is an angel’s lifeforce.  Imagine, if you can, a scenario where someone has wrapped up your lungs with burning hot, rusty, barbed-wire – in this case, our binding spell – and tied it so tight you can’t breathe.  Now, an angel not being able to access their grace doesn’t
A few people started clapping along with the song; some began to sway from side to side in their seats and Sam visibly flinched when someone swayed a little too heavily in the direction of the fire pit.
Rolling on to his side, he saw Sam in the dirt far out of reach, blood pouring from a shockingly wide gash on his temple.
“Easy, buddy,” Dean murmured, but Cas was already relaxing again, his eyes landing on Dean and then slipping down to the mug in his hands like he didn't remember how it got there. Maybe he didn't.
“Ok, sit down, Cas, I'm going to make some coffee and the three of us are gonna figure this out, ok?”
But Cas' breathing was already shallow and fast and Dean barely heard when Sam muttered about going to get another syringe.
Dean's voice, so gentle and cautious, sent a filament of agitated power whipping around inside Castiel's chest like a broken wire coil, and he visibly twitched.
Just as Dean looked over his shoulder and closed his hand around the pommel of his sword, hot blood splattered across his face and he sputtered.
Was he still trying to get home or had he not made it beyond the phone call he’d made to Dean.  From a payphone on the side of the road, which he’d only been able to use because some old man driving by had taken pity on him.
With a breath punching from his chest, Castiel stumbled back from the stove a few paces, ruthlessly shoving the memory back down where it belonged.  Out of the way.
Just as well, he’d already indulged himself far more than he should have.  He didn’t deserve comfort or warmth or his wings, or anything else.  He owed debts and things that he had broken needed fixing.
Somehow, they had to get Cas to believe he didn’t deserve eternal suffering, that being happy was ok, and that God was actually kind of a monster that should not be thanked for much of anything.
Dean's head snapped up so fast he may have pulled something.  “Apple pie?” he asked, his voice sounding strangled.  He ignored the burning sensation of Cas and Sam’s stare.
Her words cut deeper than he could have predicted.  He wasn’t sure why.  Perhaps it was because this was just another sign of Castiel’s impermanence in Dean and Sam’s lives.  Certainly, if their mother did not approve of her sons having an angel around then he would soon be asked to leave.
Dean fell asleep not long after, trying to predict all the ways this could go horribly, horribly wrong.
In the silence that followed, Cas and Dean's laboured breathing was all they could hear.  They looked to one another, giving short nods that neither was in immediate need of a hospital and Dean sat down in the middle of the floor, his legs feeling like jelly as the adrenaline drained from his blood.
Dean crashed to his knees and grabbed his brother’s shoulder.  “Take it easy, Sammy, take it easy.”  He tried to get a look at the cut, his stomach cramping with worry with how slurred his brother’s words were.
Cas quickly, almost compulsively, stretched his wings again, and Dean waited until they were out of earshot of the nearest guards before harshly whispering, “Dragons?
But the angel merely shrugged, looking unconcerned.  “I doubt that it has but we will have to wait and see.  The past remains much more present to the people here than it does on earth.”
Castiel allowed himself a small twitch of his lips, feeling cruel.  “Well then, you finally understand why I rarely bother speaking.”
It didn’t sound real and Castiel struggled to understand.  Three times he opened and closed his mouth without saying anything, hearing gravel crunch under his boots, hearing the woosh of cars speeding by, feeling the moisture of another storm building in the air – and understanding none of it.
“Wow.  Sounds exciting,”  Dean resettled in his chair, picking at the wood on the armrest with his fingernail.  “But maybe we should call Cas and see if he's got anything for us to do.”
He supposed it didn’t really matter; he might be new to being human but even he knew they were supposed to eat more frequently than
Sam came to stand beside him, drawing himself up tall and threatening but leaving his axes alone for the time being.
For a moment, they stared at each other through the mist, the fine water droplets seeming to swirl around the angel like they had a mind of their own, the glow of his eyes cutting through the blurr, and Dean suddenly found himself recalling the Disney scene where Pochahontas and John Smith met for the first time.
He understood what Cas meant when he said he was scared of what he felt for Dean – of the intensity of it – because it was only now that he was truly realizing, as he looked down into Cas' big, blue, doe eyes, just how deeply in love he was.  In their life, feelings that deep were dangerous.  The fall of one of them meant the ruin of the other.  And one of them would fall eventually.
“Hey,” Dean took a step closer to the edge of the bed Cas had sat down on and lifted the angel's chin with a finger until he  looked up.  “What did I say about hiding, huh?”
their compassion.  From what I understand, it is a hard opinion to crawl out from under, as I’m sure you know.”
showing them his true form – not that he could at the moment – Castiel stopped blinking.  Stopped breathing.  Turned himself into the marble statue he had taken so many long years learning to soften.  For
Dean slammed his door closed, smirking when he saw Cas through the window trying hard not to grin, and headed for the door to the little market with a spring in his step.  He had the vague wisp of an idea forming in his head and if he could make it all come together then, hopefully, he could at least claim a bit of Castiel's happiness for himself.
Liam had his hands in his pockets and gave Sam a smile and a nod in greeting, but as soon as Cas stepped over the threshold, he clasped his hands in front of him, lacing his fingers together in a way that made it clear he wasn’t holding anything.
The morning air was crisp but not cold, and as the sun started its crawl across the sky, it warmed up a bit, but not as much as Dean had been hoping.  His tunic was made of wool but it was still pretty thin.  He wondered if Nirn had similar seasons to earth.  Was going to get colder than it was now?  Was it goin to start snowing soon?  They were going to have to find some warmer clothes if it was.
Castiel was screaming again and Dean felt tears of rage and frustration prickle at his eyes as he clawed at the hands crushing his windpipe with a growing sense a desperation. A window off to his right shattered into a thousand tiny pieces and the light over the spot where Cas was bound popped, showering them all with tiny shards of glass, and just when the edges of Dean's vision started to go dark, the demon went sailing through the air and the hunter sucked in an urgent lungful of oxygen. It burned like he'd swallowed acid but he forced himself to his feet, the room spinning around him, and cast around for something really fucking sharp to end this.
noises on the floor - into the library without a word, dropping into the chair next to Dean's and staring straight ahead with the same look everyone had after a nap - glazed over like he was thinking about how much he wished he was still asleep.
Castiel turned to look at all four corners of the room before turning back to Dean, looking distracted.  “Yes. Showers. Thank you.”
It was only then, as he was slamming the car door closed and trying to jam the key in the ignition with a trembling hand, that the exhaustion in Castiel’s voice finally registered and he paused.
Cas grinned at her under the water and did it again, tilting his head back in a way that made Dean think if he was closer he might have just heard Cas actually laugh for the first time.
“Suppose it would be,” Sam muttered.  “Jesus, I had no idea.  He's so...” Sam's hands flailed, looking for the right word.
Sam grinned, glancing down at Castiel briefly before raising his eyes back to Dean with a dangerous grin.
Dean flashed her his most charming smile, his stomach flipping when her own widened in response.  He hoped he was right about this.  Quickly, he scrambled for the next thing to say but she beat him to it.
But then the energy was dissipating, and then it was gone altogether.  In it’s place there was a frigid silence, Castiel’s sudden controlled exhale like an arctic breeze over Dean’s nerves.
“The inhabitants of Nirn are much less technologically advanced than those of Earth, despite the fact that they have existed as a species for several hundred million years longer than the humans on Earth.”
“Oh yes,” Liam assured them with a watery smile that wasn’t as reassuring as he probably hoped it was.  “Castiel just projected a very traumatic experience from their point of view into my mind.  It was only a shadow of what they felt themselves, but it was upsetting non the less.” He heaved a great gust of air from his lungs.  “Well, I think that is enough work for now.  I don’t know about you lot, but I desperately need a cup of tea.”
Dean turned back around and looked up in the mirror.  Castiel's grin was wide enough to show his straight white teeth and Dean cursed when he fumbled the keys, dropping them on the floor before he could get them in the ignition.
Castiel suspected that that kind of comfort – or any kind of comfort, really – was not something ‘guys’ did.
“Everything about who you are,” Dean’s smile softened, and then fell away and he looked down, lifted his other hand to settle on Castiel’s arm where it rested on his knees.  “Is ridiculously beautiful.  And I can’t believe this is the first time I’ve told you.”
The familiar faces did nothing to quell his anger and, when he turned his head, the room spun like an illusion losing power.
Cas spoke with more confidence than he had since before he'd taken Lucifer's spot in the cage, but it still lacked the edge and authority and warmth he used to have. It was more clinical, like he was reporting the progress of his recovery to a superior and Dean didn't care to examine just why that made his stomach squirm unpleasantly. It was like everything that had made him Cas – not Castiel – but Cas, was still missing. Dean had a split second of panic when he worried if they would ever get it back.
“Well, why don't you and Castiel go find a stone and Sam and I will clean these.”  She jiggled the box of clams with a smirk, her eyes on Cas.
The drunk seemed pleased enough with that answer but didn't have time to respond before Sam was back and pushing a frothing tankard into his shaking hands.
, Dean felt as if the angel was weighing the pros and cons of letting them in one whatever task he'd been given.  After only a few seconds of silence, Cas relaxed minutely.
It was obvious that Cas' touch was hesitant, as if he wasn't sure he was allowed to do what he was doing, and Dean felt his heart pound against his chest, suddenly overwhelmed with affection for the man sitting beside him.  Cas had caught on quickly to a lot of things - using Google, using his phone, even cooking basic meals - but when it came to things like touching or asking for help or speaking up when something was bothering him...Cas still struggled.
After an entire day of flying, they would collapse into the nest of blankets and pillows that was now a permanent fixture in the sitting room and literally pass out, wings draped over each other like blankets, and sleep for hours.
Sam shook his head.  “Where do you think I learned it from?  Even the most dedicated enthusiasts and PhDs can only learn based on the clues that survived into this century, which aren’t a lot.  I
did my research on that binding translation, Dean.  I studied the work and methods of the best of the best and I still got it wrong.  The only way we’re going to create an accurate and functional release spell is with someone who spoke old Norse fluently
Cas' hand twitched in his, hesitantly squeezing back, and Dean thought his heart might shatter in his chest. He didn't allow himself to squeeze back too tightly, and instead blinked a few times until his vision cleared and he could see Cas clearly again.
Dean mumbled for him to hang on, told whoever was in the passenger seat to take the wheel for a second and then, presumably, googled the town on his phone.  Castiel listened, honing in on the sounds of two people mumbling and moving around and belatedly realized that Dean had said ‘
“I brought you some coffee,” Dean continued, trying to impress a casual tone. He wanted Cas to know it was no big deal, having his wings out – even though it totally freaking was – because there was no way being himself could feel worse than hiding parts of himself away. This
"Come, Dean!"  Thorygg called boisterously when he spotted the older Winchester.  "You must be starving...we have mead and a little meat."
Sam opened his mouth like he wanted to argue, but then conceded with a nod that Dean was right.  They were trying and in time he thinks they would be able to learn how to be what Cas needs them to be and communicate how Cas needs them to communicate.  But Dean was sure that Sam was also feeling like Cas just didn’t have the time it was going to take for them to learn.
Having freed himself from the mass of bushes - with no help from the brothers - Cas seemed to be taking a moment to steady himself and his massive wings shifted when he wobbled a bit, twitching out to hover like counter weights against his center of gravity and keep him upright.
Some of the tension in him eased, at least he'd gotten Cas talking. “You sure that's all you want to do? It kinda feels like your withdrawing again.” He rolled his lip between his teeth, watching Cas watch him. “Is there something...I mean, are you ok?”
“Look, lady – Angie,” Dean corrected, trying to keep his voice steady.  “Thanks for all your help and everything but –”
A new smile spread slowly across her face, evidently distracted by the angel’s signature intense gaze.  "What would you like to hear?"
"I'm going to fly ahead,” Cas suddenly informed them, still looking irritated by the lack of signage on the road.
The de-powered angel hadn't forgotten a lick of the information he'd gathered over the millions of years he'd existed - which came in handy a lot - and he still had the ability to remember everything he saw - eidetic memory, Sam had called it.  Not to mention the guy was wicked lethal with a knife in his hand.  Actually, he was pretty damn dangerous
At three o’clock, Dean shook his brother awake none to gently and kicked him out of the bed, crashing into it himself and wrinkling his nose at the dusty, unwashed smell of it.  Although, there was a chance that smell might be coming from him, since he hadn't bathed since they arrived.
Sam, Dean was glad to note, had also been staring around at the city and its people, a very deep frown pulling his eyebrows together.  Dean nudged his brother’s arm and the two of them turned to follow the angel to the other side of the market.  On their right they passed two shops; one with a weight scale on the wooden sign hanging over the door and another with a mortar and pestle.
"It gets a little tricky up here," Dean warned as he approached the spot where the ground dropped away and the trail narrowed even more.
And it seemed he had accomplished his goal, for as soon as the conjured threat turned to dust and disappeared, Castiel’s grace recoiled like an elastic band, shrinking down inside him and leaving him exhausted and too drained to even think properly.
When he finally managed to look up, his tears had dried in sticky, embarrassing tracks on his cheeks, but Dean couldn't be bothered by them now because this was about
Obviously, Cas was hearing or seeing something that was spooking him and Dean tried to follow his line of sight, staring up the road ahead, but it curved to the right and around the eroded wall of stones only a few hundred yards away.
He felt a bit like a concrete pillar in an earthquake.  He was strong, but with the earth constantly heaving violently under his feet, eventually he would crumble.
When Cas stepped out onto the steps, he pulled a breath through his nose and closed his eyes.  Reaching his hands over his head and fully spreading his wings out to either side, he took up a good portion of the front of the inn.
When he ducked through the flap, it was surprisingly warm inside.  Another  iron fire bowl was sitting on the ground in the center of the tent and the three bed rolls had been placed around it, far enough away that a sleeper wasn’t going to accidentally roll in to it.  There was no smoke, only heat, and it seeped down into Dean's muscles and bones, easing some of the ache there.
Castiel was already shaking his head, pulling at the hands pinning him, panic cutting him from belly to throat.  “No!  I can’t, I can’t use my grace –“
It was a good start, but Dean wasn’t fooled in to thinking it would help with all the other stuff Cas had confessed.  He didn’t know what
"Dean!" his little brother snapped as he tossed the torture device to the floor. "Come on, get his hands free!"
His heart tried to squeeze itself dry at the thought, another flare of rage exploding quietly behind his ribs.
“Well, when angels are first created, every feather is pure white.  A blank canvas, so to speak.  As they grow and their grace develops, each molt replaces some of the feathers with each angel’s individual colors.  Like a fingerprint.  When their grace is fully developed, their wings will no longer have any white feathers left and they will stop growing.”
He turned his glowing eyes on her, his confusion showing through the shine of them.  But then his expression slacked with understanding and the set of his mouth was the only thing that told Dean he'd probably just rolled his eyes.
Dean offered him a polite smile, taking in the overalls and red cheeks and beer gut.  The guy looked like freaking Santa Clause.
Cas sounded grumpy.  Grumpier than normal anyway, and his voice was rough.  Not the kind of rough that meant he’d just woken up himself but the kind of rough that suggested he’d never fallen asleep in the first place.
a little bitch, then.  Here," he tossed a bottle of extra strength Tylenol over to him, which Cas caught deftly in the hand of his uninjured shoulder.
His fingers twitched at his sides and the brothers were nothing but a smear of color in front of him.
"It's been a long time since I heard about angels in Tamriel.  Legend has it that last time you were here it was because the world was in crisis."  He crossed his massive arms over his chest, fixing Castiel with a hard stare.  "Tell me, angel...are you here now for the same reason?"
Terror squeezed itself into his throat and he shrunk back against a wall he suddenly realized was behind him, fingers curling against the floor. His eyes snapped this way and that, trying to see into the dark surrounding the meagre light source. But he saw nothing. No movement at all, which meant there could be absolutely nothing or there could be hundreds of
He chose instead to focus on the sharp ache in his chest, resisting the urge to peek under his armor to see just how bad the bruising was.
He straightened, his tone turning brusque and business-like as he visibly collected himself and pushed on.
“We still have all those blankets in the trunk?”  Sam asked, eyeing the wooden benches while he set his bag on the floor by the doorway.
planet, much less on a new one.  He tried glancing around at their surroundings, trying to see all the alien monsters that might be hiding just beyond the reach of the firelight.
Stealing angels must have been no different then stealing food, horses, weapons, or anything else the Vikings could use.  They had seen something shiny and they had taken it for themselves.  Then taken it a step further, because apparently it wasn’t enough to steal a living creature; they had to force it to submit to them and kill for them as well.
...” the edges of his vision swam and it was suddenly impossible to keep his eyes open. So he let them fall closed. “...
The sitting room was sparse, with nothing besides a flat screen tv on the wall over the fireplace and a single, forest green, three-seat sofa and battered coffee table in the center of the room.  Sam and Cas were on opposite ends of the sofa.  Sam had an air of forced relaxation, slouching in his spot with his head resting in his hand as he watched whatever TV show they were watching.  But his right knee was bouncing incessantly and he was chewing the inside of his lip.
in your report, you still have very little to support your decision.  I’m assuming you're grasping at probable cause and while we both know that’s enough to justify making a warrantless arrest, we also both know its not enough to justify keeping him here.”
The relief was short lived when it became obvious Castiel wasn't all there. He'd had to watch while Cas struggled to speak in the right language, running through a few different ones Dean hadn't recognized and, despite the language barrier, everything had been going alright – until Cas had suddenly blinked and looked up at him. Dean had to back off then, fell back onto his ass and sat down a few feet away to show he had no intention of moving anywhere too quickly. It had the desired effect, and Cas had immediately calmed and finally found the word he was looking for.
Sam grunted and it may have just been a grunt, but Dean could still tell that Sam hadn't actually heard him and was likely auto-responding in the hopes that he would be left alone.  Rolling his head against the back of his chair, Dean stared at his brother.
Her back was to them and she flicked her left wing out a few inches, but it settled again almost immediately.  Dean would have thought nothing of it if he hadn't heard Cas huff an exasperated sigh.
Looking father up the road, he saw a man in a shabby tunic and pants huddled close to one of the fire bowls, his dirty hands held over the flames.
Though the brothers gave a good-natured wave to the two people neck deep in the large pool of water to their right, intending to press on to Kynesgrove like they had all discussed just that morning, Cas’ plans appeared to have changed.
“I…I was banished.  By a woman.  She was in the bunker waiting for us when we got back.”  So late it was almost embarrassing, Castiel realized he needed to find out where the hell he was if he had any hope of getting back to help right the latest mistake he’d made and he straightened, shaking off the shock of hearing Dean’s voice and looking around for any clues that might tell him where he was.
Dean was sure that if Cas had been able to stop and cocoon himself in his wings like he did when he was sleeping, the angel would have stayed perfectly warm and dry.
Dean was suddenly in his line of sight and very close to his face.  Castiel blinked his way back to the present conversation, resisting the urge to slap the man like a fly buzzing around his head.
had been seeping in around that memory; things that seemed to simultaneously have nothing and everything to do with why he'd let Lucifer use him. They were hazy, not events but feelings – cold and dark and heavy. He didn't like them; tried to plug up the holes in his mind they might be coming through but they simply kept coming, filling his head like poisonous gas. So he did the next best thing and tried to ignore them all; focused on the other memories and less unpleasant feelings coming back to him.
“Thank you.”  He pulled it on over the sweater he was currently wearing, zipping it up, shoving his hands in the pockets and shuffling down so the bottom half of his face was tucked under the neck.
“Alright, I’m gonna go tell Cas we’re having people over for a few days, then,” Sam declared, still smiling a little.
He was tired enough that his full-body ache didn’t even keep him from falling asleep almost instantly.
Sam nodded immediatly, evidently agreeing.  “Ok then, I’m gonna go ask for this Mike guy.  Be right back.”
– was at least speaking kindly to Castiel and his body language had shifted into something much less threatening than what he’d presented Dean with.  The short one, however, kept most of his attention on Dean, hands on his hip and close to his gun.
Her words didn’t seem to hold any maliciousness, she was merely stating a fact, but the steely look in her eye made Castiel draw his wings back in, folding them close to his body.  There was a jarring familiarity in the look in her eye; in the way she was pointing that gun at him.
Sam flopped down on the bed against the left wall, coughing and laughing when a cloud of dust rose up around him.
“Look at them, Castiel.  Look at their souls,” the voice implored with urgency, as if the speaker thought they may be running out of time.
Dean scrambled on his belly, trying to call out to Sam, to warn him about the hulking green mass moving towards him.  However, with the wind still thoroughly knocked out of him, no sound escaped his throat.
They talked for longer than they probably should have, knowing how early Cas was going to make them get up.  Eventually, though, once they had exhausted the topic of how it felt to be on an alien planet, the brothers stumbled to bed with mead-warmed bellies and fell asleep instantly.
Dean actually had to swallow down peppermint flavoured bile as it surged up his throat, stomach heaving as he spun to tell Sam to keep the door shut.  But Crowley was already walking down the stairs in front of his brother and Dean wiped a clammy hand down his face.
Giving up on packing anything for now, Dean left his room in search of Sam, wondering if he was ready to give Cas a call and head out.  It wasn't even properly evening yet, after all, and if his brother was anywhere near as jacked up with nervous, excited energy as he was, Dean was sure neither of them would be able to sleep on it anyway.
tomato sauce when he looked into the pot.  But the colour was still too dark for him to really believe it.  He picked up the spoon and hesitantly began to stir – gently like Dean had shown him – and his muscles slowly tensed.  With every dip of the spoon, he almost expected to see a body part cradled in the plastic the next time he lifted it out.  A finger or a tongue or an ear.  Somehow, when nothing but slimy chunks of hamburger turned up, he became more and more anxious.
Mike looked to Castiel again and gently said, “Ok, I think it might be best if you both come down to the station with us.”
“I have an idea,” he answered.  He half turned on his seat, hooking his elbow over the back to look at Cas and Hannah.  “You guys wanna fly, right?”
His brother huffed a sigh into the phone.  "OK, so I was looking into this thing in Seattle a little more," he suddenly paused for a coughing fit.  It lasted a few seconds and Dean winced, Sam's throat was likely raw as hell.
Castiel glance over at Sam still sitting beside him, noted the concerned press his lips and the wide, brown eyes watching him, and reminded himself that they were trying to
Cas blinked – just once – and Liam raised a hand, palm out and facing Cas. “Gently, Castiel.  Do you feel that breeze?”
He would have tried anything else first.  He would have tackled Cas to the floor, tried to snap him out of it with a slap to the face…
.  Bound, helpless, weakened, and fighting against the desire to take the easy way out of all of it.
As Sam took a step back and then another, Castiel stared at his sword, the only thing that could end him – end
He gave his brother a desperate look, not really caring that it probably made him look childish, because whatever was happening with his face seemed to be giving Sam pause for thought.
Tentatively, Dean shuffled over to Cas' on his knees, the cold earth seeping through his thin trousers, and reached a hand out to gingerly touch Cas’ wing.
“If they are, in fact, necromancers, you can rest assured evil and dark magic have tainted their blood.  They are pests that will spread pestilence and death and they need to be exterminated,” Castiel said with evident distaste.
.  Then they started bringing other angels to me; ones that were injured either in mind or body, or both.   With Adriel’s knowledge of how to heal physical wounds and my knowledge of how to heal mental wounds we began trying to…repair some of the damage.”
"An angel, right?  Don't see them around Skyrim much any more, though my grandfather said they used to be here a lot.  Grand warriors, he called them, always telling stories about how lethal and cunning they were in battle.  He always said he was glad they were on our side and not the other way around."  He chuckled, watching Cas with a lazy, unconcerned gaze.  "He's terrifying, isn't he?"
Apparently, those were the magic words, because Thorygg relaxed, coming round to lean against the table with an easy smile.
?” he repeated when he realized he hadn't gotten an answer, or at least not one he understood. He felt his eyes stinging and blinked. “
“It sounded like...an impact tremor,” Cas looked confused about what his own ears were trying to tell him and cocked his head to the side as if to hear better.  With his wings now visible, the action had a distinctly bird-like quality that Dean had never really noticed before.  “Can you feel it in the ground?”
.  It meant no mission.  It meant he had nothing to focus on.  It meant…he wasn’t sure what the entirety of
They told Crowley to go home.  Told him they’d call him if they decided to take his offer.  He looked surprised, as if he hadn’t considered the Winchesters might
“Which means one of two things.  Either he’s delusional because of drugs or a mental disorder or he’s so scared of what
Cas looked about to say something else but stopped with his mouth hanging open, his gaze settling straight ahead.
Dean sighed, admitting defeat.  He looked down at the table top, worn smooth by years of use, and then over to where a few candles sat at the edge that was in the corner, offering some dim light.  The chairs were only simple wood with woven seats and backs but he and Sam both sunk down into them like they were made of leather and memory foam.
Back in the impala, the memory still made something unpleasant curl in Dean's guts and he glanced in the rear-view mirror again.
So Dean took a deep breath and did just that.  Told Sam how Cas had injured his shoulder in the warehouse.  Told him how Cas and him had gotten in an argument and why.  Told him about the cops and the accusations and how Cas had tired lying and then telling the truth and how neither had worked.  Told him everything Mike had said after they put him in this room.
He wondered if his Father had known this was how things would turn out.  He wondered at the irony of it.  Castiel had left Hell with one Righteous Man and several less brothers and sisters and now Dean had
Suddenly he was simply grateful they were letting him stay at all.  He wondered how long he had before they would grow tired of his presence once more.  Perhaps it would be best if he left before they felt the need to ask him to.  It wouldn’t be so bad this time, he reasoned even as his heart squeezed itself dry.  He wasn’t human, he had his grace – and his mind – back.  He only needed enough time to heal a bit more.  Just a few days, maybe a week, to smooth down the raw and jagged edges from where Lucifer had been ripped from him and from where Rowena’s curse had dug its claws in deep.
Dean supposed he probably wouldn’t have gotten much in the way of fluids if he was fighting the doctors tooth and nail.  He was probably dehydrated, which wouldn’t be helping his body rid itself of the sedative any faster.
Dean's hands flew up, "It's just us, Cas," he said calmly, watching closely as Castiel's gaze locked on him, his wings still tense as he crouched halfway to standing.
Cas' eyes were closed, his mouth open, cheeks flushed, but his brow was crumpling into something more worried than Dean would like to see and Cas' hands were shaking now where they circled his wrists.
The day after that started with grumbled but sincere apologies and breakfast beer while they picked up the conversation again.  That time it had ended with carefully hidden tears.
a moon.  He could see brief cracks in the cloud cover here and there, little blinking stars hanging in the blackness of space just behind them, and he stumbled, remembering that less than an our ago he'd fucking been
this pain was different. Because, down here, different was worth looking at. Things seldom changed where he was.
He took a couple steps closer, taking a moment longer to observe the sleeping angel, before he started to feel like a creep.  Hadn’t he gotten mad at Cas for doing this exact same thing before?
his heart swelling in his chest and he smiled gently against Cas’ lips, open around little panting breaths.
Cas’ wings slid down over his shoulders, the large joints pressing in to the floor.  He used them like hands, pushing himself to his feet.
The squirrel abruptly bounded back up his wing, little fluffy tail straight up in the air as if it was having the time of it's life, and Castiel made a strangled noise in the back of his throat, reaching up to snatch the little critter off his wing.
Not long after Dean finished his coffee and went back inside, Sam got up and, together, they roused Cas as gently as they could, carefully stroking his wing until he stirred and pulled it back, squinting against the dim light of the lamp on the other side of the room.  Sam sat on Cas’ left, Dean on is right while he held Cas’ wrist like it was made of glass, waiting until he was sure Cas was awake and aware enough to understand what they were doing before gently rubbing his thumb on the inside of Cas’ forearm and asking him to manifested his blade.
The man didn't seem to notice Cas until he was standing a few feet away, then his big, brown eyes snapped over to the angel, looking fearful.
He pushed back from the table, feeling too close to everything in the room.  The legs of the chair caught in a grating screech on the floor and the sound tangled with the echo of his own screams, so loud inside his skull that he twitched to clutch at his throat, expecting it to be split wide with grace spilling out.
“I guess if no other leads come up we'll just keep heading for the college, then.  What choice do we have?” said Sam dejectedly.  “At the very least, our chances are good that someone there is already in contact with the necromancers in some capacity.  Or can lead us to someone who is.”
Cas cut off abruptly and Dean looked over in time to see one of his deepest scowls yet before the angel thrust the phone at him.  "He wants to talk to you.  He's being
Then his eyes caught up with his brain and he sagged, trying to calm his breathing because a fucking
Grudgingly, Castiel let himself soften a bit – blinking a few times, breathing – if only to maybe help put Dean at ease.  Apparently, his desire to soften himself for Dean was inescapable.
“We wanna kill something,” Dean replied, a little too eagerly.  Now that the prospect of some action was being dangled in front of him, he felt like he was about to burst at the seams if he didn't release some of the pent-up energy soon.
If either of them were taken aback by the strange name, they didn’t show it, and when the tall one spoke again, his voice had gone a bit more gentle, a bit more patient.
There was a red-faced man slumped on the bench outside the door and laying at his feet was a large and scraggy looking dog.  It didn't even lift its head when the trio walked by to push the door open.
When he was done and he could feel hot blood streaming down and soaking into the mattress, Castiel only barely managed to roll on to his other side and repeat the process on his right.
The words jogged the memory of pieces of his own vocabulary, sifted them back to the top of the pile like a gold pan and Castiel tried to communicate, “
He became aware of the tingle of Sam’s gaze on the side of his face and steeled himself before turning to glare at his brother.  Sam was wide awake, laying on his side with his head propped up against his fist and a shit-eating grin splitting his face.
The man's look turned grim.  "Not much left of the town, from what I hear.  The dragon attack nearly destroyed it.  I even heard it’s been over-run by bandits anyhow."  He shook his head gravely.  "Terrible business, that." He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder, towards the road that lead deeper into the mountains.  "But that road there will take you right to it.  I hope you're not lookin' for anything valuable you might have left behind; those bandits will have picked the place clean by now."
He was, once again, exhausted, and Castiel closed his eyes, unwilling to stare across the vast canyon that seemed to be growing between him and the brothers.  He’d never felt so starkly aware of the differences that separated their species.
And what a strange thing that was to hear, Castiel thought.  What a strange, strange thing it was to hear alarm in Dean’s voice when Castiel had thought he was dead.
But even though a little niggling of guilt was worming its way through Dean’s stomach, he would not stop and take off his shoes because there was no non-ridiculous explanation he could give that wouldn’t result in Sam teasing him for it until he died.  Not to mention, lately it seemed like every time Dean opened his mouth something about Cas came out and the weighted, shrewd looks that Jessy and Cesar kept giving him were getting…uncomfortable.  Like they thought they
Apparently unable to help himself, Cas had taken a few more steps towards Liam, but his gaze was laser-focused on the briefcase, a deep frown on his face. He stopped short and took half a step back when Liam looked at him again.
“You need help,” Dean told him gently.  “And I don’t know what to do, Cas, because you deserve…you deserve someone who knows what they’re doing.  You deserve someone that doesn’t fix problems with duct tape and whiskey and it kills me that I can’t give that to you.”
“Sam?!” He barked the name into his phone, biting down on his tongue until he could feel the pain of it and taste the blood.  Used it to
Swallowing the last mouthful of a cup of milk was a much bigger challenge than Castiel would have anticipated.  But he managed – didn’t he always?  His stomach contracted threateningly and he had to bow his head, pressing the palms of his hands into his eyes while he took measured breaths.
“Look for the bubbles,” Castiel told them absently, his glowing eyes flicking this way and that up at the sky like he could see through the fog and was looking for Hannah.  “They are quite deep down...” he trailed off with a frown, eyes now fixed off over the water.
"I guess we should wake him up," Sam eventually said.  "Don't know how he slept through the sound of that hammer.  You get him up, I'm gonna go find us something to eat."  Sam stood and stumbled out of the tent, momentarily blinding Dean with sunlight when he pulled the flap aside.
Dean hung around on the little deck to watch the angel's take flight.  He'd never get tired of watching Cas fly.
Speaking of, the angel's attention had moved to the road ahead and Dean readjusted his grip on the steering wheel, focusing on keeping the car between the lines.  He was the one driving, after all, it would be really embarrassing to have to explain to Sam that he'd gotten into an accident because he couldn't stop thinking about Cas' eyeballs.
“Ok, listen, buddy.  We’re gonna bust you out of here tonight whether its legal or not, ok?  But you gotta do something for me.  If they come in here again before I come back, you have to stop fighting them.  You don’t have to answer their questions but you
He decided against it, not wanting to bother with taking all his armor off again and then having to put it back on.
“Is there any chance this city is close by?”  Sam asked, casting a worried glance down at the angel.
He ignored Dean’s voice, rough with some emotion Castiel didn’t bother trying to decipher, and instead got the conversation back on track, because he had more to say.
"I'm sorry,” Dean said, not knowing what else to say.  He didn’t know what the Mythic Dawn was, or why they had captured her, and he was sensing that he shouldn’t ask.  Not right now.
Things were starting to realign themselves a little better now, Castiel thought, but his mind was still a jumble of hellish screams and echoes of pain and he was once again struggling to understand what Dean was trying to tell him. Though he told himself it was a small improvement to be able to tell someone was speaking at all.
He cursed and scrabbled backwards on instinct alone, losing his footing in the loose sand and tumbling back into the water, arms wind-milling.
at the bottom of the hill and squint into the midday haze.  Sure enough, he could just make out the fuzzy but unmistakable silhouette of a man-made structure standing tall and proud on top of a hill just to the south of a particularly gigantic mountain.
“Hey, I'm not causing a scene,” Dean said to the drunk with a hard smile and icy stare.  “We don't have a problem...do we, buddy?”
As he set the phone in the dumb ass little holder Sam had stuck to the dash for navigation purposes, Dean couldn’t help singing along to the cheesy song under his breath.
"So, uh...let's just poke around a bit, see if we can't find something useful to tell us where these vamps might be nesting," he managed to say eventually.
Dean rolled his eyes but still couldn’t wipe the smile off his face.  He shook his head fondly, waiting for Sam to get himself under control.  Absently, the memory of Cas’ feathers brushing the backs of his hands when Dean caught him in the field flashed through his mind and he looked over again.
He was building up his words, Castiel knew, turning them over in his head and rearranging them into whatever shape he needed.  Dean took longer to do that than Sam did, but they both did it regardless, soon after their faces moved like Dean's just had.
Castiel turned, blinking when he realized how far away they were, and then made his way back down the road to the brothers.
He was mostly back together – or as together as he could be with a good portion of him stuck in the claws of hell-beasts – when the pattern of vibrations against his ear drums suddenly took on a new meaning.
me!"  Castiel hissed and recoiled like an angry cat, glaring at Dean through eyes narrowed to slits.
“And what did you say about being past the reach of the etheric plane?”  Sam asked, curious – not worried – Dean was annoyed to note.
But this place, this building, it wasn't his to demolish, no matter how frustrated and restless he felt.
“Ok, the attitude isn’t necessary, Cas.  I get that you’re hurting but trying to guilt trip me into giving you drugs is just gonna piss me off.”  And he was pissed too. Pissed that Castiel could play him like a fucking fiddle and Dean could hardly stop from singing.
They'd stripped the angel down and washed away most of the blood and grime, which helped Dean feed his disillusion that maybe he was healing. But, if he was honest, Cas' skin was still too pale, like there wasn't a drop of blood in his veins. Dean traced the sharp line of Castiel's stubbled jaw with his eyes and then lingered on his full lips, remembering how they used to be just a little pink, but now were nearly white.
“Well, first, I’d like you to tell me if you’re cold.  You said you don’t get cold when you have access to your grace and right now you don’t.  So are you cold?”
He fell to his knees, the impact of hitting the wall vibrating through his vessel so hard he felt his true form rattling around inside it like a marble in a tin can.
, Cas. Just – just let me say this, ok?” He paused to take another breath, heart twisting in his chest because
From within the black holes in their helmets, the guards stared.  For a second, neither of them moved and Dean felt his muscles coiling, ready for a fight.
“My name is Castiel,” Cas answered, that same edge to his voice as when Dean had asked him that same question so many years ago.  “This is Sam and Dean Winchester.”
It was quiet save for the wind gently brushing through the tree tops, softly urging more leaves to fall, but the air on Dean’s face and hands was cool and held the promise of a harsh winter.  Under his feet, wet dirt and decaying leaves crunched under his boots, filling his nostrils and conjuring images of snow dusted ground.
,” Castiel drawled lowly, letting his unimpressed gaze shift from one brother to the next, but couldn’t keep it up for long.  After all, he was quite sure that was more sleep than he’d gotten since falling.
Castiel took the proffered clothing and watched Dean’s back until he was out of the room and his footsteps had faded down the hall.  Back towards where his mother and brother were waiting.  Only then, when he was sure he was alone, did Castiel close the door and jam the desk chair under the handle.
“I think you might need a haircut, angel.”  There was fondness in Dean’s words and his smile was soft.
On the left side of the bridge, an invader would have to cross the half-frozen river and clamber across a field of moving ice sheets that had piled up and cluttered the bottom of the wall.  On the right side of the bridge, the city walls disappeared right in to the open salt water.  There was a thin dock jutting out into the river, and a few long boats that Dean could barely make out in the dark, but that was it.
They were led up a wooden staircase, which opened up to the second level of the inn: a common room with many tables and chairs situated around a large stone fireplace in the center of the room.
Dean’s mouth dropped open a fraction before he caught it and his green eyes darted over Castiel’s shoulder.  To his wings.
.  People get sick sometimes.  It's nothing, ok?  You gotta stop thinking about what you can't do any more and start realizing that you help just by being here.  Sam knows you care about him, even if he acts like your mother-henning him is annoying he secretly loves it."  He kept his eyes on the road but let his thumb stroke back and forth over the firm muscle under his hand.  "You might not be able to just blast away Sam's cough, but knowing how much you care about us...that helps in a different way."
, but it had been a while since he ate and he’d hardly slept in seventy-two hours and shitty hospital coffee sounded like a god send in that moment.  Besides, they needed to work out some kind of plan and Dean was losing steam fast.  Their usual ‘barge in with guns already firing’ wasn’t really going to work in a hospital.  The very thought of the task before them and the careful plan it needed was enough to make Dean’s head feel too heavy to hold up.  In that moment, he was sure if he tried hard enough he would be able to feel whole sections of his brain going offline.
“The prophecy is dire but not without hope.  One individual, gifted by Aaktosh with the very powers held by the dragons themselves, the Dragonborn is the only living mortal who can not only slay a dragon, but consume its soul so that it can never rise again. It is this person, this
The Impala rumbled to a stop and Dean told Cas to wait while he paid for a room, dashing from the car and into the dingy lobby, suppressing a squeal when icy cold raindrops pelted him, soaking through his hair and dripping down the back of his neck like tiny ice cubes.
Cas ignored him as he ducked out of the tent, leaving his armor sitting near the flap, right beside his bow, quiver and three glass bottles with brightly colored and highly questionable contents.
"Dean," Castiel breathed, tongue darting out to lick the water off his full lips, "You're pulling my feathers."
Cas seemed more aware than he had a few hours ago but his pupils were still huge and his movements were still sluggish and uncoordinated.  He was a long way from sober and it was going to make getting out of there that much more difficult.
Despite the fuzz at the corners of Castiel’s vision and despite the way his stomach was still protesting the milk, Castiel smiled, feeling the gaping hole where his grace used to be shrink a little.
A hundred years later, when 'later tomorrow evening' finally rolled around, Sam was the next person through the door and Dean wished his hands weren’t cuffed so he could hug his stupid brother.
Castiel blinked and his grin slackened, his cheeks flushing pink and all the little feathers – the ones that dry in seconds – lifted, making his wings look fluffy.
“Anyway, long story short I, uh, I couldn’t swing this thing fast enough and it almost got my brother killed.  You got anything you might want to trade for it?”
come to me when you’re not feeling good and - I can’t promise I can fix it -but I can at least make sure you don’t have to go through it alone anymore.”
doing it the last few months – staying quiet, making Dean talk – it had been both incredibly helpful in helping them as a family unit and a total pain in his ass.
of it. When Cas pushed closer Dean sighed through the blood roaring in his ears, taking every instinct screaming '
At the centre of the tent, the coals were still burning steady and hot in their bowl.  Dean chose to assume magic was the reason behind their longevity, instead of the alternative of someone coming in to the tent to stoke them in the night.
Cesar and Jessy sat side by side across the table from Dean, leaning in to each other while their eyes darted between Dean and Cas and the tension mounted.
be useful,” he acquiesced as he gestured for them all to sit at the table.  Apparently it was going to be a long story.
Dean waited a few seconds to make sure Cas was done talking before he released the breath he was holding all at once. Cas had just said more in the last ten seconds than he had in the last ten days and Dean was still reeling from the sudden change.
The brothers shared a look, about to ask what was happening, but then soft blue light began to shine from under the angel's lashes and anything Dean was going to ask was whisked out his ears.
Dean’s heart gave an aching beat.  He wished they at least had some windows they could open for a little fresh air.  Cas obviously felt helplessly trapped and Dean tried to close the door as gently as possible but it still clanged like a jail cell when the mechanism fell in to place. Cas flinched, shoulders hunching, knuckles white where he was gripping the banister.
“Where?” was all he'd asked, the word stilted and heavy in his mouth. Over and over he'd asked with growing frustration every time he failed to understand the answer Dean gave him.
Though the damp and the drizzle pushed in on them from outside, Dean made sure the fire stayed well stoked and burning hot enough to push back the chill all through the night while Cas slept, comfortable and warm, in the cradle of his wings.
He looked upset about it and Castiel surreptitiously sniffed the air.  It was unmistakably guilt rolling off Dean in waves of sour musk.  He dared to look at his soul, just a peek, to confirm what he was smelling.  A familiar mix of chartreus and copper undulated around the edges of Dean’s soul, confirming what Cas’ nose was telling him.
Dean wanted to scoff at the absurdity of the question, but found his throat was clogged and tight with worry - which turned to panic when Cas’ gaze simply drifted away without an answer.
“It will feel similar but will last longer due to the massive distance.  There is also a minor complication that may arise once we leave the reach of the etheric plane and have to travel through space.” He frowned, staring between them at the wall as he thought.  “Of course, humans need oxygen to stay alive and there is none beyond earth's atmosphere.  Luckily, I can fly even faster in the vacuum of space and I can feed oxygen into your blood for the few minutes it takes to reach Nirn.  Yes, that should work.”
The burning smell slithered up his nostrils, forcing itself in like a wriggling snake that curled around his brain and lungs and
“What's wrong?”  Sam's voice was grave, as if he was expecting Dean to tell him the second apocalypse was coming in the morning.
The change in Dean was immediate.  His green eyes nearly lit up, clearly relieved to be of some perceived use.  “Yeah…yeah, come on, we’ll get you cleaned up.”
It took nearly twenty minutes of explaining - and then re-explaining - what had happened over the last few days and even then Castiel still looked confused.  He rubbed absently at his shoulder, fingers catching on Dean’s leather jacket, looking thoroughly disconcerted.
It was only then that he noticed a second arrow embedded in the man’s chest, right over his heart.  It had taken two fatal blows to take him down.
He kept his distance and let Cas set the pace, something in his chest aching a little every time Castiel glanced over his shoulder as if expecting something to be lurking behind him. His wings were curled around his body protectively and he was hugging the wall as he walked, blue eyes darting this way and that, never lingering longer than was necessary to deem that particular spot free of danger before flitting to the next.
“Coconut good?”  Dean asked blandly, just to say something to stop his mushy thoughts.  He wouldn’t be surprised if the birdsong he was hearing was actually from the ones flying around his head.
Castiel hooked his thumbs in the elastic waistband of his current bottoms – another pair of Dean’s, green and grey plaid – when Dean suddenly turned his back, ears flaming red.
“I don't remember any of this,” Cas told him gravely as he picked up the beater Sam had left on the counter. The chord slipped from where it was coiled around the handle and dropped, the plug striking the floor at Cas' feet and making him flinch; he held it at arms length as if worried it might bite him.
neck-line that could only be closed up by tightening the cotton string that crisscrossed through the fabric.  He wondered what the point of such a neck-line might be as he made sure – for the third time – that it was securely tied closed.
The tall one pulled a small notepad from his pocket, his back to Dean while the short one turned so he could keep an eye on him.
Dean gulped down another few mouthfuls of…whatever the waitress had brought him.  She was in her twenties and he’d told her to surprise him.
“Well Cas, we asked for something to do and you didn't disappoint.  I'm definitely not bored anymore,” he looked to his brother, who was still bent over his phone, peering down at the screen as if it held the answers to the universe.  “Whaddaya say, Sammy?”
In the brief moment Castiel’s eyes darted up, they stared right through Dean – hyper-alert but completely lost.
With a grunt, Dean let his eye fall back to the fire.  “You sleep first.  I'll wake you in a few hours.”
Dean was at last starting to feel less ravenous as he tucked into the third piece of pie but when he glanced over at Sam, he froze with the fork halfway to his mouth.
He looked like he was already changing it, his lips pursing into a thin line as his eyes narrowed on the young man before him.  The index and middle finger of his right hand rubbed absently, back and forth, over the arrow shaft still notched in the bow.
“'Course.  They took over the fort after the Imperials were driven out and they don't take kindly to strangers they find bumbling past their door.”
“Uh, yeah.  But this woman – the dark elf, remember?  She's trying to hunt it too and we don't want her to get it first 'cause I mean, how often do you get a chance to slay a dragon?”  Dean said, thinking quickly and trying to keep up with the inebriated man's illogical leaps in thought.
“Judging by the look on your face, that’s a crock of shit,” Dean declared blandly.  Cas didn’t correct him and still wouldn’t look at either of them.  “C’mon man, I know it’s hard to talk about this shit, but you gotta try.  Would you be fine giving him certain feathers and not others?  He didn’t specify, so if you are, then –“
Dean licked his lips and briefly looked away before holding up a single finger and pinning Castiel with that look that made him feel a hundred million years younger than he was.  “Alright, ‘
His attention was pulled away from his depressing thoughts when Castiel suddenly weaved between the grab of Hannah's hands.  It seemed as if he had finally provoked her into attacking, and he backed quickly away, chuckling lowly.  Then his wings were suddenly there, beating down forcefully like he'd had to break through the barrier keeping them hidden, and Dean sucked in a breath.
Both Hannah and Cas' wings had gotten fluffy, all the feathers puffing up like Dean had seen birds do when sleepy or cold, and they had both curled their wings around their shoulders and shuffled closer to the fire.
He looked up, to where the flowers Cas had been looking at were, wondering what they were called and why he wanted them.
Dean brought his other hand to the side of Cas’ face and waited until Cas opened his eyes again before firmly saying, “There is nothing worth you dying.
With his vision now clear, Castiel could see Liam kneeling beside him, looking pale, drawn, and old.  Tilting his head back he stared up at Sam, who was the one pinning his wrists to his wings, his large hands nearly able to encircle both.
After that they poked around the abandoned city a while longer at Castiel's insistence but found no other clues that would help them find the Dragonborn other than the chopping block – and even that was a stretch and didn’t add anything useful to their knowledge.
He could feel Sam staring her down beside him and she looked between them, giving a short nod and then making a gesture for them to follow.  She was wearing a plain cream-colored dress and white apron and her greying hair was tied in a bun tighter than what seemed comfortable.
Castiel’s wide eyes immediately flew to Dean and Dean knew just what that would look like to the two cops.  They didn’t know that on their last hunt Dean had had to diffuse a situation when the waitress at the diner tried to make polite conversation by asking Cas what they were doing in such a small town.  They didn’t know that Castiel was only looking to him because he wasn’t sure what he was and was not allowed to tell them.
Dean mumbled that it was fine, using the time to try and get his circling thoughts in order and his wayward emotions under control.  There was a few more minutes of Liam sorting out his car and Dean nervously pacing from one corner of his room, around his bed to the other corner, and then back again before he finally heard a car door slamming closed and Liam muttering while he tried to figure out the Bluetooth settings.
Dean relaxed and glanced over to where Cas had stepped into the pool of water, soaking his pants up to the ankles, and turned back so he was facing Sam.  His blue eyes would occasionally flick past Sam’s broad shoulders, landing on Cesar and Jessy as if to check they were still where he’d last seen them.
It was barely past lunch and already his legs were aching and sore and the way his armor was sitting on his chest reminded him with every step that he had been bulldozed by an Orc the day before.
Sam sighed.  “Yeah, that's what I thought.  In the morning, you guys go for a walk and sort this shit out because oh my god
He took Dean back to their smithy.  The man that had woken them all with his hammer was covered from head to toe in soot and grime, but, at Thorygg’s order, moved to open a large wooden trunk sitting near his anvil.
But for once Dean couldn’t be worried about it, because a much, much bigger problem had just been revealed to him and his stomach was sinking through the floor.
in Dean's voice and an urge to reassure him surged powerfully in his chest.  With every scrap of energy he had, Castiel made the effort to
“You just need some rest, that’s all,” Dean told him, as if that answered his question.  As if he had
keep competitors from pushing in on her mead profits.  She controls most of the breweries in the province.  Every time a new one pops up, within a few months, they’ve suddenly gone out of business.  I’ve tried to put in orders at new breweries to try and support some competition but…none of the shipments ever arrived and I, like every other inn keeper I’ve spoken to, always end up going back to her for our mead."
Umm...so some of you may noticed I added a Cas/Dean tag.  It's gonna be super duper slow burn and there won't be any smut...but, romantic feels will be had between them fo sho.  Anyways....tell me what you think of this chapter!  The World Serpent stuff just came to me while I was editing it.  But I liked writing that little bit so kept it in.
“It was just a cold, Cas and I needed to come help you guys.  Here, come on, take my hand.”  He went around to Cas other side and Cas wrapped his fingers around Sam’s larger hand.
Still, that didn’t stop him from worrying.  Nor did it ease the squeeze in his gut when he watched Cas dump three pills into his hand and dry swallow them like a pro.  Or, more accurately, like the strung out version of the fallen angel Dean had seen in 2014.  They may have avoided that exact future but Dean knew that version of Castiel was in there – deep down maybe, but completely possible.  If there were any living beings that were set up for the most addictive personalities ever, it had to be angels.  They never did anything half-assed.  Any challenge presented to them was either completely ignored or tackled full-boar.
The brothers agreed and left the angel to sweet-talk the patrons and owner while they went back outside.  Dean eyed the drunk guy still sitting, half conscious, on the bench by the door and nudged Sam’s arm.
Little spiderwebs of electricity were swimming over the stunned angel's body and Cas staggered, his wings twitching at his back and his bow falling from stiff fingers.  His eyes and his gasping mouth flickered with the light of his grace, much like demons flickered when stabbed with Ruby’s blade.
Castiel for millions upon millions of years before Dean had become part of his life.  He was the size of the Chrysler building.  He had wings and thousands of eyes and he thought differently than humans did.  It was easy to forget that, when he walked around in a human body and talked like a human and dressed like a human.
Blushing, because the irony of that statement was that his wings were getting in the way of much more than just his ability to put on a sweater, Castiel subtly mushed the fleece bottoms in his hands, feeling the soft fibers.
“…no,” Sam muttered, his face red.  “Sorry…uh…so...so who's Talos?”  Sam asked as they descended the stone steps, back down into the city, obviously wanting to change the subject.
Reaching down, Castiel rubbed his hand over his thigh and felt nothing but smooth, unbroken skin under the soft fabric.  Well, that explained it.  The sigil had healed completely while he slept.  He spit an Enochian curse.  That tea had been potent, and he’d slept right through the usual warning signs that the sigil was starting to lose its effectiveness.
When two spots of colour appeared high on Castiel's cheeks, Dean felt like he could breathe again but there wasn't enough air around and his fingers twitched with the urge to reach up and feel the heat coming off Castiel's tanned skin.
His grace pulsed in his agitation and his bonds crushed back.  He grunted, as if he’d just taken a blow to the sternum, but ploughed on.
Dean was shaking his head fondly, his eyes as soft as the smile on his lips as he stared down at Castiel.  He still had his large hands circled around Castiel’s arms.
“Let me,” the hunter said quietly, taking the needle from him, not even reacting when a bit of Castiel’s blood smeared on his fingertips.
Their room was…quite nice, he admitted.  Fancier than any inn they had stayed in so far.  It was large and in a dormitory style with three single beds, one on each wall.  But the linens were soft wool, died green with golden embroidery around the edges.  There was a wash basin at the foot of each bed and two large windows that were likely perpetually frosted over.  On the wall with the double doors, a large stone fireplace pushed back the chill coming off the single pane windows.
“That means you gotta tell us if something like what happened in the kitchen happens again.  We might not be able to stop it from happening but we can at least make it easier on you.”  He took a moment to stare at and fidget with his hands again.  “I hate seeing you hurting, Cas.  It…I hate that I can’t make you feel better.”
When he came back down the steps, Sam, Cesar and Jessy were all standing around the war room table, as if only awaiting Dean’s order to put their boots back on and go search the woods for Cas.  Sam looked both mildly amused and a touch worried, though the later melted away as soon as he saw the flowers in Dean’s hands.
The brothers sat on either side of the angel, right in the middle of his nest with him, while Cas laid between them and took controlled breaths, while he dragged his hand over his throat like he did every time, seemingly unable to help himself.  They reminded him that he was safe, reminded him to breathe, and waited for the disorientation to recede from his eyes.
His wings flexed at his back and his sharp eyes raked over the challenge before him once more before he turned to the brothers.
The coals in the iron bowl crackled quietly and Castiel regarded the man with narrowed eyes.  "We've not allied with the Imperials, if that is your concern."
They walked accross, between tall wooden pillars that met over their heads in high peaks, drawing the eye upwards naturally. Dean had to crane his neck to stare up at the tallest points of the building.  The entire structure, though made entirely of wood, was formidable and intimidating and beautiful in the way he'd always thought Viking-type architecture was.  That, coupled with the backdrop of jagged mist-bound mountain peaks and the city banners waving and snapping in the wind…well.  It might just take your breath away.
wasn't an option – and it had been a proverbial gold mine, if your kind of treasure was obscure knowledge about angels. It was the only book of it's kind, the man had assured them in a thick accent and a thicker hand clutched around the wad of bills the brothers had handed him.
“Cas?” he called through the wood. He twisted the handle slowly, and eased the door open a crack. “Cas, I'm coming in.”
Cas' wings were half spread, flexed back to prop himself up against the bottom of the pond, and he blinked wide eyes up at Dean, his lips parted with water running down his face.
happier, Dean,” Sam said slowly, cautiously, like he was still deciding how to say what he wanted.  “But he's not at the same time.  It didn't make sense until Hannah spelled it out for us, though.  He's happy but he feels guilty about it and after everything she told us about what angels went through...it makes sense.  It's really – it's tragic, man.  I had no idea that's why angels are the way they are.”
He drifted off with a niggling in the back of his brain that told him there was something in that conversation they could follow.
Cas stopped at the top of the steps, eyes trained on Liam, and even though there was no physical movement in his face, the intensity of his gaze had gone up several notches.
They didn’t have room for another mistake.  Cas had an iron grip on himself now, but no one could keep that up forever.  Dean wouldn’t want him to even if he could.  The way Cas was now – the way he
Dean felt ill.  It wasn't often he got a glimpse into Castiel's past, or what it really meant when he said he was a ‘Warrior of God’, but this...this was too fucking tragic.
Echoes of pain stabbed through him, stealing the breath from his lungs and making him choke.  He could feel Lucifer’s tainted light glaring through the cracks in his body, could feel his brother curling around him like a snake and crushing, crushing,
, I've been thinking it might be cool to go somewhere just 'cause we damn well please and, since we're already here, why not go to the beach?”
Sam was leaning back in his chair now, folding his hands over his stomach like he had no intention of going anywhere any time soon. Or particularly quickly.
Saadia and Hulda suddenly appeared with their arms full of plates of food and mugs of ale and Sam, Dean and Cas all reached out to help take some of the items and set them down.
But Castiel shook his head, his anger morphing into something cold, dark, and vastly more unpleasant.  “How do I know this is real?”
“My, my, you’re very pale, Dean.  You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” Crowley chuckled.  He glanced around the war room disinterestedly, but was clearly taking everything in despite having been there before.
Just behind Cas was the unmistakable arch of a massive wing joint over each shoulder and from where he stood ten paces away, Dean could clearly make out the signs of a hard landing in the chaotic mess of white and tawny feathers.
Brief, but terribly real, memories of reaching for his grace after Metatron had cut him open and taken it flashed through his mind.  He brought his hand to his throat, needing to confirm there was no gaping wound through which his grace had been stolen.
There was light this time, incredibly dim and soft like a single candle in the middle of a cave, but he squinted against it's glare all the same, his attention catching on it immediately, unable to look anywhere else. The soft rumbling returned and the light winked out for a second when something passed in front of it.
, he thought.  Cas was always that strong.  Because he was a fallen fucking angel, not a human that responded to anything like these doctors were used to.
A few moments of silence passed while both Liam and Cas stood with eyes closed and heads bowed, until Cas pulled away with a sudden, ragged gasp and Liam swayed forward as if tethered by some invisible string tied to Cas’ fingers.
Aeranir continued.  "Leading Tamriel into the Oblivion Crisis, Martin Septim, the sole remaining heir to the throne, was able to seal shut the gates of Oblivion.  However, by destroying the Amulet of Kings and sacrificing himself to prevent the Empire's annihilation, Martin Septim inadvertently brought about the demise of Tiber Septim's bloodline, ending the historical rule of the Dragonborn emperors over Tamriel.  The subsequent ‘fall of the White Tower’ predicted the capturing and destruction of the White-Gold Tower after the siege on the Imperial City by the Aldmeri Dominion."
out of shape as Sam liked to think, but he was also used to shorter bursts of activity.  These long, never-ending hikes were brutal.  Add to that the fact that they had eaten what was surely less than two thousand calories a day for the last few days well…Dean was starting to think that Cas might need a crash course on human metabolisms and how it worked.
There was precious little time for processing, for as soon as Dean's eyes landed on one thing, something else was already grabbing his attention and now they were walking in to a small market.  A few stands with vegetables and meat on display were positioned around a wide-mouthed well and there were people milling about between the stalls.  Dean saw a woman dressed in deep blue robes with an impeccably groomed grey fur shawl bartering with an ancient looking woman standing behind a display of silver jewelry.
Crowley flashed them a grin.  Sam scowled but went to the kitchen and returned a moment later with three glasses and a very old looking bottle.  Apparently, this discussion was heavy enough to break the no booze rule.
They both shook their heads and Castiel didn't elaborate.  He did not have the energy to relive that memory a second time.
“Dean, come on,” Castiel called to him patiently.  “I saw some large stones farther down the shore line that should work.”
Dean brushed a few strands of hair off Castiel's forehead and picked up the new book he'd brought in to start reading, the dim light of the desk lamp just enough to see by without straining his eyes. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, a book society and Charlie had been telling him for years that he needed to read.
“It, um...it helped.  I don't remember a lot of what I watched but it was noise when everything was too quiet.  When it got too quiet I could hear the...nothingness.”
He was laying in cool, wet grass, he realized, and he kept right on laying there, hauling lungful after lungful of crisp, clear, wonderful air into his body and worming his fingers into the dewy blades, letting it soak into his thin tunic and pants, relishing the hard ground under him.
, came here to Nirn...”  Dean trailed off, so many questions swirling in his head that he didn't really know where to start.
Something in Dean’s chest cracked, threatening to shatter like brittle glass, and he fell back into his chair, rubbing his shaking fingers over his lips to hide how they trembled.
make me happy, Dean,” Castiel told him, a little breathlessly.  “And I do not like that I have been hurting you unintentionally.”
.  Even death would be a mercy, Dean, why –” he bowed his head, unable to hold Dean’s gaze anymore as despair and confusion crawled up his throat.  “
She emerged with the baggie of coconut and then spotted the six-foot-tall and eighteen-foot-wide angel stomping towards her and froze in abject terror, tail twitching once.
They didn’t seem to care.  Hands grabbed his arms and wings, pushing him into the floor every time he tried to move, consequently driving the glass deeper into his skin.  He growled low in his throat, annoyed even through the pain and confusion.
“I know, Dean.  I understand.  But let me surmise for you:  either I am too powerful and need to be stopped or I am too weak and a liability.  Where exactly on the spectrum of usefulness do I need to reside so that I may continue to be the family you say I am?  Do
Now, Cas looked seconds away from taking flight, his wings tensing and spreading, and Dean suddenly remembered that he'd been about to ask them to look for firewood before Cas had come running out of the little hut in naught but a pair of old jeans.
“Maybe we should ask him,” Dean suggested half-heartedly.  “Maybe – maybe feathers are to angels what hair is to humans.  Maybe its no big deal.”
“Dean?”  Why wouldn’t Dean let him heal Sam?  It was one of the few things he could still do.  And after all, it was his fault Sam was even in need of healing.  If he’d only been more careful, if he’d only stayed more aware of his surroundings instead of selfishly allowing himself to grieve Dean’s death so thoroughly –
They’d made some progress today, Dean reminded himself, even as he watched Cas visibly withdraw from them.  And they had gotten consent that well and truly
Cas' glowing eyes remained fixed on the newcomers, his wings still spread in a hostile warning sign to
He did a double take when he noticed the truck nearest to the garage door was gone.  It was the one Sam favoured, but his heart skipped a beat.
The angel glanced over his shoulder, looking mildly concerned, “What’s wrong with my wings?”  He lifted his left arm and spread his left wing a little, looking for whatever he thought Dean had seen.
The brothers fell in line behind the angel, walking as quickly as they could without looking suspicious.  Less than a minute later the door to the tavern slammed open a second time, so hard that the drunk sitting on the bench gave a violent start and dropped his empty tankard.
Briefly, Dean glanced at his brother, a look of understanding dawning in his eyes.  He turned back to Cas, and his movements were a little less tense, his words gone even softer.
Impossibly, Dean’s eyes softened even more and his smile looked both sad and elated.  His fingers tightened around Castiel’s arms.
Cas threw a dirty look over his shoulder, then turned to face the man, his eyes flashing with grace and his wings bristling at his back, spreading a little in a minorly threatening display.
A contemplative look smoothed Castiel’s brow.  “I never thought of that.  I could learn to make pie.”
When his fingers circled the pommel of the blade, there was an unmistakable flare of recognition and he
Sam and Dean both lurched in his direction, eyes wide and bodies tense like there was something tangible to fight, but then they stopped short at the same time, hesitating.  Arranging their words, trying to decide what to do.
"What happened to her?"  Dean asked gently.  He'd expected that she’d died, given the softness with which Cas had said her name, but he felt a pang in his chest knowing her death had probably caused Castiel sadness.
The screaming had stopped, he realized, and ice cascaded into his stomach. He was scared to turn around but the sound of something small and metal hitting the concrete floor took the choice away from him and Dean was already spinning, the machete raised defensively.
Dean grinned, reaching over his shoulder and pulling the ridiculously large steel greatsword from the sheath against his back.  “How
The trio made their way down the street, in search of a guard to start asking questions, but hadn't been walking long when Cas stopped, frowning off between two stone houses.
The Jarl seemed to have recovered from his shock and sighed heavily, as if the weight of something massive lay across his ornate shoulders.  “These stories are more than mere folk tales passed around taverns and between traveling merchants, angel.”  He leveled a heavy look upon all three of them.  “They are all true.”
Cas' eyes dart around the room, land on the glass shards on the floor and the blanket half off the bed, before they settle on Dean again.
“Okay, let’s do this,” Sam said, failing to sound anything other than very, very tired.  He was carefully avoiding looking at Cas, perhaps just as unnerved by the lack of animation in his face as Dean was.
convince him to press charges, your foundation of evidence – all of which relies on the word of a man
Thorygg relaxed just a little.  "The Greybeards are not concerned with politics; you must be here for the dragons."
Farther up the path, Cas was staring at the butterflies fluttering around his head.  Of course he was.  His face was blank but his wings were suspiciously fluffy.
Shelving his pride, Dean left the garage and headed for Cas’ room.  It would soon be time to redraw the sigil.  They got roughly twenty-four hours out of each one but it felt like a week ago that he’d had to carve the last one into Cas’ chest, trying to keep his hand steady while the angel gasped and clutched at Sam’s shirt and tried not to let it show how much it was hurting him.  But it hadn’t been a week ago, it had only been yesterday, and Dean didn’t want that critical point to pass by again.  He didn’t want to ever have to see Cas being
, isn't like us.  He thinks differently than we do.  He sees things differently than we do.  He has instincts that we don't, that we can't really understand.  Just because they're sleeping with each other doesn't mean they're having sex.”
ridiculous,” Dean countered.  “Your blue eyes are ridiculous and your perma bed-head is ridiculous.  Your wings are ridiculously
Now that his grace was dormant, he was going to need to heal the human way and let his vessel do all the work.
After a full minute, he righted himself, and wiped the sweat off his forehead, hands shaking and Cas’ pleas echoing in the forefront of his mind.
“You speak the language of the Dragons?”  the Jarl asked, torn between awe and suspicion.  His large and heavily scarred hands had tightened around the edge of the table he was leaning on, knuckles white.
The town was settling down for the night, and Dean glanced at the tavern door, sure Gerdur would no longer be at the mill by now.  In the distance, an owl hooted, punctuating the clock ticking in Dean’s mind.
"Wake up, Cas." he whispered for the thousandth time, trying to project his thoughts into Cas' brain by sheer will power alone.
you weren't well and I still...Sam – Sam said you showed signs of PTSD after the whole thing with Rowena and I didn't fucking listen to him because I was so caught up trying to fix
“What...what's the planet called and uh, where...where is it?”  he asked tentatively, as if he wasn't sure he wanted to know the answer.
Down close to one of his hands, his nerve endings flared in warning – something was touching him – and he flinched away. Or he tried to; his newly discovered body didn't seem capable of cooperating beyond a small twitch of his fingers.
“I can get you one though,” Dean amended quickly, it seemed likely that the owner had kicked the guy out and refused to serve him more.  Dean would have done the same thing; nothing kills a business like a patron drinking themselves to death in your bar.
He also would probably have assumed that those few conversations wouldn’t have been as forced and stilted as they were but…well, here he was.
They were dancing again, like they always did.  Despite Dean's desire to be direct it seemed Castiel had developed his own habits when speaking with Dean about anything emotional.  He mentally slapped himself, redoubling his efforts; it seemed as if he had his own conditioning to un-teach Cas.
Cas, understandably, was having no such quiet revelations and walked right through the middle of the market, drawing a few curious looks but nothing like he would have on Earth.  He kept his wings folded tight, angling himself this way and that to slip past people without touching them.
The words were still waiting patiently on the paper, in no hurry to distract him, so he sat down and read them himself.  Around the edges of the chapped ink, the things he was trying to ignore pressed down on him like the sea on a diver's helmet.
"Uh..."  Dean wondered what was worse: being in the shower and thinking about how well that wet shirt was clinging to Cas' skin or being out here and thinking about Cas in the shower with
He'd always teased Cas about how he looked like he had a stick up his ass all the time, but now Dean was starting to think that had less to do with angels thinking and acting like robots and more to do with the fact that they constantly had a major and important part of themselves hidden away. Not quite like severing their wings completely but it had to be close and would certainly cause discomfort.
Dean saw Castiel look to him in a desperate plea for guidance one last time before he was shoved outside and the officer pulled the door closed behind them.
Sam came back into the room before Dean could say anything.  His brother had a large, cast iron kettle in one hand and in the other he clutched a large chunk of something yellow and rough that could only be soap.  Under his arm was a wad of cloths.
“Enough of that,” Liam whisper-snapped, glancing at Cas again.  “We will be discussing this in depth
"What do I do, Cas?" Dean muttered, not really expecting and answer. Because that's what they did. They asked Cas what to do when they were lost and Cas always had an answer. He crouched in front of the angel, staring up at him, pleading. "Tell me what to do."
Dean and Sam shifted closer together, reflexively creating a barrier between the angel and the hateful glare he was receiving.
Sam was keeping his mouth shut and Dean scowled at him.  He knew why Sam was doing it, for the same reason he’d
"We're tired,” Dean informed him simply, as soon as he was close enough to not need to shout.  "We need to
“So, are we stopping here for info first or hitting it on the way back?”  Sam asked, both he and Dean moving to walk closer to the angel to keep their conversation at least semi-private.
Sam and Cas were both still sound asleep and the fire was burning strong in the grate, so he decided to get some more sleep himself before they had to be back on the road.
Dean released a harsh breath, thanking whoever was listening that something had fucking gone right tonight.
For a long time neither of them said anything and Castiel kept his mouth closed while Dean stared at him.  It was obvious, despite his efforts and true to form, that he'd only managed to make the other man more upset with his attempt to explain himself.
“Well, if the rumors' to be believed then you'll 'ave plenty o' chances soon enough.”  The man took another swig of his ale.
Liam looked over his shoulder.  “Castiel, why don’t you go get some fresh air?  Try not to wander far, or we’ll worry.”  He smiled tightly.
Here's the next chapter, as promised!  Thanks for all the feedback, keep it comin!  Also, I haven't slept in a while so if there are any continuity errors that you notice, please let me know so I can fix them.  Cheers.
He'd woken up early enough that the sun had not yet risen and had tasked himself with stoking the nearly dead fire again, till the flames were to the height of his chest, then stood back with his hands stuffed in the pockets of his jacket while he waited for day to break.
Thunder rumbled far off to the west and Cas blinked up at him with wide eyes and parted, reddened lips.
There was pressure on his chest again and Castiel finally opened his eyes to Dean pressing a towel over the sigil, his face pale.  In the dim light from the backup lights, Castiel could just make out drying tear tracks on his face.  Next to him, Liam was wiping off a gleaming scalpel with a small cloth.  A scalpel that Castiel could tell just by looking had been forged from an angel blade.
“He’s messed up.  Bad,” he continued.  He stared at the table, remembering the way Castiel’s blue eyes had glowed in the darkness of his bedroom.  Remembering how he shook incessantly, how he fought Dean’s hold like it burned, how he’d only talked because Dean had ordered him to.
It was only after Dean had pulled out the chair beside him and sat down so that he was facing Castiel, that Dean said what he wanted.
He hit the floor, could feel his whole body convulsing from the tips of his fingers all the way to his toes as his grace seethed and clawed at his insides.  He tried not to fight the agony of it, but that was as easy as trying not to pull free of a snare.  And so he struggled with all the panic of an animal with a wire around it’s neck as his grace was roughly – barbarically – bound.
being arrested for assaulting a nurse or causing a scene.  I’m good at pretending to be a lawyer but if you land yourself back in that interrogation room, we’re all fucked.”  He jabbed a finger in Dean’s chest.  “Keep your temper under control because Cas is the one that will suffer if you lose it.”
“Man, you weren’t kidding,” Jessy mumbled.  It was the first thing he said and it was accompanied by a slow exhale, as if he was consciously trying to let go of his prejudices surrounding non-humans.
Sam threw the dirty water – dark a muddy looking with all the dried blood in it – out the little window between the beds and then left to go order them some breakfast.  As soon as he was gone, Dean poured the rest of the hot water into the basin, inhaling the sweet-smelling steam in a long pull through his nose.
Cas always let Dean do the talking.  The angel had once told him that he had no interest and no patience for coaxing information from stubborn monsters and preferred to leave it to the brothers and await orders to either kill or fight.  Dean sometimes wondered if that was just an ingrained instinct that angels couldn't shake.  Cas was a soldier, had been for his entire existence.  Sure he could win a staring contest with a stone - if he
It tickled when Dean reached up and brushed a few hairs out of Castiel’s eyes and he blinked up at Dean curiously.
“Yes,” Cas replied simply.  “I've heard scattered tales of the prophecy and whispers of past Dovahkiin.  Tiber Septim, Miraak, and Reman Cyrodiil.  But that is all I have heard: whispers and rumors.”
Another hour passed – a few minutes in to which Sam showed up with his laptop, another chair and a determined look. Dean had protested at first, but eventually allowed Sam to set the computer on his dresser and load up something on Netflix for them to watch, the volume on low.
Back on the road, Dean pulled out his phone - which he'd practically had to pry out of the cop's hand when he got his stuff back - to google all the hospitals in the city.  They didn’t know which one Cas was at, so they would just start with the closest one and work their way out.
Castiel nodded back, the movement a subconscious mirror.  He stared up at Dean steadily, most of the panic gone from his eyes, replaced with something more focused and infinitely more disturbing.
the food came up and the brothers decided to forgo using the Coleman if they could help it and instead they each pulled on a sweater from their duffel bags and headed out to find some rocks and dig a fire pit.
He looked around the garage, belatedly wondering what he should do if the glasses were to reveal something to him
As if reminded of the role it could play in his atonement, the binding around his grace contracted, digging in to him.  He refused to flinch.
Dean frowned, not understanding, until he looked over at Sam and saw his brother’s face torn between outrage and anger.
"What do you mean, I look like I enjoy a drink now and then?"  Dean snarked, crossing his arms over his armored chest and flexing.
Dean became aware of the fact that, under the water, he was nestled snugly between Cas' thighs and his arms were pressed against Cas' bare shoulders.  Beneath his hands, he could feel soft feathers and sand between his fingers and as he stared down into the angel's deep blue eyes, a drop of water fell from the tip of his nose and landed on Cas’ collar bone.
But still, the edge had effectively been taken off and Dean had to ask twice if Cas wanted the shower before he actually looked up.
There were two horses tied to a tree not far from the road, saddled with supplies, their tails flicking lazily, seemingly unperturbed by the building storm.  They were hefty creatures, just like the drug dealer’s horse had been, and they looked like they could handle a harsh winter.
A strange mix of alarm and excitement bloomed in his chest.  Even more than he wanted to see Cas fly –
Until the explosion took out half the lights in the bunker.  He would have run to Cas’ room right away; he would have known
He pushed his hand slowly up Cas' back, carefully feeling along the space between his wings, and when his fingers brushed the base of the left one, Castiel gasped and Dean dipped his tongue inside once, tasting rainwater and clean sea air before pulling back to stare in to Cas' dazed eyes.
Thorygg scratched at his chin.  "Well, the soldiers and I don't know a whole lot about mixing potions and we're nearly out of some basics.  We have a barrel full of ingredients but none of us knows what to do with them."
be struggling with anything.  Now he gets a bomb shell dropped on his head, that Cas actually doesn't know how to handle the fact that he feels
He supposed that was true.  Cas had become such a constant – such a comforting, wonderful constant – in their lives that Dean sometimes forgot that Cas might seem strange and alarming to an outsider.  Especially to two hunters.
Now that he had a plan, now that he had hope of maybe starting this thing with Cas that had been hanging between them for years, now that he finally seemed to have found the courage to do something about it, Dean didn't want to wait till morning.  He was buzzing with giddy anticipation.  He wanted to find Cas
“It's so warm,” Cas nearly purred, mimicking the same pose the man was in and laying his head on his arms.  “I could stay here forever.”
It sat overlookng the city and there was a cascade of short waterfalls on either side of the stone steps leading up to the entrance to the building.  The roar of rushing water was enough to drown out the zealot's preaching and Dean looked up from the dizzying sight of the water rushing past him in the opposite direction, taking in what was easily the largest structure in the city – quite obviously a town hall type deal.  At the top of the many stairs, the Hall sat surrounded by a wall of logs big enough that they had come from fully grown trees, all of which had been carved down to sharp points that were jutting up into the sky.  Leading up to the huge double-doored entrance was a bridge, under which was the spring that was the source of the water running all through the city.  It bubbled up furiously on either side of the bridge, making the water look as if it was boiling.
“A little,” Castiel conceded.  It was true, the memory had stirred some life back into him and left him feeling warm.  It was, in fact, quite nice.
He could no longer fit comfortably into a chair – his wings were much too voluminous – but he had managed to curl them around his shoulders and wedge himself between the armrests.  It’s not like he was going anywhere any time soon anyway.
, Dean thought, something gross and fluffy bouncing around his chest like an infestation of bunnies.
“Did you at least get whatever that was out of your system?”  Dean gruffly demanded, yanking a heavy blanket over Castiel’s legs.
Castiel threw a very mild and likely ineffective glare in his general direction before remembering he’d yet to answer their question.  He only just stopped his hand halfway to his throat, but both the brothers’ noticed it all the same.
The kid looked between the three of them, his eyes rolling in his head like a spooked horse, unwilling to move with the arrow tip still pressed to his cheek, right above the gash in his skin.
to Cas and Hannah about it all.  I ask how they're doing and what they're having trouble with or if they need help.  And the strangest thing happens when you ask people about themselves, they
As he gazed up at it, his insides twisted with the unnatural sight.  It was the storm clouds still moving across the night sky that encouraged Dean to ignor the sickening feeling and process it later.  Frantically, he looked around, trying to find something useful before their light source disappeared again.
Done with cleaning his wings, Cas seemed wholly unconcerned with the stuttering and staring, rubbing at one eye with his fist like a sleepy child while he stared off along the mountain range that the brothers could no longer see.  Behind him, his wings fluffed up dramatically and then shook, rustling and resettling all the feathers, and then folded neatly against his back.
Before them, a squat stone bridge a quarter mile long lead over the mouth of the river and to the city gates.
with distrust written plainly across her face, and Castiel fought the sudden urge to hide, curling his wings around his shoulders.
Castiel looked up at him, lifting his head and resting his chin right on Dean's sternum, blue eyes more clear and awake than was decent at that time of day.
A laugh bubbled up Dean's throat.  “Alright then, I'm calling Cas down.  I have no idea what I'm supposed to bring with us.  Like should we pick up some silver jump suits or something?”
He waded up to his waist, his wings still carefully arced up away from the water, and he was staring contemplatively at a spot just to the right of the waterfall, where there were a clusters of bright yellow flowers growing out of a few little ledges where water likely continuously gathered.
He stood, dislodging Dean’s hand before he could finish wiping all the blood from his skin, and squared his shoulders.  He would not be in this woman’s presence on uneven ground, even if she was weaponless at the moment.
Before he could even think, he surged up with a snarl too deep and too loud to fit in his vessel’s throat.  It rumbled from deep within his true form and he felt his vocal cords tear.
He’d used a spell on Cas that had been created to enslave him.  To turn him in to a killing machine.  Humans had used that spell to rip Cas’ brothers and sisters from heaven and trap them on earth, forcing them to fight in their petty human wars.  Forcing them to slaughter the very creations their Father had ordered them to protect.
