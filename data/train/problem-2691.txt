«Dean, don't make me punch you on your wedding day.» Sam gives him a look, handing him a glass of water. «No one has ever loved you the way he loves you, and yes you are. You are worthy of all that, and so much more. And he knows that. He will do anything for you. So you better get your shit together and go marry him. Hell, I´ve waited twelve years for this day, I'm not gonna let your stupid thoughts ruin this.»
He had almost told him. When they had gone back to purgatory to get the Leviathan Blossom. They had separated, and Dean was running out of time. He couldn’t find his way back to Cas. So he had prayed to him. And he had almost said the words out loud. Never before had he been that close to telling the angel about his feelings. And then he had found his way back to Cas. Dean had been so relieved that he almost screamed the words out loud at him.
Dean looked so peaceful and calm behind the wheel of his car, watching as the world passes by outside the window. Cas can’t help but smile at the light in his eyes, the way he too loves nights like these.
His fingers dance around it, gently caressing the string of light that now becomes more bright as each moment passes. Dean searches out the pair of blue eyes again, still frozen in the place where he first found them. As the light reaches its brightest, Dean takes a careful hold of the strings of Cas’s soul, and tugging it towards him he gently embraces it, pulling it close against his chest.
Over the last years, his feelings had been burning so intensely that sometimes he didn’t know if he’d survive the fire. Recently, his feelings for the angel had become so strong that some days were like torture for Dean, and it had become even harder after Cas had lost his grace, becoming human. But, Dean still kept it all to himself.
Both Dean and Cas notice the smug smile on Sam's face the next day, but them pretending as nothing happened, almost seems to annoy his brother a little bit. Sam probably thought his little mischievous plan would make them finally say something, the annoyance spreading on his face as they act like everything is as it always has been, is so much more fun to watch.
Removing his hand from Cas´s bare skin is met with an almost disappointed look from the angel, but is quickly replaced by a pleased smile as Dean leans closer. But instead of closing the distance between them, Dean pushed them both off the hood of the car, before taking a step back, pulling Cas with him by outstretched arms. As he turns, walking back towards the side of the car, Dean leads his lips back to Cas´s, their warmth burning away the cold of the night. With easy steps, Dean moves towards the impala again, pressing his back against the chevy door, dragging Cas against him. Crashing into his chest, Cas deepens the kiss.
Once Dean had been scolding the angel for watching him sleep, but Dean grew used to Cas peacefully resting beside him as Dean slept. He even wished for it most days. Wished for the feeling of safety he got whenever he woke to feel that presence. He had lost count of how many times Dean had dreamed or imagined a certain angel laying beside him in the bed, on the side of the bed that Dean always left empty, as he slept peacefully. Cas never did though.
Okay, so this fic turned out waaaayy longer than I had planned. First, I was going to write just a short tumblr post, but that turned out to be a one chapter fix it fic... and now I have three more chapters in my drafts and I don't feel like I´m done anytime soon, so I have no idea how long this is going to be, but I am having way to much fun writing this. I think this is my new therapy (that I definitely need after the episode-that-shall-not-be-mentioned).
This chapter turned out a little short, I didn´t plan on including this, but I just had to get 15x20 out of the way... So yeah, that awful hunt was just a bad dream! Everything is okay! Dean, (everyone) is alive! (Cas will of course come back too)
Dean made a little humming noise as he leads his head atop Cas’s continuing to watch the stars as they stood there in silence. A weak breeze picked up as they stood there, making Dean pulling his red and black plaid winter jacket tighter across his chest. He pulls Cas to him, his back resting against Dean's chest, his head on Cas’s shoulder. Quietly, they stand there, holding each other as they watch the stars shine above them.
«The deal... the empty were to come the moment Cas experienced a moment of true happiness.» He can feel his eyes tearing up, so he raises them to the roof, eyes not focused on anything. “´He... He told me. He told me that he loved me. He waited until his last moment to tell me because he didn’t think I loved him. He thought he couldn’t have me. That sonofabitch told me he loved me, and then he left me laying there on the floor. Realizing that
God who was writing everything could never control you two. He never managed to control Castiel after he broke free, and through him, you were free too. You freed him, without knowing it, and he freed you, without seeing it. You
The younger Winchester stares at them with a questioning look when no one elaborates, too caught up in each other. Win a short, “I’m gonna go tell Eileen and Jack” Sam leaves the room again.
“This place is beautiful, Cas. But why are we here in the middle of the night?” He takes his hand in his, leaning against the hood of the car, watching Cas.
It is mostly just the Shadow, as Dean, yelling at Cas. Yelling at him for everything he has ever done wrong. All the awful things he has done. The things Cas regret.
Dean doesn’t even turn to look at them, only moving closer to the black hole in the wall. He stops in front of it, lingering at the edge of the emptiness ahead.
The day they left he had been comfortable in the silence. He’d read more books these past four weeks than he ever had before in his life. He had gone through every book in the six bookshelves in the far corner of the library. And he hadn’t found anything.
“I seriously thought they were married...” Alex has opened her book again, but he can see her unfocused eyes trying to figure it all out.
“I don’t know why... he’s probably going to use him against you, us, somehow.” He lets out a heavy sigh as he watches Jack. His son.
The days alone in the bunker go by slowly, almost too slowly for Dean's liking. The books have given him nothing. The food doesn’t taste the same anymore. His nights are restless. He can’t concentrate on doing anything, he can’t even sit down to re-watch his favorite movies. Not even the alcohol he consumes seems to work. The only light in his days is Miracle, who seems to sense his sadness and tries to cheer him up. But not even Mir can make him forget reality. His head is so far away, his thoughts only on a pair of bright blue eyes. Dean is lost.
«The dungeon.» She only nods as they both turn to sprint down the hallway, not getting there fast enough.
They both hold their breaths as Dean leans down the rest of the way, closing the distance between their lips. Cas didn’t know it could feel like this. A simple touch of the lips on some else’s. It’s nothing like hands touching. Nothing like an embrace. He’s thought about kissing Dean countless times, but actually getting to kiss him...
Cas, they loved each other in the details, while they shielded themself from anything that could harm them. Shielded their feelings, because their feelings could make them vulnerable. Not that the hunters in the bunker would ever do something to hurt them, but they were people who they’d only known for a short time. People that didn’t know their story, a new element in their lives that they still hadn’t learned fully.
«It's not really the best kept secret, you know. The fallen angel who fell in love with the faithless, but righteous man.» Jack smiles sadly at Dean. «He never did say anything, to anyone. But it was there. It was always there. You try to hide it too, but none of you are subtle when it comes to each other.»
Mathilda and Taylor would get their separate room, and the couples Leo and Xand, Severin and Alex, would get one of the bigger rooms. It wasn’t really a question about space, because if there was one thing they had in the bunker, it was space. They could probably fit twenty more hunters, even if they all wanted separate rooms, as there was a whole wing of the bunker the Winchester had never used, barley stepping a foot in there. It only needed some cleaning, some more furniture, and whatever decorations and renovations the new residents wanted to make a home.
The thought scares the crap out of Dean, because with it, he realizes how much his brother sees. Not just what’s going on in front of him. But everything, Sam sees everything. Which makes his request too real. And he gets it. Dean and Sam lost Cas, but Sam is slowly loosing his brother too. The realization makes Dean speak with more honesty than he has in a long time.
Their foreheads rested against each other, Cas’s hand cupping Dean's face, gently stroking those beautiful freckles.
A hand rested in the other's lap. A head rested on a shoulder. Foot rested across a lap. Arm rested around a shoulder. A head rested in the crock of the neck. Hands intertwined. A thumb gently stroking the back of a hand. Feet tangled together on the couch.
Sam comes running into the room, and a moment later, a fluffy and cheerful dog comes running in. It crosses the room towards them but stops short at the sight of Cas. Curious eyes studying him and Dean.
Walking up to the room, Dean is wondering if his brother has finally given up, or what he’s done this time. Opening the door, Cas laughs as he turns back to Dean, opening the door wider so he can step past him. As Cas closes the door behind him, Dean looks at his brother with almost angry eyes.
The last thing Dean expected was to be nervous, but standing in front of his brother as he fixes Dean's blue tie, he can feel his hands shaking. Sam and Charlie refused to let Dean and Cas see each other all day, and for some reason that makes Dean even more nervous.
Dean, the one who hated early mornings, was the first to wake, and after taking a shower he left the motel to get breakfast. When he returned he was met by a tired, but smiling Cas sitting up in the bed.
«Ehm… what do you mean? We’re good. Why?» It probably wasn’t hard to see that there was something more between Cas and Dean. And after his brother, and Jack had told him how he and Cas acted around each other, he had started paying attention to it himself. And holy hell... how had Cas not seen it on Dean, and how had Dean not seen it on Cas?
The silence takes a stronghold of the day, and although the world continues on with their lives, the remaining Winchester’s spend the day with silent tears. Silent words.
Stopping in front of the closed door, he draws a shaky breath as he slowly opens the bedroom-door. A sleeping figure is sprawled across the bed, half covered in a blanket. Dean sleeps heavily in his double-sized bed. At the sight of his brother, Sam lets out a relieved breath closing his eyes, leaning his forehead against the bed.
If the situation had been different, Sam would have yelled at his brother for making such a mess of the library. Books are everywhere. On the floor. On the tables. On the chairs. Some opened. Some closed. Some has fallen out from the shelf. Some thrown across the room.
The Shadow also tells Cas how much he hates him. It stings, hearing those words from someone that looks so much like Dean. It tells Cas that he isn’t loved. Or wanted. It hurts.
As he opens his eyes, Cas places both of his hands firmly on Dean's chest. And pushes him away. Except, this time, Dean holds firmly on to Cas and they both stumble to the ground. Or what would be a ground, if there were such things in the Empty.
, like that. I’ve barely even seen anyone grieve their wife, or husband, like that. So no, Dean. You´ve never managed to hide how you feel towards Cas. And he never managed to hide how he feels about you either.»
“I never thought I’d ever be brave enough to tell you.” The wind rustles the threes at the side of the road, sending a chill down Cas’s back as it reaches them. He’s not sure if it’s the wind or Dean that makes him shiver, but he welcomes it anyway.
«I love you.» It´s only a whisper on his breath, and Dean isn’t even sure he actually said them out loud before he locks eyes with Cas, finding his blue eyes shining with tears.
Dean grabs the front of his shirt, pulling him in for a sweet kiss before he turns around and walks into the bathroom, turning on the sink. A moment later he walks out of the bathroom with a pretty big glass of water and crosses the room to stand over his brother. Cas has already changed out of his clothes sitting on the bed waiting for him. Dean looks back at Cas and winks at him before he turns again and throws the water in Sam's face.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read / commented / left kudoss so far! :) I really appreciate it!<3
«I can’t sleep.» Cas´s whisper is soft against the darkness of the hallway, his bright eyes the only light Dean can see.
“I think... I know, that I want to stay with you. I want to be with you. Live with you. Love you. I want to grow old with you. I want you, so I’m not going anywhere either, without you.” Cas’s word is only a quiet whisper against his lips, but they heal Dean's soul and heart in a way he didn’t think possible.
. His brother loved it, and although Dean wasn’t much of a reader, he had to admit that just the presence of so many old books, was calming. Peaceful. Soothing.
, you will be loved until your dying breath, and even after that, you two will find your way back to each other. Love each other.»
Days later, the clearing where Dean and Cas had made their home, is filled with friends and family, both hunters and a few supernatural creatures. They gather to say goodbye one last time, as the flames raises high in the sky. The silence and the darkness of night lit up by both the flames and the lanterns each hunter is carrying.
As he reads his vows, tears stream down Dean´s face, and they are joined by even more as Cas reads his. The world around them is so quiet, so peaceful that Dean isn’t sure if its even real.
«I… I was just thinking about our life. About our home.» Sill watching the road ahead of him, he turns his head slightly, so that Eileen can watch him.
«I´ll meet you there, then.» He leans down to kiss him, but before he can seal their lips together, there’s a hard knock on the bedroom door behind them.
Breaking each other down to the last dusted grain of their bodies, they rebuild one another breath by breath, kiss by kiss, touch by touch. Their souls ripped opened and spilled all over them, before merging as one as their breaths, kisses, touches heal the broken pieces. Their souls both healed, seen, loved, by the other.
Drawing in a sharp breath, and as he opened the door, his green eyes searched out a pair of blue ones.
They all knew there was something between the two, but no one asked them or said anything, and as long as they hadn’t announced anything, they would keep it to themselves. Right after the new hunters had moved in, when some of them were in one of the smaller libraries, one of them had asked Sam about them. But only that one time. They seemed to understand how the two were very private.
“Yeah. You sure you okay?” Sam's eyes linger on Dean's face, before moving to study Cas. And then to their hands resting on Dean's chest. Dean doesn't answer him, he doesn't need to, his brother only needs to look at their intertwined hands, and see the calm in Dean's eyes, to have his answer. “Eileen is making dinner, so if you two want to join us, it should be ready in about an hour.”
“I’ve never seen anything like that. Anything that beautiful. You’re beautiful, Castiel. I love you.” Seeing the tears escaping his eyes, Dean leans closer, brushing his lips gently against Cas’s. Smiling, Cas chases his lips in a sweet kiss, his hand gripping Dean tighter.
He had almost told him. Dean had almost told Cas that he loved him, more than once. But in the end, he hadn’t. He wishes he had.
“Oh, it’s...” Dean turns to face Cas, pulling the glass ball from the chain and holding it up to Cas. “I had to remove your grace to be able to bring us back. I left only a small grain so that I was sure you would make it. But it’s all in here.”
«I feel wonderful» he answers his brother, but his face, his eyes, his whole body, tells a different story. And Dean knows Sam sees right through the mask he doesn’t even bother to make an effort on.
Cas and Dean would stay up later than the others. Usually, the last in the bunker to turn off the lights. The new hunters had chosen bedrooms at the other wing, and Sam and Eileen´s room was further down the hall, so the nights staying up late, the comfortable silence rested over them.
«Well, duh. But she’s a part of me, part of my heart. So she’s kinda yours too...» He smiles softly at the man beside him.
«You might have lost Cas, but I lost both of you. I barely recognized you, I couldn’t find you after he died. You were so lost in your grief that I was seriously afraid I was going to lose you too, lose you even more than I already had.» Dean looks back to his brother, not knowing what to answer him. «I´ve never seen anyone grieve their
“I... I don’t really know how to say this and I suck at talking about feelings and stuff, but I kinda wanna tell you. Sooner rather than later.”
«I think maybe, the love between the two of you, is such a huge part of you that you don’t recognize it for what it really is. Not even God could come between you. The God who was writing everything could never control you two. He never managed to control Castiel after he broke free, and through him, you were free too. You freed him, without knowing it, and he freed you, without seeing it. You were, the two of you, you simply were. Everyone else was tied to strings, but the two of you were only tied to each other.»
The room is not huge, but the two beds are bigger than the ones they are used to, but there is still only one empty bed as Dean and Cas arrives after having eaten dinner. Sam, as always had left first, right after having finished his salad.
He wants to fall asleep like this, forever. Falling asleep to the steady rhythm of a heart beating, a sound so beautiful in a silence so beautiful. His head resting against Cas´s bare chest, resting against his heart, Dean can hear his heartbeats.
“Well, this one is new.” Cas almost sounds amused as he stands and walks to his side. The Shadow laughs at that.
«Heya, Jack. You there kid?» Dean lowers his head as tears stings his eyes. Every night, he would pray to Cas. Each night so filled with hope that the disappointment of always being left feeling more empty, still took him by surprise. He would pray to Jack too, not every night like with Cas, but he found more comfort in talking to Jack these days. «I know you are busy, and I know you would have helped if you knew how to. But… if… if there is anything,
Although the rain keeps pouring down all day, making it a slow but quiet day on the road. They don’t talk much while driving, just enjoying each other's company. Eileen enjoys watching the world go by outside the windows, almost getting lost between the trees of the big forest they keep passing through. Sam tries to keep up the good mood from this morning, but worry for his brother keeps distracting him. Eileen, of course, catches up on it right away but says nothing until they stop at a diner for dinner.
The story of a man afraid of flying, and an angel afraid of falling, who somehow met in the middle. They stayed together despite fate, despite what they are, because they refused to be pulled apart.
«I know what you are doing, Sammy.» With that, Dean throws the glass into Sam's hands before he throws away his shirt and pants, joining Cas on the small bed. The bed is not made for two grown men to sleep in together, but neither of them cares, they don’t need much space anyway as they always sleep as close together as possible. With his back turned towards his brother, Dean looks over his shoulder, smiling at Sam. «There's a dry bed available. Good thing you got a room with three beds this time, bitch.»
“Yeah. Dean and Cas... Well, let’s just say that the both of them are so emotionally constipated and blind that they have been pining after each other for like twelve years.”
Closing the book in front of him, Dean looks around at the empty and quiet library. It’s been a day since Jack came to visit him, and he is just about to give up for the day, having found nothing. Then he hears the sound of a book falling to the floor. Mir jumps from her place by Dean's feet, head turning to stare at the source of the sound. Dean looks to the bookshelf he had half-emptied today but there is no sign of a fallen book anywhere. Walking over to the shelf, he finds a small and black leather-bound book hidden behind the self. Dean picks it up and just stares at it, turning it over. It’s just a small insignificant old notebook. At least until he removes the thread holding it together.
«It's not something you can borrow. It's something you do. Just like everything you do, you do for the love of your people.» The words stab Dean in the chest like an invisible knife. He flinches at the words that sound so much like the words he keeps repeating in his mind. He tries to hide it, but Jack notices, which evokes a deep and concerned look on their face. «What is it, Dean? Did I do something, or say something?»
Standing in the middle of the dark hallway, Cas’s body goes still as he leans against the wall. He can feel his face falling from a bright smiling expression to a sad one.
He tosses and turns, restless, wide awake, dead tired. He knows what is bugging him but he doesn’t know if he dares to do anything with it. After an hour of just staring at the darkness, he can’t stand it anymore, so he rises from his bed and heads down the hallway. He stands outside the door, not knowing what to do, for a long time.
Miracle comes running down the hall at the sound of Dean´s sleepy voice. Sam reaches down to scratch his head and places a kiss at the top of his head before slightly opening the bedroom door again. Miracle slips through it and Sam can hear him jumping onto the bed. As Sam turns to head to the bathroom he hears Dean laughing quietly in his room. The bunker is peacefully quiet.
A spark of electricity inside Cas matches the spark in his eyes as he leans into the kiss. Neither of them notices when the lamp beside their closet flicker two times as the small grain of grace acts on its own, Cas too lost in their kiss to notice.
With a quick shower, Sam leaves Eileen in the bathroom, heading towards the kitchen. His stomach already starting to scream for food. However, the sight he meets when he walks into the kitchen silences it and he almost forgets why he’s there in the first place. That how surprised he is when he sees his brother. Awake. Dressed. Drinking coffee. Smiling, early in the morning.
«I meant it when I said I wanted to grow old with you, Dean. We’ve known each other for so many years now, and I have loved you for every single one of them. This…» Cas points between them, before he takes a step closer to Dean, tucking the glass ball back underneath Dean's hoodie, hidden from sight, «may be new, for both of us, but my love for you is not. I want to live too, to grow old. To stay
I was not planning on this being this long, but as I started writing I just felt like writing more... I don't know how long it will be, but writing this has really helped me lately. I´ve been having a rough time lately, so I´ve lost myself in reading and writing, although even that has been hard. I´ve got two more chapters saved in my drafts, but like with this one I´m not happy with them, but at the moments I´m happy to just be writing... I hope reading this can be of help to someone else who is still in denial after the finale, or someone who just needs to get lost in fanfic, like me.
Then Dean is kissing him again, seeming to suddenly be addicted to the other man's lips. Not able to get enough of his sweet and gentle touches.
«That’s great!» Dean, having eaten his bacon, raises to clean the table. «I think I’m gonna go work on baby and maybe go for a drive later when she’s ready. Of course, I’m gonna bring you too Mir, you know I won’t leave you,» he finishes as the dog playfully runs through his feet on the way to the counter.
The impala goes quiet as they stop in front of the old barn. They have to find the missing boys before anything happens to them. That’s what they do, saving people. The Winchesters finding the monsters that other people only hear about in stories, but that is very very real for them. Hunting things.
“How... how long was I gone?” Dean turns to his brother. Pulling the chain over his head again, the glass ball resting against his chest.
quietly to each other, he has to smile too. Although not interested in how they spend their nights, he’s still happy for his brother. Happy for them both, his brother and his best friends.
For years and years, Cas had believed his feelings to be his, and his alone. He knew Dean cared about him, but he never dared to think that he might feel the same way. Cas had believed that Dean loved him as a brother, and nothing more. He didn’t believe he could love a creature like Cas, a being like him. So he had never said a word. Never acted upon it. Although at times, that was all he had wanted to do. But he never did.
«I´ll see you tonight, sleepyhead.» Turning around in between Dean's arms, Cas smiles up at him as he gently lays a hand against Dean's neck.
«Better than ever before.» He smiles as he closes his eyes, resting his forehead against Cas’s temple. «You?»
Together they set fire to each other as their touches burns along their skin, their lips intensifying the flames, hands trailing all over to savor the fire. Having tasted his touches, kisses, Dean will never be the same, and he will never want to be someone who hasn’t been set on fire by the angel.
After Sam had closed the door, and Miracle had taken his place by Dean side in the bed, he laid there in the dark of his bedroom, staring at the empty side of his bed, and at the chair that sat in the corner.
Sam wakes the next morning to the sound of rain, the room cooler than it was the night before. With a small shiver, he pulls Eileen closer, hugging her closer to his chest. A small and tired «morning» escapes her lips and all he can do is smile brightly at her as he kisses her forehead. Neither of them really wants to get up, both wanting to just stay like this for as long as possible.
When he couldn’t breathe anymore, Dean pulled away, only to bury his head against his neck. He hugged him so close, so tight, that Cas stumbled another step backward, crashing into the wall behind him. Dean didn’t care if they’d fell down the stairs.
As the Shadow throws them out of the void, Dean and Cas are thrown away from each other as they crash to the floor of the bunker. They land almost on the exact spot where Cas stood as he was taken by the empty. The room is shaking as if an earthquake had hit the bunker, but it quickly dies down as the black hole in the wall closes up, leaving nothing.
There aren’t enough freckles under his left eye. The ones on his right cheek, just above his jaw is too light.
for it. And now it is all his. When Cas notices how Dean's eyes have teared up, he leans close and kisses him gently.
Their kiss is like the answer to a question they’ve both been asking all their life. It’s a lifeline in a cruel world.
Laying down in bed, they hold around each other, no space left between them. Dean thought he knew what happiness was. But nothing has ever been able to even compare to what he feels in this moment. This happiness. This joy. This safety. This love.
«I don't really know anything, but I do know that I… I love you, Cas. And I’ve been holding back those words. Those feelings. For so long. But I don’t want to anymore. I want you. I want us. And we´ll just make it up as we go. Figure it out. Figure us out.» Taking a step closer, Dean places his hand against Cas´s face, the other flat against his chest. «Neither of us knows how this is supposed to go, but we’ll figure it out together. Maybe I even snore so badly that you want your own room, I don’t know?»
Half an hour later, Miracle follows him closely as Dean walks into the kitchen, smiling at the smell of bacon filling the room. His brother is already seated at the table, waiting for him. At the sight of Dean and Miracle, Sam smiles before pouring a cup of coffee and placing it by Dean´s seat. Then he places a plate of food by his feet and Miracle happily leaps across the floor to devour the food.
«Dean! What the hell are you doing here?!» Charlie comes up behind Sam, staring at Dean with the same look his brother is giving him.
Dean is back with breakfast and a cup of coffee before Cas and Sam wake, Cas´s smile growing wider each morning as Dean hands him a cup of coffee.
“Please don’t ask. You don’t wanna know.” At Sam's words, she looks between the two smiling men sitting across the table. She seems to catch up way faster than Sam and shakes her head at them as she smiles.
The Empty is just as horrible as it sounds. It takes a few moments before Dean adjusts to this place, but all the while, his mind and body is screaming for him to get out of here. This is not a place for a human.
For Castiel, the world was created for him to meet Dean. Everything that has happened has led him into the arms of the only being Cas has ever truly loved. He would give anything for the man, he
Moving towards the light he feels a calm settle over him that he has never felt before. The light moves around him, settling around him. The bright light is tied with feelings of peace and love. Feelings surrounding him in the form of invisible threads and strings of light.
. However, sometimes the happiness in their eyes was the only indication that anything had changed between them. The kissing was new, the giggling, tight embraces, cuddling. But... they were so
Sam and Eileen have already headed for the kitchen to get some food for them. Jack follows Dean and Cas, and after making sure they are both alright, having studied them both inside and out to make sure. When they are happy with Dean and Cas being alright, Jack tells them about the things he has to go take care of. Cas suspects they’ll close of any entry to the void, so that the Shadow has no way of reaching them, no matter what. Cas says nothing, only smiles exhausted as Jack hugs him once more. Jack had been in the bunker for a few days, so there were other things to take care of too, as the new and improved ‘God’ they’re responsible for a lot. But Jack promises they’d be back as soon as they could.
He almost does lean in but stops himself when Cas, still asleep, gently moves his hand from Dean's hips so that it rests on his waist.
«To be honest, I don’t really know the rules myself… But, I think, maybe we should stop doing what we’ve been doing all these years. Instead of hiding everything, hiding how we feel, we should talk about it. Figure it out.»
He doesn’t open his eyes at first, even when he feels a new presence in the room. Only when Miracle darts across the floor towards the one now standing in the doorway. When a happy bark from the dog makes Dean open his eyes and turning his head, a tear has already dried up on its way down Dean´s face.
And although they might not have spoken the words, they both know the other loves them so fiercely that nothing will ever be able to put out this fire that they keep feeding with every breath, touch, kiss.
The alarm on the nightstand goes off as the clock ticks to 08:00. A deep growl comes from the sleepy figure, as Dean slams his hand down on the alarm clock and a head appears from underneath the blankets. Still half asleep, Dean lifts his head and looks at his brother.
, Dean heads for the bathroom to wash his face and change his clothes, Cas is still sleeping when Dean returns, so Dean heads for the lounge chair that Cas always claims. He doesn’t mean to fall asleep right away, but he’s out like a light the moment he leans back, feet outstretched and resting on the bed.
His hands keep turning pages of books, his eyes keep searching the words, but not his mind. His mind is on the many memories of the past twelve years, that he never thought he would need to hold on to, to be able to continue on. The memories of all the years he spent in hell, were blurry and distant in his mind. What he remembered were those eyes. And then the voice that spoke to him.
«The night the Empty took him…» his throat closes up, making even breathing hard. Clenching his fists on the table he closes his eyes, about to try again, but Jack interrupts him.
Over his coffee, Dean grins at his brother. Cas has moved to the fridge, taking out the leftovers from last night's dinner that they never showed up to. Sitting down close to Dean they share the plate. A grin is spreading on Cas’s lips too. It’s
Together in every way possible. No force in the universe is able to separate them ever again. Not once their body is given to the other, souls merging together, never able to be apart again.
Dean sleeps peacefully beside him, his naked body only covered by a thin blanket, and Cas´s arms around him. Eyes fluttering beneath his closed eyelids, mouth slightly open as he breathes calmly.
«I do.» Never taking his eyes off of Dean, Cas´s eyes are filled with tears, which finally escapes when it's his turn to say the words. The ring fits perfectly.
Castiel usually spent his days in the bunker helping the others, or Sam. He’d been working on translating a section of books in Enochian, and some others that were written in such old languages that it was impossible for anyone else to translate. He seemed to really enjoy it, the reading and the writing. Some days he would disappear from the bunker for hours. He’d told Sam that he enjoyed the peace he found in nature, so he was often drawn to the forests close to the mountains.
«So… how are things between you and Cas?» Sam asked from across the room, not looking up from the books he was sorting through.
Stretching his neck to give the other better access, his own hand moves to his black hair, while the other lightly scratch at Cas´s back. Beneath his fingers he can feel the chill it sends through his body, but Cas keeps kissing his neck, not letting go of Dean. Slowly he pushes Dean forward so he’s laying with his back against the hood of his car. Only held up by the welcoming force of Cas´s body atop his. His hand no longer at the back of his head, but moving down down down, slipping under his shirt where cold fingers find warm skin, its Deans turn to shiver at the touch. Unable to do anything as he feels his whole body reacting to the touches, Dean closes his eyes, breathing heavily.
Once again, the motel room only had one empty bed when Dean and Cas arrived only half an hour later, finding a sleeping Sam in one of the two beds.
Looking around the room, he can see that someone has turned off all the lights. The two lamps, one on each side of his bed, had been dimly lit when he fell asleep. The light in the hallway has also been turned off. And the food on his desk is long gone, not even his half-empty class has been left on his desk. Most likely Sam who had come to look for them, finding them both asleep.
Sometimes the tug is stronger. Sometimes the tug is only a faint feeling. Sometimes it disappears completely.
«Definitely. If not we’ll find another place.» He smiles at his best friend, taking in his beautiful face as his blue eyes search the town in front of them. He’s still staring when Cas turns his head towards him, meeting his eyes. Dean can feel his face turn slightly red as he was caught staring. Again.
The other name is the only word remembered in the back of the car. Their bodies the only world worth living for. The other's eyes the only night sky visible, the only universe that matters.
Dean hid those feelings as if his life depended on them never being seen. Now, he wishes he hadn’t done that. He wishes he had taken that road instead. Wishing he had dared to turn onto the road that scared him more than anything.
No more words are spoken, as Dean pulls Cas with him into his bedroom. As they get close to the bed, Miracle jumps up, before taking his place at the foot-end of the bed. More kisses are given, more freckles painted on his smiling face.
inside the car, though we were too busy to drive…” He says as he hands the fork back to Cas. Winking at him as he watches Cas take a bite of the creamy pasta salad Eileen made yesterday. As always, his eyes are glued to Cas. So there it was, so clearly visible. Those small gestures. The looks. The way they loved. “The backseat is pretty comfortable if you share it with the right person.”
Slamming shut his book in frustration and anger Dean gives a heavy sigh as he leans back in his chair, his eyes wandering over the shelves on the wall. This was going to take forever to figure out. But he would figure it out, even if it would take years. The thought makes him feel helpless and hopeless. How was Dean supposed to survive that long without him.
. But they never did. Dean couldn’t stand it anymore, the silence in the library. The weight on his shoulders pressing him down. The knowledge of how this was all his fault and he couldn’t do anything about it.
Sam had known Dean before Cas, Dean without Cas, so he could see the protectiveness in them both. The way they loved each other from afar, and he found it strange that they didn’t show it more now that they finally could, knowing the other would answer. He’d thought that when they finally got together, they wouldn’t be afraid to show everyone that they loved each other. Eileen had said that the way she saw it, as someone who had only known Dean
He let himself watch Cas for a few moments longer before raising from the bed. A new day on the road waited.
Cas smiles up at him, watching how his green eyes shine in the dark, a smile spread wide across his face.
“Cas, you’ve always had me. You’re the only one who has ever truly had me. The only one that got me in every way possible. And I don’t want it any other way. I want you, and only you. I don’t know what you want to do with your life now that we are all free to actually live, but if you’ll have me, I’ll follow you wherever you go. And I know it's selfish of me to beg this of you, but please don´t leave me, stay with me forever. Don't leave me ever again." Dean pauses for a moment, breathless from his own words, the rawness of them. "I love you, Cas."
Sam knew what Dean's answer would be, but he asked him anyways, each time Sam were to go hunting. He respected that he didn’t want to hurt anymore, but he knew Dean appreciates being asked. Cas and Eileen seem to have moved on to another subject, already deep in conversation across the table. Sam tries to catch up with some of what they are signing but they move their fingers so fast, probably talking about a subject Sam isn’t able to make out, so he quickly gives up, not ready for
Unfortunately, no one really gets what they wish for deep in their hearts. Their silence is broken by quick footsteps in the hallway coming towards them. Cas starts to pull away from the embrace, but Dean only holds him tighter.
All of it, was worth it, just to be able to lay in bed next to Dean, watching him as peaceful as ever, sleeping with his head resting on Cas´s chest. He’d do it all a thousand times, just to be able to lay here at this moment, counting the freckles on his face, waiting for him to open his green eyes so that Cas once again can look into the greatest wonder ever created in the whole universe. Nothing is as beautiful as those freckles. Nothing is as beautiful as those green eyes.
Somehow, all their clothes quickly find new resting places somewhere in the car. Lips moving against each other, never leaving the other for longer than a short moment. Hands trailing all over, leaving hot streams of fire wherever they touch. Skin to skin they set fire to themselves, moving against each other as one. Moving together as if this was what they were made to do. This was their purpose.
“Dean...” Cas’s voice is weak as he rests his head against Dean's shoulder, his forehead fitting perfectly against the crook of Dean's neck.
«When... Before the empty took Cas.» Dean started, sitting at the edge of the desk behind him, his hands nervously shaking. «When Bille trapped us, he... Cas had made a deal with the empty to save Jack, and when we were trapped there, he summoned the empty.»
And then Cas opens the door, almost crashing into Dean as he’s about to walk through the door. Wide-eyed they look at each other, not saying a word for a long moment.
«You’re gonna kill me Cas,» Dean says between heavy breaths, not sure if the dizziness is from lack of air, or because of the man half laying on top of him. «But please don’t stop.»
«Hello, husband.» Cas smiles into the kiss, eyes meeting Dean´s he can see through his tears that the blue is also blurred by tears.
«I love you.» He says kissing him between each time he says the words, making Cas smile so wide he lights up the dark that the exploded lamp above them left. «I love you. I love you. I love you.»
Sam and Eileen's two daughters, arrive at their parent's house hours later to mourn their two uncles. Claire and Kaia join them just moments later. Jack and Claire sharing a long hug, staying close together the whole day, the embraces speaking the words they cannot say.
«Ehm, sorry, I… I was just coming to tell you, breakfasts ready in twenty minutes.» Sam half-smiles as he turns to close the door. Relief filling his body as he realizes it was just a bad dream.
«Cas!» Dean comes running towards him. Embracing him when he gets close enough. For a moment Cas leans into the embrace, imagining for a moment that it´s
Dean has seen beauty before. Seen the world showing off its best side. But, standing there, atop the cliff together with Cas, Dean cannot think of anything more beautiful than Cas standing beneath the stars, leaning against Dean. His lips warm against his face, moving from his jaw, his cheeks, his neck before they once more find Dean's lips.
“What about you Sammy?” Dean looks over at his brother, waiting for an answer. Sam looks between Dean and Cas for a moment before shaking his head.
He thought he had known happiness and joy before, but the way he felt when Dean told him that he wasn’t alone with those feelings, was something that Cas didn’t even know how to name. Never had he felt such love. A love he had felt every day since.
It doesn’t last long, but it doesn’t have to, because now they both know. Dean reluctantly pulls away from Cas´s lips, their noses gently stroking against each other. Dean rests his head in the crook of Cas’s neck, the former angel holding him all through the night.
Dean finally gives up on trying to hold back his tears, letting them stream down his face as a river finally breaking free of the dam that has been holding them back for so long. Clear tears bleeding from his eyes.
“Jody... do you remember that thing I told you about?” A screeching sound came from inside as Dean opened or closed one of the steel cabinets. “Yeah. That.”
They could have had so much time together, but in the end, Dean didn’t even tell Cas that he loved him too. And Cas died thinking that Dean didn’t love him back. Of course, he loved him.
Dean turns to Cas again, grabbing his face and pulling him close so that he can kiss him. His lips screaming for Cas´s all day long. Backing into the empty bedroom, Dean pulls Cas with him. He kicks the door shut as he throws away his jacked, shirt thrown somewhere soon after. Still kissing him, Dean pushes Cas towards the bed as he starts undressing him. It doesn’t take long before all their clothes have disappeared leaving nothing but hot and electrified air between their two bodies.
Dean doesn’t know why he even bothered with bringing the stupid car here since Cas didn’t care enough to fix it. But Dean had still brought it home. He hasn’t touched it since he parked it there, but now he almost wants to start fixing it up again, just to be able to have something to do, something that still felt like Cas. That’s probably why he had it here, to have something of Cas’s. It’s stupid really, but now he’s glad he did. It almost makes him smile as he leaves the impala.
“I might have... well I didn’t mean to, but I heard you talking to Jody on the phone the other day and...”
«Besides, you’re pretty cute together.» His smile turns into a teasing one, trying to lighten the mood.
It doesn’t take long, only a few heartbeats, not even a minute, passes, before he can hear quiet and light footsteps coming closer. When the silence once more takes hold Dean's smile widens as he stands up. A gentle and warm hand touches him, knitting their fingers together. Dean turns towards his husband, his face as young as when they first met, moving closer to him they melt against each other.
Dean stretches his neck towards Cas, his lips hovering over Cas’s, teasingly. But he never closes the distance between them. Instead, he leans towards Cas’s neck, placing a gentle kiss on the middle of his neck. The one place where Cas gets lost each time Dean kisses him. Dean's lips linger on his scar, making Cas go weak on his knees, a chill going through his whole body. When Dean kissed him there, Cas could feel that little drop of grace left in his body, spark more intensely than usual. One night, when Cas asked him, Dean had whispered in his ear, his fingers gently running over the scar, how kissing him there made him feel like he was kissing his grace, the closest he would come to Cas in his true form, one he could never see. Never see, but feel, when his lips lingered there. Cas had been left speechless for a long moment after his words. And each time his lips found their way to that scar, Cas couldn’t help but feel like he was flying. Levitating. Dissolving.
«I was thinking about maybe taking a nap, and then later after my nap I was thinking about taking a nap, and then maybe a nap after that» he grins at his brother as he raises from the chair.
. Just exist. Just live. So they had cleaned the room, set up a huge cornered-couch against one wall, and a large flat-screen television against the opposite wall. They’d brought in two cozy armchairs in the far corner, with some small bookshelves decorating the wall behind them. It felt like home in here. Like a home where people lived. They had finally made a home.
“No wonder every single being I’ve met has cured the Winchesters. You make all our existence so difficult with all your ‘being a hero’ stupidity. The Winchesters should have been destroyed before they even existed.” Oh, yes. The Shadow is real pissed off now, Dean thinks as he smiles down at Cas.
but watching Cas like this… he has never seen anything cuter. «You sure as hell know how to take a man stargazing.»
Crashing into him with his whole body, lips crashed against his own, Cas stumbled backward at the weight of Dean´s body pressing against him. His whole being frozen in surprise. But only for a second.
Pushing against him, Dean moves them both from where they stand, leading Cas against the rearmost chevy door. Dancing around each other, Cas opens the door, before pushing them both inside, laying Dean underneath him in the back seat. His eyes seem to glow in the dark, the blue of his irises lit up by sparks of electricity coming from inside him. Unbuttoning each other's jackets, the November chill is long forgotten, their flannel jackets are thrown over the seat, landing somewhere out of sight as they move together.
Dean answers Cas´s sweet laughs with kisses behind his right ear. Dean had pretty quickly found that small area to be Cas´s most sensitive spot, and he absolutely exploited that tiny bit of information to the fullest. The small and quiet giggles escaping him as he melts against him gives Dean the upper hand. Standing up, still in Cas´s arms, he turns them around so that Dean has him trapped this time.
«Hey, kid.» Dean walks over to them and as Jack stands back up, Dean embraces them. Pulling Jack close and holding them for a long moment. When he pulls away he smiles sadly down at the kid, ruffling their hair. «You have nothing to apologize to. If anyone should apologize, it's me. I know I haven’t been good to you lately, and I really am sorry for all of it. No, don’t try apologizing for me… I know we were just creatures in a sick play, written by God, but I can’t blame Chuck for everything.»
I like to imagine that something like this is what really happened after they defeated Chuck and got everyone back. Sam wanted to keep hunting, and he wanted to create some kind of community, or network, like this, for hunters. Eileen would of course be by his side, kicking ass and training future generations of hunters. They would be amazing together, establishing something like this.
“I really like this person, and I just... don’t know what to do.” Again there are screeching noises coming from the room as Dean moves the shelves, most likely is looking for something. “I... I can’t tell you, but yes, it’s someone you know... that’s all I’m going to say, you’ll probably figure it out anyway.”
“It’s a good deal. You let one angel go, and we let you go back to sleep. Never to bother you again.” Dean keeps an eye at the Shadow as it keeps walking around him, slow steps. He looks down at the angel in his lap, gently stroking his hand through the black hair.
Cas seems to be speechless as Dean leans in for a quick kiss. As he sits back against the passenger seat again, he watches Cas fondly as he starts the car, pulling her towards the road.
No words are spoken. No words are needed. They both know the name, but they won’t force the words before they slip out themselves. Their touches and kisses spell it out for them instead.
«Do you ever knock?» Quickly, Dean reaches to pull the blanket over them, as it was only half-covering their naked bodies. Beside him, a confused and still half-asleep Cas lifts his head from Dean's chest, looking annoyingly around for the source that abruptly disturbed their peaceful sleep.
, that Sam sometimes almost forgot that they had finally gotten together. They’d always been close, inseparable. The looks were the same, a longing for the other shining brightly. The way they seemed to always be touching somehow, or at least be so close that they could touch. The way they always seemed more alive when in the presence of the other.
«Do you… do you want this back?» Dean whispers as he holds it up, the little glass ball glowing faintly in his hand. He looks at Cas carefully, suddenly almost nervous.
Cas sat beside him on the couch, not close enough that they were touching, but not too far away either. Dean could feel Cas’s presence at his left side as if they were. He only had to reach out his hand towards Cas to touch him.
“Oh God, guys, please... I haven’t even had my coffee yet.” Standing with his back against them, Sam can still hear it when Dean leans over to give Cas a big and noisy kiss. When Sam hears them both
Low music is filling the car with a peaceful silence between Cas and Dean as they head down the road. They haven’t talked much, so Cas has mostly been lost in his own thoughts. Only when they stop to get gas and something to eat, does Cas return to reality, but his thoughts still half distract him.
When he opens his eyes again, he can see that, like himself, Cas has not been able to hold back the tears. He brushes his thumb across his cheek to dry away his tears, and smiles as Cas does the same to Dean's tears.
Cas could not see his soul. And his eyes. They weren’t right. The Shadow never managed to get his eyes right. They were slightly the wrong shade of green. He never managed to get the pattern of freckles right either. Cas knew the pattern better than he knew his own name. So the eyes and the freckles always revealed it to be the Shadow.
A smile cracks uncontrollably across Dean's face the moment he meets the angel's eyes. He might no longer have his grace, technically making him human and not an angel. But to Dean, he would always be an angel. Cas had always been, and would always be an angel in Dean's eyes. And now, he was
«It was the only clean one I could find after I showered earlier.» He smiles as he meets Dean in the middle of the hallway. «And I was too lazy to do laundry… Since you were still at work I figured you wouldn’t have any use for it at the time, besides you don’t seem to mind when I borrow them.»
I feel like this (or something similar) is what should have happened. After everything Dean and Cas and Sam have been through, they all deserved to live the life they wanted. Dean wanted to quit hunting, and Sam wanted to be of help to other hunters. Cas and Eileen would of course stand by their sides for whatever they chose to do with their lives. It should have been their choice.
«I think that would be nice,» he gives his brother a tired smile, but this time his smile actually reaches his eyes too. «I know you have wanted to organize and help hunters for a long time, and I think you and Eileen will do a great job with ´em.» Sam smiles at that.
The first day all alone in the bunker consisted of the same procedure as yesterday. Wake up. Breakfast. Research. Dinner. Research. Sleep.
“You see the thing is... Recently I’ve... Well, there’s someone I... I sort of like someone and I’m totally screwing this up but I seriously don’t know how to say this.” He’s nervously rambling, his hands restlessly moving around. Turning his face away from Cas, his eyes search for something to rest upon. “What I’m trying to say...”
More grief, pain, and sorrow spread across his chest as he realizes why Cas had stopped him. With a short `I heard your prayer´ Dean had cowardly gone quiet. He didn’t know at the time, why, but Cas stopped him from saying the words. It led Dean to believe even more than the angel would, could, never love him. But now, now he knew why Cas had stopped him. The Empty would have come for him, Dean realizes now.
«Of course, Sammy,» he stares into his coffee, relief clearly passing over Dean´s face and he knows that his brother notices. «That would probably be good for the both of you, to get out and away for a while. Just working a good old fashioned hunt, without the whole world being at stake»
“Cas... I’m sorry I didn’t come for you, I tried. I tried. I should’ve followed you. I’m sorry I didn’t answer you that night. I just didn’t know how.”
Once again, Dean woke in the same bed as Cas, his back pressed up against his chest, Dean's hand holding the angel close.
every feeling, every particle of air around him, all the threads, it all transform into one single emotion, as Dean lays eyes on Cas’s true form for the first time.
“You’re not real.” Cas says with a sad whisper, breaking eye contact to look down at his hands that are nervously shaking in his lap.
“Life is good, Sam, it’s perfect.” He raises his cup of coffee as if toasting before bringing it to his lips, his free hand fiddling with his necklace which always stays hidden beneath his shirt. “It’s a beautiful morning.”
Cas believing Dean doesn’t love him. He didn’t deserve to die believing Dean didn’t love him. Because he did. Oh, how he loved the angel.
Using their intertwined hands to pull Cas closer, reaching out with his other hand to cup his face, Dean leans towards Cas and silences him by crashing their lips together in a long-awaited kiss. Sometimes the action is easier than the words. The soft feel of his lips. The way their faces fall together perfectly like pieces of a puzzle. It's everything he has ever dreamed of.
He smiles that beautiful smile of his. The smile that countless times has melted him. That smile on anyone else other than the real Dean is a cruel evil. His green eyes going from his lips to his eyes, and then back at his lips, Dean slowly leans closer.
«Get out! Or I'll go get the others.» Staring at the two of them tangled up on the bed, she raises her eyebrows, waiting for him to get out of bed.
Night after night, Dean falls asleep in the angel's arms, listening to his heart beating. Or with the angel in his arms, his own heart beating for the man resting next to him.
Cas dresses in the sweatpants and hoodie Dean gave him, and the moment his head rests back against Dean's pillow, he falls into a deep and comfortable sleep.
Seventy-nine days after Dean's 91st birthday, on a beautiful and warm spring night, Cas is woken by an electric spark making his heartbeats slow against his chest. He looks over at the man lying close beside him in bed. Breathing softly, slowly, with a smile still lighting up his face. Dean's face is always turned towards Cas, bodies always so close that they touch. Although the years have taken hold of them both, bodies no longer young, he’s still beautiful where he lays. Still Dean Winchester.
“Dean. About... about the things I said.” It takes a moment before Cas is able to meet his eyes, continuing. “I don’t expect anything from you. I need you to know that it’s okay that you don’t feel the same...”
“Don’t ever leave me again, you dumb son of a bitch.” The words would have sounded rough coming from anyone else. But Cas can hear the softness of his voice. If Cas didn’t know better, he’d say it almost sounded like it was filled with love.
Carefully he raised his lips to Dean's forehead, gently kissing him as his hand still gently rested atop his head. Fingers dancing through his beautiful light hair.
«I won’t go anywhere until he’s back, Sammy. I won’t give up on him. Nothing else matters right now. I don’t care shit about hunting anymore. He is what matters now.»
It’s dark, and well past midnight when Sam and Eileen finally arrive in the small remote town by the mountains. She pulls the car into the motel parking lot, filling the comfortable silence of the car with a tired sigh, to which Sam answers with a tired but blissful smile.
«Was... did…» Sam is struggling to push the words past his lips. His heart was heavy. Eyes clouded. Throat closing up.
It might just look like an ordinary living room, but this particular one was the Winchester’s private sanctuary. The other hunters who lived in the bunker sometimes joined them, yes, but they kept mostly to one of the two other living rooms they had renovated at the other end of the bunker. But this one. This one was theirs. With the other hunters roaming the halls of the bunker, they all shared a kitchen, library and the biggest living room was used as some sort of common room for everyone. But some nights, nights like these, the Winchesters would retreat to their own private living room, the one close to the hallway of bedrooms.
Cas cups Deans face with his free hand, gently kissing him, and as he pulls back he simply says, “Look up.”
Eyes still closed, something warm pressed against his chest, he slowly rose to consciousness. As he opened his eyes, his heart started racing, eyes growing wide as he stared at the back of Cas´s head, his nose buried in his hair. His hand resting conformably around his waist. He stopped breathing as his body froze, carefully trying to remove his hand from Cas, who was gently holding on to it.
A red 1971 Plymouth Valiant is also parked close to the entrance, and Dean smiles as he walks down to the bunkers next level, hearing quiet laughter. Sam and Eileen are seated in the library, both looking at something on a computer.
The room was bigger than the ones they’d usually stayed at, but there was still only two beds, Sam was sound asleep in the one closest to the window.
Still, the memory of Dean dying in his arms, stings somewhere in the back of his mind, not being able to let it go. The fact that he had dreamt the same thing three nights in a row, was too much of a coincidence to not mean something. Especially if your last name is Winchester.
«Dean was peacefully sleeping, the only thing he felt was his lips being kissed one last time.» Jack reaches over to take Sam’s hand. «Cas was woken by a spark, laying beside him, listening as he drew his last breath, his hand resting on his chest, feeling his heart beating one last time, just for
. You can hide all of you, everything. But, Dean. The way you’ve been looking at Cas all this time. The way the two of you act around each other. That is something you’ve never been able to hide. I’ve basically been the third wheel for a decade. And then when…» Sam pauses as he looks to the floor, setting down the books. He leans against the wall behind him before meeting Dean's eyes. «When you’ve lost Cas. When Cas died, so did you.»
«About Dean?» Of course, she knows. Although they haven’t known each other for more than a couple of years, she knows him better than most people.
«Dean, I know you didn’t mean to be cruel like you think you were. I know you, I’ve seen your soul and I know you are good. But even good souls have to let loose sometimes»
They raise from the bed, and the moment they meet by the door, Dean takes Cas’s hand in his, stopping them both. Turning to face Cas, his other hand moves to the necklace he’s got tucked away under his hoodie.
All he did was lay there. Lay there in the empty darkness. Regret and grief clouding his mind. And it was then that the torture occurred. When the angry Shadow kept him awake in the cruelest way possible.
“Don’t you ever leave me again you sonofabitch!” The words should’ve sounded rough but they came out gently as Dean pulled back to look into the angel's eyes. “You hear me? I can’t lose you again.”
Cas can feel tears on his face. But he’s not sure if they are his own, or Deans. Or both. He’s not sure how much time passes, as they both lose themselves in the embrace. Dean's hand finds its way to Cas’s hair, pulling them even closer to each other as Dean runs his hand through the dark and soft hair.
“NO! DONT YOU DARE WINCHESTER.” The Shadow screams at him and start reaching for the blade. But it’s too late.
He quickly gets out of bed, almost tripping on his slippers beside his bed. Still, in his pajamas, he sprints down the hallway to his brother's room. The bunker is dead quiet.
Dean. Even if Dean didn’t feel the same way as Cas did, he knows that Dean would never hurt Cas like this on purpose.
«Yeah... it’s beautiful during the day, but I figured it would be even better at night. The sky beautifully painted with sparks.»
Dean had been just standing in the middle of the room, frozen, eyes flying over each and every picture that Jack had made. Eyes lingering on the ones of him and Cas, until it finally rested on the one that showed them kissing. It wasn’t until Cas walked over from where he stood beside Sam, that Dean had moved. Cas put his arm around Dean´s waist, gently kissing away the tear that had fallen from Dean's eye. And then Dean had hidden his face in the space between the former angel's neck and shoulder, while Cas rested a hand in Dean's hair, gently stroking it.
He knows it’s his angel because he can feel his grace. He knows it’s his angel because he can see his soul.
“What do you mean?” Clearly taken aback by the question and sudden change of topic, Sam sits back in his chair studying Cas. “Like romantically?”
Dean also helped to teach and show the other hunters, especially the youngest, some tricks he’d learned over the years. Taught them what Dean knew about whatever it was they wanted to know. Cas also helped some with the angelic- and cosmic-themes, but Cas seemed to like better to listen to Dean. Sometimes contributing with information, but for the most part, just listening and observing Dean, which Dean found kinda cute.
With sad eyes, he follows the figure as he runs towards Cas. He can see his face now. Cas´s eyes tear up, but he refuses to let them free. Then he stands in front of Cas.
Cas places a gentle hand in Dean´s hair, smiling down at the sleeping man. He’d let it grow longer than usual, and Cas found the soft beautiful hair to be just another wonder that the world could not measure up to. At the touch, Dean moves slightly in his sleep, his hand reaching up, resting on Cas´s chest. Close to his heart.
“WHAT THE HELL?!” Sam wakes with a frustrated scream and sits up in the bed, looking around the room. When he sees Dean standing over him with an empty glass he looks at him with rage filling his eyes.
He had told his brother that the time alone and the silence would do him good. Told him that he didn’t have to worry about him, Dean was fine. He hadn’t really talked to him at all after everything that had happened, he’d been too focused on finding a way to get Cas back. Sam didn’t know what Cas had told him that night. Hadn’t told him how Dean's regret was slowly killing him. He couldn’t say it out loud. If he told his brother what Cas had told him, he would break. Dean would break. So he had welcomed the silence, as Sam and Eileen left him to his own thoughts. But it only made everything worse. This silence was an unbearable silence that filled the absence of the one thing he never was able to let go of. The silence left by him.
“Cas?! Are you okay?” He can feel himself getting weaker and weaker. Only wanting to lay down and rest. If it hadn’t been for Dean holding him, he would already have fallen to the floor.
, body. It acted on its own. Surprising Cas each time he felt it, as he keeps forgetting. But it’s still there sometimes. That little spark, his little piece of angel grace. And it was always Dean who made it spark.
“No...” Cas reaches Deans side, hand on his shoulder turning him so that they are facing each other. “The Shadow never gets the green right.”
Thank you so much to everyone who has read / commented / left kudoss so far, I really appreciate it! :)
The next time the Shadow approaches him as Dean, it has chosen another attitude. This one is the one that is the easiest to put up with.
Cas can feel his eyes tearing up and as he reaches his hand to lay it atop Dean against his face, Dean leans in closer, his eyes moving between Cas’s eyes and lips.
The last day of work before Christmas is over and Dean, on his way from the bathroom to his bedroom after a long and relaxing shower head down the hall, his hair still damp. He pulls his necklace - the chain holding a slightly glowing glass ball - over his head, placing it under his shirt so that it rests close to his heart. His black t-shirt sticking tight to his still damp chest and shoulders, his sweatpants hanging loosely from his hips.
At his words, Dean was suddenly wide awake as he stared at Cas, a shy smile on his lips as he avoided Dean's eyes.
«Dean, what’s wrong?» He whispered as he looked around the room, over his shoulder. He stepped aside to close the door behind him. «Oh. Uhm…»
«Dean, don’t apologize for that. I knew there was something you weren’t telling me, but it wasn’t my place to make you tell me. With everything that has happened, no one blames you for anything. You’re my brother, and I will love you no matter what, even when you shut me out or don’t feel like talking. I’m glad you told me though, and I’m glad to finally see you get what you deserve. Being loved the way you deserve to be loved. Besides, it's not like I didn’t know about the two of you.» Sam was watching him with glassy eyes, a careful smile on his lips.
«The deal.» Dean studies Jack's face, not really sure what he’s looking for. «Cas would be taken at the moment he experienced true happiness. Which he did that night, right?»
Dean almost feels bad leaving the kitchen with that tone, but he knows his brother knows. And that almost makes it even worse. Almost.
He wakes sometime later to the sound of Cas restlessly sleeping, turning over in Dean's bed, seeming to not find any peace. Dean moves to his side, sitting down at the edge of the bed, gently waking the angel.
Having stepped around Dean, Cas took in the room, seeing only one empty bed. «I... I can sleep on the floor. It's no problem.»
When the two of them were left alone together, cleaning the kitchen after dinner he’d had to force every cell in his body not to tackle the angel, pulling him as close as he could. Kiss his lips. Hold his face in his hands, hold his whole world between his fingers. Just. Hold the angel. While cleaning the kitchen, they’d danced around each other, both of them wearing this stupidly cute smile on their face. And when they were done, Dean had finally laid his hand against the angel's chest. Moving it up to cup his face. He’d leaned in and given Cas a light, warm, gentle kiss. They both put on that stupidly cute smile again before joining the others in the living room. Sitting close to each other, but not close enough for Dean. He was suddenly kind of unsure of how to act in front of the others. He hadn’t talked to Sam after they got back. He’d talked to Jack before he went to the empty, and Jack knew what had happened between him and Cas. But he still hadn’t said a word about it to Sam. He felt he needed to say something, but he didn’t know what. Or how. Feelings and words weren’t really his specialty...
Also, the new hunters introduced in this chapter are original characters, that I made up at 3 am last night. They won't be very important to the story, but I wanted to add some more hunters because this is how I feel the show should have ended.
?» Sam takes one look at his face and knows right away. Meeting his brother's eyes, Dean's eyes go wide and his mouth is so dry he can’t utter a word. «Hey, Dean. Relax.»
«It shows. It looks good on you. On both of you. It´s been a long time since I’ve seen you this… alive.»
“Don’t. Don’t let go just yet.” So Cas falls back against Dean's shoulder, breathing a little easier now.
When they went into the grocery store to get food, and Cas leaned over and kissed Dean on the cheek as he saw how Dean smiled at the freshly baked pie, no one knew who they were and no one looked at them as they shared a private moment. When they had gone into town to get Cas some new clothes, walking hand in hand, no one even looked at them, because to the others in town, they were just a couple who sometimes dropped by, like for example to buy new clothes. No one really knew them there, so the world consisted of only the two of them when they were together.
At 8:10 am, the kitchen door is unlocked and an old and gray-haired Sam Winchester smiles at Jack as they greet him with a smile, reaching out to take the cup of warm coffee he hands them. Sam sits down beside Jack, the two of them staring at the sky as the sun appears at the horizon. None of them speaks for a very long time.
“Morning, bro!” Dean's wide smile and shining eyes take away his worry, but not confusion. Sam notices that his hair is damp, probably having just showered, and he’s wearing one of his silly-looking pajamas with pictures of pies on it, and a dark green comfy-looking hoodie.
When he wakes in the morning, their faces are still so close together that Dean can feel Cas´s soft breaths against his face. He only had to lean forward slightly and their lips would touch. He wants to so badly. Just once.
angel. When Dean raises from hugging the dog, he runs off, continuing down the hall, most likely headed for his favorite resting spot by the fire.
, ‘the circle of the world’. It’s the Old Norse kings’ sagas. Could be useful to know if you were to deal with some ancient Norse kings. Scandinavians can be tricky people.”
Cas had died before Dean even realized what his words meant. For so long, Dean had believed that Cas didn’t, or couldn’t, feel love the same way humans did. Love the way Dean loved.
The moment Dean catches Cas´s eyes, the world around him stops. He’s always been beautiful, but with the sight of him on the other side of the room and Cas´s blue eyes shining as they fall on him, Dean almost stops breathing. Dean has never seen anyone, or anything, as beautiful as his angel.
Without hesitation, Dean quickly pulls out an angel blade, hidden in the sleeve of his jacked. From his pocket he pulls out a small, round glass ball, tied to a chain. It was only the size of a small clinker.
«No. Dean, it’s just a bad feeling that something will go wrong if you go alone. Just don’t, okay? I don’t know how to explain it, it’s a wierd feeling I got. But please, trust me. Promise you won’t go.»
Knitting their fingers together, their intertwined hands rest on the seat between them all the way home.
How Dean had managed to live his whole life without his touches, his lips, his warmth, is the biggest mystery of all. Now, having tasted them, Dean can not even imagine having to live without them for a day. Savoring the feel of their every kiss. Every embrace. Every moment. Dean tucks them safely into his heart for him to keep with him forever. Even forever won't be long enough for them.
“Ah! Found it!” Cas pushes himself from the wall and hurries further down the hall when he can hear Dean walking towards the door. Rounding a corner just in time as Dean comes out of the storage room, Cas is just able to hear Dean before he hangs up. “I’d love to go for a drive! I could probably be there by tomorrow night. Awesome! I’ll be expecting pie though.”
Dean growls from beside him, drawing Cas’s attention to him. Half in shock, they just lay there on the floor, staring at the other's eyes. Neither fully believing they made it out. Together.
How Dean had ever found those words hard to say, he didn’t understand. So much time spent alone, lonely with his feelings, because he could not say those words. They had been the hardest words Dean had ever known, and now, he could not stop saying them.
A smaller one showed Dean holding Cas tightly on a dark street, beside a payphone in the middle of a sleeping town, his smile wide and loving, but also pained. With one hand Dean cups the angel's face, as the other holds them close in a longing embrace. He’d taken the memory from Dean, the memory of him finding Cas alive, having been thrown out of the empty. Sam was present in the picture too, but he was only a blurry presence in the background. The memory felt like love when Jack held it to make the picture.
His name is only a whisper, but it’s all around him, the angel's voice present in every speck of light around him.
Cas only smiles in response, his own hand finding its way to Dean's neck. So he leans in, his lips hovering close to the others. Moving his eyes from his lips, to meet Cas’s blue eyes, he quietly asks again with his eyes.
Sam was still worried about the lack of contact from his brother today, but he had to smile at the thought of what they were going to do. He and Eileen had been talking a lot on the road about what they wanted to do. And he couldn’t wait to get started on forming this community, to make life easier for future generations of hunters.
This was supposed to just be a destiel fic, but Sam and Eileen deserved so much better too. So, there will be some chapters with a SAM pov, to have some cute Saileen, but mostly to see Dean and Cas from the other´s perspective (we all know how blind the two of them are, and how everyone else can see them...).
The last of the masked creature falls to the ground. Sam smiles at his brother, proud of having won another hunt, saving those boys. Dean is leaning against a beam at the other end of the barn, but he’s not smiling. «Sammy.»
Careful not to wake Cas, Dean reaches for his phone on his nightstand, the time shows 3:57 PM, but he can’t even remember what day it was when he went to sleep. So he sends a text message to his brother, not wanting to move from his bed. Only seconds later he can hear footsteps coming down the hall, the light outside his room turns on before his door is slowly and quietly opened.
“Cas... how did you get out?” Sam finally asks, eyes locked on their interwoven fingers, a smile playing on his lips. Dean doesn’t care, he’s spent too long hiding his feelings for the angel. He’s never doing that again.
But. It’s still the wrong eyes. Still the wrong shade of green shining like a star in an ocean of empty darkness.
They only pull apart when Dean gets a message, their phones long-forgotten bringing them back to the world. Quickly typing out a reply, Dean steps close to Cas again.
A small smile plays on Dean's lips, not wanting to think about the feeling of losing Cas, but wanting to get lost in the feeling of loving and being loved by Cas.
«You were everything together. Best friends, yes. Family, yes. But also something more. No one looks at their best friend like the longing looks you give each other. No one loves their family the way you love each other. You and Sam, Cas and Sam; that’s so different from
«No, Cas. Don´t be stupid.» Dean cursed himself for not being able to speak with a clear voice. «We´ll just share the bed, it's big enough for two. Come on, let's get some sleep.»
When Dean, still kissing him, leans closer, his arms going to his waist, the lightbulb directly over them explodes with a loud snap. Dean rapidly pulls back from the kiss, but gather his arms protectively around the angel and pulls him even closer to his chest. Sparks rains down all around them, before the spot they are standing in turns slightly darker in the absence of the light. A moment passes and Dean slowly looks to the angel's face who is blushing and trying not to meet his gaze. A small but almost embarrassed smile plays on his lips.
«Ugh, don´t call me cute. Dean Winchester is not cute.» But he can’t hide the laughter from his voice, which makes Sam smile even brighter.
«Okay. Come on Cas, I saw a diner around the corner.» Dean closes the door, turning away from his brother, looking at the former angel.
had changed, already the day they had returned from the empty. He’d gone to Dean’s room to look for them. When he opened the door, he’d first seen their intertwined hands, resting above Dean’s heart. He’d smiled at them, at the way they lay so close, faces turned towards each other. Even when they were sleeping they longed for each other. Sam had quietly turned off the lights in the room and taken the tray of uneaten food with him, closing the door, still smiling. If they didn’t figure shit out
“Good boy! Yeah, good boy!” When he looks back up at Cas, he smiles fondly. “Cas, I want you to meet Miracle. Mir, this is Cas. Yeah
«Well, it not like the relationship between you and Cas is the best-kept secret in the universe. You two have been pining after each other for so long I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if you had been together this whole time.»
Dean watches Cas the whole way home, a loving smile playing on his lips. Their intertwined hands resting on the seat between them.
“We found him a while after you... and then when Jack brought everyone back, no one claimed him. So I brought him back home with us.” Dean smiles, clearly already caring deeply for the dog.
When he opens them again, Dean is so close that Cas forgets to breathe. And then Dean's hands slowly move from his face to his throat. Holding Cas by his throat. Still staring at his lips, as close as possible without touching, a wicked grin spreads across Dean's face.
Cas finds Sam in the library working on translating some old books. Joining him at the table Cas is feeling restless, Dean's phone call on repeat in his head. Sam looks up at him as he sits down.
«He´ll be fine, Sam. Dean will be fine. And so will Cas. And you, and me. We all will, we just need a moment to figure out how to get there. But we will.»
Before he can talk himself out of it, before his coward heart wins again, Dean lays down beside the angel. Laying on his side, he studies his face, as Cas falls back into a more peaceful sleep. With a smile on his lips, so does Dean, only moments later.
After a long moment of staring, Dean can’t take it anymore. If he can’t tell him… maybe he can show him…
wedding, gave us away a long time ago.» Dean's hands find their way underneath Cas´s shirt, gently brushing over the warm naked skin.
Walking up to the door to their room, Dean is ready for a good night's sleep. The case had turned slightly ugly today, and after treating himself with pizza and pie, he was ready to fall asleep, safely tucked into his lovers' arms.
Dean has never felt so alive as in this moment. His heart bleeds of love, his soul screaming with the will to
“Even the freckles.” Cas raises his hand, stretching it out to cup Deans face. His thumb gently strokes the space underneath his left eye. “The pattern is so right I almost believe it’s him.”
One hand still in his soft and dark hair, the other cups his angelic face. Cas's own hands find their way to Dean's waist, holding him close. His eyes full of love and emotion studies the blue eyes currently staring at Dean's lips. The blue eyes raise to meet his green, and with a deadly quiet, they hold each other's gaze for a long moment. Dean could spend the rest of his life like this. Holding the angel, kissing him freely as often as he wants, needs. Staring at him, the angel with eyes like the sky.
«Dean?» Sitting in front of him at the diner, Cas looked at him with a questioning look. Dean had been so lost in thought that he hadn’t heard him.
Dean almost feels bad leaving the kitchen with that tone, but he knows his brother knows. And that almost makes it even worse. Almost.
“For two seconds, just shut up, please!” Cas finally goes quiet as Dean pushes himself away from the car to stand in front of Cas. “What did you say?”
Jack had not been around when they started renovating the living room, but they had also left their touches on it. Above the fireplace along the longest wall stands several framed pictures that they had taken recently. It turns out Dean really loves to take pictures, especially in moments where he is the happiest, so there are lots of pictures of Cas, Sam, Eileen, Jack, Claire, Charlie, and the others he considered family. But on the sideboards besides the fireplace, stands lots of pictures not taken with any camera. It was Jack's gift to their family this Christmas.
. Not again. So he would protect them with his life if needed. Besides, he kinda wanted to keep Cas for himself for a while.
When Dean wakes in the morning, his face is buried in the crook of Cas´s neck, arms around each other, their bodies are keeping each other warm. Safe. Not wanting to leave his arms, Dean lays there, eyes closed, hand gently running over the man's back, a small smile painted on his lips.
He’d found the place one of the days he had been exploring the forest. It’s not far from the bunker, but Cas had walked for hours through the forest, listening to the birds singing. Daydreaming about nothing and everything, when he stumbled on to it on his way back home.
Hands exploring and feeling out every inch of skin. Their bodies merging as they move against each other in the comfortable darkness of their room. Moments turning into hours as they lay there tightly against each other, sweet words of love bleeding from their lips. Sweet touches of love burning over their bodies as they learn one and another with their hands, fingers, lips, mouths.
Dean doesn’t know how long he’s been walking, but it already feels like forever. His watch stopped working. His phone just as dead. So he just keeps walking.
Sam couldn’t believe how blind he had been to not see all of that in that way before Eileen had pointed it out. How they loved each other so intensely through such small gestures, almost invisible to other people. He must have been just as blind as Dean and Cas, to not see that that was the way they loved when he’d been watching them do it for years. Sam had lived with the two of them for over a decade, used to the touches, the longing looks, the fighting, everything. So he hadn’t seen the way they loved each other quietly while doing it before Eileen had explained how she saw them. And now he couldn’t see it. And he couldn’t help but remember how those small gestures had always been there.
“Cas.” Dean needs him to believe it’s real, or he don’t know if he’ll be able to get them out of there.
son. “The Shadow got angry when Chuck appeared, and it refused to let anyone go, so they started fighting. Chuck woke up everyone, so I had to fight my way through the darkness, and then I somehow managed to sneak out, appearing just outside the bunker. I don’t think anyone else got out though... The Shadow only wanted to sleep, but as long as I was awake it couldn’t, and then Chuck came and made everything so much worse.”
«Sure. Of course. You don’t have to worry about me, Sammy! Go have some fun with your girlfriend.» At that Sam gives him a skeptical and knowing look. Sam knows how Dean handles losing people he loves. It's not pretty. Especially not when he loses
Sam and Eileen had first gone to visit a friend of hers, a 29-year-old hunter, Alexander, who she had met ten years ago, when she helped him with a case, and since then they had become close friends. He grew up in a hunter family, but when his parents retired from hunting, he wanted to continue. When they met Xand, they were introduced to his husband, Leo. Turns out the 27-year-old hunter was an old acquaintance of the Winchester family. John Winchester had been an old friend of Leo’s father, and although Leo no longer had a relation to his father, he had been delighted to meet Sam again. They had been living on the road for the past three years, and when they were offered to make the bunker a home-base, they didn’t hesitate for a second.
Cas responds with a small chuckle, his breaths tickling Dean's neck, nose softly running over his skin. His hand cups Dean's face as he leans forward to gently greet Dean with sweet kisses. Smiling into the kiss they hold tight around each other, their naked bodies warming their skin against each other.
“Hey, Dean,” Sam says in a low voice. “I was starting to wonder if any of you were ever going to wake up. You’ve been sleeping for almost 72 hours now...”
Cas, speechless from the kiss, watches him with his intense blue eyes. Eyes that seem brighter than ever before. The blue is even more beautiful up close.
Or how he loved to be kissed on his forehead. Dean loved how Cas adored hugging him from behind, wrapping his arms around him, resting his head on Dean's shoulder, just watching and observing whatever Dean was doing at the moment. Dean loved those hugs. And, how Dean always slept better the nights when Cas would hold him, or Dean held him. Those nights he slept better than he ever had before in his life.
«I just... I didn’t answer him. I just stood there. And I’ve been so ashamed about that ever since. I couldn’t tell you how I fucked up that one thing.»
The dog seems to understand him as he turns his whole being around to place his front paws on Cas’s thighs. Cas smiles at that, greeting Miracle with gentle strokes on his head as the dog looks questionably at him. “Hello, there. Aren’t you a gorgeous little one?”
«It…» he chuckles as he finally meets Dean's eyes. «It seems that the small portion of grace you left with me, is not as easy to control as when I’m fully powered up. It is... Uhm... I believe it’s so little that I have no control over it, and it might act on its own will when I experience... Uhm... strong emotions. So, it does things like that sometimes.»
Where the blue of the sky touches the green of the earth, a fire is set once more. Flames that can never be tamed. In no life. In no world.
«I found it one day when I was out walking, maybe a week ago, and I’ve come here a couple of times. It’s so peaceful. I don’t think a lot of people come here, I don’t know if anyone even knows of the place. The dirt road hasn’t been used for so long I’m surprised it’s not overgrown yet...»
this early. Cas, fluent in every language, is of course also an expert in ASL. Sam is still learning, and although he knows a little bit, he isn't an expert, so he’s glad at least someone is. They’d found they had a lot of common interest, so Cas and Eileen have become very good friends after Cas got back, and both Dean and Sam couldn’t be happier about it.
“Oh, poor little angel.” The Shadow in front of them grins wickedly at Cas. Dean takes a step forward, as to keep the angel safe from the creature in front of them. “You really are blinded.”
Those nights, when they find and heal each other again, and again, every pain and suffering is taken away. Every concern and feelings of anxiety left outside the door. Every fear and dismay are forgotten. The only thing remembered is their bodies and their touches, their words, and their love. Souls bleeding heavy for the other, just so they can be healed as one.
Cas moves closer, his free hand taking Dean's face, a thumb gently stroking the space under his eyes.
Dean wished he could just stay here forever. In this little hallway, in Cas’s embrace, the world forgotten, but eventually his brother breaks the silence by clearing his throat. Reluctantly turning away from Cas’s lips, he shoots his brother an annoyed look. Raising his hands as if in surrender, Sam takes a step back from the door and heads down the stairs. When Dean turns back to watch Cas, he’s met with glassy eyes, and a small smile across his lips.
«Hello, Dean.» Jack smiles as they meet his eyes, before sitting down on the steps to hug Miracle, «I heard your prayer. I’m sorry I haven’t been able to come to visit. But I wanted to. I’ve missed you too.»
Less sleep and more touches. Curled against each other, bodies as close as possible. Exploring each other, each other's bodies, in a way they never have before. Touches lingering like whispers all over their skin, their bodies. Underneath thin blankets in the dark of their sanctuary, sweet words are muttered as hoarse whispers, only meant for the other's ear.
he won’t be able to handle it. But Sam, luckily knows his brother too well when it comes to how Dean handles these things. Sam learned a long time ago there was no point in forcing Dean to talk about
“Hey.” Dean smiles as he finally opens his eyes to look at Dean. Cas gives him a smile in return as he tries to rub the sleep from his eyes.
It also uses his last words against him. Telling Cas, as Dean, how he can never love him. How Dean could never love someone like him. Never love such an awful creature. That his feelings for Cas are only hatred and anger. Never love. It hurts.
They had been in contact with the son of an old friend of Sam and Dean, Severin. They had known his mother once back in the days, and after she died last year, he had been on his own. He was young, only 22 years old, but a skilled hunter. Dean had helped him out on a case five years ago, and already then, he was skilled. He often lived on the road, and four years ago he had been working a tricky case, where he had met Alexandria. Her family was killed and she never managed to settle after that. When Sev had returned to her town half a year later, she wanted to try hunting, and he’d been teaching Alex the hunter-life since.
“Cas... what?” At the look Dean gives him, it’s Cas’s turn to panic, uncomfortably shifting against the car.
«Oh you poor, lovesick little angel. You keep waking me up with your longing and your regrets, and I hate being awake. And if I have to stay awake, I’m going to make sure that you suffer with me.»
“The way they act so different with each other than anyone else. Like Dean, he just... turns soft whenever Cas is close. And Castiel... he’s so bright when he’s with Dean. Everything, really.” Zane repeated.
Talking about it with Eileen, she’d made him understand the two in a way he hadn’t before. With Eileen's words, Sam had truly come to understand how Dean and Cas guarded themselves against being vulnerable. Neither of them had really been good at showing emotions in the presence of others, so it shouldn’t really surprise him. Then Eileen had pointed out another thing that Sam knew of all too well, but had never really understood; the way they loved in the details. Sam knew the little things had always been there, but he’d never seen why, or how. Now they made so much more sense. She said that they weren’t people who showed their emotions with big gestures, so as not to draw attention to their feelings, something they considered so private. She told him how they
Even with the bed being huge enough for them to have plenty of space between them, Dean wakes up the next morning to their bodies cuddled close together.
“Dean likes someone else? Not that I know of. Why don’t you ask him?” Suddenly uncomfortable by the thought of asking
«So, if we could get ´em here we could start sharing everything left over from the days of the Men of letters. There is way too much knowledge here for only us to keep. New and future generations of hunters should have a fair chance now that we know that anything can happen, even with Jack as the new God trying to make paradise.» Sam says wistfully as he finishes his breakfast.
With Cas’s warm body lying atop his own, only their two warm plaid jackets covering them, Dean slowly wakes as the winter night starts letting go. The car is chilly, but laying this close together they both managed to stay warm, even after they fell asleep sometime during the night. Softly breathing against his bare neck, a sleeping Cas rests his head on Dean's shoulder, forehead pressed softly against Dean's temple, a warm arm laid across Dean's chest, hand half cupping Dean's face.
The bright smile on his face when Dean handed him a steaming cup of coffee definitely made the walk across town to find it, so worth it.
Sam takes her hand in his as they head for the room they booked earlier. It's a quiet and charming old town and the fresh air tastes of forest and rain. They say you can smell it in the air, right before it starts to rain. Especially in places like this, far away from the big cities, the area surrounding by huge forests and beautiful nature. Looking up at the sky before they head through the door, Sam can see clouds passing by, each one heavier than the next.
Sam is still smiling when he and Eileen get home. Parking the car, Sam can see that the impala hasn’t been moved, at all. Dean would often use the garage as a calming place. Fixing up his car, or another. He would retreat to the garage if he became too restless, not able to do anything, especially the times he’d lost someone. Lost Cas. But no one has been in the garage since they left.
It takes another half an hour before they finally fall asleep, their soft kisses and burning touches distracting them in the dark.
“Yeah?” Looking up, Cas watches as Dean finishes his burger. They’re parked just outside town, sitting against the hood of the impala and enjoying the late summer sun.
“Yeah. That’s been there for over a decade. I’ve been third-wheeling them for so long I might actually explode soon.” He had to laugh at them again. It’s hilarious how these people who has spent less than a month in the bunker, had seen this so clearly when Dean and Cas hadn’t. “So, no they aren’t married, and they aren’t together as far as I know. But they’ll get there.”
“That’s good,” Dean answers as he pulls Cas closer to hug him tighter than ever, burying his face in his neck. Never wanting to ever let go of him again. “Because. I want to live. I want to love. And I think I’m ready. To live a life to love. And there is no one else I love more than you.”
Dean can’t stop thinking about him. Every moment of every day, he has been thinking about Cas. Thinking about how his touches send sparks throughout his whole body. Thinking about how his body feels pressed against his own. Thinking about the warmth he feels every time he looks at him with those beautiful eyes, smiling that beautiful smile.
Dean doesn’t really know when his feelings for the angel started to change, or if they had just been there all along, but he was too stupid to see it. But, he remembers when he first thought the thought. That he might be
Cas had once said Dean wouldn’t be able to see his true form, nor hear his true voice, but this time he does.
«He told me he loved me, Sammy, and I let him die without telling him I love him too. I’ve never been so ashamed in my life. I didn’t tell him I love him.» He knows the words come out rougher than he meant, so carefully he moves his eye towards his brother, not knowing what to expect. Sam is watching him, waiting for him to continue. «I couldn’t tell you that, because I couldn’t even tell
«I don't want to see how everyone goes crazy if they find you here. It was bad enough when we were going to bed, especially your brother.»
«But the road doesn’t care about you, or where you go. You can go in every direction, turn into every road or side road. Whatever highway your headlights turn to. But the road doesn’t care.
«I do. It's just that we didn’t talk about any of this, and I don’t know the rules…» the little uncertain smile on his lips could melt Dean in a second.
They sit there in silence for a long while. Dean staring out at the room, his eyes not really falling on anything. Jack is leaning against Miracle in the chair beside them, carefully and lovingly stroking the fluffy ball of sunshine.
«Do you… do you want me to stay here?» Cas´s voice sounds unsure as he stops in front of Dean's door, and as Dean turns to face him, he can see it on his face too. «I could sleep in my own room if you want to sleep alone.»
Weeks had passed since they opened the bunker to other hunters, growing this new hunter network, where eight hunters were currently living with them permanently. Two others lived close by and stopped by almost every day. Other than that, they had hunters visiting when driving through town, or if there was something they needed, or could help with. So the bunker was often bustling with people. Now, right before Christmas, the bunker was so alive, which it probably hadn’t been since the Men of Letters left it, and Sam was almost glowing with excitement as they continue to develop the network. Getting calls from other hunters across the country who wanted to join their work, some wanting to establish a base as they had here. Sam had grown up not wanting to be a hunter, but now, he couldn’t imagine not living like this. He loved this. Loved how he could help others, get hunters in touch with each other, establishing a community and network that for sure would live on for a long time.
They had been on the road all day, heading north to help a fellow hunter with a vampire nest. They didn’t know how long they would be on the road, maybe a couple of days, but it wasn’t like they had anything they had to return to. Well, Sam would probably want to go back to Eileen before too much time passed, but not Dean.
«I think maybe, the love between the two of you, is such a huge part of you that you don’t recognize it for what it really is. Not even God could come between you.
“He might be drained of... well everything since he spent so long there,” Jack says as they pass Sam to approach Cas. “I could heal the cut and bump up your levels, but that might make it worse. You’ve been locked away In the void for so long, with no access to your power or anything. I don’t know how you’d react to my power if I tried to heal you. Especially since Dean had to drain your grace. You should probably get some proper rest. You’ll need it, whether you want your grace returned or if you stay human.”
When Cas had been human before, he had found mornings to be terrible. But not these mornings when he would wake beside Dean. Those were like little pieces of heaven. Them waking together. Smiling at each other. He never wanted to leave the sanctuary of their bed, their room. But as always, they had to get up sometime. During the weekends, when Dean didn’t have work, they would wake together like this, staying there for as long as they could. Usually, they were dragged out of bed by scratching on the door. They had already slept in, and the dog outside had waited long enough for them to wake. So when Dean went to open the door, Miracle sprinted through the door, jumping as high as he could to land in the middle of the bed, getting comfortable between the two men as Dean lay back down beside Cas. Miracle let out a happy bark as Cas obeyed his request for cuddles.
«Cas.» Dean moves closer to him, a hand against his cheek, a soft kiss against his lips. «I’ve already told you. All of me is yours.»
Tomorrow they would drive back home, getting everything ready for the new hunters to move in. They’d sought out the once they knew, and through them, they had found some more. Together they made quite a gang. Six new hunters, six new residents in the Men of Letter bunker. Six new friends, and hopefully sometime in the future, family.
Dean had to hide his bright smile when Sam, a week later, got a call from a fellow hunter asking them for help. Dean said yes right away.
Sam also loved how it brought him and Eileen closer each day. She loved hunting too, and she often went out on cases with the other hunters living in the bunker. Sam tried to join whenever he could, but he, Taylor and Xand mostly stayed here working on uploading their library to the online hunter's network. Today, however, Leo had found a ghost case just an hour drive from here that he had wanted Sam to join him on. He guesses he needed to get out there once in a while.
This time, Cas was the one to stop abruptly in the doorway of their motel room, Dean walking into him. He didn't have to say anything as Dean saw why he had stopped short. He laughed quietly as he pushed Cas into the room by placing a gentle hand at the small of his back.
Frozen, laying beneath Dean, Cas stares at him, not able to move. He can feel Deans short breaths on his lips. All he has to do is lift his head slightly, and Cas would finally get to know what those lips feel like on his own. Instead, Cas closes his eyes.
The times he was awake was worse than the time he spent asleep. He remembers everything from the last time he was stuck here, but this time seemed to be even worse. The Shadow was angry now. Angrier than before. The Shadow claimed that Cas was the reason he couldn’t go back to sleep. But Cas has no idea how it could be his fault.
Standing there in the middle of the floor staring at the book by his feet he has to catch his breath as he stopped breathing at the words.
Just the two of them, without the others being nosy. Because, the moment they announced this, this thing between them, it would be everyone's business. He’d seen how the others had acted when Severin and Alex had told them that moving into the bunker, finally settling down, had finally brought them together. They had moved into one of the bigger rooms a couple of days later, together. Everyone had been so excited and happy about it, the other new hunters especially. Asking all kinds of questions one could expect when announcing a relationship. It was nice, yes, but Dean felt that for now, he wanted to keep Cas to himself. Everyone in the bunker… Well, everyone was everywhere. And although Dean wanted everyone to know how much he loved the angel, and that the angel was
Finally looking out over the room, Dean is filled with even more happiness and love, even though he didn’t think that was possible at the moment. It's the happiest moment of his existence. He laughs as his family keeps cheering, the room exploding in even more love as each moment passes.
Cas keeps watching Dean with a look that sends shivers down his back. Dean holds his gaze, searching for something in his eyes.
«We wasted so many years, didn’t we?» Dean chuckles against Cas´s lips, tears running down his cheeks as he kisses his angel once more.
«Me neither. Come here.» Getting rid of his own shirt, Dean leans back in as Cas cups his face and drags them towards the bed. Gently pushing Dean onto the bed, Cas follows, their lips never leaving each other.
«Hey! None of that. Come on Dean.» At the look Charlie gives him, Dean doesn’t dare to lean in, so he reluctantly drags his arm away from its safe place around the former angel. As he has moved away from him, Cas buries his head in the pillows, getting comfortable again and most likely soon asleep again.
«You know. Dean sees his life as a broken road, one that he is destined to follow. There are no exits, nowhere to pull the car in another direction. So all he does is keep on driving.» Sam watches the town in front of them. He goes quiet for a while until he continues, his voice is more distant as his mind is somewhere else. «He’s been on this road all his life. Dean has been by my side
Along the way, they had made their own family. With Cas. With Bobby. With Jack. With Eileen. They had made the bunker their home, something they hadn’t had since that fateful night, where they had lost everything. Until then, the road had been their home, their family.
«Morning, angel.» Dean smiles into the kiss, before resting his head on the pillow close to Cas’s face.
«It's no fun when you do that, angel.» The shadow circles him, Cas following the motion to keep his eye on the black Shadow. «It is, however, funny how you think I would just let you sleep peacefully when you keep waking me up all the time.»
Dean had always believed his life would only consist of hunting, and being a big brother. But lately, he had started to imagine what his life could be like if he started living it, instead of just watching it. The thought had been slowly creeping up on his for the past year, and the more he imagined a peaceful life, a life where he could just simply be. Simply live. He realized he wanted that more than anything.
“You’ve been through so much, and you really deserve to finally have some peace, happiness. And I think it’s great that you’ve finally found someone to share that peace with.”
Laying close together in the dark of their room, they fall into a sweet and peaceful sleep. Falling asleep in each other’s arms, night after night. Waking in each other’s tight embrace, day after day.
«Would you like a couple more of those?» Cas says shyly as his thumb lightly rests against the freckles on his cheeks.
“Chuck got Lucifer out of the empty? Why?” Jack asks with a puzzled look on his face. Just as confused as the others.
“Don’t leave, please.” Cas whispers, but the words still reach Dean as he reaches out to take Dean's hand, and a tear escapes down his face, still half lost in sleep.
life too. I've never seen my brother be the way he is when he is with Cas. At first, they were simply best friends, and eventually, Cas became family, but then something changed. Something changed around the time they were lost in purgatory together. I don't know what, but he was different when he came back. Dean came back alone, and I’ve never seen him that broken. And then Cas returned. And it was as if Dean had regained the spark of life. Like he had found his reason for living again.»
“Maybe another time, Sammy. Wasn’t really planning on doing anything today. Got some parts to change on Baby, so I might spend some hours in the garage.”
Dean turns back to Cas, to his husband, and gripping his green tie, Dean pulls him in for another kiss. He will never get enough of those lips.
, accompanied by the brightest smiles he can remember to have smiled in weeks. She returns the smile with one of her own as she reaches up and kisses him.
And of course, Dean. Dean filled his spare time with Cas, and Cas filled his spare time with Dean. They had talked about Cas also finding some kind of job, and he wanted to, sometime in the future maybe. But right now? Right now Cas just wanted to
“We’ve been sleeping for three days.” Dean has to chuckle at the expression Cas gives him. “Yeah... let's not do that again. The whole spent-way-too-long-in-a-empty-void.”
“Here, change into these. They are way more comfortable than that suit of yours. I’ll go find you something to eat and drink. I’ll be right back.” He seems nervous, voice shaky as he speaks, not wanting to meet Cas’s eyes this time. But as he reaches the door Dean hesitates, looking back to Cas.
Dean has never slept as well as he does when he falls asleep and wakes up in Cas´s arms. Or Cas tucked into his arms.
Dean was the first to wake in the morning. He’d been slipping in and out of sleep all night, and yet, he felt like he hadn’t slept this good in a long time. He could feel a blush spreading all through his body as he realized how close he had moved to Cas sometime during the night.
«I. Will. Never. Love. You.» Good, the anger is more bearable. The love is what breaks him. But this, he can endure. The Shadow, still appearing as Dean laughs as his hands keep choking the life out of the angel. «The look on your face. It's almost worth being awake for. To believe Dean Winchester would ever love you. A fool's hope, Castiel. You're a fool, Castiel.»
“Cas, what happened to your throat?” Sam asks after pulling away from the hug. Cas places his hand on his throat finding a cut, still bleeding.
Cas has lived for longer than humanity is capable of imagining. He has seen it all, lived it all. Been all over the world, in heaven, in hell.
“It’s not mine. I’m okay, but I think I might have hurt my elbow a little.” Cas looks down at his arm, carefully stretching it, wincing when he can’t hold it out.
Cas believed his days were past, that he would spend the rest of eternity sleeping in the Empty. But he woke, and that’s when the Shadow made sure to torture him. He hadn’t known why he had started to wake, but he suspected that the man beside him had something to do with it. He couldn't hear his words when he was lost in the void, but an unrecognizable feeling had lingered around him. He recognized the feeling when Dean came close, pulling him into his arms. It was Dean. The feeling. It was Dean. Always Dean.
The bunker library is dark, only a small table lamp lights up the table closest to the hallway, which is also dark. Heading down the stairs Eileen turns on the lights, showcasing the mess of the library. Sam just stares.
«DEAN! Don´t you dare.» Cas starts laughing as Dean groans and buries his face in Cas´s neck. Only when there’s another knock at the door, does he raise from the bed, placing a gentle kiss at Cas´s cheek.
“No. The other thing.” Cas’s hands are shaking and it takes a few moments before he can look up to meet Dean's eyes, finally repeating the words he tried to hide.
A whole new kind of silence takes hold of their bedroom. Cas gently closes the small distance between their lips, their lips finding each other
«Oh, Dean…» Eileen looks up at Sam, who is still standing at the bottom of the stairs. Not able to say anything. She reaches out and touches his hand, unfreezing him.
«Dean, I’m here.» At the sound of Cas’s voice coming from his phone, his heart stopped beating. «I’m hurt... can you let me in?»
«I´ll be back when he’s with me.» If it hadn’t been for the dead quiet of the room, Sam would never have caught Dean's words. He almost doesn’t hear them, even in the quiet.
The silence was broken when Miracle stood up from his place at Cas´s feet to nudge his knee with his head. Cas was instantly awake, smiling down at the dog. He leans forward to scratch Mir behind the ears, the dog clearly pleased by the attention. Then he turns on his pawns and goes running out of the room.
The road that Dean has driven all his life was suddenly running through heaven. Cas crashed into his life, and blessed this broken road that Dean had been on all his life.»
“Tik... tok...” Dean pretends to look at the time, raising his arm to show his watch. “Time’s running out on you, bitch.”
It's sad, and heartbreaking (I kinda cried writing this), but I also kinda find such endings beautiful, because Dean and Cas, and everyone else got to live a happy and long life.
Dean had just started his new job at the garage working four days a week, the other days he spent in the bunker working with the hunters, although he never went with them on hunts. Cas filled his days by helping the others in the bunker the best he could, or by reading and learning, sometimes learning the hunters what he knew. Most days, when Dean was working, he would leave the bunker to go outside, their dog following close more often than not, something he had found to be his favorite thing to do to pass the time. Nature. The one place, other than inside this room, where he could find a sense of peace so deep and calm that he would long for it at times.
with him. He tried to deny it for such a long time, after first exploring the thought. He suppressed those feelings because he knew the angel didn’t love him like that. He knew Cas didn’t feel the same way.
«Listen, Sam. I know I haven’t talked much about stuff, and I’m sorry if…» He hated how hard it was to talk about this. Even with his
“Hey, I was gonna ask you about that one. I can’t figure out the language or translation to that book, do you know it?”
Dean is standing in the middle of the room, one hand closed around one of his jackets. A green one with some kind of dried blood stain, fresh blood beside it. Dean's other hand hangs loosely by his side, blood dripping to the floor.
, he’d definitely have to do something about it himself. He’d returned once every other hour, making sure they were okay. Their hands stayed over Dean’s heart. They hadn’t moved much, but it did look as if their bodies kept moving closer each time. When Dean had messaged him, he’d run to his room. Their hands still together. Bodies now so close that their sides were pressed against each other. Cas was lying on his stomach, his shoulder half resting against Dean, face turned towards Dean. A couple of days later he’d seen them walk into Dean’s room together, closing the door, neither of them leaving until the next morning.
Too caught up in each other, they didn’t notice their son standing by the house, smiling at them before turning, disappearing into the forest. Pulling back slightly from their gentle kiss, resting their foreheads together, their eyes meet once more.
Each day it has gotten colder, a sharpness added to the air. Autumn is slowly letting go of its hold, welcoming the winter cold. And with November showing off, the night is clear and the sky filled with beautiful stars.
«Sammy? Please turn off the light or close the door, I need at least half an hour before I can function as a human being. And I prefer to suffer that half-hour in the dark.»
Leaning their foreheads together, Dean smiles down at Cas softly as he closes his eyes, holding on to his angel. When Cas stands up, he tightens his arms around Dean, not wanting to let go, gently brushing their lips together in the whisper of a kiss, Cas smile at the feel of his man finally in his arms.
Again, Cas settled close to him on the bed, and as Dean was about to fall asleep he could feel warm fingers gently running down his arm. He looked up at Cas, meeting his eyes with a small and tired smile.
The characters should have gotten to chose their ending, not the writers who don't even know their own characters... we all know, whether you like the ending or not, that the end wasn't the character's choice, it was rather their worst nightmare come true, and that will forever haunt me.
“I love you, stupid.” Stepping closer, Dean reaches out to grab the front of Cas’s jacket, then he moves his hands up. One resting on his neck, the other cupping his face, holding on to him so that he’s forced to look at Dean. Not that he’d ever want to look away. “I’ve been trying to tell you for so long, but I’ve never been brave enough. And then I sort of told Jody, and she told me to go for it. I was talking about you, Cas. You.”
At the sound of a door closing somewhere in the bunker, Dean hurries down the hallway until he stops in front of his room. Gently knocking while looking around to make sure no one is there to see him, he can hear muffled footsteps from inside the bedroom. The door silently opens and he is met with a sleepy face that lights up in a bright smile as he looks at Dean.
This is the third night in a row that Sam has had the same dream. The first night he woke when he and Dean arrived at the barn. The second night he woke when he and Dean had killed all the masked creatures. But this time it seemed that Sam woke after the dream had ended. That’s what scares him this time, so much that he runs down the hall to check on his brother. The bunker is too quiet.
Cas chuckles quietly as he leans closer to place his lips on Deans. His hands resting on Dean's hips, pulling him closer. «You do snore, Dean, I know that. But after all those times I’ve sat by your bed, listening to your breath. Snore. Sometimes even speak in your sleep. I find it cute.»
«Dean…» still short of breath, Cas tugs Dean's head closer to his neck giving him access to do whatever he wishes. It's Cas´s turn to close his eyes against the sweet kisses against his neck, Dean holding him while his hand wanders closer and closer to Cas´s hard line pressing against Dean. His cold fingers against his warm skin just beneath the hem of his pants. As Cas tightens his grip on Dean´s hair, Dean's lips slowly move away from his neck, searching for the other soft lips.
“Hey, Cas.” He smiles as Cas opens his eyes again and strongly grips Dean’s arm. Resting his palm against his arm, where, once upon a time, the same hand had left a burning scar.
«But, you are very cute, Dean.» Cas teases as he once again leans closer. Resting their foreheads together. Holding each other.
«Dean. You can talk to me.» Jack reaches across the table and softly rests a hand on Deans's shoulder. «You can talk to me about him.»
“Nothing. No gossip. Just some boring old Nordic texts.” The words fly out of Cas way too quickly to be subtle, and by the look Dean gives him, panic raises and Cas is quick to his feet. “I’m... I’m gonna go see if I can find a copy of The Elder Edda, I think you’ll enjoy that one Sam.”
«Well, yeah. I’ve been waiting for you to figure your shit out for years now. I didn’t want to say anything about it, but how you acted when he was gone. And when you got back, how you were even more attached at the hip than before. The first night when I was up to get something to drink, I walked past Cas’s room and I noticed that no one had been in the room and since Cas is human and needs sleep... I wasn’t certain, but I was pretty sure about where he was. The night after I saw you both going into your room when you went to bed. You’re not as sneaky as you think. You need to work on your poker face if y’all are going to keep it a secret.»
Soon they arrive at a small clearing atop a small cliff. Dean parks the car in the middle of the cleaning, turning off the car, cutting off the soft tones.
The road won’t care if you live, or if you die. It might lead you on your way all alone, but the highway don't care if you're all alone. The road will be your whole life, but the road won’t hold you when you need, dry your tears, or wait for you to come home.
«But we broke free. The road let us go. And now the road is just a chapter, not the whole book. We chose the road when we like, and chose home when we need it.» He goes quiet for a while. «These past few days with you, on the road, they’ve been a comfort. Knowing that we can go
Dean doesn’t even turn to look at them, only moving closer to the black hole in the wall. He stops in front of it, lingering at the edge of the emptiness ahead.
A tear betrays him as it falls from Cas´s closed eyes. For just a moment longer, he wants to pretend it's actually Dean. But it's not.
He´d never believed he’d get to live a happy life, to feel loved the way he had always longed for. To be loved by the angel that he’d fallen for so many years ago. The angel he, tomorrow, would get to call
Dean has to look away, turn away from the way his brother looks at him. The memories of mourning Cas, the memories of Cas leaving him alone. He couldn’t think about that. Didn’t want to.
“I’m not going anywhere, Sam. Im not going hunting. I’m getting Cas back. And I might not go hunting after that either.”
«We made it, love. We made it.» Cas had whispered. Sam and Eileen were too caught up in admiring the memories turned to pictures to register what was happening behind them, but Jack heard him. Cas smiled at them over Dean´s head. «It’s
«Back. Now.» With that Dean gets into the car, starting the engine, waiting for the others to get settled before he races out of the parking lot, out of town. Onto the road.
“Okay... I take it you and Cas had a good time yesterday?” Sam moves to sit down opposite his brother, and just a second after he sits by the table, Cas walks in, a shy smile on his lips as his eyes meet Deans. He’s wearing one of Dean's black hoodies, his hair also newly showered. They stare at each other for a long moment, just like they always do, making everyone present almost uncomfortable because of the
«Dean. Stop overthinking everything. You are getting married. You are getting married to the man you’ve been in love with since you first met him. You are getting married to the man who loves you beyond… everything.»
«I´m going to tell you I love you until I take my last breath, and there is absolutely no way you can stop me. Not even if you kill me yourself, will I stop saying it. These three words will be the last words from my lips, so nothing will ever again stop me from telling you I love you, whenever I want to. And I want to. You make the words easy for me to say, and I love you even more for that, each time I speak them out loud. You make me want to live Cas, not just survive, get through the day.... but
As the world stops, everyone else in the room disappears and he and Cas are the only ones left in the universe. He’s not nervous anymore. He’s not scared of anything anymore. The ceremony goes by too fast, but also too slow. Dean can’t take his eyes of Cas, whose eyes never leave Dean´s either.
And yet, when Dean finally had the chance to say it all, his whole brain went numb. Not a single word forming as he sat there in the dungeon, staring at the other man. He couldn’t tear his eyes off the angel, and yet, not a single word left him.
, he gives him an annoyed look and rolls his eyes, quickly standing up to get himself something for breakfast.
«Come on, angel. We should get some sleep.» Dean pulls him from the couch, leading them down the hall to his bedroom.
Dean curses the nights for not being longer. Curses the days for being too long, only ever wanting to go back to holding Cas. He curses himself for not being able to control his feelings towards his best friend. He curses himself for not being able to put words to his feelings. He curses himself for not being brave enough to tell him.
“The way you say my name. Only Dean says my name like that.” Cas smiles sadly at Dean as some kind of realization crosses his eyes. “You shouldn’t have come for me.”
«Dean?» Cas knows him all too well, in fact, there is no human or creature or being in the whole universe who knows him better than Cas. So of course Cas can read him. «What are you going to do?»
When he rounds the corner, he sees Cas departing from Dean's room, or now it was really their bedroom. Miracle is close by Cas’s feet, always staying close to his new favorite family member. Mir had fallen completely in love with Cas the moment they had met, and sometimes it almost made Dean a little jealous. As Mir sees Dean she runs over excepting to be greeted by a hug, as Dean always gives him. Dressed in one of Dean's slightly oversized hoodies, Cas turns his face down the hallway where he finally spots Dean coming towards him.
The darkness of the garage blinds him after having spent hours in the late afternoon sun, driving around with nowhere as a goal. Dean parks Baby on her usual spot, the main spot at the center, of the bunkers first level where all the cars are kept. His eyes fall to the far corner where the light is even dimmer than where he sits in the impala, where a car is hidden behind some tool cabinets. The gold-colored 1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V was covered up with a white sheet years ago. The car hadn’t been used for a long time, and Dean doesn’t even know if anyone else knows it’s there. After Cas was freed from Lucifer, he made no effort to recover the car, but Dean had brought it home anyway, without anyone knowing. Cas had eventually replaced it by using other trucks, some stolen, some from the bunker's garage.
The third time he saw it the moment Dean got close enough. The eyes. They were the wrong shade of green. And they did not shift in the same way the real Dean´s eyes did.
The sun is high in the sky, small strays dancing through the branches and leaves of the huge weeping willow tree above them. Sam watches his brother looking through the old journal their father left them all those years ago. He smiles to himself, glad to see his big brother finally outside the bunker, focusing on something other than the grief he so hard tries to hide from him. Sam turns back to the map in front of him, spread over the hood of the impala.
«I do.» Dean is so mesmerized by the man standing in front of him that he almost loses his ability to speak, to breathe. But as it's his turn, the words clearly echoes through the room. The ring fits perfectly.
Dean had loved the angel for so long he couldn’t remember when or how it happened. But he’d always loved him from afar. Loved him in silence. And that had always been enough for him. He knew he could never have him, and he had learned to be okay with that. Just the fact that he was allowed to love him at all, keep him close, be his family. It was enough for Dean.
«We could, but I’m not giving up my spot. He just wants you all to himself and I am not gonna let him have you.» Pulling Cas close to his chest, away from Mir, Dean teasingly smiles at the dog as Mir tries to make Cas hold him again. «You can have him while I’m at work, Mir. And we can share him when I get home. But at night, he’s all mine.»
Sometimes they would talk in quiet whispers to each other for hours. Sometimes Dean was eager to show Cas one of his favorite movies, having them sitting or laying closely beside each other either in the living room or in Dean's own ‘cave’. Hands always somehow touching the other.
Sam stands there crying, the only thing holding up his big brother. His hero. He stopped breathing several minutes ago. The last tear dried up, on its way down his beautiful face. His green eyes never to see the sun again. His brother. Dean. Gone.
Jack came and went whenever they could, joining them for dinner in the bunker, movie nights in the living room. Jack didn’t stay for long, as they were busy rebuilding heaven, fixing what Chuck had ruined or broken. Making a better world. Sam couldn’t be more proud. The world was safe, in the hands of a God with a heart as good as Jacks.
At first, Cas is too shocked by the action that he freezes, but when it’s clear that Dean isn’t pulling away, Cas finally leans into the kiss, melting against him. He reaches up to hold on to the hand Dean is resting against Cas’s face.
Cas would sometimes join him or Eileen on some of the basic hunts, the quick and easy ones, but nothing big or too far away. Sam suspected Dean might have something to do with that. He knew how protective his brother was about Cas, he always had been. And now that Dean had gotten him back, finally got what he had wanted for so long, he for sure refused to lose that to a stupid hunt.
The room is small but divided into two separate bedrooms, with one bed in each. Only one of the beds are empty when Dean and Cas arrives.
A little more awake now, Cas chuckles against Dean's chest, his warm breath tickling his bare skin. «I told you.»
Back in the bunker, everything is the same as before, but after they have all gone to bed that night, Dean can’t sleep, as his room no longer brings him peaceful nights.
Turning over on his side, he studies the angel for a long moment. Memorizing the peaceful expression of sleep. But not for too long. He’s not leaving this room until he’s said his words. Even if there is lasagna and pie at stake.
It's almost a little comical. The New God sitting in a bunker, comforting a broken man that once was the most faithless of them all. Dean was a fallen and broken man afraid of faith, who fell in love with a fallen angel driven by faith and fear of falling. They had both fallen into and from faith, both somehow healing each other as they fell together.
«Yes, you are. Especially when you are in love…» he drags the last word out teasingly, laughing as Dean raises his middle finger towards him.
He slowly manages to pull away from him, quietly standing from the bed, looking back at the still sleeping man in his bed.
However, now the longing looks were answered. They didn’t turn away when the other caught them watching. The touches always leaving a fire around them, a fire they didn’t hide anymore. But they were still Dean and Cas. Dean very obviously in love with Cas. And Cas clearly in love with Dean. So sometimes Sam was still surprised when he’d catch them kissing in the hallways, laying very close together on the couch, standing close in tight embraces.
«Castiel. I have to tell you something.» Eyes still closed, Cas can feel Dean's hands cupping his face, his body moving closer to his so that they are standing as close as possible. «I should have told you a long time ago. I should have told you that night. I know I’m late, I’m sorry.»
Dean can hear every word, but he’s too distracted by the sight of his true angel form and although no human should be able to see him, Dean does.
“What?” Looking back at Cas in confusion, Dean goes suddenly still, his nervous hands falling to his sides.
At the look his brother gives him, he adds, a little too harsh «I don’t wanna talk about it so stop looking at me like that.»
«Cas! There you are! I've been looking for you. I’m here to bring you home.» Dean took another step forward. As he came closer, Dean rested a hand on Cas´s shoulder. Even his touch felt wrong.
“I’m glad I didn’t. If I did I would’ve never gotten to witness the most beautiful being in the entire universe.”
He smiles down at his wonderfully beautiful girlfriend. Pulling back slightly, he raises his hand to sign
Knowing this wasn’t his Dean, standing in front of him, Cas also noticed that the Shadow got another thing wrong. Dean never called him by his full name when he was speaking directly to him. To Dean, Cas was always `Cas´. And the way the Shadow said his name was wrong too.
Awake before Sam and Cas, Dean leaves to get breakfast the next day, but before he leaves their bed, he gently presses his lips against Cas´s. The angel doesn’t wake, but Dean thinks he can see a small smile on his lips as he pulls away, reluctantly leaving the warmth of their embrace. He’s smiling all day. In a better mood than he has been in for a long time. A smile spreads across Cas’s lips too, each time their eyes meet.
«Yes, he’s ready.» Sam stands to walk over to his girlfriend, kissing her gently before turning back to Dean, looking expectantly at him.
«I just... I had to get him back first, Sammy. I had to tell him. I know I have a family here, I know I have you. But I don’t think I would be able to live without
“Dean Winchester himself. Losing himself in the void of darkness, only to get his hands on one insignificant trench-coat-wearing angel.”
He didn’t really know how to tell Sam all of this. Sam had been the one to want a normal life, but now he was the one who wanted to be a hunter. Dean had been the one who wanted to spend his life hunting, or at least he was the one destined to be a hunter, but now all he wanted was a peaceful life. Not normal, his life would never be normal. But peaceful. He wanted to know how a peaceful life would look like.
“You called?” A voice suddenly speaks from behind Dean. When he raises and turns around he almost falls to the ground again. In front of Dean, another Dean is standing in the darkness. Same face. Same clothes as he’s wearing himself at the moment.
«Nope.» Cas reaches over, pulling Dean's hand into his lap, holding on to it gently as he strokes the back of his hand.
Or when Dean had hurt his ankle after being carelessly climbing onto a shelf in their garage, tripping the whole thing over. Cas had been mad at how careless he could be, angry that he couldn’t heal him anymore. They’d started bickering about how the other was careless, and how the other had no way of protecting them if they kept being reckless. Sam had laughed when he came into the kitchen and heard them fighting about who gets to love and protect the other the most. They didn’t talk much that night either, communicating only in small, short, flat words. Silence treatment seemed to be their specialty. Later that day when they cleaned up after dinner, Sam saw the hand Dean placed on Cas's lower back when he passed him to get to the sink. How Cas had placed his hand on Dean's shoulder, his thumb stroking his neck, for a moment when they walked down the hall to Dean's “cave” that he had made into a private living room or movie room for him and Cas. When Sam was on his way from the living room to his own room that night, he had passed their slightly open bedroom, and as he quietly slipped past, Sam had heard them saying good night to each other with sweet words to make up for the silence.
Dean is almost running now. He screams his name inside his head. He won’t speak until he has him in his arms. He can’t risk waking the Shadow just yet. But he screams Cas’s name as a prayer.
Jack takes in the sight of their fathers for a moment before they turn around and heads in a different direction, disappearing unnoticed around a corner. Jack is still smiling as they reach the living room, joining Eileen and Sam in front of the television in their living room. And as they sit down, Miracle comes running over from his resting place by the fire. He jumps onto Jack's lap, getting comfortable. His beautiful dark eyes staring up at theirs as he waits for Jack to hug and cuddle him.
«What are you talking about, Castiel?» Cas almost wants to laugh at how wrong the Shadow gets Dean, but still, it´s so close that one day, Cas knows it will break him.
He almost felt a little sad when they returned to the bunker the next day, and as he went to bed that night the longing for Cas to lay beside him was almost unbearable. He found himself really looking forward to their next long hunting trip as his nights alone in his bedroom always left him waking several times during the night.
And still. It was Dean standing there. Even if the Shadow didn’t get everything right. It was still him.
«Did we stay here all night?» Cas mumbles quietly against his neck, his nose trailing soft paths along his neck, eyes now closed against the day.
Like how Cas had a soft and ticklish spot behind his right ear, not the left one but the right one, where, when Dean kissed him gently, he would make this small adorable almost giggly sound, before leaning into the kiss.
When it's time to leave the town, heading back home to the bunker, they are all tired after today's case. Dean only has eyes for Cas, so without looking at his brother over the roof of the impala, Dean points to the back seat.
Cas had stopped Dean from saying the words to him that day because if he had, he most likely would have been taken by the Empty right there. Because the angel felt the same way. He had probably felt Dean's feelings bleeding through that prayer, and get scared at the thought of Dean telling him something that would get him killed. Because he felt the same way. Dean doesn't know if Cas knew about his true feelings since he said he could never have him, but somehow Cas must have felt something that made him stop those words.
Dean cups his face, leaning their foreheads together. Actually enjoying the silence, he closes his eyes and gently brushes his lips against the other man’s. His other hand grabs his arm, but as he brushes against his elbow, Cas faintly groans as if in pain.
He knew that Dean was very protective over Cas, he always had been, but now more than ever. Sam understood that perfectly. The way he had felt when his relationship with Eileen was still fresh. How he was so protective. It was in Dean's nature to be protective of the people he loved, he’d been like that with Sam all his life, so he wasn’t really surprised. They didn’t hide, but Sam had noticed how they were more careful around the others in the bunker. In front of Sam and Eileen, they seemed to feel safer, but with the others, they were more subtle. When he had pointed it out to Eileen she had told him how she could see the protectiveness in them both, when others were present. How they liked to keep to themselves, not showcasing their feelings.
«I love you too, you stupid son of a bitch. I’m coming for you, you’re not getting away from me ever again. You hear that Cas?» He said to the dark of his bedroom with a low and somber voice, before finally rising from his bed to start the day. «I’m gonna bring you home.»
Slowly pulling back from his kisses, Dean stares at the angel, a satisfied smile playing on his lips as Cas slowly opens his eyes to search for where the soft lips went. Faces still close, they share a long look, just staring at each other with a loving look so familiar for both, and yet neither of them has been able to see it for what it was, before now.
«You know, there’s this saying that freckles are really kisses from angels…» Dean has to chuckle as he watches Cas blush at his words. His blue eyes shining brightly.
“Lasagna. And there might be some pie for dessert.” Sam smiles as Dean's face lit up with an even brighter smile. Eileen's famous lasagna has become a favorite in the bunker, and Dean never passes an opportunity to eat the best lasagna he knows. Sam takes the smile as a yes, and closes the door, leaving Dean to wake Cas.
He could feel tears streaming down his face as he smiled into the kiss. Deepening the kiss and tightening his grip on the angel.
But sometimes, he would wake in the middle of the night and feel a presence in the room. He never had to turn over to know that the angel was sitting in the chair in the corner, and Dean came to long for Cas to stay with him like that. He never dared imagine anything else though, as he knew it would hurt more than the moment of joy it would bring him. Dean knew nothing would ever happen between the two, as Cas was a cosmic being, and Dean wasn’t exactly a lovable person. But he would dream and wish for just the presence of his best friend. Having him beside him like that was better than nothing at all.
When Cas had been controlled by Naomi, and he was about to kill Dean. When Dean was pleading for Cas to fight it, to fight back, he had almost said the words. The words had been on his lips, but they were never spoken. And then Cas broke free, something had broken the connection, and Dean almost, for a moment, though maybe his feelings were returned. He almost said the words then, but he was too much of a coward. So he tucked them away, both the feelings and the words.
“You can’t keep us here. Humans doesn’t belong here. So you have to send us back. And if you don’t. Jack will come for another visit.” Dean can see that the name has an effect on the Shadow.
Dean isn’t gone for long, but as he returns to his bedroom, hands nervously carrying a tray with two plates filled with food, Cas is already sound asleep. He sets down the tray on his desk, moving to spread his blanket over the resting body. Dean's hand lingers by his face, gently stroking it before he takes some of the food from his plate.
«CAS! Good morn…» Dean wakes to the sound of his brother storming into Cas´s bedroom, not bothering to knock.
«Castiel!» Cas sits up at the sound of his name, looking around to find the source. A few moments pass where he sits there, staring at the emptiness before he can see a figure in the distance.
«He thinks he’s funny.» Dean rolls his eyes as he closes the door behind Cas, who has suddenly turned shy, seeming to not know what to do with himself. Dean has to smile at how
With an encouraging smile from his brother, Dean surprises himself even more as he pours his heart out.
“I...” Cas turned his head towards Dean, watching him for a moment so long that Sam uncomfortable shifts on the bed as he clears his throat, snapping them out of their haze. “It couldn’t put me to sleep.”
«He told you. Didn’t he? And judging by the regret that’s written all over your heart and the grief of your soul, I guess you didn’t get the chance to tell him?» At that Dean finally meets their eyes, his own going wide at the realization that Jack knew.
Only casting a quick look towards his brother, who was still snoring into his pillow, Dean hurried to the bathroom. He had to take a shower. A cold one.
And then almost inaudible he’d heard them whispering a sweet “I love you” to each other. So, Dean and Cas might not showcase their feelings the same way the other couples in the bunker did, but the way they showed their love through the simplest things, the smallest gestures, were just as beautiful, if not more.
The first page is almost completely covered in black ink. The next is the same, except there are some spots on the almost white paper still visible. The third page is also covered in ink, but the fourth one holds two words on the center of the page:
“Good. Because I won’t let you. I’ll follow you wherever you go.” With tears now streaming down his face, Dean leans closer. At first, their lips only brush against each other in a whisper of a kiss.
«I’ve noticed you two spending much more time together, just the two of you… Always by each other’s side, more than usual...» he let the words hang in the air between them.
Cas leaves the bunker and doesn’t return until the dark sets in, walking past their living room with a quick “good night” before locking himself in his room.
He heard them from Cas just as often as he himself uttered them. He tasted them on his lips with each kiss. His blue eyes shining and screaming the words.
«I never did doubt it, Dean. You were the one who did.» Jack smiles a sad smile at him as they scratch the fluffy dog that sits beside him. «Cas has been my father since before I was born, but you too have been my father, ever since I was born. And I never doubted your love, even when you tried to hide it, your love bled through. Yes, I tried hard to make you show it sometimes. But just because you didn’t show it, doesn’t mean I didn’t know it was there.»
“No, I don’t think I do.” Dean laughs at her fondly before turning all his attention back to the food.
Dean's hands keep exploring Cas´s back, his skin warm against his cold fingers. Arms locking him tight in his embrace. He needs him closer. Closer. Closer. He can’t get him close enough. Can’t get enough of him. The want, the need, for the other man's touches, kisses, love, is almost dizzying for Dean. His mind only ever focused on those lips.
“I mean it, I’ll come back again, and again, and again. I’ll make sure you never sleep again in your miserable existence. I’ll come back to torture you while keeping you awake. Until you give me my angel back.”
Having been on the road for almost a week now, with Eileen, Sam couldn’t help but think back at how this used to be their life. The road had never been safe. Never welcoming. But always home. He still enjoyed the road, on occasion. But it was no longer home. No longer a highway without a destination. Their family, the family they had made along the way, that was their home now.
beds, having left on a small bedside lamp to bathe the room in a faint glow. Dean stopped short as he realized the room didn’t have an extra room. Only a small bathroom. No sofa bed either.
The dog, who had been eyeing them, comes closer, clearly curious. The movement catches Dean's attention and as he turns his face to the dog, the animal launches himself into Dean's lap. Greeting Dean with a wet kiss, the dog barks happily. Dean smiles at the dog, his hand leaving Cas’s face to hug the dog.
“Dean...?” His voice is only a small and hoarse whisper in the darkness. At the sound of his voice, Dean can’t hold himself back anymore and throws his arm around the angel, embracing him for a long moment. He doesn’t want to let go of the angel, but they aren’t safe yet.
«Definitely. But we should probably be on our way soon.» Dean smiles, giving his man one last kiss before they start to rise from their comfortable positions.
