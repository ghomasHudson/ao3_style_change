He felt dirty, getting off watching his own self cram his belly with liquid, stuffing himself over-full while his belly still sat round and packed on his thighs an hour later. He’d never seen what he really looked like before – not like that, not from an outside perspective. He gaped at himself now, at the obscene full curve of his belly hanging between his hips on the screen, stretching the pulling skin around his sides, bursting round from his chest. He’d never seen his belly push that far out from his body before, weighing him down, growing and massive and bursting until it didn’t even look like a part of his own body –
“Why are you holding it in?” Sherlock whispered. He rested his hands along the lowest part of John’s belly, the part of his stomach that he couldn’t suck in flat no matter how hard he tried. It bulged underneath Sherlock’s hands, puffing out his two layers of shirts.
He was completely helpless, barely able to move, weighted down with the bloated belly he’d made. The one he was holding in his hands, rubbing to try and soothe. He watched his arms reach forward to try and hold it up, the way it ballooned out from his body farther than he’d ever even though possible. More massive and round than any belly he’d ever seen in other videos online.
Sherlock bit his lip and grunted, desperate to see the bare skin of the man’s belly before he came. He held his hand back from pumping wildly over his cock, trembling where he gripped his erection in his hand.
But it wasn’t really gone, though, was it? He did still have it – that perfect moment. He still had the video . . .
Sherlock moaned behind him and pressed his whole palms against John’s stomach. There already wasn’t very much give, and John shivered. Sherlock cupped John’s new belly in his hands. “You’re already so big today,” he whispered.
“Fuck,” the man moaned under his breath. He finished the last swallow, wincing and gasping for breath, then dropped the empty carton to the floor and clutched his belly with both hands. He arched his back as far as it could go, looking down at his huge stomach held between his palms. “Fuck, fuck,” he whispered again while he rubbed his round sides.
When Sherlock was halfway through feeding him, John held up a hand to pause. He looked down and held his aching belly in both hands, lightly rubbing his fingers along his stretched skin to try and soothe it. He reached around to try and feel his navel, stretched tight and round from the pressure of the churning mass of food and water in his stomach.
He forced himself not to look away. He rubbed his hands over his belly, watching himself, then he arched his back and moaned. “Look at it,” he breathed. He pressed his belly farther into his hands, watching himself touch his skin. “You’re too stuffed to move. . .” he whispered, holding his gaze in the mirror. “Can’t even walk. Can’t even breathe. . .”
this. He didn’t keep himself stuffed full for so long after he orgasmed and shut the camera off, and he didn’t go on drinking even more water while he sat there editing and uploading the video afterwards, and he sure as hell didn’t go back and re-watch his own bloody videos, getting off at the sight of his own body ballooning under his hands, whimpering at the pain he could still feel dully aching through his packed gut.
With about five swallows left in the bottle, he started to feel dizzy. He leaned his full weight against the wall. He was too filled, to stuffed . . .
He drained the glass, and Sherlock quickly refilled it. John could see as he drank that Sherlock was looking down at both of their stomachs, watching as John’s slowly filled out more against his. Sherlock pulled him gently closer by his hips, close enough that John’s stomach started to pang a little as it pressed inwards from the pressure.
“Made yourself burst . . .”
Sherlock was instantly hard beneath his palm.
He saw himself in the mirror. His mouth dropped open.
Finally John pressed a last kiss to Sherlock’s lips and stepped back. Sherlock reached for John’s jumper lying on the couch to hand to him, but John waved it away. Instead he turned and walked towards the kitchen, letting his belly hang full and heavy ahead of him as he loosened his muscles, feeling the delicious way it waddled as it led the way into the room. He moaned for full effect as he moved, then turned to the side and rubbed along his full belly for Sherlock to see.
“God, yeah,” the man breathed, so quietly Sherlock barely noticed he even made a sound. The man rolled his head back on his neck as he kept rubbing his stomach, slowly, as if he had all the time in the world. Finally, he looked back down and gave the top of his stomach a small pat, right over the tight curve which jutted out to the roundest swell of his belly. He placed his palm on the curve and rubbed his thumb once where his navel would be under his shirt, then he reached forward again, grabbed another full gallon that had been hiding off camera, and, without any fanfare at all, brought the new one to his lips.
,” he’d said, clutching his belly. “Can’t move. I’m gonna. . . oh Christ. . . I’m so full –”
John leaned back in his chair and peered over the huge crest of his stomach.
Sherlock’s hands were on his shoulders, guiding him back with a grunt until he was once again leaning back against the headboard with his stomach resting hot and heavy on his thighs. John whimpered when Sherlock reached around the swollen curve of his belly and below the waistband of his sweatpants, grasping his half-hard cock in his hand and pumping it quickly back to hardness.
And so John did something he’d never, ever done before. He scrolled back up to the top of the page, clicked on the start of his own video, and pressed play.
It was beautiful.
With a cry, John suddenly came into his hand, longer and harder than any stuffing orgasm he’d ever had before. He watched himself come over his fingers, spewing down onto the floor. He clutched his belly with his other hand as it clenched and ached, painfully stretched with cramps as his orgasm shot up his spine.
It was him, really him. It was him, John Watson, naked, and erect, and swollen beyond his control, aching at the weight of the belly he’d stuffed himself with, unable even to suck it in.
He raised the bottle back to his mouth and continued, fighting past the aching clenching of his belly as it tried to resist the addition of anything more. He held the liter bottle with both hands, letting his belly hang free and heavy in front of him into Sherlock’s eager hands. They rubbed over the tight crest of his rounded stomach, lightly scratched his stretched sides and traced around his navel.
And he also knew, better than he’d known anything for a long time, that he wouldn’t be posting any more videos to his channel. That he wouldn't be anxiously filming, or editing, or covering his face.
He paused and looked to the side. He was perfectly round. Sherlock’s hands dipped below the lowest curve of his belly and held some of his weight. John looked down and only saw a vast expanse of white skin. He touched his stretched side with trembling fingers and groaned at the feeling of himself, taut and hot and aching. He kept his hand there and continued to drink, feeling his belly stretch beneath his hand with every swallow.
He was done.
“God, I’m so full,” the man, the killer, had groaned, fake and theatrical and ridiculous and . . .
It had taken Sherlock almost a full twenty seconds to realize that the man in the video – his now confirmed killer – was rubbing an enormous belly with both of his hands while he loudly moaned, leaning back in the chair so his full skin stretched round and tight.
He’d held out, though, longer and fuller than he ever had before. It was the first time he’d ever dared show himself touching his own erection at the end of one of his videos. He always masturbated at the end, sure. That was the whole point for him. To look down at himself, bursting and huge, and come while his stomach pressed out and cramped at the contracting wave from between his thighs. But he always cut that part out of the footage and immediately deleted it right after, without even watching. Actually, he never watched any of it at all.
''And more than that. It's, well, you are obviously struggling with something huge, and it's unnerving others. I know you are brilliant-''
''Perforated ulcer,'' I say grimly, ''You collapsed at the Yard. They called the ambulance.''
And he's likely as confused as I am. I doubt his own draw to this way of being makes any sort of logical sense to him, either.
An increasingly common state for me, and one I seem to have no control over any longer.
All I did was remind him of horrible things. Horrible events.
I pushed him. Far too much, and far too quickly.
''Just a nightmare. Just a weird dream.''
Of course, I don't know HOW I can stop it.
I stare at him with a feigned composure.
"I get it. Do you remember anything else?"
I take in a breath, hold it. My heart is pounding violently against my ribcage.
That's shame.
''Who says they can't be a friend?''
His voice sounded almost as if it belonged to a different person. This wasn't a Sherlock I had ever seen before, never imagined existed.
''Good. No suicidal ideation. Great, actually. What else can I add?''
Why did I have to be so impulsive with my words?
''I don't know,'' he whispers, his eyes wide, imploring me to believe him. ''But I'm not ever going to do it again. I promise.''
Mrs. Hudson flinches, takes a step back.
''Sherlock-''
I want John to laugh. I want him to at least smile.
From there, he walked into his enclosed bathroom, and turned on the light which queued the fan to kick in.
''One second,'' I mutter and retrieve the mobile from my pocket.
Life? Stop being so hectic now, okay? Life? Okay? Okay?
I try to sleep.
If he wants to strong-arm his little brother into some shark-black car and whisk him away to a care facility, or whatever the hell it is that Mycroft has in mind for Sherlock - I'm not going to step in.
It would have been relatively fast.
“Up for a little one-on-one time with my favourite doctor?,” he smirks before grabbing a lime jujube, devouring it, and wagging his eyebrows suggestively.
“Christ, John, look at you,” Sherlock whispered from over his shoulder. John felt Sherlock’s growing erection firm and warm in the dip of his lower back. Sherlock covered John’s hands with his own and pressed, groaning when John’s skin didn’t have much give. “Think of how full you want to be,” he said. “How full and huge and heavy you can grow.”
He could feel the blush spreading across his face as he allowed himself to keep watching. He saw his belly expanding into his palm, watched his body cramp and swell as he swallowed down one gallon after another. The memory of how it had felt – that building pressure behind his navel, stretching his sides, crushing his lungs – sang once again through his muscles, and he held his stomach in both hands, rubbing the sides, as he watched the video of himself moaning, gasping for air, nearly five minutes in and hardly able to stand.
The t-shirt looked like it was ready to rip. The man’s navel was fully extended now, bursting out against the tight fabric which was cutting into his skin. His jeans were slung low across his hips, and his belly was starting to spill over the front, bursting out for more space.
The video began on just the plain white wall. Sherlock held his breath, waiting for the man to appear. When he did, he walked slowly into frame with his shirt pulled down, looking down at his feet so the hat brim shielded his face. His stomach was nearly flat beneath the shirt – just a tiny, soft bulge that barely revealed itself. Nothing that would indicate that what Sherlock had seen in the video’s thumbnail was about to happen. Nothing at all.
He attacked his stretched navel with his fingers, rubbing the swollen nub as he breathlessly whined, barely able to reach it around the huge mass of his belly.
John’s belly started to ache as he drank the water slowly, letting each swallow settle before tipping his head back for more. He let himself completely relax against Sherlock, curving his back and pushing his belly forward in front of him into the room as it swelled. Completely exposed and cresting away from his body in a round, growing curve.
He looked down at himself and held his stomach in his hands. “Christ, look what I’ve done,” he whispered. His own voice sounded too loud in the room. The thought of it, the thought of his shameful secret, bursting himself, filled his cock even more. It bobbed as he tried to breathe, weighted down by his hanging belly.
“Shit,” he breathed. He rubbed the aching skin, wincing at the pain, then brought the bottle back to his lips. He felt like he would burst, like his body had grown and grown until there wasn’t any more room, any capacity.
All of them titled simply the date they were taken, and all of them exactly three months apart. Sherlock could see, easily, the progress of how the man’s capacity had grown over the last three years, from the first video where his belly looked simply round after a full meal, to this last one, where he looked overly pregnant and struggling to remain standing.
Sherlock’s breathing was loud and raspy. John’s stomach was stretched unbelievably full, jutting out and tight against Sherlock’s palms. The pressure under his skin was immense, making him feel almost unable to move as every inch of his belly filled and expanded, swelling until his stretched thin skin couldn’t grow any tighter or rounder.
''Sherlock, listen - it's just an invite. I get it; you're busy. No worries. Maybe another time?,'' I responded with greater speed than I normally would, if only because he sounded so damn stressed.
He refused to stop and think of how ludicrous this all was as he closed his laptop and walked into the kitchen. He was waddling, he knew. He could feel the way his belly was hanging heavily off his front, making him have to lean back just to stay standing, and his hand rubbed the bottom of his stomach to try and fend off the cramping as he opened random cupboards, looking for something, anything.
Last night he’d felt stretched and tight and huge – ready to burst. Completely full and packed and thrumming with warmth and the desire to grow even fuller. To see how far he could push into Sherlock’s waiting hands.
I suddenly feel a little lightheaded.
His head comes to rest against the crux of my neck, hot, sickening breaths as if he's struggling for air.
My thoughts race.
''Nothing about you is ugly, love,'' I say, my body aching with sadness. ''You're beautiful to me. But I think you are a little confused right now. About who you need to be, what you need to do-''
----------------------------------------------
Yet, it seems to ring true here.
''Sherlock?,'' Sally says rapidly, her voice tinged with alarm.
'Just to review some basic topics.'
The Martian will never hear if I scream in my head.
John hasn't done anything to me; he's only ever done everything for me that could indicate concern and friendship and loyalty.
I get up to move. My stomach is constricted and I feel antsy, filled with adrenaline.
Sherlock mimics my actions and entwines his fingers, then splays them across his knees.
I nod.
I'm just looking to get out of here.
Now, the trees held shimmering promises of green and brown. Now the trees seemed like they could be real, true lifeforms. Not merely black and white nerves, burnt-out against a faded, anemic landscape.
So I reach across the short distance of separation and grab hold of Sherlock's limbs and pull him to his feet.
Intake details:
''Call John. Ask him to come here. He'll be relieved - I promise you he will, Sherlock. He'll be so relieved that you called, and we can work through the next step together. And you can try some soup, if you want. But I won't force you. And John won't force you either. Okay?''
Sherlock's POV
-------------------------
''Of course,'' he replies. ''That's what it means to be suicidal. Wanting to die. Conceptualizing how and when you will die, by your own hand. Planning it. Committing it is following through on those plans.''
But Toby didn't grasp the torch. He refused to give up his grip on Sherlock's hand.
''You're way too hard on yourself, Watson. Has anyone ever told you that? Come on. Let's meet up. Get a drink. We can talk more, if you'd like?''
Yuri plucks a grape from his own plate and eats it. Chews. Nods as he chews. Swallows, then speaks.
''You'll be fine,'' Sherlock provides calmly a few seconds later, further demonstrating his precognitive abilities.
And all those days of personal suffering get lost in a tide of bleached memory. Days of restricting what he ate, and doing sit ups in his room when I could not see and as such not intervene. Until his spine was bruised and blackened, and until the skin came off and the surrounding flesh began to scar. And those moments become secondary in the scheme of his pain, as something seemingly innocuous. The bruising looked bad, and still does, but it's just a cover for something I will never be able to take in with my sight, which is obviously much worse.
Damnit.
no one to really talk to who understands.
'I can hide. I can stay under your bed and be quiet! No one will know.'
I know this intellectually.
"Sherlock," the tone is brisk this time. Brooking no argument. The firmness makes me feel better. "It doesn't sound like Mycroft exaggerated anything, does it?"
How I wish I could just gouge them right now.
I see him cup her hand in his.
''Is it?,'' I repeat.
He nods, then brings his hand over to his belly. Looks up at me.
Ironically, it was something I would later seek to hide from anyone who might have been able to help me.
Aspects of this chapter are rather graphic sexually (not TOO explicit, but certainly getting there - so please take that into consideration) and the sexual acts in question could be termed ''dubious-con'' or possibly even ''grey non-con'' between Sherlock and Victor.
Mrs. Hudson comes by later, with a bouquet of wildflowers. The two of us are sitting in oversized chairs near a canteen on the second floor.
----------------------------
"I wasn't innocent-"
Until I hear a knock at the door.
''Ok. Let's just address that last point, then. Have you known someone who was mentally ill?''
''It's not just one low night. I've seen people with conditions like yours... felled like trees. It can happen to anyone. Even someone as spectacular as you!''
''And what, pray tell, do you think you have to 'help' me with?''
''Obviously it's not 'done', Sherlock. Or we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.''
I stare at the man in slight disbelief.
'It's okay, buddy. It's okay to be scared about getting big. But what sort of daddy would I be if I didn't help you to grow up?'
"You know what Ovaltine means," I mutter a couple seconds later. I cannot look at John while speaking. Not tonight.
I cat-nap on the sofa. But not before I head back to the kitchenette, meander around, look at the food, decide in advance what to prepare for dinner.
His brow crinkled, but he hurried along - all with his injured hand pressed against his clothing to absorb the blood, and his pale features whitening even further in the setting sun. It gave him a ghostly look - all thin lines and the alabaster skin of someone plagued with consumption, bitterest anxiety in his voice.
I don't get far.
''You called Yuri, huh?''
But I cannot recall whom I was asking for or remember what I needed.
A pause. It's slight - almost not a pause at all - but I sense it. Can feel the reservation he has in even replying.
Just a distant, daily dose of something that used to control how I thought and spoke and acted. And how I planned what to do, and what to say to Mycroft, and what to deny, too.
Follow up recommendations:
''No,'' but he licks his lips quickly. Anxiously. ''No, John. No one-''
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He wads up his scarf and throws it halfheartedly over the sofa.
-----------------------
How do I begin to make sense of it? Break it down, and have it feel real?
Sherlock snorts.
''Okay.''
''Why do you consider John an idealist, Sherlock?''
"Well, we have all the ingredients to make a sauce. We have tomatoes, peppers, onions, butter, cheese... the appropriate herbs."
It scares me more than the weight of my previous depression.
''I won't,'' Sherlock's eyes are wide in alarm, ''Not again.''
''But it's wrong!''
I try to picture that.
''Nothing,'' he says with a sigh, suddenly sounding sad, ''just never seen you in a jumper before,'' and again he makes a little tugging motion on the corner of the garment. Not to...take if off, I realize dumbly. Just a physical reference to what I was wearing, I guess, Just a way to show a form of what - affection?
---------------------------------
And then - remarkably - Toby Thiesen reaches for my hand.
"What's this, then?," and I indicate to his clothes, lightly touching the sleeve of his arm. "You have changed your jumper."
Sherlock, for his part, is waiting for me on the steps outside, hands stuffed into the pockets of his greatcoat, his eyes distant.
I stare at my wrist watch, determining the time, before stretching out my back and arms - leaning away from the chesterfield. Cricking my neck, I hear it pop. I must have fallen asleep in an awkward position; my neck feels stiff.
There is a delay - a tide going out with his words - and coming back with darker water than I would have expected.
His mouth puckers into sick amusement, and a scoffing sound comes choking from his throat. As if he finds the suggestion hilarious and over the top.
''Well,'' I rush on, not wanting to lose this opportunity, ''I'd be looking at more than potassium depletion. The stomach complications would likely be worsening everything, and I want to track B12, iron, potassium - all those things. You will undoubtedly require various supplements. And a nutritionist. You don`t have to go to a clinic, but you have to see a doctor who specializes in helping people with these problems, who can help devise a meal plan to bring your weight up a bit-''
The almost meaningless words.
''Does anything need to change?,'' Yuri asks abruptly, though not unkindly.
Next, he is being led by that same hand and before long he is walked down a trail, near the Thames.
''You're right; I couldn't save him. I knew Adam was sick, and I knew he was purging; I had spent months talking to him by that point, and three weeks before he was to receive inpatient care for his problems - he passed away. It *was* tragic, Sherlock, all the more so as he never intended to die.''
But everything is not alright.
Like he finds this amusing.
So I have no idea why I am nodding. It is probably just automatic by this point.
My eyes move up to look up at him, questioning. Confusion must play across my features.
The roles have suddenly reversed from this morning.
''Okay. Well...can you give me a rundown of what you can eat, currently?''
john would be gentle with his expression of needs,
And obsessively observant.
But I have no idea how Sherlock has come to make sense of his ordeal, and if this could have been part of his worry.
Foghorns had likely wailed in the distance, and most people were probably rushing to take the tube to work. Rushing to get chips with malt vinegar. Rushing to get to the park with their toddlers to feed the fattened ducks, or visiting their aging parents, or even returning overdue library books while counting themselves unlucky for their tardiness.
''Toby started screaming. Thrashing. He tried to bite the doctor. The way I hear it - one moment he's still as a statue, and the next he's screaming bloody murder - clawing at the physician in charge. Sherlock actually got between the doctor and the kid. I just saw the tail end of everything. He looked-''
“How are you feeling, Sherlock? Emotionally, how are you feeling right now?”
'Not good,' my mind chortles. 'Not good at all.'
In all my time as a practicing psychiatrist, I have learned to trust my instincts about patients. And right now my instinct is telling me that not only that Sherlock needs help - both physical and psychological help - but that the greatest challenge I am going to have is not in convincing him of the facts of his sickness. But convincing him that he is a person worthy of health. That he doesn't have to earn a special status, or spot, or be seen as brilliant. But that he matters, period.
Sherlock is glancing about anxiously.
''Odd name, I know. A family name, from the Holmes'. Very old - hundreds of years old, and it had fallen into disuse. I thought it was equally rare to my own, but more than that - I knew it was a name from the family which had once held pride. Sigur, my father, was unaware of the connection and in retrospect, I am glad that he was. Not so attached to the history of his so-called noble bloodline as he wanted to be, I realized later. After the fact. I played it off as something made up, of course. I was fantastically playful when I was small, John. I tried to be given the constraints of how we were raised, anyway.''
Sherlock starts to turn away from me.
Not so present.
And so here I am, after the disgusting events of last night - and he says that? At a time like this? When all I want to do is check into a motel until the images have - possibly (is it possible?) - weakened a bit in his mind? Of a full grown adult, urinating over himself like a newborn. And I must have made noise. I might have even said or shouted something in the first place that alerted him to the situation. What's worse - I have no idea what.
No response.
A slight coil of bitterness and a strangulated rush of anger hits me at once. Bitterness for my friend, for what he experienced, but a sickening anger at myself.
When I look over to John once more, I can see his head is still moving. Oh so slightly.
I try not to look discomfited.
Do I want John to stay with me?
''Yes,'' it breathes, again. ''You are, love. I'm sorry.''
''We did that yesterday,'' he says almost timidly. ''Every day isn't necessary.''
''I'm not *in* pain!,'' he finally utters in whispered harshness, the individual words almost shrill. ''I wish you both would stop talking down to me like I was some pathetic child! I don't need your condescension: I'm not stupid, and I'm not weak!''
Because kids were being abducted.
He looks back down at the sheet of paper, over to Donovan, then back over to me.
He looks up at me quickly, as if jolted.
He flops down on the furniture in a dramatic fashion, lying halfway across the grey fabric, his eyes at half-mast.
My head is spinning.
Sherlock stares at me, confused, but doesn't argue.
''Not going to happen,'' John wheezes. ''I'm not abandoning you when you feel like this.''
Home...
He fills up a tumbler with water. Adds ice.
"And you think, what? The fact that I am angry about what happened to them means something more? Something's wrong with me too? Because I'm Sherlock Holmes, and I'm not supposed to feel anything for anyone?"
''So you and everyone else can stare at me like I'm some kind of...freak?,'' he says in a voice barely tinged with anger.
''His mum put him down for a nap - he's been profoundly exhausted recently - and when he woke up he apparently started to get very scared. Tore his calendar off the wall, and shimmied his way into a crawl space. He won't come out, and when anyone tries to go in after him, he screams bloody murder. Keeps saying, ''Want Sherlock.'' Just your name over and over again. They know that you're under the weather yourself, Sherlock - they just don't know what else to do. I mean-''
He looks at his lap, not at me, but at least it's a start.
Toby grabs my hand, now even more moist and cold than before.
''Did it work?,'' he asks tentatively. ''Did speaking to the counselor make you feel better?''
I wonder if he ever attended a summer camp.
'''So what', Sherlock? So everything! Don't you see what's wrong with this picture?! That's no way anyone in any sane universe treats a person he loves like that! That isn't love, Sherlock! That was never love!''
'''Tight'?,'' I aim to clarify. ''What do you mean by that?''
My stomach is pulsing with adrenaline.
At least, not at that precise moment.
"Do you remember me, Toby?"
At the same time, there are issues here that I need to clarify and discuss with him. Not later this afternoon, or tomorrow, or next week.
Still, I feel stung by John's words. Scared by his passion. The look in his eyes. And his distrust, of me.
He shakes his head morosely, and his voice cracks.
''Meaning what? God - just tell me. I've been through the bloody ringer with him and I have no idea how any of this started - why any of this started! - what triggered it, if I triggered it. We do not need to add psychosis to the mix!''
The impulse to do what he is currently doing has been with him for a long time. Maybe the majority of his adult life.
------------------------------------
''Oh shit,'' Donovan hissed, now seeing what I could see. ''Is that bone?''
''What subjects?,'' he asks quietly, taking another sip.
''Don't bring it up,'' I whisper, my eyes serious.
And a lot of it. But I feel cold.
But he'd be okay.
Lestrade and Sally leave without ado, and close the door.
"We have sauce?," I question. Because - I highly doubt that we do. In fact, I am almost certain that we don't.
''What else?,'' he says, voice full of dread and I pause for a few seconds, confused.
----------------------------
I frown at the reveal, and glance over to my friend, his teeth working at his bottom lip, causing the entire thing to puff and swell and go hot cherry red. His face, already wind chaffed and pale from the low light of the late winter, looks ghostly.
((Thanks for the diligent reading and the supportive comments, you guys. I have some amazing readers, and I don't take your reviews or feedback for granted - please know that)).
Or if I'm going to make him angrier. If he's even angry. Again, I don't know what's really going on; I'll see him at the Yard - working on a case - and he's just the same with Sally, with Anderson (which is borderline obnoxious). He's a little warmer to Molly, or maybe just a little less overtly snarky with her. But all in all? Sometimes it's like nothing has changed.
''Hug people is all you know how to do?,'' he responds just as quietly, aiming for a sarcastic tone and failing miserably. ''And you are still employed as a doctor, how?''
''I am ready to go forward with proceedings that will take the choice, as it may be - of eating or not eating out of my brother's hands, John. But, for obvious reasons I'd rather pursue an avenue less potentially overwhelming for everyone concerned. Not because of my reputation - as Sherlock mistakenly thinks - but because a sectioning request, even rushed, could take longer than I feel would be adequate to address Sherlock's rapid decline in physical and mental health.''
''You know that's not how I think of you. Nor Molly. Please don't run off. You're doing so well.''
Everyone else was meandering about, on their mobiles, trying to reach the EMTs. Trying their best not to look at Toby's broken limb, his bloodied eyes and head.
He compacts himself further, as if to give me space, and I settle down near to him but leave the bedding alone. Leave him to his cocoon. That basic boundary – that physical limit – is one that I feel I need to maintain just as surely as I feel he needs its maintenance.
I try to think back to anything that gives me something to grasp on to - a starting point, a word, something that anchors Sherlock's declining health in chronological time. I can distantly recall Sherlock telling me he weighed ''141, John. My weight is resoundingly stable'' about two years ago. I forget how the conversation came up, but I recall the number. Because I remember thinking at the time that it was a low number, 8 lbs under my own weight back then - despite the fact that I was nearly six inches shorter and therefore, logically, should have weighed even less.
''I can get Jake back here to clean the table,'' he says evenly, reasonably.
''S-shut up, you bastard. I'm drunk, according to you.''
“It’s too bright in here,” he murmurs, wiping at his eyes. “It’s giving me a headache and making my eyes sting.”
Most of whom never suffer from eating disorders in their entire lives.
The less talking, the better.
I feel my eyes crinkle in surprised warmth.
Yuri nods.
I tentatively put my arm around his back, not wanting to spook him.
He steps forward. Two steps. Four. Six steps. Seven.
He turns to me, cocky little grin in place. And part of me wants to smack that look off his face.
''Mhmm,'' he turns onto his back. ''I knew one, actually.''
'It was a fatal-automobile-accident, my dear sir,' my mind supplies, my eyes seizing on all the red, and wanting to think of other topics, other things. Even ridiculous things. 'We're so sorry for your loss, but we couldn't save him.'
''Do you have difficulty processing or understanding feelings, Sherlock?''
Yuri looks surprised, and his eyes narrow slightly.
Sherlock continues to glare.
I give him a look. My heart is rattling around harshly in my chest.
I do this six more time, and eat approximately 1/3 of the sandwich before I look up at John and lick my lips. Try to form a sentence.
But I can hear it.
''Are we going on the boat now?,'' he asks softly. Because this little boy likes boats. He draws them all the time and his mummy affixes them to his bedroom wall with double-sided tape. He has nautical print pajamas, and blue and white piping on his bed spread. He builds models of larger ships with his daddy, too. Some even get placed into green bottles, corked and placed above the fireplace in the McKenzie home. '''Cause I'd really like to go on a boat!''
Just numb.
--------------------------
''He came in. Probably to bug me about the Thiesen case. Probably to check in with that kid,'' he starts dismally, and I nod.
I hesitate, consider lying, then opt for truth.
For several weeks, we played Go, sometimes Chess. I bought him banana nut muffins from the student canteen, and always an extra large biscotti coffee, which I quickly came to realize was his favourite. Black. Two sugars. I deposited them in front of Sherlock when we sat down in the park to play our games, to chat; I felt an abundant happiness when he nibbled at my offerings. As if he were a mercurial God, and I had provideded him a sacrifice of highest quality, which he deemed worthy of consumption.
Please stay, John.
He pulls his legs up to his chest now, and looks over my head. At a spot on the wall.
''Sherlock-,'' and the voice is almost a pant. ''I can't understand this.''
Sherlock flinches.
It truly is one of the scariest and most confounding diseases from my perspective - especially since it seemed so self-directed and controlled; for those reasons alone it filled me with wordless terror.
''Does it matter?! Do you let a person whose cruel around a child whose scared? You don't! Not when you know better!''
''You've always done just fine, there,'' I mutter to him carefully, wanting him to sense that nothing really has to change. Not between us. ''I don't want you to change who you are. I just want you to be the healthiest you can possibly be. I'm not asking for anything more than your best effort to get healthier, okay?''
I ignore the roaring, the fear, the uncertainty.
John returns a second time. Back with fresh pajamas.
''You need some warmer garments,'' I supplied readily, and he frowned, looked up at me sharply. ''Or more padding on your frame. Not sure, really.''
I won't feel absolutely composed no matter what I do, but relatively composed is a massive improvement over how I have felt these last few days.
Sherlock nods dully, as Molly approaches a few seconds later, carrying forward a bowl of salad, tossed, sans dressing.
"Can you just put down the damn drink mix for one bleeding second and deal with this like an adult?!"
Mr. Thiesen stands up.
I read the lettering on the bottom. The old calligraphic writing.
''You didn't get anyone killed-''
''No, not today,'' he says quickly. ''That won't work. I tried, but-''
But he's mentioned this to Mrs. Hudson.
I forbid myself to close my eyes.
''I think I can. I'm just about ready to pass out myself though, Sherlock.''
My hands are still shaking as John departs to the bathroom, only to pad back a few seconds later with a damp wash cloth.
Sherlock smiles back faintly, and it's a relief to see that he's finally coming around. Starting to calm down as he takes off his coat.
'Myco, that's you? I lost a tooth!'
My hands slowed, and I frowned.
One of those hospital grade scales. Black, with a glass top and an electric read out. The tape along the box has been cut, indicating it's been opened. The top flap is also bent indicating it's been pulled out, too.
''You WON'T? You are deranged! I'm calling Inspector Lestrade right now! Don't you dare take one extra step with my child!''
''You were busy talking to Mrs. Hudson,'' he says, and the sound is petulant. Like I had done something wrong in giving him space. ''Busy eating scones and drinking tea.''
''I don't like to think of anyone I like in any way, wanting to do that. Any of that. Because it's wrong.''
''The doctors?''
I find it hurtful.
''I may be new at this, but I think you're supposed to be thinking of me, not them,'' he attempts a mock tone of something skirting jealousy, but his happiness with what we are doing destroys his attempt at acting out any other emotion.
Sherlock shoots up quickly, plops himself down on the sofa. Restless.
A trap. Laying in wait, ready for me to overextend myself and reveal something gritty and juicy and admission-worthy.
John licks his lips.
I cannot have been the only eight year old to have taken a straight razor to my skin, and to have cut open geometric patterns along my legs.
Sherlock takes the paper warily, as if the exercise is a trick. His eyes are scanning my face, roaming over the landscape of my features. Trying to catch the deception.
"How old were you when that happened? When everything 'turned blue'?," I whisper. "How old, Sherlock?"
''What, John?''
''Can you leave me alone, please?,'' I ask carefully, my throat tight.
But he needs to be able to process his emotions, on his own time, and if and when he needs it - in privacy.
My heart is beating double time by the time I get to his room, knocking hastily.
''Sherlock!,'' the voice pants out. This person has raced. Run after me.
"Because it's important. If you get an infection, in a deep glass wound - it could advance quickly. Yellowing is a bad sign too, so I'll apply some Polysporn in a few hours, okay?"
''People are going to think-,'' I say in a whisper. A whisper, but shrill in timbre.
Even I'm not sure.
And why are things so strained?
''That you are gay. That we are involved. That we are partners.''
Taking the lift to the third floor, I get off feeling a little woozy. Start to walk to the right, and watch the numbers fall away. Stop, turn and walk to my left.
‘SH & I discussed feelings, moods. Having substantial issues with organizing thoughts. Feels unsettled. Still won’t address many questions posed. Weight gain is modest but consistent. Exceptional anger when attempt was made to discuss father, brother.’
I can scarcely breathe now, never mind move. I feel absolutely petrified.
Finally, I text back:
All I can see is Harriet. 16 years old. The headmistress of her school talking to my mother in the office; their strident voices streaming under the door, where I could hear, where Harriet could hear. Words like 'delinquent' and 'problem youth' and 'no place for her here' and 'we've had enough of her.' Harriet's eyes lined in red from her noiseless crying. Scratches across her wrists where she dug in out of anxiety, and didn't let go. Her pain at being dismissed as unworthy of additional support.
And what of it?
A moment later, I hear the door to his bedroom slam shut.
The first book that I pick up reads: "Forbidden Relationships: Helping your Partner overcome Childhood Incest" and is a book about, apparently, the romantic issues that often present in a relationship with an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse.
'Concerned.'
I take a sip of my drink.
''You've already played this trick on me!,'' he spits out, stress lining his face.
And part of me knows it, too. Maybe even feels it as truth.
Had I been smarter, I would have drank the pop as I was eating the food.
"That is from your...nursery? Seems a bit-"
I'm not.
''What?''
''Why on earth do you want to know my name?,'' and the lip darted out, moistening the Cupid's bow. I realized he did this a lot, almost like a tic. Nervous, staccato-like.
I shake my head. Because John really won't want to hear the rest.
''Some people? People like you? Oh, like that's nice,'' Sherlock mutters, under his breath.
So I am having difficulty understanding what could be causing him so much fear now. What could have prompted the change in such a relatively small period.
Does it change that title?
Tidy he is not, but he ventures around to my side and helps me put the last of the game into the box before shoving the entire thing under the coffee table. It’s not where it goes either, really, but I know better than to comment. It would fall on deaf ears. Just as would be my request that he put his socks and running kit into the laundry hamper at the end of each run and not leave it nestled between the shower and the toilet.
-----------------------
''Maybe I thought that you don't consider me in need of weight gain at all. That everyone is lying to me. Maybe even you,'' I whisper with hesitation, scared of John's response. ''But that doesn't seem to make too much sense, either, because of the effort others are putting in to get me to eat. So then I thought it must just be the blood work, and if that's the case I can just take potassium pills. I don't need to eat this at all. That's what I thought, and it made me...not want to eat the sandwich at all.''
''My coat is just warm,'' he says a few seconds later, and I frown. This degree of awareness - of needing to smooth out the edges - is something I usually don't see from Sherlock. ''That's it. That's all.''
John looks back to my notebook, flipping through pages and reviewing the previous week of notations.
''I went to see Molly. For...parts. I wanted to start an experiment. Any experiment. Just something...,'' Sherlock trails off.
Thoughts about how John can actually see me if I open my eyes and look at him.
Certainly such a shift will change me as a person. But do I want that? To change on such a grand scale? When I don’t even know what to expect going into the entire endeavor?
''You're very smart,'' Sherlock tries - as if hearing my thoughts - and I know an appeasement when I hear one.
Sherlock snorts. He actually snorts.
I try to wet my mouth again. Mycroft - discerning my issue - nudges the paper cup of vending machine coffee towards me, which I accept numbly.
Or how - on days like this when he eats a little, and doesn't seem too morose - I almost want to say, 'screw it, Sherlock. Do what you want!'
''Tough,'' I growl, the anger that I had been keeping bottled up for three days now threatening to be exposed. ''You need to talk about this, so we are damn well going to talk about it. About what you did to yourself. Especially since you had me to come to; you weren't alone. I would have helped you in any way I could have!''
''In a manner of speaking. The case is now in the so-called 'highly capable' hands of the New Scotland Yard.''
''Stop this,'' I insist, against his ear. ''Please stop.''
His eyes look cloudy and vacant.
Because I want this and I don't want this and I don't know which direction I even want to go, anymore.
''Yes. Good,'' and he repeats the word under his breath several times - 'good' - like a record stuck on the same part of a song. A glitchy cd. Repetition that sounds more pathological than anything else. ''We need to know who Toby could be alone with for any extended period of time, likely each week. Perhaps biweekly. Whomever has hurt this child has done so for awhile, and has likely used fear and threats to keep Toby quiet. Actually, scrap likely: it's almost guaranteed. Hence, the mutism. Usually that sort of relationship doesn't spring up over night.''
Even when Toby shot his arms out into the night air, Sherlock had quickly grasped his hands, quickly made that connection.
''You feel okay?,'' I whisper, taking a seat beside my best friend.
His eyes crumple together, and everything in my being is screaming at me to get him help. I can hear the voice of Mycroft (now even louder than before) reverberating around in my skull. Telling me - more than any other night - that tonight is a definite danger night.
''Nothing wrong?,'' he says, reading between the lines. ''I didn't think Lestrade would be-''
It's hard.
''Just black? Because it's no bother,'' she tests again, and I shake my head.
The suggestion seems to stymie him, and he's quiet for a moment.
''Has he displayed signs of psychosis - at all - while you've been living with him?,'' he questions now, eyes zeroing in on mine.
Because my body and brain associate pain with heat, and heat with comfort?
We're only human.
At that second, it's hard to even think of my problems in their totality, because I can only think of how lucky I am to have him as my friend.
''Ok. I'll go,'' I say weakly. ''I'll try. For you.''
''You said,'' I whisper, looking about for Jake-the-watchful, and realizing he's gone back to the dish-room. ''You said I have to talk to John about something. I don't understand-,'' and my voice breaks off, cleanly. I pause, and reconsider what I need to say. ''What is it that you don't think I have shared with John? What do you think I am hiding?,'' I grit out.
So I look down at my feet, and lift up each sole. Inspect the underside.
Yuri placed his pad of paper and pen off to the side of his desk.
I find myself grinning, despite the gravity of this morning's situation.
Yuri's twiddling his glasses back and forth between his hands. Suddenly, he sighs.
As if my thoughts have woken him, I see his eyelids start to lift.
Patrick gives me cheeky grin at the mention of his insatiable sweet tooth then pulls around an art deco bowl that the two of us purchased on a trip to Chicago several years back to celebrate our 20th anniversary. I can see now that the bowl has had its decorative lemons and pears removed and has become Patrick’s rather expensive candy container, instead.
-----------------------
Then I feel the Martian put his hands on my body. I feel something cold against my backside. I play the numbers game because Myco is too far away. Maybe he can't hear me. He'd come if he could hear me. I hear Myco in my brain. Not the real Myco, the old Myco, from when I was very, very little.
''No! It's not about that!,'' Sherlock seethes, although there is something newly taut in his anger that makes me think that, yes, he's royally pissed at me for those words, too.
He fidgets with the end of his coat sleeve, nervously.
But I don't let myself have this.
For Sherlock it's agony. I can see how badly it taxes his energy.
The fat white feline of earlier has now stuck her head out from behind an oak door, and is crying faintly some more.
The image of Munch's The Scream came to me, unbidden.
''Come on,'' he says with a swallow. ''Come sit down.''
On top of that, he squirted a generous portion of hot sauce over his fare. Which I honestly had not even brought to the table, keeping in mind that with his healing stomach spices should be regulated. If not avoided outright until he was feeling better.
And I knew it was alive, and it was my friend.
''It's just that your plate has more food. I don't understand.''
''I don't know! Maybe! But that's not how I choose to remember what happened!''
John sits front and center, moving slightly to the side when Sherlock deposits his lanky form next to his friend's a few seconds later. I note, with interest, that he took to sitting on the same sofa as John, rather than selecting his own chair off to the side.
''Is that okay?,'' John clarifies, looking almost concerned.
Mycroft suddenly gets up, and grabs his coat from the hall closet - which he applies quickly, sans scarf or gloves.
''Light hurts my eyes.''
Always so damn reasonable.
''I don't know! I have no idea!,'' and his eyes now are wild, if not scared. Almost as if he's scared of his own emotions. ''I don't want to talk about this!''
My throat feels bruised, and I suddenly realize I've said too much. And yet, at the same time - I've hardly said anything. I've hardly done anything to address the years of taunting, of name calling.
''Do you have these dreams a lot?''
----------------------------
''Punch him? Kick him?,'' I try, clarifying.
he couldn't ''comprehend'' this.
The receptionist gives me a glance, nods, and then goes to enter something into the computer. I do my damnedest to resist tapping my foot against the lino.
''No! I know my rights, and I've answered the only two questions that truly need to be fulfilled: 'am I planning to kill myself?', and 'am I planning to hurt anyone else?' - and the answer to both is a no. A resoundingly loud no.''
Sherlock looks wan. His face, additionally, looks thinned out more than it ever has before... The ridgeline of the bones of his face are even more prominent now, and the sunken look around his temples is alarming. Without thinking, truly without thinking, my fingertips connect with the bones and I tentatively feel the temple area of his skull, before lightly stroking down to his cheek, and rubbing the pad of my thumb over his face.
I move quickly into his space, my chest squeezing horribly.
I ignore the bait.
The experience is different this time. I let myself eat and not obsess. I let myself consume, and when the inner harsh words of my mind hiss at me, I redirect my focus onto a standard poodle that has been tied up against one of the bike stands. The animal is sitting in elegant form - its fur slightly matted by the rain, and I watch it yawn in relaxed patience for its guardian to return.
He scowls at me, then brings the cup to his lips. Takes a sip.
Lestrade scratches his neck with his left hand. I suddenly realize that his hair looks different.
''She wasn't sexually assaulted by the perpetrator of her murder, however. Don't muddle issues. This abductor isn't hurting them like that.''
He runs his hands through his hair and I see his jaw clench in upset. If only highlights his weight loss; I can see the ridges of his skull so easily.
Our mother used to play this game every time Harry came home way too late at 15, 16 years of age. Came home smelling like alcohol and sex, only to vomit her guts out all night in the bathroom. My father used to play this game after he'd lose his temper and belt me, and act surprised when I couldn't sit down at the dinner table the next night without wincing.
''What is going on with you now? Because, believe me, your moods are difficult to navigate at the best of times,'' I bark, voice low but direct. I glance around at the dozen or so passengers also awaiting the arrival of the train. ''You up and leave, are gone for HOURS, come back with this sort of attitude-''
Lestrade seems to hesitate next.
Oh, I'm being ridiculous, certainly. If I wanted to find something - some meaning - in Sherlock's every motion, I'm sure my mind could see patterns indicating 'something more' almost everywhere. I could possibly see symbolism in almost everything he does. It doesn't translate into trauma. It doesn't mean all that. I just have to know and accept that people can be quirky, can be different, and if Sherlock is going to admit to anything at all - and to asexuality, in particular - then I might have to accept that it may not be something that was triggered by abuse, either. And maybe that's how I should broach the topic now.
''It feels bigger,'' he whispers, voice almost alarmed. ''And it was just one meal.''
''What were you trying to imply then? Truthfully? That he scared you? That you thought he might hurt you?!''
I charged the books to my debit account rather than paying in cash.
John watches me carefully.
And when I finally sit back down in my seat, and wait for Yuri and Sherlock's return, it's not so much with the faint overwhelm of Sherlock's ire or Yuri's admonishments - but a tremulous hope that everything Sherlock has ever needed is within his grasp - right here in this office.
She doesn't need to explain more, which is lucky - because I don't think she knows how to say what she needs to say in the first place.
A couple minutes pass in complete silence before he speaks again.
''Yes, but that's not even it. That's not even what I meant! I am not easy to like. He should have left a long time ago. But he hasn't. I don't understand why he's still here.''
It's actually making my nervousness worse. More palpable. Harder to dismiss as just being down to our recent awkwardness.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
His voice tangles in his throat. Heavy and strange and knotted.
I approach the reception desk, my heart pounding against my ribcage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I scribble down SHERLOCK in capital letters, and then return the pad of paper to the child.
''It's always sort of been there,'' he mutters, in admittance.
Be well, everyone.
Petulant.
I hear another chuckle.
''You...implied it.''
I continue on - weeks and months of fear and frustration and growing anxiety quieting down as my words take shape.
''Sherlock - please. Say something.''
But right now? My brain is half turned off.
I want to feel that I am not lacking in this regard – not lacking in this measure of sanity.
It's anxiety or something else. Part relief, but definitely nerves.
"No, no. I mean - did he ever see someone? As he got older? Did he ever talk about it properly with a doctor?"
"Does anywhere else hurt?"
''Sherlock?,'' I call out and let my voice ring through the flat. I suddenly sight a mug with about two ounces of goat's milk. There is a line around the glass as I pour the milk down the drain, indicating that the milk was poured probably more than an hour ago and the fat has congealed against the glass.
Sherlock blinks; I see his facial features harden into stone.
Another nod.
-stop it! stop it, sherlock, fucking STOP IT!-
I need him to stop this, because this isn't about trust.
''Just soup,'' John agrees, as I continue to drink it down. By the time I get midway down, I feel perilously close to crying. John must sense this, because he slowly removes the cup away.
I bite my tongue to keep myself from saying anything rash.
He finally sits down at the table looking spent. Drawn and thin. Hollowed out.
Sherlock's breath comes out of his body like a rocket.
"Thank you," I mutter, trying to push a sudden wave of sadness away.
The manicured nails turn up the cream cuffs of his shirt, as if buying time. Formulating a response.
Turns out I don't need to worry about that.
Sherlock blinks at me, his throat still swallowing. He has a wild look in his eyes that I don't like, so I push back against my chair, stand up, and go towards him.
Surely, when I feel angry - when I know I feel anger - I can classify it as anger. The same would apply to all other emotional states.
Lestrade's face immediately shifts. Takes on a sour look.
''You're letting him win,'' he whispers now. ''When you hurt yourself like this, it's like he's winning.''
I realize my hand is bleeding.
Isolating because I know, deep down, what he's doing here. He was feeling wretched. Whether due to a migraine, or just everything else that's happened lately - it would be understandable. I should have surmised that in his quiet moments Sherlock Holmes seeks the comfort of familiar things to soften a dire landscape. Just like someone seeks out a hug when they feel especially starved for physical touch.
''Sherlock,'' I start, wired and almost mad. ''I told you-''
''You really think you'll just be able to say some meaningless assurance to him, and get total clearance again? Are you insane?''
It's not John's voice, however.
''Your view of non-defective is not necessarily my view,'' I start with a cautionary tone to my voice. ''I would like something more specific. What are you looking for, precisely? What do you want in a nutritionist?''
So why did I not ask questions?
I hesitate. Decide that if Lestrade's going to be pissy with me, I'm likely to get irked in response. And John's seen enough of me acting like a child recently.
Sherlock snorts from 'John's chair,' as he calls it. He's now slumped down into it, his legs haphazard, his body deformed.
''Do you see this, Yuri? This is it! It in a nutshell. We talk around this issue, and he never admits to anything. Except rarely, and even then, it's an allusion, not a direct admittance, and I just can't...live in the flat and see him do this to himself any longer. I can't.''
''Then how do I figure this out?,'' he queries, looking lost and burdened.
His heart would have continued to race, until his body went into hypoglycemic shock. Only then would it have started to slow. The organs would have started to fail: irregular heartbeat, faint and thready pulse. At that point he would have likely passed out, or started seizing. Possibly both - one followed by the other.
''I brushed my teeth before you came home, yes.''
And she's even calmer than John.
““Reactive Attachment-,” and I stop with a frown. “Reactive Attachment Disorder is defined as the condition in which individuals have difficulty forming lasting relationships”,” I begin, a lump forming in my throat. I can see passages that John has crossed out. Others that he has underlined in red. He’s been over this a lot, and I hate that too.
At 10:50 pm I finally get in, groaning at the lateness as I rush up the stairs two at a time.
No, Mr. Thiesen is not the predator here. But it's something close to home all the same.
When I get to the living room, I move towards my filing cabinets and open them near-soundlessly. I look through four files, and then look through one at the back, pulling the manila towards me and dropping it on the desk. A multitude of little cards fall out and I pick them up quickly, looking for one that is bent and buttercup yellow.
Sherlock, however, remains behind and gives me a nod before the door shuts. I take in his voice as he leans in closer to the broken woman.
For starters, I learn that many patients healing from such an operation are prone to intense nausea, and often present with dizziness, bloating, weakness, sweating and a rapid heart beat.
Then, I have the task of dealing with my insanity during the period that preceded the calm, which is rarely good. Rarely pretty.
I knew it wasn't healthy, and I certainly knew it wasn't normal. But I didn't know how to speak of it without breaking our general ease.
I suddenly feel lightheaded. And a touch more than upset.
She helps me with a few buttons. Namely because my fingers are trembling, if only slightly.
''What?,'' John asks carefully. His tone is softer.
He used the word 'love.'
Not now.
But the same underlying psychology and pain are probably driving all three of these cravings.
He doesn't say anything for several beats, and then: ''I am wor- I am wondering if I have a personality disorder.''
''What are we watching?,'' I inquire, playing for normalcy.
''I want you to be healthy, Sherlock. I want to help you get to a place where - when you are alone with those memories - your first impulse is to be kind to yourself. Show yourself love. Not make yourself sicker. Not add to the litany of cruelties your body has already been forced to endure since you were practically a baby.''
until you are un-real).
''When a person takes definite, permanent steps to end their life.''
''Yes - I know that,'' he gets out, but his eyes are alight with mischief. I suddenly feel like giggling.
For being so stupid.
I get up, try to move past him. I don't need to hear this.
''Does this feel alright? Me holding you?''
He presses my hand against the ridge of his boxers, edging my fingers underneath the material. I can feel the rougher spokes of pubic hair, the slight damp skin of a man whose fallen asleep in a too-hot sleeping bag.
I do not hug my knees. I keep myself in an upright position. I’m getting better, and part of getting better must be found in riding myself of these childish, impulsive displays of insecurity that have become annoyingly regular as of late.
''You could never understand how anyone could do this to themselves. Why they just wouldn't eat,'' he grinds out. ''Yes. I get it; I'm disordered. I am not-''
7:38 am
----------------------
''Charing Cross.''
My arms want to come up and wind their way around around my torso. To hold everything in.
''Let me see you stripped down to the bone.'' - Depeche Mode, Stripped
Something like relief, maybe.
I do not want to read any more, but I feel I must.
"You shouldn't. Not at all. But many people who have experienced," and I hesitate to name it, I hesitate to call it by its correct name - rape, childhood rape, "abuse, as you did, often feel some measure of shame."
''Did he request to see me alone? Is that why you decided-?,'' and he trails off, his nervousness not entirely eradicated although it does seem somewhat less intense now.
Sherlock's hands have now come to clamp over my own, although he's simply holding me against him. Not doing anything similar to his earlier movements, his spasmodic jerks against me. I can feel his heart vibrate, even against my chest. I can feel the speed of the organ, racing in fear, pounding with it.
''That's correct,'' I state succinctly. ''I do not want my friend to worry about me any longer.''
I hear the crinkling of John's sleeping bag as he turns towards me.
He seems to ignore the question.
He winces then, eyes suddenly downcast. And I feel like a heel. I feel like I've slapped him in a moment or relatively rare vulnerability and trust.
I look at him quickly, trying to gauge what has happened in the last 25 minutes. Or 15 minutes. Or 40.
No matter what other issues Sherlock is dealing with right now he's likely to be feeling sick to his stomach for that reason alone.
Really hurt. Angry-hurt-furious-hurt.
I exhale sharply against my pillow.
I sigh, and scrawl out a quick note for my friend - reminding him to drink at least two glasses of water when he rises - doctor's orders! - before laying it against the coffee table where he is likely to see it upon awakening.
N.B.: The quote at the end of this chapter is taken from the book ''Wintergirls'' by Laurie Halse Anderson.
Sherlock's breath makes a hiss against the receiver.
I take a step back then, feeling cornered. Feeling incredibly vulnerable.
What sort of psychotherapist smiles that much?
I've been rinsing off for a solid 15 minutes now.
I swallow down the last of my tea and don’t mention that he did, in fact, cry. Nor do I mention the fact that it was very likely to his benefit. Neither assertion would go over well.
''Anything else?''
I nod, and indicate to my own skull.
Sherlock clenches his fists, closes his eyes.
''Only that. Only that,'' he repeats - the obvious stress causing him to tremble.
Sherlock lets his hand press in against his stomach again.
And is it so wrong to want the heat of a home? One that is tied to a number on the door, rusted and long-standing?
It's not drugs that heal someone. Medications, at best, are stabilizers.
Perhaps, in the past, I would have thought some of his behaviours were out of place. Now I see them for what they are: brotherly concern, only hidden with an impassive air, a stately way of talking and moving.
I grumble under my breath. That jumper really is my favourite.
“Why do you think that you hate yourself?,” I ask once I can be sure my words will come out in even and measured strength.
"I've considered that as a reason for your behaviour tonight, yes Sherlock."
While behaviours related to self-care can obviously be considered healthy or unhealthy, the word 'bad' is generally tied to something skirting the moral sphere. Bad gets linked to guilt or innocence. It gets linked to the very notion that they, the patient, is somehow inferior in a particular area. Either incompetent, or even unworthy of continued efforts.
Is this how John feels when he talks to me lately?
''You too, Peter,'' I mumble to the passing dust, and then turn to take in the roan brick building. It looks somehow more imposing than it did on the first night I came to visit Sherlock.
I watch him. Sad.
I made this worse.
I nod, give him a fuller smile than before. ''Wasn't that your concern?''
''Why?''
Molly just grins at me, then removes her keys from her oversized duffle. I catch a large cartoon cat keychain. Hello Kitty, I think. Ridiculous keychain for a grown woman to have, in my opinion.
''Why?,'' he says dismally. ''You didn't - wouldn't - eat dinner. But you were up in the middle of the night ransacking the cupboards?''
''You'll feel warmer soon, and isn't that better?,'' I formulate, trying to be reasonable.
I realize, next, that I've pounded the gravel into the soles of my feet, which sting and feel wet.
You don't walk away because you stop loving a person. You walk away from the arguments and the trials and the tantrums and the deception because you do love them. But sometimes you forget that you are not fighting them, you are fighting a disorder.
I stare at the scale and press the ON button; the last weigh in digitally pops up on the display screen.
Sherlock swallows again, his eyes burning around the clasp of my hand on the door frame as if trying to burn away my presence with his line of sight.
''He was so pale, John. Vomiting up a storm and-''
I blink and the image vanishes, and John stares are me more intensely.
I felt anxiety. A sense of dread, almost.
Pascal writes down the date. Can't be much more.
-------------------------------------------------
As the sky turns dark, his heart starts to slow, and when we break apart, he's studying the snow beneath our feet.
I knock again, more insistently this time. The locks have been dismantled – and have been since before Sherlock was released from the clinic – though that doesn't mean I want to barge into his space without his permission or without necessitating medical circumstances.
With great speed, I lower his pajama top against his stomach, fight against the urge to pick him up and hug him.
John looks up at me with hesitation, and I know the reason why: he's afraid to leave me alone.
He sounds upset. Frustrated and upset, but not yet alarmed.
It's vague. It's purposefully vague. I know that.
"What?," he asks petulantly. "Sherlock - I'm trying to make us dinner here. If you don't want to talk about anything else, then I'm not going to force you. But you need to eat. You have lost weight on the Thiesen case, and you can't afford to do that."
''Did you get to see him?,'' I hiss, hot tears flooding my eyes.
At first, I thought that he was injured, before seeing the small body cradled to his chest, the stick-man way Sherlock walked with the dead weight in his arms.
Sherlock stares at me oddly, as if not getting what I'm requesting.
John looked down helplessly at the heaving mass of his belly below him. Quivering and taut and full to bursting beneath Sherlock’s gentle touch as he caressed it lovingly in his hands. John laid his hands slowly on either side of his aching, bloated body, feeling how huge and heavy he’d made himself. Feeling what he’d done to his body.
“Gonna burst –” he groaned again, then the beginnings of a wild whine left his throat, and he tipped his head back, pure bliss on his shadowed face, as the hand between his legs suddenly rubbed once along his erection.
He normally got a bit of a dark thrill at the knowledge people had watched him – more at the mere existence of the comments themselves than what they really said. These ones, though, made him suddenly look over his shoulder. He felt like he’d given a piece of himself away. Like that perfect, full moment looking down at his body while he warmly ached in his groin had now been taken from him, and changed into something that belonged to everyone else. As if the comments saying they wanted to fuck his belly, or stuff him until he burst, or rub his skin, were suddenly about
He looked down between swallows at Sherlock’s hands cupping his belly. They rubbed the sides of his stretching skin, and disappeared underneath John’s gut to hold the heavy weight of it, and dipped into his sensitive navel before tracing up towards the top of his growing bulge. Sherlock’s hands seemed like they were everywhere at once, rubbing and caressing this solid growing mass that felt like it wasn’t even a part of John’s body anymore.
Bingo. Gotcha. Case solved. Go to pause.
He moaned and rubbed fruitlessly back and forth at his skin. “Too big,” he grunted out. “I’m too big. Look at this . . .my belly . . .”
And as his belly swelled, and his skin stretched to cover what he’d done to his body, the man simply held himself with both hands, tipped his head up to the ceiling, and moaned, “Yes . . . fuck . . .
Without stopping to think, John tipped back his head, threw in a mouthful of the mints, and started to chew. When his mouth was still mostly full, he picked up the cola, unscrewed the cap, and immediately started to drink in long, slow gulps. His belly immediately panged as he swallowed, protesting against packing anything more inside. John pressed his palm over his navel, feeling the pressure as he swelled, the tightening of his skin.
John drained the last swallow of the second mug and grimaced as the milk slowly forced its way into his aching belly. Suddenly he remembered the mirror, and he looked up, desperate to see himself. His belly was stretched tightly forward, pushing underneath his skin and more round along the bottom than John had ever seen it before. He felt swollen and ripe, and Sherlock’s hands continued to rub over his pale, exposed skin.
“God, look at it,” he whispered under his breath. “God, yeah . . .”
And John knew, as he held himself, and felt the full curve of his body covered in his own release, that he would be doing the exact same thing three months from now.
And for some reason, more than anything, he thought once more of the strong line of the man’s jaw. The quiet confidence in his spine and hands. The desperate, quiet sounds of his sighs when he first began to drink.
“I need . . . “ he was breathing, almost too softly to hear. “Need more room . . .”
He was just about to either sink to the floor or try to haul himself to the sink, when, instead, a sudden idea made John stop in his tracks.
Sherlock opened his eyes, not realizing he’d closed them. The man was breathing hard and holding his belly with both hands, taking long, deep breaths that expanded his heavy body even more.
This man’s, though, simply said “Username999.”
