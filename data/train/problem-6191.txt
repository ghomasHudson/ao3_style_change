Genius Princess: In addition to the time travel, we are also dealing with an alien invasion by a group called the Confederacy, new Hydra, and finally another possible alien invasion resulting in half the universe being wiped out.
Monkey lover 2: I also wasn’t accosted by a naked Aida which is good because I probably would’ve shot her on-site or thrown up on her.
Red phone: Unfortunately, it took a giant fight at a missile silo in Siberia for you to get around to actually asking me this stuff.
D Fitzsimmons: She didn't even ask me any questions about the other timeline, which seems like a waste. You got more information out of me.
Red phone: Even so, I bet there are still moments when you want to punch me in the teeth, which is fine because I kind of feel the same way about you sometimes.
Red phone: I created the AI as a coping mechanism to deal with a lot of my own problems. And maybe to ensure that a part of my Jarvis lived on. I know you don’t want to hear this, but Jarvis was more of a father to me than Howard ever was.
Blue phone: And I’m sure there are members of Congress that still want to kill you, even if Senator Stern is gone. Half of them still want your tech.
StarkAE: Of course he is reverse engineering my tech, I expect nothing less. So why exactly do you want to kill Happy? It’s never a good sign when Friday wakes me up to take a call or a text message in this case, in the middle of the night.
Me: You think I’m going to kick him out? That I’m just going to abandon him because he’s not a normal 15-year-old anymore? Did [redacted] think that?
May: Dr. Margarita Cruz. She’s the number two of new Shield’s psych department. She’s in charge of the in-house rehab program. Also, she was a protégé of Andrews. I think I can talk her into coming on board. So we are currently on our way to Empire State.
Me: I’m 99% certain of that. And he does feel bad about Siberia. I feel bad about Siberia. We are not going to hit each other again. We promise to use our words.
“I’m Friday.” The teenager standing behind the Princess told the group. Although, she didn’t sound like Friday and Hunter has been talking a lot to the AI in the last few months. “Although, I think I prefer the name Afia in this body. What you think about Afia Anne Stark-Rogers?”
Anthony: I love you, but I'm not having that conversation with her. That's something you're going to have to man up and do.
Dose watching you die make me question if I made the right choice in breaking up with you? I would be stupid to not acknowledge that it did make me reevaluate my choice, but it doesn’t change things in the long run. It just made me realize that we fell apart for 1 million other reasons as well.
Me: Nice to know that you get satellite in whatever country you’re in. I made the suit match your eye color. Your real eye color, not Stefan’s eye color. I really hate the Nano tech contacts.
"No, well, better than I did. Thank Dr. Suarez for that. You were protecting your best friend and I was trying to protect you and we both just assumed that the other person wouldn’t listen to us, so we didn’t bother to explain ourselves well or at all. Sometimes, I wonder if we had started our text message honesty exercise earlier then we could totally be snuggling in our bedroom at the upstate compound right now."
BFF Ned: Was Thor actually here? Did you get to meet him? Are the muscles real or just like an optical illusion?
Tony: And you are back to monosyllables. I can use some of that, but all the Anna stuff will have to be scrubbed. I don’t want people to know what she meant to me. I’m not even sure how much Jarvis stuff I want the public to know.
Image 3: Steve’s nude drawling of Tony lying on the floor of the penthouse with his legs strategically placed.
Steve: Neither can you. We wouldn’t be trying to do what we're doing if we could let go. Simmons was wrong. Neither one of us has moved on.
HSBF: Considering you make jokes about Alien invasions and your PTSD, I believe that you believe nothing is off-limits.
Me: You could at least let me know that you’re not grounded for life because your aunt realizes that you’re a superhero in your spare time. I would like a heads up when she does find out so I can make sure I'm still out of the country or at least suit up because she’s going to try to kill me.
Me: I don’t even know the answer to that. I would like to say since Sokovia, but I would be lying to myself. I think the problems started the moment I decided to actively participate in bringing the band back together post Shield implosion.
"I..." It struck Scott that soon enough his own erratic behavior could get him locked up. Hating himself for taking the out, Scott admitted, "I should probably stay here. If I stick my hand down your pants in front of Coulson, he'll probably put me in a padded room too."
Surprised by the admission and the implication that Logan would have come looking for him if he'd known, Scott watched him warily for a moment before sighing. "No one knew. I'd imagine that the Professor saw something with Cerebro to start them looking. They weren't expecting me back. Still aren't." He laughed bitterly. "Kind of pathetic. The first time I strike off on my own, I get kidnapped. Maybe you weren't too far off about me in the first place." Scott sighed again, too tired to think about it anymore. "Call them. Have somebody bring a car or a helicopter or whatever. If I'm going to get interrogated, I'd just as soon get it over with."
"I kinda do count the zoo," Tony returned. Realizing he was still sitting there buck naked, he pulled a sheet across his lap. It was silly, but it made him feel a hell of a lot better. "And you're skipping the part where you gave Romanov the headache from hell and turned Logan against us. Maybe nobody explained this part to you, but usually when you borrow things, you return them at least as good as you found them. And as far as worlds to command, we've got that here already. Maybe you should ask somewhere else. I hear Mars is nice this time of year."
"Too bad he’s so fucking indestructible," Clint growled. The blow Creed had taken, Clint was sure, would have killed Loki. Considering the mutant's regenerative powers, it was impressive that he was still unconscious.
Tony nodded quietly. He hadn't thought of all that. He still remembered Steve's confession, "This still feels like a loaner some days." He was already turning over in his head all the reading he was going to be doing to bring himself up to speed on what was known about the serum. And how the hell he was going to talk Bruce into helping. "Wish I could help him more," he murmured.
Though she took Clint's point to heart, Natasha still shrugged. "We'll see. I'll behave if they do." Given the small number of people she genuinely liked and respected in the world, if someone tried to say anything about Steve or his altered state, she knew that they'd end up regretting it one way or another. "I promise I'll make sure they aren't able to file a report if it comes down to it," she assured as they headed down into the cafeteria.
Clint propped his elbows on his knees and loosely hooked his fingers together in front of himself, watching Darien for a few moments before finally pushing himself up and crawling closer. He grabbed Darien by the chin and hissed in the other man's ear, "Only because I want to hear you moan for me like a little bitch." Darien had pretty well had the archer at his mercy a few moments ago, and Clint wasn't going to just let something like that slide. He shoved Darien's hands away and wrapped his own fingers around the other man's shaft, pumping slowly and watching his partner with wicked blue eyes.
In the harsh light of a new day, Steve felt his stomach knot with fear all over again. It felt like the other shoe had to drop at some point. He found it hard to imagine losing everything the serum had given him and not losing Tony too. Instead of lying prone with the mask on his face, the bed's incline had been brought up so that he could sit. He'd spent a lot of the morning sketching, too tense to focus on reading anything and too nervous to put up with the stupidity that made up most morning television. Steve tried not to freak out at the sound of the door. Another asthma attack wasn't how he wanted to start the day. "Hi," he called out, smile wan but still there.
Tony smiled, affecting that casual show of charming arrogance he was well known for. "But of course," he said. "You're sharing a meal with amazing company." Stabbing his fork into the steaming plate of food before him, Tony took a bite and marveled at the taste. "This is delicious," he enthused. "Aren't you just full of surprises? Hell of a fighter, easy on the eyes, and you can cook. You're just about perfect."
Though Steve lingered, it wasn't out of any sense of defiance. He knew he could take a hit from Bruce better than most, and he wasn't about to leave the room until it was cleared as best he could make it. "Keep Loki down," he shouted to Hulk. Steve was never sure exactly how much filtered through, but at least some shred of Bruce always seemed to remain - enough that only Thor had thus far been on the man's bad side in his alternate form. Carefully he put himself between Hulk, Loki and Hank and Phil. "Gentlemen, now's the time."
Logan's jaw tightened as he looked away from Clint. The two might have showered like hell, but his senses still told him enough. It made him want to kill someone right then and there. Loki was stooping to all new kinds of low this time around.
Though he hadn't yet decided whether it was real or his own imagination, Steve felt like breathing was easier, at least on a physical level. He was fairly certain his face looked more fleshed out, his pants were a bit more snug. Then again, he still looked like a zombie, too pale and with deep circles under his eyes, but he doubted the serum could help one way or another with that. He sat ramrod straight in his own seat and kept his gaze on the table. Just being there was enough to make him feel panicked because Tony wasn't. Jarvis had asked him to come down to the lab after the briefing. Not the main lab, not the lab that SHIELD shared. Tony's lab. He swallowed hard and tried not to think about it. Jarvis wouldn't ask if there wasn't something big, but he still didn't want to go.
Coulson took a slow breath. "I carry it. And when we get there, you make sure I put it down." He gave May a quick nod of confirmation that it was alright for her to go, and she slipped away without a word. As much as he didn't want to touch it, he wanted Clint to touch it even less. Carefully Coulson wrapped his hand around the handle and was surprised that it lifted easily. "That's not at all ominous," he murmured, heartbeat already picking up as he tried not to think of the million ways it could go wrong. "Let's walk fast, okay?"
Tony felt goosebumps rise on his skin, and he gripped Steve's hips as if trying to steady himself. It was amazing, having that level of power over the other man, being able to put that look of pleasure on his face. The billionaire would have smiled hearing Steve's head thump quietly against the wall if his mouth hadn't been otherwise occupied. He slowly began to bob his head, one hand gently cupping and stroking his partner's balls as he started to hum.
"That would be an affirmative," Clint replied, gazing over the rim of his mug as he took a sip. "We figured it might be a good idea to keep an eye on him. He's been through hell, and you never know if he'll suit up and look for a little payback." Tossing Coulson a reassuring wink, Clint added, "No worries. Stark seems to be doing better. At least that's what Nat says, and I trust her opinion." Indeed, from all of her reports it seemed Cap had turned out to be a good influence on the billionaire. Clint hoped that Tony's recovery meant one less thing to worry about.
Victor offered the god an almost coy smirk as he stepped back, keeping eye contact as he unbuttoned his jeans and slowly slid them down. Stepping out of them, he stalked closer to Loki with no lack of confidence in his stride whatsoever. Hooking a claw in the loop of Loki's drawstring, he slowly tugged it loose. "C'mon.... I showed you mine..."
Clint's forehead creased. "You're handling it really well. I think I'd be in a corner crying like a bitch," he admitted with a smirk. He glanced at Coulson. "And where do you get off saying you *might* save me from her scary mind powers? I'm not sure I deserve that." Shifting his focus back to Nat, he grinned faintly. "You'll be pleased to know, though, that in spite of all the drama, I did manage to give Loki a solid thump in the ribs with the hammer. Pissed him off, too. He threw one hell of a temper tantrum about it." His voice hitched a little at the end of his sentence as he remembered the counter attack but quickly snapped himself back to the moment. Nat was there, Phil was there. He had his friends, and all things considered, they were doing pretty well.
Tony settled at the bar and gestured to the bartender, who was cowering behind it still. "Hey, uh... it's okay. Just fill'er up," he said, leaning over and trying to hand his glass to the man. He looked at Logan. "Care for another? Next round's on me."
Watching Natasha cut through men like they were tissue never stopped being unsettling. What really rattled Steve was the fact that there were so few guards. They were obviously supposed to find the place. The whole thing smelled like a set-up, and that idea worried him more than anything. What else could be happening? A scream echoed down the hall and Steve felt his heart skip a beat.
"That would be nice if you don't mind," Steve answered before he could think better of it. Being close could be awkward. Then again, why move into the man's house if they weren't going to spend time together? Steve took a sip of his coffee and considered the strange shift as he started in on one of the other croissants. "I'll go get my stuff when we're done eating. There's not much." He hadn't had any real desire to acquire much despite Fury giving him a charge card and explaining carefully how to use it. He'd purchased clothes and gotten a few other essentials, but Steve was used to not having a lot, and he hadn't felt the need to change that. "Then maybe you could help me out with the computer? Director Fury got me a laptop and... it's... different." He frankly had no idea what to do with the thing despite everyone insisting he could do everything from play solitaire to read up on the news with it.
"Don't worry, Jolly Green. I'll make sure you don't break Manhattan," Tony assured. "Everyone get in the jets."
Scott nodded and let himself breathe through it. He knew Logan was right and let him set the pace. He sat motionless and let his hands soften against Logan's skin. He could feel the strong pulse of the man's heart. His eyes closed, head tipped forward so that his hair fell into his eyes. "You feel so good," he finally managed. Scott knew he was finally ready to move, could feel the relaxation. Slowly smiling, he raised his eyebrows at Logan. "You mind if I stop just sitting here now? I'm good. Honest. We'll go slow."
Logan pulled Scott close, stroking a hand through the man's hair and sighing quietly. "Alright," he said resolutely, drawing back. "Then I guess I go tell the suit and his pet leather boy that they better lock me up," he said, shaking his head when Scott looked ready to protest. "If Loki's gotten hold o' me enough that I'm willin' to hurt you, I don't wanna be able to. You got a better chance against me than most o' the folks floatin' around here, but... until they straighten me out, I ain't takin' that risk."
"That's what missions are for. Put the LZ in my HUD and we'll put a pin in your idea of what I need to test," he told the AI, though he had to admit that he hadn't been entirely sure that nano-based thrusters would work. Tony did a few fancy moves before he leveled off and started angling toward the landing zone.
Steve rolled his eyes, but he appreciated the sentiment just the same. He'd gone out with the man to enjoy his company, not to create a media stir. The fewer cell phone pictures were snapped the better. "It's been quiet, but we both know it won't stay that way." The glare of celebrity was one thing, the glare of celebrity when combined with trying to make a shaky relationship work was terrifying. Steve reached out for Tony's free hand as the waiter set their drinks down. He tried to tune out the man's mute judgment and focus on Tony instead once they’d given their orders. "And the only way we're fooling around in the bathroom is if there's a really, really good lock on the door."
Clint had to shake himself. He was still remembering the outline he'd caught glimpses of when he'd met Phil in his PJs. Knowing he hadn't imagined things put a whole new spin on the knowledge. A distracting spin. Clearing his throat to make sure he didn't give that away - he was not going to date his handler - he nodded. "That actually sounds like a good idea. Maybe we could get some drinks tonight? Just to keep from going stir crazy?"
The cold was what woke Clint up. He sat up, careful to avoid waking Phil, hoping they hadn't lost too much darkness. He gently nudged Coulson, smiling faintly. "Hey, wakey wakey. Time to start hiking," he said gently. He was eager to get on the road and knew Phil was, too.
"I'll take care of the paperwork," Coulson said with a wave of his hand to dismiss the silent concern. "Cap, can you report to Fury? Barton, make sure Summers is okay."
"No, he... Bucky would have liked you..." Steve knew that Tony was trying hard to bring the mood up and tried to let go of some of his worries, but it didn't work. It was too hard. "Tony, if they found... if someone found Bucky's body... could they have... have done something to him?" The man he knew would never have tried to hurt Tony or any of the Avengers. He would have been proud, or at least Steve liked to think so. He knew it was unfair even to ask such a thing when Tony was exhausted and hurt and probably wanted nothing more than to sleep, but as horrible as the idea of someone using Bucky's body to do evil things was, it was better than the thought of Bucky doing those things himself.
"Logan! Wait!" Clint felt his heart sink as the man charged forward. He was struck with fear and indecision: chase Logan and make sure the man wasn't alone, or risk the possibility it was a ploy to separate them from one another?
Coulson chuckled. "There's plenty of ulcers to go around. You're in good company... and while I certainly don't want to speak for Captain Rogers, I'm sure we'd all love to make use of your skills when you're up to it."
Coulson took a seat next to Clint. Though neither of them spoke, it felt better being close to the man. It felt protected in some intrinsic way he didn't fully understand. They understood, and neither one of them would hold back if it came down to another fight. That knowledge was enough.
"A friend - just not your friend." May brought her heel down toward Mystique's face, but the woman twisted her body and pulled Hank half off of the floor. She managed to take May off her feet at the same time, though the woman recovered well.
The young woman blushed more furiously at that than she had at the compliment to her looks earlier in the evening. The truth was that what was under the surface had always been far more interesting to her. "I was recruited, contacted by an agent and, after a great many interviews... well, it was Fitz and I together, really. We're the youngest people to graduate the SHIELD Science Academy, which, as it turns out, is prestigious and rather time consuming. What about you? What convinced you to sign on?"
Logan sighed, leaning into Scott wordlessly and burying his face in the man's neck, his hand sliding up to cradle the back of Scott's head. He felt jittery from the memories he'd awakened, and for a few minutes, he hadn't felt like himself. "Let's... yeah, let's go back to bed," he said. Scott was a soothing balm for him, an anchor. He straightened a little, pressing a slow, sensual kiss to his lover's mouth as if to make it clear they weren't going back to sleep. Sleep brought ugly dreams and uglier memories, and that was the last thing Logan wanted to do right then.
Tony sobered, seeing a shadow covering Steve's eyes. "You miss those days, don't you?" he asked softly. Steve had lost so much that it amazed Tony the other man was as well adjusted as he appeared to be. Tony could not even begin to imagine himself in Steve's shoes, waking up to find the world that he'd known no longer existed. It made him admire Steve all the more, while it also made him feel ashamed over locking himself away instead of facing what had happened.
"We think you can live. That's more than some people can manage," Coulson answered with a hint of a smile. "We think you can take a beating. Tony can do it as Iron Man, Cap can handle it to a point, Thor can stand toe to toe, there's even Hulk, but that's... unpredictable. You can think and fight and probably come through the other side. What else do you think we might need, Logan?"
"No, not exactly," Tony answered, eyeballing the glass he was handed and then sniffing the contents. "Well, one thing I can say... it contains alcohol." He dragged one of the Cubans out of his pocket and offered it to Logan. "Care to trade in that dollar turdstick you're chewing on?" When the offer was met with a silent glower, Tony lit the cigar for himself and continued. "Anyway, we sort of-loosely-represent SHIELD, and-"
Phil half-smiled and kissed Clint's tousled hair again. "Good, because I don't promise to stop entirely." He needed the closeness. Clint needed it. Absently he started stroking the hair at the back of Clint's neck, an idle touch to maintain additional contact between them. "Actually, I don't promise to stop at all. I'll behave myself in public, but not in the suite." It was odd, but he couldn't quite think of it as just his anymore when he was already growing so used to Clint's warm presence in it.
As Simmons finally got a chance to look Steve over, Phil and Clint walked in, and Clint balked a moment at the mass gathering, looking at everyone suspiciously. "Alright, what's going on?" he wanted to know, his hand moving to the hammer.
Fury waited until he got a nod of agreement from Coulson, then leaned back. "I'll have Jarvis schedule your assessments and let you know. For now, take some time to yourselves."
Bruce made a point to stand aside, trying to edge toward Frigga. Logan might be right, but he preferred to at least try the easy way first. “Think you can help us out here, Your Highness?”
Not entirely convinced of the plan considering the fact that Bruce had obviously given recent and very intense thought to killing Tony, Natasha frowned. Looking especially at Bruce, she asked, "You sure you boys can play nicely without supervision?"
Clint's reverie was broken, when he heard the door two suites down open. He backed down the hallway as stealthily as possible and dropped his voice to the lowest whisper he could and still expect to be heard. "Coulson, I think you're about to have company," he hissed into his earpiece, watching nervously as Logan slowly stepped out of his suite.
It didn't take Clint long to clean himself up and head down the hall to get dressed. He pulled on a pair of neatly creased black cargo pants, boots, a button-down shirt and a leather jacket, then headed back down to check on Darien’s progress. "There're some extra clothes in the closet if you need anything. SHIELD got some stuff in your size."
Scott snorted at the mental image. He was pretty sure Logan was right. It was New York. You didn't have to go far too find that. "Or a park bench to make out on."
Clint had flinched a little at the touch before remembering it was Phil. He edged away from the puddle of what was mostly bile and took the rag, wiping his face down before taking the other rags from Phil's hand and moving out of his line of sight to clean himself up. He tugged his pants back on and slowly sank to the floor next to his handler. He opened his mouth to say something, then gave up, whimpering as he pressed his face to Phil's chest, his arms winding tightly around the man's waist. He'd barely thought of the way Loki had used him when he'd been abducted, had almost managed to forget, but Creed had torn that wound open and added fresh ones to go with it. "Phil... I can't," he rasped as tears rolled down his cheeks. "I can't do this. I can't do this again." With Loki, he'd submitted, offered himself up, even begged. He'd always assumed that it had all been the influence of the tesseract, but the way Creed had... "We have to get out of here."
Visibly surprised at being dubbed the more fashion-forward of them, Steve looked the shirts over and nodded his approval. They looked comfortable, functional, and obviously plaid and wife beaters were Logan's standard uniform. "I think they'll do just fine."
It was very, very true. It was also half the reason the closet scenario had been so difficult. Not only had Clint been pressed up against him, but the fabric did absolutely nothing to hide the hard lines of his body. "You have a point there. Maybe the spandex isn't necessary. I think maybe as a next step just seeing you naked would be better. Even after last night, we've both only really gotten a preview." That was almost good. They knew they could get each other off, which relieved some potential sexual pressure, but there was still something left to look forward to. They hadn't blown every last detail on one drunken hookup. The first time they were really together would still be new. "Luckily I'm pretty sure you're well worth waiting for."
Having enjoyed an extra long shower, Tony shut off the water and dried himself off with a fluffy towel. He wrapped it around his waist as he heard Steve calling his name. //Excellent timing,// he thought, smiling to himself. "That was quick," Tony said, nonchalantly strolling into the room. "Did you get everything?"
The treatment was having its intended effect, and Scott could barely get himself together enough to demand what he wanted. It was surprisingly overwhelming to see Natasha lying next to them fucking herself with her fingers while Logan growled into his ear. "Harder... Logan, please... fuck me harder," he finally panted, driving himself back against his lover's hips in a desperate bid for more.
A pleasantly surprised grunt escaped Clint's lips at the aggressive move, and he braced his hand against the wall behind Darien. "Fuck..." he managed. "Damn nice mouth on you." Impatient, he thrust forward again. "You look good down there. Like the perfect little bitch." He took a few moments to use Darien's mouth before shoving the man away. "Take your clothes off."
"It would be good to be there. It's good having something to do." He caught the odd expression on Logan's face and made note to talk to him later. He met Clint's gaze and gave a hint of a smile, though it was far sadder than the one he'd offered earlier. "Funny how strange it is being around people. I guess I kind of went off on my own there for a bit."
The extra heat and the moisture let Steve stroke just a bit faster, and he came seconds later. The water washed away the evidence quickly enough. Shaking and boneless, Steve sagged against Tony. Instead of mauling his lover's neck, he began kissing the same spots, gentle and soothing as his breathing slowed to a normal pace. "Promise I'll do a better job of that later. After we both sleep." Still shaky, Steve drew away and grabbed a loofah and some soap to get them both decent. The last thing he wanted was to let Tony go, but it would be worth it to stop smelling like gym socks. The idea of curling up in bed with a damp, clean Tony at his side was more than enough. "I slept here, y'know. Pepper stayed with me the first night."
Clint squatted as the ducks waddled up the shore, laughing softly as the birds shook water from their tail feathers and quacked demands for the food he was holding. He tossed a few pieces at a time, urging them to share. Glancing back over his shoulder at Coulson, he shrugged, looking faintly insecure. "Sometimes I meditate," he admitted, almost sheepishly. One of the ducks tugged at his pant leg, and he turned his attention back to the birds, tossing more food their way.
"Now that's not true. I'm not saying that all of SHIELD is on your buddy list, but the team, the Avengers? They're your friends." He tilted his head and regarded Clint quietly as they both sipped their coffee. "If you'd showed up at Steve's door - if he was there and not in Tony's room, of course - he would have let you in too. Same for Bruce or even Tony." Their team was odd, but it worked. They worked together beautifully in a strange, synchronous way that even Fury probably hadn't predicted. "That said, I'm honored to be your friend." Sappy as the words were, they were spoken with Coulson's trademark earnesty. He meant every syllable. "We aren't always going to agree or get along, but I'm always on your side."
"Hey," Tony said, reaching for the mask as if to put it back in place. He hesitated, though. "Look, don't..." He took a deep breath. He wanted to yell at Steve for being so brash, but, "You did what you needed to. What the team needed you to. I can't... I'm mad that you did it, but that's because I'm being selfish. You did the right thing." He leaned in and pressed his lips to Steve's, lingering only a moment out of fear of interfering with the man's breathing again. That much still felt like his lover, still felt normal and familiar. "We'll get through this, however we have to." He grabbed a cup with a straw from the tray and held it up for Steve to take a sip.
Curious at the question, Loki tilted his head and studied the man intently. "Nothing. This time, Mr. Stark, I believe that you kissed me." He was beginning to see that it had been more an issue of testing the waters than desire, but it didn't change the fact that Tony looked more conflicted than he should have if that were the only thing happening. Despite himself, it seemed that Tony was intrigued at the very least. "Your mind is your own. I suppose there's no reason for you to take my word for it, but it's true." Loki leaned in again but stopped shy of kissing the man at first. "It isn't so bad, is it?" he murmured before closing the gap again. Stark tasted of the sweet apple he'd been eating, the juice clinging to his lips. Loki wasted no time in licking it off.
"Sure." It was strange to think that he could actually get a buzz from the stuff, and the idea of a long, luxurious night softened by the alcohol sounded nice. Steve grabbed the glasses while Tony selected the vintage. Given that even when he did have a reason to drink he'd mostly stuck to cheap beer, Steve was happy to let his lover choose. He couldn't help but fixate on Tony's hands as he went through the ritual of opening the bottle. For a moment he considered opening his sketchbook, but Steve wanted the time with Tony more than a sketch, and he took his glass with a smile. "I think a toast is in order. To us."
"Definitely," Clint agreed, squirming a little until he was laying on his injuries in the least painful way possible. He pressed himself against Phil and pulled Nat close to him, sighing happily. He'd barely gotten his face pressed comfortably into the crook of Phil's neck before he was out like a light.
Logan knew better. He knew he didn't want to turn around, but instincts wouldn't let him ignore what he intellectually knew had to be going on on the dancefloor, and he turned to steal a glance back at his two new comrades just as their lips met. Logan's jaw clenched, and he had to resist the urge to bound across the way and pull the two apart. //And what business o' yours is it, anyway?// Still, he knew jealousy when he felt it. It was just the same as when he'd found out Scott and Jean were together. //Gettin' to be a pattern. Show up somewhere and start wantin' what ain't mine.//
Tony reached for another pastry, finding himself more hungry than usual. "We'll get you settled in and you'll be feeling at home in no time." He indicated one of the arches leading off to a hall with his coffee cup. "There's four guest bedrooms on this floor. Or, if you want to be closer to me, there's a couple upstairs."
The feeling of settling onto Logan's cock was delicious. The position forced the length even deeper into his body. It hurt like hell at first, but Scott adjusted quickly. He responded happily to every kiss and clung tightly to Logan's shoulders. Frankly he didn't care if it hurt as long as Logan didn't stop fucking him.
Heimdall inclined his head. "You are most welcome, Fair Widow. Our prince has spoken highly of your skill. Now it is your hands to save him."
“I think I can handle that. With my metabolism… well, let’s just say I’m not a dainty eater. Pretty sure being in the army didn’t help that any.” Steve was surprised to find that he felt relaxed, not tense in the face of what they were doing. It was a date. A real one. And that was shockingly, inexplicably fine. Steve couldn’t help casting shy glances up at Tony every chance he got. Even tired and raw and a little rough around the edges, Tony still looked fantastic. “Speaking of drinking, uh, I don’t. It doesn’t do anything for me, and I didn’t think about wine or anything. Hope you’re okay with something a little less festive for the night?”
Clint scowled, then nearly jumped through himself when another plane seemed to materialize out of nowhere a few hundred feet away and came to a landing nearby. He already had bow and arrow in hand when Bruce's hand landed on his shoulder.
Tony obviously had no need for a slow pace and no desire to have any sort of control. That was both good and bad. It had been awhile, and being with Tony was good on so many levels that Steve found himself at a loss to take a breather when he needed to. "You feel perfect," he moaned, finally starting to move in earnest: slow, deep strokes that left him aching for more.
Clint was hard-headed, fiery, and not just a little ready to go out and kill Loki. He was also good at figuring out when an order really was an order and he no longer had a vote. Grabbing his fork, he muttered, "Got it," before digging into his food. He froze a moment later though when he heard Coulson's objection. The oddly soft note in the man's tone made Clint look over before he could help himself. "I didn't... mean it that way." It was unsettling, the amount of care he'd heard in his handler's voice. The man seemed to be strangely overprotective lately. Clint was struggling to figure out why.
"Or being remotely civilized. Next time you get in a plane with me, you are *not* eating a half dozen eggs beforehand," Tony groused as he got out of the plane, yet again leaving Steve to take care of his baggage. It wasn't personal as much as Tony was just accustomed to someone taking care of it. Usually Pepper.
Jemma's hand closed tightly over Bruce's, and she gave a decisive shake of her head. "No, you're grieving for your friend. You two were obviously close. I'd be a bit worried if you weren't thinking about it." She smiled slightly and squeezed his hand again. "I'm here because I'd like to get to know you. Knowing who you care about is definitely part of that."
Loki opened his mouth to reply and then closed it, nodding curtly instead as he started down the hall. Sweat trickled down his back, and it frankly made him sick to have them all behind him. Every instinct screamed not to allow it, but it was the only way. He needed to get them to Stark, and he needed to do it sooner rather than later. Eventually even the Avengers might not be able to reign Barton in. When they reached his room, he knocked sharply and prayed that Stark would answer. "We have guests." It was the moment of truth, and he still half expected Stark to tell them to smash him into paste as soon as they had what they wanted. //I couldn't exactly blame him if he did.//
Loki flinched not at the admonition but at the implication that he somehow belonged to Thor. It was an old wound and one that he didn't particularly enjoy prodding. Still he managed to say nothing and was proud of that show of self control. "Captain? I don't expect you to trust me." He inclined his head and said, "Actually, I would worry for your integrity and common sense if you trusted me, but I can help. You know that because you are not a stupid man. I ask only for a chance, and as I would have a baby-sitter, there would be little risk to your team."
"I think that might make the toast soggy," Steve protested, "but I'll see what I can do." He had no intention of giving Tony alcohol given the pain meds he was on and they both knew it, but he was willing to play along. Steve kissed Tony on the cheek before he got up, brushed his teeth and pulled on some clothing. He went to Tony's favorite coffee shop on the corner and was back a half hour later with two coffees and a bag containing a variety of pastries. "Food," he beckoned, crinkling the bag as he sat down on the bed next to Tony and kicked his shoes off again. "I'm willing to bribe you into consciousness."
Logan quirked a faint grin, glad for the distraction of company. It was hard not to wallow in the past couple decades of his life when it was all he could remember. Hell, it'd been a couple of months after he'd come to on Three Mile before he'd rediscovered his claws. Figuring other things out was even more of a chore and had a tendency to occupy his thoughts on a good day or become an unhealthy brood-and-booze session at worst. "Alright. A bar it is. Know any good-?" Logan was interrupted by the ring of Steve's cellphone, and Logan cringed when Steve got the thing out and it was flashing Stark's name and face. The feral mutant had to bite back a groan as his ears picked up Tony's end of the line.
Bucky frowned, then stared over Steve's shoulder with a faraway expression. Something at the back of his mind clicked and, in a flash, he saw Tony Stark writhing beneath him, begging to be fucked with a raw need that was almost frightening. He blinked and gasped, trembling slightly as he shook his head as if to dislodge the vision. "Yeah," Bucky agreed shakily. "I don't think I'll ever be ready." It was probably for the best if he and Tony never met face to face. Things were difficult enough. "If you're gonna be busy tonight, does that mean I'll have stay here?"
Since subtle hadn't worked at all, Steve took another step back, his hands on Logan's shoulders, and created pointed distance between them. "Look, I had a lot of fun the other night, but I'm not looking for a repeat performance. I'm with Tony. Period." Having some fun together was one thing, but when it came to something deeper, Steve wasn't interested in sharing his affections. "I'm sorry if I wasn't clear about that. We should have all sat down and talked about it, and I apologize if there was confusion. I... I need to go get some dinner. Anything I can pick up for you and Scott?" he asked, carefully including the other man's name in the hope of jogging Logan's memory as to who he should really be worried about. The gravity of the man's actions struck him a moment later. Logan doesn't have blue eyes. He'd been avoiding holding eye contact for too long, but Steve suddenly tensed. "Maybe you could use a little rest. I could walk you back to your room. Where were you headed?"
Simmons added, "It's honestly quite a thrill to be able to work so closely with the original blueprints. The ones we worked with before... well, of course, they weren't official. This is far more detailed." There was no sense of bravado in the words, as if it never occurred to either of them that someone might not be able to put together the puzzle of the arc reactor. She pulled the schematic up on the holographic board and gazed at it lovingly. "Beautiful."
Scott knew he should hold back and take more time, but it didn't feel like they had any. Instead he began lowering himself onto Logan's cock as slowly as he could convince himself to move. The burning stretch stole his breath, and Scott's lungs burned when he finally managed a shaky inhale and his body relaxed. At last his hips were flush against Logan's, his fingers clenched against the man's chest.
While Clint looked shell-shocked, Natasha looked damn near turned on. She hit the button to bring the targets forward and whistled low at the sight of it. "I like your style, Summers," was all she said, but her smile spoke of plans already being made somewhere in the back of her head.
"Shhh... someone's petting me, and you're killing the magic," Tony murmured, dark eyes almost completely closed as he enjoyed the touch. He loved having his hair played with in ways that he was hard-put to articulate, and he would have been pretty damn happy to stay there until Steve got tired of it. After a moment, Tony relented with a sigh, opening his eyes and leaning in for a quick kiss. "And, yeah... gotta get back to work. He kissed Steve one more time before he slid out of the bed reluctantly. He went through his morning routine - throwing in a shower for good measure - then slouched back into the bedroom in a t-shirt, sneakers, and jeans. He held out a hand and gave Steve a smile. "Kiss goodbye?"
Clint pressed a tentative kiss to Phil's lips, then grabbed him and pulled him into one that was far more passionate, more desperate. He realized a moment later that it might be too rough and softened the contact a little before he pulled away, running his hand through Phil's ruffled hair. "I know it will be. I know you'll be there, whatever happens. That's all I need." He leaned in for another kiss, then pressed his forehead to Phil's and groaned when he heard the alarm chime softly.
Red phone: Great, I think I just accidentally quoted Maroon 5. Friday’s breakup mix is really starting to get to me.
Melinda: Yes, because Director Mace wanted a return to the S.H.I.E.L.D brand even though Agent Burroughs argued against it. Mace thought Shield’s image could be rehabilitated. Burroughs was right.
Purple Princess 2018: Steve really married May there? That's one hell of a reaction to Agent Agent dying.
"Despite all our failings, I do know that you’re pretty loyal to those that you care about. And since there’s no one else around that tops me now. I think we’re good." He frowned at Tony’s flippant response.
Director Snookums: Still more likely a few more months, then a few weeks. Some aspects of the Accords actually need to be re-negotiated which means State Department involvement and congressional ratification which will be time consuming.
Anthony: And I want you here. I definitely don’t want to go nearly a week without talking to you again outside of an emergency.
Please note that I’m using the Ultimate comic book version of Jefferson Morales nee Davis as my template for my version of the character. He comes out a lot nicer in the movie, 616, and the videogame. However, I felt like the asshole tendencies would work better for this story. As well as the fact that most MCU characters are based more on their ultimate incarnation than 616. I also started this story long before the movie and videogame were out. But don’t be too worried. Not everything is what it seems.
HSBF: I would ask you how the taping of Jimmy Kimmel went, but I really want to know what you’re planning to do at the dinner tomorrow. I can always watch the interview in the morning, my time. Friday sends me everything.
In addition, some of the events from this chapter come from episode 4.2 of Agents of Shield. Of course, modified for the new timeline.
"I no longer have a desire to kill you. So, I will avoid those things." Sam said as he perused the menu or at least acted like he was.
“I don’t know if you’re actually going to be able to find the six stones throughout time. Although maybe Robin made us not destroy the reality stone for a reason once we removed it from Vision last year.” Steve stared at her for a moment. “But at a minimum, I can go back to prevent Thanos from winning. However, to do that, I need you to swallow your pride or maybe your fear and call, text, or send a carrier pigeon to Tony and get him to come to help us. I need to save my children.” She was practically yelling at him at this point. Because even if Tony texted her back, he knew Steve would have to be the one to ask. Tony would do a lot of things for Steve.
“Yes. Although if it’s necessary for you to do damage control, why are you waiting a couple of days?”
Spoiler alert: This A/N contains spoilers for AOS season 7, especially episode 7.4. Basically, this is an update on how the timeline will work in the story. It turns out we are a bit more of a branch timeline than I initially thought.
Me: The Shield Spouses one.  I’m so glad they finally got it together. I have pictures of them being adorable. Ana will send them to you.
StarkAE: Which is kind of a downside when I‘m trying to leave a hickey on Sugarplum. But in this case it will probably keep Aunt Mama Bear from eviscerating us all.
Football Hunter: They’re already on separate floors. We’re just waiting for our ride to get here. Separate rides because apparently the rocks that eat people should not be transported together.
Me: Also, I sent Sharon a shoe basket because I’m not that petty and she did help with Laura. Also, I don’t need more people who want to shoot me in the world.
“Sorry, I just realize we’re going to need your new boyfriend,” The Princess said with fake innocence.
D Fitzsimmons: I think I'll go hang out with Stark's kid and her friends. Anything is better than spending more time with the grandparents of this timeline. Happy, well-adjusted Nana scares me.
Me: Wow, they're actually reporting the real news instead of focusing on celebrity break ups. I'm impressed.
Just as she read the message what she assumed was Peter cell phone started playing Dear Lie by TLC. Which was odd because that was her favorite group, but not something Peter would listen to. However, the cell phone kept playing. She finally went into her nephew’s room to retrieve the stupid thing. When she touched it, the screen unlocked and she saw the message from the mechanic.
Me: He said that he was undercover but Spidey Junior’s mom does not believe him, not entirely. And honestly, I’m not sure if I do, either. Maybe he was undercover but I feel like he shares too many of their beliefs.
Me: Because people always fear what’s different. You can’t change that. You can only learn to cope with it.
Red phone: Mom did and after she died, I threw myself into it as a way to deal with everything.  I ended up getting another degree out of it because it turns out music theory is fun. I don't put that on my CV. That's something just for me.
“Tony calls her Ms. Marvel. Quake saved her family from the Watchdogs  and then they had to be relocated.” Steve tells him.
Cuddle Bunny: Captain America doesn’t have an orientation, but Steve Rogers is not heterosexual. I think Ross is only more inclined to see me as Hydra because he wants a reason to lock me up and homosexuality is not illegal anymore.
Agent L. Barton: You’re always the best Friday. As for the Simmons here, I talked to Tony, and he’ll be her AA sponsor if she’s willing to have him. She is also allowed at the cabin for sleepovers.
Love: Because their biological uncle is a bastard and their godfather faked his death and didn’t bother to tell them.
Tony: And now we know that we’ll just tell the reporter that we’re most thankful for each other and that we have yet to screw up our relationship totally.
Anthony love: This is what you expect from a group referred to as the Confederacy. Jokes on them since we know Thanos is planning to kill half of everybody, including them. He just needs the stones on our planet to do so.
“Yeah, that's not going to happen. I'll sleep on the plane. Although I could really use some espresso or six.”
Kitty brother: That is not a break. At least take a nap. You don’t have to do this alone. Let Chief Monkey Lover take over whatever you’re working on until you rest.
HSBF:  You also need everyone to see that you really do good things to help deflect the scandal at the foundation.
Blue phone: You said you were 25 when he died, so I did the math. I'm actually pretty good with numbers. Not as good as you, but I do OK.
Anthony: I’m not sure. I was working on a toaster for the first few sessions. I’m really open when I’m in the zone.
Cuddle Bunny: So I heard congratulations are in order and Colonel Rhodes is the new Director of Shield.
I miss that Bucky. It was us against the world, when we were growing up. I feel like I want to talk to him about what’s going on in my life but I can’t because of what Hydra did to him. That smart woman I mentioned earlier, she’s taking care of him. I hope she has a breakthrough soon and maybe James will wake up. Maybe he already has because it’s not like it’s safe for me to get updates from her.
Of course, Tony wasn’t expecting to find a six-year-old sitting at one of the worktable drawling with magic markers. Especially a six-year-old who did not look like a local. Only one of the royal bodyguards was standing off to the side watching her, which made Tony realize she was supposed to be there.
Tony Potts: That is such a better costume. Friday, sweetheart, do you think you can do something with that image?
I have a boyfriend now. We’ve been together for a few months. Although, I’m not entirely sure how many. I’m going to ask him what day we are counting as our actual anniversary. It started as a long-distance relationship. It still is for the moment. But we knew each other before I had to adapt to a more nomadic lifestyle. I’m hoping that will change soon. My boyfriend is working on it, and he usually gets what he wants.
Me: Tony stepped up. He took care of the children while I was gone. He kept them entertained with movies and pizza while screaming at his legal team in any language that the kids did not know. He put aside his Carter issues to get me back once he realized that legal niceties were not going to work this time.
"I usually don’t tell people where I work. If you ask most federal employees in DC, that’s a normal thing. Also my mother was ex-CIA. I learned early on not to give out too many personal details. You got more than most." Melinda explains.
Tony: We wanted Morgan to have the same last name as us. It's more important that we’re committed to Morgan then if we have paperwork filed with the state. Besides, I don't think Pepper wants to have a big wedding without her mom, and Happy would hate to miss it. He's like our biggest shipper. Although now I'm starting to wonder why he shipped us so much.
Anthony: BTW Senator Ward’s brother was Hydra and he was the one who actually killed his parents and his brother so he could become one of the heads of the organization.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all absolutely lovely. The title to this chapter probably won’t make sense until later on.
Counselor Laura: It feels that way. Look, we need you at the meeting this time. We know that you were with Simmons while she was working on her plan. You can tell us what she was working on.
Me: And it would be worse if the world knew that the satellite explosion that took out dozens of satellites was actually a warhead being safely detonated because it contained a gas that would’ve turned most of Europe into primitive superpowered zombies or something similar. I was a little too stunned to completely pay attention to everything going on in the briefing.
D: Take a nap. Also, I didn’t want to know about your sex life when we shared an apartment at MIT. I don’t want to know now.
Anthony: You can’t even tell me if you did something as ordinary as run in the rain because that may help someone figure out where you are.
Rogers: But I’m still concerned. I keep seeing things in the news about the watchdogs or senator that keep saying nasty things about her own constituents just because they’re different. I can’t remember her name, but she is just filled with hate.
DILF: Morgan wasn't the only child born in the last five years. We would be wiping all of those people out. We would be no better than Thanos if we did that. We just want to bring everybody back. Don't you want Peter back?
The Big Boss: Well, that’s one of your favorite strategies. I will talk to him once I’m done talking to you. However, we have a more immediate problem, he knows who Stefan really is.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the prologue. Also, thank you to everybody who left kudos or added the story to your alerts. I’m not sure what my regular posting day will be yet, so I do suggest adding the story to your alerts. Regardless, you are so fabulous.
Ana Jr.: Yes, the stones still exist. James Leopold originally wanted to destroy the one they retrieved from Vision, but Robin said not to.
Agent Laura: I’m not sure either is an option for her. If she tells the psychologist or addiction specialist that the trigger was her fiancé getting swallowed by a monolith that allows people to travel through time, what would happen? Granted, this is a world where half of the people disappeared, but some things are still too weird.
Anthony love: I’m just happy we have Coulson back, mainly because he’s now my acting Deputy Director.
BITC: So, I need to ask my best friend if he’s actually heterosexual? That is what I’m getting from you deciding to talk about an alien invasion instead of addressing that. Although I always knew Ruby’s mom was screwed up. I just got that vibe from her. Plus, Ruby was the only one who really got how controlling my mom is.
Purple arrow 2018: You killed somebody because you made a deal to protect me, so that's another body on me. It doesn't matter that he was some domestic terrorist trying to hurt little kids. I didn't want you to become me. I'm not a good person, but you are.
Spoiler warning: This conversation covers the events of the climax of Spider-Man: Homecoming. If you happen to have a copy for home viewing, you may want to watch. I purposely lined things up so this chapter would not come out until after the movie was available for home viewing in the US at least. Also I wanted to look at one scene one more time.
“So, I have good news and bad news,” Tony said, walking into the guest room Pepper took Steve to after storytime earlier. He was carrying his overnight bag.
Girl Friday: Hey dad, were you the one that put them in a room with one bed? Because neither one of them took the couch.
Pepper pot: I’m never telling them that. I would prefer not to get locked out of the company before Morgan is old enough to take over.
“Friday just wanted to let me know that apparently my other self was almost murdered by the estranged wife of that poor hook-up choice. She targeted other Tony because the wife assumed he was the Avenger that the staffer screwed, not you because you’re all apple pies and straightness.” Tony couldn’t help but snort at that. “Apparently, she tried to murder me with sunflower seeds at a fundraiser. Your wife was posing as my date, BTW.” Steve started laughing hysterically at that point.
Of course you knew about Artie. Tony says, best friends always know stuff like that. I should’ve known that you would know, but I was just scared and I wasn’t ready to talk about it. Honestly, a part of me was hoping that if I had the right woman, the other part would go away too. That’s how people thought back when we were growing up. I thought Peggy could be that one. Maybe she could have been if things were different, but I wonder if it would’ve been enough.
This is the last conversation to be posted before Infinity War comes out. I have three more chapters after this that are completed or in proofreading. I have four more chapters in draft that I hope to finalize this weekend and send out for proofreading. I might even try for a fifth. My goal is to have everything done but the post-credits scenes before the movie comes out. I’m not sure if I’ll be emotionally ready to write next week. I might be all hyped up or I may be in tears. It’s hard to dictate when you’re crying.
Me: I am trying. And I know you do have the bad guys in custody. That was not a weapon that you would want on the street.
Me: I remember you talking about your neighbor Nurse Kate, who just happened to remind you of your mom. Are you aware that old SHIELD manipulated you? I wonder if they arranged for Ms. Garner to get a new job across the country so that the apartment would be free.
Tony: So, you probably heard by now that Laura from the Good timeline managed to get multiple text messages from home. Because the princess and multiple Leo Fitzes are alive there. Apparently, they managed to perfect trans-dimensional text messaging in under 24 hours.
Me: No because my James has authorized that we develop another LMD prototype with a different operating system. Preferably one that doesn’t look like anybody alive or dead. So, science will go on.
HSBF: Not well because they still asked you about it. Although, thank you for not mentioning Bucky. I prefer for as little to get out about that is possible.
“She has also drawn you and me growing old together, so I hope we find that pathway." Steve almost sounded hopeful.
"I'm not really either but we are getting better at it. I'm really trying with him." Tony answered honestly.
Anthony: I just wanted to keep living and if the world knew I was dying, I wouldn’t have been able to do that.
Thank you for the cookies and the edible bouquet. They were delicious as always, or at least what was left in the refrigerator was delicious after the little vultures devoured the bouquet. They made an excellent post engineering binge snack. I may have gone in headfirst which is why I didn’t write when I arrived yesterday.
D Fitzsimmons: I'm not sure if this will work, but I'm going to try anyway. This is the perfect time because the Princess is having a frappe in the living room, and grandpa is making out with Hunter in the corner. In between talking shit about me because he still thinks I'm the same guy who sold out Daisy to the Blues. Because they're distracted, this is the best time to send you a bunch of text messages to see how you're doing. They won't be looking over my shoulder to see me asking you how much you drank today. Or if you were drinking while in the lab. I don't like it when you do that.
Logan's breath hitched in answer, his hands tightening a little on Scott's ass as he rolled his hips upwards slightly. His gaze moved up to Scott's eyes, and that was all the assurance Logan needed. He wanted to make sure that Scott wasn't just trying to make everything seem normal. The desire Logan saw when he looked into his lover's eyes was enough to convince Logan they'd be okay. "After you put it that way, I think I might lose my marbles a little if ya don't, darlin'," Logan decided.
The ringing in Clint's ears was subsiding, his vision clearing. He leaned against the wall, letting the cool surface soothe his wounds. He tensed as Victor tore Phil's shirt away. He wanted to scream at Victor to leave his handler alone, scream at Phil for drawing Creed's attention to himself in the first place. Instead, he watched, jaw clenched. He knew that doing anything would just fuel the fire. //Goddammit.//
It was dangerously hard to focus on what Tony was saying. He wore a casual, dark blazer with jeans and a white shirt that was unbuttoned just a bit too much. Just enough to be completely distracting. Steve sat in the front row - a privilege afforded to all of the Avengers, though he'd been the only one to take Tony up on the offer - of the Stark Symposium. Tony's speech was the kick off for a three day scientific binge of presentations of a very hardcore, very technical bent.
Clint looked up at the sound of his last name and Phil's commanding tone. It seemed to have clicked something over in his mind. Panicking wouldn't do them any good, much as he wanted to have a total meltdown. It felt better to have Phil's hands on him, to be pulled in close, to know that they were together at least. They'd held each other similarly the night before, in Phil's bed, and it hurt all over again to think about it. "Okay." He swallowed and took another, deeper breath as he sat up a little, pressing himself more fully against Coulson. "Alright, we get out together." He sighed and looked around the cell. It was bare, save for a rough-looking toilet, a scuzzy sink, and some mats that were obviously intended as a place to sleep. "Not the best options to get us out of this mess."
"As far as instruments are concerned, this thing barely exists. I haven't been able to weigh it, get a measure of its volume, or even reliably measure the handle." He brought up a blurry looking picture. "Even this changes subtly."
It was sensory overload in the best of all possible ways being trapped between the two men. Steve fumbled with the nightstand drawer and was rewarded with the discovery of a mostly full bottle of lube and a box of condoms. Steve hesitated, ultimately deciding the decision was up to Tony. He nodded toward the box. "Would you like me to wear one? I can't actually catch anything, so I can't actually give you anything, but..." He knew it was the norm and wanted Tony to feel comfortable even if he vastly preferred the idea of there being absolutely nothing between them.
Logan nodded. He wasn't exactly the person to go to for dealing with things in a healthy manner. Still, he could certainly relate. "You don't haveta be normal 'til you're ready to. Promise." He gave Scott a faint smile, running a hand through the man's hair. "Listen, I know we kinda dove in head first on... everything, so it's in your court now. I'm lettin' you set the pace." He leaned in for a light kiss, then smirked a little. "Mostly, anyway. But I just want ya to know that I ain't expectin' more 'n you feel like givin'."
Coulson fished a fluffy blanket out of the trunk at the foot of his bed. By the time he got back, Clint looked half gone. Carefully Coulson spread the blanket over him and did his best not to linger over the job despite Clint looking unfairly adorable curled up asleep on his couch. Coulson allowed himself only a moment to watch before he returned to his vigil at the monitors.
Avenger Ana: I think that information would be in the reports. A standalone Stark pad is waiting for you on floor 27.
“Not new. It’s something that I’ve been planning for a little while, but with all the stuff going on recently on that side of the country and Yo-Yo’s recent relocation, it just made sense. Also with Carter keeping an eye on Lane we could have more recruits soon. Maybe she will even find the Pyms, who shouldn’t have even been brought into the Accords mess in the first place,” Tony explained.
We’ll talk more when you get back to New York. Mary says that will be sometime next week. [Redacted] will be looking forward to it. He wants a science play date. I’m sure we will be in the compound by then. Joey offered to watch him there while I finished things at my job. I hate taking [Redacted] out of school but it’s for the best.
Me: I've been held a couple of times under the California version of the hold so that's what I use. Not recently, which is kind of surprising. Actually, I'm surprised nobody ordered it after Afghanistan or during the Palladian poisoning incident. It probably would've been a good idea. Okay, you guys probably should’ve thought about it after the murder bot fiasco.
: Melinda Qiaolian May nee Garner. Also referred to as Captain Rogers’s former girlfriend. Agent of Shield and member of UN Avengers. Current keeper of the Captain America shield. Completely in love with “Agent Agent” and refuses to admit it.
Tony: And all of Peggy’s letters and everything else so they’ll exist somewhere. Even then I would want to keep those things because of the people who wrote them, not because of what they are. People are more important than things.
Anthony: Which you will be in charge of because I can’t lecture anybody about not being reckless. I can’t be that much of a hypocrite. I could, but I choose not to be.
“Joking about your death is also on the list. Also, the kids. That is definitely a line I won’t cross.” Tony replied sternly.
Anthony: Also significantly less nudity than last time. Sad panda. But pre-serum Steve is still fuckable. Oh, so fuckable.
Okay, I bet you all have questions now. Answers will follow in subsequent chapters. But to answer the main question, there are now two Leopold Fitzs in the current timeline. Right now, let’s just call him Monkey Lover 2. What is Monkey Lover 2 trying to accomplish now that he’s back in 2016? How long has Monkey Lover 2 been in the past? How has his presence affected our timeline? Where is Monkey Lover 1 right now? Finally, what is going on between Football Hunter and Monkey Lover 2? All questions to be answered eventually.
My friends are where I get my love from. I discovered early on that blood doesn’t mean that much. The people who loved me were my real family. Maria tried, but I feel like Jarvis and Anna were my real parents. There was also Aunt Peggy. I don’t think I would’ve survived my adolescence without her.
“It could, or we’ve already changed it just by you being aware. Robin was drawing pictures of the world breaking apart until Radcliffe was arrested and his LMD destroyed. Then she started drawling that.” The Princess said, pointing to the purple guy. “Everything is in motion.”
At that point, Tony decided it was best to put his phone away and focus on everything that was the church of the Divine Genius Princess. The lab was beautiful, and even though this wasn’t his first time there, Tony was still inspired by it. He wants something just like it in the new house he is designing for him and Steve in Alexandria. Fitzsimmons is getting the Arlington house as their wedding present. But being the head of not Shield means having a permanent residence somewhere in the DMV, and therefore he's working on something new.
"The beard and the biceps, but you're sexier." Tony said as he leaned over to kiss Steve on the mouth. He cherished every aspect of it because he knew his time with Steve was short. He was going to have to go back sooner than Wednesday, he just knew it.
Counselor Laura: We're doing an all-hands meeting? The last one ended with Simmons throwing up on my shoes.
The new consultant: Just incredibly obtuse. I really wish you would’ve figured out your ridiculous behavior regarding Benji was a crush when we were freshmen.
Francis: I wasn’t there for the apocalypse because I ignored Fury’s calls and May’s calls.  I think I hung up on Coulson twice.
Anthony: And we all know I’m really bad at it. The whole thing with Michelle was why I didn’t tell anybody about the Palladium poisoning. I wanted my last few days or what I thought were going to be my last few days to be good. I didn’t want my friends to run away from me because they couldn’t deal with it. I didn’t want people to look at me with pity or be crying all the time.
Me: Well we already established that you were not trying to kill me just trying to keep me from killing someone else and, unlike the great Hawkeye, you don’t keep non-lethal projectiles on you. I forgave you before your Royal friend brought medical help and a hell of a lot of painkillers. Even if I didn’t realize that at the time.
“Engagement ring?” That’s when Hunter realize he said way too much. Okay, the smack on his shoulder from Leo tells him that he said too much.
Captain Tight Pants: She was one-of-a-kind and losing her for good hurt.  Then Bucky happened and I wasn't thinking rationally.
Genius Princess: Sleep is overrated. I know you were part of the briefing, especially because Stark asked for a favor. We have a month until Thanos arrives if things stay the same as they did in the other timeline. We may not have that much time. I promise all rest once we get this done.
"I am well aware that he had to be knocked out to keep him from coming back to the states. He also broke Clint's jaw. Lilly is going to kick him in the shins if we ever figure out a way to legally get Steve back in the country. You know one that doesn't involve an alien invasion." Tony remarked.
Purple Princess 2018: Yes. Plus Steve. We need all notes related to Clint 2023 traveling back to this timeline. Again we have a Simmons who can understand them. Also, we need anything about the location of the stones at present.
“What did May say that has you blushing so much?” Afia asked. Flash tried to answer, but Peter quickly placed his hand over Flash's mouth. Peter was not going to think about the fact that his entire body started to tingle at the touch of his lips against his fingers. He wasn’t going to think about it at all because then Flash licked his hand. That caused him to let go.
I thought about reclassifying this as a text message conversation, but I see it as Ana just trying to help Deke write his report by conducting an interview.
“We didn’t know each other that well the first time around, and we did okay,” Steve said, putting an arm around Tony.
Tony: And that makes her want to take a stand, but this is just what she’s willing to say on television. She told Purple Arrow where all the other bodies were.
“That is good to know. I don’t know how we managed to piss off Laura so quickly, but I think I’m going to have to get her a shoe basket. Normally wine would be next, but that would be an inappropriate present for Laura.”
PS: Sky Quake is back with the team, for the moment anyway. I’ll try to get her to write you but I don’t think she’s ready yet after her last visit. She is sorry about that.
Tony Potts: That is strangely comforting. Is being engaged to Captain America working for or against him?
Melinda: The director is planning to tell him after his White House visit. Or when we get back from California.
Tony Potts: That is something I would do to mess with Ross.  So you come from a world that's vastly different because unlike my Friday, his Friday actually sent those messages?
Tony: You know if it wasn’t for the fact I would get to spend two more days with you, I would of left yesterday morning and not stayed for a meeting where I’m pretty much blamed for everything wrong, not just in their country, but the world in general. But that's a normal thing. I should’ve known this was going to happen when I was told that Senator Hateful’s Chief of Staff would be attending.
Me: Absolutely horrible. I think Yo-Yo may have disarmed somebody after the interview was over, but I can’t be sure.
Agent 13: I had to read all the Cuddle Bunny messages because my former employers were sadists. Although it wasn't until recently that I found out Melinda was real and not something created to throw Ross off. Not only that, but she did my paperwork when I joined Shield.
Me: Well, he should have told us that Ross was being a threatening asshole instead of running away and serving his wife with divorce papers. Or rather, running a solo mission to take the asshole out.
“She put forth a solid case." Steve really shouldn't glare at Tony when he is driving, but he does anyway. "Plus, you know I hate seeing things abandoned and dilapidated. I had to do something during my retirement, and real estate seemed like a good idea. Although I'm going to give a lot of it to the Jarvis foundation. Homelessness is going to be a big problem. We can turn a lot of those places into shelters."
"Good," Clint purred, his breath hitching as he felt Darien's muscles tighten around him. Almost as if he could hear Darien's desires, he murmured, "You don't cum until I tell you to." He couldn't blame the other man. He wanted more, too. Reluctantly, he shoved Darien away, onto the plushly carpeted floor. He didn't allow the separation to last long, though, more or less pouncing on his partner. He nipped roughly at Darien's lower lip as he guided his cock to the man's entrance once more, his hooded gaze fixed on Darien's face. He was silent for a moment as a drop of sweat trickled along his jawline, then, "Beg me for it."
Phil knew it didn't take psychic abilities to pick up on the nervous energy in the room. "Professor, forgive us for-"
Phil did his best not to demand that Clint stay the hell away from the hammer. They'd lost a lot, and he hadn't missed the look on Steve's face, the realization of how badly they'd screwed it all up trying to keep Clint away in the first place. He couldn't agree to the plan aloud, though, when all he wanted was to take Clint back to his suite and keep him safe.
"I believe the good doctor has a few choice words to share with you, sir, but I have managed to negotiate an appointment a half hour from now."
While Fitz looked openly offended, Simmons beamed her pleasure. She passed her counterpart a smug smile and went back to eating her sandwich.
"The more you talk, the more I like you," Loki observed decisively. He arched an eyebrow at Creed. "Are all humans so obsessed with having only what is denied to them when it comes to sex?"
Clint nodded his understanding. He got it. Burdening other people with the shit they had to deal with on a daily basis just seemed cruel from any perspective, and enjoying everything they could while they could was practically written SHIELD policy. "Well, that's fair. Then, aside from cancelling plans to bend me over the island, what are we doing with our day, boss?" he asked, smiling impishly. "Last outing was on my schedule, so now it's your turn. Just no orchestral opera things."
Tony groaned and arched his head back at the skin-to-skin contact, his breath leaving him in a low groan as their cocks slid nicely against one another. He stared dumbly at Loki for a moment, admiring the look of arousal on the god's face, trying to absorb what he was saying. When it finally sank in, he nodded and grabbed for the bottle, slicking his hand thoroughly. Oily digits trailed down Loki's lower abdomen before wrapping first around his cock and then around Tony's. The billionaire didn't know for sure what Loki had planned, but he was willing to make some leaps based on their current positions. Grasping the god's lean, tight ass with both hands, he pulled Loki forward, rocking his own hips up to let their slicked cocks glide against one another. He leaned up for a kiss, making sure he had Loki's attention fully before letting his well lubed fingers glide between the god's buttocks, testing the waters.
Coulson found himself looking down, unable to watch the intimacy in front of him. It had nothing to do with the kissing and everything to do with the quiver in Tony's voice and the way the two men looked at each other. He wondered why it has taken them so long to notice that they fit together so well it was a little disturbing.
Just as they pulled into the parking lot and began the trek in to get Tony a room, Steve's phone buzzed. He lifted the device up and slowly and deliberately brought up the message. Thanks to the phone's design and Tony's enhancements to it, the image Pepper had sent came through almost immediately, and Steve went pale all over again. "No..."
"I like that too. It's different. Just running into someone while I'm grabbing a cup of coffee." Phil followed the observation with a wry smile given the rather awkward encounter the day before. "As for Loki, we're going to find him, and we're going to take him out. And this time we're going to speak to Thor about a more permanent solution to the issue." They couldn't force the future king of Asgard to kill his brother, but they could strongly suggest it. At the very least Coulson wanted to know how the hell Loki had come to be free again to start with. He was dangerous enough in chains. More quietly, he added, "I don't like that we haven't heard from Thor in all of this. It makes me nervous."
"I think you're pretty well spoken," Steve answered with a laugh. "How about I go get us some food? If we're planning to spend all night in bed, I'll need sustenance. Any requests?"
Tony raised an eyebrow. "Considering we're already friends with the X-Men, I have a feeling we're not exactly on their Christmas card list as it is," he noted. "And you're right; I probably am losing my marbles. What few I had. But I think SHIELD already decided I was unstable, so I'm sure it's nothing a few pills and some whiskey won't fix." //The God of Mischief thinks I'm going nuts. I thought it'd be colder when hell froze over.// "Though if you think I'm losing it, they may skip all that and go right for the straight jacket and six months of containment."
Logan allowed himself the faintest quirk of a smile. "I'll try." //And now that you know he's into guys, it just gets a little weirder... And more difficult to not think about...// He coughed a little as if to interrupt his own thoughts. "That whole friends thing, though... Not sure if you haven't had enough to drink... or need more," he quipped, pulling the fridge open. "One more? And if you're gonna pick up guys, maybe you can just take me along so I can smack down anyone I think might be a sociopath."
Agent Laura: That’s horrible. She’s so nice. We’ve visited her a few times.  She adores Afia and Miles. She thinks Flash is a prick, but that’s his defense mechanism half the time.
Tony Potts: Actually, if he spoke to me before then, there may not have been a wedding. I could have helped May get custody of her kids with the legal team. But no, he just had to do it himself. Is it really that hard to ask for help? Or is it only hard for him to ask for my help?
“That’s not necessary Karen and why did I put that protocol in there?” He starting to wonder if he should spend some quality time with Karen before handing her back over to the oldest kid. He feels like there are some bugs he needs to work out.
Anthony: A 1 AM wedding would have better especially with the jet lag and your constant calling to DC to check up on May.
Person my boss is in love with: There are moments where I wish for a super villain time machine just so I can go back and knock some sense into Howard.
Iron Dad: First, you’re a Junior Avenger, or maybe we should go with Young Avenger. I’ll have Jeffrey do a focus group. Regardless, you must be out of college before you get to be a full-fledged Avenger, and that goes for both you and Benji.
“That part you actually told me.” And he was a little bitter about that, so progress. “Also, they somehow managed to have a Sharon in the film by pure randomness. I think that was why dad sued. Sharon had Howard wrapped around her little finger when she was little. It made me think that dad always wanted me to be a girl." Tony confessed.
Morgan’s dad: I’m glad Morgan has a friend even if she is nearly 8 years older than her. She’s almost like a big sister. This is good because, as you probably know, being an only child is lonely.
This is Stefan, Tony’s new boyfriend. Well, I think I’m his new boyfriend. It’s complicated when you’re in another country and you’re mostly dating by correspondence. Although I don’t expect Tony to send me a Dear John letter any time soon. I hope not, at least. I saw that too many times during the war.
Me: No. Ross wanted somebody who he could manipulate be in charge of Shield since Talbot made sure to strip Ross of as much power as he could in exchange for bringing Shield back into the government. Lucky for Ross, his family member, by marriage, just managed to get superpowers.
Me: Look, I really am over the break up. We weren’t working and as much as I loved her, we couldn’t be what we needed. She was never going to accept my need to look for bad things that need to be handled. At least you understand that.
Tony: I keep lobbying the government to come up with something that won’t break your integrity or put a bull’s-eye on your back. You keep being you in other countries in the meantime. Maybe with your Royal friend having a state dinner with the President next week will move superhero relations forward.
Morgan’s dad: That reminds me to let you know that Pepper had Hunter bring the kids to the city to stay with her at the penthouse. We thought it was best since we don't know precisely how long it will take me to decipher Simmons’s notes to figure out what the fuck she did. Are you okay with that? I should've asked you that last night, but I got in the zone.
Me: Sharon has another theory. She believes his wife found out that her husband fucked an Avenger, but didn't know exactly which one. Since I am the only one that's openly bi, I became the lucky winner. She conveniently forgot about Scarlet and the spider.
Anthony: Yes, although I left out the part about grandpa Stark being an alcoholic cheating Bastard and dad having to lie, steal and cheat his way into getting a college education, after the guy most likely died young of liver failure and venereal disease. There’s a long family history of alcoholism and probably sex addiction in there.
Anthony love: Because May was already freaking out with her boyfriend missing in a very May way. Joey, Bobbi, the sister-in-law, and Vision will be heading over there to investigate after playing for the cameras in Mumbai. Actually, Bobbi is on her way now because she can’t be on camera due to Russian government issues.
Also minor spoilers for Agents of Shield episode 4.2 and beyond. I’m borrowing one of the characters introduced.
Monkey lover 2: Maybe. But I don't know for sure because I don't know exactly what Ross did there, just that it was terrible.
Me: For a long time, the only people in your life were Pepper, Rhodey, and him. Now there’s a lot more and he’s not used to having to share your attention with so many.
Your boyfriend also wrote me to express his well wishes. It was attached to the edible arrangement. Let him know I appreciate it. I would write myself, but I don't have his email address. Anyway, we can talk more when we see each other Monday.
Football Hunter: Hunter Leopold is such a lovely name, though. And we wouldn't actually be married. It would be undercover work.
“A friend who may become the next Deputy Secretary of State. I am still wrapping my mind around that one.”
Anthony: Although I’m sure the Manhattan University Children's Hospital will like all these bears. I’m doing an event Monday for Labor Day. I don't know what to do with the flowers and balloons, though.
Me: See, you assume that by signing the accord I’m going to mindlessly accept whatever they tell me to do.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. Now for something different in honor of Steve surviving 98 years of life, a conversation not from the perspective of Tony or Steve's cell phone. I'm going to let you guess who "me" is in this chapter. I will let you know in the next chapter.
"Yes. And Coulson.” At that point, Steve just stares at Tony. "Might as well throw in a box of something chocolate for May and Yo-Yo. I’ve kind of been a jerk. But hey, if they lifted the sex ban. I would be so much mellower right now." Tony argued.
Before you read the next conversation, I just want to let you know that this is still Steve’s phone, but it’s a new phone with a brand-new address book. The in universe explanation is Steve is ready to get a little more personal with Tony. The real reason why is I started to get the red phone and the blue phone tags confused because they were too similar, as seen way back in conversation 16 where I labeled something as Steve’s comment when it was really a Tony comment.
"That's been established well before we met. Personally, I'm astonished it hasn't happened yet. Romanoff even knows my food allergies. I'm surprise that the slipping sunflower seeds into my food hasn't happened earlier."
Me: It won’t work. The only thing that would get her to not make us do this is telling her who you really are and my BFF said that’s not an option. So answer the damn question sexy pants.
Tony: Maybe we’ll get lucky and the qualified woman running against Present Ellis will win despite how dirty the campaign is getting.
Tony: Completely plausible. I did some of my stupidest stuff during 2001 and I totally would’ve slept with a scientist at a conference.
Me: Rescuing 20 people from a human trafficking ring with the help of super strength will get you on people’s radars. The ATCU just think Nomad is some newbie triggered by the ‘alien contagion’ using his powers to help stop the sexual exploitation of minors.
Logan, crouched in the back of his cell, didn't move. The remains of Clint's arrow were still scattered across the concrete floor; Logan had cut the projectile from his chest the moment he'd regained a little lucidity. No one had had the nerve to get in the cell with him and remove them, though. In fact, the agents had been drawing straws to see who had to get close enough to pass him a tray of food. Apparently, he'd gotten a lot crazier before he'd finally calmed down, no doubt because whatever was riding around in the back of his brain had finally figured out that he wasn't getting out of the cell. "Y'know, Rogers... I never figured on askin' someone to put me in a cage," he finally muttered, pushing himself away from the wall. It was awkward. While he'd still been disabled, they'd fitted him with adamantium gloves, keeping him from extending his claws. Moving to the door, he leaned against it, pressing his face to the clear blast proof polymer that served as a window. "How's Scott?" he wanted to know. He'd heard the agents mention the man's name enough times to know that something had happened. "And Nat?"
Steve blushed at that. He'd never been able to afford glasses before despite needing them, and the thought of bothering hadn't even occurred to him. That it had to Tony was a gesture of attentive sweetness that he made a note to reward the man for later. "Thanks," he answered, stealing a kiss as the door opened. "I think this is your stop. I'll head up and make myself more presentable. You try not to convince Bruce to kill you." Steve put a hand up to stop the elevator doors from closing. "No serum talk, okay? That's... that's a talk I need to be part of too when and if the time comes. Loki's our problem right now." He waited until he got at least tacit agreement from Tony before letting the doors close behind the man.
At first Steve had been more than a little annoyed at the pause. He didn't want Logan to stop, and he didn't want Tony to stop either - and then it all clicked into place. Apparently he had just enough blood above his beltline to put it together because Steve hummed his approval as the head of Tony's cock slid between his lips and Logan began to move once more. He was definitely beginning to see the appeal of threesomes. Keeping track of two lovers at a time instead of one was difficult, but it was also rewarding enough to be worth the effort. Every nerve in Steve's body tingled with sensation, and even when he could hardly catch his breath, he didn't want it to end.
Logan couldn't help but chuckle a little when he saw what Scott was referring to. "She is. Damn," he remarked. Nat had a way of manipulating people. It was interesting to see how that went when she applied those skills somewhere other than interrogation.
Though Steve deflated slightly at the news, he understood. Heart pounding, he pulled up the report and scanned it once he was free of the suit. They hadn't seen Loki. They hadn't seen anything that let them know where they were. The man sighed and slumped into a nearby chair. He'd hoped for more, but immediately felt guilty for that. Phil and Clint were alive and at least well enough to file a report, and that was a lot. That was enough. It had to be. They’d find a way to run a trace or track the transportation, and then they could close in. Hope wasn’t lost.
Clint laughed around the mouthful of food, but had the decency to swallow it before he replied, "Hey, as long as you're only easy for me, we're just fine." He winked playfully. "Besides, it can be our secret. And besides," he took another chunk of funnel cake, giving Phil a look that would have been more suited to a pinup model's attempt at 'innocent', "I have no idea what you're talking about."
Clint took a seat next to Phil. Though neither of them spoke, it felt better being close to the man. It felt protected in some intrinsic way he didn't fully understand. They understood, and neither one of them would hold back if it came down to another fight. That knowledge was enough.
"Bruce, if it was your boyfriend struggling to carry a few cokes and sandwiches up here for lunch, you wouldn't be so fucking self-righteous," Tony snapped, then took a moment to get himself together and looked back at Fitz-Simmons. "Thanks for even trying. I'm sure you'll figure something out." Still shaking a little from his outburst, Tony settled into his usual seat and started tinkering with files again.
Clint glanced at the blindfold, then the agent, wondering just when Fury had commissioned it and how many of the low level agents had any clue what Scott could do. Deciding it didn't matter, Clint held it open and approached Scott. "Just... hold still." He wanted to apologize to the man, beg for forgiveness, but it seemed a little inappropriate.
Hunter: I know Morgan is your everything. Just like Fitz was Simmons everything. The grandkid was a close second, and now they're both gone. She’s lost because she lost everything. I hate when she’s this lost.
Melinda: They’re still under the Accords for the moment and so are we. Daisy’s going to have to sign, despite the Senate calling for Nadeer’s expulsion, now that Daisy is sticking around. Robbie can’t.
“But why not? Not only could the secret to getting them back be in this book, but we could send you back to your home time/dimension. Don’t you want to be with your Jamuna?” Simmons argued.
Also another reminder Steve doesn’t know that Melinda Gardner and Agent Melinda May a.k.a. agent scary are the same person. Tony is kind of afraid to tell him that. I am now accepting guesses on when and how Steve figures this out.
"I feel like I need to be there during his bad judgment calls. He always stood by me, so I need to do that for him. Besides, he did what he did because he was mad at me. That means some of this was on me." Tony explained. But Steve just shook his head.
Anthony: You don’t get to decide how somebody else feels about you. Sometimes I wish I could. My childhood would have been a lot easier if I could just make Howard love me.
Purple Arrow: Maybe not the best version. Has Friday told you about what I’ve been doing over the last five years?
Sorry, I can’t do anything about the brother. 13 is a weird age, and he’s probably not going to come out of it for a while. Hopefully, the stupidity will wear off sooner rather than later. If I could, I would send the other kids to Malta as well. However, I know them too well at this point. Also, at least one of them has field training. The other one has been trained by Pepper which can be just as lethal. Anyway, I’ll be back soon.
BFF Ned: Actually, was it all an optical illusion? He was supposedly in New York Friday, but there are rumors of the hammer being in Norway right now.
Purple Princess 2018: We will have to do another all-hands meeting to discuss the idea with the stones. Dad and Steve will be back at 2 PM our time, but I'll try to get everyone else on board. I think we can do another meeting then.
Galileo is the name of the European equivalent to GPS. The Russian counterpart is called Glonass, which may also be referenced in the story eventually.
Me: No, Sugar Pie gets to leave Wednesday. I have to play nice Thursday and then I have a few meetings in France, and yes, I promise not to touch the wine. So I think I get back to the country about a week from today.
Me: Allegedly, scare them to death. It doesn’t matter. I’m fine now. I’m resting and waiting for Leo and Fitzsimmons to give me the all clear. I want to get back to LA to figure out what’s going on. Phil won’t let me.
“As soon as we switch rooms, I consent very enthusiastically.” Steve kissed him again, “No ice play or temperature play of any type. That includes candle wax. I prefer not to top, at least at first, because of my powers.”
Person my boss is in love with: The fact that there was a Shield investigation means that it was not an accident. Actually, the fact that there was a mention of it in the Hydra files points to that alone.
Genius Princess: Also, we have much better methods of contraception and disease prevention. If desired, I will make arrangements for you.
“I’m well aware I am a bit of a prick. At least that’s what came out when Pepper and I were in couples therapy. I wonder if our old therapist would help us?” He and Steve definitely needed couples therapy.
"Thor, would you and Sif mind grabbing Magneto? I don't think Logan should be alone with him. As long as Magneto is conscious, I don't like the odds on him getting his skeleton ripped out." Natasha waited until Thor consented before she turned to Logan. "You're with me getting Bruce to calm down." Oddly she had a feeling Logan's abrasive manner might help. He was a little like Tony in some ways, and Tony had always brought out the gentler side even of the Hulk. It was an odd miracle she was more than willing to capitalize on. "We'll meet you at the shiny bridge with our rainbow shoes on."
Logan had to take a minute to wonder how he kept getting conned into things that would likely result in a lot of hurting, but then Steve reminded him without prompting. He hesitated at the blonde's next question, though. Talking about his past didn't usually come easily. But at least the Cap seemed like he would be able to understand to some extent. "Clearly? Maybe back to the late eighties. Woke up on three mile island in the middle o' what looked like a disaster area. I get little bits 'n' pieces before that: the Civil War, D-Day, Vietnam. Used to think they were just dreams. Then I ran into some folks that told me I could actually be around two hundred years old." He snorted. "Sure as hell feel like it some days."
Steve stared at Tony like he'd lost his mind. He was fairly certain that Tony must have lost his mind to even be considering that as a plan. "That's not... that is not the back up plan," he stated as clearly as possible, trying his damndest not to sound panicked even if he felt it. "Tony, I barely lived through using that thing, and even with modifications... you couldn't do it. Not and... You killing yourself for a potential shot at maybe taking out Loki isn't an option."
Clint nodded, idly munching popcorn. "Yeah, we actually talked about maybe doing some camping and fishing. I might have to talk him into the boar hunting, though," he said with a wry grin. "He apparently thinks that shooting at an animal that can tear your legs off isn't very relaxing." He shook his head. "Some people. Just can't get them to try things before they decide they won't like them."
Normally Steve might have tried to swat Tony's hand out of the way, but as it was, he couldn't bear to let go of his hold on Tony's hip. Coupled with that was the fact that Tony looked sinfully gorgeous stroking himself, and soon Steve was gasping out a warning that the end was close. Feeling the heat of Logan pressed in against him, Steve let his eyes flutter closed for just a moment. He savored every sensation surrounding him, let it wash over him as he finally began to move more quickly. His hips snapped forward faster, though Steve remained ever mindful not to squeeze too hard or move too fast. If he hurt Tony through losing control, he would never forgive himself - besides, the last thing he wanted to do was kill the mood when everything felt so good. Steve shuddered and buried his face in Tony's neck as he finally came with a gasp that sounded suspiciously like the billionaire's name.
"I don't want to hide this," Phil repeated patiently. "Neither one of us has a stable public relationship track record even if it's for completely different reasons. I'm not too worried about what other people say, I'm worried about us." Maintaining his reputation was one thing. Making Clint feel marginalized for the sake of it was something else, something Phil wasn't willing to consider. "We'll take the hits. Probably a lot of them. Probably some inappropriate comments that we'll both have to deal with in our own special ways. Just don't permanently injure any fellow agents, and I'll try not to fire anyone. I think we can handle that."
"Whatever happened to 'go big or go home'?" Tony wondered aloud, though he didn't argue. "Fine. I vote for a cabin in the backwoods of Europe somewhere, though. And we don't need plane tickets. I have a few of those things laying around somewhere. Planes. I'm kind of a rich guy, remember?" Tony hadn't really used any of his private jets since developing the suit, so it seemed like as good an excuse as any to dig one out of the mothballs.
"Don't worry, we'll ask Thor to take us up on vacation sometime," Natasha assured. She felt at ease the second Bruce was Bruce again. From inside one of the pockets on her belt, she passed the man his glasses. "Thought you might need these unbroken." They found Thor and Sif, both grim-faced, waiting with a bound and gagged Magneto at the bridge. "You really should learn to pick better allies." From what she'd seen in his file, Magneto wasn't an idiot. He also wasn't a garden variety villain. He just had a really screwed up idea of what qualified as helping. "The guy you hitched your star to? He's a certifiable nut job."
Tony finally drew away from the kiss. It was a little hard to concentrate with the others bickering around them, anyway. Besides, he had promised to vouch for Loki. "Look, he didn't kill me. And believe me, he could have." He took a deep breath. He knew that what he was about to say might well just result in everyone questioning his sanity rather than the intended effect. "He surrendered, he called off the Brotherhood, he made sure I didn't die, and he's the only one that can make sure that Legolas over there doesn't spend the rest of his life in the Fridge, so how about we maybe take him back to the Tower and debrief him?" He glanced at Loki. It was striking how vulnerable the god looked, unarmed and without his helmet and looking at Sif like she was the end of the line.
"Your little dance floor session is all over the internet. Put me on speakerphone. Stark is there, isn't he?"
Steve gasped Tony's name and clutched at his lover's back. It was nice knowing that he wasn't likely to hurt the man because it was hard not to hold fast. He spread his legs wider to give Tony better access with no hint of his earlier hesitance. Being hesitant was categorically impossible with Tony Stark staring at him like he was the tastiest thing on the menu. "I don't think I'd say no to that... the last part there? That sounds pretty good."
"No, but that doesn't make it less difficult to deal with, unfortunately. I think... at the moment, I think coping is the best it can be described as." Phil absently began stroking Clint's hair. In front of Natasha, he wasn't worried about holding back or being appropriate. "We'll get there. We're both going to do our shrink sessions, and it... horrible as it is, it helps having someone who understands."
"Well, when you put it that way, I suppose we're rather dull tag alongs, Fitz and I," she teased, though it was an odd thought. Loki fit. He really did. That only made it more surreal. "It might actually work. Mr. Stark was right. He might... I'm not sure Agent Barton and Agent Coulson will be very happy about that." Jemma bit her lip. The pair of them had been through a great deal, and she hated to think that they would suffer for the mercy of letting Loki join the team. "After what he did, it's difficult to... well, how do you ignore someone killing another member of the team? Maybe more than one member. It... well, it's not entirely standard."
Tony sighed, letting himself sink into the mattress. It felt good. Too good to let his mind latch onto the imperfections, the off cadence, the oddly formal turn of phrase. Loki was letting him have Steve, and it could have been a lot worse. The touch of lips against his neck drew nothing more than another quietly satisfied murmur from him, and his muscles relaxed, melting under the contact. "Need this. Need you," he mumbled into the pillows, letting himself forget reality for the moment.
Though the woman gave him a sidelong look, she seemed more amused than pissed, and he chose to take that for acceptance. Inside Scott found himself momentarily at a loss. His method of control had been artificial for years. He honestly wasn't sure how to make his powers work without the visor. Frustrated, Scott glanced back at Logan. "It might be safer to wait outside."
Tony looked up at that, looking earnestly surprised. "I... Uh..." He knew what Steve had been through. The serum, the war, losing his best friend, leaving his entire life and culture and decade behind, being frozen solid... That the blonde thought Tony made all that worthwhile was a little staggering. Intimidating, even. Tony swallowed. It wasn't often words failed him. Giving up on coming up with something smart to say, he reaching up and turned Steve's head into a slow, tender kiss.
The touch, completely unexpected, had made Clint jump. His gaze drifted to Coulson, and he felt the briefest impulse to lean against Coulson. Clint pressed his lips together, trying to get a grip. "Me too," he rasped out. He stared hard at the other man, trying to reaffirm to himself that Coulson was real, was right there with him. "I thought... back at the Fridge... I thought Loki was going to kill you again. I saw the security videos of when he..." Clint's voice cracked, and he took a deep breath. "I could see it happening all over again, and even being there, I didn't think there was any chance I'd stop him."
And for those who watched the Invisible Man TV series... yes, that Darien Fawkes. I bastardized him for purposes of the story. You'll see a lot more of him in the next chapter. I regret nothing.
Bucky glanced up, his eyes bright and his expression coy. “Would that be such a bad thing?” he murmured. Despite having secretly harbored feelings for Steve as far back as he could remember, it was the first time Bucky had ever made the slightest hint. He had always been the one to suggest or set up dates with girls, all the while hiding the truth about himself and how he’d felt toward Steve.  From what he could tell the world had changed a lot, and he saw no reason why he couldn’t change along with it. “I mean, I wouldn’t object,” added Bucky softly.
Clint was immediately on his feet and swaying. "Where is he? Logan can lead us to him, right?" he wanted to know, dragging his folded-up bow off the bar where he'd left it. He was ready to fight, but his thoroughly sloshed brain hadn't really jumped to the realization that if there was something they could do, Fury would have already told them to do it.
"Might do wonders for yours," Logan shot back, though someone with a sharp eye might have caught a brief smirk. "Not sure I like this whole 'Director' thing, I gotta say."
Instead of looking angry, Loki laughed at the threat and smiled with some real warmth. "I think I'm beginning to like you, Mr. Stark. I will be the absolute picture of discretion, have no fear. Captain Rogers will hear nothing of it from me. You may wish to give the same admonition to Logan. From what his brother says, he's likely to know regardless." Loki let the words sink in and shifted to sit at the edge of the bed once more, fingers steepled and arms braced on his knees as he leaned forward to address Tony. "I am endeavoring to be sincere. Honest, even. It is not my natural inclination." The god's expression clouded. "But I am earnest in my desire to find a new way of doing things even it means attempting to be polite to my brother... as long as that doesn't come up often."
Phil woke at once, consciousness flowing back into him as he shifted, stretched, and tried not to think about how sore he was and how much worse it would be after a full night of walking. "Let's do it," he agreed as they both got to their feet.They looked like they'd escaped from a deserted island and washed ashore, dusty and half dressed. It was enough to make him smile for real. "We need to come up with a very, very interesting cover story for this one. If we're going to look this ridiculous, we might as well be able to back it up with a good story for whoever finds us." Personally he hoped they'd find someone whose phone they could borrow before it came down to hitchhiking in the middle of nowhere, but he'd take what he could get.
Coulson covered Bucky’s hand with his own and gently eased it away. “You’re in the infirmary. I’m afraid I had to give you something to calm you down. Do you remember what happened back in your quarters?” He doubted it. The look on the sergeant's face had been confused at best when he “came to” the first time.
