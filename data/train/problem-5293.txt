It was dark.  That was Tony’s first thought when he woke up.  It was dark and he was…moving.  A van of some kind. One of those large ones, like for deliveries.  He was on the floor, laying with his cheek pressed to one of those mats they used to line the interior of a vehicle.  His mouth tasted funny, like metal and day old sweatsocks.  He wasn’t gagged, but his hands were tied, he noticed as he tried to flex.  Zip ties.  God, these weren’t even real professionals.  Just your run of the mill kidnappers.  Probably watched some DIY YouTube video and--
“No, no, it’s fine,” Steve rushed out.  It was.  Completely fine.  He stared at the pile of clothes that had a moment ago looked like a gift and now looked a lot like payment and felt a hot spike of humiliation crawl inside his stomach, and suddenly, he wanted to be anywhere but here.  “I’m going to see mom this morning.  They moved her to the new facility and already started rehab.”
“I like you,” the King told him in a dark, husky voice, looking up at Steve from under his lashes, eyes dark and gleaming in the low, afternoon light.  He reached out and ran a finger around the collar at Steve’s throat, then down Steve’s chest, scoring a line of heat as it went.  “I like this.”
“Tomorrow,” Tony said.  “Tomorrow, I will relinquish my Claim to you. And that shall be the end of it.  No more sleep-walking. No more voice in your head calling you to my thrall,” he paused, just slightly, “And no more dreams.”
“Oh, right. Brooklyn.  Still bitter, huh?” Rhode laughed, wiping a hand across his mouth.  “I forgot about that.  You and Barnes.  You two ever make it out to L.A. to see them play?”
“Are you truly going in there, lad?” Peran asked dubiously as they made their way down into the pit.  “You can stay out here, you know. If I’m not wrong, Josiah wouldn’t mind joining you,” he harrumphed a bit, looking over at his fellow guard, who did look a little pale, Steve noted.
Tony flattened his mouth and grunted, then leaned up and pressed his lips to Steve’s.  He pulled back and looked down, crossing his arms over Steve’s chest and pillowing his head there.  “Tony signal.”
Or, he could tell Steve there were bruises on his arms.  He could tell Steve his eyes still stung from the spray that had been wafting in the air near enough for he and Rhodey to get a few lung-fuls.  He could tell Steve he was this close to shaking apart because he was in a cell, and they’d made him feel like they could do this to him and there was nothing he could do about it. They’d made him feel powerless, and he hadn’t felt that way in a long time.  He could tell Steve he hated them a little for that.  He could tell Steve all of this or any of it, and none of Coulson’s forms could stop what would happen then.  It was, Tony could admit, probably too much power for him to have.
“Not with all those injuries. Manuel will be out by the end of the season, you watch,” Steve predicted.  “Shouldn’t have paid that much for Bay.  And letting Putz go?”
“I’m supposed to do what’s best for you,” Steve continued.  “I’m supposed to take care of you.  If you think this Simpson is better for you, then…he’s got my vote, too.”
“Nevermind, I’ll send a selection of sizes,” she said when Steve didn’t immediately respond.  “You’re at the Hotel Galaxy, right? Room 206 still?”
There are a number of comic references here, particularly with the Rings and Luke Cage.  I think the story draws a bit on what I've read of Marvel Noir fic.  Steve guarding a naked Tony from a group of aggressors is an ode to that particular comic book panel that we all probably remember seeing.
“About last night,” Brock began.  “Just wanted to say, you know, sorry I got all weird about things.” He scraped a hand through his hair. “This stuff with Stark, it kinda has me fucked up, see?”
Steve lifted his hips and caught some of the fluid as it leaked between the cleft of his ass.  He rubbed it around the rim of his hole, pushing a finger in with a moan he tried to muffle by throwing an arm over his face.  He closed his eyes. His breath was coming in heaving pants now. A fine sheen of sweat beaded across his skin, pooling beneath his back.  He felt sticky. Open. Exposed. And Tony...Tony wasn’t even looking. Tony didn’t even know. Didn’t care. No one was watching. No one would know. He thrust his finger in deeper, then added a second. It hurt, he was too dry, but he didn’t mind. It was a good kind of hurt.  A deep, emptying ache. He could like it or not like it. Do it or not. It didn’t matter. Maybe it was strange. Wrong. He didn’t know. No one knew. Not even Tony.
The Omega was down below the main hall in a small room near the stores. A small fire was crackling in the fireplace, illuminating the room in a hazy glow. Steve stopped in the doorway and stared. The room was filled with all manner of objects, most of which were beyond Steve’s knowledge of things, though he recognized what he thought were tools of a smith and thick, leather gloves that one might use for such a trade. Wood shavings covered the floor, and a small, blocky model of what was clearly meant to be the keep sat on the table. Two miniature trebuchets that looked as if they were built for mice were placed next to the small, wooden wall. Pieces of weaponry leaned against the walls. The hilt of a sword minus the blade. A bow snapped in half. The spiked ball from a large mace. Steve had no idea what to make of any of it. He looked over at Bucky, who gave him a bewildered look in return, and then grinned.
“You texted him once. And he hasn’t even texted back, Rhodey, what if he took one look at that pic and--oh,” Tony broke off.
That was next.  He wanted to stop.  Take a break, get some air, tell himself he would finish it later, but, there was something about this that felt like a penance he couldn’t step away from, a path of coals that needed to be walked at one time, so he could feel it, feel anything, by the end.
“Here,” Steve said, opening a compartment in between the two front seats and pulling out a bottle of water.  “Drink this.”  He opened the cap and held the bottle up to Tony’s mouth encouragingly.  Tony obliged, drinking a couple of sips before he realized how fucking good water was.  He grabbed for the bottle and tipped his head back, drinking deeply.  “Slowly,” Steve cautioned, reaching for the bottle and pulling it away long enough for Tony to cough through the spasms that wracked through his body.
“So,” Tony said, giving Steve a quick glance as he fiddled with the water bottle. Steve pulled out the chair next to him and sat down.
“Quera,” Steve repeated with a confused frown. He swiped his thumb over Tony’s cheek, catching a tear that had escaped.
Steve shrugged. “Have things,” he said, frowning a bit as the Omega seemed to shrink back into himself. The way the nightflower does when the sun comes up, Steve thought.
Tony picked up the book, placed the parchment on the board and grabbed the stylus from the table where he had set them and went back to his work, seemingly completely unfazed that Steve had his head buried between his thighs and Tony’s cock in his throat.
“I hate you both,” Tony sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face.  “The point is, if someone doesn’t tell me what the holy hell is going on here, I’m going to take this phone that you have so kindly given me, tap this app here, and use it to emit a high frequency electromagnetic wave that will basically turn you all into the equivalent of slobbering, knuckle-dragging meatsacks with the intellectual capacities of maybe two of those bushels of produce you two are supposed to be delivering.  On the count of three.  One. Two….”
“Well, at least that made it,” Tony sighed. The alien set the helmet down on the table next to Tony.  It’s darkened eye slits stared vacantly at him. The not-gel waved, like a sheet being tossed over a bed, and lifted from over him, peeling back like a wrapper until he was free.  Well, naked and free, but whatever. Tony pushed himself up on his elbows and reached for the helmet, turning it over in his hands. He peered around the bubble-gum dome, and, sure enough, the rest of the suit sat in carefully laid out pieces on a shelf sticking out from the wall where more of the not-gel encased one of the boots and appeared to be doing some kind of repair, or at least that was what Tony thought it was doing as he squinted at it.
“I, um…” Steve started, because he knew he had to just get this out there. Tony was, by all accounts, far more experienced than he was, considering that he’d managed a kiss and a misunderstanding over melted chocolate that was not nearly as salacious as that sounded.  He wasn’t sure what Tony expected, and felt an odd clench and drop in his stomach at the thought of his own inexperience.  Not because he didn’t want that with Tony, because obviously, he did. Very much.  Just…he wasn’t sure how prepared he was to handle Tony’s, uh, pace.  It had taken him this long to manage to tell Tony that he…found him, um.  Attractive.
, Steve said, looking away from Tony.  What things, Tony had asked, idly tracing a circle around one of Steve’s nipples and thinking about quarks and strings, the kind that vibrated and told stories of the universe.
Steve looked at him for a long moment before putting his forkful of pancakes down.  “You’re just going to buy all the seats on the plane, aren’t you?” Steve questioned resignedly.  All the seats on the plane, of course.  That made so much more sense than buying the airline.  Steve was so frugal.
Tony bit out a curse and let out a long, low moan of pure pleasure as he slowly thrust his finger into Steve’s hole.  “God, that’s--you’re so--Christ, Steve,” Tony stammered, for the first time seemingly almost as overwhelmed as Steve felt.
“No, I didn’t,” Tony agreed with a contented hum.  He was quiet for a little bit, thinking back over the bits and pieces of the night that kept filtering through his mind like an out of sync Viewmaster, where he could just see parts of the image and then a blank, white space. “I was thinking about you,” Tony began with a slight frown, “and then you came to get me.  That was nice.  Wait. Did I text you?”
Except...there was a box, with a circuit he'd built and the matchbook from the by-the-hour hotel they'd stayed in, and Steve's half of their honeymoon photos, and his ring was still sitting there in the box that somehow belonged to Tony.
When he’s rather unceromoniously dumped on a pile of furs, he half expects the man to just get it over with right then, but he doesn’t. He takes his time.  Goes slowly, seemingly in no hurry.  Tony almost wishes he would hurry.  Frowns when he sees the bruises on Tony’s arms and back and traces them with his thumb in little circles.  Tony keeps trying to hide his face and bite his lip, but the man won’t let him do that.  It’s not unpleasant, even when it hurts a bit at first, though Tony thinks it might be easier if it was.  He thinks the man seems frustrated with him, and worries he’s displeased him.  Maybe the warlord will change his mind, and all of this will be for nothing.  Obie will probably have him beaten.  He’s not worth much now, and whatever deals Obie had been hoping to broker involving him that spared his life when Obie took over in the wake of his parents’ murder were probably fruitless after this.  Who wanted some foreigner’s leavings?
“Right,” Steve responded agreeably, drawing out the word.  “At least let me get you a blanket, if you want to stay.”
Steve let go of the tags and brought his hand up and cupped Tony’s chin, tilting his face upwards, his thumb rubbing lightly over Tony’s bottom lip.
“Here,” the man said, extending a hand to help Steve up.  Steve hesitated a moment, then reached out and took the man’s hand. His grip was like steel and he pulled Steve up like he weighed nothing, though Bucky often said he had wet shirts that weighed a stone more than Steve.  The man’s skin was cold enough to make Steve’s eyes widen in surprise, though it was a chilly night and the man wasn’t wearing a cloak or gloves or anything like what you might expect of a traveller.
They came to a landing at the top of the stairs, and Stark swiped his card over the security panel next to a door, which opened onto the roof when he pushed it.  The view was spectacular, Steve had to admit.
“Why do you want to change that memory?  Because it was the last?” Steve asked.  The cloth slowed, briefly, then kept up its pattern of overlapping circles across his back.
The truth was, he and Pep been fraying almost as soon as they started.  In so many ways, Pepper was his opposite, and that was supposed to complement him, let them bring out the best in each other, but he was fairly sure, looking back, that it made him try to be someone that he wasn’t. Someone who remembered birthdays and allergies and didn’t build weaponized armored suits as a coping mechanism.  At least, that was one part of it.  Probably good aspirational goals, truth be told, but the problem was, he thought as he shimmied out of his tuxedo pants and padded to the bed…the problem was that she also needed him to not be the guy who flew missiles into wormholes in space or rang the  dinner bell for terrorists to come and get him.
Above him, the not-gel glowed and...he wanted to say breathed or pulsed, maybe, but that wasn’t quite right, either. But it had a look of something that had movement to it.  Some kind of--of nanotech, maybe? But far more advanced than even he had managed thus far. Which wasn’t exactly comforting, all things considered, he thought with a pained grimace.  But, the idea that it might be some version of nanotech was surprisingly comforting. Machines, technology...
“The giant with the hammer is patronizing me,” Captain Rhodes observed mildly, tightening his grip on the reins again with a sigh.
I once held a shield and said this is worth dying for, Steve reminded himself.  And yet, here I sit, he thought, feeling the weight of the inaction sink into his bones.
Not that Steve hadn’t been passionate.  They’d never seemed to quite make it out of the can’t-keep-their-hands-off-each-other stage, and Steve, Mr. GNC—eat your Wheaties—I Want to Pump //clap// You Up, was entertainingly strong.  That came in handy at times, and not just in a ‘he can open literally any jar’ kind of way, Tony thought to himself.  Though, the jar thing had been cool, too.  Anyway, point being, Steve had always been stupidly into Tony, though adorably inexperienced at first.  He’d just--maybe because of his size or whatever, Tony wasn’t sure—but, Steve had always been…oddly tender, Tony remembered.  Even when he was pushing Tony up against the wall like he weighed nothing.  He’d been careful, Tony could tell.  Caring. Like the last thing in the world he ever wanted to do was hurt Tony in some way.  It felt silly to think of it—the sex--like that, even now, except Tony was absolutely certain he was right about it.  Maybe it was something only apparent to Tony, he wondered, because he knew well enough what the opposite felt like.
” Tony squeaked out, his voice going high in disbelief.  “So that’s why he always beats me at darts.  What a dick.”
It was perfect. In here, he could be perfect. He could take care of the stranger, given him what he wanted, and everything would be fine. No one would get hurt. He wouldn’t let that happen, not in here.
“I can do that.  Build it.  Grow it.  Whatever you want,” Tony told him.  “I can do that.  I’ve got—well, ideas.  For what I’d do.  Not that I ever thought I would, of course.  Just…sometimes.  Sometimes, I thought about it.”
“I have this idea,” Steve responded, slowly, carefully, like he was still thinking about what he wanted to say.  “I can’t get it out of my head.”
“No, no, he’s got to understand, Maria,” Howard said, cutting her off with a slash of his hand through the air, then tossing it high in frustration before letting it slap back to his side with a loud clap.  On the screen, Tony flinched, and Steve felt his chest constrict around the word no that exploded over and over in his mind and beat a pulse through his veins.  “It’s the same damned thing, over and over and over.  He never listens. Ever.  And you coddle him. You and Jarvis.  This kind of thing, it’s cute at four, fine, but how about when he’s ten?  Fifteen?  He’s got to learn some damn discipline, Maria, I keep telling you!”
“I am given to understand that you expressed an interest in MIT during dinner the other night,” Jarvis said.
Getting the batteries turned out to be the tough part.  They didn’t make the particular models anymore, so he’d had to improvise a new contact board to fit against the tops of the updated batteries.   The rest, he’d cobbled together from the bits and pieces of various radios he’d gotten from the Army-Navy depot and then cannibalized.
“They were just standing there!” Tony protested loudly, pushing himself off the wall where he had been leaning. “And I wasn’t going to just leave him when he can’t so much as raise a pinky to defend himself.  Oh, whatever,” Tony continued, waving a hand in the air at her dubious look.  “Look, point is,” he began, then quieted at the sharp glares from passing hospital personnel.  “Point is, they don’t know what they’re dealing with here—
Steve turned and stepped back, then arched his fist back and slammed it into the bank of lockers.  It went flying out of its bolts and into the stand of lockers behind it, knocking those over, too.
“No!  No, I am fine,” Steve assured him quickly.  “I am, Tony. It—it was just a momentary malaise. It has passed.  I think, I should eat, perhaps. That is all.”
For a moment, Steve was back in the hull of the raiders’ ship, cold and naked and chained like an animal, and even here, he felt a shiver run down his spine. “I didn’t really get to look at it very much,” he told Cam instead.
“Yeah, yeah, really, I’m telling you.  Like when I see something I want, I just go for it, you know?  Don’t hesitate, I say.  You want it, you make it happen, right?  Speaking of…how about we just step right in here,” he finished, pushing open the glass door to a conference room where a large, rectangular table sat with a flatscreen on the wall above with a small mini bar towards the back of the room.  “Can I, uh, get you all anything?  We’ve got, let’s see, soft drinks, water…some coffee…” Estes offered with a slight frown.
“What are you doing, Tony?” Steve finally asked when Tony sat down in one of the wobbly, wooden chairs next to Steve at the back of the room, farthest from the professor.
The creature hummed, pursed its lips and blew a huff of air out of its gills.  It didn’t seem all that impressed, though Steve wasn’t quite sure how to explain someone like Peggy to someone like Shellhead.
Steve sighed deeply and straightened his spine, almost unconsciously falling into something near enough to parade rest to have the comfort of familiarity. “No, it’s me. It’s nothing. I’m just—sorry. This is…this is all very strange,” Steve admitted. “I’m—I’m trying. When we’re out there, I’ll be fine. I promise.”
He was always seen.  Everyone always watched him, looked to him, took his measure.  He was always on display, even here. Maybe especially here. His every move, his every word, examined and scrutinized.  Back home, everyone looked up to him. Put him on some pedestal. And here, now, Tony was treating him like he wasn’t worth Tony’s time or attention.  It made him feel awful and wonderful, this forced anonymity. Like he could disappear into the wall. It made him feel small. Like he wasn’t even there. Or, barely there.  A shadow. A ghost. A part of the room, quiet and occupied, and not worth Tony’s notice. His cock pulsed, copious amounts of precum leaking down the hard shaft where it jutted out between his thighs.
Tony cast a look over his shoulder and down the hall towards Steve's darkened room with a pang of what was probably misplaced guilt, but that knowledge didn't lessen it. He'd let his Alpha go to bed hungry, no matter what crap Steve tried to spew, and that was, well, bad manners was probably the least of what that was. Tony sighed and let his head dip to his chest, his free hand coming up to massage his temples. Fuck. He could be a real ass sometimes. He told himself he'd make Steve a thanks-for-not-being-a-dick breakfast in the morning, and figured cereal would be non-phallic enough to fit that particular bill.
“Steve.  I actually am capable of being a decent human being to your recovering-veteran-best-friend-from-childhood, okay? Cross my black heart,” Tony promised, making a small x on his chest.
taking his time, like it was a--a gift to have the chance to make Steve feel that way, even if they both knew it wasn’t.  Tony cared about making Steve feel good, he cared about Steve, he
.   Then the fire down at Sonny’s?  That nearly lit up the whole building, and there are apartments up there.  Families.”
Tony let out a long, waffling sigh and threw on something from the nearest stack of clean clothes, which turned out to be blue boxers, jeans and a grey t-shirt that hung loosely on him the way a t-shirt was supposed to, which must mean it was one of Steve’s that had gotten mixed in with his laundry.  He smoothed his hands over the front of it, then lifted the collar and breathed in. It smelled like detergent, of course, and not…freedom, or whatever the hell he’d been half-expecting.
He could feel the alien’s thrusts speeding up, losing some of their rhythm as they did, going a bit sloppy.  He wasn’t sweating, Tony noticed, but the alien looked like he
, some dude came by the club wanting to see the tapes, and maybe there was some money changing hands there,” Bucky said.
“Figured that much. What with you not generally getting married on a whim. Though, if you gotta, go for broke, I guess,” Barnes said, looking over at Tony.
“Twice his age and three times his size.  He said it was her sauce, but the way he said it, she’d blush and laugh and swat him with her apron,” Steve recalled, keeping up the rhythm with his fingers, spreading them wide, then spearing them together, wide again, until they weren’t enough, and Tony wanted more.  “Delya,” he said again.  Music, Tony thought. “Delya Fiocca.”
People don’t belong here, Steve thought to himself as his eye caught on a stacking of three rocks into a pyramid shape caught his eye, and he saw a few of the guards take note of it, too, making some kind of warding gesture as they passed.
“Just supposed to be hard enough to make you have to think about it,” Steve said, moving back a little to give Tony space he hadn’t quite realized Steve had been taking up until just then, when some great whooshing sound seemed to fill the void as the buzz of noise in the restaurant switched on like someone had unmuted it.  He didn’t let go of Tony’s hand though, keeping his own wrapped around it, and Tony felt himself squeeze again on fifty-six out of reflex more than necessity.  “Probably should try differential equations for you, I suppose.  Next time,” Steve promised, eyes strangely soft.  “Here,” Steve said, nudging just enough to get Tony into motion.
Tony’s phone buzzed in his pocket.  He pulled it out and looked at the screen, where the photo of a canister of salt appeared.
“Should you need anything else, you have only to ask.  We are at your disposal,” the chef added with another deferential nod before Stark waved them off and the trio dispersed.
“I see you’re making yourself at home,” Tony observed, nodding at Barnes, who tipped the neck of his beer bottle in Tony’s direction.  “I’ve got a bit of an errand to run before dinner,” he told Steve, who nodded somewhat distractedly.
“Is. There.  A. Mission?” Steve asked again, punctuating each word carefully, but with enough force that it cut Coulson off.
A cold rush of air hit him without warning, and suddenly, the panties were jerked down to his thighs.  He felt Steve’s finger slide in easily.  Then another.  And—oh, fuck—Steve still had his gloves on.  Tony could feel the smooth burn of the leather as Steve pushed his fingers all the way in.   Tony let out a grunt, then moaned as Steve pulled his fingers out.  He was empty and open and dripping.  Like the Omegas in the pictures, Tony thought, feeling somehow lifted up by the idea.  Pleased. Floating.  For you, Tony thought.  Only for you.
His stomach felt queasy.  It wasn’t that he was ashamed of what he did at the club.  It was about as honest a job as you could get, when it came down to it, but that didn’t mean he wanted videos of it floating around on the Internet for eternity.  God. Everyone from the Army was going to see it. Everyone from back home was going to see it. Humiliation burned at Steve’s cheeks, snaking down his spine and settling low in his gut with a sour, swirling tightness.
“Thanks, Tony.  Night,” Steve said as he closed to the door, leaving Tony standing in the hallway staring dumbly at the door.
to believe him, I guess.  He begged me, you see.  Not to say anything…he—he’s going away.  That school. In just a couple of months.  He—Oh, God, Peggy, Ana is so sick.  I can’t…the radiation treatments alone are thousands of dollars, I—I didn’t know what to do—I--”
“To be honest, she probably understood a lot more than I gave her credit for at the time,” Steve told him, mouth twisting wryly on the words.  Peggy had been too polite and too damn sympathetic to come out and say it, but it had been humiliating and horrifying without her spelling it out.  He’d wanted to argue, but what was there to say, really? ‘I’m not like that’ and ‘I can be happy with you’ seemed to somehow melt into ‘How did you know?’ in his head, so he hadn’t said anything.
somehow.  He felt it, the way they looked without seeing, the way they took something without asking.  It felt like they were saying something he didn’t want to hear, but wasn’t able to avoid.  Just had to grit his teeth and take it.
Anto clutched the bone to his chest, then dropped to his knees so he could properly express his gratitude.
“You clean up pretty nice,” Steve observed agreeably, then smiled and did that blushing, bright-eyed thing that Tony was kind of starting to adore.  “Can’t believe I’m on a date with Tony Stark.”
Tony’s eyes narrowed at the screen, then he smiled softly, mouth twisting a bit.  He sucked in a breath, his insides going warm and liquid. He liked this Steve, who danced on rooftops and made bisexual spelling jokes and took Tony out to long-distance dinners.
Steve had seen a lot, but not many men who looked more completely gutted than Tony’s butler in that moment.
“Just be yourself around them. That’s it.  It isn’t rocket science.  Though, I guess that’d be pretty easy for you, huh?” Steve finished with a rueful smile.
Cam laughed and clapped his hands together before he remembered he was worried about falling off and clamped his hands back around the edges of the saddle. The rest of the morning largely passed surprisingly quickly, with Steve regaling Cam with stories about what he and Bucky used to get up to, most of it harmless, but some, in retrospect, making him wonder that perhaps their mothers had been right about the number of gray hairs on their heads that appeared due to the two of them.
“Beautiful,” Tony murmured, glancing down at Steve.  He moved away then, to the side of the bed, and Steve heard the rustling clank of metal again.  His heart skipped a beat, then thudded at his ribs, counting off against each sound as Tony pulled the chain from the base of the bed and wrapped it around Steve’s thighs, one, then the other, tightening it until Steve’s ass was pulled apart far enough that he felt a rush of cold air tingle across his hole.  His cock juddered and spurted.  Tony glanced at it, seemingly uninterested, then hummed again, low under his breath, and lifted Steve’s right leg up, affixing a smaller chain from the base of the bed around Steve’s knee to the headboard.  The other leg got the same treatment, until he was chained and spread wide, pulled apart and exposed for Tony to see.  To use.  Steve swallowed.
“Sorry, sorry, whoa there, Cap,” Rumlow said quickly, holding his hands out in front of him and taking a step back.  “Didn’t mean to get too personal or something. Geez.  You’re going to—ah—you’re kind of pulling the plane apart, there, Cap,” he warned, nodding down at where Steve’s hand had wrapped around the metal seat and was peeling it from its base with a whining, popping noise that was drawing looks from the other strike team members. “Maybe you want to not do that, huh?  Didn’t mean to strike a nerve.  Just making conversation.”
“Best. Day Ever,” Tony and Rhodey said together, then started laughing, doubling over and wheezing with it before they were done.  Relief, Tony knew, all the panic spiraling into giddiness and hysteria.
“Get out,” the King cut in, holding a hand up in the air in front of Zola’s face. Zola snapped his mouth shut and bowed.
Steve climbed into bed, staring at the ceiling, willing himself to sleep.  Army training usually meant he could fall asleep practically on command, but not tonight.  His mind drifted back to the sketches.  Tony with his eyes ablaze, head titled slightly upward in challenge, mouth forming a hint of a smile, but a smile with promise behind it. With steel behind it.  He was never going to get to sleep like this, too wound up, emotions still bubbling and swirling too close to the surface.  Steve’s head was too full of
“I’d pay good money to see it go down, though, not gonna lie,” Bucky sighed forlornly as he leaned against the outside of a bus stop shelter.
“Welcome to the team, Captain,” Bruce said with a crooked smile. “All I got was a coffee mug when I joined.  Congratulations, by the way.  Both of you.”
“Yes,” Tony replied with an air of sadness.  “All nice and toasty warm.  But, let’s put that aside for now. Real excited to try out this bus pass thing,” Tony said, pulling the bright yellow card out of the breast pocket of his coat.
Tony’s thrusts stuttered, going jerky, and irregular.  He let out a sharp cry, and Steve felt a warm wetness fill him.  Tony’s hips pumped a few more times as he spent himself.  He collapsed on top of Steve’s chest, breathing heavily, a ring of sweat across his brow.  He stayed like that until Steve felt his breathing slow and heart stop pounding a rabbit-like beat into Steve’s chest.  Steve could feel Tony soften inside him, but had no desire to hasten his leaving.  There was something strangely comforting about this, with Tony as undone as he was.  He wrapped his arm around Tony’s back and rubbed a line up and down Tony’s spine.  He felt, as much as heard, Tony give a low laugh that sounded almost like a hum.
“Yeah, it’s the first one. Or the fourth, depending.  Can’t believe you haven’t seen Star Wars,” Tony said.
“We have had something of a situation arise. Rather unexpectedly, to say the least.  And now…we’re in a bit of a conundrum, quite frankly,” Fury admitted, somewhat reluctantly to Tony’s ear.
“I...guess?” Steve replied somewhat dubiously, frowning with confusion, which earned a hearty laugh from the driver.
that time Happy looked at Pepper as he helped her out of the car when she had her hands full, how he had been happy for them, sure, but a part of him in that one, brief moment coveted that. Jarvis, the real Jarvis, placing a cool cloth on his forehead when he had the flu when he was nine.  A sci-fi movie he’d watched on late night TV while he built DUM-E, one of those really bad ones the guy and his robots used to mock, featuring a woman hooked up to some kind of machine with what Tony, the guy on the TV
Steve nodded, holding Tony’s gaze as steadily as he could. His throat bobbed as he worked at swallowing. He concentrated on breathing. It felt as if he might forget if he didn’t. Tony’s dark eyes moved over him. Steve couldn’t find any anger there, not now, at least. Just the familiar steely-hard certainty that enveloped Tony whenever he needed to punish Steve, and a deep, abiding hunger that lurked underneath it all.
“Like I said, he probably just lost track of time,” Steve said, glancing away for a moment. “I think he’s excited to meet you,” Steve told him with a small frown. For some reason, the idea of Brock meeting Stark felt wrong somehow.  It was like that feeling he got sometimes right before a seemingly-by-the-book mission went all to shit.  It was ridiculous, but, if he had been able to figure out how to extricate himself from all of this short of jumping off the balcony, he would have done it. As it was, there wasn’t much he could do, since nothing he said would dissuade Brock from coming down to meet Tony Stark, he knew that much.
“I know. I know! Don't give me that look, Rhode-warrior, come on. Rough morning. Steve brought the papers by. Went fine, but I needed some quiet time to work on...” Tony trailed off, turning to blink at the screen, which he hadn't been paying much attention to over the last few hours, too lost in thought to worry about...oh, right, power couplings.
“God, Tony, you’re so good for me.  Look at you.  Gorgeous,” Steve husked out, a raspy, scraping voice laced with pleasure as he slowly thrust his thumb in and out of Tony’s mouth.
“Well, now, that’s really your call, I guess,” Brock replied, his voice careful, “but come on, we’ve been over this. It’ll be fine. Like you said, it’s one night, and Stark...
“He what?” Steve said, too sharply.  He gulped in a breath, chilling his chest until it burned.  Breathe, he told himself, but the air was stagnant and heavy around him all of a sudden.  Of course, Tony would marry, and soon, most likely. Were they not just speaking of heirs?  It would happen. Had to happen. Steve knew that, but this was--it was too real. Too close.  A spike of something foul and bitter twisted in Steve’s gut. Was this truly what it would feel like, this awful, sinking pit of despair, when it finally happened?  I should be better than this, Steve thought to himself, but it held no weight. All he could think about was Tony with someone else. Someone else making him laugh, someone else talking through the night with him, someone else sharing his joys, his sorrows, all of that someone else’s to behold.  It was the worst kind of selfishness, Steve supposed, but he couldn’t help it. He was leaving, and Tony would move on--be happy with someone else--and that thought should make the leaving easier, but it didn’t.
“Yeah, well, what was I going to say?  It took fucking forever for you to do anything more than lay there like a lump and now,
“I completely understand,” Steve replied without dropping his gaze from where it was locked on Howard, who had to top off his drink to give himself an excuse to lower his eyes.  There as a sharp edge to his voice.  A warning, Tony thought.  He knew about those warnings, too. This one wasn’t directed at him, but he could still hear it.
“Ask me why,” she ordered, taking a crinkled French fry out of the paper bag she was holding in her lap and biting off the end.
“Yes, Your Highness?” the older one, Peran, Steve remembered, asked, stepping out of the alcove and snapping to a smart stance.
He missed JARVIS. He missed Rhodey and Pepper.  It was dark out here. Dark and lonely and empty.  Dying was one thing. And he knew he was dying, though the thought was distant somehow, like a memory, almost. Being alone was one thing. But, dying alone?  He blew out a huff of air that left his chest straining and opened his eyes. He didn’t want to die alone. Fate seemed to have other plans than to give him what he wanted, though.  Didn’t she always?
Steve’s eyes snapped open, his body coming instantly awake, every nerve tingling in alert as he sat up in their bed. It was the middle of the night, and Tony was gone, which was enough of an unusual situation to make his heart skip a beat, but really, it was the ten—no, he corrected, twelve—armored suits that ringed the bed that raised the true concern.
Tony ground to a halt in surprise, staring at the man sitting opposite him across the twin of the table that had just been in front of him in the other room. Two investigators in ill-fitting suits too hot for the Vegas weather turned in their chairs and looked back at him. “Get him out of here! Dammit, Walsh, can’t you keep one eye on the door and the other one worrying about what Connie’s doing with Spinelli?” Bad Tan Suit called out to whoever it was over Tony’s shoulder. “Mr. Stark, I’ll have to insist you wait in the interrogation room with your lawyer while we discuss matters with the witness.”
There were a few, tinkering laughs, but Steve knew the question had hit a nerve, especially with the whole issue with the Board being on Tony’s mind.
“Wave to the nice people in the pod below us,” Tony said, though he didn’t wave.  Steve leaned his head against the glass bubble and looked down, where, sure enough, a group of people were exuberantly at them, clearly thrilled when Steve acknowledged them with a small wave back.  The pod was at the ten o’clock position on the wheel now, floating inexorably to the top, slowing occasionally as pods loaded and unloaded.
“Right, right, anyway, Steve and his boys show up, you know, and not a couple a’days later, the Germans flood the whole damn thing. Last ditch effort, but it was all over.  Finally. God, what were the casualties on that one?” Howard asked, glancing around the room.
“Hey, Army here,” Steve replied, feeling strangely buoyed by her concern, however misplaced it might be. “I can take care of myself, you know that, right?”
To be fair, Bucky would probably have told him that it might have been a little bit about him. He sighed and let his eyes close for a moment, just as the elevator dinged its arrival.  Steve stepped in and pushed the floor for the lobby level, then held the door expectantly for Coulson, who shook his head.
“Just go.  Enjoy.  Whatever,” Tony interjected with a wave of his hand.  Steve recognized a dismissal when he heard one.
“Palladium,” Tony rasped.  “It’s a type of poison. Bad.  Very bad.” Tony had no idea why he was babbling.  He couldn't seem to help himself.  Some kind of impulse to explain to the alien, to calm him, to soothe him, Tony didn't know. That didn't seem quite right, but...he couldn't seem to deny it, either.  The alien was watching him carefully, brows drawn together again.  “It’s killing me,” Tony said. The alien hummed again and made that same noise as before. No, not the same, just similar, but this was...more distressed. Something about the high-pitchness of it gave off that vibe, Tony thought.
“Let’s pretend I’m not kidding.  I mean, you know who I am.” Stark shrugged lightly, mouth pursing.  “What would you say?”
“Right behind you,” Natasha said, scooting her chair back and grabbing her plate as she followed Clint out of the room, but not before giving Tony a quick nod and smile on her way out. Steve was still eating with quiet efficiency, eyes focused on his plate, shoulders hunched inward as if he could somehow make himself less noticeable that way.
Steve had sent the boy away on some errand he couldn’t even remember the moment Zola and two of his overseers arrived with the man in tow.  He didn’t like thinking about it.  The glassy-eyed, expressionless look on the man’s face told him more than enough.  Steve had protested, of course, though it fell on deaf ears.  Steve was not to be touched, but Zola could punish and threaten in ways that were far less straightforward than Steve ever imagined.
“Huh. Well, let’s see what the good doctor has to say,” Tony muttered, opening the attachment. Thermonuclear astrophysics? Bit hefty for late night reading, but at least somewhat interesting, he mused. He managed to make it as far as quantum tunneling effect before switching off the tablet, blinking as his eyes tried to adjust to the sudden darkness. He reached up and jerked off his bowtie, undoing the buttons of his dress shirt and untucking it from his waist before pushing himself up and shrugging it off, letting it fall to the floor. He toed off his shoes, then kicked off his pants, padding to the bed in his boxers and socks.
“Guess I didn't do such a good job at loving you, after all,” Steve whispered, warm breath curling into Tony's hair just above his ear. “You thinking that. No wonder you were upset. Reckon I can't much blame you for that.”
He heard Tony grunt an acquiescence as he undid the ties and clasps and tugged it over Tony’s head.  Tony stood and allowed him to undo the front of his breeches and pull them down over his hips, followed by the hose and undergarments Tony apparently only deigned to wear for special occasions.  Steve felt a small sigh against his neck and dropped his eyes down to Tony’s, catching a glimpse of something dark and unreadable in Tony’s expression.  The small point at the base of Tony’s neck was jumping as the blood pounded against the skin.  Steve leaned down to mouth at it, sucking lightly and running his tongue over the sweat-salted skin and felt Tony give a stuttering gasp, arms weaving under Steve’s to roam his back.  Tony’s cock was pressing hard against Steve’s thigh.  His own was jutting into Tony’s stomach with a pleasurable aching stiffness.
And now—fuck. Now, Tony’s car is at the bottom of a cliff because…because he said he wanted the damn thing there.  No. No, that’s not—fuck.  That’s not what happened.  None of this made sense.  It was all too jumbled in his head to parse out, like someone had upended the Scrabble tiles and all that were right-side up were the Zs and Xes.  He couldn’t do anything with what his brain had to work with.
Steve wasn’t sure what he was expected, Tony’s fingers or his cock, but his whole body seized in startled pleasure as the warm softness of Tony’s tongue flicked out to lick at the rim of his hole, just tracing the curve around the red, puckered flesh at first. Steve’s cock jumped and started to thicken as it filled with blood in response, and he moaned into the pillow under his head. He felt the heat of Tony’s tongue leave him for a moment, the cool air feeling good against his wet, heated rim, and then Tony’s tongue was back, licking a stripe up the crack of his ass, lapping up the slick where it dripped from his hole. Steve let out a choked sob, his body shuddering as his mind filled with the image of Tony’s mouth buried between the spread cheeks of his ass.
“Oh, right.  MIT.  Wow, that’s something, isn’t it?”  Wilson replied, looking along the line of tension that seemed to radiate between the other four people in the room.  “Small world and all that, I guess.”
“Zola has no idea what I would like,” the King said through his teeth, jaw clenched tightly around the words.  “And you…you are absolutely nothing like Tiberius, thank God,” he breathed out, eyes going half-hooded as he looked down at Steve.  “Enough of that.  I’ve listened to old men drone on for hours with a stack of papers in my lap, trying not to embarrass myself.  Let me see you,” the King ordered abruptly, nudging at Steve’s knee with his hand.
“Yeah, you,” Steve replied, voice going soft.  He reached out and traced his fingertip down Tony’s cheek.  “You’re everything to me, you know that.  Keeping you safe, it’s—I have to do it, Tony.  And all those people out there, each of them, they’re someone’s you.  I couldn’t just keep turning a blind eye, waiting for someone else to fix it.  I never wanted you to be caught up in it, though.  I kept telling myself, with all the stories out there, they’d leave you alone. No one would dare. I was—it was selfish.  I’m sorry. I should have told you a long time ago.”
“I know,” Tony said, casting his glance around before settling back on Steve, and strangely, Steve thought he probably did. “How fare you after last night?” Tony asked.
“Almost,” one of the overseer said.  “Up,” he ordered, motioning to Steve.  He got to his feet, flanked by two guards, and looked down at Zola with what he hoped was disdain. Zola smiled up at him.
“Not now.  I get it,” Tony said quickly, slashing a hand through the air. “You’re not ready, you’re scared of going through what we did before, only worse this time because you know you’ll hate yourself for falling for it again, and that’s—I get it.  Don’t like it, but, believe it or not, I get it,” Tony said, scrunching up his face at the words.  He leaned back against the wall next to Steve’s neighbor’s apartment where the paint was peeling to a tacky tan material underneath.  “And, I’m a very patient man.”
they were.  Different. Wrong somehow.   Though he hadn’t been able to bring himself to do anything to make them stop, had he?  And here he was, yet again, with his own spend all over him like a boy instead of a man grown.
“There was...ah, in with the papers, there was an agreement. Pre-nup kind of a thing,” Tony trailed off, hoping Steve would pick up the thread.
“Oh.  Okay.  Well.  Lord Stane, he’s—he was Lord Protector while the King was young, after the old King and Queen died, so…so, probably, the King is a lot like Lord Stane, since Lord Stane kind of raised him, don’t you think?” Cam asked, sitting up on his elbows on the pallet.  Steve tossed him a chunk of the hard bread, which the boy caught against his stomach.  “So, he’s probably nice, huh?”
“Glaring at the board!” Cam said, twisting around to yell over his shoulder.  Steve heard a muffled huff of laughter from the workshop, then moved his Knight to try to support from the fringes.
“Whatever it is he wants to talk to me about, it’ll be fine.  Communication is good, right?” Tony asked.  His eyes caught on the Someone Is Wrong About Science Hotline, and he felt a fond, watery smile form against his better judgment.  “Foundation of a relationship and all that.  So, whatever the big reveal is, I mean, we’ll deal with it.  That’s all I’m saying.  Not like it is going to be something that stops…things…from happening,” Tony continued, reaching out to pluck a finger over the string that was tied to the tin can.
“As she was leaving, her mother noticed a bag of items she was carrying out the door.  Various things you’d given her, apparently, from around the house.  A box with a shell on it from the downstairs hall table.  A feather from one of your mother’s hats.  Your favorite little robot.  The one that looked like a beetle.  You put stickers on him. Gold stars.  I don’t remember what all else was in there,” Jarvis said.
The pond itself was still the same deep, dark green, coated with bright patches of algae and water plants floating on the top, giving the dragonflies places to land and they darted across, looking for mosquitoes. The small dock protruded out into the center.  A few of the boards were a far lighter wood, replacing the ones that had started to crack with age.  Tony knew which ones would creak when he stepped on them,  bringing all the Dinners, Ones and Days bobbing to the surface in quick, circling darts as they hunted for the food they had come to expect.
“Celestial navigation, huh?” Steve said, walking over to stand in front of the telescope.  He ran a hand along the smooth tube, then looked over the top at where Tony was fiddling with the viewer.
“Sounds delicious.  It was good.  Last time,” Tony said, though he honestly had no memory of what he’d eaten last time or how it had tasted.  Probably best to just sit here and very strenuously not think about Steve being mother-henned by a Chinese grandmother who thought he should eat more.
“I was getting patched up back in Cheltenham,” a somewhat muffled voice said and the camera shifted again, though steadied quickly.
“I’m not a danger to you.  I wouldn’t have done this if there was even a possibility of that,” Steve replied with a rushed sort of assurance that seemed to want to get all the words out and wipe the thought away at the same time.
The bath was impressive, Steve had to admit as he slid into the steaming water after the last of the attendants left with their now-empty cauldrons of water.   The walls of the room were covered in the same kind of mosaics as the main room, though these scenes, not surprisingly, featured bathers, water nymphs and other storied beasts in various stages of…well.  Frolic, Steve decided, casting a dubious look at one of the scenes that seemed to depict a rather improbable encounter between a man and a many-armed sea creature.  Cam had added some kind of spicy-scented oil to the water that stuck to Steve’s skin and left it soft and gleaming.  Steve leaned his head back against the edge of the tub and closed his eyes, letting his mind drift.
“Of course, Sir,” JARVIS replied.  The screen flickered and the image from Pepper’s phone popped up.  Tony lifted his head and chewed on his lip for a moment as he stared at the screen.  Well.  It wasn’t like he wasn’t going to admit to having a
“Fuck, that’s gorgeous,” Tony burst out in a strangled voice as he looked down between them.  “God, Steve,” Tony moaned, low and gravelly as he thrust.  He came with a harsh, broken shout, back bowing, muscles going taut, warm streams that covered Steve’s chest and neck.  A fleck hit Steve’s bottom lip and he startled, then flicked his tongue out to taste, keeping his eyes on Tony as he lapped it into his mouth.
job to help his friend, I’ve suddenly gone off the rails?  I think it says a lot more about other people’s hang-ups than it says about my mental state, but thanks so much for asking.”
at loving him. I could come back to him, the way Fury and Coulson want, the way SHIELD wants, I could come back to him when I’m...when I’m away.  A way back.  A way out.  A way forward.  A way.
“M’good,” Tony slurred, letting his arms droop lazily from Steve’s shoulders. “I am,” Tony reiterated at Steve’s frown. “My chest,” he offered by way of explanation. “Bruce said it could happen. Oh, don’t get that face, gods. You didn’t do anything wrong. At all, Steve. Trust me. Sometimes, it’s nice. Not to worry about it, I mean. Just let you,” Tony broke off, looking towards the dark windows where the translucent panes splintered with firelight. “I like to just be yours sometimes,” he finished as he looked back at Steve, eyes warm and soft. Tony leaned up, placing a light, fluttering kiss against Steve’s lips, then nipping the bottom one playfully.
“Fu—fu—fuck, fuck, god, fuck—Steve,” Tony chanted, hips spasming against the glass.  Tony groaned at the sensation as the tip of his cock ran across the cool, smooth surface, unable to find the friction he was looking for.
“It’s a, what do you call it?  Walking man thing,” Stane said, snapping his fingers and pointing down at Tony.  “Plays music.”
“Ninja turtles and a futon?  You definitely aren’t getting laid,” Kirk replied flatly.  “More’s the pity.”
Steve didn't respond, but he did, after a pause when Tony thought for sure he was going to be left with the options of turning and leaving or throwing the damn quilt at Steve and making a run for it, reach out and take it, unfolding it enough to wrap it around his shoulders.
“Both on the giving and receiving end of things, yes,” Tony told him.  “What? I’d never do something with you that I haven’t tried myself,” Tony said at Steve’s surprised expression.  “I used to rather enjoy that, at least when I was younger. It was good to just...be able to let go. Let someone else handle things. This could be...sometimes a release of all that pressure, let’s say.”
“You’re something else, Tony,” Steve said, shaking his head back and forth.  “Alright.  Call Happy.”
“You’re right.  All this hanging out with a handsome billionaire, living in a penthouse, eating at five-star restaurants and spending more on a suit than I make in a month is really taking a toll,” Steve deadpanned in reply, earning a surprised bark of laughter from Tony.  “Guess I can manage to muddle through a few more days,” he sighed dramatically, then grinned and bit his lip with a slightly sheepish look that made Tony’s stomach do some kind of leap.
Tony looked up at him, then grinned, his shoulders shaking with laughter.  “You have no idea what you’re doing, do you?”
“Yeah,” Steve said after a moment of silence.  He glanced away, eyes catching on the broken pane of glass that still hung in one of the abandoned warehouse’s windows, letting a stream of light slip through the darkness.  “That’s probably something of an understatement,” Steve acknowledged with a  rueful half-smile.
Tony could see it so clearly, the two of them on the floor of what had been Steve’s crappy apartment at the time, before it became theirs for those few months when he’d believed everything was just beginning.  Hours spent furiously writing and re-writing code, while Steve taught the useless scrap-pile red versus orange over and over until the subroutine finally kicked in.
Obie finished pouring his drink, back still to Tony, though Tony saw him glance up in the mirror above the bar, before he turned around and walked over to sit in one of the overstuffed leather chairs opposite Tony.
Tony picked up the open end of the tin can and put his mouth to it.  “Should I tell him I love him?  Tap once for yes, twice for no,” Tony said, his voice deepened as he spoke into the tin can.  “You can use binary if that would help,” he offered into the silence.  God, he was a dork, he thought, letting the can go so it dangled by its string from the wall.
“Expendable is the word you mean,” Steve told him, dropping his arms from his chest and looking down at his feet where his toes curled into the thick carpet.  “I think we might be the rooster, too.”
“Don’t, Tony,” Natasha told him, gentler now, the pity that he’d heard earlier was back, and he looked down, almost surprised to see that he was standing next to where Steve lay on the medical table, one hand reaching for the bag she was pumping.  He pulled his hand back into his chest, recoiling from the scene in front of him, like if he didn’t touch it, it would be less real somehow.  It could still be taken back.  He could wake up.  Someone could shout, ‘Gotcha!’ and they could all laugh.  Anything. Anything, but this.
Steve clamped his mouth shut and pulled the flat pillow under his knees.  Having nothing else to do, he watched the King as he put the strange parchment down and started making large slash marks across it with a slim piece of charcoal, then picked up a quill and began making other, more careful marks.  Steve looked over at the wheel again, then back at the King.
“Shhhh. Shhhh, Tony, it’s okay.  You were so brave.  I’m so proud of you,” Steve whispered against the side of his temple, where the pulse was beating through his skin.  Tony gulped in a shuddering breath and squeezed his eyes shut.  “That should never have happened.  I should’ve been there sooner.  I’m so sorry, Tony. This was my fault. You didn’t come back to the ballroom, and I—I should’ve been there.  I should’ve come looking for you, but I wanted to give you space, even when I…I’m sorry,” he finished, shaking his head, eyes downcast, but holding Tony’s gaze.  “It wasn’t your fault.”
He couldn’t stomach much for supper.  His thoughts were in too much turmoil to eat.  If anyone knew about what was happening to him--what
Tony winced at the sharp click-thunk of a nail-gun sounding in rapid succession behind the carefully crafted position of nonchalance he’d adopted, leaning one shoulder against the doorframe, legs crossed at the ankles.  Between his architect, the Tower’s general contractor and the small army Pepper managed to pull together to put in an all-nighter on this week’s episode of Pimp My Shithole Apartment, he had a legitimate excuse for not sleeping that did not involve nerves, caffeine and pining after Steve, no matter what Rhodey said on the subject.
“I can’t even begin to picture you as you describe, but that last part sounds about right,” Tony smiled in return, then it faltered and fell from his face as his eyes gentled.  “This…Bucky.  You must miss him quite a bit.  Perhaps, in time, when you are more settled, you could, I don’t know, invite him here, if he wanted to come.  There will be enough ships making the journey soon, now that the war is over.  A companion.  You should have companions,” Tony said, snapping his fingers together to punctuate the idea. Steve’s heart thudded in his chest, part surprise, part a sort of slow horror that he couldn’t look away from, dawning bright and brutal in his mind at the idea of Bucky, or any of them, seeing him like this. What they would think of him.  “Most of the other concubines do, I’m given to understand. It would be good for you, I think,” Tony continued, unaware of the tumult his words worked on Steve’s mind.  “I am not unaware that you are…isolated, just you and the boy.  Not by design—or, it wasn’t
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony murmured, then his mouth was back on Steve’s as he maneuvered Steve until his back slammed into the wall just next to the door.  He let go of Steve’s cock long enough to shove the remainder of the robes off of Steve’s shoulders, then his hand was back, stroking Steve’s length through the cascade of golden chains.  He thumbed at the head, rolling one of the strands over the slit, making Steve’s hips judder in his hand. Steve’s head jerked back against the stone wall as he cried out, though Tony’s mouth was on his again in an instant, capturing most of his cry.
When Tony finally did get his feet to move, he hit the front door to the cabin at as near a run as he could manage while still technically calling it a brisk walk in the night air. It wasn't that he thought Steve was going to change his mind or suddenly let Tony in on the elaborate joke. It was that he was fairly sure if he stood there any longer, he'd ask Steve why, and that, folks, was not a conversation that needed to be had. Ever. The fine line between knowing the answers and getting the answers was where sanity lived.
“Okay, first, that’s adorable.  But, I really can’t go to sleep with the idea of plugging rockets in just floating out there in the universe,” Tony said as he tucked a pillow behind Steve’s head.  “Besides, I thought we settled on the Ergo carrier?  Should we have gone with the Bjorn?  Did it get better reviews?  Dammit, Jarvis, was there a recall?”  Tony demanded loudly, throwing his hands up in the air in frustration.  “Oh, right.  You had a different point. I see that now.”
“We’d best get out.  Before our skin wrinkles like old men,” Tony urged, though the words were soft, full of joy, as if the image pleased him.  Steve’s mind caught on Tony’s happiness and thrummed with it, like little fissures of warmth that crackled across his skin and made him feel as if he would break apart, were it not for Tony holding him together.
“Tony?  Tony, what’s wrong?  You…You’re obviously upset about something.  Maybe I can help?”  Steve stammered, thrown totally off guard by Tony’s outburst.  That, finally brought Tony’s gaze to his for a brief moment before he turned his head to the side, as if he couldn’t stand to look at Steve.  Steve was utterly baffled.  Had he done something?  Said something?  He’d only just gotten here tonight.
The King grinned, a smug, pleased look, then slowly drew his hands down to cup Steve’s balls and roll them around, massaging and hefting them.  He splayed his hands wide, then, on either side of Steve’s cock and leaned forward on his knees, taking the head into his mouth.  He looked up at Steve from under half-hooded eyes and moved his head, taking Steve’s length in deeper before drawing back in one long, slow slide of his lips before letting Steve’s cock pop out of his mouth, wet and glistening.
It had been a good night.  He wasn’t going to pretend otherwise.  He hadn’t known… well.  It didn’t matter.  It was over.  They
,” Tony began.  “I’m fine.  Really.  Head’s a little sore, but honestly, I had the new class bot on my lap and then dropped it getting out of the car.  You know, when Thing One over there shoved a phony gun in my face.  Always with the look of surprise.  I built weapons for years.  Do you really think I can’t spot a fake?” Tony asked, grimacing at the two of them.  “Anyway, I dropped the damn thing and tripped over it.  Banged my head on the side of the car.  But, it’s fine.  Really.  Just a bump.”
“The King barely attends Court these past weeks, and when he does, one must speak as if each word is as delicate as an eggshell,” Cam added.
be sweating.  Exertion was apparent on his tightly-drawn features. Tony let his body relax.  He enjoyed the feeling of just being taken,
“I can't believe this is happening. Is this happening? I don't even know what to think anymore. A few days ago, my life, everything was fine—don't give me that look, it was. It was. It almost mostly was. Now this--this—whatever this is with Steve?” Tony stammered. “Steve. God, Rhodey, what the hell am I going to do? If I was wrong, if this really was Howard--”
“Don’t.  Don’t do this to yourself.  This wasn’t your fault, Steve.  None of this.  I’ve done two dozen of these presentations with no problem.  This wasn’t—hey, look at me!” Tony snapped, drawing Steve’s eyes away from the black hole he was staring at in the distance.  “Not your fault.  I’m okay.  You said so yourself.”
“I know you,” Tony replied.  “Better than you would have me know you, I think.  Your feelings are often as easy to discern as if reading that book laying open over there.  You are many things, but easily fooled is not one of them.  You would never have done that—what Hammer had you do--had you not truly feared for the boy’s safety,” Tony said.
“Home with you, now,” the man instructed softly, then even gentler, "It will be alright.  I promise."
He swiped a hand over his mouth, rubbing at his chin where he had been trying to grow in something of a beard.  That had been toast right off the bat.  He’d balked when one of the aestheticians suggested shaving, well, everywhere, but his face was clean-shaven and plucked smooth.  His chest, legs and arms were denuded, just like he was supposed to be.   Someone had tried to tame his hair, which was slicked back flat on his head and fighting against the effort for all it was worth.  His mother had applied a line of coal under his eyes and a coat mascara to his lashes, which made him look like he was permanently surprised, as far as he could tell, but she kissed his cheek and told him Captain Rogers would love it, which worried him about the good Captain’s taste, among other things.
“You still with me, Cap?” Tony called from his workstation, expanding something in mid-air to allow him better access to the wiring inside.  Steve hadn’t realized Tony was paying him any mind.  He seemed utterly absorbed in whatever project he was currently working on.
…and Steve gave out a choked gasp as he stared down at the paths of white swirling down the drain, the spray making short work of any evidence of Steve’s exploits.
Tony pulled his mouth away, panting for air, a smile forming around a low, breathy laugh.  He hummed a happy sound, and spread his hands over Steve’s shoulders, adjusting his neck a bit as he regarded Steve in the low light.
Special thanks to tastes-like-coconut for the beta! All remaining mistakes are my own.  Thank you all for your patience.  At least it's long?  Hope you enjoy.
“Signal good,” Tony told him.  He dipped his head and nudged at Steve’s chest again, then stretched out his neck a bit and spread his legs. It wasn’t quite the invitation position he had learned, but he thought Steve understood. Steve’s body certainly seemed to get it, Tony noticed quickly.  “Tony want—want—want share…want good. With Steve. Steve show.”
Steve frowned at the sudden harshness of the words that seemed to shock only Steve and Peggy, at least, by the way her eyes narrowed on Howard.  He knew, of course, that Tony’s relationship with Howard had soured over the years, but there had been admiration there, at least, even if it hadn’t been the kind of relationship Steve would have hoped for them.  Now, as he watched the figures move around the small studio set up to look like an office, he wondered just how far that gulf between them really had been.
“Tony,” Jarvis cut in, giving Tony a long look before his face softened to something like regret.  “Tell me about him.”
“Please. Please, yes,” Steve chanted, letting his head fall forward onto Tony’s shoulder.  “Please Tony.  Please.” He looked down and watched as Tony deftly opened the lock and slowly removed the cage, finally freeing Steve’s cock.  Steve managed to suck in a quick, sharp breath before the sudden release of pressure hit him.  He cried out, body shaking, hips juddering into Tony’s hand, pleasure and pain rolling over in on themselves in his head until he couldn’t tell one from the other. There was just feeling.  Just feeling and Tony.
“Indeed, I did,” Tony said after a long moment. He fixed a level, narrow-eyed gaze on Steve.  “I’ve Court this evening, as you know.  We are overflowing with people wanting something before I leave, it seems.  And on top of that, Pepper has arranged a farewell party.   Says it would be rude not to entertain our guests who have traveled so far. Stay in our chambers tonight.  Too much drink and too many strangers to the Castle are not a good combination.”  He stood abruptly and brushed past Steve, stopping mid-stride at Steve’s shoulder and heaving a sigh.  Steve felt the weight of Tony’s hand descend to his shoulder, squeezing lightly, then settling there.  “You know I wish that…I wish that I could give you everything you want.  You just—God, you ask so much of me, Steve, and I can’t help but fail, every fucking time, and I—damn it!” Tony broke off, dropping his hand from Steve’s shoulder and raising it to rub at his forehead. “I told myself I would not have this debate with you again.”
“Holy shit!” Tony shouted at the same time as he groped at the towel around his waist and promptly slammed the door in Steve’s startled face. Well. His plan of pleasing his Alpha was off to a fabulous start.
“Good, you are finally awake,” Cam announced from his perch so close to the bed that Steve almost jumped, focused as he was on Tony.  “The King said I was not to disturb you, even though it is quite late in the morning,” he added, punctuating his words with a stern, disapproving look at Steve.
I could kill him, Steve thought as he bent low and put his hands to the ground.   Hammer was Stane’s guest, according to Zola. Which meant Cam would be here, somewhere.  I could kill Hammer, find Cam and then somehow get us both past the hundreds of royal guards between murdering a peer of the Realm and any shot at freedom.
“Fine,” Tony breathed out in defeat.  “I’m not getting on that thing, though,” he said, pointing at the stretcher.  He let Steve help him to his feet, and sure, he may have swayed a bit, but who cared, when he got to faceplant into Steve’s chest?  “I’ll get on this thing,” he suggested, then grinned up at Steve.
“In my copious amounts of free time?” Stark mused.  “Oh, you know. The usual.  Hang out with friends.  Watch movies.  Play cards.  We had a marathon game of Uno the other night that nearly ended in what one might charitably describe as fisticuffs,” Stark said with a short laugh.
“My ride’s almost here,” Steve said.  Happy was coming out the front door and down the steps towards where their car was parked.  He must have been in the kitchen with Jarvis, getting something to eat, Tony figured.  Tony looked around, but didn’t see another car anywhere.  A few moments later, he did, however, hear a low, thudding noise.
“I think,” she began, then slowed her steps, tilted her head and looked up at him. The music and car noise was loud, covering their conversation, not that anyone was paying attention, Steve noticed. “Look at what’s happening in the world.  Things are changing faster than I think any of us, except maybe Howard, ever anticipated. The world needs someone like you, Steve. Someone to believe in again. We haven’t had that in so long.
“Feels like I should be in some back alley in Brooklyn,” Steve said as he wiped a smear of blood from his lip, then caught it between his teeth and sucked at the wound. It really wasn’t fair sometimes, Tony thought with something of a mental whine as he finally got a look at Steve in the dim light of the hallway outside their cell.  It was like some kind of bizarre twin fantasy come to life. “Let’s go before more show up.” Steve started walking down the hall, only for Tony to grab him and pull him behind his back.
“Think he’ll bring the shield?” Rhodey asked, then bobbled his head back and forth, considering.  “I think he’ll bring the shield.”
“I got no problem with you calling someone out when they have it coming.  None of us avoid trouble.  It doesn’t have to find us.  All of us…we stand out there and shout at it until it comes down on us, because that’s what we do.  That’s who we are.  Just…maybe don’t do it on your own next time?  We’re a team, right?” Steve pointed out, pushing lightly against ‘Shifty’ and letting the bag bounce back against his hand.  “We should act like it.”
“Eh, could be better, not going to lie.  It’s the write down on all the R&D for those ICBM guidance systems,” Obie shrugged.  “You knew we’d take a hit.”
Well, for a hooker-fic, there has been a depressing lack of porn.  Let's fix that!  Thank you again for reading, commenting and kudo-ing.  This is apparently going to be epically long, if my outline is any indication.  Hope you enjoy!
He hadn’t seen Steve do anything artistic except paint the increasingly disturbing series of dark swirls that Tony had begun to think of as part of Steve’s Timmy’s In the Well Period, because they looked like a cry for help if Tony had ever seen one, not that he was about to mention that to his Alpha.  But this…this was beautiful.  Surreal and almost sensual, with her blank-faced, human-like form.  Not clunky or functional like his own ‘bots, but smooth, undulating metal forming a single, cohesive body, more like a sculpture than a machine.
Tyber stared at him incredulously.  He growled, low in his throat, and rushed forward, holding his spear aloft.  Anto loosed the spear-thrower. The point struck the ground right at Tyber’s feet.  He skidded to a stop and stared at it for a long moment, then looked up at Anto, watching as Anto nocked another spear.
Ah, fuck it, Tony thought, rushing to put the pillow back in its place and pull the bedspread tight enough to even out the wrinkles from where he had been lounging.  It still didn’t look quite right, but after a moment’s indecision, he figured either Steve wouldn’t care or a mussed bed was really the evening’s goal, anyway.
Steve’s mouth twisted into a frown, and he tugged at his backpack, clearly torn between an innate sense of punctuality and wanting to argue more with Tony.  He finally turned and walked towards one of the newer concrete, highrise blocks that dotted the campus, with Tony following a step behind, feeling a bit victorious, though he couldn’t say exactly why.   Probably because Steve didn’t let the door slam into his face when they entered the building.  Baby steps and all that.
“You’re not going to—what?  Birds?” Steve stopped, then laughed at the boy’s nod of absolute conviction.
“It was never about not trusting you, Steve.  I didn’t mean—look, when I said that—fuck.  You—you see the world how it should be, how it could be, if we’d all just—be better at it.  At this.  And we need that.
,” he said, tapping at his chest where his fingers made a hollow, muffled sound against the reactor.  “It got me back to you, but now…now, maybe it’s the thing keeping us apart, but it’s part of me, now, and I don’t know—I don’t know how to do this.  I need you.  So much, Steve, God, I do.  But, I need this, too.  I need this, and I need you, and I thought I was better about seeing how I could have things, but this…I know, it’s way, way too—too much, too something, but, it’s me, now.  A part of me, and I can’t go back to who I was before.  I don’t know if I even want to, except—except if you’re there, and if you can’t be here, then I—I don’t know how do this, so.”
“Who do you think you are to speak to me like that?” she spat out, then tossed her head back, sneering at Steve.  “I’ll enjoying watching you beg, I think.  You’ll almost be as pretty at it as Tony,” she replied, arching her brow.
“The missiles literally had my name on them.  I think that makes it a little my fault,” Tony replied.  He could feel a weariness that had nothing to do with the afternoon sun seep into his bones.  How many times had he been over this with Rhodey or Pepper or himself, in the mirror, when he could stand to look at the man staring back?
When they arrived at their destination, he found it was a private airport, not a piece of land waiting for a reactor site, and by “tour,” Tony meant fly over it in his private jet.  He ducked his head as he climbed onboard the sleek jet marked as Stark Industries.  Tony was sitting in one of the plush leather seats, Cheshire cat grin on his face.
Steve looked at him with a frown, then his face split into a smile. “Of course, you have a stash of things you’re not supposed to have.  What did you make that’s so bad?”
“Are you---are you sure?” Tony huffed out. Steve was either going to hit him or kiss him, so he went for the latter, grabbing him, suit and all and shoving him up and back against the wall, lifting him off the ground a bit as he claimed Tony’s mouth again, and that, well, that finally seemed to get the point across.  They somehow managed to make it to Tony’s bed, pieces of armor littering their path like shiny breadcrumbs, Tony stripping his clothes off in record time with absolutely no hint of embarrassment, stalking after Steve with an almost feral gleam in his eye.  Steve wasn’t sure what exactly it was he said to Tony, but it was apparently enough to make the other man practically rip his uniform off, so Steve figured it fell into the right thing to say category.   He was finally naked, sprawled on the bed with Tony hovering over him, and this, God, yes, this was what he’d been waiting for all these weeks, months, years, forever.  Tony was babbling about various gods for some reason Steve couldn’t fathom, but Tony wasn’t touching him and that seemed to be the more important point.
“So she can figure out what to tell her Bridge club about me?” Tony scoffed.  “Tell her about the car.  Tell her about the ‘bots and the SHIELD drone thing.  Not that she’ll care, but it’ll probably drive Howard crazy, so a job worth doing.  Tell her about…tell her…I’m fine.  Okay?  Tell her I’m fine.”
“I know. I know, it’s--it’s been a hard year, for both of us, with me and my--my issues. This...” Steve started, then stopped himself and glanced away.  “You sure you’re okay with this?  That
Steve grabbed a blue bottle of the dishwashing soap off the shelf and tossed that into the cart with the other options.  Maybe one of them was right, he thought with a slight grimace.
“He was stealing food, which, yeah, I know, it’s still thieving, but…” Steve sighed as he finished sucking the meat out of one of the crab legs, leaning back, his stomach actually full for the first time in awhile.  “Everyone was hungry. All the time. I can probably count on my hands how many times I’ve actually been full in my life. Now, I can add one more, I guess, thanks to you, Shellhead,” he added with a deferential nod towards his friend.  He patted his stomach and laid back, letting Shellhead push them along through the waves. Shellhead looked at him a long time, shaking his head with a sad, wistful smile.
“You so sure about that?” Tony responded, sharper than he meant.  “Forget it,” he said, pulling back his hands and slipping out of Steve’s embrace.  “Forget it, sorry, I’m…I don’t know what I am. I don’t know. I’m a mess.  I know, all of this, the armor, this
A part of Tony wanted to close his eyes and sink into blessed oblivion, but the paralysis kept his eyes open so he could watch it all unfold, with slow-moving horror, the way people craned their necks to watch an accident.  He probably deserved at least that much, he thought, wretched sadness coursing through him. To have to bear witness to the terrible results of his failures, his selfishness, his weakness.
“Well, it is my job to understand my patients, Captain,” the therapist said with a knowing, pleased smile, and for a second, Steve could see her sitting in a darkened theater, watching the news reels, tapping her foot impatiently for the picture to start for real so she could see Ginger Rogers, maybe, part of the sea of quiet disapproval aimed at the man shouting at the woman sniffling when the GIs waved from the screen.  Boorish, she would have said to herself.  Probably Irish.  They were always so loud.  But, really, must she cry in public like that, when we’re all just here trying to enjoy the movie and forget for a bit?  She was one of the ones who hurried past the alley way, pretended not to see, maybe talked a bit louder to her friend to cover the noise, and told herself later that it was a shame, really, that people couldn’t just be good-natured.  It wasn’t hard, after all, was it?
“You’d have courted me?” Tony asked in a far higher pitched voice then he intended.  He cleared his suddenly dry throat and swallowed heavily, lifting his head from his arm and staring at Steve.  “Really?”
“Keep him? That’s what you’ve got. That’s your brilliant advice.  Keep him.  Just…keep him,” Tony flustered.  “Helpful.  Great. Thanks for that.  Can I call you Dr. Rhodey?  How do you not have your own advice column? And you!” Tony said, turning and pointing an accusing finger at Pepper.  “You said take it slow.  Don’t do anything crazy. Stay focused.”
“So, Iron Man, he—he gets along pretty well with Captain America, huh?” Steve couldn’t help but ask.  “He doesn’t find him kind of, I don’t know, stodgy or—or boring?  Guy like that, might as well be from the Pleistocene, right?  Has to be kind of hard for someone--someone like Iron Man--to relate.”
be doing.  This ridiculous prophecy of yours that is a yoke around your neck as much as that collar, but one you wear far more willingly.  Eagerly, I think, though you won’t admit it.”
You poured my blood into the Hudson, he told her days later, while she stared at him, wide-eyed with dawning horror.
His feet were heavy and sluggish as he moved up the stairs and into the brightly lit vestibule.  Bits of the day’s mail were sticking out of the small, metal mailboxes.  Stan was standing in front of his open box, pulling out a stack of magazines that Tony would probably never be able to un-see.
“I’d make bank, and you know it, Wheezy,” Bucky replied, snapping his finger to a point at Steve.  “Still, this never should’ve happened. You never should’ve had to do this. If I’d just kept out of it, gotten ahold of my stupid temper—”
“Sorry.  Wasn’t expecting you to be there,” Tony muttered, giving Steve a quick, embarrassed glance.  He could feel his face heating, though he had nothing on Steve, who’s fair skin was doing a good impression of a tomato.
“Now, that wall,” Tony said conspiratorially as he tugged at the lapel of Steve’s jacket and nodded at the wall to their right where a painting of a ship in a storm hung next to a number of plaques from various organizations lauding Howard’s many accomplishments, which seemed to coincide with donations, as far as Tony could tell.  Man of the Year, sign here, please.  “Is a bearing wall.  So, pretty solid. Just pointing that out.  For no reason.  Well, architecture.”
Dark eyes that had watched Steve as he undressed, flickered up and down Steve’s body where he lay splayed on the bed.  “I’ve dreamed of this,” Tony murmured as he crawled onto the bed, stalking his way up to take Steve’s mouth again.  “Just look at you,” he husked out, smiling softly down at Steve as he pulled away.  Tony reached up and brushed the hair from Steve’s forehead, his touch surprisingly gentle.  “I’ve wanted this for so long. So very long.”
“You’re really going to love the island, by the way,” Tony promised. It made his heart swell that Steve was so overcome that he was slowly banging his head against the wall above the pass-through slot.  He should really stop that though.  They were probably going to need to stand like this for a long time.  He should see about getting Steve a magazine.  Maybe that one from Time where he was named Man of the Year. But it really wouldn’t be a good idea to move just yet.
Steve frowned, then leaned forward on all fours and crawled up the bed until he had a hand on each side of Tony’s hips and a knee on either side of Tony’s outstretched legs.  “You really think I care about that? You’re beautiful, Tony. Besides, I’ve seen enough guys with war wounds far worse, I’m sure. It isn’t going to bother me.”
“That was a very brave thing you did, Steve,” the man said, interrupting Steve’s thoughts. “Most people, even men grown, would not stand between someone else and certain harm the way you did,” the man continued, his voice deep and almost...sad, though that didn’t make any sense.  “Very brave, indeed. Too brave, for one so young, I think. I fear it could have gone far worse were a loss of balance not one of the few blessings of alcohol.”
This Thank You Fic request was for a blind date AU where Pepper and Natasha set them up.  I went with the premise that Tony never revealed himself as Iron Man and no one knows Captain America's true identity, so double identity porn, whee!!!
He wanted to touch himself.  Needed to touch himself.  Rub at his cock, even through his robes, shift up against the seat, take his cock in hand and give his balls some relief from the weight….something,
“Hell of a pick-up line you’ve got there. Okay, okay,” Tony blinked, rubbing a hand over his chin.  “Let me get this straight. So, this Gift, as you like to call it, it heals, which is obviously very cool and convenient, so you what?  You ‘share’ the Gift with your mate, and that means, with the, ah,” he mimed having a big belly sticking out in front of him and nodded.
way that his head couldn’t quite latch onto.  He just knew it was good.  He was leaking everywhere, a warm, viscous fluid against the cold confines of his trunks, soothing the fiction when they moved in time with each other.  Tony’s cock rubbed over his, pushing, seeking, growing demanding as his mouth sucked harder at Steve’s nipple.
“He’s my next phone call,” Tony promised, disconnecting the line.  He stepped inside the dismal apartment, leaving the door cracked behind him and picked his way over to the sofa.  It smelled vaguely like Cheetos and…drain cleaner, Tony thought with a grimace of distaste.  There was a large, white pizza box soaked through with a grease stain taking up one cushion and a couple of t-shirts, something he wasn’t touching with a ten-foot pole, and a Jets jersey tossed over the arm.  He sat down on the, well, not clean space, but…empty spot, anyway, and dialed Rhodey.
He should have insisted on a Courtship. Even back in Steve’s day, a Bonding without a Courtship was frowned upon.  It usually meant either the couple was very, very rich or they’d, well, gotten to know each other a bit too much. That’s how his mother put it in her own delicate way when Steve was little.  Those two were too friendly with each other, she’d say. It had taken an embarrassing number of years for Steve to understand what she meant. Bucky had really taken the Mickey out of him for that one, Steve remembered with a wistful, deprecating smile.
“I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. Okay, well, that’s a lie, I have tons of money.  Anyway, forget that part.  As I was saying, what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let the science go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.  Well, not kill.  That’s a bit over the top.  But, I will write an incredibly well-cited journal article about how you’re wrong.  Looking at you, Elon,” Tony said into the can, then dropped it to dangle from the string in its place by his workstation, watching the can until it stopped swaying.   He sighed, shoved his hands in his pockets and turned toward the reason he was here.
“Holy shit,” Tony managed, running a hand through his hair, the other over his face and chest, having nothing to do with them all of a sudden.  He gripped the cool sheets, flexed his fingers in them, and felt his lungs scream for air.  Oh, right.  Breathe.  It burst out of him in a bark of air as Steve’s mouth found the head of his cock and latched on, spreading Tony’s boxers flush around his cock as Steve’s tongue traced the slit through the material.  An answering flood of slick wet Tony’s backside, and he could feel himself loosening, readying to take his Alpha.
“I enjoyed it, too,” Tony said, his voice low and husky, like he was sharing a secret. Steve felt the words in a rush of liquid heat deep inside him, his limbs going loose and boneless. Tony cleared his throat, and Steve’s mind seemed to clear at the sound, too. “And today, the ride was not too difficult? I thought of having you and Cam wait back with Matt, but… I admit, I wanted your company.”
Tony kept looking Rogers over, since he hadn’t been told not to, and he was being open-minded and shit.  Whatever image Tony had conjured in his mind, it sure as hell wasn’t this, he could freely admit.  Handsome didn’t really quite capture Rogers, Tony thought, like it was too small a concept for what Rogers was like in person.  More like, someone should put him on a billboard kind of gorgeous that made Tony suddenly feel ridiculous with his hair that wouldn’t stop trying to curl, watercolor suit and make-up that was probably smudged by now, though, it was kind of nice that Rogers appeared to have put some effort into his appearance, too.  That was something.  Not like Tony wasn’t a sure thing, at least as far as Rogers knew, but it was something.
Arousal sparked in Steve’s belly, like a dam breaking and a great river of need and desire flowing deep, pushing its way past everything else and rushing, rushing over his skin, his mind, pooling at the base of his cock.  Fluid leaked out, dripping from the tip of the cage and down onto the rug.  It should embarrass him, how messy he was, but Steve couldn’t bring himself to care. There was only Tony. The feel of him, the taste of him, the scrape of his beard against Steve’s skin, the cut of his teeth on Steve’s lips, pain and pleasure and Tony.
it went okay.  Good, maybe.  Even kind of…great,” Tony mumbled with a frown.  “Obviously, I was…wrong about…that.”
“I guess what I’m…what I’m trying to say is that I spent most of my life missing out on a lot of doing, you know?” Steve continued, talking to the waves like it was a completely normal thing to do.  “Then I got better, but there was work, just trying to make enough to scrape by, and then the War came,” Steve recalled with a flat grimace. “When I look back, there isn’t much of any of that where it feels like any kind of life, so much as a getting by until the next day and then the next after that.  Running off down here, it was maybe crazy, I don’t know. Probably was. I just knew I couldn’t stay there any longer, and down here, away from everyone, I thought maybe I’d find a way to—to want to—to want
“Told you this one was trouble,” a voice said from below and the slam of the front door echoed in the stairwell.  Steve’s head swiveled.  Rollins, Mitchell and Griffin were standing below, looking up at the scene with nearly identical smirks on their faces.  They were clearly surprised to find him here, but it was also clear that he was who they were here for.  A hunting party, Steve thought, just like back in Afghanistan, except this time, it wasn’t terrorists they were after.
“Hey, no,” Steve said quickly.  His eyes had gone soft, wrinkling just a bit at the corners.  “Whatever you’re telling yourself, no, okay?”
By the time Steve and Cam made it back to the Castle later that afternoon, Steve could tell that the preparations for the evening’s festivities were in full swing.  The windows in Tony’s chambers were thrown open, allowing in a breeze that carried the sound of bustling activity with it.  Tony was nowhere to be seen, not that Steve had expected him to be there, what with all the guests clamoring for his attention before he departed the city.
Firstpost, as it was known, whatever name it had originally borne lost to time, was a fairly nondescript inn situated at a crossroads.  It was popular with merchants traveling between the port and city who often spent the night, as Cam had chattily informed him at some point during their ride out of the city, whether this was out of necessity or some delight at sleeping in the bed of kings.
“Not so very much,” Steve assured him automatically. It wasn’t true, but the pain was almost welcome now, a steady, stinging ache he could focus on, something that could be fixed.
“Might be the safest thing to do with it,” Steve said quietly.  He was staring at the screen, an odd sort of detachment in his voice that made the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck stand on end.
And really, the sooner he got Steve to the island, the sooner he could explain all of this. “JARVIS, where are we on the island purchase?” Tony asked, getting silence in reply.
“He agreed, didn’t he?  Son of a bitch,” Tony ground out, his motions coming to a halt.  He put down the soldering iron and took off the goggles, tossing them and the gloves on top of the worktable.  He spun around on his stool to survey the empty workshop, then ran a hand up and down his face and through his hair in frustration.  He was so screwed.  He knew it. Fury sure as hell knew it.
“Look at you,” Tony said, leaning over and running an already oil-slicked hand through the waterfall of beads that hung down over part of Steve’s chest, leaving a glistening trail down Steve’s stomach.  “All golden,” he smiled and let his hand drift down to Steve’s groin, where a light fuzz of blonde hair was just beginning to return.
“So, uh, you okay there?” Tony asked with more than a little trepidation.  Please have liked this, please have liked, please have liked this, he mentally chanted.
Finally, the carriage slowed and came to a halt while they waited for the other riders and carriages in the procession in front of them to dismount.  Steve sat up and looked out the window, past Cam’s shoulder, to where a crowd had gathered around a large building made of grey stone and timber, with various pastoral scenes painted on the front and a royal crest just over the door.  Smoke puffed out of the chimney in a slow, meandering curl.  A large stable was off to one side. Next to it was what looked like a small brewery. It hardly looked suited to house a king for the night, but tradition demanded it, and Ms. Potts, who had planned their journey down to the most minute detail, certainly understood the importance of observing tradition.
“People do some weird things,” Cam replied, drawing out the last two words, then letting out a low whistle.  “Lena said she heard one of the girls say Lord Stern likes them to pee on him.”
Please note that I have no medical knowledge and want to keep it that way.  Can't even stand to watch Grey's Anatomy. I'm that squeamish.  So, any medical stuff in here is from the quickest Google search I could possibly get away with doing and is likely largely inaccurate.  Suspend disbelief for me, would you?
“I don’t—I don’t know,” Steve admitted in nearly a wail.  Please, God, he couldn’t take that.  Not the blows, the failure.  Disappointing Tony with the one thing Tony had told him to do.  He couldn’t.  He couldn’t. He couldn’t. He—he could say it.  Say his word.  End this. He didn’t want it to end.  Tomorrow, he thought with a strange sense of clarity.  I have to say the words tomorrow. Tonight, I just have to remember the count.
He’d remembered, Tony realized with a spike of relief.  Steve had remembered.  Steve had planned for it. Like it mattered. Like Tony’s birthday meant something, Tony thought, swallowing thickly.
“Bye, J,” Tony said, raising one hand with a slight wave as Jarvis pulled the door shut behind him.  A moment later, he heard the car engine start and the telltale sound of tires on gravel that marked Jarvis’s departure.
“Pepper’s still trying to be slightly disapproving in the hopes of reforming me through sheer force of will, but she’s secretly doing one of those touchdown dances in her head,” Tony said, lips quirking into a smile as he caught Pepper rolling her eyes and bobbing her head, though she couldn’t quite manage to keep the grin off her face.
“You were perfect, Steve.  So good for me.  You did so good.  Relax.  I’ve got you,” Tony murmured, hands still roaming across Steve’s skin where he shook.
“I’ve never wanted you more,” Tony replied honestly, taking in Steve wearing the shirt he’d conspired with Jarvis to make, proclaiming ‘I’m Steve. I’m Tony’s Omega. We’re bonded.’ Tony could just see the fading blue of the bruise at the curve of Steve’s neck, and fuck if that wasn’t hot as hell, his Omega bearing his mark, on his knees before him, eyes downcast and head bowed. True, he always wanted Steve, but the ferocity of it now was startling. It was an almost blinding, overwhelming need to please, to take care of Steve, to see him happy, this purpose that he had somehow been gifted with. Steve was happiness. Steve was Tony’s happiness, and for some reason Tony still couldn’t quite fathom, Steve looked at Tony and saw his own.
They had fallen in love, but neither of them had learned how to love each other in a way that was not born of sacrifice. He had taken, because he had needed it, and because Tony would freely give, but he had ended up with less somehow. He could see that now, in startling clarity. Steve felt himself propelled forward, almost as if wrenched forward by strings, a part of one of Tony’s crank and pulley system, until he was standing in front of Tony, head bowed into the curve of Tony’s neck.
, he thought quietly.  Not like this is your first time meeting an Omega.  Though quite rare, if you were in Tony’s sphere, brokers practically threw them at you.  Being introduced was one thing.  An Omega at a party was a coup, after all, and he did throw the best parties.  They were beautiful, sure.  Tending to the smaller side, long, graceful limbs, always attracting a crowd just wanting to be in their presence.  He supposed, if you thought about it, which he certainly had not spent a ton of time doing, nope, but if one did think about these things, then maybe it made some kind of crazy sense, what Erskine had done.  Omegas naturally drew people to them, Alphas and Betas sought out their presence like sirens, everyone seemingly happy just to be around them.  Throw in some serum and vita-rays, and you have yourself a charismatic leader.
“Sir, I would note that Ms. Potts has accessed that particular file eight times since Ms. Romanov sent it,” JARVIS, the helpful bastard, supplied.
“Tony,” Steve drawled in a low voice, lips pulling into a half smile at Tony’s obvious indecision. “Get in the shower with me,” he urged, except it sounded all husky and warm and smushed together in the way that New Yorkers sometimes could.  Tony’s mouth fell open. He was fairly sure it was because all of the blood just left his head. At any rate, he couldn’t seem to form actual words.
“Please stop. I’m going to need to, I don’t know, get some Metamucil.  And a clapper.  Do you remember the clapper? I feel the arthritis setting in. And the sudden desire for a 99-cent buffet.  Pretty sure I have a coupon that’s only barely out of date.”
The shimmy had been the first sign.  At least, Tony thought it might have been. Which, as it turned out, was unfortunate, because spaceships shimmied a lot more than anyone who had been to space apparently wanted to admit.  They shimmied. They shook. They made noises that you tried to ignore. There would be the occasional creak and groan, noises that you barely noticed back on earth, but were magnified to a clamor in the vacuum of space.  You got used to it, that was the problem. After a while. The noises, the motions, the weirdness of it, after it didn’t kill you for a while, you couldn’t sustain that incredibly heightened level of concern for days on end, so you got used to it.
Pushing himself up to his knees, Steve took each of Tony’s feet in turn and removed his shoes, then his socks.  Tony watched with a sort of detached fascination.  His heart was fluttering, hummingbird-like, in his chest, and there were creeping spots of bright red warming his skin, but he was calm. Centered.  Steve would take care of him.
“Well,” Howard said after a moment, his voice hard enough to make Tony go still and silent.  “That isn’t an option.  Since we’re being upfront with each other, I’ll tell you what your options are, how about that?  You go, make nice with the Captain, get him to Bond and have a nice life as the Omega of someone important.  Or, you keep on with this…this unnatural defiance that you seem to take great joy in spouting…and the Captain decides he’d much prefer some sweet, little thing who doesn’t mouth off or get it in his head to build a reactor in the basement on a whim—“
“Just wanted to help people, I guess,” Steve repeated the familiar answer.  Stark snorted and waved the hand holding the piece of bread in front of his face, like he was batting away the words.
“They.  The others.  Those idiots who are not here, and want to be here,” she replied, smile widening.  She had a thick accent that seemed to almost swallow parts of her words, though it was not unpleasant, just unfamiliar.
“What?  What are you talking about?  Because he asked me to come back, all of a sudden you think he has feelings…that…that makes no sense,” Steve said, shaking his head.
“Why are you here, Tony?” Steve asked, stiff-backed and holding himself stunted somehow, hunched and impossibly smaller, in a way Steve should never be. He shut the door with far too much care before turning around to face Tony like he was facing the proverbial firing squad. Tony wondered if he looked the same way, resigned and scared and just waiting for the first shot to be fired, so this could finally be done.
“Tony go with Steve,” Anto nodded.  He adjusted his medicine bag, pulled the sack over his shoulder and fell into step next to Steve.
“I’m not—no.  He hasn’t even asked.  I mean, I’m sure he’s curious, but,” Tony replied feeling suddenly…something.  Nauseous, maybe.  Defensive.  He had to forcibly resist the urge to clutch his hands around a car battery that wasn’t there.  “I’m not—I’m not giving it to anyone. This is, it’s me—mine. I mean.  It isn’t for the company or—whatever.”
“Hard to say,” Steve replied, lifting his shoulders in a low shrug.  “They didn’t really do a whole lot of talking.”
“That—that doesn’t make sense,” Tony stammered.  “None of this makes sense.  This is Steve we’re talking about.  He’d say something.  Hell, this is the guy who announces to a base full of possible Hydra agents that he’s there to take down their wannabe-Nostradamus flying death ships.  He wouldn’t know subtle if it hit him with a vibranium arm.”
“Why? Does my face look familiar?” Steve deadpanned. Tony couldn’t stop the sharp, half-aghast laugh that burst out of him at that. Cute and interesting, Tony thought with a smile, then caught Pepper’s eye and realized he was smiling like a lunatic at Steve and promptly coughed into his hand to cover another laugh.
Suddenly, he needed to get out of the suit.  Needed it to not be touching his skin.  It was like he could feel every nerve ending at once, rubbing the edges raw.  He needed out of it.  To get cleaned up.  Get clean.
After a moment, Jarvis drew back and scraped a chair along the floor so that he was sitting next to Tony, facing him, while Tony hung his head over the mug and stared at the contents.
“I like a strong appetite,” Tony cut in, then grinned, finding something amusing in that which eluded Steve. “And you needed to eat.”
“I think Captain Rogers believed—or maybe hoped—that you would be…pleased,” Coulson said, giving Tony a measuring look.
The first two events passed by quickly enough.  Stone won the sword melee handily enough. Steve’s fingers itched for his shield, but Tony seemed largely uninterested, which was its own kind of victory.  One of Rand’s knights won the archery competition. Clint would have laughed his fool head off, Steve thought. The final event was the joust. Wine and sweetmeats were passed around, though Steve gave his share of the food to Cam.  Finally, it came down to Stone and one of Tony’s guards tilting at each other across the lists. Stone’s lance broke against the other man’s shield, unseating him on the first pass. On the second, both men went down. The third decided it in Stone’s favor, much to Steve’s disappointment.  His squire rushed out with a fresh lance, and he rode over to the King’s box, tipping his lance down in deference.
“It’s been too long. I’m not—I can’t wait. Need you, please, please, Steve, now. Need you inside me,” Tony babbled, tugging at the leather shoulders of Steve’s uniform until Steve obliged and moved up to capture Tony’s mouth, hot and wet and welcoming. Steve pushed his tongue in past Tony’s lips, sliding it along the length of Tony’s, swiping and licking against it until Tony’s shuddering moan echoed, sending a sharp spike of need directly to his cock. He wanted Tony, but he always wanted Tony, wanted to please him, bury himself inside him and bury other things too, hold Tony while he shook with the force of it, a physical release, but something more that always seemed to catch Tony almost by surprise, but this…he wanted this to be something else. Needed it to be something else, something he didn’t know how to give any other way.
He forced himself not to sprint down the hall to Tony’s private office.  He needed to think.  Figure out what he would say.  That Stane was plotting against Tony, still?  That he offered to arrange Steve’s transport home?  What kinds of questions would that admission hasten? He was so caught up in his thoughts, he rounded the hallway corner and almost walked right into the open door in front of him before Rhodes’ voice halted him in his tracks.
“Well, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition,” Stark replied with a glib smile that dropped into a frown as he pulled back in his seat and rested his elbows on the table, giving Steve a curious look.  “It’s a Monty Python reference—seriously, Python, you don’t—nevermind.  Forget it.  So, Steve, how’d you meet, ah—what’s your friend’s name who set this up on your end?”
“You’ll do,” Tony said finally, voice rough and thick, and clearly not as unaffected as he would like to seem, which did something to Steve’s stomach that made it flutter and roil.  “Just, you know.  It’s all good. Get what you want,” Tony blurted out, standing up from his seat, one hand going to the center of his chest in what Steve realized was something of a habit.  “I’ll just—I’ll be outside.  If you need anything, ask.  I’m sure any one of the Twelve Dancing Princesses out there can get you anything you need.”  He was out the dressing room door before Steve could formulate much of a response, so he ended up trying on a few other items before just grabbing some others in the same size and heading out.
“Huh,” Tony nodded.  “I know some people on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee.  Could make some calls.”
He wasn’t a great singer by any means, but he had a nice enough voice, or so he had been told.  Deep and clear, and the Irish tended to come out more in song, like it had been laying in wait all the years when his Ma said he had to speak right or lose any shot at bettering himself and saw its chance whenever there was a song.  Steve cleared his throat, glanced over at Shellhead, who smiled at him, warm and encouraging, except--except it wasn’t, not exactly, not the way it usually was, like it, too, had something behind it always waiting for a chance to get out.   Then, the feeling was gone, and it was just Shellhead, smiling at him, the way he always did. Steve sucked in a breath, closed his eyes, and started to sing.
“Not to put too fine a point on it, but you’re on the other end of that blind date, you know that, right?” Natasha replied with a smirk.
“Yes, Tony,” Steve replied.  It barely sounded like his voice, cracking like a split of wood, but he stopped pulling against the chains and felt some of the tightness leak out of his body at Tony’s words.  He could be good a little longer, if Tony wanted him to.
Hammer twisted his head to stare at him for a long moment, then burst out laughing, slapping his hands on his thighs in some strange mimicry of delight.
Somehow, in all of that, his mind still hazy from the night, Steve had not quite realized the import of things until Tony helped him up to relieve himself, chuckling lowly as Steve stared stupidly at his reddened cock chafing against the gold bars that encased it.  Steve had opened his mouth to ask Tony to remove it, then closed it again.  He hadn’t been sure if he wanted that or not. He wasn’t sure, even now, what he wanted. He wanted not to think about what this journey would bring, one way or the other, and he certainly had that.
It was like nothing Steve had ever felt before.  Velvety hardness burned along his cock as Tony’s hips ground against his, driving their cocks together through the ring of his hand.  Steve’s mouth hung open.  His eyes glazed over and everything went slightly hazy, like he was looking at the world through a frosted window.  Tony’s head dipped down, kissing a searing line down Steve’s chest, his beard scraping rough against the skin, until his mouth fastened on the nipple he previously tormented.  Steve moaned, loud and low, as Tony pulled the sensitive peak into his mouth.  It almost seemed as if there was a direct line between his nipple and his cock, as it throbbed with each tug of Tony’s mouth on the taut, abused nub.  Tony’s other hand came up to play with the other nipple, leaving Steve awash in more sensation than he could have ever imagined.
Tony’s head rang, a loud, low whine that seemed strangely elongated.  Stabs of pain jarred his nerves. He blinked, slowly, but it was something.  His fingers seized, grasping at the air as spikes of feeling started to return.  He sucked in a breath, just a thin wisp of air, but it burned like fire down his throat and bloomed icy-hot in his chest.  His head lolled to the side. His phone. His phone was there, where he had tossed it earlier. He could call Rhodey. Rhodey could help Steve, Tony thought desperately.  Save Steve. That was all that mattered.
Steve didn’t pause to worry about Stane, figuring Happy could handle that, just ran after him, saw him brush past dinner guests, who turned in confusion at the spectacle of their host crashing through the room, bumping and jostling his way across the living room to the steps leading to the workshop without paying any heed to what he was doing or the chaos in his wake.  Steve didn’t care, just raced after him, pushing his way through guests and servers as quickly as he could.  He saw Pepper and Rhodey turn to follow Tony’s movements with concerned gazes, but Tony was down the steps and through the workroom door before Steve could reach him. Steve reached out to grab the handle to the workroom and pulled.  It was locked.  Dammit, Tony, he thought in frustration.
Shelhead’s eyes were wide, his mouth tight, and he looked away as soon as Steve’s eyes fell on him.  His shoulders seemed to sag, even his tentacles drooped. Shellhead shook his head, almost violently, and slammed his fists against the edge of the
“Dugan says a lot of things,” Steve replied, though he knew from Bucky’s shrewd look that the other man had not missed the lack of denial. He had not decided, but he had, a strange sort of knowledge of what he was going to do without the call to action that comes from acknowledging it.
“That what this is?” Steve asked, then let his head fall back and hit the tile wall behind him as his arms came up to wrap around Tony’s waist, just below where the shower hit so he caught the mist of the spray flecking off Tony’s back.  “That what we’re doing here? Communicating?”  Steve wasn’t sure, but he thought it might be.
“How he is with me?” Steve repeated, blinking in confusion, though he wasn’t sure if he was still sluggish from whatever concoction of drugs Bruce had come up with or just the fact that nothing Bruce was saying made much sense.
“It’ll only be a minute,” Tony said dully.  Steve gave him a long look, but sat back in his seat and looked down at the backpack sitting between his feet on the floor of the car.
“I build missiles.  I think I can figure out---ouch!  Damnit, why is it beeping at me?” Tony said, shoving his stinging finger in his mouth.  “Do not.  Under any circumstances.  Ask Barnes for help.”
He leaned forward and kissed the line of Steve’s jaw, hands running up Steve’s arms and over his shoulders, then winding around behind Steve’s head where they tangled in his hair, still spikey and damp from earlier.  Steve’s mouth fell open as Tony’s tongue traced the seam, and he pushed his tongue inside, sliding along Steve’s in a slow caress.  Tony pulled back and looked at Steve, cupping the sides of Steve’s face in his hands.
That particular day ended with all three of them building the sand into a miniature of the castle and city, complete with a driftwood drawbridge, much to Cam’s astonished delight, Steve recalled with a fond smile.  He had been distraught at the idea of leaving their work to the sea to reclaim, so Tony commissioned a model of the whole castle complex, complete with knights and horses, nobles, and all manner of commoners engaged in various tasks.  Cam adored it, of course. He spent hours at the model, having vivid imaginary battles with the tiny working catapults and trebuchets and glorious celebratory feasts in their wake.
Steve swallowed again, nearly choking as bile climbed higher in his throat. He stood, carefully avoiding anyone else’s eyes, even the weight of sympathy he felt from Rhodes, and walked on shaky limbs back to the tent that had been set up for him and Tony to share.
It was getting progressively more difficult to reconcile how much he enjoyed being with Tony with how much he hated why he was there.
“Why would I not?  It is a good life for those such as us,” Kadina replied. “Better, than many others, Raj’Inama.  They may have no collar, but what freedom is there in hunger and constant toil?  I have watched mothers give a final bath to babes they could not feed and old folks walk into the desert to meet the sun so they would no longer burden their children.  Backs bent from working the land.  Breath that comes out black and bloody from the mines.  Wars that leave nothing but widows and orphans in their wake.  My life may not be entirely my own, but who among the likes of us can say theirs truly is?  Was your life always your own to lead as you wanted?”
“Yeah,” Steve said, gaze snapping back to Tony.  “I know.  I never meant to push you away, Tony.  You have to believe me.  It was never you.  I just…I kept trying to find a way to make everything work.  Like if I just thought it through one more time, I could figure it out.  A way to keep everyone from getting hurt, and—I don’t know.  I guess I screwed that one up, didn’t I?”
“I am a selfish man,” Tony began, eyes hard on the wall where the fountain streamed water in a steady cascade.  A denial jumped to Steve’s lips, but he held his tongue and waited. “You are mine, now, and I can’t deny that I am glad of it, however it came to pass,” he said, voice tight. “I shouldn’t be.  I know it.  But, you are here, safe and free from want, and I—”
“Give Matt a hundred thousand dollars,” Matt said.  “Just checking,” he smiled into the silence.  “Look, all I’m saying is, so far, we’ve done a few slightly illegal things that in all likelihood, no one is going to care about if we get Stane and a few bigger fish on a silver platter for the Feds.  So…maybe you just…don’t say anything.  To the press, I mean. I’m not saying you make it official while you’re at the courthouse anyway, but, maybe you just…see how it goes.  Give it a while.  Head back to Malibu.  You’ve got, what, twelve bedrooms in that place?  Get to know each other some more.
Tyber feinted forward, making a chuffing-growling sound that Anto recognized as challenge, though Steve didn’t seem to.  Instead, he just crossed his arms and drew himself up to his full height and stood there, not answering Tyber’s aggression, but not exactly backing down, either.
“We could’ve worked this out on the island,” Tony groused, idly shifting his chair closer to Steve and reaching to lace his fingers through Steve’s hand, feeling instantly better when he could feel Steve’s warm skin beneath his.
“Truth is,” Tony began.  “I haven’t actually been with anyone for a while.”  He cleared his throat and slowed his motions, looking up at Steve.  “Since Afghanistan. Being hospitalized for that long, they run all kinds of tests.  So. So, I’m clean, I’m saying.”
“You are, after all, an Alpha in his prime. Young, strong, a natural leader. Exactly what an Alpha should be,” she continued, smooth, the words intended as a compliment, an opening salvo to pave the way for whatever hoop it was she wanted him to jump through.  You made me this way, Steve wanted to say, but it sounded like an accusation, and maybe it was, so he said nothing.  “Your file says you never Bonded.  That’s certainly understandable, what with your service record.  Iraq and then two tours in Afghanistan, was it?  Hardly time to find a mate in all that, I can imagine.  But, you must have thought about it.  You’re of an age when settling down might…well, look a bit more
Okay.  Okay, so this wasn’t going to be an over-and-done apology dinner.  Steve was hurting, and Steve didn’t trust that this thing between them wasn’t going to evaporate again, maybe not the way it had before, but, for Steve, this was something that could still be taken away again on Tony’s whim.  Which meant, Tony had to show him that wasn’t going to happen.  He could do this.
“So let him fucking sue me,” Brock shrugged, using one of the kitchen chairs to pull himself up.  He leaned back against the table, lips curled into a smirk.  “We’ll have a nice, big court case about it.  You can tell the jury how you bent over all nice like for all those zeroes.  Make for great TV.  You can wear one of those fancy new suits of yours.”
“I was thinking your ass belongs in a museum more than those sharks,” Steve replied.  “Sorry. Didn’t mean to ruin the mood.”
“War is a terrible thing.  David talks about what he saw, maybe now more than ever.  I think he knows there isn’t much time left for those who were there.  Who remember what its really like.  He insists on coming to these things because he wants them, the young ones, to know.  Sees it as his responsibility,” Charles explained.  “He thinks we shouldn’t have been so quick with ‘Nam.”
“Guess we could give it a try,” Steve said, pulling the oars in and reaching for the rope, a part of his hammock at one time, that raised the sail.  To Steve’s surprise, the sail caught the wind rather nicely, puffing out, but holding together. He sat back and admired it for a moment, then turned to Shellhead, who bobbed along next to the boat and was grinning himself.
“I’m certainly trying. He accepts it better than his charge, whose decadences are woefully difficult to discern at times,” Tony remarked, eyes narrowing on Steve as a fond smile tugged at his lips.
Steve could feel his cheeks heat, though why, he couldn’t say exactly. The man had seen him naked, after all. Hell, he still had a hundred dollar bill folded in his wallet from their last encounter, but here he was, shifting between feet while Stark stared at him, mouth opening and closing once before he shot a somewhat annoyed glance over his shoulder where Ms. Potts was watching him with a smirk from the doorway of the bedroom.
“Wow.  It really has been a day,” Tony admitted balefully, scraping a hand across his mouth.  “Okay, so what’s the plan?  We go out.  Eat.  Drink. Be married, whatever.  We get ourselves seen—shouldn’t be hard.  Act all, you know,” Tony continued, waving a hand in the air.  “Press eats it up.  Police back off.  We buy a few days. Batroc takes the phony arc reactor specs I gave him to Obie, and bless our hiring department for not having anyone on payroll smart enough to know that those are all crap.  I mean, granted, there are few times when you can really pat yourself on the back for promoting incompetence, but--”
So, that had not gone the best, Steve thought to himself. Tony was frustrated. They all were. Their failures were orders of magnitude bigger than most, and as hard as it was on him to accept, Steve knew it was even harder on Tony. Tony thought he should be smart enough to see every permutation, to anticipate all the possibilities, and be ready for them. When he inevitably couldn’t, it chipped away at his carefully crafted armor--not the Iron Man suit, the one he wore around himself to keep that modicum of distance between who he wanted to be and who he
try that thing the Reverend suggested.  Though, it wasn’t as if he felt out of sorts or anything. Quite the opposite, really.  He always woke up from these dream-nights feeling sated and worn, but good, too.  Exhilarated. Like his body was brimming with energy.
He looked down and realized that he had nearly eaten the entire plate of food and felt a flush of embarrassment creep up his neck and warm his face.  When he looked up again, Tony was watching him with an expression of such hunger that almost made Steve draw back.  Tony’s lips were red, Steve noticed.  Dark and pink against the whiteness of his skin.  Steve blinked and looked back down at the nearly empty plate.  What was wrong with him?  It was surely impolite to stare, and certainly not appropriate to think about the man’s lips.  He should have insisted Tony eat something, too, instead of scarfing down the man’s food.  Even though Tony certainly appeared wealthy, who knew how difficult it was to get food up here? Steve’s mother would box his ears for such rudeness, surely.
Ms. Potts looked at him for a long moment, her shrewd gaze seeming to bore into him so much that Steve was half afraid she was going to say whatever it was Steve couldn’t figure out for himself.  In fact, she opened her mouth to say something, then closed it again, pursing her lips.  “Of course, Steve.  I’ll give him the message,” she said, her voice a little softer now.  “You take care of yourself, okay?”
“Hello,” Captain Rogers replied, voice sort of slurred, like he wasn’t sure of his word choice.  Tony watched him shift his stance, hands falling to his sides as he sort of stutter-stepped like he was going to walk forward and got caught rethinking it in the middle of acting on the thought.  “Ah.  Thank you.  For coming today, I mean.  All the way here.  I know that was a trip.  For you and your family.  I really appreciate that.  Ah…may I call you Anthony?”
Stunned silence seemed to erupt around him. Behind him, Steve heard Cam let out a soft gasp. Ross’ shocked face turned to Steve, then over to Tony. Under his breath, the Ul let out a low huff, his dark, beady eyes gleaming.
With a reluctant sigh, Tony folded the comforter down and flopped over onto his back, staring up at the ceiling.  Last night already had this hazy, faded quality to it, like he couldn’t quite call it up from memory.  Not dreamlike, exactly, just not fully real either, not the way other memories were.  Maybe because he hadn’t quite managed to absorb it all yet.
Beside his shoulder, Steve was nodding while someone—Stewart again, Tony realized—spoke in animated tones about things that didn’t matter.  Food and champagne pairings and palate cleansers.  Someone reached around Tony’s shoulder for the champagne bottle from the silver bucket, making the icy water slosh and crunch, but he heard Steve tell them they weren’t ready for it yet.  This hyper-awareness of detail coupled with a blurry dullness of the full picture that followed in the wake of one of his little episodes was familiar, though there was nothing comforting about it.  It was just…something to get through.  One more legacy of Afghanistan he got to carry with him these days.  Though, that hadn’t been as bad as other times, where he’d been left shaking and sweating, rocking back and forth on the floor.
“Oh-ho-ho, I know where this is going.  Not about Barnes, huh.  Well, who the fuck is it about then?  Huh?  Who’s it about?  Don’t think I didn’t see this coming.  You’ve been all weird since you got back to the hotel.  Were you thinking about it then?  You were, weren’t you?  You little shit, you really think you can do this to me, huh?” Brock demanded, punctuating each question with a stab of his finger.  “Leave Brock Rumlow high and dry.  No way.  No
“Hand,” Steve replied in that same flat, tired tone from earlier that Tony was starting to find incredibly grating.
“Turn around. Face the wall.  Put your hands on it and spread your legs,” Tony said.  There was a shakiness to his voice, but the words still hit Steve’s gut with the same impact as always, twisting his insides with a heady mixture of desperate need, humiliation and anticipation.
Despite the late morning, they managed to leave Firstpost without too much delay.  A crowd gathered to see them off, and watch Tony thank the innkeeper with what Ms. Potts had told him was tradition.  Three gold coins, which Tony dropped one by one into the man’s hand while the crowd roared their approval. Tony gave them a jaunty wave and a practiced smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes, but they loved him all the same. A part of Steve wanted to shout that they barely knew him, that all the carefully cultivated stories, even Steve’s own appearance in them, wasn’t really who Tony was, but he knew the value of a myth.  Probably more than most, he understood the protection it gave to power.
Steve looked down at his plate and realized he hadn’t taken a bite yet, so picked up his fork and started eating.
“I can take the bus,” Steve replied curtly, glancing down the street where the bus had dropped them off earlier.
“I wanted to talk,” Steve replied.  He pushed off the railing and started walking towards Tony, slow and steady, like he was afraid Tony would bolt.  Which, fair enough.  Not like Tony wasn’t considering it.  The closer Steve got to him, the better an option it seemed.
“I’ll talk to the tech guy,” Steve laughed.  “He’s kind of annoying sometimes, but I think he can be persuaded.”
Tony rolled off to the side of Steve and looked down. Then, without warning, he bent his head down and wrapped his mouth around the head of Steve’s cock still held trapped in his hand.  Steve shouted out a curse, bowed up and probably would have knocked a knee into Tony’s head, but for years of practice and training that kept his reflexes in fighting shape.
“Enough,” Tony said, shaking his head, mouth pursed into a grim line, though his voice was steady. “Perhaps the night was too much for you. You’re—you’re not yourself right now, so I will forgive this. Sleep. We will speak no more of this tonight.”
“Hello there,” the man replied.  His voice was smooth and cultured, though Steve wasn’t exactly certain what that meant, other than the man must read a lot of books, of which there were four in the church library approved for reading, none of which appealed to Steve even if he could read the words.  Who wanted to read some old monk drone on and on about why we were all sinners meant to burn in eternal hell when you had the Reverend to tell you that?  Probably a man like this had a lot of books that didn’t tell you that you were going to hell, Steve guessed, and the man must read those.
“You’re in so much trouble,” Tony replied with a teasing smile.  “I’m going to have to talk to Rhodey.  He should hear it first. Well, after you.  I’m shutting down SI’s weapons division.  At least until I get a handle on all this.  They were using my stuff, Steve.  It literally had my name on it.”
“Right, well, anyway, that was only the one time. And you’re the idiot who stepped between us when Steve was clearly my Omega and we were Bonded,” Tony reminded Fury with a disapproving shake of his head. It was really hard to remember why he shouldn’t throw the man, to be honest. It turned Steve on, whatever he might say, and Tony found it satisfying, but Fury had brought a diaper cake and that was really fucking cute. God, parenting had so many moral quandaries, he thought with a heavy sigh. “Besides, I apologized.”
“I want to keep you safe.  Protect you from the world.  I’ve always wanted that,” Steve said, bringing his hand up to trace the barely there white line that cut across Tony’s check.  “But that’s not how you were made, is it?  Not what you were built for.  A safe life.  You never were.  You were always, well.  More.  More than anyone I ever met.  Someone who could handle being with me. That’s what I told myself.  I didn’t get it, not then.”
Happiness echoed ten times over, Tony thought to himself, looking down at their joined hands, before lifting his eyes back to Steve.
“Um, you did hear about the whole metal suit, flying out of a cave full of terrorists thing, right?  So, yeah, no.  Not so big on the giving up,” Tony acknowledged with a deprecating smile.   “One of my few finer points that doesn’t involve a Swiss bank account.”
“Yeah.  Yeah, something like that,” Tony acknowledged with a tight smile that he felt slowly melt into something a little softer.  “People usually have trouble with that,” Tony said.  “Want me to be that guy all the time.”
Come to me, Steve thought to himself, taking a bracing breath. He wasn’t sure what answer he might find behind the door, but it had to offer some kind of explanation for what was happening to him. It just
“You name it,” Steve said with a light laugh.  “Had all kinds of things wrong with me.  Nothing serious, don’t worry.  Just enough to keep me in bed more often than not.”
“All about the material things with you,” Tony teased, winding his arms tighter around Steve’s waist and indulging himself by burying his head into the crook of Steve’s neck.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked again.  His hands moved over Tony’s face and head, then down his arms and sides, like he was checking for injuries.  Maybe he was, Tony didn’t know.
“Jesus, did you two stay up braiding each other’s hair?” Steve demanded with a flash of annoyance before stomping down the building’s front steps and heading off towards the bus stop.
“It’s ok,” he heard Tony say, as if from the end of tunnel.  It wasn’t exactly what he wanted to hear from Tony.  But it was enough.  He nodded, gripping Tony’s hand as tight as he dared, and the SHIELD team went back to work.  It still hurt like hell, his body trying to fight their efforts the whole time, but it was somehow better than before, Tony’s presence enough of a touchstone to allow Steve to sit there calmly and let them finish.  When they finished and he said he still wanted to go to the debriefing, Tony had looked at him incredulously.  Steve didn’t see any reason to put it off.  His arm was taped, he was fine.  By the morning, he’d be practically good as new.
“The Gift sustains a mate.  Heals, as you have seen. But...more.  I don’t know how to say it in your language.  It is affirming. Connection. It makes us…” the alien broke off, shaking his head, a crease of frustration forming at his brow.
,” Tony replied with a slight shrug.  “Bunch of bad guys tried to beat him up in an alley.  He needs, like, I don’t know, an icepack or something.”
“How very dull of him,” the King remarked.  “As my assistant for the evening appears to already be engaged, I shall begin without you.  No, no, continue your game,” the King said quickly when Cam started to get up from his chair.  “It is a good exercise in humility.  Or, so I’ve heard.  On your next move, put your Rook there, in front of your King,” Tony told Cam.
“I didn’t give you leave to go,” Lady Bain said, tightening her grip.  “Tony always was far too soft with his slaves,” she added in a voice that made Steve’s stomach curdle.  “You see what happens, Almec? I’ve told him many times that he needs to have a firmer hand,” she said, then smiled, wolflike.  “Tony always did enjoy a firmer hand, you’d think he would have learned how to handle himself by now.”
“Good,” Zola remarked, sounding pleased.  “I suspect your mouth will be quite too busy tonight to speak out of turn, but should the occasion present itself, I trust you have learned the benefits of controlling your tongue?  What was that?” Zola said, when Steve didn’t answer.
“I just…I guess I figured you would rather me handle that for you. That’s why I’m asking.  So I would know how you wanted to vote,” Steve explained, giving Tony a somewhat baffled look.
Had he said it? He couldn’t remember.  He remembered Tony’s mouth and hands and the feel of the crown, cold, then warm, pressing into the base of his skull as Tony took him, everything silent save for their ragged, mingled breaths, faint brushes of flesh and the words Tony whispered into Steve’s skin.  Steve’s gaze dropped down, and he scanned the wall again.  The shift change was almost done.  The sun was low, still bright, but starting to dip towards the horizon.  Soon, it would be dark. The castle gates would close.  The guards would be watchful, but less so, with the gates shut.  It was possible.  For him, at least.
“Well,” Tony began loudly, before Clint could say anything.  “The good news is that they were definitely
“Make him laugh.  He doesn’t do that so much anymore.  Not since you, really.  I thought it was the war, but…Make him feel like he’s part of something important.  He needs that.  Let him help you.  Talk to him, not to…not to convince him.  Just to talk to him,” Barnes said quietly, biting his lip.  “Me off with Nat.  He doesn’t have anyone.  Not like he used to, when it was the two of us.  Not like over there, where we had our guys, you know?  Then you get back here, and it’s all doctors and therapists, and they all just talk at you, not to you, like you’re this problem to be fixed so they can move on to the next one.  Talk to him about, you know, stuff that…makes him happy.”
“So, it’s some kind of coma?” Steve asked, turning to give Bruce a frustrated look before looking back through the glass window where Tony lay in a hospital bed, hooked up to all kinds of machines, most of which Steve didn’t recognize.  One he did, though.  Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing. That was what Tony called it.  Steve privately thought the name had been just Tony’s clever way of downplaying just how much time and energy Tony had invested in the idea of creating alternative memories, though he’d never said as much to Tony.
“You should come to my desert more often, you see?” the Ul huffed, sucking lightly at the tip of the pipe. “We have a great many treasures here, you will find.”
Honestly, Steve expected Shellhead to have appeared by now.  He usually did, whenever Steve called to him, and even if he was worried that Steve was upset about the night’s events, it wasn’t like him to just ignore Steve, unless…but, no, surely that couldn’t be….though, it wasn’t as if Steve had much experience with anything like that.  Or,
And that was apparently enough, because the next thing Steve knew, Tony was slamming into him, burying himself fully, and it did hurt at first, for a moment, as his body struggled to accommodate the invasion, but then the
I can’t help it, I was away, he thought bleakly, then pushed that thought into its own empty drawer.
“Okay, name one time when I have not wanted you to take advantage of me! When has that happened? Never, that’s when! Please, for the love of all things good and holy, take advantage of me,” Tony pleaded. “You idiot,” he finished fondly.
He quickly cleaned himself up and was zipping up his pants when someone knocked on the door. His head snapped around in surprise, though he supposed he should have expected that. If someone taps out, obviously, management knows about it. Can’t exactly be a good thing.
I wouldn’t let him go, Tony thought, the certainty of the knowledge almost calming in a strange way.  He almost had the words then, in that moment, to tell Steve what he meant to him, that he could never, ever leave Steve behind because Steve was a part of him, not something he could carve out, piecemeal, and put aside with other regrets and might-have-beens.   He almost had it, but then the words slipped away, slipped into something deeper, some
“Hey, man, I said we should leave you alone!” Mitchell pleaded, throwing his hands up in front of him.
For the first time since the limo, Steve wanted to bolt. This was such an impossibly bad idea. It all seemed so clear now, seeing Stark all dressed up for their ‘date,’ such as it was. He shouldn’t care, he supposed. At this point, it seemed vaguely pointless to give a shit, but he was going to walk out into the hotel’s lobby with this man and become a punchline, and that was never something he’d imagined he would become. Maybe he shouldn’t care, but there it was, pricking low in his stomach, making it sour and churn while he fidgeted under Stark’s gaze. Tell him you can’t do this, Steve thought. Tell him you want out. Walk away. The ways this is not your problem are many and varied. Just walk away.
“See if it says, “A hundred bucks if you want this thing back,” before you get all twitterpated there, Thumper,” Rhodey warned.
.  How do I go out into the light again without something?  Something between me and that happening again?  No answer came to him, not this thousandth time he asked any more than it had the first, lying there in that hospital, still tasting the grit of sand in his mouth while Steve cradled him in his arms and told him this terrifying thing Tony made burned like a star.
“So…pizza?” Tony tried.  “Pizza’s good with me. You still feel like movie?  Try to contain your excitement.”  The car was turning off the main road onto their gravel-covered dirt driveway, the tires making a rushing crackling sound as they did.
“Come on,” Tony urged, pulling Steve by the arm towards the shower.  The glass door was grayed out with steam, and clicked as Tony pulled it open, letting a rush of warm air, heavy with condensation, billow into the room.
Tony traced the jagged edge of leather where shreds of thread and material dangled haphazardly and realized with a jolt that Steve hadn’t had anything sharp to use.  He rubbed his thumb over it and thought of logs torn apart, a scrape of a shocked, vaguely embarrassed laugh escaping him.  Reading way too much into a little aggressive first aid there, Stark, he thought to himself, though a frown deepened his face as he ran his thumb over the torn piece of dark blue.
Oh, right.   Steve had forgotten that.   His head couldn’t seem to do anything except conjure the image of being lain across Tony’s lap for some moment of rebellion, waiting for the strike to fall with a terrible, twisting arousal mixed with anticipation burning its way through his body.  He didn’t want that.  He didn’t want to want that. It couldn’t be right, to feel this way.  Tony placed his hand on the side of Steve’s face and held him there, thumb moving up and down over Steve’s cheek.  Steve’s eyes fluttered as the world went hazy and out of focus for a moment, and he leaned against Tony’s hand, seeking an equilibrium that escaped him.
“Oh. My. God. Tony—you---you—how—what—“ Pepper stuttered. “You bonded?  Where did you even find an Omega?  If this is some SHIELD plot, Tony, there are ways, I mean, it isn’t unheard of, though no one talks about it, but they can’t just do something like this…”
It was nearly lunch by the time they arrived in a windswept valley of hard sand that sank down between larger dunes some distance apart. In the far distance mountains made of rock and little else rose up out of the desert. There waited more soldiers and their tents, a corral of camels and the Jerak’ho itself with the cannon’s massive bulk sitting atop a thick, wooden sledge of some kind that seemed designed to be pulled over the sand.
“No coddling,” Tony said, raising his hands up in a placating gesture.  “I enjoyed it, too.  No, really, I did,” he assured at Steve’s skeptical look.
“Sir,” JARVIS cut in. “The name of the man you had me search for is Henry Camp, an Army Master Sergeant currently on loan to SHIELD,” JARVIS informed him through the HUD.  Huh.  Why had he had wanted to know that?  He honestly couldn’t recall, but there was a fissure of something that rippled through him at JARVIS’s pronouncement.
Tony was smart, funny and incredibly kind.  The first two weren’t surprises, but the latter did catch Steve a bit off-guard, though he wasn't sure it really should have.  Tony was kind, and he made Steve feel...special.  Important. Like he mattered.
The alarms fell silent, which turned out to be almost worse in a way, because now Tony could hear the bangs and shrieks coming from the ship in long, shuddering heaves.  Last gasps, Tony thought resignedly, then cracked open one of the panels in front of him and started tugging wires out. If JARVIS couldn’t reboot the emergency systems, he still might be able to spare a bit of power for the oxygen filtration system if he rerouted a few things.
“It wasn’t--it wasn’t you.  Not really.  I just…I didn’t know how to deal with you…being you,” Steve admitted after a short pause while the computer finished installing its upgrades and faded to black.  “The CEO was there, and you were talking about all that investment stuff, and I was…holding a mop.  I’m not embarrassed by what I do,” Steve said quickly, then dropped his gaze to where the laptop screen was cycling through the various updates.  “I guess, I’m worried maybe you are.”
“A life of leisure,” Cam replied in an arch imitation of the matronly Lady Devon, then dropped to the divan in a swoon, grinning up at Steve and Tony while he dug through the bag of finds Tony had given him.
They made it back to their shared bedroll, and Tony shifted Steve’s head onto his chest, just below the metal disc, running his hands through Steve’s hair in a rhythmic motion. Steve surprised himself by promptly falling back to sleep, only waking when Bruce put his pot to boil over the fire.  There wasn’t much ground to cover before they reached Brookland, so they could afford a few extra moments this morning, though Steve woke to a kind of anxious need to hurry, if only to get it over with that much sooner, and he wasn’t the only one who seemed to feel that way.
Peggy’s reflection leaned into the window, and he stared at her that way for a moment.   It was easier, somehow, to look at her—really
“Sir Archer has a poor history with these noble steeds,” Thor agreed readily from behind them. “His touch seems to drive the beasts to frenzy.  I would not advise taking that bet, Captain.”
“Your Highness,” Steve said, bowing his head.  Cam jumped up and pumped his fist in the air with a loud, exhilarated whoop, then started clapping enthusiastically, though he slowed and looked around, somewhat awkwardly, when he realized the rest of the room had gone silent.
“Goodbye, Tony,” Steve said again, opening the study door, one hand catching on the frame. He looked back over his shoulder at where Tony leaned against the desk, arms crossed in front of him, a hard-to-read look in his eyes.
Tony was just selfish enough not to let it stop him, wanted one more night with Steve, but then he’d asked for that little bit more, asked Steve to stay.  Stupid. Stay with him and not go back to…well.  Not go back.  Happy had said that the…guy…Bucky, hadn’t wanted Steve to go, and of course not.  Could you blame him?  Hell, Tony’d wanted to bar the door the next morning.
“Yeah, I kinda got that first part.   Tony Stark, huh?  Wow.  Hey, nice to meet you both,” Wilson said, extending a hand to shake first Tony’s, then Rhodey’s.  “You, ah, you know Steve from the Army?”
He was drifting.  Numbers ran through the edges of his brain, but none of them meant anything.  The smell of Steve’s skin meant something.  The heady musk of Steve’s scent that leeched into Tony’s pores, that meant something.  The warmth of Steve’s body coiled around him, keeping him safe, taking care of him, that meant something. The rest…it was all passing through his head in a fog, slipping in and out, too hard to catch.
“Oh, fuck that, Rogers, you little twerp,” Bucky grimaced, shaking his head and wiping surreptitiously at his eyes.  “I’m just… I’m saying you--maybe you needed someone, and that asshat saw that, and then suddenly he’s into everything you do.  Who you see, who you talk to, where you live, where you work, and you’re quitting school, and it’s--God, Steve, I didn’t know what to do,” Bucky finished, sucking in a harsh breath.  “Sam said we needed to wait until you got to a place you were ready to listen, which I’m really hoping is now, Steve, I really am.  Of course, Sam
“So, Captain, what do you think?” she asked in a polite way that clearly meant that his opinion wasn’t actually wanted.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve said, somewhat sullenly.  “I,” he sighed, grimacing, then closed his eyes and shook his head. A small smile formed.  “I don’t know what to say, I guess.  But, I mean it. Thank you.”
“Well….” Steve said, the word a drawl.  He looked Tony up and down with exaggerated appraisal.  “I think we might be able to work something out…”
“And I you,” Steve responded softly, watching his breath ruffle the hair curling down Tony’s forehead. “You are well?”
He pulled the car door open and shrugged into his seat, hunching down and glancing up out of the frosted windshield. He could go back up. No, he couldn't, he'd promised Rhodey, and there was a lawyer between him and Steve now, anyway. And if he did, he knew full well that Rhodey was more right than he wanted to admit. Walking away now was threading the eye of the needle as it was. If he went back up there, he wasn't going to just be able to leave.
Tony seemed to always know what he wanted, what he needed, even when Steve didn’t, and for now, that was oddly comforting, to just put himself in Tony’s hands.  There was always so much to think about.  So many decisions to make. So many responsibilities to bear. But, not this, he remembered thinking as he stood in Tony’s bedchamber with Tony supporting him on legs that felt like they were made of jelly. This could be Tony’s.  As soon as he thought it, his body seemed to agree.  His muscles loosened, and he slumped a little against Tony, earning a soft grunt.
Tony’s hands cupped Steve’s ass and lifted, changing the angle of his thrusts. He plunged deep, and suddenly, pleasure unlike anything Steve had ever known burst inside of him.  He let out a silent scream, all the breath leaving him in an instant.  Tony growled, pleased, and hummed lowly as he pulled all the way out and pushed in again, finding the same spot deep inside Steve just as Steve crested the wave of pleasure from the first time.
Tony pulled the belt tight around his waist, then paused, half-turning back towards where Steve watched him from the bed. “In the morning, we will continue as if this conversation never happened. I will forget it. So shall you. We will never speak of this again. It will be as it was.” Steve opened his mouth, words failing him, though he supposed he shouldn’t be so surprised. “I will give you this chance—this
“His sister is the witch, yes?” Cam said, eyes going wide with some combination of fear and delight.
Tony nearly dropped the plate, ending up having to catch a spiral sandwich with the side of the tongs before it rolled off the edge.  He turned and headed for the ballroom doors, cutting through the crowd so fast he almost crashed into Coulson, who opened his mouth to say something, but whatever it was ended up lost to the music and buzz of the crowd as Tony rushed past him.
“Oh, come on!” Stern pleaded to the heavens, tossing his hands in the air. “That guy isn’t Stark’s husband. For crying out loud, Stark just picked him up at the---at some establishment. He’s just some fuck boy Stark rented for the ni—ow!!! Ewasshl!“ Stern shouted, one hand flying to his nose as he tipped his head back to stop the flow of blood.
