“I can be quick,” Dean said, grinning.
Sam opened his mouth.  Closed it.  And then he burst out laughing at the top of his lungs.
“Out,” Cas said, throwing open the passenger side door and climbing out.
“Great,” Dean says.  He hands Castiel the bottle, and Castiel takes another, longer drink.  “Atta boy.  Can you still get drunk?”
“Look, man,” Dean says, “it’s payday tomorrow, right?  So I’ll get you back then.  Just one more.”
“But it’s the first time you’ve done it,” Cas said.  His voice was starting to get more gravelly, like it did before he came, and Dean was starting to wonder if
“For who?  You don’t eat!”
“Yeah, I know, but staring is like - like the
“I lied.  I do know what Tinder is,” Cas said, and gave Dean the slyest smirk he’d ever seen cross that angelic face.  “But after a few uses, I realized there was only one person I would ‘swipe right’ for, and they are not on the app.”
“Dean,” he says, and Dean leans against him and gasps for air.
“My understanding was that that isn’t something to be proud of,” Cas said.
Dean stared at him.  He was grasping at straws, but he didn’t know how to stop.  “Who?”
Dean opened his mouth and closed it and opened it again.  “You’re on
“About what?”
Sam’s eyes widened.  “You’re kidding me.”
It’s a cruel question and Castiel knows it.  Dean is less in touch with what he wants than any human Castiel has ever observed.
“What?” Dean says, digging in his pocket for the keys.
“Human sexuality is very confusing.”
Castiel looks between Dean, who looks mutinous, and Sam, who looks insistent.  He hands over the keys.
“It’s a goddamn
"Well, Dean says a lot of things," Sam says.  "Look, Cas, I'm not trying to get in the middle - "
“Yeah I’m sure,” Dean snaps, taking a swig of beer.  “I don't need anything from you, Cas.  You hear me?”
“Whatever,” Chelsea says, shooting Sam a weird look and pressing through the crowd.
" - but I think you and Dean, like, have to
"Well, yeah he - Cas," Sam says.  "Last night.  Was that - did that - you were okay with that?"
“Dude, you cannot be impressed by that, you used to be able to freakin’ fly.”
“Influencers,” Sam said significantly.
, after he actually did something about it, he pulled back from Cas’s lips and asked, “So wait, does that mean you
you want?”
“I,” Dean began, and then gave up because it was too stupid to even comment on.
“Sure, but what’s next, are you going to be signing up for Tinder?”
The silence hangs.  Castiel thinks that, perhaps, things between them can go back to normal, or as normal as they ever are.
who’d hung the moon and he knew damn well it wasn’t Dean.
“I don’t know, man.  Some people just want to watch the world burn.”
“You’re… frustrated.”
thing, I mean I don't know for
Dean stuck his head back in the car.  “Scuse me?”
“What?” Castiel asks.
“Sorry, the guy who doesn’t need the calories definitely doesn’t get to pick the place.  We’re going to Jimbo’s or whatever it’s called.”
“Holy - what?  Whaddya mean, they can’t - ”
"Because Dean's an asshole," Sam said.
That sneaky son of a bitch.
“And Dean?”  Sam grinned.  “Try not to fuck this up.”
“Just so you can get what you need, pal.  Don’t worry about it.”
“I’m fine.”
“That’s what I thought,” Dean said, and burrowed into his pillow.
The Winchesters are still three hours away when Castiel hunts the changeling down to a school gymnasium and kills it with his blade before it can snatch the girl it was after, but for reasons he decides not to evaluate too closely he waits to tell them it’s already done until they call him from twenty minutes out of town.  “What do you mean, done?” Dean barks.
The humans take off, and there’s a commotion down the hall - Castiel hears a crack and a scream, the sizzle of holy water hitting a demon, a muffled grunt that sounds like Sam - and he loses a second trying to sense how many there are, trying to figure out if Sam needs him.
“Where were you?”
Castiel stared at him blankly.  “We have not changed location.”
Castiel meets them in Tennessee to help investigate the mysterious deaths, and they discover a small coven living in an apartment building not far from the river.  The leader of the coven is inexperienced, her followers barely out of their teens, and after the one in charge takes a hostage and Dean is forced to kill her, the others beg forgiveness and pile their hex bags and books for the Winchesters to burn.  It’s open and shut, by their standards, and Castiel suspects fairly quickly that Sam did not actually think Castiel was necessary for this particular hunt, a suspicion strengthened when Sam says cheerfully, “Well, now that that’s taken care of, should we get dinner?”  Dean shrugs like he doesn’t care either way, but they leave their cars at the motel and walk to a bar.
to sit outside all night?”
“But why not compose it themselves?” Cas asked.  “Or if nobody reads it anyway, why put anything in the cards in the first place?”
, but it’s such an unusual emotion to see on Dean that he almost misses it.
of the car.”
Dean’s in the Impala immediately, and Castiel exchanges one last glance with Sam before he goes around the car and gets into the passenger side.  Dean waits until Sam’s in the other car before he pulls away from the curb sharply and heads back toward the highway.
a thing.  Like an actual thing.  Right?"
Sam’s eyes follow him and then dart back to Castiel.  “Cas - ”
“A month?  What the hell are you talking about?” Dean snapped.  “Sammy - ”
“Dude, I don’t know.  I’m not defending humanity on this one.”
Cas cleaned them up - all except Baby, who he was under strict instructions never to touch with his mojo without
Castiel worries as they stand in the room, lit only by the moon and the cheap bulbs of the motel hallway, that moving to a second location has broken the spell.  Dean isn’t even looking at him, he’s looking around the room, at the table, the chairs, the one large king bed, and Castiel regrets ever getting off the cold cement ground -
Cas stared at him like
“Cas - ”
When Dean comes back with the whiskey, Sam is in the shower.  Dean is soaked again, wet from his trek to the liquor store in the rain, and Castiel stares down at the table while Dean shucks his jacket and jeans and puts on dry ones.  He feels strange, these days, when they are on a case and he has nowhere to go; the Winchesters never make him feel like he shouldn't be there, sharing their space, but he sometimes worries that his welcome is more of a formality than a feeling.
talking about?” Sam snaps.
Dean licked his lips.  “Really?”
“I don’t love the phrasing, but yeah.  It’s a no-go.”
“Hoo, boy.  You’re something, you know that?” he says, his eyes bright.  “Honestly, what the fuck would I do without you?”
“Where else,” Cas said, looking completely serious, “would I possibly want to go?”
Dean huffed a laugh.  “You see any cabs around here, Cas?  C’mon, we’ll just make him listen to Zep the whole way back.”
Cas considered it.  “That seems dangerous.”
“A what?” the first guy says, confused.
“Come on, Dean, we’re not doing anything else,” Sam says.
“Were you expecting something more interesting?”
“I’m not on Instagram,” Dean said.  “And
Dean put down his coffee and shouldered up next to Cas and the boxes.  “Hang on, don’t tell me you got shit delivered to the
There was a long moment of silence during which Dean wondered if he’d finally found something Cas wasn’t down to try.  And then -
“Dean, I don’t really care what
“I mean we treat each other like shit,” Dean says.  “And then most of the time you leave.  And then you come back, and I know it's because I tell you I need you, and it's like, when it’s the job, heaven and hell and all that, yeah, I'm gonna keep asking, but with - with two people, with
kind of fun to just freaking go for it, messy and fast and a little too rough.
"Did you know there are entire instagram accounts devoted only to pictures of macarons?"
Cas slid a hand under Dean’s shirt, brushed the tips of his fingers underneath Dean’s waistband.  Dean shuddered; it would tickle, under other circumstances, but under these circumstances it just made him twist his hands in Castiel’s coat and pull him closer.
Dean stared at him.  “Okay.  That’s - okay.”
Dean’s eyes widen slightly.  “Cas doesn’t - Cas doesn’t care,” he says, recovering quickly.  “Why would Cas - you don’t care, Cas, right?”
“What’d you think of that?” Dean said, grinning up at him and letting his tongue dart to lick at the corner of his lip.
“Then I figured you'd tell me.”
“Dean, you’ve barely said two words to him in weeks.”
They aren't
“I wouldn’t have any idea what to get,” said Cas, suddenly all hapless and angelic.

But Cas, the son of a bitch, pulled off and said, roughly, “Pull over.”

?” Castiel says.  “I’m already sitting on the ground in the rain, must I be silent too?”
“Are you serious?” Sam said.  “Like, actually serious?”
Dean shoved half a slice of toast in his mouth.  “I mean, I wasn’t exactly complaining, man.  But yeah, humans gotta sleep.  You know that.”
“Yeah, you’d come home with a handful of hilarious sympathy cards and nothing else,” Dean muttered.
“The sympathy cards are rarely funny,” Cas said solemnly.  “The
“Cas,” Dean says, and there’s something in his voice that Castiel
you, man?” Sam says.
.  You can’t just - ”
It’s a short walk to the mostly abandoned office complex down the road, and Castiel’s not surprised it’s close to the hunting grounds - this operation clearly isn’t the work of one of Hell’s top talents - and he watches from the shadows as Dean follows the man into the farthest office, ignoring the “For Lease” sign hanging near the glass door.
“They deliver in two days, Dean.  Two days!  Anything you want!”
“Solve?” Dean said.  “What do you - ”
“And not just one,” Cas said, frowning at his phone.  “
“Not easily enough,” Castiel grumbles.
And then Cas tapped two fingers to Dean’s forehead and Dean felt a ribbon of heat run straight through him, straight - oh.  Straight to his dick.
“It’s not freaking me out,” Dean said.  “Nobody’s freaked out.”
but - look, he didn't say
"He said he didn't need me," Castiel says.  He feels uncertain, like he's stepped to the edge of a cliff and isn't sure he'd be able to fly if he stepped off.  "That's all he said."
“Well, now that I can’t, it’s very convenient,” Cas said primly.  He opened another box.  “Ah ha!  The chip clips!”
Castiel knows that Sam doesn't like how much his brother drinks, is unimpressed when he spots the emptying bottles around the bunker and their various motel rooms.  Sam doesn't usually comment on it directly, just glares passive-aggressively and rolls his eyes and, hypocritically in Castiel's opinion, often joins his brother around the bottle when the mood strikes.  Castiel doesn't actually see much difference between Dean when he's drinking and when he's sober, which he understands is a textbook sign of functional alcoholism, and he knows that means that Dean doesn't necessarily
Dean runs a hand through his hair.  “Cas, about the woman from the bar - you know that didn’t mean anything, right?  I was just - I was being - “
Dean seems annoyed when he and Sam join Castiel at his table, but he takes the beer and drinks half of it in a huge gulp that leaves Sam rolling his eyes.  “I’m just pissed I didn’t get to kill it,” he explains when Castiel raises his eyebrows.
“If you didn’t buy so much shit, you wouldn’t have to deal with so many boxes,” Dean said, very reasonably in his opinion.

before.
“What?  It’s dinner time!  There was that bar off the highway.”
“What the fuck are you talking about?” Dean says.  “Chelsea, you wanna wait out front?  Let me talk to my brother for a second.”
“Yes, but you and Sam do,” Cas pointed out.  “And I’ll have a beer.  Louisa’s Tavern has a highly regarded selection of microbrews.”
“Well, thank you for your financial contribution to the household,” Dean muttered.  “What name did you even use to - nevermind, I don’t care.  Does this mean you’re going to take over the grocery shopping?”
“You can do a favor for a friend of mine,” the man says, nodding toward the door.  “He’s just around the block.  Won’t take more than a minute.  We’ll have another drink, even.”
"You know I’m not an expert at the implications behind colloquialisms, but yes, I believe so," Castiel says, a little bit helplessly.
what's going on right now, but I don’t know that talking to Dean is going to change that," Castiel says tiredly.  He's
“It’s not even remotely comparable to reading minds,” Castiel says, frowning.
“You’re overthinking it, man,” Dean said, not for the first time.  “People don’t actually want to say that shit to each other.  And nobody reads it either.  It’s just generic bullshit.”
,” Dean snapped as soon as the car door shut behind Cas.
, Cas.  I can’t believe you’re - can’t believe you said yes, Cas, I can’t - ”
“Dean,” Castiel says, “if this is something you need, we can - ”
“Screw you,” Dean said, because that was the safest answer.  He finished filling the gas tank without a word, torn between being grumpy and relieved, and ignored Sam’s little smirk from where he was leaning against the car looking at his phone.
“It’s unbelievable that they make recycling so time intensive,” Cas said, shooting a dark look at the overflowing bin.
If this had been a normal hook up, back in the days when he did that kind of thing all the time, Dean would be starting to plan his departure - maybe throw out, “I’d love to stay, but I got work in the morning”, or maybe settling in for a quick nap before sneaking out the door in the middle of the night - but this was
“Huh.  I mean, he seems - I don’t know.  Look, I’m sure it’s nothing, but - ”
“So I’m gonna go show her the Impala,” Dean says, winking at her.  “I mean, we’ll probably focus on a few

This, Dean had been practicing; it was still kinda new, doing it in the daylight, and sober, and with somebody he hadn’t just met, but he was getting used to it.  And Cas fucking
werewolves aren’t that hard to find; Dean kills one with a silver bullet and Castiel impales the other on his angel blade, and the victims’ families won’t know what killed their loved ones but they won’t hurt anyone again.  They dispose of the bodies and drive in a satisfied post-hunt silence the hour and a half back to where they left Castiel’s car across the state line, and when Castiel climbs out of the back seat Dean says, “We’ll call you if anything comes up, all right?”
“It was twenty bucks,” Sam said, “and that bet was
Castiel knows Dean’s soul, and so he knows better than anyone - certainly better than Dean himself - that that soul is bound up in a very small number of central driving needs: the need to be useful; the need to help people in an effort to chip away at the bottomless pit of guilt and shame that dominates his psyche; the need, above
And now Sam had picked the worst freaking car to steal in all of goddamn Arkansas and Dean had to go pick him up.  He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “All right.  All right.  We’re on our way.”
“Don’t,” Castiel says instantly.  “Sam.  Please don’t.”
“Yeah, hiring seems like a real bitch,” Dean says, and then the demon flings him up against the wall.
Dean’s hips jerked up of their own accord.  “Oh, you’re an
It was only a minute later, maybe, when Cas pushed at his shoulder urgently, and Dean released him with a wet

“I haven’t left Earth in a while, Dean, you know that.  What - ”
“Unless it was all just ‘talk’,” Cas said, giving him the goddamn air quotes, and Dean was
, but sure,” Dean said, and he wanted to kiss him, was just about to stand up and do exactly that, when he heard the turn of a key in a lock.
Cas looked confused for a second, and then his face went slack and he
“Don’t ever do that again,” he said while he stripped Cas’s jacket and coat off, ran his fingers down the buttons of Cas’s shirt.  “Don’t ever, ever - ”
“An ass,” Castiel finishes.
“Oh,” Dean said.  “Okay.”
"I don't know," Dean says.
Later, after Dean figured out what he meant by that, and even
There’s a long silence.  Dean signals, gets off the highway, pulls into the motel parking lot.  The Continental pulls in behind them and drives to the other side of the lot, and they sit quietly and watch while Sam gets out of the car and turns the key in the lock, glances back at the Impala and then closes the motel door behind him.
Dean’s eyes go wide with surprise and then laughter, and Sam snorts, because this is a familiar debate; Dean genuinely thinks Return of the Jedi is a good movie, and Sam is fond of giving him a hard time about it.  Castiel thinks that sometimes the Winchesters forget that he knows about their jokes, keeps track of the things they care about.  He wonders how often they think of him as their friend, and how often they think of him as all the other things he is or has ever been.
“They can’t see us,” Cas said, biting Dean’s lower lip.
?” Sam said, rolling his eyes.
Sam closes his computer eventually, gets into bed and puts a pillow over his head, and Castiel glances at the window.  On these occasions, when the Winchesters have to sleep and Castiel doesn't have anything to do, he often drives around, visits crime scenes and searches for omens, but tonight he has no car of his own and would have to do it on foot, and it's freezing and raining and he realizes he doesn't
“Cas, come on, he’s being a dick!” Sam says.
that Dean writhed.  “Cas,” he breathed, “Cas, please, I - ”
Dean came into his hand with a cut-off groan.
“But why YouTube comments?  Wouldn’t there be more effective ways to air grievances to larger audiences?” questioned Cas, the paragon of logic.
“You don’t seem to mind it too much,” Dean said, slithering down off the side of the bed to kneel between Cas’s legs.
“Move?” he asks.
“He’s not inserting himself,” Castiel says irritably.  “It’s Sam.  He’s part of everything to do with you.  And he’s my friend too, you know.”
“Sam,” Cas said urgently, “do you recall my AppleID password?”
“So you went to buy some?”
It wasn’t that Dean wasn’t
Castiel considers not calling back, but ultimately realizes that he will, of course, speak to Sam again at some point, so there's not much point putting it off.  "Cas!" Sam says after five rings, and he's a little winded.  "Sorry, I just had to go outside the bunker, Dean was - anyway.  How's it going?"
“We gotta keep educating you on comedy if you think Hallmark cards are the height of the art form,” Dean said, flashing a smile at the cashier.
Sam rolls his eyes and asks Castiel about the end of the hunt, tells him about a mother changeling they’d hunted years ago; Dean has told him the story before but he listens attentively, and then Sam talks about a zombie they hunted a few months ago in Arkansas, a couple of vetalas they tracked to Minneapolis.  Sam glances at the bar a couple of times, but Castiel’s back is to it, and so he doesn’t notice anything until Sam jerks his head up, looking startled, and says, “Dean.”
“I said I’m fine,” Dean snaps.  “Why are you being like this?”
“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Sam,” Dean says finally, his voice dangerously quiet.

“Oh, can I have some?”

“Do you have your Aldi rewards card, sir?” she asked politely.
No one says anything for a minute.  Dean stares down at his hand, still gripping the driver’s side door.  Castiel can tell Sam is glaring, but he can’t look away from the breath puffing out of Dean’s mouth and turning to condensation in the brisk night air.
, Dean might call it.
“You’re full of shit, Cas,” Dean says.  “No taste.  They didn’t raise you right upstairs.”
“You’re a dead man,” Dean says, pointing at Sam, and Castiel smiles into his beer.
“Wow.  There’s that angelic intellect.  Smartest kid in the garrison, right?”
“Whatever,” Dean says.
Cas stood next to the bed, staring down at him.  “Hello, Dean.”
“You have before,” Dean said, and immediately realized he sounded like a whiny freaking baby.  “Look, it doesn’t matter - ”
“Hey, Cas,” Sam says.  “What’s going on?”
“Why don’t you come with me and we’ll call it even,” the man says.
?” Dean breathed when he felt like he could talk again.
“Any… ice?”
aggressive considering ten seconds ago Dean had been standing there alone trying to get some ice but he definitely wasn’t going to complain.  Cas was basically fucking his mouth, his hands pinning Dean’s hips against the brick wall of the motel like he was trying to devour him, maybe rough him up a little, which was new.  Actually, Cas seemed to be trying out something new every time they did this, which wasn’t that many times but Dean could already tell he’d never get tired of the variety.
“Dean,” Cas said, his eyes blown dark, just a ring of blue around the edges, his hair a mess and his lips swollen and he was

“Like Lucifer,” Cas said seriously.
“It was me they were interested in.”
"What do you want?" Dean asks, at a red light.

Dean felt like his brain had melted out of his ears.  “Cas.  That was just - that was just something you
“You want to walk home?” Dean barks at his brother.
But Castiel isn’t listening, not when Dean’s eyes are wide and he can’t draw breath, and he breaks the demon’s hold and raises his blade, drives it through the demon’s back cleanly and watches the light burst from his eyes.

“Good,” Sam repeats with an amused smile.  “Hey, Dean told me you guys - I mean, not the details or anything, obviously, but - you’re good, right?”
or anything, when it was after sex.  It was just - resting.  Or whatever.  “You gonna stay?”
When it’s over, Dean turns his face away, lets Castiel press his lips to Dean’s throat in the silence, and when Dean gets dressed and leaves he barely pauses at the door, says, “Night, Cas,” and closes it behind him.
Castiel wrenches his knife out of the demon’s back as it releases Dean and jumps forward to catch him before he slumps to the ground.
“Oh,” Dean says.  “I, uh - no.  There’s nothing.  I just - I wanted to see you.”
There was a pensive silence.  Dean remembered the first time he got turned down for sex; it sucked, but Cas would live.  Dean considered falling asleep while Cas went on his personal journey with it.
“Okay,” Dean says, and presses his lips together.  “What the fuck are you
And the irritating part, Dean thought an hour later as he watched Cas take an innocent sip of his microbrew and tried not to have a visible foodgasm from his bacon cheeseburger, was that the son of a bitch was
“Because, let’s see, all

“Sam texted me your time of arrival,” Cas said.  He leaned down and pressed his lips to Dean’s.
“Sam,
“Just kidding, definitely drag me into this - it’s back the other way, you said?”
“Yeah, trust me,” Dean said, and of course Cas did, so he just nodded and let Dean get back to it.
Dean could do a
“As the fucking grave,” Dean said.  “So what, you think it was like, some kind of accidental sex magic or something?”
Sam rolled his eyes.  “Whatever, man.  I’m happy for you and all, just not in my seat, okay?”
“You,” is all he says against Castiel’s lips, and Castiel knows it means

“Little extreme, but sure,” Dean said.  “Why do you care, anyway?”
“I’ve blocked us from view,” Cas said.  “We are invisible to the human eye.”
“That’s not how inflation works,” Sam grumbled.
“You don’t know fuck all about what I want,” Dean snaps.
“Well, it’s gone now,” Sam says.  “Thanks to Cas.  Hey, maybe you don’t need us after all.”
And then he had - well, it was kind of a rude idea, actually, but it
Castiel doesn’t usually sleep, but he does rest at times, when there is no work to be done and no one calling out for him in Heaven or on Earth.  He likes to sit outside, in deep woods or beside rivers, on bustling streets in view of bright neon signs, leaning against his car on country backroads watching headlights going by every half an hour.  Resting is usually pleasant, or at least neutral, but now he finds it aggravating, because the moment he is without purpose or plan all he thinks of is Dean.

And finding nothing.
Cas hummed around his dick, clearly less concerned about the whole “reckless driving” thing than he’d previously claimed.
“Exactly,” Dean says.  “Jesus, Sam, you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.”
The next time he leaves he’s only gone two days before Dean texts him:
Dean waved his arms wildly.  “You!  What are you carrying?”
“Oh,” Cas said, and smiled.
Dean laughs weakly.
Dean pulled off the road just after midnight.
“He likes learning about human stuff,” Sam said, frowning at Dean.  “What’s new about that?”
Cas slid across the bench and ran a hand up Dean’s thigh.  “Keep your eyes on the road.”
Cas tilted his head.  “They do seem to be somewhat influential.  Why is there a teardrop over her - ”
He waits three days and then calls Dean from southern Iowa.
“First of all, his account is probably hooked up to one of

“Do you and Sam give each other these ‘Hallmark cards’?”
to worry about it.”
“What, we can’t take a vacation once in a while?”
By nightfall there's not much to be done - interviews will have to wait til morning, and it will be more useful to revisit all the crime scenes in the daylight - and Dean's barely turned off the car before he jumps out and says, "Going to get supplies."
“I am, dude,” Dean says.  “Look, like I said, payday’s tomorrow so why don’t I give you my number and - ”
“Guess we’ll see you around,” Dean grunts, opening up the door to the Impala.
“It does,” Cas interrupted.  “Dean, I can’t promise that nothing will ever pull me back to Heaven, or into the fray of some fight where you can’t join me, but - ”
“I was thinking we could try something different,” Cas said.  “Louisa’s Tavern is just a mile in the other direction.”
“Sorry not all of us went to

“I want my own room,” Sam said.  “You two are either gonna fight or - whatever - and either way, I’m out.”

that, seeing that he’d turned Cas from sitting-at-the-table-debating-with-Sam-about-translations to dirty-sweaty-desperate so fast.  He’d seen Cas a lot of ways but this was one of the best, strewn out on the bed under him, trenchcoat balled up under him and head thrown back, his lips parted around Dean’s name, and when Cas looked him straight in the eye and repeated it, breathless, “
“I believe so,” Castiel says.  “Thank you, Sam.  For everything.”
More than once, Dean has told Castiel:
It’s not unusual, his thinking about Dean - he is aware that he thinks about Dean a lot, because it is, of course, part of why he rebelled against Heaven - but there is a new twist to the thoughts now, a fresh uncertainty, an
“Well, Cas, we don’t always get what we want,” Dean said, crossing his arms over his chest.  “What the hell were you thinking?”
“When the hell have we taken a vacation?” Sam says.  “Text us the address, Cas, we’ll be there in the morning.”
“We should move,” Castiel says, and Dean blinks at him, his eyes glazed with lust and whiskey.
“It’s very well reviewed on Yelp,” Cas said.
“Jimbo’s Bar has only two stars on Yelp,” Cas said.  “Maybe if you ate at better-reviewed establishments, you wouldn’t have to complain so much about Sam’s indigestion.”
There are demonic omens in Ohio.
"So he actually said that?  He said - this is a one time thing?  Like you and him - just the one time?"
of experience with dudes, but it wasn’t
The floaty feeling eased, but it left a kind of echo warmth in its place.  Cas pulled out but not away, slid to Dean’s side and ran a hand up and down Dean’s chest kinda soothingly, pressed soft kisses to the corner of Dean’s mouth.
“I’m gonna sleep for a week,” Dean said.
“I don’t want you to sit outside in the rain all night, Cas,” Dean says, and when he looks up at Castiel from beneath his eyelashes he looks apologetic and hopeful and miserable.
Dean sighed.  “Can’t you try the car again?”
“There’s always something new to learn,” Cas said wryly as Dean took him into his mouth.
“Just a formality,” the man from the bar says.  They’re in a large conference room, and Castiel can’t see their faces but he can see their feet below the frosted glass, four sets, Dean’s and the man from the bar and two more.  He doesn’t know if either of the others are demons, and he pauses around the corner, listening.
Which is why it makes no sense at all that when Dean pulls away, Castiel absolutely cannot stop himself from leaning forward to kiss him again.
“Really?” Sam said.  “Because since Cas has been hanging out around all the time again, you’ve seemed a little freaked out to me.  You sure there’s nothing you two should talk about?”
“Goddammit it.”
-social media, I just don’t see the
(Later, when he told Sam about it - without any of the details, because Sam had always made it very clear exactly how much of Dean’s sex life he wanted to hear about and it was none - Sam looked at him like he’d grown a second head and it was a vamp.
“We had sex,” Cas said, unhelpfully.
Cas looked tired.  “I was thinking that I was saving your life.”
“Nothing,” they said in unison.
“Cas,” Dean said.  “I said,
“Thank you for speaking to me, Sam,” Castiel says.  “I’ll let you go.”
“Whatever you did,” Dean said.  “Some kind of - what, like a soul thing? Were we
Cas, knew Cas was close too, and he stared into Cas’s eyes and they both came silently and couldn’t,
“No, but what I
“A scholar and a gentleman,” he says, slurring prominently.
“It’s dry here,” Castiel points out.
Sam narrowed his eyes.  “Did you guys have sex in the car?”
“What?” Cas said, like he had no idea what Dean could be referring to.
“Yes,” Castiel says immediately.  He takes the one Dean hands him and watches while Dean gets his own.
Dean’s hands are in Castiel’s hair, and a sharp tug makes Castiel startle; Dean takes the opportunity to press kisses against his jaw down to his neck, sucks a bruise into the space below his ear that he could heal with a tendril of grace if he wanted to, which he does not.  Castiel turns his body more fully toward Dean’s until they’re a tangle of limbs on the ground, Dean’s hands roving over Castiel’s coat, trying to get closer and finding that he can’t.  “Cas,” he says, almost a moan, and Castiel pulls back.
“Huh?” Dean said.
“I apologize for taking away the privilege,” Castiel says dryly.  “I thought it was more important to protect the child.”
They eat their burgers in silence, in the parking lot, watching the rain hit the windshield, and nobody seems happy about it.
“Dean, nobody likes Return of the Jedi,” Sam says.
“I’ll get the next round,” Dean says, standing up abruptly and taking his half-full beer with him.
Cas glanced down, and Dean followed his gaze to - oh.
, suddenly, and Dean became aware all at once that Cas was doing something - he couldn’t tell what it was, but it was
“Out?” Cas repeated, a furrow between his eyebrows.
“Shut up,” Dean snapped, but he got two rooms.  When he threw the second set of keys at his brother, Sam clapped Cas on the shoulder -
want,” Sam says.  He strides up to Castiel and holds out his hand, palm up.  “Cas?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said, and then he was kissing him.
Dean looked around.  The brush here was dense, and you’d have to really crane your neck and have damn good night vision to see anything from the road, but still - you didn’t just pull over and fuck a guy over the hood of your car.  It wasn’t a
Dean looked back down at his mostly crossed-off list. Sam’s side still said:
just didn’t seem to cover it.  “Goddammit, man,” he growled, and then he grabbed Cas by the lapels and kissed him, hard, because anger was so much cleaner than everything else bouncing around in his head.
Dean tilts his head as if to say
“What he said,” Sam said.
“Well, maybe you should have thought of that before you decided you needed that last drink.  Man, drunks are fucking easy, right?” the man says, and one of the others in the room chuckles.
“Jesus fucking - Cas, come on.  I thought it would be easier, is all.”
“I believe they may be doing it for attention,” Cas said gravely.
And then he stood up and walked away, leaving Dean to goggle after him.  “What the hell does that mean?  Cas?
“Me neither,” Sam said.  “Library turned up nothing - no violent deaths in the house going back to when it was built, and nothing suspicious in the whole neighborhood.”
Dean chuckles, knocks his shoulder against Castiel’s.  “Maybe you just gotta keep trying.”
“Fuck,” Dean said, and kissed him.  “Holy shit, you are a freaking maniac, Cas, you are seriously - wait a second.  I don’t - the stuff.  We need.  It’s back at the motel.”
"Right," Sam said.  "You should come home.  I mean back.  You should come back.”
around the word
“Huh?” Dean says.  “Hang on a sec - ”  He crosses the room, turns the music down and then turns back to Castiel.  “What’d you say?”
Dean swiveled to him.  “What did you say?”
“Ain’t that the truth.”  Dean throws back the last of his beer, musses his hair, stands up from the table and shoots a fake grin at Castiel.  “Catch you on the flip side, Cas.”
was the one doing something surprising.  “Those bagels will be 30 cents off.”
“Fuckin’ tell me about it,” Dean says.
That’s when Cas pulled out the big guns.  “Louisa’s Tavern’s speciality is a gourmet bacon cheeseburger.”
“You told me to come as soon as possible,” Castiel says.  “I assume there’s something you need.”
“Where are you even

accounts just for bread.  I’ve been around for the entirety of human existence, and I can tell you that people have never paid as much attention to baked goods as they do now.”
“Oh, come on, I’m good for it,” Dean says cheerfully, and Castiel thinks of the half-empty bottle of whiskey in Dean’s hand while they sat in the rain.
“I’m saying I want you,” Castiel says.  “And I’m angry with you because you didn’t bother to ask me, and with myself because I didn’t try to tell you.”
“What?” Dean barked.  “You fucking kidding me?”
it had been a shitty day and this - an armful of angel, a thigh between his legs, and Cas’s surprisingly skilled mouth on his - was
Castiel knows Dean doesn't know.  He feels bad about asking, so he takes the bottle from Dean’s hand and drinks deeply in an attempt to demonstrate companionship, or maybe apology.  Dean watches him, then takes the bottle back and raises it to his mouth.  He barely even seems to notice the way it tastes, which Castiel knows cannot possibly be a good thing.
Dean rolled the window down huffily.  “What?”
“You’re not usually so easy to sneak up on,” Castiel says.  “What do you need?”
“They’re useful,” Cas said.
By the time his cart was more full with both Dinner Stuff and Sam’s Bullshit, he’d lost Cas.  Cas tended to wander away in stores - sometimes he just left to sit in the car, but more often these days he wandered around and touched a bunch of shit and bought nothing - and Dean had a guess where he’d be.  He pushed the cart back to the middle of the store and up the greeting card aisle to find Cas standing in front of “Birthday Cards - Daughter-in-Law” and smiling to himself like he was reading the goddamn funny pages.
.  Castiel isn't entirely sure what Dean thinks he's saying when he says this, and even less sure he likes the idea of being something on the list of things Dean Winchester needs, because more often than not, the things Dean needs are the very things that destroy him.
Enough of that; Dean would have plenty of time to get mushy about having time to stink up a place when he wasn’t feeling like he coulda been facedown 30 hours ago.  He toed off his shoes and kicked off his jeans and collapsed straight into bed, burying his face in the pillow and starting to feel himself slide toward unconsciousness almost before he’d gotten comfortable.
Castiel thinks of the hours he spent a week ago sitting by a bubbling stream in a park and considering the shape of Dean’s hands.  “Not much.”
“Get two rooms,” Sam said just before Dean shut the door behind him.
Castiel, however, did not seem to know it wasn’t a thing.
.  “The wards were - ”
“Yeah, okay.  What do you want from me, a hug?” Dean said.  “Okay.  I’m glad you’re sticking around.  Good talk.  But you gotta start breaking down your own damn Amazon boxes, man.  They don’t fit in the recycling bin this way.”
“Ew, Dean,” said Sam, who somehow still managed to have the ability to be grossed out even after over three decades of knowing Dean Winchester.
“I don’t read your mind anymore.”
“Uh,” Sam says, narrowing his eyes, “what - ”
“No,” Dean said, just as Cas said, “Yes.”
“Of course it was,” Dean says, but he still looks moody.  “That thing was fucked up.”
.  All
“Yeah, this is a totally normal reaction to a guy offering to pick up the thirty bucks for your gas.”
They don't have any leads on the other werewolf, and they're all a little on edge about it.  Castiel wishes vaguely that he had his own car with him, because being in the Impala at this moment is unpleasant.
Castiel leaned forward and said seriously, “Sam, they have a kale chicken salad that a recent reviewer called ‘transcendent.’”
“ - kind of op you running here?” Dean’s saying, his voice still exaggeratedly slurred.  “What’m I gonna be signing for?”
It was
“It is if it’s on
“Fuck me,” Cas said gravely, “over the hood of the car.”
“Here you go,” Cas said, pulling an 8-pack of toilet paper out of the largest box and holding it out to Dean.
Cas was a nerd sometimes, but Dean had learned he wasn’t
Sam was clearly startled.  “Get what?”
Twenty minutes later, Dean tiptoed back into his room, knees shaking in the good way.  He was trying to be quiet but -
“You ever think about,” Dean says, and stops.  Takes another sip.  “Huh.”
“Would you like me to help you sign up for Instagram, Dean?” Castiel offered.
“Yes,” Cas said, and Dean could feel his hand moving in time with their bodies.  “This wasn’t the - ah - first time you’d thought about this.”
So he goes, instead, with language Dean understands.
“What could you
“The messages are absurd,” Cas said cheerfully, putting the card he was holding back in its slot.  “There’s so much variety!  I can’t believe people just give them to each other and say nothing.  They let strangers do the talking on these sacred occasions.”
“I do,” Cas says, immediately, and Sam chuckles but Dean isn’t paying attention.  He’s looking around the bar like he’s searching for something, and Castiel can’t imagine what it might be - he would sense if there was something demonic or otherwise dangerous in the establishment - until he follows Dean’s gaze to a group of women clustered across the room.
,” Dean said, zipping his aching dick back into his pants and wondering if Cas was about to smite him for the sin of lame dirty talk or being distracted behind the wheel, and followed Cas around to the front of the car.  “What the hell are - ”
but it was saying something.
The door creaks open.  “What the hell, Cas?”
Dean kissed him back, sleepily, and then burrowed back into his pillow.  “I mean it.  I’m sleeping.  I haven’t slept in, like, a million years.”
“Told you,” Dean said as he pressed open-mouth kisses against Cas’s neck.  “
“Anything,” Cas interrupted, and Dean was good at dirty talk and good at pushing people around but when he
“Do you....
"There's no middle to get into," Castiel says.
“Are we really gonna keep pretending I don’t know?” Sam said, raising his eyebrows.
Castiel, who has thought of little else in the intervening weeks, asks, “What happened last month, Dean?”
“He was human at one point,” Sam pointed out.  “He made it on his own for a while, so now he’s interested in all the ins and outs.  It’s a little quirky, sure, but it’s
And then Cas grabbed him, threw him against the still-hot hood, and said, “Do it.”
“I think you’re missing out on the potential for comedy,” Cas said, watching as Dean started to unload the groceries onto the conveyor belt.
“Looks like we got ‘em,” he grunts, and marches out of the room.
“No, I mean why do you care about why people post YouTube comments at all?  Why do you care about any of this stuff?”
“If you say so, buddy,” Dean says, grabbing his jacket and following the man out the door.
“It matters to me,” Castiel says.
It’s a second he regrets when he turns back around and sees the demon, still pinning Dean halfway up the wall, but now with a hand around his throat, squeezing the life out of him with inhuman strength.  Dean is scrabbling at his hands desperately, and when Castiel takes a step forward, the demon throws his other hand out and stops him.
- oh my god,” Sam said.  “How do you not know anything about the online economy?”
"It's raining," Dean says, and Castiel ignores him; humans often say things that do not require responses.
Dean spins around.  “Oh.  Hey.  Didn’t hear you come in.”
“Do you,” Castiel says, slowly, “want
Sam sighs.  "I don't know, man. What do you want?"
: the feel of lips against his, warm and slightly damp, and it shouldn’t seem like anything
“I know that,” Cas said.
.  It felt like he was glowing - like he couldn’t see or think about anything else besides whatever it was that was warming him from the inside, connecting him to Cas like a physical tether in his chest.  Neither of them were talking but it was like he could
“If that means what I think it means, yes,” Cas said, kissing him again.
“I can assure you that you do not,” Cas said.  “It was temporary.”
“Dean, I know how to hotwire a freaking car, it’s dead.  Why can’t you just come pick me up?  I’m not even an hour out of town.”
Here’s how he knew: it was eight and a half, maybe nine minutes back to that taco place just off the highway.  It was a little late for lunch but way too early for dinner, so it wouldn’t be busy, and anyway when they’d eaten there last night service had been quick, so: six minutes to order and get the food and nine minutes back.
“It is
“Yes,” Cas said.
“I can’t predict the future,” Cas said.
“Yes,”  Dean said immediately.  “Look, it’s - it’s not a problem, you can do whatever you want.  It’s just - does it mean you’re staying?”
from me?” Dean says, like Castiel isn’t even there.
“Do you have, like, Instagram
“Social media.  Yelp.  The goddamn chip clips,” Dean said, gesturing around the bunker at large.  “It kinda seems like you’re, I don’t know, settling into life on Earth.”
“Go back to sleep,” Dean snapped.
, and who is he to judge?
"I'll let you sleep," he says, because he doesn't want to be outside but he can tell from Sam's pillow and Dean's silence that they don't want him here either, and if he can help ease them at all he'll do it.
Castiel glances up to meet Dean’s glare.  “You’d prefer I not be in the room while you sleep.”
“What, Sammy, cool your jets,” Dean said.
fan of classic cars.  Ain’t that right?”
There was a tap on the window, and Dean resisted the urge to jump.  When he looked over, Cas was pressing his nose against the glass and raising his eyebrows.
Cas shrugged.  “Sam helped me set it up.”
“No,” Cas said.  “That was - sex.  Regular human sex.”  He frowned.  “Was it not?”
It opens for him easily, and he steps inside.  The place reeks of sulfur, and it’s dark in the front lobby.  Castiel isn’t sure what it used to be - a real estate agency, maybe, or a tax preparer - but it’s empty now, just desks and chairs and frosted glass offices branching off in several directions.  Down one hall, Castiel can see lights, and he follows them, stepping carefully on the carpeted floor.
“I don’t think you’ll regret this,” Cas said smugly.
“I asked you if you needed me.  You said no.”
“Always a joy,” Dean muttered.  “That reminds me, let’s get some grub.”
“Sex on the hood of the car,” Cas said, like it was a normal thing to say.
Cas looked up, startled.  “Trolls?  I didn’t think they had the dexterity to operate a keyboard.”
“I killed her,” Castiel says.
“Are you staying with
“You sure?” Dean says, and when he looks at Castiel his eyes are - Castiel recognizes it as
“Good,” Castiel says, and means it beyond pleasantries.  “Things are good.”
“Good,” Dean imitated, rolling his eyes and pressing a kiss to the back of Cas’s neck.  “Understatement of the year, Cas.”
“I’m not turning around just because Cas wants to have a fancy beer,” Dean snapped.  “Maybe we can go to your place if we’re still here tomorrow, but bar food’s been good enough for us for 30 years and that’s not changing now.”
They push to their feet, and Castiel listens carefully at several doors in a row until he finds one that’s vacant.  Dean pulls out a credit card and jimmies the lock open almost immediately, and Castiel follows him inside the dark room silently.
“Wow, nosy much?  Keep your hands out of my snacks, dude.”
or anything.  Dean had
“If we - didn't talk about it.  That way, I figured, if you regretted it, it could just - not come up.”
“Very much,” Cas said, in that too-sincere way of his that usually made Dean squirm but kinda felt nice, just now, probably because Dean was too tired to worry about it.  Cas was sliding his hands up Dean’s shirt, skating over his ribs and his hip, sliding down toward his waistband.
.  We don’t have an address for a reason, Cas.”
“So it’s like porn?” Dean said.  “You’re telling me Instagram is just full of porn?  And you signed Cas up for it?”
No, what makes him unsure, right at this moment, is that for all the time he spends thinking of Dean, he suddenly realizes that he has no idea if Dean spends any time thinking of him at all.
something he got shy, somehow; he was used to want, knew how to process and shape it,
Dean blinked.  “Excuse me?”
Want is very inconvenient.  Castiel has had to adjust.
“Excuse me?” Castiel said.
“They can track you through that thing, Cas,” Dean said, handing him his phone back.  “Sam tell you that?”
“No,” Dean said.  “So what took you so long?”
“Are you sure?” Castiel asks.
“Okay, maybe I don’t,” Sam says, throwing his hands up.  “So if there’s nothing wrong, why don’t you ride with Cas back to the motel and I’ll follow in his car?”
“Everyone’s on Instagram,” Cas said, like it was

“Long day,” Dean grunted while Cas pressed kisses down his throat.  “Sam got hurt.  Baby got dinged.”
“No, of course not,” Sam soothes.  “Look, let’s just get a drink and get some sleep, Dean.  We’ll find something else in the morning.”
“Fucking great,” Dean muttered.  “Just what he needs to know.”

was what made Cas come but right now he was busy picturing what the hood of his car looked like at the moment and coming himself, so, you know.  He’d deal with that later.
“Yes,” Dean breathes, “I need you,” and then he’s kissing Castiel again.
“But you were gone like… half an hour,” Sam said.
“Totally,” Chelsea says, grinning at Dean.

did this?” Dean asked, whirling on his brother.
Castiel glances at the bottle, at Dean’s hunched shoulders.  “You’re upset because we missed the second werewolf.”
“It’s all those cooking shows,” Sam said.  “People are obsessed.”
“I’d never really thought about it,” Cas admitted, but Dean didn’t really give a crap anymore because he was too busy crowding Cas up against Baby and unzipping all over again.  His dick, which had flagged a little bit during the whole confusing interruption, was back in the game and he needed Cas to be wearing about a thousand percent less pants
“No comment,” Cas said, and kissed him quiet.
“All demons are scumbags,” Castiel says.
see the point in is hunting, your car, and the latest Dr. Sexy marathon,” Sam said.
Dean felt like an idiot, driving down I-40 staring at Cas with his dick hanging out of his pants, but he tapped the brakes and pulled off onto some kinda side road that seemed to lead to nothing at all.  “What’s going on?  Look, Cas, you ever don’t want to do something, you just tell me to fuck off, I won’t take it personally - ”
, he hears, and then hangs up and dials Sam.
much of a hardship getting an amazing blow job in exchange for twenty minutes less sleep, so he reached out with the hand that wasn’t covered in peanut butter and slid it around Cas’s waist.  “You coulda just stayed, you know,” he said, without totally knowing where he was going with that.  “In my room.  Or whatever.  It doesn’t - it’s not just sex, you know.  You can stay even without sex, is what I’m saying.”
“You’re tense,” Cas murmured in his ear, skittering his hands along Dean’s lower back.
“Whatever,” Dean says.  He settles onto the lumpy sofa, kicks his feet up and leans back.
explicit permission, and who Dean wiped down with a microfiber cloth - and then they got back in and drove the rest of the way out to the farm.  Every time Dean glanced over, Cas had a pleased little air about him, and Dean had to stare straight out the windshield to hide his grin.
“Nope,” Dean said.  “Machine was broken.”
“That you’ll, I don’t know,” Dean said.  “Stick around.  That you’ll come by on some kind of normal schedule, that you won’t fly upstairs one day and we’ll never hear from you again.”
"Whatever," Sam says.
“No,” Castiel says, answering only the second question.
Sam snorted.  “Don’t drag me into this.”
a one time thing."
Dean turns on the TV, and Castiel is grateful for the distraction.  The bottle sits on the counter, and the glass in Dean's hand is refilled before Sam comes out of the steamy bathroom.  Sam doesn't comment, just sits at the table across from Castiel and opens his computer.  He digs into the police records on the original three werewolf murders, and Castiel weighs in with unhelpful information about the case that they all already know.
have a Tinder profile?”
Sam shrugged.  “I don’t know.  What does he do with anything?  Just adds it to the millennia of knowledge, I guess.  He figured out Snapchat filters the other day.”
“It’s interesting,” Cas said, unhelpfully.
,” Sam says, his voice heated, and Castiel tears his eyes away from Chelsea to look at Sam.  Sam looks
“Yeah, he likes cartoons and liquor and whatever,” Dean said.  “This is boring stuff.  Just, like, the crap it takes to be a human.  Shit he doesn’t have to do since he’s not one.”
“I don’t need protection,” Dean snarled.
Castiel knows Dean is teasing, but he replies, “Not since The Empire Strikes Back.”
The next day, Castiel can tell Dean doesn't want to talk about it.  Dean wants so few things, and Castiel wants to give them to him when he can, so: they don't talk about it.
Dean hoped, a little blearily, that Cas couldn’t smell the room as much as Dean could.  It just seemed like that would be embarrassing.  “‘M sleeping.”
“It was no trouble,” Cas said.  “And anyway, it’s Mr. Gonzalez’s credit card on the account.”
"Dean's not an asshole," Castiel says.  "Any more than usual."
, huh?”
we do?”
“All is well,” Castiel says, and wipes his angel blade on a fallen demon’s shirt.
“Not when you are clearly so opposed to having a conversation about it, no.”
“But I have no plans to leave,” Cas continued.  “And I don’t plan to hide it from you if I do.  If I have to go, you’ll know.  I think after all this time we’ve fairly conclusively determined that we’re better off together.”
.”  He waggled his eyebrows for emphasis.
Cas groaned loudly as Dean lined himself up.  “
.  And it’s all just macarons.”
“Fuck it,” Dean says, and then he’s pushing Castiel against the closed door and kissing him fiercely, and Castiel opens to him immediately, and soon their clothes are slipping to the floor, and then Dean is underneath him on the bed, and Dean’s head is thrown back as he gasps curses and blasphemies and the name he alone gave Castiel.
“Okay?”
“Sam,” Castiel says quietly, even though he has no idea what to say next, no idea what to say at all.  “It’s okay.”
“Definitely don’t need the details,” Sam said, trudging out of the kitchen.  “I’m going back to bed.  Think you two can keep it down?”
"He means whiskey," Sam says darkly, when Dean is too far away to hear.
Dean looked at it like it had fangs.  “Excuse me?”
for those things; if he gets them, he takes them, and if he doesn't he moves on.
There’s movement down the hall, several pairs of footsteps, and Castiel swiftly ducks behind a cubicle.  The office door swings open, and he hears a new voice say, “All right, we got a basic alcohol package here for - oh, shit.  Are you fucking kidding me?  You brought me a
He didn’t bother to ask Sam or Cas if they wanted to stop, just put the Impala in park and got out of the car at the first motel that looked halfway decent by their standards.  It was another ten hours to the bunker and he’d be damned if he was going to sit in the car in silence until sun up; no, he was gonna grab a six pack, drink most of it, and then catch a few hours sleep before they drove the rest of the way home.
Cas tilted his head.  “Road head?”
The second and, it turns out,
.  “That’s my fucking
Sam rolled his eyes.  “Calm down, it’s not like I signed him up for Pornhub.”
“Easier?” Castiel says, staring out the passenger window.
They have basic needs, of course - food, water, shelter, sex - but once humans figured out how to meet those, they moved on quickly to what else they could get.  Castiel loves humanity but, he can dispassionately acknowledge, humans are selfish and covetous and greedy.  They always want
“You have not been alive for one million years,” Cas said, and kissed him again.
“This whole
But Dean isn’t listening, or at least not closely, because his eyes have tracked down to Castiel’s lips and he’s leaning closer, and Castiel has the entire history of film in his head, he knows what happens next, knows that when it’s raining and someone’s drinking and they lean in close, he knows it’s -
“Okay,” Dean said.  “Good.”  He chewed thoughtfully.  “I think I still feel the effects of that trick.”
hadn’t expected that he’d kiss Cas back.
"The Ewoks are stupid,” Castiel says, parroting an argument he’s heard Sam make several times previously, and Sam bursts out laughing.
“Dean?” Sam said, sounding sleep-confused.
“Fu - no,” Dean admitted, gritting his teeth because look, at this point he had nothing to hide.   He was fucking an angel over the hood of the sexiest goddamn car on the planet and dreams really did come true.  “Not even close to the first time I’d - fuck - thought about it.”
or whatever Sam called it, but.
“Unbelievable,” the third demon says, his eyes flashing black.  “It’s impossible to find decent employees these days.”
“By trading it for yours,” Dean said.  “You know better than that.  We don’t trade hostages.”
“It’s not just bread,” Cas said, scrolling mindlessly.  “There are a lot of women in various states of undress.”
“I could solve this,” Cas said, thoughtfully.
Castiel feels his chest tighten, an annoying and autonomic human reaction that this body failed to discard even once he got his grace back.  “I suppose.”
“What?” Dean said.  “I - yes.  Yes?”
Castiel stares down at his bottle until the door swings shut behind them, then bolts for the back exit.  By the time he gets to the sidewalk, Dean and the other man are halfway down the block, and Sam’s keeping pace with them across the street.
.  Why does it piss you off?”
“What are you arguing about?” Cas asked as they both pulled their doors shut behind them.
Castiel freezes for an amount of time so short that it would not be detectable to humans.  "Why?"
Cas looked up finally.  He seemed a little hurt.  “I have… one.”
“No,” Cas said, and climbed on top of him.
“Yeah, but these poor fucks aren’t even getting anything good out of their deals,” Dean says.  “A baggie of blow for your soul?  They’re preying on desperation, man.”
Dean jerks his head toward him.  “What?  No.”
Castiel squints.  “You think I have no preferences?”
“Okay, so,” Dean said, and raised his eyebrows.  “What
- Castiel can handle that.  He’s been catering to Dean’s needs for as long as he’s known the Righteous Man.
“Yes,” Cas repeated.  “Are you feeling all right?”
“Come on.  Sound it out.  Head?  I know you know that one.  Now put road in front of it.”
“I’m not sure you are,” the bartender grunts.  “So you pay up, or head on home.”
else, to keep his brother safe.
“Okay, so you want to come inside.”
“All right, Cas, all right,” Sam says.  “I hear you.  I can talk to Dean if you - ”
Dean looked around.  Yeah, his clothes were back in place, including his boots (which he’d taken off hours ago), and Cas was across the room, sitting calmly in the chair he’d been in when Sam had left.  His tie was askew.
a self-absorbed son of a bitch."
“Yeah, there,” he mumbled in Cas’s ear, grinding down as Cas’s grip tightened around him.  “Harder, Cas - ”
When he arrives at the bunker, Sam is in the library, a stack of books next to his computer.  “Hey, Cas,” he says.  “How’s it going?”
“You’re not yet,” Cas said.
"Burgers?" Dean says, finally and unsurprisingly.
Dean watched him.  Cas actually looked like he felt bad, which made Dean feel kind of bad, because it hadn’t been
He cracked an eye.  “Cas?”
First of all, there’d been a shifter.  Then, it turned out the shifter had been hanging out with a vamp, because they were just
, Dean thought, how had he not seen it for so long?
And then he heard the door creak open.
“Uh, the government?”
“I think I could spot you a round,” one man says, sidling up to Dean’s side, and Dean grins broadly and claps a hand on the man’s shoulder.
Actually, now that Dean thought about it, it sounded pretty stupid.
"Cas," Sam says.  "Listen.  I can't read Dean's mind.  But I just... can't see it being a one time thing.  With
Dean texts a week later for a case; they’ve tracked a mother changeling down to Tucson and realized too late that it hopped a plane to Detroit.  Sam’s looking at plane tickets but if Castiel is closer - and of course he is, because Castiel is almost always close to Lebanon, Kansas and Lebanon is closer to Detroit than Tucson is by a lot - if Castiel is closer, maybe he can go check it out.  They’ll make sure to get the kids they found down in Arizona turned over to the authorities and meet him up there when they can.
“So you prayed to me,” Cas said, and his voice was fucking
“See any good movies lately?” Dean asks, digging into the basket of fries at Castiel’s elbow.
“Not really.”
They go back to the motel after dinner, and Castiel trudges into the room behind the brothers, not realizing until he’s closing the door behind him that he has no reason to be there.  The case is over, Castiel has his own car, and the Winchesters won’t go to sleep for a few hours, probably, so Castiel is about to turn around and leave when Dean says, “Want a beer, Cas?”
“Course I am,” Dean said, and kissed Cas, unnecessarily.  He pulled him closer; it wasn’t
anything from me, Dean?” he says.
The man smiles back at him, then pays for a drink.
And now Sam was passed out in a crappy motel bed, and the air conditioner was loud as hell, and all Dean wanted was some ice to get his beer down from “sweltering” to “potentially drinkable”, but the
“Oh,” Castiel says, and smiles.  “I wanted to see you too.”
been the one to suggest something totally insane.  “What?”
They drive in silence for five, ten miles.  Castiel assumes that Dean intends to wait out the entire ride back; he has seen Dean stay furiously silent for significantly longer than the twenty minutes between the bar and their motel.  In retrospect, Castiel wishes that he had ridden with Sam.
“I hope you took it to the backseat, is all,” Sam continued blithely, like Dean hadn’t almost just fallen over out of sheer shock.  “That’s common courtesy, man.”
"I'm going outside," Castiel says, nodding at the door.  "I'll see you in the morning."
Castiel rubs his thumb along his angel blade and watches as Dean walks clumsily up to the bar, knocking into both a man and a barstool before slumping up against it.  “‘Nother round, please,” he slurs to the bartender.  “Put it on my tab.”
They call in an anonymous tip to the local police, then trudge down the dark street in silence, a quarter mile back to where they left their cars outside the bar, Castiel’s Continental tucked right up against the back bumper of the Impala.
Things are quiet.  It should be a good thing - of course it’s a good thing, but as he sits at a diner and watches the coffee he’s not drinking get cold Castiel thinks that he wouldn’t mind if there was
“Come where?” Dean asks.
“‘M okay,” he rasps, his hand gripped tight into Castiel’s shirt.  Castiel holds him up as he sucks in another breath, presses his forehead to Dean’s temple, and Dean relaxes into it, burying his face in Castiel’s neck and holding him back just as hard, and Castiel hadn’t actually thought Dean was going to die but that doesn’t mean he won’t enjoy feeling the life run through him, warm and strong.  For a moment, they breathe together.
, couldn’t catch a damn second to get Cas alone and he thought he’d finally found it: Sam, out on the edge of the county investigating the farm the first vic had visited before he kicked the bucket.  Dean figured he and Cas could go back to the hotel, grab a shower (hopefully together) and have a solid hour, maybe two, before Sam tramped his big giant feet back through the door.  He’d been looking forward to it all day.
He said, “Fu - ”
They stayed like that, bent over the hood of the Impala, kinda catching their breath.  “Holy shit,” Dean said, when he felt capable of speech again.  “That was - ”
“You can’t even say goodbye to Cas like a normal person anymore?”
The town faded away quickly - it was like three blocks in every direction and then nothing but farms and scattered houses, just pinpricks of light in the moon-baked landscape.  It was fine, being in the car with Cas instead of back at the motel.  Dean was totally fine with it.  It was
When Dean came back from paying for the gas, Sam nodded him over.  “Dean.  C’mere.”
“Cas,” Dean said.  “I told you.  It’s not that I don’t want to, but I’m wiped out.  It ain’t personal, all right?  Eight hours.  Hell, gimme six.”

“Maybe I
Castiel watches while he pays for a second, then a third; Dean drinks them quickly, talks about sports and the weather until they’re empty, and then he turns to the man and says, “Well, it’s been real, but I should get going.  Don’t want the old ball ‘n’ chain getting worried, am I right?”
It’s a crossroads demon gone rogue, Cas determines.  He’s running a whole scheme, paying lowlifes to bring in desperate people willing to trade their souls for anything, an eternity in hell for next month’s rent or a couple hits.  “We’ve seen shit like this before,” Dean says under his breath when they figure out which bar one of the lackeys frequents.  “Scumbags.”
no complaints in that department; the whole thing had been pretty freaking great if Dean did say so himself, which he did.  Unexpected, sure, but
“How is that relevant?” Cas said.
, like Dean was precious, and usually Dean hated when Cas looked at him like that, made him feel human and fragile.  But tonight Dean had felt something in his chest rear up when Cas had tried to trade his life for Dean’s and he
“Oh,” Dean says.  “We - oh.”  He looks around wildly.  “Do you think any of these are open?”
Dean snatched the toilet paper out of Cas’s hands and stormed down the hall, yelling back over his shoulder, “Send the rest of it back!”
“What else is new?  Ohio sucks,” Dean says, his voice a little further away through Sam’s speakerphone.  “Think you can take care of it without us?”

“Ice,” Sam said.  “In a glass of water?”
damn hard to keep your eyes on the road when you had a lapful of angel going down on you, but Dean was a man of his word so he did his best.  There had been a little bit of sorting out, keeping Cas’s head away from the steering wheel and the one moment where Cas had kinda kicked the dash that had made Dean flinch, but now that they’d gotten going Dean was into it.  So into it that his mouth started running, like it did sometimes; he couldn’t help it.
, and it’s never going to be perfect but Castiel wants him back so much that he supposes they’ll just have to figure it out.
“It’s

“Bobby was right,” Castiel said.  "You

“Dean,” Sam says, sharply.
“Who do you think is going to be tracking Cas through
“You get a discount with the card,” Cas said, like
“Then I’ll buy some more,” Dean says.  He takes the bottle back and stares off across the drenched parking lot.  It’s extremely ugly, so Castiel ignores it in favor of watching Dean.  “Cas.”
"Call it a hunch," Sam said.  "I know my brother pretty well, and I know you okay too.  Look, if Dean told you not to tell me, you don't have to - "
“Why?” Castiel asks, surprising even himself.
Down the hall, a door slammed shut, and Dean jumped.  “Hey, pal, listen,” he said, wrenching his mouth away from Cas’s with not inconsiderable difficulty, “I’m not complaining, but we’re in the middle of Kentucky and there might be some people around here who, you know, might not take too kindly to seeing two dudes getting hot and heavy when they wanna get some ice - ”

Dean looks at him.  “What

.  He wanted to show Cas all the things that were conceptually hot in the known universe, and so he pulled back, one hand still wrapped around Cas, and said, “Hey, before you come, pull out, okay?”
“I know that,” Dean said, “of course I know that, I’m not
“You are a menace,” Dean said.
Magical fucking lube.  Would wonders never cease.
Cas followed Dean into the first room quietly, waited while Dean did his usual checks and drew his salt lines and dropped his bag by the bed.  He said nothing while Dean went into the bathroom and washed the blood off his hands and face - his and Cas’s mixed together, who knew whose was whose - and then threw his stained flannel on the floor to go into the laundry bag later.
“Of course,” Cas said, and then paused, looking slightly embarrassed, said, “except…”
Dean looks at him, his face blank and his jaw tight, but Castiel knows this man’s soul and he knows when he’s trying to
And he

, and Dean - oh holy shit, if Dean hadn’t just come he woulda been ready to go in a heartbeat, watching Cas’s eyes widen as he felt Cas warm and wet against his lips and cheek.
“Paper or plastic?” the cashier asked.
Dean doesn’t pull away then; he surges forward with a soft noise, opens his mouth and hesitantly swipes his tongue against Castiel’s, and Castiel has kissed people before but he knows now that all of those were just practice so that he would have a chance to get this one right.
“You don’t need to thank me for kicking Dean’s ass into gear,” Sam says, rolling his eyes and going back to his laptop.  “He’s in his room, by the way.”
Dean shoots him a look.  "But not - not like that.”
- Jesus, had he raised a man or a fucking rabbit, he couldn’t tell sometimes - and his side just said
Then he thought about it for a second, went back around to Sammy’s side, leaned in close, and said, “Actually, we did it on the

And then he left Dean’s room, cackling his head off.)

“Nobody drinks free here, pal.”
“Ffffuck,” Dean hissed between his teeth, truly trying to keep his hands at two and ten because he did
“I wouldn’t do that.”
Castiel turns to see Dean with his hand on the small of a young woman’s back, guiding her toward the table.  “Here’s your beers,” Dean says, dropping two on the table and then grabbing his jacket off the back of his chair.  “And I’ll be taking this.”
Dean fought back a blush.  “Bite me, Sammy.”
“What do you mean?” Castiel asks.
“Like
“Yeah?”
“My apologies, Sam,” Castiel said.
“Cas,” Dean growled, biting into the flesh of his shoulder.
“All right,” Castiel says, and the door’s barely shut before the Impala pulls away.
“Oh,” Cas said, and dropped a massive pile of Amazon boxes onto the kitchen table.  “Boxes.”
“Which is why I was the one who shoulda stayed!” Dean said.  “They were barely even roughing me up!”
Castiel nods and leaves Sam to his work, and finds Dean in his room with his music on so loud that he doesn’t hear Castiel’s approach; instead Castiel catches him facing away, nodding his head and folding up a black undershirt that’s seen better days, and Castiel watches him silently for a few seconds before he says, “Hello, Dean.”
But the angel’s mind being blown had not, it turned out, been particularly different than anybody’s else’s mind being blown.  It wasn’t that Dean was disappointed, it was just that, in all the times he’d thought about sleeping with Cas - which wasn’t, like, a
“Louisa’s Tavern?” Dean said.  “Sounds fancy, you see an ad for it or something?”

“Yeah, he’s here,” Sam says.  “Did you want to… to talk to… oh.  Uh, hang on.”  There’s a muffled sound; Castiel hears Sam speak, then Dean’s deeper tones in the background.  When Sam comes back to the phone, he sounds - different.  “Hey, Cas?  Look, um.  Dean’s… busy.”
“Oh,” Castiel says, recognizing the dismissal.  It’s abrupt, but then, it’s Dean.  “Of course.  Tell Sam I said goodbye.”
“They’re not looking for

“Formality for what?” Dean asks.

“Then why are they there?” Cas said.  “Aren’t these people reaching out for human connection?  Admittedly, they’re being a little crass if what they’re looking for is companionship, but - ”
Dean grunted non-committally, filled a cup with water and downed it, then started on his own peanut butter toast.
“Guys?” Sam says, appearing in the doorway, and that’s that; Dean jerks away, rubbing his throat and picking up his dropped knife, tucking it into his waistband and looking around at the bodies.
“At least tell me you got the other one too,” the demon snarls, and Castiel sprints down the hall.
“Okay,” Dean repeats, frowning at him.
“Dude, what do you
“I don’t think we’re looking at a vengeful spirit,” Dean said, pulling away from the curb with a jerk.
“We’re sitting on the ground,” Castiel says, and Dean looks around.

“Dean,” Cas murmured.  He was thrusting up impatiently where their hands were tangled together between them, his brow sweaty, and Dean

“I know,” Dean says, glaring out the windshield.  “So. I’m guessing this is about what happened last month.”
It makes sense.  Dean is a man of need.  Lonely, discouraged, drunk; he needs the warmth of someone’s lips, of a body against him, the motions that make humans feel less alone, make them feel loved.  The fact that it’s not Castiel that Dean wants, that it’s just something he

.  Unbelievable.”
Cas didn’t make him talk much after that; instead he stayed quiet, his lips firm on Dean’s, his hands skating across Dean’s skin.  Dean thought they woulda been hard and fast tonight, kinda heated like they sometimes were after they argued, but Cas didn’t seem angry.  He seemed
