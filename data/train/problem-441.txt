Sherlock shoved, once, pushing his weight into his brother. Strong hands gripped Mycroft’s wrists warningly before they released. “You of all people should know better,” Sherlock grumbled, much more himself as he sank back into his chair, all the fury drained away.
No sense reflecting on what he had thought before he was mated, then. Sherlock sipped his tea, leaning against the wall beside the window and looking out onto Montague street below.
John opened his eyes again, hoping against hope that however long it took them to get on with it wouldn’t be too long.
"No one's said where it is we're headed," John said, because no one had and though he wasn't currently worried about Mycroft's intentions, his last trip by private jet had been drugged and had only ended well on the technicality that was Sherlock.
Behind the two of them came a beautiful woman who had a baby in one arm and a young lad following behind her. Elisabeth rose from her seat, ignoring the two men to step over and greet the woman - Joscelin, John overheard.
A long pale arm yanked the sheet up over both their heads, and for a moment John’s head felt the wrong size for what’s inside it. Then he shifted and his body reminded him he’d been smacked about by a pipe the day before.
Anne chuckled in response. “That’s true,” she allowed, “but it seems different, when you watch them.”
That said. The best way to keep track of when the next story starts is going to be to subscribe to the
The thought was surprisingly disheartening. John shifted, uncomfortable with the discussion, suddenly. He both wanted and didn't want to know who the other person was, who all the other people were.
“You’ve been back since before I got here,” John replied. He gave up on liberating the plates and went through the drawers looking for silverware. Everything in the drawer that contained it was mismatched, but it was all clean. John liberated two forks from the mess, with spoons just in case, and headed into the sitting room.
Sherlock frowned inside, the nervousness from the previous evening gnawing at the bottom of his left lung like a parasite trying to-
John sat up, recoiling from the sting of it. He stared at the blood on his hand. It came quickly, more quickly than he thought it ought to, spilling from his palm to the floor with the pieces of the mug.
“The Holmeses are afficionados,” Gerard said. “It helps ease the tension when there’s so many of them in one place.”
He could feel morose agitation from his mate, but this was different. This was… absence, John supposed, and it wasn’t an absence Sherlock was feeling, it was one all his own. Not as sharp as what had happened when he went to Germany - John hoped they were never that far away from each other again - but noticeable.
John gave up pretending that Sherlock’s string of- what had he called them? Deductions? - that Sherlock’s deductions weren’t a whole lot like mind reading and looked up at his mate. “How-?”
Putting the car into park, Gregory Lestrade climbed out into the night. There was an ambulance on the way, but Lestrade had beaten it there. From the CSO at the front door, it seemed he had even beaten Constable Trimble there. The CSO seemed only too happy to see someone above his rank, and Lestrade was given a succinct rundown of what had happened.
Mycroft never spoke in any informative or personal way about his separations from Anthea, and with what small remaining parts of him were not howling with distress over John, Sherlock hated that his brother had kept those thoughts silent. Some sort of warning would have been appreciated. If he had been warned, perhaps he could have prepared.
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably, and this close, John thought he could put a hand up and touch the conflicting emotions radiating off his mate. “You’re going to make me nauseous,” John warned softly.
The wrong feeling that had been a background hum to John’s thoughts since leaving Wiltshire intensified as he made up the bunk that he’d be sleeping in. John tried to ignore it, but it was very little use. The sheets felt wrong. They were cheap regulation issue, over-washed to a false softness that had more to do with threadbareness than thread-count.
“What you said in that interview to DI Hopkins,” the sergeant said, “what had him almost slapping you in handcuffs.”
A tall, broad shouldered man - likely another wolf, or possibly just one of Mycroft's minions - took John away from the plane. John felt oddly adrift as he set foot back on the ground after the flight.
Sherlock jerked back from the open door to stare at his brother. “What are you doing here? You’re supposed to be-”
Sherlock made a curious noise, the one he did when he was waiting for an answer. In this case, an explanation.
it was three days, if you counted meals and trips outside as markers for days - after the incident more tests were run on him. Drug screens, organ function, the whole lot.
“You need a mobile,” Sherlock said, coming out of the trance-like way he had been looking at the street. He looked down at John, nodded, and then turned on his heel and marched down the street.
John took a breath and looked up again. “You said you were careful, but that sergeant says you overdosed. At least once. You said you can’t be addicted, but you have enough of a habit that the cops know you. But the idea of you not being here…” John’s chest tightened again, more of a clenching sort of feeling that felt like his heart was
John’s breath caught at that. The arousal from moments prior dissolved into pure affection. It wasn’t the most thoughtful thing a lover had ever done for him, but it had been years since anyone had known him well enough to buy clothes for him. It wasn’t unreasonable to think that Sherlock would know the correct size, considering he had been involved in the clothing purchases in Wiltshire, but somehow this was more intimate.
“It really isn’t,” John replied. He stopped undressing for a moment, able to draw on the lack of urgency from his mate’s dismissal. “You keep saying that your using the drugs wasn’t an addiction.”
He considered himself relatively free from any stress related reaction to the experience. The two of them could not be entirely similar, then, if John was experiencing a negative reaction to what they - what he had undergone. When he had been near breaking he was sustained by his lupine side, and then there had been John. Sherlock had to concede that some reaction was not unreasonable to expect from John.
That sounded simple, but John couldn’t quite wrap his mind around deleting anything. But then there was the yawn of days he couldn’t put his own number to, and-
After the conclusion of the case, it became apparent to John that Lestrade had other work that he completed without the help of Sherlock. Though it ought to have been obvious, that particular truth came as a strange thought after so many days of seeing the man nearly constantly in their rather horrific pursuit. Of course there were other crimes to be solved in a city the size of London. Being attached to Bow Street in the capacity that he was, Lestrade must see all manner of cases that needed sorting out in the eyes of the law, and thusly through the power of the magistrates.
Despite the towering height of the man, John could not feel any attempt at intimidation as he had with some of the other introductions. The grip of his handshake was warm, and the calculating gaze was almost relaxed. The phrasing had helped, too. Rawden Holmes had said 'our' in reference to John, rather than the constant reminder from the younger wolves that John was Sherlock's John.
They were barely in the door when Sherlock started to ask something, only to be cut off by the chime of his mobile from his jacket pocket.
With an exaggerated roll of his exquisite eyes, Sherlock fixed his attention on John again. Sherlock’s eyes traveled up and down, taking in the whole length of him in a way that made John wonder if he was even paying attention to what he’d been asked. It went on for long enough that John was about to protest when Sherlock spoke.
since before they collected Harriet from the park, but none of it had made any sense. There were brief moments in which what came from his mate was comprehensible emotion, but any clarity was quickly consumed back into a swirl of feelings that was rapid-fire and dizzying.
The vividness of it captured John each time his eyes slid shut, until the moon faded, and sleep took him properly into his arms.
Of course Sherlock also sat with one knee bouncing enough to shake the two of them, but the closeness was nice. John could sympathize. They would be with Sherlock’s
“Milton. They took Milton to the station to see about all the blood. It’s all over the sofa,” John said, jabbing a finger at the offending piece of furniture in exasperation.
After their shower, Sherlock dressed with an erratic sort of precision, sliding long limbs into immaculately posh clothing. John appreciated the way his mate did it, found the sight of his ready-making distracting enough that he slowed his own to watch. Sherlock embellished the act of putting on his jacket by slowing it down. John’s eyes stayed caught on him and his fingers fumbled with the buttons of his shirt.
"I don't know," John growled. "It just... the longer we were apart, it hurt, alright? The tremor in my arm came back, everything went gray, I... I don't know."
The brief sensation of falling - being tackled, really - ended with a dull impact onto the bed. Sherlock made short work of John’s trousers, and between them John got naked and more clothes found their way to the floor. As Sherlock sat up to strip his shirt off, John couldn’t help but chuckle out, “You must be hell on housekeeping.”
There was no immediate response. John stopped splashing the water to listen for Sherlock's answer, but... there really was none. That didn't seem normal.
Mycroft crossed to the sofa. He disconnected himself from what must now be done, as he had the last time it needed doing. He went through the motions as with any other detestable task. Rather than a yank, he grasped Sherlock by the nape of his neck. Rather than snatching vest and the collar of his silk dressing gown along with it, fingers closed around the material and tugged. Then it was an easy flex of arm that brought Sherlock to his feet, and Mycroft frog marched him to the bathroom.
John had a sour taste in his mouth, one that he hated. It was bitterness. Nothing bad had happened, precisely, but any time he had this sort of pain in him he just couldn’t seem to shake the miasma.
John had seen it three times before -- twice, really, because how could you count the one that was impossible to see while driving a snowmobile from attacking gunmen -- but this setting was far more fascinating. The group of them all stripped down, conversation continuing until it died off slowly. Even little Connie had been talking (to the others, of course not to John) and she fell silent too.
Sherlock’s hands stilled and he stared wide-eyed at John, looking confused for a moment. He searched John’s expression, eyes darting cross his face, down his neck for a moment, and then back up. “You mean that,” he said.
John looked down to see that it was bandaged and twitching, fingers moving like they had some rhythm to tap out.
“This is setting a dangerous precedent of indulgence, John,” Sherlock huffed, turning to the window.
There was some noise on the stairs that announced the paramedics. Lestrade stepped aside, only to be surprised when this ‘John Watson’ fellow stepped forward to intercept them. “Shallow lacerations, almost entirely to the front of his head, though there was one that went back behind his ear. I didn’t find anything else, but I’m sure he was injected with some sort of a hallucinogen. Came in shouting that he needed help, and was unsteady on his feet. He’s been in and out for about an hour, some pupil response but no respiratory obstruction.”
“Milton’s body was completely exsanguinated. The photos made that clear to me, but this-” Sherlock extended a hand towards the blood stains on the brick wall, “this can’t be five litres. The area has been largely free of rainfall in the past days, less a light shower last evening. Not hard enough to wash away
Knowing there was no getting out of this eventually, but unwilling to let the matter from earlier drop, John folded his arms. “After my question from this morning. How did you meet Lestrade?”
“Last time I went shopping two arseholes tried to jump me,” John said. “We need a kettle, tea, food, and I need peracetmol.”
John reminded himself that to his regular acquaintance, losing thing military would be devastating. He looked down at his coffee and understood the loss she was imagining, but that hadn’t hit him yet.
If John were capable of thought at that moment, he would have recalled that Sherlock had said the sex would get better. Sherlock had spoken truthfully.
John took a step back, putting his back to the wall just on the inside of the security scanners that lined the entry. He closed his eyes to block out the sterile looking walls and the bright white that felt like it was trying to project straight into John’s skull. He took a deep breath, trying to ignore the scent of the room.
Despite the strength of the memory, the phantom pain that managed to overcome his reason, and everything telling him otherwise, John relaxed into Sherlock's grip. Just the sensation of Sherlock close, the nose against his temple, relaxed John.
Finished with his questions, Dr. Watson was released. He looked like he had a headache, at least to Greg, a sight worse than the harassed look he’d been wearing when Sherlock pulled that stunt this morning with the nudity.
“There’s a lot we don’t know about each other,” Sherlock said, shifting forward until John’s back was against his chest. “You said that, in the cage.”
“They’re lovely,” John said, sipping his coffee with a real smile. A smile that surprised him. He was happy for Mike, and he said so. “That’s great. Cheers.”
She was still drunk, but she was here. Time was if she was drunk, the rest of the world could go fuck itself.
The bed beneath John jostled slightly as Sherlock slapped a cell phone from the table by the bed, scattering papers as well.
"As refreshing as your possessiveness of your mate is," Mycroft said, lifting his eyes to regard Sherlock, "it's unnecessary."
take possession of the phones. Both of them. The one that was Harry’s that John had and the one that was Harry’s that she’d got in a store after giving up hers. Information flowed from his fingers that was undoubtedly helpful to the recipient - it could only be Clara, John surmised, as Sherlock would drop dead before
The sensation of skin on skin was electrifying. John couldn’t keep his hand occupied with Sherlock’s erection because there was so much more warm skin to touch. They seemed to be of a similar mind about the subject. Sherlock’s hands stroked John’s sides, traced his neck and came up to frame his face before those marvelous lips descended to John’s throat.
Casting a critical eye on the brick and the cobbles, Sherlock declared loudly, “There’s not enough blood.”
He wouldn’t use Sherlock for that. He wouldn’t do something like that to his mate, who was wonderful and didn’t deserve that sort of thing.
It was not Greg that questioned them. Dr. Watson ended up settled opposite a detective that had very little left of whatever human qualities he had once had. Greg was aware of the man, and hated him. There was something hard and cold about the man that just rubbed Greg the wrong way. Yes, the detective was generally dealing with suspects to crimes that shouldn’t draw out the warm and sympathetic in any investigator, but the icy facade didn’t end when the suspects went away, it lurked there, deadening the man’s eyes. Sherlock could consume a small battalion of that type of gruff detective for breakfast. Greg didn’t know about Dr. Watson.
John had no real idea what to do with that. Thankfully Connie was better versed at the whole thing. She shuffled over and crawled into his lap. John’s slight chill went away, and the sudden warmth was enough that he was nodding off almost as soon as Connie found her comfortable spot to sleep in.
The gentle touch to his shoulder turned into a gentle squeeze, and Sherlock shifted so that the warmth of his thigh was against John’s back. John didn’t bother resisting the urge to lean back against his mate, and let his eyes drift closed. He kept a careful, if trembling, grip on his tea mug.
For some reason, that was funny. John didn’t bother withholding his snicker as he got out of bed and scrambled into pants. After a moment of searching he found his dressing gown. He was all thumbs tying it off, but he headed into the sitting room at a quick trot, hoping to keep Sherlock from getting himself arrested for exposure. “Evening, Sergeant. Tea?”
Sherlock was less than amused when the frustration served to teach John a quick lesson on blocking him out.
In the wake of that understanding, the trembling in John receded as he recognized it for what it was.
“I’m very observant,” Sherlock said. He swung his legs off the arm of the chair. “You need a charger,” he said as he stood. “Let’s-”
The Colonel growled with what air he had left in his lungs, struggling beneath the weight, and John held on desperately, despite the gouges being dug into his forearms by the man’s blunt nails. Still he held on, despite the pain in his arms. If he let go, John knew it would end badly. He clung to the man.
With a degree of indulgence that John was surprised by, Sherlock did as he was asked, turning for the closet and doing away with yesterday’s clothes with no preamble.
“I’ve been solving the Met’s cases for years,” Sherlock replied, “they rarely take the suggestions of their incompetence well.”
“We’ll take a look at the scene,” Sherlock said. “Detective Jones was most helpful by supplying me with photographs of the scene. It can only be one in one of two places. The brickwork was distinctive.”
Sherlock nodded. John worked his arms around Sherlock, reveling in the closeness. He wondered if there was some way to soak in some of Sherlock so he would always be there. Sherlock let out something between a snort and a sigh, and pulled John more fully on top of him. There were too many elbows for a moment, and one too many knees, somehow, but finally they settled in to post-coital bliss.
They both chuckled at that, and Sherlock kissed him again in a just-because-I-can sort of way before releasing him. John found his footing and adjusted the fall of his jacket with a little tug, reminding himself sternly that getting off at a murder scene was just not on.
The girl’s dark eyes fixed on John, and he thought he could honestly say it was the first time she had looked at him. Beside her, Sherlock blinked articulately. Horatio frowned, folding down the top of his paper, and Anne tilted her head. “I don’t think that’s what she’s-”
In a neat little maneuver, Sherlock freed an arm and fished the phone from the floor, answering it before John could gather the wits to stop him.
The memory slammed into him with the force of a car speeding into a brick wall. It was always a rough one to deal with, fresh enough that recalling it brought with it a rush of pain that jolted through his arm. Logically, John knew the pain wasn't real in that moment. He was leaning against Sherlock and nothing about the relaxed angle was likely to tweak the nerve damage that had been done, but he still felt it like a rush of fire burning into his bones.
He hated knowing that, but figured it was better than the ragged edges of himself he could feel in the evenings.
Whatever Sherlock wanted with the skip, considering it contained ‘fresh’ rubbish instead of potentially clue-bearing rubbish, John couldn’t argue with that reminder. He moved over to the corner of the building and kept a weather eye out for any cars that might come along down the mostly empty street and question their… activities. Once again, and John was starting to think this was a thing to do with Milton in general, they were in danger of crossing the police.
"Come now John, you're a doctor. If my presence at your side induces a particular rise in serotonin levels, a release of oxytocin, wouldn't it stand
A face swam into focus. He wanted that to be Sherlock. He wanted the utterly inappropriate reaction to his injury to be nosing and licking at it, and he shut his eyes again as the Sergeant grasped him by the elbow and urged him to his feet. His balance was off, but he followed along into another corridor. Where he was lead he could hear some low talking, and then the grip on his elbow urged him onto a flat surface.
There wasn’t even light coming in around the door. John lay in the dark and waited as his heart slowed back into its normal rhythm and he was able to breathe again. He checked himself over and found himself with a mostly settled stomach. The fluorescent lights clicked on and started humming noisily overhead. It wasn’t quite time to be up - no one had called for them in the hallway - but it was a ‘gentle’ sort of way to nudge them towards consciousness. The lights were far too loud to sleep through.
The bunk John went to sleep in lurched to the side and for all his tense muscles and hyperventilating and sweating, John fell right onto the floor when the bunk tipped over. He woke with the impact.
The trouble was that knowing he couldn’t go on being angry about it was not the same as actually not being angry about it. Deciding not to be angry was all well and good, except that John’s temper was ticked permanently toward ON when it came to this sort of thing. He couldn’t just shut it off, and for the brain on him, Sherlock just wasn’t getting what John meant about it. They needed a reset.
A breath later Sherlock was on his feet and Mycroft was pinned to the cabinetry, with the lip of the counter top digging into his back. Sherlock snarled at him up close, eyes dark with fury. Teeth snapped at his cheek, too sharp to be human. The eyes that stared him down were more wolf than man, as was the threatening noise coming from Sherlock’s throat.
With that image of his mate clenched firmly in his mind, John made it through a second night on the cot.
Shifting to put his nose into John's hair, Sherlock glanced at his brother. "Even you haven't forgotten that Dresden was part of East Germany."
Sherlock rolled his shoulders, moving first to put away the violin and the bow. He tucked them reverently into a well-oiled old case, and that was placed on a shelf that had no books on it. Only then did Sherlock scoop up his mug, sipping the tea. “How would you put it, then?”
In the grayness that had become his existence, in the absence of Sherlock, having the army taken away was a staggering blow.
“You know perfectly well that I have purchased nothing from Milton in more than a year,” Sherlock snapped back.
John could think of nothing worse than Harry at the end of the most miserable week of his recent existence. He could barely figure out how he was going to make it from the facility into London at all.
The scrubs had a long distance to travel to make it up Sherlock's legs so they could be fastened at his waist, and John resolutely ignored the sight of it. "Being part of a werewolf pack is not like having human in-laws," Sherlock said, reaching for the open-backed gown that had been provided for them. "All he knows about you is that you'd survived something against all odds, twice. You're a remarkable exception to normal rules, but he's still... a strong voice in the pack."
“Bandages,” John said, shaking his head. His head was swimming with thwarted desire as Sherlock’s attention shifted from a very obvious
“Let’s just talk about Sherlock, then, shall we? How does a jobless bloke like him afford Montague Street, anyway?”
“Abigail,” the sergeant said. He cleared his throat, glancing at John awkwardly for a moment before going back to his papers. “She’s…”
Elisabeth came closer, obviously concerned, but John barely noticed her approach. His mind latched onto an idea. It was an absurd idea. Utterly ridiculous, it was, but it was also the only one that possibly made any sense.
Honestly, this chapter sort of snuck up on me the other night. Originally the whole of this story was from John's perspective.
John pulled the jumper over his head and tossed it on the back of the couch, away from the blood spots. He unbuttoned the cuffs of his shirt, and saw the way Sherlock’s eyes locked on to him undressing. He could feel his mate’s interest.
like it was a saber. Given what he’d seen of Dr. Watson’s occasionally fluctuating moods, it could have something to do with a stress related disorder.
Sherlock was frowning. He gestured to the store. “You’re reticent to use the phone you have. This is where we will acquire a different one.”
“I thought that blue would look good on you,” Sherlock replied, glancing over at him. “I was right.”
the bruising. Also, somehow his shoulder had gone stiff. John hoped that he just slept on it wrong, but he couldn’t be sure. He climbed carefully out of bed and stripped the top sheet off, making a mental note that they were going to have to expand their inventory of sheets unless they planned on doing laundry every other day.
“Durga found the pertinent data in the cellular terminals, but all it yielded was the frequency of the communications,” Mycroft added, smoothing the napkin across his lap. “Though neither Aldrich nor Marianne have reported anything of yet.”
It only served to annoy Sherlock, a sensation fueled by being reminded of how everything had gone so spectacularly to shit. He bit back the snarl that threatened, unwilling to disturb John, and settled for snapping, "As vexing as I am certain my lack of foresight for the well-equipped, well-informed-"
There were murmurs of agreement. John had heard not a few stomachs complaining as the afternoon wore on, but there was not a single word spoken aloud. Sherlock’s father stepped across the library, the other wolves moving out of his way as he came to the couch where John sat. Sherlock stepped over, and John rose to stand at his side.
It still took a moment, but Sherlock did just that, long legs and wool coat radiating warmth from the spot beside John. He sat half turned toward John, brows in a serious line, eyes darting up and down him as though checking for injuries. “It’s dangerous to be out this late.”
John wished he could feel quite the same. His back was stiff from the cold, and his shoulder was aching. The sleep he’d gotten had been light and rough, filled with a sense of exhilaration and exertion that was, undoubtedly, from his mate’s activities.
The usual attraction Sherlock felt for him was, surprisingly, undiminished by the smell, and the closer Sherlock got the less it mattered. There were more important things than scents, just then. Sherlock stepped right up to him, so close that their bodies brushed together.
I tried to get this up before November started, and wanted to have all 4 chapters posted, but that isn't what happened. Unfortunately. There is one more chapter in this story, and this story is not the end of this series, but I won't make any promises that there will be any more chapters before December sometime. Daily wordcount requirements for Nano are 1667 per day, and I am aiming to win again this year.
The room was very silent, and John supposed it ought to be intimidating, on some level, but all he felt was annoyed. The scientists had tried to use them being mated to extract information from Sherlock, John had assumed the wolves would just accept it, but obviously he'd been wrong there.
Blinking against the bright light from the overheads, John tried to make sense of what was around him.
Sherlock loved London. It was impossible to miss the vivid way he described the streets and scents of the sprawling metropolis. John was almost jealous of hearing Sherlock speak that way about it, but a firm grope and a lingering snog settled him a bit, and then Sherlock’s excited, “I cannot wait to have you in London, John,” was enough to set any jealousy to rest.
Sherlock pulled away from the kiss, pressing their foreheads together. “Don’t,” he rumbled, tightening the arm around his waist. “I need to feel you.”
, not the least of those were his former ‘bad habits’. The lack of John was the sort of thing that might tip Sherlock right back into that behavior.
“What are you talking about? He looks to be having some sort of a flashback,” Greg protested, fumbling with the bag. It was heavy, bulky, and seemed to contain a kettle along with whatever else was rattling about.
But that reveling feeling was a backdrop. There was the more pressing concern of John’s well-being to deal with, and that was more important than any sort of exaltation. So he curled around his mate and he read everything on the internet he could find about soldiers and their ailments on return from active duty.
“-only the time necessary to discharge him from the military. You said yourself that he would be better suited to an honorable return than the clandestine existence he would have otherwise been limited to.”
Sherlock brushed off the worst of what had come with him from the skip, took a few photos with his mobile and then they left.
The receipt from the train purchase wasn’t in the outside pockets of Sherlock’s coat, so John had to search for the inside one.
Two clear blue eyes glared at John in angry accusation, thick brows drawn together almost menacingly. The man in the bunk had an almost sinister appearance that was far too vibrant for the washed out room they were in. He seemed alive, but vicious.
The knowledge of their natural propensity towards demonstrative forms of expression did not make the experience of Sherlock’s particular flair for it any more palatable.
They all changed at different speeds, independent of age. It seemed to be rather based on the size of the wolf. Seemed to, because once it started, it was over too quickly to take them all at once.
It was still a bit odd feeling what Sherlock was feeling, but it was… strangely nice to have someone else’s feelings when he was sick of his own. John closed his eyes and let himself feel it, let Sherlock’s feelings wash over him.
Chuckling at that,  John realized the sergeant was still present. “Err… Can I help you with something?”
John set his tea next to Sherlock’s on the desk. Before he could think more about it, he stepped over, moving up behind Sherlock, and took him by the hips.
Sherlock’s attention return to Watson. As he was closing the door behind himself, Greg happened to hear one last word out of Sherlock.
John nodded, and they headed for one of the cafes. It was a nice enough day, so they headed back out into the lanes of the park and found a bench. It was a pleasant enough walk, but John wasn’t sure what to say to the man he’d been at school with. Thankfully, Stamford had some idea.
The fourth morning, Sherlock insisted they shower together - a plan John had no objections to, even when Sherlock pressed him into the tile and had them off again - to save time.
“My sister,” John admitted, hating how dreary the word sounded as it came out of his mouth. He scrubbed a hand across his face. “Who needed a place to sleep it off. Who I can’t- No, who I
The kitchen door banged open in the dramatic way that only one member of the household did with any sort of regularity. Sherlock stomped in, barefoot and disheveled from sleep, and headed straight for the refrigerator.
"No one is ever affectionate enough when they see you!" the brown haired wolf replied. "It's a complete scandal, really!"
A second tug and a rush of irritation were John’s only answer. He gave up arguing because he rather liked this new jacket. So out he followed, as Sherlock went slowly enough not to lose him in the patchy moonlight that made it through the trees.
That at least oughtn’t to have been set up by Mycroft, John thought. John tried, very hard, not to imagine that there were mixers in which eligible, well-to-do wolves mingled with suitable matches. It was a fact made harder by where he was being introduced to the family. But then there was Mycroft’s obvious connection to at least two of the spouses. John wondered how many times Mycroft had pulled the Emma Woodhouse routine, and cursed Harry for inflicted summer reading program choices when they were kids.
John nodded as well, content to sip the whiskey he’d been given. The age of it must be plentiful, he thought, from the taste of it.
The tea was ready, and John gathered the mugs up, carefully. If he focused hard enough on his hands, the shaking went away, but there was still enough of a tremble to disturb the surface of the tea. He was only a few steps into the living room before Sherlock was there, taking two of the mugs - somehow guessing correctly at which one was his - and delivering the spare to the sergeant.
Lestrade absolutely had to know how John Watson had managed to do that. Sherlock had an impertinent tongue in his head to go with the razor wit and the catalog of bad habits he’d picked up from… whatever public school he’d gone to. It had taken the threat of actual incarceration to shut Sherlock’s mouth on their last meeting. This was… amazing, really.
It made all Sherlock’s nice words about how strong he was feel empty, and it echoed the last conversation with the base doctor who had told him that once he’d recovered he’d be discharged back home.
The brightly lit white room swam in front of him, and John forced himself to breathe as the space stretched dangerously tall, like it was trying to make Sherlock look short.
“Then I am to understand that your ‘spat’ is about prior drug usage. Ah. Sergeant Lestrade was the answering officer, after all.”
Brief forays out of the flat for groceries taught John a bit about the surrounding neighborhood of Montague street, but for the better part of the next two days they stayed inside. John became quickly acquainted with what Sherlock called ‘his experiments’, and was thoroughly impressed by his mate’s… thoroughness, even if he could not be sure what the purpose of all the mess was.
Sherlock’s attention caught at John’s words. A rush of feeling spilled into John as Sherlock’s head snapped round to look at John, and no amount of Connie’s tugging could draw Sherlock’s attention away.
Sherlock threaded his fingers through John’s, nimble digits warm against a hand that John hadn’t even realized was cold.
The seeming lack of independent will angered Mycroft. This was not the Sherlock he was accustomed to, and he hated the thing that had taken residence in his brother. For a cruel, bitter moment, Mycroft thought of dunking his brother’s head in the bowl of the toilet to shock some reaction out, but that sort of pettiness was beneath him. The very thought of it offended his own nasal sensibilities. Instead he let Sherlock slump on the toilet, ignored his brother’s glare and the low growl of incoherent threats, and stoppered the sink before twisting the tap to fill it.
“How do you mean?” John asked, glancing back at the little alley. There was something there that Sherlock could see that he couldn’t.
“Uh…” John stalled, puzzled at the attention she had turned on him. He found that Charles was also looking at him expectantly. “We… haven’t even really been to London yet, so I can’t say…”
That took nearly an hour. At some point, Sherlock leaned in the doorway and said, “Clara hasn’t decided if she’s coming or not.”
“She’s going to throw a fit at you, and won’t be home when you get in,” Sherlock said. “She’s at a sibling’s house, or, more likely, she’s been pulled.”
John said, taking his hands off dressing Milton’s wounds before he managed to injure the drug addict worse than he already was.
John had almost forgotten that Horatio was at the table. It was odd, that. Glancing over at him, though, it became apparent that Horatio was enjoying the little domestic scene playing out before him, even with his nose tucked into the newspaper.
John stepped around the pair of them, heading for Sherlock, only to find the solid-chested wolf stepped into his path. "And this must be Sherlock's mate!"
gained ~30% of its word count during editing pre-posting. We began around 28,000 words, and we’re ending at over 40,000. I know it takes me a while, dear readers, but I hope it’s been worth the wait.
with Sherlock. And this was Sherlock’s place - their place, and it should feel just as safe as his mate did. But here in a place that was supposed to be safe, he felt like he was back in captivity.
Then John was hustled out onto the concrete and into the building, up the stairs, through the doors and into the flat.
In the morning, John felt a bit better. He hadn’t dreamed the night before, which was a little strange, but he woke to Sherlock broadcasting a vague, supportive sort of interest and John figured that even bad dreams couldn’t stand up to a determined werewolf. John came to with one of Sherlock’s long arms tight around his middle and the other stretched over him, loosely clutching a phone that looked to be entirely out of battery. Sherlock’s breathing was sluggish, and that made John smile, for some reason. Probably because it meant Sherlock had gotten sleep.
The store that sold mobiles in the general vicinity was… overwhelming. John could wield a scalpel, could arrange your organs back into your torso correctly whilst dodging bullets, could suture closed a wound, and so on. He had an iron stomach in the presence of blood, decay, and the thick black smoke from an IED, but as he followed Sherlock into the tech store, the over-clean metallic scent of the shop put a bad taste in his mouth.
“You will have to settle down,” Mycroft said, straightening his cuffs carefully. “John will be gone-”
It was so unlikely that Sherlock would reply to a phone call that Mycroft could not even say why he had bothered calling at all.
All he could think was that something had happened to John. Inside him the wolf raged at the very notion of it, but that was the only conclusion that Sherlock could come to. He had been irritable, he had been annoyed and despondent, had felt
The questions became more leading, then. John knew there had been little information taken from the scene. Obviously the soldiers from the unit that had gone in had seen the carnage, would have debriefed about it, and then there was Murray. John could remember Murray’s frantic care as soon as the patrol had found him, the way the man had been devoted to his extraction and survival…
for all that they were mostly silent. Then there was Horatio and Anne, who came with their daughter Constance. Connie, John was corrected by the girl in question, who stared at John and refused to speak a single word more from lunch through dinner.
John stared after him for a long moment, surprised to find himself alone in bed after the prior night’s tirade about ‘just gotten you back’ and ‘not outside’ and all the nudity that had happened between then and now.
Sherlock grew agitated when he was pushed away, and once he was let back in… Well. The entire train ride Sherlock had spent pressed against John’s side and staring out the windows. Any time someone in the car moved past them or an attendant stopped to check in on them, Sherlock rose up to his full seated height and glared.
“There is nothing wrong with your hearing,” Sherlock replied. “Which means that either you are unwilling to believe the truthful words I have related to you, or you find the practice of drug usage abhorrent. The latter, obviously, partly because of your chosen profession and more, unless I am wrong, which I very rarely am, to do with having a substance abusing trainwreck of a sister.”
“I have important information to relay,” Mycroft said, sipping his cup of tea. He paused, blinked once, and eyed John intensely before nodding in satisfaction.
The whole day they had been half-challenges and standoffs, and John had been suppressing his temper because he had absolutely no idea how to approach the situation. Sherlock hadn’t even mentioned what he might expect. His reaction felt stupid and childish. John was glad to meet them, glad to find that Sherlock wasn’t alone in the world, but he absolutely hated being handled like he was a child or worse, that he was made of glass.
"No," John replied, sighing as he pulled his own gown on. He was reminded by the entire conversation that he didn't really
“What they missed - a sad state of affairs that our police can miss things such as this, really, John - was that the victim had not been alone prior to the attack. Given the state of the flat I suppose some allowance ought to be made for the forensic analysts slowness of processing, but really, it can only be incompetence.”
The lighting in the hall was different from that in the interrogation room, and Dr. Watson blinked, bleary eyed, as he looked around. He certainly saw Greg where he was standing, but it was almost like he didn’t really see him. For a moment it appeared that Dr. Watson wasn’t sure what to make of his surroundings. He looked… lost somehow. It was strange to see the man look that way, especially after Greg’s first impression of him. Dr. Watson had seemed nothing but competent and in charge with the injured person in the flat. This Dr. Watson was a big change from that one. The impression lasted only a moment, and the second pass of his eyes around the station was more aware. He definitely saw Greg that time, but gave a bit of a huff instead of approaching. Instead, Dr. Watson tried to ask one of the officers in the hall a question, but got a gruff brush off. Then he seemed to sigh and turned and headed in Greg’s direction.
Time could now be marked by only two things. The healing of his arms (the length of time from the late night incident with the Colonel) and the ache of time that stretched between him and Sherlock. John found himself using both, only because it was nice to have a lesser measure to think about.
Needless to say, he wasn't exactly paying attention to his surroundings when they got off the plane and into the car. If he had been he would have known instantly that Mycroft had not taken them back to Montague Street.
. John wouldn’t know until he went back to see a doctor somewhere, and he didn’t relish the idea of any more doctor.
And the broken window? Sherlock had been swashbuckling in the library, tripped over his own feet - that’s what he gets for being so bloody tall! - and thrust his sword arm through one of the panes of the tall windows. The rest of him had tumbled after.
As John pulled the sheets taught on the empty bunk he’d picked, he felt a sinking sense of dread, like this was another place he’d be stuck in. The other veterans around the room that he could see all looked haunted, with a pallor to their skin and matching sets of twitchy gazes. It wasn’t a room with much of any hope, despite the impending return home, and John’s spirits sank.
Close, warm Sherlock seemed to have joined forces with the adrenaline crash and the combined might had knocked John asleep. In the wake of his lulled senses, John was disoriented. He struggled for a moment to place the events of the last few hours and sort out where it was that he - no, they were.
John didn't even notice the decor. He only had eyes for Sherlock as he shrugged out of a posh, ridiculous looking coat and snatched John back into his arms. John let himself go pliantly wherever his mate’s hands nudged him as Sherlock bent and sniffed behind his ear, then down his neck, and began peeling layers off him so quickly it was as if the clothes had personally offended the man.
"Only if the human is particularly worthy," Sherlock said, stroking his arm with sticky fingers. "Don't worry about it. It's their fault they can't really see you. Mummy likes you, the others will come around."
say is that I am understanding the wolf physiology to be similar but different to humans, drawing from Jupiter_Ash's source material for that, as well as my own body's tendency to be that 3% of the population that gets whatever odd side effect they don't expect you to get from taking a specific drug. In this instance, Mycroft has jump-started Sherlock's metabolism by a method he learned via trial-and-error during the... shall we say the heyday of Sherlock's drug usage.
“It was hot,” John replied, attempting to liberate the kettle from where it was lodged under far too much delicate looking glassware for one person to free it easily.
Numbly, John wondered why he hadn’t felt Sherlock coming. Normally he could feel Sherlock’s approach from any distance, but not this time. It was like Sherlock had snuck up on him. Then he realized that
A third swing, lower this time, aimed at John’s shoulder. John sidestepped, and the pipe slammed into the skip. His attacker was just enough surprised by that for John to shove
John could feel the swirl of Sherlock vibrating through him, radiating out with the music. He went down the hall. Sherlock still hadn’t given him keys to the flat. The suspicious part of John’s brain, the part that knew he’d been dragged off by strangers hunting werewolves while he was in a warzone, was starting to suspect there was an ulterior motive to that, as John might be less likely to leave the flat if he couldn’t lock up, and unable to lock up without Sherlock would theoretically mean that he would be most likely to leave the flat with Sherlock… but that was a cracked line of reasoning if he’d ever tried one. Sherlock hadn’t bothered locking the door when John left. Opening the door intensified the sound and the feelings.
The lead scientist - John realized that though he’d been told the man’s name he couldn’t recall it, just another body on the floor in their wake - had come to him just before the moon.
There were things that would have to happen to fit John into Sherlock’s life, to physically shoehorn him into the flat and make it more livable by his standards. And there was John’s family to see to, because Harry would be calling (she was a Watson, afterall). And if it had been over twenty days, then it would be just about the time for the moon, which meant going back out to Wiltshire. But they would work all that out later. They had time.
that was what happened to the tea. So it didn’t matter that there was a kettle he could put on the hob, because his tea had gone from evidence to break room supplies at the Met and he would honestly rather drink piss than try that mint again.
His stomach clenched at the thought of with whom he had been sleeping previously. He closed his eyes, hoping to escape the reality of the empty room, and was treated with images of Sherlock - Sherlock defiant and naked during their captivity, snarling angrily at their captors when they attempted to take John away.
Sometime later, after a shower in a surprisingly immaculate bathroom, John frustrated himself to sleep. It was the only way there was of describing it, because he neither fell into sleep nor did he pass out. He exhausted his way right into it, taken by the agitating lack of ache.
Sherlock stripped out of his coat, still full of energy that John found he couldn’t match. His eyes drifted again in the direction of the laboratory, and he fell silent.
That was impressive no matter how many times Greg saw it in action. When Sherlock was on a rant, he spoke in a single unending sentence so filled with logic it was like an assault with a physical weapon rather than just words.
Sherlock's responding erection was nudging against John's leg, even through all the clothes, but when John reached for him, Sherlock caught his wrist and kissed it.
His mate came back, tossed a roll of gauze on the bed. Sherlock was no doctor, but the worst of what had happened was past. Agile fingers smoothed antiseptic across the angry wounds, and then the gauze was up and wrapped. The whole procedure was done first on his right arm where the damage was worse, and then repeated on his left.
The contact was a shock, a rush of warmth that seared away the cold that had stolen into him. Impossibly, all at once, the ache vanished and took every kind of pain he had named (and several he hadn’t) with it.
John flopped back against his pillow for a moment, closing his eyes in an attempt to get back to sleep.
Sherlock wasn’t even sure what it was. One minute he was languishing in his flat, focused on ignoring the dearth of John and the ache of being without him, and the next the ache was something harsher. It was raw, it was huge, it was a gaping chasm that Sherlock teetered on the edge of.
“Bullshit, Sherlock,” John interrupted. “You were fine just now until you thought about it. I know. It’s impossible for me not to. You broadcast your emotions so loud it’s like standing in the sun.”
John could see the hole in the mess set aside specifically for him, they had strongly disagreed about the state of the sitting room – when was that? Could it have only been the day before?
Sherlock stepped forward, crowding John against the counter. Instinctively, John put his hands around Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock curled down to breathe against his ear, “As you wish, John.”
The little stand off with Mycroft came to mind, and John felt a surge of annoyance. John thought he was doing a remarkably good job at withholding his temper. He didn't even roll his eyes, and the sigh never made it past his lips, but he thought them.
John’s mate plucked the clothes off of him with careful fingers and stowed them in plastic bags that looked surprisingly like those the police collected evidence in. Then, when John was down to his pants in the middle of their poor living room that sported only the one arm chair, the bloody couch and the disorganized tumult of Sherlock’s filing system, John was left standing in the chill of the room.
"My brother is fairly... protective," Sherlock said, squeezing his shoulders before stepping over to the other set of scrubs to pull them on. "It's a terrible habit of his."
His silence spurned Sherlock onward. “The police must be particularly incompetent this time, though considering the ham-fisted detective who interrogated me, I’m not surprised.”
John didn’t even need to close his eyes and focus on it. The words tumbled out of his mouth as though he’d been ordered. “Turned on.”
Sherlock sagged in his grip for a moment and then shifted until he could look down at John, “Do you? You seem so angry about everything, and so calm about being separated.”
- the clench lessened in his gut. The weight of exhaustion faded enough that John could feel the weight of himself. All those unnamed hurts -
The cot was close, and John slumped onto it, turning on his side against the roiling sensation inside. At the same time his mind raced with wondering. What was Sherlock doing, just then? Where was he? Was he still in Wiltshire with his parents, or had he returned to London? Sherlock had spoken so fondly of London that it was hard to imagine him lingering in the country. Something about that didn’t fit the image that John was constructing of his mate. The house in Wiltshire just didn’t seem the sort of place that would hold Sherlock’s attention for long.
how alive they were. John could feel every burst of pleasure just as Sherlock felt it, and as his hands gripped the sheets her could feel the echo of his pleasure in Sherlock. The tempo of it became their hearts racing one another as the shock of pleasure echoed back and forth through them.
The conversation at the table was… oddly strategic, John thought. Rawden was absent from his seat, but Elisabeth presided over them from her end of the table.
from Sherlock was completely devoid of any arousal. His mate’s touch was almost clinical. There was still a great intensity, a focus like John had never come across before, but all Sherlock did was… inspect him.
It was not bright in their bedroom, but as John straightened he could see a flush of color on Sherlock’s high cheekbones. When he caught John looking, Sherlock turned and began to undress himself.
A twitch in response, then a yank, and Sherlock attempted to rear up in protest. Mycroft expected it, so he was able to ignore it. Sherlock managed to pull his head up enough to get a gasp of air before Mycroft pressed his advantage. Twisting his fingers in his brother’s hair, Mycroft pushed Sherlock’s face back down into the water.
Just that was enough to obliterate the annoyance, and all the talk fell away and John felt the same need that he had after their argument.
That got a little laugh out of John. He reached for a mug from the cabinet and his hand spasmed. The mug clattered first to the countertop and then fell to the floor, raining more of Sherlock’s detritus from the countertop around John’s feet and exploding into a myriad of pieces of mug on the kitchen floor.
John led the way into the sitting room, but Sherlock passed him, moving to scoop several books from the couch. The sitting room had been an unfortunate victim of the case, towards the end. A victim that John had not been entirely prepared to lose. Sherlock’s thoughts had scattered across the surfaces there.
Not only would John be reticent to respond, neither did Sherlock wish to share the answers with his brother.
"We'll stop in Dresden to have the subcutaneous trackers removed," Mycroft said, disdain seeping into his tone. "You'll forgive the delay, I hope, but I'd rather be clear of the Eastern Bloc before I subject either of you to another medical procedure."
For a moment Sherlock gave no argument. He pressed his face against John’s neck and rutted them together insistently. When he did things like that John was sure, even in his lust-gone mind, that it was the wolf in his mate that had him trapped and panting.
“If you’ve come here to warn us that they are on the outside of custody, you’re a bit late,” Sherlock said, sounding impatient.
- which was becoming a trend in John’s life that he could really do without. That edged him right back in favor of explosion over break down. The two sensations remained about neck and neck in the race for John’s final reaction. Rather than focus on it, he’d gone about defusing himself with the cunning application of tea.
Impossible you," Sherlock breathed him in again. "It could never have been anyone, it could only be you."
The implication in those words made John so angry he felt sick. He started to turn to reply to it, but Sherlock was quicker.
The last lips to brush his skin were Sherlock’s. The last scent of anyone in his nostrils was his mate and this man, in comparison, was a garbage heap worse than the one Sherlock had smelled like after that dumpster.
John hated how much better he felt with it shut, as though they had been exposed and vulnerable with it open.
“Bit distracted,” John said, finding a further impediment to liberating the up-ended kettle. It was stuck on something. John tightened his grip on the handle and gave it a yank. The kettle came free, but so did several of the larger pieces of glassware, followed by several of the smaller pieces with questionable stains on them. The glassware rolled across the countertop and then crashed to the floor in a small avalanche that quickly turned into a sea of shards very dangerous to bare feet. “Bollocks.”
From the look on Temperance’s face, she didn’t believe it. John knew she was wrong, but he knew a thing or two about appeasing hard to please siblings, so he sipped his tea and kept quiet.
The therapist wanted to talk about what had happened to him. It might have been prompted by the way John had taken to eating less and less at mealtimes, but that could be blamed on the selection. Most of the inhabitants of the bunk room were eating light.
It felt a hundred years ago when John and Harry had been children. That picnic in May with the four of them. John could still recall the color of their mother’s dress against the picnic blanket, bright like the sunshine before everything had gone to hell. His pace slowed as they entered the park. Even though it wasn’t a holiday, there were plenty of people in the park. For a moment, John thought he’d have trouble finding her.
The elevator made its way up to the third floor, and John noticed that Sherlock tracked any stranger with his eyes whenever they crossed their path. And it was
“Have your ‘trained’ ‘technicians’ figured out that the site of the body is not the scene of the murder yet?”
The orderly didn’t seem to notice the sincerity of his request. He just nodded sharply and exited the room, closing John in behind him as he went off to do his duty.
“It will make two of us then,” Sherlock replied. “If you absolutely must be out of the flat at this hour, you could at least have picked somewhere interesting.”
His whole body felt like it had been taken apart and put back together poorly. It was an uncomfortable sort of a feeling, the kind that had come over him when he’d been feverish after being rescued and reminded him of the gray days he was absent from Sherlock in Germany. For a brief moment he felt separated from his mate again, but as soon as he thought of Sherlock he could feel his mate’s presence, buzzing as though just on the peripheral of his senses.
Well, that ripped up the story entirely. While John could imagine Sherlock and Mycroft being siblings, it was much harder to picture Sherlock in a pack of them. John decided not to focus on that for the moment.
John put his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder, breathing carefully. Sherlock was so casual about it, like they were talking about planting window boxes or ordering tea. “And you think that makes it ok?”
“Of course they did,” Sherlock replied, quite simply. “Whoever splattered the scene did so with blood that had been cut. I believe the lab will come back with higher than normal traces of aminophthaloyl hydrazide.”
John stroked his hands against Sherlock’s chest, feeling the warmth of skin and the smoothness of silk, and he nodded. “It was awful.”
“I should have made a better story,” Sherlock muttered, entirely to himself. The sound of his voice was swallowed into the body of the refrigerator. He came away from the refrigerator with an armful of food. When he caught Mycroft inspecting it, he met his eyes and said, “Slimming?”
Sherlock was glaring at him from next to the fireplace. They hadn’t anywhere else to sit other than the couch, and none of them seemed to want to sit on the blood stained cushions.
“I’m sure that’s the trouble,” John muttered. “Not the murdering and the abuse, the lack of observation.”
. And instinct sent John to Sherlock just as readily as his free-will. That was an empowering feeling, knowing that he was what John turned to.
“You assume I don’t put it past your brother to have got you someone on-call to help manage your problem.”
Sherlock froze at the sight of the bandages, half-done with John’s clothing and not started on his own. That was as much of a bucket of cold water thrown on John’s desire as the harsh demand of, “What are
“They'll be talking about you," Sherlock murmured against his spine before licking a stripe up it. Clever fingers were busy elsewhere, pushing in and slipping back out in time with his words.
“Keep an eye out, would you John? I doubt you’d like to end up in the back of a patrol car, seeing as to how we’ve just gotten free of the onus of questioning from yesterday.”
Sherlock did not notice, at first, when John fell behind. Confident strides of his long legs took him clear across the shop while John lingered just inside the door, frozen in his tracks on the thick industrial carpet. He stared at the shop interior - the high ceiling, the modern fixtures evenly spaced overhead, the bright lights of the LED bulbs in them that left spots in his eyes when he looked up at them - and his breath stopped as well.
They were out of practice, but they knew each other’s bodies well. Sherlock let John set the pace, capturing John’s lips when he planted a hand on the back of the couch for a bit of balance. It felt too good, after so long. John had to close his eyes and try to distract himself to keep from losing it before Sherlock.
John didn’t offer comment because he wasn’t sure he wanted to know the information about Sherlock’s preferences second-hand from Horatio.
She was always good at pointing out the moods of her Watsons. Her pronouncements about Harry often ran to the tune of how she was
The day’s stress had been mostly slept off, but the warmth that was being kissed back into him brought with it the euphoria from earlier.
“Please,” Sherlock snorted, offering no explanation. Instead he tilted his head, looking back and forth along the walls around the dumpster. “He was hung here,” Sherlock said, gesturing to the front of the dumpster. “See that smudge? It’s blood, but there’s something else in it. Likely they haven’t tested it properly, but from the look of the scene they haven’t tested any of it properly. John, have you anything to take a sample?”
John had lost track of time in Germany. It was “waxing gibbous” the evening they had that row. When John stared at Sherlock for the term, Sherlock rolled his eyes and said simply, “Four days.”
Lestrade,” he snapped, “if your skills as a detective have led you to thinking that John is an abusive lover, then I have some very serious questions regarding your promotion.”
John thought about stripping his bedding and picking a different bunk, but he didn’t. He was unsettled enough by being away, he wasn’t going to let one prickly colonel start dictating his movements. Besides, despite the uneasy feeling that seemed to radiate off of him, the Colonel was also the most awake and aware person in the room. There was certainly nothing safe feeling about being near him, but he certainly had a presence to him…
He didn’t know what to put there. It could be called unfair, but was it? It wasn’t untrue, and because it wasn’t untrue he didn’t think it was entirely unfair. He stared at the wreck of the couch, looking at the spots where the half-assed job at cleaning the blood off had bleached the pattern away, and he sighed, feeling the abuse of the last few days as a bone-deep ache that culminated in a sharp pain in his shoulder.
Georgiana's mate was was a female werewolf by the name of Durga, who looked to be from India and had an accent to go along with it. She looked oddly familiar, but John couldn't place her. She was as friendly as Horatio, with an easy smile and a tendency to play peacemaker. They also lived in Bristol, and apparently Georgiana was a bank manager. Durga was in communications. Again, John got the impression that she had been an acquaintance of Mycroft’s.
"Don't let me interrupt the sibling rivalry," John said, fighting a yawn. Given the looks on their faces, John doubted he even could. It was ridiculouss that he was tired, they had done nothing but sleep for weeks. Well, sleep and have sex, but despite how athletic Sherlock could make that, it still wasn't the same as full body physical exertion. The closest they had come to that was the treadmill test, and Sherlock had taken the lion's share of that on himself.
He wished he couldn’t remember her sneaking him smokes or the two of them pouring out every bottle of liquor in the house the night that dad wrapped his car around that tree. He tried not to think of her smiling face or the first time he realized she’d gotten his haircut on purpose.
Sherlock’s breath caught, and he stiffened in John’s grip. His lips moved for a moment, but no sound came out.
a key to Sherlock’s flat on Montague Street, but he did not require a key to access anything. He was, after all, the more clever of the Holmes brothers, according to popular opinion, and it was not exaggeration to say that Mycroft did certain things
John gasped for breath, trying to shut his ears to the sounds of other members of the medical staff hurrying into the room to assess the damage done to the invalid soldiers. Sergeant Hall knelt over him, and John closed his eyes against the too-bright light as gentle fingers touched his arms.
A deceptively thin arm slid around John, and Sherlock pulled them both to their feet. “Let’s return, then.”
Sherlock repeated, rolling his hips against John’s. It was almost too much friction, but the source was worth it. “Turn over.”
and as you won’t talk about it, and it will solve a problem, the store is this way. Come along, John.”
for Sherlock, and he disliked thinking there were any so-glaring similarities between his mate and the infuriating man seemingly bent on goading John into some ill-advised act of physical violence.
Greg didn’t point out how obvious that was, instead he waited with a lifted brow for the technician.
John found himself standing in a room full of wolves. Well, Wolves would be more accurate. They were larger than any real wolf had a right to be, the adults anyway. By their positioning, John could tell who was who. Sherlock was the largest, darkest of them, though Anne’s coat was a similar inky black. There were three in shades of browns. It turned out that Mycroft’s coat had so much red in it that he was a sort of cinnamon ginger. Across the room, nearest the door sat Elisabeth, silver and white and with the same piercing eyes she had as a human.
“I… suppose it does,” John said, finally finding a reply he liked, “but I can’t exactly watch the way I look at Sherlock. I’m on the inside.”
What rushed through John’s system - entirely his own feelings, not nearly vibrant enough to be Sherlock’s - was adrenaline.
“What can we do for you today, sir?” a helpful clerk asked him, interrupting the vertigo that had taken over.
John had experienced the shock of that revelation at a most unfortunate moment. He had admitted to being feverish, undoubtedly the fevered dreams had featured nightmares of wolves, and while he had been recovering he was taken from the hospital to Russia. Given the travel times and the medication that would likely have been administered -- factoring in the fever when he was taken and the disruption in his treatment, as well as the healthily closed scar and normal body temperature John had when entering Sherlock's cell in Siberia -- it was likely that they had actually been taken within a reasonably short time from each other.
For a moment, John just stared at his mate’s bare ass as it disappeared into the sitting room. Then he realized that Sherlock had every intention of answering the door in all six feet of his birthday suit. He thought back to the defiant stance of his mate when addressing the scientists in their private prison, and he wondered if it was a wolf thing to be confrontational like that, or if there was something that he did not know about the his mate’s relationship with the Sergeant.
“You had not realized the number of days,” Sherlock said, speaking against his neck as nimble fingers undid the tie on John’s dressing gown.
“Mycroft was rather firm about not letting the rest lend a hand," Gerard said in the same soft voice. Nothing, of course, was going to be low enough to avoid the wolves’ hearing, but the attempt at a little privacy was obvious, and none of the wolves turned to regard either of them. “But they were all in rather a state to hear he’d been taken.”
“That was the assumption, but it was incorrect,” Sherlock said, closing his eyes and reliving the room. It didn’t bring the same rush of pleasure to see the crime scene in his mind, the clarity of the room he could reconstruct was cold and factual. It had been a messy scene, to be sure, but now that it was solved it was as dead and empty as the bodies it had held. “The police assumed from the chaos of the room that the escalated violence of the murder was caused by recognition on the part of the victim. It was a gruesome affair, seemingly the man had been attacked from two different angles, by two separate attackers.”
The stories passed around back and forth turned to 'when they were children'. That was about the point when Sherlock left the couch to stand apart from the others, leaving John seated among them.
John came back towards the area where Sherlock was gesturing at in agitation. He thought back to what he knew of field surgery, and the considerations of what the force of a cut might do to the spray, and concluded Sherlock was correct. His assessment didn’t slow down his mate’s explanation.
– fretting over the scattered remains of a rather brilliant series of deductions that had culminated in closing a very tricky case. No one else in the world could have solved what Sherlock had just solved in any feasible amount of time. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and leaned his head against Sherlock’s back. It was something he had longed to do before, but hadn’t the confidence to complete. Now he could only wish it was an act done in somewhat friendlier circumstances.
“Right,” John said, “does it work the other way around, then? For humans, I mean? Sherlock said something about... genetic predisposition to...” John wondered if he was cracked for even thinking this when Sherlock’s expression shifted and John got a rush of something that
“What do you mean, ‘Well, Milton’?” the man parroted back at Sherlock. The man - Milton - shrugged off John’s gentle attempt to get him to sit on the couch.
No, John told himself sternly. That was a dark, awful path to tread down in his thoughts and he wouldn’t be able to stop if he started and the end wasn’t something he could bring himself to even think about.
The last vial of his old preparation was kept tucked away secretly where neither Mycroft nor any of his other siblings or their mates might find it. It was carefully hidden, but ready for use.
It was early evening when he arrived, and the London St Pancras station was bustling with bodies moving to and from trains. John kept hold of his duffle and wandered through the crowds, buffeted by more determined walkers and the cacophony of voices echoing all around. Despite the improvement in his senses, or perhaps because of it, the volume of the station and the press of bodies was almost overwhelming.
“Larger than you,” Sherlock said absently, tilting John’s arm with gentle hands. He brought John’s other arm up, crossed them, but dismissed the positioning with a snort. As though dealing with puzzle pieces, Sherlock shifted them until they were in the choke hold John had used, and nodded. “You had to incapacitate someone. Another soldier, then, also invalidated from service, somehow. Larger than you, just look at the size of the gouts his nails made in your arms. Taller, as well.” Sherlock drew John’s forearm up and licked across the wound with a gentle tongue. “What was his name?” he murmured against John’s skin.
to some of his exes, but he wasn’t abusive. He knew what that was like and he was careful to keep a handle on the aggressive part of himself when it threatened to lash out.
“In this instance, I happened upon the scene of a murder. As I did not wish the personal scrutiny that would come from a close association with the crime scene, I found the nearest officer. CSO Lestrade was on patrol in the area. I took him to the scene.”
There seemed no room for discussion on the matter. Sherlock sulked the rest of the way through breakfast, despite John's attempts to draw him out of it. After breakfast, Elisabeth took John by the arm and they went for a walk out onto the grounds. The fresh air did wonders for John's nervous mood. After the initial standoff, John found Elisabeth's presence companionable. He rather liked her, and he'd only known her a few hours. John couldn't help but ask about Sherlock's reaction to him meeting 'the others'.
That night John slept in fits, if one could even call his rest sleeping. His mind was active, prowling through the shadowed woodland, buzzing with energy he felt he could barely contain. There were hours of night to be conquered, and he had the reign of it all: up hills and through trees, doubling back around outcroppings of rock, splashing first one direction and then the other up and down a stream.
And there, that was bemusement. The feeling was muted, just as the anticipation had been, as the curiosity was, but it was there. Almost like it was repressed or held back by something else.
Greg hesitated. It was hard to argue with Sherlock’s prioritizing of the situation, not matter how odd it was to see him putting a person so far up his list, but it would be negligent not to question him about a ny of Miltons other associates. The police had looked, but there was neither hide nor hair of those they were aware of. And he really did need to tell Sherlock about the two men who’d been let out. The men had made some wild accusations, about Sherlock, about Doctor Watson, and while the detectives on the case took them at face value, they sounded like
John could feel Sherlock come back into the doorway, but he wasn’t expecting him to flop down on top of him, what with not looking and all.
"Despite the unusual circumstances," Elisabeth said, her voice sharp, "your family will be pleased to meet your mate, Sherlock."
“Shock,” Sherlock said. “Blood loss and an unknown dose of what was undoubtedly a powerful hallucinogenic cocktail of some sort. The wounds he has aren’t deep, you needn’t bother.”
John closed his eyes, hoping for sleep but not counting on it, and let his thoughts wander as he checked himself over. Beneath the ache in his body, he still felt that sense of wrongness, as though he was adrift somehow, but there was no clenching of his stomach like when the feeling was at its worst.
Do you remember that time we all got grounded? Sherlock nearly hung himself with the curtains trying to make his escape!
“I better hurry then.” That got a laugh out of both of them. “Dorothy Hawkins, you’re one in a million.”
“That Watson fellow is either extraordinarily lucky, or fairly good at handling himself in a fight,” the technician said. “Look, here,” the woman said, turning the tablet she was working on for Greg to see.
Sherlock scowled, but his mouth snapped shut at the quiet request of the good doctor. Greg did his best not to stare, but couldn’t help wishing he could quiet the abrasive ex-addict similarly. Sherlock must have read that on his face, because he sneered at him and turned moodily away, crouching down to scan the pavement.
“Right, and I can’t… my brain doesn’t get that. All the medical training and all the A&E experience I have says you’re wrong.” Sherlock took a deep breath, but John continued on, quickly, “But all of that also can’t make heads or tails of you being a werewolf either.”
John made it to the front door, but he only got it a few inches open before it was slammed shut by a long-fingered hand. John squared his shoulders and set his jaw. "Let go of the door, Sherlock."
Sometimes what he anticipated as simple became difficult. The aftermath of that introduction was still echoing through their relationship.
hold Sherlock’s hand. He wanted to climb into him, or, alternatively, onto him so he could be carried home.
"For the record," John said, drawing both gazes towards him, "I'm fine. Aside being randy like a second former, that is."
Either one was useless, considering the volume with which he was speaking. Sherlock’s voice cut straight through the door. “Don’t be absurd,” he began, all his consonants sharp and his vowels clipped. “Honestly, Mycroft, I’d given you more credit than this. Years ago, Mycroft,
“But it has been documented. You know, on documents. By New Scotland Yard,” John pointed out. “Some Sergeant that Sherlock knew came by and said we weren’t to leave town. They took the guy-”
“Routinely. More often when the person I’m talking to refuses to do it.” The sergeant folded his arms and frowned. “I meant what I said, Sherlock. I don’t care if your brother is the bloody Queen herself, if any of this has to do with any combination of you and an illegal substance in the present tense, I will haul you to jail for it. They can sort you right into rehab, and then I’ll wash my hands of this.”
What Greg knew about Dr. Watson, beyond that, was very little, but the man seemed steady. Perhaps a little overwhelmed by his circumstances, but certainly not a threat of any kind. He didn’t deserve the sour, heartless detective that was questioning him. He deserved better.
Once the worst of the case Sherlock had been engaged in was over, the gore cleaned up and the suspects tucked away properly, Lestrade shook John’s hand in the same friendly manner that he had the entirety of their acquaintance, and thanked him, stating that thanking Sherlock was unlikely to get him more than a snort in response.
“I know your measurements,” Sherlock replied, eyes taking a path down his body appreciatively, “and you spend so much time sleeping that any idiot could place an online order.”
“Captain Watson,” she said in an empty voice, “I need you to come with me. You’re bleeding, Captain. Are you alright?”
Sherlock's arm slid around his middle. John didn't fail to notice the possessiveness of it, but felt reassured by his mate's closeness, especially in the face of the last question Sherlock had fired off.
“You are the last of anyone I should expect would forget my ability to manage surveillance is independent of my physical presence at a monitoring station,” Mycroft replied.
"Uncle, you don't understand," Aldrich insisted, shaking his head. He did not have his uncle’s towering stature, but was at least as tall as Mycroft. "Now certainly isn't the time to gather us all in one place, even for something like this."
As quickly as it came, the moment passed. The thoughts felt alien to him, as though they belonged to some other John Watson.
that was present when he did it. He clenched his fist, feeling the tightening of the bandage and the pull of the wound as a pleased little sting against the emptiness of the room. “It’s not the cut.”
It was awkward, when Harry let go, but there was an awful lot of awkward between them anyway. John nodded to her, shouldered his pack and the two of them made their way out onto the street.
“For heaven’s sake, Mycroft, it’s not what you think,” Sherlock said as he answered it, turning for the bedroom. A scowl took over his expression as he walked. “I’ve explained-”
A constable had taken the initial dispatch. The whole street wasn’t marked off as the eccentric ex-addict’s (hopefully ex, or he had no problem turning the man in for it this time) private territory. It wasn’t until that particular building became the scene of the disturbance, and until the blood in the stairwell led right up to the man’s door.
"They are talking about you because you survived, but that isn't why, John. It makes you a curiosity, it will be an asset if anyone questions why I chose a human, but it has very little to do with the thing," he said, voice sounding entirely too sober and too serious.
Sherlock snorted loudly. “Milton is many things, not the least of them a simpleton, but he is not an open case. He was in a brawl outside a bar, likely with his supplier whom he regularly pays inadequately, apparently his usual methods for making up the difference have fallen short. He would not have these problems if he did not put a percentage of his product into himself or others vaguely interested in intercourse with him.”
“It was a crime, John,” Sherlock replied, growing impatient. “One that had apparently started as a robbery and escalated. There had been robberies in the area at the time, and I was there long enough to overhear that the method of entry was the same, but something had changed about the robbers, because they’d put an end to the middle-aged man they’d smeared across the walls.”
The very practical doctor living inside John was pleased to be validated in his assumptions. It did nothing for the uncomfortable feeling of wrongness that lingered in him or the sense memory of the miserable little cot. “It’s ok,” John said, “I’m a doctor, too.”
Harry found him by the exit they’d always met at when they were younger. She took one look at him and ushered them both out into the street.
They stared at one another, silently. Sherlock had what John was starting to think of as his immovable expression on. The trouble with it was that Sherlock did not seem to grasp how stubborn John could be right back. “How in the seven hells can someone so observant miss something so painfully
Sherlock’s jacket was off, and his shirt sleeves were pushed up haphazardly, as though he had been too jittery to roll them. His dark, curly hair was messed, as though his hands had been shoved into it repeatedly. The gesture was something John had not seen Sherlock do first hand, but he could imagine it happening during the conversation with Mycroft.
“Not here,” John huffed, relaxing as Sherlock’s arms both came up around his waist. “We’ve a perfectly good bed not ten meters to your left.”
“Why don’t you go set up your lab, then?” John asked, feeling a smile tug at the corners of his lips. “You’re lusting after it.”
Sherlock ended the call, and when the phone made another awful noise almost immediately, he held down a button that seemed to power it off completely.
His temper wasn’t settled down just yet, and he knew better than to go back before the words he wanted to say to Sherlock were in something other than all caps with exclamation points as the only punctuation when he thought them in his mind.
“Of course,” John said, smiling up at his husband. “If you’ll excuse me, Lestrade.” And then he took Sherlock’s waiting elbow, pleased for all sorts of reasons, not the least of which was the rather late hour and for most of the day there had been no time to stop for any sort of nourishment beyond the cup of tea Lestrade had sent for hours ago.
to Greg. Especially as it was beginning to look like all the associates Sherlock had been questioned about had disappeared in a manner similar to Milton. If that was the case, and Sherlock knew something - and Sherlock
Unfortunately for my geographical accuracy, my history classes did not actually cover the Cold War. (I wish I was lying, but I've got a master's degree and nope, never broke 1776 in American history, and I had to quit the Russian history class almost as soon as Rasputin did away with the Romanovs.)
“It happens from time to time,” Sherlock replied. He took John by the shoulder and ushered him gently back into the bedroom. “Get dressed.”
Sherlock snorted loudly. John stared and tried to form some sort of protest or some sort of question, he wasn’t sure which.
“Also, the blood would have painted the skip, enough to have had forensics confiscate it. As it remains, logically the only blood present is what was on it at the scene less the amount that washed off in the light rain from last night. Therefore, while the body was placed here, staged by some party or-” he tipped his head, regarding the blood splattered on the brick, “more likely
