“Okay Sherlock this isn't looking great but I can get you stabilized enough to keep you not only alive but awake to.” as he speaks he beings removing his belt from its loops and taking his jacket off he looped the belt around Sherlock's leg and tightened it trying his hardest not to stop when Sherlock screams from the pressure, gritting his teeth he tells them both that this is the only way. Setting the jacket under his leg to try to stop the bleeding caused by gravity from the exit wound. He had seen injuries similar back in Afghanistan and knew that time was of the essence.
Sherlock was about to interject with a story similar to the one John was talking about when he felt Johns foot touch his under the table. For a moment neither moved each judging the others reaction when Johns toe moved the slightest bit and a small smile creep to his face similar to the one he had earlier in the night after seeing that Sherlock had set up the kitchen so. Sherlock had an overwhelming want to stand and walk around the table to Johns side and kiss him, kiss him for coming back and being his again, kiss him for getting dinner and not freaking out at the display of domesticity that waited his return, to kiss him for his awful musical taste and for all the years he had been here for Sherlock, to thread his fingers into Johns short blonde hair speckled with grey after such a trying two years to stand him up and wrap his arms around Johns waist and back and neck and to breathe him in and memorize the feel of Johns lips and the taste of him after Indian food. That smile could ruin Sherlock if John wanted it to, the tiniest hint of teeth below his lips, which turned up on one side more than the other. It was encapsulating. Sherlock let out a breathe he didn’t know he’d taken let alone held for a good minute, coming back down to the present he felt Johns toe still playing under the table and decided to throw a small amount of caution out the window and play back with his own toe. He wasn’t nearly as controlled as John and the movements were slightly uncoordinated but the fact that he was doing it made him a little light headed, this was the thing to set the night into the realm of prefect, contact, just the fact that he was touching John under the table while that smile played on his face was incredible he never thought he’d get to do this. He didn’t even care that the awful song had come back on shuffle.
Sherlock is crying with abandon now, burning tears leaving stains down his cheeks and neck. John is staring at him no masks up no defenses just pure love, pure honesty in his words and Sherlock feels that the truth might kill him before the bullets do. His breath catches as he thinks that and the tears flow faster and hotter than before when he fully realizes that he’s about to die that the life John had imagined for them won’t be something they get to experience.
Sherlock snorted.
“Mrs Hudson, I’m guessing,” I said as I let go.  “I am sorry for loitering.  I was early.”
"Private at least," Lestrade answered, throwing down a rope.  "Not sure what jurisdiction we're under at the minute.  How badly injured are you?"
John pressed one more kiss between Sherlock’s wings and opened his eyes.  Pale light caught the sheen on Sherlock’s flushed skin, tendrils of dark curls clinging to it.  John leaned back.  The light shimmered blue and green and gold over the iridescent feathers that fanned out from the base of Sherlock’s wings, curving over the shoulders and covering the shafts of the first of the rows of long, dark blue feathers.  John could not see their tips nor Sherlock’s legs as the wings curved forward, brushing the stones.
I gazed as he moved closer, cards forgotten.
He lay on his back, one arm flung to the side, the other bent, its hand at the base of his throat.  A silver knife, with a twisted blade and a moonstone surmounting its hilt, protruded from his left eye.
“Exactly,” Sherlock replied, turning to look along the bannister.  “But I haven’t seen them so luxuriant in a while.”
I shoved my feet into my slippers, snatched my dressing gown off its hook, and hurried after him.  From the hall, through the library and the passageway to the music room, I followed, Sherlock always just disappearing around the next corner or through the next doorway.
Charlie, and several people I did not recognise, passed by with a smiling nod to Kit and I, and stepped up on the window seat next to us and disappeared into Summer’s sunny evening.
Indeed, I don’t.
“You are a fortunate man, John Watson,” Sherlock said, scooping up a few of the fallen rocks and dropping them into my palm.
“Yes,” Sherlock said.
John shucked his trousers.  They caught on the corner of the wooden chest that was his coffee table, coins tumbling from the pockets unheeded.  He unbuttoned his shirt without removing it and slipped under the covers.
But John didn’t touch.  He slipped from the bed; shut the door to the loo without even a click. Tepid water and shampoo washed the sweat and grime of the chase away.  He stood, eyes closed, massaging his scalp long after the bubbles had swirled down the drain as though he could wash the images from his brain.
The mattress dipped as Sherlock sat down on the edge of it.  “I hope that your vision of an afterlife holds more pleasures than hot tea and freshly-buttered toast.”
“Oh, I would have recognised Dr Watson anywhere,” Dean Bradley said, shaking my hand.  “I am an avid reader of your stories.  Glad, however, that ours has not appeared.”
Sherlock lathered his hands and started washing the inside of John’s thigh.
“He was such a handsome man.”  She sighed.
“He almost succeeded,” Sherlock remarked.  “He only needed a way for the images to be viewed without being exposed to the air.”
Yes.  And his breath and blood as well.
I looked up.  His dressing gown was half off; the journal still in hand.  This close I could see the pulse at his throat.
I rested my cheek on the top of his head.  “Can this be explained in bed,” I asked.  “My mind is awake, but my body isn’t.”
“Would you draw some blood for me?  I want another control,” he said.
Sherlock nodded.  He was tracing the veins from my wrist to the inside of my elbow.
“Did my jacket appear furry to you?  Did I have a translucent tail?”
I suppose I looked hurt when I glanced up at him.
The walls about us echoed with the sound.
“You’re creating a story,” he said.  He moved behind me to the corner near Roderick’s inscription.
Sherlock’s hand closed about my ankle and he leaned down.
I glanced at the ceiling.  The sky between the tree branches was darkening, more stars gleaming against the deep blue.
The man’s face was contorted with pain, his lips moving silently.
Sherlock rolled me over, arms to either side of my shoulders.  “She’s been feeding you for nearly two years and she always wears this fragrance.”  He waved his fingertips beneath my nose.
“People with a cart have a broken wheel along the northern path.  I’ll send Wiggins to help,” Sherlock said.  “Wait here.  I’ll only be a moment.”
“They are renowned for their black swans,” Sherlock said.
“So that’s how they maintained the fiction for so long.  Madeline would come to London when Simpson would be back in England, which was not that often.  Wouldn’t the staff here wonder about the bloke that died here?”
“One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,
“Won’t be for much longer though,” Mrs Hudson said, watching the pair, too.  She looked up at the ceiling.
I shook my head and threw a crumpled bit of newsprint at him.
“I’m sorry,” I whispered.
Unlike Sherlock and I, some had kept their torches and held them high.  The flickering of their flames shed an unsteady glow over us.  Faces blinked in and out of the existence as they passed.
I frowned at him and realised he had a shoe in hand: a soft leather shoe, covered in embroidered leaves and flowers and birds.  I moved my foot out from under the table.
I was walking towards it when Sherlock bounded past me and onto the stage.  “Hey,” I called as he disappeared through the arches at the back.  I ran around to the steps and hurried after him.
That sentiment won’t be going on the blog.
He held his arms out to his sides.  “Yes, Doctor,” he said and moved no further.
His dragon reared up on his shoulder, unfolding his silvery wings.
He leaned further over me, rested his hand, palm up, on the table by the top of the drawing.  It pressed his abdomen against my shoulder.  His sheet slipped.  There was a warm, sleepy smell about him.  I inhaled.
Already accustomed to that habit, I set about arranging my pillows.  When I had them positioned to my satisfaction, I laid my head down by his hip, pulled the duvet up to my ears and draped an arm over his thighs beneath it.  “Find the solutions to any cold cases yet?” I enquired from my cocoon.  The duvet pulled tighter over my shoulder as his arm settled behind my back, his hand at my waist.
I slipped a bolt from my quiver into place, aimed to the side of where the harpoon pierced the creature and released the string.
“You should have a doctor on hand.”
“You’ll be able to judge for yourself eventually.”
He picked up another strawberry, bit it and touched the rest to my mouth.
Sherlock adjusted the lever.  “Could be.  Their bearers won't bother you, if you give them a wide berth during mating season.”
Sherlock had draped his coat over the back of the sofa and seated himself upon it.  “That incident would be a good place to resume your story, Ms Swann.”
My gaze swept over him again.
The thumps grew weaker.  The boat began to tip in the opposite direction.  Dark shadows were sliding over the gunwale behind Sherlock.
“Such as?” he prompted.
“A highly commendable first effort, John.  Making a gap in it and lifting it took some effort.”
“Overdue?” Sherlock offered and I opened an eye to look at him.
“John I love you more than anything, always have,always will, please, tell me about our life together please tell me about all that you wanted from it, give me happy thoughts happy memories.”
“Are you alright there Sherlock” John started from the living room still taking off his coat and shoes before he made his way into the kitchen. “You seemed a little shocked by my return. Did I interrupt some tangent thought you were having that was sure to break the case wide open?” John asked still not having made his way to the kitchen. Sherlock couldn’t figure why he hadn’t yet, it took John at the most one minute and 47 seconds to remove his outer layers and the man hadn’t started upstairs to change as his voice was still coming from the living room.
John, used to this behaviour, simply stated again that it was past eight and he knew that Sherlock hadn’t eaten all day, and that he was going down to the Indian restaurant a couple blocks down for some curry and wanted to know what Sherlock wanted as well.
John hadn’t thought the night could have turned out any better. Between the nervous Sherlock- which was always a treat because he almost never got to see that-, to the table being clean and set with those damn candles, to the music that made Sherlock smile as he hummed along to it, the food being delicious and the fact that Sherlock just kept listening all night to his stories and finally the touch under the table. John had thought for a second that in that moment he would have been found out, all the unintentional stares at Sherlock’s mouth all night to the breath he took in when their hands touched for the fleeting second they did so, the goofy smile that kept playing at Johns mouth the kind he couldn’t seem to get rid of when Sherlock acted out of character and did something sweet. He was so sure that Sherlock was going to deduce the hell out of him, discover how John really felt and then call him out on it. His heart clenched again at the thought, he couldn’t handle losing Sherlock again not when it would have been his own fault this time, but damn when his foot connected with Sherlock’s at dinner he was momentarily petrified at the thought of being asked about it or worse being asked to leave for thinking that there was even possibly something there. He had looked at Sherlock instantaneously when it happened to gage his reaction, then his toe switched- still touching Sherlock’s foot- and his heart sunk thinking that was it, he tried to play it off with a sly smile acting like it was an accident but when Sherlock didn’t move his foot or comment on it John got a little more confident and tried the stroke of his toe again. In that moment John saw something in Sherlock’s eyes that said he was not only thinking but also playing out a scene in his head he decided that a distracted Sherlock was probably not a bad thing, thinking that he was imagining a part if the case as he often did in the middle of an activity or conversation John continued with the movement. Moments later as John was looking down at his plate that smile- that he was sure could see right through- still on his face, he heard Sherlock exhale in a long breath and add his own toe to the mix. John was dumbfounded, he had never expected Sherlock to join in, but here he was the movements were a little jerky and unsure but the touch and the fact that Sherlock was at least open to the idea of playing footie’s was a damn miracle to John. He had spent so much time thinking about trying something like this, he had had so many opportunities, their feet were always so close when they sat in their chairs and on the couch it would have been easy enough to try it in the back of a taxi as they had begun sitting close together but each time he worried only about the consequences if he did attempt the contact.
“Do you want to watch a movie?” John asked timidly, after the night they’d had John wanted to have Sherlock come closer to him rest his shoulder blade against Johns chest and shoulder snuggle in a bit and watch the movie. John wanted to smell Sherlock’s hair to put his hand so close to Sherlock’s that a single muscle twitch would connect their skin.
It happened one night on a case. A stakeout gone hours longer than they’d planned for, the London chill set deep in their bones as they wait, Sherlock still save for the nervous energy seen in the twitch of his hands and the stretch of his neck. John ready to be done, ready to be back at Baker Street warm and comfortable, sitting in their chairs, talking about the case over a cup of tea.
The man they were waiting for rounds the corner and before they can comprehend what tipped the man off to their position pops of gunfire ring out Sherlock is yelling telling John to cover the other side box him in. But before John can act on those orders the firing stops and John knows the suspect is getting away so he rounds back to Sherlock hoping he’ll have a plan of action as to how to catch up with him.
When Sherlock heard the key turn in the door below he jumped a little suddenly doubting all that he had done because, what if John got the right idea or thought Sherlock a fool for interpreting his friendliness for anything other than that, what if he left again, Oh! Sherlock though, what have I done I’ve ruined it all! Sherlock was pacing a little, feeling as though his heart had moved strangely south and that his stomach had been shoved away as a result, as John climbed the last few steps to the flat, but stilled the instant John entered the room. He stood in the doorway obviously a little confused as to why Sherlock had immediately stopped when he had opened the door, but Sherlock only walked forward to grab one of the bags of food before John could say anything. Walking quickly into the kitchen Sherlock panicked about the reaction John would have at the sight of the table and while facing away from the entrance John was going to come though he began to unpack the takeaway.
“ you forgot again, you git” John said with no hint of harshness to his words, and grinning like an idiot, Sherlock realized that he hadn’t picked up the milk from the store like he was supposed to.
“Oh ya sorry ‘bout that must have slipped my mind” he said back a little sheepishly. He felt better when John only laughed at him a little, knowing that John wasn’t mad at him made things better. He didn’t enjoy it when he made John mad.
“We could have been so happy for so long Sherlock, solving mysteries until our hair went grey and our knees popped every time we stood.”
Sherlock smiled more than he ought to at this statement; obviously John doesn’t mind the effort. John doesn’t seem to mind the candles either, this is better than Sherlock had hoped it would be, not only was John not running for the hills but he enjoyed the change. Sherlock had to remind himself that enjoying the effort of setting a tale did not mean that John felt anything towards him. That didn’t stop him from being happy though.
“John,” he starts praying his voice won't give up on him just yet, “from the day you walked into the lab at Bart's I was hooked, having your eyes on me was better than any high any drug could ever provide for me, Mike knew it, everyone did. From that first case I scarcely let myself imagine what our life could be if I took a leap of faith, trusted what my deductions gave as proof, allowed myself the terrifying possibility of getting hurt because what if it all worked out. But I never did, like you said to much of an idiot to do it. Its something I’ll never forgive myself for not in this life, not in the next not in any of them.” His voice had become hoarse airy and he’s struggling to breathe by the end of his confession but the look of pure adoration on John's face makes it worth it.
“Oh no nothing like that, the dirt samples haven’t been analyzed yet so the case is at a stand still for the time being” Sherlock stated hopefully not showing his nervousness in his voice. Desperately wishing he hadn’t gone so far to make the table look like it was set for a date and not a dinner between two platonic friends which it should have been to not but John off.
“I’ll love you forever John Watson please never forget that.”
“Growing old together? That’s what you wanted?”
----------
Mycroft Holmes always knew but never accepted that he would outlive his baby brother. His brothers habit of running into danger with no regard for his safety, his affinity to mess with science, chemistry especially, and the addiction that had stolen his brother away for so long and had kept Mycroft awake worrying for days.
“Sherlock, Sherlock hey look at me okay don't look down look here right in my eyes, Mycroft knows he’ll be here any minute we just have to hold on until then.”
Sherlock nods weakly not breaking eye contact with John, he begins to recite chemical formulas. John snaps into action,dialling Mycroft's number and letting the call sit there knowing he’ll be able to find them, assessing the wound the rate of blood flow and carefully checking for an exit wound, his heart sinks when he sees blood seeping from another hole at the back of his leg the mangled flesh even worse than the wound at the bullets entrance.
Sherlock not really knowing what to do followed John into the room and sat on the couch as well, slightly farther than normal John noted unhappily.
“An hour or so.  You have good eyes, you may discern me well before that,” Sherlock replied.
Point.
She is rather extraordinary, our Mrs Hudson.  I thought of her moving about that very room on her hands and knees whilst bullets whizzed over her head. For far from the first time, I marvelled at the strengths that Holmes calls forth in his friends.
I stepped into the cage of the old lift.  I had ridden in it once before when Mrs Hudson had shown me the various cellars.  Sherlock and I had taken the stairs around it to the firing range.
Setting the glass pot aside, she picked up a scratched and dented one, turning it around in her hands and smiling at it.  “As you can see, this one gets used a lot.  It’s tin and fine for mixtures with only a few, plain ingredients.  Heats them quickly and evenly, but mind you use a cloth or thick glove to hold the handle as it’s tin, too.”
Sherlock smiled and rolled onto his side to stare into the silvery bowl.
Kit found another piece of meat and dropped it down to Midnight.  “I think Mrs Hudson will be wanting me down in the kitchens soon.”
I picked up a warm piece of toast and stared at it.
“Not at all what I had expected.”
Sherlock shut the door behind us and the torchlight grew brighter.
“Wait!” I called.
Once more, I pressed the heated pot against my dressing gown and with a steady pressure pulled the brass lever beside the lift down.  The brass curlicues that form its door, opened.  I inched over the threshold and gently pushed the lever inside up.  The cage descended.
“About a month before…you know…Sherlock paid two years’ worth of rent in advance...all of it…not only his share,” she said.
My dagger was in my hand before I had finished drawing in another tainted breath.  I sliced through seams and ripped linen.  Jaws firmly attached to Sherlock’s shoulder, a glistening, bloated leech wriggled in the air.  A filigree of grey lines was spreading outwards from where it adhered.  It should be too soon for the wound to be necrotising, but the stink of the other leech made me doubt.  Before my eyes, the leech’s hind mouth attached to Sherlock’s flesh.
“I haven’t usually been faced with identity problems when making my diagnoses,” I heard myself say and felt rather proud at having produced such a long and relevant sentence in such a calm, professional voice.
Considering the number of scandals in the press, hacking must have become a common skill since I’d been away.  I looked at his hands again.  His fingers were interlaced and I thought he might be keeping them in check, motion seemed to be their natural state from the little I had seen.  Images of them pulling coins out of the air or plucking scarves from people’s pockets in spills of cards and keys, guns and knives flashed through my mind.
He smiled a little more at that.  “Then, you must open yourself for me…”  He added a word I could barely hear, in a language I didn’t know, but its sound pleased me nonetheless.
I turned to face him.  Set each foot before the other, gently and carefully.
“At least the larger pieces, yes,” he replied.  “Fifteen years ago, Swann had been a summer intern in the conservation department.  It’s in the sub-basement.  He would have been most familiar with the storage areas on that level.”
“We wouldn’t want you to fall in.”
My hand closed about my dagger.  A second later there was a thud.  Sherlock drew back.  My blade quivered in the wood of the bench less than two fingers' breadth from where his face had been.  Pinned by the point of the dagger, a small, serpentine thing writhed.  It did not appear to be attached to anything other than the wood.
“Well,” I replied, “I wouldn’t want us to be the first.”
“Not your usual thorn, then,” I commented, taking the shoe off my other foot and slipping it into the water by its wounded mate.  “This helps.”
“A little.  Up high,” he replied and crouched down to study the pot.
~~~~~~ooo0ooo~~~~~~
He interrupted my introspection to whisper, “And you have to want to.”
He was already seated in the skiff, which bobbed in a few centimetres of water next to a stub of a post protruding from the shingle before the grassy slope leading up to the walkway in front of what had been Traitor's Gate.
“You left it in the laboratory,” Mr Holmes said.  “You don’t need it.  The limp is psychosomatic, as your therapist has told you.  About this, she is right.”
When she came down again
“Waxing poetic, brother mine?” Mycroft said.
“Not readily adaptable for the violin, but I have the recording.”
Yet I could not be certain that such had been his intent and I was loath to misconstrue.  So new was this aspect of our life that no routine had been established, no glossary of terms defined, no signs or signals agreed upon and although I have never considered myself a boorish lover, nor encountered any indication that my former partners had ever thought of me thus, I feared with Holmes that I could misstep and cause a door so recently opened, to be shut and barred.
John sank further down in the chair, hands folded over his full belly, elbows on the armrests, legs akimbo.
Sherlock brought the little table with the food on it over to me.  When he set it in place, his dressing gown fell open.  It was a good look on him.
His forearm was like iron across my abdomen, his legs like vices either side of mine as he thrust.
“So you are admitting that you were dreaming about me?” John said, leaning in and closing his lips around a rosy nipple.
He sat back.
Then, the years scattered us.  All round the world it seemed.  Murray had ended up in Afghanistan, too, and that had been lucky for me.
I turned to look at him.  The position of his arms expanded his chest.  It strained at the buttons of his tapered shirt, cut to fit his fine lines.   He was like a piece of art, a dancer holding an elegant pose before a leap or a spin.  I wasn’t sure I could bring myself to touch him, so perfect he seemed in himself, as he was.
Sherlock pictured spinning the silk, anchoring John to the bed.  The boughs weren’t strong enough to hang him there.  He would not wrap him up completely though.
One elevated eyebrow was his answer.
Even that limited view vanished when Mr Holmes shut the panel that had swivelled to allow us to enter.  The darkness was silent and my eyes and ears were adjusting to both when the room exploded into light and there was a loud noise of astonishment which had come from me.
The woodwinds called.
He nodded.
You're being strangely positive today.
The fire wasn’t large, but it was hot; the wood at the bottom a fierce orange that ignited fresh kindling in an instant, and larger branches soon enough.  Our little band was gathered around it, quietly drinking and eating, although Kit kept popping up to gather more deadwood from the edge of the clearing and Bert would go after him if he stayed away too long.
“Oh, I don’t think you will,” Sherlock said.
He smiled.  “Exactly.”
I took another sip of tea and picked up the knife. The smear of blood on it was disappearing into the blade.  “What is it made of?”
Sherlock tapped his wings together.  “Father implies the honour is imminent, but it never happens, so he still has Puck under control,” Sherlock finished.
Sherlock paused the video.
I couldn’t look away.  “I thought it was mine.”
“John,” he said.
“Exactly,” Sherlock said, dropping the cloth and holding out his hand.
I closed my hand around it and heard my neighbour’s voice - turn it gently, the tiniest bit at a time.
His hand opened, curved around one buttock.
He went out to the sitting room, fell back to sleep by the hearth.
“Coffee table,” he said, back towards me.
“Twins,” he said, without glancing away from his task.  “One born a few minutes before mid-night, the other after.”
“We’ve been preparing to face it together,” he said.
Ms Swann avoided John’s eyes.
“I don’t think so,” Sherlock replied and his smile was audible in his voice.
I checked on Sherlock again.
“After another period of silent concentration, Madame Willow announced that Agnes had passed her the answer along with a message of maternal concern and fond appreciation for all Stella and Isabelle’s tender care over the years.  The directions to the location of the two keys and some documents relating to their ownership of the boxes were given in precise terms.  The wording sounded more like a business letter than a message from the beyond, but instead of the message ending with ‘yours faithfully’ it ended with a declaration of parental love.  The contrast was almost comical, but the relief on the sisters’ faces forestalled any levity.”
An instant later, it quivered at the heart of the innermost ring.
“I love my love and well he knows,
I took a few steps nearer.  “It’s good that you weren’t alone.”
“More?” Mrs Hudson asked, holding the sauce boat aloft.  John nodded and she poured.  “Let me think.”  She put the dish down.  “It was a dreadfully wet winter, Gabriel’s second year at uni, I believe.  Everyone had leaks and damp.  The student in 221C stuck it out until the summer, poor thing, but I haven’t been able to let it since.  The damage was worst on the side wall in your room, but the wallpaper was spoiled all the way around to the hearth.  Mrs Turner had an awful mess, too, but at the back of her building.  The water came down from the roofs, inside the walls.  The gutters just couldn’t drain fast enough.  Cost her a fortune to have her rooms redecorated.  I couldn’t afford it, not after putting the roof to rights.”
I stared over the opposite gunwale, dagger in hand.  Several tentacles groped for purchase above the waterline, but failed to find it.  One by one, they fell back into the water.
A tall woman joined the group.  She undid the knot of cloth at her shoulder and let her garment fall.  She caught the musician on his next circuit, hooking a finger in one of the bands about his arms.  He looked up at her, his hand poised above his tambourine.  She plucked it from his grasp, tossed it onto the cloth at her feet and pulled him round to the far side of the oak.  I could not see them at all, but I heard him jingle.
The king held up a large pearl, shaped like a teardrop.
of the order
From out on the sward, the music of a shepherd’s pipe floated in to us.
“You know, I haven’t.  They hiss?”
“Let’s get rid of the carton and the papers before we have damp growing up the walls like 221C,” I suggested, snapping the bag open on my way back to the desk.
He murmured in agreement close to my ear.
With a creak, the latch yielded.
And Sherlock listened.
John rolled closer to Sherlock and curled an arm about his shoulders.
Somehow my arms were slipping into the sleeves of my dressing gown and Wiggins was arranging it on my shoulders.
I didn’t ask.  I’m not sure I wanted to know whether Wild-Eyed Jim had ever made Sherlock the least bit curious.
Who was his usual fencing partner?  A dim form appeared in my mind’s eye and it displeased me.
(See the end of the chapter for
Culvert turned his eyes on me.  “You have a choice though, Doctor Watson.  You can stay behind and endure your loneliness.  Ponder how you couldn’t do anything for him.  What did you try to do?  Cut it out of him?  Is that why you’re both covered in blood?  Are you even a doctor,
I pressed a bit of cotton wool to the small puncture wound.
Sherlock had balanced the score on the back of the sofa, and had turned away from both Ms Swann and John to play.  There were several pages of it.
The helicopter no longer whirred overhead, but the embankment was still ablaze with unnatural light.
She swallowed and looked back at Sherlock.
“All right,” I said, “so would it have been these locks of hair that Adamantine wanted to get back, assuming he even knew she did this.”
The bell tolled.
“Tall buggers, aren’t they?” John remarked.  The tip of the swan’s beak was higher than the floor of the balcony.
I had checked that night after leaning Murray up against a lamppost because electrifying a fence along a public street was not on and I fully intended to report it, but it had been cold then as well.
I raised my eyebrows.
A window opened.
I edged closer, hairs raising as Sherlock moved so near to an orifice that might just include teeth.
“Yes,” Mycroft replied, rolling the blackened film tight and slipping it into the glass tube.  “Hopefully, he won't realise that."  Mycroft snapped the cap into place and nestled the vial amidst the webbing inside the box.  "I shall have to keep an even closer eye on him than I have been and to inform Mummy that she has nothing to worry about at the moment.”  Mycroft picked up a long, thin implement.
I stepped closer to the window.  The fountain in the courtyard I had visited was not so tall nor did it have statues; it had been a modest feature with a column about my height ringed with carved ivy and a gentle spout burbling at the top.  The distraction of Lestrade’s arrival had followed and although I had now seen from the roof that the Manor’s buildings enclosed several courtyards, I had forgotten to ask which one my room overlooked.  Perhaps the upwards hand-waving while we had been in the courtyard had been a general indication of a room on the upper floors.
One of the two-pence coins was newly minted and the man held it closer to the lamplight.  Apparently satisfied with what he observed, he shouted the name again.  This time a youth appeared behind him, rubbing a hand across his face.  He looked a younger, taller version of the man who had answered the door.  The man grabbed his son's hand and placed the shiny coin in it.  The youth's eyes opened at that.
The two fellows whose mate had climbed the oak, raised their flagons to the heap of ash where the fire had been, then upended them.
“I’m nothing without him Mycroft, that was proved to me years ago how do I just keep going now we could have had a life together we should have been given that chance!”
John looked at him for a moment longer eyes lingering a little on the lower half of Sherlock’s face, because of this Sherlock had half the mind to go check if he had something on this cheek from cleaning up the mess. Instead Sherlock went towards to grab the other bag from John s hands, grazing his skin a small bit in the process and the touch sent jolts through his body head to toe and he hoped to a god he doesn’t believe in that it didn’t show on his face. The level of touching may have increased since John moved back in but that didn’t stop it from being amazing each time it happened. Sherlock realized he was standing a little too close for a little too long to be grabbing a bag of food, snapping back to reality he looked at John quickly before turning away with the food, the redness returning to his cheeks. He couldn’t be certain in his embarrassment but he though John had been looking at his lower face again, he really wanted to see what was on his face so that he didn’t look unkempt for this dinner. But he knew that going to the washroom to check would seem a bit strange so he did nothing, he wouldn’t admit it but he liked the feeling it brought to his stomach and chest when John was staring at him even if it was for a mess on his cheek.
“If you want we can turn on some music and I’ll pour the drinks?” John asked. Having moved into the kitchen as the conversation progressed he was now between the sink and the door.
“We could have retired young and when we did we could have moved up to Sussex bought a cottage like you always wanted. Acres of land no one to bother us, you could have raised bees you'd have looked so cute in a beekeepers suit. We could have had days where we did absolutely nothing, just being in each others company living a life so perfect we’d wonder what god we pleased so much to deserve all of this. Sherlock we could have been so happy together there, together like we were supposed to be from the start. We’d get a dog and them everyday together, always together, because being apart for that long just wasn't an option. You deserve the world and I would have done everything anything to give it to you, I’d give anything to be able to give it to you.”
When his phone rang and John Watson's name lit up the screen he knew something was wrong, worse than wrong, life changing. There was no clear speaker on the other end of the line when he connected the call and no response to his words. Listening to the muffled sounds coming through the receiver he knew what had happened and in less than the time in took to walk the length of the room he had three teams in action. He only hoped they were close enough that his help would make a difference.
When he looks up again bile rises in his throat, tears prick at the back of his eyes, and all the breath in his lungs leaves in a huff similar to if he’d been punched in the diaphragm. Sherlock suit jacket had hidden the blood, had hidden the truth, had hidden the one thing John knew he couldn't handle. Seeping from his chest leaving black red seas of blood across his pure white shirt, Johns follows the flow back to its starting point, two inches down from the xiphoid process a bullet hole much to perfect, so clean in its margins. He looks up at Sherlock and can see it on his face that he understands what that shot means for him. Ripping the jacket from under his leg Johns applies pressure against the center of Sherlock's chest. Alarm bells screaming in his head all his medical training shoving itself to the forefront in an attempt to find a way to save him, but it falls away because there's nothing to do to save him the logical and medical sides of him calmly telling him that but he keeps trying because he can't let Sherlock go without the biggest fight of his life he has to try to save him.
The hour went by as Sherlock had expected, slowly, the case was at a dead stop while test were being run on the composition of the dirt particles found under the victims fingernails and the mulling over he had been doing before John left had led nowhere. He sat in his chair for a good thirty minutes during this time alone thinking about John and what made him happy. He knew that slight domesticity made him smile and that Sherlock making an effort was always nice, so Sherlock decided to set the table for their dinner, of course this would require the cleaning up of his current experiment but it was yielding poor results so he wasn’t too unhappy about trashing it. He made quick work of cleaning the apparatus on the wood table, turning off the Bunsen burner and removing the NaOH from the burette that was set up for the titration he had planned on doing. Putting all of this away and thoroughly cleaning the table and all surrounding surfaces for lingering contaminants Sherlock laid out placemats and cutlery, glass and condiments setting them all in proper format as he had been taught for so long to do when expecting a dinner guest. Stepping back to survey his work Sherlock knew the table was missing something it looked to empty, so he decided upon candles- two equidistant from each other in the relative centre of the table. he was very pleased with himself as he looked at his work and decided to light the candles closer to when John got home so to minimize the possible wax drips that would undoubtedly end up on the table. Sherlock looked down at his wrist to survey the time, 9:02 John was expected home in 15 minutes give or take 3 minutes depending on the size of the purchase form the restaurant he was carrying.
He steadies himself for a moment preparing at least for his immediate future and thinks ‘Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more’.
“uh-uh ya I was just… deep in thought that’s all” John curses himself for the stumble, Sherlock picks up on everything there was little chance he was going to get away with that one.
“John if the universe was at all fair we wouldn't be here right now… DI Greg Lestrade and Dr. Molly Hooper will be here momentarily to take care of the scene. I wouldn't have let anyone else do this job John, ethics be damned.”
When John sees Sherlock crouched down he assumes he’s found some sort of evidence that will help them with the case. He calls out as he approaches “Don’t get mad but he seems to have gotten the drop on me.”
Everything was tightening inside me.  I pressed my lips together, my balls drew up.
To each their own.  Bert seems keen, too.
“Corvus had his housekeeper prepare a room for us this morning.  It seems he planned to keep us with him from the outset.  She was kind enough to explain when she came by on her way to light the fire a half hour ago.  By now, any chill open windows might have left behind should be thoroughly banished.”
A taxi stopped at the kerb while John was pulling his keys out of his pocket.  Mrs Hudson was in the hall when he opened the door.
“Do you know the Corvus family?” I asked.
Library it was then.
And for some reason on that day, Paget’s familiar incarnation of Holmes made me seethe.  I glared at the illustration featured on the second page of my latest story in
His voice was soft and low, like the gentlest of breezes through winter trees.  Over his head, the sky was criss-crossed with falling stars.
John walked towards the windows until the tops of the houseboats moored along the southern edge of the canal came into view.  He cast his eyes along what he could see of the towpath and into the area beneath the trees bordering it.  His mystery man did not appear to be among the people seated on the benches near the path or strolling along it.  He was either long gone or taking care not to be seen or, just some bloke who needed to take the Tube from Baker Street to Westbourne Park at the same time as Ms Swann.  John shook his head.  It hadn’t felt like a coincidence to him.
I laid my hand on his arm.  “Special kit.  I get it.”
I looked up at him.
The night continues on after the dinner they shared.
“I’ll love you forever Sherlock Holmes.”
“I didn’t think it was possible for you to ever clean up from one of your experiments until something became a biohazard, let alone set such a beautiful table!” John exclaimed.
If possible Sherlock’s heart fell further into his stomach which in turn seemed to be dropped from his body and replaced with his heart. Of course John thinks it’s too much that I’m a strange, annoying, clingy sociopath who thinks there is something between us, desperately wants there to be something between us.
Instead he leans against the door frame and watches, knowing that Sherlock is already aware of his presence. After another minute or so Johns leans off the wall and makes his way over to the sink grabbing a dish towel as he does, and come to stand at Sherlock’s side, testing something, Johns leans in a small amount to grab a dish and then moves back to a comfortable and platonic distance to dry it, he not sure he can trust it but he thinks he saw Sherlock leans in as John leaned out, as though wanting to press his side up against John as they do the dishes. This fills John with a strange sense of contentment, the more Sherlock wants to touch him the more he’d be open to the touching right? But what kind of touching sides pressed together at the sink is far from making out with each other. John thinks this over while drying and gets so into his own head that he doesn’t realize that he’s reached into the sick to find another dish and there isn’t one to dry. Sherlock looks at him quizzically “John are you there? You seem far away.”
“John, talk to me more about Baker Street. Tell me about what lives we could have had there.”
John isn't quite sure if his words are making any sense but he feels he must say something so he whispers sweet nothings into Sherlock's face he presses words of love onto his skin hoping they settle into his body marking him with a love he deserved to have felt for years.
“He loved me, he said so and now what am I supposed to do, how am I supposed to keep going after this. It nearly killed me the first time after his fall bu- but this time how do I-”
“John,” Mycroft hates the emotion that is so evident in his voice, the time for emotions is later, maybe never, the Holmes’ have always been quite good at never dealing with their feelings. “John it's time to let go, please let me see my brother.” John stops his stroking of Sherlock's head and moves back as Mycroft kneels down, Sherlock's head so heavy in his open palm he wonders how John was able to keep it still for so long. Together they hold him the man they both loved, two types of love Sherlock never really knew he had.
“Huh?” Sherlock looked up at John from his chair in the living room with confusion on his face. He had been deep in thought over a case they were working on and couldn’t be bothered to stay in tune with the world as it moved on around him.
“Sher-ock,” John says voice cracking “please please stay okay look I'm right here I'm not going anywhere and you aren't going anywhere soon we’ll be back at Baker Street and you'll be playing your violin and this will be nothing more than another scar with one hell of a story okay but you have to stay here with me Sherlock you have to keep breathing.” John knows he’s being irrational knows the sentiment that's leading him down this road.
“I’ll never forgive myself for not allowing you the life you deserved, the life I could have given you.”
Sherlock turned around fully after that, looking at John inquisitively, “is it too much-” he started before John interjected quickly, “no no it’s great, it’s nice we don’t get to use the table very often for what its intended for. This will be a nice little change.”
He decided to let Sherlock pick the film as he had picked dinner and they settled in to watch
His biggest mistake was not checking Sherlock over properly to begin with. Looking up his heart sinks, instead of seeming more alert and less pale Sherlock had sunk further into a stupor- not close enough to unconscious to truly send John into a panic but closer than he wants him to be. His heart begins to pound in his chest cataloging the injuries the field technique of his makeshift tourniquet, and the blood loss since its application.
Sherlock's face tells John all he needs to know, tears form in the corners of Sherlock's eyes and fall in hot tracts down his face, a soft smile plays at his lips one that says ‘thank you for what you are trying to do, thank you for everything’
“John, I-”
“Sherlock what is i-” Johns words die in his throat as peers over Sherlock's body once he reaches him. The fabric of his pant leg is ripped Sherlock’s face greying with shock and fear, blood flowing viciously from a ripped area of flesh far to large to have been caused by anything than a bullet tearing through his leg and a large bullet at that. “Sherlock, hey hey look at me okay this is fixable okay I can fix this enough to get you to a hospital but you need to stay focused okay? Can you do that for me?”
I glanced at the sky; the clouds were drifting off.  I looked back at the water.  It was bright with the moonlight.  No more rain fell.
I slipped the chain of the moon blade over my head and eased my arms back so my elbows rested on the top of the bank.  My muscles appreciated the respite.
Sherlock tapped me on the shoulder.  “Wiggins and Bert are on their way.”
“Please God, let me live,” the man murmured.
He shook his head.  “No one I recognise, but it was carelessness, not maliciousness.  Give me your foot.”
Sherlock nestled the instrument back in its case.  “But lacking the sound of rippling water in the bass clef.  I’d enjoy hearing you play it on the piano.”
Right.
“Sherlock can you let the sack down?” Greg asked.
"It's sinking," he added, angling the spear to keep the great fish hooked.
“My parents ran out of the house.  The driver stumbled out of his car, trying to apologise, but my father had no time for his slurred remorse.  He eased a flattened box under Redbeard and carried him to our car and we drove him to the vet.  I sat in the backseat with Redbeard, stroking his head and telling him again and again it would be all right, but it wasn’t.  The vet said the bones in his leg were shattered and he probably wouldn’t survive an operation to amputate it and considering his age, the kindest thing would be to put him to sleep.
“Apparently.”
“Yes,” Sherlock murmured, freezing a frame of their video showing Ms Swann’s balcony.  “We need to avoid that.”
“The book smells nice,” I murmured, rubbing my nose against his skin.  “Not as nice as you though.”
Sherlock paused by the laboratory door, the curve of his shoulders outlined by the glow of the fire.
My humming was barely more than an articulated sigh.  I touched my forehead to Sherlock’s and watched the molten gold crystallise and divide into two bands.  My palm cooled.  My humming ceased.
“Mid-1930s,” she replied.
“I’m not sure I recognise this one,” Sherlock said, shifting forward on his knees.
Into the dimness, I stepped.
“Pleased though.”
I leaned forwards in my seat.
"So, why are they washing up now?" Lestrade asked.
I drew closer.  Warm air wafted over me, carrying the sound of birdsong and the buzz of insects with it.  Before me stretched the landscape of the stained glass, but for one thing.
“New growth,” Sherlock supplied.  “Summer’s only beginning.”
“Absolutely,” I said and scooped some mashed potatoes onto my fork.  “So what happened in Bath?”
They turned and crunched more slowly back.
He reached over with his other hand and held his forefinger against it.
I hurried to the bed, dropped my towel and dressing gown over its foot, slipped out of my slippers and between the sheets, burrowing under the heavy covers.
Sherlock, knowing he wasn’t going to be able to get out of this without giving an order said that he was fine with whatever as long as it didn’t take long to consume. John left after this brief interaction. Sherlock estimated he’d be gone for the better part or an hour and readied himself for this time without John. Although Sherlock would never admit it out loud he truly despised when John was gone for any length of time, there was this strange gap in him whenever it happened and it was one of the most uncomfortable feelings he had ever experienced. In the past seven years since meeting John, Sherlock had spent over two and a half years without John by his side, factoring in for the time John was out on dates or when he and Sherlock spilt up for a little. Each experience of being parted from John hurt Sherlock in a way he couldn’t really describe. The two years he had been “dead” were absolute torture, each day waking up expecting John to try and force him to eat breakfast or just the image of John making his tea each morning while Sherlock sneakily watched. He couldn’t quite put words to feelings but it resembled adoration he supposed, using his knowledge of human interactions to categorize his emotions was the only way Sherlock was able to figure out his inner monologue of feeling.
John crossed the room to open it.
“Quite right,” Sherlock said and returned his attention to the laptop.
“Do we know whether Roderick agreed to this?”
I awoke refreshed to a room bathed in the pearly light of an overcast day.  I rolled onto my back and stretched; my entire body seemed to feel content with itself.  I glanced at my watch.  The morning was nearly gone, but there had not been much left of the night when I finally went to bed.
It seemed that feeding me had become both a competitive and a spectator sport.  I obliged, two servings worth, while we all shared a pot of coffee.  I decided I was going to need to start running up and down the staircases several times a day, if I wasn’t going to roll out the door at the end of the month.
I considered Sherlock’s set jaw and pressed my lips together, so I didn’t say anything aloud that would give me away, just in case he can’t read my thoughts.  I’ve seen only a fraction of what he can do.  I know that.  Of course, his destruction would have to come from within.  I tightened my fingers between his.
“Well, no, you wouldn’t.  You were unconscious, weren’t you?”  She shook her head.  “Poor Sherlock.  He went off to his island again, for a week or two when he got back.  We could see him if we opened the window, but none of us dared disturb him.  I’d leave food just on the other side, but he hardly touched it.”  She sighed.  “At least it was easier to reach him because of the windows.  We didn’t have those before.  Getting to the Island was quite the journey.”  She sighed again.  “So, we waited and worried and then he came roaring back.  I was in the library when he raced though.  He ransacked the Apothecary and disappeared somewhere else without a word to any of us.”
Lestrade and his men had departed.  Ambulance doors were closing on the portable incubation unit containing the ootheca and its two biohazard-suited attendants as we crossed the street and mounted the steps to the riverside footpath.  Behind us, without flashing lights or sirens, the ambulance quietly pulled away.
Sherlock scowled and shook his head.  “People are giving them dead bodies all the time.  They don’t like it, prefer live ones...who stay alive.”  He smiled a little.  “Ones having sex together, preferably.”
A small bowl of beetroot, a little plate of cheese followed the salmon.  I had been very hungry and did not decline anything I was offered and in this incremental way, I was more than sated.  Between listening to anecdotes of other cases Sherlock had helped Lestrade solve, I sipped the wines slowly, the one from the round, blue bottle and the short amber one having followed the first.  I lost track of the number of dishes I sampled along with the meaning of his words and savoured the timbre of his voice as he spoke.  The combination of flavours had done something marvellous in my mouth and my brain seemed to shut down other avenues of information to accommodate the unusual abundance of gustatory sensation.
“Fine. How’s your opinion of me shaping the images on those cards so that I can see them, too?” I asked, reaching for the sash of his dressing gown.
“I’m guessing you didn’t satisfy her curiosity,” John said.
“Very careless, dropping curses mindlessly.”  He tossed the thorn into the water.
I made it to protect him.
When I had nourished myself to her satisfaction, she insisted I at least see the conservatories that we had not had time for the day before and so we did.
For three long years, the thundering falls at Reichenbach echoed in my dreams.  I did not always remember their details, but their moods coloured my mornings.  Mary had been skilful at dispelling my ghosts, but when she, too, was gone, the sorrow with which I woke would run under the routine of my day until I lay my head again on my pillow and prayed that my slumbers would not return me to those rocky slopes.  I am profoundly grateful that I no longer have need of such prayers and earnestly hope that I may never have need of them again.
“Our journey took us to South Kensington.  We alighted in front of a well-kept stucco and brick townhouse a couple blocks from the new St Mary Abbots.  Waiting at the top of the steps leading to the front door was a well-dressed older couple, whom I guessed to be bereaved parents.”
“Yes.”
I watched him cross the room and shivered.  Carefully, I tugged one side of the curtain over the edge of the other before returning to my warm sofa and half-read manuscript.
Sherlock propelled the boat through the water with an economy of motion that was thrilling to behold.
He hung by a thread in a corner and studied the room.  The blue-green luminescence lighting most of the flat belonged to him, but the bricks above the grate were tinged with Puck’s rosy hue.  Puck had come down from the roof to find his hiding place, not up from the room, and for some reason that conclusion pleased Sherlock.
"Doesn't he have staff to help with that?" I walked back to the table to retrieve my shoes and saw that it was Sherlock's jacket that I had been using as a pillow.
My new state appeared to be fairly permanently at attention.  A quip was forming on my tongue, when I realised what the band was meant to encompass.  My hands dropped.
“All was placid in the Knight household until about six months prior to our gathering when their brother had died shortly after returning from a business trip to Manchester.  The culprit appeared to have been a burst appendix that had not been diagnosed in time.”
I felt cold.  I wiped the sweat from my forehead.  I pulled his bottom leg forward, walked to the far side of the bed and pulled the upper leg back.  My throat felt tight.
Sherlock beat his wings against the glass.  There was space between the frame and the sill, but he couldn’t seem to quiet his wings to walk under it.
“Mrs Hudson’s star pupil,” Bert said and ruffled Kit’s hair.
I smiled at the thought and then realised Sherlock had not let him in.
Wings unfurled, gleaming in the moonlight.  The creature swooped low across the water, up the bank on the other side, and landed under the trees, wings folding against its sides.
There was a chill in the room, the fire had indeed burned low.  As I stooped to poke at the embers, I found myself eye to socket with a human skull.  It rested on the mantelpiece amidst photographs and figurines and a stack of post impaled by the blade of a fine folding knife.  The mirror above it reflected my wide eyes.
“Up.”  Sherlock’s voice echoed off the stone walls.
I laughed.
“You’re growing red,” John whispered.
“Did you ever see the wife?” John asked.
“But you rarely succeed,” Sherlock concluded, setting the book back on the glass coffee table nestled in the angle of a large ell-shaped sofa.
John set the bag of peas on the counter, got out a sauce pan and struck a match to light the hob.
“The sky flashed white.  The breeze had turned to a wind, dispelling much of the fog.  I could see the shore with the trees along it bending down towards the water, but the wind was blowing me away from them.  Then the darkness flowed back and the sky growled.  I turned in the opposite direction, hoping the next bolt would show me a closer bank, but it didn’t.  The flash revealed a silver expanse of rippling water that seemed to have no end.
It is.
“Juliet arrives.”
John had finished his tea and was ready to abandon his vigil at the window when he saw a woman - tall, dressed completely in black, mask to match.  She crossed the road diagonally, against the light, pausing in the middle for a motorcycle to roar past.  The motor and foot traffic were greater than they had been for months, yet nowhere near what they usually were on Baker Street.  John thought the woman might live in the neighbourhood, crossing like that.  He made a small wager with himself that she was headed for 221b rather than one of the outdoor tables at Speedy’s.
“Hmm.”
I pressed hard against my coat and the silver case in my pocket dug into my flesh.  There had been times when I’d taken it out and held it, still warm from where I carried it, but I wouldn’t open it because I couldn’t bear to see how beautiful he had been in those photographs, looking this way and that, assuming poses to keep the photographer distracted while he was being interrogated, all unaware.  All that beauty, of body and mind, all gone.
