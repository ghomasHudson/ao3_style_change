“Hey, Cas,” Dean greeted him softly, “Why didn’t you wake me?”
things that had happened during their hunts. Dean was laughing so hard he snorted beer up his nose, tears of joy welling in his eyes. He was clutching his chest from laughing too hard when Cas told him how a woman had tried flirting with him by complimenting his trenchcoat.
“Did you just call me here to emasculate me in front of my fiancé?” Castiel was feeling uneasy now that Dean had left. It was like Dean had been a security blanket.
tired, both physically and just of the situation in general. It wasn’t the first time they had kept him awake with their loud bedroom activities, Dean was so loud. Sam couldn’t live like this anymore.
“Can we hang out next week on Friday?” Dean asked as he looked up from his laptop.
“However, I will only let you go on one condition,” Dick added, leaning back in his seat.
“Yeah,” Dean answered in a clipped voice. It was clear that he did not want Castiel around.
He was gone by the end of the week.
“I can feel the walls closing in on me, I gasp for air but I choke. I am trapped. I try to run, but the claws drag me back in. I cry out, but there’s no one there to save me…my heart leaps in fear. My knees buckle and I fall. I can hear hounds growling behind me. I try crawling to the door but the door seems to be stretching further and further away from my reach with every move I make,” Dean trembled as he recalled, his eyes were red-rimmed.
“Okay. Say hello to the handsome angel for me,” Rowena said softly.
“How did I even get here? Why can’t I remember anything from when I ordered drinks at the bar?”
“Okay, but do you know how to work it?” Dean asked. He wasn’t sure about this plan.
“I want to keep him all to myself Pamela because I know some people are just waiting to pounce on him,” Castiel laughed.
"I'm sorry Dean, it's just that you are so beautiful like this," Cas said, still watching Dean's hole as it fluttered a bit. It was a bit red, so was his ass cheeks and his back thighs from all the pounding.
“First of all, you did not murder Lee, it was an accident. Secondly, you did not turn me into anything, I did all that of my own volition. And lastly, your father made you believe that you needed to be without fault in order to be loved, but he was wrong. You are wrong about this too. Dean, you did not kill him. His alcoholism killed him,” Castiel kissed Dean’s cheek.“You don’t have to carry that with you.”
Castiel walked with Dean on the property in silence until they found themselves on the beach. They both removed their shoes, let their feet sink into the sand, and watched the waves swoosh and crush on the beach and back again.
“Look, I will come to you if I have to. I know. I know, your dad and Lee’ blah blah…But, I’ll find a way to make it work. Even if I have to get a small apartment out of town just so I could see you,” Castiel soothed.
“Hey babe,” he said as he leaned into the touch but something was different, the hands running up and down his torso were bigger and rougher than Castiel’s and Gordon would never cross that line so who was…
“Dean, I know things are changing and life is not a constant or a bubble. But all these changes are good. You have a good man who loves you so much. You have everything that we never had growing up, you are happy and healthy. These are good things, so don’t try and ruin it,” Sam advised.
With that, the line went dead and Dean realized that he was sad. To be honest, the fact that Castiel had casually said that he had a boyfriend or whatever, Mick, made him jealous. He knew he shouldn’t be, but he was. Also, why did that name sound familiar? He needed to do his own digging on Castiel’s new boyfriend just to feed his curiosity, not because he wanted to see who had taken his place in Castiel’s life, he tried to convince himself.
They busied themselves with putting the leftovers and alcohol away. Cas told Dean to go get comfortable in bed and he would join him after cleaning up the kitchen but Dean refused and helped him clean up. When they were done, they walked hand in hand to Dean’s bedroom. When they reached the door, Cas gave Dean the biggest bear hug Dean has ever received.
“Congrats man, I’m glad things worked out,” Dean smiled at him.
“You want to know what my favorite part of you is?” Castiel asked as he kissed around Dean’s neck, lightly biting every so often.
“Just open the fucking door, Winchester,” Dean growled to himself, reaching out and turning to the knob.
_____
“I love you,” Dean whispered before leaning in and softly pressing his lips to Castiel’s.
“YOU CAN BE ANYBODY!” Castiel finally yells at the top of his lungs.
“Hey,” Castiel greeted him back but he couldn’t seem to form a smile to match.
“Don’t you dare apologize, Dean Winchester,” Castiel cut him off. “You know he got what he had coming to him. I am completely on your side. You did nothing wrong.”
Cas lifted Dean a little higher and pressed himself against Dean. Dean was about to stop him, tell him that he needed lube and that Cas needed to work him open but before he could say anything, Cas was already inside of him.
“When do you come into this story?” Dean asks, glaring at Castiel.
“I would imagine so.” He gripped Dean’s hand tighter. “How about I make us some hot tea and then we can call it a night? Then tomorrow, we will get started on finding the answers that you need.”
That was Dean’s guide. He stroked at Castiel’s penis the same way that he would stroke at his own. He slowly moved his hands all the way down the shaft and then back up, bringing his hand over the tip and lightly twisting around it, gathering up all the precum that was beginning to leak out. Castiel would moan lightly with every movement, his hips jerking when Dean would rub over the tip, almost as if it were too much for him to handle.
[greeneyedhunter] What book number are you on?
“I don’t know really,” Castiel shrugged. “It’s really complicated right now.”
Dean took a few deep breaths before rolling over, a slight moan escaping from him when his cock rubbed up against the sheets and pressed into the bed.
[greeneyedhunter] I apologize as well.
Dean walked over to where Cas and his friends were waiting for him to arrive.
“It’s corn oil,” Benny, the Chef on their crew chimes in. “Maybe her neighbor was gonna make cupcakes.”
Dean took the gift from Castiel and once again quickly unwrapped it.
The question threw Dean. He didn’t get to decide how Castiel felt but he was certain that Castiel had no idea what it was that he was admitting. Sure, Castiel may love Dean. He may care about him deeply. Hell, the angel had risked his life many times in order to protect or defend Sam and himself. But that was not the kind of love that Dean was going for.
A trip to the store, a twelve-pack purchased and now here he was, standing on Cas’ front porch. For most his life, he had just walked in. They considered their homes open to each other. Dean could not even remember the last time either of them had knocked. Sure, this had led to some embarrassing situations, but it had never forced them to switch to knocking. Why start now?
_ _ _ _ _ _
"You're awake." Cas said softly, looking down at his own hands instead of looking directly at Dean. "They told me I needed to prepare for you never to wake up. I knew they were wrong but it became harder and harder to deny it over time."
They made their way around the back of the house and luckily for them, the door was unlocked. When you are a vampire who can kill most things that would break into your house, security was not a top priority. Dean was thankful for their trust in their own abilities. Made it easier to get in without a sound. Unfortunately, they were waiting for them. They somehow knew that hunters were in town looking for them. What they did not expect was Dean to come with his own personal angel.
“Yes, I am worth it,” Dean answered.
“It was no problem, Dean,” Cas said with a smile of his own. “It is never an inconvenience to help you or Sam. But I do have to be going.”
“Hey,” Ben looked up from his phone for a brief second to look at Castiel and then he was back to not fully paying attention. Dean would be sure to take the game away come dinner time. Ben did not get to hide behind video games this evening. If Dean was going to work on being social, Ben was going to join in with him.
[greeneyedhunter] Oh.
I can’t believe we live in the same state.
Dean had to find out more. He needed to know what happened to his brother and to himself. There had to be clues or answers out there for that night. No one told him anything beyond what he already knew, but there had to be more. How did he do it? No one had told him how his brother had died. And what happened to the hole in the ground?
“Sure,” Castiel shoved his hands into his pockets and followed Dean. “I am not very good. I think I have played all of two times, maybe three.”
“Oh,” Cas’ face feel. Dean did not mean it in a bad way but it kind of hurt that Cas felt he might. Did Cas feel like Dean was going to give himself to Cas and then just walk away from him? Okay, sure, Dean did not have the best track record with relationships, but this was Cas and Cas should know that.
How is that even possible?
Dean looked across the diner at the man standing by the front entrance. He looked completely out of place in the diner. He was wearing a suit, though it was majorly covered by the shadiest looking trench coat Dean had ever seen. His shoes were shiny enough to catch Dean’s eye from across the room and he was almost certain that the watch around his wrist cost more than Dean could even imagine making in a month. The only thing out of place about this man was his hair. It looked like he had been running his hands through it all day.
“How can I help you?” Dean asked as he stepped in front of the man. “Dean Winchester. Mechanic.”
[angelofthursday] Work?
[greeneyedhunter] Are you kidding? I loved the series. Books and Movies.
“Cas,” Dean whispered once silence had taken over the room.
“Castiel huh?” Ellen had to think over the name a bit but she didn’t say anything. Dean could tell by the look on her face that she found the name to be odd. Hopefully the man was not as odd as the name but Dean was going to find out soon enough.
“No.” Dean wasn’t that bad. “I am in a bad mood because I was basically told by multiple men and women last night that I am old and out of shape and not worth going home with. Then I spent hours in front of my mirror today and realized that they were right. It was kind of a large pill to swallow, you know?”
“Please Cas,” Dean tried to buck his hips again but Cas was just strong enough to keep him from the action. “Please. I need you.”
“Well, I better get back inside,” Ruby pushed her way passed Dean and Castiel, obviously angry that things did not go her way. Dean felt bad about brushing her off but he really wanted to go home, much more than he wanted to hook up with some hot college chick.
Dean reached out and took a hold of Castiel’s hand, leading him in the direction of his bedroom. This time it was Dean who got Castiel a towel and a dry change of clothes. This time it was Dean who waited for Castiel to get settled before wrapping his arms around him and pulling him close.
“Listen.” Dean reaches over and places his hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Let’s just act like what we just did is something … you know what? We - this is - we proved our manhood. We were boys.”
ATTEMPT NUMBER ONE
“Doing what?”
When you guys were seven, Cas was living with that horrible lady who did not believe in holidays. You had mom return all your presents so you could buy Cas that leather journal and pen.
"That's right baby." Dean smiled into Cas' mouth.
“Dean,” Castiel reached out and grabbed the sides of Dean’s arms to steady him. Dean struggled to fight him for a moment but then gave up. “You need to calm down.”
-----
Dean worked his way out of the room and then had to work himself through the crowds of people. People were everywhere. There were people dancing, some in groups, some with another person and some just by themselves, their drunken state swaying back and forth to the music. Then you had a litter of people here and there that were making out. Dean almost envied them. It had been a very long time since he had kissed someone.
Fine. Don’t tell me. I got to go.
"You used to stand so close to me." Dean continued on. "Personal space was never a characteristic you had. Now, you barely get within ten feet of me unless you absolutely have to. What gives man?"
[angelofthursday] Let me guess. I am hot but not your type and you are no longer interested.
“I think maybe I'm just not over Lisa,” Dean tried to convince himself once again that, that was the answer. How long could he really go on blaming his dead wife for things?
“Uhhh.” Dean sighed out at his words. If anyone could get him to cum from sound alone, it would be his husband. He’d always joked with him when they first got together that he had the perfect voice to be a phone sex operator. Dean was glad he wasn’t though. That voice belonged to him and him alone. “Please baby.”
“Yes you are,” Castiel agreed.
“Dean,” Cas called across the school parking lot.
Then it went blank. He was not sure how long he had been lying there and if he did not feel so alert, he would have thought maybe he had fallen asleep. He tried to think of anything at all but his mind was black. There was nothing. It was quiet. It was dark. It was amazing.
“Yeah, I know,” Castiel confirmed. “But there were things I wanted to tell you, needed to tell you, that I couldn’t say to your face.”
“Uh,” Dean started but then stopped himself. “Not tonight ladies. Just trying to enjoy some guy time tonight.”
“I’m sorry, Papa.” Claire frowned and leaned her head down, looking anywhere but at her dads.
“I am not happy,” Castiel confirms how not good it is. “Not one bit.”
Hello, Dean.
“Yep,” Dean agrees.
“Do you have any way to track down my soul mate?”
[angelofthursday] How would I be talking to you if I was in prison?
[greeneyedhunter] You spend a lot of time in chatrooms?
“That’s nice,” Ellen threw a dish towel over her shoulder and poured Dean a beer. “Do I know this friend?”
“There is nothing obsolete about you, Dean.”
Was it okay?
“Well,” Dean interrupted, not ready to agree that this was the tragedy they were making it sound like it was. “What exactly did she do?”
“Yeah?” Cas swallowed hard, his hand twitching around Dean’s.
I’m not?
“And we are off,” Castiel winks to the camera.
Dean tried to look at the bright side. If Castiel was going to be there, he was sure that fun could be had, or at least he would have someone to talk to through all the lame party stuff. Plus, there was sure to be more alcohol there than there was here.
Well, let me know.
Dean sat up completely in his bed, sweat rolling off his forehead. That was the fifth time this month that he had, had this dream. It was always the same dream too. Nothing ever changed, from the way things looked to the way that it tasted and smelled. Yet every time it felt unfamiliar, as if it were all completely new to him.
“An old man who weighs too much and really needs to hit the gym,” Dean answered, slightly joking.
[angelofthursday] I am also quite close with my manager.
“Please be careful,” Anna called after him as he climbed out of his window.
Trinity Falls was a small town. How they had two law firms was beyond Dean’s comprehension. Sam said that just because the offices were located here didn’t mean that their clientele was limited to the town alone. Being located an hour outside of a major city meant that there were always people looking for lawyers. Something about a small-town lawyer comforted people. Maybe they felt like they were not going to be ripped off by someone who was just trying to make a buck. Sam was better than that, but he had to admit, the money his brother was making blew his mind sometimes.
Dean finally got out of his car, which he had been sitting in for the past hour, talking to his brother. He was not sure how to make this work. Cas had lied to him for an entire year. You couldn’t just forgive something like that. Dean couldn’t just be okay with what happened. It wasn’t going to be all rainbows and puppies. It was going to be hard work to get back to where they were and even harder for them to move onto something bigger. But they could do it … right?
Well … do you love him?
[greeneyedhunter] I have nothing but time Cas.
They kissed slowly again. He was not sure how long it lasted, but he never wanted it to end. He never wanted any of this to end. But all good things come to an end and soon, Dean was pulling away. He wanted to reach out, hold him against his body and never let him go but he remained still.
[angelofthursday] What is the craziest thing to ever happen to you?
“Take the rest of your clothes off,” Castiel instructed.
"It isn't real." Cas tried to pull away but Dean wouldn't let him. "You don't want me Dean. Dream you wants me. I can't, I just."
[greeneyedhunter] Same here. Couldn’t get you out of my head.
Castiel? What kind of name was Castiel? Dean could tell already that he was not going to like this kid. His name sounded like something one got for one of a few reasons. Either he came from money, hippies or religious freaks. Hopefully, it was the religious freaks. The hippy kids always wanted to talk to him and the rich ones always complained about how horrible their mothers and fathers were for making them come to this shit hole. The religious ones tended to fear him in a way. That meant they didn't talk to him.
“Well thank you for the ride,” Castiel reached for the doorknob and pushed the door open. Dean was not ready for him to get out but was not sure how to drag the conversation on any longer. “Saved my legs.”
“My fraternity is having a party this evening,” Sam boasted, always so proud of himself for being a college boy. “And I would really like it if you came.”
Ben sat back away from Dean, a horrified look on his face. Dean tried to reach out to Ben but he was up on his feet and racing toward his room. Dean pulled himself up off the ground, using all of his energy and tried to run after him but was quickly hit with another wave of memories.
“Excuse me?” Dean lightly punched Cas on the arm.
[greeneyedhunter] How else do people get to know each other?
“I’m not crazy,” Dean finally spoke. It made him jump. Dean had not spoken in years, not loud enough for another person to hear. He was surprised he even remembered how. He didn’t sound like himself anymore, and there was a rasp that he was sure came from the fact that his vocal cords never got the chance to work.
Another burst of laughter erupts from the crew behind the camera.
“Two beers?”
“Yeah,” Castiel yells in return, trying to see if it helps, but it doesn’t.
“Dean,” Castiel whimpered. “I’m not going to last.”
“What we are planning to do,” Castiel informs everyone, “which I am seriously questioning is, put this in our mouths, bite it at the stem, chew, chew, chew, swallow, swallow, swallow completely. When it goes into the mouth, the ten-minute timer will start and we are not going to … first of all, drinking water makes it worse, so that ain’t gonna help.”
Heading toward the shower, Dean pulled out his phone again and brought up Sam’s number.
“I was not hitting on Cassie,” Balthazar lied.
“Yes, Dean,” Castiel cried out, his orgasm hitting him so hard that his breath caught in his chest and for a moment he couldn’t breathe.
Dean smiled at Castiel. He could tell that Castiel found what he had said funny by the look in his eyes. Dean did not see the humor in Castiel’s words but he appreciated that the teacher had some sort of sense of humor, even if it was a dry and hard to understand one.
“I hate the world,” Dean says as he gets up from his chair and begins to pace the room.
“I will cover for you the best that I can,” Anna forced a smile.
Dean and Castiel check their gloves and pull the two peppers, that have been laid onto a napkin, between them. Neither man looks ready to eat the deadly looking ball of fire before them, but they know that if they don’t do it now, they are going to have to re-shoot this episode later. They already agreed to it in a stupid meeting months ago.
[angelofthursday] But doesn’t it bother you how far away we live?
Dean?
“That would be nice,” Castiel reached into his back pocket and pulled out his wallet as he made his way over to Dean’s window. He then pulled out a white card and handed it over. “Here is my card, the number on the back is my cell.”
You think we could make it work?
“You can travel,” Castiel answers, holding his arms out to the side like a bird or a plane. “You can fly.”
[greeneyedhunter] Good.
“Cas.” Dean finally broke the silence between them. “I’m …”
“I’m so,” Dean gives his own commentary as he picks up and examines his pepper. “I hate everything right now. I hate everything that can be hated.”
“What do you see?” Castiel asked, stepping behind Dean.
“Yeah man,” Sam slurred into his ear. “She is smoking hot, super smart and Jess says she is into you.”
“Just a little gesture of I love you,” Dean admitted. “I feel like I haven’t done that as much as I should lately.”
No. But maybe someday.
“Oh man,” Cas tried to compose himself. “We need to go camping again.”
“We are not having sex.”
As the last word left Castiel’s mouth, Dean held a box in front of Castiel’s face, a ring right in the center.
"Very well," he finally spoke.
“Cas, please,” Dean said as he opened the door. “I don’t think I can do this right now.”
[Dean] The one that hurts them less?
“Violence can sometimes be the answer.”
“Press charges?” Dean questioned, suddenly even more nervous than before.
“Okay,” Castiel breathed against Dean.
[angelofthursday] Maybe on the coastline. I don’t really get to the beach much.
“You get used to it,” Castiel forced a smile and Dean could tell that he did not agree with his own words. It was just what he told himself to help him work through it.
“Like,” Dean starts to speak but then takes a deep breath before continuing. “I feel like I am going to vomit now, and I haven’t even put it in my mouth yet. This looks like the heart of Satan himself.”
“Suit yourself,” she said, her voice no longer sweet.
“So,” Meg turned away from Balthazar to address the rest of the group. “We all good? Everyone staying?”
“You are going to have to give me a few minutes,” Dean could barely lift his head away from the wall. “Then I will take care of you baby.”
He didn’t know what to do and he couldn’t turn to the one person he would normally turn to during his time of need. Or maybe he could. Reaching for his phone, Castiel made one of the stupidest decisions he’d ever made. He texted Dean.
“Probably would have led to more trouble,” Castiel laughed again, only this time it was out of amusement. “Drinking with a bunch of high school students is probably not in a teacher’s best interest.”
[angelofthursday] Did she win?
“I am not going to make it,” Dean cried out.
“Seriously?” Dean was sure there was a look of shock on his face just for the simple fact that the man smiled.
“Hey Sammy,” Dean smiled into his phone. “You up for getting a drink with your big brother?”
Dean texted Castiel before plugging his phone in and turning out the light. His phone buzzed shortly after but he did not check it. He would check it in the morning.
Dean could not seem to find his words, so he nodded. He was not going to stop Cas from touching his cock. His cock twitched so badly it hurt, he was that excited for Cas to touch his cock. And then fuck … Cas was pulling his pants and boxers down around his ankles and slowly running his smooth hands up Dean’s legs. They were not rough like Dean’s and that just excited him more.
If Cas was going to fuck anyone tonight, Dean wished it was him. Dean could picture himself gripping tightly onto the horrible green comforter of the bed in his motel room. Cas would be on top of him, thrusting into him with all he had. Would Cas destroy him if he used all of his might to fuck Dean into the mattress? Would he have to hold himself back to not hurt Dean? Would Dean even want him to hold back?
I know. I’ve eaten it.
“Of course I came,” Castiel shook his head and repositioned himself in his chair. “I told you on the phone that I would.”
Dean parked a few blocks away from his brother’s fraternity. Not because he did not want to be seen but because you never knew what a bunch of drunk frat guys were going to do to a vehicle sitting in front of their house. He would rather leave with his truck in the same condition in which he had arrived with it in.
[angelofthursday] You have appeared to be the exception to the rule.
I am going to ask you for something crazy and I need you to not laugh at me or anything like that.
“I do not mean to,” Castiel apologized. “But you keep calling me.”
That is as far as Dean gets before his alarm wakes him up. Every time, like clockwork, his alarm wakes him up from the exact same place in his dream. Every time he questions why this is but soon he brushes it off and rolls out of bed. Today is no different from those other days.
“Damn,” Dean sighed. “What is going on in the world?”
Okay.
“You are so beautiful,” Castiel praised him.
"What?" Dean looked between the both of them. The woman looked familiar but he was sure he had never seen her before in his life. Though she could have been one of the nurses around when Lisa had gotten sick. "Who is taking care of Ben? My garage?"
“Not going to tell me then?” Anna pulled Castiel from his thoughts, now standing only a few feet in front of him.
I’ll leave it in the living room. You can come get it.
“Here you go,” Castiel handed Dean a glass of water and sat down on the chair to the right of the couch. Dean looked Castiel over as he sat. He was in his pajamas, his hair in a mess and his face beginning to need a shave. He looked the most normal Dean had ever seen him and he liked seeing him that way.
“Yeah, Dean?”
“I,” Dean began to answer her but she cut him off, pressing her pink satin lips against his. Instead of fighting it, which was his first instinct, he allowed himself to relax into her kiss. He let her continue to kiss him and hoped that he was doing well at the kissing her back. His mind was racing with so many thoughts, he was not sure that he was really putting any effort into kissing her back. She seemed to not mind as she crawled onto his lap, pinning him down against his seat.
“Why are you doing this?” Dean questioned.
Before Dean could figure out how he was going to do this, Cas reached out and grabbed Dean’s hip, pulling him forward and taking the tip of Dean’s cock into his mouth. Once there, he stopped, holding Dean in his mouth. It took Dean a moment but he soon realized that he was supposed to do the same.
“I know sweetie,” Castiel’s voice dropped to a hushed tone. “There are a lot of people who think that two men should not be together in this world and they use things like God to make them right. But it isn’t right and we know better, don’t we?”
Once he got home, Dean quickly showered, microwaved himself some crap tv dinner, grabbed a beer and settled in at his computer desk. He took a few deep breaths, working through the nerves of these newly discovered feelings and then signed in.
“Oh God,” Dean cried out, cumming all over Castiel’s hand and thigh.
"Dean," Cas leaned toward Dean and spoke.
“I’m such a good … “ Dean’s words were cut off by his husband pushing his cock into him.
[angelofthursday] Pretend.
“Yes,” Cas nodded. “I suppose I should.”
“Dean,” Castiel fought back tears and for a moment, Dean felt he had messed up. This was too much for Cas. He should have just gotten over himself. Why was he so stu … “I have loved you since the day you came up to me and said, ‘I’m Winchester, as in Dean.”
I know.
“I thought I was supposed to make you scream my name?” Dean questioned, even as he lifted Cas off of him so that he could undress.
“You can be anybody,” Castiel mumbles, his head leaning against the desk.
Dean took a deep breath and sat down on the sofa, he balled one of his fists and placed it into his hand. He needed to not be there. He needed to leave but Castiel would not let him leave. This was a horrible mistake. He needed to leave. Why couldn’t he leave?
Dean turned on the water to let it warm up and then made his way over to the sink to shave. He’d gotten pretty gross on their last hunt and it had been a difficult one, so he hadn’t groomed himself the way he’d normally do it. But they were finally home and he was going to live in the shower until he was cleaner than he’d ever been. That could be a while, considering the showers in the bunker never seemed to run out of hot water. Two hours was Dean’s longest and he was hoping to break that record today. But shaving in the shower was never easy, so he had to get that out of the way before he stepped in.
“I would be more than happy to go to the market for you,” Anna interjected. “Save you the trouble. That would allow for you…”
“Yes, Dean.” Castiel nodded. “Angels.”
"It's because of what I said at the hospital, isn't it?" Dean asked.
More time passed and all that could be heard through the room was the swishing noise that could be heard from the recorder. Dr. Mills didn't want to give up, she would never give up. But today was not the day. They would get there. They had to get there.
A moan loudly escaped Dean’s mouth as Castiel pulled his boxers down, not all the way to his ankles but just enough to set him free. He used his hand at first, following the lead of what Dean had done and that was more than Dean could ask for. He bucked his hips against Castiel’s hand, wanting him to stroke faster.
“What?”
Castiel was not going to say it but he was enjoying this way too much. His name had yet to come up and all the glory was going to Dean. What more was there to enjoy in life if not watching your best friend squirm every now and again?
Why would you lose me by meeting me?
[Dean] What do you have to decide?
Dean needed a win. Benny had been right the last two times and it was not looking good for him.
“But why for so long?” Dean felt the tears working to force themselves free from his eyes and he did not have the strength to hold them back anymore. “You could have stopped long ago. You didn’t have to make me …”
“So what brought you here?” Dean asked trying to carry on the conversation. “I mean, if you were a lifer, I feel like I would have seen you around before the other night.”
I do have a question though.
“I was only informing them of what it was I saw out in the woods,” Balthazar stood his ground, clearly not worried about Dean. This only made Dean want to hit him more. “Is that not what you were doing?”
[greeneyedhunter] Really, really.
“Four hundred?” Dean asked with large eyes.
Um … Yeah. I can get some stuff together.
Names Dean, what is yours?
Moments later, Dean is hiccupping right alongside Castiel.
"My son," Dean almost yelled but learned that he was physically incapable of the task at this time. "Where is my son?"
“I made out with Bela,” Dean changed the subject back to him. He was not sure why he did it, there was no purpose in bringing it up now and he really did not want to talk about what had happened.
"You have to remember Cas," Dean pleaded as he dropped to his knees. "Please remember."
“How do you like your steak?” Dean asked casually, opening the lid to the grill.
“Dean I don’t understand,” Castiel shook Dean’s hand hard, pulling his attention back to him. “What are you talking about?”
[angelofthursday] I am not a really big risk taker. Outside of writing.
Dean gave Sam a false promise. Dean had no intentions at all of going to this party.
[angelofthursday] I swear. One day. I will tell you.
“I did not cheat on you,” Castiel promised. “This is not what you think if you will just let me explain.”
Dean did not get a text back right away, which he hated but he was not going to complain about it. He was busy at work and needed to get things finished so that he was not stuck here late. Not like he really had anything to do this evening. Ben was spending the weekend at a friends and he had one beer sitting at home in the fridge, it was going to be so exciting when he got home.
Thinking of Cas rubbing his ass quickly turned into Cas licking him open and then fucking him against the shower wall.
Dean could feel the headache he had been carrying around for the last month fade away. His shoulders relaxed into the bed and he felt weightless. All the tension was melting into the sheets beneath him. He felt like he was engulfed in the silk. There was no pain, no stress, no noise. It was quiet.
“Hey you,” Ruby came over to where Dean had found a bench out back and sat down next to him. He smiled up at her but was not sure how he felt about being joined. Hopefully she was a cool as she seemed. “Not enjoying the party?”
“Uh, yeah.” Dean answered.
“What do you think?” Dean asks. “Wanna try something new this year?”
"I just passed out," Dean struggled to speak. His voice was raspy and dry. It felt like he hadn't spoken out loud in a very long time. Maybe it was due to him being sick.
“It will be done in a few minutes,” Cas informed him, pulling two large bowls from the cupboard.
“Now, whoever loses,” Dean takes over. “And this is pretty serious, because, whoever loses has to enthusiastically tweet out a piece of fanfiction hand-picked by an Angelical crew member, from their own personal Twitter account.”
Lisa had continued High School and went on to get a college degree in education, which she only got to use for a few years as a first grade teacher. Dean got his G.E.D. and started working at a local mechanic shop. When the man retired, he offered to sell it to Dean cheap. He had been his own boss ever since. Dean went on to talk about Ben and how proud he was of his son, even though he hadn’t done so well in school these last few years. Though he had three years to work through losing his mom, the older he got, the harder it seemed to get in some ways for him.
The interior was clad in pristine white, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows ensured that the line between the indoors and the charming landscape outside wasn’t blurred away. They had a captivating infinity pool that overlooked the lake and a sunken outdoor lounge. Castiel had allocated himself a small patch of land next to the kitchen for a flower and herb garden.
“I know you haven’t known me for long, but trust me, I never do anything I don’t want to, Dean. Would you just relax and let me help you?” Castiel responded, straightening the white sheet on Dean’s bed.
“We started calling him that when we were kids and it just stuck,” Mick explained.
“I’m glad I somehow contributed to your healing.”
beauty shine,” Max smiled and winked at Dean. Dean blushed as Max ran his hand along Dean’s arm all the way down to his hand. They didn’t hold hands but their fingers brushed and Castiel wanted to scream. Something inside him was pushing him to stand between them but he remained rooted to the ground.
Castiel then moved to his neck because he remembered from a decade ago how Dean liked it. He also remembered to kiss behind Dean’s ear, he knew that was his weak spot. Within a few minutes, Dean was a panting mess. He had started unbuttoning Castiel’s shirt with shaking fingers. Once Castiel’s shirt was off, he drank him in. His broad chest, his skin tone was the color of gold, how he managed to get his skin like that Dean could not fathom. Then there it was, that tiny bit of black ink that had always peeked out of Castiel’s t-shirt.
“That would be bad for both of us. I would have to go to the bank in the morning and sign some forms to verify the transaction. Cas has to approve the transaction as well. They put such precautionary measures to prevent extortion. Are you willing to wait till tomorrow? Besides, they will be suspicious that I withdrew such a large amount at night. The trail would lead them right to you” Dean tried one last time. Lee was smart but Dean needed to convince him. He didn’t know if any of the things he was saying were true but he had watched way too many movies and had picked up a few things.
“Let’s get to the point. Castiel, I think the reason your mother called you here is that she blames
“Oh my God! You’re getting married!” Charlie shrieked and all Dean could do was nod his head and wipe the tears streaming down his face, then showed off his ring around the room. Castiel was doing the same.
Castiel smiled at him, and that’s how Dean found himself in a culinary class with Castiel on their second date.
[greeneyedhunter] Some chick completely tore apart the inside of her car so she had a reason to bring it in.
Castiel.
Castiel changed his clothes several times before landing on his usual attire. It was stupid to care about what he looked like. Dean had seen him a million times over. What he wore was not going to change the outcome of the situation.
"We can have it Cas," Dean finally spoke, fighting through his fears. "When I get out of here, we can have a normal life."
[greeneyedhunter] *Winking Face*
“Hey,” Dean greeted him with a smile as he approached the table.
“We understand,” Castiel finally spoke.
“Where?” Dean keeps questioning him.
“Please what, Angel?” Dean asks, his voice deep and gravelly.
“I almost didn’t,” Castiel admitted.
Dean didn't even turn the engine off before running up the walkway to Castiel's front door. He was going to get to the bottom of this, even if he was in fact crazy.
“I am gonna read this card just fine,” Dean sits up straight and holds the card up in his hand. “I got this.”
[greeneyedhunter] My longest, most meaningful relationship, just happened to be with a man.
“Hey,” Meg greeted them as they sat down in their chairs around the fire. “Where did y'all run off to?”
“Okay,” Dean heard Cas’ response but he did not stick around long enough to endure any further questioning. He had a problem in his pants and he needed to take care of it.
What is your name?
I should have told you, I know. But … I was scared.
[greeneyedhunter] When she found this out, she sued me for ruining her car.
“Yeah, I’ll be there.”
You gonna cook?
Image Received.
“I can’t be what?” Castiel asked.
“Have you known that it was me?” Castiel filled in the blanks.
“It’s okay,” Cas pulled himself to Dean’s side and sat next to him.
“Dean,” Castiel finally spoke, bringing Dean’s breathing back to a more manageable level. “Maybe we should take a step back from this.”
You want my honest opinion?
Without thinking too much into it, Dean removed his shirt. He didn’t take his eyes off of the mirror, afraid of what would happen if he did.
Rubbing his cock through his boxers, Dean moaned right along with Castiel. He was aching to press his body once more against the now almost naked teacher. Learning seemed to be a little more appealing to Dean in the moment and it almost amplified the feelings he was having. Who didn't want to mess around with the hot teacher from time to time?
Before he could contemplate whether or not to go inside, Dean was waving him in. Shit. Maybe he didn’t have to tell him. He could go in and Dean could confide in him about being stood up by Jimmy. He could comfort Dean and then he could wait the rest of his life to die and go to hell, where he obviously belongs.
, 2006
“Why?” Dean asks.
[angelofthursday] Yes, Dean. I like you.
“By sleeping with my damn soul mate?” Dean felt like hitting something. He was going to hit something.
The fairy shrugged at Castiel's thoughts. This was even worse than he imagined.
“I am going to take a shower before we get started,” Dean says as he lifts up his arm and smells himself. “I am ripe.”
But it was more than just forgiveness at this point. Cas had been his best friend since forever and now their relationship was changing. Could Dean be gay and they can try and make this work? What if Dean decides that he can’t be gay? Would they be able to go back to being the friends they once were? Right now, talking online, it was safe. Dean needed safe. But he knew this bubble was soon going to pop.
“For you,” Castiel answered, holding his breath for the blowout that was about to follow.
“Cow tipping,” Dean says, reading where the wheel has landed.
“I’ll believe that when you get back and there is confirmed proof from everyone else that you did not get scared.” Dean added in.
“Allow for me to what?” Castiel interrupted her again. “Allow for me to focus on my studies? Twirl my sword with Raphael? Be trapped within these walls for good?”
“See you in twenty?” Dean asks.
“I am not angry with you,” Dean answered. “I am just trying to summon my soul…”
Castiel began to move his finger once Dean settled down and stopped moving against him. One finger working its way in and out of him. He was ready for a second one but Dean knew better than to ask. Castiel would give it to him when he was ready. Slowly but surely, one finger became two and two became three, until Castiel had four fingers inside of him, pushing and pulling and turning. Dean was ready. He was so very ready.
I have faith.
“I am incapable of getting drunk,” Cas informed him. “Well, unless I drink a whole liquor store, but I don’t think that would be in anyone’s interest. But, if you would like to start with a drink, I would be happy to join you.”
As Dean was sinking into the couch, his cell phone began to ring across the room. He grumbled to himself about how fantastic that was, as it forced him to get back up so that he could retrieve it. Once he had it in his hand, he smiled. It was Castiel.
They talked freely after that, laughing and going over all the times they had gone camping together. Dean was hoping that Cas would change his mind. Not because he did not want Cas to go camping but because he did not want Cas to get scared and have a bunch of stupid college kids laugh at him.
[greeneyedhunter] Possibly.
“No,” Dean answered, leaning forward and softly pressing his lips to Castiel’s in a short but sweet kiss. “It’s not.”
“Would you like to get a beer sometime?” Dean asked, thinking it might be nice to make a friend, or at least attempt to. He did not have many left.
“Cas?” Meg turned toward them. “Dean?”
Dean laid in bed for a while after his alarm went off. He kept trying to figure out what it all meant but he continued to come up empty handed. And no matter how badly the dream made him feel or how confused he was, he still had to get up and live his life. So, he crawled his way out of bed and headed for the bathroom to get ready for the day. He did not really have the time to take off and work through whatever it was that his dream was trying to tell him or he would crawl right back into bed.
[angelofthursday] How could you even know that.
“I think it sounds wonderful,” Cas agrees. “Can I sleep now?”
“What?” Dean pulled himself out of his thoughts and reached his head around further until he could see Benny. Benny was the one that ran the kitchen in the diner. Thank God too. If it was not for Benny’s cooking skills, the diner would have never made it. People even come from out of town just to eat Benny’s food. He could probably go anywhere in the world and open his own place, but he said he liked it here. The quiet life was the only life in Benny’s mind.
“Yeah,” Dean answered. “I just need to lie down for a bit. Think I drank too much. I’ll uh, see you in a bit. Let me know if you find anything.”
“Dean,” Castiel put up his hand to stop him. “You are welcome here anytime you like.”
[angelofthursday] My books get read, yes. But I am no J.K. Rowling.
“I’ll be there,” Castiel confirms.
As Jimmy, he told Dean everything. He told him about being gay and how hard his home life was. Dean knew about Castiel’s home life to the degree that Castiel had shared it with him but he never wanted to burden Dean with all of it. Things were not easy in Dean’s life either and he never wanted to be another obstacle or source of stress for him. But as Jimmy, they shared in their pains together. It was there that he learned that Dean was bisexual, how he didn’t care about anything except making sure his brother succeeded in life and his best friend. Castiel wanted to tell him the truth, tell him that it was his best friend that he had been talking to for the past year, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He was in love with Dean and Dean had told him that he loved him back. Dean loved Jimmy and, as wrong as it was, Castiel was not ready to lose that love. He needed that love.
“That is serious,” Castiel laughs.
“Hey Cas?’ Dean’s voice dropped down lower and more serious.
I didn’t.
] What?
When Dean’s front door opened, he nearly jumped out of his skin. His heart was racing. He knew what he was getting himself into but did he really know? He had never been with another man. He didn’t know how all of this worked. Would they even get to the sex part tonight? They didn’t have to have sex, that was not a requirement. Cas would not think differently of him if he didn’t want to have sex with him, would he? Of course not, this was Cas.
I like blue.
[greeneyedhunter] Secondly, that is the perfect person to tell all your secrets to.
“I …” Cas started but stopped, setting down his beer and slumping against his seat. “I don’t know how to explain it.”
The house was dark but Castiel’s car was out front, so he had to be here, right?
[greeneyedhunter] I am not angry. A little disappointed but not angry.
Then Castiel stood back up, placed his hand on Dean’s chest and pushed. He didn’t push hard but Dean understood what he wanted. So, Dean allowed himself to fall back against the bed, completely naked and hard as fuck, in front of his fully clothed best friend.
Dean had many more questions, which was probably why he followed Castiel without a fight. Normally, he would act bratty when Castiel was telling him what to do but something told him now wasn’t the time. He wasn’t sure why, but he was excited.
“Mmhmm,” Dean agrees again. “If you normally watch this show with your parents or even your kids, you may want to rethink that today because, well, this episode is about to get all kinds of awkward.”
“I don’t know what is inside of these things,” Castiel says as he picks up his pepper and looks it over with definite fear in his eyes, “besides a torture chamber. Oh gosh. I’m always shaking,” Castiel says, lifting his hand to show how badly he is shaking now. “I am always a little wired, but today, I am just - this could be it.”
“Oh,” Castiel nods his head in agreement. “Okay, I like that.”
So, you think I am straight?
[angelofthursday] Not even a little bit.
“And we’re rolling,” Charlie says from her place behind the monitor on the other side of the room.
“Look at me,” Castiel demanded but his voice was not as forceful as it had been before, but more ragged. “Please.”
“Shit,” Castiel grumbled to himself, looking down at his phone.
[greeneyedhunter] Her picture is also hanging in shops all over the state warning other mechanics about her.
“Dean,” Cas cried out. “How did you find these?”
[greeneyedhunter] *he says while he looks up murder mystery series books with three currently published*
Talking to some girl online is not really considered a date.
[555-0920 | Castiel] Dean?
When Castiel pulled open the door, his heart broke. He should be used to the sight and feelings that came along with seeing his best friend’s tear-streaked face, but it never became easier. It was never going to get easier.
“Good.”
“Oh, god,” Dean called out, his thrusts becoming slightly more erratic. “I am not going to last much longer.”
“I only meant to save you some trouble.” Anna hung her head with her reply.
(See the end of the chapter for
I guess you have your answer then.
“Okay,” Castiel agrees. “I’m getting up and dressed right now.”
Lay it on me.
“Twelve?” She turned back to look at him again. Maybe she wasn't blind? He was certain she was. “These things are mean, tricky creatures.”
“Fuck!” Dean ran his hand down his face as he logged out of his account. This was getting out of control and he was taking it all out on Cas. Sure, Cas deserved it, but if he kept this up, he could end up pushing Cas away for good. That was the last thing he wanted. He just didn’t know how to go about this any other way.
[greeneyedhunter] She messed a lot up and I couldn’t fix it, not without replacing the engine.
They lean back for a moment and take a deep breath. This is the part of the episode where everyone would be seeing their intro before it comes back to them.
Castiel laid against Dean’s bed, looking up at the ceiling while Dean disappeared into the bathroom and came back with a wet cloth to clean them both up with. Once they were clean, Dean tossed the cloth to the basket in the corner and crawled back in bed behind Castiel, but he did not wrap his arms around Castiel the way he had expected to.
“Dude,” Dean begs, “don’t even - don’t.”
“Thanks,” Dean responded, a look of confusion on his face but no one pushed the subject any further.
“So, why didn’t you tell me before it got that far?”
“I can fix anything,” Dean assured him. “Lead the way.”
[angelofthursday] If I didn’t like you. Do you think we would still be talking?
You don’t have to come get it.
Want to meet at the roadhouse for a drink?
Cas slowly fucked himself into Dean, holding onto him so tightly that Dean was certain he was going to have bruises on his body when he woke up in the morning, but he didn’t care. He wanted Cas to destroy him. And that is what Cas did, slowly at first but gradually picking up speed and the forcefulness with which he drove himself into Dean.
Dean would make that happen. And now, he had bigger goals in mind. He was going to make sure everyone knew just how vocal Cas could be. Cas might even be shocked.
“So, because I teach other religions, my family does not really agree with my life.” He frowned into his beer. “I still go home occasionally to visit and my parents call every now and again but we are not nearly as close as we used to be.”
That was not the answer that Dean had expected. He always had to sit outside of the office until his parents came to pick him up.
“I am demanding every day,” he laughed in her direction.
“Dean,” Bella moved into the middle of the seat and up against Dean. They had been talking for about a half hour in his truck, this time more about Dean, except he left out the kid part. They were not serious enough for that conversation yet. So, mostly they talked about him being a mechanic and owning his own shop. She seemed to love that he was just a normal guy and not some stuck up college frat kid. “Do you want to kiss me?”
“Fat chance,” Cas admitted. “You are the best foot heater around.”
“My throat hurts.”
“If I hadn’t been drinking,” Dean says, but doesn’t say anything more.
“How long what?” Dean questioned back.
[Cas] But that is okay too.
“Dean,” Castiel appeared at Dean's side. He reached out and rubbed his hand along the length of Dean's right arm. “He isn't worth all this.”
“English,” Ruby offered up her major which just sounded like a class one would take. Dean knew better than that though, his grandparents being a teacher and a librarian but still, English sounded like a class, not a job.
“Thank you.”
“And when you get all freaked out,” Dean laughed, remembering that one time Cas thought a bear was raiding their camp and he went pale as a ghost. Dean thought he was going to cry but he was too scared to do even that. Dean had to sleep in Cas’ tent that night. “Who is going to stop you from passing out.”
Congrats.
“I was just wondering,” Dean knew he should have gone home, he knew it. “I was wondering if you wanted to go grab that beer.”
“I’ll take,” Dean turns to face Jess, who is off to the side of the camera with their relief provisions. “I prefer yellow. I mean, the white.”
Dean looked up at Cas who was looking at Dean with an expression he couldn’t make out. Had he said something out loud? Had he been talking to Dean? Dean had stopped noticing the world around him as soon as Cas touched his side.
[555-0920 | Castiel] Thank you.
“Just open us some beers,” Castiel instructed, turning back to the stove. “Want some macaroni?”
I have a feeling I am going to regret this, but yeah.
Every year, for the past four years, they have done their own special Christmas Eve. Christmas day was reserved for going to their families' houses and doing family things. So, they promised each other the night before to do their own private gift exchange. Castiel says they started it just to have sex under the Christmas tree, but they do that anyway. Even so, Castiel is now curious as to the change that Dean would like to make.
[greeneyedhunter] *waits impatiently patiently*
Castiel groaned at the sound of his phone going off near his head. It didn’t feel like morning and he was fairly certain that wasn’t his alarm clock tone. After a few moments of struggling to force his eyes open, he is reaching across the bed and swiping his finger across the screen. He really should have looked at whatever name was on his caller ID but that would have taken more time than he had if he was going to actually answer the phone, which he stupidly did.
I’ve been thinking a lot today.
“As long as you use that money to keep me drinking,” Castiel nodded, accepting that he was going to lose money, though Dean would never really play him for money. Hustling was for the losers who thought they could beat him. Everyone thought they could beat him. No one ever did, outside of Ellen, that is.
Thursday.
[greeneyedhunter] Then telling me your age should not be a problem.
Castiel plugged in his phone and set it on his nightstand. He hadn’t got the answer that he’d wanted, but he got the one he needed. Tomorrow, he was going to show up at the coffee shop. He was going to tell Dean that truth. Dean deserved the truth.
[greeneyedhunter] I have no intention of doing either of those thing, Cas.
But all of that was coming to an end.
[greeneyedhunter] Afraid I am going to stalk you?
It was, but I’ll get it figured out.
As Dean washed over his body, he continued to think about his evening. He thought about Ben not being home and how he was glad that his son was moving on in life, like he should be doing. He thought more about Bela and how he wished that he could apologize to her but he really didn't know how to go about it. And then he thought about Castiel, whose house he never should have shown up at.
Not wanting to be rude though, Dean let her continue talking and listened as intently as he could, at least until Castiel appeared in the doorway. He was a good ten feet away from them and his sights were focused on some college kids that were having a fight in the pool. Dean turned his attention to the fight for a moment but soon his eyes were fixed back on Castiel. Dean was not sure what it was, but there was something about Castiel that intrigued him.
“I am okay with it if you are okay with it,” Cas told Dean. “But, if you aren’t okay with it, I am also okay with us leaving.”
[angelofthursday] Not really.
Dean waited a few more moments for whatever else was going to happen. Suddenly, something was being slipped over his ears. He couldn’t help but bring up his hands and feel. They were headphones. He tried to listen for more but everything around him was suddenly silent. He was about to make a comment but before he could talk he was being dragged across the room and Castiel was helping him lay down on the bed. Silk? Was he really laying on silk sheets?
I think I need to go.
“Very well.” She held out her hand. “But the cage stays. Unless you have more gold to offer.”
Camping is great. I am glad that you are going.
Yeah, vaguely.
[greeneyedhunter] How am I humoring you?
[Dean] Who are you worried about.
“Those are random,” Cas says aloud, making more of a statement and not really expecting an explanation behind them.
“Cas,” Dean moaned out.
They laid in silence after that, listening to each other breathe over the phone. Castiel felt like he should panic. He’d just gotten off on the phone with his best friend. This could ruin everything they had built over the last twenty years, but deep down, he knew the truth. He knew that neither of them could hold down a relationship. He knew that they spent too many hours together instead of with other people. They knew that this was right and they had been hiding and fighting the truth in their relationship all these years. There was no panic, just complete calm, and completeness.
"On the floor in the kitchen," the voice answered. "Should I call an ambulance?"
[greeneyedhunter] Thank you.
“Tell me to my face now.” Dean insisted.
Reaching into his back pocket, Dean pulled out his wallet. He fished through the dozen cards that he had in it until he found the one he was looking for. He figured this would be a long shot but it was still worth a shot. Teachers drank during the middle of the week right?
“I do not have anger management issues,” Dean lied.
“That is not saying that I just want a fling or some short ‘maybe I am gay, let’s see’ romance.” Dean made sure to use Cas’ famous air quotes while talking. “It just means that I am willing to try but I can’t promise that it will be happily ever after for us.”
“It isn’t wrong either,” Castiel defended. He didn’t believe that anything he was doing with Dean was wrong.
What do you mean it was Cas?
Dean let go of Castiel’s still half hard cock and pulled him as close to him as he could. They kissed, their sweaty bodies pressed together. Dean was afraid to let him go, afraid that it would be over after this and he never wanted to leave this moment, he just wanted to be here, in Castiel’s arms.
But that means the other person is going to be given the chance to steal that point and potentially the rest of the points in that round.”
[angelofthursday] You can’t make a promise like that.
Okay. Thanks.
“I think you should leave now,” Castiel sighed.
"Dad," a voice spoke, startling Dean and causing him to stumble forward into a counter.
“Did you take the female me home?” Castiel asked, a lump in his throat making the words come out rougher than he would have liked.
You are such a bitch. You know that?
“Why?” It was almost more of a begging statement than a question. “Is this not what you want?”
[angelofthursday] Let me guess. I am too old to talk to?
“One of these is bigger than the other,” Castiel notes. “And one of us is bigger than the other.”
A part of Dean appreciated that his son wanted to see him happy and do things. Another part of Dean was sad. He was sad that his son even noticed these things. Ben should not be seeing that Dean has no life. Ben should not be worried that Dean needs to get out of the house more. These were not things that your twelve-year-old kid needed to notice.
“Yes,” Castiel confirmed. “Can you fix it?”
You gonna put in on my porch or do I get to see you?
Metallicar used to be a thriving, beautiful place. Located in the upper west corner of the Land of Lazarus, it was blessed to be rich in resources. That is where their Kingdom played a part in the world. If there was something that you needed, from the freshest fish to the sturdiest trees, Metallicar is where you would travel to find it. They were the head of the trade.
Dean had been stressing out like crazy lately. He had recently bought out his Uncle Bobby and was the official owner of Singer Salvage and Winchester Auto. He had been running the place for years, ever since Bobby retired, but this was the first time he was doing it all on his own. If things were to go south from this point forward, it would be all on him and no one else would be held responsible. That was a lot of pressure but also what he had been working toward for years. He was equally terrified and proud as hell of himself for his accomplishments. On the downside, he had been spending less time at home and when he was home, he was stressing out about work. This was starting to put a strain on his relationship with his husband. Castiel had never flat out said anything but he didn’t need to. Dean knew that he was being neglectful all on his own.
Cas turned and made his way toward the bed, taking his time to crawl onto it. He moved toward the middle and then turned around, lying himself onto his back. Dean looked his body over. He was pale, but muscular, almost like a statue. An angel statue, laying in the middle of his bed, waiting for Dean to act. Right, Dean was supposed to do something now besides stare.
Another pause. Dean was about to log out, when finally, a response came.
Castiel slammed the top of his laptop down and tossed it to the end of his bed. Everything he had been fighting to hold on to had come to an end. He was going to lose Dean. Well, Jimmy was going to lose Dean but it was a part of Dean that Castiel needed. He needed to be able to tell Dean that he loves him. He needed to be able to hear about the parts of his day that Dean kept locked up inside and didn’t share with him. Sure, Dean told him enough but he never opened up to Castiel the way that he did with Jimmy and he was losing that. Either way, he was losing a big part of Dean.
______________________________________
“LOOK AT THESE HATS,” Castiel screams back.
[greeneyedhunter] It is a very big question.
[greeneyedhunter] You wouldn’t dare.
[greeneyedhunter] Hey. Hope you don’t mind that I messaged you privately. The chatroom had so much going on, it was hard to keep up with our conversation.
“Cas,” Dean cried out as Castiel’s fingers stroked over his prostate, causing Dean’s arms to give out and his head to land against the pillow.
“No,” Dean shook his head. “I want to do this. I am not sure what this is at the moment, but I want to do it.”
Dean complained a lot, but he was generally happy with his life. He was in the process of buying Singer Auto from his Uncle who wanted nothing more than to retire. He lived in the apartment above the shop, so he didn’t have to pay rent. His brother had recently graduated from Law School and had finally moved home. Sam had even gotten a job at one of the better law firms in town, not that there were many. Two, there were two.
: Long but money is money. How was your day?
“With words,” Dean answered quickly.
“What exactly are we doing?” Dean asked nervously.
“Dean,” Cas stepped closer to Dean and reached out, taking his hand. “We don’t have to do anything you are not ready to do. Hell, if all you can do is let me blow you again, sign me up.”
“I wish I could Dean,” Sam began to turn Dean down, which actually bummed Dean out slightly. “I have this paper to write and I really need to get it finished.”
The fairy shook his head no but then patted the bed beside him. He then moved himself to lie down and closed his eyes, mimicking being asleep.
“That while you enjoyed this,” Castiel started but had to stop, he knew he was going to cry again, he needed to not cry. “That we are best friends and you don’t want this to ruin our friendship.”
“It’s all that I have wanted since she handed me the divorce papers,” Castiel admitted and Dean’s heart sunk. “But now, I am not so sure.”
“Mercedes?” Dean asked quietly, leaning into Benny. They always took bets on what kinds of cars people drove.
Yeah, yeah.
“Claire,” Castiel turned to their daughter, his dad tone in place. Dean’s heart sunk. He was going to do this over ice cream?
[greeneyedhunter] Close, huh?
“Close your eyes,” Castiel instructed.
“Okay, Internet,” Castiel tries to focus on the camera in front of him.
“Okay,” Dean let out the breath he had been holding. It was now or never.
“I am serious,” Dean says, hoping to get his boyfriend's attention.
“Oh,” Dean bends forward, grabbing his stomach, “stomach pain.”
“You talk to me every day.” Dean frowned at this.
You have 20 years of proof.
Dean waited a few moments, wondering if Cas was actually going to let himself in or if he was going to have to take it upon himself to enter. Luckily for him, Cas opened the door. He was halfway out of his clothes and looking more confused than normal.
Excuse me?
“WE ARE MEN!” Dean yells.
Small indeed.
“No,” Dean yells.
“So, same as usual then?”
"I have to get out of here." Dean pushed her and made his way into the living room. He grabbed the keys to baby, hoping she was able to drive and fled for the garage. By the time his parents caught up with him, he was halfway down the street. He hadn't even put on clothes.
“I might be bad at this,” Dean informed Cas as he made his way to sit on the edge of the bed.
Wiping the stray tears from his eyes, Dean brought his truck to a complete stop and killed the engine. He looked up at Castiel’s house, not quite sure how this is where he ended up, but knew it was where he needed to be.
“What?”
“Who is that?” Dean humored his little brother. Dean had almost believed that last time he had sent Ruby after him but Ruby was not even close to Dean’s type and Dean hoped that Sam knew at least that much about his brother. Dean liked them tall, dark, brunette and with a serious head on their shoulder, but still able to let go. Ruby did not fit into the description at all.
That was a slight lie. Dean had no intentions of attending this party. Not after the last one.
[angelofthursday] I have angered you.
Okay.
“Fine.”
“So,” Castiel sat down on the couch next to Dean, after getting the fire started. “Are we done with the notebook?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean finally gains some semblance of control over himself and grabs the Dean and Castiel hats that are sitting on a shelf off to the side. He places the one that says Dean on his head and the Castiel one on Castiel’s head.
“I see how hard you are now,” Cas growled in Dean’s ear. Before Dean could say anything, Cas had reached around and replaced Dean’s hand with his own, slowly stroking at his throbbing hard cock. Dean wanted to fight against it. Well, that was a lie. He knew he needed to stop this but he didn’t want it to stop. Cas was touching him and all Dean could do was let him and internally beg for more.
Cas looked from Dean to the book in his hand. It was a cookbook with recipes for four hundred different kinds of pies.
“Cas?” Dean asked, spinning around so quick he could feel the room begin to spin but it quickly straightened itself out. “Why is Cas going to be here?”
[angelofthursday] Don’t need to tell my life story to some guy I might not ever talk to again,
“Shit, Cas,” Dean moaned again, his hand speeding up around his cock.
“I am sorry I did not show up Dean. Meg came by and I texted you.” Castiel explained himself and Dean suddenly felt worse. He had not gotten a text but that did not mean that Castiel did not text him. His phone had died earlier in the night, since he did not have a chance to charge it when he got home. “Who is her? What are you talking about?”
“Yeah,” Dean smiled, turning so that he could look at Cas. He wasn’t going to lay down though, not until he could wash his hands. “We will get there.”
“And second,” Dean continued on. “It was not the shitty blow job I was giving my boyfriend that angered you. It was the fact that It wasn't your mouth that was wrapped around his cock. You don't think I didn't notice you hitting on him from the moment we got here?”
The kiss was soft at first, lips lightly brushing against each other. Then Cas was reaching up and grabbing the back of Dean’s neck, pulling him down into him. It picked up from there. Light brushes turned into searing hot kisses. Dean moved to set himself between Cas’ legs, pinning him to the bed. Once again, their erections were pushed up against one another.
“It's Castiel,” Dean corrected him. “And you have been all over him. Everyone could see it.”
“No,” Dean leaned in a little closer. He could feel Castiel’s hot breath hit against his lips. He knew that he should pull away but he couldn’t do it. He wanted this, at least he felt like this is what he wanted. “But don’t let me be the one to stop you.”
[Dean] Slightly. What’s up?
“I know of the rules Anna.” Castiel offered her a smile but the worry did not diminish from her face. “I will not be gone long. There are things I need from the market and once I have procured them, I shall return.”
“Doesn’t mean I am going to heaven,” Dean stared off at the wall on the other side of the room. “I don’t really deserve heaven. I’ve done more bad things that I would like to think about. Those things don’t get people into heaven.”
“Right,” Dean laughs.
“You smell like grease and you are tense,” Castiel answered. “Go get in the shower while I get these flowers into a vase. Okay?”
“Nice to meet you all,” Dean said to all of them, yet his eyes took a while to move off of Castiel. Maybe it was because he looked closer to Dean’s age. It could also be that he looked like he did not belong at this party and that is exactly how Dean felt about himself. “So are y’all Law students?”
Dean closed his eyes to get a better picture but quickly opened them again when he was being pushed face first into the wall. It was not hard enough to hurt him but that did not stop him from becoming incredibly alert. How had someone gotten into the bunker? Who was behind him? What was happening.
Dean wanted to fight against it but Castiel was so strong and honestly, he didn’t want it to stop. He had dreamed about this moment. Touching Castiel was something that always hung in his mind and now he was doing it.
[angelofthursday] Because, this always goes one of two ways, and I am not ready for either of them.
Dean ran down the hall, heart pounding in his chest. He knew that his actions would have consequences. Whether they were good or bad was still to be determined. But you went after what you wanted in life, didn't know. So, here he was, pounding on Cas' door.
Castiel crawled out of bed and made his way across his room, quickly pulling the window open so Dean could crawl in. He then made his way over to his dresser and grabbed the towel and change of clothes that he had prepared. Dean took them from him and silently stripped off his clothes, dried off the best he could and changed. Once Dean was situated, the made their way over to Castiel’s bed and climbed in, not a single word exchanged between the two of them.
“What are you talking about?” Dean whimpered out. He wanted to be scared but Cas was pushed up against him and he still had his cock in his hand.
“Yeah,” Castiel shook his head. “You know you can’t lie to me. So, you may as well tell me what is bothering you.”
Dean felt bad when he finally made it into the back yard. He did not want to be a downer but he was not enjoying himself with Sam’s friends. They did not seem like bad people but all they did was talk about school and their classes. Parties were supposed to be where you got away from your life, not where you got drunk and talked about them in a louder tone. Dean had nothing to add in at any time so he figured he would not be missed.
“Cause you are asking all of a sudden?”
Dean waited for a while but that was all that Sam texted back. Dean felt bad but not too bad. His brother would understand one way or another. He knew that Sam was just trying to get him out of the house on a Friday night. In fact, it was probably more their mother’s idea than it was Sam’s. Sam would never admit to something like that, but Dean was fairly certain it was the truth.
“Yeah?” She answered, oblivious to what was about to happen. She was much more interested in her ice cream.
Blue is good. I prefer green though.
“Whatever,” She crawled out his truck and brushed past him quickly. “Tell your brother he can stop trying to hook me up with you. You aren’t worth my time.”
“Like this?” Castiel asked as he slipped the first finger in, slowly letting his entire finger disappear inside of Dean.
“We have been talking about it,” Castiel shrugged his shoulders. He seemed like he was not even sure it was something that he wanted. “We haven’t really settled on an answer.”
“I am not deaf,” Dean shook his head. He stood up from where he was and turned to face Castiel who was standing directly behind him. “I just thought I was crazy.”
“That’s not gonna happen,” Dean says with a shake of his head.
“Upstairs,” Castiel demanded instantly, bringing himself to his feet.
“I hate you,” Dean mumbled from under the hood of the car.
“Yours,” Dean confirms with a deep moan that confirms to Castiel that he is coming as well. “All yours, Angel.”
“No,” Castiel was stern and sat up straight in his chair. “You are not dying. But if you were, you would not be going to hell. You deserve so much more than hell.”
Dean didn't speak though. Had Cas just introduced him as his best friend? Not, ‘they this is my boyfriend,’ but his best friend. Maybe this trip wasn't such a good idea after all.
“Right,” Dean jumps in as the prompter throws up his name. “Each round, Cas and I will be given a stack of cards. Each card will have a portion of the actual fanfic that was written. We are going to go back and forth reading lines from each story. Each story we successfully read will earn us one point. If at any point we can’t keep a straight face, we laugh or we otherwise freak out, we will lose a point.”
[greeneyedhunter] Hey, Cas?
“They deserve it,” Castiel says.
When he was young, Castiel's mother, used to tell him stories about the fairies. They helped with the prosperity of the land. Honestly, Castiel never really believed they were real. But here he was, trying to figure out how to keep one hidden in the palace from his uncle.
Dean worked to convince himself as he leaned forward. The tip of Cas’ cock touched his lips and Dean sighed with relief when his first thought wasn’t to abort. In fact, as he wrapped his mouth around the tip of Cas’ cock, it felt right. This was Cas. He was pleasuring Cas. There was nothing he wanted more than to make Cas happy. And from the moan he received in this moment, he knew that he was doing that.
“Give it a shot,” Sam lightly punched his brother in the shoulder. “Plus, I already told her you were kind of interested.”
“It is what I want. God, it is completely what I want.” Castiel let go of Dean and stepped a few feet away from him. Dean was not really worried before but he was worried now. “But I don’t want this if you don’t want it too. And right now, you look pretty damn terrified.”
Don’t hold him off for too long. Okay?
“I'm gonna go for a walk,” Dean stood up from his chair and headed toward his tent to grab a flashlight.
Well that was helpful.
“Now,” he says to the camera, “I am wearing a glove when I handle this thing, because I’m going to inevitably wipe…
“I don’t know if I …” Castiel could feel his heart begin to race.
Dean took a deep breath and then turned his attention to Cas’ cock. It was slightly longer than Dean’s but Dean was thicker. He was sure he wasn’t going to be able to do what Cas had done earlier at the Roadhouse, but that was not going to stop him from trying.
He stopped off at the store down the street and picked up some flowers for his husband. It would not fix all of the problems they were going through but it was a gesture. Maybe it would show Castiel that he did care and he knew what he was doing and things wouldn’t be as stressed between them but that was wishful thinking on his part, he knew that.
He texted Sam, tossing his phone onto his bed through the bathroom door.
“What’s his name?” Ellen continued on with the questioning. One would think that she was grilling him for information if they didn’t know her, but that was just the way Ellen was. She liked to know the people that were in the lives of those she cared about. When it came to family protectors, she was right up on top.
“But we did,” Dean continues what he wass going to say but is once again interrupted by Castiel.
“Always my good boy.”
Castiel continued up, stopping at his thighs and quickly moving up to Dean’s stomach. This left Dean feeling both insanely turned on but also completely frustrated. His cock was harder than it had ever been and it was the only part of Dean’s body that was not getting any attention. It was on the verge of pain at this point but Dean was not going to force anything on Castiel.
“Because I,” Castiel started to answer but he stopped. Why had he lied to his best friend for the last year?
Dean reached out and grabbed a hold of him, pulling him in until Castiel’s head was laid against his shoulder.
[greeneyedhunter] I am a mechanic.
And then Cas was cumming, Dean’s name being gasped from his lips.
“It’s not.” Dean shook his head. It was still kind of crazy, but until he got to the bottom of it all, he was willing to host all possible ideas. “But Angels and Demons? That does sound crazy.”
Small world.
Dean tried to cover himself, but Cas had already seen him. Shit, not long ago, Cas had Dean’s dick in his mouth. This was nothing new for Cas. Suddenly, Dean became incredibly nervous. Shit.
“I have learned my lesson,” Cas crossed his arms over his chest and Dean felt his heart speed up. “I won’t get scared this time.”
[angelofthursday] What is it that you do exactly?
They hadn’t seen Cas in nearly two months. And while that sucked, Dean was grateful for it. The last time he’d seen Cas, he ended up getting turned on and had to excuse himself from the room. That, followed by the jerking off session he’d had in his room where he all but screamed out Cas’ name as he came all over his hand, was enough to make him need a break. He couldn’t seem to keep his mind or his dick under control when Cas was around. It was better that he kept his distance, at least until Dean could figure out how to hide his attraction for the man better. No, he was fine. They were not calling Cas.
Cas lifted his eyes from the floor to meet with Dean's. For a moment, Dean was so lost in them that he forgot that he was angry. But that only lasted a moment.
“Dean,” Cas reached forward for Dean.
“Of course,” Castiel looked down at his phone and shock overtook his face. Obviously, he had not noticed how long they had been sitting in the car talking with one another. “I am so sorry for keeping you out this late.”
“I am now,” He turned his answer into more of a flirt. He didn’t want to complain to her. If he ended up hooking up with Bella it would be far from the end of the world. She was for the most part, his type and she was wearing a short jean skirt and a plaid button up. Dean had to admit, it was kind of hot.
Dean liked Nurse Moseley. She was older and set in her ways. But at the same time, she cared a great deal. Even though he had never spoken to her, she seemed to know what he needed, when he needed it. Of all the nurses that were here throughout the course of the week, she was by far his favorite.
“Aren’t you going to join me?”
[greeneyedhunter] It means, I am going to take this risk.
[angelofthursday] I have lots of good time. Alone. With myself.
But there was no response. His bed was empty. Dean was gone.
Cas was not like Dean. Cas was able to take it in his mouth. All of it. Just like before. And it was the hottest thing in the world.
“Okay,” Dean agreed.
Dean felt bad as soon as he asked the question. Cas did not really many friends outside of Dean and their small circle. Normally, during his breaks, he would stop in at the shop and keep them company and during the weekend, they would watch movies or go out to the club. Without Dean being physically available at this time, Cas probably did not have anything to occupy him for the next two weeks.
Okay.
Dean began to look to Cas, see how he was doing, when Cas moved forward and took Dean’s cock back into his mouth. He was not slow about. He did not take his time, waiting for Dean to mimic his action. He sucked Dean’s cock like his life depended on it, pushing Dean immediately over the edge.
Dean was not surviving. He got up every day, went to work and then came home. He had stopped living the minute the machines flat-lined and he was left all alone, even though he was not alone. He had Ben and he was trying to do his best by his son, spending as much time as he could with him. Ben was now his excuse. Ben was the reason Dean stayed home or couldn’t go out over the weekend. Lisa would have been doing better. It should have been him.
“Dammit Sammy,” Dean hissed at his brother. He hated that Sam felt the need to take Dean’s life into his hands. It was not his place and Dean did not appreciate it. This party stuff and now trying to set him up with people; that was not what Dean wanted. Though honestly, Dean had no idea what he wanted.
“Well,” Dean set his empty glass down on the coffee table and stood up. “It is getting late. I should probably be getting home.”
“Not sure,” she shrugged. “Your problem now.”
[555-0920 | Castiel] Would you go camping with me this weekend?
“Don’t leave me alone in this, man,” Castiel begs.
Dean finally made his way over to the man who looked to be growing more impatient by the minute. Dean hated to keep him waiting but at the same time, the way he shuffled back and forth on his feet and continued to scan the diner was kind of … cute. It didn’t help that the man had the bluest freaking eyes Dean had ever seen in his entire life. Watching them grow darker with frustration sent a thrill down his spine and he didn’t want that feeling to go away any time soon.
Dean was the big brother. He was supposed to protect Sam from the evils in this world. He was supposed to be the savior, not the … not the killer.
“That makes sense,” Dean nodded at Castiel. Dean was not really a religious person, in fact, beyond things he had seen in movies, he didn’t really know much about the subject at all.
“No,” Castiel shook his head as he answered. “I never loved her. She was just a place holder.”
“I would not be putting myself out at all,” Dean smiled, pulling his keys from his pocket. “Just let me say goodbye to my brother.”
“Me first,” Dean says excitedly.
“I think she just needed to be able to be completely free,” Castiel choked down the last bit of beer that was in his glass. “No strings at all.”
“And,” Dean jumps back in, trying to give Castiel time to get himself under control, even though Castiel can tell that Dean is just as unhappy as he is. “I wasn’t planning on doing this. Let me tell you, many of you told us,” Dean lifts his hand up to his mouth in order to mimic people telling them what to do. “Hey guys, that Ghost pepper is not the hottest pepper in the world, the Carolina Reaper is.” Dean lowers his hand and then glares at the camera before continuing. “Well, we were ignoring you, okay? We didn’t want to eat this pepper. But then Chuck Shurley …”
"Your fall?" Dean asked. Then it hit him. All of it came flooding back. It was a mix of memories but the ones where he was Ben's father, they were not real. It had been a coma dream. All of it a lie. Then he remembered. "Sam?"
And what happens if I can’t show up?
[angelofthursday] The lives we lead seem thrilling.
Shit. This was not what Cas wanted. Dean was moving too fast. Sure, Dean had not really said what his intentions were but he was sure Cas knew. Dean was, after all, still Dean. And Dean wanted nothing more right now that to … fuck? Was Cas a top or a bottom? Was Dean a top or a bottom? How do you learn this about yourself? Shit. Did Dean really want this? Could Dean do this?
“You made me fall in love with you.”
Dean felt marginally uncomfortable sitting on Castiel’s couch. He was still not sure why he was here in the first place. He knew that he could get up at any point and leave. Castiel was not in the room to stop him. He could go home, sober up and think of some lame excuse to fix all of this in the morning. Yet he remained seated.
“Gentleman standing over by the door,” Benny pointed. “Said something about his car not sounding right.”
“What gives you the authority to make decisions about the things in which I feel, Dean?”
As a crooked arrow.
“Let’s do this together.”
"Please," Dean begged, tears forming in his eyes. "I just need to feel you."
Dean hovered the mouse over the name, working up his nerve to click it. Why was he all of a sudden so nervous to talk to her? They talked every day, some days more than others, when they planned it ahead of time. But now it was different.
“You need me to what?” Cas asked, kissing his cock at the base.
Dean was reeling over what had taken place throughout the evening. He should have stayed home like he had planned all along. He had learned from the last party that he was not a party person, give him a bar any day. But deep down, he knew that all of his anger was something else entirely. He only wished that he knew what it was. He couldn’t be this worked up over something as trivial as a party.
Castiel made his way back over to Dean, grabbing his arms and turning them to where Dean’s legs were pushed up against the side of his bed. Castiel looked into his eyes for a brief moment, searching for what Dean assumed was approval. Once Dean caught on, he nodded his head slightly. He was not going to stop him.
“No,” Dean shook his head as he answered. “I am generally a real freaking delight.”
“Okay,” Castiel nodded, his body loosening up. He was still nervous but Dean knew he was not going to run away any time soon.
[angelofthursday] Possibly. Crazier things have happened.
“Oh fuck,” Dean cried out when Cas hit his prostate. This was not lost on Cas who made sure to hit the same spot over and over again until Dean was crying out Cas’ name and cumming between the both of them. He was spent and his body was turning into Jello but Cas wasn’t done. He continued to fuck into Dean, using him to reach his own release. Harder and harder he thrust into Dean until Dean was screaming again. He hadn’t even realized he’d become hard again until he was cumming for a second time.
“Sam, you know I don’t do parties,” Dean leaned under the hood of a car to avoid having to make eye contact with Sam.
_____
“It is also not true,” Castiel told him.
“But do you think he will be there when I get there?” Dean asked again, making himself a little clearer but not clear enough for Castiel to fully understand.
“True.” Castiel laughed. “All of this is kind of insane as far as what he has done for us.”
“Cas?” Dean turned to look at his husband when he pulled into the small ice cream shop they usually came to on Claire’s birthday … and Dean’s. But he would never admit that getting the ice cream was always his favorite part of the day. “What are you doing?”
“I don’t know how I can be of much help,” Castiel responded once he was finished talking.
[angelofthursday] Good. Cause I have been looking forward to talking to you all day.
“I think,” Dean looked at Cas and then looked down at his watch. “I don’t think I am going to be able to make it to work in the morning, unless I can maybe get an hour of sleep.”
“When Lisa left you,” Castiel tried to sit up in his seat and find his voice. He was never good at being loud as it was, so Dean tried to calm himself enough to hear what he was about to say. “You were heart broken. Months passed and you just, you weren’t you. You rarely ever smiled. You drank way too much. I tried to make it better but you were slipping away. I thought … I thought if I could get your mind off Lisa, I would get you back.”
“Or what?” Balthazar questioned from where he was still sitting on the ground.
He had been knocking for ten whole minutes. He knew Dean was in there, his car was parked out front and he could hear music coming from Dean’s room. He tried to use his kept to get in but Dean had locked the chain lock and unless Castiel felt compelled enough to break it, he could not get in.
[greeneyedhunter] Oh? That is all I get?
[angelofthursday] Fine.
“But,” she began to voice her concerns but Castiel cut her off.
“Yes, Sir,” Dean said with a smile.
“Yeah?”
The studio goes silent as the cameras facing Dean and Cas turn on. Once the green light flashes on the screen, the show begins.
[Cas] I hate making decisions.
[Cas] I just know that I am going to be hurt for a while either way.
“Yes baby,” Dean growls. “Are you touching yourself for me?”
“How’s Bobby?” Dean decided to change the subject from Castiel for a while. “I haven’t seen him since Ben’s birthday.”
“It’s not?”
“Excuse me?”
“Meg,” Castiel glared at his girlfriend. “There is no need to be rude.”
Shrugging it off, Castiel heads back into the room and changes into his near pair of flannel pajamas. That was one of his favorite parts of the evening. He always bought them both a new set of matching flannel pajamas. Dean had protested the first year until Cas promised how much fun it would be to strip each other of them and make love under the tree after the presents were opened. Dean never complained about the pajamas again.
[angelofthursday] I came home one day, and she was in my shower.
“Have to ask what?” Dean inquired.
_____
“How,” Castiel spoke the words slowly, as he pulled all the way out and then slowly pushed the entire length of his cock back into Dean, “do we … handle our anger?”
I never really thought about him that way.
“First time for everything,” Dean whispered to himself as he leaned down and licked at the side of Cas’ cum covered cock.
You aren’t gay.
"You can talk in your sleep?" Castiel questioned. That seemed like a funny trick.
“You don’t have to do this,” Cas tried to tell Dean again.
“Now,” Dean continues on, “as you can see, we didn’t take it too well, but…”
“No,” Dean shook his head, bringing his eyes to lock with Cas’. “I want to.”
[Cas] Because I am not worried about me.
"Goodnight," Dean sighed.
[angelofthursday] Okay. So, how are we taking this risk? What does this mean?
[angelofthursday] My brother, the one I attend movies with, he is my best friend as well.
I could have been here earlier.
“We’ll see,” Cas laughs.
“Yeah,” Castiel agrees.
“I apologize.” Castiel stepped forward and placed his hand on her shoulder. “I will be quick. I only wish a few moments of normality.”
“You don’t have a soul,” Dean said again.
Deciding that he was just going to lock himself away completely for the rest of the weekend, Dean made his way down to his living room to go through his movies. Maybe a movie marathon and a weekend spent on his couch would help him realize just what a loser he actually was. Man, had he really let himself go.
[angelofthursday] No, wait.
Kind of a nightmare. But better now?
[greeneyedhunter] I am 27.
Dean watched as Cas made his way behind the bar. Knowing the owners also gave you bathroom privileges. You got to use the one upstairs in the apartment, not the one that was constantly being destroyed by random bar patrons.
[greeneyedhunter] Interesting.
“Now take off your shirt,” Castiel instructed.
“What?” Bella looked down at him confused, a slight glimpse of hurt in her eyes. “You need to leave? Are you serious?”
Finally, he gives up trying to get in the barn and turns around to walk away. A loud crash always stops him from taking his first step and he turns back to the barn, only to have the door wide open. It is at this point that he gets scared, unsure if he should enter the barn but he always does. He always finds his feet moving against his fear and soon he is standing right in the middle of the barn. It is dark and dirty and smells of musk.
“All you ever had to do was ask.”
“Say it like I’m a wrestler,” Dean suggests, earning him another laugh from the crew. “Like you’re a wrestler. You’re a pro wrestler, man.”
“What is that?” Dean rose an eyebrow toward Cas, strengthening the grip he had on his hand.
“You can be anybody,” Cas says again with a little more of an encouraging tone as he faces Dean.
It was five by the time they arrived at their camping spot. It was secluded, no other people around. Dean liked that. He hated going camping at a campground where you had people surrounding you at all times. But that also left him feeling trapped.
"What?" Dean went to sit himself up but his body would not allow for it. He sunk further into the hospital bed, trying to get a handle on his breathing. It didn't help that the heart monitor was beeping even louder now.
“Because I wanted to talk to you,” Castiel admitted.
“Sorry I am late,” Dean turned around to see Castiel standing right beside him. If Dean had not recognized his voice right away, he would have been slightly shocked when he saw him.
Why was it a nightmare? Or why is it better now?
“What are you doing?” He whispered to himself.
“Another time buddy,” Dean brushed it off as no problem. “You go ace that paper of yours.”
Dean pulled his truck into his normal spot around the side of the building. Dean had a thing for usuals. He frequented the same establishments, parked in the same spots and ordered the same thing. He was not against anything new in life, he just felt more comfortable with the things that he knew. He took the safe route in life. He had not always been this way but life shaped him. The parking spot was the perk to being the sort of step son to the owners.
What are you doing right now?
“Nothing,” Cas lies.
Agree to disagree?
Dean watched Cas climb into his bed. It was something he knew that he could watch forever. Hopefully this will be the beginning of getting to have this more often.
[greeneyedhunter] What if I love them?
“We may regret this,” Castiel jumps in to speak. “But we are going to do it anyway.”
[angelofthursday] Yes, cause you want to listen to all my problems.
[greeneyedhunter] Did?
Definitely.
[angelofthursday] Fine.
[angelofthursday] Oh yes. I spend most of my time alone in my house, in nothing but my robe, drinking ungodly amounts of coffee.
“You know me too well,” Dean held it up to himself. “Sam is going to be so jealous when I wear this tomorrow.”
“I’m not holding your hand,” Dean growls, pushing Castiel’s hand away as he tries to get back to pacing the set.
“Is this okay?” Dean whispered, his lips hot against the side of Castiel’s mouth.
Cas logged into Sam’s computer and began to search for anything and everything, doing exactly what Dean had already done. But he appreciated the help. But damn, Cas was sitting right next to him. Occasionally, their knees would brush up against one another and it sent chills through Dean’s body and made his cock strain a little harder against his jeans. He tried to brush it away.
Castiel reaches for the largest box and hands it to Dean. Dean rattles it around, a curious look appearing on his face. He looks at Cas for a hint but then quickly gets to pulling off the wrapping paper and tossing it behind him. Beneath the wrapping paper is just a large brown box taped shut.
The fairy shook his head no and offered Castiel a small smile. It was strangely reassuring.
“And what kind of things are on this list?” Castiel inquires.
“Hey Castiel,” Dean called over to Castiel who was walking up his front porch walk.
Goodnight, Cas.
[angelofthursday] My brother and I frequently go to the theater together.
“I hate to admit to you,” Castiel looked over all the parts of the car that Dean was showing off proudly. “I don’t really know anything about cars. I don’t even drive the one I have very often.”
“Barely,” Cas laughed. “We are school friends. If Balthazar was really my friend, none of this would have happened.”
“You mean,” Dean swallowed hard. He reached for his beer but changed his mind. He did not need to consume anymore alcohol. That would make this situation worse than it needed to be. “It was you?”
[greeneyedhunter] Maybe I do.
[angelofthursday] But I am interested.
[angelofthursday] I appreciate that Dean.
“Found my female doppelganger huh?” Castiel laughs.
[angelofthursday] Why didn’t you get married?
Ellen always tried to make sure that things were in order for everyone. When Lisa got sick, Ellen was there making sure that they were taken care of. She brought them food and stopped by once a week to help keep up with housework. And then when Lisa passed away, she did even more. She really was the reason that Dean was able to make it through the first couple weeks.
“What?” Dean asked, both shocked and confused by Castiel’s sudden change in behavior. “Why?”
“Dean, let me introduce to the crew,” Sam motioned to those who were in the room. There were not many but they seemed to be a very diverse group of people. The kind of people you would see paired together in a tv drama. If you didn’t know they were friends or no one told you, you definitely would not make the assumption on your own.
“Busy as always,” Ellen smiled at the thought of Bobby. Dean was always surprised they could stand to be apart from each other; they were so in love. They were high school sweethearts and it’s been love ever since. Dean couldn’t remember a time when they had even fought, though he was sure that it happened. “When he isn’t here or at home working on the truck, he is off coaching little league or some other sport for them kids.”
“But you already did that for me,” Dean shook his head. “I want to be able to do this for you.”
Where?
“Yes, Dean,” Castiel cried out only moment’s later, his thrusts becoming erratic. He continued to fuck Dean for a few seconds before pushing all the way into him and stilling himself, reaching down and holding onto Dean’s hips with enough strength to potentially leave bruises. Dean wouldn’t know until morning.
“That seems like a fair agreement,” Claire answered.
Fuck. This was not going to end well.
Dean gathered up the supplies he needed and put them all into a bowl. This one required his blood. Why did they always require his blood? But he did it anyway, pulling the blade across his hand and allowing for the blood to drip into the bowl. Once it was all there, he read the spell aloud.
[angelofthursday] How does that help me?
“Fuck,” Dean whispered under his voice. “I think I need another shot.”
[angelofthursday] I would like that.
“What about you?” Dean asked, changing the subject off of himself. “Tell me about your life.”
The only upside was that it was a vamp nest. They could track it down, get in, gank them and be done. He would only have to spend a short amount of time with Cas and then he could head home and get away from the angel. He felt bad. He had been blowing Cas off a lot lately and he could see it in Cas’ face that he knew it was happening. He was not as chatty with Dean as he usually was. It made Dean feel like shit but he couldn’t help it. He’d tried for the longest time but he couldn’t seem to be around Cas without having horrible, amazingly delicious thoughts about the angel.
“So,” Dean composed himself after a funny story Cas was recanting about them. “I think we need to talk about what happened in there.”
Dean was not sure how to transition into a serious conversation with Castiel, so he did the next best thing. He decided to show Castiel his car. He loved his car. When Ben was born, his father gave him his old 1967 Chevy Impala. Dean had loved the car when he was a kid but it stopped working when he was about ten and it was put in the garage. Dean begged constantly for the car and his dad finally gave it to him. He had been working on it over the years but it was not until recently that he was able to really afford to fix her up. She was almost ready.
“I don’t know if I can do this,” Dean admitted.
Okay, so her name was not really Angel, but that is what she called herself online. He had given her his name long ago but he could understand why it was hard for her. Though they had been talking for a little over a year, connecting with a random person over the internet was dangerous and scary. She would come around in her own time. He just hoped that it would be sooner, rather than later.
Castiel made his way over to a small little cubby hole in the corner of his room. He took the blanket from the end of his bed and folded it up, setting it neatly down to cover all the surface. Once he was finished he went over and put out his hand to the fairy.
Maybe that was why he could not hold down a relationship with anyone. He had dated here and there but with his mouth, it was hard to get someone to stick around. Not to mention that the options in his town were few and far between. He had known most of them since he was just a kid and that meant that they knew him as well. He has cleaned up his act over the years, but Dean was by far no one’s favorite person in the world. The only one truly interested in him was Lisa, the girl who moved here five years ago to take care of her aunt. She didn’t know any better and even though Dean was sure he could at least get a good lay out of her, he didn’t want to ruin himself in the eyes of the one person who didn’t see him like everyone else.
Can I ask you a quick question?
“Really?” Castiel finally mustered up the courage to utter the words sitting on his tongue.
Wouldn’t that make me at least Bi?
As Castiel looked amongst the carts and tattered tables laid along with the market, he searched for something, anything, that would intrigue him. He was beginning to give up, having at least the berries to bring back to Anna, when something back within the woods caught his eye.
You have lost your mind.
“Something has been wrong with you all night,” Castiel answered. “You aren’t nearly as talkative and I don’t think you have smiled nearly as much as you usually do. So, what is going on?”
If Dean could remember what it was like to smile, he would have. Rules were simple. You ate in the dining hall with everyone else. Food was not allowed in the rooms. It didn't happen often but Nurse Moseley broke those rules on occasion when she felt it necessary.
The moment Dean got home, he slipped out of his clothes and into the shower. He needed to wash off the entire evening that was sticking to him in the worst of ways. He could still smell the fire from the party and it was bringing up the thoughts about tonight. He just wanted to be able to forget the night and move on.
[angelofthursday] Because you are the best part of my day and I don’t want to lose what we have.
Dean reached back down between them and slowly stroked Castiel’s penis between his fingers, causing Castiel’s head to fall into the pillow, a moan rumbling in his chest. Slowly, almost too slowly, Dean stroked him, running his hand along Castiel’s length and then wrapping it around the tip to gather the pre-cum that had formed to use as lube before running his hand back down the length.
“Cause it would be fun.” Dean laughed as he nuzzled his nose into Cas’ neck.
[greeneyedhunter] My mom really loves Church.
“Jess,” Sam let go of Dean and wrapped his arms around his girlfriend. They had entered a smaller room with less people and Dean immediately felt more comfortable. “Look who made it.
Though it was the middle of the week, Dean was on his way to drop Ben off once again with his parents. Ben had the next two days off from summer school, even though it was in the middle of the week. Something about his teacher getting sick and needing to take a few days off. Whatever the reason, Ben wanted to spend his day off going fishing with his grandfather and who was Dean to argue. That had always been his favorite past time as a child.
[greeneyedhunter] Yep. Pays the bills but man am I tired.
“What kind of bet would you be making with students?” Dean inquired, wondering if it was something sports wise. Though, Castiel did not look like the type to really be into sports. Maybe something like Soccer, people liked Soccer right?
Dean waited for what felt like hours but was probably only a few minutes at most. He was almost about to turn around when the front porch light flickered on above him and the front door swung open. Dean covered his eyes briefly with his hand, the light a little more than he was ready for but soon it dimed and he could see Castiel standing in the doorway.
Dean pulled his truck to a stop around the corner from his house. He knew that if he made it home, he would be in for the rest of the night. So he was going to exhaust one more option before calling it quits for the evening.
Castiel reaches across the desk and sets the screen in front of them to where they can see the timer.
“Yes” Dean answered but the word was so broken by lust and desire. “Please.”
[greeneyedhunter] I cannot wait for ‘The Order of the Phoenix’ to come out.
[angelofthursday] Tell me about.
“What do we never do, Dean?” Castiel asked, stilling with his entire cock buried inside of Dean.
“And we made him sit in there for a few hours because we had to charge that stupid camera of his to take pictures,” Dean finished the story.
[greeneyedhunter] Say no more.
“Then get on your knees.”
“We were…” Castiel began before he was rudely cut off.
“We are talking,” Dean answered. “I just don’t think any of this is something that Cas would enjoy. He is probably going to have a terrible evening.”
“Don’t you dare…” Dean began to yell again but was met with dead air.
_ _ _ _ _ _
“Listen, Castiel,” Dean leaned against the side of the car. “I just wanted to apologize again for the other night. I was drunk and the night went horrible and I took it out on the wrong person.”
“All those raspy sexy sounding words,” Castiel continued, “they will surely be distracting.”
“Yeah,” Dean was surprised that Castiel knew that it was him on the other line. He did not remember saying anything yet. “How did you know it was me?”
Dean did as he was told and took a shower. He scrubbed as good as he could but he had reached the point where no matter how much he scrubbed, he was always going to smell just slightly of grease and his fingers were always going to be tinted a darker color than the rest of his body. It was part of being a mechanic.
“Okay,” Sam nodded. “We just have to wait for Cas to get here.
[Dean] Then it sounds to me like you already made up your mind.
“I thought about you tonight,” Dean told him. “This girl was hitting on me. She was tall, dark brown hair that was almost black and blue eyes.”
“If we don’t do this,” Castiel continues on, “we would probably go our entire lives without ever reading fanfiction about ourselves.”
“Is this what you want Dean?” Cas asked. “You want me to take control, manhandle you and completely wreck you without your feet ever touching the ground?”
“Sam?” Dean looked over at his brother, looking much older than he should be and more worn down. He then looked over at Cas, who looked less than put together. “Cas?”
"You aren't mine." Dean looked up at Ben, not meaning for the words to come out of his mouth.
“Dean,” Castiel went to speak but he was immediately cut off.
Dean brought his arms up and wrapped them around Castiel, pulling him in closer. He wanted to savor the moment but Castiel had other ideas. With a snap of his fingers, Dean instantly felt their naked bodies pressed together. His cock was hard and pushed into the side of Castiel’s thigh and he was certain he was not going to last long enough to actually have sex with him.
[greeneyedhunter] Are you still married?
Dean continued kissing Cas' body, working up to his nipples. He lightly flicked his tongue over them and just as Cas would make the tiniest moan of pleasure, he would bite down, causing Cas to arch off the bed beneath him.
Cas was pretending to be her all this time. I can’t believe he would do something like this.
[angelofthursday] This is true. But I would rather you know me as Cas.
Blue_Eyed_Angel: Lawrence.
Once in the room, Castiel tells Dean to stand in the middle of the room. Dean goes to grab some clothes first but Castiel pulls him back and into the middle of the room.
