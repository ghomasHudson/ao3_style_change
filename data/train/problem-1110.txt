»Stop lying. You want him to celebrate with us, too. Admit it,« John answered and pulled away to punch Sherlock’s shoulder lightly.
“I wasn’t st–“
Sherlock nods slowly, his eyes gleaming in the light falling through the windows despite the darkness. He pulls him closer, needing to hear that violent heartbeat, needing to know that at least one of the two people that still keep his world together is safe, even though ‘safe' is a state that never lasts very long.
been at the clinic, but where had he gone afterwards? Sherlock knew he was supposed to finish at 4 pm. It was almost half past seven and a couple of days ago (six to be precise), he just stopped telling Sherlock why he was always late for dinner.
“Stop it.”
It wasn’t fair of him, John knew that, but he was aware of the fact Sherlock didn’t need a lot of alcohol to cheer up a bit so he’d kill two birds with one stone.
John peppered his neck with open-mouthed kisses, running his lips and tongue over the places that he had grazed with his stubble before. Sherlock’s breathing picked up audibly. He did nothing to stifle his sounds. It felt too good.
Sherlock is right. John isn't the only one who suffered from the war, from the injury, from losing people, and yet all he has been thinking about was himself. He hasn't lost everything; he still has Sherlock and Rosie and all the other people who care about him who he keeps pushing away because he cannot deal with their pitying looks in their eyes. At least that's what he's seen in them until now. Maybe it wasn't pity. Maybe it was empathy.
“Wait, so you – you never even had a crush on someone?”
Bill shot John an ambiguous look and then turned his gaze to Sherlock. “Lucky boy, you are. He never shares that with us.”
“So did I,” John hisses. “I can’t choose between her and you. I
He carefully extricated himself from John’s protective grasp, but his head stung with every movement he made. Cursing under his breath, and cursing himself for making too much noise, he made sure he didn’t rouse John from his peaceful and sound slumber, but he was still miles away in another world of quiet and calmness.
He giggled when he tried to stand up once he was done, but his legs were so wobbly he landed right on his bum again.
John tucked Sherlock’s head under his chin so he could hide his face in the crook of John’s neck. “Shhh,” he breathed. “It’s okay.”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed. “Do I look like the athletic type?”
“Hello.”
John opens his mouth to speak, but Sherlock beats him to it. "I'm not alone, John."
»It was an emergency,« Sherlock groaned. »When will you finally stop holding the matter against me?«
Rosie stays quiet, too, not disturbing them in their bliss. John snuggles closer to Sherlock, tightening his embrace around his lank body.
Sherlock turned back around; he didn't need to watch any longer. The alcohol didn't make him forget. It didn't lift the crushing weight off his chest. And seeing John like this only worsened everything.
The very thought filled his stomach with nausea and made his head spin. Taking a sip of the steaming liquid, he burned his tongue, but he ignored the sting and cherished the heat running down his throat and making him feel warm all over, defeating the cold that wanted to grab him by the scruff of his neck and drag him to the ground.
“Quite patient whoever this may be. That’s unusual,” she said, lifting the blanket and sitting up. “I’ll have a look.”
“Lovely,” John muttered and soaked the flannel, wiping Sherlock’s forehead and his neck gently.
“Nothing? Your back is covered in wounds! Deep ones! Bad ones, God and I
“You kissed me a day later,” Sherlock countered, mirroring John’s position.
Of course he’d notice.
Sherlock shook his head with an amused smile and followed him without reluctance.
"Okay," John smiled, seemingly in a similar state, before attacking his mouth again, hungrier this time, taking the lead but always guiding him. He always waited for him to follow, and so Sherlock did, kissing back as best he could.
It almost tasted as good as John’s lips on his own.
He closed his eyes …
“I’ll have the tortelloni with spinach and chicken, please,” John answered and closed the menu, handing it over.
“I um …” He contemplated how to covey it without needing to explain himself. “I just don’t like it. Too crowded rooms aren’t really my favourite place to be in.” He swallowed, hoping John would let it go.
“You …”
John’s tongue and lips and hands were everywhere. His nipples, his hip, his knee. He peppered the inside of his thigh with small kisses, nipping gently here and there. His kisses came closer and closer to his groin. Sherlock held his breath.
“Fine, see you, then,” John cuts into the silence and heads downstairs to pick up Rosie.
John rubs a hand over his face, letting himself rest against the backrest of the chair. "It's not been so easy, these past few days. Weeks. Months." He huffs a sarcastic laugh.
John had called Mycroft and told him to get the pharmaceuticals Sherlock was going to need once the withdrawal symptoms got worse.
He sets the box down on the table in front of him, turns it various times. Then Mary comes back from the restrooms. The box is back in his breast pocket before he can even blink.
Sherlock had learnt from the first time John did this to him and used his hands to press John’s hips down to stay in control.
John flinches. He knows Sherlock is right, he knows he can't hide his thoughts forever - but he can at least try, right? "I don't want to put our friendship at risk," he says.
He hadn’t even cheated on
"Oh, do relax, darling. I'm sure you'll find it. And if you don't, I do know an excellent activity to fill your Friday night with." Winking at him, she got up and patted his shoulder twice. "I've got class now. Good luck with your search. Oh! And, you know, you could've spent your money more wisely had you decided to stay one more day."
“Good morning, darling,” he breathes. “Did you sleep well?” He realises she didn't wake him up last night at all. He smiles; Sherlock. Again.
His shoulders were very tense and quivered and
John crossed his arms over his chest and looked defiantly up at Sherlock. He was just slightly taller than him. “It looked a bit different to me.”
John can see him. He’s here. He’s saving him. Once again.
Some nights, Sherlock's pieces sound like lullabies, sometimes, they remind John of his rattling mind that cannot be switched off; then there are scrapes that make John's hair on the back of his neck stand up. But tonight, it hasn't been either of those. Tonight, it has sounded like a confession, as if Sherlock has laid bare his heart and let all the emotions pour out through the instrument.
“And you’ll get one. When Daddy picks you up from school tomorrow, you can stop by the supermarket and buy one, all right?”
“Look, I know what happened to you.”
“Getting an answer, obviously.”
“Your hair smells nice,” John murmured into Sherlock’s curls.
"I'm fairly sure he doesn't know where you are either. And that's good."
"John …" Sherlock begins, but this time John interrupts him with another breathless laugh.
“Would you believe me if I told you there wasn’t a single one?”
He goes downstairs, finding Sherlock in the kitchen. His shirt is rumpled and his hair curlier than usual. “Morning,” he says. “You're making breakfast.”
He pulls off of him quickly, releasing his erection.
Until everything went black.
“She’s a liar.”
He resisted the urge to open the cabinet where they stored the vodka and the scotch and went for a cup of tea instead.
“Admit it, you’ve been practising!” Greg leant forward on the table, crowding their personal space a little.
Pressure on his wound.
He wasn’t sure they could. Ever. Not with this feeling of guilt inside his chest. He turned around in John’s embrace, facing the window, the wall. Both were closing in on him. Suffocating.
“I can still hear you complaining,” Karla responded and raised a knowing eyebrow at her grandson.
“You okay?” John asked, his voice quiet, but Sherlock could hear the concern.
Thank you for reading! I'd love to know what you think in the comments :)
He rarely saw John in this light. The sun usually fell upon his features every morning as rainy days were rare in July, and it tinted his skin, painting it in various shades of gold until he appeared to be glowing. Right there beside Sherlock with his rosy cheeks rough from sleeping and his head pressed into the pillow, making him comfortable.
»You just wait!« he shouted and leant down to grab some snow and get his revenge when John rushed forward and rubbed snow in his face and neck.
»Be careful, it’s hot,« John said with a giggle.
“How generous of them.”
“You needn't fret,” Sherlock interrupts John's thoughts. “I wouldn't ask you to return if I weren’t completely aware of what that entails and entirely ready to–“
“Naloxone?” Sherlock wanted to know.
Sherlock eyed the five colourful pills. He shook his head to get rid of any doubts he still had. Maybe it would help him forget. Maybe just for one night.
Sherlock’s hand came to rest on John’s forearms, gripping the fabric of his linen shirt tightly as though he desperately needed to find something to hold on to, something to support and stabilise him. Sherlock closed his eyes and John closed the gap between their parted lips.
»Lie on your back,« John ordered and placed a hot water bottle he had prepared earlier on Sherlock’s stomach. He walked over to his armchair, reached for the blanket and wrapped it around his flatmate. »It’ll be better in a few minutes,« he said softly.
“Good thing we don’t have to be anymore, then.”
“No, you are.”
“She already knew. She’d already packed.”
John closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Jesus, Sherlock,” he breathed. “That was more than a year ago.”
"People wouldn't follow the action if there weren't at least a bit of romantic entanglement," Sherlock commented then.
“Oh, no!” Greg ran his fingers through his hair, grinning from ear to ear. “Sorry, how could I get this wrong? Let me correct myself. It’s his ‘let-me-fuck-
Sherlock sniffled audibly, burying his face in John’s shirt.
“Mate, I think you’ve had too much to drink.”
“That’s what I thought, too, yes,” John said, his voice strained. “I trusted you,” he paused.
He tries to remember what happened, but even his memories are a blur. A sharp pain runs through his chest, and he squeezes his eyes tightly shut.
Sherlock hummed. »It’s not like we’ve got work and got to go outside anyway.«
“Sherlock, do something, I swear to God.”
»It must be important if you turn up yourself, what happened?« he asked his little brother after he looked up from the documents that covered the table in front of him and then the scales fell from his eyes.
“I’m not coming, despite your enthusiastic attempts to convince me
________________________________________
John smiles at that. “Let me guess. You haven’t slept at all.”
Thanks so much for the lovely comments!
Sherlock takes him in deeper, as much as he can manage, making up for the rest with his hand. His tongue massages the underside of his cock with every movement of his head. John is so close already. His legs fall open wider to give Sherlock better access. Sherlock moans again, reaching down to fondle John’s balls with his other hand, caressing and massaging and cradling and pressing. The sight of him makes John even harder, his lips wrapped around his length and moving up and down so smoothly, sucking hard with hollowed cheeks …
Their tongues met, playing sweetly with one another; pressing, probing, but not fighting for dominance. Drowsiness started to overtake them slowly.
»John, having them around when we’re on a case is already exhausting enough, but celebrating together is– There’s no reason for me to do so anything when they celebrate not having a case at the moment. I’m glad when I don’t have to bear their non-existent intelligence for a while.«
“Yes!” Sherlock looked up from the phone and faced John, staring at him. “I have to put all the pieces together myself because everything you recently told me was far from the truth!” He turned to pour himself his cup of tea. Without another word he went to the living room and set it down on the coffee table.
“Why didn’t you come down to us?”
“Cheated on you, didn’t she?” Sherlock finished the sentence for him.
!” Sherlock protested instantly.
John looks over Sherlock's shoulder to read the text.
"Oh, Liebling, there's sunscreen for that," Karla chuckled, and her face crinkled a little.
Sherlock turns his head and faces him; shock and confusion are written all over his face. An image that is quite rare.
His lids. He doesn't want to go back to sleep …
A baby's wide grin, her curious eyes attentive to the little elephant held in front of her and her small fingers trying to grip its trunk conjure a smile on his lips. He is frozen in the doorway – losing track of where he is – as his eyes wander over the scene in front of him. There are no steps on the stairs behind him, no heels clicking on the creaking wood, no cups rattling on their saucers and cutlery clattering against porcelain plates as they are being carried on a tray. He finds the smell barely noticeable; just faintly registering it, not paying any attention to it whatsoever.
“Nothing, oh God, nothing. I just–“ He has trouble catching his breath, so John waits patiently. His fingers trail over his shin slowly nonetheless. Sherlock leans onto his elbows and reaches for him, pulling him into a breathy, uncoordinated kiss. “I want,” he whispers against his lips. “I want you. All of you.”
“Why does everyone assume I am not able to handle this on my own?” Sherlock inquired exasperatedly.
One of the librarians shushed them. Sherlock gave Irene an annoyed look. “See? I’m not the only one who feels disturbed by this conversation. “Will you
A break?
Sherlock is–
“We don’t have to,” Sherlock interjected hurriedly.
He remembered how he used to imagine this moment, but reality was so much better than his fantasy.
he gasps out as if he could hear him, pathetic. "Ahh–“
“It doesn’t really matter, does it…”
“Hmm,” Sherlock moans. “You love it, admit it.”
“How about we finish that and shake a leg afterwards,” he teased Sherlock who was letting his eyes roam over the spectacle in front of him.
"You won't," Sherlock promises, his voice calm and reassuring. He's so much warmer than John has ever seen him, and he briefly wonders if that is due to the talk they had a couple of nights ago. "Just talk to me, John. That's what people do, don't they?"
Sherlock breathed in and out through his mouth because John would have heard his sniffles if he didn’t. They were so close Sherlock could listen to John’s heartbeat. It was beating faster than it should be, as if he was worried and nervous at once.
“No,” Sherlock answered. “I like it.”
He closes the door behind them and pushes her up against it. Her bag falls to the floor. He can do this. He’s still got it in him. He presses his leg between hers, cups her cheek with this hand and kisses her. Hard.
cause a rather disconcerting twitch.
»I can give it to him another time,« Sherlock stated and rolled his eyes.
“God, you’re so beautiful,” he whispered, leaning forward to run his fingers over his torso.
“How does that feel?” he asked him.
“You just wait for the tricks,” Sherlock replied, rubbing his nose against John’s a few times.
His chest was heaving as he tried to keep his breathing under control. God, she must think he was traumatised.
He heard several whispering voices, saying things like »Did I have too much punch?«, »No, you didn’t, I can see it too,«, »This can’t be true,« and »Where’s Donovan? She owes me fifty quid now.«
Sherlock's comments on his moustache and Mary not knowing how to tell John that is, in fact, hideous, do not improve the situation at all. He has to let out his rage somehow, and Sherlock deserves the blows.
"I need a shower." John looked back over his shoulder, still completely naked just like Sherlock himself. "Would you like to join me?"
“And you talk about my funeral arrangements.” Sherlock shook his head as he walked to the kitchen to retrieve the sharpest knife they owned.
“Sherlock,” he breathes. “What did they do to you?”
The reality of it hit him hard. He had wanked to the image of John; of his body – his very
He dragged him to a place that was less crowded but still enough to teach him the basics.
He feels sick.
Sherlock rested his forehead against John’s. “For understanding.”
A hand grabs his own. It's larger and more elegant, and cold.
“Let them. I thought you didn’t care what people think?”
Sherlock got up and was about to hang it on the tree when John came downstairs with fairy lights.
Pulling back, he murmurs, “you’re making this harder than it has to be.”
two years ago.”
“Sherlock.”
His mobile pings just as he reaches out to grab the bottle of scotch just waiting for him.
“Getting better?”
Sherlock exhaled audibly. He knew this wasn’t the true story, at least he was 68 per cent sure. His brain had been running at full speed and strained to the utmost. John was probably right. Furthermore his worrying and panicking had wrong him out. He had fled into more work to give the engine in his head something to do, to give it some familiar work to ease the tension.
Their lips only touched for the briefest of moments before he pulled back, but, mortified at his heart overpowering his rational mind, Sherlock tried to extricate himself from John’s half-embrace mere seconds later. “Oh God– I … I–I’m so sorry, I didn’t–,” he stammered and whirled around, squeezing through the masses of people in the room to the exit.
to be orange,” she kept repeating.
“Is that so?” he asks lewdly, pressing against the gland one last time before letting his fingers retreat for now.
Sherlock always hated having his hair ruffled or having someone play with his curls, having someone run his fingers through the soft strands he’s spent hours taming in front of the mirror.
“Oh come on, you need to get your mind off that stupid paper,” Bill urged his friend. “Once you’ve handed it in, you’ll be able to enjoy yourself. And trust me, you’ll regret it if you don’t turn up. The org team have some pretty great things planned.”
Sherlock purses his lips as though he has to think about that first. “Hmm, no, I suppose it wasn’t
Sherlock’s breath caught in his chest and for a moment, his heart simply stopped. If a too slim waist and too pale skin were gorgeous, what were golden-glowing skin and a well-defined, muscular body? He must have been a god from another world.
»I won’t break your microscope, I promise,« John assured him.
“That’s the plan,” John smirked and kissed his thigh gently, almost innocently.
It's also available on
fine,« John said firmly. »Can you get up and walk?«
It was no use denying his feelings; Sherlock was aware of that, but taking this one last step was going to make him more vulnerable than he’d ever been in his life.
“I am
“The girl on that last picture, who is she?”
“I can’t remember, Sherlock. I– I’m really sorry!” Molly stammers, fumbling with her lab coat.
John rushed forward to hear what Sherlock said. “What’s wrong?”
At that moment, Sherlock allowed himself to be brave.
»How about you make me?« Sherlock asked provocatively.
“So, young man, how are you feeling?” Petra asked him with a complacent smile on her face.
“I have,” Sherlock counters, seeking the comfortable warmth radiating off John’s chest. “Quite well, too. Waking up to someone breathing next to you is an experience I’m not accustomed to but have no objections to whatsoever."
“Ask me what I had for breakfast. Easier question.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“And why is that?” Sherlock cocks an amused eyebrow.
John pushed his hair from his forehead. “We’ll see.”
He didn’t get an answer.
He pulls away and sinks deeper into the water, sighing contentedly. “You know, I’ve been thinking. Should we get a nanny for Rosie?”
Sherlock had no care for the songs making it to the charts, but the song, the cover recently published of the 70s original, had fit perfectly.
I hope you had as much fun reading as I had writing it, and if you enjoyed it, I'd love to hear what you think so far in the comments :)
“You did get that brunette, yeah,” Sherlock contemplated.
“Pretty weak. Sleeping lightly right now, but I don’t think he’ll be able to for much longer,” John sighed.
“How can you say that?” John breathes. Sherlock turns around to look at him when John has finished.
it, it’s absolutely beautiful.« John walked towards him and wrapped his arms around him, hugging him tightly. Tearing up a little, he buried his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. »Thank you, love. This was amazing, fantastic.«
Sherlock waited till he was done and gathered all the dignity he had left.
“You wanna watch a film?” John asked from the kitchen, peeking around the corner while the kettle started to boil.
The elder Holmes locks eyes with John, piercing him. The intensity of his gaze is overwhelming. It feels as if he leaves a hole in his body and fills it with ice.
Sherlock watched her with a little grin. “And heavy, hmm?”
Sherlock didn’t need the music paper; he already knew it all by heart. He tuned the instrument before he started playing the song that meant so much to him, almost as much as John did.
“Because I want to understand.” John looked so sad it made Sherlock feel sick.
“Of course, that was impressive!” John told him, still smiling. Looking down at his hands, he shook his head. “Wow.”
"Oh, if only I knew … I'm so bad with street names!"
John is not so lucky. Sleep will not relieve him from all the thoughts flooding his head and clouding his brain, growing louder and louder until it becomes almost unbearable. This is what Sherlock must feel like when the boredom overtakes him.
"Then what?"
“What, you didn’t like it?”
»Not very keen on finding out if Father Christmas has been here, then?«
Sherlock couldn’t answer him. He couldn’t even look at him.
773 days, 13 hours and 28 minutes after … oh for God’s sake why was he so sentimental and still counted the minutes?
"You know, my father's voice was always in the back of my mind, but that was the first time that I was able to ignore it," John said, sounding relieved. "Ryan taught me everything. He took me to gay clubs and helped me learn a lot about myself."
“Come on, that was quite an experience,” she laughed softly and turned back to John. “He was so fascinated, his little mouth agape, and the bee flew inside, stinging our poor boy into the inside of his cheek. It was swollen for ages.”
»Yes, fine.«
Sherlock tentatively wound his arms around John's waist, roaming his hands over his back. John shifted slightly. He straddled Sherlock's hips and deepened the kiss, sucking and nibbling at Sherlock's lips, playing with his tongue. He couldn't stop the little sigh slipping from his mouth. The comfortable weight on his middle and the tongue in his mouth were not only responsible for his unhealthy heartbeat but also for something else currently coming to life between his legs. All he felt in John's presence recently were a flutter in his chest and building arousal. It was enough to drive him mad.
else – and frankly, looked terrific in his shorts. No, Sherlock did not fantasise about him. He merely observed … though too avidly, as he realised a few weeks ago, because whenever the mental images of the blond man flashed up in his mind unexpectedly during a shower or whenever he lay in bed willing his brain to shut up, it felt almost impossible to keep his hand from going to places on his body he normally left untouched. He was above what the human race coined
Possibly, John just wanted to be close to Sherlock until he met another potential love interest and Sherlock was just a means to an end until this person turned up. Maybe what they were doing at the moment was enough for the doctor and he didn’t intend for them to go any further at all. Perhaps Sherlock just hoped John would be interested in him and a real and serious relationship with him because he was so starved of affection he was sure he couldn’t live without anymore now that John gave him something to crave and long for. It probably affected his objective way of thinking and his ability of observing things neutrally.
Over their giggles, they didn't hear the door open and the approaching steps.
“She’s brought so much more joy into your life than I ever could.”
“No arguments.”
Sherlock smiles. John’s heart goes up in flames. It doesn’t hurt. It’s glorious. “It’s a cross I have to bear.”
»How about we stay here?« Sherlock called, turning onto his back.
to do with us, you understand? Nothing. Don't blame this on us, don't blame our relationship. I know your impulsive reactions, and I won't allow you to go through with them this time, too." He grabs Sherlock by the shoulder and gently shakes him. "I don't blame you for this. So don't blame yourself either."
His thoughts were interrupted by John whistling the tune of White Christmas. He has been in a brilliant mood since the very beginning of December because Christmas was getting closer now and John absolutely loved the holiday. It was one of his favourite time of the year.
“That’s lovely. Your father will pick you up from the station. He’s been asking me to ring you for days now, since you never actually think of doing that yourself, young man,” she reprimanded him in her soft motherly voice.
Sherlock swallowed and sank back against the pillow. “I can’t believe I have to wait an entire day to find out.”
John chuckled softly. »So you’re amenable to …«
Just another small one. He’s already had three, but one doesn’t need to dwell on things, right.
Waiting for the kettle to boil, he found John’s phone on the kitchen table. Why had he left it here? Did he want Sherlock to find out himself? Spare himself the trouble of explaining?
The next forty-eight hours were going to be the worst; John knew that. He had seen many junkies come down from their high and they were more than just miserable.
»You jeopardised the security–«
“Just choose whatever you like,” Sherlock told him.
Should he simply do her the favour of turning up for five minutes, so she would finally stop pestering him about the matter?
sake, John, I’m
Sherlock naturally was no expert yet, but John had taught him some tricks that really seemed to work. He was certainly better than he used to be when they played in P.E. lessons. Part of him believed he was better at it now because he knew they wouldn't blame him for losing, so he didn't have to pressure himself as much as he always had at school, despite never really having been a part of the game at all anyway.
“As if you’re any different, Bill,” John commented, sitting down next to Mike who was following the conversation in amusement.
Sherlock sighed with a small smile as he obediently sat down. “Fine.”
“What about you?” he wants to know. Has to know.
"My, my," he says with an exasperated sigh, turning to John. "I would have never taken my brother for the emotional kind. But then again, he always is different when it comes to you, Doctor Watson." He smiles his infamous smile that is supposed to be friendly but too fake to seem anything else but forced. "I have come to see you and wish you well."
John's hands brought Sherlock's hair in disarray, carding carelessly through the thick curls while his pelvis pressed up against Sherlock's own. Their clothes need to go. Now.
John ordered a piña colada for Sherlock and a mojito for himself. They headed to a quieter place then, to have some space from the rest of the visitors. They sat down in the sand near their usual spot.
“Don’t try to hold it in. You’ll feel better afterwards.”
“Stop reading my thoughts.”
John’s smile widened at the hesitant question and he placed his right hand on Sherlock’s back. Sherlock almost melted into the touch.
He went in further, joining John where he stood, shoulders visible above the waves.
“Think I owe you that for last night,” Sherlock smiled and went with Greg and Bill.
Sherlock laughed and shifted closer, his hand wandering further up to John’s back and grabbing the fabric of his shirt.
»Sure?« It was another careful approach. »Maybe I could help?«
»Maybe not in
John hummed in agreement. “Meaning you’ll be buried in your books?”
»John, I changed my mind, can we go home, please?« Sherlock said, holding someone’s amused gaze until the man looked away.
“Sherlock, what are you looking for?” John asked calmly.
“What was that about?” he asked, puzzled, as they walked towards his usual shady place.
“Sherlock.”
»Did you just
“Well, can’t miss an experience like this when I’m on holiday.”
Sherlock pulls back, increasing the distance between them a bit. “When?” he wants to know.
“Mary wasn’t capable of more than standing by your side, ensuring you were still breathing.”
https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2764062923604641
Somebody knocked on his bedroom door and the detective groaned quietly. He had been on the verge of falling asleep. »Come in.«
“Nice to get out sometimes. It’s a change to the same old daily routine,” she says.
Anger has always done something to him in bed. Spurred on his arousal. Though he's not sure who is responsible for said state of his body right now. Sherlock or Mary. Mary moans into the kiss and kisses back with all her might, but John takes control of the kiss. He needs this. Just a thin thread of control. However soon it might rip, and two loose ends fall to the floor.
With that, he hung up. “Our boy really has grown up,” was probably what his mother said to his father now, who had been listening the entire time. She always put him on speaker.
“Definitely.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can I kiss you again?” John asked delicately. His breath was warm on his face, and Sherlock could only nod, his eyes falling closed. He let out a breathy sigh before John’s lips brushed against his own once more.
He wants to remember what happened, but every thought that dares to look back into the past feels like an arrow shooting through his skull. Instead, he looks down to his sternum covered by a thin hospital gown. He feels the thick, itchy bandages, and lets out a frustrated huff.
“Oh.” Her smile was infectious. “That’s a lucky coincidence.”
Chuckling.
“Mostly, yes, John.”
He did not only love kissing John's lips, though. Other parts of his body were equally mesmerising and entirely worth running his mouth over. That, however, was something not quite in his repertoire of expertise yet. He had internalised how it should feel when their lips glided against one another. Skin was something different altogether. It did not respond in any way, did not return the touches. It took a while before it felt natural to him, running his mouth over John’s neck, involving his tongue in the game, which was even harder, for some reason. The taste of salty skin made up for the difficulty, though.
»Well, of course it’s predictable,« John said with a soft laugh. »It’s a fairy tale after all.«
So he nods, grabbing John's hands and placing gentle kisses on them, the fear has subsided. He feels relieved. “I promise,” he whispers.
John got up and walked around the table, standing behind Sherlock’s chair and resting his hands on his shoulders. He bent forward just slightly and Sherlock looked up at him.
The governor is dead. John is beginning to think he is on the brink of that, too. The light seems to move farther away. Or is he moving away from it? He cannot run. He is merely able to watch himself in his dream. Is it even a dream?
“Was this in there?” Sherlock quavered.
“I deeply regret to inform you, but you could have spent this money more wisely,” Sherlock told her, looking up from the sandwich he didn’t actually intend to eat.
“I can’t stand working with idiots,” Sherlock shrugged.
»You’re not helping…«
Rosie, who was sitting on the sofa, watched the two of them from a safe distance between herself and the sharp knife with a smile playing on her lips. “You do, Daddy,” she laughed.
“Making you take care of Rosie when I can’t – I know you never signed up for that, hell, I shouldn’t have brought this on you, but I have. The morgue, the le–“ He closes his eyes and swallows hard, hoping desperately Sherlock didn’t hear the slip. He cannot talk about this now. He hates himself for it. Merely thinking about the damn letter makes him feel sick.
"So, what did you find out?" Molly asks, trying to catch a glimpse of Sherlock's sample.
Sherlock’s breath was trembling when John told him all this.
“What is it?” John breathed and kissed his jawline. “What do you need?”
“Sherlock …” John had fallen asleep in the chair once again, resting his head on his arms on the table in front of him. “What’s wrong?” He got up and knelt beside the bed, following Sherlock’s gaze.
Sherlock puts the card on the table beside him. “You need to rest.”
"You were not responsible," John insists. "Not for any of this." It takes a while before Sherlock's last words sink in. "You… you did what?"
John’s hands wouldn’t stop caressing his back.
Before he knew it, he felt a warm hand on his shoulder. Letting his head fall forward in defeat, he turned around, feeling naked and exposed under John’s clear and watchful gaze.
Sherlock lost himself in the feeling for a while when suddenly a new song was played that unleashed a cry of excitement from the masses on the dancefloor which was now being extended to every occupiable space between tables, benches, and stalls.
»If I’ve done anything wrong, just– tell me,« John finally broke the silence.
»May I remind you of activities that happened earlier on and inform you about the fact that even this way of physical exhaustion will lead to a feeling of hunger eventually?« Sherlock raised his brows without looking at him and buttered the bread.
Whenever he woke, he was achingly hard. Not that Mary minded much, but then there were Sherlock's comments on his performance. They decreased in their frequency eventually but never disappeared altogether.
John was sitting between his parted thighs, his eyes roaming over Sherlock's naked body. He felt exposed. Terribly exposed. Of course, it was just John. John who knew him better than anyone else he had ever known, John whom he trusted with his heart and his life, John who he would have to learn to trust with his body.
“The spider.” He shuddered and closed his eyes.
He's always there.
“I do when they all think the same of me.”
"It's called John."
John laughs quietly and presses a last kiss to his hair before he settles down against the pillow to sleep – with the knowledge that when he wakes up, Sherlock will still be here.
Mycroft looks at him in confusion. "What?" He twirls his umbrella. "No, not Miss Hooper. There is no reason we would– what is going on in that little brain of his, Sherlock?" He sighs, exasperated.
John leans back in his chair, cracking the knuckles of his fingers. He yawns as he stretches, feeling his bones protesting loudly.
Sherlock didn’t know how close they actually were, but it felt as if John sang directly into his ear; he shivered as the soft breath brushed his skin. The music poured into his frozen core and a hot rush of heat ran through his veins like an electric current.
He stopped and scratched his leg, getting a closer look at the handgun. There was no mechanism to lock or unlock it. "Sorry," he said and started walking again, trying to hide his tiny triumphant smile. The gun was fake, but the man’s muscles weren’t. He would still be able to overpower him, though maybe he could use his wits to get away.
But Sherlock was frozen. He hoped his hands weren’t sweaty and his hair didn’t smell bad; he wished they could stay in this position until the end of all time; he wanted to keep John here forever because for the first time, the doctor held him the way he did in his dreams. He cared about Sherlock, that much was clear now; and it was real; as real as Sherlock’s quick breaths; as real as the feeling of being set on fire because that was what Sherlock felt like; as real as anything would ever be.
, John thinks, pleased.
“So you dabble in police investigations?”
Sherlock looked up at him, desperate to know if John was aware of what he had done.
"I just don't understand why you would … like someone like me," Sherlock muttered, his teeth chattering a little from the cold.
“So I’ve heard,” Sherlock responded.
He and Greg were 19:20 behind them when the set was about to come to a close. It was John's term to serve. As always it was very firm and almost impossible to block, but Sherlock tried it anyway since his height was his advantage. The blocked ball fell back into their half, was brought back up by Bill who landed in the sand trying. John attempted to get the ball back under control, but when he set it to Bill, he failed at smashing, and it landed in the net.
Shrugging, he entwined their fingers with a content sigh, watching the snow falling slowly and quietly.
“What happened to John I’m-Not-Gay Watson?” Sherlock asks instead. They’re lying side by side on the sofa now. It’s too narrow, but neither of them wants to move.
“Do you want me to leave?” he heard John ask. It was a question to which he had no answer. Did he want him to go for John’s own good? Should he keep him here for his own selfish reasons?
Greg smiled when he saw the two of them and shook both their hands.
He shook his head, squeezed his eyes shut, and sniffled one last time before he let the door fall into the hinge a little too heavily.
“Not at all,” Sherlock answered and sat down on the bed beside John, leaning just a little closer to catch a glimpse of what John was reading.
Sherlock shot him an exasperated glance as if he’d never do anything stupid or rash even and Greg just shook his head at the two men.
He nodded, especially relieved about that last part. “Thank you.”
John returned her warm expression. “I’m lucky he’s mine,” he answered and took the bedding to Sherlock’s room where he was just pulling out a spare mattress from under the bed.
Yes, what would it be?
That made her laugh. »I never thought of it like that,« she admitted. »But you’re right. Tell me, then, John. What part do you like best?«
“Sherlock,” John tried again. “There are people around you who care, people who are worried. Your brother and I probably worry the most, so why can’t you just admit,” he paused for a moment, “you need help to the people who are more than willing to provide it?”
He had been desperate. He had gone out to look for John, but of course he wasn’t at the clinic anymore and nowhere else to be found eiher. He’d asked Greg and Molly. Nobody knew a thing. Turning to his brother for help was not a path he was willing to take, so he had returned to 221B without any luck and an aching heart, pounding hard with worry. Pacing up and down in their living room and not knowing what to do, he went out to look for John again. Without any luck once more.
“Maybe a bit less than that,” Sherlock corrected him, relieved he didn’t scare Greg off either.
John’s hands wandered around his waist, slowly coming up his back to rest on his shoulder blades, radiating warmth in their path on this chilly, rainy summer evening.
He can’t talk about this now. He would end up apologising as he had a few nights ago and Sherlock would vehemently tell John not to seek fault in himself.
After 45 minutes, Petra focussed once more on breathing techniques and then ended the session. Sherlock had to admit that he was feeling oddly at ease now. The feeling of nervousness had faded into a corner of his body that would not bother him for a while now. At least, he hoped so.
Sherlock did.
John nibbled at Sherlock’s bottom lip, educing a quiet and pleased sigh from him. He pressed him down into couch and their bodies welded together. A hand tugged at Sherlock’s curls, making him hum at the sensation.
John looks up from his whiskey glass when he hears Sherlock coming down the stairs. It's become a ritual, this, Sherlock reading a bedtime story to Rosie, kissing her goodnight. Frankly, John finds it adorable to see Sherlock like that with her. Whenever he watches his daughter and his best friend, his heart swells with joy and pride and love for the two of them.
"Why–" John's voice breaks over the hoarseness of it. "Why are you doing this?"
John grimaced when he tried to nod.
"D'you sleep well?" John asked as he tightened the arm that he had flung around Sherlock's warm body. John's hand always felt warmer, though.
John heads for the door, still carrying Rosie in his arms. When he opens it and sees Sherlock, he can’t help but laugh breathlessly. “I should’ve known,” he scoffs and shakes his head.
Sherlock complied, trying to stop his legs from shaking. “Where?”
He woke again when he felt a careful hand on his head, in his hair precisely. In any other moment, he would have cherished the gesture, but right now all it did was making him more miserable.
They close in on him.
The material slid over his hipbones and his buttocks, and when John discarded his pants entirely, Sherlock didn't dare to look down.
“Am I everyone else?” she asked and made him look up now.
“Harder, eh?” Sherlock grins and carefully nudges against John’s middle.
Some nights, Sherlock fell asleep with his head tucked under John’s chin, their arms draped over each other’s bodies, fingers playing drowsily with the hem of one another’s shirts, innocently touching the heated skin beneath it until the night let its veil fall over their exhausted forms.
“Horrible at packing, are we?” Sherlock teased cheekily, taking out a random cassette and glancing at it.
, he thought when he remembered the night of his breakdown,
“Are you preparing me for anything?” Sherlock asked as they lay beside each other on his blanket a while later.
He still hasn’t found it.
His head turned; he just had to look at John to see what he was thinking. His emotions were always so clearly written all over his face, evident from the way his lips curled upwards or the lines on his forehead or the softness that lay in his eyes.
A small, crumpled-up, violet ticket to the Winter Wonderland Christmas disco stood out against the crimson silk inside the violin case.
“Of which we’re both clean,” Sherlock cuts in and then sighs, running a hand through his still wet hair. “Just put it on and don’t spoil the moment talking about doctor-y points of controversy; there’s time for that later. And now, get on with it.”
“That’s more or less what I heard before,” John answers, rubbing his hands over his face.
“I changed my mind,” he breathed against John’s collarbone.
“Because I know exactly what you were about to ask.” Another grin appeared on Sherlock’s lips. “It was literally on your forehead in huge letters.”
, he reprimanded himself.
Sherlock stirs a little as his breaths become shorter until he breathes in deeply and cranes his neck, turning around in John’s arms.
_________________________________________________
Sherlock tried to get his breathing back under control, but it was so difficult. "… We broke up."
They lay in the cool sand, but their bodies were warm. Sherlock leant in for a kiss; his eyes fell closed when their lips touched. Just for the briefest of moments, no tongues, just a soft press of lips against each other, maybe a tug here and there, but nothing else.
Sherlock took a deep breath, not wanting to pull away just yet. John’s chest felt inviting and comfortable and if he had the choice, he would never let go again.
“John, no––“
»I was six or seven when he started to abuse my mum; he would hit her until she cowered in the corner of the sitting room with a black eye or a bloody cheek, but that was just the beginning. She was covered in bruises all the time. My father wouldn’t give her time to heal, he would just carry on hurting her.
, Sherlock knew that. John's dream must have been very vivid, and it must have involved him in some way since he checked on him as soon as he had woken up and kissed him passionately; as if he had to make himself realise it had been just a nightmare. Not real. Not anymore.
Thank you so much for reading!
“How did you manage that, then?” he teased when they were seated in the back of the restaurant.
“Sherlock?”
John was already there, sitting in the sand by what had become
Perhaps that is the reason why he asks her out for a coffee later that day. “Not the crappy one in the vending machine. There’s a Harris and Hoole just around the corner. If you’re up to it.”
They had been careful, but in the end, the inevitable happened, and when Karla’s pregnancy showed, everyone expected she was going to be left alone, and they were right. He did leave, but only to be deployed to another base in the zone, not because he wanted to.
“I need–“ Sherlock folded his arms around John’s neck for the second time that night, keeping him close so he couldn’t see his face.
"Why would I waste my time with a girl whose attitude towards a faithful relationship is more than atrocious?" he asked dismissively.
“Sod off.”
Sherlock closed his eyes. The pain still ripped through him like a dagger, but he couldn’t wince, he couldn’t scream, he couldn’t let John know. “Because I’ve been alone all those years and I never had a problem with that before.”
Sherlock let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. Even after an entire evening of drunk dancing, kissing and even sex, his thoughts still had the upper hand apparently. He nodded as his shoulders relaxed a little.
»When?« he asked.
»It was …« the dark-haired man cleared his throat. »It was nice.«
John looked down at his hands.
“Let me get to the point–“
Why did he have to work today? How could he leave him alone in his lethargic state? Besides, he should be home already. It was almost 7 o clock and his shift was supposed to finish at 6pm. Where the hell was he? Sherlock began to grow impatient.
Sherlock swallowed hard. This was it; he wouldn’t be able to get out of this unhurt. He closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, bracing himself for whatever was coming when two arms swung around the giant’s neck and pulled him backwards, choking him.
I know I'm terribly late, but I'm going to finish these, I promise!
"I didn't expect you'd cook. In England, we have warm meals–"
“Okay,” John answered and did as Sherlock asked him.
John grins and rolls his eyes as he runs his hand over Sherlock’s cheek and then brushes away an errant curl from his forehead. “That mouth of yours is very talented in various respects,” he tells him. “But I don’t want to come like this. Not tonight.”
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to,” she reassured him. “But it’ll help, talking about this.”
This was the moment when the dam broke and burst. He couldn’t hold back the emotions threatening to overwhelm him anymore and was shaken by silent sobs as he clutched John’s shirt tightly.
He sounds wistful.
“What is?”
“Yes, haven’t got anything planned for the rest of our stay, really. From now on, everything’s more or less spontaneous.”
He doesn’t know how much time had passed or how it happened at all, but eventually, they’re in Sherlock’s bed, limbs tightly wrapped around each other. Sherlock’s head is tucked under John’s chin, his breath warm on John’s chest. John breathes in Sherlock’s scent, the smell of his ridiculously expensive shampoo and something that is just Sherlock.
“You are a bad man,” John utters between the delicate tugs of Sherlock’s lips against his own.
“Because you thought I’m clever and charming and I would make friends eventually. I didn’t want to think of me as a disappointment since everyone else already did,” Sherlock sighed and didn’t dare to look at her.
“This has got nothing to do with you,” Sherlock repeated the words he had already told Mycroft on the jet.
"How much confirmation do you need?" Sherlock asks disbelievingly.
John was different in so many ways. He wasn't put off by Sherlock's straightforward manner or his deductions, by his cleverness. It was the exact opposite. At first, Sherlock had to admit to himself, John had been slightly sceptical, and he was also shocked when Sherlock deduced his sister's alcoholism. Sherlock feared that might have driven him away there and then, but it was just his initial reaction to his observations which added to his annoyance caused by Harry's problems with her girlfriend and then faded completely. He stayed despite everything… and he called him brilliant.
He was torn between watching John’s every movement and throwing an arm over his face to merely focus on the sensations. Visual input was enough to make his entire body tingle.
His arousal flagged a little, but he did not want John to stop. He wanted to know what he was going to show him. To feel. To finally feel.
“Oi mate, what’s wrong with Britney Spears?” Greg interjected. “I think she’s a fine lady. Nice voice ‘n everything.”
“He’s better than I thought,” John grinned as he picked up the ball and threw it over the net.
“Sherlock,” John woke him gently.
“Nothing, I just––“
John grinned when Sherlock returned and handed him the knife. “Good to know you have weaknesses.”
Sherlock shakes his head so slowly, John barely notices. "Let's not talk about that."
“What’s that?”
Sherlock laughed at that and kissed back, drowning in the sensation for a few more minutes before they left the welcoming warmth and intimacy the bed provided.
, Sherlock was about to say, but he only just managed to hold himself back.
But is it really a mistake? To want to reach out for what he did not
When the drinks were downed and the conversation took a turn towards sports again, John suggested they play the second set, which he and Bill lost again, but only narrowly. Sherlock told him it was lucky he didn't bet on their win and John threatened never to teach him anything again. All the while a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and Sherlock wondered if there had ever been a moment in which John didn't look happy. He simply couldn't imagine it. All he had seen was the way his face lit up when he grinned or laughed or giggled and decided he never wanted him to look sad. He knew how irrational he was being, but every time John smiled, he couldn't help but do it, too. It was too infectious and irresistible.
They stayed in this position until it got too uncomfortable. John turned and sat on the edge of the bed and Sherlock felt a wave of panic run through his veins. “Where are you going?”
Something odd had happened then because Sherlock truly left. John didn’t wake up. The remainder of his sleep was not peaceful and but dreamless, and that was some progress, he thought.
Sherlock fell asleep looking forward to it.
Sherrinford. The prison. An asylum? Most certainly. There is the woman who calls herself Eurus Holmes.
»Aren’t I always nice?«
“You don’t have to,” John said immediately. “Seriously.”
"I have told you before, and I'll gladly do it again, John. You're doing yourself a disservice–"
Sherlock hesitated, looking down at his hands. John didn't know that he had no friends, not before Molly, and not after she left. How was he supposed to let him know without risking chasing him away? It said a lot about a person when they could never keep a friend, or even make a friend. Would John be put off by that? Would he realise Sherlock had more bad than good sides and leave?
Sherlock stretched and realised his entire body was aching. He felt a bit sore and he had a slight headache, too. Folding back the duvet, he got out of bed and rubbed his eyes.
“Then we’ll sleep,” John said and rolled to his side, his hand not leaving Sherlock’s hip.
“You’re amazing, bloody amazing.” John’s words came out between heaving breaths.
He pulled John back up to recapture his mouth while his fingers wandered to John's trousers, pressing the button through its hole and pulling down the zipper. He had got a lot better at this, considering how his hands were shaking the first time they undressed each other.
Sherlock interjects.
Mycroft reached for another paper and scribbled some notes on it.
His laugh was contagious.
John carded his hand through the mess of Sherlock's curls. In contrast, the other hand travelled lower, brushing over his neck, his collarbone, down to his chest, taking his nipple between thumb and forefinger and rubbing it between both fingers, making Sherlock hiss at the touch. He broke the kiss to focus his attention on Sherlock's nipple, licking, sucking, biting gently and rubbing his tongue against it, over it, around it.
»I don’t have any.« John shook his head vehemently. »I’m going to take whatever you’re ready to give me,« he assured him and took a step towards him. »This is not a competition of who’s had more experience. This is new and different and bloody damn terrifying, but don’t you think we should give it a chance, having waited for it for … God, for years?«
“Do you think you can sit in the chair for just a minute?"
»John, please,« he panted. »Oh,
John moved closer and reached for both his hands, enclosing them in his own. “Sherlock, this is about your future, not about us.”
The detective could definitely get used to this.
Sherlock gets up eventually and steps out, handing John a towel. They make a quick job of drying themselves off, and with their hair still dripping slightly, they stumble into the bedroom and fall into bed.
“You told me to move on!”
»Since I’ve moved back in with you, I tried to come to terms with something I should’ve accepted a long time ago. When you– jumped off that building and I thought you were dead, my whole world shattered to pieces because when you left, you took my best friend, my work and my home with you. It was not the same when you were gone.
»All right.«
»Look, let’s go and find Greg,« John answered and grabbed his arm.
John laughs and kisses his sweaty forehead before he reaches up, opens their bedside drawer and retrieves the lube. “Give me that pillow over there,” he says. Sherlock complies and lifts his hips, having already guessed John’s thoughts. John places it beneath them and then squeezes a considerable amount of lube into his palm to warm it up a little. “You’ll tell me if–“
“All right, but be careful!”
“Didn’t think you’d come here,” John smiled, sitting down on the barstool to his left. He looked so handsome in his marine blue shirt and his jeans, despite the fatigue covering his entire face and exhaustion lingering in his bones. He was apparently pleased to see a familiar face. Well, not
A moment later, he felt a warm hand drawing soothing circles on his back. It was just a dream, Sherlock reminded himself. Mary was gone and John was here in his bed. He was here by his own choice (more or less) and he actually tried to help Sherlock calm down. This wasn’t John being nice; this was John caring about Sherlock who just woke up from a nightmare; John who wanted to make him feel better; John who wished to spend Christmas
John had made every effort to come up with a detailed and cleverly thought out yet almost completely dishonest excuse. He had obviously never even listened to him.
“I’m afraid this will be a shock for both of you.”
She turned her head, and her eyes shone brightly. "Angry?" she asked incredulously. "Don't be daft. I was waiting for this for weeks!"
Okay here we finally are! I have to say that this chapter was the most fun to write. I can't even tell you :D
, the pain and the heartbreak as he realised that he was not important enough to be told that he was planning to die and fake his death to defeat Moriarty sit deep inside his chest and gnaw at his heart.
John noticed.
“I’m not,” Sherlock said calmly. “I’m just stating the facts.”
It still made Sherlock feel embittered. He didn’t mean to upset John. All he wanted was to solve the case! And in that moment, the chemical reaction he was about to witness was more important than–
“We met briefly,” the waitress told him. “Your friend wasn’t very keen on listening to my advice about girlfriend trouble. Now I know why,” she chuckled softly.
When the bullying first started, there had not been a single day on which he didn't come home with tear-stained eyes. His parents' consolation had helped at first – a lot – until the next day. Until the next time it happened. It had taken him a long time to keep his features under control – at least until nobody could see him break down; mentally or physically.
Sherlock presses a kiss to John's forehead, suddenly growing very quiet and very warm. "I have not known true happiness until you walked into my life, John, ever since you came into the lab at Bart's, you've had … such a huge impact on me." John feels elegant fingers running through his hair, drawing calming circles on his skin. "Molly is a great friend, and she matters a great deal, but she couldn’t be any more than that."
“Acceptable, I suppose. More or less.”
He wanted to spend as much time with John as possible and wanted John to want the same thing. He had turned his life around after a few hours only, and the impact he had on him was enormous. Sherlock wished John knew that, and he wished his role in John's life was just as important as John's was in Sherlock's. He shook his head. He knew this was ridiculous, but nevertheless, he wanted it more than anything. Meaning as much to John as he meant to him.
John laughs bitterly at that. “You think you’re very clever, do you?
»Well, I guess that’s one way to look at it,« John chuckled quietly. »It wouldn’t be a surprise if there was no wrapping paper, would it?«
insist you'll treat yourself as well," John told him firmly.
Sherlock didn’t turn.
Once the shirt was discarded, he reached for the bottle and squeezed a good amount of lotion into his hands, spreading it evenly on his arms, neck and chest.
»Lowbrow,« John murmured, trying to retain his grin.
Sherlock's head shot back up and his eyes focussed within a second. "John," he cleared his throat. "John." How long had he zoned out?
He sniggers silently. God, him accessing all these information, that must be what Sherlock feels like when he goes out and deduces stuff.
is on in a minute. Do you want to watch it?« he asked instead.
Sherlock closed his eyes and shifted closer, entangling their legs and folding an arm around John's middle. Their foreheads touched, and for a while, they lay there, just breathing in each other's air, their colognes mingling and engulfing them in a soft haze.
"Good," John whispers and gives Sherlock a final squeeze. "Now you go and sit down, I'll get the kettle going and call Greg." Sherlock obeys him and flops down in a chair, staring into the distance with unfocused eyes. John hurries to get the kettle boiling for the second time that morning, then takes out his phone to tap in Greg's number. He fills the DI in as quickly and as thoroughly as he can while Sherlock sips his tea lethargically.
“I just showed you, didn’t I?”
“If you had slept upstairs last night, this wouldn’t have happened. If we hadn’t– if I hadn’t distracted you–“
“It’ll take a few minutes to set in, but you’ll feel better soon,” John assured him and the gentleness in his voice made Sherlock feel even more nauseous.
"I'm not blaming you," he whispers. "Do you hear me? This isn't your fault, all right? You are not at fault. Neither of us is."
