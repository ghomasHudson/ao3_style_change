Sherlock wants to tell him to speed up, to give him more, but god, that slow slide looks good on camera. He watches his cock on screen, John taking him deep. He's never been one for pornography, but fuck if this doesn't just do it for him.
John snorts, pulling his lover in close. He's just drifting off when he hears, "Maybe next time, if I'm really bad, you'll have to use the riding crop." He cuddles Sherlock in his arms, and falls asleep.
"And this larger section in the bottom is for ropes and cuffs."
"Your tongue. Your tongue in my arse."
"You put me in charge of this relationship, Sherlock, and you've been naughty. I really must punish you for it," he says with a smirk.  He glances at Sherlock who's standing mouth open, eyes blown wide, nodding vigorously.
"Of course, John. Softer for the delicate pieces."
"As always you see but do not observe."
No response
"And graduate and spend our lives together?"
"Now, Sherlock, what did we learn from this?"
"Thanks. I'm aware."
John tucks his hands deep in his pockets and walks around to the other side, ignoring Sherlock's questioning glance.
"Yes, well, one of those we need to sleep, and one should be your lab. I don't want your experiments scattered everywhere like they are now. This apartment is both of ours, so we have to have some rules."
John's hand lands on Sherlock's arse, and Sherlock jumps in surprise.
John grabs the lube off the bedside table and sits back on his heels between Sherlock's legs. He uncaps the top, and covers his fingers. He slowly circles Sherlock's hole with his left hand, right hand stroking up and down his partner's thigh and back. He presses one finger into Sherlock, who groans and rocks back into his hand.
"Yes. And if I'm not in the mood I'll tell you. And we'll do it later."
"I should hope not, John."
"I didn't realize I could."
"I'll do better than that," John replies with a wink. He slowly slides his hands up under Sherlock's button-down and pinches his nipple.
"Yes, sir," he says brokenly, "I want your tongue."
And there went the night.
Sherlock flushes, turns on his heel, and obeys. Obeys. He actually obeys.
He grabs the waistband carefully with his teeth in front as he slides his hand up Sherlock's thighs to cup his arse. He hooks his thumbs into the back of the waistband and, pulling with his teeth, slides down Sherlock's pants.
"Mmmm that's nice."
Sherlock pants, too stunned to move. John grabs Sherlock bodily and hauls him onto the bed on his hands and knees.
"Now, stay still."
"Lingerie, of course."
"Yes sir."
He tries. Oh god he tries. And fails every time.
"Sherlock, I'm going to bed. Goodnight."
"Of course you can, you berk."
John doesn't want careful. He knows what he wants and it's the exact opposite of careful.
And he tries to focus. He really does. But then there's Sherlock bending over the body, and that godsdamned arse is right there, and he feels his hand twitching.
"This is what good geniuses get if they ask nicely, Sherlock. Do you think you can ask nicely next time?"
"Now, if you can't keep your hands there, I'll tie them there, but I'll be very disappointed."
"Please let me make it up to you. I owe you."
"You want to go to bed together?"
"Oh fuck," John pants, eyes blown wide. He starts to slide his hand down into his own pants but Sherlock stops him. Eyes not leaving the screen, he licks John's palm until it's dripping. He drops it abruptly, and John unbuttons his jeans and grabs his own cock roughly. Sherlock watches tiny screen-John on his knees, Sherlock's cock in his mouth, as real-John wanks quickly next to him. As screen-John pulls off, Sherlock coming on his face, John gasps loudly and comes hard onto his stomach.
---------------------
"Excuse me?"
"Yeah, but she's taking me out to dinner so I can't complain."
"Oh, John. Do you really want me to tell you?"
------------------
"No, you misunderstand me. You're an idiot because you're sorry. Now, if you're really quite done eating, I'd like to suck you off under this kitchen table."
"Oh well, you know. Dating more."
"You can fall asleep whenever, wherever, you want, if that's what I get in return. I'll even procure some sedatives for you."
No response
He follows Sherlock to the street, catching up as the cab pulls up to the kerb. Sliding in next to Sherlock, he focuses on the view out the window. He almost doesn't even notice his hand sliding across the seat to graze Sherlock's leg.
"Good, now, hands on the headboard, do not move."
"Well, I spent all my savings on the flat deposit, so unless you want to ask your brother -"
"I told you, stay still."
So why can't he keep his hands off Sherlock's cock?
"Lestrade, this is clearly an accident caused by an idiot's idea of romance. Find the fiancé and pull the engagement ring out of her lung. Let's go, John."
"Fine," he grumps, starting to shove things randomly in the large boxes John had brought.
"Oh yes, John, I even have a few matched sets."
Then suddenly there's thrusting, thrusting, and he can't breathe. He tries to suck in air and almost chokes. His head pressed back against the headboard, John tries and fails to employ any semblance of technique. He opens his mouth wide and lets Sherlock take and take and oh god this is so fucking exactly what he needed. The feeling of Sherlock's cock full in his mouth, pushing down his throat with firm thrusts, pulling out just enough for John to gasp for breath before thrusting in deep. John can feel his own cock now hard and throbbing between his legs. He moves his left hand from Sherlock's clenched buttocks and slowly slides it down to his own leaking cock. He can barely keep up a rhythm with his hand as Sherlock thrusts into his mouth again and again. He feels like he's drowning. He feels like he's flying. He fucking loves it. He hears panting, moaning from above. Eyes closed against the onslaught, he can't see Sherlock's face, but he knows those sounds, and oh god he is close. He feels long fingers cupping the back of his skull impaling him faster and faster on the now throbbing cock in his mouth. He tries to focus, his own orgasm building, heat flushing through him. He slides his free hand along Sherlock's arse toward the cleft and finds the tight hole. He caresses gently with his middle finger, and slowly slides the tip inside. He feels Sherlock tense, tense, tense and warm come fills his mouth. All of a sudden he can breathe again, and he realizes he's moaning, panting for breath, fingers flying over his own leaking erection. Mouth full of come, John tenses, hips arching off the bed, and spills out his own climax.
"Oh yes. And I know just what to wear..."
"Of course -ah god- only logical." John is already flushed and panting as his hand moves slowly up and down.
John massages deeper, stroking into his lover's cleft. Sherlock presses back, a soft keening coming from his chest.
"Git"
"Oh course."
Bad John.
"You're angry. You don't want to look at me. What did I do? Is it what I said to Lestrade? If you didn't want to tell anyone...I didn't think you were embarrassed but.."
"Oh. Anytime?"
A low moan rumbles through the room.
"Well, I was hopeful, but I must say, I didn't deduce that strong of a reaction."
"Stop. You want to move in together, right?"
"No sir."
John hadn't indended to fall asleep.
John's brain starts spinning, rewriting the plan from "take out the rubbish" to "take me now".
"What?"
"I like the matching one on Sherlock as well."
"You must procure a VHS player. Immediately. And a second tape."
John pulls back, "Use me Sherlock. Please. Use me."
"Promise?"
"No, please, I need to you to...oh please. Please, please, fuck me."
"Fuck, Sherlock, that feels amazing." John presses in slowly, sinking deep into Sherlock's arse. He grabs Sherlock by the hips, and slowly pulls out, pauses, and thrusts back in.
"Sherlock, what's going on here?"
"God, Sherlock, I'm sorry. I can't keep my hands off you."
"I love you too John"
"Nor I," John says, licking Sherlock's thick cock through the delicate fabric. A deep baritone groan rumbles from above. "Oh yes, you gorgeous thing. You like this? Getting sucked off through your tiny panties?"
"Well you see, this top section is for nipple clamps and cock rings, as it has these dividers."
He slows, sliding his hands over Sherlock's back and hips, and gently withdraws, pulling Sherlock to the bed with him. They curl up, John wrapped around Sherlock's back, legs intertwining as their breathing slows.
"Fine. Being pedantic, our sex toy storage box is gone."
Sherlock, still flushed, looks over his shoulder with a cheeky grin, "I like being punished."
"Go into the bedroom. Undress, kneel by the bed, and wait."
They lay back, Sherlock setting the camera down next to them.
"Now."
"I really am."
He wants to blame it on the new relationship excitement, but looking back, he's never felt like this before. Not with women. Not with men.
"You really never throw anything out, do you? What is all this? Why do you have a tiny stuffed owl? And are these notes from basic maths?"
When they don't have assessments, sometimes John will help Sherlock with the experiments that he chooses to run on his own, just for fun.
Sherlock has never been inside John's house before. He's walked home with John a couple of times, because they do not live far from each other, but he has never had the opportunity to step inside. He wishes his eyes weren't so swollen so he could actually take it in properly. He does what he can under the circumstances, looking around as John leads him into the living room. John's house is smaller than Sherlock's. It's quaint, really. They pass the kitchen on the way to the living room, and Sherlock notices an empty bottle of some sort of alcohol sitting in the sink.
Unfortunately, his mother manages to get the next few words in before they can leave the room. "Of course," she says. "John is welcome to stay as long as he likes. In fact, John, would you like to stay for dinner?"
Somehow, without Sherlock really noticing what John is doing, John takes control of the situation. He moves the focus of conversation away from Sherlock, turning it to Sherlock's mother herself. He asks her about what she does for a living, and shows a genuine interest when she tells him that she's a mathematician. He asks about her work, her books, her publications. He does not sound like he is interrogating her, but instead is just making conversation, asking questions and showing genuine interest in the answers. It does not seem to bother Sherlock's mother. In fact, she seems flattered that someone has taken such a keen interest in her, and it keeps the conversation flowing.
"It hardly matters," Sherlock says. "I do not hold her opinion in high enough esteem to care what she thinks of me."
Immediately, thoughts spring to Sherlock's mind on how to respond, on how to deny it without making it seem like a lie. He's a good liar, he always has been. John will believe him, and they will move onto the next movie and they never have to have this conversation. Their friendship will not suffer; Sherlock will not ruin a perfectly good friendship with icky, messy feelings. However, though Sherlock opens his mouth, the words do not, or cannot, reach his lips. After a moment, he closes his mouth and hangs his head, eyes on his lap.
Sherlock tries not to feel smug.
"Yes," John says, "but also that you could have anyone you wanted."
What?
Technically, the deadline isn't until January next year.
John raises his eyebrows, but then he smiles. "Sure, if you're happy to have me."
? Not likely."
Were the capital letters really necessary?
Right. Well, why can't you just do university degrees that would help you get a regular detective job? Surely then you can branch out into "consulting detective". Whatever that is.
He tells her he's not going to formal before she properly gets the words out. It makes her deflate, and her eyes drop to the floor.
"Why?"
Course not. But if there is someone, I don't want you to shut yourself up because you're convinced you're not allowed to feel that way. If there is someone you want to ask to formal, then go for it.
Sherlock cannot bring himself to speak. He cannot bring himself to shift or even to look up at John's face, let alone meet his eyes. He wishes the sofa would swallow him whole. He wishes he could go back in time and not open the door, or to go back further and not say anything while they were texting, or to go back further still and stop himself from ever falling this far.
He turns to take his leave, but he gets no more than a few steps towards the path before the door opens behind him, and he hears John's voice.
"Observed what?"
Sherlock pretends not to notice. His focus is instead on trying to come up with an even better, even more convincing argument that will get him out of working on this project with someone else.
"You could come back to my house," Sherlock suggests suddenly, before he even realises he was going to make that suggestion.
As soon as these thoughts enter his mind, Sherlock realises he's not actually sure why John pitying him is such a problem. He does not need pity, but he has never cared what people think of him before, not really. With John, it feels different. He concludes that it's simply the fact that they have to continue to work together for another few months, and their ability to do so will be impaired if John starts pitying him.
It is, isn't it? :)
John glances at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye, and then he returns his gaze to Sally. "You know what, you're right," he says. "If I were him, I wouldn't put any effort into getting along with someone who treats me the way you do anyway."
"That doesn't make it okay!" John says, raising his voice slightly. It's clear that John is far more angered by Sally's behaviour than Sherlock himself is – despite the fact that the behaviour in question had been directed towards Sherlock and not John.
I'll take your word for it.
The night before their project is due, it's still not finished.
That said, with John, a lot of things don't go the way he would expect.
Sally crosses her arms over her chest and glares. "Well, even if I did," she says, "I don't see why I should waste my breath. It's not like he has any concept of manners."
"I don't run the country, Sherlock, don't be dramatic."
"Come along, John," Sherlock says immediately. He might not be able to avoid the awkward conversations that will take place over dinner, but at least he can separate John from his mother now and ensure that these conversations do not start any earlier tonight.
You can't invent jobs and expect to actually find a job in that area.
The words "freak" and "psychopath" and "stalker" echo inside Sherlock's head. John is staring at him, and Sherlock can only wait for the inevitable. John will call him some variation of the words that Sherlock can already hear in his mind, and he will get up and storm off. John might have been the only person in Sherlock's class who Sherlock could possibly work with, and Sherlock will undoubtedly have destroyed any potential of an effective partnership before they can even start the interesting work.
What's that supposed to mean?
John shakes his head. "You didn't. Trust me. Now, have you seen
He fails.
"No, but she was talking about you," John says. "And you're my friend."
Of course you're not. You're above feelings. How could you do something as lowly as fancy someone?
"I don't see him apologising," Sally says, turning around to face them.
Sherlock's mother does not take the hint. She shakes her head insistently. "No imposition at all," she says. "Please, we'd love to have you. We always have leftovers anyway. This one," – she jerks her head in Sherlock's direction - "doesn't eat enough."
Whatever you do at home can be left for one night.
"Earth to Sherlock, you in there?" he says.
Sherlock has always known that John likes girls. Anyone who pays even a little bit of attention to John would know this. John's gaze shifts whenever an aesthetically-pleasing girl walks past. He talks to girls in a different way to the way he talks to boys – it takes Sherlock a while, but he eventually realises that the difference is that when he talks to girls, he is flirting. John leans a little bit closer, smiles a little bit brighter, finds extra excuses to touch their arms or to take their hands in his. Sherlock would also guess that John's heart rate speeds up when he is around girls, too, but Sherlock has never been physically close enough to John while he's around a girl to confirm this.
Sherlock wonders, as John walks away, if John knew what Sherlock was going to say there too, even though Sherlock hardly knew himself.
You might do. You might not realise it now but I know that there are people at the school who you've spoken to a bit, and you might actually miss them a bit. And then you'll regret not going to formal to say goodbye.
, Sherlock thinks.
It's strange, spending so much time with someone else after Sherlock has grown up wanting to be alone and work alone. Even stranger is the fact that he likes it. He finds he even craves John's company; given the choice between spending his lunch hours alone or spending them with John, more often than not, he will choose John. There is something nice about the companionable silence in the library, when they sit across from each other in the lead-up to exams. It's nice, during the less-busy weeks, to sit in the cafeteria or, weather-permitting, in the sun and just talk.
The boy grins. "Great," he says, and then he extends his hand. "I'm John."
And the conversation is absolutely nothing like what Sherlock expects.
Objectively speaking, John is attractive. Sherlock knows that he is not the only one who sees this, because Sherlock sees the way that girls look at John too. John's facial features are arranged in a way that is widely accepted as handsome. John is fit, well-built, which is something that should be attractive in a potential mate from an evolutionary standpoint. John's eyes are a mixture of colours that change when the light hits them in certain ways. They seem to brighten when he is happy. John's smile seems to light up a room, and it's almost contagious. When John smiles at Sherlock, it feels like something shifts inside his chest.
It's your last major high school social event, a celebration of your graduation, and the last time you will see most of the people you've practically grown up with. It's pretty exciting.
He had barely understood it at the time. He had not realised the significance of what he was saying until the words were out of his mouth, and he saw the expression change on his mother's face.
"Hm?"
Silence stretches between them for a moment, until Mycroft is the one to break it. "I did warn you, Sherlock," he says. "You knew from the start that this was a risk."
They could use the school library instead, but even if they can get past the noise, they will only have an hour before closing time. It feels like the entire school is against them – of course the chemistry lab would be closed on the same day that the library closes early.
So they work together on projects in the chemistry class they share, and they even take to helping one another in their other classes too. They can bounce ideas off each other when planning independent projects, and they study together for exams. Sherlock helps John with memory techniques and quizzes him in the lead-up to exams to keep him on his toes. John helps Sherlock by proofreading his essays and pointing out all the areas where Sherlock had begun assuming too much knowledge in his audience and has skipped ahead and is not making sense.
After a moment, he tells her that he'd been under the impression that Greg Lestrade was going to ask her. It's not strictly speaking true, but it's not a lie that Greg has been stealing glances at Molly out of the corner of his eye for the better half of the year.
"No, Sherlock," Mycroft said, and Sherlock knew in that second that his older brother had already made the same deduction that Sherlock had verbalised. Sherlock was not the first to realise this, he was only the first to say it out loud. The tone that Mycroft used was one that Sherlock was unfortunately very familiar with. It was the one Mycroft used whenever Sherlock had been a particularly stupid little boy. Mycroft continued, "You're far too young to understand adult relationships. You should have kept your mouth shut."
What does stop that is John's graduation.
There are no university degrees that can form a pathway to my desired career.
"For the cleverest person I know, you can be remarkably oblivious at times," John says, which makes Sherlock drop his gaze a little in embarrassment.
They are rarely linear, but more often consist of fragments, bits and piece she that don't make a perfect story but that make sense while he is asleep. They're innocent, undoubtedly far more so than the dreams that many of his classmates would have had throughout their teenage years, but all the same, they make Sherlock feel warm.
John, however, is not used to hearing such words, even though the words in question are not directed towards him. It does not matter to John that Sherlock does not care what other people say. John cares what other people say about Sherlock, even though Sherlock does not really understand why.
So you do, you know, like boys?
John breaks up with his girlfriend a little after New Year's Day. Sherlock deduces that John would have done so sooner, because their uncomfortable Christmas together must have made it clear that they were not as compatible as partners should be, but John is a kind enough person to not let his now ex-girlfriend associate the time between Christmas and New Years with a breakup. The added bonus is that John and his girlfriend break up on fairly amicable turns – as it turns out, John's girlfriend had not enjoyed Christmas together either.
Then there's John, and John is another story entirely.
They submit their assignment the next morning, but their association does not end there.
But, that being said, Sherlock does not think that he would even fantasise of something like this without being entirely certain that it is something that will never come to light.
Just think about it, okay? Because I mean it. If you wanted to, you could have anyone you wanted.
"Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock," he said. "Remember that."
Sherlock wants to scoff, at first, because that's nonsense, until his mind catches up and he actually understands what that sentence means. From anyone else, it's nonsense. From the only person who Sherlock has ever felt this way for, it's something else entirely. His mind screeches to a halt, and finally, he draws his gaze away from his knees to look at John, staring at him with what he knows must be an awestruck expression on his face.
Of course not. Why does this surprise you?
"No, but I can do a better job cleaning you up than you would have done yourself. What happened?"
But John doesn't look at Sherlock in the same way that Sherlock looks at John.
Sherlock adds onto his note,
"Sherlock," John says, his voice soft and gentle but firm at the same time. "Sit. And just... hear me out, okay?"
Sherlock's parents did not get divorced, and they are still together. However, Sherlock knows that the way they talk to each other nowadays is different to the way that they did before. His mother's smile, when directed towards her husband, never seems quite so bright.
So Sherlock feels different around John. John is magnetic; Sherlock's eyes drift to him whenever they're together in a room. It's like there's a part of his brain, a part of his Mind Palace, that is permanently aware of John's presence, even when most of Sherlock's attention is on something else. When John stands too close, Sherlock is aware of the brush of his skin, or the tickle of John's breath against his ear when John leans close to be heard over the noise. Around John, everything seems heightened. Around John, Sherlock feels warm and his chest feels light.
The boy blinks. "Okay," he says. "Good to know. Is this relevant to the project?"
Sherlock turns to the source of the voice: a blond boy whose name Sherlock does not know. Sherlock recognises him as one of the boys who sit in the front of the class, but Sherlock has never interacted with him before. Sherlock has had no need to collect unimportant data on this boy, including his name.
Dull.
Anyway. I really need to finish this essay that you've been distracting me from. Talk soon!
"I wasn't."
The kiss breaks when John's lips pull upwards into a smile against Sherlock's own, and then John lets out an almost giddy-sounding giggle that brings a smile to Sherlock's own lips. It's quite possibly the best sound that he has ever heard in his life.
– a look that Sherlock cannot quite name, but it makes Sherlock feel warm and makes Sherlock want to keep making deductions, just so that John will keep looking at him that way.
After another cup of coffee, another discussion of whether John's current level of consciousness can be classified as 'awake', and a brief debate about the correct way to use in-text citations, they manage to finish the project. It's about three o'clock in the morning.
WHAT?
The words earn a bright smile from John, warm and genuine and showing absolutely no indication that he has taken offence. "I suppose people are usually a bit weirded out by you reading their minds, then?"
"I already have ideas for this project," Sherlock says. "None of them are simple."
"We're almost done," Sherlock points out, "and even if I wasn't working on this, I would probably stay up anyway. Sleeping is tedious. There's always something more interesting to do."
, he writes one day when he catches Sherlock fiddling with his phone underneath his desk. Sherlock thinks for a moment that John is genuinely frustrated with Sherlock's behaviour, until he catches the ghost of a smile that is playing on John's lips.
Again, Sherlock says, "I don't need you to partner with me out of pity."
It's a relief when formal finally does come around, but not because Sherlock is going. Sherlock is not going. The thought of going never once crossed his mind. However, when formal finally comes, it means there are only hours before it finishes, and then Sherlock does not have to hear about it anymore. That, and the end of formal also means that it's almost time for graduation, and then Sherlock can get out of here and never come back, never see some of the people he's gone to school with for years.
John purses his lips. "What deduction did you make?"
It's almost a pity, really. You could have any girl you wanted.
"Most people aren't like you and I, Sherlock. They cannot see things objectively. They let themselves believe that their love will last. It just leaves them more hurt when they find that they were wrong."
Is this conversation over?
Yeah, you would. "I'm Sherlock Holmes and I'm far too cool for formals with lowly peasants."
From a distance, John's eyes look dark, almost brown. Up close, they're not. They're blue. They're not just blue, however – there are flecks of green, and a ring of hazel around the pupil that is only visible when the light hits it just right. John's eyes almost seem to change colour as they move around Sherlock's face. There is something captivating about that.
Sherlock could do nothing but believe his brother on this matter, because Mycroft was seven years his senior and cleverer than Sherlock. He was always right. After a moment, Sherlock asked, "Does this mean they will get a divorce?"
Because it's FORMAL.
He catches John furrow his brow. John's entire face moves when he is confused. Lines appear on his forehead and sometimes he even wrinkles his nose.
Go pay attention in class like you're supposed to.
Have you started applying for uni yet?
No, it's subtext. Trust me, I know you.
Oh come on. It's totally possible. What about Molly from biology? She'd probably jump for joy if you asked her to go with you. Once she stopped blushing.
It's just. I know you. I know you have a tendency to keep to yourself, especially since I graduated, and I don't want you to be, you know, lonely.
"Obviously," Sherlock replies, and he gestures towards the exit. "Come on, then."
"Oh God," mutters someone behind Sherlock. "Don't let me be assigned with the freak."
"Of course not." A beat, and then Sherlock continues, "You sit at the front of the class, and take notes even when this is not a requirement. This shows that you are a dedicated student and that you are determined to achieve good results, at least in this class, if not in all of your classes. You're motivated and ambitious, which is likely related to your desire to become a doctor. Based on the classes you're taking, I presume your intentions are to study medicine. You know that a medicine degree will be costly, both in terms of time and money, and you're not well-off financially. So, your best chance of succeeding involves you getting a scholarship. This is why you are so motivated to get good grades, especially on a project that is worth the majority of your final grade in this class. So, you see, I was never concerned that you would be a bad partner. You are undoubtedly one of the few in the class who would be willing to put in as much time and effort as a project of this complexity would require."
Not likely.
The negative repercussion is that you're going to miss formal. You'll be missing out!
Yes, mother.
John looks different this time to the way he normally looks when they watch movies. He does not seem as engrossed in it as he usually does. He looks distracted, and almost tense.
"I observed."
"God, you're out of it, aren't you?" John says, returning to his task of cleaning Sherlock's face now that he has Sherlock's attention. "I hope these guys didn't give you a concussion."
It is a long night.
"It's not pity. I just feel like you'd work better with someone who doesn't act like some of the people in our class do, and
And another knock.
I expect as much.
to work with someone, then obviously it's preferable to work with someone who is not the boy who called Sherlock a freak, or that boy's friends. Maybe the blond boy sitting in front of him is the best option available.
? It'll mess with your head. I think you'll like it."
I'm not lonely.
"That it's fine?" Sherlock says wryly. He cannot feel reassured by the words. Of course John would insist that it is fine. John is a good person, and John isn't going to judge Sherlock for liking boys. However, that doesn't mean that the fact that Sherlock likes John, specifically, won't mean that John starts to treat Sherlock differently. John says it's fine, but it's not, and Sherlock might lose the only friendship in his life that has ever been worth anything to him.
Consulting detective. I invented the job.
"There you are," John says. "Knew you'd get there eventually."
When a couple of seconds pass in silence, John just smiles and says, "Goodnight, Sherlock."
"Convenience, usually. Divorces are messy, expensive, and complicated. Sometimes, couples will just decide that they can stand one another enough to stay together, if it means they can avoid all the legal complications such as custody battles and..." He trailed off, and then looked down at Sherlock over his nose. "Well, I don't expect you to understand any of that."
"That's because he
He only ends up texting back when John starts a conversation with something completely unrelated to their last conversation – John texts about a part of his chemistry homework that he is struggling with. Sherlock is not stupid – Sherlock knows that John intentionally chose that topic of conversation because it's something that Sherlock is comfortable discussing, unrelated to the one thing Sherlock will not discuss, and thus the most likely topic that would lead Sherlock to text back. It works, only because Sherlock does not like not talking to John, either.
Mycroft takes a seat on the edge of Sherlock's bed, and Sherlock immediately angles his body away from him.
"Well," John says, "I'm glad that I'm capable of surprising even the great Sherlock Holmes."
I have to do no such thing. It's not mandated, it has no bearing on my graduation, and there are no negative repercussions for not going.
"It's a shame that John couldn't make it, isn't it?" she says. She doesn't take the hint from Sherlock's silence that this is not something Sherlock wants to discuss. "I suppose he wanted to spend Christmas with his family, didn't he?"
Then John says, "Wow. That... that was amazing" and Sherlock's mind screeches to a halt.
"I don't recall inviting you in," Sherlock says.
"It's about time," John says. There's a smile on his face. He has a bag slung over his shoulder, and a pile of DVDs under his arm. "I was beginning to think you'd lied to me and you'd actually decided to go to formal."
Sherlock does not want to work with anyone else, but he also does not want to work with this boy. He does not want to work with
Sherlock hates the look that Mycroft gives him, because he has the strangest idea that Mycroft might know how Sherlock is feeling better than Sherlock himself.
Just go to formal, Sherlock. I had a really good time at mine and I don't want you to miss out on that. - JW
Mycroft complains vocally, and Sherlock, while not so vocal, certainly doesn't make it seem like he's thrilled. However, his mother has her mind set on having this party and when Sherlock's mother has her mind set on something, there's no stopping her.
Formal doesn't come up in conversation again.
Dull.
His professor looks up at him over the tops of his glasses. "There's an even number of students in the class, including you," he says. "You should have no problems finding someone to work with."
I fail to see the point to this conversation.
So, instead, Sherlock says, "Fine. I'll meet you in the library."
Sherlock shifts on the sofa so that he does not take up as much space, so his knee isn't pressing into John's.
"What?" Sherlock says.
John shrugs. "I was going to come back this weekend anyway, so I figured I might as well make it a day earlier. Besides, no one should be alone on formal night. Even geniuses who think they're too good for formals." He peers past Sherlock's shoulder, and then asks, "Can I come in, or are you busy?"
215 days to go.
I'm not interested.
"Did you?"
"Okay," John says, and then he takes a breath, before finally saying, "You fancy me."
At last, Sherlock asked, "Isn't it better that she knows?" His voice was quiet, hoarse. His tone reflected the unspoken question beneath his words:
Sherlock is pleased, because proving that he is intelligent and achieving results on something that he did dedicate a lot of time and effort to is satisfying. Mostly, however, Sherlock is satisfied because of the bright, shocked-yet-ecstatic look that comes over John's face when their professor hands their paper back.
Sherlock doesn't realise that John has been trying to talk to him until John pulls the washcloth away and frowns.
John goes back to university, and Sherlock goes back to school. He graduates this year. He's almost done, almost free.
Sherlock lowers the book to glare at his brother, and then immediately raises it again. "I have a major project due and my professor insists that I work on it with someone else," he states. "So, naturally, I have been spending a lot of time with my partner in the interest of getting the project done and ensuring it is of a high quality. I'm not sure why mother believes that this is an important enough topic to discuss with you. I'm sure you have far more important things to do, like run the country."
Pretending to not be home is clearly not working – the person behind the door must know that Sherlock is in here. Maybe they caught sight of one of the lights turning on through the window. Letting out a loud sigh, Sherlock gets to his feet and storms over to the door, prepared to tell whatever salesperson is behind it to piss off in no polite terms.
Mycroft doesn't.
It's not like they stop being friends, of course. It's hardly as though people abandon all their friends when they start dating. However, the fact that John is now dating does mean that they do not spend as much time with one another as they used to. Sometimes, Sherlock will suggest an activity, and John will decline, because he already has plans with his girlfriend at the time.
Sherlock's mother answers all the questions openly, and she does not re-take control of the conversation for the entire duration of dinner. It's only when they are loading their plates into the dishwasher that Sherlock realises that none of his fears had come true.
And maybe Sherlock was wrong in thinking that John had read the thoughts from Sherlock's face, because John then says, "Well, all right, if it's not too much trouble..."
"Sherlock?"
someone to be pitied; he's never had friends before because other people are idiots and
Sherlock sends the project to the printer, and then he creeps downstairs – carefully sneaking past his mother's room – to collect it. He staples it, flicks through to make sure that all of their graphs and diagrams have not moved positions without them noticing it, and then he returns to his room.
Instead, John says, "Well, I'm not surprised his girlfriend doesn't love him anymore if he's the sort of person who hits people."
Mycroft found him a couple of hours later, knees to his chest and arms wrapped around his legs. Mycroft did not turn on the light when he entered, but simply shut the door behind him and took a seat at the end of Sherlock's bed. He did not speak, instead waiting for Sherlock to break the silence when he was ready.
Sherlock turns to look over his shoulder, and John's expression shifts when he sees Sherlock's face, portraying a number of different emotions. Shock, horror, sadness. Sherlock wipes some of the blood from beneath his nose away with the back of his hand.
The words, Sherlock can ignore. Sherlock does not care if people call him a freak, or a psychopath, or a weirdo. What is much harder to ignore is when Sherlock's peers decided to demonstrate their opinions of Sherlock in a much more physical manner. Usually, Sherlock is fast enough to keep himself out of reach, at least until he can either get home or get to class. This time, he hasn't been quite so lucky.
And it's clear that the person on the other side of the door isn't going anywhere.
It could, if there was something more important. Formal is not more important.
A part of Sherlock feels like this might be a dream. A part of him feels like he's definitely not hearing anything correctly. Maybe this is all in his Mind Palace. Maybe this is all a fantasy of what he would want to happen.
Sherlock looks over at John, who has curled himself tighter underneath the blanket, and he thinks that it might be too late.
Asking someone what?
"But—"
"I didn't think you would be a bad partner, exactly," Sherlock says.
I will not be missing out on anything that is worth missing.
I am if it will put an end to this.
Sherlock opens his mouth, preparing himself to speak even though he doesn't have the faintest idea of what he is going to say. John is the only person who has ever managed to do this to him – actually render him speechless. Sherlock always, always gets the last word, except when John is around, and when John does something like this.
That does not mean you can afford to wait until next year. Especially if you're going for one of the more prestigious universities.
done. They finished the actual, practical experiment weeks ago, and they have almost finished writing the paper itself. It's just a case of finalising their discussion and writing the conclusion (and, every student's dread – proofreading). Technically speaking, they could do it quickly, in the last few minutes that they have before the library closes for the evening. However, both of them are determined to do well – John motivated by his ambitions to get a scholarship, Sherlock motivated by his interest in the project and his desire to be the best at anything he finds highly interesting. Finishing their assignment in a rush job is not likely to lead them to the grades they want.
They don't text for a couple of weeks.
"You're not a doctor yet, John," Sherlock says.
And yet, to John, they are something marvellous, something that causes John to give Sherlock that
On the off chance that his parents have come home early, or his brother has decided to come home for the night, they wouldn't be ringing the doorbell. They all have keys and could let themselves in. Sherlock is most definitely not expecting visitors, because the only person who ever visits Sherlock is currently two hours away, and his family would not have invited anyone over while they are not here. So, when the doorbell rings, Sherlock concludes that it must be a charity person or a door-to-door salesperson, and he chooses to pretend he's not home.
For the first time in his life, Sherlock's mind goes completely and utterly blank. It's as though every door and every window around his Mind Palace has been thrown open, letting in beautiful, bright, blinding light that drowns out everything else. The kiss is gentle, and yet it leaves Sherlock's head spinning.
"Don't do that," he says sternly. "Wait here, I'll go get my first-aid kit. Try not to make it any worse."
Obviously, I do not want you to choose a uni based solely on the fact that I'm there, and I wouldn't expect you to anyway, but if you did happen to get into Cambridge, I'd be very happy.
"Go away."
"Yes, I can see that. I was more interested in who did this."
Don't play stupid, it doesn't suit you. Asking someone to formal!
Why are you so desperate for me to go? You're at uni and your life is in no way impacted by whether I choose to spend my Thursday night around a bunch of idiots in nice clothing or at home by myself.
"Well, that might be because you were the one who ran into him."
"We could try a café?" John suggests, but Sherlock is immediately dissatisfied with the idea for the same reason that he would be dissatisfied with the library. If anything, a cafe will only be louder than the library. And there will be people everywhere.
You know what I just thought of?
"Hm?"
In response, John leans over, writing in the corner of Sherlock's page instead of on his own.
"They didn't," Sherlock says. "I was merely thinking."
It doesn't turn out that way.
I only blew things up once.
"None at all," Sherlock's mother says. "You two go upstairs and work on your project, and I'll let you know when dinner is ready."
It's not just the nodding-off-then-starting-awake kind of sleep that John had been drifting towards earlier. He has lain himself down on the edge of Sherlock's bed, curled up with his head pillowed on his arm. He does not so much as stir even when Sherlock pushes the door shut behind him.
Come on, Sherlock. You won't know what you're missing unless you go. Maybe it would be nice for you to have some fond memories to look back on.
The statement sheds no light on the situation, and Sherlock furrows his brows, simultaneously intrigued and inexplicably nervous. "All right?" he says, making it sound more like a question than a statement.
They pull away, but not far. They're close enough for Sherlock to feel John's breath against his skin. It's almost too close for Sherlock to be able to see John clearly, but he can see the bright smile on John's face and the bright look in his eyes. John's palm is on Sherlock's cheek, cupping his jaw (Sherlock has no recollection of when it got there) and he gently strokes his thumb over Sherlock's cheekbone.
Once John meets his eyes, Sherlock realises he isn't actually sure what he wants to say.
Sherlock knows. He's had plenty of experience with that particular classmate's behaviour, and the behaviour of his friends – often directed towards Sherlock himself. Regardless, Sherlock says, "I see little point in paying attention to what other people say about me."
"I better get home," John says once all the plates have been put away. "Thank you so much for dinner, Mrs Holmes. It was really nice."
"See?" John says as they pack up their things after their final planning session. "I'm not as bad a partner as you expected, am I?"
They curl up on the sofa, and John puts the movie on. The sofa is easily large enough for the two of them to sit side-by-side without touching, but Sherlock knows how to position himself so that he takes up a little bit more space than necessary without making it obvious that he is doing so. His knee brushes against John's, and he savours the warmth he can feel at that small point of contact between them.
"I'm going to make a deduction, and if I'm wrong, we're going to put on another movie and we'll never talk about this again. But if I'm not wrong, then you need to promise me you'll be honest."
"Okay," John says. "So what happened? How'd you end up getting into a fight?"
So, Sherlock cannot see what John sees when John looks at girls. He doesn't understand how it must feel for John, what John experiences when he decides that he want to date one of the girls in their class. Sherlock has tried looking at boys, instead, but that's little different. There's a part of Sherlock that might feel a little more drawn to boys than he is to girls, that much is true, but Sherlock can hardly be drawn to the boys at school when their behaviour towards him is so unpleasant to experience.
"You know what." John groaned, rubbing his hands over his eyes, "That was a paying client, and you were ready to turn them down."
“Alright, I am in love with you, Sherlock Holmes, so utterly in love, it drives me mad sometimes.” Sherlock moved in, his lips brushing against Johns.
. Sherlock pleaded with John, but John simply smiled and shook his head.
“Shouldn’t your priority be protecting that new baby of yours?” Moriarty asked, turning his gaze to Olivia in the corner of the room, “Oh! Is that her nanny?” He asked suddenly, he then began to walk lightly to them and Mary stood, creating a barrier herself, this time, before John could move.
"Concentrate." Sherlock replied coldly, observing the orange flames beneath his microscope.
"Mmm, yes." Sherlock replied, moving on, "Now I'm thinking that in six months time, John and I could quite possibly be-"
"She's a dominatrix." Mycroft replied, "Don't be alarmed, it's to do with sex." The elder Holmes said smugly. John looked over at the two brothers and felt the annoyance and slight embarrassment that Sherlock felt.
"This is not good, Sherlock." John said, leaning against the building they stopped by.
"What?" He asked, furrowing his brow, John could hear him trying to work it out.
"I will never get used to that." Molly laughed, shaking her head, "How long were we frozen?" She asked.
His eyes traveled back up to Sherlock's,
John sighed, standing and putting on his jacket.
"What's going on?" Molly asked quietly, leaning into Mrs. Hudson, who was watching the boys with wide eyes.
Sherlock said to him, and John smiled across at the Chief who was now walking through their flat, commenting on how Sherlock seemed like a weirdo. Good a reason as any to punch someone.
“She could have.” John cut him off, his eyes staring daggers into the detectives, “Okay, she knew...” He stopped, calming himself again, “She knew exactly what it was like for me after I watched you...” He cut himself off, but Sherlock knew how that sentence ended, “And she put me back together, so she knew. And then she shot you. She knew I’d find you. She couldn’t have possibly been thinking about me in that instance, because finding you near death...” He shook his head, going back to his researching. Sherlock smiled sadly across at his friend before looking back to his own computer.
“Did I?” John asked, stepping even closer to Sherlock, they were mere inches from each other at this point, “You weren’t here, Sherlock. I grew a mustache for christ’s sake. I visited your grave on a weekly basis, I talked to your grave whenever I was there alone. I had dreams nearly every night, some were good, some were memories, some were very bad. Hell, I still have dreams about you. Sometimes I wake up worried that you really did die and this has all been a dream.” He laughed to himself, “This is where I belong, Sherlock, not in Montana. Not anywhere but here, with you, in Baker Street.”
“Yeah.” Mary said, an accent returning a bit, “We’ve already grown accustomed to having you around, besides, who else will babysit for us? Sherlock?” She began laughing and John turned quickly.
John asked, Sherlock huffed, annoyed. John glared at him.
“Yeah.” He shrugged, “Nostalgia.”
“What about you? Sharing a room with your child wouldn’t be unheard of, but it would certainly be unfavorable as she gets older.”
“Holy shit!” She shouted, nearly falling off the couch, “The hell! You’re back!” She exclaimed, hopping up and hugging the detective. He stopped dead, his arms stiffly at his sides as she had them pinned down, “I thought you were being exiled?”
Sherlock said to John, unsure whether or not he was free to speak aloud.
"I'm sorry, I saw no other choice."
"Sounds lovely." John smiled, crossing his legs and awaiting the beautiful music his mate was about to make.
"Why'd you do it?" He chanced asking. Sherlock sighed deeply.
"He's... Well this is completely hush hush, but as you're one of our most prestigious clients, I realize you know a thing or two about keeping secrets... My brother has recently found himself bonded, and needs time to accept and nourish that connection." Mycroft explained and the man on the other end sighed.
"Yes, we do." Sherlock replied, "I'm assuming our abilities are going to manifest whenever one of us is in danger."
"Not at all." John returned the glare with a tight lipped smile. They sat in silence for a moment, merely observing one another. The bell rang, but neither man moved to answer it.
"That was, disturbing, to say the least." Sherlock said, breathing deeply, obviously quite perturbed.
"Tell em the truth." John shrugged, "We're mates, we froze time, left you unfrozen. And we ran away." Greg sighed and walked to them, handing over his gun.
"No, that makes you the most
"What... Are you doing?" John asked, "Sit down."
"Sit, sit!" The Teller said, "You'll find that the closer you are at the beginning of your bond, the better you'll feel. the nausea you're feeling, John? It
“Everything, my mortal enemy has returned, Mary’s going into early labor, John hasn’t brought me my tea!” He shouted at the end, looking up from beneath his hand at John who was stopped dead in his tracks, a cup of tea in his hand.
"That was them, late 1800's London. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes." George revealed and it snapped Sherlock from his thoughts, he glanced up from his hands.
"Oh god no!" Lestrade laughed, "I mean, I was still married. Albeit she was a cheating whore, but hey... I loved her."
"You're bloody hopeless, aren't ya? Head over heels." Greg laughed and John scoffed, rolling his eyes.
“Contractions have started.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, standing and grabbing the cup from John, “Thank you.” He said, sipping the drink as he made his way back to his chair.
Sherlock tried his hardest, against his wishes, to hear her thoughts. John asked him to, and after an angry text message from the detective where he stated that he
“Mary’s what?” He asked, looking to his wife who was now rubbing at her face with one hand, the other gripping her stomach.
"Course not. I'm not gay." He said, his usual defense.
“John.” Sherlock said, and the doctor in question looked up, his eyes wild as he ran from the house, flagging down the next cab, Sherlock hot on his heels, climbing in after him.
"Charles, I suggest you lower your firearm, now." Sherlock said,
“You expect to live in Baker Street for the rest of our lives?”
"Oh thank you so much, Dr. Watson!" He stood and shook his hand, Sherlock didn't move, so John walked the client to the door and closed it behind him, looking at Sherlock with a fixed and slightly angry stare.
"Sherlock Holmes and John Watson!" He exclaimed, clapping his hands together, smiling brilliantly, "I've been waiting for you!" He stepped aside and ushered them in. John's eyes fell to the man's feet, which were covered by fuzzy blue slippers. Sherlock took notice of, well, everything. From his Einstein-esque brown hair to his ratted robe to the flannel PJ's he wore beneath it before finally landing on the fingerless gloves he had on his hands.
"Let's go." Sherlock stood, tugging on his jacket, he wasn't even sure why he took it off.
"You know the detective inspector?" John asked, slightly confused. The man raised his eyebrows.
"For a good... Oh I don't know, six months?" John estimated.
"Am I? Boy you're just like him, aren't ya?" She sighed, "Ok, so what am I missing?"
When Mycroft sent Lestrade up to check on the two of them, John decided to have a talk with the DI, to ask him about his bond with Mycroft. The two men sat at a table after they'd chased Frankland into the mine field. Sherlock had already gone to bed, opting to pass out since he hadn't slept a wink since the case started.
“Goodbye, John Watson.” Sherlock said, stopping and John looked back, smiling sadly.
"He has to know. He knows everything." Sherlock said quietly, causing John to raise his eyebrows in surprise.
man in all of England." John shook his head, still laughing slightly.
“Sherlock!” She called, walking into the room with a tray full of tea and biscuits, “Oh I thought I heard you too, John. Oh and who’s this?” She smiled excitedly, setting down the tray.
"So!" Sherlock put John back into a normal standing position, "We can go now, they won't know for at least ten miles."
“Yeah.” John replied, walking through the door.
"Let's go." He said as he held John at an angle, John picked his head up, looking at Sherlock.
“Anything else?” John asked, grabbing the envelope. He opened it and pulled out a few pieces of straw, “No.” He breathed, nearly dropping it.
"What?"
John sighed, turning the street corner.
"I know, I heard." Sherlock scoffed and Kitty furrowed her brow.
"When you..." John hesitated to find the right word.
"Undoubtedly, it would seem she has an affinity for her assistant and I'm sending in the American's." The elder Holmes stood, shaking the other man's hand and with a raise of his eyebrows, left.
“Good way to keep my mind off of Magnussen.” Sherlock replied simply.
"No, we do. We need to talk about this. What if he tries to take you down? Hmm? He said it, he said the words, a fall is going to start soon... What do you think that means?" John continued to stare, his mouth agape as he waited for the detective's reply, "I'll tell you what it means, Sherlock... He's going to try to discredit your abilities as a detective, and will probably lead to your suicide... Wait." John was surprised at the words that came out of his mouth. Sherlock turned to him fully.
"He said it burned where they touched and he was dizzy. But believe me, they're not bonded. I mean either one is hardly super human." Sherlock laughed at the thought as they reached the flat and pushed inside, heading up the stairs, tossing their coats aside and settling into their respective chairs. It was odd that they already had their own chairs. Sure, Sherlock wasn't going to give up his comfortable leather one. It was the perfect chair for thinking. As John sat in the red chair, however, Sherlock couldn't help but think that it matched him perfectly. There was no other chair that could house John Watson. Certainly not his own perfect leather thinking chair. It was
“Leave.” Sherlock demanded and Moriarty frowned.
“Yes, good.” John replied, taking Mary’s hand into his, “Come on, Mary.” He began to walk with her to the stairs before turning back, “Sherlock!” He shouted.
There he’d raise a family, grow old with Mary, and probably die warm in his bed at the ripe old age of 90. And suddenly with every step he took, the less sure he became that that was the life he wanted. His breathing quickened and his heart began to race and he found himself looking back, telling himself that if Sherlock was still there, then he would turn around, tell him he didn’t want that life. That he wanted to grow old with him, solving crimes and god knows what else. When he looked back, Sherlock was no where to be seen.
"I said put your hand where I can see them!" He shouted again, cocking back the hammer on his gun.
“For us.” John corrected her, “He says your safe now.” She glanced up from behind her hands, tears forming behind her eyes.
"Did you just freeze me?" Sherlock asked, smiling as he looked down at his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We..." Sherlock began, "Should go home." He said, clearing his throat. John nodded, smiling slightly and the two left the pool, and the jacket bomb, behind.
“Ah, John, so lovely for you to have come to visit the moment of my brother’s return to Baker Street.” Mycroft Holmes stepped out of the black car, his tone smug as usual as he stared down the army doctor.
"Well, do you remember the fourth generation Teller's tale of the mates who developed special abilities?" George asked, smiling slightly.
"How do you mean?" John asked.
John asked, stopping in the middle of the sidewalk, Sherlock stopped and turned toward him, his hands shoved into his pockets.
"Sherlock,
Sherlock answered,
"Jesus!" She turned from him and stormed down the stairs.
“Thank you.” Mary smiled.
“Oh, Hudders,” Sherlock said fondly, John ran his thumb along the sharp cheekbone beneath it and it brought Sherlock back into the moment as John moved closer to his friend, first resting their foreheads against one another’s in a moment of thought, though neither really needed to think anything through. It was more a moment of reflection, a moment of wonder, John leaned back for a moment, his eyes wide and no doubt glossed with tears, they were of course joyous, still Sherlock wiped them away, both of his hands encased John’s face and he pulled him closer.
"Sorry, just George."
"Stop thinking," John said, scrubbing his hands over his face, "it's giving me a headache."
Sherlock was busy posting deductions on his website about the random people in the waiting room of the hospital when Lestrade, Molly and Mrs. Hudson all appeared at once. He looked up from his phone and immediately rolled his eyes, not wanting the hugs he was sure he was about to get.
“So that was him...” She stated shortly, looking at the three catatonic people in the room, “Hello!” She shouted and John snapped out of it, closing his eyes and laughing.
“You love me.” It wasn’t a question, but an echo of the statement Sherlock just made, the declaration that was hidden by a tone of disbelief.
"What are you going to write?" Sherlock asked.
"You know me so well." Sherlock said, unwrapping himself and picking up the beverage, blowing on it momentarily before taking a sip, "Down to how I like my tea. I think you spoil me, John. I'll never be able to drink tea made by anyone else."
"Woah." She replied.
"Therapists." He scoffed to himself and sighed. He supposed he could write about his immense amounts of research on soul mates. His time training to be a doctor meant sitting through a lot of classes on the matter. Slowly, he began to type.
"So do you have any special abilities then?" Molly pried, completely interested in them
"Tedious." Sherlock murmured quiet enough that only John could hear, which he could only do so because they had amplified hearing abilities. John turned back to Sherlock and began fixing his shirt, "What are you doing?"
“It’s fine.” John held up his hand, as if he believed Olivia should hear the story, “She’s fine. But Mary... Magnussen doesn’t keep hard copies... He files his information away the same way Sherlock does.” Mary gasped, her hand flying to her mouth, that was a real reaction, “So Sherlock...” He stopped, sniffing hard and Mary let out a breath.
He heard and John knew that was it, Sherlock would do it.
“God, she’s only just now pushing!” Sherlock sprang up, “How long is this going to take, having babies is so tedious!” He began walking the way John had just come from.
"Thank you." He said and Lestrade rolled his eyes, as if his loyalty to the two of them should have been obvious.
"I'll walk your dog for you, hey I've said it now. I'll even walk your dog." He put on his best smile and Jeanette was unamused, rolling her eyes.
“Rebecca Arrington.” He said the name quietly, looking at her profile, “But what does A.G. Stand for?” He went through the papers again, nothing in them mentioned anything about who she was before she was Rebecca. She’d been Rebecca for ten years, working as a freelance assassin after going rogue from the CIA. He sighed heavily as he read the information, there was a list of the people she’d worked with. Sherlock had some of them highlighted.
"You are a complete git," John said, shaking his head. He prepared tea for the both of them, heading to the couch and sitting next to Sherlock. He immediately set Sherlock's cup on the table, deciding the detective looked too wrapped up and cozy to be bothered to hold a cup of tea.
"What were you saying, Sherlock?" John asked, Molly looked to the blonde doctor and opened her mouth in slight confusion before looking up expectantly at Sherlock.
"Yes, but how did you get away with only me noticing?" Greg was clearly in.
John replied. They sat in silence for a while, breathing in tandem. John hadn't relinquished his grip on Sherlock's shoulder yet, and Sherlock didn't want him to. The closeness was calming and he'd never felt more relaxed, well at least not without the help of narcotics.
“She was nice.” Olivia smiled awkwardly.
"The last time I ever arrested Sherlock for using... Instead of taking him in, I took him straight to Mycroft. I then gave the man an earful about looking after his brother, told him he should worry about him more than the country. Told him if I were him, that's what I would do. Hell, that's what I did. I sacrificed my job for the bloke constantly, still do." He took a drink, and glanced around for a few seconds before continuing, "When I was about to leave, he extended his hand. The first time he ever wanted to shake my hand for looking after his brother the way I did. And his thank you was so sincere. When our hands connected, they burned. It went straight up my arm and into my chest. And that was that, we were bonded."
"Feel what?" Sherlock asked and John turned to look at him, his eyebrows raised slightly.
"Sherlock and John have been bonded for quite some time." Mycroft said suddenly.
John said, stepping onto Baker Street, suddenly everything there stopped moving too.
“John.” Sherlock shouted from the sitting room.
“Yes.” John laughed, “No not in a bad way, though. Thank you.” He said, looking at her again, laughing harder at the way she hugged the boxes to her, her face wide eyed and confused. Once he calmed down he sniffed, wiping at his eyes before looking at her again, “I’m okay, thank you though, really.”
"Yes." Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes, going back into John's memory, "You've had quite a few girlfriends." He laughed, "Oi, that one..."
"What the hell," He muttered, lowering his head, "We've got time." He said against John's lips before closing the small gap. A bolt of electricity shot through them as their lips connected, but it wasn't a bad thing, in fact it was very good. It made John jump slightly and Sherlock had a small sound emit from his throat, and as they broke, they began laughing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Olivia...” She sighed, tucking a loose strand of hair behind the girls ear, “I was young, and I got offered the job of a life time. But it was dangerous. Under cover work... I couldn’t bring you along, and I had no family to give you to.” She rubbed her hand reassuringly along the girl’s arm, “If I could go back now... I’d do it all differently.”
Sherlock laughed out loud.
"You saw it. You know." Sherlock sighed, reminding John that he'd received all of his memories, "Besides, I recall see you using a little recreational marijuana."
I'm gonna have a case chapter after the sexy chapter. Just because it wouldn't be a honeymoon (sex holiday) without a proper case where they get to use ALL of their abilities. Which I will need to list... Probably in that case chapter. I'll have Sherlock make a list. Now that it's decided... BYEE, I'll write the sexy stuff tomorrow (Thanksgiving) cause nothing screams family holiday like smut!
Sherlock didn't look at him again, but he saw him smile, that was good enough.
“You just want to experiment on it.” John shook his head, smiling across at his former flat mate.
“I am.” He said and Sherlock shook his head.
. John's please tone rang through Sherlock's mind, a gasp escaped as he began to bite down his detective's neck. He started pushing him back until Sherlock almost collapsed into a seat. He caught himself just before falling and grabbed ahold of John's shoulders to steady himself.
“You’ve brought someone, not Mary.” The detective said, leaning back from his place at the kitchen table where he was experimenting on a finger.
"Yeah." John said again, softer this time as he looked up at Sherlock, their faces dangerously close to one another's. He could hear Sherlock's hear rate increase, and was sure the detective could hear his as well as there were no other sounds around them to take away from the super hearing. John's tongue darted out, quickly wetting his lips and Sherlock knew instantly what was crossing his mind, and he wouldn't have had to be a mind reader to know.
"I saw everything," John said, bringing his hands to his head, rubbing at his temples, "Your entire life."
John threatened, raising his brows at the detective.
John asked, walking closer to observe the man.
“Will you tell me?” Sherlock asked, a few minutes into their cab ride.
"It's hours after I leave. You think it'd still be warm?" John laughed.
“No.” Mary replied, and John had a feeling in his gut that she did, “Why?”
"Greg." John growled, looking up at the DI, "You know he won't come with you."
“Yeah, well it’s not what I want to be doing.” John responded with a shrug.
“You can stay here.” Mrs. Hudson decided, looking to Sherlock and John, “She can have John’s old room.”
"I know
"I apologize for the inconvenience, but with all do respect, we're in no place to be consulting at the moment," John said, standing, "Sherlock," He said, looking down at the still seated detective, who looked up at him, slightly confused. John rolled his eyes to the doorway and tilted his head.
"Gentlemen, if you'd like to exchange the vows you've prepared." John breathed deeply, taking a moment to gather himself as he looked at Sherlock.
Sorry these are so short. It's kind of just a "what happens after?" kind of thing.
"No one will believe it." John said, suddenly snapping out of it, looking around he was in his own cab.
“Nope.” John growled, “Not this time. You’re not getting near him.”
John said to Sherlock as they sat in the cab on the way home from Buckingham palace. The detective sighed and looked over at John.
"Thank you." John growled and then rested his hands on the counter, staring down at the sink. He breathed deeply and closed his eyes, concentrating hard on starting time again. Sherlock watched as he stood at the sink, observing the way his hands gripped the countertop. He raised his brows as he heard crackling begin next to him and looked down to find the fire had sparked back to life, so to speak. Then there were the sounds of water trickling into the sink.
Sherlock's exasperated tone was clear as day and John laughed.
Unfathomable. This was the only way to describe the insurmountable spark of pain that erupted at the center of John Watson as he listened to Sherlock struggle to tell Molly Hooper that he loved her. Of course it was difficult because they’d been cast into a game designed by a psychopath unlike any they’d met before, who just so happened to be Sherlock’s own sister; but it was also difficult to hear him utter those three words to someone else.
“He didn’t.” She said, disbelieving, “No.”
"John, if you wanted to bring me here as a date, you didn't need to invent a case, though I admire the touch."
"What?" He asked coldly.
"Mycroft!" Lestrade exclaimed, "I thought you weren't going to make it?" He walked to the British government.
"John?" He heard Sherlock call out, and then he realized that he'd collapsed onto his back, "Are you alright?" A fuzzy and seemingly distant voice called out to him, "Stupid, of course you're alright, I can feel that much." The voice sounded bored, excited and upset all at once. Only Sherlock Holmes could achieve such a tone.
He managed to say, feeling that if he said it by thought, it made the words less embarrassing. With one last heartfelt squeeze on Sherlock's arm, John let go, turning and walking quickly up the stairs to his room. Sherlock stood speechless, and nearly breathless, in the middle of the sitting room, his arm still bent. He could feel the residual heat from where John's hand had been and he glanced down at it.
"Nothing, I was just interested 's all." He replied rather unconvincingly and Lestrade nodded.
When he looked sideways at Sherlock, he saw the man tilting his head, no doubt trying to deduce what he was about to say, but John knew he wouldn’t see this coming, he couldn’t possibly. He had no idea of John’s feelings for him, he couldn’t have, or he would have been acting different toward him. Sherlock’s poor self-esteem no doubt had something to do with the fact that he couldn’t see what was right in front of him, and for once, though he hated it, John was a little bit thankful.
What was even more interesting to him, was the concern he saw radiating from the consulting detective. It was coming off of him in waves, and John wasn't sure if it was the brevity of the situation, or his eyes playing tricks on him, but he could have sworn he saw a sort of aura around the man. He shook it off, and it went away.
In every age there was a teller, and this teller brought new "prophecy" about soul mates. But he refused to believe that. The man or woman chosen to be the Teller was just a religious zealot and a fool. No one had found a true soul mate in
"That's what I call sparks." John smiled and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"You're the sod. You can't steal my best insult for you." He smiled and began putting on his jacket.
“That’s...” Sherlock breathed, “That’s my mothers name.” He furrowed his brows, looking to John, “You named your daughter after my mother?”
Sherlock sounded agitated, but then again, it was rare that he didn't. He walked into the room and found the box, opening it. He looked to John who nodded and they both opened their eyes. They stood staring at one another, unwilling to avert their gaze to see if it worked. When finally, John found the courage to look. There was a key being tossed into the air next to him, the woman who'd tossed it was looking up expectantly, but she was frozen. Her face was stuck in a half smile, half gawk, her hand out, fingers turned upward.
"Liar." John smiled and Sherlock looked back, rolling his eyes.
"What do you suggest we do today then? I can look over the case files and make a deduction, it's simple, really." Sherlock steepled his hands beneath his chin and stared intently at his mate, John cleared his throat uncomfortably, squirming a bit under Sherlock's glare.
"Yeah, let's go practice stopping time." John smiled at his suggestion. Sherlock raised his brows and nodded.
“Something’s on your mind,” Sherlock said, breaking John’s lack of concentration and he looked up, his brows raised in mock-confusion, “Oh please, you’ve been on that page for twenty minutes, and don’t think I haven’t noticed how your eyes haven’t moved down it at all. You’re so distracted you can’t read that boring crime novel, or you would have known the maid is the culprit by now, so put it aside and talk to me.”
"Ok," He said, standing, John rose almost in sync with him, "Well, thank you for you time." He held out a hand for the prophet to shake, and he took it, reaching out slowly, pulling off his glove in the process. As their hands latched, the Teller became very stiff, his eyes rolled back into his head.
"Sherlock." John said quietly, after he was sure the detective was feeling better.
As much as he wanted to see his daughter, he didn’t want to leave Sherlock behind even more. He knew if he left now he’d never come back, it was as if he’d be going into witness protection. At least that’s how Mycroft made it seem.
"Most days you don't." John said, smiling at the detective.
"I thought
"Honeymoon." John stood his ground, his hands resting on Sherlock's chest briefly, "Though, should you like it to be just a sex holiday, I promise you there will be an abundance." He looked up at the now gaping detective and winked, rising up on his toes to kiss the slack-jawed man lightly before he turned and walked to their table, "Come now, husband."
"She's right, you know." He said suddenly.
"So, spill!" Molly exclaimed, extremely excited.
"You two were simply meant to find each other. It was your destiny. What you do with that knowledge is up to you. It can be romantic, or it can remain platonic, as was your predecessor's bond. Just know that now that you've found one another... This bond will never be broken." George warned.
"Sherlock is very lucky." John stared at him incredulously, a mild
“I’m your nurse, right?” Sherlock said, turning to look back at his blogger, “I’m going in to help you. You need me in there, admit it.” John stared up at him, unsure whether he should be angry or thankful.
"Jeanette was wrong, you're a rubbish boyfriend." He sighed and with a wink he descended the steps, leaving an extremely surprised and slightly blushing John in his wake.
"That doesn't matter." He said aloud, but in his head he was replying to Sherlock,
"Cute," John finished, laughing. Sherlock huffed, throwing his head back against the chair, "Alright, I've got an idea."
Sherlock said with a laugh, the smile on his face as he glanced back at John genuine. He'd really thought John had told a joke, and John went along with it. Though it was a nice thought, the idea that he and Sherlock had a bond powerful enough to stop the whole world turning. It was romantic and completely insane, but he liked the idea.
“She can what?” Sherlock asked, his brow instantly furrowing.
“Rhode Island.” Olivia stated as if she was a bit embarrassed, “You’re John’s wife?”
"Great. You're not going to like what you hear most of the time. Believe me." Sherlock scoffed.
“What does he ever want?” Sherlock asked, “I just can’t fathom how he did it.” He scoffed audibly at himself, “He shot himself in front of me, and now he’s back?” He shook his head,
“Should we go?” She asked, looking at the elder Holmes and smiling.
There was more that they had to be, though, they had to become the men they were meant to be. He had to learn how to be himself, his true self, Mary’s message be damned. Who they really were, did in fact matter, and he couldn’t hide from his own truth any longer.
“Are you John Watson?” She cried, her accent American.
He completed via thought. John laughed, shaking his head. He leaned forward and set his cup on the table after taking a big drink. When his back hit the couch again, this time his arm was up and snaking around Sherlock's shoulders, pulling the man closer to him. The moment his finger tips hit the detective's shoulder, a spark of sorts shot through him, calming his nerves in an instant. It was as if all the chatter and neurons firing in his brain ceased, and he was at peace. John felt it too, not as much as Sherlock, as his brain never moved that much. Sherlock rested his head beneath John's chin, closing his eyes. Before the cup fell from his hands, John grabbed it, setting it beside him on the couch,
"Stop it." He hissed quietly at John.
He responded.
“Uh... Yes.” John replied, stepping back warily, “Who are you?” He licked his lips nervously and waited for her reply.
“It’s good, John. Calm down.” Sherlock commanded, staring at his friend, almost amused. Olivia on the other hand was smiling widely, completely entertained.
"You were expecting something more spectacular or obscure?"
"No, inspector." Sherlock said, not looking up from his work on the computer with the camera, and it progressed from there.
"It'll start soon, the fall. One little push and off you pop." George said, his accent shifting into something more Irish. Sherlock stared across at the man in horror as his accent shifted again, "She's a bad one, that Mary. Very naughty. All those wet jobs for the CIA." He began laughing darkly. John stood aside and stared at them with a small look of terror as he continued to speak in accents and voices that weren't his to begin with. Sherlock finally managed to free his hand after he said a line about missing him.
“Probably not, no... But I’ll do my best to help.” John smiled reassuringly, “Hell, I’ll ask Mycroft for help if I have to.”
"Oi, not all of it."
or..." John asked, looking back out at the street. Sherlock shrugged, removing the gun from Charles' hands and putting said hands behind the man's back. John however, ran out of the alley, onto the street where there was a car stopped and two people stopped mid-stride on the sidewalk. He walked up to them, snapping in their faces.
They wandered around, blindly fumbling from one place to the next, never realizing their full potential. Until one day, The Great Holy Being in the sky split everyone in half, giving them a new purpose: to find that other part of themselves.
"It's for a case." John added, sensing Sherlock wouldn't want Mycroft to know about their having bonded just yet.
“Well then where? 221C?”
Hey there, so I figured I'd continue just a bit. Give a little more. After all, there's ALWAYS more story to tell, right!? Well here's the boy's wedding. And then some. But we'll start with the nuptials! It's just a short sweet little thing.
“I love you.” John repeated, a smile forming on his face that Sherlock was matching, the detective brought up his own hand to rest against John’s cheek, his thumb worried over the skin there, John leaned in, feeling so happy his chest could burst.
“I don’t know.” Sherlock growled, bursting through the door, frightening Olivia.
ringing through his mind. Mycroft stood emotionless and finally spoke again, "That's the last time I'm trying that." With an eye roll he stepped around the stunned John and entered the flat.
"A lot of people think mates are predestined by some deity... But they're not. It's much simpler, really. It's blood lines. There were a few hundred or so at the start, those numbers have dwindled just a bit." George explained.
He heard the faintest whisper from Sherlock in the back of his mind. He looked over to briefly lock eyes with the consulting detective who looked bored to death, listening to a conversation between a very knackered Mrs. Hudson, a slightly sloshed Molly and a completely sober Lestrade.
“With you, Sherlock, that’s the only thing I want to be. I think it’s important that I share this now, it’ll probably be the most important thing I’ve ever done, ever said. You, are everything.” He’d shut his eyes and turned his head in typical Sherlock avoidance fashion, but John was ready, he’d already unclenched his fist and placed his open hand beneath the chin of the man in front of him and turned it back to face him, “I know it might be difficult for you to understand, or to grasp what I’m telling you, but I’m going to need you to try. I’ve loved you, Sherlock, for so long, I can’t really remember a time when I didn’t. You have saved me so many times, in so many ways, though that’s not why I love you, that’s why I need you to know that I love you. I want nothing more than to see you every day, to fall asleep with you beside me, to wake up with you, to raise Rosie with you. She loves you as well, you know.
Sherlock turned to John and said, though his lips didn't move.
John sighed, scrubbing his hands over his face as he sat in his chair, "This isn't good, Sherlock."
John's exasperated tone rang out through Sherlock's head.
"What was that?" The cabbie asked.
John Watson sat in front of his laptop, staring at a blank blog page, unsure of what to write.
"We've been sent to fetch you."
"I know." He said, "I don't know what Moriarty expects to happen."
Sherlock smirked and began to walk to 221B.
John turned and began walking again. They passed more frozen people,
"John, I imagine..." He began but sighed, a pulse, "I'm sure you think love is a mystery to me." He said finally, glancing up for a moment at John through his lashes, noticing the surprised look that crossed his features, another pulse, "It's chemistry isn't." He reached out and grabbed onto John's hand, two of his fingers feeling for his wrist. Sherlock's aura brightened at the touch and John couldn't control the increase in his pulse, and he knew that's what Sherlock was looking for.
Sherlock apologized.
"Sorry." Sherlock rasped.
The fire crackled behind them as they came together, their lips fit perfectly, and they were finally able to be who they really were in 221B Baker Street.
“Curiosity...” She half smiled, “Plus I have Lupus, having kidney trouble, it’d be nice to know if she’s a match... Maybe she’d feel bad about abandoning me, offer one up, if I ever needed it.” She sighed, sitting back against the chair as if telling her story was a weight off her shoulders.
"Yes, but I knew you'd start deducing my reasoning behind coming here instead of going to our regular place like Angelo's, which I admit, might have been better suited. But I was aiming to impress, and even now, I realize, was a stupid idea."
"I don't wear ties." Sherlock smirked, looking down at John who had his hands half extended. They were floating in the air midway to Sherlock's collar bones, unmoving from the abandoned action.
"No, I mean it, it's heartwarming. You'll do anything for him!" She exclaimed.
"You're a terrible liar, Dr. Watson." Mycroft remarked.
“Mm.” John replied, pulling the folder out of his jacket, “I uh... I guess I’ll sleep in Sherlock’s room.” He said, standing and turning, heading for the detective’s room.
"Oh, of course." Sherlock said, stuffing the ash tray back into his jacket. He stared out his window, wondering why he'd stolen an ash tray. He supposed it was for the comedic relief. He felt John shimmy closer to his side and felt instantly warmer.
“What’s wrong?” Olivia asked, observing everyone’s uneasy looks, especially Mary’s, who had her hand rubbing at her stomach.
"I am not cute." Sherlock growled, "I'm... I'm-"
"The story of a lifetime."
“Don’t know... Just basic studies, I guess... I’m not really a planner. I don’t know what my future holds as of yet.” She laughed quietly, “I guess that’s kinda obvious, I hopped on a plane to London to find a detective to help me find my mom without any money or a big picture.”
"You'll save me." Sherlock smirked, "It's your specialty." John shook his head and leaned in, pressing a chaste kiss to his forehead. Sherlock let his eyes fall shut for that moment, reaching up and grabbing onto John's wrists. He removed John's hands from his face and held them together, kissing his knuckles before John finally pulled away.
"You did it." Sherlock said, almost disbelieving.
"Good." John said, shaking out his fist after the hit, "That should bleed." Then he reached into his pocket, pulling out the handcuffs that were previously attached to him and Sherlock. He cuffed one end to Moriarty and then proceeded to drag the frozen body of the criminal behind him and cuffed him to the ladder on the side of the building, "That should hold you." He smiled, admiring his handy work once again and turned, running back down the stairs and out of the hospital, back to Sherlock's side. And then he closed his eyes, concentrating.
He said with a wink as they pushed back into the room where everyone was taking their seats at large round tables that were set up just for them.
"Dunno... Like I said, we're just two
“Well, yes, London has always been your home, but you can’t let your fear of a different place get in your way of being with your family.” He said quickly, John shook his head.
"Together? Yes." Sherlock answered, not quite the answer John was looking for.
“What?” Olivia asked, “What’s it mean?”
“I know.” John said into Sherlock’s coat collar, “I’ll miss you.” He managed to say, they remained in the embrace for a few moments longer, finding a strange comfort in each others touch. Something new, they’d just discovered, and yet had no more time left to study further.
“Wait, what?” She asked, bringing her hands to her mouth, concerned.
“I will miss you, John.” Sherlock said sincerely, and John shook his head.
The moment Mycroft met Lestrade, the air seemed to change. Mycroft was... Softer, somehow. They shook hands, nothing happened. Or at least that's how Sherlock saw it. Mycroft claimed his hand burned where Lestrade touched it. And since that day, they'd been inseparable. It was annoying to Sherlock, however, because the day they'd met, was the first day he was allowed on a crime scene by his own volition. After that, he wasn't sure whether Lestrade let him in because he needed him, or because his brother made him. He favored the former. Only his brother forming a fake bond could make him feel inadequate. But he soon realized there wasn't an actual bond, they were just... In love. No matter how many times Mycroft said, "Caring is not an advantage," and he
“Yeah, well...” John said, still not on the best terms with the British government, “We’ll be going in then... Unless you were about to...”
"Yeah it is a big deal." John said, looking at the DI, laughing. The DI also began to laugh after his heart rate returned to normal and everyone in the room, save for Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock began laughing. Sherlock wasn't sure how to feel.
"It's police work, a small amount of money, barely worth the petrol to get out there." Sherlock rolled his eyes before closing them. John could literally see him retreating into his mind palace and groaned again.
"Out?" John asked, turning back to the detective.
He didn't avert his gaze as his hand snaked inside to wrap around Sherlock,
“You’re in London.” She replied simply, “There’s no one as brilliant as Sherlock Holmes in Providence, Rhode Island.”
“But she didn’t kill me-”
"Well you might want to get rid of the fire, because I have no clue if I'll start everything or just the water."
"It's after I leave." He explained.
"Okay." Sherlock replied,
“This is my home.” John replied quickly, Sherlock’s eyes flicked up.
It jumps around a wee bit, it's not completely cohesive from day to day. Obvs. :)
“Her room is empty. They’re gone, they’re really gone.” He began to panic and Sherlock’s eyes widened as he grasped the situation. He led John to his chair, taking the letter from his hands as he opened it.
“You’d get used to it.”
"Are you doing that?" He asked.
"Exactly. Both the Holmes brothers are like that, though. I'd known Mycroft for years. We'd met many times. I was the one who always pulled Sherlock off the streets or away from crime scenes, and eventually I was the one who let him into crime scenes. I spent four years looking after that boy, always turned him over to the care of Mycroft Holmes." He shook his head at the memory, as if not believing it had actually happened.
“This won’t do.” Sherlock sighed, picking her up and staring into her face, “We’ve got to do something about that.” Violet smiled, drool dripping from her mouth down onto Sherlock’s trousers. He followed the trail of liquid, looking back up after it his, unamused.
Sherlock spat suddenly. John almost jumped at the angry voice in his head. He looked to Sherlock, confusion on his face, but stopped. He did nothing else for the remainder of the gathering.
"I know." Sherlock replied.
"That's your idea of fun?" John asked, almost not believing it, but it
“My old room, she seems to like it up there. We could bring her crib so she doesn’t have to keep sleeping in that portable death trap-”
"You were the one who agreed to this ridiculous article, and now you're nervous that Moriarty might use the knowledge of our bond against us!" Sherlock droned as John stood before him, worry budding in his gut.
"Oh, right. That's it, then. You can't take not being the exceptional one. It kills you that I'm better at this than you." John smiled ruefully down at his mate, walking closer to him with every growled word, "Because it's all well when you want to show off, but I do something I've only been practicing for a few weeks, and you can't handle it. You can't take me showing off a bit. I didn't expect that, I really didn't." He stood in wait for Sherlock's reply.
"Sherlock, your clothes!"
"Oh great, more lore you didn't know about! Mates transfer pain to one another, perfect." Sherlock scoffed as he plopped down onto the couch, throwing his foot onto the table in front of him and massaging his thigh. The pain began to go away suddenly and that's when Sherlock realized John was sitting on the couch, his eyes closed, breathing steadied in concentration.
"She doesn't bring me tea."
“What were you going for?”
“Ready to go?” He asked, offering his kindest smile. She sniffed, smiling back as she stood, following John out the door. They took a cab to Baker Street, getting out at the exact same time a black car pulled up in front of the flat. John paid and exited the cab, Olivia followed soon there after, nervously fidgeting with her hands.
next time. Red beard was very important to me." The detective sighed and tapped his fingers on the arms of his chair.
Sherlock knelt in front of him, placing a hand on his shoulder. John flinched at the touch slightly, looking up from his hands to stare incredulously at Sherlock. Even when his eyes were blood shot and there were tears pouring down his face, he still managed to look surprised and baffled at Sherlock’s display of affection. The surprise soon wore off though and he went back to crying. Sherlock remained at his side.
He could feel Sherlock drawing nearer and wasn't surprised when the door creaked open. He barely glanced to the side as Sherlock shuffled in awkwardly walking to the edge of his bed, kneeling down on the floor, in front of John. He could see Sherlock's aura, it wasn't pulsing as it normally was, it was a low glow, brightened only by his proximity to John, to his closeness to the bond.
“What for?” She asked, feigning concern.
"Woah! Wait!" The man shifted his gaze to John, "What are you doing!? Put your hands where I can see them!"
John rubbed his hand down Sherlock's front, landing along the front of his trousers, which were beginning to grow tight. Sherlock let out a throaty groan at the contact,
“Good, this is good.” He said, staring at the bag and then back at Sherlock, “This is good, right?”
"What?" He asked, seemingly annoyed. He turned to John who was still seated beside his girlfriend of the month, "Why'd you do that? How did you do that?"
"I'd certainly hope so." John muttered.
"Sherlock," John said, after 20 minutes of silence in Baker Street, "What the hell was that? You experimenting with some sort of chemicals, or something?" He asked and was immediately aware that if it were chemical burns, he should try to clean them off. He ran to the kitchen and grabbed a flannel, running to Sherlock and grabbing his hand. He started to wipe away at the tops of his hands, but the grip he had on the detective soon started to burn too and he pulled back, "Bloody hell! Sherlock, what is this stuff!?"
“Right. Thanks.” He said, settling back against the chair, “You can head home, Mary. I think I’m gonna stay here tonight.”
"Sherlock's effect on you." He answered plainly.
“Well, you can tell them that they can pamper mine.” He smiled up at the detective and Sherlock nodded, “Would you like to hold her?” He asked and Sherlock shook his head.
Sherlock hopped out of bed.
John had tears streaming down his cheeks, as did Mrs. Hudson, who was still watching them, holding her hands over her heart. Sherlock began slipping John's ring onto his finger as he continued.
As soon as John was in Sherlock’s room he ripped the file open, throwing it onto the bed as he peeled his jacket off. He knew giving Sherlock the flash drive to copy before he burned it in front of Mary was a good idea. He leafed through the papers, looking at pictures of Mary from years before when her initials were R.A.
“Alright.” Sherlock sighed, unsure of what to do, so he remained silent as they made their way to 221B. When they arrived, John sprang out of the car, running into the flat, leaving Sherlock to pay for once. When Sherlock entered the sitting room, John was running into it from upstairs.
"Well, yes." Both the detective and blogger answered together.
"So why have you invited me here, Dr. Watson?" She asked, her hands wringing together in anticipation. John turned around with a tray in his hand, setting it down on the table, pouring first Kitty a cup and then giving Sherlock his. Taking his own last, he sat in his chair, turning to the journalist, "What are you offering me?" She asked instead after the room remained silent. John smiled at her and after a quick glance to Sherlock who rolled his eyes and nodded, he turned back to her.
“You wouldn’t clean your room, you crazy git.” He laughed to himself, settling down against a pillow, he shuffled awkwardly, getting the blanket free from beneath him and as he made himself comfortable he turned onto his side, turning his face into the pillow. As he closed his eyes he inhaled deeply, the familiar scent of smoke and chemicals filling his lungs. As he breathed out he sighed a name, not just any name, the name that meant the most to him at that moment, the name of the person he’d just discovered would do anything for him, “Sherlock.”
Sherlock cleared his throat, pushing down the small spark of desire that weaseled its way into his belly, not smothering the flame, but kindling it and saving it for later. But not too much later, he hoped.
"I know." John smiled as he stepped onto the private aircraft, "Oh this'll do." He said, smiling widely as he took off his jacket. Sherlock reluctantly began to remove his and John rolled his eyes, quickly helping him out of it and pushing him into the seating area.
“Great. Awesome.” She stood, her face unamused as she turned to storm out of the flat, “Thanks a lot. Really.”
"Yes," Sherlock said, "Did you see..."
They parted, turning to their small group of friends as they were pronounced Watson-Holmes. Mrs. Hudson was applauding them, tears running down her face as she dabbed at her cheeks with her handkerchief.
“What?” John echoed and they stared at one another in silence, “No, of course not, I don’t want to kick you out, I want to live here, with you.”
smart."
“Oh, so what, he’s comparing himself to... Rumpelstiltskin?” She asked, as she said the name the pieces connected, “Seriously!? But no one has made a deal with him!” She shouted, Mary looked over from her place next to the Violet’s.
"By whom?" John asked again, Sherlock's brows perked up at the extreme confidence and anger beginning to emit across the bond. He glanced sideways at John but quickly flicked his eyes back to the men, taking in everything he could about them. John could feel all the deductions, and they were beginning to make him feel a bit light headed. He hadn't gotten used to them yet. The way they connected in Sherlock's brain still astounded him.
"Shut up, let's go."
Moriarty was a certified dick head. John thought to himself as he stared down at the bomb strapped around him. He knew he might one day die for Sherlock Holmes, but he never imagined it'd be like this. A crazy Irishman yapping in his ear and wearing a parka in a pool. Such an interesting turn of events.
It was sunset, facing the dull orange and pink of the setting sun, of course. They were standing in front of the wide open windows. Sherlock arranged to have a minister deliver vows to satiate John's ridiculous beliefs. The two men stood across from one another, Greg on John's side, Mycroft on Sherlock's. He'd wanted Billy, but John told him it was inappropriate to have a man he'd met in a drug den as his best man. There were a few people in attendance, just the one's who mattered. Sherlock's parents, Mrs. Hudson, Molly, and John's father, who was blubbering like a baby the entire time.
“Who’s here?” Mary asked, sitting up.
"So... What should we do then?" John asked Sherlock as he hurried after the detective.
“She’s American!” Mrs. Hudson giggled, “You’ve come a long way, but I suppose word of Sherlock’s talents has reached farther than he thinks.” She smiled warmly, bringing out a smile in the girl as well.
“Eighteen years ago.” She replied sadly, looking down at her twisted hands, “I was two, she gave me up.” She shrugged, smiling sadly at the two men.
Sherlock began speaking via their bond and John furrowed his brow, throwing a quick look sideways.
“You have thought about this.” John said.
"Only by blood." Sherlock rolled his eyes, "I'll be seeing you, Mycroft."
As he was slammed against the side of the car, confusion struck as he was being handcuffed to Sherlock. In what world was it a good idea to cuff the two of them together. They exchanged a look, closing their eyes simultaneously. Upon opening them, everyone had stopped moving. Everyone but Lestrade.
As Lestrade read him his rights, John suppressed the urge he felt to punch someone, though when Sally entered, looking positively smug, he thought he could deck her right there.
"I invited her." John said.
“So... He wants to collect...” John said, sniffing, “We can stop that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"She does, in the mornings." John said, staring over at his mate, mouth open slightly.
“It’s your fault, you know.”
“You know, just because we probably won’t ever get the chance to say it ever again...” John breathed, remembering when Sherlock dared to say that phrase, following it with a ridiculous cover, “I do love you, Sherlock Holmes.” Sherlock lifted his chin at that, clenching his jaw, his eyes becoming hardened before he allowed himself to smirk.
“She could have just come clean right then and there.” John said quickly, “Instead she chose to shoot my best friend. I mean really, the nerve...” He stopped himself before he got too loud, glancing back at Olivia who had headphones in as she wrote on a piece of paper, “She was only looking out for herself, Sherlock. She didn’t care about your feelings, or mine for that matter.”
have gone to 221B Baker Street to meet the mysterious Sherlock Holmes... But this wasn't a normal situation. Neither of them were normal, he could tell.
"Is that your ability? You can make people feel high?" Sherlock asked, his head becoming normal again, "Or does it only work on me?"
If John got what he truly wanted from Sherlock after all this was over, Molly would surely never come round again.
"His effect?" John asked.
“I know, I’m sorry.” He smiled and leaned down, kissing her.
"You have fought for me, you've killed for me, you've almost died for me. I suppose if marriage is what you want, I can get over my principles for you." His response drew an affectionate eye roll from John, "Only for you." He said softer, bringing his face down until his forehead was touching John's, when he kissed him their lips burned. The heat traveled through their faces and down their necks, a sensation they'd become acclimated to since they'd bonded three years prior. Every time they kissed or held hands or touched in any way, there was that heat, the ever present memory that they were one; they were supposed to meet and the heat reminded them that it was destiny.
"Do we really need that much food?" Sherlock asked, "I'm not going to eat, and there are only nine of us!" He growled.
I'm sorry this took so long. I got kinda stuck on how to end it. Sorry for jumping from the fall to here. I thought it'd be interesting!!!!
"Dammit!" He shouted, the cabby looking back at him, confused, "Sorry." He shook his head, continuing to listen into their conversation.
John circled his frozen partner, now husband and laughed quietly to himself. It had been ten minutes since he'd stopped the detective from insulting Anderson and some of Anderson's followers and transported them into a deserted and quiet hallway. After sighing and putting on a very angry face, he let Sherlock go.
“Could ask you the same thing.” He sang his reply, rolling his eyes, “Oh Sherlock, blanks in the gun, fake blood on a timer, it was staged, the same way yours was. Did you really think I’d shoot myself, all because of you.” He smiled again, “I mean we had something special, but not that special. Come on, be reasonable.”
"Not completely. I just know a lot about it. I had to take classes. Soul mates 101, Bonding 111. Things such as that. My favorite was History and Mythology of Soul Mates." John smiled into his food, "Did you know there were two men in the Victorian era that were supposedly so strongly bonded that they could automatically teleport to the others location. Apparently they were policemen, so it came in quite handy." John grinned across at his flat mate as he took a bite.
"Of course." He scoffed, "Why else would he have come here. Why else would he be targeting me so blatantly. I don't know what his plans are, yet... But we need to be on our guard." He sighed, standing from his chair. As he waltzed past John, he held out his hand, catching it in the crook of Sherlock's elbow, keeping him from passing.
“My room? But I do sleep on occasion, and I’m sure you wouldn’t want to share with-” He stopped talking, the pieces finally falling into place.
He began walking into the street, weaving around cars,
John's frantic voice called out in his mind.
"Yes, he's extremely annoying." Sherlock replied, ordering their food. They stood there in not completely uncomfortable silence until it was done. He paid and they left the establishment, heading back to 221B.
"I knew you'd save me." He whispered and John growled, pulling him in tighter.
“Have you spoken to Mary recently?” Sherlock asked suddenly, glancing up from his screen. John glanced back, his mouth twitching nervously as he sniffed in hard.
Seeing Sherlock at the tarmac was particularly hard, because he knew what it meant when Sherlock said six months. He was going to die, there was no doubt about it. This would be the last time they’d see each other, and this time there would be no tricks and no goodbye phone calls. That was it, there in front of that plane. He shook the man’s hand, though he really wanted to hug him, but thought it’d be inappropriate, Sherlock didn’t appreciate hugs. He’d hugged him once, that was at his wedding, and he received no response, so that was the last time he’d tried that. Then his worst nightmare came true.
“So... Olivia... You’re twenty?” He asked, narrowing his eyes at the girl.
"Doing what?" John asked, still concentrating on the calmness.
"Sherlock!" He shouted, squeezing his eyes shut and waiting, waiting for the sound that would mean the end of everything, but it never came. In fact, there were no sounds at all. He opened his eyes, his breathing rapid, but it hitched the moment he saw it. Sherlock was suspended in the air, a few feet away from the pavement, "Sherlock." He said quietly, running up to the frozen man, "Did I..." He reached out and touched him, a laugh escaping his lips. He looked around, everyone else was frozen as well. He doubled over, breathing heavily, the weight lifted off his shoulders and he let a few tears of relief slip out as well, "You bloody great git!" He growled, reaching out again and trying to decide the best way to pull Sherlock out of the air. He first pulled on the detective's arm, but then decided it might be easier to just turn the man into a standing position, his legs on the ground, so that's what he did. He bent the detective's waist, moving his legs down until his feet touched the ground. Though he was frozen, he wasn't any lighter, so John struggled a bit in the process of moving him. Once he had Sherlock standing, he thought that was a bad idea, thinking what if he continued to fall at full speed when he unfroze him, then his legs would be broken.
They were to be flat mate's then. He supposed he could do that. In a normal situation, he would
Sherlock smirked as he began to unbutton John's shirt.
"Cats out of the bag, John." Sherlock sighed.
“I had no other choice, believe me, when I say this, it was for the greater good.” Her accent had completely vanished and John stood, awestruck.
"Right, that's good... I always thought I was great." He replied and thought he could hear a whisper of,
"No... Because that was the last one..." He said defeated, "Ok."
"Sherlock." John said softly, his eyes closed. He was beginning to feel a bout of nausea and his head was pounding. Sherlock still didn't move his hand from the doctor's cheek, however, and suddenly his head was being filled with ideas, thoughts and memories that weren't his. John's eyes shot open as he saw a life that he'd never known flash before his eyes. Curly hair, crying green eyes, a red dog. A mean older brother, two parents who were only trying to do what's best. Isolation, fear, oblivion. Affirmation. Love. Hate. Stoic eyes that saw all, but failed to see all at once. This was Sherlock, this was his life, these were his memories,
"Well our futures are determined by our choices... So clearly you and I are thinking two completely different ways about something." Sherlock said, hailing a cab.
"No, it's just John." He said.
"Promise, Sherlock. Even if I'm in danger, don't do anything without..." He breathed, "Without us discussing it. If you die..."
"How would you know?" The pissing contest was getting old, and John had had about enough of it. He touched Sherlock's arm lightly, causing the detective to break his gaze from his brothers and look down at him. The reassuring gaze John threw his way was enough to help the detective regain his composure.
John's excitement began to show through his frustration with Sherlock.
A while later, John and his date were ready to head off to her friends party.
“Of course, I love you.” His voice was softer than John had ever heard it, even when they were in that horrible place and he had to say it to Molly. There was no one telling him to say it softer, it was all him, and it was the most sincere he’d ever heard him.
"No. They were two men as well." George said, "What I'm saying is, your families are two of the originals, your names have been in this since the beginning, since the formation of the bonds. It may have been predestined, but not by any deity."
John said, giving his hand a squeeze, before Sherlock could reply, John added,
“There is a difference between the love you have for me and the love you have for Mary.”
Sherlock warned via his thoughts and John slowly stopped laughing, reaching over and patting the detective twice on the shoulder.
"You'll be fine." He said rolling his eyes as the car came to a stop.
"Your future, should you choose to stay on this path." George said, quite calmly walking to the two men. He held out his hand for John to shake and with a weary look to Sherlock he breathed deeply, taking the man's hand, the same thing happened, his eyes rolled back into his head.
"You're reading mine." Sherlock exclaimed, sitting up. The moment was over, John knew it, he'd gotten too close, too comfortable; so he laughed and got off the couch, walking to his laptop.
“Shut up. No. Listen to me. You... Are my home.” He said it slowly, as if Sherlock couldn’t understand what he was saying.
“Look, something brought you to us...” John sighed, “You were meant to find us, obviously. Knowing what we know now we can’t turn you away. It’d be wrong of us... We...” He sighed again and Mary nodded.
"Only in death." Sherlock said sullenly.
"Sorry, what?" John asked, trying to sound as confused as possible.
"It would seem so." Sherlock replied and the two erupted into a fit of giggles.
"Well that was a complete waste of time." Mycroft sighed, "I'm sorry, I told you he wouldn't be able to help on this one."
"While that may be true, it doesn't mean it would be right, Sherlock." John smiled, unfreezing the room. Molly stopped dead in her tracks as she tried to continue her sentence, realizing John was no longer next to her. She turned, finding the newly-weds out on the dance floor.
“Should I go get you a cab?” She asked, walking to the door.
The headline played through Sherlock's mind and John smiled, knowing that once people read it, they'd never believe whatever Moriarty had planned. Or at least hoping.
"Promise me you won't do anything stupid."
after realizing you'd experienced my memories." He scoffed in response, standing from the couch, "This is absolutely the most ridiculous thing I have ever experi-eeennnce-OW!" Sherlock said, stopping his pacing as he felt an intense pain run along his shoulder and down to his leg, "Is that! Oh dear god!" Sherlock collapsed onto the ground in the fetal position.
Sherlock asked, very prim and proper, his tone mostly sarcastic.
“Yeah, yeah.” John sighed, picking up his back.
“Moriarty is comparing himself to the fairy tale character Rumpelstiltskin, the one who makes deals in exchange for the first born child of a person... And...” Sherlock stopped talking as he saw Mary’s face change.
"It is of dire importance, or else we wouldn't have come to you." Sherlock urged, when the phone rang.
"I'm sorry, that's simply impossible."
“You are my heart, John. Without you, I don’t think I’d be able to feel.” His revelation stopped John in his tracks, this bringing together of their lips completely forgotten in his mind as he absorbed what Sherlock had just said. Sherlock stayed put, cheeks flushing as he realized he’d rendered John utterly speechless. Suddenly John snapped out of it.
“You...” He reached up, his hand cupping Sherlock’s cheek. The detective leaned in to the touch, “What, Sherlock?” He began pulling his face down to his, so they were centimeters away from one another.
"I don't know, but I think," Sherlock sighed and helped John up off the floor, moving him over to the couch in the nicest way possible, "John, I believe we've just... Uh.." The consulting detective was having a hard time admitting he was wrong.
Sherlock whined and John laughed, loudly. That sound did echo through the halls, so much so, that Molly opened a door at the end of it.
Sherlock replied quickly.
John reminded him and he looked down at his sheet wrapped around his body. With a scoff he tugged on a suit and bound out of his room.
"Don't know, maybe it's my special ability." Sherlock smiled, getting suddenly excited.
"I'm fine, Sherloooo-Ow!" He shouted, going from calm to puzzled in an instant. On Sherlock's hands, and his own, where they'd just touched, steam was rising. The skin was beginning to bubble a bit.
“Of course, too many memories, it’s understandable that you should feel the need to relocate. I’ve done some research and there are quite a few suitable locations in your budget and much closer to here-”
"George, really?" Sherlock asked.
“It’s it obvious?” He stopped his pacing, glancing up from the floor to Sherlock, his eyes threatening, “I just wanted to show you that I’m real. That the video wasn’t some pre-recorded prank.” He stepped closer to the detective, “I’m here, Sherlock. I’m not going anywhere.” He shook his head, his smile still wide, “Not ever.” He whispered, stepping even closer to the detective before John shifted in front of him, creating a barrier between him and Sherlock.
As per Sherlocks request, they were to be married in an observatory. Though he'd originally wanted to do it in the lab at St. Barts, John told him it wasn't big enough, to which he protested that he didn't want that many people there... It went on and on, until they finally settled on the observatory.
"I know, it's strange, for someone who pays so much attention, you don't pay much at all. And that doesn't make sense. But it makes so much sense." John said, confusing himself slightly.
. John's voice popped in his head and Sherlock laughed and ran a hand through John's short hair; he growled and dragged his hands up, wrapping them around Sherlock's behind and pulling him closer, effectively sending the detective deeper into his own throat. All humor was sucked (
“You do-”
"I transported us." He smiled, tight lipped and Sherlock let his eyes wander, searching for a contraption that could move his frozen body with ease. A hand cart of some sort, but there was nothing.
." John laughed, helping Sherlock from the floor this time.
"Intimately." He said with a sly grin that made John only mildly uncomfortable.
They walked back into the sitting room where Olivia was sitting awkwardly on the couch, testing out a cup of tea.
“John, I-” Sherlock breathed, unable to finish as his breath hitched as John looked up, his thumb running across his knuckles.
He arrived at the flat, only to be met with Sherlock arriving behind him in a cab. They shook hands, nothing happened, nothing at all.
“I should have told you the moment...” Mary began, but stopped when John looked at her.
“Thank you so much!” She exclaimed, almost hopping out of her seat.
“You mean to evict me?” Sherlock opened his eyes, “What?”
"I don't know," John said, his brow furrowed, "You got anything?"
"They were detectives, Dr. Watson, get your facts straight." Sherlock rolled his eyes, "And it's just mythology. I don't believe it anymore than I believe that dragons exist." John laughed a bit at Sherlock's comparison.
Sherlock said and John stopped walking as he turned onto Baker Street, the cars were moving and people were walking.
“Eighteen years ago.” Olivia said, trying to reassure Mrs. Hudson.
“Oh, my name is Olivia Green... Can you take me to Sherlock Holmes?” She seemed hopeful, sniffing back another fit of tears.
“Oh, Sherlock.” Mrs. Hudson was in their doorway, holding Rosie, bouncing her up and down. The Baker Street Boys turned, slightly embarassed by their current situation, but Mrs. Hudson didn’t seem to mind, she’d always thought they were together anyway, “Didn’t you hear her crying? Oh probably not, you were so focused on each other. Well, kiss him already, don’t mind me.” She turned and headed down to her own flat with the baby and John turned back to Sherlock who was already beginning to laugh.
"You realize you say that out loud?" John joked, breathing and sighing as he brought a hand up to grab a hold of the arm Sherlock had outstretched. He rubbed his thumb along the man's forearm before releasing it and stepping back to plop down in his chair. Sherlock's arm dropped to his side and the detective turned, looking to his violin.
"Yeah, you know what..." Lestrade chimed in, "I noticed somethin earlier."
“Oh no, that’s alright, I can find a place, easy.” Olivia said, holding up her hands in defense.
"Mycroft." John said, cutting off any greeting, "Don't talk, just listen, Moriarty has three gunmen, one on me, one on Lestrade and one on Mrs. Hudson. Take them out." He hung up, stuffing the phone back in his pocket, knowing he would be jumping out of his seat the moment he heard Lestrade was a target.
The surge of passion that coursed through him in that moment was enough to send Sherlock right over the edge of his orgasm, but he held back, knowing that John was just getting started and wouldn't want it to be over so soon. But the possessiveness that he'd just born witness to was overloading his senses and he couldn't figure out what to do with himself. Years of training his focus had just been overruled by a few simple words. Suddenly he was achingly hard and the hand John had wrapped around him wasn't enough contact, the simple tugging wasn't nearly enough friction, he needed more. He needed to feel full, to feel whole.
"Five months, four days and seventeen hours." Sherlock said and John looked up at him, wide eyed.
“Do shut up, Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock groaned, turning to Lestrade.
“Kay!” Olivia shouted, “Night!” She waved, though he couldn’t see her and as the door to Sherlock’s room shut, she folded her hands in front of her, looking down at them sadly,
“Yes, but let’s forget about that until we have an actual reason to worry, for now... Let’s be excited, baby Sherlock Watson is on it’s way!” Sherlock said, turning to sit in his seat. The other three exchanged confused glances, shrugging it off and sitting down, waiting for any news.
He spouted off rather quickly.
"Yes. But not as strongly as you two. Greg has very small ties to these lines, second cousin twice removed sort of ties. Nowhere near as close as the ties you two have."
They arrived back at Baker Street and immediately went upstairs. Sherlock sat on the couch, tucking his legs up into himself and wrapping his arms around them. He didn't immediately retreat into his mind palace, John took it as a win. However, he wished Sherlock would stop staring at him so intently.
"I did." John said, turning to face Sherlock, his eyes wide, "I bloody did it." He smiled, walking over to Sherlock, who rested a hand on his shoulder, his face proud and congratulatory.
On this particular morning John woke up to the sound of knocking, hurried and unsure and John sprang up, looking around groggily. Mary made a noise, turning over in bed and John sighed, looking down at his pregnant wife, furrowing his brow. If he’d had a choice in the matter, he wouldn’t stay there, not with her. She’d shot his best friend for Christ’s sake. The knocking sounded through the house again and John hurried out of bed and to the door, having forgotten about it.
"So turn it back on." Sherlock said,
As soon as Moriarty left, Sherlock ran to his flat mate, ripping the parka off of him. He couldn't stop himself from gripping the sides of John's head.
"I know." He said, smiling as he opened it.
"I know." Sherlock said, John flicked his eyes upward, his tongue inadvertently darting out to wet his lips. Sherlock could feel his desires, and longed to reciprocate them, but it was not the time for that, "The article will hit the stands this Saturday, and when it does, I'm sure we'll have plenty of press to talk to. But for now..." He stood, readying himself to leave, "Let's just enjoy our lives as they are." John tried to hold onto Sherlock, but something told him now was not the time, so he let go. With a quick glance and a small smile Sherlock left the room and John sighed, settling down into his bed, knowing he wouldn't be falling asleep easy.
"Sherlock." He shouted in an accent very close to John's, "I knew it. I knew I was right all along." His visions with John were much shorter and he smiled as he released the soldiers hand, he looked to Sherlock, "If I were you, I'd do what John wants. His future, with the way he's thinking now, is much brighter for the both of you." George raised his eyebrows as he turned and walked back to his chair, "Think about it Mr. Holmes. Either way you're going to fall, you just have to decide which one will be better."
John replied kindly, matching the detective's tone.
“I was at a pub watchin a match when it interrupted. Haven’t been to the Yard yet. Got the call about Mary and hurried over, picked up Mrs. Hudson along the way.”
“Of course, John. I’d love nothing more than to have you back here, but, the space, there’s not much, and where would Rosie sleep?”
Sherlock shouted, stepping up onto the edge of the building,
"Because we're home, and speaking out loud is easier." John growled, "How am I supposed to turn the water back on?"
“It’s done.” Sherlock said.
“Course.” John grunted.
"Yeah I can see it." He replied and John shot him a confused glance.
"Incredibly."
"I may be on the side of the angels, but don't for one second think that I am one of them." And then realization dawned on Moriarty and he pulled out a gun, putting it into his mouth, Sherlock stumbled back and concentrated. The criminal froze.
John said, and Sherlock looked the the other side. There were families stopped mid stride, arms around each other, smiles on their faces, seemingly in the middle of a conversation. Cars stopped in the middle of the street, people running across it behind them. All frozen,
"Because we wanted to get away from Lestrade as soon as possible?" Sherlock asked, and John looked up at him, they allowed themselves to laugh for a brief moment, until the brevity of their situation set in.
“I love you, John Watson.” His deep rumble of a voice surged through John’s chest and sunk down into his stomach, quelling the fear that had been bubbling to the surface.
"If all else fails, we can just freeze things." John winked, backing away as he turned and walked out the door. He received his response from Moriarty then, he was waiting on the roof for him.
“He did.” John nodded, “Made sure the files on you were in his head and when he said yes, he shot him. Right in front of the police, helicopters and all.”
“Violet.” John said quietly, looking down lovingly at the small child. Sherlock smirked over his shoulder, observing everything he could about the baby, trying to deduce what it must have been like inside of a womb.
"Yes, thank you. We'll be fine, you can go in there and leave us." John said, in an oddly demanding tone that made Sherlock's shoulder's tense and his face heat, "And, if Mycroft has installed any cameras, I suggest you turn them off." He smiled, tight lipped, but the attendant tilted her head, clearly confused.
"Your land lady let me in." She said, staring at him in challenge.
didn't notice the spark of adoration brewing in the back of his mind as he averted his eyes away from his flat mate and back into his food. This was a bit not good.
Two more hours later, there was a little baby Watson.
“No?” He asked, his smile turning devious, “Ok.” He shrugged and stepped back, returning back to the safety of his body guards, as if he was truly afraid of what Mary could do, though it seemed unlikely.
"Sherlock, watch out!" John said as Sherlock looked ahead, almost running face first into someone, but John tugged him back before he could do so. Sherlock barely avoided a collision with the frozen man and instead found himself knocking into John. Their laced fingers made the simultaneous fall unavoidable and soon Sherlock found himself falling on top of John with a huff.
“Not really, no.” He growled.
“If you don’t hurry, you’ll miss your flight.” Sherlock warned, backing away from John after they’d released each other.
"Yes." Sherlock replied calmly, looking as bored as ever. John looked over at him, glancing down at his sheet again.
"You're making me feel light headed." Sherlock held up a hand, "Stop, please." He laughed suddenly, letting his head fall onto his hand.
"That makes no sense." John shook his head, but decided to lay the detective flat onto the ground, so it wouldn't matter if there was any gravitational pull when he unfroze him, there'd be absolutely nowhere for him to go. He stepped back after he finished and admired his handy work. He was about to unfreeze things when he stopped, wondering if when he unfroze them, would Moriarty also unfreeze. He looked up, deciding to run up there and take Moriarty down while he was frozen. He ran up to the roof, walking out to see the frozen criminal, his hand in the shape they would be if he was holding a gun in his mouth, but the gun was gone. He laughed, walking up to face the monster. He lowered the man's hands, laughing again at the wild look on his face. He then turned, clenching his fist, he thought, he might as well. He reared back and swung that fist with all his might, punching the consulting criminal straight in his face.
"Hey." John said.
“Oh! John!” She shouted, hopping off the couch. John glared at her before looking around at the flat, shouting as he toppled over a random chair, “Are you alright?” She asked,
"But that last thought was so lovely, Sherlock." John teased, "I never knew you cared."
“Alright.” She leaned down the best she could and kissed the top of his head before standing, smiling at Olivia, “It was nice to meet you.”
Sherlock's fake anger could use some work and John breathed a quiet laugh, looking back fondly at his detective.
"How'd she get in here?" Sherlock asked, rolling his eyes at the woman and flopping into his chair.
John asked, looking behind him.
"And you stole my gun, for protection." He held it out and Sherlock eyed it warily, taking it only after Greg shook his hand once.
"No need to lie, John, I know all." He replied very seriously. John stared at him, mouth agape. Sherlock was too busy observing his surroundings to understand why the prophet suddenly burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter, "Oh your face!" He laughed, pointing to John before beckoning for the men to follow, "C'mon, let's have a sit." They were ushered into a small sitting room with not but a chair and a small sofa, barely big enough for two people.
"See what?"
“I am.” Olivia said, looking at Sherlock bewildered.
They climbed the steps to 221B and stumbled inside, still unsure of how they felt about the recent events. John was staring at his hands, the burns were beginning to fade. Sherlock was doing the same, staring at the backs of his hands. The burns on him, however, were not fading. Not at all. John glanced up at Sherlock, and again, thought he could see an aura surrounding the man. It was almost the same as it was at the pool, only this time it was pulsing quicker.
“Not a lot... Um, her name is Annie Green... She worked at a pet store... She had me when she was 19... Gave me up about two years later. Don’t know why, there was no note or anything. She just left me at a fire station.” She breathed deeply after finishing her story, as if it was a supremely difficult tale to tell. John looked from her to Sherlock, hoping he’d agree to take the case.
"We'll just have to show them, won't we?" Sherlock smirked, getting up from the table and moving to sit in his chair, crossing his legs, waiting. By the time the flashing blue lights appeared outside of Baker Street, Sherlock was completely ready and John was a nervous wreck. He suspected some of the nervousness was from Sherlock, but at the moment he didn't care. He went down to intercept Lestrade, following the man back up to see Sherlock had already readied himself, his jacket was on, his scarf was secure.
“Mycroft said they’ll take you.” She said, beaming.
“Mmm, yes.” Sherlock replied shortly, his hands steepled in beneath his chin.
"Uh... Nothing." Sherlock smirked, leaning into Molly. John watched with wide eyes and a flip in his stomach as the detective kissed the cheek of the now flustered pathologist, "Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper." She blushed furiously and downed half of her drink. Lestrade looked from John to Sherlock and back again with a knowing smile as the detective passed John, handing off money. John grinned as he stuffed it into his pocket.
“No.” He replied.
"Yeah... Him being in your head and what not. It's not a bad thing." Lestrade said, smiling, "You're rubbing off on him too. I can tell."
“It’s no big deal. I’ll find a place.” Olivia assured her, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.
“Did I know he planned to drug me? No.” Mary rolled her eyes.
“You wouldn’t have confessed this if you didn’t believe, even if it’s just a small fraction of hope, that I return your feelings.” Sherlock’s own hand covered John’s where it was still placed on his cheek, his smug half smile made John feel slightly weak, “Which I do.”
John heard these words in his head as if they were his own thoughts.
And just like that, Irene Adler was never involved in Sherlock's life.
"Very well." Mycroft agreed with an eye roll and hung up. They'd bring in John and Sherlock the next day.
“Well then where do you propose you go?” They sat in a comfortable silence for a moment while John took in the hilarity of the situation. He loved it when Sherlock didn’t quite grasp the simplest of things. It made him feel more human.
“You think so.” She stated.
"In there, no peeking." John winked at her and she blushed, walking away quickly and ducking into the room marked employee quarters. John rounded on Sherlock as soon as she was gone and as Sherlock was about to speak, John stalked towards him, effectively cutting him off as he reached out and brought his face within inches of the detective, "oh shut up." John said, bringing their lips together for the first time since the reception. They were alone this time, and he wasted no time in heating things up. He was not soft in his approach and pushed into Sherlock's mouth with a hunger, his hands tugging into the detective's hair. As he pulled away, he dragged his teeth along Sherlock's bottom lip, a surprised moan escaped his mouth, John smirked.
"You can shut it." John smiled back, "Just tell us why we're here and what we can do for you. If there's nothing else you need us for... If you called us here to show us a few photos of a dominatrix so you can assert some sort of dominance of your own over your younger brother..."
"Yeah, in uni. Who didn't." John laughed a small, quiet thing, "That's nothing close to what you did."
Still they carried on, and John thought it was all over the moment Euros told him he’d have to kill one of them; though they shared much over the years, there was still a small fraction of doubt inside of John. He didn’t think he mattered to Sherlock, not as much as Mycroft. His level of intellect could never compare to that of the elder Holmes, even though he knew Sherlock thought of him as superhuman, even though he knew how much he meant to the detective, though his deduction skills were not nearly as refined. Mycroft was still family.
“Of course I do, you’ve repeated half the words that I’ve said about you back to me just now in your speech, and you can’t believe that I love you as well?” Sherlock’s voice held a hint of humor that John didn’t miss, but he couldn’t find it in himself to laugh, his heart raced, his palm was probably sweating against Sherlock’s cheek, but he couldn’t move.
; to stop everything." He responded briefly and quietly. John stayed silent, listening to the thoughts running through Sherlock's head. He decided to calm them the best he could, so he began running his free hand through the detective's hair. Sherlock groaned in response and closed his eyes. John listened as his thoughts ceased and all that was left was the hum of appreciation.
"Indeed we do." Though he was mildly certain he already knew what they were feeling differently about. His side tingled with the urge to lean over and press against John; for the moment, he allowed himself to give into the need. He and John refused to look at one another, but he could hear in the back of John's mind, a small inkling of a contented sigh.
After several tedious hours filled with insincere thank you's, the reception ended. The speeches were over, Mycroft's bored Sherlock to tears; everyone else cried as well, why, he didn't know. Lestrade's had everyone laughing as he told stories about Sherlock and John on crime scenes. John was especially pleased when most of the stories revealed how stubborn yet completely selfless Sherlock could be.
"No, I'll do anything for you! Just tell me what you want me to do." He replied.
“Yeah.” John sighed, clearing his throat, “Invite us to Christmas dinner at your parent’s house and I’ll forgive her.” He smiled, knowing Sherlock would never do that.
"This is strange." He said. John's brows shot up, his head tilted, he opened his mouth to respond and shut it once again, releasing a small sound that was akin to laugh, but could have been a whimper. He looked at Sherlock again.
"I did." John replied, taking his hand into his, a glimmer of gold appearing on his other hand and Sherlock felt his stomach twist, "I think you can deduce what I'm about to say to you, but let me say it anyway." He stood from the table, dropping down to one knee in front of his mate, "If you could see your way to being my husband, my life mate, my love... I'd probably be the happiest man in existence." John smiled as Sherlock withdrew one of his hands, cupping the side of John's face.
"Yeah." John responded shortly, clenching and unclenching his fists, "What do you think he meant? My path, with the way I'm thinking now..."
There was a brief squint of Sherlock's eyes as they released one another's hands and they realized simultaneously that neither of them were surprised, and also that neither had been expecting a thing.
Sherlock could no longer sit still, however. He was itching to get out, and beckoned for John to follow him as he threw on his Belstaff.
"Well that's a pointless statement." He said, "I'm being called because I
"You and your lore, when are you going to realize it was all wrong." Sherlock was busy focusing on Charles, deducing all he could about the man.
John said via the mind and hurried out of the house with the consulting detective on his heels.
"Been practicing." John replied simply.
"Where's your coat?" She asked, confused.
“The couch would wreak havoc on your back after a long time. I’m sure we could invest in a pull-out, but even then, it would be horrible for-”
"The bird on the building across the street? Yes." Sherlock replied quickly before they both realized what he said. They snapped their gaze back to one another and both got up, running to the window to look across the street. And as fate would have it, there was a bird. Its chirps weren't loud enough for a person with normal hearing to observe, but they could hear it loud and clear as if it were in the flat with them.
"Brothers, yes." He replied.
"Well then I'm not going, either." John concluded, looking past Sherlock to the client from the previous day.
Sherlock watched the small mousy girl, Molly Hooper, dance about him. He knew she was trying to get a feel for him and possibly find a way to make skin to skin contact. In the back of his mind he was laughing at her, but he put on a stone cold front. She'd brushed her fingers against his when she gave him his coffee, he was sure of it. But what he was also sure of, was that there would be no electricity, no heat, no forming of a bond. It simply didn't happen. Her disappointment was written across her face, she'd known him for all of one day and was hoping that he was her mate. It was preposterous; she was a smart woman, a woman of science, surely she didn't follow the
John asked, worriedly.
"You're a great boyfriend."
"So will you help us, Mr. Holmes? We really are all baffled." The client interrupted John's onslaught of insults, thankfully. Sherlock wasn't awake enough to accept the brunt of them. John smiled at the client.
“It sure has.” She smiled widely, “But uh, yeah... I guess I’ll just make my way to a hotel of some sort. Didn’t think this trip through completely.” She laughed awkwardly, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear.
“See we went to Magnussens.” John said, and Mary’s mouth dropped a bit, yeah, definitely lying, John could see it.
“So...” Olivia said, “Let me get this straight, not only am I your daughter...” She looked up at Mary, “But you knew?” She asked, looking to Sherlock, “You’ve let me stay here all these months, pretending to look for my mother, when all along, she’s been right here?”
"I thought I was the only one who'd manifested any sort of teleportation power?" Sherlock asked, racking his brain for any instance in which John had indeed shown the ability of this power.
“Ah, right, Sherlock.” He hurried up the steps and Mary and Olivia hurried after him. They all ran into the flat to find Sherlock on the floor with Violet, trying to teach her how to hold her head up on her own and crawl.
There was no sign of his ridiculously long coat at all. He turned back, it was his time to go through security.
"More?" Sherlock scoffed, "I can hardly stand the people here now." Mycroft smiled ruefully at his brother as he lead Greg to a table.
(See the end of the chapter for
Luckily his attempts failed and after thirty minutes of trying to register whether or not their 'abilities' worked on their land lady, they gave up. Mrs. Hudson continued to behave like her normal self, no apparent changes, and Sherlock could not hear her thoughts. They sent her on her way, and she said she'd be back up to dust in a few, even though she was
"I'm sorry... Their names were also Sherlock and John?" The detective asked, almost incredulously.
"What were all those things you were saying?" Sherlock asked desperately.
"I'll call you!"
Once he'd finally agreed to put on clothes and met the man representing his client, things went a bit smoother.
. Sherlock suggested, John sent waves of approval Sherlock's way and they walked on. They walked to the shopping district, there were people everywhere, it being a few weeks before Christmas.
John nodded, sniffing as he looked down at their hands, both with matching silver rings. As he looked up, the minister pronounced them married, and they kissed. The spark of fire helping to confirm their union for no one but themselves.
"Yes and I pretended to know what you meant so that you wouldn't try to explain it to me." Sherlock replied, as though it should have been obvious, which, in all honesty, it should have. John internally scolded himself in that moment.
John told him and he backed off.
“Not to interrupt...” Mycroft said, “But I’m sure we can figure something out.”
"How did you-nevermind," John said, he and Sherlock exchanged a glance and then settled onto the small couch, their sides pressed against each other.
"This is..." He laughed slightly, unsure of what he meant to say.
"I haven't been trying anything," Sherlock laughed, "Should I? I already have increased awareness and observation skills. Do I need anything else?"
“Not yet.” John growled, “I have to see something first.”
John sighed, stepping back just in case the fire did spring to life again, not wanting to have his eyebrows scorched off. Sherlock wrapped a few fingers around the frozen fire, cupping it in his hand and turning around to John, holding it up.
"This isn't the lab." He said, annoyed and John laughed, pulling Sherlock in.
"No clue." Sherlock panted, "Feels good, though."
"Why?"
"Doesn't surprise me." John grinned widely across at his mate, "I should have known something would be going on here."
“So why have you come back?” John asked, his fists clenched so hard his knuckles were white.
