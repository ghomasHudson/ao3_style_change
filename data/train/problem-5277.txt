For the shit they were saying, especially Singer, neither of them seemed particularly upset about it. Dean snuck a glance at Lafitte, who looked a little more amused than his usual good humor, and Turner, who wasn’t trying to hide his laughter, and figured that was just how they were. Seemed like a lieutenant he could get along with better than Moncrieff, at least.
And if he’d thought that couldn’t get worse, he was proven wrong when Novak’s arm settled around the small of his back. There was no way Novak didn’t feel the way his whole body shuddered into the contact.
Dean drew in a deep breath. “
respond in the affirmative. Fingers scrabbled down the front of his shirt, struggling with the buttons.
“He gave you a car?” Dean repeated, then blew out a breath that could’ve been a sigh or a laugh; he wasn’t sure himself. “I guess he already gave you a house. Okay. I can do that. Be careful today, yeah?”
“Yes, sir.”
Billie shrugged, unconcerned. “Something explosive, probably. Takes a lot to get through these walls. Intentional or not, it’s not an active incident or they wouldn’t have let us on the road, and they’ll get it cleaned up soon enough. Happens a lot around here.”
“The question is, who is this, Castiel?”
It sounded like something Jimmy would not have wanted to do, but Cas did. “Sure.”
“Exactly,” Rowena had nodded at him. “Unless you can fix the system with your engineering genius.”
“Bitch,” Dean rolled his eyes, ambling over to where Charlie had her loot laid out on a tarp. “Hi.”
“You have no idea,” he answered.
He squeezed his eyes shut. He hadn’t seen any humans inside. He flung the panel shut with far more force than necessary.
“What?”
Sentinels, though—Dean had never run into that bullshit from a sentinel. Sure, a lot of them were assholes when it came to pretty much every interaction they ever had with another human being, but it wasn’t prejudiced dickishness. Even the ones who didn’t need dedicated guide partners appreciated what guides could do and their increasing scarcity.
In any other circumstances, Dean might’ve felt bad for the guy; his team had been all but conspiring against him by the sound of it. It wasn’t usually a sentinel’s fault when they zoned: they’d get so fixated on a single sense that they’d lose track of everything else, unable to break away from it. That was what they needed guides for.
When his phone rang on a routine night, he blindly fumbled around the nightstand and accepted the call without checking the caller ID. Barely conscious, he mumbled out a slow countdown, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
“Do you know how many cops they have? Because we don’t, but we know it’s a lot. And we know they’re all over.”
“Claire, Jack,” he murmured, shutting his eyes tightly and taking his first free breath. “I love you guys, but I might be choking to death right now. Just FYI.”
That’s TWO of my brothers
“Yeah, I’m gonna propose an alternate plan where you go fuck yourself.”
Dean fixed him with
“From what you . . .” Sam frowned. His eyes flickered between Cas and Rowena as he trailed off.
“Organization?” Cas demanded. “So it’s true?
“Since camp?”
They’re great, I’m really glad I’m getting a chance to meet them like this, but I definitely wasn’t prepared
His breath clogged his throat. “Cas.”
for reading this!
To the surprise of no one—possibly including Garth, though it was hard to judge over his unwavering cheer—no one took the bait. Undaunted, he explained, “It’s a great ice breaker!” and giggled at his own joke. He was the only one. Participation didn’t pick up from there, despite Garth’s best efforts, so Cas wasn’t forced out of what Balthazar later, very unfairly, classified as his sulk.
have to ration again,” Sam looked giddy at the thought. Dean could relate. He swung his feet off the bed and slipped his socked feet into his Space Runners, flexing his toes in the soothing warmth of the shoes.
It was a painfully tentative question. Dean nodded, then remembered Cas wasn’t looking. He knew that was a good thing, but it was hard to find his voice to say, “Yeah. It’s our team. Our friends, who are worried about you. We’re in a room with them right now, out in reality, and they’re trying to figure out how to help us.”
Castiel's Guide to Effective Parenting
“Can you take that right now?” he queried.
“Easy there, friend,” Ketch laughed. “My boss just fancies a chat. What with your recent . . . dealings, I’d say that’s perfectly fair.” The skimming drugs thing? The exposé? Yeah, he’d bet his ass the ‘chat’ was going to involve a lot of physical exertion.
I decided this shouldn't just live in the comments anymore.
Dean swallowed. His mind was filled with static.
The noise Novak made was probably thought or agreement, but it sounded close enough to a growl to send a thrill down Dean’s spine and other, even less helpful parts of his anatomy. He didn’t know what it was about Novak that made him feel like a desperate, undersexed teenager, especially when he hadn’t even been desperate and undersexed as a teenager. But the guy played his part like second nature, like he really did the leather top thing and took pride in doing it well.
“Assassin?” Sam’s eyebrows tried to become one with his hairline. “Like, a mercenary?”
And all of that so that Dean and the rest of Investigations, but more importantly the privileged and sequestered politicos running the country, could walk around freely. He didn’t even have to wear anti-scanning bands to keep his chips from being cloned.
Literally swaying in relief, Claire started down the hall, insistently tugging her father along like a kid in a grocery store. Contextually appropriate or no, it was adorable. “
For all that Cas pointedly ignored Dean on their four-hour flight, he didn’t need to be a guide to read the condescending judgment rolling off the man. Or a sentinel to see his exasperated scowl curve deeper and deeper every time Dean’s fingers clenched tighter around the armrests, as though Dean’s discomfort was making Cas suffer, too. That was just fine with Dean. In fact, he would’ve amped up his stress responses just to irritate the sentinel’s senses if he weren’t already riding the edge of panic—but he was, and holding that in was already all he could do.
“Aye, aye, Captain,” Claire mocked, tipping an imaginary hat.
(See the end of the chapter for
John had come back once. A while ago. Sam had been at school, Dean had come home for lunch. He’d turned a corner and come face-to-face with the father he’d never expected to see again. In the brief moment before he’d ducked back and out of sight, he’d caught the expression on the other man’s face. It hadn’t been paternal or warm. Not that he’d been expecting it to be.
Simmer The Plot Till It Reaches Desired Consistency
Novak shot him a pissy glare at that, but still didn’t actually say anything.
“Just show them,” Crowley interrupted, impatient.
Woodenly, Dean pressed a pouch of water into his hands, flicking the safety off. Cas gave him a small smile, cracked lips curving around the straw.
Caught up in how much he amused himself again, Junior missed the look Dean and Novak exchanged. They weren’t just moving into a mob house as the new pets of an impulsive murderer, they were about to occupy what was effectively a dead man’s house. The last pet’s.
In their bed away from the world, they hashed out all their remaining insecurities. Cas worried that Dean wouldn’t like his physical body with its cybernetic parts; Dean worried that he’d taken advantage of Cas when he was vulnerable after his zone and there wasn’t really anything there. They were both wrong.
to be?
Making nice had to wait because Dean didn’t have the patience, especially not with someone who looked like he’d rather be scraping crimson addicts off the street than shuttling Dean around. If Michigan even had crimson addicts and didn’t just forcibly relocate them all to Ohio like the rest of the wealthier states did.
Anna sold Cas out, that
“You don’t even know what you’re here for,” Balthazar replied airily, then stood and slung his backpack over his shoulder, just barely missing the face of a kid trying to walk up the aisle behind him. “But there other activities if you want to save your virtue for Mr. or Ms. Right. Or even Mr. and Mrs. Right, should the opportunity come along.”
His head snapped to the side in surprise, “You worked at NASA?”
The man laughed again. It grated on Dean’s nerves.
Maybe that was it.
“That’s not a bad thing. You know that, right?” Cas narrowed his eyes at her.
Dean hated space sickness. From the bottom of his heart, he hated nothing more than he hated space sickness.
“You got him?” Sam sounded faraway. But that was okay. Dean didn’t think that was directed at him.
Bobby chuckled, motioning for Sam and then unzipping the proffered bag. “Asters? Is this another one of your inside jokes?”
Part 1
Given how much Dean hated feeling useless—or even worse, like a liability—he wasn’t particularly fond of Novak for making him feel like that. He just wished his dick would get the message, because no amount of dislike made Novak any less painfully attractive. Even his condescension was something Dean could get off on; could imagine choking on Novak’s dick while the man looked down with his cold, disinterested eyes and critiqued his efforts. He’d say Dean could take it deeper if he really tried, if he wanted to keep getting to suck it instead of making Novak have to go find someone better. He’d say Dean looked good with a dick in his mouth, so wasn’t he lucky that he had someone willing to teach him to do it properly? He’d say Dean should show Novak how grateful he was if he wanted to keep getting his help.
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Condescension. Dean remembered basic training.
“Are you . . .” he trailed off, unsure of what to say. A wave of drowsiness washed over him. He shook his head clear, eyes flicking to Rowena, who looked suspiciously awake. “Are
“Let’s go, Earthlings,” Charlie called. Cas separated from him and the stifling black clouded his vision again. He shook his head involuntarily, eyes seeking light when he knew, logically, that there was none.
“Were you ever going to tell him about me?”
He turned, just in time to catch two very fast teenagers as they launched at him.
“Dean?” Cas’s unfamiliarly high-pitched voice trembled, a plaintive tremor in his tone that never would have made it through if he’d been in full control of himself. That worried Dean, but he told himself it was a good sign that Cas was functioning enough to recognize him. To talk to him.
Goddammit. He was hoping he’d be able to burn his.
When they got back inside the house, the kitchen was empty but a crumb-covered plate on the table suggested Sam had in fact fed himself. Dean grumbled as he cleared it away to the sink, then grabbed a couple of glasses from the cabinet above it. Good to know where those were. He filled the cups from a pitcher in the fridge, not the tap, handed one to Cas, and downed his own glass without taking a breath.
“Thanks, Mom.”
After that, it was just easier to drive over to Bobby’s for a beer, and then slide under a car in gratitude. And if he got paid for that, well. Nothing to look forward to at HQ anyway. Not anymore.
An irresponsible omission, in Cas’s opinion. If he’d known to brace for it, maybe Jody wouldn’t have caught him staring for so long that she asked, “Is everything okay, Jimmy?”
Sweet dreams, Cas ;)
“Hi,” Dean smiled widely at the soft look of annoyance. “Come here often?”
Dean’s head shot to Cas. Because that was a little . . . extreme. Everyone else apparently thought so too, but no one was feeling particularly sympathetic towards Anna in that moment. Still, no one protested when she gasped, “No! You can’t do that!”
Or he was dead.
“So . . . how’s aboutꟷ”
us.” And oh, Sam was back.
At the doorway, Charlie secured his tether around her waist multiple times. They looked like the weirdest set of conjoined twins.
He dropped his head, hair almost brushing Dean’s chin. He was close enough that he could smell the scent of the clinical shampoo they used, somehow still intact after three days of near-coma. “Meg.”
Despite their separation, he felt the palpable change in the air. Cas’s tone was much cooler when he responded, “Right.”
!” and squeezed the life out of her. Well, almost. Then he turned to Kaia and proceeded to hug the shit out of her too.
“No, you’re not. Come on, get off the floor,” Cas snapped, not harshly, insistently tugging him off said floor.
Hands gripped at him insistently.
“I need to call your dad.”
“Och, please. Like I want your fleshy insides in these gorgeous locks,” she flipped her hair over her shoulder. Dean paused. They were pretty bouncy, yeah.
. Says it right here on the business card.
“We’re going to do everything we can, ma’am,” he assured her before Cas could give voice to whatever was behind his tightening expression. “I’m NEI Agent Dean Winchester. This is my partner, Agent Castiel Novak.”
with them. What the fuck were those parenting books even talking about?
Leaning even closer, like above everything else it was the one big secret he was worried about, Jimmy said, “All I know about my dad is that his name is Chuck and he’s a writer.”
Leaning in just enough to play at friendly conspiracy without getting anywhere near uncomfortably close to Junior, Dean said, “Jimmy’s just a little particular about his personal things, you know? Didn’t even let me see his underwear drawer for a good six months.”
Holy fucking shit. They’d come to the Eagle trying to prevent a murder and had just got Junior Styne confessing to that same murder, and a second one too. As good as a confession, at least, if they could actually confirm the identities and the deaths. But they wouldn’t be able to do any of that from the bar, and couldn’t get the information out to the rest of the team right then, either. Since Novak was nursing his third double, Dean would probably have to be the one to remember all that.
So Cas said nothing, just smiled sheepishly, closed the door, and followed her around to the trunk. She had to shove aside a ballistic shield to make room for his stuff, but they got it to fit. And he understood why that was preferable to the back seat, when he got in the front and saw the metal bars that had been hidden by the tint of the windows. It seemed Balthazar’s advice had worked out, because Jody didn’t say anything more about it as she started the car and joined the line of people exiting the parking lot.
But the thought of that last one made bile rise in his throat.
Yeah, okay. She’d revived Cas. Twice. Possibly saved Sam from freezing in outer space. Been the best wing-woman a guy could have.
“Dean, are you still there?”
“Yes.” Cas wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“Jody’s awesome. And badass. And kinda scary. And also a total nerd, yes. But nerds are hot now, so don’t worry.”
For all his resolve to keep doing his job and doing it well, the whole point of Adler kicking him downstairs was that he didn’t think Dean could do it from there. And the shittiest part was that he might’ve been right. As far as Dean knew, despite Moncrieff‘s dramatic parting shot, no suicides had come out of the wiretap room since its creation. Neither had any arrests. But as far as he knew didn’t go too far, because he’d never bothered to learn anything about that unit.
Dean couldn’t help it; he laughed. Looking surprised, Cesar stopped talking, but before he could apologize for his rudeness, the woman who had been arguing interjected with an exasperated laugh of her own.
Both men busted up laughing half a second before a voice behind Dean grumbled, “They’re spindles.”
Further away, at the desks still littered with the remnants of the burgers that had started the whole thing, Charlie and Ash were buried in CS equipment and each apparently doing twelve things at once, by the way their fingers jumped around. They spoke to each other so quickly that Dean didn’t even try to make sense of the half of the words he understood.
He pouted all the way to his room. But before he could indulge in some premium sulk time, he landed face-first in his pillow. He was out before his pod door fully slid shut.
He’d love to say that he’d been the ideal doting husband during the ceremony.
A massive force sent him flying, crashing into the walls. His back screamed, equilibrium blown to hell. Gasping, he straightened up, turning back to where Cas had been.
“Shit!” Dean gasped as they halted, almost as abruptly as they’d started. He bent over, trying to catch his breath. “No fair . . . I don’t have the stamina,” he slapped his chest to soothe it, “to keep up with you!”
For some reason, that made Cas giggle. Dean stared at him a beat because he was pretty sure he’d never heard Cas
be reading into the gesture. Yes, Cas had other plants that weren’t gifted to him by Dean. No, Cas hadn’t brought
Three months later, Dean stood outside the hospital as they brought Sammy out, looking much better than he had since landing. The color was back in his cheeks and he looked like he had at least three meals a day. His hair had been neatly cleaned up so he didn’t just look like a beefier version of Harry Potter in Goblet of Fire.
After lunch, he went back up to Jimmy’s room to ’nap’ and shared his conclusion. Jimmy agreed, but only to a point.
Dean ignored what a good impression it was of someone who was about to shove him face-down on a bartop and show him what happened to dumbfucks who decided to get mouthy while flagging right.
“You think this’ll end with me?” Ketch choked, grinning maniacally.
“Oh. No, it’s—it’s all the same, more or less. I don’t know how I’ll react until you do it.”
Cas fled upstairs, feeling sick and done with the whole charade. It wasn’t just about him suffering for his crush on Dean anymore; he was hurting Dean with it, making Dean feel like he’d done something wrong when Cas was the one lying and making it all wrong. It had to end.
It still didn’t get better as Dean showed him how to thin out the grapevine shoots, because he was right there at Cas’s side, showing him how to decide which tendrils they wanted to keep and how to pinch off the others without causing damage to the plant, joking about how out of practice ‘Jimmy’ was. Even after he’d moved away, trusting Cas to do it right, Cas’s heart kept beating too fast and he felt far warmer than the morning temperature justified.
“Really, Dean? The whole point of you bringing them up was so Jimmy could eat them, not so you could hold them hostage.” The first one in the room, Mary shook her head at her son and rescued the plate of pancakes from his hands as he protested ineffectively. “Happy birthday, Jimmy. Here, I hope they’re not too cold.”
“Adler. Fuck! I knew he was dirty, but this?”
It was too much, too intense in that already intimate setting. Their relationship may have been more fake than anything Dean had ever lied about before in his life, but it didn’t feel it when Castiel was still holding him and looking at him like he mattered, and that was just as dangerous as anything else about their time undercover in the middle of Styne territory. If Castiel was going to take point on dealing with Junior, then the least Dean could do was keep his creeping feelings in check.
“Hey!”
The helmet.
“I’m fine,” Cas repeated firmly.
The next morning, Cas was already awake and dressed when Dean’s alarm went off—if he’d even slept at all. Dean pushed that thought aside as soon as it crossed his mind, but he was still annoyed at himself for considering it as a possibility however briefly. He refused to buy in to Cas’s superiority complex, even in the privacy of his own thoughts. Sentinel or not, cyborg or not, soulless or not, Cas wasn’t invulnerable. As he’d eventually find out, when his brain started leaking out every orifice it could. Just remembering the argument, how stubborn he’d been about something that the rest of the world knew to be true, made Dean’s blood boil.
He wondered how long Cas had been linking directly into the cyberscape, and particularly whether it coincided with his apparently new tendency to zone out.
“Delta, your Comms status is online,” the in-craft AI called, voice curling around the traces of an Irish accent. So, Gabriel’s tech wizardꟷ some kid fresh outta high schoolꟷ had not been kidding about being a Marvel guy.
The inside of the house lived up to the promises of the outside. It was like nothing Dean had ever seen, and he didn’t bother hiding it; Junior puffed up as he showed off the formal dining room and huge kitchen, the library-like office for Novak to “get all that math shit done, you know,” the fully furnished entertaining room complete with wet bar and massive gas fireplace.
It wasn’t a great time to realize he wanted that from someone. Not necessarily Novak. No, fuck that, definitely not Novak. That was asking for so many disasters it spiked his adrenaline just thinking about it. But having a real, steady relationship instead of random hookups. Someone he could trust to give it to him how he liked and not look down on him in the morning, who could live with the fact that he was always going to be his job with its stress and risks and long hours, who liked him enough to really want to keep him—
Cas closed his eyes and dropped his head into his hands. It was too much to take in. His dad had his fair share of eccentricities, maybe even more than his share, but Cas would never have believed him capable of such an earth-shattering deception. Not telling him about his mom was one thing—and from the way Chuck’s face crumpled and he had, in the past, turned to drinking whenever it came up, Cas had assumed his dad was just still heartbroken over the failed relationship. He’d thought that was why his mom couldn’t be around, or that she just hated the thought of being a mother and Chuck had protected him from her resentment by keeping Cas away from her.
“I think we’ve got at least three lives riding on it, including yours and mine. So you tell me what’s significant.”
It was like sawdust densely packed in air, wafting in and out of every fissure it could get into.
“He’s been at Kevin‘s all day, but he should get dropped off before we get home.” Glancing at the car clock, she smiled. “In fact, he’s probably already trying to steal samples and ducking Dean’s projectile spoons.”
Outwardly, Dean just moaned pitifully in response, sinking down against the door of his pod. He’d be darting back inside in ꟷ his throat convulsed ꟷ T-2 minutes anyway.
Dad sighed. “Yeah, okay. I don’t see you fretting about her leaving you at the altar. So . . . make sure she doesn’t have bags under her eyes?” Then, quieter, “I’ll go make sure my husband doesn’t kill the caterer over the placemats. I swear he wasn’t even this stressed about
They made it back in record time, much faster than the other way had taken.
“We’ll get through the gate.” Cesar’s statement left no room for doubt and Dean trusted that he would do whatever was necessary. They all would; the rest of the team had it handled, so Dean could leave it to them and focus on Cas.
The only thing that keeps him upright is the arm that wraps around his waist from the side and holds steady, even when his surprise makes him over-correct and stumble in the opposite direction. He’s pressed back against a firm chest just long enough for him to regain his footing, then he’s released and the heat of the other body moves away.
“And the rest of it? The stuff from tonight he might expect more of?” Dean had to ask, because maybe Novak could forget that Dean’s crotch was full of dried come, but Dean sure as shit couldn’t.
The old grump didn’t even wave back when Dean thanked him.
“He seems pretty docile,” Cas whispers back without breaking eye contact. He feels silly at the impulse; everyone around them is being much louder and clearly the bull doesn’t care, but he’s the only one being stared down at the moment. He’d rather come across as foolish than inadvertently do something to set it off.
There was a long silence on the other end. Then a drawn-out sigh, “Yeah, okay. Give him my number. I’ll see what I can do.”
“Quiet, you two,” Cas snapped. “Anna, did you just not
“Ten-four,” Dean agreed with a sigh.
“Nah. It’s not anything big, he’s just being Sam about it.”
“That ship sailed when your crew member here shot me.” The Brit snapped his fingers and suddenly, there was a circle of red beams surrounding them. It took Dean a minute to realize they were eyes.
“I’m fine,” he said. “Thank you, sir.”
If that had been the extent of it, Cas would’ve believed him. He put the second and third people to greet him specifically as they passed down to general friendliness and a welcoming spirit, even though Balthazar didn’t get quite the same reception. Maybe they could tell he was new, somehow, and needed the boost. When a girl standing by one of the larger trees looked directly at him and called, “Hey, Jimmy!” he assumed she was talking to one of the dozens of people behind him. But when another boy welcomed Cas back while calling him Jimmy—even he wasn’t that stupidly oblivious.
Cas groaned as he rolled off Dean and grabbed his discarded shirt, wrapping it around his waist like the world’s skimpiest towel. “Charlie. Do you need something?”
Novak tried to stare him down. Dean stared right back, not so much as blinking until he was sure Novak understood just how serious he was. He knew he wasn’t going to flinch first, but he doubted Novak would, either. It was a waiting game to see who would step between them and what they would do about it; who they would side with. The other two had been fine enough standing aside and letting Novak call the shots with whatever paranoid hazing the last weeks had been, but even if they didn’t know or care about him enough to fight over that petty shit—which he couldn’t hold against them, no matter how much it chafed him. They were just keeping their asses out of the line of fire between him and Novak, and they had more reason to back Novak.
He had their attention; Headphones had taken off his headphones and Ghost paused with only half his precious sticks cradled in his upturned palm. Louisiana was the one to break the silence again.
“Anything you’re looking forward to at the zoo?”
They were still holding hands, so Dean led Cas to the bed and they sat on the edge together.
“You ready to come back with me?”
“What was that, Bravo?”
“Yeah,” Dean answered for himself, “he is.” Cas’s reaction and tone undid the ease he’d fallen into; he was right back to where he’d been after their awkward start in the elevator.
Anxiety coursed through his veins like lifeblood. He shakily pushed off his feet and turned to the side.
“If I apologize,” he started, “will you deck me?”
“I think I cracked a few ribs,” Dean whispered back.
“Hey, Cas,” he said, still quietly. There weren’t many avatars around them, and no one seemed to care enough to pay attention to what looked like a panicked child being approached by a grown man in what could easily be a faked NEI uniform. It was the cyberscape, after all, and few people were who they appeared to be. Dean was, and Cas—he thought maybe Cas was, too, at that moment. “You had me worried.”
navigate to the right container.”
Novak’s arm tightened uncomfortably around him. It wasn’t the play they’d agreed on—the play Novak had decided on and Dean had gone along with for lack of any better options—but it seemed like the right angle for the kind of shithead who would call Dean a twink and threaten to spank him without giving a fuck what Dean or his supposed partner thought about it. He just needed Novak to take the hint and play along with it.
“Later,” Dean growled. “You think it’ll work? Great, I’m in, set it up.”
So he didn’t press Novak on his history at the Eagle. And Novak didn’t ask him about his, just went on explaining the plan with a hard tone and a look that said he was going to find a way to make Dean pay for forcing the issue.
He did know Novak. They weren’t at The Eagle. They were in the basement of the Chicago PD and they weren’t alone and Dean had been staring for way, way too long.
mood as he skipped into the mess hall twenty minutes later. That’s why he didn’t take offense when Sam started screeching about the sanctity of his ears and mind.
She pursed her lips thoughtfully, swallowing. She looked up and nodded solemnly. “This drink . . . I like it.”
Dean wouldn’t have been surprised to learn that Novak was the kind of guy who lived the job. No family, no friends, no evening or weekend plans. He knew the type—hell, he almost was the type, except he had Sam and Sarah and Judy to harass him into going out sometimes. Once a year they even visited and he spent a week pretending to hate how they dragged him to all the tourist spots. Of course he loved it, and they knew, and every time they’d try to convince him to move out to New York. Refusing was hard, especially when they played dirty and made him say it right to Judy’s sad little five-year-old face.
, yeah. And yeah, seriously.”
you really gotta hold still,” the other man warned. Cas pulled a face at that.
He turned to snap that he was feeling pretty fucking revealed, thanks very much, but just about swallowed his tongue in the effort when he actually saw the man. That was the final nail in the coffin of the worst operational plan Dean had ever been a part of, the moment he went from thinking it was a terrible plan to being absolutely sure he was going to die before the night was through.
Cas had moved on from the Nav, but he didn’t turn to acknowledge Dean, instead waving absently in his general direction. “Of course, Dean. Sweet dreams.”
They didn’t have a headcount, but the cell could only hold so many hounds. If two were dancing with Dean, one each with Sam and Cas, then . . .
Cas appreciates having a name put to the man almost as much as he appreciates Meg not saying anything else after it. He’s too busy being entranced by Dean Winchester preparing for his ride.
When she led them up to it, it was just as the state police had described: the scene was clean, well-organized. It looked like Kevin had packed up his belongings and left, but Linda insisted he would never have done so of his own free will without telling her. It was also highly suspicious that his chip hadn’t been scanned at all in that time, even by ambient surveillance that tended to catch anyone out in public. Either he was wearing blocking wristbands, which were illegal but not impossible for civilians to get, or he was off the grid entirely.
Well.
The barracks cafeteria looked so much like Kansas’s that Dean had a moment of disorientation—even the tables were bolted down in the same angled orientation, offset from the serving windows to increase visibility. But the jumpsuit uniforms were different and he’d never had implanted coolant tubes glowing dimly in his peripheral vision when walking in for a meal back home.
Dean just chuckled, taking another long drag of OJ.
“If I had to make an educated guess, I’d say a satellite galaxy, or several, perished within the core’s magnetic field. And that’s how the debris remains suspended. It’s slowly moving inwards. It’s quite an adventure, trying to navigate it without the experience the natives possess.”
Dean liked Junior ignoring him a hell of a lot more than Junior leering at him, but he forced on an extra special smile. And kept his mouth shut, at least so long as it seemed like Novak had things under control.
Sam made the rubber ducky sound again, “I guess we’ll just stick to ‘Cas’, then.”
Dean’s hair was as golden as the motes dancing in the air, his eyes as green as the leaves in the distance, his smile as bright as the sun.
The kid shrugged helplessly, “Okay, there’s literally no way to trace whatever ESP Cas is blasting into space, but I ran a couple of tests on like, all samples. Just need to get a couple more done.”
Dean pursed his lips and shifted his eyes for a brief moment. “It’s been alright.”
"Me? Well, long story short, my parents were adopting a kid and that kid was all the way out here. They came here, thought this city looked nice, and decided to move here." Cas explained, shrugging his shoulders. "It took a few months to get everything here, and none of my siblings really liked having to move. We all got used to this place after a few months."
“Red and black.”
“I’m not surprised.” Jo murmured, sitting in between the two of them, both of whom quickly laid their heads on her shoulders. She turned her face to the road. “Your house?”
from her as he set her back down on his bed.
“That’s a good idea.” Anna laughed, before finally bursting into laughter alongside most of the others. Even Crowley had started laughing, mainly because he loved whenever someone threw something at Lucifer. (He and Lucifer didn’t get along)
“Ready to face the day, Dean?” Sam asked, zipping up his backpack. He lifted his head and gazed at Dean, who rolled his eyes and groaned.
~~~~~
Anna’s eyes lit up. “Was it a guy or girl? Can you remember?”
Benny glanced at him. “Why would she do that?”
“Are you a freshman?”
Dean nodded, grabbing his school stuff. "Well, I'll see you around ten tonight."
“You didn't. I wasn't really asleep.” Cas replied, stretching a little. “But I am going to go to sleep, so goodnight.”
"I didn't know you had a brother." Cas remarked, tilting his head.
“Alright then. Go out to the car, I’ll be out in a second.”
Balthazar grabbed Cas’s shoulder and pulled him closer, grinning. “And, we can keep an eye out for
Sam turned to see the new transfer student looking at him with big brown eyes. “Yes?”
Gabriel sighed and nodded. “Alright. But make sure to add ‘High’ by Sir Sly. It’s a good song, good for dancing to.”
"If I get sick from eating then that's the price I have to pay." Dean commented with a mouth full of food. "It's better than going hungry."
As Dean pulled his clothes on, he heard a knock at the door.
Dean and Sam have a rough start to their days. Sam accidentally lets slip his ability to see colors, and Dean runs into Cas at the library.
It was surprisingly by time Gabriel, Balthazar, Castiel and Samandriel got home. Given how Lucifer had gotten home before them, they'd expected to hear some noise- but the house was relatively subdued and quiet.
"Hello, Dean." Cas remarked as he walked into the dorm. Dean sat up and waved.
“Mornin’ son.” Bobby spoke as Sam walked into the kitchen, a smile still on his face. Bobby turned and faced Sam, placing a plate of french toast in front of him. “Fixed breakfast for you and Dean. He up yet?”
~~~~~
“Alright. I’ll see Cas in 6th lunch. And you two,” Gabriel turned to face Samandriel and Balthazar, “I’ll meet you two back at my car after school. Alright, let's have a halfway decent first day.”
So back when I was originally writing this chapter, I didn't mean to make Dean fall this quickly, it just kinda happened. But this fic is a slow burn romance for a reason, and you'll see why.
"That's sweet Sam. Hey, listen, I actually have to get ready now, but I'll drive out to visit you this Saturday, okay?"
Cas soon found himself down in the basement, where there was a second array of snacks and a horror movie playing on the TV. There was a group of kids dancing drunkenly to the song that was playing on the first floor, including a tall boy with light hair and an attractive face. As Cas approached the group, the boy handed him a red cup and laughed drunkenly.
“I will Bobby,” Dean spoke, nodding, “I will. I’ll stop by again to eat lunch with Sammy.”
Dean stepped into the shower, sighing as the hot water poured onto his body. He loved the feel of a hot shower. He ran his hands through his hair, lathering it with soap and letting the water rinse it from his hair. After he washed his body and the soap was rinsed from his body, he stepped out into the cool, crisp air. It nipped at his skin, and he quickly wrapped himself in a towel to try and warm himself, protect his skin from the cold air.
As he descended the stairs, he got a view of the downstairs area. Arizona was napping lazily on the floor by the stairs, but jumped up when she heard footsteps and yelped at Sam. Sam’s eyes widened and he laughed as his feet made contact with the floor. He then ran up to Arizona and ran his fingers through her fur as she yelped happily and nipped at his fingers playfully.
Eventually, Sam won the brotherly spat and claimed the master bedroom as his own, taking his suitcase from Bobby (before thanking him for carrying it upstairs) and setting it by the door. Dean grudgingly took the slightly smaller bedroom, but he soon came to like it when he saw he had a much better view of the backyard and pool than Sam did- and a view that was perfect for watching the sunrise. He too took his suitcase from Bobby, thanked him for carrying it upstairs and then set it near the door.
Claire tilted her head and dispersed her grin. “Mom made your favorite- buttermilk chocolate chip waffles! She told us to come wake you up.”
Cas nodded. “That's two hours from now, so we should get ready. I’d recommend taking a shower.”
"What season of AHS is your favorite?" Cas interjected, breaking the silence and startling Dean back to reality.
Sure enough, as promised, Gabriel swung by the dorm exactly ten minutes later with breakfast. The three of them all ate the breakfast together, before Gabriel took off to his classes.
Gabriel rolled his eyes and folded his arms. “Don’t reveal my secret.”
“He’s the most entertaining of all the spanish teachers.” Balthazar explained. “What's your first class, Alfie?”
The house was completely empty- there wasn't any furniture, no trace of life or anything. No personalized touch anywhere. The realtor had told Bobby that the last inhabitants of the house moved out two years prior- and before they moved, they repainted the walls and removed everything.
“Do you know anything about this school?”
to sleep. He usually busied himself during the night with preparing for whatever cases they had or were working on. With the battle against Chuck looming in the distance, Cas had been fruitlessly racking through each book on the immense Bunker shelves. It didn’t matter how big the book was, how heavy or what language it was written in- an added bonus to being an angel, Cas’s mind happily supplied- he’d comb through it, searching for anything that might help them.
Dean’s alarm went off at exactly 8am in the morning the very next day. Dean, who had fallen asleep at 3 in the morning, groggily turned his alarm off before sitting up on the bed Bobby had let him sleep in. Dean stood up and began looking through the tiny amount of clothes he owned. He soon decided on a leather jacket, green jacket and black shirt, along with a pair of jeans. He patted down his hair, which was resembling that of a hedgehogs hair, and glanced at himself in the mirror. Other than his hair attempting to rebel against him, he looked just fine. Dean sighed and walked out into the kitchen, only to see no one but himself was awake yet. Dean grabbed a chocolate muffin to munch on before he began grabbing all of his stuff. Dean then suddenly realized he needed to take a shower, and he grabbed a towel out of the laundry room before he walked into one of the three bathrooms.
However, when he walked to his lunch table today, he saw a new kid, a girl, sitting next to Charlie, and the two of them were talking and laughing. As Dean approached the table, Charlie seemed to snap out of her trance, and she glanced at Dean.
Gabriel nodded. “Mhm. Now I can just watch the chaos, instead of being part of it.”
"I have to," Dean responded, shrugging his shoulders, "I don't have much money, and that and a librarian are my only ways of getting money right now. Well, other than my family friend, but I don't like to burden him."
Once the song finished, Cas and Balthazar blew out their respective candles, to a loud applause. Once the applause ended, Becky cut a large slice for both boys and handed them their plates first. Jack and Gavin got theirs second, mainly since Gavin was yet to fully grasp that when it wasn't his birthday, he didn't get cake first and wasn't being celebrated.
"Hm?"
Cas shrugged his shoulders. “Well, it still looks really good. Thanks mom.”
“Alright, when’s this party start?” She questioned, turning to face Dean.
“When have you ever said no to food?” Charlie spoke with a grin. Dean smiled and huffed a little, before he sat down in the Impala and stuck the keys into the ignition. He drove to the very same Five Guys he and Cas had visited just an hour prior, where Charlie got herself a burger and so did Dean. The three of them sat at a window table, talking and laughing. The next two hours passed by quickly.
Sure enough, the boy managed to help Dean. Chemistry might not have been one of Dean’s worst subjects, but Cas seemed to know way more than Dean could have ever dreamed. By the time Dean had completed his worksheet, the boy was already helping him with another paper, explaining things to Dean that he had never understood before. Dean was blown away by the boy’s knowledge;
Cas turned to face Dean, the end of his lips curving up only the slightest bit. “Alright. Let's get along.”
~~~~~
Cas turned and grabbed his keys, acting as though he hadn't heard the statement. He gazed over at Dean and cocked his head in the direction of the door. “You ready?”
"I definitely wouldn't have thought of him as a business major." Dean remarked.
Jo shook her head and took a bite of her lunch. Benny took a glance as well, but he didn’t recognize the girl either.
“No need to thank me boy. You just make sure to eat well from now on. And you’re coming to stay with me while your brother attends college.” Bobby explained, as Sam pulled away in shock.
Every second, every word was like a homing dart biolocked onto his heart. “Well, uh. You zoned and it brought you here. And I’m here to bring you back, so are you ready to try and get out of here?”
“Cas, maybe we shouldꟷ” Gabriel started, hesitant. But apparently Commander Cas wasn’t in a listening mood. He shut up his second-in-command with a raised hand. Gabriel shrugged at Dean, as if to say, ‘I tried’.
“Be that as it may,” Sam started. “You could still use a refresher.”
And no way to regain said control.
The wiretap room was, technically speaking, part of the Organized Crime Division. On paper, the chain of command was clear; the technicality came from the fact that they wanted about as much to do with the lepers in the basement as the rest of the Chicago Police Department. Two weeks in and Dean had no idea who his new lieutenant was or how much supervision they got—though that fact was kind of an answer in itself.
Of course, it didn’t come to that. Junior took one last look around the main hall of the first floor and declared, “I got some shit to take care of, so I’ll leave you fellas to settle in. You sure you don’t want my movers? They’re a good crew, won’t give you any shit.”
But I’m not ready to go home yet. Aren’t you having fun?
“You decent?”
Dreams in space were always weird. Cas used to say it was the artificial gravity. Sam just called them weird, because apparently, Sam didn’t
“You gonna be ready for breakfast in a couple minutes, or want us to wait a bit longer?”
Sam’s whoop interrupted their celebratory kiss. Accompanied by Jack and Claire’s exaggerated gagging.
“Shut up, Anna. You have no emotions; you don’t get to talk,” he reminded, turning back to Cas with his own version of a pleading look. Cas, who’d grown up with several other individuals orphaned early in life, wasn’t fazed. He wasn’t a stone-cold bitch about it like Anna was, but he wasn’t budging either.
He shamelessly groped Cas as the other man spilled inside him, screaming into his lips. Then his breath punched out of him as Cas collapsed, boneless, on top of him. Complaining, he turned, dropping the other man onto the bed beside himself. Head resting on Cas’s heaving chest, he traced his fingers up and down the dip over his sternum.
Cas met Dean’s eyes over his daughter’s head. Then he said softly, “Claire . . .”
A gay man and a lesbian get married. In that order.
. Shit, there was literally no way he was separating these kids. Sam caught his gaze. They were both of the same mind.
Cas gave him a gentle smile, “I know. That was your reward.”
“Come on,” Gabriel stopped his imminent trip down a very dark, potentially delusional road. Cas turned to him, questioning. “You’ve earned a slice of pie. Kali has one in the oven.” Cas bit his lip, because if this was Gabriel’s idea of a clever reveal . . . “Oh,
If Cas had ever felt more like an asshole in his life, he didn’t remember it. Dean had barely had a second to breathe after opening up to what he thought was his stepbrother about feeling comfortable in a special place, then Cas went and ruined it.
I’m just not prepared to deal with this
“You don’t need to mansplain shit to me, ass-kisser.”
Dean liked wood fireplaces. His parents’ house had had one and he’d loved playing with it as a kid. He remembered afternoons helping his dad chop logs and stack the pieces on the wood pile, countless winter evenings learning the best ways to arrange firewood and newspaper so the entire living room was warmed by the glow. He’d talked Sam and Sarah out of going with gas when they renovated their townhouse, even built them a little shed in their postage-stamp backyard to keep their wood seasoned, and he didn’t think Judy ever loved her uncle more than when he was visited and passed on some of the art of fire-making that his dad had taught him.
There was an odd pause after he reached ten.
Bro-in-law didn’t get to defend his honor as Cas’s came jogging along.
clean, too used to the feel of water on his skin to reach that stage.
With a final acknowledgement, the line disconnected. Turner and Lafitte stared at each other; Novak stared at the speaker. He’d gone still about the same time Dean had.
“Thanks, dad,” they both replied, hugging him right back. As each of them pulled away, they were engulfed in hugs by their siblings- first Lucifer, who nearly made Cas pass out; second by Gabriel, who thankfully wasn't as hyped up on sugar as he usually was; thirdly by Anna, who actually shook both of them; and eventually by all of their siblings, even Raphael, who gave an awkward nod to both of them in the process.
“My head is killing me. Do you have aspirin?”
Dean looked somberly at Bobby, realizing Bobby was referencing his own soulmate, whom he had lost a few years prior due to illness.
By time that Cas descended the stairs, the yelling had stopped. When he got to the kitchen, he saw Gabriel sitting at the kitchen bar, a scowl on his face as he drank a mug of water and toyed with a fork. Lucifer stood a few feet away from him, arms crossed as he watched Gabriel accusingly. Apparently, Gabriel had been refusing to wake up and get ready, so Lucifer had apparently dragged Gabriel out of bed and was forcing him to have breakfast- an odd sight, but yet again, nothing Cas hadn't seen before. Lucifer dragging Gabriel downstairs to breakfast was, oddly, an all-too-common sight in the Novak household.
Jo almost fell out of her chair. “You’re fucking kidding.”
"Yes."
“Oh, probably the party.”
Benny waved and walked off to find Kevin, leaving Sam and Dean alone at the front of the house. Before Sam could even say anything, Dean waved at him, remarked a simple “I’m gonna go find the snacks,” and was off, leaving Sam alone. Sam grumbled angrily at being left alone, before he walked off towards the quietest corner of the house he could find- which happened to actually be in the foyer.
That was the moment that Bobby chose to walk out of the kitchen, rubbing his hands with a towel. “What’s this I hear about a soulmate, Dean?”
Dean climbed into Bobby’s car and the two of them took off to the nearby grocery store. When they walked inside, Bobby insisted Dean get anything and everything he’d need for college life for the next month. Dean gathered a bunch of snacks, such as cookies and chips. He also got lots of hamburger meat, ramen and pasta fixings, and lots and lots of bacon. He then got some salad fixings for Sam, and proclaimed he was done. Bobby insisted on paying for it all, all $250 of it.
"Do you wanna watch anything on the TV?" Dean asked, and Cas tilted his head in thought.
Whenever they had asked him why he cooked so much, he’d smile and just say that it was something to remember his wife by.
“Big bro’s orders.” Balthazar sighed, grabbing a box of Chips Ahoy. “You know how batshit he gets over this party.”
“Charlie! Hey, this is my brother, Sam. Sam, this is Charlie, who I met this morning.”
Dean and Cas talk a bit more. Meanwhile, Dean meets Charlie and Sam makes a new friend
Perhaps he shouldn’t have allowed his first kiss to be when he was very drunk and definitely wouldn’t remember it, but he had long thrown rational thought out of the window, and so he moved his lips in sync with the boy and closed his eyes.
After finally finding a place to park, Dean and Cas made their way to the mall entrance. They had parked near the JC Penny’s, per Cas’s request. Cas had said that JC Penny was the first stop on his list. When they walked into the store, however, Cas paused and stopped Dean.
"Hey, do you want anything for breakfast? My brother's gonna stop by the dorm with food in a few minutes." Cas offered.
“What’s all this yelling?” Came a voice, and Balth, Cas and Anna turned their heads to see Gabriel coming down the stairs, yawning and rubbing his eyes.
And that was it. With five simple words, Castiel fell apart. He leaned forward without even thinking, grabbing Dean’s face in his hands. When their lips met, it was everything Cas had ever wanted and more. It was love, it was passion, it was sadness, it was peace. It was their twelve years of memories cascading through both of them into one giant pile.
The morning of November 21st started out normal for Dean, at least until he saw Cas, still asleep, trembling underneath his covers. Dean tore the sheets off of Cas and shook him awake.
“It’s over here boy,” Bobby remarked, sticking his head out from the kitchen, where he was fixing breakfast, “Bad hangover, I’m guessing.”
“It's nice to meet you two,” said one of the boys, a shorter one with dark hair, “my name's Kevin.”
“Like I said earlier boy, there's no need to thank me.”
“I’m not sure. I know there's at least eight, but I heard a ninth sibling started this year. I don’t pay a ton of attention to them.” She cocked her head again, her eyes glancing around the cafeteria. “I should pay more attention, though. They're an interesting family from what I’ve heard.”
Cas ended up sitting down next to Jack, who was near the end of season 2 of his show. Samandriel caught interest and sat down on the couch as well, watching the TV eagerly.
It quickly made sense to them why there were so many cars- the house was full of people, all talking and laughing and dancing at a volume level that surely would call for a noise complaint in an instant. It was a surprise the police hadn’t been called yet.
He began unpacking his things, putting the blankets Bobby had bought him on his bed. At 10 that morning, not too long after Dean was fully unpacked, a knock came at the door. Expecting his roommate, he opened the door to see a boy standing there.
“I won't be able to buy much, but sure.” Dean murmured, making no effort to move off of the couch. Cas exhaled a little and held out his hand, and after a few blank seconds, Dean took it. Cas pulled Dean up and Dean stumbled for a brief second before standing steady.
Jess gave a nod and then took out her phone- the teacher had already said that phones were allowed, only if you finished all your work. Seemingly sensing that Sam was slightly off, she pulled up her instagram and flipped to her saved videos. “Here, since we’re both done with our worksheets, I wanna show you something.” As Sam (and Andy) glanced at her phone, Jess proceeded to play a few videos of some cute and clumsy dogs, all while Sam began to smile even more. He ended up leaving his second period in a much better mood than when he had arrived.
While Cas changed, Dean changed into clothes from his drawer, then took the time to run his hands through his hair and fix it up a little. Cas emerged from the bathroom less than a minute later, dressed in his usual trench coat, suit, dress shirt and black pants. Dean gasped in awe a little, then turned his face to hide from Cas's sight.
doing for you right now.”
If Dean didn’t get his fucking libido under control—well, he’d already shown he couldn’t. But if he couldn’t suppress it, at least he could channel his sexual frustration into something else. Like using it to back up his non-sexual frustration.
Without breaking out of Novak’s hold, Dean turned his head the opposite way to look in the direction of the stairs. He understood and shared Novak’s surprise, the panicked moment of everything going to shit at once with no forewarning.
“I’m sorry. I need your help.”
They came up in one corner of a large, open space that mostly looked like it could’ve been any other decades-old bar in the city. Red brick walls, dark wood that was worn but not run down, a decently sized service counter taking up half of one wall to their left. But most bars didn’t have a couple bootblack stations next to the bartender, or a pillory set far enough from another corner to allow a crowd around it, or a guy laid flat on a table with all the chairs pushed away around it so five other men could take turns railing him and choking him on their dicks.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Your generosity knows no bounds, Sammy. Don’t act like you’re blameless here, you’re the one who was holding everything up in the first place!”
“Team, this is Delta. What the hell’s going on?” he groused, maneuvering himself to his pod’s entrance. The headset crackled like a walkie-talkie. The response came through overlaid with the same noise. “What? I can’t . . . there’s too much static on the line.”
They turned to leave, but Claire stopped them. “Wait, there’s someone else.”
The music segued smoothly. She held her breath.
“No,” Cas answered quickly, forceful but also visibly uncomfortable. “He used to work with my aunt. He was involved in some of my augmentations before he assumed the presidency.”
He was just recalibrating the boosters when Sam slipped into the control room. “I don’t wanna hear it,” he mumbled quietly.
But most importantly, Dean felt that tug behind his ribs that he hadn’t found in the aesthecosm. More than a tug—it was a desperate ache in his chest, like something had hooked straight into his heart and was trying to tear free. Without stopping to think about it—without needing to think about it—Dean started moving in the direction of the pull. Slowly at first, but even as he was moving toward it the feeling grew stronger, the pain sharper, and before long he broke into a run. False forms appeared and disappeared around him, fantastical avatars of giant trees and anthropomorphized animals and whatever mess of parts was someone’s particular kink, and Dean ignored them all as his pace grew more frenzied.
He seemed so sincere about it that Dean had to laugh again, but it made him feel better about the whole situation, so it was a much easier laugh. “Not even a little,” he confirmed, then held his hand out with a smile. “Dean Winchester.”
long since he’d heard a real one. He froze.
Lafitte smirked, understanding the crude joke immediately and lifting the cards he still held in an ironic salute. Much as Dean appreciated the show of solidarity, the real payoff came from seeing Novak jerk in surprise. Viciously, Dean hoped it messed up all his careful work and he’d have to start all over again to fix whatever scratches he left in the wood. If he had done any damage, Novak didn’t show any frustration over it; he did set the piece down, though, and stared at Dean.
“How did I survive? Well, all it took was a little magic and a very powerful orgasm,” she smirked. Dean winced, very,
“It’s extreme, even for a sentinel. Skin-to-skin contact with another person can sometimes be unbearably intense.” He looked away as he said it, bright eyes dropping down and to the side, shoulders creeping up with nerves.
“What the hell are you—”
“I don’t remember you coming home, either,” he said.
“But that was my call, not theirs,” Cas frowned at her.
“Hello?” he rasped, sitting up, managing to wrestle the comforter off himself.
He’d finished setting up the boosters for 240 minutes when ASTERIA summoned him to Rowena’s old quarters. Dean steeled himself, preparing for the worst.
I know
He levelled another look at his surrogate dad as he shooed the old man telepathically. It took a hot minute and then Bobby was departing with a grumble. Dean rolled his eyes exaggeratedly. Cas snickered into his shoulder.
It was still too dark for his human eyes, so he pressed his head back against the helmet, swallowing back his nausea. Behind him, he could hear the non-humans puttering around, powering down the barrier and giving the humans space. Sam was bent in half, his CommsBud dangling from on hand, helmet from the other. Almost reminiscent of hungover Sammy after his graduation party at Harvelle’s.
“I’ll get the rack,” Benny called sheepishly.
They were both tucked in nicely in the aftermath, trading lazy kisses, when someone started beating down on the door like the house was on fire. Cas groaned.
So it was up to Dean to bite the bullet and prove he was useful. “’Cause Junior ain’t got a mistress,” he said. It came out pretty well. “Eagle’s a queer bar.”
“It’s not dumb.” That came out too loud for the peaceful space, for how close they were standing, but it was better than Dean insulting himself. “I know exactly what you mean. It’s not just about where you live. Some places have something about them that just speaks to you. Makes you feel more like yourself than you even knew you could be.”
No, but he might want to have sex with Cas
Dean physically jolted, blurting out assurances, “Yeah, yeah, I’m right here. I just . . . don’t know what to
“See you in the next galaxy,” he said.
He wasn’t dead and he wasn’t fired, though his sudden reassignment was as close as Adler could get without running afoul of the union. As long as Dean had his badge, he’d use it to be as big of a pain in Adler’s ass as he could. All he had to do was real police work. Fucking up Adler was just a handy bonus.
Of course
“Now,” Novak said, wobbling it a bit like the alcohol was finally catching up to him, “now wait, hold on. It’s, it’s very late. And I owe Dean a very hard fucking that I haven’t decided if he gets to enjoy. I’d like to see to that in my own bed tonight. Can we meet you in the morning? If I’m quitting my job, I don’t have anywhere else to be.”
Setting up his cyberscape conduit took less than a minute, since his gear was all still configed from the day before. Glasses on, wristbands on, and in no time he was linked in with no trouble at all. Kevin’s server looked the same as it had, other than the absence of Channing’s shadowy avatar. Despite her promise to monitor the server, Charlie’s wasn’t there to replace it; there was no one else in the constructed room when he connected inside.
The car slipped away quietly, sinking into the underground tunnel in moments. Beside him, Sam exhaled loudly.
It felt like hitting metal—and maybe it was, beneath the layers of skin and augmented muscle fiber. He didn’t know how much of Cas’s skeleton had been reinforced or even replaced, but it was solid enough that Dean’s fist connecting with the side of his face only snapped his head to the side, and even that was brief. He recovered his posture before Dean, who was left cradling fingers that might have been broken, feeling like three kinds of idiot and no less angry for it.
just give us two hours of free time without any danger of a cockblocking Chewbacca. That’s a lot of brownie points in my book.”
“Fuck!” Cas hissed, fingernails raking down Dean’s back.
“Hm?”
The man in Dean’s grasp recovered from that shock faster than Dean did—faster and smoother than it seemed like any reasonable person should. Tugging himself away from Dean, but only taking a single step out from between him and Cas, then raising his hands in deference to show he was stopping there, he introduced himself as Fergus: “A concerned neighbor, you understand.”
He was willing to consider that. "Which song?“
The man didn’t stop—of course he didn’t—but Dean was nearly on top of him, only a house and a half away from where they’d started. He shifted his shoulders, just about ready to launch into a tackle, when something dropped down in front of the man and he stopped so suddenly that Dean crashed into him after all—just in a much less controlled manner than he’d intended. Swearing and grabbing the man, both as a counterbalance and to stop him from doing anything while Dean was off-balance, Dean barely managed to keep himself from tumbling to the pavement.
“Yeah. But he’s kind of a badass.”
“That’s what I said,” an ethereal voice hummed. The humans looked beyond Charlie as the air seemed to shift. Stevie (for lack of a direct translation), Charlie’s wife, materialized.  An umber black arm curled around the redhead’s pale one. “Hello, Earth humans.”
Was that irony?
Dean rolled her eyes at her, “No shit.”
. He let Cas rearrange him, leaning against the other man’s strong thigh. His head fell back onto a shelf of shoulder and his heart swooped into his gut.
“We don’t have much,” Novak said.
He calls Cas a lot of things when they fight:
“Kinda messed up for a drop-off point, don’t you think?”
He woke to the ship docking. A quick fumble with his tablet revealed that they were still, in fact, in CR7. A sudden tremble permeated his form as he realized what that meant.
carved inside a border of intricately detailed trees. When Cas looked closer, admiring, he even saw the hindquarters of a deer peeking out from behind a trunk in one corner.
It was a beautiful day.
“Good,” Sam responded, slowly. There was a soft clink in the background. Probably a steaming cup of organic, fair-trade, no-leaves-were-harmed-in-the-making-of-this herbal tea. Sam had always been into that hippy-dippy yoga crap. “And, how are you?”
“An hour ago?” Sam piped. “And you’re just telling us now?”
“Nah,” he smiled to soften the blow. “I don’t think he’s feeling up to company right now. Just give him some space, okay?” Cas grimaced but he nodded. “You get the
Cas showered, brushed his teeth with his own toothbrush that he’d brought from camp, and changed into clean clothes, then went back downstairs to join the Winchesters for a late lunch. The tasting room had a scheduled half-hour closure, so even Mary was there. Jody, still at work, wasn’t.
Maybe it would bring them luck, having a pretend home they cared about inside the pretend home that might get them killed.
Nothing but silence.
“And that's why I told Cas not to put the codependent kin together on this mission,” Anna had slipped her chaperones. In front of him, Cas suddenly looked very alarmed.
“Welcome back, jerk,” Sam grinned, standing over his prone form. The nice cloudy feeling evaporated, leaving only utter disdain for shitheads that moonlighted as little brothers.
“Well. See ya on the flipside,” Sam called. “Cas. Jerk.” The engine started to whine.
Dean felt a bubble of hysteria rise in his throat. “Yeah,” he laughed. “That’s one way to put it.”
Dean cracked an eye open, "Will you?“
“You don’t think they’ll spook that Channing’s gone?”
I’m not sure there’s a way to prepare for all of them, haha
“Mm-hm,” Bobby nodded. “So you boys better call me every hour until you zip outta range! Now go settle in before Cas hijacks the damn spaceship,” Bobby smirked, tapping the bill of his ratty hat in farewell. “Idjits.”
No one did.
“They oughta have two,” Dean challenged, still feeling punchy. “Fire code and all.”
!” Cas shouted. Before Dean could blink, the man was out of his arms and crossing the distance to the bars. Dean waved Sam over. He could see Cas’s fingers shaking as they tried to hack into the digital lock.
, Dean! There are kids around!” Sammy shrieked across the hallway.
(The tie made an excellent gag as well.)
“I have no idea when we started it. It feels like forever,” he shuddered out a breath. “I wanted to finish it before we returned. In case it was close to Christmas when we did.”
Kaia, for her part, was staring at the three of them, wide eyed. “Am I hallucinating right now?”
“Yes,” Balthazar called back, and Gabriel chimed, “Right on!”
“Hey, Benny! We’re having some problems with the oven again, and in the middle of my dinner party. My boss is even there, you know, Mr. Adler? It’s so embarrassing.”
“See that?” she was talking to Cas. He nodded slowly. “That’s where your children are.”
He swallowed against the thick silence, broken only by Dean’s harsh breaths and Cas’s infinitesimally softer ones. "Cas . . ." his voice hitched and he broke off.
“Shh . . .” Dean pecked him on the lips, sneakily wiggling into position to lead. “If you don’t stop criticizing my music choices, I’m gonna tie you up tonight.”
“The size of what?” Charlie muttered at Dean. He waved a hand at her in the universal ‘tell ya later’ gesture. She pursed her lips grumpily.
“That would be awkward. You think there’s a significant risk of misidentifying them?”
Cas pursed his lips as if pondering some great, philosophical question. "No. I don't think I will."
“You’re gonna get an ugly sweater,” Jack informed her gleefully. “It’s going to be scratchy and indestructible.”
They spent the rest of the drive in a charged, hateful silence that carried them all the way into the secured garage and up to their unfortunately shared room. Cas made it inside first, but Dean pushed past him—ignoring the fact that it hurt his shoulder and didn’t really move Cas at all—and shut himself in the bathroom. He’d initially just planned to take a piss and brush the bad tastes of the day out of his mouth, but when he saw that they had a halfway decent shower, he changed his mind.
The avatar waiting there—wherever it was Cas had taken them, it wasn’t the server they’d met Channing in—looked just like the pictures of Kevin Tran; he wasn’t hiding himself behind any of the more fantastically unrealistic forms that were so popular. And though he did seem to be waiting, it clearly wasn’t for them, because when Dean and Cas appeared in front of him uninvited he swore up a startled storm.
“It’s not about the money.” Novak studied them, studied Dean like he was deciding if he could say what he was thinking. Whether or not it was what he originally planned, what he said was, “I don’t sell as much as you seem to think I do. Not like I could eat from it. I make them because I enjoy the work, and I sell them when I run out of people I like to give them to. But I don’t like repeating myself and I have absolutely no patience for cleaning up after someone else’s tantrums.”
Dean led him over to what Cas would’ve called a cellar, except that it was its own building almost halfway across the property from the house. It was also at least partially above ground, but completely windowless; the only light inside came from the open doorway, then from a line of bulbs hanging down from the ceiling that looked industrial but also dim and yellowed. He wasn’t sure if that was an aesthetic choice or a necessary part of the process, and he also wasn’t sure if he could get away with asking or if that would be so obvious that Jimmy would’ve known the answer the past for six years.
If he was going to have to go in blindly, he figured he could at least start with the easiest option and hope that didn’t mean walking into an unmarked women’s restroom or something; not that it was likely to see any use down there. Easily juggling his box in one arm, he tried the handle of the closest door and found it locked. So was the door to the left.
“That is so sweet of you!” Dean filled the words with as much of their own sweetness as he could without choking on them.
Dean clenched his fists tight enough that his knuckles hurt. “Well, sure. You all fired up to prove you’re tougher than the average nerd, want to get out there and swing your… paddle around? Don’t let me stop you. But tell you what, you just remember that if things get hairy in there—and I don’t just mean the guys who look like Lafitte—I’m gonna be the one bailing your ass and the stick up it out.”
“Hey,” Cas barked at him. “None of your beeswax.”
So Dean did; he set his palm carefully to the back of Cas’s neck, snaking it under the tubes so that it was all skin on skin, and focused on limiting Cas’s sense of taste as Cas took the first bite of his burger.
Or maybe Dean’s initial speculation had been right after all, and the guy wasn’t a guy but a highly specialized—and probably experimental—android of some kind. He’d find out sooner or later, though he suspected he’d have to wait at least until someone else got involved, since his current host wasn’t offering up any information.
They made their apologies to Mrs. Tran and Dean got behind the wheel again without asking or giving Cas the opportunity to protest. From the way Cas was rubbing his forehead as he looked out the window, he might not have even tried to argue.
. If it wasn’t for Dean, she’d be terrified about moving away and leaving Dad and Jack to fend for themselves. “It’s
It took all Dean’s concentration to keep that scene from taking up all his concentration. He was only stealing enough glances to keep it believable, or trying to at least, but he knew he gave away too much of his hidden hunger every time he did. There was nothing he could do about that, didn’t know how to stop it even when he caught Novak looking at him with the same subtle consideration he was giving the rest of the men. And fuck it, he was just playing the role Novak had required of him, right? Even if Novak could tell it was more than just acting, he’d never be able to prove it.
They dropped Dean into the cyberscape at the nearest server hub, which was close to where Charlie had lost track of Cas’s ping. In the press of crowded avatars, bright lights, and busy noises, he worried even more about Cas and his overstimulated senses. It was a terrible environment for him to be in.
Dean huffed, throwing an arm around the other man’s shoulder and steering them to the door. “I’ll get you that meeting. Don’t you worry, crackhead.”
He squeezed his eyes shut, nodding firmly against Bobby’s shoulder. He swallowed, though his voice wasn’t nearly as steady as he’d been aiming for when he mumbled, “’Course. I’ll see you soon, old man.”
"Tellin' you; I really, really will," Dean informed him urgently.
Dean huffed, “Morphine.
By and large, sentinels were dicks. He didn’t know for sure that the guy was a sentinel, but chances were decent. NEI had a higher percentage of sentinel agents than the population average; even higher than the per capita on paraesthetics overall. The eye implants weren’t a definite giveaway, since they could’ve just been standard vision, but anything above that would be impossible for a regular human to process without overloading. Ditto for the enhanced hearing—either it was a natural sentinel trait or an augmentation that risked overwhelming non-sentinel senses.
End of the road.
Sam and Dean are sitting at the table, backs to us.  One last conversation.  I don’t know what it’s about, you can figure that out.  But at one point they do the “bitch” “jerk” one last time, before the camera tracks in and focuses on SW and DW against a table full of love and family.
And that’s when Rowena shows up.  Something about Queen of Hell privileges' allow visitation hours once in a blue moon.  Literally.  She can only visit on a blue moon.  But it’s nice they get to catch up.  She thinks she’s found her son.  She seems excited to try again.  Dean and Sam look at one another.
Sam and Dean have their little heart to heart moment at the trunk of the car.  One of them says “what’s next?”  And the other says “oh, there will always be work for us to do.”
Sam walks in from the right, different clothes.  This is a new day.  Time has passed.
Sam is already there.  We see that they are parenting books.  Another hand reaches out to grab one of the books.  It’s Dean.  Of course Dean is gonna be there for his niece and/or nephew(s) what the fuck are you talking about?
They are walking down the bunker steps, but the camera is moving clockwise.  They are bantering about something stupid.  Like cholesterol.  Or rabbit food habits.  They walk off the screen to the left as the camera keeps panning to the right.
Then the lighting changes again.  It pulls out and the bunker is as lively as ever.  There’s an old woman sitting over an old book.  Someone calls her Aunt Claire.  Time marches on.  Hunters keep on fighting, the table stands as a monument to a legacy bigger than Sam and Dean.
“To Bobby!” Sam says, holding up a beer.  “To Bobby!” The crowd agrees.  Dean is holding a little girl, two or three years old.
As Dean settles into one of the chairs ready to do some research, we see the book title is something to do with “Recovering from Childhood Trauma.”  Cas walks by, non trenchcoat.  Jeans and a flannel.  He runs a hand along Dean’s shoulders and Dean smiles, turning his head and watching Cas take the frame as the camera keeps moving around clockwise.
Dean smirks at Jo, who’s awkwardly hanging around and not doing the same slow ritual of leaving the party as the rest of the people in the hallway, clearly going to stay for an exclusive afterparty with the birthday girl but acting like she isn’t.
The point of it all is that there’s this security and stability that Dean’s never really experienced before. There’s Cas who
“He’s three, give him time”, Dean chuckles. There’s a second of silence where they just stare at each other. Cas thinks if should say something, but Dean gets up.
Something drops to the garage floor, making a loud bang and Cas is up on instinct, making his way downstairs to tell him to shut up.
“But I roll around all night, you won’t be able to sleep.”
There’s water falling down on Cas’s face as he urgently meets the kisses Dean gives him, moaning against his lips when Dean’s hand travels up to his hair, pulling it a bit.
Cas wants to point out that Meg is literally making this place unsuitable for them if the flirting goes any further, but there’s enough drama going on in his own life right now for him to start that conversation.
Dean makes his way to the bathroom when Cas returns. He goes through his nighttime routine without thinking about it, sitting on the toilet seat while he brushes his teeth, staring at a picture of him and Sam as kids, that Bobby has hanged up on the wall. Sam’s missing his front teeth, smiling a wide, toothless smile. Dean looks at himself wearing a cape made of a bedsheet, thinking again how long it's been since he’s been back here, at home.
“I’m sorry, do you want to feed him?” Cas spins around to roll his eyes at Dean, but the annoyance is mixed with something else when his eyes land on the man, his freshly shaved face and a button down he’s casually left open from the top.
“Yeah”, Sam nods easily, “It’s supposed to hurt you guys more than it does him.”
“No, you read it”, he says, and shifts against Cas to get a better position, “Me and Cas listen.”
“Jack!” Dean calls without letting his eyes leave Cas’s, “What do you want for your pizza?”
Cas doesn’t dare to even breathe when he balances with Jack snoring quietly against his neck and the tote bag full of books on his left shoulder. He’s carrying Jack’s little bag in his left hand as he holds the kid with his right.
Cas reluctantly puts the hat on and checks himself from the rear-view mirror before turning his unimpressed expression towards Dean.
Cas tries not to stare at the still sleepy face and the pillow pressed hair. The last time Cas has seen him like that, Dean was in his bed.
Dean whispers to Cas’s ear before they get stuck staring at Jack sleeping for the whole night.
That was not smooth, but Cas is definitely holding back a smile, Dean’s pretty sure of that, so he continues.
Dean makes his way towards her, as she carefully pushes herself up from the chair, smiling wide when she steps into the hug he leans in to give.
He drops his hand, and maybe it’s the intimacy of the dark night and just the two of them there, but Dean finds himself saying, “You’ll figure it out. If that would make you happier, you should do it. You’ll figure the rest out.” He clears his throat, “People would want you to be happy.”
But it’s the only purple thing in the room, there’s no trace of the light they just saw from the outside.
Dean rolls his eyes, but doesn’t walk away just yet, but stands in front of the other boy, challenging.
“Because it drives me crazy! It’s all I can think about when I’m around you, which, given the circumstances”, he gestures around them, “has to happen too much for my taste. I’ve never felt like this about anyone else, and I don’t like it, okay, because hating the movies you like to watch was just annoying”, he makes a frustrated sound before he can continue, “but realizing that I would be fine staring at a fucking wall for hours if you were just there with me sucks even more. And I get that you want to be friends, but”, he shrugs, “I guess I’m just too in love with you to do that right now.”
