And hesitantly, Castiel asked if he could come see him, if Dean wanted him to come over. As soon as he asked, he began backtracking, “Only if you want, don’t feel like you have to—” But Dean interrupted him and told him yes.
Cas looked at Dean, and Dean sighed. “I’ll stop.” Switching on his turn signal to move into the shoulder, he told Jack, “Time to pee in the bushes, kiddo.”
“You ain’t getting through to him,” Benny said, unhelpfully, as Dean headed off. “He won’t see it.”
Cas paused, fork poised midair. “What?”
Insufferable. The best way to describe Benny. Wasn’t enough to weasel his way into Dean’s affections. Had to pry into his past, his stories.
The man nodded. “Yes. I recognize you.” His face reddened slightly. “I saw you once, at a terminal. The one in Marshfield.”
Cas’ finger shifted on his chest, crooking in, then straightening, the pad of his fingertip smooth against Dean's skin. “I don’t know. Sometimes I think… Well, I've got savings, would still like to get a college degree.” His finger stopped moving. “Too old for that anyways, though.”
A neon sign appeared in the dark and he squinted to read it through the falling snow.
“Dean,” Cas started, grabbing Jack’s hand as he started tottering to the ocean.
“You should’ve never been left unattended in the kitchen at such a young age,” Cas griped, grabbing the bowl before it careened over the table's edge from Jack’s vigorous stirring. “You could’ve seriously hurt yourself. If I ever meet John…”
God was no longer a distant father, but his son who viewed the world with maturity and wonder. A young boy learning to find his own balance of angelic nature and humanity, willing to learn and teaching Castiel so much through his open-eyed view of the world.
Benny broke their silence. “Well, next time we find a river, can help you out. Get rid of the backwoods look.”
Castiel was well aware that healing Dean erased any consequences of letting a vampire feed from him. But he couldn’t leave him standing there, neck stinging, blood trickling under his collar, just to learn some lesson.
“You want a peach sample, Dean?” Krista asked.
“Aw, it’s alright, honey,” Eileen told Jack, handing over a towel to Dean.
“You’re alright,” he told him, squeezing his tiny hand, wiping the water from his face. “I got you.”
“Listen.” Dean pointed at himself. “I'm the one with the mojo. I'm the one with the plan. Cas, we're gonna shove your ass back through the eye of that needle if it kills all three of us.”
Benny nodded. “Yup. Unfortunately this little reunion tour took us out of the way quite a bit.” A side-eyed look at Castiel.
Maybe not so ridiculous after all. Maybe the angel understood.
, he told himself, trying to push aside the disquiet.
The kitchen was empty and he sat at the table, stared at the glass in his hand.
Cas held out his hand to him. “Dean, come on.”
Cas was still watching him as he pushed his arms through the sleeves and not looking at him, he asked, “What, Cas?”
“Yup.” Spotting Hot Topical, she headed that way. “You should tell him that.”
“Hope he hasn’t done anything too crazy. Don’t know what shit he might be trying to get me and Cas outta here.”
The thought made him queasy and though he knew he had to get up early tomorrow, he motioned to the bartender to refill his glass. No matter how long in between, he'd always known he’d see Cas again. Easy arrangement. See each other whenever, call sometimes in between, no other expectations. Sure, the inconsistency, the time apart, it wore on him, but maybe the inconsistency was part of the appeal. Whatever arrangement he and Cas had going on worked well enough for them without requiring too much upkeep.
Cas’ shoulders slumped and then he was nodding, looking down at the bedspread. “Fine. If that’s… If that’s what you want.”

“Yes, but you have a plan.” Rolling over, Cas stared up at the ceiling. Dean followed his gaze. The water stain looked like a splotch now. “
Over time, he learned he did not have to be so distant from God and Heaven as he thought.
“I had my reasons,” he tried. “I thought. I thought I had to.” He had been all alone. Kicked out of Heaven, unneeded in Dean’s life.
“Hey,” Dean called. “What happened?”
a lot of fun.
“Oh. Great. Good.”
“You should use it,” Cas urged. “There’s no shame in feeling anxious, I often feel the same way too.”
Fetching a six-pack from his truck, he and Cas sat down on the curb behind the trailer, shielded from view of the bar, an orange streetlight buzzing above their head.
"Drink it slowly, idiot."
Dean nodded. “Don’t know what I’m gonna tell him.” He gestured around and his weapon cut an arc through the air. “I mean, how the fuck do you describe this place?”
“Oh. Sorry.”
Stretching his fingers out by his side, he felt the power of the storm tingle just beyond his reach. Not even Heaven contained such power so concentrated, so focused. No superiors, no rules, no sins. Dog eat dog. Savage, ruthless, yes. But purity of instinct. Thought this place could accomplish what Heaven had tried—to refine him, make him into something more precise.
“I’m gonna turn in,” Dean said, and got to his feet. Castiel returned his gaze to the water and remembered the feel of Dean’s palms against his face.
The water was lukewarm at best, even when the handle was turned all the way to the left. Dean showered quickly, swore under his breath at having forgotten his towel in his truck, and gingerly used one of the ratty ones the motel provided.
Cas touched his cheekbone gingerly. “Oh, well. Think that jackass I punched will have something similar.” He glanced down at his hand and flexed his fist. “That hurt.” Dean started laughing and Cas looked up, smiled a little. “You’re welcome, you know.”
Cas was tracing the floral design on the bedspread with his finger, and Dean hoped he wouldn’t be able to say it. But maybe it was better to have out with it than to keep skirting around the edges, pretending not to know everything was going to change. He'd known this would happen—he had ruined it all or was going to ruin it all or maybe there was nothing to ruin and he should stop reading so much into everything, should take a breath and grin and say it was good while it’d lasted. His chest felt tight.
“I’m glad I ran into you,” Cas said, breaking the silence. “Gets so boring driving.”
He thought he
“I mean, yeah, um. Well, this is… It’s all been arranged.” Leaning forward, he pulled a beer from the cardboard holder on the nightstand. “This is my last drive. I’m done in a week.”
“Guys,” Dean warned.
“We don’t have time.” A weak attempt; Castiel hated the desperation in his voice.
The forest around them remained silent.
He wouldn’t drag Dean into another mess, not again. Not again.
“I’m not drunk,” Cas protested, picking up the can at his feet and peering into it. “Maybe a little. Take this, I need to stop drinking.” He shoved the beer at Dean and rubbed his hands on his jeans. “I just meant that I, um. Well. Been kinda on my own for a while. Nice to finally have someone to talk to.”
He shuddered and Dean pulled him forward, rested his forehead against his. Castiel shut his eyes. He could sense Dean’s heartbeat, frantic.
“I fix.” He wiped away the sand from Dean’s legs and Dean made an exaggerated sigh of relief, moving his legs.
“Hot!” Jack cried, pointing at the dish Dean had told him not to touch. In hindsight, he should’ve realized the temptation would’ve been too much to resist.
“Don’t speak to my son that way!” someone exclaimed, pushing through the crowd of kids and parents to glare at them. “What’s going on?”
Dean snorted. “Well, tough luck. Been in this life for so long, looking like we’ll be stuck in it forever. It’s you and me, buddy. Till we die.”
“See you guys later for dinner?” Sam asked, heading to his own car.
And if he could not, he could at least save Dean from the dangers of trusting a monster.
He could drive for hours like this; a comfortable calm, no thought in his head except the road and his and Cas’ easy conversation that flowed slow and languid over the CB radio like the mountains ridges in the distance.
"I'm sick," Cas answered, as if that wasn't obvious enough by his glassy eyes and disheveled appearance.
Part of Castiel thought he should apologize, but instead, he doubled down. “I would hope not.”
Some nights, when his back ached with phantom weight and his grace clawed, claustrophobic, to escape his chest, he mourned.
“Why’d you leave?”
“Yeah, that too.”
Clearing his throat, Dean straightened. “Pretty late, guess I’ll head out.” The wind hadn’t let up, but, standing to push aside the curtain a little, he saw the snow had stopped.
Looking up,
Dean didn’t look up as he dipped his hands into the river. He wiped at his face, water dripping from his hands.
“Woah, woah, what?” Dean took one of Jack’s hands, stopping him. “Daddy said what?”
Dean and Benny talked low up ahead, and Castiel knew he couldn’t leave Dean again. Rather than escape this place without him, Dean would only search for him, which meant more time spent with Benny. Castiel couldn’t knowingly leave Dean alone with this vampire.
“That the first time you met them?” Dean asked and Cas nodded. “How long’d it been since you saw Anna?”
Slice, jab, two steps back. Then an opening, and he plunged his blade into the vampire's chest, claws scraping at his arm. The creature gasped and choked around the weapon, and with a shove, Castiel sent the monster to the ground. Ripping his blade from its chest cavity, he slashed off its head; one slice as the monster jerked underneath him, then another to finally sever tendon and bone, leaving the vampire in a frozen snarl, teeth stained dark.
“Cas, don’t,” he warned, eyes focusing on him.
Trying to ignore the exhaustion settling on him, he turned to Dean. “I have to agree with the vampire. The risk of crossing Purgatory with a seraph, it's... less than strategic.” Tried to ignore the slithering cold sensation down the back of his neck, the Leviathan’s grins when tracking him down. “Certainly less so when we have no reason to believe that I can pass through the door that you're headed for.”
Swearing under his breath, Benny stomped away with a, “Suit yourself.” Dean didn’t follow, and Castiel cast his gaze down, not wanting to see the disgust in Dean’s eyes. Felt enough of it already from the voices in his head, engrained even without angel radio.
Go further, even. Existing here, he might embrace fully his otherness, his monstrous, powerful being which set him apart from humans, from angels, even from other monsters. Thought it might be freeing.
Jack stuffed his face with two chicken nuggets, which prompted Cas to give Dean a look. “Well, you’re teaching him bad table manners.”
“Think we can get a few more hours in before dark,” Benny said, studying the sky. None of them moved to leave the water, though. The forest around them was perfectly still. Deceptively calm, innocent. Underneath it all, however, Castiel could detect a current of evil, always present.
They compared routes, and found they’d both be traveling East on I-80 the next day, a lucky break. Inwardly, Castiel relaxed a little. He didn’t have to say goodbye just yet. No point in thinking ahead to when that time would come—though, in his experience, it always came too soon.
The longer he stood in the water, the chillier it felt. He waded back to shore.
Cas kept his arms crossed tight around himself and Dean tried a different approach, "Listen, I don’t know what to say. Sorry if you got confused, sorry if you were looking for something more, but, man, I gotta tell you, if you’re looking for some… some sort of relationship, you got the wrong job, you’re looking at the wrong guy.”
“No, it hurt,” Jack cried, trying to pull his hand away.
“Yeah, sorry, got distracted talking to Liam.” He gestured in the direction of the meat vendor with a plastic fork, then back at the pie slice. “Dude, you have to try this, it’s so good.”
Castiel wondered if Benny understood how different his relationship with Dean was on Earth. That he would never be permitted to be this close.
Dean nodded slowly, glanced down at the blade in his hand, knuckles raw and red. “Yeah," he answered quietly. "Me too.”
“I think the time for that is past.”
“Fuck,” Dean managed, trying to shove him off. He ducked when Cole swung at him, and kicked the second man, freeing himself. Before he could move, though, he caught a fist to the face.
He wouldn’t give Benny the satisfaction of admitting his thoughts, though, so he stayed silent, picked at the bark on the log. Benny huffed. “I get it. You're worried what I might do if we make it topside. Like I already told Dean, by the time I got iced, I was strictly on blood transfusions, donated blood. Not donated to me, I'll give you that, but I paid good black-market scratch for it.”
His dad despised love, but he loved Dean’s mom. He preached the worst side of love because he lived it. He loved Mary and so he hunted to avenge her death, became reckless and selfish.
“Know some guys like that. They don’t last long. Hunting ain’t a game or some sport. It’s life or death.”
“Gotta clean off,” Dean said, shucking his jacket. “Benny?”
"No, it's like a special day."
, because it felt like such a relief to get the words out, albeit awkward and stilted.
Wiping crumbs off his hands, Jack said, “I’m gonna get another cookie.”
“I have to get up early tomorrow,” Cas said, frowning at the can in his hand. “Or, today, I guess.”
“Think we’ve had enough of the ocean for one day.” He held out Jack’s bucket. “You wanna play in the sand?”
“He can go buy overpriced kitchen tools then.” It was a little too convenient that Sam had gotten out of taking Jack to this playdate—Dean had a suspicion that the multiple Ronald McDonalds stationed around had something to do with that.
Cas gave him his best,
“Not particularly.”
Thick black ooze rising inside him, pooling out every crevice, choking him, strangling his grace—
Sunlight glinted off the metal locks on the trailer Cas was pulling. It was strange, driving behind Cas like this. Usually they passed each other in a blur on opposite sides of wide highways.
“He needs to be taught a lesson,” Dean agreed, glancing at Jack as he stopped at a red light, trying not to flinch at the crumbs on Jack’s lap that threatened to fall to the floor. “Needs to get knocked down by someone. Hear that, Jack? We’re gonna teach you how to fight back.”
“Yeah, actually.”
When had that happened? When had he lost interest in anyone other than Cas? Once, maybe four years ago, he’d found someone at a bar, a one-night stand. She’d left her number and he’d never called. Part of him had wanted to because Sam had Eileen and now a kid, and Lisa had a husband, and shouldn’t he, also, finally settle down, shouldn’t he stop messing around and find someone, settle?
veins running under
Benny must wonder what had transpired between him and Dean on Earth. Must wonder how they came to be here. Maybe Dean had told him.
“You’re getting more freckles,” Cas said, tracing his back lightly. Dean leaned back into his touch.
“Made pie,” Dean announced eloquently, setting everything down.
she'd responded to the photo Dean had sent her of Jack holding up a pretzel.
Cas seemed nearly as impatient as he was, and neither of them were completely undressed by the time Dean was ducking his head to Cas’ shoulder, swearing at Cas’ hands on him. He wasn’t complaining though, wasn’t complaining at all when Cas stroked him through his orgasm, or when he got to see the way Cas’ eyes screwed up when he got him there, the way they fluttered open when he came down from his high, settling on Dean, a smile playing at his mouth.
“Didn’t know Friendship Day was a thing,” Dean said, sitting across from him.
Dean believed him, but it didn’t stop him from feeling guilty, like he was abandoning Cas. Sitting up, he said, “Well, this is what it is.” Leaning over the side of the bed, he fetched his shirt and pulled it over his head. “I mean, this is why I was dreading telling you, because I didn’t want it hanging over our heads.”
Steeling himself for Dean’s reaction, Castiel forced the words out. “I ran away.”
Sitting down on a slanted log next to Dean, he considered asking Benny if the weather ever changed here, but that would require actually talking to him. Dean, of course, did not have the same reluctance.
Castiel looked over his shoulder at Benny who stood quietly watching the proceedings.
“Dean said he liked it,” Cas said, glancing back at Dean, who was shooting an evil eye at Claire. He quickly wiped it off his face and draped an arm over Cas’ shoulders.
Jack giggled and Dean smiled at him in the rearview mirror. Then Jack announced, “I have to pee.”
“Uh, yeah. Sure.”
“‘Course... I’m still curious,” he said, trying for nonchalant, leaning against the headboard.
“Let’s go,” Castiel agreed, passing them both to continue on their way.
“Per usual,” Cas said, dropping the dumpster lid with a clatter and brushing off his hands. "Which means, no distracting me."
Benny laughed. “Definitely no feather beds out here, cher.”
Dean pushed himself to his feet. “You’re an asshole.”
Benny looked up sharply. Castiel watched Dean’s chest rise and fall for a few long seconds before meeting his eyes. “Make sure he gets back to his brother, makes it alright on Earth.”
“I’ll heal you when I’m able.”
She nodded, handing a room key to the man, who looked oddly familiar. “Everyone’s off the road with the storm.”
"I think he's dealt with worse than a cold before."
Well.
“Yes!” Jack said with a clap of his hands.
“Don’t know how you can always eat that shit every day. You don’t ever get tired of it?”
Dean turned red and scrambled furiously for a comeback. "Yeah, and you're, you're still a little shit." Nailed it.
“Well, don’t see any other option,” Dean retorted.
Didn’t mean Zara fawning over Cas didn’t make his skin crawl.
. But goddammit, he’d always been too stubborn, and he loved Dean, and part of him had hoped, no matter how foolish, that Dean might feel the same way. Dean had driven four hours in the dead of night to see him, Dean had called to tell him his mom had died, Dean had said there was no one else, Dean had been his constant for seven years, and all that, it had to add up to something, didn’t it?
~the end~
Castiel sobered. “Dean.”
“I think he’s ready to try again,” Cas said. "Just along the shore."
“All better,” Dean agreed. Picking up his phone, he glanced at the time and announced, “Time for more sunscreen. Come over here.” Reaching for the bottle, he poured a generous amount into his hand and began slathering it over Jack’s arms and ears and face, holding onto Jack’s arm as Jack protested and tried to get away.
Dean gestured to the monster. “You should meet somebody. This is Benny. Benny, this is Cas.”
Dean filled him in on the last two weeks he’d been driving, mainly uneventful except for a mom and pop’s joint he’d stopped at that had the best pie, he was convinced. Castiel half listened. Had he really thought… He and Dean hardly even talked outside of drives. Sure, they hooked up on every drive they could manage, had known each other for years now, but that didn’t mean Dean was looking to take it a step further, to start driving together.
“I’m sorry,” the man said, fiddling with the key. He looked truly apologetic. “Not a great night to be stuck in the sleeper.”
Fucking shame things had to end this way. But they were done. End of story.
“Ain’t gonna look good, like yours.” Underneath the dirt, blood, and facial hair, Castiel thought he saw Dean redden a little. “Just.” He straightened his legs, shifted in his seat. “Dad was a stickler for that. Some hunters, they hardly ever interact with anyone normal. Spend all their time out in the fucking woods, hunting wendigos and werewolves. Look the part too. Dad, he said once you let your mind slip, reality slipped away from you. You’d turn crazy before long, turn into all animal-sense, like the monsters you hunted.”
He stumbled back from his crouch over the body and fell onto his ass. Dead, it was dead, and the other one too.
Benny whistled as they walked, the stones in Castiel’s pocket clinked quietly. Crunch of footsteps on grass.
Jack craned his neck to look back at the McDonald’s as Cas finished strapping him in. “Play!”
“I doubt they want to see me.” Didn’t miss the way Dean watched him, as if waiting for a sign. For Castiel to agree,
Benny stepped closer, getting into Castiel’s space. Castiel held his gaze, not moving. “You don’t trust me, you can leave. No one’s forcing you to be here.”
“What? You change your mind?”
“Don’t know.”
What was this creature he was becoming? Angel, monster, man; reject, sinner, guardian, rebel. Would he ever find an answer?
They ate lunch at a mom-and-pop’s restaurant as they waited for the mechanic to finish, and Cas gave him the pickle from his sandwich. "I'm sorry I never asked you to stay," Dean told him and wished he'd said it earlier. "I never wanted you to leave."
Castiel nodded, standing, and Dean turned to the door, then paused as a thought struck him.
Dean kissed him before getting off him and rolling over onto his back. “Fuck.” He let out a long exhale. “Been too long since we did this.” He caught himself from saying, “I missed it,” and flushed, hoped Cas hadn’t noticed.
Dean’s eyes flew open and he pulled away. “Not now, we gotta keep moving, and Cas…” Voice trailed off.
Ducking his head, Dean nodded and knuckled brusquely at the corner of his eye. “Thanks,” he said, his voice rough.
Kicking off his boots, Dean stole another glance at Castiel, who set his backpack on the bed, pulled off his hat and ran a hand through his dark hair. He shouldn’t read more into this, right?
Castiel sighed, shoulders dropping. “I knew he would.” He looked down at the tower, leaning to one side. “I hoped he wouldn’t. I hoped he would move on.”
Cas nodded, and across the table, Jack tore into his meal, seemingly not worried at all that the Djinn had prepared it. Sam gave Dean a pointed look and Dean rolled his eyes. So, Zara and her crew weren’t evil and apparently didn’t mean them any harm. Didn’t mean Dean was going to fall over himself trying to be friends.
“Sucks. I mean, Sammy and I fight, sure, but we’ve always been close.”
Castiel glared at him, then noticed Dean shifting, eyebrows creasing as he tried to find a comfortable position. Bending down, he touched two fingers to Dean’s forehead.
“I think I’ve got it,” Cas said, grabbing more dough and forming another pretzel in two easy swoops. Okay, way better than the one before.
“Come close, though, right?” He grinned a little when Castiel tried unsuccessfully to hide a smile. “Soon enough, Cas.”
“I’m going to frame these,” Cas said, tucking the drawings into his bag. “I think they’d look nice in the living room.”
“Water,” he yelled, pointing to the ocean.
“Well, you’re sorely mistaken,” Castiel said coldly. “Angels were created by God for his divine purpose. We’re holy, intelligent beings who crush evil underfoot.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “You know, I wasn’t exactly happy either that I got held up.”
he willed himself, but every attempt to rise was met with a blow that set his ears ringing and his grace shaken.
which meant a lot of grumbling on his end.
"Family recipe," Dean joked, sitting down next to him. "Well, someone's family. Straight from some blog online. Think it's pretty close to what my mom would make." He watched Cas pick up his spoon, and added, "Don't tell Sam." He'd never hear the end of it if Sam knew he was reading mommy blogs.
“Oh,” Hannah said, sounding disappointed. It’d been a lie, but it made Dean wonder all the same if Cas did have someone else back home that he was seeing. There had to be others; they saw each other so infrequently. He realized with a start that he wished he was the only one, and quickly pushed the thought aside.
it mocked. Black saliva dripped from its mouth and Castiel felt suffocated, felt a burning sensation all over him, ooze covering his skin, crawling up to his neck—
Violating the few feet he'd put between them to stay clear of the germs, he stepped closer to loosen Cas' tie. Cas let him, saying, "I can still help research—"
Cas met his eyes, and Dean forced himself to hold his gaze. “Of course,” Cas answered simply.
Dean sighed, then, quick as a wink, he drew his blade back and sliced it across the werewolf’s hand. The monster shrieked, his fingers going flying, and Castiel stumbled back.
If she thought Castiel’s appearance and demeanor was an indicator of lacking mental faculty, she was sorely mistaken. Castiel’s gaze turned sharper, eyes squinting. “So you want to bring me back. To Heaven?”
“I tried to go to Dean, but...” He looked down at his hands and Benny realized something was… off about him. Fuzzy around the edges, almost. His figure seemed to flicker and Benny blinked.
Slight change in the incline of the terrain, downhill. The river they walked alongside rushed faster, spun around jutting rocks.
The simple statement, said so definitively, made Dean a little dizzy. Leaning down, he kissed Cas, felt the bracelet brush his face when Cas cupped his jaw. “You're mine too.”
Castiel slid over on the stump, giving Dean room to sit down. “Pronouncing curses on Benny’s head.”
“Alright?” Benny asked Dean behind him. “Seem jumpy.”
“Oh,” Dean said, eyes falling shut. In a moment his breathing had fallen into a steady rhythm.
“Thank you.”
Turning back around, Benny added, “‘Sides, I’ve heard others talk about it, say if you keep following the rivers, find a rocky ridge. There’s an area, at the top, with a weird magnetism. Seems to repel you, can’t get closer even though all you see are rocks and dirt.” He gestured around them. “Clearly not common, so figure it’s something important. Some sorta portal, it seems.”
to hear. “How can you trust him?”
“You don’t have to—” Cas started, but Krista was already pulling out a cutting board and knife from behind the stand and cutting into the peach.
“It’s proven by science.” He nodded at a chair by Dean. “Go, sit.”
When Cas seemed inclined to stay silent, he ventured, “Can we talk?”
Groaning, Cas dropped his head back on the pillows and stared at the ceiling. "Why is being human so difficult?"
“Gonna have plenty of questions.”
“None of that shit matters anymore,” Dean protested. “Don’t wanna hear that shit anymore.”
“My true form greatly towers over your human body,” Cas said haughtily.
. Distant from vessel or power—him.
Inside the grimy bathroom, Cas was washing his hands. He caught Dean’s eye in the mirror before looking down, and Dean moved out of the way for someone to leave through the door. No one stood at the urinals, and the stalls looked empty, so when Cas turned off the faucet, Dean grabbed his arm and tugged him to the largest stall at the end.
, he thought, brushing his teeth in the sickly, yellow light of the bathroom. What was the worst that could happen? Castiel would kick him out and he’d sleep in his truck. It’s what he’d expected to do tonight anyway.
Dean laughed. “No, he ain’t my dad. Well, for all intents and purposes, yeah. But he’s my uncle.”
The next day, Zara and her entourage showed no signs of going home. Dean ran into several of them in the bathroom down the hall, two sitting in the kitchen talking to Jack, and four more in one of the archival rooms helping Sam—as Dean had suspected—catalogue Cas’ gifts.
“It's too dangerous,” Castiel tried.
“Stow it, Cas. You're coming. That's final.”
Settling down into the seat Jack had vacated, she asked, “I wasn’t expecting you two today. Where’s Sam?”
Stooping, Castiel picked up a rock and held it inside his fist in his pocket, the rough ridges digging into his palm, grounding. Then he fell into line.
“It is,” Cas insisted. He ran his finger over the bracelet, blue threads forming a pattern more even in some places than others. “You’re my best friend.”
Dean’s presence at his back disappeared. A quick glance over his shoulder revealed him meeting a Leviathan in battle.
“Dean,” he said, reaching out to clutch onto Dean’s jacket. “They’re here.” He scanned the forest around them again. “They’re here, I’m sorry.”
“Yeah, sorry.” Dean rubbed at his forehead. “Uh. Should be around one. I’ll text you when I reach the terminal, never know how long it’ll take them to unload everything.”
“That’s not what I meant—” Dean huffed. “Listen, I don’t have fucking time for this, I’m tired. Just didn’t work out this time. We’ll get another chance.”
“Turns to ice sometimes.” Benny scrubbed water over his face, then gestured to Dean. “C’mere.”
How could he say such a thing about a vampire? A monster he killed on Earth? But of course. Benny knew of this ‘escape hatch’ and was keeping its location from Dean. Assurance he wouldn’t be killed. If Castiel had known all along that Dean was traveling with a vampire…
“And no powers,” Sam spoke up. “Most important rule of all.”
Dean glanced at him. “What?”
And that’s how it all began.
“Come on, Dean,” Eileen urged. “Aren’t you tired of sitting over here?”
He tried to say something else, then turned and left the room in a rush. Tomorrow. Cas was gonna leave and Dean had told him he should go.
“Of course.”
Her words had rung in his ears as he took a bus to Pittsburgh where a cousin had an apartment where he could crash. Echoed while he bussed tables at a 24-hour diner and tried to save up money for a car, for an apartment of his own.
Thinking of Bobby, he reached for his phone to text him, tell him to head over to pick him up. Then he paused and let his hand drop. Once Bobby picked him up, that was it. Much as he’d wanted to quit for so long, it all felt too soon. He’d been driving for 15 years, but it still seemed there were things left undone, unsaid. Like he was leaving on the cusp of something more.
“He will. He’s very friendly.” One tear dripped into his guacamole.
Dean laughed and set the six-pack on the nightstand by the bed. Standing by the door, Castiel watched him thumb through a brochure on the nightstand. As motel rooms went, Dean was right, this one wasn’t the worst of the lot. A heavily quilted bed, a box TV covered in too much dust, and heavy curtains over the window facing the road.
“Fuck off,” Dean told him. He would’ve flipped him off, but that would require lifting his hand out from under the blanket and he was too—
“How’s Dean doing?”
“Yes.” He didn’t mention that he’d been driving for three years now. “Gabe told you?” He’d spoken to Gabe a few months ago, another rare call.
“Uh, yeah, sure.” Dean coughed into his fist, raised his menu again. “‘Course. Anyone’s welcome to stop by.” Inwardly, he winced. God, he was a jackass. He knew what Cas was saying.
, he repeated to himself the next day, watching Zara and Cas talk over breakfast. Or the next, which played out the same way: too many strangers wandering the hallways, Zara taking up all of Cas’ attention. Not that Dean needed Cas’ attention; he just didn’t see how Cas could be so oblivious to Zara’s intentions.
“I know, I know,” Dean said. “Don’t be rude to our guests, blah blah blah. I get it.”
Benny tightened his grip on his weapon. “Ain’t done nothin’. Don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“I left for your safety—”
Dean figured, heading back to his truck. Clanging sounded from a warehouse door being opened, shrill beeps echoing as a truck backed up into the dock. A flock of birds startled from the trees surrounding the shipping center and tipped and swirled in the sky. Once this trailer he’d been dragging got unloaded, he’d park it at the nearest drop yard and say goodbye to the place that had been his home for the last three weeks.
Cas looked up as he approached. Some emotion passed over his face, eyes softening, then he looked down again.
Turning back to the parade, he met Sam’s eyes. “Never thought we’d both end up here, right?” Sam asked over the noise, attempting levity, and Dean wondered if he remembered sitting outside near a Pride parade, feeling so unsure. There were plenty of other instances to remember, plenty of times John made disparaging comments that Dean either pretended to not hear or agreed with out of a panic that if he wasn’t careful, they might be directed at him next.
Dean stood and pulled up the blinds on the window just to do something with his hands. Cas had only said it as a last, desperate bid to get him to stick around, he told himself. That’s all. No way Cas could really feel that way.
His brain short circuited a little when Cas kissed him back, and it was a second before he could process the way Cas was pressing up close to him, hands gripping at his shirt. Slipping his arms around Cas’ waist, he pulled him flush, chest to chest. Cas made a small noise in the back of his throat and wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck. Dean’s head spun.
Sometimes Dean wondered if his dad truly loved his mom. Or if he only felt guilty.
Sam frowned. “Dean, you don’t think Cas—“
Dean looked to Cas for help, who spoke up, “I’m afraid Dean is right, Zara. I’m sorry, but I don’t think I realized the extent of the commitment I made. I can’t marry you.”
“Come here,” Cas told Dean. He grabbed the sunscreen bottle and Dean moved to sit with his back to him.
okay?” Cas asked after a few moments’ silence.
Cas poked at a toy and it squeaked.
Shouldn’t—that’s what his superiors would have told him, the menacing commandment hanging over him on Earth. Shouldn’t admire humans, grow close to them, desire them.
“Good riddance,” Dean said. Didn’t seem as enthusiastic as Benny, though. Maybe he was just tired.
Dean couldn’t help following his gaze. Eileen climbed onto Sam’s back and splashed water at Cas, who ducked under the waves. The sun was lowering in the sky, casting the waves in pink and orange. A breeze blew Jack’s hair back from his forehead, and he clutched at the shell, blue eyes gazing intently at the waves.
“No, it’s alright,” Castiel said quickly. Dean had called him just to talk, without an excuse? “Are you at Bobby’s?”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said. “Listen, uh, I’m not gonna make it tonight.”
Cas huffed and Dean could only keep up the ruse for a few more seconds before lifting the edge of the blanket. “Come on, get under.”
Stars littered the sky when Dean pulled off the road into the Love’s parking lot. It was later than he’d hoped to get there, already past 8pm, and he scanned the rows and rows of trucks parked tight alongside each other, hoping there were still spaces open.
Stepping back, Cas let out a heavy exhale. “Fuck,” he said. “That’s the stuff, that’s what makes me wanna quit. I would’ve never been able to live with myself.”
"Well, uh, wash your hands," Sam said, stepping back as Cas started for the door, Dean following. "Don't wanna spread any germs. And try to stay out of the library."
“Sorry—”
He found a few free spots at the back of the lot and pulled in next to another rig. Slinging his bag holding a change of clothes and toiletries over his shoulder, he headed across the lot to the truck stop. His joints felt a little stiff from sitting the majority of the day, but he was used to the aches and pains by now, and, anyway, a long driving day was worth it to get here by tonight.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What’s wrong?” Cas asked.
“Just you and me, kid,” Dean told him.
"But Jack needs to make friends."
Dean grinned. “What’s that?”
“Shit, Cas. Way to bring down the mood.”
Dean had to agree, but he didn’t say it, instead let himself get distracted by the way Cas was sliding his hands under his shirt.
“She seems nice,” Sam commented.
“It’s freezing. Supposed to snow tonight.” With any luck, it’d just flurry and he wouldn’t be caught out in a storm, could get his new shipment and get back on the road.
“And you know who saved my life? Stayed by my side the whole damn time?” Castiel knew, he knew with a sinking regret, but Dean jabbed his finger in the direction Benny had walked off. “He did. The fucking monster you hate. A fucking vampire had my back more than you, a damn angel. So, guess what. You don’t get to say nothing to me.”
Benny shrugged. “Way it is. Just doing what I gotta do.”
Dean huffed. “Really? You gonna be like that?”
“For fuck’s sake,” Dean said, gathering up the remainders of his food. “Come on.”
Dean inwardly winced at that. Or thought he did so inwardly, but his expression must've revealed something because Cas glanced over at him, then straightened up, nearly spilling his tea. "Dean, I didn't mean anything by that."
Or would Dean grow to loathe him? Past mistakes and betrayals growing wild and huge in memory, undercurrent of anger growing wider and deeper until it cleaved them in two?
“Done!” Jack announced, and Cas pushed his chair back so he could escape.
“Dean, I am perfectly fine, I—” Cas paused, face scrunching up, then he sneezed before he could finish his sentence.
“Hey, hey.” Dean gave them both warning glances. “Stand down. We survived attacks from every fucking type of monster, not gonna let you guys die from some cat-fight.”
Alright, she wouldn’t take it that far, but, “Yeah, close enough.”
“In five days.” Leaning back in his chair, he studied a chip in the paint where the wall met the floor. “Going up north, so we won’t cross paths.”
“You can—” Dean started, then stopped. Eyes flicking from Castiel to Benny. Grunt, shift. “Can touch yourself if you want. Don’t care.”
“If you only knew the things I’ve done,” he said quietly. “Has Dean told you?”
An irrational thought, but he couldn't help feel as if he’d lost Dean.
“Yeah, and what about riptides?” Dean asked. “They can suck you in from shore, can’t they?”
“Will you
Maybe because they only hooked up in the odd times their routes crossed, no obligations. Nothing to talk about. Though, in the seven years he’d known Cas, their meetings seemed less like hookups now and more like reunions. Something he looked forward to and missed when they were apart. Maybe they still kept it a secret out of habit. He didn’t know when they’d become a sure thing.
“You offered,” Castiel repeated flatly.
Cas’ eyes brightened. “That’s a wonderful message.” He glanced back at Dean and frowned. “Dean, they’re not going to bite.”
The stones from his pockets didn’t balance on top of each other quite right, too knobby and irregular. Kept trying, though. Kept his hands and mind busy, needed to keep his mind busy, on something else, anything else than…
“Then we’ll move fast.” He wiped his blade on the grass. “Cas, no more using your grace. You save it up for when we get close, gonna need all the firepower we can get.”
Castiel bristled. “Wasn’t anything of the sort. Simply doing what needed to be done.”
Tempting, too, the idea of relaxing, putting his guard down, fully trusting someone in the way Dean did Benny. There was only one person he could imagine trusting so much—but no matter.
“Cas!”
but Sam ignored him.
“Fuck,” he muttered, opening his eyes. Probably someone asking for money. He waited to see if they’d go away, then two more knocks sounded, louder this time.
“If you’re offering.”
“Nothing, uh.” Castiel tried to gather himself.
Castiel reached out to run his fingers over a tree, claw marks marring the bark, shredding the moss. “Because we’ve passed this tree twice already.”
“You know what to do, there’s only one—” He shifted his weight, crossed his arms. “Cas, there’s only one option. You can’t stay here.”
Castiel looked at Dean to see if he was buying this bullshit, but Dean only watched Benny with curiosity. “I don’t feel it,” Castiel muttered.
Dean rolled his eyes but took it. “I’m not weighing down my jacket with this crap, though.”
“Right, yeah, hi.”
“I’m Castiel, by the way,” the man said as they stepped into the cold and headed to a room a few doors down.
“Yes, I do,” Cas said, and Jack laughed in delight.
Long phone calls to family and friends who told them to take their time,
He forced himself to get in his truck, pull shut the sleeper berth curtain, and lay in the dark. Still, the need to know pounded in his chest, kept him awake, eyes straining to recognize the outlines of shapes in the sleeper. He used to be content just holding the words inside. His own secret. He loved Dean and that was enough. It wasn’t enough anymore; he wasn’t that selfless. He wanted, needed, to speak the words, needed to hear them spoken to him.
Just to be obnoxious, Dean shoved half of his burger into his mouth in one bite. Jack laughed at him and Cas rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, seems to always work out that way.”
Which was worse? Those tortuous punishments or a long, drawn out eternity spent in this place between Heaven and Hell? It was his rebellion, after all, that had caused him to end up here. The freedom here was a twisted kind; one fulfilled only in violence and bloodlust. Not that he deserved a life of freedom.
Kenny Rogers' greatest hits played from the speakers around the bar, and Dean studied the last remnants of whiskey in his glass before finishing it. Setting the glass down, he glanced around the bar, hoped he’d get to see Cas again tonight. Reaching Fort Collins, he’d pulled off into a Walmart Supercenter parking lot for the night. Cas had kept driving, but was hoping to double back and join him if his next shipment wasn’t ready to be picked up until morning. It was nice, getting to see Cas for more than a few hours at a time, getting to make plans to see each other soon instead of going their separate ways for another several weeks.
“He ain’t bluffin’,” Benny spoke up. “You got something to spill, spit it out.”
“Oh,” he said, stopping short. “You meant food, food.”
“I just thought…” Cas paused, glancing around the diner. Dean recognized a driver sitting at the counter on the stools. “Thought we’ve known each other long enough.”
Dean stared him down and Jack added, “Peas.”
“Yeah, if you want to be on the nose about it, sure.”
That it hurt at all was enough reason to stop, but Castiel kept quiet as he hovered his hand over the puncture wounds and healed them. “There you go.”
Frowning, Cas took it from him and pulled out two packets of seeds. “Tomato seeds?” he asked, studying them.
Castiel tried to ignore them, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the microexpressions flitting across Dean’s face as Benny sucked his blood. Discomfort, at first, as Benny’s mouth worked to draw the blood from his veins. Then, a gradual softening, hint of a smile as Benny groaned around the wound. Ease.
“You close with her?”
Grabbing his phone, he told himself to suck it up and call Bobby. Time to quit, time to move on. Instead, his eyes fell to a crumpled receipt in the center console. He grabbed it to throw it away, then noticed it was from one of the motels he and Cas had stayed at a few days ago.
He chose the color blue because it felt less ostentatious than the pinks and lilacs Claire presented to him. Even so, the color looked strikingly bright in the sunlight as he stood along the street marked off for the parade, and he shoved his hands into his pockets.
Eileen signed something to Cas that Dean didn’t catch, but evidently Jack did, because he started jumping up and down.
“But?” Benny pressed, a grin tugging at his mouth.
“Try one,” Cas told Dean, joining Jack and pushing over the plate.
“Just to be—fuck, sorry—” Dean accidentally knocked his elbow against Castiel’s arm. “Just to be clear. You didn’t invite me to your room just to be nice, right?” Castiel’s hand slid up his thigh, found his ass. “This was always your end goal.”
“It’s not my fault Jack’s a crybaby,” Tommy shot back.
“Oh, then it’s so great that I went to preschool,” Cas said, managing to sound sarcastic even with his nose stuffed up. Dean winced as he wiped his nose on the sleeve of his trenchcoat. “It’s not like I haven’t been a human for only three months.”
“West Virginia. You?”
That was a heavy admission, for both of them. Cas seemed to be waiting for more, if his silence was any indicator, but Dean didn’t know what else to say, felt a little frightened by the implications of what they'd said. He picked up his menu again, thumbed through the pages, then the waitress came to take their orders.
“Cas.” He hesitated and Cas was silent on the other end. “Where are you? Did you leave Wisconsin yet?”
“Don’t say that,” he said, and Dean froze, eyes snapping to their father. Dad pulled his eyes from the street to Sam, giving him a long, steady look.
“No, Sam.” Cas put out his hand to stop Sam from bolting down the hallway. “It’s not like that, they’re friendly.”
Dean’s only answer was a jut of his chin towards Castiel, who became suddenly hyper-aware of how he was staring. Ducking his head, face warm, he picked up a stone at random, stacked it on another, feeble attempt to pretend his mind was occupied elsewhere.
“Now what the hell is going on with you?”
“I’m sure it was an accident.” She put her hand on the kid’s shoulder. “You didn’t mean to hurt him, right, Tommy?”
He caught the twitch in Dean’s face, either hidden amusement or disappointment. “That's a good question.”
But Dean must escape, he told himself.
Thousands of voices in his head, taking control. Trapping him inside his vessel, limbs moving without his permission.
“Where’re you headed?”
“She’ll love a day-old pretzel,” Dean told him.
“You’re fucking drunk. You’re gonna feel like shit driving.”
He'd known those words would come back to bite him. He fumbled for an excuse, "Yeah, because I'm busy and always on the road, I don't know. I don't meet many new people, and it's just easy with you since I've known you forever."
“Looking more crowded in here.” Dean touched the leaves of one of the plants sitting on a shelf. “See you added more plants.”
“So, what?" Dean asked, regretting ever bringing up the topic. "You want me to stick around, keep driving so you won’t be lonely? That what you want?”
He took up sand, rubbed it over the stain on the hem. He scrubbed and scrubbed until the mark washed away. Then he continued with every other one the Leviathan had left behind.
They dressed in the cramped space, and Dean grinned as Cas pulled on his jacket, his hair still disheveled, his expression disgruntled. Grabbing his elbow and turning him around to face him, he smoothed Cas’ hair and fixed the collar of his shirt. Sliding his hands down Cas’ arms, he kissed him when Cas tilted his face up.
When Dean didn’t, couldn’t answer, Cas shook his head. “I know. I know we never put a name to this, never thought we should, but—”
Throwing himself forward, he sunk his blade into the Leviathan’s chest again. Slashed at the Leviathan again and again and again, and then Dean was pulling him back from a mangled body on the ground, head split open, saliva sizzling the grass, burning his hands.
Cas sniffled. "That's ridiculous. Everyone knows Atlantis was formed by—" He was interrupted by a yawn, and Dean made a mental note to return to that subject later.
Castiel looked up from the stack of stones he had made on the dirt. He’d balanced a single leaf on top of the tower and Dean’s approach blew it away. He snatched up the leaf again and put it back in place.
“Never worked out.” He shifted gears as the road inclined. “Needed to make more money than the garage could pay me. ‘Sides, thought I’d like to see the country first. My dad always told me I should try driving. After high school, getting married, it made sense. Then, guess it was like with you. Just never stopped, even after Lisa.”
But Cas had loved him a long time. Every touch of healing grace, every rebellious act, every word of protection written into ribs, every long, watchful night—love in all its facets.
“And we don’t want a swarm of them,” Dean spoke up, guessing what he was thinking. Cas looked at him. “They’ll snatch Jack up and fly away with him.”
“What is your motive?” He crossed his arms where he stood, felt incredibly puny in his hospital clothing, dirty trench coat. Not imposing like he wanted to be. “Why are you traveling with Dean?”
He started to pull the covers back on the bed, but the thought of lying down with the hunt running on repeat through his head was less than appealing. Cas’ trenchcoat hung bloody on the wall, and Dean clenched his hands into fists to stop them from shaking, adrenaline and nerves still rushing through him.
“Are you daring me?”
“Sam, Sam! I went on a slide!” Dean gave him a thumbs up in the rearview mirror and Jack copied it.
“Why did you try to leave?”
A tiny alarm went off in Dean's brain about germs, but he returned to the bed to kiss Cas on the forehead anyway. True love, and all that. God, he was getting sappy in his old age.
And for once, he knew he didn’t have to, not anymore. Cas had said he wasn’t asking for forever, but Dean knew he wasn’t going to stop loving Cas before then. And he had a pretty good idea Cas would love him that long too. Forever it was.
“I’ll hold you to that.”
Dean was elbow deep in the hood of a 1966 Cadillac when Bobby called his name above the music blasting through the garage. Reaching over to turn down the radio, Dean straightened and looked up. “Got a visitor,” Bobby said, nodding behind him at the garage's entrance.
“Fuck.” He rubbed his eyes with the base of his palms. Cas had said he loved him, Cas had said there was no way Dean didn’t feel anything towards him.
“Oh. Where’s he at now?”
, he told himself. Just, concern. Friendly concern for Cas.
Krista started laughing and, face burning, Castiel crouched to collect the fallen peaches, bags banging against his knees. “Sorry, I’m so sorry, I’ll pay for these. Jack, say sorry.”
*important note*
Dean would be hurt, angry. But with time, he hoped Dean would see why he chose to stay behind. Hoped Dean would one day forgive him. For everything.
Freezing, Castiel stared at him. “What?”
“Where were you?” he asked, stopping short.
"Dean, I—" Dean waited for an answer, expectantly, and Castiel's heart sunk. "I can't lie to you. Not again."
Seemed his disapproval only egged Dean on, because he leaned back against Benny’s chest. “I’m fine. Just a bit.”
Grimacing, the metallic taste bitter on his tongue, he snatched up a rag from the splintered wood counter. The blood bag curled in on itself, clear plastic stained with the remnants of his meal.
“An altar, of sorts, I suppose.” He stacked another stone on top of the leaf to keep it in place. “God instructed His followers to build stone altars for sacrifice, to mark places of deliverance and answered prayer. All in the name of remembrance.” He knocked the tower down and the stones clanked and thudded as they fell. “I don’t want to leave a trail, though, so I build and then dismantle.” Collecting the stone which had rested on the top, he tucked it into his pocket and looked up at Dean.
Ignoring Sam’s record-setting bitch face, he hesitantly started eating, finding to his annoyance that Zara was right. This food
“Think we’ve met before,” Bobby said, extending his hand.
made Dean laugh until he wiped tears from the corners of his eyes, had to catch his breath. This happiness didn't seem so fragile, this time. When they turned on the TV tomorrow night three hundred miles away,
The hill plateaued and Benny turned in a slow circle, scanning the surrounding land. Castiel didn’t know what he saw as they were enclosed in a brambling forest. Dean seemed only mildly concerned, changing his grip of the blade in his hand, watching Benny.
Benny nodded at them. “And whose lap is he sleeping in?”
For some reason, that made a smile tug at Dean’s mouth before he ducked his head. They passed a mangled body slumped against the base of a tree; Castiel couldn’t identify the monster. A gap in the trees and brush revealed Benny ahead, then the forest veiled him again.
“You can. Benny, tell him.”
“Cool trick,” Benny said, drawing him from his reverie.
Not okay, not okay, he gripped so tightly to Dean’s jacket he thought the fabric might tear, why didn’t Dean understand? They were out there and they were coming for him and they would hurt Dean, hurt him again.
“What the hell should we even be looking for? What if we missed it?”
“I mean, if that’s something you’d want to do,” he added. “Could try it, just once, just to see.”
Feeling a little sheepish for immediately jumping to the worst conclusions—one of his greatest talents, if he did say so himself—he shook his head. "Nah, I have a great immune system."
“Don’t patronize me, Dean.”
Dean surveyed the area, then shook his head. “Can’t risk it.”
Cas’ eyes widened going from the dangling bracelet to him. “You made one for me?”
The staff behind the counter were watching along with everyone else in the restaurant, the once noisy place now brought to tense stillness. Cas snatched up the rest of their food and Dean knew they were already on the verge of getting the cops called on them, but he couldn’t resist turning and jabbing his finger at the little brat. “And don’t you ever fucking touch Jack again!”
Castiel looked over at Dean who lay half-propped against a log, arms crossed against his chest, head hanging at a harsh angle, drooping lower as he slept. They’d been attacked last night. Shapeshifters. They couldn’t shift in Purgatory, but their skin still slid off with every hack and slice. Bulbous clumps dotted the grass a few feet away, the smell getting worse with every passing hour.
"No." Cas squinted one eye open to look at Dean over the blanket pulled up to his shoulders, and, fuck, if he wasn't still the most beautiful man Dean had ever seen, even sick as a dog. "Thank you."
“I am if he is,” Benny said, eyeing Castiel warily.
“Zara and Sam sure are getting along well,” Dean said after a few minutes of silence. “They’re going through the books in the library right now. Apparently there’s a lot of ‘inaccuracies’ in them.”
“Jesus, you two are a sorry lot.” Benny elbowed Dean. “What’s gotten into you, cher?”
“Just eat two more nuggets,” Cas told him. He picked up his filet-o-fish sandwich and glanced at Dean. “What?”
“It’s alright.” Funnily enough, he didn’t mind talking about it now. Maybe he’d drunk too much to be self-conscious about it. “Uh, I don’t know. Got hitched in ‘99, right out of high school, same time I started driving. Not over the road yet, but it was a lot, and I was working another part-time job on the weekends, and I didn’t really know what the fuck I was doing, being married, ya know? She got lonely and sick and tired of it all, and I guess I didn’t really see the signs. And when I did, it was too late to save anything. Only lasted ‘bout two years.” He paused, remembering. Getting a lawyer, signing papers he hardly understood, packing up his shit and moving back in with his mom. “She, uh, she has a kid now, with another guy. Remarried a year after we split up, lives in Florida.”
Castiel opened his mouth to protest, and Dean cut him off, raising a hand, “I’m not saying it, okay? I’m not. I’m just saying you, uh. You got a tendency to poke the bear.”
“That’s what I’ve been doing!” Dean protested.
Rage should’ve risen in his chest at Benny’s words, refutes spilling from his lips: an angel was intrinsically different from a monster. Powerful forms beyond human comprehension. Holy. But instead he remembered the slide of a blade into his chest when Dean first saw his physical form. No more than a monster to Dean in that moment.
His choice, to stay behind. Stay strong, stay strong.
Dean nodded. “Alright then. Let’s go. Stay close.”
“Gonna rest here for a bit,” Dean said, and led him to a bare patch of grass. Lowered him to the ground.
ps: you may have noticed i updated the chapter count. tune in next week for the epilogue :)
He tried to push all his emotion into his grace seeping in Dean’s skin. He would do anything to take Dean’s pain away, anything at all. But if Dean could find companionship here, of all places, he would do just fine on Earth. He didn’t need Castiel to protect him.
Benny seemed to fall asleep, and Dean slept on. Castiel watched over him.
The sharp edges of the rock cut into Castiel’s palm. He raised his eyes to meet Dean’s when every reminder of the Leviathan was gone; at least, the ones visible on his coat.
Dean glanced up. Cas had set his menu down and was watching him, hands clasped on the table. Dean raised an eyebrow. “I’d like to visit, if I may.”
“Easy,” Cas said, taking a green crayon from the box. “I could draw your every freckle from memory.”
he told himself, forcing himself to stand, joints stiff from the cold.
Dean eyed how much was left in his beer can. “Glad me getting beat up gave you some entertainment.”
to yourself.” At Dean’s insistent look, Castiel let his blade retract. “They’re bordering on blasphemy.”
He wondered, undressing in the narrow bathroom as Dean fiddled with the shower knob, whether Dean felt the same insistent need when they were together to take advantage of every second. God knew they never got enough of this. Or, at least, it never felt enough to him.
“Stare enough to know what I look like,” Dean muttered, feeling his ears heat. He caught Cas reaching for the red crayon. “Hey!” Of course the fucker would draw him blushing.
“I’ll be there in a moment.” He heard Dean walk away as he smoothed the dirt and scattered the stones. Hardly a sign that he had been here. Nothing for any monster to track. His angelic presence attracted them enough—though perhaps as his grace continued to hide deeper inside of himself, he would become less a target. One day, perhaps, he might be indistinguishable from any other monster. Telling, that he no longer felt panic at the thought. Just resignation.
It was a decision he did not take lightly.
“You have to finish your food,” Dean told him. Crossing his arms, Jack glared at him and stomped his foot on the chair.
, this was so much harder to say than he’d thought; it sounded ridiculous aloud.
“Really?” Dean looked around them. He’d been jittery all day, gripping his blade, jerky movements as he scanned the forest around them. “I don't see crap. We’ve been walking for hours.”
Even when Sam fell into Hell and Dean left to live with Lisa and her son, even kicked out of Heaven and on his own, Castiel had sought out direction. Would watch Dean from afar, invisible, as if an answer, a directive would appear to him. And one did, in the form of a demon who manipulated him, lied to him.
“Alright,” Cas said after a long moment, pulling away. “Gotta go.”
“It’s alright. Anna and Gabe—that’s one of my brothers—they call sometimes. Gotten easier since my dad passed. He, uh… he was the main reason I left.”
“Uh, maybe because she’s trying to marry you.”
“Fucking stupid,” he muttered aloud. As if that would change anything. Would’ve only made splitting up now harder.
“Just trying to enjoy my meal.” A smile revealed he was only joking, though Castiel didn’t appreciate the statement.
Sam shrugged. "Taking care of Cas, making dinner, you're almost domestic."
“You bailed out and, what, went camping?” He searched Castiel’s face and Castiel felt bare under his gaze. “I prayed to you, Cas. Every night!”
“But you’ll have me, we’re both gonna die alone together.”
"Yeah, well, wish he didn't have to deal with any of it." Any of it meant plenty. Between Dean’s own fuckups, world apocalypses, and near-death and actual death experiences, Cas had been through the ringer several times over. And now he was human—which, by all counts, wasn’t the worst thing he’d been through, but it wasn’t ideal. It’d been a rough transition, anyway.
“Just gonna be weird. Adjusting.”
“Well, you’re fucking wrong.” Sam started to speak, but Dean ignored him and turned on his heel, continued to his room. “I’m not fucking jealous,” he muttered under his breath.
“You’re an evil—!”
Cas studied him and Dean’s pulse hammered in his chest as he waited for inevitable rejection. Instinct told him to backtrack, but now that he’d voiced everything, it seemed like torture to have to carry it all inside him again. He didn’t know how he’d done it for years.
For a moment, he let himself wonder if this was a sign that this unpredictable thing he and Dean had wasn’t enough. That maybe he should be looking somewhere else, should be looking for a serious relationship, someone he could see more than only a few times a year. He couldn’t make himself believe it. He didn’t want anyone else.
“Lookin good.” With a grin Dean flicks at the brim of Cas’ sunhat and Cas swats him away.
Glancing around, Dean caught sight of Benny sitting in the dining area. Making his way over there, he clapped Benny on the shoulder, sank into the chair opposite him. “Hey, thought you’d be up further north by now.”
Cas said it best, so he settled for lifting Cas’ hand and kissing his knuckles.
“Told you so,” Krista smiled. She held out a box and Cas placed the peaches that had tried to make their escape inside. Sixteen in total. Much more than they needed for a pie. Well, at least they were delicious.
