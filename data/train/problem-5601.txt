His heart sank at the idea that Steve and Nat could be lying in some ditch, bleeding to death. Dread pooled at the pit of his belly as he recalled the last things he’d said to Steve –
They had started out, at the beginning, walking side by side. Along the way, Tony had wandered off, made a few detours, without giving Steve a chance to follow. With time, they’d drifted far from each other, losing sight of their destination.
Instead of his parents, Steve was beside him, tossing and turning in his sleep. Tony glanced at him, observing the perspiration dotting his forehead. His face was taut with tension, eyes squeezed tightly as they remained shut, keeping their owner trapped in a different sort of dream.
It made for a beautifully intense pulse of indigo energy that swirled terrifyingly around Tony, going on and on and on, until it stopped. Tony blinked in disbelief as he found himself, kneeling in front of the emperor, although his body remained amazingly unharmed.
It was almost a relief to see Ferrumarx amidst the snow-capped mountains, with its steely spoke barely visible above low wisps of cloud. Up there, in his fortress and sanctuary, was where time stood still, for the mountain cared neither for the hours nor the minutes that passed it by.
“You're a lot heavier than you look,” Tony grumbled when he set Steve down, as gently as he could. Only for him to be violently pushed off the edge.
“Thank you,” Steve said, standing on his toes as if he was going to kiss Tony’s nose. Awkwardly, Steve pulled away abruptly. “Sorry, I don’t know what’s come over me,” he said, and his cheeks were flushed with pink.
“Oh. Stuff. It’s nothing. I just - I collect things,” Tony mumbled and kept the lid on it tightly closed.
Days had passed since Steve overheard Tony’s conversation with his family, but Tony never brought it up and Steve wasn’t going to ask.
“I am,” he said. If King Howard was sending them the crown prince, his only child and heir, watching over him seemed like the very least he could do.
Steve caught him just in time, and held him so tightly that Tony thought he would pass out again. But he leaned into the touch, Steve's hand on the back of his neck grounding him, and bringing him back to the present.
Dilated pupils. Flushed cheeks. A sharp intake of breath. “Oh. Anthony. Just Steve is fine,” he said, looking as though he was about to faint.
“I do,” Tony assured him. “There’s something about it though. Something I can’t quite seem to put my finger on.”
At the sound of his footsteps, Steve turned his head. “Hey,” he murmured softly, as his clear eyes shone with surprise.
Okay. Okay. It would be okay. There had been a lot of water. There was a power surge and a blast. Tony was broken, more broken than he'd ever been. But he would be okay.
Just thought this would be a good place to mention that this story has a 100% happy ending. It will just take our boys a little while to get there. Thank you so much for reading! Please let me know if you have any questions, especially about the universe. There is a high chance I've thought about it, but just didn't manage to include it. =D
Thanos whipped his head around, reared up on his hind legs, and sent an enormous jet of fire at the dracanix, who struggled to retaliate with frostbreath in the face of this raging inferno.
Tony forced his eyes open. The wooden box was on the floor and a small top was spinning on top of it. It was small, about the size and shape of an acorn, but slightly wider in the middle, similar to the seed of the heartewoode tree.
“I don’t understand. How can you approve, and not approve, of me at the same time?” he asked Fury, who wanted to see him (alone) after deploying Steve and Nat somewhere in the middle of the Indian Ocean.
“No, believe me, we do not. It’s an alpha thing,” the man told him, patting him on the back as he swept out of the room with some sort of urgency.
“They’ve cracked,” Jarvis observed, frowning at the liquid oozing out of the cracks. “Must have been rotten,” he hypothesised.
With Steve on his back, Tony glided up the chain of volcanoes, and landed on the ledge of the largest one.  Vomiryune was covered in snaking fissures that wound around the mountain. From their vantage point, they looked like fiery serpents desperately escaping the volcano’s reeking head, which fumed and bubbled with liquid fire.
The lady named Wanda frowned at this act of defiance and clenched her fingers into a fist, using her magic to force the reluctant king to his knees.
Once Peter returned, they scrambled into their planned positions to hold Thanos down. Peter’s tail was wound tightly around Thanos’ thick hindlegs, with Tony’s teeth in one arm and Rhodey’s in the other. Strange was in the air, magic cloak billowing behind him as the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak circled the tyrant’s purple wings.
The park was crowded with families enjoying picnics and bicycle rides that fine summer day and Tony soon found himself reminiscing about afternoons at the park with his parents. Alone, he could only watch enviously as blissful couples walked past him, trading kisses and sharing ice-cream cones.
“I’ve been making pancakes, for us. Do you want to have some? With me?” It's a peace offering. A tribute. One that Steve accepted with a huge smile.
Tony bit down on his lower lip. “I have ideas,” he said, giving Steve a look. “But this may not be the right place.”
“How are you finding it here?” Steve asked, making conversation to distract the dragon from Tony’s food.
Steve smiled at that. “I didn’t quite know what to expect when your father called this morning and said you’d be meeting me in his place. But if we’re supposed to be on a date, then I was right to bring this.”
We’ve just got one final chapter to go now! I can’t believe it! I wanted to aim to have it done in three weeks but am not in a great place right now in real life, so am going to need a wee bit more time than that. The last thing I want to do is to rush things. I really want to give this story a satisfactory close. Thank you for your patience! 😛
In his chair, with the ornate arms that rose on both sides and a back that was tall with carvings, Steve liked to imagine himself on the
It was late afternoon when Lord Strange entered the bedroom through a portal, with Thor and Loki behind him. Having managed to avoid the drizzle outside, the trio arrived relatively dry, albeit soaked in perspiration and blood.
Wordlessly, Steve took his hand and guided him back to the ballroom, making a beeline for Natasha who was conversing with Agent. Tony sank into the empty seat beside Natasha, still shaking from the shock as he attempted to listen to Agent persuade Steve against impulsive behaviour of any kind.
The sound of footfalls, too soft for Steve’s boots, caused his ears to prick up. It was followed by firm rapping against the wooden door. “Coming!” Tony shouted as he threw on his clothes and smoothed his hair. He took a deep breath and cracked the door open.
Enchanted, Tony hadn’t noticed the dragon looming, all poised to attack. A full-grown dragon - and he never even hesitated. He was a prince, bound by duty to defend the innocent. Besides, there was no stopping ten-year old boys from charging in front of dragons, not when they believed they were just as brave as the knights in their bedtime stories.
"I thought I was protecting you. But I can see now - that I was just protecting myself. I wasn’t strong enough - to come to terms with what you've been through. And I let you down. I'm sorry.”
“Didn’t know dragons ate sandwiches,” Steve shouted and threw the shield at Ivan, but managed only to chip a sea stack.
That was one way of putting it. “Ideally, what would we have done?” he asked, curious about how people in Steve's time used to go about doing things.
Howard had made plans to meet the young omega to thank him for his help, and now that he'd finally got the reluctant young man to agree on a place and time, he just had to come down with a "bad cold" that made it “impossible” for him to honour the 4 o’clock appointment that he "couldn't postpone". There were more holes in the story than the vigorous game of golf his convalescing father had played that very morning, and Tony wasn’t naive, so he knew exactly what Howard was playing at.
The spell summoned durable bands, which bound the trolls and stone-giants to one another, and made it increasingly challenging for them to move.
Rhodes chuckled as he answered the question. “Sir, the prince is one of the best riders in the kingdom. You’ll see. He’s got a very impressive seat.”
Steve’s eyes flitted over to the swans. “I think we would dance. And maybe, if you wanted, I would kiss you.”
“It was me,” Steve said, feeling melancholy all of a sudden. His destiny had always been tied to Tony, but he would just be one of Tony’s many encounters as part of his long life.
basement was the one place in their home which Steve had politely asked Tony to stay away from. Tony tried to go in once, when Steve wasn’t home, but found it locked. With all the secrets he was keeping from Steve, he decided that it was only fair for Steve to have some of his own. But Steve was going to unlock it for him now.
Steve gazed back into those warm eyes and hesitated. This was his chance – to find out. He could clear things up if it was all a misunderstanding, or confirm his greatest fears.
Over the years, the stonemasons of Anguisia had employed arcane arts and sorcery to liquefy vast quantities of blackstone in construction of the castle, which stood proudly on top of an active volcano. Inside the volcano, liquid fire bubbled around secret stairs and shafts that led to the mountain’s heart, where it was said that only a real dragon could pass unscathed.
“He’s all yours,” he boomed as he shoved him in the middle of the civilians he’d been about to murder. It was pretty clear he wasn’t going to live happily ever after.
Adding to this epiphany was the truth about Tony’s medallion. Neither a token of love nor the source of Tony’s powers, it was merely a contraption to suppress Tony’s powers, for him to hide amongst his peers, without fear of retribution, and that had even extended to Steve.
He must have let the strain show as Bruce was looking over in concern. “It’s the last one,” he told him, with a reassuring smile.
“Do something fun with me?” he asked. He's been cooped up at home for so long. He could very well do with a night out.
Tony blinked at the simple, clean lines. Utilitarian. White walls, white flooring, white furniture, white sheets. A blank canvas on which to paint their new lives.
“No, you’re not,” Steve interrupted his ramble, smiling affectionately at him. “I love you like this. I don’t want you to change.”
Tony watched, amazed, as the pieces of his armour came flying through the broken window toward him. The left repulsor glove was the first to attach itself to his ring, before the left arm plates. Then the chest plate came on, and the right arm plate too. The right repulsor glove was next, followed by the thigh guards and jet boots. The helmet linked itself up from behind. Tony never saw it coming. Finally, the face plate came on, attaching itself smoothly to the helmet in the flipped-up position.
By the time he reached the end of the page, his knuckles had turned white. “I don’t understand, Director. I thought I did okay.
“You’re mine,” Steve echoed. “I promised to keep you safe. I pledged this to your parents, swore it at our wedding. You don’t belong in a battlefield, Tony. You’ll be safe at home.”
“You have my word. Now, please get on the boat,” Tony added, and the urgency had crept into his voice as he spotted Ivan heading their way.
They had to change their plan of attack, so Tony tossed the solution at Steve. Steve read his mind, the chemistry between them negating the need for a bond.
Sarah had never been a particularly religious woman, but Steve had heard her in those bleak moments with him at death’s door, pleading with the gods as she offered her life in exchange for his.
Please note that very bad stuff happens to Tony here (because of bad people, not Steve). It's Afghanistan stuff, very similar to what's in the Iron Man film but please proceed with caution.
He sighed in appreciation as he observed Steve descending from the hatch, not even bothering with a parachute.
I had a really hard time writing their reconciliation. It was a huge struggle for me to describe Steve’s remorse without him being too OOC. I’ll let you be the judge on this one. Is Tony being too nice? Does Steve not deserve forgiveness But they have to end up together?
It was a beautiful summer evening with clear skies, so making out the constellations had been somewhat of a breeze.
He followed Tony towards the dining table, where the parts of the turntable were laid out. “Ah. I see. You broke the stylus.”
The palladium was a core for a miniaturised arc reactor. It would keep the shrapnel out of his heart. Buy him time. If his Math was right, and it always was, it could generate three gigajoules per second. That could run his heart for fifty lifetimes.
“How,” he asked, as he looked pointedly at Thanos’ purple claws, desperately sucking cool air into his lungs while he tried, but failed, to get to his feet. “You’ve only – got four.”
He couldn't see the steel backing, but he knew the words, engraved them himself. He wondered how many times Steve read those words, as he searched for him, all over the world.
Tony bit back a smile at the idea of Steve needing his protection. He was a brave and mighty king. And if he ever needed assistance, his little roundtable of trust, were clearly up to the task. Whatever difficulties they ran into, Steve could always count on Bucky's sword, Clint's bow, Nat's spear and Sam's axe.
This includes some mention of dubious medical practices /quackery inspired by historical medical treatments. I have no idea how accurate they are, except that I came across those examples a number of times when I did research and they happened to fit the story, so... please ignore any inaccuracies. Thank you very much!
“Yeah?” Steve asked, clearly pleased. When Tony nodded, he asked, “We could arrange to spend summers at your home. Would you like that?”
Tony stole a quick glance as the captain recited his vows, promising to love, cherish and protect him. In response, Tony vowed to love, respect and trust him. Tony didn’t write the vows. He just had to repeat them after the minister.
Thanos let out a heavy sigh. “I see you’ve made your choice. But did you think it through? These humans, frail and weak, with no magic to wield, will come to an end – sooner rather than later.”
Three of the large beasts swooped down, heading their way, no doubt having seen the remains of their fire. Tony clenched his fists. There had been several dragon sightings of late. After the Battle of Shieldberg Bay, the children of Thanos had settled for raiding their mountains, forests and beaches, trailblazing everything in their path in search of those elusive gems.
Ivan smirked as he lunged for Steve and picked up the king before either of them had time to react. The dracastrom held a struggling Steve in the air, cursing loudly as Steve struck his knuckles with his shield. “Remember now?” Ivan growled, as he swung a sparking tail terrifyingly close to Steve's face.
“No one quite knows how Rex came to be. Some say that six elemental crystals collided in space, creating a magic egg, and out of this egg, Rex was hatched. The elements bent to his will, allowing him to manipulate fire, water, wind and lightning at his command. He could hide in plain sight, influence others, take down a whole kingdom in one night. You’d never see him coming.”
“Why would it be?” Steve asked, eyebrows furrowed together into a little knot. “I have no grudge against your kind. I mean, sure, dragons are terrifying, in general. But I could never be afraid of Tony - or you.” With a faraway look in his eyes, Steve continued, “Tony would be a dracafyre, like you, with all of his burning ideals and his passion for life. His wings would be magnificent, yet light and powerful. He wouldn’t stop making weapons. Yeah, he'd just use his powers to make them instead. Tony would know better than anyone else – how there’s no furnace hotter than a dracafyre’s mouth.”
“Same way I knew you were going to make it, despite what they said. It’s how I knew that you would one day grow to be tall and strong, just like your father, and burn brightly above as you leave your mark.”
Tony swallowed painfully, already missing his sweet husband. “Good. I don’t want to throw up on your - ” were his last words before the suit began to freeze and communications became patchy.
Natasha had to attend a committee hearing on Capitol Hill, basically told the government to kiss her ass. Bucky attended hearings of his own, and was pardoned for his crimes while acting under HYDRA’s control.
When the music stopped, Steve rolled over, engaging the assassin in a different sort of deadly dance, which Tony watched with a white-knuckled grip on the edge of his seat.
The beast looked dazed, slumped on the deck, so Tony moved in as he carefully shielded his eyes with the blade of his sword. “Tony, no,” Steve whispered, as he held him back.
“Don’t do anything stupid till I get back,” Bucky said softly, as he placed his hand at the back of Steve’s head.
“Well. I really wouldn’t know now, would I?” Steve said, smiling fondly back at him as he squeezed his hand.
Tony was just happy to be done with the meeting and was looking forward to some peace (even though it was going to put them out of business). He needed time to reconcile the sweet husband he married with this new Steve, who acted like a playground bully.
Over meat-filled wraps, they went a round, evaluating the events of the day. Widow, ever efficient, had completed her objectives, getting hold of Loki’s sceptre to close the portal. Hawkeye delivered as their eyes and arrows on top of the roof. Thor and the Hulk, their heavy hitters, were credited for annihilating close to 80 per cent of Chitauri fleet. Going by the news that was pouring in, Cap had rescued close to a thousand grateful civilians. And Iron Man had filled the gaps, providing support whenever and wherever it was needed. So, Tony was chided, then thanked, and hugged, for his heroic act of taking the nuke through the wormhole.
The name, spoken aloud, was the password to the safe in Steve’s heart and the stories, like treasured gems, were soon tumbling out.
“Thanos resurrected them,” Clint muttered, with disgusted realisation, as the rest of the knights looked uneasily at one another.
“That’s it,” Steve said, having to raise his voice above the ruckus. “You’re crazy. My knights. The most celebrated warriors in the kingdom. And all of you are mad.”
“It’s not so hard,” she said, smiling cheerfully at Tony over the rim of her teacup. “Compromise when you can. And when you can’t, don’t.”
“Schellehead,” Steve said, and stopped to gaze at an imaginary spot behind Tony’s shoulder. “We should go over the strategy,” he added.
“That’s the horn of Rex Divinus,” Thanos sneered, when he recognised the blade’s unique curvature and hue. “How dare you try to use it?”
“We’re the guardians of the nine realms, the keepers of the stones,” Thor said, as he gave them a meaningful look. “Dragonstones,” he elaborated, when they continued to stare blankly at him. “I understand that three of them have recently come into your possession.”
“Tony,” Steve said, and frowned at him like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “Because then, it allows me to walk through those doors and do what I was meant to do. And the one thing that would really help me focus in there is the knowledge that you're going to make it back home - to him."
Obie stared uneasily into the mouth of the cave. “You first,” he said and pushed Tony ahead of him, keeping his sharp talons against his back.
“Meeting room in ten. Bring Barton. It’s just us three,” he said. “And Iron Man,” he added, after giving Tony a look. “We’re a little short-handed. You can help, right?” he asked.
Tony felt dizzy, and he was seeing stars, so Steve guided him toward a stump, which brought him back down to earth.
“Yeah. Well. Tony, if you want, we can file an annulment,“ Steve offered, filling in the awkward silence. "But only if it’s what you want,” he added, softly.
The messenger squinted and peered closely at Natalia. “But this one is Anguisian. Yes, I remember you, the Black Widow. Why aren’t I surprised to find you behind enemy lines? After all, you have always been a woman of many talents,” he said, gesturing to her body in an insult.
Steve barely heard a word above the blood roaring in his ears. He stumbled backward, and felt the desperate need to escape. “I have to go,” he said and thrusted the basket at the dragon.
“The Infinity Spell,” he gasped through his shallow breaths, and Bruce had to hold him steady to keep him from falling.
“Does it now?” she asked, flipping him onto his back in one move. And before Bucky could say a word, she hit him softly, on his mouth, with her own, subduing the breathless knight with her superior mouth-to-mouth combat skills.
Sitting on one of the steps, Wanda shared her findings. “Lo eza gnoleje hen doron, issa syrje ruarza, kostilus leda se gaomagon hen magi.  Issi olvie kostoba spiel - cast ondoso ia kraj soceri.”
Steve sighed. “You know, I was afraid you were going to say that,” he said, as his cheeks turned pink. “Be careful out there,” he mumbled, before he turned to face the rest of his troops.
A relatively hardy tree, the heartewoode would keep growing and if they were blessed, it would one day bloom and bear fruit. Life would go on, with or without Tony, whether or not Steve wished to be a part of it.
“I wonder – what happened to that precious little boy,” Tony said, and looked up at him with what looked dangerously close to fondness.
helicarriers would scratch those people, anyone deemed a threat to world safety, off the list, a few million at a time. It was baffling. Didn’t the punishment come after the crime?
They knew their teams. They knew their missions. For most of them, it was to get the people and get them out, preferably deep into the Fangthorn Forest, where they would be safe. And while all that was happening, Tony’s team would find Thanos and bring an end to his cruel reign.
Upon hearing the light footsteps padding into the cave, Tony quickened his pace, his head spinning. He had to get to the medallion before Steve found him. And there was still the problem of his clothing, which had ripped when he had changed.
Earlier that day, Tony had waved at the team from the window of the quinjet, with Iron Man clearly visible in the seat behind. Then, Tony put on the suit, dropped out of the escape hatch and flew by the Malibu mansion before heading right back for the Avengers Tower, as Iron Man this time.
The members of the World Security Council looked uneasily, at each other, then at Pierce. While Steve’s speech drew loyal agents to their cause, it also alerted the enemy of their plans.
Steve looked at him as though he’d lost his head. “Normally, I’d agree,” Steve said as he gripped his hand tightly. “But we’ve seen the damage these beasts can cause. There’s no other way out.”
The frost dragon landed beside him in a rush of wings. “Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony!” he said. “Tones!”
Happy was beside him in a moment, taking in his tearful expression and the bags he’d packed in anticipation of this outcome. “Do you need me to find you accommodation?” he asked.
Tony did, however, find something else. A silver box, with a glass cutout. On it were etched the words: PROOF THAT TONY STARK HAS MY HEART
“You’re brave, Tony. And very strong. I’m so proud of you and everything you’ve done. But, listen to me, you don’t have to do this anymore. You’ve saved the world, ridded it of its monsters. The suit is a nuclear deterrent. And we can take it from here.”
Jarvis stopped what he was doing, shielding his eyes from the sun’s glare. “Mr Perkins is currently, or might I say, perpetually, busy running after your father’s flamingo. So, the task of managing the gardens has fallen on our shoulders.”
They clashed in a tangle of wings and talons, and Rhodey and Killian sought each other out in a dance of ice and fire, leaving Tony and Peter to battle Ivan.
So, Tony directed his efforts toward locating Steve and Nat. He found them speeding down the freeway towards Fury’s crash. Tony’s hand flew over his mouth when the same masked man, who attached Fury, landed on the roof of their car, shooting through the roof directly at Nat.
Noting his weakened state, Bruce offered him a small glass containing a concoction of boosters, which included a few precious drops of dragontears. “Here,” he said. “This will help you feel better.”
"The activation of Extremis in her system. In this state, her heart rate doubled and there was a massive spike in adrenaline. Oddly, at the end of the episode, her skin was noticeably cold. I took a sample and compared it to those previously taken. The Extremis chemical signature now shows up in her bloodstream.”
Steve was willing to give it a try if it meant avoiding hours of morning sickness.  Jarvis filled the bath. He shed his clothes and wrapped a towel around his waist.
"In a few weeks." They'd have to get used to living with an infant before they allowed others near her. Even Rhodey.
Winter went to the door, glancing back at the child. He wanted to stay. Winter leaned against the doorway waiting.
Tony allowed Steve to pull him away. They slid into the nesting couch, together. Neither of them slept, only quietly lying next to each other, waiting for sleep to wash over them.
Tony enjoyed the brisk air against his face. The silence allowed him to think clearly. He'd been out here for over an hour. It shouldn’t have gone this way. They should have Winter. He’d seen what Steve could do, but in his current condition, he didn’t stand a chance. Steve had the '
The only time she got junk cereal was when Papa was on a mission, and even then, it was rarely for breakfast. It was either lunch or dinner. Papa gave Daddy a scary look whenever he caught Daddy sneaking her sweets.
“You’re small enough to be one.” She still had pride. It was a useless thing to have here. He slid a piece of bacon through one of the vents in the class.
She failed in so many ways. How could she not have noticed until now?! Not only had she failed herself. But worse than that, she’d failed her friends. That was unforgivable. She couldn’t let that stand. Her arm shot up, grabbing the rod as it moved to strike her again.
At eight, Steve went to the kitchen. Pepper, Maria, and Rune were already there. Someone had made waffles and there was enough batter left for more.
"I don't know how to answer, sir. I'm incapable of being in the situation you currently find yourself in. Even though I can't give specifics to such a hypothetical scenario, I can assume I'd do what you're currently doing."
Steve was mentally drained. There were only ten minutes left in the session. All he wanted to do was cuddle up with Piper.
Tony flipped them, pinning his omega underneath him. He gave in to his instinct claim, setting a brutal place, only slowly when the felt his omega contracting around him. He sunk his teeth into Steve’s neck right as they reached the release. Tony collapsed onto Steve. He slowly came out of the haze.
This was her first encounter with a feral alpha but she thought they'd have a basic understanding of simple words. What happened to him to make him like this? He returned to his corner.
Natasha smiled softly. "I can name at least ten reasons why you deserve her. You're too hard on yourself. Be selfish. Enjoy this part of your life."
Hill hated this part of her job. She had to hide things from her mate. But she tried to be as honest with Pepper as possible. The omega was the best thing to ever happen to her. She didn't know why such gorgeous omega would take an interest in a beta.
Tony collapsed, almost unable to support himself on his knees, he shook so badly. His heart constricted in his chest. He couldn’t breathe! His inner alpha roared in anger, fighting against him.
A beta nurse with sun-kissed skin came in. “I’m here to take out your staples. And I’ve brought you some clothes." Her hands were shaking. She turned pink when she got a full his chest. The nurse quickly got to work.
Steve growled. He might just have to beat some sense into his alpha at this point! “Yeah, big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?”
He wasn’t in the mood for this. The alpha rubbed his temples. A headache was coming on. Even with all their issues, he trusted her. He had to weather the storm.
Winter moved to the center of the sparring mat. Piper stayed at the edge. She’d watched Aunt Nat and Papa spare all the time, and had wanted to learn, but they’d said she was too young.
“I want to get out of here,” she said. Once she left, she wasn’t sure where she’d go. Where she wanted to be most, right now, was sitting in the comfy chair in her bedroom tucked against her Papa's side. She shook her head trying to forget about them. "And you're coming with me."
“Probably dead, there were rumors about his family leaving Russia and immigrating to Slovakia. Not sure if there’s any merit to it.”
They settled on the couch. Tony turned on the TV every news channel was discussing the incident. The majority of people were for them. Steve saw the waitress from a café he went to thank him. There was a minority who were against him.
Tony yawned. He wanted nothing more than to snuggle with Steve and sleep. Hammer nudged against his leg, offering clean clothes. He took a fresh shirt and shorts from the basket. Tony got himself another cup of coffee, bracing himself for the upcoming onslaught of conversation.
"Currently, they are downstairs. Piper has successfully breached its dummy firewalls you’ve set up.”
He reached his hand out her, shocked when he felt her tiny hand wrap around his fingers. Papa pulled her close. He put her on the deck first before climbing out himself. They were both covered in mud and stunk of distress.
He hoped some wisp of the only good he’d committed would remain. If it could even be considered that; training a child to do acts not meant for the mind of one so young. But it was the closest he'd ever come. Even the remembrance of the feeling would be enough for him if he couldn't recall the circumstances.
Steve smiled. He looked over the bites marks coloring Tony's shoulders. They'd faded enough for him not to worry about. "Sorry about those."
"Don't worry, I can't control it. It responds to your hormone and pheromones levels and those around you. Protects from undesired bonding. Stark Industries has made thousands of them. But yours is unique. Hopefully, you'll never have the opportunity to discover them."
Steve was too tired for words. Tony backed off. He gathered a few pastries before returning the sanctuary of his room. This time leaving the door unlocked. He doubted the alpha would join him. Steve wasn't sure if he even wanted him too. His night was spent staring up at the ceiling, unable to sleep.
Tony forced back his feral mind frame. He wanted to enjoy this. Tony licked the wet dripping slit, causing the omega whimper. Before Steve could whine Tony mounted the beautiful being. He slid in with one thrust he sunk into that wonderful tight heat. Steve cried out in pleasure. Instinct drove him into a brutal pace. It was too powerful to fight he need to clearly mark the omega as his.
Edith pulled a machine toward the examination table. Steve sat edging away from the table. His hand resting protectively over his stomach.
“You may prove a good influence on him,” said Pepper. Her anger faded. Steve was just as kind and considerate as books and articles about him said. He truly meant what he said, which made him pairing with Tony all the odder.
“Not worried, Piper. Only aware of your violent creativity. It would be foolish for me to underestimate it.”
“It was the same way with me and Bucky. He treated me differently after I had my first heat. Buck, became overly protective of me didn’t treat me like he used to,” said Steve.
He studied the map before tapping his fingers against Denmark. She didn’t know much about the country maybe that’s a good thing. She went to one of the large stacks of books. They’d accumulated over time. Lena kept giving them to her and bother with taking them back. She pulled a geography book from the bottom of a stack.
The bear reared onto its hind leg, roaring. With its massive paw, it swatted him effortlessly through a large tree. Steve charged at the bear, hitting its flank at full speed, sending it to its side. Its jaws locked around on his shield, the leather straps couldn’t take the stress and ripped. His shield was flung away. The bear squared off with him. Its glowing green eyes focused on him. A mixture of blood and drool oozed from its mouth. It reared up onto its hindquarters, snarling. Steve jumped for the beast’s neck. Its claws sunk into his back, tearing at his flesh. He climbed to the head of the beast. His legs clung around the bear’s neck. The bear tried throwing him with no success. It fell onto its back, in an attempt to crush him. Over thirteen thousand pounds of muscle landed on him. Steve grunted. One arm kept the bear pinned. He grabbed a grenade from his belt and forced it into the beast's mouth. Steve clamped the bear’s muzzle shut. There was an explosion as the bear’s stomach blew out. It went limp. Steve went to help his team. They’d been tossed around like rag dolls. He ran for his shield, tossing it at the bear nearest Natasha.
Any lingering fear dissipated in the safety of the alpha's embrace. Tony eased him through the terrors, never judging him. They fell asleep in each other's arms.
The next one was a more familiar style, which Steve instantly recognized as a Harley. The bike next to it really took Steve’s attention. It was painted a deep blue with brown leather seating and saddlebag. He got in the seat it was perfect.
Steve was in the master bedroom trying to get things. There was sharp cramping pain in his lower back. Then he realized what his making. The startings of a large nest stood before him. No, these had to be Braxton Hicks contractions. He went to the kitchen normally when he ate false contractions came to an end. The cramping returned. Instinct urged him to return to his nest making. He was certain he was entering the early stages of labor.
Lena assessed, and realized she hadn't broken the girl completely, but she'd cracked her foundation. All she had to do was wait for the perfect moment to strike. Pushing too hard now may have the opposite reaction than she was aiming for. She pulled a drawer, taking out fresh clothes for the girl.
She had no idea what he was thinking. Piper was too occupied with the wooden magnetic blocks. She was obsessed with them, unable to figure out how they stuck together. They were big enough for him not to worry about her choking on them. About ten minutes later hunger overcame her interest.
Steve took a breath. He had to call Tony without sending him into a panic. Steve slowly lowered himself into a chair. There was no way of doing this without panicking him. He called his mate.
Steve watched as Tony made a dirty martini. He yawned and settled down in the corner of the couch. Steve nuzzled into the fabric. He found a soft blanket, using it to hide his bare chest, much the alpha’s apparent dislike. His eyes started closing.
Steve did his best to keep that burden of his PTSD away from her. Piper would have so many expectations placed on her for the sole reason of her being their daughter. She was unaware of it now, but soon enough she would take notice. It was unfair, but that was the world. He could only protect her from so much. Steve could at least keep her safe from that part of himself.
"I'm going to tell you this now it was your fault. Because I know you'll find some idiotic way to blame yourself."
"I knew how to play rummy and spit before, and he already knew how to play those, so I didn't have to explain it to him. He taught me Durak.”
The deep, lustful tone of the alpha's voice sent a shiver down Steve’s back. From the window, he saw Tony flying in, and he remembered what Edith had said.
“I can’t erase the information, but I can block it from Sir until you’ve reached your destination. But I insist on you telling him that you are leaving. He may go into panic if you don’t. I don’t want that happening again,” said Jarvis.
Steve sat in bed. A nurse left a tray food on his table. He wasn’t hungry. The glass door opened. A woman dressed in pink flower scrubs came in. She wore pink flower earrings. A fellow omega. She smiled gently at him. Steve pushed the tray aside. He wasn’t in the mood for visitors. All he wanted was a few days, maybe a week to pull away, not deal with the emotional strain of keeping up appearance. Then he could handle being with humanity again.
He didn't know what to say to convince her. Her own words should be enough. But her mind seemed set against them. Maybe one day, if she were lucky, she would find out just how much they missed her. He hoped that day would come. The pup crawled into bed pulling the blankets over her head.
“What’s there to understand? You want to play with your fucking toys more than you wanted to be with me!” screamed Pepper.
"It's a piece of shit I know, but I thought we could rebuild it together. Do you like it?” asked Tony. Steve didn’t answer.
His eyes locked on the target, watching as Smith failed to impress the omega working the bar. Watching the man gave no answer to why the alpha was his assignment. There wasn't much to Smith. Winter had taken out far more difficult targets. Why had he been sent after someone so low rate? Odd, but it wasn't his place to question a mission. He’d prefer something more in line with his abilities.
“We’ve got to make a decision we can either save the president or Steve and Pepper. We can’t do both,” said Rhodes.
Winter was forced to return from the nothingness at the pup's mention, but he didn't react. He was meant to listen unless told otherwise. And he knew he hadn't failed Piper. He'd done all he could for her.
"We can't go back to the penthouse," said Steve. It would probably be best for Piper to adjust in an environment with which she was already familiar, but the press would be relentless once they discovered she'd been found. Their frenzy wouldn't be conducive to healing.
He tried coming closer but Tony backed away. The motion of rejection revealed how deeply Tony was hurting.
Natasha stood in the elevator of Stark Tower. What was she about to walk in on? The last thing she wanted to see was Steve bent over the counter with Tony behind him.
Piper hugged him. Winter returned the gesture. If he died now, he would die happy, doing something good. The blue light dimmed from her skin. She went limp in his arms.
Tony nodded. He’d hired a nurse and some of the best doctors to watch over his aunt. After this, he would check in on her progress with the doctors. After all, the woman had done for him, paying for her expenses was the least he could do. Tony leaned against the counter, waiting for the kettle to come to a boil.
“Tony, that’s a one-way trip.” He kept his voice strong. This had to be done, but the price being given would forever take a toll on him and their child.
Rhodes didn’t know what to say. There was no magical balm to soothe this over. He squeezed Tony’s shoulder. His words would do nothing. A very sweet, almost chemical scent touch Rhodes’ nose. Both alphas instantly tensed. Rhodes took several steps away from Tony. Giving him time to run if needed.
The alpha seemed frozen for the moment. Steve laughed at his stunned expression. He sat up and kissed Tony, bringing him out of his shock.
In his hand was a debriefing packet. Steve sighed. At least, he’d had a few minutes of normal with Tony.
How could she believe that? With a mind as talented as hers, why would she waste her thoughts on the idea that someone was looking for him?
“You need men in these buildings. There are people inside that are going to be running right into the line of fire. Take them to the basement or the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far as 39th,” said Steve.
“I’ve let you close. Why you think you need to keep a secret I don’t know, but fine. For our sake I hope you tell me soon,” said Tony.
It was an attempt to lighten the mood. Seeing Steve turned a deep shade of red normally got a smile out of her. Steve blushed.
They crossed a glass bridge from the parking garage into the building. It was smaller than he thought for such a highly rated hospital.
“I’m not in. I’m actually out,” said Tony. There were soft clinks as mechanical arms removed his armor. Steve maintained his smile, even at the mention of Agent Coulson's name. A few more minutes, that’s all he wanted.
Tony was caught off guard. It wasn’t often someone was able to do that. When omegas or alphas went into such feral state words beyond alpha or omega were exceptionally difficult. He took off his helmet. Steve calmed greatly at the site of his face. His posture relaxed.
“The youngest is starting her first year of high school. There are pictures on the fridge,” she said.
Tony laid a soft blanket on the floor and spread a few toys out on it. He took Piper setting her down on the blanket. She tried crawling toward a plaything of interest. Piper was figuring out crawling, so she didn't get too far.
Piper suppressed a groan. This was going to be so boring. He stacked several large equally boring books focusing on the Revolutionary War. The text seemed to thoroughly cover each battle, major player, and strategy used.
"How did you come to that conclusion?" asked Tony. His finger clutched angrily at his seat, knowing he may not like the answer.
"Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist, rich guy handsome type. I couldn't make his face at first. You know I'm good with faces."
“Let me.” Steve quickly helped his mate, his hands stopping at the shirt’s collar, fingers tracing over the fresh mark he’d left there. He nuzzled against it, tenderly lapping at the wound.
Steve threw off his shirt, revealing his near-flawless skin. Natasha noticed the shimmering silver necklace gracing Steve’s neck. She took cotton swaps from the first aid kit and started cleaning the wounds.
"If I don't make him eat he won't at all. You scientists become so easily lost in your work you forget to eat," said Steve.
The guilt was clear in Steve’s expression. He didn’t believe he deserved to feel like this. When his knot down, they remained close. Steve carefully tended the fresh mark he’d left. He shivered as Tony returned the favor.
“Yet, he still has his positive qualities,” said Steve. He saw those flaws, but he’d also seen far more of Tony’s positive qualities.
Tony’s hand was between his legs, rubbing him with the perfect pressure causing him to moan. The phone dropped from between his shoulder.
Fury took a large stack of files from a suitcase. “These should tell you all you need to know on your team. Tomorrow you’ll meet Agent Coulson. If you need anything, ask one of the agents."
"Tony, I'm currently in the process of bringing our child into the world. Follow the understanding that I am always right until this pup is out of me. Got it!”
She whimpered. He started singing to her. When she fell asleep to the song, Tony took him off speaker.
He would have to tighten up security. Maybe buy a house somewhere out of the way to give his family some well-deserved privacy. It would be good for her to have a yard to run around in. Rebuilding in Malibu wasn't an option. Neither of them would feel safe there after what happened. He would have Jarvis look around.
“Yes, Steve I’m your boyfriend,” said Tony before yawning. It was nice to see how much the title meant to Steve.
Near the front door was a large oak tree with a tire swing. It was easy to imagine a life here. Is this where he would have lived if he survived? For the first time, the image of who he wanted to spend it with changed. He cut the bike’s engine and went to the large front door. Steve took a deep breath before knocking. It opened. He was caught in a tight hug. The power in those frail arms caught him off guard.
“My name is Piper Sarah Margret Stark. My friends call me, Pipes. You can call me that if you want.”
He wanted to go public but on their terms. Some idiot exposed them with a smartphone. He pressed against Tony.
The door unlocked with a clunk. He'd sworn never come back. But he had to think of the next generation. He pushed open the heavy wooden double doors. The lights flicked on as they entered.
“My mother Queen Elizabeth wanted to make sure you received this. She didn’t believe you would want the ceremony of a knighthood. And she sends her apologies for not being in attendance. She truly wished to be here,” said Charles.
“I won’t lie about anything important. My nightmares are mine. I don’t want to tell you if I don’t have to. There’s nothing you can do to make me,” said Piper.
“One of the techs at S.H.I.E.L.D. can fix that, or you could use it as an excuse to see Stark,” said Natasha.
“Put on the suit let’s go a few rounds,” said Steve. He was fully ready to do so. Tony needed to be brought down a few pegs.
"You're not alone! Millions have gone through what you have. It's war. This was flying into a wormhole with a nuc strapped to my back. There isn't a support group for what I saw up there. I'm not dragging you in with me," said Tony.
Piper sat at breakfast, stuffing her face with waffles. “Where are my papa and daddy?” she asked when Pepper came back to the kitchen.
A confused man dressed in a brown suit beat up suit came into view. Dr. Banner. Steve smiled at the sheer out of placeness of the man. He had thick black wavy hair. For all the strength and aggression hidden within him, he had gentle brown eyes. His scent was strong for a beta. Normally, their scents were muted. It was earthy with hints basil, but there was something off about it that Steve couldn’t place.
He collapsed onto the couch, letting the full extent of his exhaustion wash over him. That was the only thing that brought him back to his childhood. He’d scruffed Piper. It didn’t hurt pups but served as a gentle reminder of their place if they stepped too much out of line. But it could easily be abused. He fucking hated it when Howard did it to him, but he was alpha submission at any age went against their instincts. Piper may be an omega, but he was sure she didn’t enjoy it. What else could he do? He stared at the family portrait hanging on the wall. Chuckling at the idea of Howard would react to his life. He sighed.
“For his birthday, Howard hired Doris Day to sing. Apparently, the man was so tongue-tied he didn’t say a word. The photos are somewhere in storage,” said Tony.
It was the youngest of the nurses. He scowled at her. She mid-length curly auburn hair and gray eyes. Nothing about her was threatening. That wasn't reason enough to trust her.
Both tensed when the bolts to the door unlatched, barely easing their posture when Lena stepped in. Her expression held a higher degree of seriousness than normal. Whatever was coming was directly affecting her somehow.
“I’m mean I’m really happy to be back,” said Piper, trying to make up for her failed response. She just wished it was a place where she was welcome. “I’m happy to be back. It’s a lot better than that place. A lot of places are.”
He went to the bathroom and showered. Steve stopped in front of the mirror. He stared his reflection, glaring at the muffin top he’d formed. It was a first for him. He needed to hit the gym. Part of him was tempted to shave, but he doubted he had the time. He took Piper from Tony’s arm before she could start crying.
Steve nodded. Tony took his hand, leading him to the lab. He stayed at the entrance. Piper made a small cooing sound when Tony took her from the playpen and offered her to him.
Steve did. The collar retreated in width, returning to its original form. His tricket. Even when knowing what it was, he didn't want to remove it.
He gave a small nod of acknowledgment. She couldn't say good morning. It wasn't. “Good morning” would be waking up at home to the smell of her parents making breakfast. She wanted to cry but she had no more tears left.
“Charcoal, watercolors, and oil paints. Charcoal and watercolors were cheap. I loved oil paints but couldn’t afford them. That didn’t stop me from taking a chance and submitting a portfolio to Columbia for a chance of a full ride,” said Steve.
"You won't." He took the alpha's hands in his. "You're here Tony. If you ever need to remind yourself of that call on our bond."
“As a reminder of what caused this,” said Blackwell, placing a jar of shrapnel on the bedside table, then took his leave.
Tony and Steve hadn’t let anyone question their daughter. She doubted the fact she was one asking changed that.
He kept his head down as he walked toward the bar. Accidentally running into a woman. She'd dropped her wallet. He picked it up.
They loaded into two jets. Steve, Tony, Natasha, and five droids in one. Clint and Hill in the other with the rest of the droids. Even at full speed, it would take them twelve hours to get there.
It was too easy. Loki was too powerful to be beaten so swiftly. This was something he would want to play out. What was he planning?
It was difficult to keep the speed limit, but that was all part of the cover. Winter wasn’t made to raise any suspicion. An encounter with the local police for any reason could slow the mission. Before taking out the target he wanted to observe him. The asset went to an old alpha pub called The Water Trough.
When he didn’t respond, she made him make room. She climbed over his knees and elbow to settle against his chest.
In omegaverse, it normally only affects mated omega alpha pairs. Once the episode ends it leaves bruises over the scent glands in the neck and over the heart.
Steve was sensitive with pleasure. He pulled Tony kissed him, pushing his tongue into alpha’s mouth tasting himself there.
“Are you prepared, as you follow the path of marriage, to love and honor each other for as long as you both shall live?”
The order was ignored. His earbud had fallen out. Pepper took out the suit, ripping off its arm and putting it on. She punched Killian aside. Then kicked a weapon’s capsule setting off with a blast from the suit, finishing of Killian.
“Relatively little in the grand scheme of things. Several undercover operatives and a birth control diffuser,” she said.
She shook her head so Steve joined her on the floor. Piper offered him Plats, the platypus lovey Peggy gave her. Piper only offered up her treasured toy when she thought someone was having a bad day.
Tony’s arm wrapped around Steve’s waist. Steve purred into their kiss and relaxed. Finally, he could drop his guard. Today was the day. It was a massive weight off his shoulders.
He didn't respond, picking up the tray. She ate sitting across from him. The pup was staring intensely at his face. He wiped his mouth.
Tony looked it over. The imaging was poor, likely due to the shelter's location, at least a hundred feet underground. If he attempted to send a signal to activate the door remotely, it wouldn’t make through such thick layers of snow and earth.
“A month in, I bled out. When I regained consciousness, I was in a hospital. Doctors told me that trying to have a pup again would kill me,” said Steve, his voice stone.
"They're suffering. They have been for hours. And Pepper is a literal ticking time bomb," said Tony.
He continued through the building with little issue. Cautiously, he pushed open a set of double doors, with his weapon drawn. He pulled off his glove and moved further into the room. The monitors set up bared the Ten Rings’ symbol. One of the screens was frozen on an image from a recent attack.
Bucky always wanted him to be content. His friend thought well-off for him was a kind alpha who could take care and respected him, not on the battlefield fighting beside him. Bucky knew that he would fight for the lifestyle he wanted. With Tony, he’d found a balance. He didn't have to fight against Tony for how he wanted to live his life. With he didn't need an alpha to let him do something. He was free to do as he wished. Bucky would be happy for him.
"In an undisclosed location. Don't bother breaking into our system, Stark. You won't find her," said Natasha. She'd taken precautions against Stark. It pained her to do so, but it was necessary.
“I know the baser part of your mind that you try desperately to deny agrees. You’ll eventually come to accept what your inner alpha has to say. You should listen to it more often,” she said.
"It's been a long day. As much as I'd love to come home there are a few things I have to take care of here. I've finished my work but I think I have to meet with Dr. Turner." Tony would drop the concern or any complaint about him not being home by him dropping Turner's name.
“It was,” said Steve. Why couldn’t this wait one more night? He should be wearing that beautiful ring. He and Tony should be discussing the start of their family. It should have been a wonderful night.
The alpha nodded, going still as she approached. Piper examined the muzzle, brushing his hair away to get a better look, seeing his eyes clearly for the first time. Tension spread through him at the simple touch, as if he were expecting her to attack. His pupils were dilated, but a slim line of their pale steel held blue coloration. He quickly broke their gaze.
“Ah!" Steve exposed his neck further to the alpha demanding more. He cries out when Tony bites him hard enough to leave a mark, but not break the skin. “Tony!”
“Anthony was his greatest creation. He believed the boy capable of surpassing him and he has. Howard was so proud,” she said.
“It must have been difficult for him,” said Steve. He couldn’t imagine being separated from his mother at that age.
He went to the large farm sink. The window there looked on the playground. Rune was playing with the two betas. Steve struggled to rein in his jealousy.
Piper wanted to cry with sympathy, but tears were the last thing Winter wanted, so Piper forced them back.
They went into the kitchen. Tony noticed a shoebox on the counter. It was slightly beaten up on the corners and rattled slightly when he lifted it. Steve wouldn’t have brought it if weren’t important.
Thor nodded. He sparred a glance of blue-eyed omega. A fierce warrior indeed, there were too few omegas that were brave enough to stand against two alphas in mid-fight.
"She head of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s operation in North Africa. She worked ruthlessly to get the position,” said Natasha.
He purred. His eyes closed. Something cool was placed gently around his neck. There was a small click. If his ears weren't so sensitive, he was sure he would have missed the little muted sound. His fingers slid underneath the necklace. It was crafted from a knitted mesh of silver. The metallic substance was frigid against his warming skin. It was almost weightless.
S.H.I.E.L.D. ambulances pulled to the front, setting up a perimeter. Steve and Tony were loaded into one, Pepper and Maria in the other. They were driven to the nearest S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. They were rushed to the medical wing. Edith was waiting for them there.
The next morning they left for New York, enduring Piper’s wailing through the entire flight. All of them were relieved when the plane landed. After Piper’s feeding, Steve put her down for a nap. Tony got was just getting off his phone when he came into the kitchen.
He wasn’t sure if it truly was from their home or something his clothes had picked up during his journey. Still, he held on to it like a lifeline, his last connection to the life he remembered, the last of the threads holding him together.
Watching Tony smile, the air rushed out of lungs as his heart swelled to twice its size, which in turn caused his chest to puff up with pride. Even though that meddling sorcerer had assembled the sandwich, it was he and he alone who had prepared the ingredients.
They were speaking draconic, which Tony understood well enough, having assimilated Thanos’ proficiency in the language.
“Yes, according to my mother, who thinks that love isn't a feeling - it's a choice,” Tony said, laughing. "She met my father the day of their wedding, but they learnt to love each other. They made each other happy.”
“Hello, beastie,” Steve said, before he sprang, spear in hand, toward the spot between her eyes, piercing it with a satisfying squelch.
Steve swallowed nervously and nodded. “Yes,” he murmured, and fixed his eyes on Tony’s sleeping face.
Sniffing the air, Tony followed the trail of fresh air to find his way out. It was no mean feat, but good luck and an excellent nose put him on the right series of paths. Tony could see brief flashes of lightning from the threatening skies, so he knew he was getting close.
The stones glowed brightly before bursting into fire, and their rainbow beams flashed across the ceiling like auroras against the evening sky.
By the time the poultice was changed and Tony’s wounds were redressed, Steve was exhausted and in desperate need of some sleep himself.
“I do. I cried at your memorial,” he said, gingerly shaking the hand offered to him. “Hi -  Ho - How are you? How are you not dead? Loki’s glow stick went right through your heart.”
“There’s breakfast,” Steve said, and stretched out his arm toward the door in what he hoped was a welcoming gesture. “If you guys eat that sort of thing.”
“Not mad, my child. I do worry sometimes, yes,” she assured him, gently running her hand through his hair. “But you always make me proud.”
“Whatever she used to do, she's one of us now,” Clint added. "But you're trespassing in this city and on our land."
And maybe he could work on gear for the rest of the team, since he was depending on them to watch Steve’s six.
For some time, they watched the sunset from the cliff. Steve wished they could linger, but the light was fading and it would soon get chilly. They had to catch up to the cavalcade, and make camp for the night.
Steve gave him a look of exasperation, so Tony took advantage of his silence to go on. “What’s the worst that could happen? Even if we don’t get along, and end up hating each other, we can always file for a divorce. As long as we stay married till after our 25th birthday, we’d be off SHIELD’s radar – forever. Just think about that.”
Exhausted and lying in a real bed for the first time in days, Steve had fallen asleep fairly quickly and judging from the light in the room, it must have been for hours. Still, he made no move to leave the bed, happy to listen to the cheery voices from across the room, for the most part speaking the common tongue, with a smattering of Armestrian in the mix.
Before they could pull a sheet over the body, Agent Hill whisked him off into her SUV. She spoke over the phone in hushed whispers, stressing to someone that they were operating under “deep shadow conditions”. Finally, after hours of driving down unmarked lanes that were off the map, she pulled into a nondescript compound in the middle of nowhere, referring to it as
He attacked with cold precision, making multiple attempts to plunge the knife into Steve’s throat. Steve was very skilled (or very lucky). He never got hurt, and even managed to disarm the assassin, forcing him to drop his knife.
“What? No, Clint! Clint!” Nat shouted as they watched the monster’s tail whipping the archer across the deck, after driving an arrow up the serpent’s ass.
"Hey," he said, taking Steve's hands into his and forcing the sobbing alpha to look at him. "Hey, Steve, look here. It's going to be okay. I'm going to forgive you, all right?"
He never froze, not even when JARVIS warned him about a potentially fatal build-up of ice. “Keep going! Higher, further, faster!”
Steve and Loki had words, then Natasha and Loki had words. Loki obviously didn’t like the words because he shot a blast of blue at the quinjet, but Nat manoeuvred it expertly out of the way.
If his skin hadn’t been covered in scales, goosebumps would surely have formed. “Wow. Okay,” Tony said, trying not to shudder. “While I appreciate the thought of you pining after me, I have to ask. What do you want?”
Tony’s eyes moved upward, trying to keep the cold blood in his veins from freezing as he took in the boots, the uniform, the arm, and the iciest blue eyes he’d ever seen.
Tony lowered his head and laved gently at the wound. It took a while for Steve to relax, for the tension to flow out of his shoulders and his back. At one point, he closed his eyes and even allowed a soft purr to escape. Without needing to look, Tony could feel the wound shrinking as new tissue formed.
“Saving-the-world is the biggest cockblock of my life,” Tony grumbled. “Why - does it get to come first?”
He read the long list of names. It didn’t take long to find his, along with those of the Avengers. They were right at the top. Scrolling down, he found a lot more, some he recognised and others he did not.
It was an imposing tower, twice as tall as Ferrumarx, and perched on one of the tallest mountains Tony had ever seen. The only entrance into the castle was through the pair of high gates into the turret, in front of which was a wide expanse of mossy blackstone to serve as a landing pad.
It had begun as a hobby, with Tony forging small pieces of furniture to offer himself some comfort, but one thing led to another and before he knew it, Tony had built himself an iron fortress atop the highest mountain in the range, which provided him with the most magnificent of views.
But for Tony, they weren’t. He knew he shouldn't keep secrets from Steve. But he just wanted to keep him safe.
Tony’s face lit up each time he made a point in his fiery speech about obsidian’s effects against the armoured scales. If Steve could just reach over and touch him, he knew, for a fact, that his skin would be warm.
“I miss him too,” she admitted. “But my heart is full, knowing that he died for what he believed in, and as he took his dying breath, he knew just how much he was loved.”
There were the snippets of conversations, the heated debates that went on through the night, but underneath it all, the mutual respect was undeniable.
Going into battle, this was critical, as they were about to encounter some of the most powerful dragons in the seven realms, all with unique and remarkable abilities, and Tony wanted nothing left to chance.
Tony swallowed and stubbornly clenched his jaw, all the while blinking back tears. “I’m sorry,” he said in a broken voice.
“Tony, this isn’t what you’re supposed to be doing,” Steve said, as he lifted him onto his feet, squeezing his bottom through his jeans before giving it a firm smack.
A knock on the door had Steve shuffling to find Bruce outside, looking worn and dishevelled and clearly in need of rest, despite smelling of the fresh herbs he’d brought.
Later that evening, they met on the rooftop, softly lit by the moon and stars. Tony’s heart fluttered as the turntable, recently fixed, piped the notes from
“Disappointing my kids,” he sighed, oblivious to the mess he was making. “I’m supposed to go water-skiing.”
Steve scrambled back to where the group was beginning to gather around Nat. “Sam,” Steve called, watching from the corner of his eye as a tearful Tony attempted to yank the venomous fang from Nat’s stony arm. “We need to get her ashore.”
, and directed the mist at a small platoon of sea serpents near the stern of their ship before circling the perimeter.
“I had to wait for things to cool down with one over my covers. Didn’t want to get flabby, so Fury gave me a position as an instructor,” said Natasha.
“Just find the cube,” he ordered, leaving the room, so Tony and Bruce could continue their work. In a couple of minutes, they were joined by Natasha, then Thor and finally Director Fury himself.
Just one more to go before this all wraps up! Thank you for reading this! You guys have been amazing! :)
Relentlessly, the army of berserkers pushed them back, and it forced the Valorians to the very edge of the field. It was imperative for them not to retreat any farther. Once the enemy found their way past the last line of defence, they would make their way for the city gates.
“I need a minute,” Steve panted, tirelessly knocking out their adversaries before they could get close to Tony.
“It’s all mine,” Steve returned, very polite, in the voice he reserved for people he wanted to keep at a distance. “You planning to be here long?”
Their guests followed Steve into the house, and gathered around the dining table, while Steve and Tony found chairs and tableware to accommodate them.
“Captain," the director said. "We're just gathering everything related to the tesseract. It doesn't mean we want to make weapons.”
“In all my years of conquest,” the emperor’s voice boomed inside the tunnel, “it was never personal. But what I’m about to do to you, your king, and all your friends – I’m going to enjoy it very much.”
“So, that’s why they need iridium as a stabilising agent. So the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. And it can open as wide and stay open for as long as Loki wants-” Steve was saying, looking charming in his uniform as he spouted science stuff.
He scrolled through close to a hundred names and their affiliations, reading the accompanying notes before making the connections. Unlike what they’d been led to believe, those on the list weren’t a threat to world security. They were a threat to HYDRA. And the organisation had been growing within SHIELD this whole time.
Tony opened his mouth and closed it. He ought to tell Steve. Everything. From the day he’d been cursed leading up to right then. But Steve looked shaken and traumatised. And it had been a long day. He was going to wait for a better time.
"Gum?” Fury offered, after a pause, although he held out a flash drive, which Tony reluctantly accepted and slipped into the pocket of his jeans. Then, Fury sank down further in the armchair and closed his eyes.
“It requires at least one of each type of dragonstone – of that I’m sure. I don’t know the details, but Lord Strange or one of the Asgardians might be able to enlighten you on that.”
The mountain trembled, causing rocks to crumble and slide down the steep slopes. While vast spires of smoke billowed up, walls melted and crashed down. A loud rumble rose to a deafening roar as the mountain heaved and cracked.
To be honest, I'm a little insecure about this chapter because of how different it is. I hope it's okay and I'd love to hear what you think. But if you didn't like it, hey, here's a pretty picture of a ring!
On his other side, Tony was showing Bruce the best way to swing his new mace, one he’d made with cutting-edge anti-dragon technology, the lot of which he’d presented to Steve like some sort of dowry.
“Alpha locked,” Steve said over the comms, indicating that things were going well on his end. “Thor, report on the Hulk.”
“I was hoping to use it myself,” she told him, quietly. And there was no missing the consternation in her voice.
Thor grinned at his excitement. “It’s not just a story, my friend. It’s legend, and they ring with truth.”
He began to make out the silhouette of a man on the horizon. A distant figure approaching. The figure was running now.
Through the smoke and chaos emerged the hysterical cries of a young mother, whose concerned neighbours were preventing her from entering the building. “My baby, where is my Jenny?” she screamed, and Tony learnt of how she’d left her sleeping infant at home while shopping at the neighbourhood grocery store.
Tony trembled in Steve’s arms as he tried to process the devastating news. Steve didn’t offer him words of comfort, knowing that no words could ease the pain of a bereaved child. He just held Tony close as painful sobs racked his body and ripped him apart.
“AND. I. AM. IRON. MAN,” he answered, emphasising the words with repulsor blasts to Killian’s heart.
On the high throne of blue velvet and gilded gold, which extended sideways in the shape of wings to depict the royal eagle on the Valorian coat of arms was a hulk-sized giant of purple skin. He had a broad face, wide shoulders, with powerful arms and thick fingers, adorned with a total of five shimmering gems.
“Tones, I swear I didn’t expect to see you walking so soon,” Rhodey said, pulling him into an embrace, which he returned enthusiastically.
Agent Hill’s voice came over the public address system. “It’s a direct hit. Engine Three is down. All hands to your stations immediately.” Sounds of panic could be heard, as the crew scrambled to their stations.
It wasn't so long ago when the captain was a figure he read about in History books. He even did a project about him. He knew about his childhood struggles, the serum, the
They traded punch for punch, kick for kick, before the masked man pulled out a knife, flicking it expertly with practised ease.
I'm going to try to have the next chapter up in three weeks and the last one three weeks after that, but no promises, you know my situation. :p
Maria picked up on his distress almost instantly, so she expressed a desire to wait by the fireplace, inviting Tony to join her. Tony found himself warming his freezing hands with a cup of hot chocolate as he tried to catch up with his mother, whom he hadn’t seen for months.
“Hey!” Clint started to protest, but Nat placed her hand over his and looked pointedly at his wedding band, reminding him of his own responsibilities to his wife and children.
Tony put the car in park, but kept the air-conditioning going, thankful that he'd thought of installing a filtration system for the noxious fumes. Reaching for the bulky briefcase in the backseat, he fished out a kit for a pocket-sized atomiser and began assembling its parts.
He sighed, relieved, as the number of targets dropped from ‘645,427’ to just ‘3’, one of which they were standing inside of.
The propulsor boots had improved flight functions and stabilisers. His repulsors, micro-missiles, shoulder-mounted guns would neutralise threats. And for emergencies, there was the unibeam. The new armour, made of gold-titanium, was light but durable and would shield him from the threats of the world.
heat signatures with extreme prejudice. Do it. Now!” he ordered, as twelve injectors flew out, easily finding their targets. He used his jet boots and repulsors to his advantage, moving out of reach each time they came too close. The moment the soldiers stopped glowing, he took them out with a quick one-two of his repulsor blasts.
"A home sounds good," he croaked, over the lump in his throat, watching as Steve's face lit up against the darkening sky.
Tony laughed at Jarvis's attempt to delay the inevitable by presenting him as a troublemaker. “Do you agree?” he asked, curious about the sort of impression he'd made.
Steve opened the box and retrieved the wooden top, carefully positioning it above the cover of the box. When he gave it a little spin, it twirled in a joyful dance. Steve watched it spin on and on and on. He didn’t know how long he sat in the doorway as he watched the perpetual top spinning in time with his own thoughts. When he finally looked up, the stars were already fading against the dawning light. With a heavy heart, Steve shut the door and closed the windows.
Staring closely at the smoke trickling out of his nostrils, Tony mumbled the first words that came to mind. “Tony - he’s inside.”
The captain sighed, rubbing his temples. “Can we keep this conversation for tomorrow? It’s very late and there is so much we need to talk about."
Bucky caught up soon enough, and swung his sword at the riders as his horse drew close. “Three, four, five,” he grunted, counting the berserkers that fell by his sword.
“He found the heartstone, glowing bright purple, just floating in the air, and he had almost closed his fist around it when a strong force knocked him out of the way and into a tree.”
There were glad tidings to be shared. The construction of the East-West Pass had cut travel time between Ferrecita and the Mines of Auria into half, bringing estranged families closer.
Tony laughed and took no offence, as he knew just how much Steve adored the armour and sword and shield and everything that he made, and how he often made excuses to stay in the smithy to watch him work.
“Steve,” he cried, alarmed. “Do you have to be so dramatic? The suit is NOT the only thing I care about.”
A strange look came over the other man’s face and Tony had the inexplicable urge to explain himself. “Well – it’s nobody, really. He’s just a kid from Brooklyn. Some guy named –”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Steve said. “I’ve been told I’m headstrong, overbearing and sometimes, a bit dumb.”
Moments later, they were dressed in the technicians’ outfits (AIM T-shirts and lab coats), which were frankly quite comfortable. Tony slipped his ginormous backpack inside the trolley. Then, they breezed through the building in their disguises, finally saying their goodbyes at the lift lobby.
Steve found himself laughing along. “It’s one of our traditions,” he explained. “It supposed to represent the start of a new journey - together.”
“Friend Stephen! This is my brother Loki, prince of Asgard, god of mischief, master of deceit,” Thor continued, beaming brightly as he stepped aside to reveal a man with an impressive set of horns.
The scales on his arms began to vanish, and turned back into his honey brown skin, which was the welcome result of a few days of bathing in the sun. He felt the horns receding into his head, the teeth getting shorter, and his tail disappearing into his body.
Using the same arm, which was supposed to be trapped between Tony’s teeth, the emperor punched Rhodey and dislodged the knight’s jaw. With both arms now free, Thanos easily pulled out the sword in his neck, and flung it into the blackstone pillar just behind Steve, where it remained trapped.
“I’m always going to be there for you. If you want me, if you need me, you know I’ll be there,” he promised, very quietly, and that earnest expression was back on his face.
“Obie?” he gasped, as his mouth fell open. The last time he’d seen the disgraced knight, some ten years ago, he had
For a quick moment, Steve considered pursuing the retreating armada, to strike while the iron was hot and declare a firm victory.
“That was me, even if you hadn’t known it then,” Tony said, as he remembered how Steve had ridiculously thought he was in love with his dragon self at some point. “Even when I thought you hated me and wished I’d never come, I could never keep away.”
“Our?” Thanos echoed, and Rhodey dropped in from above them, taking advantage of the emperor’s surprise to leave a number of long, deep slashes down his purple back.
Nothing from Steve. He opened their conversation to check that he hadn’t missed anything. Tense fingers hovered over the keypad as he considered sending a note before he tapped the
“No,” Steve said, so vehemently, that it startled him because this wasn’t just being on a different page, it felt like they were reading a different book.
“Steve!” Tony roared. His heart stopped while he watched a fearless Steve making the harrowing trip toward his shoulders, almost falling several times as he balanced precariously on the ridge of the dragon’s back.
“I'm terrified. Of holding you back. Or ruining your life. It's not going to be easy being my husband. It's never going to be easy. And this wasn't what you wanted. At least not in the beginning."
But Tony couldn’t sleep, not when he had something to say. He had to say it, even if it would cause an implosion that would lead to an infinite gravitational warp- a blackhole.
“Why would any of you think I’d hurt Tony?” Steve asked, exasperated and hurt. “You’re my friends too!’
Loki paused for a few dramatic seconds, as he waited for all eyes to be on him. He began his tale, speaking softly, eloquently, in a voice full of drama and suspense. As he spoke, he moved his hands, and brought his words to life in a display of bright colours and lights.
Tony gasped as Steve stepped into the light, his face covered in gashes and scrapes. Tony would later find out a couple of ribs had been broken too. “What happened to you?”
“Yes, but your door was open, so I assumed that…” Strange trailed off, as his eyes darted between the main door and Tony. “You wanted to know when help was coming.”
Tony staggered from the impact, and tried to steady himself as panicked screams swirled around him. Summoning whatever remained of his strength, he channelled his power into a steady jet of the hottest fire and directed it all to the middle of Thanos’ chest.
“Your body is telling me to do the exact opposite,” Killian breathed, tightening his hold. “I am going to have so much fun with you, you little slut."
Water. It trickled, then gushed, into his nostrils, down his trachea. His nasal passages and throat swelled up from the constant coughing. His chest felt like it was about to burst.
Like the caterpillar, ignorant of how it's devoured its last leaf, he was carried, unconscious, into the cave, shrouded in secrecy and hidden amidst the mountains.
“Oh,” Steve mumbled in a mixture of embarrassment and relief. “I do love chocolate – and films and – everything you said, but I shouldn’t – I can’t. I have to be up early tomorrow.”
Steve frowned at Tony’s bedroom door, which remained closed as a wave of irritation coursed through his body. He resolved to have words with Lord Strange to tell him in no uncertain terms to release Tony at a decent hour from now on, dragon training be damned.
“No,” Steve repeated, and cupped Tony’s small face between his large hands. “Stay on the cliffs. We need you and your men to work those ballistas. Keep your distance. Don’t put yourself in the line of fire.”
Thanos smirked. “That’s still four more than you,” he said, before he brought his forearms together in a thunderous clap.
Thor was already on the helicarrier when they got there. Taking Loki, he followed Director Fury to a super-secure glass capsule to interrogate his brother about the Chitauri threat.
Apart from the ring, there was no other sign he was married. He fingered the smooth skin on his neck, wondering how it would look and feel like marked. And if it ever would be.
Sadly, time was running out. It was just months until his 25th birthday, which was all the time he had to find a mate. Failing to do so would have the government stepping in to assign him one from a pool of omegas who’d similarly failed to secure a marriage – because their priority was to facilitate new marriages and repopulate a war-stricken nation, never mind the need for truly-compatible mates to build stable homes on the foundations of true love and shared values.
“Yes. Because you’re a mechanic, Tony. I know who you are," Steve said, yawning, as he turned on his side to go back to sleep.
Maniacal laughter followed that deafening howl and through the smoke, Tony could see Obie pulling himself up. His hair was partially burnt and his body was covered in stab wounds from Tony’s dagger. “Not bad, Tony. But not enough.”
“Jarvis and Ana are already waiting for you in Malibu. I’ll meet you there once we’re done,” Steve assured him, squeezing his hand.
A hand reached out to him just as he felt himself going under, and Steve soon found himself in his mother’s arms.
They stared at each other in silence, the tension between them mounting amidst the tentative ceasefire.
Spots of pink appeared on Peter’s green cheeks. “In my defence, you already had it memorised,” Peter argued.
a suit of armour (Mark II) hidden behind his secret door, Tony liked to have his arms around Steve’s neck. He was going to be his little jetpack, lifting him up so he could fly. They were going to be fine.
It was strange, perhaps, that they were married, even bonded, for close to two years and had yet to say the words. But everything they did had been backwards from the start. Besides, it wasn't a secret. They both knew, could feel it through the bond. Still, Tony thought it would be nice to say them one day.
Tony held Steve close as his body shook and his shoulders heaved. He patted Steve’s back as he whispered words of comfort and love into his ears while he waited patiently for the sobs to subside. When the shaking came to an end, Steve’s voice was thick and heavy, and choking with emotion. “I’m not crying,” he whispered roughly, and looked at Tony defiantly to prove his point.
Steve laughed loudly, and Nat turned and look at them. From where they were, Bucky gave her a quick wave of reassurance.
Straining his eyes in the darkness, Steve could see the illustrations of lustrous gems painted in the colours of the rainbow, but the words were small and foreign to his eyes. With a wave of his hand, Lord Strange turned what looked like ancient symbols into High Valorian, which Steve was somewhat familiar with, before placing it into his trembling palms.
Tony blinked as he processed the sunlight filtering through the window shades. Caught in a haze of emotions and very uncomfortable physical responses, he’d barely slept.
In return, Tony slipped his hands under Steve’s tunic so he could run his fingers against Steve’s warm chest and couldn't resist giving one of his nipples a playful pinch.
I’d love to hear what you think anyway. I might tweak the apologies just a bit if you’ve got any suggestions. 😊
Hi! Please be warned that there is minor character death (canonical) in this chapter. Sorry this is kind of angsty.
Obie roared as drops of blood scattered on the ground, almost causing him to slip as he chased Tony into the cave, only to find himself getting stuck again when his half-shrunk wings got caught at a narrow point.
at me? Do you know how hard it’s been to – mmph – ugh -,” he stopped, interrupted by the warm mouth on his.
“Stephen Strange!” the man with the winged helmet thundered, as his golden locks and red cape billowed behind him in the winds.
“So, those things just stopped whatever the hell they were doing,” Rhodey mused, after kicking at one of the drones to be sure.
He was fine. He’d be fine. Steve was no stranger to rejection and he’d survived it countless times, only to find a new sense of purpose. The funniest thing was that for the longest time, he’d thought that Tony Stark was his destiny.
“Don’t stay down here,” Rhodey advised. “This is the worst place to be. It’s the kill -” he broke off.
“What happened,” Bucky asked, and there was an edge to his voice as his face remained unreadable in the dim light.
With Steve’s attention on his men, Tony could finally gaze openly at him, without the fear of being caught. It had the makings of legend – the sickly son of a farmhand, rejected from the armed forces, having proven himself in word and deed, to rise through the ranks and become one of the most powerful men in the seven realms.
Midnight bared her teeth and raised her spear, and let out a piercing shriek. Answering her cry, her horde of warriors beat their swords against their shields, and clamoured in one voice - for death.
The tender move appeared to placate Tony. “Don’t die,” he mumbled in return, and buried his face into Steve’s chest.
“Apollo, I don’t know if I’m worth all this,” Bucky said as Tony described the weapons he was designing for him.
“You all right?” Steve asked, as he held him under his searching gaze. “Do we need to get you more of those gems?”
“I thought I was going to lose you again,” the alpha said, his voice showing the first signs of cracking.
Tony wiped the tears away with his thumbs, kissing the streaks that ran down his husband’s face. He rubbed his back, whispering softly to calm him down as one phrase stuck in his head.
“Cap, I need you to get to that engine control panel. Tell me which relays are in overload position.”
Steve’s arms fell limply to his sides, and Bucky brushed past him to kneel beside Nat’s body and take her into his arms. “Natalia, please. It’s me, Bucky. It’s James.”
Despite his stony expression, Steve looked soft and cuddly with his grown-out hair and a jaw of gold fuzz that accentuated the hollows in his cheeks. Under his red-rimmed eyes, Tony could make out puffy bags and a couple of new lines he didn’t think had been there before.
Watery eyes drifted to the uniformly grey wall behind the headboard, which really was a mosaic of humble stones that varied in shape and size, made into a masterpiece by the most skilled of masons.
“No,” Steve said. “You have no army. You have no warriors. What you have are slaves - and they will fear my sword more than your whip.”
Steve and Tony host some surprise visitors, who explain the origin of the dragonstones. Tony reveals his secrets with disastrous results.
“Tony. You’ve nothing to be jealous about. Captain Rogers has known her since he came out of the ice. But he chose you. Stop ogling, and googling, and get us some drinks, will you?” Pepper urged, nudging Tony towards the bar with a light tap to his behind.
The only other time she’d been like that was when Winter was in danger. In the situation, Rune described there’s was none such threat. If Rune were a danger she would have tried to reason with him first before attacking. Something was happening to her mind and she didn’t know what caused. Or how to stop it! She’d just have to find a way.
"I wish I could do something as simple as go out with boyfriend without the worry of someone discovering who I am," said Steve.
“She wasn’t good enough for you, but you were right in making her CEO. She’s a wonderful businesswoman,” said Peggy. Stark men weren't built to run a company. They were perfectly capable but found it all rather droll. Howard and Tony were most productive in setting where they were free to create. Maria had to run the company for Howard, behind the scenes since at the time such a thing was unseemly. Peggy ran her fingers through Watson’s fur. “Tell Steve to call. I’d love to hear from him."
“They were so busy with you flying around Brooklyn there was no mention of your visit to Hell’s Kitchen,” said Rhodes.
He returned it at full power. They charged at each other in a mid-air battle. Each crashing against the cliff, before falling back into the woods. Thor grabbed Tony's arms crushing the metal in his grip. He opened his hand hitting Thor with a blast. Tony head-butted his rival causing the man to let go. There gong of metal as Thor copied the motion sending him backward. Thor grabbed him and tossed him to the ground. His thrusters activated before Thor could hammer could reach him. Tony used Thor’s loss of balance to his advantage.
Tony kissed the omega goodnight. Mark 5 was almost fully repaired. There were a few updates he needed to add. Around two in the morning he went up the penthouse. He silently pushed open the door to the guest bedroom. There was actually enough room for him in bed. He joined his mate.
Steve tensed. He heard footsteps not far. He closed his eyes trying to figure out how many. There were twelve maybe.
“True, but secrets have a way of growing heavier as time wears own. I don’t take you as the type person that’s immune to that weight. How long you kept it?”
“I will, but we have to know what we're getting into. But it isn't a no," said Pepper. She knew how Maria struggled to connect with the pups they’d met.
Steve paused when he heard a soft purring. Piper was huddled to his side, sucking her thumb, though the action muffled the sounds. It was a new habit. Even when she was a baby, she never showed much interest in pacifiers.
Her husband believed she worked at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica studying penguins and the effects global warming was having on them. It was someone's story but not hers. In reality, she worked at an undisclosed location in the Transantarctic Mountain range studying super soldiers. Pierce granted her full freedom.
"This is beautiful. There wasn't anything like this in my time. The closest thing were the fish you could win on the Coney Island boardwalk. Bucky won me a goldfish. The only pet I ever had," said Steve.
“He did spend a great deal of time reviewing it. To be fair, it was nearly 500 pages long in small print,” said Jarvis.
“I’m on the street people are going bang. They are painting the walls. Maya, you’re kidding yourself.”
“You could say that,” said Steve. He wasn’t the only Rogers. His father had a brother. He may have some relatives. Tony wouldn’t have let him meet Happy if he was untrustworthy.
“Sorry, Steve, I’m used to science talk. 'Will' is not a word used frequently. When an alpha bites an omega's scent gland during heat, it triggers a chemical reaction, which bonds the couple. Even with your healing factor, I don’t believe it will change this effect, but there’s a chance I could be wrong,” said Edith.
"Healing their wounds were easy, but their minds proved to be a more difficult task. Many came back, different people. I hope I’ll be able to help you like I have so many others,” said Barny.
“I know enough about you to put together that you are one the few people who has a similar background to Piper. Having someone like that in her life will only help her.”
Lena hung up, shaking her head. She was working with incompetent fools! After a few minutes of wallowing in frustration, Lena returned to her bedroom. She quietly started packing her bag, stopping when Helmut stirred.
A tall bald man dressed in black came striding forward. His presence cut through the chaos. An eye patch covered one of his eyes. His stern, authoritative aura screamed alpha. Steve was able to focus on that voice. He straightened and regained control. His teeth retracted. He abandoned his crouching position and stood to greet the alpha. The alpha walked forward.
“It’s for you,” Rhodey said, presenting him with a large box wrapped in paper. “Merry Christmas to my best boy.”
“I don't even know what I was thinking. You have never needed my protection. Look at you,” he said, waving in Tony's general direction. “Storming through the tower like a knight in shining - lab coat?” he added, after noticing his attire.
"And neither will your children be. I can't bring back the children they were before. But in time, hopefully, I can get them to a point where stable. I know that's heartbreaking, but it's something you must come to terms with," said George.
“It wouldn’t matter if the alpha weren’t Stark. Captain Rogers' heat and the potential results are something we must keep an eye on,” said Fury.
The beta carried to her to the bathroom. Piper whimpered when her arms were freed. They were numb and tingly. She shook them, trying to get back some feeling. The beta pushed her into the shower. Piper winced at the bite of the frigid water against her skin. She washed quickly, relieved that the red the rash going down, her legs had started fading.
Pierce studied the boy. The pup's presentation was less than impressive. He was dressed in a white jumpsuit, tangled dark brown hair hung loose down his shoulders. The boy was tall for five. He looked nothing the donor source from which he was created. The only trait the two had in common were those stormy blue eyes.
The four styles of fighting Winter knows are Systema, karate, boxing, and muay thia. There’s a great video explaining this on youtube “How many fighting styles does the winter soldier know in Avengers”. It can explain them far better than I can.
“It’s okay. I’m just not used to talking about him. But she’d kinda like him, but not as broken and more umm…human. And she’s not a super-soldier.”
He tapped Russia. Piper wasn't sure if he was actually Russian, but it was likely the last place he remembered with some clarity.
Tony walked away. It was too much. He’d seen good men die and somehow he fooled himself into believing he wouldn't see it again.
Clint chuckled. Steve had a very dry sense of humor. It made him sound even more the old man. Natasha came back with the French agent came to greet them.
The alpha stalked toward him. His posture straightened making him seem larger. The man held his head high. The powerful dominance of his scent made Steve shiver. A low snarl echoed from the alpha’s throat. He forced himself to keep the alpha gaze. His inner omega screamed at him to bare his neck. Tony wanted to set him off by using alpha male tactics. His back hit the wall Tony’s form framed him in. It pissed him off how much he wanted to give in. He hated this barbaric alpha posturing!
The lustful tone sent a chill through Tony. He moved down Steve’s chest. Tony caught Steve’s nipple in his mouth, teasing the bud between his teeth. Steve keened. He dragged his lips down Steve’s tone stomach. He stopped at the waistband of Steve’s panties. They were drenched with slick.
Tony rubbed the sleep from his eyes. He needed a shower. Hopefully, the green giant wouldn’t mind babysitting for a little while longer. When he got to the penthouse he found Bruce laying on the floor running an intelligence test on Piper. She thought it was a game.
George walked around the room. Large blueprints hung on the walls. The end product was a car with aquatic capabilities. Behind him, Piper worked, but her gaze bore into the back of his head.
“I know what it feels like to be at odds with your own body, not know how to control a power you’re suddenly been given. You’re a genius, little girl. You can figure this out too."
Tony nodded. The alpha wasn't fully there. Christina didn't let her nerves get to her. Edith warned her that Mr. Stark was a difficult man to work with. To her, he seemed a man lost to worry. She needed to get his attention. A single touch to his shoulder was enough to earn that.
Steve did not want to explain the reasoning behind his reaction to his pup. When they got to the penthouse, he changed out of his clothes and into a pair of sweatpants.
Steve blushed. He smiled softly at the image of him, cuddling closely to Tony's chest. He snagged the phone, tucking into his pocket. “I don’t know how to change it."
He pushed his curiosity down. Captain America was his father’s toy, not his. He lasted two minutes before giving in. He called Happy. Minutes later, a car pulled the front of his mansion.
Steve leaned up, kissing the alpha, deeply breathing in Tony’s scent. He wanted to be covered in it. Steve forced himself to pull away; the desire to be scented was completely driven by instinct. His omega wanted him to be bathed in Tony’s scent, so the smell of his pregnancy would be protected from other alphas. He couldn’t afford to get too close to Tony until things were … settled. He would have to watch out for his maternal instincts. It would only be a matter of days before they started kicking in more powerfully. For now, he could indulge. This was only his second day off of his heat, so probably (hopefully) Tony would think the scenting was related to that.
"Yes, exactly like this. Panic attacks, anxiety, nightmares, depression. You went through it first but you're not alone."
Steve felt heavy. He couldn't move. His vision blurred. He tensed when once again he heard a creak. He curled his limbs close, protecting his stomach. A metal hand touched his cheek. He struck out with his shield. Sparks flew at the impact.
Piper yawned. Her eyes grew heavy. She went to the mattress, making a small nest out of the scratchy blankets there.
Steve pulled his hood up over his head before exiting through the back of the tower. His breath fogged in the quiet chill, as the night air refreshed him. He started a slow jog, taking back alleys and fire escapes to avoid any chance of being noticed. As he slid down a ladder, a gun was pressed to his back. There were two men, the one holding the gun and another perched on the roof above.
“Sorry." She glared at him. It was obvious she hadn’t lost her grudge from this morning. “Whatever you have to say, Kate, say it now."
Lena was forced from her sleep when an alert went off on her phone. The alarm system at the base had been activated. This couldn’t be good. It was surprising something like this hadn’t happened sooner.
“You’re not ready for those.” Winter smiled. Almost every trainee instantly went to the weapons, first. But a weapon meant nothing if there was no understanding of the basics.
Steve got into the back seat. There was a bag in the seat opposite. He unzipped it was filled with the clothes from the drawers he had in Tony’s home and his cellphone. If this was really goodbye he wanted it to be in person.
Steve bit his lip. Two of the smartest people he knew couldn't figure what was going on with his child.
Piper woke a few hours later. She had no idea what time was. Her body clock was completely thrown off after so long in the cell. She slept at random hours or whenever the urge hit her. Piper yawned and stretched out. Her eyes widen when she saw the scratched out image of Papa’s shield. She whimpered running fingers over what was left of it.
Steve pulled away, taking a seat on the counter. He cradled his head in his hands. Tony's hand ran down his back, calming him.
Steve closed his phone, tucking it under his pillow. At 4:00 am, his alarm went off. He went to the shower wanting to wash away Tony’s scent. Steve didn't want another omega to know Tony's scent. When he got out, he sniffed his skin. He smelled of the neutral soap he used. Steve dressed in the uniform given to him. He shrugged his shoulders. The outfit scratched against his skin. Steve met Clint and Natasha at the jet.
Where did she get this energy? Right, she's a super soldier toddler with near-boundless energy. Maybe he could sway to his side, Tony thought.
Steve didn’t pry. There were very good reasons for Natasha wanting to keep her private life a secret.
He warmed his hands before rubbings snow over the road rash on his arms. “Maybe I’ll just cozy back up for-
Steve bit his tongue, trying to push back the protective instincts. Jarvis was watching her; she was safe, he had to acknowledge.
Piper went to Rune's easel. The page was still empty. There was something sad about that. Piper had watched him out of the corner of her eye, and she realized, Rune didn't know how to handle even small freedom. Lena shut the sketchbook.
She gently took his metal hand. He pulled his hand away from her. Winter mainly used his real arm when dealing with the pup. Afraid that weapon molded to him may accidentally harm her.
After two hours, Steve and Tony saw Piper and George walking back to the mansion. Piper seemed at ease with the doctor, was even smiling.
Steve was working on his nest when someone entered his den. He grabbed his shield. Carefully, he entered the living room. He relaxed when he saw Edith.
He loosened his grip just enough for her to slip through. Piper caught her reflection in the glass as she rinsed her mouth. They'd changed her clothes. She was wearing white scrubs now. Her hair was in tangles, but it carried no scent. Her eye was swollen a deep purple color. Piper touched it instantly wincing. She let her hair fall in her face, trying to hide it, and turned away.
Steve and Tony were relieved to hear that sound. It was terrific after not hearing it for so long. Out of habit, Steve took a napkin and wipe the powdered sugar and jelly from her cheeks.
Steve made sure Piper was securely tucked into his jacket. He grit his teeth as they pushed through the cold to their waiting jet. Once inside, Steve shook off the snow and quickly took a seat. Tony's armor fell away from him and moved to the corner, standing guard as an empty shell.
The pup yawned again. He pulled the blankets over her, tucking her in. It didn't take long for her to fall asleep. She'd be up in about an hour. He turned off the lights and took a stance at the far corner of the room.
Piper smiled. They went home. The penthouse smelled of breakfast. A large plate of scrambled eggs and sausage was waiting for him. Tony traded him a cup of coffee for Piper.
Steve carded his fingers through the alpha's hair, singing to him. It took Steve a few seconds to realize he was singing their wedding song. He sat them up, holding Tony closely to his chest, so Tony could hear his heartbeat. The slowly alpha came out of it.
A tear slipped out. He couldn't cry! It happened decades ago. Why did it still posses such a hold on his life? Tony gently wiped them away.
“Fuck.” He forced back a growl. Fury wanted to question her. They could hardly get anything out of her, and they were her parents. Rune was willing to reveal parts of his experience but was tight-lipped about Piper.
Tony and Steve sat outside of a small ice cream shop. It was a tucked-away place. They had yet to gain attention. Steve smiled.
He soothed Steve until Piper woke up. The omega allowed him to leave long enough to get their daughter. He placed her on Steve's chest before lying down with them. A soft little rumble sounding quiet. Steve smiled.
“Can you show me a visual?” Even though the feed was old, his network had access to any connected mic or camera.
“I miss my parents.” She had tried explaining the concept to Winter before, but he didn't seem to get it. He understood the words but not their sentiment.
Steve unlocked his apartment and carried the boxes in, kicking the door shut behind him. He toed off his boots and stretched. Shower. He turned on the hot water. Steve shed his clothes a got in. The rain of hot water relaxed his muscles. He pulled on a pair of sweatpants. Steve loved comfy clothes. It was half his wardrobe. He went to the box underneath his bed. From it, he took the red pillowcase. The fabric still held Tony’s scent, but it was fading. Steve rubbed it against his cheek before setting it down on the bed. Soon enough, his nose wouldn't be able to pick up on it. From his bag, he took the train tickets from Romania, placing it in the shoebox. Tensing when his fingers brushed against the paper surface of Howard’s letter. He didn’t want to see it. Steve picked it up. What should he do with it? Keeping it was wrong, even more so now that Howard's son was gaining his attention. Yet he couldn't get rid of it. He folded the letter into the pillowcase and put the shoebox under his bed.
Lena was impressed. Piper got Winter speaking for the first time in a year. And they were only introduced 48 hours ago. She hadn’t believed Winter would respond so quickly to Piper.
Piper shrugged. "I guess before I would have, but I got used to it. Winter had a horrible time. Papa has you to help him calm him down. Winter is all alone with no to help him with his nightmares."
He went down to his lab and down into the wine cellar. His phone rang. Happy’s broad forehead appeared on the screen.
Tony nodded. He took Steve's hand, leading him to the bedroom. He brought Steve into a kiss, slowly deepening it. There was a thump as Steve's back hit the door.
Steve snatch his shield from the alpha before storming back to the house. "Jarvis, do not allow him inside."
"Thank you. I know this wasn't what you expected, but Piper is young and strong. She'll get back to where she was," said Maria.
"We both know what could be gained from this. Do you want that kind of information in their hands?" said Tony.
"Yes, but I’d want to keep you to myself for a bit longer. But I'll happily share with the pup," said Tony, his hands sneaking over Steve's stomach. He nuzzled against Steve’s neck, deeply breathing in the omega’s scent. Steve purred. “Wait, pups? As in plural."
He went to his parents’ plot. Tony glared at the hunk of black marble grave. It fit Howard's perfectly cold, harsh, and intimidating. He shook his head. The last person he wanted to think of was his father, but that was impossible considering who he was searching for. He pressed a button on his watch a small drone flew from it and started scanning the area for foreign substances. An envelope by his father’s grave caught his attention. He picked it up. There was only one word on its surface:
Piper couldn't help raising her head. When was the last time someone said her name? It nearly made her cry. Piper sniffled but pushed down her fear. She had to be strong. Theodore didn’t have a voice or much of a mind. She had to be strong for him.
Lena couldn't forget what she had here. Her mind was in Antarctica, but her heart belonged to Sokovia. It proved a difficult balance to keep, especially when she had a new subject. Henry came in with the newspaper, sighing heavily. Piper was on the front page.
“Oh, sorry, most omegas aren’t so umm built,” she said. The average height of omegas was anywhere from 5’0 to 5’10. Steve was built like an alpha at six feet.
“We don’t, Piper. You can even keep working as long; it’s not something that needs your dad’s supervision,” he said.
He’d broken into the cabinet so many times in his teens. Howard couldn’t create a lock that he couldn’t figure out in a few days at most. He grabbed a bottle of whiskey, pouring a finger, allowing himself one glass. Tony put the bottle back before falling into the temptation of taking another drink. Getting blackout drunk wasn't an option. How would he explain that to Piper? The kid was already dealing with enough. He was so disappointed when he first found Howard like that. There a few times he had to clean up Howard after a drinking binge to save his mom from doing. He'd hate Howard so much those days. He refused to put Piper through that.
The doors to their prison opened. Killian walked in. Steve raised his head. The man had Tony’s scent on him. Killian opened the door of his cell. He snapped at the alpha when he tried carding his fingers through his hair.
"He didn't make me do anything, Tony! It was my choice!" Steve collected. He wasn't the one that should be angry. “Tony, I never wanted it to be like this. But our baby became of the mission. A factor that could take away from my productivity. That was never what it was meant to be. I wanted it to be something precious for us."
Steve whined as they broke apart. The separation was only long enough to remove the clothes between them. Tony moves to his knees peering down at the beauty laying underneath him. He pushed Steve's legs apart, licking gently slick slit.
Steve’s voice seemed far away. Tony quickly wrapped his arms around the omega. Steve slowly unwound in his embrace. He smiled when Steve nosed against his neck. He slowly pulled away.
“Papa! Daddy! I’m here!” she screamed. It was an instinctual cry. Fueled purely by a child's urge to cry out for their parents when they were scared. Why, what was the point of calling for them? She didn’t know why she did. It was all instinct nothing more. Her heart ached. The cry cementing the idea of their rejection. It was too much! She screamed.
A powerful blast sent Steve’s cage slamming into the wall. The glass door cracked. He slammed his feet against it, shattering it completely. He crawled out. His shield skidded next to him.
Steve woke slowly. The top of his lacy outfit clung to his skin. He tugged it off, tossing it to the floor. Steve pulled the blankets over his head trying to block out the sunlight, streaming through the blinds. The chime of his phone forcing him to enter the realm of consciousness. He didn't bother with texting, calling the number instead.
Winter’s eyes opened when breakfast was pushed through the slot in the door. He placed the trays on the bed.
Pepper was stunned by the beautiful little boy that approach her and Maria. He was gorgeous, with cerulean blue eyes and wavy brown hair that fell in his face.
“I’m so sorry, Steve. Please stay with me,” he begged. There was such desperation in his voice. It lacked all his usual confidence.
“I was nearly killed by my own weapon. The irony of the moment didn’t escape me. The explosion sent shrapnel into my heart. I should have died in that desert."
She thought back on it but nothing stuck out. Natasha didn’t think anything of it. A boring mission comes up every now then. Being a spy wasn't constant thrills.
Piper went down the slide, and, sitting at the edge, she studied him. When she couldn't find any hint of a hidden weapon, she jumped onto the stone bench beside him.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” she said. Her godson’s head was bowed. His guilt weighed heavily on him. She was very aware she was one of the few people to see him in such a state. “The two of you will be a good match."
“Says the omega who willing pairs with a handicapped alpha. He’s nothing without his suit he’s nothing. Unplug his battery and he’s done,” said Kate.
The next morning Tony woke up alone. It was normal for Steve to wake up before him. He got up. His back cracked as he got up. Tony went into the living room and found Steve asleep on the couch. He kneeled down by the couch and Steve awake.
Piper tensed as Winter pulled away. The warmth of his embrace was replaced by a cold edge pressed against her throat.
“Of course, you don’t. He's not a blond with a big rack. First, it was normal they were talking business, but now it's getting weird he's showing her his big brain."
It was properly formatted and sourced. It made a convincing argument, but Piper was a handful enough by herself. Adding a dog into the equation would be impossible.
Steve was already retreating into their bedroom. Edith followed him into the elevator. Tony was clenching the railing. His posture was barely containing the worry within. They got off on the lab floor. Stark took a seat at his desk and began fiddling with a random piece of equipment.
"A terrible thought," he said. Steve had already extended his time here. He would have to find an excuse to visit again.
He kissed Tony goodbye. He met with Barny on one of the tower’s empty floors. Steve liked the emptiness of the room. He didn’t feel contained here. At the center of the room were a couch, armchair, and coffee table. Barny was already there with a box of donuts.
He wasn’t ready or fit to have a pup. He needed more time. Steve took a breath and took the test. He placed on the counter and sunk to the bathroom floor.
Desire flamed in the alpha’s eyes. His callused skilled hands worked him perfectly, leaving him aching for more. He leaned into Tony, allowing him to take control. He shook with pleasure. Their bodies were perfectly aligned, skin pressed against skin. Their lips only separating for brief gasps of air. Steve wanted more. He pulled on the waistband Tony's underwear.
What kind of strange world was he living in? An army from space. It sounded like the plot to one of Tony’s old science fiction stories.
“I don’t need your help,” said Piper. She almost regretted saying when she saw the hurt in Papa’s eyes.
“He’s doesn’t like the sound. It makes him go dark.” That was her way of describing Steve’s PTSD. It was perfect. "I don't like when that happens. Why does it happen?"
“Tony, I don’t want to jump to conclusions about what this is. If this is only about my heat, it’s fine." It would be painful, but fine. Tony expected something with no strings attached. At first, that was what he wanted as well. But that changed as he got to know Tony. The sex was amazing, and he was sure the alpha ruined all others for him. "I’d rather know now, that’s all. This is all new for me. I want to know what to expect,” said Steve. He readied himself for the answer.
It wasn't a complete lie. He'd hated it until recently. During the Depression it was a cheap food source, so he must have eaten several pounds of it. Only recently had he come to almost enjoy it. It wasn't the worse thing he ate during the Depression food loaves.
Tony beamed as Steve came around with the tray, and helplessly, Steve found himself smiling back, getting lost again in those warm, gold eyes. They were still gazing into each other’s eyes when Strange picked up a bread roll.
“Please tell me that nobody kissed me,” Tony blurted, and Steve laughed in spite of the tears in his eyes. “Because I know it wasn’t the tears,” he said, shooting a quick glance of concern at Steve. “And I was dying, not petrified,” Tony reasoned, talking himself out of his state of disorientation.
Despite how close they were, pressed up against each other, the space between them was unbearably vast. But everything was falling into place. And the stars in the night sky appeared to pale in comparison to the brightness in his heart.
“If they arrive on time,” Steve said. “I understand that Captain Maw has plans to make landfall by daybreak.”
“Like I said, it doesn’t matter anymore. No need to lose any sleep over it,” Tony mumbled with as much nonchalance as he could. “Goodnight, Steve.”
Clad in his armour, Steve dragged his feet across the meadow in a slow, unhurried manner, and looked like he was trying to make it across in the longest possible time. Tony's heart began fluttering lightly in his chest, which confirmed that all the time spent in exile had done nothing to smother the torch he'd carried for the man walking in his direction.
“All right. All right,” Tony said, as he tried to placate the dragon. “Your friends can come too, you know?” he suggested, not terribly fond of the prospect of leaving Steve in the company of Ivan and Killian. “I mean, there is safety in numbers.”
“You’re shaking,” Steve observed, the words rolling easily out of his gorgeous mouth. His lips looked so soft and warm and pink. Had they always looked that way?
Steve let out a heavy sigh. “What can I do? I’ve applied for an exemption, and I've declared my weak heart, my asthma and nervous trouble! And it was denied! With all my health issues, I don’t think I should even be having kids, but maybe that’s nothing to worry about, because I’ve never had a heat. Maybe I’m not really an omega,” he said hopefully and there it was again – the delicious scent of overcooked blueberry waffles.
“Please tell me he’s at the cliffs,” Clint added when he joined them. “With Rhodes? And I hope they had the good sense not to take Peter with them.”
I don't know why I wrote this angsty thing. Blame it all on Endgame, especially that scene with Howard Potts. This was amazingly the ONLY scene where my stone-cold husband cried.
The motorcyclist hoisted him up by the hair, forcing Howard to look at him. “Sergeant Barnes,” he croaked, in recognition.
“He was going to use the Infinity Spell,” Pietro said, answering the unspoken question, “to end the human race.”
They found themselves in a lawyer’s office, where their family lawyer read them Howard’s last will and testament. As their only child, his parents left Tony the bulk of their property and wealth. Stark Industries, his father’s pride and joy, had been left to Steve.
,” his dad had said. “It appears in the same place each night to guide travellers on their journeys. If you’re lost and all alone, finding the right star will lead you home.”
The captain cleared his throat. “I hope the house is okay. I haven’t had much time to work on it, with the wedding taking place so quickly. And I thought you might want to see to the decorating yourself.”
He did, and almost made it all the way out when thick hands grabbed his waist and tossed him onto the beach. He had barely scrambled to his feet before being kicked in the abdomen, which caused him to fall face-first into rough sand. Tony grabbed a fistful and flung it at a cursing Obie as he approached. A swift backhand had him landing hard on the sand, with Obie looming over him menacingly.
Hands trembling with emotion, he picked up the folder nested in the box. Thumbing through the clear pockets, he found pictures of himself growing up. His father teaching him to use tools. Certificates from various institutions of learning. Newspaper clippings of his prodigious achievements. Notes he had written. Birthday cards he had made. And the words of a poem,
But Steve was too far gone to hear what he was saying. “I made you give it to me. I'm sorry. I knew it was wrong. It felt wrong. It killed me. When you left,” he managed to choke out between tiny sobs.
Just to be clear, Tony is in no way giving up being Iron Man. If anything, he’s realised he IS Iron Man and he is planting himself like a tree on that issue. But he wants to have an honest conversation (which they never did and that really is partially Tony’s fault) to make Steve understand this, which is why he’s going home.
“The hell I can’t!” Tony shouted back. “I’m your mate! And that supersedes everything! What if something were to happen to you? What am I going to do without you by my side?”
The Harvest Festival had been a spectacular success, and Tony’s Aunt May won a ribbon for the largest pumpkin, which she celebrated by making a pie so enormous it managed to feed the entire city.
The emperor cleared his throat. “Pietro, Wanda,” he called, reminding the pair that they were in the company of others.
He paused to catch his breath, and swayed a little, so Tony steadied him with an arm around his shoulder, and in exchange, he received a small nod of gratitude.
Of all people, it had to be Prince Anthony. Over the years, he’d heard so much of the crown prince, and how clever, brave and kind he was. If there was some measure of truth in even half of those tales, he supposed they would get along.
The kiss was soft and slow, with none of the hunger from that day in the caves, but the passion of two lovers who’d gone through hell together - and would do it all over again. Time stood still as the world faded around them. Up there, on the deck of the astronomy tower, there were no swords to forge, no gems to find, and no dragons to battle – just the moon, the stars, and Steve.
It only took a quick glance at the stockpile of weapons lining the cave to confirm the truth behind those words. Tony blinked, confused. SI produced weapons exclusively for the U.S. Army. So, how had the insurgents got their hands on their products?
“Yes. He made an elixir, and it was the first of its kind. Steve was the first and only person who got it and since then, he’s led a charmed life. It explains why he's a bit of a martyr. His faith is in people, and for the most part, they haven’t let him down.”
He bounded up the stairs, two at a time, till he reached the top floor. Hacking their codes, he found his way into a highly-secure-looking room and found Steve strapped down, with some serious-looking cuffs.
Despite their meticulous planning, the battle was a mess. They were greatly outnumbered and severely outmatched by the Chitauri forces. Too many close brushes with death. Loki opened the portal. The quinjet crashed. Bruce had trouble turning into the Hulk.
Tony found himself swept away in a wave of young couples rushing to the department stores, where several new collections were being launched. The war was over, which meant that manufacturers no longer had to work within the constraints of austere rationing policies. With the surge in luxury goods now flooding the market, Tony sometimes found himself longing for a special someone to dote on and shower with gifts.
Tony had taken these freedoms for granted. It was his fault, for letting himself get used to it. He was spoiled now. But why would he give Tony all those choices if he wasn’t going to stand by him when it counted most?
“And this must have been your favourite tale," he murmured as he flipped to one of the dog-eared pages.
Tony coughed, interrupting the embarrassing reminder of his self-insert comic books, written and illustrated during a
Tony ran a search for the truck that the SHIELD agents had shoved Steve and Nat into. Hill and Coulson continued talking as he worked on tracking them down.
With Happy behind the wheel, they drove the long, winding road through town, passing a number of familiar landmarks.
“I’ll be outside some more,” he said, walking off toward their horses, because he had no problems watching them push a man off a cliff he but couldn’t stand to see Steve in another person's arms.
“The guy with the horns was obviously trying to kill you, so I had to take him down,” Steve said, in a tone so casual he might as well be talking about weeding.
As far as feasts went, it was fit for seven kings. Long tables were laden with traditional dishes hailing from the seven kingdoms. There were roasted meats, platters of fowl, seafood drizzled in sauces, and no shortage of freshly-baked bread and fine cheeses, waterfalls of wine and streams of spirits that flickered with flame.
“Thank you for -,” he said, gesturing vaguely. Because he never knew what he was thanking Jarvis for. What he knew was that every time he found himself in a quandary, a tight spot, a jam, Jarvis was already there in his corner, ready to show him the way out.
The brightness was blinding and for a second, Tony didn't see a thing, but then Peter fell into a heap, collapsing into the space that Ivan had been. Behind him on the rock wall was a dark stain of ash and a light smoke was coiling towards the sky. The chrome dragon appeared to have vaporised without a trace.
“But you’ve treated him before,” she continued, not at all bothered by the stares in their direction.
It was wrong. Tony knew it. But Killian’s warm hand felt so good in the chilly breeze. Tony closed his eyes for a second to clear his head and almost instantly felt warm lips pressed against his own. “No, no. Stop. Please stop. I can’t,” Tony pleaded as he tried to struggle out of Killian’s vice-like grip.
Tony pulled away to kiss across Steve’s jaw, tugging the omega’s hair lightly. He ran his teeth against that perfect neck, so willingly exposed to him. His arousal throbbed when Steve arched from the as he mercilessly stroked the omega’s sweet spot.
Currently, the pup was waiting for him to finish breakfast. She kept peeking at his tray to see if he'd finished but refused to rush him. The pup had little to no tolerance for being in their enclosure, unless for rest or meals. He set the tray aside.
Tony scruffed Steve. The omega went limp. Steve was crying. It tore at his heart. He wasn't sure if it was solely caused by the physical pain or the emotion inflicted by using an alpha command. Tony kept Steve scruffed, knowing as soon as he let go the omega would strike.
“More I never thought anyone would purpose. I wasn’t what most alphas and betas were looking for," he said.
Steve woke early the next morning. He sighed when he saw his most recent nightmare inspired painting, staring back at him. It was a vertical painting of the front of a sleek black train speeding toward the viewer. An icy blue and white back round surrounded it. The only warm color in the painting was a red Hydra symbol painted on the front. Steve ran his hand through his hair. He’d be painting many trains if he continued like this. Steve went over his remaining art supplies. He had nine set stretcher bars left. Nine more paintings. He would have to ask Phil for supplies.
Steve took off his shirt, laying back. He flinched as the cool gel was squirted onto his stomach. Edith turned the image. Unlike the ultrasound, Steve could see the developing face of his child.
“What can you do?” What did he possess that could cause this level of damage to her when she was in such an overpowered state.
Even once the blood was cleaned away, he smelled it on her. It stained the pup's gentle lavender honey scent. He dressed her with clothes he found in the bureau and set her in bed, pulling the blankets over her. Winter went to the bathroom, checking his reflection. The image staring back at him was nothing new. He got into the shower. The water badly stung his battered body, but he needed to get clean.
She looked at the stuffed bunny in her arms, then suddenly plucked out its eyes. She turned the plastic eyes over in her fingers. They seemed normal. Piper tossed them aside, then ripped open its stomach, removing all the cotton fluff, but found nothing. It was just a normal stuffed animal. Even so, she didn't restuff the bunny. Piper joined Theodore. She played with the deflated bunny.
Winter nodded. He seemed to easily accept the idea of a three-year-old with above average intelligence. Most adults had difficulty accepting it until they heard her last name. Winter seemed to know little of his current situation, and even less of the outside world, so he didn’t know the Stark name.
A beta woman sat at the child’s table in the center of the playroom. She reminded Piper of Snow White with her pale skin, ebony hair, and red painted lips. Piper couldn’t get a real feel for her scent under her citrus perfume.
“Is there anywhere in New York you’d want to go before I have to take you back to S.H.I.E.L.D?” asked Tony.
Winter could probably sleep standing. She didn't move, not wanting to wake him. Was it even tomorrow yet? She reached for one of the books at the end of the bed. The slight sound of the pages turning woke him anyway.
Winter was relaxed until that command was given. From her lab jacket, Lena pulled a collar. It was thinner than the one he wore. There was a small click as it locked in place.
“I won’t,” he said. However, pleasant the idea of bondage with Captain America was. It was a stressor for Steve.
Tony groaned giving up on the idea of sleeping. It was unlikely that he would have slept anyway. He turned on the bedside lamp.
“I don’t see why not,” said Steve. He was just happy the pups were willing to eat something he made. Steve gave them each a bowl. Having a full stomach would help them go back to sleep. After eating two large bowls each, the kids started nodding off.
"Fair point, but it didn't win me any battles with your papa. Got me into trouble in multiple relationships, personal and professional,” said Tony.
"If he kills her, you deal with the shitstorm from the higher-ups. Do you know how much time and resources have been put into getting her?" said Rumlow.
Steve went to the elevator, hitting the dining hall floor. He found Thor sitting on the table eating some kind of dry pastry.
"This may be a new era, but I doubt even now it won't have use of me. Knowing I may be needed is stabilizing. It isn't the future that's getting to me."
“That’s not fair,” she said. He’d never made her promise anything before. Winter asked so little of her, but she didn’t want to give him that. “Okay, Winter.”
Steve walked away heading in the direction of the gym. It would allow him to work out his frustration. He hung a punching bag and took his aggression on it. It took ten punching bags for his frustration to fade.
“Like it or not you’ll be forced to work with people like him. You’ll be expected to treat them like anyone else,” said Steve.
She had him the scent blocking bandages. Steve place a bandage on either side of his neck, cover his scent glands.
“You might as well have. Do you think I like having to be strong? Having to force myself to stay together for you. It's the most draining thing I’ve ever done in my life and I’m sick of it!”
Steve wanted to argue, but Natasha’s expression told him not to. He nodded, following her to jet. Steve took a seat in front of her.
"There were footsteps on the roof. A masked attacker broke in. He was strong Tony. Knocked me out with a single hit. This guy wasn't normal," said Happy.
They ate in silence. Steve yawned the urge to sleep, becoming overwhelming. Tony started gathering plates.
“You have to understand how terrifying it was for her. It might not have been something she wanted to reflect on. I don’t think confronting her now would be good,” cautioned Bruce.
Her small brow wrinkled. She didn’t understand. Piper wouldn’t understand even if he explained what work was. He rubbed her back.
"Yes, I know it was wrong, but I didn't have much a choice." His guilt turned miserably in his gut. It was the right thing to do, but he couldn't get over the fact that he'd put his child in danger. He could have lost some much that day.
He rested his head against Tony chest, trying to focus on keeping his breathing steady. Tony offered him his hand. He held it tightly. Steve took to counting down the minutes in his head to focus on something other than the pain. By two in the morning, his water hadn't broken. The urge to bared down push was becoming overwhelming. The cramping agony left him gasping for breath. He questioned if he had the strength to push the pup from him. Edith wanted to wait to break his water, wanting to give it another few hours for the process to happen naturally.
Lena led Piper to a mid-size room. Like everything else, it was gray. On each wall was a whiteboard. There was a single child-sized desk at the center of the room and a teacher's desk across from it. Piled on it was a large stack of books, most of them AP level.
Steve got into the car waiting outside. He got into the back seat. Steve watched the buildings pass by. Once they made it out of the city Natasha sped up. Work was work. He accepted it and enjoyed it, but he wished it came at another time.
"I have sympathy for the Starks’ loss, but there's nothing to be done. Without further leads, there's nothing more this organization can do to assist them. Now, why have Captain Rogers and Stark, along with two of our best assassins, flown out?"
Piper had told him over and over about the Avengers. They sounded like a fairytale to him, but she assured him that they were real. And judging by the lengths that her parents went through to get her, he was sure that was true.
His hands started shaking. Distress flooded the room. It was a powerful mixture setting both alphas on edge. Tony clenched his teeth trying desperately to remain in control of his state of mind.
Tony was exhausted after three days with less than six hours of sleep. He wasn't the only one lacking sleep. Piper’s crankiness led to several holes in the walls penthouse from the toys she'd thrown. He would have to patch those holes before Steve got home.
"Relieved, before now Tony and I had to hide. We couldn't risk being out in public. S.H.I.E.L.D. I can't say I'm looking forward to the attention that will come my way, but I wouldn't change anything," said Steve.
"We are super-powered children. You were created by an unknown organization. It may be what really happened, but in the real world that stuff doesn't go over well. People object to the power of the Avengers, sometimes. They question that two founding members allowed their child to be kidnapped,"
“I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king,” he growled.
"Because you're only doing this, punish yourself! As much it feels may like we may deserve to suffer, we don’t.”
“That time was to make him feel comfortable talking to me. Do you know how difficult that was?” said Barny.
"You don't have to throw yourself headfirst into it. Take it in at your own pace. Progress is progress no matter how little it may seem."
“I’m willing to wait,” said Pierce. The girl would help tow Hydra’s goal, help bring upon a new era and keep them in power.
"I'm sure we'll come up with something," said Steve. He pushed his nose to Tony's throat, searching for another's scent, but nothing. Shivering when Tony returned the gesture.
Steve's posture straightened as Nat’s team entered. Hill opened a folder and spread out thermal pictures of an underground facility. It was a maze of halls, dead ends, and easy ambush zones. A logistical nightmare. They were at a disadvantage. The enemy’s numbers were unknown.
Tony froze. Steve dripped the word with lust. His omega crooked his head innocently to the side. He rolled sexily onto his back purring. It was an irresistible sight. How long would Steve be like this? Feral state could last the span of an omega's heat. He hoped Steve would come too soon. It was unlikely, though, given how long his heat was suppressed. Tony preferred a vocal partner. If he did come to, Steve would feel exposed. Tony slid on a pair of underwear, earning a growl.
Tony slowly shed his clothes. Was the man teasing him? Steve whimpered as those predatory eyes swept over him.
Piper paced their cell, tiled floor cool underneath her feet. The chemical clean scent made her anxious. There was no trace of her drawings. It was like that blue rage didn’t happen. She was strong. But that power was something new. It frightened her and she didn’t understand it. But she needed to … if there was even a chance she could use it against her captors.
He grasped the alpha forearm. There was a pop. Liquid gushed from between his legs wetting his shorts. An instant relief swept over through him, but a stabbing pain swiftly followed it. Tony caught him before he could collapse.
Tony gave him a few seconds to collect himself. He caressed Steve's cheek. Tears were threatening to pour-over. "Don't cry, sweetheart."
“And what is worse, you lied to me! There was no storm! What’s more important your family, or your work?”
Lena quietly left the bed, shutting the door silently behind her, before going to her room. Lena shed her clothes and crawled into bed with Helmut. He turned his arms wrapping around her waist pulling her close. She turned to face him. He kissed her.
"When I came out of the machine, it felt like I didn't belong in my own body. I had to adjust and made mistakes along the way. I was treated like a freak," he said.
"They'll be programmed to capture. The drones will dispose of immediate threats with little risk to us. Now, let’s get my daughter," said Tony finally, ending all discussion.
Where did he get the right?! Tony had issues he wasn’t blind. He was aware the honeymoon state wouldn’t last forever. Steve wasn’t so naïve to think otherwise. Tony wasn’t abusive or cruel he treated him with respect. Barny didn’t have the right to judge his relationship!
"My mother left my dad and me when I was a kid. Dad was a boxer was murdered when I was young," said Matt.
“He’s your brother. You and Loki have lifetimes that will span millennia. This is a small blip in time for you. You can’t expect us to be so forgiving though,” said Steve.
Steve hated the idea of taking the time to punch out a message on the small key of his phones. It seemed so impersonal. He’d much rather have a phone call and hear the other person’s voice. In this case, though, he was okay with it. After breakfast, he would go to Edith’s office. Steve went to the café. A few agents were already there. He filled his tray and went to a table. Other agents stopped staring at the quantity of food he had to eat. He poked at the scrambled eggs at his plate. Steve finished his meal before heading to the medical wing. He knocked on the door to Edith’s office.
Their clothes were burned. Clint seemed completely comfortable with their nakedness. Steve accidentally caught a glimpse of Clint's naked form. It was well-muscled, but there was no attraction there. They were sprayed with a thick soap that stung the skin. Then they were lead to the showers. Steve was relieved to wash away the stinging soap. They were given flimsily hospital gowns to wear. Each of them were given a separate doctor.
The two spies left. Steve would have liked them to stay longer. They didn't look to him as an oddity. He hoped to get to know them better. Steve sighed. There was that omega instinct again, urging him to connect and build a pack. The Howling Commandos were his pack. Now he had to make a new one. All he wanted now was to be alone.
Steve spat in the man's face. Killian slapped him. Steve still glared at him with stubborn determination. Flinching when the alpha's molten hand traveled to his stomach.
He woke to five men charging at him. Gunfire made him go rigid. Where was Tony?! He shifted seamlessly into attack mode. A collar shot around his neck, depleting him of his strength. He yelped, crying out for his alpha. The sudden loss of strength was terrifying. A blur of red and gold streaked across his vision.
Steve slid on a pair underwear. The fabric was uncomfortable against his skin. He stopped at the closet, checking in on his sleeping alpha.
Nat rolled her eyes. How could she think he had control over such an alpha. Steve took the museum ticket from his jacket, tucking it carefully into his wallet. He leaned against the car door watching the scenery pass by.
“You’re burning the French toast,” said Tony. He smirked enjoying the omega's stunned expression. With other omegas, he couldn't risk the submission of letting one mount him. Steve was the only omega he could risk doing it without the fear of a press scandal.
But then she relaxed allowing the touch. A sudden feeling of familiarity spread through him. What triggered it? He had no memory, yet he was sure he’d done this before. Winter pulled the cloth away. She sniffled, looking at him with those watery light blue eyes. He’d done all he could to comfort her.
The car crashed into a tree, followed closely by a man on a motorcycle. Tony saw his father crawling painfully out of the mangled wreck, blood running down his face as he pleaded, “Help my wife, please.”
Tony tried to find comfort in the kind words offered to him, stories about his parents’ legacy. Their work had changed and touched the lives of so many around them. And now that their lives had been unfairly cut short, they would be mourned and missed.
Tony opened his mouth to say something but came up short. What was there to say to someone who already knew his innermost thoughts?
Tony looked at the caves on the other side of the beach. “His cave is just right over there,” Tony pointed out with a calculated air of nonchalance. “But if you’re scared...” he added.
Thor turned red and Bruce turned green, so Tony intervened, trying to contain the situation before it spun out of control. “Guys, it’s fine. We’re okay. Can we just focus on the mission right now?”
Reluctantly, Tony pulled away. “If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops,” he said, surprised he could still do the math with Steve's tongue in his mouth.
Steve reached out for one of Tony’s hands as he walked by. “You’re right. But bear in mind that we’re up against untrained slaves. Men from landlocked countries, having never sailed a day in their lives. They’re going to arrive hungry, seasick, exhausted. Each of us is surely worth ten times as much as one of theirs.”
“They do,” Tony agreed. “And after that, it’s a slow agonising death – full of yearning and want. I’ve had a taste – up there in the mountains. There is no way I can leave you behind, not for one summer, not even for a day. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. You have no idea how many times I came back, under the cover of darkness, just to catch a glimpse of you, even though you were always buried under your blankets.”
They took the long way back, which began with a detour to the Wanderer’s Woods, where they’d met all those years ago. As they passed Rockehenge again, Tony felt Steve’s strong arms tightening around his neck, and he reflected on how the strings of fate had helped them find their way to each other, even if Tony hadn’t known it at that time. They cruised by Ferrumarx on their way to King’s Isle, where they tried to spot the cave in the darkness, before they finally headed home.
“He had to follow them. How could he not? For his mother had read him the stories, and they all told of the same thing – that the will-o-the-wisps led one to –”
“Steve!” Tony yelled, and raced toward his limp body. Gently, he cradled Steve’s body and took him to the other side of the room, a safe distance from where his friends exchanged blows with the bloodthirsty emperor.
His husband smiled mysteriously as he led them out of the house towards the stables to fetch their horses. They rode along the walls, with Steve pointing out the important buildings in the city, before they arrived at the garden, an enchanted one where magic had surely rained on the plants. The flowerbeds bloomed in the colours of a rainbow, and showcased the wondrous combination of earth, sunlight and rain. Peeking from behind low hedges were shy roses, blushing in the loveliest pinks.
Steve didn’t pursue the matter and turned his attention instead to the book on his bedside table. Tony had found
Tony felt incredible pain mixed with rage, and the emotions weren’t his own. He shuddered as Wanda's memories spilled into Tony’s head. He was shown a flower-filled raft, with her father’s dead body in the middle, a dagger impaled in his chest.
Scoffing, Pietro ran his fingers along the cool blade. “Homo Sapiens and their steel,” he said, and paused to admire the sapphire stone in the pommel.
“Of the Asgardian mead aged for a thousand years in the barrel made from the wood of Brunhilde’s fleet? You ought to sit down,” Tony said, and took the spot beside him.
The prince was looking at him expectantly, and Steve was confused. Bucky and Sam jostled for the best position to watch something, but Steve couldn't figure for what. It was Clint and his puckered-up lips, who finally reminded him that it was time for the customary kiss.
“And you never once talked to me, your husband, about it. That’s kind of dishonest, don’t you think?” he demanded, firing first.
“The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims! But not the screams of the dead, of course. No, no- wounded screams, mainly whimpering.”
Steve squinted, blinked and shook his head, as if unable to believe what he was seeing. “Tony?” he asked.
Tony tried to slow down his breathing as he shifted his attention to the camera facing on the bus. Tony counted four mercenaries closing in, firearms trained on the vehicle. Their machine guns swept the vehicle from the front to the back. Biting his nails, Tony imagined Steve running the gauntlet of bullets, before diving out the back window and rolling out of sight.
, which produced an incinerating burst of fire that scorched the tip of her tail as she tried to flee.
The relentless immersion began to take its toll. He lost his focus. And he felt dizzy and light-headed.
“You’re inseparable. Attached. Connected,” he added, no longer recognising the sound of his own voice.
Sarah smiled. “I know,” she said, gently. “You know, I’d always thought Steve would marry someone from here, a fellow warrior who'd understand our way of life. But this - this is better. You’ll be good for him,” she said, nodding. “Besides, he’s already besotted.”
Finally, alone, Tony accessed the flash drive Fury had given him, which contained SHIELD’s top-secret files that Nat had downloaded while on the
They were happy to let Tony install JARVIS in the building, and the butler’s voice helped to keep him calm and level-headed when the A.I. wasn’t helping the other occupants with operating the lights, ordering pizza and keeping tabs on everyone’s comings and goings.
The fight continued, and Tony became more confident with each new manoeuvre he practised, but Obie steadily weakened from the blood loss. “You're good, Tony. But I am bigger, stronger and tougher in every way!” Obie roared one final time and spread his wings in a massive display of might.
From above them, Peter shouted out a brisk farewell, as he hurried after Rhodey, who was still chasing a fleeing Killian.
“Schellehead,” Steve whispered hoarsely, and tears welled up in his eyes as he looked in horror at Tony’s wounds. “We’ll get you fixed up. You’re going to be fine. Come on, you’ve got to stay strong for – "
Thor nodded. “Verily, you are not,” he said, as he placed an arm around Steve’s shoulder. “Steven, my friend, you are brave and strong, loyal and true. I’d travel the world to bring it to you. Allow me to undertake this quest for the elusive stone on your behalf. My only fear is we are running out of time.  If only we knew where it was,” the Thunder God mused.
Steve gently ran the brush through the brown coat of his horse, and brushed away the dirt and grit that might have gathered. He worked in silence, and the only sound in the stables was that of the swishing brush.
Steve looked exhausted and so ready to have a nap. And Tony considered holding his fire, putting off the confrontation to another day. He could use the extra time to build his arsenal, sharpen his knives. But he had a tactical advantage, the element of surprise, and the opportunity to launch the first strike.
He chose to begin with a warning shot. Maybe they could talk this over like the adults they were, and the escalating situation could be defused.
Steve stayed silent, waiting for some sort of revelation that never came. What was he supposed to do with this information?
Questions swam around in his head as he tried to make sense of what had gone wrong. The public reaction to their response to New York attack had been largely positive. Apart from a handful of cynics like Miss Everhart, people were thankful that they had been around to stop the attack. So, who could possibly want Fury dead?
The man named Pietro stepped forward to introduce the titan in the room, using the common tongue this time, for Steve's sake. “Presenting Emperor Thanos, Commander of the legions of Anguisia. The Mad Titan, Masterlord and Overmaster. He, who rules with absolute power and unchallenged supremacy. Kneel before him and rise into the ranks of his great conquest.”
“Yeah, sure,” Steve said, voice tight. But Tony was too caught up in catching up with Rhodey to ask him why.
Was the dragon, content with guarding his treasure in his lair, really the villain? And was Beowulf who sought the dragon out even after he’d already ceased his attacks, truly the hero of the story?
The Avengers - Not the friends he was looking for, but the family he’d found.  And he’d be damned to let them take sides in a war that could tear them apart.
“Magic with a flying kick!” Peter called out, as he delivered one of his legendary kicks to Thanos’ jaw before rushing to his exit. Thanos grabbed his long tail and flung him onto the cold, hard ground, which left deep cracks in the hexagonal tile. As he raised an enormous purple foot to crush Peter like an insect, the floor opened under the young dragon, who vanished from the room.
“A beautiful sentiment. But we will win, one way or another. The emperor is building a new army and we're ready for a higher form of war. You’ll fall to your knees,” he gritted out as he grabbed a fistful of Nat’s hair as he attempted to shove her to the ground, but Nat simply caught his wrist and twisted his arm behind his back.
Tony recalled the time he fought his way out of the cave. He’d felt invincible. And if he played it right, he could be invisible too. No one had to know. Especially not Steve. Not in his current state. He needed to keep him safe.
“Well, you’re not wrong. I would put it in myself but I’ve run into a little problem. See, there’s an exposed wire. Ow!”
While the Raging Serpent had once flowed a beautiful emerald green, years of pollution and neglect had darkened its waters into a miserable grey-black. And just across the fast-flowing river, which was clouded these days with unknown dark matter, Tony caught his first glimpse of Dragonrocke, whose tower rose so high that almost all of it was shrouded in cloud.
“Ships? But we need barges.” Without elaborating, Tony peered outside the window. “Say, is there always this much fog around here?”
“If he’s this far gone, I should be the one to bring him in. I’m the one least likely to die trying,” Steve argued, staying on his course.
Things with Bucky had been awkward at first, but apologies were (sincerely and profusely) made and forgiveness was given. Still, Tony had to look away every time the arm came into view.
What made it harder was his inability to put into words the qualities he was looking for. Things like “mutual interest” and “reciprocal candour” often came to mind, but until he was physically interacting with the other person, there was no way of knowing if sparks would fly.
The media rocketed out of their seats, shooting hundreds of questions at him, even though Phil had specifically asked them not to. Tony looked past them, searching, scanning- for a face at the back of the room, beaming brightly back at him. It was a smile so brilliant it eclipsed everyone and everything there. He was looking at a smile of sunrises and new beginnings, a promise that he would never be alone.
“Oh, don’t. We’ve just started talking. Do you know? Two years ago, you promised to meet me on this same rooftop but never showed. I often wonder what would have happened if you’d kept our date. We could have been married by now. I’m no Captain America, but I would have given you the world.”
“Give it back,” Tony huffed, and snatched the bun out of the sorcerer’s hands so he could take a bite from it. “Steve has the best buns in the house,” he declared defensively.
, which Wanda had extracted from the blackstone walls of the throne room, where the twins jointly ruled over their people in peace.
A satisfied smirk sat on Obie’s lips. “After all these years, you still haven’t found a way to embrace your full potential,” Obie gloated. “How disappointing. I was looking forward to a fair fight. Laugh all you want at my dragon name, but at least I’ve got one.”
“Wait,” Tony said, as Steve turned back to look at him, the unspoken question on his lips answered with a soft kiss. “Go get her.”
“What about Tyranaksthon? Surely, he’ll defend his island. He’s not going to let these forests raze to the ground.”
Peeking through the lace canopy, Steve quickly found Tony seated at the small wooden table beside the window, having breakfast, and the sight of Tony eating, talking and laughing with his family caused his heart to sing.
It would have been the right thing to do five minutes before, but not now. Not when the city was about to be turned to dust.
The dragon let out a giggle. “It’s kind of a funny story, but all my life, actually,” the dragon said, and Steve could see that he was telling the truth.
He spent his days in and out of sleep, finding it impossible to summon enough strength to leave the bed. In the dark, he could pretend his parents were still alive, holidaying in the Bahamas.
“You should have told me,” Tony chided gently, recalling how he wouldn't stop crying until his Uncle Ben and Aunt May introduced him to the little boy they recently adopted. "But also, I should have known," he added, with a little laugh.
“It’s a delicate mission, one that requires intelligence,” Sam pointed out and as an afterthought, he added, “That rules Clint out."
The garden was a world of its own, with specimens from various parts of the world brought together to bloom in harmony, like Valoria and her open borders, welcoming peaceful travellers from all corners of the world with wide arms.
Steve had been wounded by arrows, slashed by swords, pierced by spears. He prided himself on his tolerance of pain. And still, he wouldn’t wish his misery on his greatest foe.
“Don’t think. Just drink,” Bruce ordered, and brought the tipped cup to his lips, forcing Steve to gulp it down so as not to waste a drop.
Wow. From the amount of shouting in the comments section (seriously I feel like imma get a heart attack each time I open my inbox), I think I need to warn everyone that this is not a happy chapter. It’s super angsty. Like really really angsty. And y’all gonna hate Steve for a while but hopefully he can redeem himself soon (ish).
“What?” Tony mouthed and gaped stupidly at the young man who called himself Steve Rogers, because Steve, Howard and Maria’s Steve, was supposed to be twenty-four, just like he was, but this person in front of him, this boy, looked barely out of his teens.
In the midst of all that revelry, Tony lost sight of Steve, so he milled around aimlessly, and exchanged pleasantries with anyone who stopped for a chat.
“Oh no, Tony. Ivan and Killian are going to stay right here, with your precious king. Keep him safe and warm,” Obie said, as Ivan secured Steve’s hands with his tail and Killian blew fireballs all around his head. “Take me to this - Ty-ran-ak-sthon,” Obie spat, pressing a sharp talon against the small of Tony's back. “And no one gets hurt. Lead the way. Now.”
With bated breath, he watched Bruce removing the bandages, hearing the wonder in the healer’s voice as he informed them that Tony’s wounds had all healed, without even leaving a scar.
Tony wanted to comply with the words. He was a good husband. He really was. But his terrified legs developed a mind of their own, and were rooted to the spot. Tony tensed as he heard Steve moving closer. “Hey. Look at me.”
"I’ll work on it. All the time," Steve promised. "You make me want to be a better person, the best version of myself. Until I come close to being worthy. I’m sorr -,”
Steve looked away again, refusing to meet his eyes. “It felt wrong. It didn’t belong to me,” he explained, as he tried to return the weapon.
“Anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they’d like to disclose? I’m open to suggestions,” Tony called out. “Because
Steve paused, but finally relented, his resolve non-existent when his omega asked for things so nicely.
“And also, not my type at all,” he quickly added, attuned to the signs of jealous alpha. “Honestly it would be so weird, you know? I - only go for big, blond and beautiful,” he reassured, focusing fully on Steve, with the weapon safely out of reach of inquisitive alphas.
He even smirked when they took his wedding band (early in his captivity before they figured out who he was), read the inscription and freaked out when they realised he hadn’t been lying about being married to Captain America.
Obie rubbed his jaw against his wing. Then, he walked calmly toward Steve and ripped the shield from the king's fingers. “Pretty trinket,” he murmured as he tossed it behind him. “But we want the stone!” he roared, in a way that caused the ground to tremble.
"Yes, of course," Steve said easily, and the corners of his lips quirked upwards. "It's just like us mortals. Not all of us are out to do good."
He ditched the exuvia, leaving it behind in a pile of ashes and dust. The wrecked exoskeleton had served its purpose, given him his ticket out of hell. Now, he just needed to find his way home.
The scent of fresh flowers permeated the mansion. Candles were kept alight on just about every table and shelf. A steady stream of mourners paid their last respects, travelling from all corners of the globe and arriving at varying times of the day.
“Don’t be. I’m here now. I will take care of you. You need to rest, Tony. Bath now. Then bed.” His voice was soft but it allowed no room for arguments.
“Phoenix tears,” Bruce said sadly. “Any chance?” he asked, before looking at Sam, who shook his head. “Well, it’s either that - or - do we know if she had family?”
Tony would recognise the curved blade with red rubies encrusted on its sheath and scabbard anywhere.
Steve reared back, eyes wide and mouth agape, as though he’d been slapped. “Tony, please,” he entreated, reaching for him in a way that almost seemed desperate.
“I did,” Steve said. “It’s coded to your print. Bracelets were a little big. Thought this was more discreet. And you never quite took it off. Not unless you were already in the workshop,” he added, looking at the ring, which was partially visible from outside the suit.
The horn sliced through Steve’s leather gauntlet, splattering blood on his chainmail. Steve barely even flinched from the pain, but in order to avoid the inevitable maiming of his fingers –
“You never opened it,” Steve said and when he saw that Tony could not sit up, he offered to do it for him.
Ivan and Killian must have seen Obie plunging, as both dragons were up in the air and circling the beach for him. It was somewhat of a relief that Steve wasn’t with them, because it meant they must have left Steve behind, presumably on the beach and hopefully safe and sound.
Obie’s body had returned to its human state, perhaps for energy conservation in his final moments. But the impact of his fall, coupled with the blood loss, proved to be too much. His blue eyes bulged out of their sockets, looking toward the sky. He wasn’t moving, wasn’t breathing, but what had to be the surest proof of his death was the glowing green scalestone that once belonged to him floating above his body - for a dragon was separated from their treasure only in death.
Steve's speech galvanised them into action and soon everyone was on the ground or in the air, kicking lots of ass. And Hulk, angry as always, he smashed, smashed and smashed.
“I can see why,” Tony said, as he took in the stunning view. It was a cool evening, and Steve moved to stand behind him, so close that Tony could feel his warm breath at the back of his neck.
“I'm not upset, Tony," he said, placing his hand gently on Tony's back. "You were just trying to help. Like you did with my watch and the washing machine.”
She was about say something else, but changed her mind. Then, she made a sharp turn, changing her course, at the sight of someone at the door.
“Oh, thank the gods,” Sam said. “Because if you talk shit about our best friend again, king or not, we’re going to smite you.”
“You’re leaving,” he said, his voice plaintive. “I heard you the other day – talking to your parents,” he confessed.
Rhodey pulled back and checked his body for injuries. Satisfied that there weren’t any to be particularly concerned about, he nodded, pulling Tony to his feet.
Steve nodded as he urged Star forward, and took his position in front of the troops. “Bucky, take your men down the left flank.”
When he looked up, Thanos’ fist was in mid-air, held in place by Wanda’s magic. The mindstone was on her finger, glowing a bright orange. She held on firmly, as her face and body strained with effort.
“Oh,” Steve said, his blue eyes growing wide with understanding. “I’m sorry. I got carried away. I can wait - however long you need.”
“Bravo locked,” Thor reported. “Here comes the parade,” he said as a group of HYDRA pilots began firing at him.
Tony was thrilled to see her for the first time since DC because she and Clint had gone on a long series of missions to mop up what had been left of HYDRA.
“Oh,” Tony said, as his mind reviewed his long list of courting propositions. “To what exactly, may I ask?”
Steve sat down carefully on the edge of the bed and brushed away Tony’s long bangs to gaze at the dark lashes resting against pale cheeks. He brought the glass of cool water to Tony’s parched lips, and willed them to open.
Lightning flashed, thunder followed and when the dust settled, the Asgardians were standing inside a circle of runes that had magically appeared on the dead grass.
Things had been going well with Steve, who turned out to be so liberal that Tony had to get used to his newfound freedom. While Steve went to work, he urged Tony to go on little shopping trips (with Happy). He even gave Tony a card with a ridiculously high credit limit and told him to buy whatever he liked.
“There’s no time!” The young man tossed the aerosol extinguisher into a firefighter’s waiting hands, and bent down to pick up something on the ground. “Too much smoke! If I wait any longer, the baby’s going to die!” he yelled. Then, shielding the baby’s head with what looked like the lid of a garbage can, he sprinted down the stairs.
Tony's own parents had been strangers when they married, and love had blossomed over time. He hadn’t expected to be swept off his feet right from the start, but the first time Steve touched his hand felt like magic, and Tony felt like he’d been waiting for him all his life.
Bruce looked at the bed. “Still asleep?” he didn’t quite ask, and brushed past Steve without waiting for an answer. Steve followed him back to the bed, and watched while Bruce peeled back the bandages around Tony’s middle, swallowing the bile at the back of his throat as the sickly-sweet stench of putrid flesh permeated the room.
He looked so sad and lost that Tony wanted to hug him but he stopped. Because Natasha was walking their way, looking neither sad nor lost.
It was barely a strain on his eidetic memory. The last and only time that had worked was a long time ago, when he was three.
Heavy eyelids fluttered to a close as the disjointed images of an old memory came to him. There was the brilliant glow of the heartstone, and no less bright, the frightened blue eyes, hot tears falling from them and soaking through his thick clothes, the small, pale hand gripping his wrist and the soft, sweet voice telling him not to close his eyes, pleading with him to watch a conical seed spin and fall, over and over, until Tony fell into a deep slumber.
“You’re right. It’s not,” Bucky agreed, as he smoothed Ronan's silk robes. “It’s hers,” he explained, and stepped aside as Nat came forward.
Steve’s heavy sigh was lost in the din of busy attendants hurrying past them with serving trays and plates, and anything he tried to say after that was drowned out by the blare of the ceremonial horn.
I commissioned this piece for myself as a reward for finishing the story, but never got around to posting it. It was done by the amazing
“I love you,” Tony said, feeling light-headed at the confession. It was hard to breathe, and he felt dizzy, like they’d left the atmosphere.
Against the red of his shirt, he barely noticed, but his hands, his wedding band, were soon covered in blood. Red on gold. Then gold on red. White spots in his vision. Before it all went black.
It was with this in mind that he drove towards the rendezvous point in downtown Brooklyn, to meet the living legend who was Steve Rogers. Over a cup of weak coffee and a slice of something, Tony would listen to his life story and find a way to reward him for bravely coming to his parents’ aid. Then, they would part and be on their merry way.
Steve peered at it, examining it from different angles. “It seems to generate some form of electricity.”
Tony sat on the ground, back against his bedroom door the moment it closed. He forced himself to take deep breaths to slow the furious beating of his heart.
“No,” Steve answered with some difficulty. “Nothing specific, but swift and decisive would probably be best.”
“No?” Loki asked, when no one responded, and went on, his eyes sparkling with mischief. “It might be just a story, but I’ve learned that if you tell a story to the universe so cosmically perfect, for a single, shining moment, the world would believe it - and that is all that matters.”
Howard had never been one to stay still, too concerned about the world around him and its progress. He could finally rest now. Tony was thankful for his father’s influence, one which inspired him to change their world.
Then he went crashing from the high, plummeting perilously towards the ground. “J, don’t be a stranger! Break the ice!”
wasn't ready and he wasn't in the mood for awkward elevator talk. He’d just about made it to the top when the elevator slowed down and stopped. He shuffled inside, avoiding eye contact with the new arrival.
They'd offered him the same hospitality, and had gone out of their way to give him a warm welcome. Still, Tony constantly felt out of place amongst this horde of hardened warriors. Sure, he was fairly proficient with his sword, having taken extensive lessons as a child, but whom was he trying to kid? In terms of combat experience, he had none, with how he'd been forbidden from participating in even a tourney or a joust.
Steve had leapt from Tony’s back and covered the distance between the two dragons with an impressive somersault, before landing neatly on Glaive’s lower back, his shield on his arm.
Steve’s face hardened with determination as a gold, sparkly circle opened up above them. “I think you’ll find
And sometimes, when Tony was feeling a little bold, he would slip in the odd item he really wanted. He hated himself for taking advantage of Steve’s kindness. But the temptation was just too great to resist.
The face plates went down and the shooting began. They worked in tandem, targeting the grey comets who dared to approach, burning up anything that got too close, leaving behind their trails of dust.
From behind the furious beast, Tony spied two growing specks in the sky. “You might want to look into the icing problem,” he said.
But she wasn't going to give in without a fight. “I’m allowed to have my secrets. I’m not the one who signed that report.”
Tony was the brightest thing he’d ever seen, the warmest thing he’d ever touched. And the sparks had flown between them. Loving someone like Tony meant getting burnt, but Steve didn’t care. All he wanted was to be smothered in the heat, to feel his pink lips melting into his own, and to drown in those pools of liquid gold which blazed with passion and desire -
There was another pause, then Loki’s rich, silky voice lured them back to the story, with enticing new images of its setting and secondary characters. “A benevolent dragon, Rex craved neither power nor riches, embracing a solitary life in the great lakes of Vanaheim. Sadly, kings and nobles, warriors and mages from all over the nine realms coveted his abilities, and they desired his powers for themselves. And one day, the humans decided to combine their magic to create a monster to challenge Rex.”
Perhaps, a different poem was written in draconic. The Anguisians would tell of a dragon who lived in peace before the men arrived, clad in cool metal, with cold eyes and colder blades, to pilfer their gems and gold and magic.
From where he stood, Steve could hear the sounds of a hundred pairs of boots, marching around the mountains in time with the drumming of his heart. Valoria was soon to be home to these warriors, their brothers-in-arms.
His expression softened at the sight of Tony. “If not for Prince Anthony, and you, I would have lost the last of my family, more precious than all the riches of the world. I am in your debt. If there is the slightest chance that the mindstone will aid Prince Anthony’s recovery, we will be honoured if you accept.”
“Why are we stopping?” Steve asked, when Bruce began wrapping the quill in a paper towel, as if preparing to dispose of it.
He didn’t have time to process the thoughts ravaging his mind because Coulson was back. “We have a location for Cap and Widow. The coordinates correspond to 29 Brickell Boulevard. It’s an 80-storey building in downtown Miami.”
“Well, we need you," Tony said apologetically. "You go on vacation for five days and everything goes to shit."
He forced his eyes to stay open as the wind blew on, causing the letters to move, again, and again, and again.
The corners of his thin violet lips turned up in a smirk. “But it is,” Thanos said lightly, and his voice reeked of confidence.
It lighted up. The panel above it lighted up soon after, then the next, one by one. Right before the last panel could light up and complete the cursor-like image, Steve broke the nearest window to them with his shield.
“Foxtrot is down. He’s unresponsive. We need EMTs,” Agent Hill said into her phone when she got there.
So, when it fell out of his hand, rolling away and disappearing among other nondescript rocks in a pile, he knew he’d lost it (the rock? their home? his mind? he didn’t even know anymore) for good. All he wanted to do was to curl up into a rock himself and wait for rescue, but this wasn’t even possible due to his broken ribs and shattered heart.
The interior was dark and cave-like, so flickering torches, held up by claw-shaped handles, were found along the finely-etched walls of tesselating scales. The back of the throne rose to the height of two fully-grown men and finished in a pair of majestic spiralled horns while armrests extended sideways to resemble arched wings. The seat was unusually wide, made for two dragons to sit on quite comfortably, or a particularly enormous one to lie on.
Tony squinted at the diving dragons, who looked familiar for some reason. “They’re the dragons from the mural,” he decided, and raised his arms to the storm clouds gathering above. “The prophecy - it’s happening today. It’s happening right now.”
Tony heard a whizzing sound on his left, then his right. Ivan’s tail was sparking up and coming down upon him. Tony froze, rooted to the ground, but Steve kept moving, in a medley of forward rolls and dives, till he was in front of him, shield in hand to take the impact of the lash.
Tony paused, sitting back on his heels. “Would it have made a difference?” he asked, “if I had told you?”
Tony stepped aside to grant her access to their home. As Sarah searched the cabinets for a tea set, Tony racked his mind for topics of conversation. Thankfully, the queen dowager was in no hurry to speak, content to set the table for breakfast - a combination of freshly-baked bread and fruit preserves, which was a welcome change from the suppers of stale bread and dried meat they had to make do with while travelling.
“It’s not just you,” Steve murmured quietly. “But, we barely know each other! Even the army didn’t want me. Why would you?”
Finally, the killer walked towards the surveillance camera and took aim, giving Tony an unobstructed, close-up view of his visage.
He loved him. Of course, he did. In the midst of hurt and disappointment, there had been love. And pride. Oh God. He’d loved him. And Tony, blinded by all his insecurities, had never seen it. Till it was too late.
“Look, Tony,” Steve said, peering closely at his face. “Are you up for this? Are you? I need to know, because everyone is blowing up. I have to go. Your friend Rhodes. Nat. They need help. You can do this. You know you can. But if you don't want to, you’re in the suit. You’re safe. You can fly out the window. Back to the tower or anywhere you like. I’ve got a tracker on it. I’ll find you. Once this is all over.”
