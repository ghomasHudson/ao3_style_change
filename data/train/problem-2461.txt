“I heard you.” His voice, at least on the surface, seemed to be devoid of any emotion. But John senses an underlying tremble. John sees his Adam’s apple bob as a pregnant pause stretches before them.
They pick a place with outdoor seating and though John feels his pocket vibrate he doesn’t dare check it. Not with Mary smiling her smile at him, he still can’t tell its inviting or a warning but he won’t take his chances. Now, if it was Sherlock’s smile he’d know exactly how to proceed, if it was a smirk he’d tease him, a closed mouth smile he’d dismiss him and carry on, a full smile and he’d smile right on back and agree with whatever Sherlock had been saying.
John wonders if this is a new development in light of recent events or if this has been going on since before. Honestly, John wouldn’t be at all surprised if Sherlock following him wasn’t new; Sherlock had no concept of personal space or privacy.
And there it was. That teensy little black mark on John’s otherwise impeccable record. The topic John’s being trying to skirt around for weeks. His horrifying, humiliating, and heartbreaking lapse judgement that’ll probably scar him for the rest of his life. It seemed the best answer at the time, the easiest way to escape the pain and mundane routines that his life had become. He didn’t just lose his best friend, he watched him swan dive off a building right in front of him. He figured if the great Sherlock Holmes could commit an atrocity such as that, what was stopping him.
“You said you wouldn’t do again.”
It takes a minute, an eternity, but he does. John gives in. He looks and he was right, immediately looking forward he was met with those all-seeing eyes. Sherlocks eyes were hard, trying to make John understand. John focuses on what’s the same: that familiar blue, those long black eyelashes. It’s what he remembers from the time before the fall. When he could look at Sherlock unabashed.
John moves forward, not even all that much, and suddenly he’s kissing Sherlock. Mess forgotten the only thing John can focus on is Sherlock's mouth and how warm and soft it is. And Sherlock, he’s kissing him back. His hands had come off the counter and are now fisting into the back of John’s shirt. He’s sloppy and unpracticed, but John doesn’t care. He’s kissing Sherlock and everything feels right. He’s about to move forward, even closer, when it hits him.
Sherlock’s head snaps to the side and John barely manages to look away in time not to meet his eyes. He hesitates like he was debating whether or not to tell John, but went ahead anyway, “A few days before we met in the restaurant. I met with Mycroft and he debriefed me on what was going on during my absence.”
*****************
caught the man and had only been out of Sherlocks’ view for less than 10 minutes.
Sherlock beelines for the couch and for a second John’s just stood there, unsure of what to do. So, he does was he always does and heads straight for the kitchen.
“I won’t,” he repeats resolutely. Like he needs John to understand.
Sherlock opens his mouth for a long moment but does not say anything. “I’ve realized, somewhat belatedly, that this can be a sensitive subject. However, this is something that cannot be tip toed around any longer, John.”
John can’t help the bubble of laughter that makes its way from his throat, “You don’t have to announce yourself, Sher—”
So, John tells him and as he does a very small, vindictive part of himself is glad to see Sherlock squirm. Sherlock can hear with his own two ears, from John’s own mouth the agony he wrought. Though, he tamps down that feeling before it could grow too much.
It was like this with everything. Them shifting to accommodate the position of the other, the almost deliberate creation of unnecessary noise to broadcast their location in the house. If John had bothered to go back to seeing his therapist she’d tell him that this was an unhealthy amount of codependence they were displaying.
“Hello John,” she says somehow in a mix between brash and gentle. She moves deeper into the room, leaving the door open behind her. “It’s almost time for your lunch break, right? Want to go somewhere?”
“Don’t you already know?” John asked, stalling.
“Look at me!”
“Kill yourself, John,” Sherlock clarifies himself like John’s an idiot. He’s trying to sound like he’s unaffected, but John doesn’t miss the way his fingers are thrumming in a blur on the sides of the table. Joh tries to think back and recall if Sherlock had this nervous tick before, or was it a new addition, like so many things were in their rebudding relationship.
He picks up a takeaway on his way back to 221B and he can admit that he’s stalling. Taking his time because he really doesn’t know where he and Sherlock stand at this moment. Sure, he left his girlfriend for the man and said man seemed all for that. But, he didn’t think Sherlock had ever been in a relationship before, hell, the man barely even had a real friend before John came along. He’d never really seen Sherlock as the relationship type and he definitely didn’t see him doing any relationship type things.
For a moment John doesn’t know what he’s on about. They’re both sat in the living room, John in his chair typing up a case and Sherlock on the couch fiddling with something or other. It catches him off guard because he finally,
“Mary,” He said her name in tone John couldn’t quite place. John nodded, unwillingly to say more on the matter.
John supposes they do say it.
“Would you still do it?” he repeats. Sherlock leans forward across the table, his ever-tapping fingers sliding until they stop on either side of John’s elbows, bracketing him in. He’s bent halfway across the table, his face inches from John and it takes everything John has not to meet his eye.
not having apologized for it and Sherlock at John for his supposed idiocy and suicide contemplation.
Sherlock cuts him off in one hissing snap, “What am I supposed to think John?”
But, inexplicably he’s saved as Scotland Yard rushes in. Flashlights glaring in his and Sherlocks eyes break them of their stand-off. Sherlocks in full consulting detective mode as he shouts out orders and complains about their tardiness. And John’s just glad he can escape this conversation for a few more moments still.
***********************
Well that was the understatement of the year. Was he still a bit mad over the whole situation—of course, but overall, he’s forgiven Sherlock. He had explained before why he did what he did and although at the time John wasn’t in the right frame of mind to hear it, he accepted in now.
Sherlock had to know what this meant, had to know how important this was and there was no going back. He was John’s and John was his, that was the way it was and the way it was going to be forever.
It’s the closest they could get, they’re only synonym to their anonymous word that had no equal. It feels good, John thinks, to hear it out loud. He knew, of course he knew, but it’s a whole other thing to hear the words from Sherlocks mouth.
That was the crux of it. “Because you’ve left Mary to return here. Because you write about me so kindly. They mean to accuse us of indecency.”
He was there, golden in the warm soft pool of lamplight, reading—weary about the eyes, a little wistful in the mouth, but calm, and safe.
. John had snorted, openly dismissive, but the idea had stuck in Sherlock’s mind.
Yes, Mrs. Hudson definitely knows what’s going on.
I found him by the window in his dressing gown, wild, remote and beautiful in the morning light, swaying, and playing his heart into the air.
“Please marry me.” I could barely talk. “John, marry me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“God in Heaven!” was the muffled exclamation from the kitchen, and my heart bounded up in near-painful relief as she appeared at its door, wiping her hands on her apron. “What is it?”
Not everyone can smell cyanide, but I’ve decided Holmes is among the portion of the population genetically capable of it.
“Thank you,” he murmured, but it was clear he was not all right.
"Yes, of course." His voice—oh, his voice; warm and dry and beautiful. I blinked hard against the impact of it; turned from him to look round at the dangers still inherent in the setting. We were not yet safe.
“I’d like to know.”
How little we know of the future. By the time Mycroft, in a remarkable coachman's cape, had dropped him at Ludgate Station at half seven, to find me hidden away in our compartment in clerical disguise, I was very much enjoying myself. And then, to return across the Channel, not alone but with him at my side!—The wind lifting his hair off his brow as we looked out across the waves, the blue of his eyes reflecting the bright noon sky. I felt as though luck loved me. I bought him a penny bun at the quay in Calais where I had sat alone with the birds, thinking of him. I carried his bag onto the train. I told him stories, of the months past and the strangers I had met and the gendarmes’ horror at my behaviour, as we rode the night through to Brussels. I made him laugh, and held his arm, and stroked it sometimes, and he let me do it. We fell asleep together on the seat, breathing as one in the darkness.
“Holmes,” he said, and through the exhaustion in his voice alertness sounded suddenly, “what’s wrong?”
Dearest boy,
And you are much better at tending to me than you know. In fact no one has ever taken such care over me as you have. I have only ever found you generous of soul.
“After Monday,” I said.
“No, you won’t,” I said, and reached for the hand again, and squeezed it, so he knew I didn’t mind. “Unless you solve it. Wake me up and tell me all about it at arse o’clock, when you get in.”
I used to sleep longer. I wake up, now, feeling as though there is something to do, and then I remember I can do nothing until we know who it is that followed me to the Fall. Who I overlooked. So I make myself a cup of cocoa (I keep a tin of the powder and a kettle of water by the fire) and I walk down to the river. There are always a few birds awake, even before dawn. I never go into the laboratory until the clock strikes eight. I am trying to avoid notice. A mad chemist working his experiments in the dark of the morning might get talked about.
He loved me, I knew that, as a man loves a brother-in-arms, or a knight his shield-bearer. He would likely argue that I am the knight, and he my shield-bearer, but I differ. Still he wasn’t wholly mine any longer, but Mary’s, and steadfast at her side six days out of seven. I couldn’t trust myself to see him for a while after he left me. Whatever he might have needed from me then, it wasn’t the only self I could find in those weeks, the furious and lonely self bared and howling for what I had lost, for a quick smile every bright morning across the breakfast table; for his step at my side, unmistakable as a signature, one stride caught up just slightly short in memory of Afghanistan and a burning bullet; for a gentle hand tucked into my elbow, or touching my shoulder as he passed; for the low, warm laugh I could provoke when we were sleepy and talking nonsense by the fire—just for his company.
Watson's friend Dr. Maxwell's views on male intimacy as a natural experience were common enough among the rural and working class. But they were rarer in the educated classes and officially condemned by established medical opinion. A few gay men were writing accounts of their own experiences by the end of the 19th century, and there was organized legal and social activism taking place, but a medical exploration of gay intimacy as a healthy human developmental variation would be published for the first time (I think) in 1914 by Dr. Magnus Hirschfield ("The Homosexuality of Man and Woman," with data collected from 10,000 participants), five years prior to the foundation of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft--the Berlin sexology institute and center for activism. The Institute's library, 20,000 collected works on trans and gay life, was raided and burned by the Nazis in 1933, and the center closed. Hirschfield was also an active member of the WhK, a German organization founded in 1897 to advocate for full social and legal acceptance of LGBT citizens.
"I believe that brings us to the present. We stand under imminent threat to our lives, outside British jurisdiction, with nothing to do but await danger. As we have done many times before. As I have longed to do again, as many times as you’ll have me. So, Holmes, I'd like to propose what you will not. Let us return to where we left off. You have just called me by my name, and in such a tone that I really must leave the room, or else—"
“You spoke to them?” I pushed myself up on my elbow, the better to see him. He blinked, and hesitated, searching for words; met my eyes again.
“I suppose not,” Mycroft agreed. “And I will not make suggestions regarding the letter, but--”
It was a crochet hook—the thing she’d thrown. It had rolled under the sofa, but I got it out and regarded it, bemused. It sat slender, blue, and innocent in my hand. I could see no reason for Sherlock’s dismay in it.
I woke in bed from a dreamless sleep to his weight settling behind me, his arm sliding about my waist, his breath on the back of my neck.
“John,” he answered; halted, searching my expression. Speechlessness had proven a good omen between us before.
The days wore on; and we went on together, as close as we could be when he slept six miles distant from my door. Some days he appeared cheerful and steady, and seemed to have forgotten we had ever spoken of his troubles. But sometimes I saw him grieving silently, and a little bitterness crept into the corners of his mouth that had only held gentleness and good-humour in its generous shape for years. I watched him sinking into himself with no little horror: I had forgotten the look of John regretting himself. I despised it. Of all men alive he was the one least fit to wear that look; and it was the sight of him slumped in the corner of a hansom, staring sightlessly down at his clasped hands, with almost a sneer on his lip, that finally broke my reverence for his privacy. We had been talking of the case just concluded, but had fallen into silence as I ruminated with still-uncomprehending interest (my Lord, the arrogance of me) over the fact the the Professor’s name had come up once again, this time in connection with the financier of a dealer of weaponry among the shabbier and more desperate gangs. I had been rambling on, but I glanced up at last, and saw that look on his face, and found myself saying, apropos of nothing, “Nothing has cured you?”
They’re sitting across from each other at the kitchen table. Sherlock, with his eyes glued to a spot just above John’s right shoulder and his fingers once again thrumming anxiously against the table top. John, meanwhile is leaning back in his chair, arms crossed, trying to exude a sense of calm he does not feel.
thought they had moved past this subject. But, leave it to Sherlock to never let something go; he probably had an entire wing dedicated to it in his mind palace.
The house is empty and Sherlock’s gone. John’s left alone and Sherlock’s gone. He could be dead again and Sher—
“Hmm.” John rooted around the cupboards and fridge finding them devoid of anything edible. “You haven’t got any food in here Sherlock! When’s the last time you’ve eaten?” John knows it a useless question as soon as he asks it, he and Sherlock have been on a case. Sherlock doesn’t eat on cases.
“How long did you know?” John doesn’t need him to specify more, they’ve been avoiding the topic so long it seems to be the only thing they can think about.
“What about when my phone’s off?” He remembers very clearly Sherlock popping up wherever he was even when his phone had died or he had forgotten it somewhere.
Mary or Sherlock.
John let out a deep sigh, leaning the back of his head on the dresser alongside Sherlock’s. He wasn’t gone, he just hand Sherlock style errands to run. He didn’t leave John, he wasn’t dead. John didn’t have to go to that place again. Because he was sure that if history repeated itself he couldn’t endure it.
And although he still hurts about Mary, it’s a dull ache that he hardly ever notices. And even then, he only mourns for the loss of previous friendship and everything he thought he still owed her. But, Sherlock more than makes up for every minute stab of pain with explosions of happiness. John doesn’t think the reverse would be true if he had chosen differently.
Sherlock wants everyone to know that John is his and he is Johns’. Where John was never really a big fan of PDA before, he basically had no choice with Sherlock. Whether it was lap sitting in a cab or on the underground, hanging off John at restaurants, or even kissing him in the middle of conversation with Lestrade at crime scene. Sherlock had no restraints.
**************
But, there’s something he can’t quite place. Something deep down in the core of his being that is preventing him from loving her like he used to. “Of course, Mary, I’m sorry,” he says, looking into her eyes. He could do it with her, had been doing it since everything. It didn’t make his heart lurch to try and look Mary in the eyes as it did with Sherlock. In fact, he could look everyone in the eye, everyone except Sherlock.
Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed!
certainly has.
They had never been this close before, John thinks distantly as he slips his eyes closed. Sherlock wasn’t really pressed against him, he used his hold on John’s knees to keep their bodies from mashing into one another.
Truthfully, he hasn’t seen Mary in almost a week, he hasn’t been back since she kicked him out. He still hadn’t had an answer for her. Even so, this was a betrayal. He never thought he’d be the man to cheat on his girlfriend, yet here he was. He loved her, he did and once he figured out how to balance her and Sherlock he’d… well, John wasn’t exactly sure what he’d do.
“Sherlock?” his voice comes out broken and breathy. His wide-open eyes are trained on the bridge of Sherlocks’ nose and John can see the tips of his long black eyelashes from his eyes being splayed so largely. “I thought—” he couldn’t finish the sentence and surely Sherlock knew what he thought.
John closes his eyes as Sherlock brings his hands up around either side of John’s face. But, Sherlock doesn’t say anything just leans his forehead against John’s as they breathe in tandem.
Sherlock keeps his promise. He never goes anywhere without John and John suspects that he, himself, never goes anywhere without Sherlock. Whoever thought that the two of them couldn’t get any more inseparable, were wrong. If they were close before, they might as well be conjoined now. All pretense of trying to stay away a respectable distance away for the benefit of others flew out the window the day of their second kiss.
He isn’t the least bit surprised when Sherlock actually does.
*******************
“Hey, what happened to my chair?” he asked, facing Sherlock directly now. Still his eyes were kept carefully trained at Sherlocks chin. He still couldn’t look, not yet, not after everything.
John’s about to start up again in one big huff, but Sherlock continues, “You won’t look at me! I spend half the day trying to catch your eye. You avoid it like plague. At first, I figured it was due to you being angry with me, then that passed. Next, I believed it to do with you thinking you were keeping something from me, a lie of omission about your sui—deviances, but, that too passed.”
He makes to open his mouth, to apologize or to defend himself he doesn’t know; but she barrels on through. “I suppose you and Sherlock have made amends.” She doesn’t phrase it like a question and she’s stopped looking at him in favor of browsing through the menu. “Honestly, I am not all that surprised. From what you’ve told me of your past relationships, its’ seemed likely this would happen.”
“Not for leaving—that was unavoidable, as you know. However,” Sherlock hung John’s coat back on the rack and proceeded to take a seat on the sofa, “I admit I…miscalculated the effect my absence would have on your psyche.”
“The end of my lease was coming up—perfect timing I thought. I moved everything out, gave it most of it to a shelter. And I…I booked a hotel, packed a few of my clothes and took a couple days off from work. I was going to do it in the morning, after I’d had my tea,” his lips lift in a soft quirk, in hindsight that was a very John thing of him to do. “I had everything in order, the room cleaned to perfection, my things neatly packed away. A note on the bedside table and a silencer on my gun.”
“What’s this?” he asks gruffly. His thumb swiping over the cut on John’s bottom lip. John twisted his head from Sherlocks’ grip and runs his tongue over the cut he hadn’t realized was there. He supposes he must have gotten it when he wrestled the culprit to the ground.
When Sherlock brings it up again its three days later at 7 o’clock in the morning.
John is being the saint of a friend that he is and is picking bits of gore from Sherlock’s black curls. Sherlock, being wrongfully taller than John, is leant against the counter; legs bent, back hunched, and head lowered with his hands bracing himself on the countertop so John can get at his head.
“Then why?” there was slight break to her voice. A small exposure that showed she wasn’t as angry and untouchable as she liked to portray.
***************************
“Mary, I’m sorry— “John tries to start but he is bowled over once again.
“Hmm.” He parroted back at John. “I’ve eaten. Mrs. Hudson has left a few biscuits around.”
“John,” Sherlock says, dragging John’s attention back towards him, “John, I’m going to kiss you now.”
” Sherlock’s voice shocks John out of his disturbing mantra of ‘Sherlock’s gone’. “John. John? I’m here, I’m right here.” He shifts closer now, crouched right in front of John, his long fingers curled around each of John’s knees.
“Tell me how you were going to do it. Tell me why you didn’t.” Suddenly John feels a weird sensation come over him. An intense, heavy feeling that he hasn’t felt in a long while. It’s the feeling of Sherlock staring at him. It’s an impossible feeling to miss even if you were the most oblivious person in the entire world. The severity of his gaze is what John believes is one of the main reasons people find Sherlock off-putting. It penetrated through you, into your whole being and John supposes it’s also why he’s the world’s only consulting detective.
John doesn’t say anything, just inclines his head to confirm his listening. So, Sherlock keeps talking, “He informed me of your situation and your expressed desired to end your life.”
“I won’t, John.” His voice his steady and strong, filled with a promise John knows he can trust.
That wasn’t the case this morning though, when John cleared the last step Sherlock was nowhere in sight. Panic gripped his heart in a white-hot flash. He moved quickly to the kitchen only to be met with a similar view from the living room. His breath caught in his throat as he spun round to check Sherlock’s room. He didn’t even bother with knocking, just wrenched Sherlock’s door open and stepped inside.
Sherlock shoulders his way past the small crowd and maneuvers himself through the sea of tables until he’s standing directly in front of John. “You weren’t answering your phone,” he says in lieu of an actual greeting. His mouth is set in a hard line and his right hand playing with his phone in his pocket.
As he thinks about this he realizes Sherlock is, at least partially, correct. While he did love Mary for her smile and who she was; a lot of it was him idolizing her for rescuing him. She was there when he felt he had no one and he supposed, somewhere in his mind, he thought that the only payment he could give her was his love. Even if it wasn’t really there.
As it turns out Captain John Watson can run from his problems. At least briefly, and John suspects that’s only because Sherlock has allowed him to. He’s avoiding Sherlock to the best of his abilities, which means almost not at all because he can’t stand to be five feet away from the man.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock steps away from the counter, towards John, his fingers finally dropped from his mouth. He’s looking at him somewhat sadly, like he knows something and John hopes this doesn’t ruin their relationship. “John,” Sherlock says firmly.
John knows exactly what he means, exactly what he’s trying to say. There’s no word, he knows, nothing to describe this feeling.
A new addition of their tentatively rebuilding relationship is that they can’t very well seem to let each other out of sight. Though still not meeting each other’s eyes, and John was now certain that Sherlock wasn’t trying to meet his either—his chin was angled wrong and his head was tilted in quite not the right direction, they had to be in each other’s space or ear shot constantly. Like now, Sherlock’s in the kitchen fiddling with some experiment while John is sat in his chair-which popped back up sometime last week- reading, which meant his back would have been turned to Sherlock. But, as soon as Sherlock meandered his way to kitchen, John’s body and eyes tracked his. Sherlock stood up and John sat straighter, his eye coming to rest somewhere on Sherlocks right shoulder. As Sherlock took the few steps it took him to get to the kitchen, John angled body his more and more so that his chest was lain against the arm of the chair, his book dangling in the air in front of him. And Sherlock, who normally performed his experiments stood at the right side of the table, shifted everything over to the left. So, now he could see John’s head peeked out from over the side of the chair.
"Does she always flirt with you that much?" Sherlock's voice was petulant and small.
Sherlock scowled and glared at the biscuits as if they'd personally offended him. They loved John's gingersnaps and Sherlock watched them gush with praise. It wasn't a surprise when John won Star Baker that week. John was beaming and Sherlock smiled with pride when everyone clapped. His applause was loudest of all.
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully. "Fascinating."
"I cannot, Mike. He's always on my mind, even when I'm doing something else, he's always on the peripherals of my mind palace, looking in the windows, beckoning to me, sitting himself in my chairs like he owns the place. Make it stop!"
They got a cab just outside the station. “Where to?” The man asked. Sherlock gave John a long-suffering look, one that the doctor had no sympathy for.
“That’s a nice collar.” Logan said, admiring the strip of leather around Sherlock’s throat. “Did your dom give it to you?”
“Take paracetemol for your elbow and try not to use it. Avoid alcohol and exercise for the first 48 hours.”
“With a gun?” Sherlock looked up at Mike, eyes wide.
“Hi Sherlock.” Mike said. “Just showing John around.” He gave the doctor a triumphant smile and unlocked the door.
“Hyperthyroid.” Sherlock said. “I saw it written at the top of his chart. Jenkins metabolized the drug quickly. That likely saved his life.”
What could he do for John? He did another search for different ways to please dominants and rolled his eyes at half the results. He didn’t think John would care about fluffy handcuffs and rose petals on the bed.
“You’ll do no such thing!” Mycroft snapped.
“Listen to me very carefully, John. The only reason Sebastian was allowed to carry on hurting my brother was because I didn’t know what was going on.” His lips tightened a little and he closed his eyes briefly and John guessed he was probably still beating himself up about it. “I will not make that mistake again. If I get even a
“The fucker had it coming.” John snarled.
do you want?!” Sherlock tore out of his soaked gown and flung it at the sofa before storming down the hallway to the bedroom.
Sherlock smiled weakly. “That’s, that’s…”
Sherlock did.
"I come bearing gifts."
“Good boy.” John pulled his fingers out. “You have a healthy prostate at least.” He peeled the glove off and tossed it aside, pleased. Sherlock was hardly prudish. Given his past experiences, John half expected him to be really wary of another dom. He was a little rusty and out of practice maybe, but that was easy to work with.
They heard a cough and stepped apart like teens caught making out between classes. John’s face flamed up pink and Sherlock beamed at Nina.
Sherlock took his gown off and pulled on boxers and a loose Tshirt, then turned off the light and got into bed and curled up on his side. He would go to his palace tomorrow and deal with the case. John would likely want to talk tomorrow too, about all of this. The doctor was laying flat on his back, stiff as a board behind him, and Sherlock rolled his eyes. No doubt John was mentally beating the hell out of himself back there.
Two laptops were open the dark wood desk, the screensavers shifting and twisting with glowing rainbows of color. A mess of papers were scattered along one side of the desk and pens were tossed haphazardly over the surface. A cold mug of tea was beside John's laptop. Another, nearly empty mug of who-knows-how-old coffee rested on the mantle beside the antique knife jammed in the post. Detritus items, a dog shaped marble paper weight, a box of matches, a sudokube, no less than three china teapots, a plastic storage container with Sherlock's name on it, and the violin case littered the floor behind the green chair. The fireplace was dark with oily soot and grey ash and a pile of neatly sliced pieces of pine sat beside the metal grate. The metal fruit bowl was empty on the coffee table and a pile of women's magazine's and medical journals nearly obscured the dented wooden table surface. One of the green glass pocket kitchen doors was half opened. Used lunch dishes were piled in the sink and the room smelled vaguely of coriander and cumin. The yeasty scent of baked naan hung in the air like the motes of dust caught in the rays of the setting sun. The curry aroma blended oddly with the scent of cooking sugar and cloves filling the hall downstairs by Mrs. Hudson's flat. Billy the skull kept watch over all the silent chaos.
“Anthony was your sub?” He asked.
Alicia stared at him. “I was.” She said. “My brother helped me through it. I was only in Defense for a day, but I
"Fuck off, Sally." Sherlock rolled over and buried himself in the blankets. He heard her slam the cabin door. He was fine, fine. He would never see John again‒had broken his promise to him, in fact, but that was just something they all had to live with. There were other concubines. Other
different.” Something seemed off. Sherlock watched John secure the chain so he wouldn’t slide out of place and he bit his lip. This was different to the usual sweet and sexily dominant Doctor who he’d been living with. This John was far more focused. His eyes were dark and his lips a deep red. His jeans were tented a bit at the crotch and his shoulders and back were tense. He picked up the plug and grabbed the lube. He looked at his sub admiringly. “Mm, look at you. Completely at my mercy.”
“Good to know.”
“Wait for me in bed.” John told him in a soft voice as he tapped two white pills out of the bottle.
“Fine.” Mycroft strolled out into the stairwell. “Good day, brother.”
"I'm sorry you lost your team. Jim murdered them?"
you’re sore.”
“I don’t approve of that at all, Holmes.”
“Good.”
“Thank you for picking this up.” John said, taking his own bite. “I appreciate it.”
“I think I’m done here.” Sherlock gave Sally a smug wink and turned to stride away from the scene.
Sherlock grunted.
John looked up at her, wondering if he looked as wrecked as he felt. He smiled helplessly. "I got attached."
“Sausage? Maybe some fried tomatoes?”
Sherlock shook his head fast. "No, John."
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
He plucked the arrow from the tree.
John had bailed him out of jail. At Mike’s request.
“You never know when you’ll need a good doctor around!” Mike cheerily. "Oh! Uh, that other person I mentioned? That's going to be here tonight?"
"Yes, you will. You're so strong, John. He's just awful! He hurts everyone. C'mon. I can make you feel better." He stood up after a moment and she walked with him slowly to accommodate his aches.  "Just to the baths." She said. "You have to get clean."
The meeting was long and pointless and when Sherlock returned to his rooms he’d found a letter had been sent.
Throughout this, John still cannot get his eyes to meet Sherlocks, even though he can feel them pining him down across the table. However, he does see the straining of his fingers, the hardness of his lips, and the furrow in his brow. He carries on, because this is what Sherlocks asked for and it’s the least he can do.
“I don’t suppose you thought of this but, I daresay I felt your absence just as equally as you felt mine.”
“And then my phone went off.” He huffs out a small laugh. “A reminder for Harry’s birthday the next day.”
*****************************
“I was there for you John! I was always there for you.”
“Yes, Sherlock, I did,” John sighed. He said it and he meant it. He didn’t feel like that anymore, John didn’t want to kill himself. It was a stupid decision, he realized that. John Watson, in this present moment and for the foreseeable-and hopefully far off- future did not plan on taking his life.
“How do you keep finding me?” John asks, warming his hands on his cup. It was an especially frigid day, even inside the restaurant he couldn’t completely fight off the chill.
(See the end of the chapter for
John doesn’t know what to do. What is he supposed to do, he’s spent all this time and effort loving her in a way he doesn’t. It feels wrong to him, like she’s been of use to him and now he doesn’t need her anymore. He doesn’t know if he can just discard her like that.
And we're almost to the end. Only a chapter or two left. Thanks for reading and pleases leave a kudos, it motivates me!
Sherlock was wringing his hands together and he hadn’t turned to face John. He was continuing to stare intently at something on the fire place. “It was blocking my view to the kitchen.”
John pushes his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth and tracing it over the back of Sherlocks teeth and when the man shutters into him, John pulls away. He doesn’t want to go too fast, doesn’t want to rush into things. He’s not sure of what Sherlock has and hasn’t done, John doesn’t know Sherlock’s limits.
Sherlock appeared to be struggling with himself. Mycroft waited without impatience, delicately stirring a third lump of sugar into his tea. Finally Sherlock looked up. “Sherrinford wrote to me. You must have known he’s--marrying. He’s asked us to the ceremony.”
When I reached our sitting room he stood over the mantle, staring into the hearth. The note lay open on the table.
My heart seized in my chest.
“Twitter? YouTube upload? Take out a billboard?”
Leave off pursuit of him, or I should face the consequences. "Then possibly my answer has crossed yours.”
“It’s all right,” he’d said, knowing that John might believe it, coming from him. “Whatever it is.”
He had risen with me, and was holding my arm, as though reluctant to let me out of his sight.
"What?" I said, bemused, and captivated.
“And so do I,” I said. But the truth is that I will be at home wherever he is, for better or for worse, as long as we live.
“I’ll go,” he said. His voice was barely changed. “I—Forgive me, Holmes, I hadn’t realised—Of course. It looks bad. I ought to have been more careful—in the timing—more circumspect in how I wrote of—you. I am sorry.”
“Yes, I do. My dear boy.” Compassion in his tone. “Shall I read you the morning news?”
This was quite true, but entirely beside the point, and, “Why didn’t you tell me?” was all I could find to say.
“You’ll be hungry in an hour,” he complained, some weeks after the first of these arguments.
“That some men sought other men? Of course I had. But it was always suggested there was a licentious excess there, not a difference in their essential nature.”
Even at Milverton’s unexpected entrance, while barely hiding ourselves in time, I felt no real misgiving; only some horror and a greater sense of sympathy as the woman he meant to destroy followed after, and brought him his end. John wrote that I held him back until the man was dead, and the woman gone, and then leaped out to rifle the cursed safe he kept full of his trade-secrets, and cast the letters there into the fire, before we ran out with all the house and a few policemen on our heels and took ourselves safely home.
He started, and stared. “Holmes!” was all the response I got at first, in a disbelieving tone, followed by a shake of the head, and then (most improbably) a small smile. “How on earth did you know what I was thinking of? No—” And for the first time since I had known him, he amended the question. “Never mind. I don’t need to hear how transparent I am."
“I was out playing the tables,” he said, finally. “I didn’t think you’d like it. I didn’t mean to stay at it so long.”
“No,” he shakes his head turning back to John. “A text from Lestrade, I’ve come to collect you.” He’s looking at John or past John, he can’t really tell and considers asking Mary about it later before he quickly dismissing the idea.
Sherlock pats the cushion next him, inviting John to sit, “I suppose I should also apologize for bringing your aforementioned suicide attempt. I do not believe that’s something you bring up in petty squabbles?”
After that first case, John had been beside him at every one after. His cane, after that very first case back, had been a non-factor. And John knew Sherlock had been deducing that, if the firm set of his lips and his long fingers steepled beneath is chin were anything to go by. John supposes that he’s been inferring a number of things about him since John’s been back as a daily presence in 221B. And John had been wondering things about Sherlock too.
“John! John! Wake up!”
“Lines?” He rubbed his backside again, the sting of John’s palm dancing delightfully over his skin. “No way. Can’t you just suspend me?”
“It’s an act.”
He lifted up and sank down and John grabbed his thighs and lifted his own hips to piston up into him. “Fuck, Sherlock, I want to throw you on the floor and take you from behind. I want to grind into you and fill you and make you beg for more.”
"Coppers!" A voice from the catwalks above them yelled. Sherlock looked up, alarmed. They had a lookout? Dee took off like a bird startled by a shot and headed for the concrete stairs that lead up to the overhang area. Sherlock darted after her at a dead run. He was not going to let her get away. This silly case had gone on far too long. By catching Dee, he would not only solve Mel's case, but put the Barsanti Brothers (honestly) out of business. Her feet slammed the stairs as she ascended. She was in trainers made for running, not fine leather shoes like him. He leaped up two steps at a time, gaining ground. Behind him, people shouted and scuffled and he distinctly heard Donovan shout, "get down and stay there!" It sounded like the coppers had caught Joel and that he was putting up a fight.
“That’s up to you. Will you wander off by yourself to visit a murder suspect ever again?”
"Because! Otherwise it'll all come out runny. Obviously it goes on top at the end. You've probably blown your whole technical challenge by mixing it in!"
“Jenkins said,” John began, “that he was picked up in Ferndale. He was walking along the road and could see by moonlight.”
"What are you writing so diligently in that notebook?"
protecting from me! I didn’t abuse him!”
"You sounded like you were reading your own death sentence." He smiled and propped his head up on his hand. "You hate it here, but then…" he looked at John from head to feet. "That’s obvious by the way you're standing."
He put his phone down and noticed warm hands stroking insistently over his bum. “Do you want to have sex?” Sherlock asked, turning around and hugging him close again. “I could probably manage for a bit…”
John went to the closest bag and opened it up, half expecting the Mad Prince's luggage to contain vials of chemicals, weird tokens like shrunken heads, bear teeth, or pickled pig snouts. He needn't have worried. A pile of clothes was stuffed within and John knew right away that the Prince had packed it himself. No valet worth his or her employment would have been so slapdash with the royal finery. He reached in and pulled out a deep burgundy silk shirt, wrinkled to hell. John shook it out and dropped it into a basket near the door. The laundry would have to be get those wrinkles out.
“Scoot closer to me.” John murmured. Sherlock shuffled forward until John’s cheek was pressed against his chest. John was able to reach the knots easier, but they were still pulled tight.
“Hi Mycroft.” John said lamely.
Sherlock took a deep, shuddering breath and sank deeper into the cotton.
“Yeah?” Greg said.
John nodded. It was encouraging that he wanted to. Seb had been in his life for so long. John wasn’t sure how willing he’d be to sever that contact.
Sherlock rubbed his scalp as John pulled his pants off and tossed them on top of the rest of his clothes.
“Because I didn’t tell you about this.” Sherlock gave him a nervous smile. “That was pretty rude of me.”
died! Look.” He held it up by the wing and John grimaced, a disgusted, “oh!” escaping his mouth as he stepped back. Two children kicking around football nearby stopped and watched.
John finished washing and put his loincloth back on. He left the baths smelling like fresh flowers and went to his medical bag he kept beside his pallet. He swallowed a bit of a concoction to help him get his cock up. It was Molly’s recipe that she had learned from a prostitute. It was old folk medicine with a base of toad venom and
“No. Stand under the heat. It’ll be good for your back.”
“Are you with the police?” Jenkins asked.
John invites Sherlock to enjoy one of his seasonal traditions: watching a movie.
was going to watch this someday and oh God he could hear Harry's teasing already
"It's black and blue. What happened?" She reached up to gently touch the sore skin.
He backed up, then turned to run—
"Why do you have to go there anyway?”
“A very satisfactory blowjob…and, everything else.”
cheat on him.” She said.
"That smells amazing." John called to him. Sherlock turned and wandered over to John's counter, eying his creamy tart.
"I'm fine." He smiled and brushed the leaves and clods of dirt from his arms. All his clothes were covered. The cloak had got the worst of it but his trousers were sodden and one arm was thick with mud. It had even gone down his boots. He scowled. The trip back to Chilgrave would be uncomfortable indeed.
"Oh goodness, of course." Sarah said. "Radiology's open."
“That was fast.” Lestrade mumbled. John buttoned his jacket and eyed Sherlock’s Belstaff enviously. An unseasonable chill cooled the air and it was only going to get colder as afternoon morphed into evening. Hopefully Sherlock could deduce quickly. Yellow police tape surrounded a rusty old skip. A few bright evidence markers dotted the concrete here and there and a coroner’s van was parked, the examiners ready to take the body away when the police were done.
“Good.” Fingers curled through his hair. “Remember your safeword. Use it if you need to.”
“There we go…” John said when Sherlock’s arse was pink and adorable. “Very good. Nice and warm for me. Get in whatever position you want, love.” He lifted his hands and Sherlock slithered onto his belly on the bed, grabbing the pillow close to his chest. He spread his knees and John squeezed a healthy dollop of lube into his palm and slicked himself up. “Perfect.” He slipped a finger inside his bum and felt around. “Nice and loose.” John leaned up and guided his cock carefully inside. Sometimes it took some time for partners to acclimate to his size. He and Sherlock had never done this before so he wanted to be careful. He didn’t need to worry though, as Sherlock shoved back and took John all the way to the root.
Sherlock startled at the sudden sound and again Logan was yanked out of his line of vision.
“Logan wanted to be sure I was comfortable.” Sherlock said. “I was cold, towards the end, and he saw me shivering and added kindling to the fire. He brought me water too. It was at odds with the fact that he’d been using me as a whetstone since I’d arrived. Maybe he thought he’d been remiss in his hospitality,” he added dryly, sipping the water. “I awoke in hospital with John and Mycroft.”
“Who’s this?” Mrs. Hudson starting walking towards Seb, laying there like a slug.
“Just a side effect of Defense. Into the shower.”
“Jesus Christ!” Lestrade pounded the brakes. The paper cup in his hand crumpled as he reflexively grabbed the wheel. Delicious coffee flew everywhere, soaking him and the seat and windows. He pulled over with a screech of tires and the body rolled off and into the gutter. He sat there for a moment, stunned, before he got out only a few yards up from 221. He crouched beside the man in the gutter and took a pulse, horrified and praying the guy wasn’t dead. There was a pulse, though faint. He needed a doctor. Lestrade stood up. He was right outside B. If John was in, he could pop down and examine him. Lestrade turned to walk to the door and stopped in his tracks. John was standing, fists clenched and feet planted shoulder width apart. He was smiling in a sort of grim, satisfied way at the man in the road.
Mrs. Hudson was loving every second.
It was tempting to cut him off, but Sherlock was curious. Doms didn’t apologize to him very often and the feeling was somewhat novel.
"What?" John blurted. “So this, what Jim does, it’s not normal?”
“I want to take your arse and your pretty mouth and make you ride me until we’re both screaming.”
Jim said something but John couldn’t make it out. Jim didn’t sound nearly so angry. The storm had passed.
“Give me all the gory details.”
John scrubbed over his face again.
"Hm. We'll see. We'll have to get about a gallon of arnica on the way home. Some food too."
with each other in safety and peace. The next insane case would come along soon enough and throw their lives into chaos again.
He nodded quickly. He believed her. He still didn’t trust his voice. His mouth was too dry to speak and his head was  a fog. When had he last had water?
Sherlock laughed.
"Dismiss? Nonsense. Just sleep in my bed. You look like you're about to fall over and I likely won't sleep tonight anyway.” He rubbed his thumb back and forth across his fingertips, distracted. “I slept yesterday."
Lestrade and John flew up the M11, siren blaring. Lestrade had called his friend Ian Nichols with the local police in Norwich, only able to tell him that their serial killer was possibly back in The Broads. John gripped the handle above the passenger door as Greg blazed up the thoroughfare, his teeth grit. Even with the siren on, it would take forever to get there. They had obnoxiously little information to go on, but Greg assured him the Norwich police were dutifully searching the huge area.
“John, it wasn’t hard. I’m fine.”
Sherlock stared at him. John’s normally dark eyes were still a few shades deeper, intense and focused on him. His lips had a touch more color to them and his gaze darted over Sherlock’s body, making notes of any lingering tension. He seemed…bigger somehow too. Like a dog bristling in the face of an attack. His scent was stronger too. Muskier. Defense in all its glory.
"He's mental. He likes to play with people. Toy with them. He's a nutter. Don't get too close. Anyone who gets too close gets hurt."
“No one is going to harm me, John.” Sherlock assured him. “You don’t need to be like this.”
Sherlock’s breaths slowed and steadied as John worked and the doctor grinned to himself, his pride swelling as Sherlock sank down into subspace under his hands.
“No.” Sherlock grabbed John’s wrist.
“But of course I didn’t.”
“Oh,” she waved her hand in a shooing motion, “I started that the first time John spent the night.”
It was nearing midnight in the palace. All the servants had gone to bed. John had woken up from one of his nightmares and he and Sherlock were now strolling the corridors, admiring the decorations: sweetly-scented pine branches, red and gold ribbons and shiny baubles sparkled in the faint candlelight.
“You have enough time. Write him now--tell him you’ve changed your mind. Get yourself made up. You can change at the club if you want. Did you keep the invitation?” He nodded. “Bring it: the doorman won’t care what you look like if you have it.”
“Do you believe it?”
“That’s true,” Ella had said. John shook his head.
I turned up the lamps, and picked through the pile of rejected requests atop my workbench, recovering several letters from the Lieutenant Général in Paris. He had offered me work across the Channel, well-paying work, with official protection. To accept his request would purchase me a little time, and space enough to let me breathe, away from our silent rooms, once John had gone. I might gather the funds necessary for any larger operation around the Professor, while giving my connexions time to work up the information I required.
I'd like to acknowledge that the use of first/last names was complicated, here. I can't imagine Watson, in love with Holmes, would refer to him formally in his private thoughts or writings, except occasionally out of habit. It's unusual in a Victorian-era fic, but it is rather satisfying to write. First names were also used among family, and often adopted when someone married in; so Mycroft calling Watson John, as well, shows strong support of his relationship with Holmes.
“What on earth do you mean?” Whatever I might have guessed, it wasn’t that. I couldn’t imagine a more satisfactory husband existed in England than John Watson.
“What? No.” He lifted his head to look at me, and his expression cleared and sharpened, and became more familiar, if still stunned. “It isn’t Mycroft, it’s Sherrinford. He’s asked us to his wedding.”
“Oh, I’d suspected.” He pulled back and looked up at me then, all rosy and golden in the firelight, and all unconscious of himself. “Yes, I worked for my later schooling. There was little left over for food, but I paid my way honestly. My father had debts, and after they were settled we hadn’t much left. I’ve never had a place I haven’t worked for.”
“Finish what?”
“Everything all right?”
He shrugged.
I had startled him again. I took a step back, and sat down in my chair; looked up at him, leaning now upon the mantel and drawing on his pipe in nervous bursts, studying me. “Of course. It’s your brother’s wedding, Sherlock.”
Had I felt less, loved him less, I might have been able to speak, to praise him as he should have been praised, and try to please him. All I could do was cling to him. At first he handled me softly, but then, as I met his kisses with my own, he began to hold hard to me, too; and all at once as I kissed his cheek I tasted tears there. I pulled back in surprise, and, "Sorry," he murmured, "I'm sorry," but I shook my head.
“So do I.” Mycroft is not unobservant of his brothers, nor is he a bearer of false hope. “Why didn’t he tell you before?”
“Once or twice.” She shook her head. “He’d give me his greetings on the way in, and say he didn’t need tea, he was just stopping in for a moment. I’d come up an hour later and find him standing in the middle of the room, staring at nothing. I think he borrowed a book, once, and another time he said he was looking for a missing letter. But I will say he looked sad when he went up, and better when he came down again, which makes one think, doesn’t it—him living all alone as he is, now. You’ll be going straight over to see him?”
Two days of calm followed, of sunlight, and street fare, and music in the evenings. Two days of his smiles across the breakfast table, his unmistakable step at my side, his hand on my arm, his warm laughter beside the fire in the homely dark. Two days of looking, looking, looking at him, knowing that he knew; watching him blink and fidget and brighten when he caught me looking. Thinking of how he had sounded when he'd said he loved me.
All at once it was quite clear what I had to do. I clambered back down to the path, and caught up my staff and my pack, with all my things, put up in preparation for our evening’s stay in the next town over—my money, papers, stockings and smalls, three forged passports, and a blanket roll. There was flatbread and sausage in the side pocket, wrapped in wax paper, and I could fill my flask in the river. It would do.
“Only yarn. A stupid lot of ridiculous, impossible–.”
Having watched the moon set as I boarded the train in Dover, I found myself in London, on Baker Street, at eight o’clock in the bright, crowded morning—just the time Mrs. Hudson would be setting out breakfast. I was strangely moved by every little thing around me—the shouts of the tin-mongers and the newspaper boys, the baker’s children playing kick-the-can in the gutter, the maids sweeping up the front steps, calling out gossip to each other, the elms just bursting into joyous leaf overhead. I thought of John, his hand tucked into my elbow as we came up that street through every change of light and shade and season, the two of us always in one mind. I thought of home.
He made no answer, but I felt him sigh. We lay quiet, listening to the birds in the eaves, and the wind in the trees beyond.
I had loved before. It was a word I would have owned at the time it happened, but I had not thought to use it since, after my mother’s horror at it, and the finality of my father’s silence. For years after I would have called what I had felt for Victor a kind of perverse greed, at the kindest, and yet I hadn’t even felt frightened when it began; only amazed, that he should like me so. When the holidays came I had asked him home to meet my parents—introduced him as a friend. They were very pleased. They hadn’t imagined Cambridge would have the effect they had never achieved in all my boyhood, of making me sociable. I didn’t mention that we’d met over an injury done to me by his dog; nor that he’d courted me with the offer of the dog’s company, as well as his own, while I was invalided on my couch, and couldn’t run away. I had preferred the canine’s society at first; only for a little while.
“I didn’t expect to speak of it,” I said, finally, when it was evident he was waiting for me.
“Yes.”
And oh, God, he says that so rarely, and he needs me so honestly. I caught his mouth again and kissed it slowly, breathing him in, until he made a sound past words, and then I let him go and said, “Yes.”
“Should I open it?” I said, breathing deeply through the pounding of my heart.
“I know of no impediment,” he said. “I love you: that will serve for our law.”

“How can I not? She’s lent me her strength throughout my confusion. I’m quite sure I owe her the truth as I know it. If I frighten her too much, she can tell me so; but you must understand this is a problem that belongs to us both. I asked her to share my life.” He still spoke bravely, but his eyes were growing desolate. To a man of his loyalty—
“Holmes,” with a laugh. “Have you been awake all this time?”
“So why do you suppose it’s still so difficult to do it? If that’s what you really want?”
But home at last, and well fed at Mrs. Hudson’s hands, and having whiled away the evening with work and music until we were certain the household had fallen into blessed sleep, I found myself very nearly afraid. The enormity of the thing settled on me. For a minute I could only stare at him, leaning on the mantelpiece, looking like an angel, till he said soberly, “Shall we?”
"Sit down," he said, pulling me on toward the fire. Obedient, I sat down on the settee. He remained standing before me.
“Was it sent from the Diogenes? Is he all right?”
"Hurry, then," I said, and he laughed. I watched him out of sight, and then turned again into the wind, to begin the last long ascent toward the Falls.
We had developed a simple code, years back, for use when our communiqués might be read: I became William Scott, a periodic patient of John’s, and any threats to my life or his were transformed into the guise of William's many imaginary illnesses. Any dedicated spy would see through the ruse in a minute, but a mere casual surveillor of John’s mail would miss the point. I wrote:
The situation explained, Mrs. Hudson looked a little alarmed, but said, “Well, I sha’n’t answer the bell, then, but I don’t mean to go anywhere. My sister’s coming at ten and I have a new novel for her.”
“Maxwell, your friend,” I said, finally. “Did he offer you any studies on the subject? Any evidence for his views?”
“My dear fellow,” I said, and stood to look him in the eye. He blinked before my gaze. His outrage wavered, his eyes fell. I reached out a careful hand, to rest upon his thin shoulder; held him firmly through the soft, worn silk of his rainy-day dressing gown. Sometimes he needed mooring. “Why didn’t you tell me you had another brother? I should have liked to know him sooner.”
“How did you know?” I might have sounded indignant, but she only laughed.
According to the timeline I'm using, Milverton was in January and the Fall in April, which means the months Holmes spent in Europe must have started just after Milverton's case ended. That would mean John was lying when he said he and Holmes had drifted apart, and hadn't seen each other for a long time, in The Final Problem--in fact they seem to have been living together during Milverton's case--and what would prompt that lie? Why wouldn't John have been working with Holmes in the months prior, except for during the Milverton case? Why is he suddenly living separately from Holmes in The Final Problem? I tried to answer those questions from a Watsonian perspective here--the Watsons' separation, John's depression, and the threat of blackmail seem reason enough.
“I--well, yes, I--”
"My dear man," he said. "It cannot have escaped your attention that the conditions in which I was promised a kiss have failed to materialise."
"Is this a honeymoon?" he asked, and at my abashment he began to smile. "It is!"
She shook her head. My soul sank, but she was saying, “It’s past hours. Come tomorrow—”
John has written of the blackmailer Milverton, and the drama surrounding his death, but he has not mentioned that his was the first case he accompanied me on, after seven months at Baker Street. Of course he was magnificent. I had told him all about my plan to break Milverton’s private safe, and take back my client’s information, without any thought that John would try to come, but he insisted. In fact, he quite sincerely proposed to turn me in to Scotland Yard if I wouldn’t accept his company. I was so pleased by that, in spite of myself, that I was in danger of becoming cocky as we made our furtive way through the sleeping house, quite outside the law. To have him home was joy; to have him again at my side, glorious in his courage, trusting, and radiantly absorbed in our task, was joy unspeakable.
“I—thank you. Forgive me, but suppose we didn’t do this—now?” His eyes were on my throat, newly uncovered; the contrast between the absorbed look and the brusque words stymied me.
You ought to see her, to learn how she is, if it would ease your heart. Let her know you wished to see her well. She cared for you, too, and I owe her a debt of gratitude for that.
He was waiting for me, when I returned, still standing by the fire. I could see he was nervous, too. I held up the book. “I thought I’d read a bit of the service proper, if I’m to be our priest,” I said. As I’d hoped, his expression dissolved into pure amusement.
The antique ring Holmes gives Watson actually exists, as described, except that there are two hearts entertwined between the hands.
I waited a moment till I was all right, then carried it to him. “Can you stay all day, then?”
“Yes!” Now he was starting to laugh too. “Yes, I want it, and yes, you ought to ask me, you idiot! Oh, my God.” He stared at me. He was waiting. I had to find words.
“Allow you!” Indignation in the words, and—hope. He stood and met my approach with such an expression. “Allow you, my dear fellow?”
“There were one or two who’d come near, and I admitted it, but, ‘Holmes is the only one now,’ I told him, and he smiled a little, as though he’d anticipated that. Well, he’s been reading the Strand, so perhaps he had. ‘I trust him with my life,’ I said, ‘and I think he feels the same.’”
A formal invitation to Sherrinford and Cox’s place outside the city limits came later, and we actually spent an afternoon there. Sherrinford looks like Sherlock--tall, slender, with unruly dark hair and a keen expression, but his face is bewhiskered and weary, and his sharp green eyes nothing like my love’s dreaming ones. Alfred Cox is a burly ginger, with dimples and a wry mouth. While they were both very polite in their welcome, at first we none of us knew what to say to one another. Sherrinford seems mostly business-minded, Cox quite political in his passions; and we were rather stuck, until the conversation turned to music.
“It was strange,” he said frankly. “I didn’t like half of them.”
“Within reason,” I said, realizing the potential dangers. “We need to be alert. In case of anything.” What I meant was in case of the box, which is in my pocket, finding its way into my hand, and the words I needed to say to him finding their way into my mouth. Which felt impossible. But I make a habit of doing impossible things, periodically. It keeps me on my toes. If I could just convince myself this was worthwhile-disrupting things.
I nodded. I could not have spoken; but John was caught up visibly in a powerful emotion, and hurried on. “He asked, then, ‘Have you ever embraced a friend?’”
“I wouldn’t presume—”
“I’ll answer it,” Sherlock said, and stood. “John.”
“Why? Aren’t you hurt? I’m told it’s bad form, rejecting one’s—paramour.”
He shook his head. “Mycroft took me at my word; told me nothing, except to inform me when he’d moved to Islington. I assumed Mycroft had been seeing him occasionally--but--”
“Is it the expense? Have you been at the tables again?”
“I - ” He’d given Sherlock a look that begged for forgiveness. “Queer, fairy, fag. Couple of queers, asking for a beating.
Ella had told them that over and over, that there wasn’t any right or wrong when it came to how they felt. Feelings just
I can’t imagine what I looked like then, faced with him sitting there quite calmly in the midst of the unspeakable. I might have said anything; but what I burst out with was, “And that pleases you?”
All at once a great boulder went crashing down the side of the cliff, barely missing me where I lay; and another, and another. I lay down upon the ledge, to make myself the smallest possible mark; and knew for a certainty that I had failed. This was not a hire. He was not waiting to see if his employer had died; he was trying to be sure that I was killed. He had a loyalty that extended beyond the Professor’s death to mine; there was at least one man of the Professor's whom I had missed entirely, very possibly more; and neither John nor I was safe at all so long as I was alive and they were free.
He laughed. It was a sorry-sounding thing. “Is it so obvious?”
I had just enough time to watch new depths of black self-loathing opening within me, when, “Oh,” he murmured. I heard the catch in his breath that meant he was moving carefully against his injuries; looked up, to find him just taking his seat again. He watched me in attentive silence; and the abyss retreated from me under his gaze.
* * *
After a moment, the fight left him. He drooped into my touch; raised an embarrassed hand to his brow, and sighed, and met my look again, visibly regretful. “Oh,” he said, “oh, well--we’ve not gotten on, and we never speak--the thought hadn’t occurred.”
Cocoa was actually considered a health drink then, and masturbating ("frigging") a serious health risk.
My dear John,
“God, no.” He looked horrified. “Never again.”
"All right."
“All right,” Ella had echoed him, and smiled, just a little.
Helpless, I watched it hit him. He jolted, and blanched; stood a moment, with parted lips; took two steps backwards, and lowered himself into his chair. I watched his gentle hands curl tightly round the arms of it, the little callouses on his fingers standing out white. Then he let go, deliberately, and stretched out his hands slowly, and placed them on his knees.
“Perhaps just a little.” I patted her leg in an attempt to encourage, or perhaps to apologize. “Isn’t it working out, then? Could I help?”
“Italy. Malindi. Morocco. Anywhere with mopeds.”
My heart,
“Till death do us part.” I could not speak steadily.
I went to visit her. As it happens, she is teaching now in the same set of tenements where I do my Saturday calls. She has taken up with a group dedicated to spreading literacy among the working poor. She divides her time between a makeshift classroom and a series of society functions, seeking patrons. She has even written pamphlets for distribution amongst the over-rich, to direct their troubled consciences toward her cause. I think she may do more good in the slums than I ever have been capable of; my practice can only patch up the damage done in abysmal conditions, while her work offers a way out of danger.
I tried to smile winningly, through the trembling of my heart. “I’m here for Doctor Watson.”
I am glad to be your
I had not anticipated his shock. I am no stranger to John Watson at a loss and grief-stricken, but I knew him better, then, than I had at the first, and strangely that made it harder to think what to do. I sorrowed to see his loneliness. I mourned over the blackness in his gaze. His silence unnerved me. At times I even became angry—with myself, Mary, Maxwell, Providence, everyone who had known but could not help him. But I could see him making an attempt at courage every time I came into the room. He’d offer me a weary smile and a kind question. I, both shamed and heartened by it, would search my own reserves for a little more patience, a little persistence, and pick up a semi-developed solution, or a book, or again take up my violin and play for hope.
“No,” he said, “it’s my brother.”
“Your intimacies?” Heat was rising up my neck, and I prayed Heaven he would not look up at me then. He did not.
William
“No, you’re right,” and then he took my face in his warm hands and kissed me again. I swayed a little; I was that far gone. Only he can make me forget myself in the middle of the street. Then he said, “I have slush in my shoe, and I'm cold. Can we take this inside?” And then, in a sudden whisper that told me he was still near tears, “Or just go home? I’d like to go home.”
I had to hide myself. I crawled my way across the damp earth to the face of the cliff, out of his line of sight; and then I clambered up a little way, with trembling legs and an ache in my fingers that did not bode well for me, till I found a ledge I could rest on, and wait, and think.
“You know I will. Of course I will. Watson—”
I had tucked away the Général’s letters in a carpetbag, with some francs, a set of false whiskers, and three forged passports, and was looking about me vaguely for something else to pack, when John came in with the scent of the rain about him. “There’s tea,” I said, and picked up a folio by Béchamp, considering it. I would have supposed myself quite calm by then, had I been asked; but he (bleary-eyed, and damp through the trouser-legs) stopped midway across the room to stare.
He said all this without looking at me; his gaze was fixed on his lap, his expression ambiguous. I thought I might venture a little more. “Were you still at home then?”
“Are you coming?” was all he said. It took me some few moments to recall--we had agreed to visit Mycroft. He needed his brother.
I sat up in my bed, and flung back the covers; went back out to into the darkened sitting room, the starlight coming faintly through the front window, and the scent of roses from the bowlful on the mantle. I needed something—anything to calm myself. I had no expectation of reaching him; what did I have that was remotely adequate to his loss? I began by looking for the syringe which was tucked up somewhere in my desk, but some vestige of sense stopped me, and I took up the Strad instead and began to play—softly, but after some time it drew him out of his room at last to stand barefoot on the bearskin rug before the fire, pale and quiet, watching me through swollen eyes.
I could return to the hotel, to John; and we could start home—unknowing who our enemy was; what he looked like; what resources he had at his command. It would all begin again, the ceaseless attacks, the certainty that the risk of death would follow us until I had found them all; but this time John would not let me out of his sight, and so he would be their target, too. It could take months to find our new enemy. I might not find him before he found his opportunity.
“Thank you,” I breathed, and she gave me an odd look.
I could easily have left them at peace in their ignorance, had I not been so recklessly happy with him. Barely twenty-four hours from our arrival we were seen kissing tucked away in the greenhouse. I can’t imagine how I’d expected to get away with it. I suppose I should be grateful that it was my mother’s lady’s-maid who spied us, for she went to Mother directly, and no gossip started in the lower halls. Father seemed almost indifferent to the act itself, if bemused. I suppose as a man of the world he’d seen stranger things. But he was protective of Mother, and she was humiliated, and frightened, and it made her wholly unforgiving. Victor was sent off at once. I was put on a train to London a few days after, with instructions to apply myself to my studies unwaveringly, and the threat of complete financial foundling if I was seen with him again by anyone.
And then there was a change. One frosty morning he sat across from me in his old chair, smoking a cigarette, while I talked to him about the Professor; Moriarty, of infamy then still to come. I had only just recognized the fact that his name came up peripherally in case after case, a stray thought, a secret behind secrets, and that his influence was all about me in the City without anyone’s realising how he’d intertwined himself about us. I was intrigued. Disturbed, too, with a faint unease far from the loathing I would later conceive for him; but deeply interested, God help me, in a man who seemed capable of camouflaging himself and his unrighteous capacities in plain sight of society, with dignity and ease. I was talking to John, as I do at times, as though to myself, swept away in the flow of speculation, when a turn and a glance at him brought me up short.
I pushed open the door.
As to the man you saw at the Falls, we think there are five likely possibilities, given your description of him. Your brother assures me his sources are surveilling them all thoroughly. Of course it is very important that our man, whoever he may be, does not notice he is being sought. But the necessary artfulness of caution is infuriating. Terrible as the work of a battlefield is, it is at least straightforward. One sees what must be done, and one does it. How did you ever find the patience for cases like this?
“His does, clearly.” His voice was high, soft, and strained, and strangely remote, as though he had gone somewhere inside himself, away from me. I hesitated at the threshold of his secrecy.
“I ate at home,” I objected, but feebly, and sat down too hard in the chair he’d gestured towards. My legs were beginning to tremble.
He held a revolver in his hand. His stance was military, his attitude intent. He could not have seen me, or he would have brought the rifle to bear upon my future at once; therefore he had heard Moriarty scream, and was now trying, through the spray of the fall, to see whether there was any survivor of our meeting, or whether I was gone. Was this only a stranger hired by the Professor for a guide or a precaution? Or was he a member of the organisation whom I had overlooked? I could not recognize him through the mist and the distance, but I supposed if I had known his face, he would be in irons, and not standing there.
“It’s too late,” was the bitter reply. She buried her head amid the pillows again, but a hand crept back, found my knee and stroked it. “I’ll never finish now.”
I shrugged, delighted. “I am happy again.”
“And the Doctor?”
William
William,
“Piss off.” My whole face had gone hot, but the grin was contagious.
So I overlooked the signs that perhaps he was not quite so settled as I. He seemed shy sometimes at my invitations, but I persisted; I’d spent years in London in my own solitary company, and I had a hundred things to show him. I brought him to the best booksellers, and the music halls, and the coffeehouses; the boxing rings where I beat off ennui and kept my fighting hand in; the dockyards where the spices came in from India and Siam—where the sailors in the taverns welcomed him, with his limp and his soldier’s posture, and asked where he’d been, and nodded their respect: offered in return wild stories of their adventures, to which he listened hungrily. He began to sleep better; he laughed at whatever nonsense I could find to entertain him, and smiled at my showing off, and seemed less weary. I wanted company, and he needed it; I thought we were in sympathy.
I must say here that John was not to blame: he did not know what he was doing. I had never expressed to him what was to me the inadmissible, the subrational tide rushing the shores of my self-command. I did not wish him to know. I wished to Heaven I did not know myself what I wanted. If only I might go on, as many a man did, with the day’s work and the night’s drink comforting and covering over my nature with layers of civilised distraction. I could act, at least, as though I did not want anything more than work and more work. Acting is sometimes almost the same as being in truth.
"On the contrary,” I answered, “I think it is evident that I do. Pray take a chair. I can spare you five minutes if you have anything to say.”
“I know little of women,” I said, finally, at which he smiled the slightest bit, “and nothing of marrying them, but I think you ought to explain to her. At the least, she won’t need to fear she’s lost your attentions by her own fault.”
Both his brows rose at that. He said, “Steady, there. All right?” and strode across the room to meet me, shoulders back, eyes alert, Captain Watson readying himself to do battle for my health and sanity. He took my hand in his, to test its temperature. His eyes dropped to my neck, looking for the racing or sunken pulse that would indicate the influence of what he called my poisons; then he looked to my pupils. His hand rose to brush gently across my cheek, my brow, in search of a sweat or a chill. I shivered.
John,
My William,
“My parents would be overjoyed to keep her.”
“Well, he shook his head at that, and said, ‘No wonder.’ He sounded almost sorry. ‘You’ve been all alone,’ he said. I began to protest, but he wasn’t finished. ‘You’ve had your work, of course. Still, one begins to feel the need of a companion. I’ve known a number of fellows like you, with no natural affinity for women. Some marry anyway. Some of them go on to live quite happily on their own; philosophical company, or public works, or artistic endeavours, take up the place in their soul which a family might have come to occupy; and that is no poor outcome, of course. But some turn to one another.’”
“She’ll go to her sister’s.”
He waited a moment and then nodded at my silence. I found myself looking at his stiff back, as he seated himself at his desk, with a finality indicating there was nothing further to be said. I thought I had better allow that to be true.
In the cab, I seized his restless hand between both my own, and brought it to my lips. He looked startled; then a little of the fear left his eyes, and he drew my hands to his own lips in turn, with a sigh.
“Oh.” I stared at the firm line of his shoulders, the bowed head, and tried to grasp this. “Oh, that’s--well. That’s significant.”
After a moment, his hand crept over mine.
“High time for that,” I found the breath to say, in the light of his happiness. If ever I knew what it was to be fortunate, I knew it then. If I meet with no other luck in the world than I have in John Watson, I will have had enough.
Whether I’d sink again, or live and breathe—I didn’t know yet.
“I don’t understand it at all myself, Holmes. I had thought it would all be quite natural, and yet—and yet—I ought to have noticed that I was not all right. I might have known.”
I spent three months in France, working on behalf of the governmental heads of that indulgent nation, as well as several Scandinavian neighbors. Their trust in me was flattering, but the great benefit was the money involved. I wired it to Mycroft in steady increments, to be used in purchasing the confidence of Moriarty’s associates, or engaging in false transactions with them, or in supplying the needs of the men who were working round the organisation, trying to find a weak spot. There was no man more fitted than Mycroft to manage it all.
At last the fall of stones stopped. I lay scarcely daring to breathe, till I heard his footsteps going away slowly, and then all was still.
I sat up straighter and scrubbed my hands over my face, through my hair. He looked worried. “Control the narrative?”
"Be careful tonight." And then, "All this time—I've had no idea where you were, how you were. It feels strange—to think of having you to myself again."
“Don’t be absurd.” He glared at me, through the slight haze of fragrant smoke that was forming round about him. “I always want you. But it isn’t safe.”
The dawn woke us—to Belgium and freedom. Two days till Moriarty was in court, and we had nothing to do but stay together, out of the way of harm. I suppose we knew each other as well as two Englishmen generally can, by that point; yet I found all at once had no idea how to behave. He loved me. He had said so. Now what was I to do with him?
Mycroft met us at the door to his office. He is generally impassive to my eyes, though kind; but now his face showed concern. “Come in,” he said. “Sherlock, John--I’ll have tea sent down at once.” Mycroft and I have been on intimate speaking terms since an extraordinary conversation which began, “I hope you realize that I have long considered you family, in the truest sense,” and concluded with him asking me to tell him if I needed anything at all.
His sleep was still broken then by pains and terrors, and he often came down still exhausted, well on in the morning. I never ate more than an egg, and so breakfast depended upon him: we generally took it at an hour more befitting a gentleman’s lunch.
I drew the weapon out, and laid it cocked upon the table beside my bed. He still smiled and blinked, but there was something about his deadened eyes which made me feel very glad that I had it there.
I had stopped wiring John about events by the third near miss. He would be already well up on his guard, with the endless patient suspicion of a soldier. Any further warnings would only alarm him painfully for my sake, and make it far harder for him to stay away from me. I knew that, because each instance had precisely that effect on me. To be able to see for myself that he was that minute quietly at work, whole, unharassed by murderers, was all I wanted. It was only my conviction that he was safer with me gone that held me steady at my task.
“As ever, a pleasure,” he said, and shook it. He is never demonstrative, but since I came to truly know him I have never doubted his affection. I returned the handshake warmly. Setting aside all other good things I have gained since I took rooms at Baker Street, I am exceedingly glad to have found a brother in Mycroft Holmes.
Sherrinford, as the eldest son, would have inherited the bulk of the family estate on their father's death (which is why some Holmesians have postulated his existence; neither Mycroft nor Sherlock seem to live like heirs). In my headcanon, he was already sober at their father's death, but that reinforced his resolve. He was emotionally steady enough by then to receive the influx of resources with grace.
“But surely--you don’t mean Sherrinford reads--?”
Through the long evening, I kept a kind of vigil. I ate, and wrote, and read, and sat dreaming, wondering how he was, what he was doing, if anyone had taken notice of him, or if he stood alone in a corner. But as the clock struck half nine I went into his room; knowing that whether the night went well or ill he would want me. I undressed in the shadows, amid the comfortable clutter of his chamber, the scent of his tobacco and the cedar chips in his costume-chest. I stirred up the fire; his hands and feet were always cold. I set his slippers beside it to warm, and hung his soft old night-cap on the bedpost; blew out the candle, and tucked myself beneath the coverlet, thinking I surely would not sleep.
The little silver circle inlaid with ebony slid on perfectly; settled onto his finger as though it belonged there. “Of course,” he said, staring at it, “of course you know my size, God, you didn’t ask Harry for my ring size, did you? She couldn’t have kept this a secret.”
“Please.”
“Lie down! No time for that.” I needed to get out of 221–I needed to go—I needed—
“You won’t help me by catching cold. Go change your clothes.” I waited until he turned away. Then I sank into my chair. My fingers had begun to tremor. I sat, trying vainly to form a sentence in my mind which would ease him into it.
When I had followed him into our rooms, and closed the door behind us, he rounded on me; studied me soberly. Coming near, he lifted my hat from my head, proprietary, and slid my coat from my shoulders; lay them over a chair. He caught up my hand; ran his thumb lightly along mine, and smiled a little when I shivered.
“Yours, sir.” Billy looked as though he were loath to leave us without knowing the import of the letter, but Holmes took it behind the map and did not emerge.
“You’ve done nothing,” I said in surprise. He shook his head.
“I don’t!”
“You have to go,” I said.
“Of course I told him to go on. ‘I’ve seen a good deal of life,’ I said. ‘I am not easily shocked.’ He said, ‘You’ve told me you haven’t enjoyed close contact with your wife, but you are very fond of her. Were there any friends at school, or in your regiment, who were as significant to you? As Damon to Pythias, or Achilles to Patroclus?’”
“You look like you’re about to die of nerves,” she said, dropping her voice to a half-whisper, “and you’re fidgeting about in your coat pocket. Besides, you’ve been besotted forever and so has he. Isn’t it obvious?”
“Naturally, you wouldn’t find a simple game like mine interesting,” he said at last. “But I know you like to chance your luck, sometimes. You’ll hazard your whole case on a guess if the answer matters enough.”
I signed the letter, “William Scott.” I did not write that I loved him. I felt I did not deserve to.
“He says Sherrinford has been reformed for some time,” he said, without turning. “Since before he met Cox. Mycroft thinks the change may be permanent, as Cox has pledged the wagon too.”
After two months he began to rally. Mary had gone to stay with her mother. Returning, she asked him to tea. I watched him off, feeling a good deal of trepidation on his behalf. But he returned brighter-faced, carrying some of the books he’d left at their home, and said to me warmly, “She is a brave woman.”
This is Holmes and Watson's story, but it's also Sherrinford's. The struggle to find your balance after a world-shattering event, like losing home, a parent and a first love at one blow, is a long and hard one; and thinking well of yourself, and choosing your own safety and happiness, is an act of great bravery. It can take time to find the courage. To anyone who relates to Sherrinford's side of the story: I honor you. If you've already found your own life or if you're still reeling, I believe in you.
He nodded once; his breath shortened, and a flush stained his cheeks, setting my heart to racing; he sat up straighter in his chair. “All right, then. I’ll hope for you to hear me out, anyway.”
“I didn’t know,” I admitted, because I hadn’t. It would make John happy, that I’d listened, and learned something. The knowledge could be useful on a case–the psychological impact of rom-coms. But now I couldn’t manage to be social any longer, not with John sitting there laughing, and the box in my pocket.
We're given very little idea of what Holmes was doing in France, and I leave it as vague as canon does, but added a few attempts on his life to account partially for the exhaustion Doyle describes in him (I can't imagine Moriarty left him alone the whole time there)--the rest of his weariness being due to his absence from John, of course, and the attendant impulse to work himself into the ground. I wish I had the plot room to write about what Holmes would do with the money from the case--I imagine a lot of indulging John in nights out, and books, and better food, and a lot of music, to begin with; and then laying plans for Sussex, eventually.
I'd meant to write a quiet divorce for John and Mary, but if I've understood my reading right, there was no such thing available. Divorce would require money, a lot of it, and public humiliation; being cut out from one's social groups for the shame of it; appearances in court; proving before a doctor that the husband could not respond sexually to his wife, and the marriage was unconsummated! I couldn't imagine John and Mary having the resources nor the brazenness for all that, so I wrote them a practical separation, which was much more common: separate houses, separate amours, and financial support for the wife, who would be unable to work or claim property.
“All of it. Always. Yes.”
“Then where shall we go?” I had some questions I wanted to ask him rather badly.
“We’ve been watching him,” he said, gently, “though I’m not certain it was necessary. He’s capable enough, as you well know.”
“I don’t want him to.” His voice had been steady, but only just.
“I’ll brace myself.”
How could I have expected such peace to last? To think I had won, in a world like ours? I ought to have been more up on my guard. Now I was already unused to being alone; but worse was the thought that I was leaving him alone again, too, without any warning. Surely he would guess some part of what had happened, at least. He was used to my periodic disappearances. He would wait alone by the fire tonight for a word from me, trusting me to let him know what to do next.
If I could remain out of sight.
“I’m Doctor Liddell,” she said, and I nodded; I was all at once past speech. To be so near—
“I should hope so,” she said, “the Doctor’s been missing you that badly. I can’t imagine why the French had to keep you so very long.”
I turned back in surprise. He appeared a little regretful, but without a shade of yielding. I spoke without thinking.
“Normal! Kiss hello, kiss goodbye, hold hands in the Park. Make eyes at him in restaurants. Normal, a couple. But when I try - ” He’d stopped, and Sherlock had noted the sudden tremble of his hand.
During the long nights walking, I had come to a decision: I would go to Montpelier. The lady of the house I’d stayed in had liked me well enough; the persona I had adopted there was studious and calm, designed to appeal to her quiet nature, and it was a personality I could maintain for some time with a little self-control. I only had to forbear from shouting out my discoveries, or shooting the walls, however my feelings moved me. The laboratories and libraries would provide me with work enough to occupy my mind until we knew something more.
“All right,” I said. I cannot express the effect he has on my heart. “Come here?”
He started toward me first. We reached each other, and he was pulling me into himself and burying his face in my hair. My head found his shoulder: I hid my relief in it, and breathed in the safety there, slowly. When at last we broke apart he was smiling such a smile as I had not seen in a very long time. But as he stepped back, and took my shoulders in his hands, and looked me over, a sudden visible worry swept him. Well, Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson had looked at me much the same. I tried a smile. “Yes, I’ve worked too hard, and used myself up a bit too much, but—John, it’s almost done.” Then, as I came further to my senses, “Might we close up the window?”
“Yes. Forgive me. I know you don’t like to hear about it.”
“Dearly beloved,” I read, “we are gathered here in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation”--Here Sherlock raised his brows, and I gestured between the two of us; if I could serve as our priest, we could be our own congregation, surely. He nodded, conceding the point, so I went on--“gathered to join together these men in holy matrimony. If either of you know any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together, do now confess it.” It ought to have been funny, given the multiplicity of reasons we might not, lawfully. I expected a sparkle of derision from him at the line, but his gaze remained wholly solemn and true.
“If you use that tone on my given name, I will have to leave,” he said, “or else kiss you now. I am mortal, Holmes. There is only so much I can bear.” The absurd, shining good-humour on his face was my undoing.
“He’ll catch cold,” I said, defensive.
“You realize the media’s going to find out.” He’d been playing something pensive for half an hour, and I’d been drowsing in my chair. I jumped awake.
You are always with me, too.
His umbrella stood against the wall at the top of the stairs. There was a light shining under the door, on the landing. All was quiet within. I thought of knocking, but the impulse to surprise won out, and I pushed it open softly.
offended.”
I might have guessed; anything involving family turned him quiet and strange a while. I’d no idea what had become of his parents, or where his family home lay, or how he and Mycroft Holmes could have lived fifteen miles apart for fifteen years, in the same city, and still barely speak, in spite of a deep and abiding affection.
“It seems a pity,” he said, almost lightly, “to be sent off for something I’d only wished I’d done. Shall I make it all worse?”
“Has he—” I found I had to stop and clear my throat. “Has he been here, then?”
“Good, John. More.”
“Yes.”
When I looked up, great tears stood in his eyes. I was caught in his gaze, bright in the firelight, till the tears overflowed and spilled down his face. I said, hoarse, “Sherlock.” He wiped quickly at his eyes; took the watch from me, and touched the coin with one finger; put it away in his waistcoat pocket, reverent. Then he reached into his other pocket, and brought out a ring.
“Do you think he knows?”
“There was no love between them,” he said. “I know, because the stranger with my brother looked me over, head to foot. That look--I didn’t have the language, then, to name what he wanted to do, but I could see it. He would not have asked; he would have taken what he liked. And my brother would not have noticed.”
He studied me. His mouth softened in sympathy. “Yes, of course. You’ve been having a hard time of it, haven’t you.”
“Then let us exchange the tokens of our good faith,” I said, when I had got my voice back, and I produced out of my pocket the little gold sovereign I’d had made into a fob. “Give me your watch?”
“Yesterday. I spoke to you abominably.”
“Yes. A long time ago. It ended very poorly and my mother never forgave me. Please don’t ask me about it.”
My brave, my beautiful John looked at me without the slightest shame, or any hint of darkness beyond a little wry twist to his mouth, which said he knew exactly what he was about, and would do it anyway. I looked back. I could dare no less, not in the face of that uncowable joy. I said, again, slower, "John," and then I summoned up all my courage and held out my hands. He came to me.
“If this was my last coin, it would be yours,” I said, holding out the sovereign for him to see. “All I have, and all I am is yours, and none other’s, from now until the day you die.” I hooked the little coin to his watch chain, with a feeling of triumph: I had said it; exposed my heart entirely, without a falter.
“I put him in danger. I - because I care for him, because I - love him.” Saying it aloud still felt strange. “They go after him. To get to me. He’s not safe with me.”
I faltered to a stop, with a thundering heart. Too much truth. His mouth moved slightly, soundlessly.
“Suppose we stop trying to bear it,” he murmured. His eyes were welling with tears. He swept a shy thumb over them, and gave me such a wry, glorious look I felt myself blush. “Suppose we just be mortal for a moment. Let me at least hold you. Please,” opening his arms to me, and I lost all vestige of sense. I went to him. I laid my head on the broad, thick shoulder of his dressing-gown; turned my face into his tender neck, where his pulse raced, and placed my lips to it, slowly. He shuddered; said my name, hoarse and deep and tender. Past speech, I drew him closer; put my arms about him, felt the heat and the strength of him beneath me. Took him in, like a drowning man taking air.
He’d turned to Sherlock, embarrassed and determined and shining with certainty, and Sherlock had almost flinched back from him.
“Mycroft would know.”
When dawn broke over the rooftops he was dozing in my chair, wrapped up in my shawl. I laid myself down on the sofa, thinking to watch over him till he woke, but the ticking of the clock amid the quiet in the room pulled me under with him into blessed unconsciousness.
He did not answer. His face was turned to the window, his features falling into shadow and rising again into light as we passed beneath the streetlamps, through the silent streets, hushed beneath the cold. I could not catch his expression. His soft-gloved hand rested on his knee, inches from my own. I could have placed my hand atop his, stroked it, pressed my knee to his in comfort. I did not move at all. Something was just then occurring to me. “You found you didn’t care for kissing her, and that surprised you. Hadn’t you ever before…?” I faltered. I didn’t know how to find my way through the thought without embarrassment, but he compressed his lips and looked at me, finally.
“I trust you will,” he said, finally, a little faintly.
“You said that your parents are dead. When, and how? If it is not presumptuous to ask.”
“Yes. Oh, God.” He grabbed my shoulders. He was going to kiss me. He doesn’t do that in public, not in the middle of London, but then he was: I barely had time to see it coming before he was kissing me, urgently, and then he was in my arms, small and solid and beautiful, sniffling into my neck, while I savored the feeling of his hot, wet breath in my skin; and then he pulled back wet-eyed and said, “Put it on me, will you?”
He was giving not an inch. Could I confess now that I troubled myself with everything about him? Would he permit me that? “I don’t like what I don’t understand. You’re a reasonable man. Don’t you have enough now?”
“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir!”
"Oh, no. Not tonight."
Throughout, I was nearly murdered a half-dozen times in an unamusingly creative variety of ways. I went to Narbonne, to Nimes, to Lyon, to Montpelier; they followed me. An ordinary interview was abruptly interrupted by a bullet fired through the window nearest my head, passing so close as to leave a burning sensation across my endangered ear; the gendarmes in my company rushed outside, but found no one to chase; no one in the street seemed to know where the shot had come from. Later, a letter was sent to my address, containing a powder which, analysed, proved a chemical agent which could have paralysed me in an hour had I inhaled two grains of it. Another night I returned home late to find scratches on the window—someone had been trying to cut through the bars with a saw. Still another day, in the thick of a sudden spring rain, I was set upon by thugs on the banks of the Saône. There were three of them. I had a revolver in my boot, which I could not get at until nearly the end of the scuffle; a knife of good steel, and my fists. I fought them off without a word said between us. They fought like trained men and not vagrants. I will never know who they were.
Now, he was looking -not for the first time- at Sherlock’s chin, unable to meet his eyes. “I asked you to stop being dead,” he spoke softly. He was vaguely surprised at the amount of effort it took to keep the tremble out of his voice. He shifted the grip on the cane, the one he hadn’t had to carry not long after meeting Sherlock and he supposes that’s where Sherlock’s gaze was now. Analyzing John’s dependence on the once obsolete object.
They’re already too close, so when Sherlock shifts and lifts his head they’re staring right at each other, closer than before. They’re looking at each other, saying nothing. John can feel Sherlocks warm breath ghosting against his face. Maybe a couple of inches apart and John couldn’t say why he did it.
