Sam could not believe the apparent scene playing out on his brother’s memory foam bed. Squishing his eyelids closed and then opening them again. Sam watched as his brother...his older brother, Dean Winchester. The man who never met a strip club he didn’t like, appeared to have his head in Castiel’s lap . And, was...was his head bobbing?
"Of course, you and Sam have always been able to tell when I am not being truthful. Hazards of being an angel of the lord and not being familiar with the subtleties of lying. Even after the fall. When I was living without my Grace, I never got a real handle on it."
. and it was with an unsteady voice he continued "...in me educating you about my favorite bands and - you know. Whatever else you want to talk about. Like maybe us" Dean looked up shyly this time. His flirtatious bravado gone.
Castiel shifted his position slightly forward so that he could place his open palm over the center of Dean's chest to emphasize the rest of his story
Barachiel studied the human sitting next to him and could sense the anger and frustration. He already knew the man's reputation for protecting those he considered family and the extreme measures he would take for those he loved. Barachiel gave a small smile as his understanding of the situation between Dean Winchester and Castiel began to be understood by the Archangel. So, rather than let the man believe he could somehow change upcoming events. He decided to head off the man's unnecessary efforts.
Castiel gave a small chuckle and said "Deal." Then with his lips becoming set in a grim line, he whispered "Dean, it is time I must release you but before I do promise me something."
Castiel before he could rethink his actions, tilted his head back and allowed his Grace to begin its exit in a fiery golden light and has it did so his body's momentum already carrying it forward fell into Dean Winchesters arms and as Dean Winchester hugged the now emptying vessel tightly against his own body he felt the warmth of Castiel, an Angel of the Lord envelope him and begin to possess his body.
"Sam, I just met another di..." Dean was about to use the term for a male appendage when he realized it may not be the best way to go "...I just met Cas' friend: Barachiel."
Scoffing with some humor the Archangel ignored the anger behind the man's questioning and chose to counter with chagrin "How did you know?"
As Cas turned to look back into the other room where his brother sat, Dean took advantage and made a quick examination of Cas. He suddenly felt his hunter instincts kick in when Castiel met his eyes then quickly break away and nervously flick to the other room. Castiel had never really been successful at deception. Despite his protests to the contrary, and Dean began to sense that Cas was acting like he was unnerved, anxious or was it fear? Dean knew that even though he was getting better at it, Castiel was still awkward at the subtleties when it came to human interactions and emotions and showing them himself. Sometimes he wondered if Cas missed being able to move about as "Celestial Intent" not being confined in such a small vessel. Cas had never really spoke about it before and if Dean or Sam tried to bring it up, Cas would usually find a way to move away from the topic. It was definitely odd that he mentioned it right now.
"Well, I don't know too much about their nighttime proclivities" Cas replied distractedly. "But I do know they are seen by some as magical creatures because they can confuse and hypnotize their victim and take control of their minds. Usually, they go after men but women are not immune to their powers"
Castiel listened to Barachiel's explanation and asked "But you were there. How did she still get out?"
Slowly rolling to a stop at the edge of the cemetery the three men sat inside the car in silence and merely stared ahead into the darkness that lay beyond. Each lost in their own thoughts.
Dean watched his brother exit and with some edgy excitement in his voice, he turned to face Cas and said "Looks like we are going on a road trip. Why don't you grab that mix-tape I made you and we can listen to that on our way down." as he spoke, it came to his attention that unnoticed by Cas, the collar of his shirt had become turned up and Dean quickly figured it would be a clever way to try and bring back a little of the intimacy that they were experiencing before. So, he reached up and began to adjust the collar.
Castiel stared at the ruler of demons and realized he did not know how to answer...or if he wanted to admit to himself why he was standing where he was. Besides, what did he mean by "future home". His suspicion growing. He waited for the demon to continue.
Dean remained silent for several minutes after Barachiel finished and finally after the realization set in he looked over and replied with a heavy voice "You forgot the option for him to stay here, on Earth and live with us."
Smiling Barachiel said "Oh yeah. Rafael used to come with me and we would have so much fun." growing solemn at the thought of what was a good memory but one that would not be repeated any time soon and he said as much to Castiel. "Now, I doubt we will be doing anything like that again for the next millennia or so"
Surprised by his question Barachiel answered unable to conceal that surprise in his voice "We are high up in the Grand Tetons in a remote meadow. It is where I first came to find Castiel, I thought it would be a good place for you and I to finish our conversation... uninterrupted."
Every so often he would turn his attention back to his vessel to make sure no animal had become inquisitive enough to approach and bother the empty shell. Once a bear had wondered over to try and get a closer look. Castiel had gently given the idea to the bear that it would be unsafe for it to get close enough to examine the human and the bear changed direction away from the vulnerable vessel.
“Sorry guys.  I tried to wait on this but we got a case down in the Gulf Coast of Texas, it is on an oil rig and I can’t wait for you two to figure your shit out any more.”
"You were reading the scroll? I thought you said reading the old parchments gave you a rash because of the mold."
Dean ducked his head just a little, a tinge of pink brushing his cheeks at the hint that maybe he had mentioned something about the group many times before to the angel.
"Great." and with that, Dean gave Cas' collar a final tug and quickly moved his arms around Castiel's shoulders and gave him a hug and just as Cas was finished getting his own arms in place around Dean, Sam's voice once again ruined the moment as it rolled through the corridor's demanding they hurry up so they could get on the road.
"Dean, we will find a way. Just like we have for each other. We will do whatever it takes to keep him from being punished. We can't let them lock him up down in Hell with Lucifer."
Barachiel heard the sadness return to Castiel and tried to reply "Brother..." before he could continue though, Castiel interrupted as if he really didn't want to hear the other angel's answer. The concern in his eyes as he asked the question Barachiel dreaded to answer "Barachiel, why have you come?"
The odd man nodded and reached into the interior pocket of the coat. Dean tensed ready to defend himself but he quickly relaxed when the guy pulled out a book. Holding it out for Dean to take the man spoke
Sam considered his brother and reflected on everything that he knew Dean had to endure his entire life. The family story of their Mother's death and how John, their father, had thrust a six month old Sam into Dean's young arms and told him to run and take care of his brother. From that moment Dean had never stopped protecting his younger brother and Sam knew he was fearless about doing so. Nothing seemed to scare his older brother and to Sam, he always seemed indestructible. Now though for the first time that he can recall. He is witnessing his brother expose a vulnerability he had never seen before and that was his feelings for Castiel.
Lowering his fingers a second time Crowley waited expectantly with a slight look of irritation crossing his face. “Look, I did a favor and I hate long goodbyes. So don't get all mushy on me””
“A case? Where?” Trying to ignore the sounds and movement Cas made behind him as the angel left the bed they had just been sharing.
Dean could only stare at Castiel, his mind racing trying to figure out how to fix this problem. Like he did for all of the problems they had faced together.
Dean smiled. He remembered the time Castiel had yanked him from Zachariah's clutches to the side of that deserted road and Cas smiled too as he continued “Though, to be honest Dean. I am not sure if I listened or not" and with that Castiel leaned forward and kissed Dean deeply for a final time. Then Dean felt Castiel as he vacated his body and suddenly he was alone.
Sam nodded his agreement and added "Cas, does it say anything about the type of spirits or what they might be summoned for?"
Dean replied softly as he looked up at his brother "but he would be alive, not in pain and living free".
"Because I am the King of Hell and I know a lot of things." beginning to walk around the angel to stand directly in front of him. He saw doubt in the taller man's face "You see, Castiel. When a platoon of your brothers show up with their angel daggers drawn...sent by Daddy himself with orders that I release Lucifer to them so he can go up and get a spanking from Papa. Well, it tends to make one curious. Then when you get an order from God for two cages to be built. Well, you get even more curious and when God him self brings you specs for a special cage to be built and wards it himself. Well, I would say my curiosity overwhelmed me to the point where I had to find out what was going on up in angle headquarters. So I snooped around with some of my contacts. Gathered intel and lo and behold, I find out Daddy is punishing his children for all of their misbehaving while he was away and..."
"I um..." Castiel paused searching for the correct answer. He was unsure of how to answer. He had been many places but he suspected Dean was merely being polite and really did not want to hear every detail. He was beginning to understand the definition of polite interest and suspected this was probably one of those times "I was meditating and paid a visit to one of your National Parks to do so." Castiel still shaken by the news he was just given by the Archangel nervously added "The park's wildflowers are beginning to bloom and that means..."
Sam looked up as Dean took a seat at the table and shook his head when he saw Dean had eaten almost half of the pie. Looking over at Castiel he gave a big smile and said "Hey, Cas! Glad to see you."
Dean thought about the Castiel and found himself getting a little defensive on his behalf "What could he possibly have done to make them do that?"
Pulling the blade back up into his arm, Castiel slowly approached the man and as he did he opened his arms to embrace his much missed friend. Then, quite unexpectedly, when Castiel felt himself become wrapped in his brother's embrace in reciprocal fashion, the years of pain and longing for what had been lost in heaven rose up and flooded his mind and body. Causing his body to collapse into that of Barachiel's and when Barachiel gripped him tight and held him close, Castiel remembered who and what he was and allowed himself to do something he hadn't allowed himself to do before now. He wept.
"Oh, you know Pops. After he doled out punishments to all of the participants and co-conspirators. He didn't say a word to anyone. He went to visit with Joshua for a while and when he came out and sent me to find you and ignored our Brother's protestations. He said in his best imitation of their Father's voice "Bring me the last angel, Castiel. It is his time to answer to God, your Father. Bring him to stand before me and face the accusations levied against him." Castiel had dropped his head in shame as Barachiel finished.
Barachiel let the sarcasm fill his words "Michael convinced me that he was concerned about the Darkeness....Amara" Barachiel said the name as if still getting used to its sound "About Amarataking advantage of Father's absence and that Castiel, is all it took to fool me."
“Sam. Don't.” with a sadness coming from his voice that nearly broke his own heart Sam waited. “Cas will be back and I am going to say goodbye to my best friend. Just like I have every other time. And I am not going to say a word about how I feel to the first person that has ever made me happy. Has always had my back and...dammit Sam.” Dean paused and with forced humor added “He even made me laugh a few of times” with a small drunken snort coming from his brother.
Dean watched as Castiel and Sam said their goodbyes to each other. He couldn't make out what they were saying as he had moved to stand closer to the Impala. He wanted more distance from the others so that when he said goodbye to Cas it would be private. As the two men parted with a last squeeze of each others shoulders and Sam nodding his head in agreement to some request of Castiel's. Dean felt a tightness in his chest begin to build. He dreaded Cas turning around because it would make his steps coming towards him resemble a countdown. A countdown to the final moments with him.
Looking back at his brother with a straight face Dean replied "Well, this one had a little less mold on it. Can we stay on track here?"
"I said we will Cas'. No need to keep talking about it" Dean regretted his words immediately. "I am sorry Cas. I..."
Dean chewed his mouthful of pie slowly as he watched the interaction between his brother and his best friend and as he swallowed he realized, there was something definitely going on with the angel because watching Cas place his hand on Sam's shoulder...with a smile no less. Suddenly, Dean felt as if Cas' hello to Sam, wasn't really a hello at all.
Softly, Castiel's deep voice pierced the darkness of the Impala's interior. Squeezing Dean's hand as he began "Dean...Sam. I have a favor to ask of you.'
"It means that he has returned and has begun putting things back to order. It means that he has begun handing out judgments on all of the angels who participated in the plot to take Heaven and Earth back for the angels to have and control. The Apocalypse. All of it, Dean and now...He"
Dean's mind began to race and in a moment of panic. The story of how Cas had rescued him from Perdition went through his mind. Him wrapped in Castiel's celestial being, carried out as cradled in his energy.
"In a million years and I mean that literally Castiel. I would not have thought that Michael would have agreed to fight Lucifer again in their efforts to reclaim from mankind what Father had given them. But Michael knew, with me here and my job... my purpose as the Archangel of Devine Law, Commander of the Guardian Angels. He knew I would not allow for it. So he and the others put into motion their plan to be rid of me. They came up with the only workable plan. Send me out on a fools errand to the only possible threat big enough to pull me and the largest contingent of guardian angels away from earth and heaven."
“Well, sometimes I get a sixth sense about things. Mostly it's just a sense when a demon is close by or old evil I call it. I think it is something that got left over...left in me from when you possessed me. It was brief but...I don't know. It's what I like to think”
"Cas, I..." before Dean could continue Sam came walking into the room with a large book open in his hand. Excited about his discovery he seemingly forgot the reason he left the room in the first place. Dean looked over slightly irritated with his brother's interruption "Hey guys! I think I found what Rowena may need the spells fo..." looking up from his book Sam noticed the somber mood of the room and stopped to look at his brother. "What's going on? You both look like someone died"
Listening to the sounds coming from the kitchen Sam could tell his brother was moving around looking for the hidden pie and he heard him add a little more indistinctly "I still think it sounds like an Irish chick folk band" Smiling to himself, Dean could only shake his head and muttered "Rowena and the Celtic Coven. Come see them at the Kansas State Fair. " chuckling at his own jest, Dean crossed over to where the toaster oven sat and the cupboards located above. He reached up to open the cupboard and checked inside. Disappointment fell across his face when he found the space lacking in pie. Then has he began to turn away to search another set of cupboards. The red and white label of a cherry pie caught his eye through the darkened glass of the toaster oven. Giving a small smirk at Sam's weak attempt at trying to keep him from finding the tasty pastry. Dean, flung the door to the little oven open and grabbed the prize inside.
Cas nodded his understanding of Dean’s instructions and then did as he told by closing his eyes. Although, he couldn’t help taking one last peek through a partially opened eye at Dean. A small smile quirked his lips as he noticed Dean had closed his eyes as well, while still curled up on his side next to him. And as Page’s opening guitar solo started to float through his earbuds. Cas clamped his eye shut like the other and leaned ever so slightly against the leg to his left and listened.
Breaking his gaze way, Cas squeezed his arm one last time and then released him. Slowly, he turned towards Dean who had moved back closer to his car. His hands were jammed into his leather jacket pockets and his shoulders were hunched. He wouldn't look up as Castiel approached.
Walking back down the magazine aisle, beer and basket now in hand, Dean stopped at the point that he had seen the new magazine with the male model that had a passing resemblance to Castiel's former vessel and set the basket down as he reached up and grabbed the mag from behind the plastic shield. He then bent to pick up the basket and tossing the magazine in as he did so, Dean began to notice a difference in the freshness in the air nearest him. Then he noticed the dirty mud caked shoes standing just inches from the edge of the grocery basket that he was about to pick up. Looking up from his basket  and into the half crazed eyes of the man in need of a shower. Dean just stared at him nonplussed because he recognized the man's problem right away.
Picking up the sarcastic tone coming from his friend, Castiel changed his demeanor and glanced abashedly at him. The memory of Dean's overreaction to his showing up naked and covered in bees on the hood of the Impala still an unpleasant one. "Yes. And. Well, that it is where I can leave my vessel for awhile and allow myself to be...well." Cas paused as if searching for the right word and looked back at Dean and whispered "Me."
"Oh. That." Crowley chewed the inside of his cheek as he thought over his answer and after coming to a decision he answered in his typical fashion. "Well, you see. It is rather embarrassing really."
“Dean...” Sam ventured “When Cas comes back you are going to tell him how you feel. He needs to know it. Because something tells me he feels the same about you. You both need to be honest and that way no matter what happens...”
Wanting to get more of a bead on Cas he decided to ask for his help "So Cas" he said more deliberately "I was wondering if maybe you understood those scratches on the scroll"
Castiel stared back at his friend and could only nod his head as the full implications of his words hit him. He understood that he was not without guilt in everything that had happened both here on earth and in heaven and even though he knew his intentions were well intended. The outcomes had been disastrous. Outwardly, Castiel tried to remain calm and not give away the sudden panic he felt. His mind started racing through a hundred different scenarios with outcomes that ended badly for him. After a moment of silence Castiel asked with more calm in his voice than he really felt.
Dean blinked his red rimmed eyes and sank the rest of the way to the ground nodding his head and croaked out "Okay."
“Yes. There is a lot of imagery in the lyrics that I wholly enjoyed.” Shifting slightly Castiel continued “it makes me think a little about heaven and of my time here on earth with you…” Dean looked up and met Cas’ eyes at this statement. Cas for his part, was afraid he might have implied too much and tried to deflect some of the statement by adding “..and Sam and other times before I met you both.” the last part sounded forced. Cas flinched a little at the awkwardness of it.
From behind he could hear Sam and Dean repeat the same maneuver with their doors as they exited the vehicle to follow and as the two brothers trotted to catch up to Castiel.  They each took up a position on either side and closed the gap to the where the pit was located. Together as a team for a final time.
Returning his thoughts to the issue at hand, Castiel had to finally face up to and admit to himself his own feelings for Dean Winchester. He always knew that he had cared for him very deeply. Often hiding the truth behind less descriptive words for the truth like “bond” or “connection”. Neither word came close to capturing what he really felt and Metatron was right. He was in love. Castiel could not pinpoint the moment he had fallen in love with the older Winchester. Maybe it was the moment he had gripped him by the shoulders and raised him up from Perdition. Only, because of all that they had been through together as a team fighting evil. Telling a macho Dean Winchester how he felt was never a consideration. So, the Servant of the Lord did what he did best, He just focused on the latest mission and just never allowed himself to dwell on his feelings. But now...things were different. He was leaving to face his Father for the sins he committed in the erroneous belief that the means justified the sometimes disastrous ends. Decisions which ironically, were made in an effort to continue his Father's orders.
"So, it was with great horror that I watched him look up at our Father and do something none of the thousands that had done before him. And what caused my brother Archangels to call for him to be re-purposed or even destroyed."
A soft rain was falling and the two men stared across the damp parking lot where just a couple of cars huddled close together near the only source of light, a lamp post jammed into the ground at the lots center. The building itself was a low-roofed stucco structure located on the far side of the parking area, it's entry was lit by a neon sign flickering over the oaken door letting anyone who was interested know that the place was open and ready for business. Looking over at Barachiel, Castiel could see the impish smile cross the old man's face as he thought about what was waiting for him inside. Meeting his gaze, Barachiel gave a little wink as he took the first step and led the way across the wet pavement towards the light.
"Because everything I love! Eventually gets ripped away from me." and with that Dean had rolled off the hood of the Impala and tossed the last empty beer bottle back into the cooler and then climbed into the Impala and started the engine with a roar. Signaling an end to their discussion. They never spoke of it again.
It took some convincing but Dean believes in the case and maybe his feelings for Castiel. Sam of course is way ahead of both of them.
Castiel squinted his eyes slightly when Crowley asked about the landscaping. All he saw for landscaping was dead grass, overgrown bushes and broken concrete.
Dean felt the calmness settle over him. His mind was now focused on the sound of the bees as they moved from flower to flower. He suspected this change was coming from Barachiel and he no longer cared. He just wanted to find some peace and kneeling here in the tall lupine of the meadow with Barachiel's help. He was getting it. Looking back up into Barachiel's lined face. He began to listen as the Archangel continued "I want you to understand, Dean that I love him too. He was my best friend long before he became my most trusted confidant and Captain. I am going to tell you something about Castiel, Dean. A story about his creation and hopefully you will understand why I...why heaven needs him back, more than you need him here with you.
"I am warded and demons can't sense angels." turning to face the man standing beside him, Castiel continued "So, how did you know I was out here?"
Barachiel shook his head "No, I didn't.' Looking over at Dean he continued "I didn't have any idea about what was to come."
“Dean” Castiel began to softly stroke the bare shoulder under his hand “I want you to know. The thought did cross my mind of you and I running somewhere. But eventually, I would have been found and any punishment that may happen now. Would most certainly happen then. Tenfold” and with a small squeeze of a muscled shoulder  he added softly. “I will be able to withstand anything they decide Dean but I wouldn't be able to, if I thought for one minute you were suffering because of me. So when it is time. You will let me go.”
Dean a little shocked could only call out a thanks at the man's backside as he lumbered back the way he had come and out the glass front door of the Gas n Sip. Dean watched him begin to cross the parking lot and as he did so he slipped the book without looking at the cover into his back pocket and grabbed his basket and hurried to make his purchase.
Castiel tilted his head satisfied by Dean's reaction and smiled. "Yes, Dean. Of course I want to learn more about the music and I look forward to talking about...us. That would mean a lot to me."
"Oh, yes. Lucifer is lobbying for you to be found guilty for your crimes in-absentia. He feels your slaughtering Angels, pretending you were God and purging Earth of sinners and for the love of Dad, Castiel. You helped Lucifer escape and even set in motion his kid being born. Hell, Castiel. Everyone in heaven feels this is enough to warrant you being found guilty and cast down into Hell. Just like our dearest brother: Lucifer. "
, the next song on his mixed-tape, had begun to play. Dean had focused all of his attention on the scruffy-bearded man sitting pretzel-legged in front of him. Dean told himself it was because he wanted to see if Cas would have the same reaction to the music as he had had when he listened to Zeppelin. But then, something changed inside of himself as he studied the angel’s visage and caught sight of the whisper soft smile that played about his lips. Dean found himself no longer caring about Cas’ reaction to any song. Instead, he just wanted to stare. As Cas nodded his head lightly in time to the music. Dean could not help but notice the soft yellow light from the table lamp located just off his shoulder bathed Cas in a golden halo of light, softening some of the small lines around his eyes and that ghost of a smile played about the angel’s slightly parted lips. Caused Dean to swallow thickly as he found himself becoming fully enthralled by the angel’s presence and close proximity to himself.
Castiel turned in his seat to squint back at the man, not quite sure what he meant by his words but in the end he nodded. Satisfied that Sam would indeed take care of the car.
Barachiel, he felt them himself towards the angel and then he thought to himself 'How could you not?' With pity and understanding. Barachiel for the second time since meeting Dean Winchester, closed his eyes and sent another wave of peaceful calmness towards the man now kneeling among the wildflowers his head bowed and tears falling silently.
The man squinted at him trying to understand and with a shake of his head, he could only say "Wha?.wha..did you say?"
Sam was the first to recover and rose up. Giving Dean another squeeze to his shoulder as he did so. "Are you okay?'
Castiel felt himself go numb inside at his commander's question. He knew of course that much of what happened, happened because he was trying to fix problems created by other angels. But he also knew that many of his decisions just created bigger problems. Castiel also understood that their Father didn't often look at the reason why a thing was done. Just that it was done while breaking his commandments.
Cas looked up at Dean who was sitting back on his heels,wedged between Castiel's legs and it was quite evident even to him that this would not work out. So with a Cheshire like grin Castiel sat forward and wrapped his arms around Dean and pulled him into a hug and began to slowly kiss along the man's neck.
Looking into the green eyes, that now met his. Barachiel breathed deep the aroma in the air around him in then he began to tell the story of Castiel.
"Yo! Cas. Are you paying attention" ducking his head in embarrassment Cas replied "I'm sorry. What?".
“and when we found where your vessel. No, your body had been placed by Sam. I gripped you by your shoulders as Uriel reached inside of me” as he spoke, Castiel removed one of his hands from Dean's shoulder and placed it palm open onto the center of his own chest. His eyes staring intently into Dean's own as if daring him to try and look away. Then, very slowly he lowered his open palm and placed it back down at the center of Dean's bare chest. Castiel could feel the rapid beat of his Love's heart under his fingers
Stopping briefly to see how his audience of one was holding up. And satisfied he had his full attention he continued "Uriel of course had Rafael ear and Rafael took it to Michael. And from there Dean Winchester the plan was set into motion that would trap me at the Edge of the Darkness. Simply by providing me with compelling evidence of the problem growing there. Of course, the second half of their plan involved making sure they had the right vessel's at just the right moment. Which you already know the backstory. Those poor Cherubim. They were inconsolable when they found out how they had been used in an effort to get the right pairing of humans in order for that to happen. Of course, you know the rest from here on that score. What they didn't plan on was you making a deal with the demon for your soul." looking at Dean quizzically. Dean could only respond with a shrug as he said "I did it for Sam."
Dean had no choice but to confess the reason to his brother "Because, Barachiel said that God knew we...I, would move heaven and earth to rescue him if I thought he was in pain or being harmed. He knows that we can get into Hell or Purgatory. So God put this...this place on the table as a possible punishment."
"You say that like it is a bad thing." Dean responded uncertainly. "Cas, you have to stop this crazy talk and tell me what gives..."
Dean looked at Castiel and he replied "This was before we...our agreement Cas. So I get it and I promise we won't do anything stupid.”
"Because, when God bent over him and breathed Grace into Castiel. Why, he looked up into His creator's eyes and said..." Barachiel paused and looked up into the blue sky. He let out a small laugh at the memory and when he looked down at Dean Winchester he continued
His eyes had begun to water but it didn't stop Dean from continuing "Castiel stood up, by himself and fought against each and every one of those dicks all to save humanity, to prevent them from succeeding with their plan to take over and now you have the balls to come here and tell him that he has to come back home, to heaven and face God for the sins he committed" taking a deep breath Dean calmed himself by taking another drink from his beer.
Blinking quickly as if the rapid eyelid movement would help reconnect his vision with the synapse of his brain and clarify what he was seeing. Feeling a little embarrassed, Sam took a half-step back ready to turn and go back out the way he had come. His heart was pounding in his chest as he still tried to make sense of what he was seeing. But then, there was a subtle shift in Dean’s position and the scene before him came into better focus. Dean was not giving Cas a blow-job (Sam had to admit. He found it slightly disappointing as he knew his brother had an un-admitted to crush on the fallen Angel) he was in fact just singing softly to the angel. A smile broke out on his own lips as Sam heard the lyrics in the unmistakable bluesy, rock and roll voice of his brother float throughout the small bedroom:
Looking down at the forgotten book in his hands, he began to close it as it seemed unimportant for the moment. Dean seeing his action decided he needed a distraction – something else to focus on. Asking in a flat tone "So you were about to say you found something in there about Hell's creatures."
Castiel looked down at the damp ground and said "Yes, I have..." and before he could elaborate further a screaming sound from below interrupted him and looking in the direction from which it came. He saw the demon's were again patrolling and a group of them had decided to start tormenting one of the smaller demons.
Crowley looked at Dean and with a nod and a slight smile he said "Think nothing of it. Like I said before, I kind of liked the choir boy."
"Hey...What are you doing?" Looking up Dean realized he was about to take a swing at his brother and stopped it mid-throw.
Crowley again shook his head. "Nothing, he worked alone and he etched the warding into it himself with markings I have never seen before. When I tried to ask he merely said that the angel that it was for betrayed his trust beyond forgiveness and that he would be locked up for awhile."
"The Empty" shaking his head Sam continued with disbelief "Why on earth would God send Castiel out there?" Sam recalled Billie's explanation and grew even more concerned.
Sam let out a frustrated sigh as stared at the scroll he had unfurled before him. “Nothing.” he said to himself. He had hoped this scroll would have had something more about what kind of process Chuck...God would put Cas through as a Fallen Angel. He had studied some law at Stanford and  he knew how it worked here on earth but what he wanted...what he had hoped for was a better understanding of what Cas might go through when he faced his accusers up in Heaven and apparently, The Men of Letters had very little on what went on in Heaven when it came to what could be loosely termed legal proceedings. Of course, it was a long shot he knew. It was heaven. Not exactly a place that many people would get that kind of intel on.
"Where have you been, Brother? Why did you not come back...to help?" the emotion behind his question hurt Barachiel. Because he knew what he really meant was: why weren't you here to help...to help me?
With a nod Castiel turned to Sam and approached him with arms wide and gave the tall man a hug. When he pulled away he said "Please watch him Sam. He is..." Castiel could not find the words he needed to say when he heard Sam's reply "I know Cas. I will keep an eye on him. I promise."
To the Hunters who fight the good fight against evil, for the Winchester Boys who always carried on, no matter how hard the fight. And for the Angel who never changed and never lost his faith in mankind - or in me.
“Like a ghost or something” Dean became thoughtful as his mind went down the list of probable entities that could be active under this situation. “Yeah...that would definitely make this a case for us.”
Grimly, Castiel took one last look around and up at the blue sky above and realized time was running short and with his mouth set in a firm line. Castiel whisked himself away from the park and headed to face the last person he needed to say goodbye to: Dean Winchester.
Dean couldn't help but close his eyes as a warm tongue began to flick in and out along the space just below his ear. A small groan escaped his lip just as the angel found a sweet spot. Reaching his hand to grip the rear seat, Dean caught nothing but air and Dean realized he was no longer in a small confined space but rather in a much more roomier location.
Cas had reached the table and as he picked up a couple of books he casually asked "More research on Rowena?" but before either Winchester could answer. Dawning began to spread across Castiel's face as he read the parts that had been marked with sticky notes.  Dean tried to explain before Castiel could get upset.
They entered the dimly lit room through a heavy oaken door and scanned the interior for a place to sit. They didn't have to look very hard. Except for the two patrons sitting at the bar conversing with the bartender. They had their choice of seating throughout the rest of the dimly lit room. Grabbing Barachiel's arm, Castiel guided the angel to a table located furthest away from the jukebox and the horrible sound it made. Over at the bar there were three men who stared as they watched the unusual duo make their way into the room. Nodding in their direction, after settling Barachiel into one of the wooden chairs. Castiel sat down heavily in the one opposite his friends. "Do you know what you want?" Barachiel took a deep breath and seemed to ponder the question for a moment and as if coming to a momentous decision he replied "Yes. I would like to have a whiskey." Nodding at his choice Castiel having been to many types of bars now with the Winchesters, knew this was not a table side service kind of place. He pushed himself back to his feet and made his way over to the bar to place their order. Looking around as he waited for their order, Castiel couldn't help but recall the number of times he and the Winchesters had been in places similar to this one. Making plans for whatever evil they were going up against or just as friends passing the time together in camaraderie. The bartender finished pouring the whiskey and placed the open bottle of beer on the glossy bar top in front of Castiel. Reaching into his coat pocket Castiel retrieved the leather case that held the plastic card Sam had given him to pay for things when he needed to. Handing the card over he said in his best imitation of Dean "run a tab, please" The bar tender nodded and took the card. Castiel picked up the drinks and walked back over to the table. Placing the glass of amber liquid in front of Barachiel, Castiel took his place in the chair opposite his friend. Raising his glass towards Castiel, Barachiel brought the glass towards his lips pausing briefly to take in the aroma of its contents. Closing his eyes Barachiel took a sip and shivered.
Smirking Dean took one last look at the green-eyed grasshopper still working the blue lupine and said "Take me home. I can't stand this place."
Getting no response. The kid tried one more time to get his attention and when he finally caught the dude's eye. He was rewarded with a set of green eyes that made him feel as though he risked a limb if he opened his mouth again. Taking a more placating tone he said
Castiel stopped for a moment and couldn't resist the urge to lean down and brush his lips softly against Dean's parted ones.
Crowley's look of irritation turned to one of amusement. Knowing the brother's were more likely to enjoy watching he and his Mother fight each other rather than share such info. So, with a smirk on his lips and a slight nod in thanks. He replied "Rowena's Celtic Coven? Sounds like a horrible all girl folk band."
Selfishly, Castiel decided to pretend he had not noticed Sam's entrance. He didn’t want this intimate moment he was sharing with the eldest Winchester to end. So, rather than be the one to break the spell by turning and acknowledging the tall man's entry, Castiel decided to wait for Dean to make the first move and when Dean continued to sing, Cas realized Dean was clueless to his brother’s entrance. Cas could not help but give a small prayer to his Father. Asking him to make Sam leave so he and Dean could have just a little more time together. Wrong to ask he knew but Cas did not care. And so it was with a little shock that Castiel sensed another shift in the air as Sam had turned and left the room. Even going so far as to close the door behind him. Castiel smiled and as Dean finished the last line to Kashmir, Cas slowly opened his eyes and looked directly down and into the warm green eyes of the mortal man he had come to love above all others.
Dean fought hard against letting his emotions get the better of him. But when Cas placed his hand on his cheek and looked at him with such love. Dean could not but help but give in and show Castiel how he truly felt. How much he wanted to show Cas the love he felt for him.
After they had in silence for a few moments and enjoyed their beverages Dean finally decided it was time to end the charade.
“Hey Guys…get this....”  and he stopped cold as he looked up from his screen at the scene playing out in front of him on Dean's memory foam bed. Thoughts of regret took over as Sam began to reconsider his decision to enter Dean's room without knocking first.
Suddenly, there was a small shudder, and at first Castiel had thought he imagined it, but he had felt the imperceptible movement pass through his hand and then. Dean's chin slowly began to turn into his out stretched palm that had been caressing his cheek only moments before.  Cas felt the soft hair of Dean's scruffy beard tickling the sensitive center of his hand, a shiver traveled up his arm and a warmth spread throughout his body and eventually settling into his groin as soft lips began pressing into the center of his palm.
"But the reality is; Our Father has come home to put things into order and when he saw the damage done because of my brothers and sisters. It was too much for him to bear and he became angry. The first thing he did was ask Amara to free myself and my command of angel's from the Darkness. After we returned Dean Winchester, justice came swift and without mercy for some and for others? He brought them to stand before him and answer for their crimes, to explain themselves. All of them Lucifer, Michael, Raphael, Zachariah, Uriel. They have had their time with Father but now, as you already know, there is only one left..." before Barachiel could finish Dean proved him right when he broke his silence with a ragged whisper
Castiel changed his expression to one of curiosity and Crowley continued to explain at his questioning look
Castiel stayed standing in the park where Claire had left him less than an hour before, listening to Dean's prayer to him. It was really more of a confession than a prayer and after it had finished. Castiel now understood what Claire had been trying to tell him. Dean was in love and because of this, Dean was also in a great deal of pain.
Castiel studied the dark weathered face of the powerful angel's chosen vessel, searching for a sign of deceit or dangerous intent. Realizing his efforts would be futile because of who and what his friend was, Castiel made the choice to trust his instincts about a friendship that went back to the day of his creation.
Sam walked over to the chair across from his brother and pulled it out. Folding his larger frame into the wooden seat Sam called Dean's name and when his brother's green-eyes looked up to meet his own. He began to speak calmly. For his brother's sake.
“Dean.”  Cas briefly kissed Dean's mouth “Barachiel, he would only find me. I cannot hide from him. Not even through time”
“I need to ask you something and it's something I have always wanted to know more about but I wasn't  ever ready to hear the answer. So I never did.”
Sam rolled his eyes and reached out and grabbed the laptop back from his brother and following a few taps of his finger he turned the screen back around and replied with some satisfaction in his voice “Because of this-” Dean threw his hands out so he could grab the laptop from Sam’s hands before there could be a repeat of the previous near miss to his face and he brought the computer closer and studied the new web page on the screen, his brow furrowed in doubt. Castiel shifted his position and came to stand behind Dean and began to look at the screen over his shoulder and because of his slightly shorter stature, Cas was forced to lean up against the taller man’s backside and peak over his shoulder Dean swallowed hard and held himself still. There was a part of him wanted to move away or at the very least adjust the position of the computer so that Cas would not have to be so close, but something held him back from doing so and instead he looked up into Sam’s face.
"Castiel? Your vessel looks unwell." Castiel swallowed hard and suddenly a phrase by humans came to mind "rip the band-aide off". He recalled the time and effort Sam Winchester took to explain the meaning behind it. He called it an allegory. Castiel with the fear of seeing the humans he had come to love above all others and telling them good bye for the last time. He impetuously decided now was the time to "rip off his band-aide" and looked back at Barachiel as he blurted out. "What if I were to say I was ready now?"
Castiel noticed and rolled his eyes and with a shake of his head amended his comment “I almost always did as you asked. It was all because I loved you.”
And with desperation in his voice Dean whispered “Please Cas' there has to be something.' Spinning around as an idea struck. Dean looked at Cas with pleading green eyes “Time travel. You can take us back...an hour...a month. What ever we can. We can go back and have more time together!”
At the mention of the Empty, Dean began to feel as if the whole room was closing in on him. He knew what the Empty meant, it had been described to him by Billie, the Reaper. It was where the angels and demons who were killed are sent and never allowed to escape. They existed in darkness and loneliness.  Suddenly, he knew that had to get away from this angel sitting next to him. Pushing himself off of his stool, Dean threw some cash on to the bar top and with a whistle at the bar tender he made a thumbs up motion and turned towards the door and walked away from the Archangel. The spell bound bartender watched with indifference as the man just threw a wad of cash on the bar and stroll for the door.
Sam picking up on the angel's cue, cut in with "You're right, Cas. Maybe we are getting worked up for nothing." he finished with a quick glance at his brother hoping to get him into a different frame of mind.
Rolling himself onto his left side, curling himself ever so slightly around Cas in order to get into position himself closer to the tape player. Dean held his finger above the play button as he continued
"No. No it doesn't" Castiel said keeping his voice flat. Normally he would have jumped in with an offer to go and find out what he could about the nymph named Orphne and what Rowena may be up to but he knew his time here on Earth could not be wasted with a new case. He desperately wanted to tell the Winchester brothers the real reason for his visit but he didn't know how to begin...or afraid to. Using the parchment as a distraction, Castiel began to roll the old document up and looked around the table for the ribbon that kept it bound up. Then as he searched Castiel allowed his eyes to begin to drift up from the table top and began to look around the room itself. His memory became flooded with the hours spent here with the two hunters. He also realized just how much he cherished his time here and in a way, Castiel felt this place had become more of a home to him than Heaven ever had been. Feeling as if the room was closing in, Castiel took another quick glance at the table for the lost ribbon. Spotting it partially concealed under one of the large volumes of Druid lore. He snatched the ribbon quickly and slipped it back on to the ancient roll and then looked up into the steady green-eyes of his friend. Castiel felt uncomfortable under Dean's steady gaze and as he was about to turn away when he realized Dean was not studying him but had asked a question and was merely waiting for a response.
Seeing the basic defensive stance, Barachiel raised his hands in a placating gesture but stopped short as he noticed Castiel flick his hidden sword hand and the familiar sound of an Angel's Blade slide into place. "My brother. I promise you, I am not here to bring you harm. Though I can understand why you give pause to my arrival."
When Sam assured Dean that he didn't care in the least and even suspected a few times himself that Dean was more open minded sexually then he let on and that he had feelings for Cas. He had to ask Dean why he never acted or even explained what he felt to Cas. Dean had replied very simply.
Reaching the end of the rack Dean looked down at the basket at his feet to check its contents and make sure it had everything he and Sam needed to make it through the evening. Satisfied there were plenty of frozen burritos, protein bars, SlimJims, apple pie and of course more aspirin, Dean bent down to pick up the basket, realizing that the only thing missing was the beer. Dean straightened and turned to walk back up the aisle towards to cold box where the beer was kept. Suddenly, a flash of light, like a cell phone's camera going off caught his eye.
Crowley waited expectantly for the angel to answer his inquiry but after it became apparent the angelic nuisance had no intention of speaking. The dark suited King of Hell raised his eyebrows in resignation and sighed. Moving closer to stand along side the angel and mirroring his stance as he stared down at his idiot demon guards below. Who were now all congregated under a pool of light created by one of the flood lights mounted on the cinder block wall. After waiting for what he considered an appropriate amount of time for the angel to say something, Crowley could not stand the silence any longer and began to turn towards the trench-coated do-gooder to begin the conversation but before he could. Castiel broke the silence beating him to it.
Sam nodded with some relief at hearing his older brother's familiar snark directed at the angels. Because for a second there he thought he was going to lose him and for the briefest of moments he saw true fear on his brother's face.
Claire ducked her head a bit when Castiel mentioned her pride. It was the same character flaw Jody would sometimes bring up. Only she called it stubbornness. With a small laugh and a mind to end their visit on a lighter note Claire spoke.
Firing up the throaty engine of the Impala, Dean reached over and cranked his radio volume up and waited for the music to start playing and as he heard the song beginning to blare from the speakers he grimaced and began to reach over and press the button to go to another preset but his hand hesitated and then he let it drop down to the seat beside him. Closing his eyes, Dean paused and then reached up and cranked the radio louder, revved the engine and after slipping it into gear, Dean crushed the throttle of the car down to the floor boards and as the tires spun through the rocky surface of the parking lot, they created double rooster tails and with a small fish tail the black classic tore off towards the main road as Clapton's Tears in Heaven blasted on the radio.
Their bodies now satiated by their lovemaking. The two men lay together with their limbs intertwining. Dean's head laying on Cas chest as the angels arms wrapped around him and held him close. Dean's hand lay on the firm lower abdomen of his lover. His thumb absently swirling the thin patch of hair that trailed downward. Each lost in their own thoughts but both thinking about the other,
Castiel stared back into defiant green eyes framed by an angular face. Made more angular because of the overhead lighting and the shadows being cast through the side windows. Castiel allowed a small smile of understanding to cross his lips when he realized what Dean was doing. Then he slowly reached his left hand up and placed it on the soft stubbled cheek of the man sitting next to him. The angel could feel the tenseness radiating in the skin under his open hand.  The tendon directly under his palm contracting as if a million volts were coursing through it.
With tears beginning to roll, from the corners of his eye's, he began to laugh out loud as the weight of worry about his best friend was lifted from his shoulders. Not caring in the least Dean looked upwards and said aloud."Way to go Castiel...way to go you dorky little nerd angel" then with a sad sigh he added “I love you, Babe and I miss you so much it hurts.”
Dean hugged Castiel tightly as the tears he had fought to keep at bay began to fall. “Okay, Cas. Okay.”
They did not leave the flower filled meadow, they merely rose above it and coalesced their energy and if it could have been measured. It would have been recorded as encompassing not only the meadow but up into the mountains beyond. Their energy simply existed and to the wildlife it was unnoticed as were the empty vessels left behind.
"You're a prophet. I'd recognize the signs anywhere. What can I do for you?" The man adjusted his long coat and said
Dean was walking back out of the kitchen and watched as Sam headed towards the doorway leading to the archive rooms and called out "good idea, Sammy". Dean then turned his attention back over at the angel who had now moved over into the living area. Cas had casually moved into the other room when he saw Sam moving to exit the room. He wasn't fooled...he was after all a celestial being and knew Sam well enough to know that he was making an excuse to not be in the same room as he.
Castiel continued "promise me you won't stop praying. Where ever I end up. I will still hear you as your Guardian Angel and it will give me comfort."
Just off to their left they heard the familiar fluttering of an arriving angel. Looking over Dean instantly found his grief being replaced by his anger as he saw standing slightly behind Barachiel, two Angel's each with their angel blades drawn.
"Your name and better yet, what kind are you? Are you a good one or are you one of those dick ones?"
Sorry for the delay. I am easily distracted and when I sit down to write I check out the new stories. Then I start reading those stories and I forget about mine. It is all very messy. Anyway, here is a new chapter. I do not have anyone to read them so if they are grammatically horrible or punctuationally (not a word, I know but I don't care) awkward. I apologize.
Crowley looked at the large man stuck in place and gave a scoffing smile. Waving his hand to release him "That is your problem. I promise you, I am merely here to offer my condolences"
"Yes, very noble of you but it gave Michael and Lucifer the final solution to another problem. My second in command who was left behind with a contingent of angels, Castiel"
Later as Dean snored softly against Cas' chest. Castiel looked over at the clock and realized the two of them had been together for almost four hours which left just over an hour for him to meet Barachiel at Stull Cemetery. Briefly, a part of him had thoughts to let Dean sleep in his arms for a while longer then just jump alone to the cemetery but he knew he could not do that to Dean. Plus, he would not mind another ride with Dean and Sam in the Impala with the Zepplin mixed tape Dean had made for him playing in the background,
Quickly realizing who it was and fearing they had waited to long to burn Castiel's body Sam grabbed the demon knife from his belt and yelled out in alarm as he ran towards his brother. "Crowley...stay away from..." before he could finish the King of Hell looked over at him and waved his hand causing Sam to become frozen in place.
Castiel swallowed and moved away from the King and was now unsure of how much he wanted to give away answered briefly.
After settling into the more familiar form once again, Castiel looked to his brother. His confusion and sadness sensed by the other. Who immediately tried to explain.
Sam looked with curiosity at his brother's change in direction and then dropped the heavy book with a thump on the nearest table and related what he had read "Um, yeah. Apparently, Crowley's favorite pets, his Hell-hounds are descended from the original watch dog of Hades, Cerberus. A three headed dog that guarded the gates of Hades." Dean stared at his brother waiting for the part where he was supposed to understand where it all mattered. "So...?"
Waving his hand at Dean as he finished. Dean could only nod his head and roll his eyes in answer to the predictable description of his habits. Reaching out with a brief wave of his hand indicating the man was to hand it over and the man promptly did with some relief. Then as if a great load had been lifted from his shoulders he quickly turned to leave and as he did he muttered "now I can finally go home. Get back with my family"
Deliberately making eye contact as he continued "And if you are still interested..." Dean paused to licked his lips as he brought his eyes back down to the pink lips of Castiel.
“I don’t know. Anything! What if they took something from the wreck and now they are paying the price!”
Castiel opened his eyes to a vibrant blue sky and after a brief moment of being disoriented, Castiel turned his head towards the voice coming from his left side and immediately tensed. Standing a few yards away in the guise of an elderly black man he instantly recognized his older brother and the God's Commander of the Guardian Angels: the Archangel Barachiel.
"I am not sure why. I once asked Castiel about it long before Naomi and he seemed confused by the question and said he could not say. What I will tell you though is that, Father had called me over afterwards and he said 'Barachiel you watch that one. He will be something special.' and he was not wrong about that."
Dean was about to object to the relationship status he was assigned to with Crowley but was stopped when Barachiel held up placating hands.
Dean looked over at Cas and for his part the angel extended his hand and waived it in the direction of Sam with a slight nod of his head. Dean turned to look back at Sam and began to fill his brother in on the latest bombshell dropped at their feet.
“What? What did they take. Some old cannon balls or treasure. Did the ship have any treasure on it?” Dean said in a voice now tinged with a little more interest.
Sam recovering after the surprise of almost being punched. Could only stare at his brother in confusion. "What? Who?"
Sam waited as his raised voice echoed through wide hallways of the bunker. Tilting his head a little bringing his ear more in line with the large open doorway behind his position at the table. He waited for some sort of response from the other inhabitants of the bunker. His brother Dean and the off again on again Angel of the Lord, Castiel. Who just so happen to be off again...well not completely off. He does have some of his mojo working, were somewhere in the building doing whatever. Knowing his brother like he did, Sam figured he was either at the range or with Cas, binging Netflix.
"Castiel, when you allowed Lucifer to occupy your vessel and escape." with disbelief he Barachiel continued "Castiel...how could you do that? The damage he caused...the child he created?"
Sam looked at his brother in surprise. Reading or trying to decipher anything was not usually his thing. His brother tended to stick with his computer and the porn contained in it when he was left alone.
Barachiel was moved by his most trusted captain's display of emotion and as he held his brother tight against the frail body of his vessel, the Archangel himself wept right along with him.
Dean stared at his empty bottle half tempted to get the bartender's attention. He was confused and though his anger had not been completely assuaged by his outburst at the angel. He did feel like maybe, this angel might be on Castiel's side. Burned out and exhausted Dean searched for what to say next and when it finally came to him. The question he needed...was afraid to ask. Swallowing hard and then speaking in a deliberate manner he let the words flow from him "What do you think God will do to him?" Dean had placed a little more emphasis on the word God.
Dean continued to stare at the table and looked at Sam and said "There is a way to keep him from Purgatory, living in a cage close to Lucifer or being banished to the Empty. Maybe we can talk with Chuck. He owes us." Sam looked at Dean and said "Well, I am not sure about playing the 'you owe us' card on God and besides, you said yourself that if that happens. Then we will never know where he is. He would still be lost to us."
Sam understood why Cas had chosen to say good bye on his own but he couldn't help but add. "Cas, when you talk to her. You make sure she understands that we. That Dean and I..." Sam glanced at his brother to make sure he was on board and he could tell from his facial expression that he was "...that we will always be here for her. All she has to do is call and we will drop everything and be there."
"Yes, Castiel. Lucifer refuses to confess even to Father about how he pulled it off but somehow with Michael's help and some warding magic. They bound myself along with my contingent of angels to the boundary between the Darkness and the Light" Barachiel replied with disappointment filling his voice. "It happened so quickly, Castiel. We had barely arrived. When we were bound and rendered immobile and as Amara broke free. I had to sit there and struggle as I watched Amara leave us behind." Barachiel let the anger seep deeper into his voice as he continued his story.
Although, for several months after the night Castiel left them. Dean did try to find out from Crowley, or any demon they happened to capture. What they knew of the inquisitions going on in heaven or more specifically, with Cas. Crowley, the few times he actually showed up when he was called. Would just say he doesn't know anything. A few demons after hours of persuasive interrogation said something about Lucifer and some cages but the Winchesters were never able to get confirmation because Crowley had suddenly disappeared and was somehow ignoring their summoning rituals
“Yeah?” Dean said as he subtly tried to lean away from Cas but still with some happiness in his voice.
Dean looked away and stared of into the distance looking at the tops of the mountains. They were covered in snow and made for a beautiful contrast against the deep blue of the sky.
So, closing his eyes Dean let himself go and allowed himself to tear down the wall he had built to keep him safe from Cas and being hurt. He allowed himself to feel the love that at this moment seemed so overwhelming that he could barely contain it. Turning his head and bringing his lips to brush the warm hand against his face. Dean didn't care as the tears began to roll down his cheek and was only vaguely aware as Cas' other hand came up to wipe them.
Looking down at the old hands of his vessel, Barachiel began to notice the lines and weathered look of them. He began to rub them together as he answered "A possible worst case would be Purgatory or...in Hell with Lucifer or..." Barachiel paused suddenly unsure if he should mention the rest but it was too late.
Dean knew one thing about Heaven's second most rebellious angel and that is when he started on about the bees, it was all you could do to shut him up and right now hearing about his time with the bees seemed to be the last thing he wanted to discuss.
Of course, the headaches had been happening off and on for the last few weeks but none of them had been like this morning's splitter. He didn't know why he began to have the headache's and Sam had grown concerned when he noticed the rate at which the aspirin seemed to be disappearing from the bunker med-kit. He tried to tell his younger brother that everything was fine but it wasn't really the truth. Because the headaches began when he had started the dreams about Cas. He never remembered them and if he tried it just seemed to make the headaches worse.
"Well boys, I imagine, I am going to be busy for awhile. I expect lots of work to be coming my way. So, I will be off." Both men still had no idea about the cages and he intended to keep his word about not ever telling them. As he began to raise his hand to snap his fingers Dean called out and with some slight effort said.
Deciding that he had to get this human to understand what was at stake. Barachiel set a plan in place for some drastic measures to be taken in order to get his undivided attention.
“Okay Cas” Dean said as he reached over to hit the play button on the cassette player “This tape is going to start off with a song you have heard me play before, Zeppelin’s; Stairway to Heaven. Recorded in ‘71 the music was written while in England by Page…”
Trying to get it flash again...for he was sure it was this piece that caused the light to flare. Suddenly, as he tilted and turned the piece with his finger tips the sculpted wings did something completely unexpected. It had gone from a clear see through glass to an oily black that filled the interior space of the sculpture. Fascinated now, Dean tilted the piece again and the glass returned to its original clear state.
Nodding his head as the man answered Dean realized he didn't really care where they were. He only cared about Cas and what he was about to face. Alone.
Castiel felt Dean’s sudden change in position and for his part was a little disappointed. He was going to miss the brush of Dean’s leg alongside his own, but this new position directly in front of him was okay too.
Castiel heard Dean stop at the top of the three stairs that led down into the room and knew he was being studied, sensing the concern his friend was showing. He knew the time had come for him to tell his best friend, his brother and in some respects his savior about what had transpired between Barachiel and himself. Bowing his head in resignation, Castiel turned slowly, raising his chin as he did so to meet the worried green eyes of his friend with his own.
"So. The Greek nymph Orphne, she resided in Hades and was able to use her abilities to summon and control all sorts of enchanted and cursed creatures in the Underworld. Cerberus being one of them." Dean continued to stare at his brother with a blank expression. Still shell shocked by Cas' news, Dean tried to remain focused on his brother and what he was saying but was having a difficult time of doing so.
"I am not sure Dean. As you know nothing has been written yet. So there is always hope but I need to know, that you will be okay regardless of what happens. I don't think I could stand spending eternity worrying that you are okay."
“This is how.” and then he slowly took Dean's hand and brought it to over to his now throbbing cock. The dark hair surrounding the base of the shaft was now glistening from the dripping wetness that came from their swollen members as they rubbed against each other.
"Are you ready Castiel? To return to Heaven and face our Father and answer for your part in what happened there and here, on earth" as he finished speaking he heard Dean Winchester give a small out burst and privately hoped he had not sent the others away too soon.
"Aw Squirrel." deciding to take more of a cheeky attitude in hopes that the eldest Winchester would trust him more if he did so. "Your loyalty to that shell amuses me. But I can assure you that is not why I am here. And besides, that" the demon added some disgust to his voice "other angel friend of yours...he carved a mark into his ribs when he touched him" advancing past Sam, Crowley continued "there isn't a being in this universe who can take that as a vessel." Crowley' voice became a little more placating  "I have come Dean because despite everything we have all been through together. As adversaries and as allies, I came to respect this angel and have come to pay them"
As the dusky light began to trade places with the dark purple of early evening, the trench-coated figure of Castiel, stood on a grassy knoll overlooking the King of Hell's newest "palace". Crowley had chosen another abandoned mental hospital that had been closed almost fifty years before because of an intrepid reporter who went undercover and exposed the horrific unsanctioned medical treatments used in efforts to "cure" those with mental disorders. Castiel suspected he liked to use these locations for the convenient layout of the buildings with their multiple rooms each with the security that would make any prison system look weak in comparison. Of course, there would be the added benefit of any tortured souls that may be bound to the place because of slow or agonizing deaths. Castiel continued to watch as the demon sentries walk around the high walls or as they stood close together in conversation. The night air had a chill to it and even though it did not affect him in a physical way. He did enjoy the sensation it was – refreshing. Looking up into the deep purple of night sky at the brilliant stars that glistened, he took a breath and exhaled and instantly regretted his actions. Squeezing his eyes shut, Castiel dropped his chin to his chest the memory of the falling angels and the streaks they left in the evening sky as they fell still fresh in is memory. He blamed himself and even though he was tricked into helping Metatron, the Scribe of God in completing his spell to oust his brethren from their home. Castiel still felt the pain of responsibility. Because he understood that it was his weakness in his trusting in an angel of Metatron's standing, that allowed the Scribe to lead him down such a terrible road. Of course, for all of his other transgressions and his faith that the angels had held the same beliefs as himself when it came to mankind. It was his weakness in allowing himself to have emotions for the humans in his charge that led to his current predicament. They tried to warn him and when Uriel, Rafael and Zachariah ambushed him in the old warehouse and dragged him from his vessel, brutally. He knew he had done the right thing in not listening to them. He had to protect them...mankind. Just as their Father had asked. But in the end, it was his hubris in believing he could fix everything and bring peace to Heaven that brought everything crashing down.
Claire released Castiel's hand and her mood changed abruptly. Her temper returning as she thought about Castiel's reason for visiting her. “Castiel, you can't let those asshats drag you back there. Why can't you just stay here with us?”
"So, for the rest of your life you will have a little bit of the angel Castiel inside you." Tilting his head he studied Dean and whispered "I just wonder..." stopping himself from going any further he let out a small laugh and shook his head. Then added “Castiel, I always knew you were a brilliant but this time...” Shaking his head as if to free it of anymore thoughts of the now gone angel, Barachiel began to walk away from the Winchester brothers
"The Empty." Dean closed his eyes tight as he heard Barachiel continue "It is worse than the place that held myself and my command Dean Winchester. It is a desolate, lonely place where nothing can escape...not even the light. And it is somewhere I want to desperately keep our Castiel out of. So. Please Dean Winchester. Give me your promise to leave Castiel be, it may be all that I have to give our Father to keep him from suffering alone in that awful place." Barachiel hated to see the torment on the young man's face but he did not know what else to do.
"Barachiel" The Archangel knew humans had a penchant for nicknaming everyone and he wasn't prepared to become a member of that club. He was giving this human a lot of leeway in his speaking manner but he wasn't about to let him have free rein.
Then with one more kiss that was deeper and lasted just little bit longer, Castiel suddenly straightened up and threw his leg over Dean's lower half. Straddling him as he placed his hands on each one of Dean Winchester's shoulders in the exact spot where he had gripped him years before.
Barachiel continued "I am sorry I did jump ahead just then but let me back up just a bit. I want you to understand everything that has happened before today. You see, I for one could not understand why He would want some lowly sheep herder to be watched over by such an angel of Castiel's rank but I figured out later, it wasn't the rank...it was Castiel himself he wanted to watch over the boy. So, I sent him as commanded and it was just after Castiel left to begin his mission with David that Dad himself became harder and harder to pin down. Until, eventually none of us could find Him at all."
"Barachiel told me a story about when you were made...given your grace by Chuck and I was wondering. What did He say to you? You know when he whispered to you.."
Not entirely convinced he continued with frustration in his voice  “I told you before Dean what would happen to me if you tried to interfere. Yet, you obviously started doing the exact opposite and looking for away to save me."
Studying the two brothers as they still knelt on the ground with the lifeless vessel lying between them he wondered to himself if they knew how they looked. Dean still bent protectively over the former vessel of his friend and Sam. The younger brother, his hands on his brother's shoulders in a show of support and protection.
"Sammy!" bursting into the kitchen Dean charged across the linoleum floor and headed to the doorway leading into the map room. Suddenly, a looming shadow filled the doorway. Startled, Dean to fell back on his heels and then instinctively assumed a defensive stance and pulled his right fist back.
Flannel Dude barely acknowledged his request and so with a shrug of his shoulders and deciding that the basket wasn't worth an arm, he put his ear buds in to drown out the skidding sounds and returned to his own magazine featuring the latest on monster trucks.
Looking mildly surprised at the interruption of his thoughts Dean replied "Huh,? Oh, nothing I was just thinking about Sam had said to me earlier about Rowena and her all girl band: the Celtic Coven." Dean watched as Cas could only nod at the answer. Raising his eyebrows in disappointed at the angel's lack of appreciation for his humor. Dean watched as Cas turned back towards the portal leading to the map room and walk through and into the other room to join Sam.
Somberly, Barachiel stared back at the man before him and placed his drink back down on the table and paused before answering "I am here Castiel because Father sent me down here to fetch you."
"Sam!" Dean started yelling for his brother as he neared the top of the stairs as they opened into the narrow hallway leading to the kitchen.
Resting against the front end of the Impala, Sam had finished building the pyre they were going to use for the Hunter's Goodbye. When the clouds that had gathered over head began to shed a light rain and he could only watch as his brother remained motionless on the ground. Cradling the body in his lap, Dean had refused to let go while the pyre was built saying he wanted to make sure no harm came to it.
Barachiel continued to let the man's pain, anger and the love cascade in waves of emotion over him and instead of answering with any kind of anger of his own or defensiveness. He patiently waited for the inevitable slow down as Dean exhausted all of his energy and accepted the inescapable reality of the situation and the realized fear that he was going to lose his Castiel. Barachiel waited to see what was going to happen next and when he was sure there was nothing left he raised his hand and tried to place it on Dean Winchester's shoulder, the young man was quick to lean away but was not quick enough as the movement had caught him off guard and when Barachiel made contact a calmness washed through the young man and a look of peace fell across his face.
Castiel looked over at Crowley and when he did it slowly began to dawn on him what the demon had actually done. Scoffing slightly, Castiel could not but help appreciate the small amount of pity the demon had just shown him. Though, not a direct indictment of his fate, Castiel now had an idea.
Barachiel paused only this time it was because the next part was a difficult admission "I made the mistake in trusting our brother too, Castiel. I failed to see the real motive behind his orders. I was blinded by my devotion to Michael and I did not see the trap he set but I should have, Castiel" with some frustration now riding in his voice he continued "I heard the rumors about a plot to return the age of angels and restore our dominion over Earth. They wanted to take it all back to the way it was before Eden." hoping for some understanding from his trusted friend. He continued
"No Castiel. You will wait for the time to expire and I will come for you. Father was adamant that I give you time to say goodbye to 'the Boys' as he phrased it."
"Change?" Dean was now more interested in Barachiel's story as he began to relate more of Castiel's beginning.
While rubbing the back of his head where contact had been made with the Impala, Dean also became aware of Castiel and his raising ardor and with the bump on his head forgotten, he returned his lips to Cas' soft ones that were now bit more swollen and to Dean could not look any more sexier,and said.
Looking down at his feet as if in thought. He looked up and said his voice becoming a more resonant with each word spoken "I am the Archangel Barachiel. Custodian of all Guardian Angels, who serve as protectors of our God's Commandments. A loyal servant of our Father. By his word, I declare the this time of Angels here on earth has come to an end. Peace be with you both" as Barachiel finished he gave a little shrug and a "hmph" as if to say it would do and with one last nod at the boys he tilted his head back and followed Castiel's lead and with a burst of blinding white-blue light that consumed the vessel as well and sparing the brother of having to dispose of a second body. He disappeared up into the night sky in much the same manner as Castiel.
Quickly, in order to remove the hurt from Dean's eyes. Castiel closed the distance between them and wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him closer and began to kiss him. Then with his forehead pressed against Dean's he looked up with his puppy-dog eyes and he apologized.
With soft fluttering sound, the two men appeared at the edge of a muddy parking lot for a local diner slash dive bar. Castiel had chosen this because even though it was closer to the Winchester's bunker, it was not frequented by the Winchester brothers much due to as Dean put it "dry as a hockey puck hamburgers" .
Pulling another magazine up to take a peek at the cover Dean wrinkled his brow when he realized it was another one that he already had. He tended to run a mantra as he worked through the magazine's "Got it, Got it, Got it, Need it" and it was usually the latter that ended up in his basket but lately he had noticed that the skin mags were not really a priority anymore and that it had become something he shopped for out of habit rather than need.
"Well, I had forgotten something until just now...something about Castiel and the other part of God's request of me...funny that I would forget this. Til now."
“Naomi, was right you know. I was lost the moment I grabbed your soul from Alastair and wrapped myself around it. The power of your soul Dean was almost overwhelming to me but it was exactly what I had expected. You are special Dean, very few humans have a soul that burn as bright as yours does...”
Claire tried to open her mouth as if to speak again but Castiel kept on going. Afraid to stop because now his speech was becoming more about convincing himself to return to Heaven and not stay here on earth, with the people he considered his family and with -  Dean. Startled. Castiel hesitated before continuing on with his argument. Wondering to himself why he singled out Dean in his thoughts. Forcing himself to refocus, Cas knew his duty, his place and that was serving his Father as a soldier.
The two angels returned to their respective vessels and when Castiel looked over towards Barachiel. Who was rolling his shoulders as if to adjust the fit of his vessel, he merely said "Follow me"
Castiel felt the warmth of tears form in his eyes as he looked at the human sitting across from him and said "It's okay, Dean. I will be fine" it was all he could think to say in an effort to make Dean feel better about the situation. He understood how humans like to say the phrase "it's okay" and "I will be fine" when trying to keep another from worrying about their problems.
Barachiel now felt he could respond to this impudent mortal. "Dean. I wish all of the pain and hurt that you and your brother had to go through could have been averted. There is nothing that I can say or do to relieve you of what you both suffered at the hands of my brothers and sisters. Although, I do understand Amara brought your mother back for a time. It is in no way enough to make up for what was done to you and Sam"
"I said; Which one are you?" Dean took another sip of his bourbon and swallowed hard trying to hold his anger in check and then he turned on his stool to face the man sitting one stool over and looked without flinching into into the deepness of the man's dark brown almost black eyes. At first, upon seeing the man's eyes up close, Dean needed to pause because they almost reminded him of the oily black orbs possessed by demons. Of course, he also realized he may be projecting his feelings that angels are no better than their counter-parts the demons. Sarcasm dripping from his voice. Dean obliged the angel by repeating his question.
Sort of keeping his promise to his brother, Sam woke Dean two hours later and not after the one hour that he had requested. Originally he had gone in to Dean's room as requested but Dean was in a deep sleep and Sam couldn't bring himself to wake him. Especially because of what lay ahead for them all.
It had been a very long time since Sam had seen his brother in such a state of mind so when Dean barked out his orders, Sam could only nod at his brother, the concern he was beginning to feel growing. Then he watched helplessly, as Dean continued to grab books from the library shelves and throw them onto the table. Sam tried to follow the story Dean was telling about Castiel and his creation and something about watching a sheep herder who was really the first hunter but Dean's jumping around in the storytelling made it difficult to follow along. Especially, as he would bounce from room to room grabbing great volumes of lore books. Sam wasn't even sure if Dean knew what he was grabbing. Finally, getting frustrated Sam had to put a stop to Dean's manic behavior. Jumping in front of his brother then grabbing his book laden arms he forced Dean to stop and look up.
The King of Hell stared at the space vacated by the Winchester's angelic water boy and said softly to the empty space, "I sincerely hope not, Castiel" with a last look up towards the sky...towards heaven. The King of Demon's turned and headed back down the hill to punish some demons for shirking their duties and get the awful taste of being nice out of his system.
Crowley finished for him "Yes, I know he would try to move Heaven and Hell just to get you out if he knew you were there, locked up." scoffing just a bit he said "and that Castiel, is definitely not something I need in my life"
Sam watched as Dean narrowed his gaze in irritation at his chosen words, and he knew his brother was about to launch into a defensive retort about his obvious misunderstanding of what he saw going on between himself and Cas. So to head him off, Sam spun the laptop he had been cradled in his arms and thrust the open screen into Dean’s face, barely stopping before hitting him in the nose with the edge of the device and with some excitement in his voice said. “I think we have a case.” Dean continued to glare at Sam then with some hesitation he broke eye contact and squinted at the screen that was now far too close to be seen clearly. Rolling his eyes, he grabbed the computer from Sam and moved it to a more readable distance and began to scan the screen.
At first, Dean was shocked at the sudden arrival of the Angel but as Cas climbed into the car taking the seat beside him. Dean forced himself to avoid looking his way but Castiel. Well, Castiel was undaunted and continued to focus his gaze on Dean, not a word passing between them. Until, Dean couldn't avoid it any longer and he let his eyes dart to the corners towards Castiel. Then when he found he couldn't resist any longer. Dean turned and looked up into the blue eyes of Castiel's vessel. Hoping that the wall that he set in place would remain intact against the onslaught sitting next to him.
"Yes! What is so hard for you to understand." With just a bit of anger and frustration he explained to Dean "A guy. In a beard. A pair of Chuck Taylor's and an old army jacket. Shows up at my work walks up to me and he tells me I had to bring it. His exact words were "I command you to bring the word of God to the Gas N Sip off the 45 where it meets route 10 and look for to Dean Winchester." The man began to pace anxiously and continued "Said I could probably find you reading porn and buying beer and pie and what do you know, here you are."
"Dean..." before he could say anything more Dean Winchester snapped up his chin and looked Castiel directly in his eyes and as green eyes met blue, an unspoken understanding that came from years of fighting side-by-side, drinking and a love that had now passed between them.  Dean in a voice for only Cas could hear, said "Yes!" Castiel slowed his steps not sure of what Dean was doing. Then h understood perfectly. And careful to not break eye contact with his love. He began to move quickly forward and Cas heard Dean say clearly once more "Yes, Cas. Do it now"
“So….” Dean couldn’t understand the concern here. “It’s an oil rig, Sam. And from what I get reading this article, it just sounds like the guys may have just taken off without telling anyone. Why do you think it is a case”
Castiel tried to hide his impatience at the timing of the Archangel's request but nodded and stood up and as he did so, he reached over to pick up the empty glass. "I will be right back" Barachiel used the time to study his friend as he stood at the bar ordering drinks. Wondering at how the angel seemed to move so comfortably in the world of mortals. "Maybe it wont be so bad" he said softly to himself. He watched as his friend approached carrying their drinks. Taking his from Castiel he again raised the glass and took a sip. Castiel waited before asking his question again.
Seeing the disgust in Castiel's eyes Crowley continued "That's right, Castiel. I could feel your presence. Of course, this is the first time I actually picked up on your feathery beauty and I am chalking it up to the emotions you are feeling about being called home – to Daddy and the idea that you will never see Hughie and Louie ever again." Crowley knew he had hit a nerve with the last comment and was glad he did. He didn't know if he could deal with a maudlin angel sitting on his doorstep. He couldn't believe that he wanted the angelic nightmare to get some of his fire back... he needed for him to get it back. Crowley wasn't ready to admit that he had gotten a little soft on the angel and could not afford to have him and Lucifer occupying the same space. It would be a living nightmare and he would not get a moments peace. He could see Castiel was taken aback but not surprised by the demon knowing his predicament. Crowley decided to push on with his goading "So Cas, are you here to admire my landscaping skills or are you just waiting for your chance to John Hinckly me?
Cas looked back at Claire with sadness in his eyes and then looked away unable to meet her eyes any longer. He still felt guilt over the loss of her father because of his choice to take him as a vessel. Claire had long since forgiven him and had even understood why her father had given the Angel permission to possess him. Claire herself had been possessed by Castiel however briefly but she still had some memory of it. Even though it happened almost seven years before when she was still a young girl. She knew to stop letting her emotions get the better of her. She understood that Castiel did not have any evil intent in any of his actions. She did understand after getting to know him better over the years. That it tended to be his execution of some of those decisions that sometimes left a lot to be desired.
Through the windshield, Sam could see that the front seat was empty but peeking just over the top of the seat back, a denim clad knee could be seen as it bounced in time to the music. Grasping the chromed out door handle of the front passenger side door. Sam jerked the door open and winced as the sound of his brothers music assailed his ears. Folding himself into the front seat Sam slammed the door shut and rolled the window down with the belief that it would help with the sound. It didn't, so he reached over and turned it the knob of the radio's volume just enough to make it bearable and possible for Dean and himself to have a little chat.
Trying to sound nonchalant in order to hide his concern Castiel asked "Barachiel, how are things in heaven now? I used to get some news on angel radio but recently I haven't heard anything. Of course, I assume you know, that I am considered fallen and I am afraid my acceptance back up into heaven is probably out of the question. But at least I did get the news from up there and stay up with current events." Looking down and sounding a bit lost he continued "I fear they may have taken that away now as well."
