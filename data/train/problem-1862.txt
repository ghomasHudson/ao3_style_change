She tickled under his chin, making him gurgle around his dummy.
When Sherlock was done with his bottle, John turned off the ECG, removed the leads from his baby's chest (which Sherlock looked decidedly relieved for), and uncuffed Sherlock's wrists.
"Ah." Thankfully, John didn't press to find out what the contents of the tape were. "Do you want to watch some with me tonight, then?"
Feeling drained all over again for having to contend with his own second guesses and worries, especially after being wrenched out of his little headspace, Sherlock dragged himself back into bed and had himself another long nap. It wasn't like he wouldn't be doing the same thing out on the couch from sheer boredom if he was out in the living room right now, anyway. And he deserved the rest after the long string of cases that ended just the past weekend, he reminded himself. It was no wonder his little side was poking to the surface so insistently after being ignored for so long. His last proper little day was months ago.
taken the liberty of locking Sherlock's hands into soft, pink scratch mitts when the Little detective repeatedly refused to stop rubbing at his itchy eyes.
"Pacifier. His dummy. That's what he calls it." John went to search the kitchen drawers for said nippie.
"Ohhh-kayyy," John directed him calmly and soothingly, setting the laptop aside and beckoning Sherlock to him, "come sit in Daddy's lap. There's a good boy."
Sherlock was a bit bolder with his little time each day. On Friday, he was out in the living room in a footed sleeper and watching a videotape of old animated fairytales. On an unprecedented sort of self-pitying holiday, he ignored his experiments and essays entirely and left the periodicals untouched all week.
So that's how I wound up spending two nights sharing a hotel bed with Molly.
Without turning to face John, he angled his head back in his direction just enough to ask, calmly and openly, "So what are you going to do about it?"
John palpated around the navel, pressing deep to find where its innermost knot met the abdominal wall. The doctor decided he could feel no undue swelling or internal abrasions that would preclude them from administering the next procedure.
"Damnit, Sherlock!" John roared and fumbled with the old diaper to flip it back up over Sherlock's treacherous wee-wee, getting more of his jumper in the line of fire in the process.
John heard Sherlock letting out desperate, breathy noises as the detective climbed back upstairs following his task of retrieving their dried laundry. The fretful murmurings usually signified Sherlock having gone into a much younger headspace because something had distressed him.
The baby frowned, confused, as John reached down and stuck a number of round electrode leads to his chest and one on his arm.
Disclaimer: John, if you're asking yourself whether I wrote this while high, I assure you I did not take nearly enough to achieve a satisfactory high. Bastard Gibson and his minions did away with the bulk of what I would have needed.
In point of fact, Sherlock started to fall asleep right there in the car, almost as soon as he was done with his bottle. John slid aside a panel on the back of the key fob and pressed a special button that rang the driver's mobile.
He set the baby down on the toilet and warned, "If you've got to do any more, do it now."
John made the mistake of peeking up again and was met with full-force glowering.
Pretend-John dissolved in the wake of the incident, Sherlock's senses on high alert leaving him unable to relax into that quiet spot in his mind where Daddy came to him.
John sighed wryly, "Of course you're not going to tell me. I'm going to lose sleep on this, you know."
It was clear from the way Sherlock's chest heaved that it was a struggle for him to keep quiet enough to listen to what Daddy and Mary were saying. On the upside, it appeared his fussing was beginning to wind down on account of him becoming worn out.
He left, shut Sherlock's door, and popped down the hall to say to Mary, "I'm hopping in the shower. Would you keep an ear out for him?"
It struck Sherlock that he'd already taken that leap. If he didn't already subconsciously trust John with this, last night would not have happened. He would have to remember to keep reminding himself of that in future, until he felt secure enough not to worry over it.
The downside to the shower cleaner is that it tends to strip the colour out of thing like wood, varnish, wallpaper, and carpet, especially when mixed with other household chemicals. Mrs. H and John both assert that 'colour-stripped' isn't the same thing as 'clean'.
Written just last night, and I broke out the booze toward the end, so my hearty apologies if it's lacking. Completely unedited, un-spellchecked, un-beta-read, etc. Hot off the press, finished shortly after five a.m. (Edit: typos fixed. I found a few spots where my missing H key became problematic.)
His face stained with tears, Sherlock's kicking stilled when he saw his nippie. He fidgeted and mewled around his fingers, which John then gently tugged out of his mouth. John offered Sherlock the nippie, pressing it to the boy's lips.
Sherlock looked more than a bit anxious at the question.
The complaining began as soon as the dropper was out. There was a lengthy string of agitated whining and grunting, punctuated by little "bleh" noises whenever Sherlock attempted to wipe the taste off his tongue with a mitten.
In many ways, Sherlock's toddler headspace was more difficult than his very little baby headspace. The detective often bounced freely between the two, blurring the lines. Today, he was more toddler-ey.
The bee had become terribly faded, and this was only its second time through the wash since they'd bought it.
Working ficlet title: I Was Gonna Use My Phone, But Then I Got High
Sherlock jumped when he was snapped out of his thoughts. John, satisfied, took his own seat. Sherlock shifted to hands and knees, paused, and stood. He joined John without another word. They ate in silence, John graciously recognising that Sherlock needed time to pull his thoughts together.
Then, nodding to the door, John said, “I‘m going to let you sleep, alright? I‘ll be just out in the living room if you need me.”
John explained to him gently, "All those drugs you took aren't good for you, and you knew that. Daddy's going to take care of you, but those drugs are still going to make you feel sick for a couple of days. That wasn't a good decision you made."
Mrs. Hudson: Oh dear. I hope they're using a safeword.
John relented, tossing the plastic packet beside Sherlock's bowl and sitting across from him. He gestured with his own soupspoon and said simply, "Go ahead while it's still hot."
Setting the bottle aside, John picked up a squeeze pouch of ready-made baby food and twisted the cap off. He took it back to the cot and reached easily over the ECG leads to offer the mush to Sherlock.
He swore he stopped breathing when John adjusted his grip on the guard and eased it toward Sherlock's mouth. He felt the nipple touch his lips, and they parted for John.
He quickly turned his head aside when John tried to put the dropper to his mouth, refusing to open up for it.
Baby steps... It would be a while before he returned with their clothes.
baby.
The detective looked so vulnerable.
For some reason, behind his fierce protectiveness, suspicion also rose in John's chest like a suffocating breath of noxious gas. He was quick to demand, "Yeah? Was that before or after you came in here?"
Unbeknownst to the bewildered baby, the eyedrops weren't anything special; just standard lubricating drops to help combat the dry winter air the building's heating system was recirculating.
Then, more than loud enough to be heard across the room, was the sound of Sherlock's stomach rumbling in acceptance of his recent meal.
"Oh," Sherlock breathed when he realised what it meant. He bent down, picked up his dressing gown, and went on tiptoes to hang it onto the hook on the back of the door so it would stay relatively clean and he could wear it again after his bath.
They're taking Adler's midget to Isengard!
No sooner had John the monitor running and emitting a soft, steady, repetitive beeping in time with Sherlock's heart, he caught Sherlock trying to remove the electrodes, rubbing agitatedly at his chest with the clumsy mittens.
John smirked when Sherlock relaxed and started snoring. The laundry finished, he went to put Mrs. Hudson's basket back in its place and to putz around on his blog until he deemed it time to wake his darling little rascal.
Crying and fussing, Sherlock tried to latch onto the couch in spite of John wrapped around him from behind, struggling to pin the younger man to the floor.
It was Martin's hand that tucked Benedict's wee-wee behind the pee shield. Ben wiggled his bum happily, smiling softly with gratitude for how the extra gesture of care reinforced his Little headspace.
Sherlock hated that he secretly craved to be hugged and coddled and... loved.
Sherlock opened his eyes, such relief and gratitude shining in their depths that John leaned in and kissed him again as he pulled the blankets back up to Sherlock's bony shoulders.
"... Fine."
Please comment if you liked!
Thankfully, John found no such mark. Still instinctively suspicious, but now feeling a bit sheepish for his paranoia, he silently vowed to keep a closer eye on both Mary and Sherlock, for the latter's sake.
to go out?" John said, puzzled, "It looks to me like you've been bored all week."
(Sherlock had tried once, with heavy-duty packaging tape, and John had needed scissors to get him out.)
We later figured out I first cracked the tooth on a tough, dry, whole seed embedded in some grown-up biscuit Daddy gave me as a substitute teething rusk. It only began hurting once I tried to chew later during lunch... and it was excruciating until a corner of the tooth finally just chipped off completely, in the evening, which relieved the striking pressure. So dinner wasn't as much of a problem.
John glanced over his shoulder at Sherlock's thankfully dry trousers. The input side of all this was why Sherlock was wearing pull-ups this week in the first place. The case/post-case starvation/binge cycle had, on multiple occasions now, led to minor but uncontrollable bouts of diarrhoea for the detective, making disposable diapers or pull-ups an occasionally necessary safety measure in order to save Sherlock's collection of actual adult underpants from depletion.
The doctor drifted off to sleep thinking they'd have to do this again sometime, when Sherlock was feeling better.
Immensely annoyed and groggy, he lifted his head and squinted along the form lumped under the blankets next to him. He could just make out the source of the movement in the dark.
Ignoring him, John and Mary set to work on his body. Dallying meant valuable minutes wasted, and it was in the best interest of Sherlock's health to get him back inside the incubator as soon as possible.
"Have I been a good boy today, Daddy?" Sherlock asked shyly as they approached a steep uphill bit.
Coming 'round to where he could face John, a pouting - quite nearly crying - Sherlock fidgeted nervously and moaned again, "Mmmmbee?"
All of the wires and tubes trailing off of Sherlock's body were carefully aligned with small access ports as the incubator cover was placed over him.
He didn't bother asking Sherlock to try unbuttoning his shirt in the meantime. For the mental age Sherlock was currently at, that would prove too frustrating an exercise.
Thanks to everyone for having patience with me and sticking around!
The inspector-detective breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark.
Suction increased within the cylinder, pulling the skin of Sherlock's bellybutton outward until his navel appeared to be turned completely inside out. John paid close attention to the graduated markings as Sherlock's newly formed outie passed them and filled the cylinder.
Sherlock made a curious little coo and tried to look around, but reflections in the plexiglass distorted his view of what was outside.
If you haven't run away screaming yet, please comment. <3
A second later, an unpleasant understanding showed in Mary's eyes.
Sherlock poked a finger to his lips, not quite putting it inside, fretting that maybe Daddy was cross with him.
Faded but definite scarring, smooth and white, in broken lines around both wrists, was what had caught her attention.
Sherlock kicked his feet a bit under the table, his littleness going warm and fuzzy at John's concern over him.
Tonight certainly did not help Sherlock's aversion to television any.
"They gave us a couple things of salt crackers. You want some, Sherlock?"
Because he wanted to make John happy. Daddy. John. Not Daddy. Not yet? Sherlock's head started to ache.
"Thank goodness for that," John muttered. Thanks to Sherlock, he knew firsthand what forty-eight hours of total dehydration looked like. Seeing it was just as scary as any written medical description. "Anything else?"
John took note of it and tactfully went straight for the remote control, letting the box fill the awkward void.
Sherlock winced as Mary wiped another stinging antiseptic square inside his navel to clean up the last traces of bleeding from the IV site.
"John?" came the slightly ragged-sounding reply from the other end.
I'm not sure how this entry managed to wind up so full of penis and potty talk. It just... sort of happened. I must live a far more phallic existence than I previously realised.
Sherlock hated inconclusive data.
"Can Daddy put a diaper on you after we get you cleaned up?" John asked sweetly. He was careful to keep any hint of amusement out of his voice, as Sherlock looked like he was contemplating clocking John in the chin.
"Maybe. I guess we can ask him after he's recovered. For now, he doesn't have much choice."
Sherlock ducked his head and fidgeted wordlessly, looking at John with a combination of puppy eyes and guilty pouting.
Without John there to give him further direction, Sherlock stood in the middle of the room sucking on his thumb and glancing about aimlessly while he waited for him to come home. He resisted the toys calling to him from the floor. He needed to be as grown-up as possible when John returned.
, Sherlock... They make actual vibrators for that purpose, you know. Ones that won't get stuck where they're not supposed to. You couldn't just pop around the corner and pick one up?!"
(See the end of the chapter for
(Daddy said I should write that one down before I mentally delete it... again.)
"Oh, John!" she sounded as if she'd been caught off guard. "He's been crying for you."
"Hi," Sherlock echoed flatly.
John was quick to shush him, stroking his hair back in an attempt to soothe him.
Sherlock squirmed a tiny bit, but held his ground. He almost wished he stayed up on the couch so he could try to catch John's reactions. He didn't want to move back up now and draw attention to himself.
Sherlock was appalled how much of his willpower it took not to bawl outright in front of John.
Heeding Mary's advice, he left a towel wrapped over Sherlock's crotch up to the very second the clean nappy went on.
Sherlock was much calmer now and barely batted an eye as Mary entered. She plunked herself down on the couch, the booster seat near her feet. She smelled more of soap and much less of
John all but flung the scalding hot toast onto the plates, and Sherlock shut the pantry without bothering to find the juice, figuring the tea John made was still hot and would suffice.
He tapped his mobile's disconnect button and turned around to peer at the door to Sherlock's room, where he'd shut the unwashed, still residually drugged detective to wait for him and think about what he'd done.
, and rescued the dummy to help Sherlock to latch onto again.
Sherlock sighed and dragged on his dressing gown, then picked his way through the shadows to the door.
Sherlock nodded. Tears choking him up, the best answer he was capable of voicing was nothing more than a squeaky, "Mm-hm," as he started to cry.
"You don't want me to have to lock up your feet too, do you?"
Mary and John studied him. Sherlock looked like cornered prey; stock still, his eyes were wide as if in terror and glued to Mary, his rapid breathing suggesting his heart was nearly beating out of his chest. The hand not in his mouth was clenched into a defensive fist, the entire arm drawn feebly to his chest, along with the immediate raising of his knees, hinting at a desire to curl into a foetal ball.
John ruffled Sherlock's already messy, bedheaded hair and relaxed in the armchair again.
Sherlock made a short, confused noise as he felt Daddy's fingers go up inside him. Sherlock squirmed a bit as his anus twitched around Daddy's fingers. The whole process felt weird, but the part he liked the least was the temperature of the gel coating the outside of his sphincter.
(See the end of the chapter for
John bare-chested and Sherlock bare-bottomed, they were an odd sight creeping down the hall.
Sherlock sniffled wetly and whined, "You're mean."
John injected air and a bit more lubricant into the cylinder through a valve at the top, easing the pressure so that he could, again slowly, press the plunger back down until Sherlock's navel popped free. When it did, it remained firmly clamped as a very pronounced outie.
Now that it's gotten cold out, Daddy hasn't been too keen on walks through the park. I want to go, though. We haven't been since a few months ago, what with cases and all. That last time, we went when it wasn't very busy and got to see a number of animals, including a couple of toads. The first one was very tiny, and the second was full grown. After some persuading, Daddy agreed I was a good boy for not killing the bigger toad while I was poking at it with sticks. Daddy says I scared the toad a lot and shouldn't really poke at them at all, but I was careful not to harm it. We visited the swingset too, which is normally my favourite, but recently I can't swing as high as I used to because I get a touch of vertigo. Daddy says it's because I don't sleep enough or finish my vegetables. Daddy also pointed out that hanging upside down from the swing for a long time doesn't help either.
He couldn't lose his baby again. He couldn't lose his little Sherlock.
Still somewhat under the sway of the substance that I took but will not reveal here, in the cab I regaled Daddy with a mostly hummed rendition of Eleanor Rigby, which, when I sing it, begins with the line, "ah, look at all the stupid people." I prefer the lyrics to be relevant.
"I know," Daddy said patiently, "but it makes toads very scared when they see something much bigger than they are hovering over them. They think they're in danger because the bigger animal wants to eat them."
He drifted in this simplest state of being, knowing Daddy was near and everything was right with the world. Time did not matter. He stopped sensing it. He lay sprawled there for aeons.
He returned with a pacifier that was, like the baby seat, sized up to accommodate the fact that, no matter how infantile Sherlock's mindset currently was, physically he wasn't all that little.
In case anyone was wondering: yes, le auteur really did break a window putting a bed frame together. Not enough floor space to work with, and a coat tree ended up tipping into the window. Twice. It was the second hit that did it.
"God, why did I ever listen to you..." John whispered down at Sherlock. It was at the poor, injured baby's insistence, months ago, that John had reconsidered kicking his significant two-faced assassin to the kerb.
Waking up to yet another morning of the previous night's crying-induced congestion was the least of Sherlock's concerns.
Sherlock stared up at her, looking utterly bewildered. Mary was technically a Stranger to him in Little-space. He wasn't sure it was even okay to talk to her. He looked over to Daddy for guidance.
I has therefore deduced that Rice Crispies are made of processed fruit flies. o.o
When they got Sherlock home to Baker Street, the first thing they did was launch into the much-needed discussion that hadn't felt right to have in front of the driver. They set a shaky Sherlock down on the sofa, just to watch him dazedly slide himself down to the floor a minute later.
To save Sherlock from having to think directly about taking precautions against John or Missus Hudson running into him with the incriminating item in his mouth, Daddy rationalised for him, "Let's leave your nippy-nip in here so it doesn't fall in the toilet or anything, yeah?"
“Give it here,” he says, and snatches the bottle up next. He shoves the nipple towards her mouth, and she startles, kicking and wriggling before finally giving in and beginning to drink. Immediately, her eyes go half-lidded and she falls still and quiet. “There. Good.”
, Sherlock thought. Another circle of his hips, this one rougher, grinding his arse against the plug, and his prick gave a little jerk and began to ache. It would be so easy to pull himself off. One hand holding the tail in place, the other wrapped around his cock, and all he’d have to do would be to thrust between the two.
shameless tart and make you get on your knees and beg for my cock.”
“Sorry. It really isn’t a problem though. It’s fine, it’s… good. Thanks for telling me.”
Fair enough. It doesn’t bother you does it, the names?
“Come on,” John murmurs, petting Sherlock’s hair until he opens his eyes again, staring up into John’s. “Don’t let your brother ruin this. You haven’t even got my vest off yet.”
Sherlock,
“Mmm,” John said. Sherlock could feel his vocal folds vibrating. “Mmm that’s good.”
Sherlock does want. He wants any hurt that John will give him. Bites, bruises, even cuts—scars, permanence. Like the bullet wound in Sherlock’s chest, still visible long after Mary has gone.
It would be better when he was in front of the fire and under a quilt, sharing body heat with John. Just the idea—John huddling close, his back to Sherlock, his bottom against Sherlock’s crotch, John frotting back against the length of Sherlock’s cock—had Sherlock closing his eyes and gripping the sink for self-control.
That he knew he needn’t bother with Sherlock was… Sherlock didn’t have words for it. It was the moment when he stopped thinking in notes and chords and started feeling the music swelling in his intestines, lungs, throat, at the same time that he heard it rise from the violin strings beneath his fingers.
Sherlock actually turned his nose up a bit at that. “People are idiots. Never listen to them if you can help it; they rarely have anything worthwhile to say.”
“That I forget everything except you, and myself. I want—”
Sherlock doesn’t mean to say it. Well, he does, but not so straightforwardly. He is trying to decide how to take it back without actually
With something akin to a snarl, John grabs the hair at the top of Sherlock’s head and
would be
Through a series of trials and errors (Sherlock grunting when John got it right and huffing impatiently when John got it wrong), John discovered that what she really meant was
“Of course,” Sherlock answers.
Then John’s mind quickly grows hazy under the ache of being stuffed full, and he simply bites his lip and lets himself be bred.
Sherlock shook her head hard enough that her curls flew. “Lie on me.”
I thought I might fend off the baddies while you do the gathering supplies and building bits. :)
It would be even nicer, Sherlock thought, when it was bare.
dissolved in Sherlock’s mind like flesh in acid.
His thumb hovered over the send button, and after a long moment of consideration, he added a little more.
“Sherlock, what have you done?” Mrs Hudson said, standing in the open door of her flat.
“I think I’m right,” John said eventually, “in saying you meant for me to find you like this, yeah?”
Suddenly, he felt compelled to say, “I didn’t mean it. About your blog, the writing… any of it.”
“Ugh!” Sherlock threw himself backwards so hard his chair rocked. “Not the e. You know I can’t stand the e.”
Sherlock returned quickly, carrying a folder, thick with papers, which he dropped onto the floor near John’s feet. Unbuttoning his jacket, he knelt down and began to spread the folder’s contents across the carpet.
John’s smirk widened to a smile. “Thought so. I was thinking about it this morning, how odd you’ve been lately, and realised you haven’t exactly been subtle. Sorry I’m a bit dim. I didn’t—”
I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m doing.
“Probably, yeah. Still, it’s a bit rude to leave everything to me after I just ‘one-shotted’ the boss for you.”
Thankfully, John makes up for any inconvenience by pulling Sherlock’s hair so hard that his scalp aches for hours.
“She’s obviously tired of enduring the same dull, tedious,
It won’t be long now, he knows. It never is, during the full moon.
It was the last thing Sherlock wanted to do. She closed her eyes, fighting a flinch, and said nothing, although of course John wouldn’t have it. She was worse than Sherlock, sometimes, when she got a sniff of something interesting; like a bloodhound, she couldn’t be swayed, and she never forgot.
As for what was rotting on the kitchen table, your first thought wasn’t far off. I was comparing the dehydration and visible shrinkage of male and female fingers after death, which required a set of fingers from both male and female corpses. Fortunately, I was able to get some data before I was forced to dispose of them.
“Well,” she said wryly. “Good night to you too. You confusing git.”
, he thought, half-delirious.
With a sigh, he gave up trying and stood. John was in the kitchen, seated at the table. He held a full piece of jammy toast between his teeth as he sorted through the pages of yesterday’s
Just the thought of it makes him dizzy and shivery. Makes him want to still his hips and stop John’s hands and simply lie against John’s chest, listening to John’s heart churn like the perfect machine it is and savouring the scratches’ sting like a nicotine addict puffing the last dredges of his last cigarette—
John insists on checking his cuts every night, but he does so with the clinical dispassion of a GP, not the awed and worshipful manner from after Sherlock’s spanking—even though the cuts become gloriously red and puffed-up, like claw marks. (Sherlock spends an entire morning in the bathroom admiring them in the mirror, envisioning John on his knees before him, kissing and licking at them and staring up at Sherlock with a reverent, adoring expression.)
It was only after John watched from the window as Sherlock drove off in a cab that he understood what Sherlock had been trying to tell him.
If you’ve just received an email from me, delete it immediately. It was sent to you by mistake and contains highly sensitive information.
He heard nothing from SH for days, during which time John grew unnaturally attached to Harry’s old phone. He checked it hourly, took it with him to the loo, and plugged the charger in to a socket closer to his bed, so he could hear more easily if it buzzed during the night.
John did sigh then, and slumped low. This was shaping up to be a long session, he thought.
“No.” There was steel in John’s voice, which he hardened even further until it was nearer to titanium. “Absolutely not.”
He spent a lot of time in his Mind Palace. The Good Mind Palace, as John called it, differentiating it from the times Sherlock had retreated into his own head for a long drug-induced hallucination. The sheer number of arguments that had begun with John pausing beside him and saying,
“Okay. In that case, let’s just say if either of us loses interest, wants to stop, gets overwhelmed, and so on, we can say ‘no’ or ‘stop’ or ‘hydrochloric’ or… or anything that isn’t ‘yes please,’ really. And we pause regularly to check in with each other. All right?”
“A load of stuff I thought was complete rot until now. Although, to be fair, I suppose I was reacting more to his tone than what he was saying. He talked about you like you were some sort of child, or maybe an overly eager puppy, which pissed me right off, and the words ‘hopeless’ and ‘naïve’ got thrown about too much for my liking. So I didn’t pay him much attention at first.”
Would Sherlock mind? Hard to say for certain. Some days, for instance, Sherlock thought it perfectly acceptable to barge in and out of the loo while John was using it, and other days, John accidentally leaving the door cracked just a hair while he had a piss put Sherlock in a snit for hours.
John turned, giggling. “Did you know you’re slurring a bit?”
“Me? What am I doing?”
And sure enough, after a brief pause, John nodded.
John’s snort became a chuckle, which grew into another full-bellied laugh. Sherlock was a madman, a brilliant gorgeous madman, and John was so far gone over him it probably made him mad as well. Mad and an idiot, although apparently not a complete idiot.
“Oh. Yeah. Well. [chuckling] A hyper-sexual gamer isn’t exactly the sort of person I want to come off as, you know?”
. He stopped feeling his limbs ages ago, and the skin on his neck and his belly are on fire, rubbed raw by the straps of the breeding stand despite the soft lining of rabbit fur.
His hips rock forwards, trying to thrust his cock into John’s slippery grasp, but John wrenches his hair in rebuke and presses his mouth to Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock can feel John’s teeth against his skin when he growls, “Don’t you dare. After all the teasing you’ve done, standing here shaking that pretty arse at me. You’ll stay right here and fucking
And he’d considered it before he’d done it. Of course he had. Anal penetration with a sex toy required foresight. John had cleaned himself, cleaned the toy… and to do that, of course, he must’ve sneaked the toy downstairs and washed it in the loo.
Which was lovely. John stopped being able to return the kiss just as soon as she’d started it, and just stood with her head tipped back, gasping and rocking into Sherlock’s hand as Sherlock brushed her lips again and again against John’s slackened mouth.
When John was as unclothed as Sherlock—albeit with a bra beneath her own shirt—she climbed on the bed and straddled Sherlock’s knees, staring down and admiring the long lines of Sherlock’s body. With her arms stretched above her head, her wrists cuffed to John’s old and flimsy wooden headboard, Sherlock’s shirt had ridden up, exposing her navel and her hipbones. The skin was smooth and pale, aside from a long-faded knife wound going diagonally across her right hip that she’d had as long as John had known her.
It was Martha Hudson’s—Mrs Hudson to most who knew her, although she hadn’t actually been a Mrs for years and didn’t miss the late Mr Hudson overly much—new tenants who put the idea in her head.
But Mrs Hudson paid him no mind as she retreated hastily into what John assumed was her own flat, shutting the door firmly behind her. Immediately, Sherlock was taking her place in the entrance. In addition to being more attractive, he was taller than John had imagined, and also a great deal more excitable. He was practically vibrating where he stood, breathing quickly as though he had sprinted a great distance, and his eyes were wide and manic behind the bulky plastic glasses.
“That stopped being amusing about four years ago, you know.”
The rest of dinner was largely uneventful, marked by long, surprisingly unawkward silences and Sherlock fidgeting ceaselessly in his chair. Occasionally, his knee would knock against John’s beneath the table, and once or twice he trod quite painfully on John’s foot. Each time, he apologised profusely, his cheeks flushing pink and his eyes growing wide as saucers.
(Although he did, on a whim while he was humping into the tight channel, slow his strokes and utter a hesitant “Daddy” just to see what would happen.
John nearly goggled. “Where would I be? It’s four in the morning!”
that John is neither romantically nor sexually available. Sherlock mentally relives his and John’s time in the queue. Sherlock ordering and paying for John, John standing closer to Sherlock than is socially acceptable for just friends, John’s body angled in Sherlock’s direction.
“No! No, of course not. Sorry, you just caught me off guard. I suppose I just assumed—”
Sherlock humped the bed so hard that the sheets slid straight off the mattress.
8:40 p.m.
I haven’t been gaming much either. I tried to play Caranguard earlier tonight, but I couldn’t remember what I’d been doing the last time I played except that I was in a cave and in the middle of the quest. Kept dying too. Eventually I just turned it off.
John was surprised, but pleasantly. “Thank you.”
bruised you this badly. I wasn’t paying attention and got carried away. That’s… that’s not good, Sherlock. If we’re going to play with biting and pain, then me not paying attention to how hard I’m biting is very, very not good.”
Still: John in his bed, John’s things mixed in with his own, John calling him “love,” John’s marks on his hip.
“There’s the whole rest of my neck to bite too. And my shoulders, my back… might have to experiment a bit to see what I like, but my whole body is more or less yours.”
The words were muffled, but John could feel the rumble of them against his skin. His relief—sharp and sweet—was eclipsed by his awareness of Sherlock’s mouth trailing lower, licking the lower curve of John’s back before drifting even lower still: skimming John’s tailbone.
whilst Sherlock wasted away from boredom.
“All right. Well... I was thinking the other day about what you said, about knowing that you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped. I reckon that means you knew, yeah? You knew that Victor, erm, had a problem?”
“You….” John licked his lips. Sherlock’s eyes followed the quick motion, then blinked rapidly and looked away. “Sorry, you told your brother about me?”
And with an opening like that, how could John resist? “Does that make you my Uncle Mycroft?” he asked, perfectly deadpan. “Or would you prefer Uncle Mike?”
JohnHWatson: Did you have something in mind?
“There we go,” said John. “That’s fine. Here.” He reached towards Sherlock’s armchair and grasped the rubber ball, which had rolled from the arm to the seat. “Want to play?”
Mycroft rocked back on his heels, looking amused. “No more so than you are by your father’s alcoholism, I’d wager. It was traumatic, of course, and you still bear the mental scars… but it was never him you thought of when you would stare down the barrel of your gun, was it?”
At that point, he simply lies down where he is, which is in the hallway just outside the door to the loo, and rolls onto his side. John follows him, kneeling down and then sitting cross-legged just beside Sherlock’s head.
He revised his text and hit the button to send it before he could change his mind.
The corner of John’s lips twitched and then quirked into a smirk. “That one’s a little easier. The way you’ll get an idea in your stupidly brilliant brain and just throw yourself into it without giving a single thought about anyone else.”
He was carrying the laundry basket one-handed through the living room, towards Rosie’s bedroom, when he paused near the telly. “Is this the remote?”
John didn’t doubt that. No one really liked to have their weaknesses and secrets exposed. Still, he couldn’t help but ask:
,” John was saying. He sounded awed. Sherlock blinked the urine from his eyelashes to find that John looked it as well: wide-eyed, spellbound, like Sherlock was just as amazing when he was a piss-soaked dog as when he was a celebrated genius and detective. “Look at you. Such a good puppy. Good, beautifulSherlock. Come here.”
Ah. That sounded promising.
Not really sure what it says about me that I find your answer charming, but there you go. :)
It seemed hours had passed before Sherlock had had his fill of the fantasy, and even then he slipped it back beneath the floorboard with reluctance, stroking it once, tenderly, before he hid it away again.
That got him a huff of laughter from Sherlock which in turn made John grin, pleased with himself.
A cabbie, a choice of two pills, a mysterious shooter who had fled the scene.
“Yoo-hoo!” Mrs Hudson called. “Thought I’d bring you up some tea.”
And yet John couldn’t help but notice that she made no attempt to either rub against John’s clit or breach John’s entrance. Instead, her fingertip traced featherlight round the sensitive rim of John’s hole.
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson.”
“Armchair in the sitting room. Yours, in fact.”
Sherlock rather wants to snap something in response, something that will hopefully communicate how very much he does not care where or how or what, just as long as John is the one to do it.
To his surprise, he found a new email from PayPal in his inbox. Sherlock had sent him £1100 and a message.
Not when it had been inside John.
What would he be like, when his partner penetrated him? Would he consent to be moved about, his limbs arranged and rearranged, soft and pliant and submissive? Or would he snipe and scoff and bark orders, bossy and difficult and headstrong? Possibly (probably) he would be both, depending on his mood.
“Stopped,” Sherlock said. “Nobody getting in, and nobody getting out.”
John shouldn’t have. He knew that he shouldn’t have, and still, he snapped a photo with his free hand and sent it to Sherlock.
Sherlock got over there and knelt down, only to pause.
—but was stopped. An itching-burning at his wrists and ankles, the creaking of wood and clanking of metal striking metal.
He can’t be serious, and yet he is.
Sherlock nodded frantically, then gestured towards the bedside table, where John saw that three bottles of different lubes had been set in a neat row. “I have oil-, silicone-, and water-based lubricants. I wasn’t sure which you preferred.”
No that’s a lie. What I want most is you beneath me grabbing at my shoulders arching up into me your legs around my waist and begging for it. The ‘it’ changes daily. Your come on my face or your cock in my hole, either hole, or your mouth against mine as you rut against my thigh. Maybe several things at once. Maybe your arse so tight and slick around me while you scratch my back so hard it looks like I’ve been mauled and you swear at me, you growl at me, you tell me how hard and how fast you need to be fucked while I’.//
I’ll be there. If Mrs Hudson isn’t there I’ll just make myself at home on the doorstep.
“Perhaps it’s fortunate he’ll never see you like this,” Mycroft says. He’s sat on the bed now, watching the proceedings dispassionately. “The depth of your desperation would alarm him, no doubt.”
His bedsit was silent and orderly, so different to the cluttered chaos of Sherlock’s flat. So much more dull.
Sherlock has adored John Watson ever since. His short doctor-soldier, his blogger, his conductor of light, his best friend and flatmate and partner, his anchor and anti-noise. His everything.
She reasoned that John hadn’t minded her possessiveness earlier, had perhaps even enjoyed it. The neurochemical rush wouldn’t have completely faded yet, so Sherlock still had time to get her fill of it.
, Sherlock thought.
That morning, Mrs Hudson catches sight of the latter while John is in the shower and shakes her head, clucking her tongue as though in disapproval.
“Apologies,” Sherlock murmured. “I only—”
looping around and around his mind—but John stopped him with a hand in the small of his back.
“Fuck,” John said, low and dangerous. “Look at you.”
“I don’t care if you’re
“Okay, that might’ve come off a way I didn’t mean it to, sorry. But you know what I mean.”
Her hands slid down John’s waist, lingered at the widest part of John’s hips, then cupped John’s arse cheeks, squeezing them, lifting up and then letting go, making them jiggle. John had an urge to giggle and squirm, although she fended it off and instead pushed her bottom back even more, grinding it into Sherlock’s lap.
Mrs Hudson’s wandering gaze landed on the pink lady’s suitcase, and she cut John off with a delighted gasp. “Oh! Are you moving in?”
If you did, Angelo’s would never have happened.
Sherlock had stared, his eyes going narrowed and squinty. He’d always been able to tell when John was enjoying something at his expense, and he’d always hated it.
John doubted that very much. Everything he’d seen of Sherlock suggested he was very much the type of person who always dashed about. “He’s not?”
There’s a faded scar on John’s left ankle: a pale two-centimetre-long sliver where it appears the top layer was stripped from his skin. “Harry dared me to shave my legs when I was about eight,” John says when Sherlock asks. “Pressed too hard and shaved off a bit of skin. An awful mess, that was.”
“But if he hadn’t done,” said Molly. “I mean… well. Have you considered getting another cat? Maybe one whose personality suits Sherlock a bit more?”
Sherlock mentally reviews his behaviour over the last few days. It could, he supposes, perhaps be considered distant, but… he’s sure that he was only responding to John. That John withdrew, became hesitant and stiff—
During his next therapy appointment, all Ella wanted to talk about was Sherlock.
He felt hopelessly clumsy, trying to move briskly but only succeeding in plodding awkwardly. The kitchen lino was cold and hard beneath him, and the collar bobbed and pressed into his clavicles with every movement. Then he reached the ball, and the awkwardness worsened as he lowered his shoulders and tried to pick it up with his teeth. He failed the first time, knocking it with his chin and sending it rolling away. But on the second attempt, he succeeded in clamping his teeth firmly around the rubber and lifting it.
Differently than Sherlock had tied himself, though. Sherlock’s wrists he bound together, then attached to the headboard so Sherlock’s arms were stretched above his head. Next, he bent Sherlock’s knees, shoved them up by his chest, and tied each ankle to each thigh. Not quite as uncomfortable as stringing a rope from the headboard to each ankle, as Sherlock had done, yet it still tilted his hips up and bared his arsehole, which was dark pink and faintly puffy from the fucking it had already received.
It was a bit difficult, though, when Sherlock seemed intent on staring directly at John like there was no one else in the whole fucking world and never would be, and as a result, everyone else took to slanting wary glances at him and shuffling not-so-subtly farther away.
Sherlock kissed him again, gripping John’s hips and trying—clumsily, John thought and giggled into Sherlock’s mouth—to lift him so their heads were at the same height. John went to his toes, stretched his body as long as possible, and felt Sherlock shudder and moan into his mouth before pulling away.
It wasn’t the end of it.
“Shall we give it a go?” Mrs Hudson asked John, and at the sound of her voice, his little ginger head popped immediately out of the bag.
When he was undressed, he picked up Harry’s old phone again and said, “All right. Done,” just as the BlackBerry, still on the bed where he’d abandoned it, chimed.
John withdrew, leaving Sherlock bereft and confused. His hole clenched, mourning the loss.
But he said nothing. John’s nails pressed harder, no doubt leaving raised red marks on Sherlock’s shoulder. John probably thought he was being subtle—that Sherlock didn’t hear the invitation as loudly and clearly as if John had shouted it.
‘Overdramatic knob’ is an understatement. He has an entire collection of long umbrellas, and he carries one everywhere he goes, no matter the weather, tapping the metal tip on the floor and occasionally swinging it round as he walks because he thinks it makes him look stylish and intimidating. He’s insufferable, and I have to interact with him far too much for my liking.
A voice from the right towards the doorway, beyond the frame of Sherlock’s vision: “Four incidents of oral sex in exchange for cocaine is hardly a wealth of experience, brother mine.”
“Your proposal?” John managed, and Mycroft’s answering smile was dripping with condescension.
He traces organs with his fingertip until his eyelids begin to droop, and then he finds himself thinking muzzily of John cutting him open and carving
You’re sure?
“He travels a lot, yes,” Sherlock said, before John could say a word. He sounded excited, almost giddy. John could easily picture him fidgeting, squirming in one of the armchairs in his flat and bouncing his knee, grinning so widely that the corner of his eyes crinkled. “Both within the country and worldwide. For, hm…
favours. No. Six favours to be called in later, four little errands that he made up on the spot to keep me busy for an afternoon.”
Sherlock stilled his hand, letting John rock onto his forefinger as he pleased. Every time he took the full length of Sherlock’s finger, John’s pelvis made a little sliding motion, rubbing the rim of his arsehole against the texture of Sherlock’s knuckles. Just like Sherlock had deduced: it was the external sensation John enjoyed.
“Around here, I think.” John rubs at the join between his neck and his right shoulder, then makes an arc across the top of his chest to rub at the same spot on his left side. “Easier to hide. You might like to show yours off, but some of my patients wouldn’t be too keen on their GP showing up to work with a mess of hickeys.”
Mrs Hudson carries on talking, something about “relieved that’s all sorted” and “glad you’re finally happy,” but Sherlock ignores her in favour of recalling the details of John’s wedding. Standing beside John for pictures, sitting next to John at the reception, playing his waltz for John.
He stumbled forwards, plastered himself to John’s bare back, and—
“I don’t have breasts,” Sherlock announced at breakfast one morning.
There are also dozens of other tiny, barely noticeable scars that John is apparently ignorant of. Sherlock pokes at a miniscule patch of discoloured skin behind his knee, on the top of his foot, just below his ribcage, and John shrugs, utterly unconcerned, and says, “Dunno. Could’ve been anything, really.”
, was intense. He felt impaled, stuffed, and completely fucking triumphant.
He gripped the back of Sherlock’s head, stopped it from bobbing and just held it in place, so that Sherlock’s lips were stretched wide around the root and his nose was deep in John’s pubic hair. Sherlock breathed through his nose and swallowed, tried not to gag and largely failed, and fucking loved it. How he was drooling all over himself, how his eyes began to sting and water, how
After putting Rosie to bed every night, he shut himself in the bedroom although he was wide awake, jittery. He lay on top of the duvet with the baby monitor and his phone. Googling paranormal phenomena. Rereading old blog entries. Talking himself out of texting Sherlock and confessing it all.
The ringing stopped. John’s pulse roared in his ears.
JohnHWatson: :P
His embarrassment is utterly unwarranted—even though he was mistaken, he’s just given Sherlock an idea.
John replaced the phone in his pocket and tried to wipe the stupid grin from his face.
“Because you’re my child.” Sherlock sounded only slightly more composed than John. His hips gave a little stuttering thrust, pushing his cock forwards. John’s hole burned as the tip began to press inside.
Sherlock let go and pulled back with a sound somewhere between a growl and a scoff. “You’re not slick enough,” he said, reaching for the bottle of lubricant. “Did you see the toy? It doesn’t taper like a plug and it’s thickest at the tip. You’re going to hurt yourself.”
So if Sherlock cocks up or John responds poorly, there will be no lasting damage to their friendship. Sherlock is actually quite confident of this.
What was the harm in going along with this, just a bit?
“Mm. I always thought there was something between you two, you know. From the moment I saw him, I knew he’d be good for you. But then there was Mary and the wedding….”
, the footsteps receded and the loo door opened. The moment it closed, John was shaking Sherlock’s hand off and sucking in one heaving breath after another, filling the silent room with the echoing sounds of her own panting.
Mrs Hudson gave John a smile that was full of apology: the sort of ‘Please don’t mind him!’ look that a mum might give someone about her unruly son. “Look at him, dashing about. He’s usually not like this.”
11:31 a.m.
Apologies for the delay. My landlady’s made herself something of a nuisance since I got back.
“Besides,” John said, speaking loudly over Sherlock, “I think you’ll like the opportunity to be a good boy for me, won’t you?”
Sherlock wriggled his bum, making his tail wag and his collar jingle. He knew he made a tempting sight when he was plugged and collared; John had told him so many, many times.
, and her lips formed a near-perfect O as she lowered her chin again, looking as though her very mind had shattered and left her completely wrecked.
It was worse than being naked. Hours ago he had berated Sherlock for buying him things, and here he was wearing yet another bit of clothing that Sherlock had bought him. Brilliant. How many mixed signals could John send in 24 hours?
Never let it be said that John Watson couldn’t be as clever as Sherlock Holmes—or as manipulative.
That was one of the many benefits of John’s body, its ability to orgasm multiple times. It was a rarity that Sherlock’s could even manage one, but having John—eating her until Sherlock’s fraenulum linguae felt knotted and sore, fingering her until Sherlock’s wrists were cramped and trembling, giving her a solid surface to rut against until Sherlock’s skin was reddened and burned from the friction—more than made up for it.
Just as Mrs Hudson is often underfoot, so occasionally is Molly. She comes round at seemingly random times, although she insists “I told you I’d be by today. Don’t you remember?” Sherlock doesn’t, but she’s never an unwelcome addition to the flat.
No matter. It’s hardly her opinion Sherlock is concerned with.
“Good, good kitty,” John was murmuring, stroking Sherlock’s face with his free hand. Whimpering, Sherlock raised his chin and nuzzled John’s palm. “Oh, you lovely thing. My brilliant, perfect pet.” A firm, slow drag of his fingertips over Sherlock’s prostate, and Sherlock’s whole body shook as he whined, feeling his prick pulse and leak a fat dribble of precome. “That’s it. Make a mess of my jeans. Now everyone who looks at me will know what a needy kitty I’ve got.”
Sherlock’s adam’s apple bobbed, and he inclined his head. His erection, John noticed, hadn’t diminished at all. John spared a moment to curl his fingers around it and followed the thickest vein up the underside with his thumb, stopping at the fraenulum to trace feather-light circles over the sensitive skin there. Sherlock jerked against the ropes with a startled whimper, and his cock grew even harder in John’s hand.
Sherlock’s smile widened. John was momentarily distracted by the little wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. “Precisely. From there it was easy to narrow down the websites that Kenny frequented.”
“Hmm,” Sherlock murmured, sounding smug and cheeky. “I see.”
“A few hours after his last victim,” Sherlock said, “and now he receives a text that can only be from her. If somebody had just found that phone, they’d ignore a text like that, but the murderer—”
“What’s it like?”
. If Sherlock is selfish, he’ll fare no better than Mary at this rate, in terms of ensuring John’s continued affection.
Then another thought occurred to him.
“Yes. Dead dull so far. Seemingly a tragic accident, but the wife insists her husband was murdered. I’d have refused, but… mm.”
“You’re not even paying attention, are you?”
After ten minutes, Sherlock began to suspect that John wasn’t going to respond. Possibly he had muted his phone or turned it off altogether or—
You’re meeting with a drug dealer who’s killed at least two people, and has enough friends or lackeys or whatever to erase most of the evidence of a car accident? I don’t really like that you say YOU are doing it. Tell me you’ve got police backup. People like that aren’t to be dealt with on your own.
He’d be horrified to know that his son sometimes fancied men. He’d be even more horrified to know that John was contemplating getting into a relationship where he was the submissive partner.
Maybe not so interested in watching, but I’d like to hear about it.
Sherlock feels incandescent. Bitten and bruised, marked, with John standing just behind him, wearing Sherlock’s deodorant, strands of Sherlock’s hair clinging to his coat. Their intimate relationship is as obvious as the sun in the sky and the strong scent of death in the air.
But it had the unintentional effect of trapping his cock, still erect, between his belly and the pillow, while also freeing his flattened tail, which swung and brushed the backs of his thighs and his testicles. Sherlock’s breath caught and his vision went oddly white-edged and hazy.
His grip on Sherlock’s hair loosens enough that Sherlock can do precisely that: using the weight of his body to press the pillow into the mattress and hold it steady while he humps it. It’s not perfect, the feathers still scatter and flinch from the force of his thrusts, but it’s good enough at least that his prick throbs in satisfaction and he lets out a little cry of pleasure at the sensation.
<JohnHWatson> You want to stop playing??
And all for what? One picture that Mrs Hudson could show to Greg and Molly? Guilt swept through her like a winter chill. What a horrible pet owner she was, caring more about herself than her cats.
“Maybe a third one now,” said John. So much for his nervousness, which seemed to have vanished completely now, eclipsed by lust and pleasure.
“Hmm,” said Mrs Hudson thoughtfully. “I wonder.”
Not important. He shoved the phone back in his pocket.
and, erm, you’re looking at me like I’m crackers now, so…. Never mind.”
She kicked away John’s hands—actually kicked them, and felt briefly bad about it, but John only giggled as she let go.
Just the word makes Sherlock swell and shiver. His chest feels as though it will burst.
John. Turn.”
“It’s all right. I’m working on it. And in the meantime, I can be patient. Are you aroused?”
Sherlock didn’t know what he was begging for, but it didn’t matter. He squeezed John’s hands and bent to kiss John’s forehead, although it ruined his rhythm and made his arsehole burn anew. “Anything,” he promised. “Anything, it’s yours.”
John hadn’t done, actually. He just hadn’t argued when SH had assumed that it did. Fortunately, Harry’s old phone did have “a working camera function,” which John had used to take the picture of himself that he’d put up on the fetish site and then not touched again.
John stared at him. “Taunting it with nursery rhymes. That’s your plan?”
with. Fucking Christ, who the hell did Mycroft think John was? Who did
Whoever he thought he’d find on his doorstep—neighbour, probably, or maybe a salesman—it certainly wasn’t Sherlock gazing about like he’d never seen the place before, a duffle slung over one shoulder.
“Yeah? And where are you?”
And that was it. John couldn’t stand it any longer.
It’s so good. He couldn’t have imagined it would be this good. He tries to hold himself still, to be a perfect and well-behaved hole for John to fuck, but he can’t stop squirming, can’t stop his own body from silently begging for it harder. Every push of John’s fat cock into his arsehole is like a tight, slick fist gliding over his own prick.
His voice was gruff in a way Sherlock had never heard before when he asked, “How’s your refractory period?”
So he allowed Sherlock to coax him back into a proper cuddle and shoved all thoughts of Mrs Hudson far, far from his mind, beginning to drift into a contented, post-coital doze.
John could feel Sherlock’s hum in his bollocks and his cock, which gave an interested jerk and began to thicken. Moaning, he hiked one knee higher on the bed, giving Sherlock more room—and then groaned, disappointed, when Sherlock pulled back.
Sherlock acknowledged her with only a tiny dismissive flick of his ear. Then he dipped his head and licked with no small amount of enthusiasm at the corner of John’s jaw. The touch made John shudder partly awake, and he stretched and rolled towards Sherlock, arching so that Sherlock could lick his throat instead.
“...”
“Oi, I don’t particularly appreciate being told I don’t have half a brain. I mean. You can be a bit of a bastard, yeah, but you’re also bloody gorgeous with your hair and your coat and your—your cheekbones. And like I said not two minutes ago, you’re the most interesting person I’ve ever met. So if you honestly think no one could ever care about you, that’s rubbish and you’re an idiot.”
“Okay.” He noticed that Sherlock had taken his suit jacket off, unbuttoned his shirtsleeves, and rolled them up. As John watched, he clenched and unclenched the fist of his left hand, and pressed his right palm firmly into his left forearm. “What are you doing?”
Later. He’d put the box back later, after his shower.
To his pleasant surprise, John chuckles and knocks their shoulders together. “Right. Kind of you to say. You prick.”
John will blame it on the sleep deprivation.
You’re amazing. You’re extraordinary. I’ve never been attracted to a man like I’m attracted to you.
“Christ, just look at you,” John says, sounding awed.
“Sure. A lot of times it’s exciting, but sometimes it’s annoying. And when it’s annoying? It’s really fucking annoying.”
Sherlock glanced up at her and blinked.
“All right. Just give me a mo’. It’s pitch-black out now. A bit harder to navigate even with torches.”
, Sherlock thought feverishly.
Then he actually saw it. The strap was black leather, and the display, which said ‘Monaco Heuer’in little silverish letters, was sleek and smart, with four dials and three buttons on the side. It looked… fragile. Expensive.
“Good boy,” Sherlock said. “Let Daddy hear you.”
Then he realised what exactly he was doing: trying to impress Sherlock, arguably the last person John should’ve been worried about trying to impress. His giggling died suddenly, leaving him uncomfortably aware of Sherlock’s silence and the strangers passing him on the pavement.
Sorry?
Sherlock’s curtains were closed, as always, although thin strips of dim light were peeking out from around them. Sometime before dusk, then, perhaps around dinnertime. Or what would’ve been John’s dinnertime before, anyway.
“I can still take care of you.” Sherlock’s eyes were wide and bright, flitting back and forth between each of John’s. “And I do have money. I can still buy you things. A suit, another jumper, the gold-plated vibrator. Well, perhaps not the vibrator. Not without Mycroft’s help.”
Sherlock’s head snapped up. “A…poltergeist?”
“It’s all right,” John continues. His voice is soft, featherlike, and his fingers toy with Sherlock’s curls. “Just keep this on for a bit, sweetheart.”
Then Sherlock’s paws are gone, and the massive weight is lifted from his back, although Sherlock’s cock stays firmly rooted in him. Not climbing off, then, but giving John the opportunity to sit up and take himself in hand.
From its unremarkable appearance, as well as Sherlock’s comment about not being able to return it, John thought he knew what he would find inside, and opening it confirmed his suspicion. He dumped the contents onto his bed and fetched the BlackBerry to text Sherlock.
That there wasn’t a visible bulge in any of his pockets, nor any other irregularity in the state of his clothes to indicate a ring or ring box in his possession was… interesting. Either he had mastered a method of concealment unknown to Sherlock (unlikely to the point of preposterous) or he had cleverly left it at home to avoid tipping Sherlock off (unlikely but not too far from the realm that Sherlock had come to expect—John could on occasion prove terribly, terribly inventive).
Of course he would make this difficult. Sherlock might’ve known. He sighed, rolling his eyes. “A pint of lager.”
Some hint of his thoughts must’ve shown on his face—oh, who was he kidding, of course they did, this was Sherlock—because Sherlock’s eyes went warm with affection and his lips softened in something like a pout. He wound his arm around John’s shoulders and cradled John against him, his mouth flattening John’s fringe to his forehead. This time when the blood sloshed, a drop or two spilled and dripped down over his fingers.
More paper-flipping. Photos of a dead woman and toxicology screenings were passed over and deposited facedown in a pile. John watched, baffled and dumb-struck. He wasn’t sure what he was meant to be getting from this; it was nothing like the time at Sherlock’s flat. He raised his head, looking quickly around the coffeehouse, and was surprised to find that the other patrons and the barista as well were all staring, mouths agape.
“With humans,” Sherlock continued, eyes opening, “never go for the throat while they’re alive. They expect it. The surprise will give you an edge. And anyway, there’s something… more
“Sorry. Should I not have asked that?”
Sherlock stopped his shepherding, seeming taken aback, and John glanced over his shoulder in time to see Mycroft give Sherlock a sharp, closed-lipped smile that seemed to communicate a dozen things at once, none of them in a language John understood.
He bent his knee experimentally, then bounced on the ball of his foot a few times. There wasn’t even a twinge of discomfort.
The response didn’t come for seven whole minutes, during which John stared stupidly at the photo and imagined all the ways he could make a mess of that man, if Sherlock would still let him.
Right. John shoved the phone and the watch away, taking deep breaths. He’d been right. This had clearly got out of hand. Sherlock was enamoured of him and spending a frankly alarming amount of money on him. He hadn’t met John, didn’t know a thing about John, really, and by accepting it all, John was leading him on. Letting Sherlock think that he was worth it, that what he could offer Sherlock was in any way comparable to the obscene amount of money that Sherlock had spent on him. Nothing that John had done, nor probably would ever do—not the photographs or the texts, not the random bits of conversation—would be enough.
John shook his head. “I’m not buying you another coffee when you haven’t even finished the last one.” Not to mention, the folder of interesting cases wasn’t as interesting as Sherlock obviously hoped it would be.
Sherlock moves John’s clothes from the upstairs bedroom into the downstairs one. In part because he knows John would not appreciate being left to do it all himself, and in part because the idea of John’s belongings continuing to exist so far from Sherlock’s is abhorrent.
“Then stop being a knob and talk to him,” Molly says, so harshly that Sherlock blinks rapidly, taken aback. “If you’ve enough energy to waste on comparing yourself to Mary, you can afford to spend some of it on trying
With effort, Sherlock gathered his wits about him just enough to answer, “Of course not. Your deviancy isn’t my concern.”
“Nothing you’d find morally objectionable. Hopefully,” Sherlock said quickly, which confused John even further. Images of decaying body parts, like the fingers and foot from the photos in Sherlock’s folder, flitted through his mind. “Anyway. The point is, the scarf won’t be the last. Nor, erm, will the next gift, actually. I’ve got—that is, a few weeks ago I bought an item or two that I’ve been holding on to—”
, he thinks, reverent. Yes, he’ll find a case as soon as he’s finished here. John will grin at him, be amazed by him, chase after him: panting and vibrant and
“Okay. Um.... Why don’t you like shotguns? I’m having a whale of a time with mine.”
They really do just want you to be all right in the end, no matter how badly they go about it and how much of an arsehole it makes them.
“Good.” Sherlock’s tone was clipped now, perfunctory. Awkwardness all around, then. Perhaps Sherlock had been thinking with her cunt as well. That was a comforting thought—a bit sexy, too. “You’ll want to sleep now, I assume?”
“Where the hell did you get this?” he wonders.
“So I’ll give it a rub from the side,” John continued, and did just that, slotting her fingertip to the right of her clit and making a slow, gentle circle. That was better. Loads better. John sucked in a sharp breath and had to remind herself to keep talking. “Or the top.” She tried that too, although it wasn’t as good. She didn’t even finish a full circle before she was moving on. “Sometimes the bottom.”
John talked right over him. “Just seems a bit too much of a coincidence, doesn’t it, finding a bunch of websites in my computer history about how to dismantle a heating unit only hours before our central heating breaks.”
What could he possibly be waiting for?
“All right?” John asked.
, perhaps. No matter Mary’s deficiencies as a romantic partner, even she probably never wanted the things that Sherlock wants.
A shudder rolled through Sherlock’s body, and he buried his face in John’s leg with a moan that turned to a happy hum when John laid his hand on the back of Sherlock’s head and scratched.
The flat metal base is nearly the length of John’s full body and twice the width. Two thick metal poles, one a bit taller than the other, protrude from it, and atop each pole is a fur-lined strip of leather with a buckle at one end.
John looked down and all he could focus on was his cock, long and thick, the head peeking out of the foreskin.
Better than trying to put into words the video that implored him to both save John Watson and go to hell, Sherlock supposes. “No,” he says. “Of course not. What good would that do?”
“But you do enjoy it,” Sherlock feels compelled to remind him. “In that sense, it is a kink for you.”
He is, he realises abruptly, perhaps more sleep-deprived than he thought.
And then Sherlock is quite suddenly on his back on the floor, his shoulder blades aching dully, and John is following him, crawling between his bent knees.
What, really? You want me to wait for you alone in your flat?
And suddenly John was keenly aware that he had disappointed Sherlock. Brilliant. The one sodding person in this world who, however misguidedly, thought that John had hung the bloody moon, and even when John wasn’t actively trying to dissuade him, he was proving how very dull and disappointing he was.
“I see the heating’s fixed,” John said.
She wasn’t like John, who was soft and curvy and infinitely more attractive the less she wore. Sherlock might’ve cut an impressive figure in a full suit—and spent a great deal of time in front of the mirror every morning to ensure that she did—but unclothed she was all sharp angles and deathly white skin and wild patches of hair.
“Never done it before. Never really wanted to, to be honest. But I’m not opposed.”
Oh, god, this wasn’t how it was meant to go. Talking of condoms of all things. There was meant to be whispered filth and begging and—and—neediness and breathlessness.
Oh god, he felt brilliant: whorish, but all the more amazing for it.
He had utter faith that John would correctly read the response as a
“God,” John said, sounding blissful. “Oh my fucking god.” He shoved his arse back into Sherlock’s face and wrenched Sherlock’s hair, which hurt so badly that Sherlock could
“Stop,” John heard. “Just—
Is this why Lestrade was so nonchalant about the bite marks on his neck? Has he too spent the last twelve or more months believing Sherlock and John to be in a relationship—so convinced that they have long been romantically involved that he is unmoved by physical, incontrovertible proof of it?
Another wobble in John’s voice, more severe this time. Because here it was. The deepest, ugliest truth he knew.
, he thought.
What do you mean?
Okay...?
He withdrew the dildo—Sherlock grunted in disappointment and looked positively gutted when John tossed it aside—so he could crawl to the edge of the bed and increase the speed of the sex machine. Just a bit, only a couple notches on the dial, but it was enough that Sherlock jolted with a gasp before going limp in his bindings, letting loose a long, whining moan that John couldn’t help but echo.
“For starters, about how you being ‘fine’ is the biggest load of cack I’ve ever heard.”
But even as he’s saying it, he knows it doesn’t make sense. His desires are as foreign and abstract as the Google search results that frustrated him so. And if Sherlock, after all this time, still doesn’t understand them, what hope does John have?
Mycroft’s lips thin. His disapproval is a thick fog Sherlock has to remind himself not to avoid.
There was such a note of finality in Sherlock’s tone that John didn’t doubt he meant it. Or at least that he thought he meant it, although perhaps he’d change his mind if John did leave the shoes to languish.
“I have work.”
Sherlock swallows, and that too—the noise of his throat working—seems unnaturally loud. “Fine. Another.”
, she thought, but didn’t say. John didn’t approve of overt signs of possessiveness, but there was nothing to stop Sherlock from displaying them in the safety of her own mind. Nothing to stop her from watching the silver base of the dildo grow shiny with John’s wetness and thinking,
<JohnHWatson> Anyway, I’m putting a trail of torches down for you to follow when you’re done.
Sherlock gave the door a solid push. It swung shut with a whoosh and a bang.
, was it? Unimportant? Not actually a concern at all?”
John was long gone by the time Sherlock managed to shake himself from his stupor. Then he shot to his feet and bolted towards the stairs.
He had spent a lot of time on the floor then, Sherlock recalled.
To his surprise, Sherlock returned it. John suppressed another shiver. They were a bit uncanny valley, vampires were. There was something just a bit off about them—unless their fangs were out, anyway, and then there was something terribly off about them.
“And then you were amazing. Extraordinary. I went along with all your ridiculous demands because I wanted to see what you would do next. The money, the gifts, I won’t lie: it was nice, once I finally got used to it. But it’s not why I’m here, and it’s not what’s going to keep me here.”
“Nor has the tremor in your left hand made an appearance. And it’s been weeks since you used your walking stick.” Sherlock’s thumbs dipped into the cleft, framing John’s arsehole, and John started with a strangled sound. “You should fire your therapist. I’ve managed to do what she failed to do even after months of work.”
John hesitated, nearly ending the text there and sending it. But that wouldn’t be properly compromising. That wouldn’t be going along with it.
“And… the rest?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock shoved the bag towards him again, more forcefully, and John decided to accept it rather than be punched in the chest with it. Predictably, the bag was cold and wet with condensation, and its contents sloshed a bit.
“Because,” John said, and although he’d meant to remain calm—they weren’t yet past the afterglow, after all—his voice grew louder despite himself, “it’s fucking expensive. How much did that thing even cost? No, don’t tell me that. Never, ever tell me how much it cost. I’m not sure I could handle it. Instead, tell me what the bloody hell we’re going to do with it.”
John put a stop to that as well and fairly plastered himself to Sherlock’s side, narrowly avoiding splashing his cup of blood all over them both.
John wouldn’t stand for homophobia. Not at all.
Sherlock shot him a look conveying how very, very disappointed he was in John for even thinking something so idiotic, much less voicing it. “Do you think someone of your intelligence could hide even a fleeting affair from me, much less one that had progressed to the point of marriage? But that’s not the point.”
Sherlock didn’t appear nearly as alarmed by the tone as John would have liked. In fact, he seemed almost pleased by it. “You’re angry.”
‘You’re cracking,’ he told himself. ‘This man means literally nothing to you. You’re lonely and damaged, and he gave you something to do. What would Ella say if she knew what you were doing?’
“Right, then,” says John. “Back to the left cheek, I think. Ready?”
“Oh god,” Sherlock said, both in his mind and out loud. He’d barely touched himself, had only managed to close one hand around the hard outline of his prick in his trousers and give it a weak jerk, before he was shaking and shoving his knuckles in his mouth to muffle his cry as he came.
John lifted her hips, pushing back into Sherlock’s groin—and oh god, it was good. John’s arse cheeks parted slightly, Sherlock’s vulva cradled between them and squeezed gently. There was a hint of sweet pressure that receded just before it turned to pain.
He must look ridiculous, fully clothed and humping a pillow like a mindless animal, but if John thinks so, he doesn’t let on.
“Are you all right?”
before Sherlock brought John’s newly lubricated hands between his own legs. There was a brush of hair, a ring of tight wrinkled skin against the pad of John’s finger, and then Sherlock’s entire body stretched long with a blissful “Ahhh” as John’s forefinger slipped into his arsehole.
She blew John’s hair away from her mouth and said, “Out of curiosity, what are your thoughts on a harness?”
, Sherlock thinks with fondness. “But never lying.Lying about things of importance, anyway,” he amends. “Her very identity, in this case.”
“Regardless,” said Sherlock, although his heart—his literal heart, not the whatever-it-was in his heart’s general vicinity—was beginning to flutter like a moth against a lightbulb. “You’re hardly my… my
Some part of John expected the waitress at Speedy’s, which was indeed on Baker Street and quite easy to find, to stare blankly at him when he told her, stuttering a bit, that the atomic number of bismuth was 56.
John has relaxed, but his brain is whirling. Sherlock can almost hear the rusted gears creaking. He doesn’t know what John is thinking, and it’s probably best he doesn’t, all things considered.
Sherlock plunged several inches nearer to the floor. John took that as a good sign and let the words spill.
Sherlock as a wolf is also bloody
And though John’s limbs are weak, shaking, and his mind is foggy, his cock is still hard—positively throbbing with neglect and drooling such a steady stream of precome he’s probably filled the plastic piss tray with it by now.
“I don’t give a toss about the game, to be honest. Or the plot, rather. Mostly I just care about talking to you and shooting things.”
. Do you plan to spend the rest of your days lounging about, hanging on my coattails? Hm? Getting in my way, making yourself a nuisance?”
“What the hell are you doing?” John said.
“You’re—awake.”
“Do you know how many adolescent boys have probably built massive cocks in this game? And then there’s you—”
terms, you’re not. And you vampires might have the entire ‘childe’ rubbish—”
Sherlock snorted, adjusting his grip on the porcelain edges of the sink and glancing over his shoulder. “You’re exaggerating.”
‘And you’re happy to take his money and go along with it,’ John thought, suddenly quite disgusted with himself.
John wasted only enough time to shove the eggs and the milk haphazardly into the fridge before he hurried down the hall and threw open the bedroom door.
Secondly, there was already one contact in the address book: Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock scoffed, although it sounded halfhearted. Possibly because he was riveted by John’s mouth: staring like he would go mad if John didn’t let him have it again. “Oh please. I knew you’d understand. I knew you’d come. You saved me even more capably than I intended.”
that you’re interested in? Something you’re curious about, perhaps?”
I didn’t have a poor opinion of your parents to begin with. Sorry if I gave the impression that I did. I realise now it was a bit shit of me to comment on your name like that. Especially since I’ve got such an unoriginal one like John. When I was younger I would’ve been happy to be called something less common. It felt like I was surrounded by Johns in school and it was even worse in the RAMC. I don’t see many younger people called John now, so I assume it’s finally lost its popularity. I suppose William’s about the same. God, I’m just rambling now. The point is, Sherlock’s a fine name and sorry if I was a dick.
“I’m not really an expert. But sure, that sounds right. I can be sunning myself on a rock while you’re behind me building a bloated lizard corpse out of leaves.”
, he thought, and in his mind he could see himself doing it. Wrapping himself around John, pressing their lower bodies together so that John could feel Sherlock’s cock (soft, not-quite-shrivelled from the cold, but with John against him surely that would change?) against his bottom. A grand gesture, leaving John with no doubt about what Sherlock wanted.
“Of course not,” Sherlock said, sounding disgusted, as though the idea were completely absurd. “Just a normal situation in which a body is reduced to ash.”
, he thinks,
Instead, he feels like an elaborate hoax. He wishes he could melt through John’s skin and mould himself against John’s skeleton so that nothing but John could ever touch him again.
“Thank you,” said John. She rolled to face Sherlock and lifted onto one elbow. Her breasts plumped and pressed together; Sherlock tried not to stare, and only partly succeeded. “So…?”
Mycroft swept into the car behind him, and as soon as the door was shut, the car pulled away from the kerb.
“It’s for a
“It doesn’t matter,” Sherlock said. “I’m not asking him if he wants to ‘give it a go.’ What else?”
Then he noticed that Sherlock’s eyelashes had grown wet with tears, and panic wiped all else from his mind.
It wasn’t comfortable. John’s height meant that Sherlock had to simultaneously hunch and stretch, and any thrusting motions she attempted were ruined by John’s incessant
Don’t go through with it, by the way. Even accounting for your knowledge of both firearms and the human body, it’s surprisingly easy to survive a self-inflicted gunshot. Surely you’d agree the possibility of succeeding isn’t worth the risk of failing and having to endure the consequences.
Christ. He stopped that line of thought. He wouldn’t try to calculate the cost. If Sherlock wanted to spend thousands of pounds on John—and he heard the echo of Sherlock’s voice in his head, saying “surprisingly…
With a sigh he rolled over, gathering the covers round himself, and only then, settling back to sleep in the silent room, did he realise it wasn’t a nightmare at all that had woken him.
John kissed his slack mouth. There was a line of tension in his shoulders; Sherlock didn’t even have to see it to know it was there. He could sense it; he could feel it in the way John was holding himself. Not anger or discomfort, there wasn’t the heaviness in the air or the uncomfortable prickle on Sherlock’s skin that he associated with John’s fraying patience.
He cannot let John see. Who knows what John will think?
Sherlock’s scowl deepened. It looked as though he wanted to set the whole lot of it on fire.
Sherlock nearly points out that he didn’t mean to scratch John either, nor did he realise he’d done so until after, so this is really no different. But then the whole of John’s meaning sinks in, and he becomes distracted.
“Well,” she said, “looks like you two have this under control. Back to bed for me, then. Good night.”
<JohnHWatson> I meant your character. Why are you wearing armour if there aren’t enemies?
John recalled one of the women from the North London littles munch calling Sherlock a “right bastard,” how John had thought that he was rude and off-putting when they’d first started texting. That Sherlock seemed now like an entirely different person to the one sat in front of him, the one who had bought John a £3000 watch and wanted to feel as though he was taking care of John so desperately that he got off on being called ‘Daddy.’
<JohnHWatson> All right, my inventory is empty again. Do I just log off like I usually would?
Two more strong rhythmic squeezes of her thighs, and Sherlock was coming too, whimpering around John’s fingers and clutching at John’s hip. The orgasm was small in terms of strength, but it lingered, sending wave after languid wave of pleasure through her until her knees shook and she worried she might literally cry if it went on any longer.
Oh yeah I know. Course he is.
Maybe yeah. I think so anyway. I had a lot of time to think yesterday.
“It’s good.” He sounded choked, as though he was about to be ill. “Thank you.”
John snorted. “Yeah,
Sherlock’s gaze flickered to John’s erection, which was so thick and heavy that it curved downwards, the head making a small wet patch on Sherlock’s sternum. He bit his bottom lip as though the sight actually hurt.
Sherlock feels his hair: still a little unkempt, frizzy, in need of a thorough wash and a comb, but the worst of the knots are gone. He’s impressed, despite himself. Who knew John had such nimble fingers?
in response to Sherlock, and left it at that.
John blinked. “Erm… that there might’ve already been some sort of friction between them?”
Sherlock’s response took a little longer this time to arrive. John fancied he might’ve needed a minute to compose himself, and he grinned, feeling wickedly chuffed with himself.
She traced her thumb along the veins on the top of Sherlock’s foot (a calming sensation that made some of the tension seep from Sherlock’s body), cupped Sherlock’s heel (which made Sherlock feel inexplicably treasured), and dipped her fingertips between Sherlock’s toes (ticklish, which made Sherlock kick again and sparked another giggling fit).
He breathed and tried to centre himself. Remembered the humming, the whisper, the sting and the cold. He opened his eyes and looked into Sherlock’s.
“Remember,” John said, “when we talked about you not buying me extravagant things?”
John felt infinitely better with another half bag of blood in his belly, although Sherlock insisted on heating up the other half for good measure. Then, while John sat in his armchair and sipped it slowly, relishing how it seemed to cling to his taste buds and coat his throat in warmth, Sherlock left for Bart’s.
It was the first word that popped into his head when he sat down to ponder it. Probably because he had, not two hours prior, been reading online about the sentencing of a woman in America who had submerged her unconscious husband in hydrochloric acid, killing him.
Then came a heavy knock, not quite a solid pound, on the door.
should learn some sodding patience,” John answers peevishly.
In a way, it was mortifying. That Sherlock thought he needed this level of comfort, the same as when he’d been sobbing and hovering on the cusp of a breakdown. But it was also…lovely. Sherlock’s scent, his heat. His breath as he exhaled into John’s hair. John couldn’t help but lean into him, close his eyes, drift for a moment in a world of nothing but Sherlock.
“You can’t be serious,” John says.
Sherlock turned to investigate and promptly wished that he hadn’t. John was bent at the waist, picking up a rather badly dented can of beans, which put his bottom perfectly in Sherlock’s vision. Not only that, but the position accentuated it, made it look especially plump and grippable.
It was considerably wetter than she’d expected. Certainly wetter than Sherlock had ever got, even when she was both physically aroused
I wasn’t all that hungover to begin with. I told you I wasn’t very drunk, just enough to get emotional and chatty apparently.
favours he owes me—all in exchange for a considerable sum of money that he can spend on
Why a sigh? Disappointment, pleasure, frustration, relief? Easy enough to discern from the sound of the sigh, obviously, if Sherlock took the time to parse it, but—
He hadn’t. Sherlock was… well, perhaps not entirely certain, but reasonably certain at least. And anyway Lestrade had proved countless times over the years that he could stare down his nose at a perfectly obvious piece of evidence and arrive at the completely wrong conclusion.
A phone number, to be precise. Then, below the number:
.” A swift burst of anger, and Sherlock stops speaking to temper it. John is not being deliberately obtuse; he simply doesn’t understand. He cannot fathom how it will kill Sherlock if John never hurts him again. “So, even though it doesn’t arouse me, I… enjoy being hurt by you.”
“Oh I dunno. I sort of thought I might call you Sherlock. Like I’ve been doing for the last four years.”
John gathered himself again with some effort. “I wouldn’t hold out much hope. Apparently I’m a four-year-old now, and I’ve got
No! Not at all. But you’d be okay with that?
Sherlock swayed forwards with a quiet grunt, her clothed pelvis digging into John’s bare bum, and John realised that Sherlock was still wanting, had put aside her own satisfaction to see to John’s, and now would’ve no doubt liked the favour returned.
“Yeah,” John said, sounding tired. “I’m early. They… didn’t need me today, turns out.”
“Oh god.” Sherlock groaned into his palms, bent his fingers and dug his nails into his forehead. “Fuck.”
) and tipping her head back. Looking up at John through her long, lovely lashes.
“Oh! Well, I’m sure you’re better at reading people than I am, what with all the unsuitable men I dated in the past years...” Molly bit her lip while her hands were playing with the edge of the photograph she was still holding.
Brush on canvas.
“You know – the secret one.”
Back at the hotel, they haphazardly stumbled up the stairs, smiling and nodding innocuously at the receptionist, who watched them over her reading glasses and raised both her eyebrows at their hasty return.
“So I could hear,” John said with a meaningful look.
No, that was ridiculous. He knew that Sherlock genuinely cared for him. There was no reason to doubt that. He was just being considerate.
Sometimes, when Mary had actually been around, she had demanded to tag along with Sherlock and John, and it had taken them superhuman effort to get her off their tails without either offending her or arousing her suspicion – Mary being the manipulative, clever snake that she was.
“That is utterly preposterous,” John huffed, looking away, obviously still too busy processing what had just happened to seriously consider anything else at all.
John blinked a couple of times.
“‘We have some very talented people working here,’ Sir Edwin bragged. ‘If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to, er ... doctor a bit of security footage. That is now the official version; the version anyone we want to will see.’
At least the email he’d sent her the other week – inviting her over the next time she was in London, which coincidentally happened to be very soon after – had been uncommonly friendly. He’d even asked about her girlfriend, Natalya. And she guessed it was time she got to know her niece, so she’d resolved to accept the invitation and try extra hard this time to avoid conflict.
The following awkward moment, where they were standing there in just their pants, was quickly ended by John, who wrapped his arms around Sherlock and let his hands wander all over his back. Sherlock instinctively pressed his face into John’s neck, breathing in his scent, so as to inhale as many John Watson biomolecules as possible. He had always been intensely aware of the faint version of this smell lingering in the vicinity of his former flatmate and had longed to properly breathe it in at close range all these years. It was the nicest smell he could imagine on the planet, curiously calming and arousing at the same time. Not that his prick could get any harder at this particular moment.
Just then, Sherlock spotted the two of them coming in. The waiter seated them at a table near the window, directly in Sherlock's line of view, as had been pre-arranged.
Sherlock had kissed him significantly longer than usual when John had come back home with his familiar short cut.
John mirrored a radiant smile back at him. They had finally found a solution to the problem that had so very rightly been raised by Sherrinford.
“No one.” That, at least, was true.
Vivian Norbury had passed away.
Tomorrow he would reserve two tables at The Ledbury for the day after.
“Yeah, well, just enough to get by on. That’s the main thing, right?” She smiled. “So tell me, how have
Like that afternoon she’d shown up at 221B just as they had been about to go and inspect another possible victim of hers. “Time for our weekly trip to the morgue, I think,” Sherlock had suggested to John, after they’d hit another dead end in an assassination case they’d taken up the week before. Once a week, Molly let them look at any shooting victims for which the Yard didn’t have a suspect yet and for which Mary naturally had been a potential candidate, what with her being a professional sniper.
In spite of the morning’s rather pleasant developments, John felt a little apprehensive as he walked from Russell Square tube station to the pub where he was about to meet up with Harry.
John couldn’t hear what was being said after that, and shook his head in amazement at his wrong assumption about which of them had been the cartoon fan. He decided to get himself a sandwich and head back home for a rest after all. He was only chasing ghosts here.
That actually hurt.
(Why he had been stupid enough not to have himself tested as soon as he’d found out the baby was not his, was beyond him. To be fair however, he
The imitator didn’t necessarily need to be just a single person.
“Well, he’s a
The director looked taken aback as well as a little offended. “You can’t just barge in here like that, sir,” he said sternly. “And surely you know we can’t let you occupy a bed that is meant for someone who needs medical attention. Someone might die because you want to stay with your pal.”
Without John, Sherlock felt like a kite let loose, floating directionless and erratically, in danger of crashing down to the ground any moment.
The question of how Sherlock’s mysterious, unknown past had influenced him had occupied John for a long time, and now he had his answer. And it was every bit as shocking as he’d feared.
The next morning, Sherlock woke up to the smell of coffee.
But also on a tube ride during rush hour, when they were sitting some distance apart and John wanted to check with Sherlock that Rosie’s teddy was in Sherlock’s bag (and not still back at the shop they’d just visited), without having to shout through the crowd.
wouldn’t stop.
And only then did it hit John.
Still, he regretted it the moment he’d conceded.
The way John loved him, worshipped his body and made him forget time and space was still an astonishing, miraculous experience to Sherlock, which he couldn’t get enough of.
John was getting surer by the minute that it was definitely what he
, and that fact alone was amazing and overwhelming. Being this close together, as one, was worth more than a little physical discomfort. Also, John was desperate to feel something,
bloody got together!” And then, slightly exasperated, “To be honest, I’d almost given up hope of ever seeing the bloody day, I gotta tell you.”
Jim Moriarty never had a genderqueer brother. It was a genderqueer sister.
At first, John merely let out an almost inaudibly soft moan. But after a few more neck kisses, John suddenly grabbed a towel to quickly wipe most of the dough off his hands and, with a hurried movement, reached down to unfasten his belt, pushing his trousers down in one fluid motion.
Once they and their luggage were all inside, though, the atmosphere suddenly changed to business-like.
“I’m so happy for you, John,” she whispered, fondly. “For both of you. Please, look after him well.”
John sat up, listening.
She gave a perfunctory summary of the projects she was coordinating with the local LGBT Network division, but to her surprise, Sherlock kept asking new questions about the things she told them, showing genuine interest and wanting to know more about her work, her ambitions and her new homeland.
had been a much bigger coincidence than the fact that there had been Thatcher busts in Venice.
Hannah tried to hide a smile. Unsuccessfully.
Once his knees started to hurt, he stood.
Sally briefly rolled her eyes.
“You’re giving up then?” Moore smirked.
He took a short breath.
“Ugh,” was all John managed in reply. He was well and utterly spent and half wondering whether he would be fit enough to accompany Sherlock at all.
“Come on, let’s scoot over to the middle of the bed,” John whispered. Which was a good idea, seeing as their legs were uncomfortably dangling off the edge.
Although, to be fair, she did know quite a lot about him, but without him knowing that, of course. Not that any of that interested her in that way. Not like it did to Rose, who actually thought he was sexy and interesting. Nevertheless, a fake smile and strange accent had been all that was needed to make the idiot want to text with her.
Sherlock smiled at Bob without replying. Then, as he started to turn away, he said, “I will leave you two to enjoy the rest of your evening now. Order what you like, by the way; it’s on the house. Good-bye.”
“What,” John said. “You want to go stand on a corner and give her a flyer when she walks by?”
A strange mixture of intense relief, joy and anxiety washed over him.
Both their eyes widened in shock.
“Dad? I happen to be stranded at Oxford station. Could you perhaps put me up for the night?”
. Having been useless at that was one thing, but being unable to do anything to make up for it now was even worse.
“Oh, just some client of this Bob, who might be able to tell me a bit more about him.”
the bits and pieces on the Moriarty Wall he was staring at.
John felt a fierce pride, seeing Sherlock be so completely at ease with his brother depending so closely on him.
“You have plans for Christmas? New Year’s?” John didn’t even know why he said it.
John relaxed a little.
Sherlock’s intense gaze was met by John’s open expression, his jaw set determined although his face was relaxed. Sherlock’s eyes were smiling and it was the most beautiful thing John could imagine ever seeing. Did he do this to Sherlock?
* * * * *
Once they were sat down and provided with tea and a serving stand filled with all sorts of delicious snacks, John leaned back in his chair, pursing his lips before speaking. “So you had made this reservation for us then. Not for a case.”
Another brush of lips.
“How the hell did you know, though?” John suddenly asked. “To look in Hell?”
They both sat.
It was the same face, just different hair and make-up.
His Mind Palace seemed to have turned into a dark swamp, where he kept getting lost, struggling to see, struggling to get from one place to the next in the thick mud that kept dragging him down.
for John. And Sherlock was so, so incredibly grateful to her. And indebted, of course, seeing as her sacrifice wouldn’t have been necessary at all if he hadn’t been so cocky and sent Mary (Rosamund) that stupid text, which had given away their location at the Aquarium, thereby creating a circumstance where John had had to shoot her to protect his aunt.
His mind was reeling with the unexpected events of the last two hours. Mary’s dying words. Greg and Mycroft arriving at the scene. Dimmock, Hopkins and Donovan giving him their heartfelt condolences.
Greg suddenly felt his throat had gone dry and he swallowed, telling himself once again to close the bloody door and get out.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut.
So Sherlock had devised a way to see for himself.
John nervously looked around him, feeling awkward, and replied: “Take a cab back to the hotel. Pay the cabby double to make it fast.”
Sherlock smirked.
like this,” John said, focusing on the practical again. “I mean, if the idea behind seducing me was really to be able to kill you, she’s had plenty of opportunity before last week, hasn’t she? So why did she not use it?”
“Sherlock,
John glanced over at the miracle between the wrinkly bedsheets next to him, still sweaty and not quite having caught his breath yet.
in what sense?” he asked, as he went to stand behind John and put his arms around him, curiously watching the kneading process over John’s shoulder.
, the ones you’ve
“No, never mind. It’s nothing.”
Summer slowly started to give way to autumn, with colder winds and the occasional tree starting to change colour. Meanwhile, as there was still no other sign of Eurus except Hannah’s dead neighbour, it was almost as if none of that was real. As if it were all just a game. They were safe and comfortable in 221B with the four of them.
Sherlock momentarily looked like a fish gasping for breath.
“You know,” John said, after a while, “in the middle of all this mess, what I feel really bad about?”
A different sort of warmth settled in his stomach at the thought.
Thus, John’s heart became filled with more and more love for his mad detective. Love that sometimes merely simmered in the background, that frequently bubbled up to the surface in the form of words or gestures, and often manifested itself in gropes and kisses, which, in turn, occasionally led to other activities.
John raised his eyebrows.
“She’s very clever.”
Sherlock was happy with his book on plant fibres that John had gotten him from A.Z. Fell’s antiquarian bookshop, and John seemed very chuffed with his engraved pen and hand-bound leather notebook.
But that’s just fantasy, right? This cannot be real.
“Three hundred pounds.”
The whole scene screamed ‘my idyllic life when Redbeard was still alive’.
John would indeed have to think about it.
to do this with him, remarking how she was so much better at this sort of thing. They’d actually had to slow the bloody dog down so that he wouldn’t betray what they were actually looking for.
“A witness report, of sorts. Of Sherrinford’s first crime scene. Second hand, though. I asked Mycroft to recount what our nanny said she saw.”
“Which trace is Toby following, then?” she’d beamed, handing Rosie to John so that she could meddle more freely.
He looked at Sherlock, who was grinning, in spite of the physical discomfort John could tell he was in. (Nausea and cold flashes, by the looks of it.) John briefly put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and looked him in the eye. “Thank you,” John said softly. He thought about hugging Sherlock, seeing as the hug they’d shared an hour ago had felt so good and calming. (And so very, very right.)
“Of course I didn’t know.” Funny thing, that, John thought. Because the truth was, you never knew what was going to happen with Sherlock, did you? But this had decidedly been a whole new category of surprise. Usually, Sherlock was the one unexpectedly
Sherlock missed John from the minute their lips had stopped touching on the corner of Blandford Street, and it made his stomach clench that he had no clue as to when he would see him again. Irritable and tired, he dropped onto the sofa and closed his eyes. As soon as he shut out all visual stimuli, images from the pornos he’d seen the previous afternoon came drifting back into his mind; as they had at several – very inconvenient – moments during the day as well. But this time he didn’t try to push them away.
anymore.”
Suddenly, a roar made his throat hurt, as he pushed all his energy into the heavy, wooden table, toppling it over and erasing the feeling of tears burning on his cheeks.
Thankfully, no psychopaths made themselves known during the journey, and the connecting flight from Oslo to Ørsta-Volda being delayed by twenty minutes was the only setback in an otherwise perfectly smooth journey. They arrived in the village of Ørsta even before the notoriously early Scandinavian dusk had set in.
With many thanks again to my tireless betas mydogwatson, mama-orion and Jonathan!!
When John finally came, he was half-afraid he might have alarmed Scotland Yard with his cries.
First, Sherlock drew himself, sitting at the table and making a drawing, like a
“This time, knock.”
, including her targeting John under two different disguises and managing to get
Next to him, the director furiously cursed under his breath.
They showed interest. Respect. In a calm way. Not intrusive.
A broad smile lit up John’s face as he turned his head to greet Sherlock. “Hey! Good morning. Sleep well?”
Sherlock stumbled into the hall. “If you’d like to know how I predict the future...”
Smith just chuckled unpleasantly. “Come along,” he said, turning around.
It took a few seconds before what the woman just said sank in.
Usually that was the kind of thing you didn’t really think about until after having been together for a couple of months, but John figured that the four years he and Sherlock had known each other already counted as such, in this case. This wasn’t just a fling. This was either for good or it would become the largest cock-up of his life – and after Mary, that said something.
They ate cake and chatted some more, and John casually kissed Sherlock in front of everyone – twice – making the afternoon fly by.
Molly walked up to him. “Code word?” she asked, somewhat nervously.
“No one?” Smith asked, innocently.
“Thank
Once, Sherlock had bluntly admitted to missing John – even though they’d seen each other only three days before.
“You think we’re… average?”
A smile began to form on Sherlock’s lips as the realisation dawned on his face that John had in all probability just solved the puzzle.
Sherlock had quite a vivid memory of just this one fragment, nothing more: his youngest older brother putting the blue rope around his neck and pulling, as he struggled for air… but was that memory even accurate? In it, he’d already been lying on the ground, flat on his back. He had no recollection of how he got there, what happened just before. Had they been fighting? If so, over what?
“And you never once made tea for me in the dream, John. It was a horrible dream.”
Mycroft.
When he approached the gate, he was already well in character. He casually sauntered up the main driveway, swaying his limbs a bit more than a sober person would. Not too far away, five of the workmen stood huddled around an apparently broken piece of equipment. Perfect. Sherlock strolled over, trying to overhear their conversation so he could chime in.
Fully entrusting Sherlock with his body and soul – with everything he was – was definitely, by far, the most liberating thing he’d ever done.
Sherlock felt a vague, unpleasant sensation in his stomach, as if he were about to be sick. Wasn’t it ironic that John doubted what he meant to Sherlock, while Sherlock was certain no one had ever loved another person more ardently than he did John. Of course, John had every reason to be suspicious of Sherlock’s intentions, especially concerning unexpectedly offered food items. Sherlock had not always been able to resist opportunities to test the physical effects of medically uncharacterised substances by slipping them into John’s dinner. The great paradox was that he had only been able to do those things because John trusted him – and because John trusted him, Sherlock loved him.
Thankfully, the weather remained lovely for the time of the year and mostly sunny.
“She’s out there, she obviously likes him,” the therapist went on, “and does he have the first idea how lucky he is?”
Sherlock took a quick photograph before getting out a pair of latex gloves to pick the box up. He held it up to smell it and wrinkled his nose. He then studied it on all sides, turning it this way and that. Finally, he opened it, to find there was an empty blister in there. The look on his face was one of Christmas anticipation. “John, what do you make of this?”
Sherlock frowned. “John, I don’t have a sister.”
It couldn’t be from Speedy’s, as the café was meant to be closed today.
After he’d heard the short version of the story that was now the official account, Lestrade called in his team. There had been a murder, after all.
,” Sherlock said, “when they don’t even know yet that that is, in fact, what he is. Don’t you think? First things first. And no, I haven’t decided yet how or when to tell them, but definitely not within the next three weeks. Other priorities.”
Having it be rather lovely to have Harry over, however, was probably the most unforeseen event of the day. They hadn’t bickered or disagreed on anything. She hadn’t been annoyed by him, or by Sherlock or Rosie, for that matter. And hearing her talk about her work had been rather inspiring.
“I’d been playing with him, in the garden. It was an Irish setter, named Redbeard. We were inseparable.” He swallowed, trying not to let the associated emotions resurface.

“Four years,” Smith said, softly. “Well, that’s a long time, isn’t it?” He drew his lips back from his teeth. “Four years.”
“No, but I suppose it’s not very hard to stick one onto your face when you don’t want to be recognised.”
There was a short silence.
After a minute or two, his brother went over to a cupboard with drawers and took a pile of drawing paper from it. Then he sat down at the table and started drawing.
The three of them had been a brilliant team and soon became inseparable. Jim had the connections and ideas, Eurus helped devise plans and arranged their finances, and Rose did the practical planning and execution (sometimes literally) of the jobs that actually brought in the money. While Jim had been impressed by Rose’s professional qualities, Eurus had been mesmerised by her cheery, self-assured manner and her coy smile. She’d had an instant crush on her.
instead of me. Even got herself pregnant.”
In Hell, of all places, it had all come full circle. In Hell, they had found heaven.
“And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd, he seem'd to find his way without his eyes; For out o' doors he went without their helps, and, to the last, bended their light on me.”
“I’m really sorry, but I’m honestly not authorised to approve that.” From his tone of voice, it was quite clear that the nurse was not in fact sorry at all.
John merely looked intrigued, with his half-frown –  obviously unaware of the dramatic change that was about to take place in both their lives. He patiently crossed his arms over his chest and just stood there with his coat still on, listening.
Having finished half of her burger, she put the other half back into the bag, for breakfast, and stretched out onto the mattress lying in a corner. She hardly noticed how filthy it was, and if she did, it didn’t matter anyway.
“That’s exactly my point.” Sherlock tried not to roll his eyes or look away. “Please tell me they didn’t think it started when Mary was still alive,” he whispered loudly.
“In that case,” he said, as casually as he could manage, “how about lugging some boxes tomorrow and help me move back in here with you?”
Many, many thanks once more to Ariane DeVere for her indispensable transcripts of the show, to Jonathan for Brit-picking the entire thing from beginning to end, to my meticulous grammar and language beta mydogwatson for improving both this fic and my knowledge of the English language, and to my plot betas mamaorion, 88thparallel, camillo1978 and thelanding for beta’ing different parts of the story and helping me make it flow so much more smoothly.
“We were idiots,” Sherlock breathed.
He smiled to himself as he added the plates to the dirty pile on the worktop in Tony’s corner and walked over to the espresso machine.
Sherlock hung up and reclined on the hospital bed next to John’s.

By Tuesday, John hadn’t been able to stand the empty flat anymore. Deciding that it wouldn’t hurt to find out a bit more about Steve Meredith and his strange adventure spraining his ankle on the moor, John had gone to the street where he and Craig Welton lived, in order to shadow the two of them and see if they might be hiding anything. Or anyone.
and on the brink of losing control. It was a somewhat worrying but beautiful sight and it made Sherlock want to get to know more of this side of him that was now meant only for him.
He loved Sherlock and he loved nothing more than to make love to him like this: to have Sherlock look up at him expectantly from below, with his legs around John’s back as he pumped into him. It was the best feeling in the world, in spite of the guilt eating away at him. But Sherlock had asked him to do this, even though John didn’t quite understand why.
Just as Sherlock’s brain was starting to come back online, John stiffened and a low grunt escaped from somewhere deep in his throat as his come splashed all over Sherlock’s chest and flank.
“Oh yes, well, he loves painting animals,” she said, appearing a little distracted by her own thoughts. “I can’t believe he still remembers what Redbeard looked like. I mean, more likely he just coincidentally painted a similar dog from a magazine,” she said dismissively, waving a hand.
“I think she gets that from you.” John smiled a cheeky smile, which made Sherlock suddenly feel wonderfully warm inside, even though John was just talking nonsense, of course. Since Sherlock had no genetic bond with Chloe, she couldn’t ‘get’ anything from him. At least, he didn’t think behavioural imprinting started as early as this in humans. Or did it?
And it had worked like a charm.
The Baker Street boys had arrived at CDG Airport just a few hours earlier, dropped their bags off in their hotel room and were now headed for the huge glass pyramid that was the gate to art heaven. They were walking on the Parisian pavement at a leisurely pace, content about having a change of scene in Europe’s most romantic capital.
“Great work, Sherlock,” Greg said on the phone. “We’ve found the place where she’s staying. She wasn’t there, unfortunately. But I’ve put four officers on a stakeout near the building to maintain constant watch over the place: two for each entrance. I’ll let you know as soon as we’ve got her.”
“We… er… we just kissed,” Sherlock said.
And while he had never been one for cuddling and fluff, he found that with Sherlock, what he loved possibly as much as the sex, was just lazily lying entangled on the sofa together, studying the hairs on the other’s neck or the curves of the other’s auricle, or simply feeling each other’s warmth and listening to each other’s breathing. Just being
“Of course.” Sherlock managed a watery smile.
“Of course it’s not a trick. It’s a
Sherlock’s breathing became somewhat more shallow as he tried to picture himself and John in the various positions, wondering what John would be like during sex: whether he would be shy or assertive, gentle or dominant. Sherlock had felt John’s passion when they'd kissed, but he knew that John was not the type to push boundaries or be selfish. If Sherlock would just be able to relax enough, it had to be possible to manage penetration without too much difficulty. It

“Oh, it’s just a monthly top-up. Confession is good for the soul... providing you can delete it.”
John swallowed and nodded.
Arnold signed something that unmistakably meant, “You two, come with me and look at what I want to show you.” They followed him out onto the corridor and into the common room, a little further down the hall, which was deserted at this time of day. He went over to the tv set and took a DVD from his bag, which he inserted into the DVD player.
“We have all the time in the world,” Sherlock said, his voice soft. “We can sit here as long as we like.”
“The truth is rarely pure, and never simple. It’s from ‘The Importance of Being Earnest.’ We did it in school.” Sherlock quirked a tentative smile.
Even though it was dark and they were mere shadows between the bins and the piles of empty crates, it was indisputably them. The moonlight on this rare clear London night brushed a distinctive cheekbone protruding from below a mass of wild, dark curls, and bounced off of the shorter man’s greyish blond hair.
He quickly put a pillow under his bottom, infinitely grateful for the internet and its inexhaustible source of information.
you were together? How would you like that, hm?” Sherlock’s eyes shot fire.
Apparently, Sherlock
“He can’t
In the background, he heard Hannah ask, “Have they got her?” and John apparently nodded, because Sherlock then heard her scream and yell euphorically, followed by cheers from the officers.
While the cake was being cut and handed round, John kneeled next to him, petting the puppy’s head. “Shall we call her Pearl? What do you think?”
It was Steve.
Sherlock was asleep.
“Well, during your beauty sleep,” Sherlock said, fondly teasing, “I have managed to find the theatre group, as well as their audition announcement for the Hamlet play, which luckily turned out to be in image format and made in sufficiently high resolution to be printed out as a small poster.”
“Well, I do. And it will probably fade away with time. All I’m asking is for you to give me that time, okay?”
“The rest of our lives,” Sherlock mumbled, dreamily. He’d intended it to sound mockingly cheesy, but it came out surprisingly normal. Sherlock smiled inwardly.
“Yeah, well. I was kind of hoping you’d figure it out yourself when you got to know them a bit better,” he said, a little uneasily. “People don’t tend to respond kindly to someone unofficially diagnosing their own parents with a mental disorder.” He took a long breath. “Sorry. I’m sorry. I should have told you of my suspicions, John. Please forgive me.”
Sherlock decided not to mention the other parts that were coming back to him then, like the bit where he made John believe he didn’t know how to switch off the bomb they’d found in the tube carriage, when they had been preventing the attack on the Palace of Westminster two years ago.
And he wanted
“How was Aunt Viv?” Sherlock asked, timidly.
Thank you so much for all the lovely comments in the past weeks. They did make me feel a lot better about the whole endeavour. :)
. How was that even possible? And amazingly, it made him look at least ten years younger.
