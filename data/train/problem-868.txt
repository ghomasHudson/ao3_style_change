, as his friend had slowly turned into little more than a vegetable, floating in the lull between cases and anything of interest. It was different from his usual sulking, this heavy, oppressive atmosphere that clung to his skinny form like a grey cloud. Somehow; it felt sharper, more dangerous and volatile. Like John might get struck with lightning if he let himself get too close.
He turned to John then, and his words were malevolent with promise. John felt his mouth run dry, for the first time regretting his actions as he felt a stone sink into the pit of his stomach.
Sherlock had at least expected Daniel to appear once, or perhaps maybe Conrad. As it was, the detective had considered brushing up on boxing again, a sport in which he hadn't participated in since he was in his teens, but could prove useful if he found himself face-to-face with
The name hit John like a wall. He leaned back into his pillows, the air abruptly knocked out of him. Out of all the explanations he had tried to anticipate, few things could prepare him for such a reveal. His mind was quick to piece together the implications.
When they finished that night, Sherlock went to his dorm, aching but pleasantly high. In the darkness of his dorm while his dorm mate slept (Victor Trevor, but that was another story all on its own) the young man pressed the edge of a clean scalpel to the line of his ribs. If Sherlock closed his eyes, he could almost imagine what it would be like to cut upwards, cleave the damning evidence of his womanhood from him. Peel away the feeling Seb's hands had left as he had groped him, pressing him down onto his knees by tugging on his hair.
His body had immediately made himself dive out of Sherlock's sight in a mixture of shock and adrenaline, his hand cradling the still-smoking weapon in his palm as he tried to wrap his mind around the fact that he had actually
“Please John. I don't know what to do. At this rate, I'm about ready to do something I really don't want to do. She's going to eat me, or worse if I don't figure out what set her off! ”
So it's been a while, between Sherlock's finale and school kicking my ass, I've finally found some time to give all of you the next chapter. I hope you enjoy. If you're curious about the language that's not Dragon-Tongue used in this chapter, it's very loosely based in Irish Gaelic. ^_^ More info on the meanings at the bottom of the page.
"I thought many things were important to you, but it's clear where your priorities lie," John said as he got up.
It was about nine in the morning, and the sun had rudely woken John from his slumber after blinding his eyes with its loud rays.  John had spent most of his time in his room that previous evening, due to the fact that a little someone was accompanying Sherlock.  There it was, that random pull at his heart.  It felt like someone was tearing at the veins in his throbbing muscle, but he didn't know who or why.  Feeling grumpy, John got up from his bed mummy style and stretched every muscle in his back.  He drearily trudged to the kitchen and started making himself a steamy cup of coffee.
Ouch.  John did his best to conceal the pained feeling from Sherlock's clear rejection.  He didn't understand why it hurt so much to not have his approval.  Normally, he didn't care what Sherlock said.  But now, here he was wanting Sherlock to give him confidence in his intelligence.
John panicked.  He was doing his best to think of ways to dissuade Sherlock in the opposite direction.  He felt guilty for leading Sherlock away from a much better guy.  But screw it.  This was the one chance he got to be around him, and he wasn't taking it for granted.
"A ring.  I thought that was fairly obvious," Sherlock said when he peered to see what the kerfuffle was about.
‘Then I ask again, why are you back?  If I caused you that much misery why are you back here?!  Is it so you at least have some company of some sort, until you run off and leave me again for something better?  Is that it?!  Or are you genuinely missing me and plan to stay here?  Because it sounds like you plan to stay here temporarily” Sherlock said giving John not an expression of anger or sadness, but an expression of pain.  The room was completely silent by this point.  Everyone was paying attention.   Every word was being soaked in.  John stayed quiet.  Sherlock spoke again.
WARNING: There is discussion of how a person was k*lled when they deduce a jumper.  There is a mention of blood. If this is a sensitive topic, then go to the next chapter!
“Yeah, but he’s just a faggot!” a boy yelled out making some of his friends laugh.  Sherlock’s brows furrowed and he leapt offstage and closer to the boy.
Again he felt that little stab in his heart, like a knife had been slowly etching inside and fiercely carving nasty words.  Sherlock was not a considerate person.  Besides saving him, John couldn't think of an instant where Sherlock did something nice for him just because.  This was the guy that refused to get the milk or take out the trash.  Old Sherlock would've forgotten it was Eric's birthday, or better yet, deleted it.  New Sherlock was thoughtful and sweet.
As John shivered back into his flat, he saw that the place was a little messier than when he had left it.  Wrapping paper was tossed on the floor, and streamers were shredded.  It looked like quite the party.   Undressing himself, he heard a familiar deep chuckle arise from the living area.  Then, he saw it.  Sherlock was settled by the fire in his seat.
And there was that little beam of hope he needed.  Sherlock didn't ask Eric for his opinion.  He asked for John's.  That must mean he values him at least a little more than that jerk Eric.  Eric was probably extremely useless.  Most male models aren't known for their intellect, unlike doctors.
"Sherlock, I know when you're trying to pull one over me.  Tell me what this ring is for," John demanded.  He was so close to snapping.  His body was tensing and telling him to tackle Sherlock for being so difficult.
"My apologies.  I've never been good with short measurements," Eric said with the corner of his lips tugging into a smile.
“Sherlock” she said in a friendly voice while hugging him.  “I’m glad to have you back, although we seem to be in an unfortunate situation” she said sadly.  John wondered who the lady was and why she seemed to be so familiar with Sherlock.  Sherlock smiled at her.
“Another case John, keep up!” Sherlock walked into the kitchen and began searching for things.  He started to grab objects John was not familiar with.  John shut his laptop and placed it aside.  He watched Sherlock eagerly look for things.  They hadn’t had a case in two months so he understood Sherlock’s excitement.
“So what was it you wanted to discuss?” he asked.  He set his coat on the hanger and turned around, only to have him be pulled down into a giant snog.  Yes, John Watson kissed Sherlock Holmes.  John pulled away softly.
"It's a woman's jumper.  You can tell by the deodorant smell from the pits and the perfume stench," Eric said.
"I'm guessing she's an older woman judging from the grey hair strand," John said, trying his best to gather information on the victim.
“Today’s topic is love…loss.  We are going to improvise today, with these concepts” the man began to say.  He looked at Sherlock and John with a sudden idea in mind.  John began to squirm in his seat.  “You two are a couple yes?” he asked the two.
The pair took no time.  John grabbed Sherlock by the shirt collar, and Sherlock wrapped his thin arms around the other's waist.  Their lips collided desperately together, grasping for each cherished movement.  None of John's previous kisses had ever felt so right.  This kiss felt like it was meant to happen.  It was comfortable, despite the unfamiliarity of it all.  Though it was perfect, it only lasted a short minute.  Sherlock pulled away.  John could see his eyes dilated so much that he might as well just have black eyes.
Sherlock felt the cool ocean water lap his calves even as he waded outwards towards the edge of the outcropping of rocks that jutted out and divided the beach, keeping himself hidden in their shadow even as he kept up his crooning lullaby. His fingers gripped the stone tightly as his blue eyes shimmered in the dark.
Mycroft's eyes narrow dangerously, and he twirls his umbrella about in his hands. Daniel can tell the man is not used to hearing the word
There was a breath of peace as Hajera announced their names before kneeling herself, Queen Rania rising to her feet in one graceful motion to reveal a glittering dress of aquamarine and midnight blue. Her Dragon wound itself about her neck, seamless in its motions. When she spoke, it was with the calm quality of someone absolutely and completely secure in the knowledge of their own power and ability. Her English was nearly accentless, cultured with a British lilt that gave away the origins of her tutors.
John can't exactly remember when it all began. It's difficult sometimes, trying to recall his memories. Painful flashes of colour and grey, of light and dark.
shoulders. Sherlock could imagine that John might have been an extraordinarily sunny child, if circumstances had perhaps blessed him with a different sort of past.
The compulsion was sudden and gut wrenching, leaving Sherlock almost light-headed. In an instant, everything vanished from his mind but one single thought:
, hanging on to life vainly for a second before greying to cold and lifeless. Sneak meant his statement literally of course, but knew the woman beside him wouldn't interpret it that way. Honestly, regular people were funny like that. Always looking for meaning behind a sentence. Over-analysing.
John wondered what it was that Sherlock saw, written in the Chinese Dragon's stature. However, neither Dragon seemed to deign it necessary to answer the soldier's quiet question. Cerioth tilted his head in acknowledgement of the sympathies given, but his eyes said more. They were filled with a distant sort of sadness.
And the cabbie's little gasp as the life fled from him, the pain too much to bear. His slightly crooked teeth gritting as his last breath shuddered through his wretched figure.
His last thought was for how gently the Spirit cradled him, despite his cold face. And how even though everything else seemed so dry and so arid, when Sherlock moved John swore he could feel rain streaking his face, washing the paint and the blue moon away.
“They're just shedding their coats,” Mike observed, looking at one in particular that was wriggling alongside its mother.
John murmured, the response light, but the Selkie’s bright blue eyes seemed to jump to his face anyway. Sharp angles considered him carefully, and John felt as if he had suddenly wandered into the hairs of a crossfire. He swallowed, dropping Sherlock’s gaze. His skin felt hot, and without quite knowing why John felt as if he had just admitted some private fear to the Selkie. He stared at the ocean hard, voice a murmur. “That was uncalled for, I’m sorry.”
Neither stirred, lost in their own minds and dreams that swirled about them like a mother's hug drawing them near.
John to his credit  stubbornly ignored the woman, filling out the Adoption papers with a red-ink pen on the desk as Mr. Lyle grinned like it was Christmas morning and he had just been exceptionally good all year. Again his oily voice complimented John's choice, not that it had really been much of a decision at all. John was surprised the price wasn't higher for the Northern he's just selected, but he supposed the beast
John for his part, eyed Sherlock’s cock at first a bit like an experiment. It was long, though not abnormally so, and proportionate to Sherlock’s build. Uncircumcised, the head was dusky pink, the same shade as the dark flush that currently painted the detective’s collarbones and neck. John used one hand to stroke the shaft tentatively, and was pleased when he was rewarded with a breathy moan. Feeling a bit braver, he leaned forward, licking a stripe up and along Sherlock’s shaft. Upon coming to the head, John lingered, lapping gently at the leaking slit. It was a strong taste, but not altogether unpleasant. Just… very human, John supposed.
Though John's Dragon was still mostly out of it, he responded to Molly's tiny whimpers with snarling and snapping, seeming to be too dazed to realize that his protests were useless given the fact that he was in a metal box with air holes drilled in it. The noises he made were horrific, and even Cerioth looked vaguely tetchy and nervous as they grew in volume, the Dragon's hands tightening minutely about the wheel. It was interesting, to see even other Dragon's flinch away from a Red Card. The Northern didn't seem to notice. Its Crate rocked savagely as the beast threw itself against the metal confinements again and again, and John worried to himself that he'd have to deal with bruising along its shoulders and neck when he got him.
“How would they track him though? That one's long gone, likely died in the desert. And it's impossible to navigate there unless you know the lay of the land inside and out.” He frowned as he pointed out.
“I... I never had, really. Friends that is. Too boring. Too many people, too vacant. Those that weren't vacant were dull and
to Dodge's ministrations. Which was rather foolish, in Sherlock's opinion, as if it weren't for John's
“Yeah he does. Doesn't even charge to the mess hall like the rest of us, just dives towards the showers and soaks for as long as he can. Not that I blame him.”
The man took in the tension in Sherlock’s spine calmly it seemed, for he didn’t appear overly concerned. In fact, he seemed to expect it, and a part of the Dragon chafed at being read as predictable. There was something unsettling about the way the man looked at him, as if he were peeling back the layers of his skin. Sherlock felt as though he were being regarded as a  poorly made paper mache piñata, colourful on the outside but filled with nothing but cheap candy within.
He assumed Victor Trevor to be an idiot because it only took a moment of meeting him to recognise that he was kind.
It was an interesting thing, Sherlock thought. Seeing someone who almost acted and had every appearance of a person you had thought you had known fairly well (better than well, he had known John Watson like the back of his hand or so he had thought) yet was like an entirely different person. To have similarities, and yet see what can only be described as a
“Being medics will mean you won't be put on the front lines most likely. You probably won't see much battle at all. After all, if one man can patch up fifteen other men, they tend to put the fifteen other men out first. Plus with Dragons now being used as Defensive Partners, mortality rates have dropped significantly.”
Bill was openly baring his teeth now, and his green eyes were flat with hatred. “There was a time when you
Then they were left in the dust of the desert, and Bill clenched his jaw in silence. When his eyes cleared, he turned to Kate. His voice was curt and decisive.
The detective blew a breath he hadn't known he had been holding out through his teeth in a hiss, coat flapping as he shoved one hand in his pocket for warmth. His blue eyes closed with relief as for a moment he swayed on the spot, cheeks colouring slightly in the draining of adrenaline from his system. Sherlock struggled to remain upright as he tightly responded.
Vodka and something that tasted vaguely like lemonade lined his lips as he licked them, a warm tingling bubbling in his blood that made him feel as if he were made of fireworks. It had been awhile since he had felt so utterly sloshed, and he embraced it even as more and more people turned in for the night, smiling and laughing and finally opening up to the rest of the town. Most of the people had, if not known him as a child, at least known his grandmother, and as a result they were quick and jovial in opening up their tightly-knit little circles.
“There is much I did not get to write about, in that first tome. It became too dangerous to do so, and later I wished to forget what I knew. I went into hiding, gave up my true form for safety.”
Sherlock's back was an expanse of finely-tuned muscle, still too thin but getting stronger by the day. He was resting lightly on the balls of his feet whenever he stood, and those eyes, even when they were supposed to be trained on the task at hand, were inevitably drawn to London's rainy skies. It was an instinct, one hard to suppress, and Sherlock had done an admirable job while waiting for his wing to heal properly.
For the first time, she looked Sherlock directly in the eye. The Dragon lifted his chin, ignoring the mental and verbal
the almost eerie piece upstairs. Not wanting to alarm Mrs. Hudson, he listened with a rather strained look of interest on his face, even as his fingers drummed restlessly against his knee and he had to bite back every sharp rebuff that came to his mind. Finally, he could take it no longer and gripping the old woman's shoulders soundly he looked her in the eye and told her
Mycroft was distracted from the sound of his brother's somewhat surprising panic attack by “Anthea's” (for her name changed nearly every other week) quick footsteps. The government official looked up to see his PA was lingering in the doorway, looking surprisingly and uncharacteristically... nervous. Her dark eyes were filled an unidentifiable emotion, and her lips were pursed in reluctance even as she interrupted the government official's phone call hesitantly.
This puzzle, serial suicides, had proven so far to keep him for more than just a few hours. The mysteries were getting harder, and Sherlock had the suspicion that his solving time was being monitored. Competitive to a fault, he bent over the file, his brain flickering through possibilities like the shutter of a lens. Victims all Human, indiscriminate in age, gender, sexuality and social standing. They were only connected by a poison, and a lack of note that made the mystery tantalizingly elusive. Sherlock only wished there was more to go on, more to
“A guardian?” Irene didn’t know of a guardian for their village, it was simply too tiny for a spirit to bother with. Yet an impossible, daring hope had begun to claw its way up from her stomach, and it was making her feel foolish.
To my beta, TPurr- my email got hacked a while ago and I lost your email. I'm sorry!!! I promise I'm not dead or ignoring you it's just because of that.
ah yes, the pivotal chapter. Spent a long time on this one. This is where things begin both coming together and falling apart, somewhat. Also, next chapter look forward to a visit from Conrad and Daniel ^_^
Softly, John drew a hesitant breath. If he was wrong, he might very well send the Dragon bolting back to its room. However, if he was correct....
The way Sherlock calmly explained it made sense to John, in theory at least. Yet theory work couldn't erase the pain of a very sharp set of teeth latching themselves onto his shoulder, the soft lullabies he had been crooning to Elena to try and get her to sleep (for she was a somewhat nocturnal baby) turning into a sharp yelp of pain. Immediately, Sherlock had scrambled up from his position of lying prone on the sofa, clamouring up the stairs for fear that his Mate has somehow been grievously injured. What he found instead, much to his struggle to conceal his laughter, was a rather pained John, trying in vain to pry his daughter's vice-like bite from his skin.
After all, she had seen it in her own face until the day her husband committed suicide, after going on a killing spree that shocked her small District and effectively alienated her from her friends and family in an instant. The move to London hadn't been a choice of luxury. It had in the end been a
was. So Sherlock raised no protest, merely stared at the key in bemusement. Then, he tucked it under the collar of his dark black shirt, feeling its weight settling against his chest.
John did his best to hold it in.  Sherlock never ordered his food for him.  In fact, he mostly judged him whenever he did order something.  'Don't get that.  They never cook the potatoes right,'
One of them was a cruel, cruel thing.  Letting your friend grieve over your death for two years and then laughing as you surprised him was not the same surprise as letting someone know that you wanted to celebrate the day that started their very existence.  John was starting to sense that Sherlock was actually falling for this guy.  He didn't even do stuff like this for Janine.
"What do you make of this?" Sherlock asked John, looking up at him and lowering the jumper from his view.  John glanced over at the pair.
"I'd say it's new because the material is still in tact.  The owner is clean because it is perfectly white.  And it looks like they received some sort of injury, a head injury maybe," John said, eyeing Sherlock for approval.
"The pleasure is all mine," Eric said in a deep posh accent.  Their hands returned to their sides, and all that was left were stares.  The silence was filled by small breaths and fidgeting movement from the trio.
They waited in the backseat in silence and finally arrived at their destination…a school?!  John walked out.  Sherlock paid and then followed John out.
"This place is nice," Eric commented, taking a look around to see that most women had a designer bag.
John, regretfully, had accepted the invitation to eat lunch with Eric and Sherlock at a neighboring restaurant.  Typically, he would reject the request.  But for some reason, John felt this need to try to get Sherlock's attention.  It was out of character for John to feel so jealous of a man that didn't deserve envy.  But the inseparable pair were making it harder for John to grab Sherlock's attention.  He never had to fight against someone else for his attention.  Cases were his only common rival.
That night, John quietly told Sherlock that Daniel had disappeared from his psyche, that he could feel it. Sherlock stroked his friend’s hair, and listened in silence as John recounted in a detached voice the pain he had felt when he had been shot and left to die in Afghanistan.
Bon Jovi filled their silence for the rest of the ride home, speaking apologies neither could quite bring themselves to say.
Hands touched the base of his neck, not to squeeze or pin but to trace, resting slightly on his pulse which thundered in his own ears like a stampede of elephants. Sherlock tilted his chin back hesitantly like a lamb offering themselves up for slaughter, ignoring the way in which his mind whispered a quiet chant of
But that wasn't what made John flinch. No. What made the very hair stand up on the back of his neck was the high, keening wail that shook the compound, an alarm shrieking out moments before Andy tensed visibly. His ordered bark of “Air-raid!
The young man watched, fascination mixing with fear even as he slowly shuffled towards the door crab-like, just in case he had to make a quick escape. The Dragon continued its strange rubbing dance along the wall until it reached the far corner, where it stood on its hind legs and pressed its forepaws up at the spot where ceiling met wall. John winced and almost clapped his hands to his ears as a horrible screeching like nails on a chalkboard hit him as the Dragon's claws cut Marks into the corner, silvery in the concrete and thoroughly vivid and bright. When the beast stepped away, the Marks glittered with a kind of strange power that made John feel
Best to start with something familiar to John’s palate, as Sherlock very much doubted the boy would be inclined to try Firebryre bread just yet, or Moonstone wine. Baby steps, like leading a colt to their first true run free of a corral. Molly nodded seriously, her large dark eyes wide and filled with unspoken questions. She hesitated before leaving on her way, teeth snagging uncertainly at the bottom of her lip. Nervously, she glanced up at her Master’s face then away, not having the courage to ask something that might offend.
And Mycroft leans forward so that he is folded in the middle like a piece of paper, eyebrows lowering in suspicion as his voice dripped false courtesy
John blinked slowly, trying to understand Sherlock's mood even as the man gestured in distaste at the soldier's general crumpled posture. The detective noted the slight disbelief lighting in John's eyes, as if a part of him believed all of this
Back then both of them had gotten to see a lot of fire-trucks, mostly on the telly. They put out the fires that burned the cities and saved people, so John supposed they were important. At least important enough to go careening through traffic like they did, heedless of rules or regulations. He'd once seen one in real life, and it had actually caused an accident because someone hadn't gotten their car out of the way fast enough. It had been a scary, shrieking thing that seemed too big and too bright all at once. At the time he had cowered behind his Mother's leg.
“It’s not killing you because I’m speaking.” Mycroft was smirking, but it wasn’t a happy expression. He seemed rather worried in fact, though it was masked with a layer of irritation. “You don’t even know what you’ve done I see. Deleted it, all those years ago. You likely never thought it would happen to you and so regarded it as useless information. Brother mine, you’ve
and that's because when you do so, you're hurting everyone around you, quite literally.” John then cupped Sherlock's face in his hands, and was surprised to see the detective's mouth open in shock. With his curls mussed and his eyes wide, Sherlock looked years younger, blown into silence be the vehemence in which John spoke, emotions laid on on the table in a rush that was uncharacteristic of their usual dynamic. The army doctor's voice cracked slightly as he looked down at his flatmate, thumbs tracing the sharp plane of his cheekbones, wanting but not reaching out and closing the distance between them.
“You got me. John Watson and Sherlock, then? Heard all about Northerns, not that I've seen one up close until now.” Without hesitation the man's green eyes flicked keenly over Sherlock's pale frame. He gave a low whistle of appreciation. “That one looks like a handful.”
Strangely enough, that simple promise seemed to let the dragon relax, finally breaking his dam of silence to cry quietly relieved tears against the shell of the egg. His tears left streaks of cleanliness through the dirt smearing his face.
“Well,” John managed after a beat of awkward silence. He scratched the back of his head, looking away and at the floor before turning to step towards the broom cupboard. He opened it, speaking as he rummaged for spare sheets to put in the guest bedroom. Blue, blue would look best… “It’s just you and me now I guess. You’re gonna have to get some clothing, but for the first few days at least you can borrow an old T-shirt and maybe the bathrobe gran left behind. It’s the blue one in the wooden chest beside the fireplace,” John chattered on as he mentally tallied up the amount of pillowcases he had folded in his arms, determinedly not looking in Sherlock’s direction all the while. He could feel the man in his personal space, however, hovering behind him.
“When the mood suits him.” John murmured back, keeping his gaze resolutely forward. He refused to feel sympathy, not for the being that had with one fell swoop stolen his future away. He looked instead to the hallway the staircase lead to, seeing an elaborate and eclectic collection littering the walls. Pausing for a moment, John merely stared, transfixed by what appeared to be a hallway merely of tapestries, all wildly different in both weaving style, fabric, texture and mood. For a moment he found himself absorbed by the one almost directly across from him, its beauty leaving John speechless.
I hope you enjoy this chapter, as the next once will be lots of mind-games and Daniel and Sherlock begin to toy with each other XD
Sherlock hasn't slept for nearly a week straight, so when the two of them both arrive late at night at their flat, they are both slogging tiredly up the steps towards the door. Though the Detective made an effort not to show his exhaustion, John can read it in the slightly slowed reactions, his usual grace faltering a bit as he searched for the keys in the pocket of his belstaff. When his hands tremble slightly as he tries to fit the key in the lock Sherlock scowls darkly, eyebrows lowering in annoyance at his own body's refusal to cooperate. He nearly flinches away when John's hand covers his own and guides it absently to it's proper place, removing itself in a clinical manner a second later and making Sherlock's sleep-deprived brain almost wish for it to return.
The voice cut through the man's rant like it was made of butter, and Sherlock fell silent, a fire doused by rain.
Finally Blue turned, and the sad, quiet aura of her countenance hit Sherlock, striking him not unlike a ton of bricks. It was palpable, the grief in her very posture. Gone was John, replaced with a shade, a shadow. A fragile thing held together by stitched scars and sugar-glass.
… The Dragon’s running slowed, along with his heartbeat, and his own fingers found the collar fastened to his neck. The cold metal seeped into his skin, numbing his panic into shame. For a moment… Sherlock had forgotten that John was human, and had wanted nothing more than to wipe away Xavi’s scent, to permanently bite that pale column of neck and ensure that John could not be taken from his own hands…
He could eat it tomorrow, he reasoned, if he felt like it. Yes, he so did love breakfast. Food in general, actually, was quite good. He hadn't been fed in quite awhile, and then it had only been rabbits. They had often been frozen, and that always left a foul taste in his mouth.
The wine was indeed spiced and sweet, and it warmed John from his chest to his toes as he leaned back on the flat-topped roof that he and Mary had climbed, overlooking the centre of the village. Below them the people milled about, gathering loosely in a giant concentric ring that staggered itself about the main platform. There, the painted figure of the Water-Spirit stood in wooden glory, looking at once beautiful and mysterious. The figure was all angles, sharp features and a curling, cruel lip. It stood nearly the height of the nearby roofs, menacing as its upturned hands were filled with flowers and other blessing the villagers had scavenged. Shiny coins lined the idol's feet, along with beaded necklaces and bright, shimmering paper lanterns. They looked like burning candles from where the couple sat, surrounded by sweets and an aura of cheer.
Bill didn’t get much time to respond, Sherlock already turning away without so much as a by-your-leave. His intent was obvious, to chase after John or Morstan and demand to be involved, but as were most things in the army, Bill had to bring the weight of reality crashing back down around Sherlock’s ears. “You
That one thought was surprisingly elegant in his opinion, considering as soon as he stepped onto the cobblestone floor the acrid stench of hundreds of unwashed bodies confronted his nose. He nearly gagged, gritting his teeth as his eyes watered and he tried to blink past the automatic tears to see before him. It was a dark hallway, lined with cell bars that glinted silver in the low-hanging lights. The bulbs hummed a dull yellow, incandescent and glaring as they swung softly to the invisible breath of thousands of lives. The
the answer, really. People like him. Strong overpower the weak, and though Sherlock was by no means frail
John's possibly smartest personality. That should have been all of them, except Sherlock knew it wasn't. Because John's body was still slightly tense, and his friend looked like he wanted to say something.
"There'll be plenty to eat and plenty to drink. My wife's a chef, and we've never been exactly short on fire since the invention of matches." His blue eyes twinkled briefly, then darkened into something more serious.
Sherlock had spent the night hiding out on the compound, stewing over possibilities and waiting for the stars to recede into dawn so that he could wake John without bringing out a foul temper and more arguing. John’s angry face lingered in the Dragon’s mind, and it made him feel guiltier than it should have. He ignored the sentiment, instead focusing on the fact that John could very well be in danger, and unknowing of it.
It wasn't his fault the people in white coats couldn't leave them alone. In the end, they paid the price.
He felt a cold chill run up his spine at her words, lingering in his gut. John cocked his head to the side, confusion etched along his features. However, the mermaid seemed unwilling to say any more, and Sally dipped her sinuous body beneath the waves after a moment, leaving John without a goodbye or an explanation to her cryptic response.
Always try and remain in the waves. His kind had a distinct advantage when it came to their ability to swim (he tried not to think of who taught him that).
Mycroft waited expectantly for some kind of reply, yet after a moment he chanced a look up and saw that Shyla had become like stone, her blue-grey eyes fixated on him and yet at the middle-distance. Like a deer trapped in the headlights, she seemed scarcely to be breathing. Her age was suddenly evident all over her features, and she trembled minutely, a shake that went from her spine to her toes. The elder Holmes frowned minutely, momentarily wondering if he had said something that had offended her.
The human responded in a strange, mumbling language, completely filled with strange vowel's and clumsy, stocky consonants. It was clear by its confused expression, it didn't understand seal-speak. Sherlock scowled in frustration, curiosity for the moment making him forget his desire in replace of a desire to
“Why?!” The detective snapped, as as he did John was surprised to hear a crack in the man's voice, delicate and fragile like a shard of pottery “Why do you
Mycroft’s pale eyes looked at the army doctor steadily, his voice giving way to no emotion. His gaze however was piercing in its intensity.
A feeling of panic began to well inside Sherlock's chest, and he felt as though he was already entertaining the idea of an early-set in Stockholm Syndrome. He had seen other Dragons with it before, who mistook a lack of beatings for kindness in their Masters. They'd follow their Humans around with mooning eyes and happy smiles, all the while ignoring the leashes connected to their throats. He scowled bitterly at the thought, nails biting crescents into his palms as he finally released John's arm and allowed the soldier to rinse the last dredges of soap from his hair.
Sherlock was also somehow... softer on his girl days. Less tense, less defensive. Quieter and subdued. John would consider asking if he was okay, except that it was obvious that Sherlock wasn't hurting. No, he just seemed gentler, more prone to do things for others, though he was still wholly the detective, underneath the dose of empathy that seemed to fill him. It was like rain after Sherlock's normal lighting-personality, a muffled wash of water against the windowpane. Pastel instead of glittering, callous sharpness.
It was in this way that Lestrade slowly found his wife moving out (their relationship was beginning to become volatile), and the younger Holmes moving in. Greg learned a lot about the transgender community by proxy of simply living with Sherlock Holmes, and not all of it was pleasant tidbits but instead a cold slap to the face towards not only his own ignorance, but the ignorance of others. Sherlock had been clean for just a little over four months before Lestrade had chanced having the man on an actual crime scene with him, and said months of recovery had done the detective more than a world of good. Sherlock was no longer sallow, his skin smooth and unblemished save for scars that would heal with time and care. His fingernails were only stained mildly from nicotine, his curls were clean and cut, and he no longer walked hunched inwards on himself, no longer looked like a man headed for the gallows.
His younger brother seemed to love all of Mycroft’s forms unconditionally, nulling his secret fears. He was loved by both his mother and father, but he worried about the new Hatchling that came to his life one snowstorm-driven day.
, stayed up a while longer to think, her true form melting into realisation as she let her Gem glow. It provided a bluish lantern that illuminated the living room like a silver star, turning raven curls aglow and those blue eyes shimmering, wide awake in the early hours of dawn.
He purred, leaning in so that the only space between them was a breath. Sherlock could see his own face reflected in those irises, composed but not nearly composed enough. Later, he would wonder why it felt like he had been able to breathe endlessly, and yet not inhale at all. His answer was quick, killing the electrically charged mood with efficiency.
The Dragon knew he was affecting John... but to hear it stated so plainly… He wasn’t sure why the feeling of guilt that rose in his chest drove away his sleep, but it left him awake and brooding on outside of the tent, gazing into the distance at the wall of the encampment.
“Because you know what my Master is capable of, when he feels left out.” The wolf growled. His gaze flicked once more to John, to their interlocked hand. A cunning expression leered on his features. “Or are you not as attached to this one?” He licked his lips hungrily “Because if so, I haven’t had a human in a millennium.”
Though Sherlock wanted nothing more than for the old woman to leave him alone, there was something decidedly Motherly about her presence, and the small instinct he had to respect the elderly
Gem, he would’ve been disgusted with her. He would have mocked her for being unable to maintain even a basic mask, of being unable to control her abilities or emotions. Yet John,
In his mind he saw Molly, sobbing and clinging to Mike. He saw the girl with the flier, clutching her middle as blood
is to weed Human-lovers out. To convert those that survive. It’s… with your men, they’ll…There’ll be an initiation, for the Dragons.”
John found himself pinned to the mattress, Sherlock atop of him. The Dragon’s eyes glowed like fox fire from the overhead shade of John’s cot, but the soldier didn’t get a chance to see much of them as Sherlock’s face was soon tucked into the crook of his neck, rubbing repeatedly in a way that could only be described as nuzzling. John, hesitant to put a stop to it given the fact that Sherlock’s teeth were only inches away from his jugular, held his breath, very conscious of the human-like weight of his friend on top of him, of the warmth that Sherlock gave off. It had now been several months since John had dated anyone, and truth be told, it was difficult to find a private place to wank when you were constantly on your feet and moving about. Many soldiers gave up the illusion of privacy, instead choosing to get off in public, sometimes with other soldiers, and a few even with their Dragons. John had made a few hasty orgasms last him for a couple of weeks now, but the combination of abstinence and the way that Sherlock was pressed against him, slowly dragging his hips along his own, made John’s cock take a stirring interest.
"Well for one, I don't want Eric over here more often," John said.  He didn't want to tell him the real reason.  He couldn't.
John stood there in awe and watched Eric close the door on his perfectly round bum...not that he was looking!
During the school’s lunch, John lurked around looking at all of the students.  He then walked out of the cafeteria and into the printing room, where they had removed the body.  He began to pretend to print out papers.
"You heard me.  I don't have to repeat myself," John said.  Sherlock started laughing.  And he laughed hard.  He was laughing so hard that he slapped his knee, and tears spilled from the corners of his eyes.
"You didn't give me a chance to say it back," Sherlock said lightly.  By this point, he had stopped laughing.  A more serious expression brewed on his face.  It almost felt genuine.  Almost.
"I agree," John said as he rushed next to Sherlock's said.  They had been talking about how the weather that day was enjoyable despite the fact they were shivering.  Each time a person spoke, smoke trailed behind their words.  Winter wasn't fun.
"How do you-, never mind," John said as he picked up his menu.  It wasn't worth asking Sherlock how he knew everything.  They would be there all day.
Why would John care about something he barely knew about?  Sherlock wasn't involving him in any cases and was keeping him in the dark about reasons for this large fake relationship he had crafted.  As far as John was concerned, Eric could kiss a bunch of bricks.
"You just scared off a person that is extremely important to the case I am working on," Sherlock said.
It was a long walk.  And the walk gave John enough time to think.  There were so many questions he had, not just about Sherlock but also himself.  They ranged from, "Why do I care who Sherlock dates?" to "What does Sherlock even see in Eric?"  He was a miserable sod, marching around on the trail and imprinting the crunchy snow.  His nose was red and runny, and his hat was barely keep the hothead warm.  But it was worth the inner dialogue he had with himself.  One thing was for certain.  John, I'm not gay, Watson was in love with Sherlock Holmes.
That statement confused John.  He thought he was a model.  John tipped back his drink and let it burn his throat.  Gosh, he needed ten more of these.  Did they have any vodka left?
"Sure, you might notice things.  But you don't notice things about Sherlock," Eric said.  John sat there, feeling uncomfortable and said nothing the rest of the meal.
“Okay, now Sherlock and John, you two are in pain.  John you have…you have been away for three years and have come back…Sherlock is hurting from your disappearance…and you two are just meeting again for the first time in those three years…Sherlock I want you to start off with the line “Why are you here?” and then you two will continue the story as you go along” the teacher said.  They both begin to look at each other glassy eyed.
If Sherlock wanted to date someone, why would he have gone for Eric?  Eric didn't seem like his type.  Shorter guys with blonde hair seemed much more his style.  It hurt that Sherlock didn't even think to mention to him that he was in any relationship.  John thought they were closer than to be keeping secrets like that from each other.
"I know.  He never wears that one though.  Mycroft gave it to him for his birthday last year,"  Eric munched on the cereal John didn't notice he had been eating and licked away milk from the sides of his mouth.
The realization that Sherlock was thinking of marrying Eric was starting to become very real to John.  He couldn't bare to see Sherlock down the aisle with someone else.  It would crush his soul.  Where would John live?  Would Sherlock abandon him and Baker Street for a guy he barely knew?  He wouldn't do that to them.  Right?
"Is that Sherlock's?" John asked, a tinge of sharpness cutting into the name he was hating to say.  He pondered whether to stare at his face, the shirt, or his abs.  What?  Can't a guy commend another guy for his incredible body?
“John, I am going to ask this of you merely for professional purposes and for the investigation.  I promise you there are no ulterior motives when I ask this of you” Sherlock started to say.  That started to worry John.  What was Sherlock blabbering on about?
"Both are surprises," Sherlock said.  Taking a step back, he peered around and walked up to streamers to tweak their placement.
“Since when have you needed all this stuff?” John asked.  Sherlock had never really brought much with him to any investigation before.  What was so different now?
“Yes…but why?  You left me three years ago and suddenly you want to just barge back into my life” Sherlock said accusingly.
"What is that supposed to mean?" John was close to jumping out of a window.  Out of all the possible scenarios that played in his head, this was by far the worst reaction.  And this reaction hadn't even crossed his mind.  He had never felt more humiliated.
Since when did Eric have time to smell the sweater?  And why was he smelling the jumper?  When did male model's all of a sudden have a brain?  Why did Eric have to be one of those models?  What case did Sherlock need him for?!
“Careful John, don’t step on the bloody thing!” Sherlock scolded him.  John stopped his foot in the air and looked down to see a man with a cross in his chest.  He backed away.
Not many knew, but modeling could be a dangerous job.  There were many people online posing as photographers, pretending they could make a person famous.  Girls that were desperate for a modeling career took any chance they could.  Sadly, that left room for abductions and other dark acts to take place.
This had been right.  This was what was supposed to happen.  John and Sherlock were against the rest of the world, holding hands without handcuffs and loving each other for the rest of their days.
“Oh he is a handsome fellow!  You got lucky with this one Sherlock” Eliza beamed.  John blushed slightly wondering what she meant by ‘this one’, almost as if to imply there have been others in the past. Eliza began to show them around the school, letting Sherlock take in any information needed.
"You don't think I know?  John, you're so obvious that even a blind person could see your jealousy," Sherlock said as he wiped away the tears on his face.
“Now that we have that out of the way” Sherlock lightly took John’s hand, holding it and ringing the button for the school.  John blushed at the sudden gesture and waited patiently to be let into the school.  The door unlocked and Sherlock opened the door for the two of them.  John looked around seeing numerous religious statues, feeling out of place and self conscious of holding Sherlock’s hand.
"Then you missed the fact that it's a long strand and has a different color at the root, suggesting it's dyed hair.  This is a young woman.  Older women don't typically have hair down to their waist," Eric said.  He had plenty of experience with the fashion scene.  He knew dyed hair when he saw it.
Sherlock cleared his throat.  "Well, it was nice to see you Eric," Sherlock said, trying to break the tension.
"I take it she wasn't liked," John said.  Not many women that are killed are the result of happy acquaintances.
However as soon as the thought crossed his mind, the Dragon shifted uneasily in its sleep. John froze, mind going blank and anger disappearing to make way once again for fear and submission. The Dragon's tail lashed restlessly for just a moment.
“Really John. I can’t believe you didn’t realize sooner. Not just anyone can be a replacement for the skull....”
He would be the first to admit he was not Sherlock Holmes. His gaze did not burn with brilliance, his lips did not twist with unspoken words of intelligence. His
“Well what a coincidence, I originally requested a room to myself as well. I think it's the headmaster's idea of a joke. We can be alone together.”
“Please... Just let me go... I'll get a hotel for the night or something but... But I can't stay here knowing....” He took a deep, shuddering breath, and Sherlock
“Mmm, and since yesterday for all intents and purposes you’ve moved in with him and now you’re solving crimes together...... All without telling him of your little....
“If yer lucky you can sometimes see them teachin' their youngin's how t' swim, and they like t' sunbathe on the rocks out by the cove in the afternoons. It's nearing evenin', so there might not be many around if you go after dinner, but there's plenty of shells and pretty things to take home.”
His nerves screamed for him to act, and he didn't know how. Every possible outcome ended badly. And yet, he knew he had chosen this. Chosen to prolong the illusion that maybe, just maybe, he and this Human could coexist. He wanted to kick himself for not eating John the second he had been set free. At least then death would have been imminent, none of this slow torture of uncertainty. This Human was just so
“It doesn't matter. The fact is that if I had squeezed any harder, it's likely I would have broken something permanent.” John's voice was
“Only his closest know his true name.” Xavi explained tightly “But to those who are just followers, he’s called
to him, and though the young man hadn't been that interested in what he had to say, the coy, almost flirty tone that Wilkes used stirred something in Sherlock's chest that he couldn't quite identify.
, do you know that?” Sneak complained, but a smile hovered on his lips. Playful. Something on Sherlock's face must have amused him, because he chuckled darkly. “Oh, Sig, are you jealous? Over something as trivial as a quickie in some teenager's bedroom? We didn't even last very long, and John was all safe and tucked away before anything happened. Locked up in his cozy little head-space, up here.” John's solid fingers tapped his temple lightly, and Sherlock scowled. His voice was questioning. Accusatory.
Sherlock found himself relaxing for the first time in nearly a month, half-hopeful despite himself that perhaps the worst had passed.
“But… in what way did Sherlock meeting Victor become a bad thing then? I mean, it brought him out, in the end…”
His crow of ecstatic realisation made Sherlock grin, although he didn't understand a word of what the boy was saying. For a moment, both children danced about each other, lost in the playful atmosphere that John's happiness seemed to naturally create. But it soon turned serious once more as John turned to look outside, noticing that the sun was already pinkening on the horizon. In the boy's head, he heard his grandmother's voice, whispering to him the tales and tricks of the underwater world far below.
John's throat was uncharacteristically tight. His stomach felt like it was twisting itself into tight knots, layer upon layer until his abdomen felt swollen with it. Like he had swallowed stones, it took John a while before he could speak evenly, and when he could he cringed as if the action burned him.
Any memories he may have had about a different song, a different ocean were buried deep, too far to find.
If he couldn't solve it, couldn't fix the problem, then as far as he was concerned, it never existed in the first place.
As if to punctuate that statement, the terrible cracking of splintering hinges echoed throughout the flat. It
“Remember, you have a duty.” His mother’s words brought him back to earth. She gently tilted her chin towards a gaggle of Hatchlings on the ground, still in their Human forms. Mycroft felt a twist of nerves as he realized they were all dressed in finery like himself.
He struggled to get enough air, the Dragon's grip only offering small streams of oxygen to reach his battered lungs. His vision became fuzzy at the edges despite his effort. John wondered for a moment what it would be like to die in such a gloomy way, killed his first day trying to train his Dragon because he was stupid and had felt pity for something that could eat him whole. Harry probably would mourn for a bit, but she tended to cope with sadness by drowning herself in spirits. Just like their Father. John would be nothing but the burning sensation of a bottle of Jack Daniels swishing down her throat.
Sherlock's grip around his arm was inescapable as he tugged John to his feet, pulling him to the little cave at the side of the beach with a firmness that the little boy couldn't hope to deny. There was an air of determination about the little creature, a kind of burning energy that made Sherlock's wolf-pale eyes glitter with fire as he led the way.
And Sherlock's wings tinged a brief and pleased pink right before they turned back to blue, before the Dragon steadily replied.
Daniel looked down at his hands then, and the twisting feeling in Sherlock’s chest became a bothersome knot. It took him a moment to recognise it for what it was, and when he did the apology did not come easily to his lips: It was black guilt. Guilt, and strange loss.
High above the village of Recheinbach, a heavy cloud hung at the edge of the gate. It was dark and cumulus, and in an otherwise clear sky, it stood out like a sore thumb, outlined by the silhouette of the sun beginning to set. On first appearance, said cloud didn't seem particularly innocuous. Rather it drifted alone in the sky, brooding and somewhat lonely, despite having two figures seated upon its mist. The two figures held remarkable likeness in the way in which they sat, facing one another from about a foot away with their legs folded. The first man had a carefully- combed shock of ginger-brown hair, his skin as pale as the light blue opulent robe which adorned him. Its fabric was the colour of frost upon a window-pane, his eyes a nearly colourless blue.
His arm shook, but it wasn't entirely with rage. It was with weakness, and he scowled at it and made it tighten on the young man's throat so that his uncooperative fingers wouldn't lose their resolve.
Sneak wasn't really looking at her, not any more. He was looking at white lab coats. Cold-eyed stares. Uncaring hands holding him down. Drunken yelling. Screaming.
It was automatic that he dragged Sherlock’s heavy mass to the small bathroom on the top floor, and then just logic to deposit the half-insensate Selkie into the porcelain blue tub.
“James, you know what mom said about invisibility magic.” James Moriarty. Yes, Mycroft’s assumptions had been right. He kept his face blank, but in truth he was a little surprised that the fire lord chieftan had brought the adopted Hatchling. Rumour had it that Marianna had taken in the Hatchling after her best friend had taken ill and passed. The child had been adopted into the family as an illegitimate son effectively, though the boy seemed as composed as any true blooded Dragon. Mycroft found the child’s stare unsettling in truth, but he forced a smile on his face. It would not do to be rude to a guest.
“It became a bad thing, Doctor Watson, as Victor didn’t simply die. He was murdered, and Sherlock heard of the case.”
John twists about and sees a rather high-strung looking girl smiling nervously at the doorway, her hair tied away from her face in a severe-looking ponytail. What the soldier didn't notice is in that instant Sherlock risked a peek up at the new man standing before him, eyes narrowing in silent calculation.
The thought rattled something in John, jerking him to a state of not-quite wakefulness. The image of the man before him seemed to shudder and shake before his eyes. The man before him seemed to frown, rolling his eyes.
?” He cut out, hands folding over each other. The detective didn't think about it, but it was a subconscious gesture to keep them from trembling in anger. The white-hot rage he could feel washing over him was strangely muted as he kept himself detached from his emotions, keeping a blank face so that he wouldn't feel the urge to throw something out of a window.
The bark of Sherlock's laugh is a surprising and warm sound, something that John doesn't expect but finds himself reacting to with a giggle of his own.
His voice was apparently neutral as he spoke to the man across from him, leaning on his hands. However, there was a feeling of tension between them not unlike the tightening of a coiled wire.
Quietly, his own thoughts finished for him. Piling up with the knowledge that John would most likely leave now. Once he realised how broken, how backwards his thinking was.
Hi there ^_^ I haven't updated in a while, but that would be due to moving around a fair bit :) I'm now in Canada. I hope you enjoy the new chapter, as a new character is introduced.
He was aware that Victor was peering at him closely, dark eyes uncertain. He seemed to be hemming and hawing over something, biting the inside of his cheek as if holding back a question that was prickling at the base of his neck. At Sherlock's unflinching stare, he seemed to finally bring himself to ask.
Secondly, John noticed that the Dragon had shrunken from its full form instinctively, and he caught a wisp of dark hair and pale skin laced with scars before a shifting blue-red wing hid the Monster's face from view. Subconsciously, John had been aware that he had picked a male, but it came to light more clearly by the strong outline of a muscular shoulder, leaning into his exposed hand so that John was inches away from touching where sinewy flesh met hard and unyielding scale. To feel the Dragon Shift was odd under his hands, because he could feel the bones under flesh shrinking and clicking into new order, not unlike a Rubik's cube being turned so that new sides were new colours. He marvelled silently at it, wondering to himself if he'd ever get to feel something like it ever again. The large, bat-like wings that his hand was inches away from quivered silently with the change.
Sherlock couldn’t seem to stop stroking his fingertips through the man’s closely-cropped hair that morning, noticing with some annoyance the small nicks and chips in the paint that still adorned his nails. Plum purple, it stuck out a bit like bruises, almost the same shade as the shiner the suspect had given John during their pursuit. The detective would remove the colour later, it no longer sitting completely right with him.
Sherlock smoothed his shirt and tucked his hands behind his back.  "John, this is Eric.  Eric, this is my flatmate John," Sherlock said awkwardly.
"I hope the heart wasn't too much," Sherlock said, referring to the third charm he had been hesitant to add.
"I'm going to get a drink," John said. He stood up and returned to his seat with scotch on the rocks.  He was going to need a drink to handle anymore of this night.
"Thanks.  I would've never expected Sherlock to throw me a surprise party.  No one's ever done that for me before," Eric said happily.
"I don't.  I thought after Janine it would've been fairly obviously by now that if I'm dating someone, it's for a case," Sherlock said.  He left the doorway to go sit in their living area.
"How would you know that?" John asked.  Sherlock wouldn't have done that to him.  He was better than that.  Eric was totally bluffing.
"I'm going out," John said, not even bother to put his jacket back on and making his way towards the door.
"He'll have water to drink and the salmon salad with Italian dressing and do hold the olives," Sherlock ordered.  He waited for Melanie to finish writing on her notepad before continuing.
“Of course I did.  He’s just like any other criminal.” Sherlock said.  John sighed.  He shyly held Sherlock’s hand.
Hi!  I hope you enjoyed the read.  A friend and I from the Sherlock Amino thought it'd be a funny and cute story idea to write a jealous John.  My friend created amazing artwork for it too!
Sherlock was lying on the couch very bored and staring up at the ceiling.  Eric wasn't available that day, and there weren't any interesting cases that caught his attention.  All he could do was sit there and wait for something to happen.
John had had enough.  He had heard enough.  Whether Sherlock liked it or not, he wasn't going to give up without a fight.  He couldn't just hand over the man he had been close with for years to some random sod.  Even if it pained him to know that Eric was definitely better than him.  Who was he kidding?  Eric was a dreamboat, and John was a pudgy hobbit.  But hell, he wanted to be Sherlock's pudgy hobbit.  So what?  He didn't have abs of steel or the perfect scruff.  John was the one who had been by Sherlock's side no matter what, through all the ups and the downs.
"You are lucky.  You already look handsome, and you don't even have this coat," Sherlock said as he gave Eric's hand a gentle squeeze.
It had been another long and boring day for Doctor John Watson.  Being a doctor was fun but usually when it was mixed with adventure.  A plain nine to five job wasn't as thrilling.  His favorite memory of helping someone in aid was when he helped the soldier presumed dead during a case.  The way Sherlock retold the story during his Best Man Speech couldn't begin to describe how thrilling it was to save a man's life under such pressure, even if he was very stressed about it.
“Come on John, I think we should see the actual crime scene now” he said angrily while grabbing John’s hand.  John was confused as to why they didn’t see the crime scene first, but he didn’t want to question Sherlock now, especially while he was still pissy.
John started to stare at Sherlock quizzically now, still not even aware what the case was about.  “What’s this case even about?” he asked out loud.  Sherlock was too busy trying to prepare himself for the case and didn’t respond to John.  This only irritated John.   “Sherlock I asked you a question” he said with slight ire in his voice.  Sherlock looked over at him.
The three approached the restaurant.  Eric opened the clear door with gold lining for his boyfriend.  Just as John started to walk through, Eric let go of the door and followed Sherlock.  Dick.  John sighed and squeezed through the small space before the door squished his hedgehog body.
“Then you two must have had your downs in your relationship.  I can tell by the way you look at each other that you’ve been through quite a lot.  Would you please come up to the class and perform the first scene?” the teacher requested.
Even Molly tried going on cases with Sherlock, and it didn't work.  John thought he was the only crime solving partner for Sherlock.  And here Sherlock was, easily replacing him with a taller, handsomer, and smarter male.  What was the point of crime solving together if he was going to be left out?  It hurt John to see how easily replaceable he was.
It was funny how Sherlock said fire exposed people's priorities, had saved John from a fire and was here treating him like utter rubbish.  Either Sherlock was lying, or he was a huge hypocrite.
“And…all those things I said back there…about how if you need someone I’m there…well…I meant it” he said.  John pulled him into a hug.
Lousily, John grabbed the door handle and pulled the door to reveal quite a bizarre sight.  Eyes widened, John gasped as he saw two fumbling men distancing themselves after they were clearly just kissing.  Sherlock Holmes was kissing someone.  And this someone was a man.  John didn't even know where to begin with his questions.
Clipped. Short. No real elaboration on that one. Okay. John takes a deep breath, a more loaded query coming to his lips.
A painful kind of tip-toe, the likes of which Sherlock normally would not have been able to tolerate under normal circumstances for a day, much less a week as it was coming to. Except this time, he found that he was the one instigating it, insisting upon mute contemplation of their respective meals. The detective stirred his cheerios again, hazarding after a moment to bring a spoonful to his lips. He could practically feel John's eyes upon him, burning a small hole into his skull. His flatmate sat across from him, own bowl in hand, yet there was less eating on John's side and more subtle glancing. Irritating. It was all so bloody
“I never asked your people to.” He scowled, shrugging off the responsibility. Mycroft sighed into his goblet, but John wasn’t having it.
“That... might either be a good idea or make things extraordinarily worse. It's not my place to say, but Sherlock's family... something happened when he came out to them. He doesn't speak to his Mum I know, and his Dad's never mentioned. The one time I tried to broach the topic he evaded and twisted out of the conversation like a bloody eel. Mycroft... I don't know how accepting he is of Sherlock. I know he cares to an extent... but from what I've seen of their relationship, I believe he once wasn't always so understanding.”
It seemed he would fail on both accounts. John suddenly couldn't abide by that. His jaw clenched, and though there were tears of fear and pain in his eyes, he looked the creature stubbornly in the eye. His voice was firm if a bit shrill, his arms curled defensively about his legs, expecting an attack at the slightest provocation.
When John had been very, very small his Mother had once bundled Harry and him into the best (and only) Winter clothes they'd owned, sneaking them past their Father as he snored drunkenly on the sofa and outside into the hushed night of Christmas Eve. He could remember how she tugged them along lightly, the smell of cinnamon cider still on her breath and a smile on her tired face that he didn't get to see very much in those days warming her eyes to a light blue.
He had sworn to himself to never debase himself for the sake of a Master again, but John was unlike any other Human Sherlock had yet to
Finally, the meeting was over, and just in time. John could take no more. He all but stalked out of the office, brushing past Seb’s secretary in his haste to leave so he could get some air. Sherlock chased after him without question, coat flapping behind him like a cape as he jogged to catch up to him. The detective’s hand reached out to stop John before he could run out of the bank completely, fingers digging into the fabric of his jacket and spinning him around so he could get a clear look of his face. Sherlock was relieved with what he saw, the worst having come to mind when he had seen John charge out of there.
These thoughts, only half-formed and the product of a sleep-deprived and stressed mind, felt unfamiliar to the soldier. He accounted it to the fact that he still felt sticky, unclean, despite the fact that he had scrubbed the blood off of his skin until his arms had been pink and chafed with hot water.
Sherlock thought spitefully, crossing his arms and rolling his eyes. They made him sound like a tyrant, not that he could admittedly find fault with their assessment of him. Humans tended to exaggerate tales at the best of times, and the one time he had unleashed his wrath on the village, it had brought chaos the likes of which this generation of villager had never seen.
His forehead pressed against his knees, Sherlock made a small sound of distress from the depths of his throat. A keening whimper. The thought of leaving hurt in a visceral, terrifying way, like drowning. It weighed on his chest heavy as a stone and made breathing a difficult task. And yet the Dragon couldn't fathom why. There had once been a time not so long ago when he would have sooner died than become some Human's pet, would have taken a thousand beatings if it meant at the end of the day he wore his chains with contempt and scorn.
doing his best, gasping through clenched teeth over the pain even as he desperately tried to fumble away John's hands.
The name was uttered like a small prayer, and though John didn’t know much about Gem history, he knew the name. He swallowed, suddenly wondering just how
In the end, it's the thing's low cries of fear that cause his pen to move. 'Cause his eyes to look over at the two beasts being loaded onto the trolley.
Mycroft hopped on a train still believing that his sister only needed time to work herself out, that she would eventually straighten things herself. After all, she seemed to have no desire for his aid since that morning at the beginning of the holidays. Rather, Shyla seemed stubbornly determined to survive without the help of either her sibling or her parents at all.
, it had a charming enough ring to it. Baker Street from what little John had seen he thought it looked like a nice enough neighbourhood. Low crime rate, and his clothes were considered worn but not shabby compared to the other people he had met. There was a really good Italian restaurant not too far away, and a Tesco's that had some pretty good sandwiches. John had eaten one on his way here, finishing off the last crust of ham and cheese just as he had bumped into the landlady, Mrs. Hudson.
a little girl, and have someone to play tag or hide and go seek with. She wanted someone other than her family members to know her.
“Yeah, Sherlock's here managed to nearly faint a few times on patrol, so I decided enough was enough and that it was time to check this place out.”
“You have a choice. You can use the shampoo to scrub the dirt out of your hair by yourself.... or if you want I can help you.... If I help you though there will be no complaining or biting or
Lying there on the tiled floor, already scooting himself out the door and away before the police came looking for him, the Doctor hadn't been sure whether to laugh or to perhaps begin to sob.
Gentle, not something he would normally do around the army doctor, who appreciated bluntness and cruelty to beautiful lies.
“We broke the deal.” She murmured, eyes nervous as they flicked about “We broke it but it wasn’t our fault. Wasn’t, promise!” Huge, pleading eyes turned to Sherlock, willing for him to understand, to see. The man’s eyebrows lowered in concentration, and he was careful to keep his voice low, non confrontational even as he admitted
Benson sighed, and it was a long, drawn out exhalation that spoke of endless patience and overstrained hours. He spared one more glance at his Dragon; Farrow, before casting his gaze to the huddling mass by Kabir’s feet. His expression was deeply unimpressed, even as his shoulders slumped in acquiescence. When he spoke, it was with the finality of a man knowing he had lost.
It was no compliment. Rather, more like a spear lanced through the doctor's heart. The cutting depth of the man's voice was ice, but John did not shy away from it, his jaw instead tightening minutely. Slowly, he took a deep breath, letting the words slide over him without drawing blood. When Sherlock was embarrassed, he was fundamentally cruel, and the army doctor had known it from day one. Sally Donovan alone was proof of that, Sherlock's venomous observations that first night obviously from personal slight and annoyance.
This chapter's mostly from Mycroft's point of view, and offers some more insight into their somewhat damaged dynamic. Warnings for a lot of misgendering in this chapter.
“Even I have to eat, James.” Sherlock replied neutrally, tilting his curled head in an almost reptilian way. From behind Moriarty, the Demon thought he saw the human twitch, likely responding to some unseen horror within his mind.
Faerie tales disappeared and were replaced with medical textbooks and the bone structure of a Human skeleton. Apple juice became hot coffee, and bedtime tuck-ins became a melody of gunfire as John signed up for the army. The sounds of the ocean faded away for the sounds of desert, of hot sand underneath his feet, and of Afghani wildlife humming deep into the night. John grew up, became a man that could wade through blood as well as sand without thought, caught up in the pounding of his heart and the thrum of adrenaline in his veins. He knew the song of the desert like the back of his hand, could recite the waves of dust that came in from the west and blew to the east, swirling and curving over their barracks.
“Frankly no, I didn't pick up on it. However there were clues looking back. I noticed that John's dominant hand kept switching, but wrote it off as ambidexterity. He doesn't smoke of course, and he keeps his phone away from his keys if he can help it. Little things, habits that make up you and not him. In retrospect I was a fool for not seeing it.”
But even as it cried out its claim, familiar hands were scooping John into their arms. His dad's voice was warm and wet, begging for him to open his eyes even as he screamed for his mum to call an ambulance. John wanted to wake, but he felt as if his body was made of lead. Heavy and lethargic, he barely managed to utter a small groan. He could feel his father's warmth, seeming to suck whatever cold had leached into John's bones out even as he rocked him gently and murmured reassurances. Hazily, John registered that his dad's voice didn't sound angry like he had expected. Rather, he sounded afraid.
