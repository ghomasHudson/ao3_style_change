John laughed and leaned forward, pressing his lips chastely against Sherlock’s. “That’s strictly hypothetical. Forget next year, then maybe by then I will have thought of something.”
“Exactly. The scene is still sealed of. His wife is being taken care of by the family. There’s another thing.”
Sherlock clenched his jaw. “Has that been your plan all along? Forcing me to lie just so you can have the upper hand? That was quite risky.”
“So nice to have you back. And just in time for the holidays!”
John moved his bed into a more practical sitting position as Vanessa left, who had dropped off his breakfast. There was fruit, yogurt, and toast, but John doubted he’d be able to eat all of it. He reached for the fruit and started with the grapes. It was slow chewing and took a while for John to finish. As he swallowed the last grape, the door opened.
“C’mon. I’m starving.”
“Hang in there, John.” Sholto’s voice was softer, and John gazed into his piercing blue eyes, and then he suddenly felt weightless.
“Ooh—y-ooh—,” John stuttered and inhaled sharply. He saw Sherlock’s eyes widen, and then he slowly nodded.
A bit of angst and emotional John -- don't worry it'll lighten up soon!
“No—”
Warning: language...not much else, oh, and angst of course.
“We’re going to go into the operating room now, Watson.”
“Can I help you?” John asked.
thought as his body shattered through the glass window.
“Better?”
“Sally,” Lestrade turned to the woman. “Talk to Kingston. See if he can give some names. I’ll get a narcotics team to inspect the room Sherlock found.”
“Would you like tea?”
Starting to panic, Sherlock crept closer until he was right beside him. John’s right arm sleeve was stained red, which looked alarmingly like blood.
“John—.”
“I don’t think I’ve seen you here before,” the man said, confidence strikingly bold in his voice. Sherlock kept his stare in front of him, and he responded, simply to drive the man away with a lack of reciprocating the interest.
“No,” Sherlock almost snapped. He squeezed John’s hand, and then let it go. “Get some rest. I’ll get you some water.”
The pair sat in front of Willoughby in similar positions from all those months ago, with John behind Sherlock and Willoughby behind a computer screen.
“More than a friend?” Dr. Smith’s tone hitched slightly, and John could tell what he really was asking. He stood up roughly and headed out the door, preparing to slam it.
The heart rate went flat into a long beep.
“St. Bart’s,” Sherlock said to the driver.
“Must I?”
John squeezed Sherlock hands. “What happened?” John asked tiredly. “How’d we get out?”
“I think John could have a break. Five minutes?”
Dmitri showed up every now and then, his visits growing farther apart, probably because he was nearly completely healed as short term injuries go.
Mycroft sighed. “I’ll have people look into it, but if we didn’t come up with anything before, it’s unlikely we will even if he’s dead.”
“Don’t worry, I won’t kill him. At least, I’m not planning on it just yet.”
John pulled back. “I’m going to fall asleep again.”
The minute the last syllable was spoken, a rush of relief flooded John and he let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding. He smiled and found Sherlock to be staring at him, unblinking and somewhat expressionless apart from the slight furrow in his brow. The smile slowly dropped to an awkward grin, and John looked away, his hand loosely falling out of the other man’s grasp.
Outside, it had stopped raining. Sherlock went to the far railing and looked across to the docks. Hidden in the shadows, he found the sign he needed: Mycroft had found them!
John’s eyes widened and he pushed the form away. “No—. No don’t…please.” He begged. Sherlock gripped his hand.
The man whimpered again and kept his eyes clothes.
Now it was the man who replied challenging. “You’ll love me.”
John shook himself out of his thoughts and followed Sherlock out the door.
other.”
John’s grin widened as Sherlock wheeled inside. John followed, and then they were lifted up to their flat.
John opened his eyes and coughed, clearing his throat. He was surprised of Sherlock’s presence.
“John—.”
“He’s on his way.” Mycroft sighted Sherlock’s appearance and looked at the doctor for an explanation. She repeated herself, and he too tensed up.
“Mycroft just got the update. I’m surprised you got it first,” Sherlock said to Lestrade.
can’t forgive myself…”
Sherlock looked at him for a moment longer, and then he seemed to accept John’s response. He lifted the tape for John, and then followed him under it and went towards the crime scene.
Sherlock turned on his heal and walked away, only to glance behind his shoulder for a quick look. John’s face was still lit up by what he had been planning on saying, but as Sherlock walked farther down the hall, John’s face fell from disappointment to acceptance as quickly as the former first appeared.
Sherlock tightened his jaw, and just as John looked back at Victor, Victor nodded, looking understanding.
“Well that’s embarrassing.”
John exhaled. “All right.”
“Timeline?”
He paused and turned around. “Next time, will you come?”
“But now this one hurts my taste buds.”
, 2014
“With Dr. Willoughby,” John said.
Sherlock took it, and read the front.
“Well, no. I just…want you to be absolutely sure. Are you?”
Sherlock walked closer. “Let him rest,” he offered quietly. The two women seemed to have thought for a moment, but then they nodded, and gently helped John back into bed. He lied against the pillow and closed his eyes, his body shivering from the cold and pain.
“Starving.” John smiled, and kissed him again, feeling Sherlock’s grin against his.
“As will I,” Mycroft clarified firmly.
But John also knew the psychological associations the human body can have. When a dog attacks someone at a young age, it’s logical to fear dogs after that. But John didn’t fear Sherlock…just his touch. It sent shivers down his spine and pain through his leg. He would recognize the touch for only a second and then be filled with memories of pain and would only feel that in an intensified way. He couldn’t feel the love anymore—the affection, the caresses, the musical hands, the scientific analysis when observing…he couldn’t feel Sherlock anymore!
“Er, yes but he died of a heart attack.”
He cupped John’s jaw, and tilted it upwards. John met his gaze, giving up with resisting. Gentle blue eyes met his, enhanced with tiny splotches of light brown and green. John embraced the caress, and leaned into Sherlock’s palm.
He blinked up to see Victor whispering to Sherlock. He focused, and managed to catch a few phrases as he caught his breath back.
“Can you…” John trailed off, hoping he was clear enough. Sherlock raised the newspaper and covered his face completely.
, 2014. No attacks were attempted, as information was recovered in time and was stopped. The two primary suspects, Watson and Stan, fled and were unattainable.
“YOU FUCKING ARSEHOLE, A SORRY EXCUSE FOR A BLOODY DOCTOR!” John pulled Willoughby up by the color, and then slammed his forehead against his face, feeling his nose break and spurt blood.
“John,” Sherlock whispered, “then why don’t we do something we’ve never done before?”
“Take me back to the house,” Sherlock said as he started to wheel himself back to the path. John hesitated for moment, not expecting Sherlock’s tone, and then hastily packed up.
“There’s going to be anther attack.” John whispered, and then looked around again. “I can’t say anything more. Please, leave,” he insisted in a low voice.
for updates, hints, discussions, and if you have questions/concerns: watsonsanatomy.tumblr.com
John met Lestrade’s gaze, who gave him a nod.
Sherlock was facing him, his face nearly touching John’s. Everyone around them seemed to fade, and bright lights illuminated Sherlock’s head.
4:59:58 PM
Sherlock froze in his step and inhaled sharply.
“It’s most likely his kidneys…!”
“Because you’re you. You’ll find a way. And if you can’t, then I will.”
John stood up and stumbled away towards the window. He stopped halfway, his body shaking and shuddering. Sherlock hoped he had realized he wasn’t a hallucination, but then John spoke and that hope drowned.
Cars packed the driveway, and Sherlock led him to an empty one. John sat inside and Sherlock followed, closed the door, and then they were driving away. Sherlock was oddly silent, and John started to fear he was in a dream, or dead.
John’s eyes widened slightly. “Oh, I’m s-sorry, I d-didn’t mean to p-pry—”
“Why would I be bothered?” Sherlock shot back, his temper rising slightly against his will. He was uncomfortable and if bothered was the word of the day, then yes he was, but he didn’t know why exactly and certainly didn’t want John to know.
“Whenever I leave you tend to get worse.” Sherlock had meant to sound light, but his voice broke, and he looked away.
know it!”
“Oh but you did. You knew the minute John had recalled Moran being part of his kidnapping. But Moran wasn’t there, he’s being framed as well.”
John cringed at the repeated words, and forced himself not to look at Sherlock.
“Well of course,” Regina confessed. “It wasn’t much of a challenge.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John looked taken aback for a mere second. “Well it’s partially true. But I corrected her so…”
But now there was a minute tremble going down his body, and the sweat over his forehead was back.
“A picnic? Really, John?” Sherlock pointed out.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, John,” she said with an encouraging smile. She left, and then Sherlock stepped forward, grinning.
“No it’s…fine.”
“So we have to stay here then. Until it’s all over.”
John stared at him, stunned for a moment. Dr. Bailey smiled gently.
“That was a lucky shot,” John murmured.
Sherlock glanced at his watch. 4:42.
As everything settled, John let out a breath he hadn’t realizing he was holding. From what he could tell, Mycroft and the driver were talking, something about needing backup and an incoherent response from a radio.
of November, 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The time is now 5:53 PM. Go ahead and start John.”
John parted his lips wider, and moaned as Sherlock deepened the kiss. His lips moved almost methodically, yet with utter, pure affection.
“The elevator one doesn’t show anything; there aren’t any in the stairwells.” Sally reported. “There aren’t any figure prints on the railing; we’re looking at the bullet shells now. It’s likely though he may be a professional.”
John scoffed and turned back towards Sherlock. He wanted to scream at him to wake up, he wanted to cry, thinking maybe that will catch Sherlock’s attention, or something. He wanted his noise back, his presence, and him sleeping like this, like he was perfectly alive was making this entire situation seem like a bad dream, or a joke. John found he couldn’t quite breathe, so he turned on his heal and left the room without another word.
Shillcott stared at him. “I told you about that a couple of months ago…”
Mycroft shrugged. “Scouting the place? Ensuring his new contacts and waiting for the right moment? It doesn’t matter now, he has been sighted which suggests he’s ready to come out of hiding and perhaps…lure your attention to him.”
“If you really…care about him, I’m happy for you. You two do seem like a good match,” John said.
“What I tell him doesn’t concern you.” Sherlock proclaimed, his voice booming as he marched out the door and out of sight.
Mycroft handed Sherlock the folder. “John’s identified with Bradley Stan, an ex-American intelligence agent currently wanted for treason, terrorism, and murder. They’re photographed together on numerous occasions.”
John shifted in the bed, and Sherlock quickly sat up and looked at him. John stilled, and then his head moved slightly, and a raspy groan escaped his throat.
John hurried inside, and rushed forward. Sherlock was on the floor by the window, unmoving.
CHAPTER 12
John shook his head without opening his eyes. The pain was increasing, and he just wanted a distraction, but he had been sleeping far too often, it was becoming incredibly boring. He could hear Sherlock hover by the bed, slowly starting to pace.
Sherlock clenched his jaw and brought his fist to his chin and lower lip as he looked out the window. “I don’t know.”
Mrs. Hudson entered the living room. “There’s a cab here for you, Sherlock. Oh what a mess, what are they looking for?”
******************************************************************************
“Can you look into Willoughby’s past for me. See if he owns any kind of business or is getting paid besides from his practice.”
“John’s fever has increased, and his immune system is weakened. He’s showing signs of the flu, so we’ve given him some basic antibiotics but his body has yet to show a reaction. It could be the drug slowing down the process, or the drug itself is doing all this and making his recovery occur at a slower rate.”
“So long—.”
Sherlock knew exactly how John felt about him; just last month he had walked out of the shower and bumped into John. The army doctor stuttered an apology as his cheeks blushed an embarrassing pink shade. Sherlock didn’t think much of it, until he was forced to take his shirt off for John to clean a knife wound he had received a few hours later. The doctor had blushed again, and Sherlock was flattered, and amused. Since then, he had been purposely showing off his body to his blogger, and in turn, received an adorable blushing doctor failing at his attempt to hide his expressive face.
“You know what,” his brother said gravely. “I suppose it would have made you more
Moran released the glass shard from the fatal point, his other hand still holding John’s neck. As soon as the piece was well away from his artery, John swung his free hand with a shard in hand and plunged it into the side of Moran’s neck, and then twisted.
“Which means I have a few days to get you a present.” Sherlock smirked.
Mary stood up and left. John watched her go, and caught her reflection in a mirror as she passed by. She was smiling.
Sherlock grinned slightly. “Indeed. Thank you for…” he trailed off, and glanced at John before meeting Jack’s eye. “Everything.”
“Sherlock,” Molly said firmly.
John chuckled. “I didn’t think you’d be so…” His brows furrowed in concentration for the right word.
“John—!”
John looked at Sherlock, who shrugged. Getting the hint, he headed outside the backdoor. “I’ll go for a walk then.”
Sherlock’s tapping ceased completely and he moved closer. John squeezed his eyes shut, overcome by intolerant pain.
John met his eyes, and Sherlock inhaled sharply. John’s eyes were red rimmed and his face was grey and puffy; he had stubble along his jaw, and a small prick on his cheek, bleeding slightly.
Not wanting to debate about it, John prepared Sherlock’s tea and brought it over to the counter. He arranged the crutches so that both of them were now under his right arm. It wasn’t ideal, but it seemed to work.
Sherlock softened his face. “Rest for now—.”
“Wait, hold on—.”
“Oh God no…” He mumbled.
“Anything else, John?” Sherlock asked gently.
John inhaled as much as he could as he turned towards Sherlock. He opened his eyes and let out a shaky breath. Sherlock smile at him, relief flooding him now that John was awake.
“No, Sherlock. Stop. Listen to me. I—” John began walking towards the building. Sherlock panicked.
Sherlock did hope that this doctor—John—would stay long-term. He seemed to have enjoyed following the detective around London in search of a serial killer. Maybe he’ll tag along to other cases. Maybe they could be friends—
Sherlock hesitated. “Do you still want the room? I’d understand if you—.”
John blushed. “I never deemed you to be such a snuggler.” Sherlock backed away just a fraction.
“Sorry—.”
He had heard those words before.
John shrugged whilst looking at the floor. He didn’t trust himself to speak, and wasn’t even entirely sure he wanted to talk at the moment, as he was a little afraid what would slip out.
John remained standing. He was looking at Sherlock intently, his fists clenching slightly as if angry but his face was conveying both bewilderment and…was that affection?
“Of course. I had usable information at hand so the hospital wouldn’t sue you for interfering.” Mycroft said, his tone becoming sterner by the last word.
Chapter 10
“John you’re bleeding—” Sherlock said, but was gently pushed away by the John.
The man fell backwards, and remained still. John stumbled to the door and banged hard.
John sighed and slowly fell into a light doze, feeling awfully lonely.
“You had a seizure.” Sherlock responded with his head tilted down.
“Mhm?” John was looking in his eyes; his own glistened like the depths of green forests with patches of blue shadows. “God, you’re so beautiful…”
“If I’m sure or not to be in a relationship with you John. Of whether or not I want to with you, which I would think was fairly obvious excluding the fact that I froze when you first kissed me but that is a normal reaction is it not? Other than that I would have believed it to be obvious. Have I taught you nothing?” Sherlock said, attempting to lighten the mood.
John sighed heavily, a nagging feeling coming back to him.
John gasped and his vision came into sudden focus. He looked up at Sherlock, who was looking down at him with a tremendous amount of concern. He inhaled shakily, and slowly started to feel enough oxygen enter his body. Sherlock’s hand was on his back and rubbing it in soothing circles. John focused on the feel of his lover’s hand against his bare back, and breathed in slowly. His other senses slowly came back to his awareness, and he continued to calm down.
Sherlock furrowed his brows in thought. That was enough of an answer for John, so he took Sherlock’s hand and headed to the bathroom. He turned on the shower and Sherlock immediately hopped in, but then turned to John, raising an eyebrow.
“Erm, my office would like a copy of his statement before Moran proceeds with the interrogation.”
Moran kept his gun aimed at Sherlock’s neck, at an odd angle according to John. He raised his other hand and held it in a stop gesture. Sven paused by the door, still gripping John tightly.
“It’s not the tumor, it’s you. You HAPPENED TO ME!”
John tried to push him away but was starting to slide down, so if Sherlock left he would fall, but he really didn’t want Sherlock here right now. His stump started to ache, and then John cracked.
“John!”
The next morning, John woke up early to an empty bed. Sherlock’s side of the bed was cold, so John assumed Sherlock hadn’t slept much during the night—if at all. Putting on his robe, John strolled into the kitchen, only to find it empty.
“Er, Donovan was just explaining. Must have been dreadful, two pills.”
“John!”
Sherlock furrowed his brows. “John?”
Mary stepped forward and punched in her code; Sherlock caught it and remembered it, for later use.
Their boat was still moving into the center of the second boat. John pulled himself upright and attempted to gain his footing, when suddenly there was a loud crack. He looked up to see the mast of the second ship sway; the sail and boom going with the wind and circling back towards them. The mast leaned dangerously towards the side, towards John. John leapt up and limply sprinted away. Mere seconds later his spot was crushed by the falling pole. The boat shook harshly. John lost his footing and fell to his side against the cabin roof. He looked up just in time to see Fletcher running at him, red-faced, with the murder weapon in his hand.
John’s body was bolted with the charge and then fell limp, the heart monitor continued in a flat line.
Dr. Shepherd nodded to John sympathetically. “It’s normal for loved ones to avoid their significant others at times like this. It’s a kind of coping mechanism.”
John looked at him, raised an eyebrow, urging him to just say it, whatever it was going to be. John knew he wasn’t ready, and would never be.
“So she’s not part of this?”
John leaned forward and rested his arms on the mattress. Sherlock was sound asleep, his eyes flickering as if he was dreaming. John wondered what about, and hoped it was good. His eyes started to droop, and he drifted off with his head lying on his arms.
John shook his head. “I’m fine. Do I just wait until they arrest me or…”
“You try loosing a limb and see how easy it is to get up in the morning—”
“But it could be the drug from the bullet.” Sherlock pointed out.
John glanced at Sherlock. “Sherlock I’m…sorry,” he said, although it sounded like a question, as if he didn’t know if he should be apologizing, since he didn’t know how Sherlock would be reacting and whether or not he would want one.
“I know…”
Obviously avoiding John’s eyes now, Sherlock shifted in his seat and unlike him, he clumsily stood up and left the bedside, speaking as he walked away. “I’d better get the doctor. He said he wanted to talk to you once you were awake.”
John pulled off his jacket before answering. “They ran some tests, a CT, you know, that sort of stuff.” John hesitated on the threshold into the kitchen, and continued, however avoiding Sherlock’s gaze with his back towards him. “The tumor’s back.” John said simply. “A bit was left behind last time, which isn’t unheard of. I haven’t scheduled the surgery yet; it’ll be whenever Shepherd’s available I guess.”
The footsteps from the other direction stopped abruptly, and before he could stand back up, Sherlock found himself staring at John’s feet.
Sherlock was stretched out on the couch, fingers pressed under his chin, his mind going over and over that…compliment. He was baffled, not over the fact that his abilities were
“Jesus, Sherlock…”
“I need a shirt, and you need one too. And pants and shoes.”
John stared at Mycroft, who stared back. John clenched his jaw angrily.
“Are those the journals?”
John watched Victor and Sherlock part, and furrowed his eyebrows. He stiffly headed back to his bed, his back and head continuing to ache. The doctor had said to take it easy, and he had been reluctant to listen, motivated by his improvement in the past few days. The past few hours however, were a bit disheartening. John climbed into bed and pulled the covers over his body, just as hesitant footsteps entered his room.
John was angry. Burrowed deep inside for too long, an evil kind of hatred towards Moriarty and all the pain he inflicted upon John had erupted, and all John wanted now was to kill Moran.
“Ow, what—.”
“Ah?” Sherlock asked?
*            *            *
John inhaled raggedly and slowly slit his eyes open. He focused on Sherlock, and then blinked a few times before opening them wider.
“They won’t believe you and then just arrest you anyway. They’re trained agents, John, they know ways to manipulate you, to get you to say things you don’t mean. It’s best if you get the rest you need, and drag this on as far as possible. The more time you have, the more time I have to prove your innocence.”
Hope swelled in his chest, causing more pain but John ignored it this time. The warmth came back, and this time, it lingered on his lips.
Sherlock exhaled roughly and cleared his throat. He blinked a few times and flickered his gaze to John. “I need you to understand that I did this—,”
“Oh God no…” John whispered.
Updates should be back to once a week, or less.
“I know that!” Sherlock snapped.
He looked up at Molly and grinned sleepily. “Molly, what can I do for you?”
“What’s his temp?”
“Well, George wrote his suspicions down, and there’s Canterbury’s missing benzos that don’t add up with how much he was selling, so it’s logical to assume he put them in the paracetamol, which was distributed to the Ellis’.”
Sherlock tightened his arms around him and buried his face into John’s neck.
“John, help is here. Do you hear that?”
“What the hell is this?” Sherlock asked with a grimace.
“No problem.” Dr. Shepherd nodded and grinned, and then turned on his heal and left, with one last call back. “Call me on what you decide. I’ll get the nurse to discharge you.”
John gave him a wider smile. “Well I am. I’ll probably have some water and then go back to sleep. You can question him, and then come back to tell me.”
“Whose we?” Sherlock responded before he could stop himself. His throat was sore, but it didn’t hurt to talk. It was the most he had spoken since…well since this entire stay, and he could feel John looking at him.
“Yes!”
******************************************************************************
he thought.
John narrowed his eyes at him. “You think…because of a case, I ended up like this. You don’t want me to come along anymore!?” John gasped.
John paused behind the detective. Sherlock could sense unease in his stance, yet despite this, John raised his free hand and rested it on Sherlock’s shoulder: a silent thank-you-and-lets-not-talk-about-it gesture. It was over as quickly as it started. Clearing his throat, John dropped his arm and continued his way to his armchair.
He walked up to Sherlock, who was in his chair reading the paper. He shuffled his feet, revealing he was anxious about something. Sherlock looked up from the paper, raising an eyebrow.
Last chapter will come next week, or sooner. The next part is Watson's Anatomy and that'll come as soon as possible, although I'm not sure when exactly, but I'll let you know when I post chapter 5.
John stared at him, taken aback, and then he let out a small laugh. Sherlock’s mouth twitched with a grin, and then went back to his food. John sat down in his chair and began eating, feeling a little better than he expected.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “No? Vic—,”
Sherlock nodded. “The man, Ronald Silken, wants to finish the story. When you told me some of the stories, well, Hansel and Gretel was one of them, but Silken chose a different one. It seems to be Snow White, but without an actual apple.” Sherlock’s tone had lightened, and John offered a small smile.
John shook his head, wincing from the sudden throb of pain shooting down his body.
Sherlock stared at Liev. “He’s the man who recruited you.”
John glared at him softly. “It’ll look nice once the flowers bloom. If they bloom that is. Some were already planted and growing, and I found some packets of seeds underneath the table. I thought we could plant them together, if you like? Or you could just watch…” John looked at Sherlock, his posture withdrawn with hesitation. He clearly was bored to do something, and at least this was that something, however dull it would likely turn out to be.
Sherlock tensed up and slowly looked at him. “There isn’t a mask—.”
John looked into his eyes, and then leaned forward.
He sighed softly and looked at the cup, signally for more. Sherlock obliged, and continued to feed him. John ate the entire cup of applesauce smoothly, and by the time he was done, he was on the verge of another long nap.
John stilled, and reluctantly let go of Sherlock’s hand, dropping his own into his lap.
into their bedroom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John didn’t know he had returned until he walked into his room, leaning heavily on the forearm crutches. He had managed to walk to the nurse’s station twice, and was feeling more confident than he had ever during the past two weeks, although he was now exhausted, and actually wanted a short nap.
John furrowed his brows. “I—.”
John’s eyes widened slightly and his blushed slightly. Sherlock ignored the two of them.
“Or bad news?”
“Good to see you too Inspector.” Sherlock mocked. “What is it this time?”
Lestrade was in his chair, and Sherlock was pacing in front of him. Sherlock turned to John, and only glanced at him before facing back to Lestrade.
Sherlock nodded and then took another hesitant step forward until he was close enough he could wrap an arm around his blogger. But he didn’t.
The hallucination of Sherlock evaporated, and John let out a piercing shriek, tears suddenly crashing down his cheeks.
“John Watson. Old friend of mine,” Mike offered.
“I do.”
“Oh my God!” John stepped away and slouched into a desk chair. He placed his head between his knees and breathed deeply. “You—.”
“No—.”
“I understand he had been wearing a mask, impersonating Watson,” Moran stated.
Sherlock thought. Panicking but acting quickly, Sherlock headed into their bathroom. He started to fill the tub and once it was tolerable, he ran back to the room. John was unconscious, and muttering under his breath. Sherlock nearly dragged John into a standing position, and then led him to the bathroom. He set John on the edge of the tub, and reached down to check the temperature of the water. It was just about lukewarm. Sherlock helped John back onto his feet.
They were close, closer than Sherlock realized. John was tilting his head up just a bit to be able to meet the taller man’s eyes. Sherlock’s throat suddenly felt tight, and he couldn’t form a word.
. John realized.
“Go ahead,” John offered, although he had no idea what Sherlock was going to do.
“As I was saying,” Mycroft continued. “You’ll be transferred in a few days. If you want they can have you sleep through it, as it is quite far. As for you John, you’ll be watched by a team everyday until the situation is dealt with—.”
He dropped his voice to a whisper and looked down. “You’re here for me.” John raised his head and saw that Sherlock was just staring at the ground, his eyes unfocused but his brows creased, showing that he was thinking.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t leave,” Sherlock began. “Please. It was just a thought. I know you love me John, but—.”
John stayed in bed for the rest of the day, and slept a few hours periodically. He didn’t eat, and wasn’t even hungry. Sherlock didn’t come in, and as midnight came and passed, he still hadn’t come back. John had no idea if he was even home.
Movement in the hall caught John’s eye, and then Sherlock appeared, following Margaret to his room. Sherlock caught his eye through the door and barrier, but his face remained impassive, apart from the slightest clench of the jaw.
John laughed humorlessly. “Oh so now you want my help?”
John retrieved two mugs from the cabinet and prepared their tea. Once it was ready, he went into the sitting room, and sat down on the edge of the sofa by Sherlock’s thighs. He set the mugs down on the coffee table and leaned forward, resting his hand on one of Sherlock’s legs. He pressed a light kiss on Sherlock’s forehead.
John shuffled his feet. “It's meant for athletes, the wheels are slanted and made for faster speed and it's easier to brake, and very light too, so I could carry it up the stairs.”
“John?”
“The connection of the two?” Moran asked.
John was immediately placed into an interrogation room, but Sherlock didn’t keep quiet. He protested as he was ushered into the conference room; Mycroft appeared and walked up to Moran and Sherlock. Kim and Ms. Sinclair remained at the conference table, whispering a little but paying attention at the same time.
“I know that.” The detective responded curtly. “I just…can’t see anything but—.”
Sherlock’s eyes flickered.
Okay, so here it is. Warning: it gets a bit angst and it quite short. The next chapter will come around Monday- the latest Friday.  I don't own Derek Shepherd, he belongs to Shonda Rhimes and ABC.
“Just a seizure. You should expect a lot of these now.”
“Mary—MARY!!” John twisted violently against the jacket. He moved side to side several times, when suddenly pain erupted in his left shoulder and he twisted off the cot, falling backwards and landing on his back.
“Took you long enough.” Sherlock remarked. Before his brother could reply, he continued. “What do you want now?”
“Sorry, I—.”
“It could be a while…”
“John?”
John stiffly nodded as his eyes drooped.
Sherlock nodded against him. “I know. But it’s been on your mind since we got the case.”
John narrowed his eyes and fidgeted. “Fine.” His attitude was different than it was just a few minutes ago—a drastic drop that exhausted John.
“Quite right.” Sherlock murmured and grinned. John kissed him softly on the lips and then left the bedroom.
“Have you eaten?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock gritted his teeth and shuffled his feet, directing his gaze to the wall behind John and hesitantly flickering over his face. “It’s not the same. Nothing is the same.” He sighed aggravatingly and started to pace. John exhaled sharply and took a few steps closer.
Early the next morning, John was on the ventilator. Sherlock was sitting on the edge of the bed, and gently shaving John’s face, going around the blue tubes attached to the clear tube in his mouth. It wasn’t unusual for John to still be asleep, but Sherlock was already becoming antsy.
“Excuse me,” a small voice spoke from behind.
The walls of this room were completely bare and a horrible white hue. At least in his old room, there was a window. John turned his head to the door. There was a door, but there wasn’t a window on it; it was just a plain door with what looked like at least two locks on it.
John furrowed his eyebrows to himself, unsure about that phrase. He knew how to speak; he just forgot the technicalities.
Sherlock took a step back, and then stopped. He walked forward and lightly kissed John’s forehead, before stepping back, taking in John’s reaction.
like himself.
There was a settle knock, and then Mrs. Hudson appeared by John’s chair.
*         *         *
Sherlock sighed and looked at his lover. “The drugs—.”
“John…”
“Just a few minutes,” Sherlock replied with a very slight put out tone. “But it turns out that Canterbury filled out the prescriptions from Ellis’ doctor.”
“Case?” John asked hoarsely.
Sherlock lost track of time and before he knew it there was a knock at his door. John opened it enough to peer inside, but he didn’t walk in right away. He remained silent in the doorway, his face half covered by the door.
“Dammit, no! Get it, I don't care how, just—,”
“Next time I plan to take you oh so slowly and make you feel so good for hours.” John whispered against Sherlock’s lips, his voice deepening the last few words.
John straightened up and slowly turned around. He kept his eyes to the ground, forcing himself to avoid Sherlock’s face. He took the jacket and murmured a ‘thanks’, but didn’t put it on.
*            *            *
“They decided to wait a bit, since he’s sleeping now from the small sedative—.”
Sherlock nodded and then entered the room. Without a word, he closed the door and then sat down, relaxing his body and leaning against the chair idly.
“I know.” Victor sighed, and squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder, and then he left the two alone.
“Everyone is, except Moran. There are some wearing a face mask, so they all look like John.”
Sherlock tensed beside him. John glanced at him and then quickly looked away, already expecting what he saw.
“Why can’t you just tell me and let me decide that for myself?”
“There were still flinches!” Sherlock spat, almost sounding like a child, although John knew it was more to do with the reason for the flinches.
John swallowed and pressed his forehead against Sherlock’s. “I know. And I love you for that. You’re the most human—human being that I’ve ever known. And I’m not leaving. No matter what.”
Sherlock bathed in John’s fresher attitude, but didn’t say anything, and instead, earned a warm smile from the man opposite the table.
Sherlock shrugged again. “He was with me sometimes.”
John looked at him and then went to the end of the bed. He lifted up the bag where the tube was attached to so Sherlock could see it.
Next chapter comes later tomorrow, if it ever will, yet comments will always make my day a whole lot better :)
*            *            *
Inside, John walked in but came to a hesitated pause as he eyed the stairs. Sherlock stopped behind him, and John could sense he was about to lift his hand up to hold him from the back, so he quickly lifted his crutches and placed them on the step.
Sherlock’s eyes flickered. “Alex will be here shortly. Are you going to do the stretches in those?”
*            *            *
Sherlock nodded. “Friends, yeah.”
“I’m not involved.”
what John feels for me, but I know for sure that I’m his friend. We care for each other.”
He couldn’t—wouldn’t—address this sentiment by its name.
“Wait!”
But the simple idea of just ending this friendship with John seemed out of the question. What they had was good—really good. They were starting to become very good friends, probably even best friends if John were to categorize it. This was just a bump in the road; it didn’t mean anything.
Sherlock looked at him and then slowly leaned back into his chair. He didn’t say anything anymore, and John took it as the moment had passed. He let out his breath, sat back down, and started to read, noticing Sherlock reaching for his book on beekeeping. He asked him if he wanted more tea, but Sherlock didn’t respond.
John shook his head, understanding Lestrade’s meaning. “No, he’s not. I better go after him. Hopefully he’s going back home.”
“I already told Lestrade to question him, before we go over there. If he says anything before we get there, then we investigate it.”
“Good, then let’s—.”
Sherlock shrugged. He had eaten a little at the hospital, and they reluctantly let him go despite his lacking appetite.
“Would you do the honors?”
His grasped weakened generously and blood spurred out freely, gurgling out his neck and mouth onto John and the floor. Within the minute, he was dead.
John laughed softly and shook his head. “I should, but I think I’ll pass out from starvation first before exhaustion. Lead the way.”
“This should kick in soon. You may be asleep by then.”
“Hello.” Sherlock said instead of his normal answering greeting of his name.
1:59:57 AM
John became startled and looked at Sherlock. “I don’t want h-elp—.”
John laughed.
John fell into a light doze before he could come up with a plan, and slowly drifted off into a restless sleep.
“Shave?” John asked smoothly.
Yet he was perfectly conscious. And then suddenly, calm all at once. The screaming in his mind became muffled and the chill of the river suddenly became nonexistent.
“They’re just papers, John. Nothing of importance.”
“Say whatever is on your mind. You’ve been fidgeting all night.”
“Sherlock, are you all right?” John asked in alarm.
Victor nodded, processing this. “Even if you’re not?”
Sherlock pressed his hands on John’s shoulders and shook him harder. John squirmed and leaned away from Sherlock as far as he could. His eyes were moving beneath his lids, and he was muttering under his breath. Sherlock bit his lip, at a loss of what to do. He tried to reach for John’s hand, but John’s fist was clenched tightly in the sheet, it was difficult to unravel it. Sherlock sighed with aggravation and then paused.
Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed. Comments make my day and encourage me to keep on writing, so please tell me how you liked this story. The cliffhangers, the plot twists, everything! :) If you want to contact me, message me on tumblr: maeerin.tumblr.com
“You’re walking,” Sherlock exclaimed.
Sherlock closed his eyes tightly for a few seconds and then looked up at John, his eyes glistening amber and green against the orange burning glare behind him. “What would you do, if the thing that defines who you are was taken away?”
“He hasn’t asked in a few weeks.”
Sherlock turned around in a flourish and examined the bodies. John watched closely, paying half attention to his mutters as he looked over the bodies. The cause of death seemed rather obvious to him; it was just an overdose. Sherlock had agreed with him just a moment ago.
He awoke again to his phone ringing. He looked at the number and pressed the ignore button when he saw that it was Alex. He looked through other missed calls, two from his prosthetist and another from Alex. There weren’t any from Sherlock.
Unfortunately, as a routine now, John made his way to the bed and lied down. There wasn’t a desk or anything, and he didn’t have his computer or even his own books. The books they have weren’t in tolerable condition; either covered up with dried, bodily fluids or paranoia markings, or missed half the pages. John lay still instead, and stared up at the wall, knowing what was coming with dread just as it did.
“You could Sherlock, if you don’t get treated. I—I think I should call Mycroft—.”
Lee pondered for a moment, but didn’t make a move when the door to the room opened, and Mary walked out. She stopped in her tracks and her face fell. She glared at Lee then at Sherlock.
John glanced around, and looked at Sherlock briefly before looking towards the ground.
John looked at him regretfully. “I want to stay, but—.”
“Sherlock wait…there’s something I want to say, and haven’t yet, but I…want to say it now if that’s okay?” John interrupted.
“When you walked in just now, the comment you mumbled suggested you trained at Bart’s, and you clearly know Mike, so army doctor, obvious. Ignoring all that, there’s the stethoscope around your neck I saw earlier. At the pub nothing suggested your profession so it was easy to overlook,” Sherlock concluded and then peered at the shorter man. John was looking at him with…something Sherlock couldn’t name, but immediately blanketed his face and made up his mind.
“I am.” His brother said sternly. “The gun is registered, though even that is suspicious, to an Anne Garridebs—.”
John swallowed tightly as he got used to the unknown feeling. “It pinches,” he murmured. He was starting to feel overwhelmed, and really wished Sherlock was here.
11:59:57 PM
“You know, large compartments all lined up on wheels—.”
Silken had froze and glared at Sherlock. “Oh no, no no no no. He doesn’t die. The prince falls under a death like sleep, and the genius gives away his intellect in a exchange for this.”
The man looked at him and raised his hand tentatively. “So goodbye, um…”
“Could be exhaustion?”
*            *            *
Sherlock told himself.
Sherlock sighed and nodded. “I’ll come by tonight.” He leaned forward for a second, and then blinked and leaned away, slowly turning on his heel. John slowly caught his breath, and watched him go.
*            *            *
“Never.” The detective decided to say.
Sherlock swallowed tightly and lowered his gaze for a brief moment, and then he looked back at John, his grey eyes reflecting the burning embers. “John—”
Kingston shrugged. “Some people said it was part of the story. I didn’t know what he was taking about, and the less you asked the better. He was a strange man, even though I only met him once.”
Sighing, John opened it. He hadn’t spoken to Greg in a while, and hadn’t given that case any thought since then. He took the illustration out as he tossed the dirty rag away and looked at the face.
“Fine…can I lie here for a moment?” Sherlock asked tiredly.
Sherlock nodded as he took a step closer, until he was right by the bed railing, but he didn’t sit down.
“Tea?”
“Not just yet, John,” she said gently.
John ran his hand through his hair with frustration and stepped closer, now nearly face-to-face with Sherlock. “No, it’s not! You didn’t construct the building. You didn’t own the building. You didn’t know, Sherlock, you didn’t—”
“Sherlock?”
Dr. Bailey rushed forward, but John quickly glared at him.
John slowly awoke well into the next morning, realizing he was laying his cheek on Sherlock’s hand. His neck and back ached, and someone was moving lightly beside him. John blinked tiredly and raised his head up as he squinted around him. As his vision sharpened, Sherlock’s face focused; his eyes were open!
The detective didn’t answer at first. He narrowed his eyes at Shepherd and remained silent for a moment longer.
John kept his gun pointed at Moran but shifted his eyes to Sherlock, who was focusing on the floor.
Two days later, there was a knock on the door. John looked up from book he was reading, and looked at Sherlock, who was outstretched on the sofa.
“Yes.” John replied boldly.
“German”
“I’m certain it’s Dashwood. He worked with your father, right?”
Once he knew his brother was out of earshot and well away from John’s room, Sherlock sprang out of his chair and rushed into the private washroom. He vomited into the sink, painfully as not much came out since he’d barely eaten anything that day.
“What is it? Is he not playing with you?” John inquired, dismissing the joke immediately, and feeling bad. Rosie shouldn’t have to be playing by herself while a man slept forever; it wasn’t fair to her.
Sherlock and John stepped into the sitting room in silence, many thoughts on both of their minds.
John furrowed his brows and swallowed tightly. “I…
“Not in this story, no.”
Sherlock widened his eyes. “You’re in a mood. Is Mary the reason? Perhaps you shouldn’t marry her?”
“You’re an army soldier, invalided home from either Afghanistan or Iraq. Your limp is at least partially psychosomatic. You have had experience with alcoholism, hence your hesitation with that second pint and third tequila shot. It’s most likely a family member, probably a sibling, perhaps a parent as well. You tend to be cautious on your drinking; yet going by what you’ve had so far you have control over it. Once you had calmed your nerves, you had planned to hit on one of the first suitable persons you see. Gender doesn’t matter to you; although you’re used to picking up women, this isn’t your first time with men. You’re acting on an impulse—a need for something different and exciting—hence you talking to me—not someone looking around desperate, but certainly someone who stands out and may need convincing via an intriguing mildly-flirtatious conversation. Since you’re a military man, the persuasion part comes almost natural to you.”
“I do know. We don’t have to dance—,”
Sherlock nodded honestly. “Go to sleep. I’ll probably stay awake for a little while.”
Sherlock looked at him with uncertainty, and then nodded.
Sherlock vomited into the kitchen sink, his whole body trembling and sweating. Barely anything came out but his body wouldn’t stop. His throat was sore and his head ached. The slightest noise would pound against his ears and frustrate him even further. He stumbled away from the kitchen and by the time he made it to the window, he was crawling. His muscles ached and his cramps in his abdomen were non-stop. He slouched against the window and drew his dressing gown tighter around himself and thudded his forehead against the chilled window, in attempt to cool down.
The nurse retrieved a think blanket and laid it over John’s chest. She got another and laid it below his waist and legs. Sherlock stared at the doctor and realized they didn’t know about the tumor. He opened his mouth to speak, but no words formed. A nurse attempted to lead him out the room, but he resisted.
Dr. Robbins raised her chin and met his eyes. “His kidneys are failing, and it’s not looking like they will recover,” she started slowly.
Sherlock didn’t respond to his brother and instead raised an eyebrow for him to get to the point.
“Do you remember anything from that night, John?” Sherlock whispered uncertainly.
“Are you sure?” he asked again.
“Hello, Mr. Watson. I’m Dr. Moran. You’ve been having hallucinations, right?”
Sherlock placed a finger over John’s lips, shushing him. Sherlock slowly smiled and continued.
Sven backed away; Moran muttered an order and he left. Moran hovered by, and without a word, he left him as well, making his way to the main cabin. John peered out the corner of his eye and witnessed a satisfying grin lying on the bastard’s face.
Sherlock and John both furrowed their brows in confusion. “What else?”
Sherlock swallowed and his eyes glistened. John ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls; Sherlock’s eyes fluttered at the touch, and soon they remained closed as he fell back asleep.
Sherlock grinned back and kissed the other man softly on the lips before letting go of his hand and walking out of the waiting room.
“Do you want the tumor out?” Sherlock asked, hoping like hell that John would say yes.
“It hasn’t rained today. It’s been raining for weeks.”
*            *            *
“Shh,” John tiredly attempted. His vision blurred and he coughed again.
5:00:00 PM
“That’s for if anyone comes through the door before I come back. I shouldn’t be long…” Sherlock said and headed towards the door only to pause when John called out his name. He didn’t turn around though, but waited for John to say whatever he wanted to say.
Sherlock turned around to face his brother, and relaxed his face.
He opened them and looked at John’s face. He was so relaxed, apart from the ventilator tube; he looked like he could just be sleeping. Sherlock straightened up and pulled out the paper John had given him, and slowly opened it up with one hand.
Sherlock didn’t respond, and pulled out his phone. He knew he needed Mycroft to come back, before any permanent damage was done. Mary spoke behind him, her voice hesitant.
“Right, you can watch. I’ll leave Sinclair here, keep an eye on things.” Sherlock nodded again, and then followed his brother.
After what felt like several minutes, Sherlock loosened his grip and leaned away to see John’s face. With their arms still around each other, they leaned in simultaneously and kissed each other, soft at first then deeper and passionately.
“It’s healing well,” he informed the doctor.
“Um sure. I take it you’ll explain it.”
Sherlock stood up and took the accessory. John turned around and then Sherlock clasped it around his neck. In the mirror above the fireplace, it fell right on John’s breastplate beside his heart. John blushed in the mirror and turned around.
Sherlock finally looked at him and a weak grin tugged at the corners of his mouth. John grinned back; it was more of a sad grin, a glisten in his eyes sparkled and looked like single stars that trailed in the night sky above them. Sherlock’s weak grin fell and he gulped uneasily. It was John who finally broke the silence.
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John said firmly. He looked up at the detective to meet his gaze. “I’ll be fine.”
John turned to see Sherlock walking in, pausing, and then continuing, however with more hesitation in his steps and his eyes on anything except John. He paused again halfway between the door and John’s bed, and then slowly walked a few more steps before stopping.
“Good afternoon,” she said softly. “Feeling any better?”
Sherlock prepared himself like he always did and then turned on his side, facing the back of the couch. The man lined up behind him and gently took hold on his hip with one hand, and the other holding his own cock.
Sherlock stared at him, unsure why he was there, which irritated him.
“Just a few more steps and you can relax in the chair,” John said encouragingly.
“There may be, yes. We’ll run some tests, see if it’ll be okay. But there is something else.”
“I’m f-fine,” he breathed out. Sherlock huffed, and then reached forward to John’s jumper. John flinched and tried to curl up, but then inhaled sharply and grimaced. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he straightened up.
“I understand you think my father was murdered,” Lucy said. The three men nodded.
Sherlock stepped closer to them. “You two know each other…” he began, but John interrupted him a bit harshly, unlike his usual tone.
“Sherlock—what?” Lestrade huffed.
John swallowed hard. Kim spoke up before he could. “That’s not a bad idea.”
John blinked and looked at Victor, whose brows were furrowed slightly.
John looked up and exhaled a humorless laugh. “That was quick.”
“He-he’ll have you killed, John.”
“Fine,” John grimaced. “We’re going really slow, Sherlock—.”
Lestrade’s eyes flickered to John. Sherlock turned to him, and then glared. “You know I need a case—.”
“John?” Sherlock pried.
He left, closing the door behind him. John exhaled slowly tried to think of something he could do to find out more. Sherlock wouldn’t talk; the nurses would just make it seem like everything was fine, or convince him to talk to Sherlock, which John would try, if there were a slight chance Sherlock would respond, which there wasn’t. There must be some kind of record—Victor might know, but John refused to think about asking him. There must be a camera, maybe Mycroft—no—maybe there was a sign-in sheet—yes, maybe, that would show something.
“Lie back fully, love, and relax for me.”
John rushed forward and wrapped his arms around him. “It’s okay…” He murmured softly.
As the words began to register on Shepherd’s face, a car screeched around the corner and came to an abrupt stop. Immediately, men in suits hurried out, guns already drawn out. Shepherd was startled by the sudden tactic and tried to re-aim at the detective. He shot once but missed greatly despite his (said) experience. He was apprehended before he could fire again and was dragged to another car and out of sight.
“And where are these terrorists from, as John had implied.”
“You may need another bath. You still smell like the hospital.” Sherlock stated, a tinge of disgust in his tone.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“So you’re together now?” Lestrade remarked. Sherlock opened his mouth for a retort but the man’s next response interrupted him. “About time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why shoot us and not an officer outside of the police department? If someone had a grudge against Scotland Yard, they’d shoot an officer but they didn’t. They shot John, or were trying to shoot me. Either way, it’s personal.”
“Go Sherlock! Find John!”
John giggled again and ran a hand over his face. “At least one thing went accordingly.”
“Romantic?” John teased lightly.
“No,” Sherlock said without meeting his eyes.
John groaned. “Come on,” he whispered, leading Sherlock to their bedroom.
“You called him? I just need a case, Gary!”
“You have one already?”
“Sher-Sherlock?” John spluttered out.
By the end of the month, the last of John’s patience dried out—becoming a complete and utter desert.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him. “Why would an army doctor need practice?”
“No, that’s not what I—,” John interrupted, catching Sherlock off guard. “I’m just…” He looked up, and Sherlock waited, expecting to look for another flatmate tomorrow. Again, the army doctor surprised him.
He didn’t.
“You do?”
Sherlock’s idea seemed to work; since he first wrote on his arm, John made sure it was still there. He hadn’t been lucid since then, but every time he woke up, he saw it, and his eyes softened when he saw John and tea. It was as if deep down, Sherlock knew John was important to him, he just didn’t know his name or his face.
“Sherlock…” John whispered and took a step closer. Sherlock swayed on the ledge, so he stopped in his tracks and reached forward.
“We should stop—.”
Sherlock blinked rapidly as the pain throughout his body increased. All he could really focus on was the ground, covered in red water—or was it blood? It had been drizzling moments ago, hadn’t it?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Look at me, Sherlock,” John tried. Sherlock continued to breath shakily. John was becoming more upset that Sherlock was crying. He placed his hand over Sherlock’s shoulder and pulled him so he would turn. Sherlock didn’t even bother resisting.
Sherlock silently went up to him. Victor looked at John for a long time, and then slowly removed his furrowed gaze to Sherlock. He rested his hand over Sherlock’s waist. John looked away, finding the simple affection touch oddly possessive. He couldn’t hear what Sherlock was whispering, but after a moment, Victor hummed and then left.
“Oh god, John...”
“It was just saline. I barely felt it.”
Sherlock breathed out and tightened his hold around John. “I’ve got you John. I’m here.”
“That was Victor. He’s insisting I’d have lunch with him—.”
Sherlock only glanced at him and then looked back at the screen. “John has to tell me now, and if we save him in time—.”
Sherlock led him to the sofa, and let him sit. He sat next to him on the left, and pushed John sideways until he was lying over his lap. John only continued to cry loudly, seemingly unware of what was going out.
John looked up at Sherlock, a smirk forming on his face. Sherlock raised his eyebrow.
“I love you, Sherlock. So much.” John leaned closer against Sherlock until he could hear his heartbeat. He inhaled deeply, and fought hard to stay awake, but then Sherlock tensed underneath him, and pushed him away.
John continued. “Why couldn’t you have just…told me you were alive? Or better yet, not told me at all—I mean—.” John cut himself off when he saw Sherlock flinch. He continued softly. “I didn’t mean it like that Sherlock…I mean…why—.”
John sighed with relief and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s. He inhaled, but then coughed roughly. He started to sit back, but then sudden pain shot through his abdomen and chest, and his hand automatically covered his wound.
"There is just one left. Sebastian Moran.” Sherlock explained quickly, his gaze in full focus on the dull tile floor. “He was the closest to Moriarty and I was in the middle of tracking him when—.” His explanation was cut short and he hesitantly looked up to John, who looked at him with a questioning look.
John sent out a quick text of gratitude, and then hurried and hailed a cab. He reached Bart’s within minutes behind Sherlock, and headed to the entrance. Molly was just heading out, and nearly bumped into him.
Sherlock had had nightmares before, mostly consisting of his time away for two years. It wasn’t until after the debacle with Mary when he finally talked about it. John had listened and been there for him; he didn’t see why he could do it now.
“A minute earlier would have been lovelier John.” Sherlock claimed.
“Tell me,” John started roughly. He cleared is throat and looked into Sherlock’s eyes, as if searching for some kind of clarification.
John flinched. “Excuse me? You should trust me—”
Suddenly, pain shot through John’s head, thundering and throbbing like a storm, waves crashing sharply. He clenched his jaw tightly and squeezed his eyes; his hands shot up to his head. He let out a whimper as he fell to his knees.
The assassin shrugged. “I wouldn’t say John’s not unharmed. What you just did was pretty heart shattering. And from what I could tell, your heart’s starting to break as well.”
John continued to stare at Sherlock, who was avoiding his gaze and staring straight ahead. “Why are still saying that Sherlock?” John asked carefully.
Willoughby raised an eyebrow, kindly allowing John to go on.
The image of Sherlock regarded him with pity, but a sudden shriek invaded the subconscious.
“No, he’s probably making sure his hair’s just right.”
John’s grin faltered and he sighed. “How about a quick snog?” His eyes twinkled with smugness, which he knew Sherlock couldn’t resist. He took John’s hand and led him to the sofa, leaving their cups of tea behind to turn cold. John didn’t waste any time; he straddled Sherlock’s thighs and started kissing him passionately.
Sherlock waved a hand dismissively. “Of course you’ll be getting a prosthetic.”
Sherlock nodded, and watched as John closed the door, keeping it parted open.
“She wasn’t surprised. I could have sworn she had sounded pleased.” John said as he sat down.
A whimper escaped his blogger’s throat. He peeked his eyes opened, but then closed them.
Sherlock looked at him for nearly a minute, the tension increasing. Finally, he blinked heavily and nodded, albeit his shoulders were still tense.
John exhaled slowly, and carefully asked, “I can come back…after lunch—.”
“Moran’s sniper. Moran told me he’s going to be teasing us first and then…”
Sherlock!
John thought to himself as he ignored the solid hallucination and proceeded with his normal morning routine. (He had to be at the surgery in an hour). John’s hand shook slightly with the tremor, and he fumbled with the toothpaste cap and dropped it on the floor. He knelt down and picked it up, and then, straightening back up, he looked into the mirror only to have his breath taken away.
Sherlock didn’t show any signs of comprehending to what was told to him.
“I haven’t planned that far yet—.” Sherlock stopped in his tracks, his flashlight catching on something. He looked up and inhaled sharply. Mary followed his gaze and then gasped, much louder.
John walked down the hall, oblivious to Sherlock in his hiding spot. He walked right past him without a second thought. Sherlock didn’t waste any time; he leapt up and headed back the way he came. However, in a rush to get away, Sherlock collided into a wheelchair that hadn’t been properly put away, and fell, landing harshly on the basement ground.
Sherlock gave him a curt nod and then for the first time since they’d reunited, he purposely looked away.
“Why am I isolated?” John immediately asked. The nurse—Margaret—offered a sympathetic smile.
“Just about four months ago. It was diagnosed as Early on-set, but it worsened pretty fast.”
