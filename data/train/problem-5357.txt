Tony mouthed, then made a locking motion against his lips.  She nodded at him again, and went back to her picture.
He stripped his shirt off and kicked off his shoes. He should shower. He knew he didn’t smell very good. But he couldn’t stand to not be touching Tony for one more minute. One more second.
Clint smiled, and she threaded her arm through his and turned him back to the computer.  Away from Baxter.  Away from the temptation to just kill the son of a bitch.
“Every time I tell somebody what I need, they get mad.” He shifted within the circle of Tony’s arms, and Tony rubbed his back again until he quieted. “Or...or they just take what
He had a shower, washing off the chlorine and the night air, then climbed into bed. He was tired. And lonely. And for just a minute, he let himself continue on with his fantasy. Let Fantasy-Steve come out of the bathroom, all showered and shaved, smelling like toothpaste and menthol shaving lotion. He came toward the bed and didn’t even hesitate before tossing back the covers and crawling beneath them. Didn’t hesitate before sliding next to Tony and curling his body around him like it was the most natural thing in the world. Fantasy-Steve nuzzled into his neck and kissed him there. He heard--almost
Sam nodded toward Steve. “You. Him. Before you guys got together he was always staring at you. I saw you looking at him too, but he was
“It won’t be long.  Just hold on, okay?  I know it’s hard.  I wish I could make it easier, but just hold on.”
Steve smiled at him again.  “It’s okay.”  He looked around at the place.  “And it really is perfect, Tony.  I’m just surprised.  Before, you said places like this were too--”
Steve tapped Tony’s knee with the back of his hand.  “Hey, Tony, look, it’s Hans Gruber.  Tony--” He stopped.  Tony was sound asleep beside him.  His face, usually pinched with worry or alight with manic glee, had smoothed out and softened.  His hair fell over his forehead.  One hand was tossed lightly over his stomach, the other lay on the couch, palm up, clean, white, and somehow vulnerable.
Steve scratched out what he’d written.  Again.  It didn’t sound right.  He couldn’t get it to sound right.  Nothing he wrote or said ever sounded right to him.  Why couldn’t he be more like Tony?  Why couldn’t he say what he meant and have it flow off his tongue--or his pen, in this case--the way Tony could?  It wasn’t fair.
He didn’t want to think about the years they’d been apart. Years that had equaled almost half his life. A lot had happened over the course of those years, and his feelings over them were wildly diverse. Anger, fear, pain, pride, despondency, terror, confusion. He’d felt them all--sometimes all of them at the same time.
Steve sighed, and ran his fingers through Tony’s hair. He kissed his temple, scratched his nails lightly up his back. “‘Kay, Tony,” he whispered, but he was pretty sure Tony was almost asleep. And that was okay. Better, maybe. If Tony said that while he was mostly asleep, while his guard was down, then Steve knew he was telling the truth. Not that he thought Tony had ever not told him the truth--he didn’t think Tony was capable of lying to him, and wouldn't lie even if he
Ross nodded to the files still scrolling away.  “What do you think now, Mr. Stark?  What are you going to do with that information?”
“What if I just ask you yes or no questions?  Will that work?  You don’t even have to talk.  Just blink once for yes, twice for no.”
Steve nodded. He was frowning. He could feel it on his face. He couldn’t help but remember the last time Howard Stark had been in this room. The way he’d looked around, face filled with disdain and superiority. The way he’d looked at the furniture. The way he’d looked at
He stepped out of the stairwell and onto the common floor.  It was quiet, deserted.  A couple blankets lay draped on the sofas and an abandoned can of Coke sat on the coffee table.  Steve smiled a little as he folded the blankets.  Bruce had almost certainly been under one of them, and Rocket had probably been using the other one.  He’d taken to building little nests for himself in the corner chair.  This bit of camaraderie, even felt second-hand, was pleasant and familiar.  They’d need it tomorrow.  They’d need to be together, need to be a team again.  He and Tony were going to be a big part of that.
He crossed to the bed and stood looking down on her.  She’d let her hair grow over the last few years and it spread out on the pillow like a red-gold fan.  Her lips were the plump cherry red he had kissed before she went away.  Her skin the same milk-white.
Steve tossed the shirt onto the foot of the bed then laid back down.  He reached for Tony.  His eyes were lit with a tiny smoldering ember deep down inside each one.  “Come here, Tony,” he said, and his voice was deeper, rougher with need.
“Guess so,” Steve agreed, then kissed the soft lobe of his ear. “Come on. Come in. Are you hungry? If I knew you were coming, I would have saved the meatloaf Mom made. Sorry. But I can make you a sandwich?”
Tony nodded.  He hadn’t known her parents, what kind of people they’d been, but he could see Steve in that posture, that arrogant tip of her chin, and he was proud.  As proud as any pseudo-step-father had ever been in the history of the universe.
He sat at the same table, but his cute little girlfriend was absent.  Shame, really, he felt like they’d bonded.  Then the door buzzed, he looked up, and all thought was driven out of his head.
“I-” Tony began, then stopped. Shook his head. “Our future, baby,” he managed. “You were thinking about our future. About us.”
Yes, she had.  She had prophesied Steve’s death, had caused Bruce to break into a Hulk-sized rampage, had hurt them all.  Tony had tried to forgive her over the years and had mostly succeeded, but part of him would always be wary of her.
She’d told him that, growing up.  It had been one of her mottos, and it was still a good one.  One he believed in.
“Well, now you get to save that tongue for better things,” Tony said, and Steve took him in his arms and used his tongue for better things.
Thanks for reading and commenting! Next chapter up in a few days. I'm just writing it now, so guess we'll see what happens!
for a long time. The only art I’ve done lately is pretty much just drawing stuff for Morgan to color.”
Tony sighed. Ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t know, Steve,” he said. “Maybe I just wanted to talk to you. We didn’t talk much before. At the wedding. Maybe I miss talking to you.”
"Shut up, Tony," Steve said, but the grin was still on his face.  Tony was heavy, squirmy like a puppy, complaining like a brat, but Steve had never been more happy to have all of those things held in his arms, bundled up against his heart.  "At least let me get you inside first."
Tony’s eyes narrowed a bit as he held up the smaller t-shirt. He raised his eyebrows at Steve. “And just who, may I ask, does this belong to, Steven Rogers?”
“Yeah,” Steve answered, matching her tone. “I spot five security guards. Four points of egress. Two guys are packing. There and there.”
He hadn’t seen him yet, Tony was sure, and he used the opportunity to look him over while his eyes were closed.  He was thinner.  Even through the old leather jacket--
It wasn’t a command--Tony had never commanded him to do anything the entire time they had known each other--but it wasn’t a mere suggestion, either. It felt like a request. Something he could do or not do. Something Tony
Steve tucked the blankets away in the armoire in the corner and snapped off the lamp.  Outside the windows, New York stretched like a dream below him.  He did look out this time, and even though it wasn’t as bright as before, it was still beautiful.  The people down there, those thousands of dots of light, knew nothing of the battle that was coming.  Their lives went on the same as they had since the snap, and they would know nothing different until tomorrow.  Steve didn’t know whether he envied or pitied them that.
--invading all of his senses.  Never had he felt such an all-encompassing sense of rightness, of the simple pleasures of being home.  “That’s the best idea I’ve ever heard, Steve.  Seriously.  The best one.”
Tony stood up and tucked the last sock into the laundry basket. “Will you be okay with him while I go put this in the bathroom?” he asked, nodding at the baby.
He glanced up and down the road one more time, searching for Tony’s car, and when he didn’t see it, he left the theater, and went to the diner. He looked for Tony outside, then went in and sat down.
you got your toothbrush?” Tony asked, and Steve ducked his head into Morgan’s sweet-smelling hair, hiding his smile.
getting better.  His mobility was starting to return.  It had been six weeks since Thanos.  Four of those, he’d spent in Shuri’s med-bay.  The first in a drug-induced coma, the last three awake, in pain, starting the healing process, learning how to handle things like this.
At first, none of the others heard him.  They were still trying to figure out who’s dick was bigger.  That’s what Tony would have said, anyway.  It was probably true.
. Not like, change your driver’s license, magazine subscriptions, and voter-registration, officially.”
Instead of saying them, Steve kissed him again--one last time to pay for all.  “I will see you in the morning, won’t I?” he asked.  “Thor said something about a warrior’s feast?”
Thank you SO MUCH for your continued support and feedback. I honestly can't tell you how much it means to me, especially now.
“Which one would you like to wear this evening, Mr. Stark?” she teased. He pointed to one near the middle, a Bvlgari in sandblasted ceramic. The band, face and hands were all black, which would make it versatile, easy to dress up or down. Only the back of the casing was clear, exposing some of the inner workings of the watch as well as numerous small jewels that had been set into it. (He loved that those weren’t visible to anyone but the wearer, like a secret they would only share with someone close.) Natasha smirked, which was all the confirmation he needed that she had chosen that particular piece, and slid it onto his wrist in a surprisingly gentle movement that avoided pinching at any hair or skin as she did up the clasp.
A plan was starting to take vague shape in his mind. Steve and maybe Nat, too, were definitely on to him, and he spent most of the time he wasn’t with Pepper or Rhodey dodging invitations and attempted drop-in visits, but he was pretty sure he would be able to manage it before anyone put all the pieces together.
Tony was already late to his lunch meeting with Pepper, so this particular shot wasn’t staged or glamorous at all. It was just him in a thirty-ninth floor hallway flanked by Dummy, who had a perilous hold on Tony’s travel mug full of coffee. He captioned it
“Sure I’ll call you Steve. But I’d prefer you call me Sir, especially in front of Agent Hill.” His laugh was a beat too slow, and Talia’s eyes narrowed, an assessing stare far too similar to Natasha’s for Steve to believe she wouldn't see far too much if they lingered long.
…” That note in Clint’s voice always spelled trouble of the most delightful kind, whether it was sex or prank-calling Steve at work. Tony was powerless to do anything but look at him, waiting for the other shoe to drop. “Or you could come upstairs and help us tie Thor up and do wicked things to him.”
“Carol has a fondness for them she refuses to explain to anyone except Nick. The records were a gift from her to him, in fact, but he left them with me for safe keeping a few years ago.”
“Beyond the paddling you asked Nat for, and the milking with Bruce which was just as much pleasure as it was anything else, we haven’t really had much cause to punish you since this all started. So before we talk about what would be an appropriate way to handle what happened, I think maybe we should discuss punishment a little more generally. How did it work between you and James?” Tony squirmed in his seat, looking everywhere but at Steve until Bruce nudged him in the ribs and whispered something that brought that pretty flush back to Tony’s cheeks.
“I don’t mean it that way. I mean..look, the thing I said was shitty, okay? You do know me, you’re not just using me to fill a gap, and part of me knew that. I’m sorry I said it.”
“The last thing I said—well, I made an attempt at Rhodey and Pepper’s names but I was pretty far gone by then—the last full sentence I managed in my own universe was ‘I am Iron Man.’” Steve’s entire ribcage contracted like he’d just been punched, but he said nothing for which Tony felt pathetically grateful. “I tried, a couple times, to separate us, but in that moment I could see so clearly how hopeless it had always been to wish to get to be just Tony Stark again. It was just like I’d said before: the suit and I are one. So when I woke up here, somehow miraculously not dead, I felt like this was my chance. This time I could finally let Iron Man die, and for a while that seemed like the best fuck you to every circumstance that had brought Thanos to Earth in the first place.”
None of the team was in the workshop when he and Dr. Chimva stepped out of the elevator, but nor was it empty. Rhodey stood proud and tall in the centre of the space, tossing a ball to You who (as he always did with Rhodey) had abandoned his serious older brother facade in favour of chasing the toy with unrestrained glee.
“We can keep adding to it as we figure out more of what you like,” Steve burst out eagerly. That seemed to break the communication dam with the rest of the team, and soon they were excitedly talking over one another, pointing out their contributions and their favourite details in the room. it overwhelmed Tony in the best of ways.
“I’m surprised you’re permitting her to say as much as she is about the Kimoyo beads. My impression was that the Princess is quite protective of that particular technology.”
Tony told it, knowing, somehow, that it would understand, I want to bargain. It grew angry; the searing sensation on his left arm increased ten-fold, stealing the breath from his lungs and bowing his back into a near impossible arch.
Steve watched Sam interact with the team with warmth in his heart —Sam had never been a full Avenger, hadn’t wanted to be, but that didn’t make the shared affection between them all any less real. He’d spent hours joking with Clint and Nat, had had late-night philosophical discussions with Phil and Bruce, and especially back in the beginning, he’d been endlessly patient with Steve’s near-constant confusion about the modern world. Sam fit right back into the rhythms of life with the team as if he’d never been gone.
The first half the chapter also features Bucky wearing some visible marks from an entirely consensual scene with Clint and Natasha.
“I. Uh.” He wanted to say no, because really the only thing he could think of was so small, but Steve had told Tony he was good, that he was perfect, and he wanted to always be those things even when it was embarrassing. “I wanted to clean you, with my mouth, when it was over.”
“So anyway, I was trying to take a look at whatever paperwork the other version of me had drawn up. I mean, we gotta be similar, right? And he at least knew what the hell he was doing. Only…”
The sixth response also contains a vision that is somewhat spoilery for a future event. A previous reply from Dr. Strange has actually already hinted at it, but this one is a lot more overt, so if you don't want to know anything about what night be coming down the road, steer clear!
“Soooo not the same. It’s the personal touch that really matters, you know? Also the company. And the pigeons. Let’s go to Clayton Park again.”
“You’re fine, Tony. Your body knows what to do, you don’t have to think about it or do anything to make this happen. Just stay nice and still for me. We’re almost there.” It didn’t feel like they were almost anywhere. It felt like the same pleasurable, painful monotony that it had been the whole time, but sure enough, it was probably under a minute later that come began to dribble from between Tony’s legs.
Getting his mouth on Bruce, finally, felt both familiar and new. He was wider than any of the others, a pleasant, solid weight against Tony’s tongue. Where the blowjob he’d given Phil had been quiet and peaceful and almost soothing, however, Bruce seemed determined to keep Tony off-kilter just enough to make him want to die. He was constantly changing his angle, or drawing back out of Tony’s mouth entirely, shaking his head when Tony reflexively chased him with his mouth.
“I don’t mind.” There was a rumble that in Bucky’s chest that might have turned into a growl if he’d let it; honestly, it was probably good it hadn’t. Tony didn’t even want to know how apeshit that would make his body go. “Look, I’m not trying to force anything to happen that you’re not comfortable with, I’m really not. If all you ever want is to sub out with me on the floor, I’m cool with that. But don’t avoid it for my sake, okay? Whatever resentment I had towards you pretty much burnt out the second I saw you with my bots, and it’s had weeks to turn into something more positive. And I’ve—I’ve thought about it. You. That way.”
His Natasha had often preferred tea, too, and watching her undergo the quiet ritual of boiling the water, steeping the tea, then adding milk and sugar was oddly comforting. She even let him mostly finish the cup in silence before she went for the usual Natasha sucker punch.
“Hey man. You really gotta eat something, alright? Pretty sure your team cooked every breakfast-related product in the place. Any preferences?” Rhodey wasn’t wrong about the sheer volume of food; the bench at the foot of the bed was piled high with plates containing eggs, sausage and bacon, pancakes, bagels, doughnuts, food that would fill at least ten un-enhanced humans. The sight made Tony vaguely nauseous.
“For us too,” Clint provided, along with adding two more pastries to Tony’s plate. “Is it the submission stuff freaking you out? The general context? All of the above?”
The longer it went on, the more MJ’s defiant fury melted away into concern, and then outright alarm.
“Agreed.” Natasha nodded and then stood, sliding the plates from Phil’s hands and shoving them at Clint.
But in the end, Tony nodded and watched Bruce exit the lab. Because, as usual, the man was right—Tony did already have a lot to think about.
“The submissive sleeps deeply. He does not normally do so during day,” Bucky observed, his cadence and diction somewhere between the Soldier and himself. Rhodes smiled, everything about his body language loose and languid the way other Dominants would be after an intense scene.
“Not that. Not.” Phil tipped Tony’s face up and held his gaze, and Coulson looking at him like that was some kind of human truth serum, Tony was pretty sure. “Just…want to feel you like that. Want to stay on my knees for you, and have you in my mouth.  Want you to get to bask in it, Dominating, since you didn’t get to do it as much as you needed before, and I wanna bask in you.”
“…no, I haven’t been—we’ve been trading off. In case you—or Rhodes or Pepper—needed anything.” And what was Tony supposed to do with such an open demonstration of care? How was he possibly supposed to even comprehend that right now? Natasha turned away without further comment, leading them both to the kitchen. He made a beeline for the coffee pot, but JARVIS intervened.
“Breathe, Tony, you need to breathe,” Bruce entreated. He sucked in a breath with blind obedience, willing to do anything to work past this first part, to get to that place where he knew from seeing the others that pain could take a person. He kept his eyes on Bruce, watched Bruce watching him, eyes keen and focused and intensely Dominant in a way Tony had never seen before. “Nat, speed up a little bit. You’re giving him too long to anticipate the next blow and he tenses up all over again every time.” Tony sobbed even as the thumps of the paddle was already increasing in frequency.  When Natasha landed two particularly close together on the crease between ass and thigh, he wailed, the fight going out of his body all at once. There was no need for Natasha to hold him down now, he was lax against her legs, accepting the pain, pulling it in close, inviting it to linger in his deepest places. It could have been minutes or hours that he laid there, the paddle’s brutal dance echoing through the room. When Bruce spoke again, he sounded very far away. “If Natasha has to keep going she’s going to go at your thighs, Tony. It’s going to hurt like hell. Is that what you need?” He nodded, groaned something wordless and primal. His face was almost stuck to the bed from a combination of sweat and snot and tears, but he didn’t care, couldn’t care about anything except getting where he needed to be. Natasha’s hand settled on his back again, joined by one of Bruce’s larger ones, and the paddle connected with his right thigh. He opened his mouth in a silent scream, which became an actual scream when the paddle landed a second, then a third time so close together he barely had time to suck in a breath in between.
“I know we have to talk. I know there’s a million things, I have to…I have to tell them about Peter, and we have to figure out where we all go from here,  and I just—Nat, I can’t. It’s possible I’ve cried more in the past few week than I have for the rest of my life. I don’t want to have to feel anything or say anything more,” he confessed, sure he was in for yet another well-deserved lecture about the value of open communication. Instead, Natasha nodded.
This was when something…odd happened. This simple permission to linger, to just take his time with Coulson, it was nothing but words, but it hit Tony with profound, staggering force. Like a puppet with its strings cut, the tension drained from him at once. He leaned forward, resting his forehead against Phil’s groin and lower stomach. He let the heavy weight of Coulson’s cock press against his tongue, his previously focused technique devolving into a slow and aimless exploration. At times Tony was pretty sure what he was doing didn’t even constitute a blowjob anymore, but Phil didn’t complain, or try to direct him otherwise. Every once in a while he murmured soft words, or stroked Tony’s hair. Otherwise he just let Tony do exactly as he pleased.
“I don’t want to keep hiding from  you. Don’t let me.” With that, he extended his arms out to Steve, who took the housing unit with shaking, cautious hands, as if he was being handed something unimaginably precious.
“Funny you should mention that given—agh!” The other man’s taunts were short by the entrance of Natasha, who looked to have glided in by something she’d hung off a wire attached to one of Clint’s arrows. It was a damn cool move that would have usually forced a smile from Natasha even at her most focused, but she had a long and complicated backstory with Taskmaster. “Ah, the Widow. I thought the new troops would keep you busier longer—did you notice how familiar they were with the Red Room’s excellent instruction? Got my hands on some very detailed footage.”
“It’s mostly a ‘in a polyamorous relationship with seve—six of the most complicated and emotionally constipated people in the world’ thing, actually. We learned early that we were going to rise and fall on being able to use our damn words. But I guess it’s maybe a bit of an orientation thing too; risk-aware, consensual kink, the only kind any of us want to practice, it’s ninety percent negotiation and ten percent execution.” There’s a fraught silence, and then Bruce’s knee nudges Tony’s. “Is the whole deflection thing you-specific, or some kind of symptom of your universe?”
By the time Steve had warmed him up, Phil was already wailing. (It was one of his favourite parts about Phil as a sub, how uncontrolled and vocal he got so quickly. The contrast between that and his out-of-headspace self never failed to make Steve feel immensely powerful.)
With most of the team, the submission had felt like a way to solidify what they’d built during their dates. It was why Tony had ended up insisting on dating and scening with the same person despite the team’s initial suggestions. The thought still held some appeal when it came to Thor, but even more assuring was the consideration and care behind the suggestion that they wait. Thor wasn’t angry or disappointed that Tony maybe couldn’t submit to him quite yet.
He didn’t know quite how tied up in knots he felt about food, though, not until Rhodey playfully attempted to take an orange wedge from his plate and Tony jerked the plate away. His attempt to protect his food was counterproductive to the extreme; half of it ended up sliding off the plate and onto the floor with a splat. Whatever chance he had of not catching the attention of not just Rhodey but everyone in the kitchen was forever ruined by the string of loud, furious curses Tony let loose afterward.
Steve would have given several limbs to know precisely what had gone on in Bucky and Tony’s hushed poolside conversation, but there would be plenty of time for that. It was enough for now that both of them were more settled once it was done. Tony accepted the second round of aftercare he sorely needed. He let Bruce rub him down with a massage oil formulated specifically for submissives, despite his numerous muttered protests about the lack of scientific evidence supporting its benefits (no one called him on it when he was putty under Bruce’s hands in under three minutes). He allowed the team to hand feed him both lunch and dinner, complete with sugary deserts to balance out the drop. Tony responded most, however, to a gift Thor gave him: a sumptuous blanket threaded with strings of gold. Thor had gotten Tony on his side and then draped the fabric over his back, rear and legs. Tony had sent an appreciative smile backward, but then he’d abruptly groaned and sunk so deeply into his pillow that Steve half felt like he might keep going all the way through the floor. All of them had turned to Thor, who was grinning a little guiltily.
“Sure we did. Don’t mean we can’t enjoy some of the ways that you’re different than he was.” Steve’s wholesale rejection of Tony was way too recent for this to be a believable claim. He snorted, but this backfired when Barnes turned to face him for the first time. His mussed hair and lazy posture were at odds with how serious his expression had turned, but Tony could still recognize pretty quickly that this was not the moment to challenge Bucky. “I loved the other Tony with my whole goddamn soul, but that don’t mean he was perfect. None of us are. He was hard. The world had made him that way, and we all understood why, but you never totally knew what might set him off, make him pull away or turn vicious and cold on you, sometimes for days or even weeks at a time. And his submission…yeah, he was a True, and yeah he was gorgeous and wonderful when he went down, but you always felt just a little guilty for putting him there when he hated that he needed it so much. You been through just as much as he had, I think, but it’s shaped you differently. Somehow it makes you want to hope harder, give more of yourself to the people around you. I think that’s fuckin’ beautiful.”
“I want to be clear about the fact that I’m completely mortified. I mean, I could barely even talk for the first couple hours there—“
“Is he already up in the penthouse, JARVIS?” Peter asks hopefully the second he steps into the private elevator.
Tony jumped. Which meant he had been extremely focused on what he was watching, because JARVIS always announced incoming arrivals to the Tower. (Was it weird if Peter was jealous? He didn’t always like having the full force of Tony’s attention on him, but he also wasn’t wild about the idea of having to fight a whole bunch of other kids for it.)
The others proved to be just as interested in Tony’s work with Coulson as Bruce had been, and that conversation lasted them through the preparation and serving of the meal. Natasha had prepared
, for goodness sake. If he couldn’t trust her then he was always already lost. Plus the way Steve was staring at her, wide eyes clouded with some mix of fury and grudging respect (Tony was more than familiar with that particular expression) made it imminently clear that she had not informed him this was part of her plan. He nodded, and she smiled back, that secret, toothy smile he’d only ever seen her direct at him. “Good. Now I can go or stay, whatever you need, but I think your partners deserve an explanation of what’s going on before you make this decision. You’ve promised me that they haven’t harmed you in any way, and so I think we can agree that they deserve your honesty about why this isn’t working. Yes?” He nodded again, and his eyes met Steve’s for the first time.
Tony was saying his name, but Steve couldn’t focus on that, couldn’t anything at all past the mental checklist he'd been writing all morning. He had to know that Tony was alright, he had to be sure, more sure than Steve had ever been of anything because Tony trusted him, he’d given Steve everything just as Steve had asked (demanded, really, because he'd taken it from Tony, hadn’t he?)
Steve wasn’t sure if it was Tony’s look of pure outrage that did it, or the giddy relief of being able to tease Tony about his submission when it had once been such a fraught topic. Whatever the case, it was close to ten minutes later when he finally stopped laughing enough to be able to guide his submissive toward the elevator.
“Wait, do we all kneel?” Clint asked. “Sorry, Tony, Strange didn’t say when we asked him how this works. It’ll be weird if we all kneel, won’t it? Like you’re a monarch or something?”
“We’ll have Phil draw up a schedule,” Bruce agreed, the smooth motion of his hips never faltering. Tony whined pitifully, sure he’d never make it to even the halfway point of the scene without exploding. It was fucking perfect, everything they were saying. Tony’s notes about humiliation had been hesitant and contradictory, requesting that it not be mean. He hadn’t even known if such a thing was possible when he’d asked Phil to write it, but this was like every hint of a fantasy he’d ever had brought to life. They were being downright gentle even as they suggested that Tony was a tool they were using, one that needed to be serviced more effectively to improve his performance. He shivered and dropped a hand down to his dick, only to find that effort immediately thwarted.
Some time passed. Tony had no idea how much, or how little. At one point, Phil asked his permission for Clint to come onto the floor.
The soundproofing here, like in the rest of the building, was thorough. Tony hadn’t heard much as the media had gathered. But when Steve had made the initial announcement of Tony’s 'return', the noise had been comparable to that of a small explosion. The roar dwarfed even the reaction to his own ‘I am Iron Man,’ mic-drop which was somehow both awesome and annoying. (It also made it virtually impossible not to think about how his own world would have responded, but that wasn’t a though to dwell on. Not today when everything was riding on Tony trying to forget that this wasn’t his universe.)
Bruce visits Tony and offers some overdue support. Bucky resurrects a Tower tradition in an attempt to reach Steve.
“Actually, Flash, I remembered that Michelle was out today and inexplicably left you in charge, so I had to regain my will to live. As you can imagine, it took quite a while.”
Peter took this in silently, still petting Butterfingers. Then he smiled. It was a hesitant, fragile thing, but it was there.
That discovery had been a new one just this morning. Tony had attempted to gain entry to Steve’s floor for the fourth time, and had been denied yet again. Whatever else he and Steve had been to one another, the guy had never just straight up refused to see him. Tony had stood at the threshold to the elevators, pondering whether it was worth breaching Cap’s trust to use his override codes, when he’d felt a heaviness against his wrist. Not painful, not too heavy, just sort of insistent. Like it wanted Tony to know it was there. (Oh great. Now he was anthropomorphizing a watch. These people were truly going to ruin him.)
More crashing and shattering sounds filled the other end of the line, Tony’s rage and hurt apparently too much for words. Steve waited it out, unsure what to say that wouldn’t risk making it worse but entirely unwilling to abandon the other man now. (The way his version of Steve had apparently already done. How could he not have listened? Why would he have brushed Tony’s apparently entirely correct fears off like they meant nothing?)
“I just expect you to continue being an idiot?” MJ suggested helpfully. Peter beamed and nodded, taking another celebratory drink.
“Here. Yeah. That’s maybe a good place to start. What made you sure, apparently correctly, that if you ran to Tony Stark after fighting with me that he’d let you have a sleepover?”
Tired, alone, and scared, Tony leans on some of his oldest friends. Meanwhile, the team struggles to piece together what happened in the MCU-verse and where they go from here.
Rather than webbing he walked to where he was headed, using the time to try to sort through his racing thoughts. When he neared the front door of the building, he drew his phone out. He didn’t have Gwen’s number, but he wrote on the wall of the Facebook event page.
“You’re going to have to tell me what it is you’ve figured out. Also stop snarking at JARVIS and wasting our questions man!”
Dummy was holding it by simple ribbon (probably there just because the box itself was too large for the bot to be able to grasp.) Tony took it, glancing around at the room’s very anxious-looking inhabitants. It was hand carved, he could tell that almost immediately; factory production left a different kind of trace on material, made it smooth and sanitized. This was still meticulously made, a dark stained wood with beautiful brass hardware, but it was also full of the kinds of small imperfections that could only be the result of being worked on by a single set of hands.
Honestly, Tony hadn’t wanted to stay on this topic any longer than he had to. But they had still all seemed so freaked out that he’d learned about the circumstances of his counterpart’s death alone. Even Clint was uncharacteristically solemn, and he’d stopped trying to convince Tony that the banana Runts were not, in fact, garbage food for garbage people as Tony had insisted they were. So maybe, Tony had decided, maybe he could use the situation to try to comfort them.
Another author interjection: this one also takes place in the past from where the main story is now, in the few days between Chapters 35 and 36.
“Of course Sir. The Yankees defeated the White Sox this evening, though popular opinion has it that an officiating error was what truly cost Chicago the game. The Dow Jones has plunged another 1100 points, but analysts suggest…”
Peter encounters his first really formidable fight in a while; Tony handles it about as well as you'd expect.
“Safeword,” Phil murmured. The usual crispness of his constants was noticeably smoother, Tony noted in surprise. It was the first real-world evidence he’d seen to support any of what Bruce had said yesterday, and of all of them he’d certainly never expected to see it from
“Lamar isn’t with SHIELD. Seeing as you are no longer with the agency yourself, it seemed sensible to cast a broader net based on need and fit.”
“Can you be quiet for just a--oh, here we go.”  Bruce typed in a few more key-strokes, waited for it to process, then a few more.  On the monitor in front of him, a split-screen of what looked like security camera footage appeared.  Each screen showed a different tiny room.  Each tiny room had four things in it--a cot, a toilet, a sink, and a person.
Thanos was coming.  Through the connections both Nebula and Carol had, they heard.  He was on his way.  One day.  Maybe two.
Steve rode it out, barely bracing himself against the ‘Cuda’s leather dash with one hand.  “You trying to kill us, Stark?” he asked mildly.
Nat made him dance at the reception. She pulled him onto the dancefloor first, wrapping him up in her arms and holding him extra tight. “Thank you,” she whispered in his ear as they swayed together.
Tony was lying in his bed when he came back out. His eyes were soft with sleepiness, but he smiled up at Steve and reached for him. “C’mere,” he said. “I want you.”
“Let me help,” Dugan said, but Steve shook his head and hitched Bucky up a little higher on his shoulder. He let out a guttural moan, and then was quiet again.
Slowly, limbs heavy, hearts heavier, they all got off the bus again. Steve and a couple others went to see if they could help. The driver let them. He was as anxious to get them home as they were. He’d been in the Guard a long time himself. He knew how they felt.
feeling had followed them through the door.  It hung around them in a haze, existed between them like a piano wire tuned two octaves too tight.  Tony fancied he could hear Steve’s heart in his chest thumping as crazily as his own. The scent of Skin Bracer was sharp and welcoming.
Nat took point from there, and she led them through the darkened hallways.  Bruce had told her how to get to Steve’s room and she led them to it unerringly.  They only saw one other person, a pretty blonde nurse, and Wanda worked her magic on her too.  Tony didn’t ask where she’d ended up.  He was just going to assume Wanda would put her somewhere nice.  He had too much to worry about without adding the nurse’s dreams into the mix.  A low-grade panic was busy swirling its way through him.  His head felt hot, his hands and feet, cold.  A bunch of butterflies had taken up residence in the pit of his stomach, and the flap of their wings beat out one word in unison:  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.
“I’m peachy, Dr. Banner,” he said.  “Fit as a fiddle.  Fine as paint.  Cunning as a cat a-running.  Did I miss any?”
Tony said no.  But not right away.  There had been a pause, a pregnant, silent, thirty-second pause while he considered it.  While he weighed the world against a quiet life with Steve.  Thirty seconds had not seemed like a long time to him, but to Steve, who had apparently not been sleeping, it must have felt like an eternity.
In the end, they went with semi-casual suits and ties for the guys.  Nat had lobbied for a shirt and tie for the ladies too, citing the combined punch of equality and sexiness, but buckled under the apocalyptic force of Steve’s puppy-dog eyes and said she’d wear a dress.  She wasn’t sorry.  The smile he gave her was worth it.
Steve led him there by the hand, going through the tiny kitchen to a small bedroom tucked behind it. There was room for a bed, a desk, and a bookcase crammed with books, and that was all. It was a quarter the size of Tony’s own room, and was painfully neat while his own was a wild disarray of
,” Steve said, but he felt better. So much better. He moved his hand over Tony’s body again. Not using much pressure, just wanting to feel him. Just wanting to feel the way Tony moved against him.
Steve’s hands wanted to move to Tony’s hips. Wanted to squeeze him, and pull him even tighter against him, but they didn’t. That training overrode his desire again, and he was grateful. And hateful. All at the same time. “It’s a ‘let’s get coffee in the morning’,” he said, and shoved his hands into his pockets before they could break their training and just do whatever they wanted instead. “But just as friends, okay?
“I guess I can kind of see why you liked me before,” Steve said suddenly, and the change in subject made Tony feel a little dizzy.
brought it to him, and if Steve could compromise his coffee principles sometimes, Tony thought he could reciprocate on the caffeine.
had. That much was so obvious it had smacked him in the face the entire time they had spent in each other’s presence tonight. Steve had been cold. Steve had been distant. Steve had all but told him in plain old English that he wished Tony would just leave him alone, and still...here he was. Standing on this stoop in the almost-fall chill, lifting his hand to knock on the door. Watching in fascination as it rose, knocked three times, and fell.
She reached in and pulled out a can of Coke.  She didn’t open it, just held it between her hands, waiting.  She knew him, knew of his need to be in control, and let it happen, allowing him the illusion even though she would dictate how the conversation went.  Her trust in him was absolute--as much as it was with Clint--but sometimes he needed guidance to get to where he needed to go.  She could do that for him.
Undeterred, Tony came into the kitchen.  Steve was still at the stove and Tony crowded up against the back of the chair.  He leaned over him, pressing against his shoulder.  “Let me know if you get any ideas, ‘kay?” he said against Steve’s ear.  “We don’t want you starting any fires you can’t put out.”
“I’ll bet you are,” he said, feeling his heart swell. Maybe he should be scared, he thought, that this little girl had gotten so attached to him so fast, but he wasn’t. He wasn’t scared at all. And if he was scared of anything, it was that. The fact that Morgan being attached to him
Tony took a step toward him. “It isn’t?” he asked, and the tiger was gone. Eeyore was back. Sad and lonely.
Steve left the house two and a half hours later. He was exhausted, but he felt like it was worth it. Tony had been right. It had been a very rewarding experience.
Morgan got over any shyness she felt as soon as they stepped into the main aquarium building and saw the giant replica of a pirate ship.
He crossed the short distance from the ‘Cuda’s bumper to the door of the warehouse.  The ground was mostly dirt out here.  Rich, dark, fertile earth.  Even now, in late winter, tiny green shoots of underbrush were peeking out of the ground, creating a soft carpet for Tony to walk on.  In a month, it would be a riot of green with wildflowers and the beginnings of ivy climbing the side of the warehouse.  It would be beautiful.  The lush urgency of nature overtaking the manmade structure, covering it, growing over it, bringing it to its metaphorical knees.  There was some kind of lesson there.  Tony knew there was.  Just as he knew that Steve would grasp it immediately.
Wherever the light didn’t directly hit, the gloom still lingered.  Tony’s eyes searched each pocket of darkness, looking for a shadow that was maybe a little more distinct, a little more substantial.  He didn’t want to just call out.  It seemed too aggressive somehow.  The last thing Tony wanted to appear right now was aggressive.
Steve leaned into Tony’s hand, resting his head in his palm. “I don’t know,” he said, and closed his eyes. “I’m tired.”
He answered the letters with ones of his own. Long, tortured, impassioned letters filled with the words and promises Tony had asked him for while they lay in his bed. Steve was no poet. The words came out in a jumble, with little regard for punctuation or sentence structure, but he knew Tony wouldn’t care. It didn’t matter. The words were what mattered. The feelings behind them were what mattered. For Tony and for himself. It just felt good to write them down. To give voice to the desperation in his heart.
“Steve,” he choked out, and then he was coming, squeezing his eyes shut even tighter, fisting his hands in the sheet. He felt it when Steve came, and reached blindly up to pull him closer until he was lying on top of him, panting. “Baby,” he whispered, and curled his hand possessively around the back of his neck, holding him, running his fingers through his damp hair, lying quietly together while they both came down. After a while, he turned his head until his lips found the side of Steve’s neck. “You’re so amazing,” he whispered. “So beautiful. So perfect.”
“I--and correct me if I’m wrong, because god knows I’ve been wrong before when it comes to you--but I get the impression you don’t like it much," Tony said. "It
Tony wanted to protest, but he let the words die on his lips.  He’d pushed him enough for one night.  Maybe it was better to let it lie.  Instead, he nodded and stood up.  “I’ll go shower and stuff so you can--” he gestured vaguely at the couch.
It wasn’t much really, just a simple, Saturday afternoon sketch, but there was a refinement to it that raised it far above mere “scribbles”.  A grace that felt delicate and brave at the same time.  Looking at it filled Tony’s heart with wonder.
“That can be arranged,” Tony said, then pulled out of his arms. “Do you want to go be snuggly in your room?” Steve thought about what his mom had said, and thought it didn’t
Decided to make this it's own separate chapter. It's short, but I had a suck day yesterday and wanted a little sugar to get me through. So, I'll share with you. That's just the kind of gal I am :)
“You two have been down here a long time,” Rhodey said, coming in and glancing around the room.  He looked at Steve then Tony, scrutinizing each of them in turn.  “I’m not seeing any blood.  And you’ve both got all of your limbs intact, so I guess that’s a good sign.”
“You don’t think that hurt?  Watching that?  Hearing from Stephen fucking Strange that you tried it again?”  He clenched his fist on his knee.  “How many times
Tony laughed again and pulled out of her arms. It was jagged and brittle. It sounded frightening coming out of his young, pretty mouth. “Sorry, Mrs. Rogers. But we’re out of time.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair. “No. Won’t work, Pep. I’ve got to be home by seven. Tell him to get a hotel room, have some dinner, take in the Tulsa nightlife, and come in the morning.”
Steve nodded. His eyes were serious, his mouth a firm line. He would. He would do anything. Anything. The thought frightened him a little, but it was true. “Yeah,” he said. “I would.”
They ate at a pleasant steakhouse, then said good-bye to her folks at the door.  Tony kissed the mother’s cheek, and shook the father’s hand.  Gina said she’d see them later, then she led Tony away, deeper into Manhattan while the parents went back to Long Island.
“Oh,” he managed. His mind tried for something else, some smart, witty thing to say to make this a little easier on him, but it seemed to have short-circuited somewhere around
Tony watched the exam, watched him take blood, then listened as Strange lectured Steve on vitamins, exercise, and diet.  Steve didn't mention that when he'd overdone it, then tried to take a pre-dinnertime walk the week before, he'd almost passed out on the side of the road.  Tony didn't mention it either. In fact, he kept silent through the entire appointment. He just sat, holding Steve's hand when he could, trying to concentrate.  It was harder than it should have been. He kept finding himself distracted by hating Stephen Strange.
it was silly,” Tony said, and now Steve could see the way he was moving his thumb over them, touching them, holding them in his hand like he didn’t want to let them go. “I told myself nobody
Tony popped another piece of bread into his mouth and chewed thoughtfully, watching out the window.  Steve had taken off his flannel and just had a t-shirt on. It clung lovingly to his chest and back, but not as tightly as it had a year ago.  He'd lost some weight. Tony didn't think it was really noticeable yet to anyone but him. For the most part, Steve still looked as god-like as ever.
“And what if I decide I want to stay? What if that’s my choice?” Tony demanded to know, an edge of defiance in his tone that was so entirely Tony that Steve couldn’t help but smile even through the tears that definitely were not going to remain at bay much longer.
“I thought, uh, check-in first?” Bruce’s hands stilled, just long enough for the thin layer of honey he’d been adding to the parfait to become a thick, uneven blob. (It wasn’t like it mattered if Bruce had given up on check-ins, right? Tony hadn’t liked them anyway. The disappointment that had him feeling like his stomach was sinking into his shoes was just about the loss of something familiar, that was all.)
As if being given permission to acknowledge the name, the face, that he’d been forcing from his mind all evening, Tony’s entire being surrendered to the encompassing ache that was the loss of Peter. It wasn’t identical to the pain of watching the boy fade away into dust in his arms.
They went around in circles like that for close to an hour before Steve stood and, much to the protest of both of his most trusted colleagues, summarily ejected them from the room. Talia still did not sit with the room emptied, but when Steve leaned on the edge of the desk rather than circling back around to the chair, she met his eyes for the first time.
He shoved the dildo into himself, no longer focused one reaching his prostate but on working it exactly as Steve had said. He clenched all of his internal muscles, let it rub and nudge at him and clutched at the toy in return, and it still wasn’t enough, the thing was so smooth and thin, but he was trying, Steve said he could and he was going to fucking try to live up to that no matter what. His efforts were rewarded when Steve finally gave him permission to move to the next dildo in the set. It wasn’t much bigger, still wouldn’t do more than whisper against his prostate every once in a while, but it at least had a bit of texture to it, a couple of ridges that caught the edge off his hole when it slid inside and scraped gently at his insides.
Anyway, they’d made it through that horrible episode, and then it had been Clint, Phil and Natasha’s time to shine as they’d trained Tony to match his posture, body language, and expressions to those of Mark II, right down to the last raise of an eyebrow. (Mark II, apparently, had usually cocked his left while Tony tended to lift his right.)
“And having always been very into self-care, it makes complete sense that you’re suddenly going to bed at two in the afternoon and staying there until dinner,” Bucky muses aloud.
Then, after glancing around to make sure no one was paying attention, he scaled the wall. Looking for a specific spot in a building he’d never actually seen from the outside before proved more challenging than he would have thought, but eventually he found what he was looking for. Just like the last time he’d seen it, the room was painted an off-white that was the familiar nightmare of renters everywhere, but the walls were almost entirely covered in posters and shelves heaving with books and memorabilia. Ned sat in his room, reading an Octavia Butler book that was a long-loved favourite. Peter took a deep, slow breath, and then knocked on the glass.
Peter made his way toward the sound and found, shoved together in a corner as if the empty room had been somehow pressed for space, Tony’s three most prized bots. DUM-E, the one who had made the noise at Peter’s entrance, whirred again and extended his claw. Without thinking, Peter extended his hand. In a house that felt so over-populated by ghosts, encountering the solid metal of the bot felt strangely shocking.
May, after an almost reflexive laugh at the absurdity of meeting someone from another universe, had remained quiet and unreadable through Tony’s entire explanation.
I (the writer) am taking this one instead of the Doctor, because I WAS SO UNBELIEVABLY EXCITED TO GET THIS QUESTION! I’ve never gotten questions about writing/process stuff before, and it’s something I really love talking about. So thank you, anon!
to say then was everything. She didn’t ask who Peter was to Tony, whether he was his biological kid or his—what had Strange said, his ward?—or something else. She didn’t ask if Peter had died, or how. She relayed the facts as she understood them and nothing more, and it was the kindest thing anyone on the Avengers had done for him, maybe in years. So instead of insulting her intelligence and her skills by lying, or just telling her to fuck off, he begged. He gave her unprecedented power over his very fucking soul, and pleaded with her to keep it safe.
, powers. One of them had a damn dinosaur! Even in his most fevered fantasies of what it might be like not to be alone with the secret of Spider-Man, Peter could never have dared imagine something like this.
, for god’s sake. Coulson still didn’t speak, though in response to Steve’s quiet confession he stood and retrieved a familiar box from a drawer in the plum-coloured coffee table. It contained the metal spheres Phil usually used to start scenes as a submissive.
“Did I do something to piss you off? Because if I did, it’s really not cool to take it out on me professionally. It’s something the other version of my team might have done, but I’d kind of stopped expecting it from you lot.”
“Shh. You’re fine.” Where it had been stuttering and anxious just minutes before, Bruce’s voice had dropped into that lower, smoother cadence that Tony had come to learn meant he was feeling the press of Dominance. “You just need to slow down. This is about getting food into you, but in our world it’s about more than that. It’s a way for a Dominant to demonstrate commitment and attention, and it’s a way for the submissive to place an immediate, essential need in their Dominant’s care. You are under no pressure to eat more or less than you want, or at any particular pace. Your only job in the world right now is to enjoy, and to tell me if you want more or less of something in particular. Let’s try again.”
“Hey, I never promised you were picking the easy option,” Steve laughed. “I’d like to tell you that she’d avoid them if she knew you hated them so much, but I don’t think I could quite manage to keep a straight face.” It was the closest either of them had come to acknowledging the reason Steve had been asked to Masdee’s rooms that evening, but she still didn’t seem inclined to fully address the topic. Instead, she made a thoroughly disappointed face at the admittedly lacklustre cookies that had come with their meal. “Do you…did everything go alright, with the contract?”
“Space, actually. The first time out against Thanos we tried to take the fight to him. Followed him to his home planet, actually, and almost had him beat—but then we lost. Most everyone there with me,”
“Kid!” Bucky hailed, jogging over with one hand still rubbing at his sore behind. “Thank God, I could use some air support here. No one told me that Wilson would be using his wings and the shield.”
“Mr. Stark regrets he cannot join you this evening. He has ordered specialty popcorn and candy in apology, and he hopes you enjoy your evening.”
“Please. Please, Clint, fucking please. I need, you’re too, it’s, yesyesyes.” What started as a plea ended as more of a chant, because the second Tony took the cue from the story and started begging in earnest, Clint’s hand was finally wrapped all the way around him, jerking him off with brutal efficiency. It felt like Clint had about thirty fingers; he used the pads of each digit to create constantly varying degrees of pressure, a maddening dance that made it impossible for Tony’s brain to track individual sensations. He’d never felt so entirely outside his mind before, so purely made of base reaction.
somewhere else, and that’s easy for us to forget or minimize sometimes because it sounded like it was pretty unhappy in a lot of ways, but it was still a life. I think—I think you don’t know how to face being here, and especially being permanently changed by your presence in this universe, because you weren’t given a choice, and you’re mourning that on top of everything else.”
“No,” he said, as if speaking it out loud might make his refusal to let his mind go down that particular avenue might make it more powerful. “I can’t. No.”
“Bruce?” Steve stepped out of the elevator and attempted to keep his annoyance out of his tone. The length of check-ins varied depending on what issues were coming up and whether or not Bruce had specific tests or procedures he needed to perform. But it was close to an hour past when Bruce and Tony had been scheduled to arrive at training, and instead of announcing their impending arrival, JARVIS had instead summoned the team up to the penthouse. The others had speculated about the cause of the delay on the way up, but Steve was almost entirely focused on his own itchy impatience to get them all back in the gym. Nothing made his anxiety about what was coming easier to cope with than the constant proof of Tony’s extreme competence; no one had even put a lasting dent in the Bleeding Edge armour yet, to Natasha’s growing frustration.
“That’s because there’s a lot of guesswork involved here,” Coulson explained patiently. “From what I’ve put together, Tony suspects that the group that attacked us and as much as told Steve they were training to come for Tony were sent by SI, who is trying to protect themselves from news of the coverup they instigated going public as a result of Steve’s pilot program.” Thor nodded, motioning for Coulson to continue. “CNOW is one of the groups that has been lobbying hardest for SHIELD to abandon the trial program, mostly under the guise of extremely bigoted claims about how going against one’s ‘natural’ orientation is unhealthy and an affront against God.”
“If you keep it up I’m coming for you too, date or not,” he warned Tony with a smile way too charming to be human.
“You’re so good sweetheart. Can you listen to me for a minute, really listen?” Tony nodded, which somehow turned into him nuzzling into the warmth Steve’s palm. “We still have things to learn about each other, and I’m sure it won’t always go smoothly; it never seems to with us, does it?” The questions was pretty clearly a rhetorical one, so Tony didn’t bother stopping his needy nuzzling of Steve to formulate an answer. “I know that sometimes you’ll need to fight and snap and show your teeth before you let go, especially with me. Sometimes I think you just do it because it’s fun, and on those occasions I will be delighted to put you down hard and forcefully. But other times, like tonight, I think you push because…because you don’t quite trust that I'm going to stay, and you'd rather I leave on your terms than mine. That sound about right?” Tony closed his eyes; this was answer enough. “I know that for the most part nothing will fix that but time, and I’m willing to put that in. But is there anything I can do for you now, something to put you a little more at ease?”
“And you? You’re damn good at your job, Steve. I wouldn’t want to take something from you just because I’m feeling a little unsettled.”
“And that’s exactly why I didn’t want you looking at his stuff. If the lot of you are going to have any hope at all, then they have to stop looking at you as the old Tony, and you really gotta stop trying to
Tony’s kneeling pillow was already set up in front of Steve’s preferred spot on the couch. It didn’t even feel like pretending, really, the notion that his entire world could centre around Steve and the rest of the team. Already he could feel all of his concerns that weren’t about the inhabitants of the Tower becoming distant and muted, mere abstractions compared to the crisp clarity of serving Steve, being what and who he needed. He sighed happily and pressed his cheek against Steve’s leg.
Not everything was big, intimidating structures, though. There was a set of drawers against one wall that wouldn’t have been out of place in a regular bedroom, though Tony assumed the contents were far more interesting than socks or t-shirts. The reclaimed wood of the drawers, full of beautiful imperfections and inconsistencies, matched the frame of the truly massive bed that took pride of place in the middle of the room. Off to one side of the bed was another area; it might be too large to properly be called a nook, but that was the name Tony was going with in his head, because it was recessed and somewhat secluded from the rest of the room. There was another mattress, thinner and much smaller than the bed, covered in a thick stack of folded blankets that all looked so cozy that the urge to dive into them face-first was embarrassingly strong. The bed stopped a few feet short of where the nook itself ended; the rest of the nook contained a curved oil diffuser, some candles, massage oils, a white box with a speaker, and a small basket of fuzzy socks. His brain focused in on the latter, recalling Bruce sliding a similar pair onto Tony’s own feet back. (Aftercare. This whole area was just for aftercare.)
For a few long beats, they all watched as Peter visibly wrestled with his desire to stay angry and resentful towards Tony while also wanting desperately to believe that he was truly wanted and cared for on his own terms. Tony himself appeared to have reached his own threshold for intimate and personal conversation. He watched Peter struggle to take the news in with an exhausted, almost hopeless expression, as if certain he had already lost the boy.
Bruce didn’t immediately jump into diagnosing or questioning Tony, though. He began moving through the quiet, familiar motions of making himself a cup of tea; Tony watched, comforted by the routine, and embarrassingly eager to prepare for being able to make Bruce’s tea for him one day with the same precision that the others could make Tony’s coffee. He got the sense that Bruce was still observing him even through this, but he didn’t speak again until he was sitting down at the table across from Tony, a steaming cup of Kashmiri Chai in his hand.
“I’m, I, Clint, Sir, please, please, I—because, because I—please, Clint, help me, I can’t.” The steady thud of the strap didn’t let up, but Clint did take at least some form of mercy.
Whelp, that one might not have been the format a lot of you were expecting, I know! And of course we'll be checking in a little more intimately with our people in the chapters to come. But getting a sense of the broader view of their actions seemed like a fun and useful way to go this time around.
“Tell me how I’m supposed to do this. Please. I get that it’s weird and I know it’s kind of selfish and crappy of me, and believe me I wouldn’t be coming to you if I could think of other options. But the team is all worried about exerting too much influence over my answers, and I’ve already talked to Rhodey about my sex life more in the last 24 hours than in the rest of my life total, and it’s still a little too weird to think about going to Pep with this—”
He wasn’t entirely sure what he expected to see when the doors slid open. Tony thus far had managed to be nearly unpredictable. One second he’d be doing stuff like paying Peter’s hospital bills or strongly hinting at buying May a car, and the next he’d be pulling all the way back, never uttering a word about Peter skipping out on planned meals or forgetting to text after returning from time as Spider-Man.
Thus had begun the even more extended journey of reaching out to independent leather workers. This had been the most contentious aspect of the process thus far. Nearly everyone had connected with someone that another team member had vetoed, for various reasons: Natasha hadn’t liked the extent to which one of the candidates was a fan. Thor, in an overprotective fit, had dismissed another for suggesting that certain designs wouldn’t look good on Tony. There had been numerous heated discussions, and toward the end Phil had really started to wonder if their ‘all for one’ policy might end up failing them this time.
Content Notes: The first section of the chapter returns to Tony's eating issues, with Rhodey experimenting with a new way to help Tony with them. Start reading after the first section break if this is a trigger area.
Aside from the memorial, Strange had made himself scarce after Tony’s not-death, but some part of Peter still found itself entirely unsurprised to have the guy strolling into his apartment through a portal where the wall should have been. (Peter was too young, wasn’t he, to be getting numb to this kind of stuff? Would it ever feel cool again instead of just kind of exhausting?) Harley, at least, toppled off the table where his feet were propped and landed on the floor with a shout.
“‘m I in trouble?” he mumbled as Clint’s hand slid to his back to guide him to the bedroom. He tried very hard not to think about how much he sounded like a guilty kid while Clint huffed a reluctant laugh.
“I thought we could go grab some burgers before the fancy party. There’s never enough food at these kinds of events for someone with my metabolism, and I'd really like to spend some time with you without so many eyes on us.” He held the flowers out to Tony, who mumbled something he hoped sounded thankful while he dug through the kitchen in search of a vase.
He pointed to a green shake after a moment of consideration. After he ate they were undoubtedly going to want him to say
Recalling Rhodey’s account of how the room had been made, his eyes found Bucky’s, begging for and trying to hide from an explanation he wasn’t yet ready to face. The other man stared back at him, gaze hooded and sharp. With no hint of the hesitation that had shaped most of their interactions outside of shared submissive headspace, Bucky reached out, taking one of Tony’s hands and leading him over to the chest of drawers to press his open palm down on top of the wood. Instinctively, Tony’s fingers spread, feeling out the shifts in the grain. Some were small and subtle; others, like the thick, dark growth ring under his index, drew attention to themselves, refusing to be smoothed away or made to match what was around them. The metaphor there was obvious, but Tony didn’t let his mind grasp for it, taking comfort instead in the simple material reality of love and care and attention that surrounded him.
“Oh, the brain whammy? No, she definitely did that. Just like with your Tony, it was what spurred on the creation of Ultron.”
“Earthiness is next to coffee godliness, Barton,” he snapped back. Even though he suspected he was filling in some well-worn lines of Mark II’s, it was damn true; nothing lingered on the tongue and paired perfectly with almost every breakfast food as the Sumatran roast he knew Clint was talking about.
Tony went back to fucking himself as hard and deeply as he could, but he still tried to hold off as best he could. But it was hopeless. He came with a wail less than two minutes latter, spattering the sheets and Steve’s chest and a bit of the crop.
Phil’s hands were quick and competent at Tony’s wrists, and he stayed close by after he finished the tie, close enough that Tony could feel the other man’s breath at his back.
“It’s Saturday morning,” he repeated for what was probably the sixth time as he blearily followed Coulson, who was clad in a thoroughly uncharacteristic set of flannel, kitten-covered pyjamas, down the hall. (A grinning Steve had insisted that Tony dress in a similar pair, which he was just realizing  now were printed with cartoon mice dressed in lab coats.)
Sam was the first to move past disapproval and into concern. He followed MJ to Peter’s room and helped her tear the place apart in search of the inhaler. They found it, eventually, in a box that also contained a bunch of video games and a teddy bear dressed like Iron Man. The latter was worn and patched in a couple of places, clearly a very well-loved artifact from Peter’s childhood. Which made her realize that she had an actual adult to carry some of the burden of the immediate situation, so she could close her eyes and allow herself a rare few seconds to feel horribly, painfully sad about all of it. About how shitty and how good a person Tony Stark had been, about the fact that whether he’d deserved Peter’s level of regard for him or not, he’d had it. And then he’d died. MJ was pretty good at putting on a confident front, but she was quickly coming to understand that she had no real idea how to help the shattered boy he’d left behind, who was grieving not just Tony’s loss but the death of his own chance at childhood.
“That’s really good. I know we covered this when we first discussed moving you in here, but he and your aunt are welcome here anytime. I agree it’s a good idea having you relocate until the worst of this mess blows over, but none of us want you to isolate yourself from the people in your life.”
The yell hadn’t even sounded like much, not at first. If he hadn’t been webbing his way toward the ground on the hunt for a soft pretzel he might have missed it entirely. Mentally predicting either a bar fight or a disagreement over parking, he sighed regretfully and changed the angle of his next web.
“Peter?” May was half out of breath and sounded absolutely frantic. From the disparate collection of background noises that included a siren, a distant argument in Dari, and the clang of something metal being moved or dropped, Tony suspected she was outside, already combing the streets for her nephew. And this was precisely why he hadn’t been willing to wait until morning to contact her. May had made a mistake in kicking Peter out, sure, but he she was neither a cruel nor a vindictive person. She was always going to regret it sooner rather than later.
Tony did remember clearly that the team had promised a full day of non-sexual submission led by Rhodey. The prospect of playing with Rhodey while he wasn’t edging on depression at being separated from the rest of his partners had been intriguing. But the  actual concept had felt curiously abstract. Sure, some parts of Tony’s submission weren’t sexual, like the check-ins and the pictures and Phil’s awful, awful writing assignments which were going to be the death of Tony, but those were brief episodes often sandwiched in between the sexy stuff. How were they going to fill a whole day?
“You’re fine,” Natasha grunted, seizing the opportunity to pull her leg away from Bruce and set it back down on the bench.
“I’m not saying I think you’re wrong,” she said carefully. (He didn’t even care that her feet were up on the table again, not if someone was finally going to listen to him.) “The change in him has seemed sudden, and since you said something I have noticed that he’s been avoiding being with any of us one-on-one. It’s always as a group. But I’m also not convinced this is anything more than a new submissive trying a little too hard to please his Dominants. He loves you, Steve, he adores you, and unlike in his own world you actually love and value him back. That’s a powerful thing, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence that this behaviour started after your first scene together.”
“Steve,” Tony repeated obediently, feeling some of his earlier resistance start to trickle away at the simplicity of the order, which hadn’t even been an order so much as a request anyway. Steve’s thumb stroked across his cheekbone in quiet approval. “Sir,” he added on impulse, because it felt good and right and safe to offer the honorific to Steve, who shivered the way he always did when Tony said it.
This time it wasn’t Pepper that met Tony at the doors to SI: it was Natasha. She wore a green dress that paired perfectly with her vivid hair and creamy skin. The style, a sleeveless midi, was relatively simple, which highlighted the cut-outs that stretched up Natasha’s right side, revealing glimpses of her muscular back and abdomen. She had paired it with 3/4 length black lace Bolero, which served as her only other protection against the cold of evening. When her eyes fell on Tony her lips quirked upwards just slightly, a perfect, deadly mix of strength and beauty that had him grinning back even through his exhaustion. He barely even registered the flashes of cameras, especially when Natasha strode forward, reaching out to grip Tony around the back of the neck with cool fingers. As a greeting, it somehow felt more intimate than a kiss; he didn’t even have to make himself tilt his own head downward, though after all his training and practicing over the weekend he knew it was expected.
Tony hadn’t been considering it, not really. He didn’t even know if the version of the suit stored in the housing unit he wore could even be repaired; if not, he’d be starting from scratch, which would take weeks given that the Tony on this side hadn’t done much with nanotech yet. But he waited for Coulson to explain with as neutral an expression as he could manage.
He tried to keep his support on the silent side, not wanting to overstep in the very first scene they were allowing him to be involved in. And truly, this wasn’t a punishment Rhodey wanted or needed to have a major role in. Unlike the team, Tony had let James be involved in the process of unravelling his orientation. He owed Rhodey nothing in the way of apologies or atonement, which meant that Rhodey could just be there to anchor and protect his friend as he’d always tried to do.
“Nah. It’s not. I’d do anything for him, for any version of him. Helping them out is honestly more of a side benefit. Plus they’re good people; it wasn’t their job to force the other Tony not to get totally—I don’t know, caught up, obsessed, whatever it was that made him fall away from everything outside this Tower.” Pepper was so tired and open, wearing her emotions and her thoughts so much more plainly than she typically did, that Rhodey couldn’t help but feel compelled into a similar honesty. “I did wonder sometimes, if things would have turned out different if I’d fought harder for him, for our friendship. I know it’s ridiculous, nothing could have stopped the Witch—”
loved, that I would force you to see him with your own stubborn eyes, so that one day you’ll be able to accept it. And Stevie…I know you. However lapsed your relationship to religion and all of that is now…you’ll never forgive yourself if you don’t tell him goodbye.” (Goodbye. How could he ever hope to say something so mundane and final to someone as singularly remarkable as Tony? There had to be something better, some way for language to accommodate the immensity of what they had lost.)
Bruce muttered something, something that sounds suspiciously like ‘It isn’t you I’m angry at.’ But Tony made certain he was far enough away to pretend not to have heard a word.
.” Peter meant to say more, wanted to tell Ned that it was Peter himself who would benefit most from the chance to huddle over Lego with his friend again, even just for the length of time it would take to clean up the mess. But he closed his mouth before any of those words spilled out. Ned had suffered over the past year, just as alone as Peter had been, and it wasn’t fair to expect to be able to just stroll back into his life now.
“No. Pepper, have I said just a straight no to anything you’ve asked so far? Hear how serious I am.”
The days following Tony and Clint’s date were decidedly odd. Coulson dropped out of their work sessions, rarely leaving Rogers’ floor. Which was fine, it wasn’t as if Tony didn’t have plenty to do that didn’t require Phil’s presence, but it seemed entirely unlike Coulson to abandon anything mid-project. And it wasn’t just him; the rest of the tower was filled with a weird kind of tension. The team still made sure to spend plenty of time in the penthouse, but they were all clearly preoccupied with whatever was going on with Cap.
First argument is an interesting one, because it of course depends whether you’re referring to specific disagreements between individuals, or more wide-scale disagreements amongst the Avengers as a romanic/sexual unit. We’ve seen several instances of the former, of course. As for the later, I suppose the team has not yet had cause for an argument of that scale, though again, perhaps something on the horizon given the fraught circumstances they’re handling at the moment.
Next to him, Rhodey sighed and reached across the elevator to slip a hand around the back of Tony’s neck. His grip was tight and warm, and despite himself Tony’s shoulders inched ever so slightly away from his ears.
Given that he hasn’t spent any significant time inside Ned’s room in over a year, it should feel more startling than it does for Peter to wake up there. And perhaps this might have been the case if Ned’s Mother, overjoyed by Peter’s sudden and inexplicable return, were not flooding the apartment with the sounds and smells of her cooking. No one could cook a breakfast feast like Mrs. Leeds. The combined adrenaline and intense feelings of the day before had Peter half prepared to charge down the hall and stuff his face full of sausages before Ned could wake up and be in competition for such precious resources. This would, of course, be a real dick move given their extremely recent reconciliation, but he still let himself fantasize about diving headfirst into the pan for a good half a minute before he reached up from the pillow-nest he’d made on the floor to nudge Ned.
Now…now Steve was done. A distant part of him was aware that Domen probably had more to say. Hell, he knew enough of protocols to be aware she would at least want to debrief, make sure that Steve wasn’t going to be on his own tonight. He wanted none of it. Steve had done what was asked of him, had spoken those hateful fucking words (deaddeaddead Tony was dead he was never coming back). He had nothing left to give.
), and he couldn’t quite keep back a shudder. “It's not all stress, of course, and the rise in cortisol is consistent across all orientations, so that wouldn’t actually help determine what someone's orientation was, it would just tell us that they have one. The main thing they’re looking for in those tests is levels of what are called subtonin and dominin. The relative presence of each is an accurate predictor of orientation in about eighty-five percent of cases.”
“Bruce. Get. JARVIS, send for Bruce.” Steve wanted to do it himself, was aware enough now to know he was being absurd, but Bruce was a doctor. He might find something Steve himself would miss in his panic. While they waited, Tony crawled his way into Steve’s lap, forcing Steve’s arms to encircle his waist.
Tony nodded again, feeling relief and gratitude start to gnaw at the edges of anxiety and shame. Phil was asking for such simple things: repeat this, confirm that. These were things Tony could do, things that didn’t make him feel smaller and more foolish than he already did.
Bruce also details the science of what could have happened to D/s Tony based on Howard's actions when he turned 14 (first mentioned last chapter.) While none of them actually happened, they're still severe and might be difficult to read.
Content Notes: Tony's food issues, specifically his near-starvation in space, is discussed in this chapter. If you want to avoid, skip from "He didn't know quite how tied up in knots..." until the end of that section.
Taskmaster was a mercenary through and through, though, which meant the amount of effort he put into any particular battle was directly proportionate to the amount he stood to gain through from a victory. Judging from the full-scale assault he had mounted today, the potential paycheque had to be absolutely enormous. Even Steve was panting a little with the exertion of dodging blows that so closely mirrored his own in strength and accuracy.
“The men we believe to be in charge of the rebel force are Kaikara and Ochen Ssenjovu, brothers. Those who are with them seek only financial gain, but investigation has revealed that these men may have more personal reasons for betraying their country’s agreement with Wakanda. We suspect they were initially not twins but triplets. The man we believe to be their brother died just prior to Wakanda revealing itself to the world, and of a condition that our country likely would have been able to treat. Our intelligence suggests that since learning of Wakanda’s true status, Ochen in particular has been seeking an opportunity for revenge.”
“Oh, did I not mention I’ve learned a few tricks since coming back?” Tony drawled. He went as far as to turn his back entirely on Taskmaster for several seconds in order to mix what looked like a gin and tonic. “I guess you were right. I didn’t come back exactly the same. Now, JARVIS calculates at least 27 different ways I could kill or permanently incapacitate your night now, but honestly the cleaning staff here has been through enough so I’d just as soon not. I suggest you take your own advice and know when it’s time to stop getting up. What do you say, pal?” The offer was punctuated by a series of screams from the comm unit in Taskmaster’s ear. Apparently, JARVIS and the rest of the team had stopped pulling their punches with the remainder of the enemy forces and had taken them all out within seconds. The silence that followed the cacophony was eerie, and broken only by the soft hum from the repulsors in the deflector shields that still flanked Taskmaster.
Thank you so very much, as always, for your comments and kudos. With Endgame so close on the horizon I'm feeling extra grateful for and emotional about the MCU fandom, which has been so consistently welcoming and kind to me even as a (relative) newcomer.
: Steve's therapy session in this chapter contains an extended and explicit conversation about the recurring pattern wherein his grief tends to manifest in the form of a death wish and corresponding attempts to seek out dangerous situations. As such, it has the potential to be massively triggering for anyone struggling in this area, or with self-harm (Steve's more passive behaviours, like remaining on the edge of Dom dep for so long, are explicitly framed this way). Please, please take care while reading; ask me any questions you need to before proceeding, or feel free to skip that section altogether. It begins with "Steve arrived at therapy feeling cocky" and continues through to the end of the chapter.
If Tony thought regular sceneing involved a lot of negotiation, that was nothing to how much discussion there was before Natasha finally had the paddle in her hand. He was sprawled out with his lower body firmly in her lap, the rest of him draped across the bed. Bruce had taken up a kneeling position by Tony’s head, and he reached out to stroke Tony’s hair as Tony’s body thrummed with a whole host of feelings he was unable to parse.
“I think they stuffed enough food into us last night that we should be allowed to abstain, personally.” Bucky chuckled.
I'm hoping to get some AskStrange responses posted tonight too, so feel free to keep those questions for the Doctor coming!
The offer of sleep medication had been tempting, damn tempting. Before this it had been months of deliberate deprivation, the team resting in shifts just long enough to prevent their bodies from entirely shutting down. Even Steve, who had the lowest sleep requirements of all of them, had been ragged and drawn as they pushed the serum beyond its limits. Now here Tony was, not just alive and safe enough to sleep, but somehow in the Tower in his own bed (well not quite—it was a touch firmer than his old mattress had been, but it was damn close) for the first time in years.
“Tire us out. Force us to get sloppy, make stupid mistakes, and at the same time get complacent, because most of these threats have been just barely threats at all. Most of you fools are not exactly known for your patience—it’s a smart game, really. But now that we know what they’re after, all we need to win is to make sure we do the opposite. Stay rested, patient, keep fighting smart. We hold pretty much all the cards here, so we just have to show them we’re just as willing to wait this out as they are.”
“How much did Peter explain before he told you? Did you let him finish, or did you just fuck off with the suit or something? Because it really doesn’t seem like the kid to just throw something like this at you and split.”
“Would you agree with that assessment?” Talia seemed surprised but gratified to be asked, and she gave the question a good deal of consideration.
Talia Avelino was undoubtedly been the most troublesome agent in SHIELD history. She was brilliant, there was no disputing that: off-the-charts IQ, frightening competence with every weapon SHIELD had, and the instincts for deception and manipulation of a young Natasha Romanov. (It was Steve’s sincerest hope that the two of them would never, ever meet.) She was also a category two submissive with a huge chip on her shoulder, and a near-complete disregard for orders, authority, or in today’s case, military property.
Tony started to tense up again as it neared bedtime, but that much they’d anticipated; this much unstructured time in a row had been necessary for all of them, but most submissives would be edgy with so little routine or clear expectations about what was to come. It was Phil who finally shut off the TV.
“We will also need to do some work thinking about the other side of this question of precarity and obligation: the demands you place on the people you love, especially Tony Stark. As you know, I haven’t spoken and will not be speaking to the version of him currently residing in this Tower. But for both of your sakes, I cannot in good conscience encourage any kind of relationship between you which will make Mr. Stark primarily responsible for your continued well-being and existence, which you have several times come close to implying the previous version of him was. You have to decide for yourself that you wish to live, Steve.”
“It’s a good thing that no one knows I’m seeing you as a patient. Otherwise I would be fielding a lot of questions about what on Earth I said to you in our sessions to make you resign as Director of SHIELD.”
“I didn’t mean to,” Bucky said miserably, and Tony would be damned if even his embarrassment was going to undo all the hard work he’d done to bring them to that point. He tipped his head, exposing the length of his neck the way all the Doms in the house seemed to love, and looked up at Bucky through slightly hooded eyes.
“Sir, lockdown of the workshop has been temporarily overridden. Shall I—” Tony had been sprawled across the floor of the workshop for what must have been close to three hours, or so the pain in his muscles as he scrambled abruptly to his feet suggested. His sense of time had gone a little bit sideways since the…episode with Rogers.
“I need…will you, I need you to do more with that than warm me up. There are...there's things I haven’t told you, and I want to, but I don’t know if I can—please.” Which, okay. He heard it. He got that he sounded…well, not good. It would have made less sense if Natasha
I'm catching up on a few weeks of Asks here, so if by any chance I missed yours, please let me know! The Doctor may have an ego on him, but he'd never leave anyone out intentionally.
“You don’t have to say it out loud. I’m not trying to get you to submit. I just want to hold onto whatever happened today for you, just for a little while.” Then Coulson held out his hands, palms up and held parallel between them. And Steve’s slow, numbed brain finally understood what was being offered: the chance to give over his problems, to hand them off to someone else. It was a perfect, horrible mirror of the way they would usually come together, and the grace and kindness of it stabbed Steve through the heart.
And it just kept getting weirder. Steve—sweet, ‘it runs on some form of electricity’ Steve, was the one to bring up using the Tower itself to their advantage, specifically a series of environmental controls and other hazards to strategically move Taskmaster’s army through the space.
“Well, that depends on what you mean by here, Birdbrain,” Stark’s voice replies. The snark is definitely on-brand for the guy, but there’s something a little bit off, too.
What was it like to see this version of Tony with fresh eyes? Was Sam already noting the tremor that often shook Tony’s left hand when he was anxious? Or the way that he wore his clothes looser than his counterpart typically chose? Could he sense the transparency about this Tony, the way he pretty much wore his heart on his sleeve at all times? Or maybe this was just Steve being self-centred all over again. Perhaps all Sam could see now was Riley, and the brutal lack of fairness that had returned a version of Steve’s love to him while Sam remained alone.
Steve's flashbacks also contain a brief representation of Tony in the immediate aftermath of being outed as a sub by Christine Everhart. He's drunk angry and hurting and tries to goad Steve into Dominating him, which Steve of course doesn't do. If you want to avoid that, just skip the italicized bit in Steve's section.
“I mean, technically speaking the me that’s here right now is an artificial intelligence. So not alive, strictly speaking, but not dead either.”
Rhodey dropped a scoop of butter into the pan and handed it off to Tony. “Put that on the burner over there, and turn the heat to medium, please.” Tony did as he was told with a grumble, his frustration heightened by the feeling of multiple pairs of eyes following the scene.  “I’m not necessarily an expert in starvation specifically, but I’ve helped enough of my guys through this kind of stuff after missions gone wrong that I do know it often comes down to feeling like you’re not in control of your relationship with food anymore. There’s lots of ways to try to change that, and we can do some experimenting to see what fits. Right now, the thing we’re going to try is getting you involved in the prep a little bit more, so that your body and your head start to understand that not only is there food here, but you don’t have to rely on other people to turn it into something edible. Now spread that butter around the pan, good, and chuck some of these in there.”
“Right in the middle of the board meeting,” he grinned. “I tipped the courier extra to ensure they’d be particularly obnoxious about knocking.” That small victory accomplished, Tony sat down on the edge of his desk. “Any reason you’re camped out here in the office of a lowly R&D staffer—”
You remain the best readers anyone could ask for. It's a highlight of my week to chat with you and share new chapters of this verse. Thank you!
Barnes was, as Phil had warned, shirtless and covered in marks. These couldn’t have been farther from the occasional wounds that were the souvenirs of training and missions, or the faded scars from Barnes' time as the Soldier. These marks had clearly been laid down with care. They spanned Barnes’ back from between his shoulder blades to just above his kidneys in a grid-like pattern that was almost perfectly spaced. (Of course, Clint’s unerring accuracy would be a boon in other situations than battle in this universe, Tony mused.) The skin underneath the raised welts was pink, and the whole area was glistening with the remains of some kind oil or cream. Barnes himself was more relaxed than Tony had dreamed The Winter Soldier was even capable of, grinning almost dopily to himself as Clint gathered up a plate of food for them to share.
) spankings Rhodey had handed out to get Tony through the past few days, he hadn’t been present for a punishment any version of Tony was taking since they’d been in their early twenties. As he sat at the end of the spanking bench, holding his friend’s (his sub’s) hands, it felt both intensely right, as if no time had passed at all, and like he was intruding somewhere he  might not belong. Things had never been openly antagonistic with the team when the other Tony had been alive, but they’d made it clear mainly through actions that they didn’t feel they really needed James, that they felt they had Tony handled. Since Tony hadn’t seemed to disagree with them as far as Rhodey could tell, he’d done his best to respect the distance that had settled itself between them. But he’d seen Tony’s relationships burn bright and flare out before, and Rhodey had never been fully able to commit to any contract that didn’t involve at least the potential for Tony’s sudden re-entry into his life.
“I mean yeah, that was the thought. But now that I’m in it, it feels kind of weird to think about having spent all night with you and then turning around and trying to be intimate and vulnerable with someone else. So I was hoping we could…re-negotiate, or whatever it is you healthy grown-up people say around here.” Clint’s frown deepened if anything, and Tony wondered whether using the suit to bore his way through the floor would count as breaking his promise not to be Iron Man in this dimension. “Look, it’s fine if you’re not interested—”
Even upon first waking, most of Steve’s focus was devoted to trying to find a plausible reason to call the Tower. He could try to lie, claim that Tony had asked him to check in in the morning, but if the other man remembered enough of the previous evening to know Steve was lying that could go sideways in a hurry. If he contacted JARVIS he could at least reassure himself of Tony’s immediate physical well-being, but again, the potential for blowback on that front was high, and JARVIS had already taken a risk by contacting Steve the previous evening. They couldn’t risk undermining Tony’s relationship with the AI when his ties to the rest of the team were so tenuous. And if Steve were being really honest with himself, it wasn’t just Tony’s pulse or other baseline health indicators he was interested in. The man had sounded broken and angry and so very, very tired last night; in lieu of actually being allowed to fix any of it, Steve’s every instinct screamed out for the right to at least assure this version of the man he loved that he’d been heard. That however complicated and painful Steve’s feelings about all of this were, he cared.
“Well, I filtered out some of the other stuff—things about whether or not I can suck you again, because that just seems needy, and a question about whether or not people in this universe get married, and this weird request that I can’t even believe crossed my mind about you maybe picking out my clothes for today, because I swore up and down to Rhodey that that did nothing for me but it turns out kind of did. And thinking about clothes got me thinking about the plan for the day and then I remembered Sam was coming.”
The Parker family (plus Tony) have a long-awaited conversation. Tony and Bucky observe an anniversary together.
“I wish. Tony’s kept to himself so much where Peter is concerned, especially after I had to say no the one time he did ask me for something. I don’t want to stick my nose in. But we’re also responsible for ensuring Tony doesn’t undo all the progress he’d made with caring for himself, and technically Peter’s still a person of interest to SHIELD as well…God, what a mess.”
“Jay, pull up any footage we can access of the battle. And put the comms on over the speakers, input only.”
Tony wouldn’t have counted her among that bunch anyway, though she definitely still took every opportunity she could to throw a curveball or two his way. Her last piece had been a thorough and thoughtful dissection of SI’s labour policies, and had ultimately argued that anyone employed by a business owned by an active Avenger deserved hazard pay. Pepper, it turned out, had agreed, and implemented the changes several weeks after the article came out. The two women had even had a one-on-one sit down which he was pretty sure had gone well. (He should really catch up with Pepper sometime soon…)
It was not so very far at all from where he and Tony may have gotten, if they’d had just a little more time.
I’ve always been struck by the parallels between Tony and Alexander: their intense commitment to their work, the way the brilliance of their minds makes them by turns brutal and soft, the way they love deeply and obsessively, their care for their children…it’s not a perfect mirroring relationship of course, but since I so often ended up thinking about Tony when I listened to the soundtrack, it felt like something worth exploring.
Tony struggles to keep his distance from Peter, while Steve struggles to keep his distance from Tony.
“I know.” Pepper and Rhodey were two of the only people who knew that short, declarative statements were one of the only ways to cut through Tony’s rants when he really got going. He was so paranoid in the wake of the imminent threat of exposure that for a moment he wondered if Everhart had been spying somehow. Maybe she had sources closer to him than he even realized? (He’d conduct a hardline sweep of the Tower and every other building he had so much as stepped foot in the second she left.) “I just…I can only give you a couple hours head start, but I thought if there were people in your life who don’t know and who you would prefer hear it directly from you, I could at least give you the chance to tell them yourself. I really am sorry, Tony.”
It was almost a relief when Steve was called in to SHIELD HQ that day, despite his having attempted to secure the day off. (The organization was still in shambles, and with such a limited number of people possessing high level clearance, sometimes Steve just didn’t have a choice.) Tony spent much of the day in the shop, ignoring the team’s invites for lunch and blocking the attempts that both Natasha and Coulson made to enter his space. (That would teach them to ruin Tony’s pancakes! And besides, he might have to embrace his submissive instincts on occasion, but that didn’t mean he needed the team checking up on him and hovering like this just because Steve wasn’t there.)
To say it was rare for an un-enhanced person to be able to sneak up on Peter these days would be wildly understating things. He nearly jumped out of his skin, then spent close to a minute looking between the girl leaning laconically against a locker in front of him, and the door that served as the only connection between the library and the rest of the school. There was no way she had beat him to that door, yet there was no other explanation for how she could have been cooly awaiting his arrival.
Your comments and kudos are the most delightful motivation. I am loving hearing everyone's theories, speculation, and questions. Please keep them coming!
“Hope it’s not botherin’ you, that I’m touching you like this,” Bucky said at one point. Steve had fallen asleep and was snoring softly from behind them, and Bucky looked to be winding down too, his head resting on Tony’s shoulder. “Submissives often really enjoy being in close proximity with other subs, and I’m kinda on the extreme side as far as that goes. Even in the 40s I was forever crawlin’ into somebody’s lap or fallin’ asleep just like I am now. Sometimes it was the only way I
be sexual, but for subs it’s more than that. It activates a deep and profound desire to please others which, when achieved, brings about satisfaction that most subs describe as deeper and more meaningful than orgasm. There’s also a secondary stimulation of the amygdala, which is why submissives in or near subspace tend to be emotionally raw.”
