“Oh no,” he breathed. “No, no…” With a very human sinking feeling, he knew immediately what it was—the Empty had come.
A tear leaks down Dean's cheek, and Cas swipes it away with his thumb. "Thanks Cas." Dean breathes out, pressing their foreheads together and closing his eyes. "Thank you."
Cas moaned, feeling Dean clench around him, and after a few more thrusts, Dean could feel Cas let go, filling him.
That sends a sharp pain through Cas' chest again. "Don't. Don't do that. You're the one who broke this."
It's nothing like Dean's touch, the one time Cas laid his hand over his, or the few times they'd grazed against each other while working at the shop. Those touches sent something through him, a shiver, a thrill, a surge of
He backed Cas up until they were against the bed, and gently laid him down. Cas scooted up so his head was on the pillows, and Dean climbed in, hovering over him.
Once they've caught their breath, Dean is gently kissing him all over his face, his cheeks, eyes, nose, forehead, lips, and Cas smiles contentedly. "God I missed you" Dean whispers, and Cas just snuggles in closer, happy.
Dean downed his last drink, and nodded. Standing up, he threw enough money down on the bar for the drinks they'd both consumed, then he turned and looked at her. "I'm sorry."
"Uh, I was thinking, maybe you might want to sleep in my bed tonight? I mean, just to sleep." Dean says, holding tighter. "I just really like being close to you."
He couldn't hold it back anymore. Dean let himself go, feeling his orgasm rip through his body, shuddering and moaning Cas' name.
It's been three days since Dean left, and the pain hasn't gotten any better. He's barely left the bed in Sam's guest room, only to use the bathroom, and even though Sam and Jess have both brought him food countless times, he's barely eaten. All he does is sleep, and even that doesn't make him feel any better since his dreams are filled with Cas.
"Yes. Is she ready to go?" Cas says, and he's doing a damn fine job of acting like he isn't nervous, but Dean knows better. Cas has the same tells he had way back when. Slight shifting on his feet, finger twitching by his side, eye contact avoidance.
"Dean" the way Cas says his name makes his blood run cold. "I- there was a dog- I don't know-" His voice is shaking and Dean can hear tears in it.
Dean closed his eyes, holding the soapy sponge in one hand and a dirty plate in the other. They stood like that for a few moments before Dean went back to washing the dishes.
"Than what, Cas? What the hell happened? Because I sure as fuck don't know, and I've spent a week trying to figure it out."
Cas orders a beer for both of them, which is already a step up from his drink earlier, because he's definitely a beer man. When the waiter sets them down in front of them, Cas watches as Dean takes a hesitant sip.
"Hmm?" Dean doesn't stop what he's doing with the coffee. He needs caffeine in his system as soon as possible. And for Cas to just go. He got what he wanted, so why is he still here?
Cas shook his head. "No, Dean, I-" but he was cut off by Anna leaning over and speaking into Dean's ear. Dean turned to her, and Cas inwardly groaned, downing the rest of his beer. He silently got up and went to the bar, ordering another, and one for Dean too. It was something they always did, whenever one got a drink, the other did too.
Silently, they made their way back to Dean's room. Glancing at the clock, Dean noted it was already 5 in the morning. "Might as well start the day" he said.
"But, that's not-" Cas starts, but Dean cuts him off because he just needs this to be over. It's too fucking early for this shit.
He misses Dean. Misses his laugh and his jokes and his warmth. Misses talking to him, and cuddling with him. He misses sex with him. This is the longest he's gone without it since they started, and he
Dean looked him up and down again, appreciating the effort Cas had put into this. "Yeah Cas. Thats... More than okay." Dean stepped toward him, placing his hand on Cas' waist, and leaned his head down slightly. He could feel himself growing a little hard. He wanted to say fuck their plans and throw Cas down on his bed.
Cas shrugged. "Didnt really want to watch TV anymore, so I came in here. Thought I'd make something hot to drink. There's more if you want some." He said, as he waved towards the coffee maker.
"I'm not really sure" Cas starts, stepping back into Dean's personal space. "What part of this made you think I only wanted sex. I really do have to work, and I didn't want to make you leave this early in the morning to take me back there. I was trying to be considerate."
feel better. He took a few deep, slow breaths, and tried to forget about the goosebumps on his skin in the chill of the room, to forget about the dull headache in his left temple, and the throbbing in his jaw. He tried to concentrate on Cas, and how good it was to still have him close.
“I know.” Castiel’s eyes sparkled, and Dean pulled back to see the corner of his mouth quirking up in a little smile.
“Yeah, ok, so I was wrong that time. But I’m not wrong now. You’re afraid, and you’re letting it get the best of you.”
The angel sat up straighter. He needed to focus on the task at hand, and NOT on figuring out a way to encourage Dean to overcome his inhibitions. When Dean clearly longed to be physically and emotionally intimate with Castiel, why couldn’t they seem to make it happen? He was growing tired of waiting—wasn’t there something he could do to get past Dean’s fear of loving and losing? Of vulnerability? Given a chance, he knew he could please his friend in every way possible, and he so wanted to try. Before it was too late for them both.
“You need something pal?” Dean tried to sound amicable, but his gruff voice that got rougher everyday and with every hunt took over. Castiel’s eyes widened and he looked behind his own shoulder as if he couldn’t believe Dean was speaking to him. He pointed to himself as his expression said,
The first time Dean saw Castiel was on a solo hunt in ‘03. He was craving adrenaline that night, but more than that. He was craving the idea of being reckless, the feeling that nothing mattered and the feeling of punching and being punched. This resulted in a scrap with a werewolf that he
Cas reciprocated identically. Warmth and sweet sweat were shared between their bodies, the only covered skin being a thin layer of boxers.
“Business. It’s finished now, though,” Castiel didn’t want to push him away. He was trying so hard to behave like a human.
Tonight Dean was set to drive to Palo Alto to get Sam. He couldn’t stay like every bone in his body begged him to. He had to let Dean make the trip. It was the beginning of everything and the end of them.
“Oh shit,” Dean’s cheeks were rosy and crinkled with a smile as he grabbed the beer and set it on the nightstand, “Tomorrow’s breakfast.”
“In thirty seconds Sam’s house will be up in flames. You have to pull him out,” he brushed at Dean’s now horrified face with the pad of his thumb, feeling at warm, freckled skin that would soon change. Dean would be older the next time they met and not just in age. His soul would be tortured and tired.
One more kiss, a slow and loving one. One more time feeling Dean bite at his bottom lip, one more hand through Castiel’s hair. One more time staring into those green eyes of his, eyes that still have a scrap of faith left.
“I can. If you want.” Dean’s hand fell from the grip in his hair and slid down to lay flat across his cheek. Dean nodded his head as he moved to slot his lips into the angel’s.
He tangled his fingers in Castiel’s and began leading him towards the line of motel room doors and everything was right
“I kept my word. Didn’t go looking for you,” Dean propped himself up on his elbows, the gun finding its way back under his pillow; a sign of trust. His hair was beautifully haphazard and it was the most dressed down Cas had ever seen him, wearing only a soft-looking dark green shirt and his amulet, the rest of his body covered with sheets.
“Castiel. Hm, that’s a funny name,” he took another swig of whiskey, keeping his gaze low and through long eyelashes, a look that, to anyone who knew him, meant fondness and maybe a bit of lust too.
“I’ve never done that before,” Castiel admitted through increasingly steady breaths. Dean’s hand wandered over his waist feeling at his body’s strength and warm skin.
but this right here, this boy with little slits of light on his face from street lamps outside, shining perfectly on one green eye and on plush lips, this was different.
He was vibrant and smiling. Cas mimicked Dean’s attention to his neck, using more teeth than Dean did, which earned a buck in the hunter’s hips and a gasp.
“Mm,” he decided not to press any further, not wanting him to disappear, “Gonna watch over me while I sleep?” Dean’s hand lightly gripped at Cas’ hair.
There was a drive in Castiel that hungered for the man beneath him, one that was unfamiliar and foriegn. He’d never felt it in heaven, or the few times he’d been on Earth.
“Still,” Castiel commanded, soft and understanding, as he pressed his hands onto his waist, the white hot power stringing together Dean’s skin again. Dean bit down hard on his lip, grunting and damn near screaming.
“What is it? You okay, Cas?” he held the angel’s hand within his own, bubbling with concern and what Cas could’ve sworn was affection. He kissed Dean's knuckles, perpetually red and sore.
“Of course, just be careful man,” Dean’s smile was contagious. He passed it back, keeping his other hand steady between Cas’ shoulder blades.
Dean moved on top of Castiel, their hip bones fitting perfectly together. He dominated the angel, grabbing his wrists and lovingly putting them to either side of his head, pinning him down and knowing that if the angel wanted to, he could be turned to dust in a second.
Cas put a hand to his forehead and scrubbed his dreams clean. He underestimated the hunter’s reflexes though, and found a gun pointed between his eyes.
“Are you back to make me forget? Like you said?” Dean leaned in close, letting a hand fall to Castiel’s thigh.
Once they're at the bus stop, they set it down to wait. "So, here's what I'm thinking." Dean says, because he has a plan. "We get this loaded, and you ride with it. I'll go grab the car, park it at your place, and meet you at the stop by your house, that way we won't have to come back for it. I should be there before the bus gets there, and we can get it loaded off and carry it back to your house."
They turned toward the Dean-Cave, as Dean called it, and his friend laid a hand on his back momentarily, a gentle gesture that felt like a small gift. They shared a side-eye glance.
“Nothing Dean—I want nothing from you. I just want to help. I know you have needs and desires and I…”
“It’s really cold in here, Dean,” Captain Obvious pointed out. “We need to run the heater.” Sam craned his neck to look out the rear window. “Wind’s blowing right up our ass, and it looks like we’re drifted in. I’ll go clean off.”
“Ok, so, what’s the plan, guys?” Sam butted in. “We’ve got at least one sleeping bag in the trunk, a couple of space blankets…” he reached under the seat to rummage a moment, “feels like two bottles of water… and I’ve got a box of granola bars in the back. Dean, you’ve got what—half a sandwich here?”
“Except I’m down for the count right now. Can’t bounce back like I used to, but we can try… hey…” Cas had wrapped a hand around his dick, fingers tingling icy-hot, and suddenly he was back in business with another stiffy. “Wow, you should bottle that.”
“Perhaps all this individual masturbation is unnecessary,” he suggested gently. “You and I… while our bodies are still young enough, perhaps you and I could find some release and contentment together. I would certainly be willing to try. More than willing.”
“What?” Dean’s eyebrows buried themselves in his hairline. “You mean you already came? In your pants?”
Dean’s breathing increased, his eyes finally lifting to Castiel’s. Cas felt he could lose himself there, in their green depths. But he didn’t stop talking.
Dean knew his train of thought was selfish, but fuck, he was tired of losing people he loved, and fighting the same battles over and over. He’d been through a lot. Maybe that entitled him to be a big fat baby sometimes.
Sam looked up and smirked. Then he stood and stretched, nearly touching the ceiling. “Gonna go get a snack,” he announced. “Cas, come join me.”
“Never mind.” He waved his hand, took a shaky swig of his beer, then leaned forward, an elbow on his knee. “And never mind what you saw on my laptop. That’s some weird shit—it’s not real.”
Sam turned and strode back to them, a grin splitting his face. Dean bent over to struggle with his boot laces, and looked up just in time to see his brother drop trou, then stand up straight again, buck naked. “Watch and learn, young Jedi,” he said to Jack, then spun and raced back down the dock, feet pounding, white ass shining, and flung himself into the air with a rebel yell. He cannonballed into the water like a giant fucking meteorite from outer space
Dean snorted a little, smiling to himself. “Not sure I’m ready to label this yet. How ‘bout…” He kicked a rock down the road. “… How ‘bout being two best buds who really dig each other and wanna maybe explore that and do what makes them both happy? Whenever they feel like it. And quit worrying about what anyone else thinks.”
Dean pulled Baby up in front of their ground-floor room. Cas hadn’t even moved while Sam registered at the office, which had Dean more than a little concerned. He slid out of the car and opened Castiel’s door a little too fast; his friend had been leaning against it, and nearly tumbled out into his arms.
perhaps complicated, but only because Dean was determined to make it that way. His brain was, in any case; his body and soul felt a different way entirely, that much was clear. This wasn’t bad. This was all very, very good.
Dean opened his lips around the smooth head and ran his tongue down the veined shaft as he took the whole damn thing, plunging his face into Cas’ lap, gulping greedily, reveling in the taste of warm skin, salty fluid, the brush of Cas’ coarse hair against his nose. Sucking hard he slid up, then down again, humming lustily, feeling Cas’ fingers slide over his scalp.
. The second time they’d watched the TV show, Castiel had observed out loud that he found Spock’s character admirable. “I like this Mr. Spock,” he’d said.
“Of course. But I’m afraid that when you come out of this altered state, you will remember this conversation with some regret. You won’t want to have sex with me, and you might not even want to
“Yeah. Yeah you are. I get the feeling you’ll be an even better one now.” Then Dean grinned. “You and your little mini-me. Spock and Baby Spock.”
Cas turned to look at him, eyes wide, then stepped down. He looked a bit surprised to find himself on solid ground. Dean grinned. “There, see? Nice, huh?”
They seemed to be driving right into the storm, snow falling thicker and faster. Drifts were beginning to form across the highway, the Impala plowing through each of them with a satisfying
“Your proximity is healing for me, Dean,” Castiel murmured. “Your soul’s energy… your body’s energy… are helping to stabilize my own.”
Dean grinned, happy to have pleased his friend. “Hold on now—gonna take my hands away and you’ll be doin’ it all yourself. If your legs start sinking, just kick a little.” He slowly pulled his hands back, like a magician,
“Dude, this ain’t our first rodeo,” Dean interrupted. “Don’t you remember that night outside Chicago after the vampire twins? Or that werewolf hunt with Dad in Montana? Stuck on some logging road in the snow for two days?”
Dean blinked. “Eat one…” Then he burst out laughing, realizing what Jack meant. It seemed to lift the gloom that had settled in the room. “No, man, you… you roll it on your dick for protection. You gotta leave a little space, and… hell, I think there’s a diagram in the box. You take one to your room and practice. Read the directions.”
Cas reached toward him and Dean flinched, but his friend was simply unfolding a space blanket to tuck around him. “This will help a bit,” the angel said, “but perhaps not enough.” He reached back to pluck up Sam’s wool hat, and snugged it down over Dean’s head. Despite being damp, it still felt warm.
for the way that the brave characters Spock and Kirk—different species from different planets—nevertheless shared love and trust and a bond that was unbreakable. And they always triumphed in the end, whether that meant saving one man or an entire universe.
“Not sure where I went wrong,” Sam said after a minute or two. “It says right here, the old burying ground was supposed to be on the southwest side of the intersection, about a hundred yards from the road. But we sure as hell didn’t find it.”
Castiel thought about how Dean’s soul opened to him in Hell, releasing all, trusting completely, and he smiled. “You can to me, Dean.”
Dean struggled backward, feeling Cas catch his arm before he could fall over into a drift. He righted himself and squinted at the angel; Cas’ hair and back were plastered with snow, his thin trench coat whipping around him in the wind. No hat or gloves. Dean hoped his half-assed grace was sufficient to prevent frostbite.
Dean yanked the bathroom door open again, looking even more mightily provoked. “It’s on my balls,” he said tightly, “And it’s dug in. One of you clowns needs to help me.”
“Yes, it… it’s fine.” Cas took a slow step toward him, then another, let his bare arms float to the surface, looking down at the water beading on his skin.
Dean stood up, turning, and shoved his hands in his pockets. Conversation over. “You know what I mean,” he said darkly. “Just keep it in your pants.”
Dean turned his eyes to the TV in the corner, where an attractive CNN reporter delivered the day’s bad news. Castiel leaned back on the counter and watched him, admiring, as always, the aura of his soul as well as the curve of his lower lip, the delicate shell of his ear, the strong cords of his arched neck. For several days now, there was something he had been yearning to ask… Perhaps it was his turn now for a difficult question.
. Set alight, it suddenly became a flaming tornado, scorching him from within, and he cried out sharply, startling Dean from sleep.
“Listen, I… I know you’re my best friend and maybe this isn’t a great idea—Chuck knows it’s not a great idea—but sometimes I look at you and you’re standing so close to me and I just… I just wanna drag you off to the nearest horizontal surface and get freaky. I just… you do something to me, man. I feel all kinds of ways with you…”
There was silence again, and Castiel winced. “Now you’re getting creepy on me, man,” Dean finally said.
He should have paid more attention to the forecast—that much was clear. He kept waiting for Sam to say something; he could virtually feel an “I told you so” coming on. Sam had first suggested they bail off the highway in Kearney. Then again when that rig they were tailing took the last exit about ten miles back. Dean risked a glance over at his brother, but Sam was now staring out the window, thin-lipped.
Dean sighed, climbing off his lap and rearranging himself on the seat. With a few contortions, he was able to curl around the steering wheel and lie on his side, with his head on the angel’s thigh and his bent knees against the door. It occurred to him that he couldn’t monitor the windows or the mirrors anymore for an approaching plow, however.
“I’m guessin’ there were never any twins,” Dean growled flatly. But then his tone became soft, almost pleading. “What is it you want from me, Cas?”
Castiel’s fingers ghosted softly over the top of Dean’s, and Dean could feel the angel’s body beginning to relax in his arms.
Castiel pictured the lunchmeat that Sam refused to eat, but that Dean liked in a sandwich with potato chips inside. “I’m not following you,” he butted in.
“You don’t need any equipment, buddy. Just go have fun. Make sure you pay attention to both of ‘em—that’s key. You’re gonna have four tits and two clits to work on, and that’ll keep you plenty busy.”
Sam ignored him. Dean couldn’t really see his face in the dim interior of the car, pinned to the seat behind Cas, but he could hear the bliss in his voice.
Voices were coming up the path, and then feet scuffled on the porch. Someone tried the door. “Dean? Cas? You guys in there?”
“No, of course not. I have no need to.” Cas was surprised at how smoothly the half-truth slipped out.
Cas writhed beneath him as Dean kissed his mouth, his neck, his chest, feeling Castiel’s hands on him as he dipped lower, sliding down between the angel’s legs, glorying in skin on warm skin.
“Wait a minute, Dean… hold on…” Sam held a hand out to stay him, gaze toward the water, and Dean recognized the thousand-yard-stare that meant a big idea was incipient.
“I could fuck you,” Cas suggested casually. “I’m sure you’d enjoy my penis inside you more than you enjoyed the Cartwright twins’ dildo.”
A memory came back to him, unbidden, of seeing Sam do the same thing on a public bus. He was probably six years old, which meant Dean was 10—and had barely figured out his
“Cas, didn’t you say Jack showed you paradise?” Sam asked. “Peace on Earth? What do you think that meant? Was it the… the post-Michael vs. Lucifer smackdown paradise all over again, or something else? And Jack has so much raw power—could
So here it was, he realized—the hidden gift. Only hours earlier, he had wished again that he could experience Dean with human senses. His wish was granted! Perhaps he could no longer heal his friends with his grace, or smite their enemies with one hand—but that hardly mattered in a fight against
Castiel hefted the basket of dirty clothes out of the Impala’s back seat and turned to see Dean waiting for him, standing propped against the laundromat door with his own load. The angel hip-checked the car door closed and stepped up on the curb to follow Dean inside.
Walking the mile back to the car in his sweaty clothes, Sam and Jack strolling in front of him and Cas bringing up the rear, Dean had some time to think. What was he going to do now? It seemed this was a turning point in his relationship with Cas. Was he going to try to deny this happened and reel his feelings back in—and possibly hurt Castiel’s? Was he going to jump in with both feet, and drag Cas into his bed at the bunker tomorrow night? Or was he going to relax and see where this went next, and just take it day by day?
“Yeah, but there’s still… still nothing you can do to control it, you know?” Dean squeezed his shoulders gently. “So maybe just stop fighting it.”
“OK, so here’s the plan,” Dean growled. “Sam, you go to the front door and ring the bell. They won’t be expecting that. Cas and I will kick in the back…”
“While I appreciate you trying to spare me regret, Dean, I do have a mission. It’s important that I do all I can to fulfill it, and that means protecting Jack.”
Dean’s lips parted, and he just stood there blinking at Cas for a moment, his pillow clutched in front of him. Castiel began to wonder if he’d crossed a line—but no, Dean’s pupils had dilated, and his expression was one of… curiosity.
Cas made a skeptical noise, smiling wanly. He dropped his hand from Dean’s face and patted the seat beside him. “Rest now, Dean. Lay your head on my lap if you like.”
Castiel wasn’t surprised that Dean had a tick on him; the surprise was that there was only one. After two hours of bushwhacking in the dark through long grass and shrubs and startling several deer from their beds, they had arrived back at the Impala covered in seeds and insects. After shining a light on himself, Sam had been sufficiently disturbed as to change clothes there in the field. Dean, however, had brushed off as best he could and said he just wanted a burger and NOW.
Cas lowered his hand, and Dean could see that the Impala had sunk a couple feet below the surrounding snowbank.
!” Dean yelled back. A second later the door opened and Dean stepped into the room, hair dripping and a towel around his waist. Steam rolled out behind him. “I have a tick,” he declared.
“Mmm,” Dean hummed, and Castiel could picture his pursed lips, his steely, calculating look off into the far distance. Dean was determining how much to tell him. “So where’re you picturing yourself in the sandwich?” he finally asked, returning a question with a question. “Are you feeling like a slice of bread, or the bologna in the middle? I mean, I guess there are many ways to be the bologna, but…”
“Alright then,” Castiel answered, unfolding himself from the end of the bed and standing up. He bent over the boy, fussing a bit with the blanket, not wanting to leave yet. Not quite ready to let Jack out of his sight.
“It was wrong of me to take advantage, and I’m sorry,” the angel repeated. “I hope you can forgive me.” Then he slowly resumed dressing, which was the last thing Dean wanted right now.
and Castiel stayed floating before him. Still smiling, Cas closed his eyes. Dean suddenly missed the feel of his skin, the connection. He was surprised at how badly he wanted to touch the angel again. But he didn’t dare disturb him—he seemed to be having a moment.
“Nothin’ I couldn’t handle.” He chuckled at himself, took a swipe at his sticky cheek. “Tell me why we didn’t do this a long time ago.”
Up on his knees, awkwardly bent over Castiel’s head and staring at his snoring brother in the back seat, Dean came quickly undone. Cas was jerking him with one hand, clasping his ass cheek with the other, and he knew he should worry about Sam waking up—he couldn’t stop whimpering, and the wet sound of Castiel’s hand milking him seemed obscenely loud—but he really couldn’t give a shit.
Once that was done, he stood in front of his closet just staring at his clothes for a good fifteen minutes. It was another twenty before he decided on what to wear, calling himself stupid for acting like this. It was drinks with friends, that was it. Nothing more. He couldn't help it though, he wanted to look good, even though, at this point in their friendship, Dean had probably seen him in everything from a suit to just his boxers.
Cas slides both his hands down, down to Dean's thighs, then grasps them, pulling up until Dean's legs wrap around his waist. Dean moans again, and Cas can feel his fingernails digging into his shoulders. He holds Dean tighter, and walks them out of the kitchen, through the livingroom and into his bedroom.
"Nothing." He looked at Cas. "I just wanted to see you. I knew you were fine from your text messages, but I was wondering what happened? But... I can talk to you later. You guys just go back to... talking?" Jack said, with a furrow to his brow as he backed out of the room.
After another minute, Dean pulled away. "I better get this popcorn going" he said, as he turned towards the counter.
Dean realizes he's staring and should probably be moving the bus about now, so he closes the door and pulls back into traffic. A while later, the man drags the fern off the bus at his usual stop, and Dean watches as he starts to pull it down the sidewalk.
"It's fine. I'm sorry I snapped at you, it's just a touchy subject." He can see she has more to say, but is holding herself back. "Fine, one more question. And only because his daughter is your friend, and I don't want this to affect either of you."
Dean is lost in these thoughts when he hears a wail from behind him. His head snaps up to look in the mirror, and sees a woman with a protruding stomach doubled over clutching at it.
Cas effortlessly leaned back for a moment and slid his bottoms off, kicking them off the bed, and settling back over Dean.
Cas moved as close as he could to Dean, his body pressed into the Impala and begging to go further. He grabbed at the bottom of Dean’s leather jacket and tugged. He grinned at Cas’ urgency, putting his index finger over the angel’s lips to pause him as he took one last drag of his cigarette and snuffed it.
“Dean.” Dean’s attention diverted just long enough for Castiel to get the jump on him and become the one on top.
“I’m- uhm, Castiel,” he accepted Dean’s hand, not knowing he what he was meant to do with it, but liking the feeling of his rough, warm skin. Unfortunately, it was quickly pulled away from him and his palm went cold again.
“Damn right you’re not,” he pushed Castiel further into the side of the Impala, one arm over his neck and the other pressing the gun into Cas’ stomach.
“Coming?” Dean caught his eyes over his shoulder as he walked towards the door. Castiel scrambled to get out of his seat and follow him. Dean shivered a bit in the cold midnight air when the frozen metal of the Impala’s trunk chilled his thighs as he sat down.
“Ah,” Dean nodded with a smirk around the lip to his now empty glass. He stood up, took out his wallet and threw a few bills on the countertop. Castiel shifted in his seat, worried he did something wrong to warrant Dean’s leaving.
Dean shrugged, lighting it up with a cupped hand, “Not often. I like to when it’s cold out. Or if I need a pick-me up. It’s comforting, y’know?” Cas nodded, though he didn’t understand, he felt he never really could understand Dean, but still he clung to everything he said like he could learn from it. Like Dean was teaching him what it meant to be human.
Dean greeted him with gunshots and a knife to the chest, unable to believe in angel’s, even in what once was
It was intimate and quiet, a little piece of the Earth carved out just for them. Nothing else existed and nothing would interrupt like the last time they met. The only sounds were the occasional car passing by and their lips moving and fitting together.
“Easy tiger, you’re gonna hurt yourself,” Dean laughed and put a hand to Cas’ upper back, “You okay?” Cas’ face was scrunched as smoke seeped from his nose and mouth.
“Dean, I don’t have much time,” Cas watched the man jump at his sudden visitor, “You need to listen to me.”
he can’t be any good. Good doesn’t happen to Winchesters. But there was still that young and innocent spark in Dean’s green eyes that was begging him to consider the possibilities. A spark that would die in the coming years.
“Castiel,” Dean mumbled against Cas’ lips. It was like a prayer, hearing his name like that. It was gentle and soft and pleading. That was all it took for the angel to come undone.
He put two fingers up towards the men and they dropped immediately, slamming into the concrete. Dean turned towards him at whiplash speed.
didn’t think this of Dean, why would an angel? Cas saw the turmoil and self-hatred in him and he wished he could take it all away just as he did the nightmares.
“I wish I could tell you. I wish I didn’t have to let you get hurt and watch you suffer. You have to forget me now.”
He put a hand over Dean’s forehead and let his fingers slide into his hair, staying there for a moment before Dean forgot everything that happened that night and Castiel was gone.
That wasnt enough for Cas, so he reached up, putting his hand on the back of Dean's neck, and pulled him back in, crushing their lips together. Cas shoved his tongue into Dean's mouth, and Dean tasted burgers and grease and something sweet again.
"Whatever brotha, just don't scratch the seats." Benny says as they pull it down the aisle. The other people on the bus are staring at them, but like every other time, Cas doesn't even spare a look for them, concentrating only on what he's doing. Dean smiles around at them, and keeps moving.
Unable to sleep, Dean tosses and turns and thinks. He wants to tell Cas how he feels, but he's terrified of it not going how he wants. He wonders if there's any chance Cas feels the same for him.
"I'm all ears." Dean replies, but he doesn't stop walking until Cas places his hand on Dean's arm again.
Dean is freaking out. He'd said the words "their kid" and Cas hasn't spoken a word since. He'd gone almost stiff against Dean, and is now sitting straight up staring at the waiting room wall.
Dean tipped the glass back, downing the whole thing in one swallow "I want you, you idiot!" He all but shouted, slamming the glass onto the desk. "I want you. I have for a long time. I cant stop it and I cant suppress it anymore. I dont want to suppress it anymore!" And with that, Dean strode over to Cas and backed him into the door.
Dean's resolve to remain professional wavers more every time. He's intrigued, wants to know who this hot guy is and what he's doing with all these seemingly random items.
Cas wakes up optimistic. He's going to see Dean tonight, and that always puts him in a good mood, and that's the exact kind of mindset he needs to peruse craigslist for potential new projects.
They head out to a little Italian place downtown that Cas knows, taking Baby. Cas makes appreciative noises as he slides into her leather interior, and it makes Dean feel pleased that Cas likes his car.
Charlie should be over around 3, and the girls will all start arriving around 5. Dean will be making homemade pizzas and fries, and they'll have cake (not pie because Emma's a heathen and wants cake for her birthday) and build your own sundaes. He also has a cupboard full of snacks for their games and movies, and a present in the livingroom for Emma's room that he'll have her open after breakfast.
The back of Dean's legs hit the table and Cas picked him up and set him on top of it. Pulling back a little to look at Dean, Cas slid himself between his legs, until he was right up against him.
too soon, and Dean probably thinks it's too soon. Two, he's scared to know the answers to the questions he'd asked himself at the vet's office. Dean making a comment about children, their children, has stirred up some longing in Cas that he'd thought long buried.
"No, let me say this." Cas cuts him off, so Dean shuts up. "Even if I had gotten your message right away, you were still the one with her when it happened. You brought her here immediately, and you stayed with her when I'm sure she was scared. She's lucky to have you, too." Cas looks away then, but keeps talking. "I'm lucky you were there. And here, for me, when I couldn't pull it together."
As the music ended, Cas picked up each shot, downing them one after the other, until all four glasses were empty and upended on the bar, then he took a swig of the beer.
Putting the laptop away, he uses all his willpower not to go snooping through it. He's extremely curious about what Dean's life has been like, but he won't stoop to digging through his personal information without permission.
He's showered, dressed, and back downstairs when he checks his phone next to see no messages, and his stomach drops. It's already 2:30, and since Dean didn't give him an actual time he has no idea when he'd be coming.
Dean hesitated for a moment, looking into Cas' face. He took a few calming breaths, then continued down past Cas' hard member, to his legs. Dean squatted down, washing the rest of Cas, but pointedly avoiding his sensitive areas.
"She means you're joking with her, Cas" Dean said, smiling. He really loved how some phrases confused Cas still.
Cas grips Dean even harder and flips them over again. He pulls up to his hands and knees and angles himself just right then starts pounding into Dean's prostate with every thrust.
A while later, he feels Cas' hand gently resting on his back. He turns off the machine, and twists to look at him. "Let's go inside." Cas says, and Dean looks at the time realizing it's already way later than he thought it was. He sets his tools down and follows Cas inside and upstairs.
Dean turned the light off and climbed into bed. 'I'll talk to him tomorrow' he thought, closing his eyes. His last thought before he drifted off was of the look on Cas' face.
"It's not just you," Cas says, turning his head to the side to talk into Dean's neck, wanting Dean to understand. "It's what you've shown me, what you've given me. You've made me feel like there are things to live for, things I never even thought of. And every time I feel bad, I just think about all the life in you, and all the things you love that you've shared with me, and it makes me feel better."
Shaking his head, Dean grabs the bag, zips it up, and slides past Cas back out to the living room. He can hear Cas following him, but he doesn't care. He can't care. It all hurts too much, and he needs out before the tears he's holding in escape.
Cas is sitting in a chair with his head in his hands when they walk in. They approach, and Dean says "Cas?" quietly.
"So, let me get this straight" Sam said, picking up his glass and downing the whole thing. "You made out with a woman, almost lost Cas over it, then decided it would be a good idea to get drunk, bring her back here, and tell her about our lives?"
"Cas, I dont want to talk about it. I just want 5 minutes to be happy about what we did." Dean said, half turning around to look at him.
Cas lowered his head again, and noticed for the first time that the front of his shirt was completely ripped open. "Umm Dean, what happened here?" He asked, with a smile.
Cas is sitting on the couch, staring up at him with wide eyes, and Dean has to push back the pain that shoots through his chest. He's here for a reason, and Cas being here isn't going to change that. Just grab the shit and go.
Once they're dry and dressed, they head downstairs and decide to order food instead of going out. Cas just wants to curl up on the couch with Dean for the rest of the evening, soak up this new feeling of love that's running through him.
Dean stopped in front of a car model. It was scaled down to about a 50th of the size, but it looked just like Baby.
"Because..." Dean didnt know what to say. Why had he done it? Had he been looking for an out? 'No. I want Cas. Tell him!' He yelled at himself.
There's noises behind Dean, and hes trying hard to keep his eyes on the road but also figure out what the fuck is happening back there by flicking his eyes quickly to the mirror.
They sit down to eat, and Claire gives him a look but promptly knocks it off as soon as she shovels a bite into her mouth. The soup is smooth and rich and warm, and there's what looks like homemade bread with it, and it's all so amazing and heartwarming.
After a moment, Dean's stomach growled. Cas stood back up straight and turned around. "You're hungry."
"Hah, yeah, no." Gordon says, finally looking up at him. "I'd like the actual manager." And he waves Cas away.
After a short bus ride, and an even shorter conversation, Cas is checking out the grandfather clock he's had his eye on since this morning. The wood is warped, the metal rusted, there are water stains in the bottom, it's altogether falling apart, and it is beautiful.
It didnt take long before the pain subsided and Dean began to enjoy it, wiggling around under Cas. Cas pushed his fingers around a bit more, before sliding them out, causing Dean to whine a bit at the loss of contact.
At a few minutes to nine, Cas pulls his old truck up to a two story white continental, with attached garage and walk up porch, complete with porch swing. Its the epitome of a suburban happy family house, and Cas feels a pang of longing for the stability this family must have.
"Her dad's gonna drop her off around nine, if that's okay. I guess he has some errands to run in the morning."
Cas didn't know how much longer he would last. The feeling Dean was giving him, his body pressed against him, his hard cock rubbing against his leg, and his hand wrapped around his cock moving at a quick pace, it was all too much.
a ride home? The guy could be a serial killer, and murder him. Or worse, he could end up with chicken shit all over baby's leather.
Following Dean to the door, he tries to pull himself together, but he can't. He loves those damn chickens, and it hurts that he didn't protect them well enough.
"I wont mess it up. At least, I hope I wont. I cant. I cant lose him again." Dean shoved the last piece of crust into his mouth.
"K, I'll be right back." Dean said, before walking away. Cas looked around at the group, saying hellos. He knew his greeting to Anna was stiff, but he couldn't help it. He didn't want to be friendly, but he'd at least try.
"Come on, dad. Don't embarrass me. I'm fourteen, and you can clearly see they have their shit together." She says, gesturing to the house.
They both stepped out of the shower, and Dean grabbed a towel off the hook next to them. He ran it slowly over Cas' body, removing all the water before dropping it to the floor.
Once they're on the porch, Dean turns to Cas. "Uh, thanks. For doing this." He says, gesturing to the bag slung over Cas' shoulder.
Dean let out another moan into Cas' mouth, as he felt their hard members rub together. "Fuck" he said, pulling his mouth away. Cas moved his mouth to Dean's neck, kissing and nibbling along it.
Cas doesn't know what to think of this. A small bubble of hope wells in his chest, but he pushes it down. This is just an excuse, an easy explainable cover for what really happened. He can't let himself be fooled into believing a lie, no matter how much he wants to.
"It is." Dean responds. "Except for the whole being the owner means doing all the paperwork thing. I hate it."
Dean makes a surprised noise, but then his arms are wrapping around Cas and they're lost in each other for a couple of minutes. When they pull apart, they're both breathless.
Coming down from his orgasm, Cas opens his eyes, forehead still pressed against Dean's. He's shaking from the intensity of it, and Dean's hands come up to his face, bringing him down into a sweet kiss he will never get tired of.
He felt Cas move above him and Dean opened his eyes to Cas smiling down at him. "That was okay?" Cas asked.
"Cas" Dean whispered. Cas could feel how close he was, and when he opened his eyes Dean's face was only a couple inches from his own.
Dean groans to himself as he deboards the bus and sees the same woman standing there from the other day. She tells him Naomi wants to see him in her office, and of course she fucking does because why not, after the worst day ever.
Dean looked down at himself. "I need a shower." He turned toward the hall and started walking. Then he stopped, and turned around to look at Cas. "You coming?" He asked.
Dean just shook his head. He thought about it for a minute, and felt panic seeping it. "I dont know!" He said passionately. "I dont know" calmer this time.
After taking a bite of the food, Dean swallows and shrugs. "I've gotta get the rest of my stuff. I forgot my laptop, so I'll have to grab that so I can apply at some of the places I've been looking at. Cas-" he has to swallow hard around that word. "He should be at work, so I'll just swing by, get my shit, and leave his key. Hopefully I'll only be here another week or two, if I can get one of those apartments."
"I already told you, I'm helping. Unless you actually dont want me to." Dean replies with conviction.
Shit. Shit shit shit. Of all the friends Claire could've made, it had to be Dean Winchester's daughter.
Once he was done, he turned around, looking into Cas' face. He saw something there, something that looked like worry.
A spark of annoyance but also worry goes through him. Either Dean's calling because of what he said before he left, or something happened.
"Why, Cas? Why does it matter? It was seventeen years ago. You've moved on, I've... it doesn't matter anymore." Dean says, shaking his head and turning back to him. It hurts, all of it. It's too hard and too much and he just can't do this. He should've never let himself back into Cas' life. All he does is ruin things, and Cas deserves better.
And it wasn't fair to Dean, because it's not like he knew that what he was doing hurt Cas. Dean was the kind of person that, if he'd known, he wouldn't have brought it around Cas. He would have kept his relationships away. But Cas knew that was wrong, and that Dean had a right to date and touch and kiss whoever he wanted. So, he just avoided the situation altogether.
"Theyll fit. Stop being a baby." She said, setting them down on his bed. She pulled her phone out of her pocket, and looked at it. "Its already 6. You need to get showered and dressed."
Dean pulled Cas' body flush against his own, kissing him passionately. As he kissed along Cas' face, to his jawline, he whispered "its my turn to make you feel good." He reached down and slowly started to unbutton Cas' shirt.
Dean shifted under Cas' intense stare. He was cocky on the outside, but inside he was actually pretty self conscious about his body. All of the scars from past battles with monsters, the extra little bit of fat around his middle, all things he didnt like about his body.
A little while later, Cas insists they leave to get some sleep because Claire needs to sleep anyway. Dean agrees, and Emma fights it until Claire is yawning, eyelids drooping, and she finally relents.
Dean slowly kissed Cas' neck again. "I know. Just, let me show you how sorry I am." Dean kissed his neck one more time and pulled back to look at him. "Please."
"You were different, Cas." The sadness overwhelms him, and he's not sure what to do to make Cas believe that.
Cas comes down slowly, collapsing onto Dean then rolling to the side next to him, pulling him against his chest. He presses kisses into Dean's sweaty hair, and can feel himself shaking with aftershocks, Dean clinging to him.
"Its been a few hours, Sam. I dont think that's sufficient time for him to realize what we're doing" Cas replied.
Dean doesn't know how it happens, but he's suddenly in front of Cas, his hand cupping Cas' cheek, leaning in and pressing their mouths together. He hears a choked sob escape Cas' throat, and then Cas is kissing back, clinging onto his shirt, and it's the most amazing thing he's ever felt in his life.
"Jesus Cas, no. Nothing is more important than you. And you're perfect just the way you are. Shit." Dean looks behind him for a second then turns back to Cas. "Can you put your shoes on and come out here for a minute? I'll explain why I cancelled."
"I'm sorry" Cas whispered. Dean could barely hear the words. Louder, Cas said "Dean. I love you. I love you so much." Then he kissed him.
Cas approaches, the island the only thing separating them. "I've spent so long mad at you, blaming you, trying to make myself hate you, and none of it was your fault." Cas knows his voice sounds awed, because he is. He's amazed that Dean never wanted to leave him, and ashamed that he ever believed Dean would, and guilty and sad and happy and every other emotion all crammed into one. It's overwhelming.
If Dean was being honest with himself, he really hadnt felt this refreshed in a very long time. His ass hurt a bit, but he expected that.
It hurts. He feels empty inside, and every time Cas does something for him, every time he even gets a glimpse of him inside the house, his heartrate ratchets up and he feel nauseous. Maybe there really is no way to fix this. Maybe Cas really doesn't want him anymore. If he did, he would've said something by now.
Dean can't help but watch it for a second before his eyes flick back up to Cas'. "It's really no problem. Barely out of my way at all." He says.
Cas is distressed now for a completely different reason, having an internal break down of sorts. Now is not the time for this, but he can't stop it.
"What's up bitche- oh!" Charlie says, and they pull apart and look at her, and she's grinning. "I see."
"Yeah, I know, thanks." Dean takes a breath, runs a hand down his face, and talks. "Do you remember a while back, it's been a long time now, I told you about Cas? From highschool?"
"Hmmmm. True. Not to ignore your opinion but I am gonna talk to Missouri about that too. See what she has to say."
"Hmmm. But you feel hot. Maybe it's a fever. You should stay in bed just in case." Dean whispers and kisses along Cas's shoulders.
Dean shrugs. "I am proud of myself. And you are right? That's enough for now. I can try for next week."
"Yes, Freckles? Did you forget about me drinking myself stupid over something I don't even remember anymore? Or how I walk away when I get uncomfortable? "
"Yes, you did. I'm sorry. But now that they're off my hips, maybe I can rush off to the bathroom?" He asks
Dean speaks up. "Guys.  Gabriel read my file, I told you what's in it. Angel, you said you'd understand why he reacted the way he did. Please be brothers again. "
He takes a deep breath. "I feel clingy and  and  I don't know…. not enough and too much and empty and busy but I can't get myself to move."
"How comfortable are you with nudity?  Cause I'd like to get her a drawing of me. Spicy. Very spicy. Like hung up in the bedroom only spicy. I'll model or, if it's easier for you, I'll model for photos you can work of off."
"Huh to each their own I guess. I don't know if I could be up for that. I think I am too possessive for that?"
Dean pushes down further until his face his touching the zipper. He runs his hands over Cas thighs. His own cock is straining in his pants.
"Maybe somewhere down the line... in a few years..." Dean stammers. "Transatlantic flying is scary. "
Dean is kissing down Castiel's neck and nipping on his earlobe. He runs his hands over cas back down to the edge of his pajama pants and back up.
What neither really thought through is the fact that they'd be naked together and after some awkward shuffling in the small bathroom they just giggle their way through the shower.
Please understand that once I realized two of my patients are seeing each other I have had to come up with a plan to keep both of you safe. "
"Maybe but you still have your own house to go to even if you don't. This is going too fast. You know he has had anger issues in the past. What if he changes in behavior? How will he react if you want to make his house yours and he doesn't like it? Baby brother.... I really don't like this."
He tries to keep up a rhythm but its easier to just let himself relax. He focuses on his hands and roams all over Cas' body. One hand kneading the ass. He can feel Castiel's muscles shift with every move. The other hand he runs across Cas' chest and plays with his nipple, twisting it a little bit and rolling it.
Cas snuggles him. Once Dean's class is about to start Cas puts on sweatpants and a t-shirt and goes on a long run, he returns for his shower then goes to work in his painting.
Dean tries to call back but Gabe doesn't answer. He types out a message to Castiel but changes his mind. He puts on his shoes and goes of running into the direction Cas most likely took to get out of his area.
"Dean! Please. You did not use me! I had offered this. I had wanted it that way. I loved it that way."
Cas opens his mouth and Dean pushes his cock in slowly and groans.  "God I love your mouth. Fuck babe."
[6.12., 20:06] Dean: Wellnits either this or refusing to entertain the idea complety and drown it in alcohol
Dean shakes his head and looks up at Castiel with big eyes. He gently runs his tongue around the head of Cas cock and sucks him until he can feel blood rushing in and it hardens in his mouth.
They grab everything else and Dean heads towards the register. "Angel. I am gonna pay for these and I don't want you to argue. You'll be in charge of keeping them alive."
[24.5., 16:32] Castiel: I don't know if I can do that. Manning a booth is one thing, but small talk at a bar with strangers?
"Yes. This is not a punishment babe. This is sexy and kinky and it's from you. And it ... I don't know babe it makes me feel like " Dean grabs Cas and kisses him.
"I've been trying to talk about it with you, but you ... you had other things to discuss with me. Which is fine too. Those things needed to be said as well."
Cas looks him deeply in the eyes before he gently takes his hand and licks the precum off his fingers.
Dean looks up, still brightly red. "No, no I am not. Babe, angel. I'll gladly and happily let you do things to me and I like you in charge. I ... if you don't want to 'order me around' can I ask that I get to let out my service side more often without you complaining? Please?"
Castiel’s sleep is uneasy. Despite having had a good day the day before his dreams are filled with a feeling of threat.
Dean cleans up downstairs and turns everything off for the night before he follows Castiel upstairs.
"I don't know. Probably in case I decide to go to church with them?" He shrugs. "I just grabbed shoes..."
Castiel looks through the menu and tells Dean what he wants before he excuses himself and heads to the bathroom.
Gabriel lifts the sheet that covers the entrance and turns to look at Cas as he comes running. He drops the sheet as he stands up. "What the fuck is wrong with you?"
Dean steps out with full plates. "Maybe. I need to meet the bees first. I don't have the best relationship with them yet." He smiles. "I am getting better with the ones showing up here for the flowers by the studio. "
When Dean wakes up he is alone in bed. He listens for the shower but can't hear anything so he walks down into the kitchen. He finds coffee prepared for him but can't find his boyfriend.
"I just want to laze around today. January first is always lazy day and this year I have you. I wouldn't mind just spending the rest of the day on the couch with you. Maybe do some more kissing?" Dean answers.
"Hey, no. No feeling bad. It happened and we are moving on right? Or did I miss understand something?" Dean pulls Cas closer.
Cas checks both their phones for their alarms then hands Dean his tea. "Drink first don't want you to dehydrate, Babe "
[26.1., 13:45] Dean: No. I emailed the professor about the situation. John isn't exactly a new topic so I am good
"I think this is how family is meant to feel. Not fear and disgust. "Dean says and holds Cas close. "I like this."
Dean nods in relief not having to figure out what to do. His brain is running on low. He smiles at Castiel and nods.
[28.1., 12:26] Castiel: But we don't have to work together. He can do his mechanics stuff while I'm there.
"I don't know.  I'm asking.  I feel like that's a topic where we have different feelings about and ... I don't know.  I think I'd like to test out that area but..  I don't know. "
"No you didn't." Dean gasps and pushes Castiel over on his back. He climbs on top of him and starts tickling him.
"Oh? We should all go swimming together so I get an excuse to look at his legs. Or sauna. Garth and I know a great place."
The chair creaks again and Dean sighs. He puts his head on Cas's shoulder.  "We should stop before we won't and then Zeke is here..."
"Yeah. He's different. It feels different. I am falling hard here Charlie. Really hard. Like white picket fence hard."
Dean sits on the bathroom rug with his back to the door. "Castiel, I am not a quiet guy when it comes to sex. But... I never ... nobody ever needed to stop and check if I am OK because of it. I am embarrassed. Please let me get over this by taking a shower."
"I am sorry. Come pick me up and force me home at 8pm? At the latest? I'll forget time and I think you making me go home will help for sure."
"I didn't know what to say. If I had said something, it might have come out wrong and then you would've broken up with me and I would have been dead inside and ...."
Dean puts his forehead on the wall and let's the water beat on to his back. "I think I said sinful."
"It's ok. I.... uhm. .. don't worry about it." Dean stammers and blushes . His hands running up and down Cas' back.
Dean sits up and lays down immediately. "Give me a minute to get up."He laughs. "And can you save my panties from last night?"
They move back inside shortly after one in the afternoon and marathon Dr Sexy. Dean tells Cas all about the drama and he rolls his eyes at him but watches anyway. At least with one eye. He is snuggled to Dean, soaking up as much cuddle time as possible.
The picture Castiel sends to establish who Sam is talking to. https://whatsappfic.tumblr.com/post/636547141644451840
[26.12., 23:40] Castiel: Wanna get off the couch and into bed? Don't think my back will survive another night on the couch
"Oh shit. Just like that! Yes!" Dean moans. "Fuck angel, I am gonna..." he groans and comes in Cas mouth, letting Castiel suck him through it.
Gabriel says as he walks into the kitchen. "Ohhh cookies. Wow this all looks amazing. That must have taken all day. Thank you guys."
"And my last one. Uhm. Despite his past, finding out about my anger problems or my past in general didn't scare him away. He doesn't judge that Dean. He's happy to have me now as I am."
Dean's toes are curled into the carpet in front of the couch and little beads of sweat are shining on his face. His left hand is grabbing the couch next to him in a vice grip and his phone is about to topple onto the floor. Deans right is still wrapped around his cock loosely, his fingers are wet and sticky with the precum he is leaking.
Dean sits down on the couch and holds his arms out for Cas to hug him. "Promise to tell me to back off if you don't want to?"
"I swear this was not my intention when I said I want to make out, but I am not mad about it. How are you feeling Babe."
Dean shakes his head. "I showered while you painted. I am just here for the show and skin and to give you company like I offered." He grins.
The dog keeps pulling Dean and for her little size she can be pretty strong. He trips over himself and falls flat on his face.
"I.. I think if you keep going. " Dean moans. "I can feel it. I feel like I'm." He keeps moving his hips " stay right there."
"See. One cup in and you look almost awake enough to deal with the day. " Dean laughs. "I fed the pets and let tana out already."
"Thank you." Dean raises himself up on his knees and kisses Cas belly button before he leaves small marks scattered across his stomach. He runs his hands over Cas body and always comes back to the stockings, rubbing Cas legs over the fabric and playing with the elastic.
[1.4., 7:31] Castiel: as much as I missed you, I enjoyed  only texting again, i particularly enjoyed the sexting
"Dean, I am close." He says low. "If you want to speed it up, press harder and in." He whispers. "Finger me, good boy."
Castiel deeply enjoys the fun he has with Dean. Comparing Dean and the kind of relationship they have, he can't even remember what had him fall in love with his exes.
Dean finishes his coffee and checks the time. He can hear Sam in his room getting ready for school and he makes the decision to be late for his class so he can talk to his brother before he leaves.
in front of him was so torn, trying so hard to believe in anything good. Castiel stopped him from having to take down three men, isn’t fighting Dean’s hold on him though he surely could, hasn’t tried to hurt Dean all night but
“It’s efficient.” Dean pulled him down into a slower, explorative kiss. They were both trying to memorize the feeling of each other’s lips. To taste and lick all they could because they both knew this night would be fleeting.
“So what are you doin’ here, Cas? You don’t seem like the type,” Dean’s eyes were roaming all over him, trying to portray as much
His lips pressed to Dean’s and he woke up the next morning on his motel bed, recalling a strange but enticing man and trying to decide if it was all a vivid dream.
“Cas, shit it’s good to see you,” Dean pulled him into a firm hug, the angel resting his head on the hunter’s shoulder and arms around his waist.
Dean fell asleep wrapped around Castiel. He stayed there for two hours, watching the rise and fall of Dean’s chest, watching his body relax every time and everywhere he touched him. He knew he couldn’t be there when Dean woke up, and he knew Dean only slept for a few hours at a time.
“Think you can zap me a beer?” Cas smirked and put his arm around Dean’s shoulder, kissed his cheek, then pulled back with a beer in hand.
He was still wrestling with that deep seeded hunter instinct, the one that told him to get as far away from Castiel as possible. But he was tired, so tired of being on edge and suspicious of everything. Sam was in college and Dad was wherever, he didn’t have to protect anyone anymore. He didn’t have to fight so hard. Because who needed him?
“It’s okay, get back!” Dean sprung into action and began landing punches and kicks, and Cas stood helpless for a few seconds before he knew that it was time to say goodbye.
“Stay,” Dean lifted up the sheet as an invitation, eyeing at Cas’ trenchcoat for him to take it off. His layers were gone before Dean’s eyes, reappearing folded neatly on the motel table, along with a pair of shoes lined up at the door.
