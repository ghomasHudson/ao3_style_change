“I’m sorry. Sam and I are desperate for this spell to work, and it’s been a rough ride to get here.”
“Sam!” he yelled, banging on the door. “Let us out.” He didn’t bother yelling Eileen’s name, but knew she was still next to his brother, probably laughing quietly with him.
“Still,” Dean pressed. Screw him, he was curious.
“I’ll eat while we talk.” It would give him something to do with his hands.
Chuck shoots him a dirty look. “My references are art. And don’t judge, half of them are also yours.”
“Did an angel send you?”
Not one to stay down for long, Dean can see the crowd already starting to clear as his past self struggles to get up, and Dean makes quick for his car, hand still clutching the crowbar. He shoves it in the backseat and hunches down low, peering over the window as his past self drives off, careening out of the parking lot.
Was he really that transparent? Dean remembered a night years and years ago, Cas still dressed in hospital whites asking him for the plan. A wild feeling, one he had been unable to name, rose up inside of him, and all he knew was that he needed to look away before he said something to ruin the moment. Then it was the memory of giving back the cassette tape, and the mantra of
“Don’t be.”
“In my defense I didn’t think we’d be grabbing this much stuff.”
“You have to be fucking kidding me,” Dean says.  A mother pushing a stroller on the other side of the street gives him a dirty look, walking faster.
At some point his voice had escalated until he was nearly yelling, Cas taking it all in stone-faced. Dean’s had some version of his best friend back for less than an hour now and they were already falling into old routines.
Something in Dean squeezes at those words but he keeps himself calm. Chuck himself said that Cas was the one element he could never control, and he’ll have to trust that Cas will be able to keep that up, despite Dean’s interference. That in trying to save Cas he won’t be dooming him instead.
Dean clears his throat, his mouth thick. “Cas?” he guesses. The tentacle around his leg moves higher, almost affectionately. Something in the air around him shifts and Dean wrenches his gaze from the tentacle and looks up.
“I’ll go get a broom,” he announced.
When he gets to the door, the number brings him to a stop. If memory serves correctly, this means that Sam is just next door, waiting to take on Lilith by himself. Dean almost wants to barge in, consequences be damned, and tell him not to do it, to tell him that Ruby isn’t to be trusted.
Self check-out was one human skill Cas had yet to conquer. He’d helped waste Sodom and Gomorrah, stopped the apocalypse, and fought Chuck himself, but couldn’t quite seem to master the timing of sliding the little barcode across the scanner. Dean and he had worked out a system where Cas would bag as long as Dean would scan, although Dean had asked him not to tell Sam about it.
“Does this mean only one of us has to go twice,” Dean asked with a wry smile.
Panicking, Dean puts his hands in the air in front of him, palms out in the universal sign of don’t attack. “It’s alright, Cas. I’m not here for anything to do with the apocalypse, so no reason to report back. We can keep it a secret between us.”
His first thought was the exact same as last time. Cue running from Billie, a confession, and watching Cas die. It always came back to watching Cas die. And so Dean told him.
“Yes.” Cas’ voice was close, closer than he thought it would be. Dean sat straight up in his chair, and could hear the crunch of glass as Cas made his way over to him, although his face was still lost to the darkness. Stepping over the ring of glass the way one used to avoid cracks on the sidewalk, Cas kneeled down in front of Dean.
“You,” Cas said.
“Dean,” Cas said, furrowing his brow. “I don’t want to leave. Besides, you already know how to ask me to stay.”
“And I—I know you get scared sometimes when we find something new,” Dean continues. “Believe me, I do too. Chuck may have monologued about how you’re a beacon of Free Will but I know you, and I know you’ve made some choices you regret. But when I get to you, when I manage to break into the Empty and rescue you for once, I need you to let me.”
Getting locked in a room with Cas was not something Dean had ever thought about.
Cas smiled. “Well, you know what they say. ‘I’m your huckleberry.’” He didn’t put on the accent this time, just let the deep gravel of his voice resonate throughout the room. Dean swallowed hard.
The weight of Cas’ gaze on him was heavy, and so Dean cleared his throat and nodded his head towards the paper, signaling Cas to go on. With a hum, Cas acquiesced.
At the end of the road he could see a tunnel, the kind carved into mountainsides and barely wide enough to fit his car, let alone two. Dean snorted—he thought the light was supposed to be at the end of the tunnel, not the beginning. He sped through, hoping to maybe leave these trees behind, and nearly crashed the car at the way everything on the other side was dark.
There’s something hidden in Cas’ voice when he says, “I’m still in your life.”
“Aren’t you scared of breaking it?” Dean asked, trying to postpone the questions.
“Oh come on man, Arthurian legend? Excalibur? You should know.”
“And you protested when I grabbed a shopping cart,” Cas teased, taking some of the load off of Dean and depositing it in the cart in front of him. He stopped when he could see Dean’s face again, and watched as Dean leaned over the cart and simply opened his arms.
“Thanks for saying that Jack,” he chokes out.
Their eyes were locked as Cas moved forward an inch and blew the eyelash off of Dean’s finger. He was acutely aware of their positioning in the room; Dean, half bent over Cas and barely inches away, and Cas seated with his legs spread wide to accommodate Dean’s closeness. If they hadn’t been locked in a room together, this would be when Sam walked in with a “so get this” leaving them to awkwardly spring apart.
“Of course.” It comes out more tender than Dean intended.
“What do you say, Dean,” Chuck drawls. “Are we going to see where the story goes?”
Dean grimaces. “I know.”
Dean knew what his answer should be. Cas, standing in front of him, eyes filled with tears and practically glowing, telling him he loves him, that he’s always loved him. But every time Dean revisited his memory, he could never seem to end it while it was still sweet, and had to watch once again as the man he loved died.
“Blood from his—the angel’s,” Dean corrects, “Vessel and demon smoke. We already have the other two, but part of the page was destroyed in a fight. There’re instructions, but it’s useless without the full list of ingredients. We need to do this spell.”
“I thought you liked my music,” Dean said.
, he thinks, remembering what it was like to stand his own against Chuck. He may have fought for free will, for an ability to write his own script, but Dean’s words weren’t his own: they were Cas’, some of his last.
The wasp from earlier buzzed in and around them. Cas just stared at him with that piercing gaze, the one that made Dean feel more flayed open than he ever was in hell.
Dean lets go of it all and slowly, deliberately sinks to his knees.
“A life,” Dean said.
Dean can barely look at him.
he can breathe again.
From anyone else’s mouth, it would have been a low-blow, but this was Cas. He knew how to use sarcasm, even if he faltered sometimes, and this wasn’t it.
“I’m just giving you food,” Sam replied, voice muffled. “Rowena and I want you to talk, not starve.”
Dean spoke about growing up, forced to play brother, mother, father, teacher, and doctor to Sam, stretching himself into so many roles he didn’t quite know how to be just Dean. He discussed Sam leaving to college, how he was forced to hunt alone until his dad went missing, and the search to find him. The grief after he was gone, but also the desperate and wild relief he felt now that his dad was finally out of the picture. Dean told Cas about how it felt to hold his brother’s dead body in his arms that first time, what it was like to sell his soul, that final year, and he had just gotten to being dragged to hell when the alarm on Cas’ phone rang and Dean’s time was up. Fitting, his story ended just as he was reborn.
As if he had read his mind (and Dean had never quite been able to convince himself that angels weren’t mindreaders) Cas interrupted his thoughts.
“Well,” Cas said after a beat. “I don’t think I’d change anything either, but I’d hope those around me would.”
The grocery store was Cas’ favorite place to go now that he was human. Well, favorite place that wasn’t also a person. There was just something about all the fluorescent lights and the people quietly pushing along before returning to their own world. He knows that that food will be cooked, will be given to toddlers just starting to eat and to lovers having their own date night. In the grocery store he feels like an angel again, peering into all the bright souls.
Dean looked at his hands. It was times like these that he missed the rings he used to wear, just something to play with to distract him from reality. “Sometimes… Sometimes while working cases, ones that involve little kids, I’ll catch a glimpse of their pajamas and it’s like I’m a four again, staring up at my burning house. My dad threw away those clothes a month after the fire, claiming he could still smell the smoke. That’s when I started sleeping in jeans. I didn’t understand what he meant then; they just smelled like clothes to me. I get it now. I haven’t even washed that flannel yet, but I know if I did it would still smell like you.”
The song that had been playing, some Led Zeppelin track he’d listened to a thousand times over, fizzled out for a moment, before Robert Plant’s voice swayed back in. He frowned, reaching towards the dial to fiddle with it; even with Baby’s age, he’d never had problems with the radio.
Just like in the restaurant with the burger, Dean realizes his role. “Shit.”
“I saw that you and Cas were super close to each other. Why? Isn’t that normal for a couple?” Jack asked.
Once, Dean would deny the words, deflecting them to make it seem like it's the speaker’s fault for noticing. Cas had said that he learned humanity from Dean, so what did it mean that people kept noticing cracks on the surface when Dean had been the one to carve?
Dean shakes his head and takes his time finishing his burger, knowing they’re heading towards the Toreador Motel.
“How bright your soul is.”
“Why are you here?” he asks, brushing past Dean and into the living room. It’s as disgusting as he remembered it being 10 years ago, old Chinese take-out littering every available surface and empty bottle after bottle scattered about. Distantly, it reminds him of what his room looks like in every aftermath of Cas leaving him. Dean swallows the rising emotion down.
Laughter bubbles up inside Dean, sweet like nightshade. “No one could.”
A corner of Cas’ mouth lifted. “I’m sure there’s a more angelic term. Jedi mind-wipe, maybe? It’s correction, apparently I’ve always been a bit of a rebel.”
That isn’t to say he dislikes being a human. He knew that Dean removing his grace was the only way the Empty would have let them escape. Besides, he had nothing waiting for him in Heaven, the place that had only ever turned him into something he was not. Sometimes where you were from needs to remain where you were from, nothing more.
(Something about not wanting his brother to think he was a sap. Dean hadn’t argued his point well, but Cas enjoyed the way his blush spread across his face when he said it.)
“Nothing,” he lied. “There’s nothing more in my life I want.”
“Don’t you know, Chuck? I thought you wrote our lives?”
Cas nods solemnly. “Yes, the prophet. I’ve read all his work about you and your brother, though I’m sure you’ve now read ahead of me.”
Cas turned the paper around, and Dean could see the question fading. “I guess you can. Give it here, if you read it and then answer immediately, you’re not actually asking a question. I’ll finish this set.”
The handprint. It stares at him; bright red against the green background and Dean may have never taken an art class but he’d passed through enough towns with Christmas as the main event to know how the colors pop. A faint ache in his left shoulder, the arm he’s been using to hold the glass. If he closes his eyes he could trace the faint white lines of the handprint even now, 12 years after it was burned more than skin-deep.
“You have to. It’s the last in the set,” Cas replied, gently urging him on. His shoulders were tense, and he looked hesitant, much less open than he had been only moments before. Dean remembered what had happened last time he freaked out like this, and he forced himself to breathe.
“Next set,” Dean said, reaching towards the papers in the middle. Cas stopped him by grabbing his wrist, smoothing his thumb over the back of Dean’s hand.
Outside, a car honks, and there's the sounds of a family unloading for the night. The noises don’t quite reach into the room, like Dean is cocooned in here with Cas. There’s something wet on his neck and Dean touches it, curious, and it comes away bloody; rubbing his neck had reopened the wounds on his hand from dodging the car.
“Like Anna?” Dean asks. If his timeline is right then she’s been taken back to Heaven by now, but maybe once the grace falls its forever tainted. Or something. Anything.
“Ask the paper.”
He faintly recalled his time as God and how it had felt to destroy that preacher’s tongue. Cas hadn’t been at full power in a long time, but the people in front of him were triggering that old righteous fury that used to simmer within him. He opened his mouth, and—
A dull pain in Dean’s hand steals his attention. He glances down and sees his hand over Cas’ name, the
“Hey,” Dean yelled. “How come you’re suddenly able to open the door.”
“I know the spell you speak of,” Cas protests, still resisting. “You can’t just use any grace; you need that of a falling angel.”
“A place to call home.”
“I’d say mine is the same.”
The constant tugging in Dean stops, and he looks up. There, shining in front of him, is Cas’ grace. It’s hard for him to describe even to himself, his brain flicking through memory after memory to find something to compare it to, to let his eyes translate shapes into words.
“A couple?” Dean echoed. “We—you thought—“ Dean didn’t know how to finish any of that. He didn’t know what he and Cas counted as.
“No, Dean, you’re still only wearing one shoe. Stay there.” Cas walked off towards the hallway closet, seemingly not wanting to use his grace again.
It was a non-answer on both sides, but the question faded from the paper anyways.
Cas fixed him with a flat look, and turned the papers so they faced him. “The 36 Questions That Lead to Love,” he read in a bored voice, only betrayed by the pink tinge of his ears. Dean was sure he wasn’t in a better condition, face as flaming as it was.
“Stop the car.”
“Thank you for telling me this, Dean,” Cas said, voice thick with emotion.
A laugh bubbled out of Dean, coming from deep in his chest. Cas stared in amusement, a smile tugging at his lips.
of an old printer. Chuck gets up and crosses over towards it.
“It led you to 40 years in hell,” Cas said.
They had, until Cas had confessed that he’d been in love with Dean for the past 12 years while sacrificing his life for him, leaving Dean crying alone against a wall for hours. Cas had only just come back three days ago after Jack deposited him outside of the bunker, fresh out of the Empty and with his grace around his neck. Dean had been mid-research for a plan to pull Cas out, and with no grand moment of victory or swell of emotion—just Sam opening a door and a surprised shout—Dean didn’t know what to do, and so he did what he did best: he hid.
he warns himself—but the material looks hard like marble despite the way it’s curled fluidly around him.
Dean jerked his head up. Haloed by the sun, looking every bit like stained glass saints and saviors from above, was Cas staring down at him. Dean couldn’t quite make out his face, but he had long memorized every rhythm of that voice.
Well, it would have been peaceful if not for the protesters.
The meeting with Chuck left Dean jittery, like he said too much and got barely anything in return. Determined to bring himself back down to Earth, Dean heads straight towards the motel room’s bathroom, splashing cool water from the sink on his face. He shuts the water off and nearly jumps out of his skin when he turns around to see Cas behind him.
Silence again. Dean smiles, laughing high and loud.  “You were watching bees, weren’t you?” The tentacle around his ankle tightens and he quickly calms himself. “Hey, hey, it’s fine. I’m going.” The pressure disappears, as well as the presence in his head, and Dean is alone.
Dean grimaced. “I left it in the car.”
Glancing around, it’s not the description that Dean would choose—he’s been in enough graveyards and haunted houses to know the better ways to use ramshackle—but hey, he didn’t even consider himself a writer until he realized he wanted off the script. Decrepit, maybe. Pathetic. Words that reach past the house and sink into the owner itself. He doesn’t need any writing skill to know what he wants to do next.
Dean didn’t think the place was sentient, but he liked to imagine they had an agreement: don’t traumatize me more, and I won’t get too mad about being dead.
Cas said he couldn’t have what he wanted, but Chuck is dead and free will hangs high in the air like laughter. And Dean says so.
“I thought I couldn’t do that. I’m not built right.” Sometimes it feels like his ears are still ringing from their first interaction.
“May I?” Cas asked in reverence, like a man on his knees.
“Rowena,” Dean said to the paper, before Cas could open his mouth. “I don’t know how your magic works, and there seems to be a lot of loopholes in this, so I’m going to answer 33 and 36 by just saying it again and again”
“Cas, I love you.”
He fishes his phone out of his pocket and places it face-up on the table so the timer is staring at him. 9 hours 6 minutes and counting. He looks up at Cas to find that Cas is already staring at him.
“I don’t really call many people, so no. Maybe I should start? It could help with human rules,” Cas said.
Like placating a wild animal, Dean reaches out, palm open and face up, and cups the grace in his hand. There are 4 hours 1 minute left on the timer when Dean finally gets what he wants.
Dean quickly launched into a story from his teenage years about a movie theater, a broken slushie machine, and his high school at the time’s mascot that left both of them in near tears. The goal, as it almost always was when he was around Cas, was to get him to pay attention to Dean, to just watch.
The sounds on the other side of the door had faded, leading Dean to realize that Sam and Eileen had been gone for some time now, leaving him staring at the metal door. He turned around and there was Cas, seated at a table that had not been there yesterday with two chairs and a piece of paper. Dressed in one of Dean’s old shirts, worn jeans and a rumpled flannel, Cas looked as human as any of them—that is, if not for the soft blue glow of his grace, casting gentle shadows onto his face.
Dean’s throat closes up. His eyes are still on Cas’ mouth and he follows the path down, down to where Cas hands are at his sides. The right hand, the one whose shape he’s memorized, is balled into a fist at his side, thumb and pointer finger lightly rubbing together. Dean remembers the last time he saw that nervous tick: it was just this morning, talking to Jack.
“I don’t even think it’s possible for Jack to die,” Cas said. Dean knew what was hidden underneath those words. They were still holding hands, and Dean moved on to the next question, barely able to stay in his seat and keep his voice steady.
“But why?”
“Me too.”
Quick as that, it was nighttime. He slowed down, resisting the urge to slam on the brakes, and flicked Baby’s lights on. The trees from before were there, and so he was relatively sure that he was still in Heaven. ‘Cept that it was a Heaven that liked to move the clock forward 12 hours with no warning, though Bobby had said something about time working differently in Heaven. Dean hadn’t thought it would be so… unearthly.
Fuck, Dean really didn’t want to be dead. He had wanted long walks on the beach and time with his family but a rebar had decided to cut that plan in two. A stupid, routine hunt was what killed the man who defeated God.
“We’re hunters. You know this” Dean said. “Another easy one.”
Dean wants nothing more than to spill his guts, to tell him the truth. Put every part of his life, of the pain of the past six months into words and to place them gently into Cas’ hands and have Cas weigh them, to tell him that he’s worthy.
The responding grin was almost blinding.
“Dean,” he said, almost too low for him to hear. His voice was filled with warmth, and his eyes shone as bright as his grace,
Dean thinks
It’s Cas.
“It’s you for me too.”
Dean nodded, flashing lights filling his mind’s eye.
It’d be nice of magic to give Dean an easy out just once. Let him land on a bed, maybe, if he’s sleeping. Or even appear right in front of the person who needs to help him, the ingredient in their eager and waiting hands.
It had been about five minutes since Dean had fucked it all up, and he and Cas hadn’t said a word to each other yet. He glanced at Cas, who was looking anywhere that wasn’t him, and got out of his chair to see what was on the plate.
He steps on the new ring and turns around to check where he just was, but there’s nothing there. Emptiness. Swallowing, Dean tilts his head back, and there it is, way up in the sky away from him.
Pulling himself together, Dean says, “I told you Cas. I’m not leaving without your grace.”
Cas threw his head back in laughter, and heard Dean chuckle beside him.
“No, no, don’t apologize. It was fun. Besides, you were kind of hot yelling at them like that.”
“And I’m sure you sitting in a rundown motel talking to Marty McFly was written into the plan.”
“Why are you here Dean? I read Chuck’s manuscript for today, and nowhere was time travel from 10 years in the future mentioned.”
At this new angle, when Dean peered through the window and down the hallway and into an open door, he could see rows and rows of phones set up, exactly like the ones Bobby used to have. And just like how once you notice one crack in the glass you notice it all, Dean started to spot all the signs that The Apple Pie Life never came to fruition. In the back of the dining room hung a map of the states all dotted with little markers. In the hallway, a closed door with enough locks on it that it was either meant to keep monsters in or keep little children out. Signs of a life lived, even if it was the life of a hunter.
“To be able to leave the room, you two have to go through each of these questions, and they will fade from the page once answered. Only when all 36 are done will the door unlock,” Cas continued. He was squinting lightly at the page, and Dean wondered if maybe now that he wasn’t an angel he needed glasses. Cas fiddled with the chain of his grace.
The flash of blue caught Dean’s eye, hanging just above Cas’ heart, and his mouth felt stuffed with cotton. He looked back at Cas’ eyes, and was momentarily amazed by just how blue they still were, even without the grace. “Thanks, Cas,” he choked out.
Chuck drops his hand and all signs of attack disappear; his nose miraculously unbroken despite the crunch Dean had felt under his fist. Dean’s sure that if he checked even the bloodstains would be gone.
,” he mocks, “is supposed to bring me where I need to be when I need to be there to find the missing ingredient. How am I supposed to know what I’m looking for?”
Eyes bright blue and wide, head tilted just to the side. His hair spiked up like he’s perpetually just stuck his finger in a socket or had someone run their hands through it. His body sits on him strangely, as ill-fitting as the trench coat he wears, and Cas is standing barely inches from Dean, like he still hasn’t learned where this body ends and the world begins.
“Yes, we both are.”
At the admission, all flickers of emotion on Cas’ face disappear, as if he’s retreated far into the vessel. Dean almost wants to crack him open and crawl inside, like that will be the only way to figure out what he’s thinking. His hands itch to reach out, to brush against the coat to remind him that Cas is real and here, but he keeps them pressed flat on the table.
inside his mind, before he lost everything and was shocked into a personal revelation. Even now, he struggled to hold Cas’ gaze as he mentally noted that the question said like, not love.
“There’s nothing good on,” Dean complained as Cas awkwardly climbed into the car. Sitting in the passenger seat of the Impala was something he was well-versed in, but his newly human body occasionally just forgot how to work when he thought about it for a millisecond too long.
“Well, bottoms up.”
Fuck, he didn’t miss that.
Cas hummed quietly. “I always carry it on me, but if I didn’t then I'd say mixtape you gave me.”
They stared at each other. And stared. And stared. The moment felt a mile-wide, like it could span on for forever. At least until the timer on Cas’ phone rang, and they were both startled back into themselves. Cas released Dean’s wrist and Dean’s rubbed at it, longing for a ghost of Cas’ touch.
They had been trading answers rapid-fire, but Cas paused, studying Dean’s face instead of reading the next question. He opened his mouth, and one-by-one Dean could feel the petals inside him unfurl, ready to reach out and—
“I…” It’s not that Dean has nothing to say, but the weight of the words makes them sit like a rock in his chest, keeping him down. He pushes and pushes against them for some relief, some way to break the silence he’s been entombed in since the fire, but gravity always drags them back down. Even Sam asking the same has never gotten anything stronger than
Eyes land on Dean and the whimpering, stuttering prophet persona falls from Chuck like a landslide, leaving behind only unshakeable Earth and devastation for anyone caught in its path.
Cas gave Dean a fond glance before his eyes darted back down to the paper. A thick feeling filled Dean’s throat.
Cas glares. “I’ll erase their memories.”
Standing there, panting, he looked down at Cas, and saw how the imprint of his own body was marked in the grass next to him, a silhouette curled towards the angel. Dean wrenched his gaze away.
“Don’t walk in, there’s glass,” Cas said, standing up. ““I wanted to try something new with my grace. It didn’t work out how I thought it would.”
Chuck waves his hand. “Yeah but that’s not actually
that can reach into the Empty, and use it to save Cas. He moves past that point and it’s all static, a radio caught between frequencies.
The air in the room seems to crackle as Cas leans forward in his seat. “Heaven is preparing to fight a Biblical war against Hell thousands of years in the making, where every angel will take up arms to fight Lucifer and his army. I won’t be giving out my grace when I can’t spare it, not even to help the Righteous Man.”
Cas licks his lips and Dean watches, transfixed. “Nothing is worth risking all of this for,” Cas says. His voice is gentle, at war with the way the words slice into Dean. “Certainly not for an angel. We’re just soldiers obeying a higher plan, nothing more.”
Dean thinks about what he needs to do to get to the grace. To save Cas, Dean needs to know what he wants and why he wants it. They’re doomed.
“Let’s go,” Cas said, taking Dean’s hand and walking away from the crowd. In the distance, he could see the Impala haphazardly parked in a random parking lot, and his heart swelled. Cas knew it was a small detail, but he appreciated that yes, he really did come before Baby. Within minutes they were in the car and back on the road
“Who made these questions?” Dean exclaimed, still holding back his delight. “I already played that game. I’m glad I didn’t change anything.”
Dean shot him a dirty look and Cas laughed, dropping the air quotes and resting his hand on the steering wheel on top of Dean’s.
An all-too familiar ache built up inside him. Every time Cas died it wrecked Dean, but none more so than the last.
“Jack for me too.”
Cas nodded. “I’ll read this set.”
“Tha—That was not the reaction I was expecting,” Dean said, still half-hunched over. “Cas, buddy, are you okay?” Dean winced at the buddy, knowing what he had confessed moments before.
Oh, that wasn’t so bad. If the angle of Cas’ head meant anything, then he was thinking the same.
“Rowena is just as annoyed with your lack of communication as we are, and she’s in Hell, Dean. I thought you two had fixed this problem.”
Guilt pushed its way into Dean’s chest and he winced, before pushing it back down. “You know when, Cas. You were there for the first one, and after you were gone, after I just laid there for hours and hours, I was dry. Numb. I didn’t know what else to do, and we still had Chuck to fight.”
Despite the strength of the stuff under his feet, there’s a light spring in his step as he walks. Dean pulls a Dorothy and follows the yellow brick road, nowhere to go but forward. There’s a light tugging in his chest urging him to move and there are times where it feels less like it’s guiding him and more like he’s stumbling after it.
“Dean I… I have something to confess,” Cas said. Dean’s heart stuttered to a stop inside his chest. “I’m a fallen angel.”
Not that Dean doesn’t appreciate the lack of distance between the two, but if he’s going to calm down enough to do his job then he needs his space. Trapped between the sink and Cas, Dean takes an awkward step to the side, Cas turning with him like a needle on a compass.
“Get out,” Chuck says, resting one hip against the printer. “You and your brother are about to come—” he pauses, glancing at the paper, “’approach the ramshackle house with trepidation’,” he reads in a mocking tone. “And I suggest you scram so I don’t have to make too many edits.”
“Can we leave this one for the end?” Dean asked hesitantly.
He pries his eyes open with all the force of the jaws of life and is met with a curved surface under his feet. The material is something alien to Dean and it’s constantly transforming as if it’s passing through funhouse mirrors. He bounces lightly, testing its weight; it holds. It’s just wide enough to carry his frame but despite vertigo threatening to take hold, Dean has the feeling that it won’t let him fall.
“Yeah, it’s just a habit I formed when I’d use to have to call my dad from payphones and stuff. Could never let go of it,” Dean admitted.
Scrolling to the end of the document, Chuck clicks enter a couple times before settling his fingers over the keyboard. “What you need is the grace of a falling angel.”
“Can I use that for my answer?”
“I’m about to meet you as a prophet,” Dean points out.
Jack’s quiet for a moment, his hands balled into a fist and fingers lightly shifting. “You sound like Cas.”
“The last time I sung to myself—or to someone else—was while driving around in Baby,” Dean said, trying to push his thoughts out of his mind. “But it’s—it’s been a while, I haven’t… I haven’t wanted to sing.”
“Being in Dodge with you, and you indulging me by wearing that fake cowboy hat,” Dean said instead. It had been easy to pass off his excitement as merely being because of the cowboys, but that wasn’t it at all. Getting Cas back had been his ultimate win, and he needed to celebrate.
Before Dean could speak again, Cas read the first question.
A thought occurred to him. “Cas, you know that I didn’t give up, right? I was never going to leave you. Hell, when Jack dropped you off I was in the library, researching ways to pull someone from the Empty. I needed to make a game plan, and there was no time to cry.” At some point, he had tightened his grip around Cas’ hand, and he relaxed it but didn’t let go. He cleared his throat, and then leaned over to see the next question.
The yelling behind them turned to pointed jeers, but Cas closed his eyes and stuck out one finger, the way he had seen characters in Dean’s movies do. Pulling back for air (and that’s one thing he cursed about being human, how needing to breathe impaired his time with Dean) Cas laughed at the wide-eyed look on his lover’s face.
Dean hadn’t seen Jack since he had become god, and he hadn’t asked Cas about it. With a pang, he wished he had been kinder to the kid, or even just asked him to stay. Even all-powerful beings needed a little guidance and some home-cooked food.
They had just gotten back from that horrible case when Dean took the keys and headed out. Dean had given everything he had, taken a syringe to the heart and looked at Death herself, and still hadn’t been able to save that kid. Everyone died, and Dean trudged on.
“Oh,” Cas said. His eyes went distant for a moment, and he traced one of the lines on Dean’s palm.  “Last person I cried in front of was you. By myself? Probably late last night or early this morning.”
“This isn’t even a question,” Dean protested. For a second he held his breath, worried that Rowena’s looping scrawl would appear to tell him to fuck off. Nothing happened, and he relaxed. He didn’t want anyone to be listening in.
Was this praying? Did it count if he knew no one was listening? He hadn’t been able to pray to Cas since that night; it felt too empty knowing there would be nothing coming back. Just Dean as the Enterprise transmitting signals into the final, final frontier.
The words rang out between them, settling over the room like morning dew. Without noticing he had stood during his monologue and he had braced himself against the table, leaning on his hands. Cas was sitting and just staring up at Dean, tears in his eyes and mouth hung open.
He was strong, honest, happy. An inverse of Dean in the moment, even if the handprint on the jacket proves they somehow still met in the middle. And he was all of that because of Dean.
Distantly, Dean could hear Jack or Sam start to bump around, likely caught off guard by the sudden lack of light, but Dean didn’t have it within him to care about that. Cas’ face was inches from his, and his hands were reaching up slowly, tentatively. Dean saw them stop just before they touched his face, and realized that Cas was silently asking for permission. Dean nodded, and closed his eyes at the warmth on his cheek.
“I’m going, I’m going,” Dean says to it. “Chill out.”
, it repeats more insistently this time.
“This morning, uhh—“ he checks his phone “—just under an hour ago I took a potion, the sands of time, that’s supposed to bring me exactly to where I need to be when I need to be there. I think it brought me to you.”
Cas eyes widened. “We are both in this room feeling… excited?” he said, voice uplifting near the end. Dean was feeling more than a little excited, the warmth of Cas’ knee turning into a blazing heat even through two layers of denim. He shifted in his seat.
It was Dean on his knees in a crypt, covered in his own blood, choking out words that weren’t quite right.
“You’re trusting me with this?” he asked, momentarily embarrassed by how wrecked he sounded from just a kiss.
“Cas,” he begins, voice already thick. He speaks at no more than a whisper but feels every nerve alight like he’s screaming this to the world.
“It’s because I’m afraid,” he said.
. That fucker was somewhere in Heaven and not in Dean’s passenger seat, where Dean could yell at him for just throwing everything on him and leaving like that, with no hope or promise of coming back. There had been no time to talk, no time to
The bitch face appeared, indicating that he was tired of Dean’s shit. “Dean, you are going to be the one who goes twice," Cas said. Dean put his hands up in surrender.
His voice surprises him with its steadiness. “What else is there to do?”
So it fucking goes.
“Sure. I’ll go first.” He thought for a moment. Know a guy for twelve years, but the second you’re asked to make a comparison, all thought leaves your head. “We are both in this room feeling… feeling… nervous. Feeling nervous.”
“Peanut butter sandwiches. Really, Sam?” Dean muttered, carrying it over to the table and setting it down between them. If only they had been let out so Dean could cook, and he could fix his mistakes over warm food.
When that happens he never returns to his dreams, dark as they are, choosing instead to stumble once more to the Bunker library, searching for ways into the Empty. Sam’s found him more than once passed out over a book older than the country. He learned quickly not to wake Dean when he’s like that.
She laughs, head tilted back. “Your food will be out soon, on the house.”
If Dean plays his cards right, he can save Cas and himself from suffering under Chuck’s ending for them, alone and wanting. He’ll take
staring at him like that. Like he was worth something. Dean had shunned it once but he craves it like air now.
If he was 20 years younger it’d probably be for a smoke. 10 and it’d be to go clean his guns or drink himself until Hell was nothing more than a blip in the rearview mirror. Now, he almost wants to take out his phone and listen to the voicemail, let the voice of his Cas soothe his nerves. But it’s not worth it to waste the battery.
“I said stop the car.” Dean had slowed down enough that Cas just got out, almost tripping over the landing. Behind him he heard the screech of tires and Dean’s confused yell, but he ignored it in favor of walking towards the protesters.
His right hand reaches out like he’s about to tap Dean on the forehead before Cas hesitates, eyebrows furrowed, and he leans down to rest his hand on Dean’s shoulder instead.
The motel door locks with a faint click, and the hand is gone. Dean composes himself and pushes off the wall, back into Cas’ space. He can feel the energy crackling off of him but he trusts Cas not to actually hurt him. He hopes Cas was being honest when he said that he’s loved Dean since he pulled him from Hell, because he’s going to need that now.
“You still have to respond. If the question doesn’t fade, we can’t get out of here,” Dean said.
“Of course,” Dean echoed, closing his eyes and leaning in.
“What is wrong?” Cas questions, pressing forward. Their chests are almost touching and Dean laughs wetly, tilting his head back and running a hand over his face.
(The last question had, in fact, faded, but neither of them took the time to check. Dean and Cas weren’t leaving that room for a long, long time.)
The click of a laptop closing. “So you found that one out?”
Instead of trying to explain anything at all, Dean kissed him.
Someone shouts in the street and Dean follows the noise, eyes landing on his past self who has finally noticed Baby being violated. A screech of tires, and the minivan sends him flying as Dean winces from afar.
Dean whistled. “Wow. Complicated ones. It’s hard to let people show me those things, I’m so used to being the caretaker that I can’t let go of the habit.” There was more he could say, but he wanted Cas to speak; he was interested in seeing an ex-angel’s perspective on this, but more so, he was interested in seeing Cas’ perspective on this.
It must have been a good day for the meadow when he scattered Cas’ ashes. Bees buzzing and the water humming and the windmill standing tall in the distance all while Dean crumbled to his knees and begged Chuck to bring him back.
“No,” Dean cuts in, voice rough. Anger rises in him sharply and threatens to spill over; he grits his teeth and forces it down like bile. “Cas is my best friend. He needs to be rescued from the Empty, and so it’s my job to do it.”
“But what did you need it for?”
“You ass,” Dean protested, squeezing Cas’ hand. “You’re going to give me a heart attack.”
The voice is quiet.
The trio had just returned to the bunker, Sam going straight to his room with the intention of collapsing on his bed. For now, it was just Dean and Cas in the map room. Jack had skipped this hunt, and—if he had listened to Cas—should be sleeping soundly in his bed.
He felt a hand run through his hair, tightening at nape of his neck and holding his head firmly in place. A shiver went through Dean, and he groaned against Cas’ mouth.
“With what?” Dean asks, incredulous.
“Then I’m glad to be part of the club,” Cas said. He thought for a moment, before wincing to himself. “Do you remember the night we met at the barn?”
Whatever Dean was expecting, it wasn’t that. “Lobotomies?” he echoed.
“This door won’t open until you two do the questions,” Sam replied, not bothering to conceal the mirth in his voice.
“What is it?” Dean asked, voice tense.
Dean spots a car to hotwire, brown and busted to hell, his soul mourning that he has to drive anything other than Baby.
Cas gingerly takes a seat, posture stiff. “Yes.”
It was warm and chaste and made all the better by Cas’ heavy weight pressing him down into the soft earth. It also tasted a bit like dirt, but Dean could forgive that. He was kissing Cas!
“I love you too,” Cas said. There was no hesitance, no room for doubt. Cas said it like he had been saying it his whole life. Dean leaned in, and he felt Cas do the same. Cas’ breath ghosted over his lips, and—
Cas smiled. “Not quite.” He extended his hand, offering to help Dean up.
The both pulled back, and Dean opened his eyes. Cas was still on the ground and his hands were still on Dean’s face, and for a second, they just stared.
The routine is easy and familiar and he’s got the car up and running in no time, engine stuttering before settling into an unsteady purr. He’ll take what he can get.
“I’m very old,” Cas said. “I don’t think these questions were designed with former angels in mind.”
This is a diamond caught on tape. It’s the stars he used to swear were following him in the night as his dad drove them from hunt to hunt.
In sign language, during the little lessons Eileen had given him and the ones the internet had provided when she had better things to do, Dean learned that “I want” was formed by placing your hands out, palms open and face up, and then making a claw and pulling it towards you.
8 hours 40 minutes left to convince an angel to jump ahead in the script and help him. Dean’s resolve steels and he tucks his phone in his pocket, heading towards the doorway. If Cas isn’t going to listen to him, then he’s going to need to push some buttons to make him.
When Cas speaks, his voice is hard as marble. “I am not going to give you my grace, not for this. Our lives are long, and my brethren’s must have been longer than most if he survived the upcoming war. The angel you’re trying to save had enough time.”
He yanked down.
“Fine, don’t tell me. Keep it a mystery. Not like I can’t just change the plot anyways,” Chuck mutters.
Oh shit, he was kissing Cas.
The words are expected, the angry tone familiar, but Dean is a little less focused on what Cas is saying and more on desperately trying to forget what motels like these are used for.
“I don’t know if I can fit everything into four minutes,” Cas said, pulling his phone from his pocket and starting a timer.
It was all that he could give, and he found that something had settled within him.
Dean fights the impulse to just tell him everything, screw interfering with the timeline. He could deal with coming back to his own time to a zombie apocalypse or the android revolution if it meant he could face it with Cas by his side.
“Get used to it.”
There was a knock on the door, a quick open-and-shut, and a plate was set on the ground.
It wouldn’t be the first for either of them. Dean remembers a bench, and Cas’ voice so soon after their initial meeting telling him
Dean kicks a chair out from the table so Cas can sit in it before Cas’ words catch up to him. “Wait—all of it?”
For so long, all that Dean had left of Cas that wasn’t in his head was his voicemail, the same words playing on a loop originally made only to please Dean. He had searched for something more concrete, a memory to hold, but Cas’ room had been barren, his car empty. Playing the voicemail had been a treat for Dean, an indulgence only for when they’d made advancements in saving Cas. Dean would listen to it at night with his door locked just staring at the ceiling, Cas’ voice low and close to his ear as if Dean could just turn around and Cas would be right there, lying next to him. The fantasy always ended there, as short as the only message he had left.
“Okay, okay,” he said. “You’re always so willing to try.”
“How deeply you feel everything.”
“I do, you know I still have that mixtape.” Cas paused, reveling in the way Dean blushed. “I just also enjoy Claire’s music, it makes me feel closer to her. I don’t understand Jack’s, but—“
“You know, my plan for Castiel was to have him pull you from hell and then do his job, but I was interested in how he acted around you. He likes to stand close, doesn't he?”
“Kid, there’s no way you could have known we’d need it, and even if you did what could you have done? Don’t blame yourself.”
“Cas, buddy, you can’t just get out of a moving car like that,” Dean said, clapping a hand on Cas’ shoulder. An idea flickered within Cas, and he spun around and grabbed Dean by the collar, pulling him in for a kiss that was mostly an angry clash of lips.
“That barely counts, isn’t it the only thing you own?”
Cas glanced down at the paper, and Dean guessed that the question had faded. The truth of their statements was thick in the air, but it no longer felt like it was hanging between them, trying to push them apart. There was a gravity drawing him in towards Cas, and he leaned forward to better hear the next question.
“It is not written.” Then, his face morphing into something almost-human, Cas says, “I’m sorry, Dean.”
He downs it like a shot, well-practiced in the art. The potion tastes—funnily enough—like honey straight from the hive. Dean’s last thought before it all goes dark is
“You’re right, I’m not,” he agrees, voice unsteady. He wrenches his gaze off the far wall and lets it settle on Cas, unnaturally blue eyes locked on his own. Dean takes a deep breath, remembers the last words Cas ever said to him, and goes, “Hi Cas.”
Cas reaches out, stopping before he touches Dean, silently asking for permission. Dean nods carefully and offers his hands to Cas, tracking the movement as Cas cups his hands around Dean’s wrists, as gently as if he were cradling a baby bird. A quick glow, and Dean’s hands are healed and newly aching from the loss of contact.
A tugging at Cas’ lips, the ghost of a smile on someone who doesn’t quite know how to work one yet. “You’ve gone through much in these past years. That’s not something you do now.”
The man ignored him, content to spout hate speech into his microphone again. Logically, Cas knew that none of it mattered much. Just like him, the people in the cars likely couldn’t actually hear what they were saying. The group would probably disperse within the day, finding another place to spread their message.
“Trust,” Cas said.
The scenery clicks into place, memory superimposed onto reality. He knows everything from the street he’s on to the cars he’s looking at to the exact spots to avoid so he doesn’t run into his past self and create an Ashton Kutcher moment.
Dean wants a drink. He wants to upend the motel room and destroy everything not bolted to the floor. He wants to drive back to Chuck’s house and see how much damage he can give to a God.
had to see, because Cas was always already paying attention. Even now, just watching Cas absentmindedly rub his hands along the wall, Dean never wanted to look away. A nervous energy filled him, the same one that had sparked through his fingertips when he made Cas keep the mixtape.
Cas’ voice echoed in his head. He wanted to reach out and do something, anything, but instead he gestured towards the paper.
. As in on the precipice. At the top of the hill. Perched on the edge, etc. etc.”
Dean takes a deep breath, letting the air out through his nose. “I’m trying to rescue an angel from the Empty.”
Across from Dean’s perch on his bed and draped across a chair is the jacket, the one he’s mysteriously unable to find any time Sam comes in to do the laundry, but resurfaces the moment the door is closed. With nowhere else to go, his eyes drift to it.
“Nothing, Cas, nothing at all. I’m happy to see you.” Just saying that feels like a confession.
Dean thinks,
“Well, I already saved my brother,” Dean joked. “Probably family photos.”
The bed desperately wants to make itself known from the corner of his eye. “Including the sex scene between me and Cassie? I mean, that was full frontal even for those books.” God, Dean hopes he isn’t blushing. Cas read about him having sex with someone named Cassie and he thought it was the word of God.
Nothing about the way this false prophet is dressed would indicate power, but how Chuck holds himself—the weight in his eyes—speaks to his true self. Dean keeps himself steady, remembering the way his Chuck would one day beg in the dirt, stripped of Godhood.
Dean laughed softly. This situation was still salvageable, of course it was. You don’t tell someone you love them, just to take it back when they can’t get over themselves. Cas has known Dean for 12 years, known him better than anyone else in his life, they could do this. Dean could do this.
Something swelled within Dean. Sitting there, one shoe on and one shoe off, Dean knew that he would never like anyone as much as he liked Cas. He was earnest, kind, funny. Whenever they watched movies together, Dean never felt like he had to draw attention to his favorite parts, the ones that
The bell on the door rings again, signaling either an entrance or an exit, and Dean cranes his neck to watch his past self and Sam exit the diner, making their way towards Baby. Did they really look like that from the back? And to think, he’d wanted to take scissors to Sammy’s hair even then.
“Jack.”
“Really, man, you can’t do something about all this mess?”
Dean rolls his beer bottle in his hands, satisfied by the sound it makes scraping against the table.
“Your aliases,” Dean said.
disappearing under his palm. Turning it over, the slight red imprints and splinter sticking out tells him he has been absentmindedly tracing the name for much longer than he realizes.
Silence hung over them again, only the sound of their breathing, the clink of Cas’ chain, and the tap of Dean’s fingers filling the room.
Cicadas—or at least Heaven’s mockery of them—sung in the summer air around him, drifting in through Baby’s rolled-down window. The night had come on suddenly for him but he felt every inch of it weigh on him, tired down to his bones. He knew that at any moment he could take the key from the ignition and walk right inside to Sam’s welcoming arms, brothers reuniting alternatively after a couple hours and a couple decades. Dean’s needs and wants had evolved with age, but the core of them lay with Sam’s peace, and now that was fulfilled. But still, there was someone missing from this Heaven.
Jack was standing by the stairs, dressed in pajamas. He tilted his head in a perfect imitation of Cas.
“Don’t you see that I’m alive? That I’m here?” Dean begins. He’s desperate for Cas to understand him, to truly see him the way he always has. “Humanity isn’t extinct and Hell doesn’t rule the Earth, go team! End of times averted. When we first met you told me that I don’t think I deserve to be saved but guess what? I am here and I am saved but only if you give me some of your grace.”
“I’m glad you enjoyed it, then,” Cas teased.
He opens his mouth, hoping that something will come out that won’t get him killed, before the wall of the motel is once again digging into his back.
Coming back to himself, Dean realized how long it had been, and how Cas was still waiting on him to finish his sentence.
It was Cas’ term to usher Dean along to the next question, and he could do nothing but obey.
Dean takes his eyes off his hands, the skin clean and unbroken. “That’s easy. God told me.”
Without a word, Chuck gets up and paces to the door. “You’re dealing with things older than Lucifer, Dean, older than me even.” He pauses in his steps. “How did I let the plot spiral out like this? No, no, moving on.” Chuck whirls around, pointing a finger at Dean. “I don’t have any jurisdiction over the Empty and I’m not going to pretend I do.”
“This is for Cas,” he reminds himself, before grimacing and bringing the crowbar down on Baby’s rear window, shattering it. It feels like he’s brought it down on his own hand, the bone scattered alongside the glass. In the panic of taking care of the strange man only now coming to consciousness, no one even turns their head towards the noise.
No response on the one-way street. He keeps his eyes closed, lets the darkness settle over him like a skin. The fabric is rough and sturdy underneath his fingertips and he imagines reaching up towards the shoulder and his hand coming away wet as if Cas only just cashed in on the deal that's left Dean breathless ever since. Dean could just grab his hand, still dripping blood, and bandage it even though angels don’t need it because taking care of Cas like this is the only way he knows how.
His steps make no noise on the material, nor do they leave any trace that he was ever there. The only sounds are a faint whirring, reminding Dean almost of a hummingbird, if not one with a thousand more wings.
Cas’ mouth hung open, forming an O-shape. Dean did his best not to stare.
Cas shatters the silence. “You aren’t from this time.” The words drift out and dissipate into the air, as if Cas hasn’t yet figured out he’s speaking on a frequency meant for human ears.
He thinks he may have just quoted something. Cas and his angel-granted pop culture encyclopedia would know, though he wouldn’t be able to use it right. Warmth blooms in Dean and he ducks his head, feeling the smile tugging at his lips. It doesn’t quite make it to launch, but Cas has always been able to bring one out of Dean, even in the darkest times of the darkest times, when the light at the end of the tunnel bled red.
“I’m always the last one out,” Dean forced out. “I always hang on for too long. I’ve just never learned how to say goodbye.”
God, Sam was probably with Jack at the Bunker right now, explaining to him why Dean couldn’t even handle a simple case. Sam was grieving too, but he was working on it, he was managing it. Meanwhile, Dean drank himself to sleep every night and yelled at anyone who looked his way.
“I’m not just talking about that,” Dean admitted. “You’re human now, Cas. There are a thousand ways to leave that you can’t control, and I can’t—I can’t…” He let his words hang there, silently pleading that Cas knew what he was trying to convey. Cas’ face shifted from confusion to something else, something deeper, and he read the next question.
“Ow, ow, Jesus FUCK,” Chuck exclaims, hunched over in the doorway with one hand clutching his nose. Dean can see the red bleed through and watches with a sick satisfaction as it drips onto the floor, staining the doormat.
Before his words were finished he knew it wouldn't work. He could still feel the phantom weight of Cas on top of him, how the weeds underneath his head had bit into him. Knowledge sunk into him, heady and warm: no matter what he’d eat, no matter what he’d drink, Dean would always be able to taste Cas’ lips against his own.
, he thinks. No. That’s not him thinking it. The thought appears in his head, not passing through his ears, but it’s not Dean’s.
He waves his hand dismissively, lifting the glass to his nose and sniffing. It doesn’t smell like anything, and he sets it back on the table with a
“Maybe.”
Chuck moves to open the door and Dean breaks out of his freeze. “Wait, wait, please.” A wild desperation claws its way through him, sending his heart racing. This is his chance; this is his
They laughed together and Dean leaned forward in his seat, pressing his knee more against Cas'. They were done with set two, and Dean had managed to fix his problem and more. Now there were only 12 questions standing in the way of him and getting what he wanted.
“I don’t want to answer this one,” Dean said. His clothes felt too tight, like he was choking again.
“I wouldn’t say that my ‘childhood’ was either of those things, because I was a celestial being who sprung out of existence fully formed to be a soldier of the lord,” Cas said, using quotation marks Dean thought were long gone. Dean laughed, and a warm feeling passed between the two. “But the angels aren’t my actual family. Jack is, Claire is, Sam is, you are. Maybe it’s hard to be close and warm with god, but I’m sure that Jack wouldn’t mind coming down for a family dinner every once in a while.”
Cas shakes his head, the action so human. The streetlight behind him creates a halo effect. “I can shield you.”
Setting the glass down, Dean closes his eyes, takes the end of the jacket in his hands—avoiding the handprint—and starts his prayer.
He’s considerate and caring and can talk anyone’s ear off for hours about honey and he’s only in this mess because he gave up everything for his son just so Jack could have a chance to live. Because Cas loves him, because Cas loves everything.
Desperate for something heavy, he reaches in the backseat and closes his hands on the first object he touches that fits the bill: the crowbar that looks like it’s been around longer than the town. He opens the car door and glances around, but all attention is focused on his past self still lying in the street.
“You told me that you couldn’t have what you wanted, the one thing you wanted. Me, right?” The words are hard to choke out, but he forces himself to be brave the way Cas was. “Well, when the world thrives, when the apocalypse is over and we have time to breathe, that’s when you get to move past needs, that’s when you get to have your wants. Do you hear me? I need you to hear me.
Still hidden, Dean slides his phone from his pocket; 6 hours 20 minutes. So much time wasted just driving around, working on blind faith that this plan will come to fruition. By now he’s probably half-way at Chuck’s house, breaking every speed limit all the while. He knows that Cas comes almost immediately to the confrontation, breaking the news of prophecy and telling Dean
“And is that written?”
“What?” Dean asked, glancing at Cas, but Cas was already unbuckling his seat belt.
The metal was cool underneath his fingers, and he was a little disappointed that it wasn’t the blue tie, but he filed that fact away for later in favor of shifting the angle, slotting their lips together into something less bruising but just as passionate.
When he opens the diner door, the little bell announcing his presence sends him into a mini heart attack, suddenly all too aware of what could go wrong if he falls off this tightrope walk. But when he strains his ears, he can hear him and Sam discuss Lilith in their booth, too wrapped up in the conversation to notice him.
“Someone who liked a bacon cheeseburger that much could never be vegetarian,” Dean whispers conspiratorially. “I wouldn’t worry about it.”
“All that shaking… that wasn’t a display of power. I was a little too eager to talk to ‘the Michael Sword’ and prove myself, and I messed up,” he admitted.
Cas’ eyes flicker across his face, searching for something. “God has been absent from Heaven longer than your mind could comprehend.”
Dean pulled back and shoved Cas off of him, climbing to his feet as quickly as his hunter's knees allowed him to.
He doesn’t know when it happened, but every move he makes turns to Cas, some habit that had snuck up on him. In the dead of night, he’d wake up, arm numb, and discover that he’d been laying on it in his sleep, right hand clutching the scar.
There was silence, and then he looked up at Dean, a playful look on his face. “In the beginning, God cre—“
"You need to venture into my true form. If you’re going to be the one using my grace when I am not there, then you need to be the one to retrieve it. It needs to go willingly.”
“It’s tradition.”
“It’s split into three sections,” Cas said. “I’ll keep reading out all the questions for the first section.”
Before Dean could remove his hand, Cas caught his wrist and held it just above his chest. Dean’s heart pounded, hot and heavy as a drum, and he swallowed. “My life started with you, Dean, I’m not sure there’s much you don’t already know.”
“That’s cause we let Charlie introduce Jack to
That’s Dean. He’s stuck here, stuck with no ability to move on and become someone else, rooted in a past he clings on to as the present. Repeating this over and over again, going through the motions until he goes to sleep and hopes that maybe this time, when he wakes up, Cas will be back. That’s how it happened once before, right? Coming back from the dead and Cas’ number on his phone and sheer relief striking through Dean hot and quick that he had managed to survive.
there are eyes—endless eyes—but nothing so organic as a pupil and iris and all of that. It’s eyes in the way that houses have eyes, that the knots in trees have eyes, everything positioned just right so that the whole world is watching you. Pattern upon pattern he recognizes and it’s all paying attention to Dean.
“Yeah,” Dean replied, mouth quirking up. But Cas didn’t miss the way his knuckles turned white on the steering wheel, or the way he was resolutely looking ahead. Cas made up his mind.
“So, prophet, huh?” Dean prods, unsure of what he can reveal he knows. He makes his way towards the bed before stopping in his tracks and beelining to the nearest chair. Maybe if he pointedly does not look at the bed it’ll just disappear.
“Part of a demon’s essence,” Sam continues, “Which Rowena bartered with us for, and one thing else, but…” Sam trails off.
For 12 years Cas was Dean’s best friend and Dean knew everything and nothing about him. His favorite food was peanut butter and jelly. He hated Crowley. He loved Dean. Loves, even. Somewhere in a dark place he loves him still. And Dean wasn’t allowed to see it until it was the last thing Cas thought he’d ever see of him. Eyes filled with tears but with a face so radiantly happy that Dean remembers how he seemed to glow, like his true form was spilling out.
“Cas, I think you have to go,” he said.
First stop is the diner he and Sam had eaten at, stumbling right into Chuck’s story. Dean’s stomach growls: all he’s eaten today is that potion, and it’s not exactly filling for a grown man. The stolen car rumbles to a start and Dean takes off, obeying every light and speed limit. If he’s going to do this then he’s going to do it right.
The swirling golden liquid seems to stare at Dean, its shimmer holding weight. On principle, Dean tries not to put things in his body that emit light, a childhood’s worth of movies telling him that never ends well. He swallows and tears his gaze from the glass.
“Castiel,” Dean said, and heard Cas' breath hitch. “I love you. I’m sorry I didn’t say it before” The words came tumbling out of him and he couldn’t stop, but he didn’t want to stop. “I’m not just talking about when you told you told me you loved me, I mean every single before. When I took over my body from Michael. When you called me when you came back after Lucifer killed you. When you nearly died from that poison. When Lucifer finally stopped possessing you. When I hurt you with the Mark of Cain. When I saw you when you were human. When we were in purgatory. When I saw you and you didn’t remember me. When I just left you in that ring of fire. When we got kicked out of that brothel and I had never laughed so hard. Hell, I should have told you that I loved you as I stabbed that knife into your heart. Because I did, because I do. I love you.”
As his favorite author had once said, so it goes.
“What are you—“ he whispers before a hand is shoved tightly over his mouth. He pushes at it but Cas’ grip is unrelenting.
“Is it really so horrible to be in a room alone with me?” Cas teased, echoing his words from the beginning of the day. Dean’s hand was still pinned under Cas and he flipped it, interlacing their fingers.
“Don’t. It’ll only stress you out.”
Dean nods. “Sort of like pulling the sword from the stone. Only the worthy can do it.”
Dean stops. The bottle weeps condensation and he tracks a drop moving down, down, down the bottle before splashing on the table.
“I need some help,” Dean says, echoing his own still-unspoken words. “I’m praying, okay?”
“You say I changed you? Prove it then. Come back. Be changed. You’ve saved me from gods and angels and monsters more times than I could count, but you also saved me from myself. I’m returning the favor, but don’t you dare think this is a quid pro quo.”
“Read the questions, Cas,” he said. Dean felt tense, ready to jump up at any moment; he needed this to be done. Cas squinted his eyes at him, and then removed his hand and grabbed the paper.
“How do you know about this spell?” Cas asks after a beat. “How do you know about the Empty at all?”
At some point Dean had started bouncing his leg and he stopped, looking down at the table before looking back at Cas. He remembered all the times he had talked himself out of calling Cas when Cas was gone, convincing himself that he’d say something—anything—and let slip how he really felt.
His waitress comes up, face apologetic. “I accidentally delivered your food to a man over there,” she says, tilting her head back to where he knew he and Sam were sitting, “And I didn’t notice that I hadn’t given him his tofu burger until he had already taken a bite of your food. God, I hope he isn’t vegetarian.”
Chuck shakes his head. “Not fallen—fall
“Hello, Dean.”
, Dean thinks distantly. Jack thought they were so cool.
“It’s been a couple of weeks since you left me, and this world is still turning. Well, turning again, there have been some advancements in the plot since you last saw us. I’ll tell you all about them when I see you again.”
“Look down,” he mumbles to himself, voice much higher than normal. “Look down, that’s something I can do. Just open my eyes and look down.” He feels half-crazed.
music, which was a mistake from the start.”
Dean wonders how many waitresses and restaurant-goers have been introduced to the supernatural because he and Sam had been unaware of their volume. Dean waves at a waitress looking at him and takes a seat in a booth at the back, tucked all the way in the corner. The waitress from earlier comes up to him, pen clicking, and Dean remembers the tofu burger he had originally ordered and how he longed for years after that one bite of bacon cheeseburger.
“We have it,” Dean interjects, voice sharp. He’s kept the jacket he’d been wearing that day pristine, laid out on a chair with the handprint facing his bed.
“Next question,” Dean breathed out, breaking the moment.
“Dean, you don’t have to—“
“I think there was a lot more of her in me than my father ever wanted there to be,” Dean said. “After she died, my dad was not a religious man, but the way he talked about getting revenge for her, it was like he was worshipping her and I was too young to be able to resist. I’m glad I got to know her as a person, not a figure.”
In absence of words, Dean leans across the table to drag the golden potion towards him. The glass is strangely warm to the touch, contrasting the wet coolness on his hands from the beer. The nerves in his gut protest his sobriety and he almost regrets not taking even a sip. But if he can do anything, he can be sober for this.
The hunt had been easier than expected. Well, that’s not to say everything had gone perfectly. Dean was completely covered in blood—it squelched underneath his boots with every step—and the vamp had nearly taken a bite out of Sam, but they had had it under control. Dean had been doing vamp hunts since he was heavy enough to handle a machete, and he knew exactly how to handle them. Plus, watching Cas slice off the head of one that had nearly pinned Dean against a wall had certainly… done things to Dean. It reminded him of the heavenly fury that Cas used to hold within him. Dean still caught glimpses of it from time to time but it had been replaced by something warmer.
But it’s not this Cas Dean needs to speak to. The hair is wrong, there’s no scar on his palm from when he cut his hand as a human. No 12 years of shared memories, of a shared life.
Dean bristles: it feels like Cas is in Bobby’s kitchen threatening to send him back to hell if he doesn’t behave all over again. “I don’t need all of it, Cas, I’m not trying to make you human I’m trying to save a friend.”
He took Cas’ hand by the palm and removed it from his face, leaning in to find the offending eyelash. Dean was barely breathing as he cleared the eyelash from where it had been balancing on Cas’ waterline.
Twenty days past Chuck’s defeat and Dean has nothing to show but empty spaces. At times it doesn't even feel like he’s free, like he managed to escape, and it's just that the AuthorGod of his life knows that what he’s doing is too boring to present to the audience. The man never knew how to write about a lack of action.
“Okay, your turn,” Dean said. “I’ve never told anyone about that, and Sammy has been sworn into secrecy.”
Chuck continues, oblivious to Dean’s realization. “It’s because they’re not fully an angel, but not anywhere close to being human like you, and so their grace doesn’t know where to go upon death, creating an ambiguous zone that the spell exploits to open a portal into the Empty. But I haven’t written any angels to be like that—that’s not where I want the plot to go—so who…” Chuck trails off. Dean tears his gaze from the computer screen, the cursor blinking on and off, and meets Chuck’s eyes. They’re blue, but not the bright shade he finds himself dreaming of. They’re cold, dangerous as the ice Chuck once let freeze over the world.
I need some help. I’m praying.
Dean laughed. “And I’m rather famous on Earth, so what a pair we make.”
The brook was a steady thrum, the noise settling over the meadow like a blanket. A wasp buzzed by his ear and he waved it away.
“Did you tell any other angel I’m here?”
He joins Chuck on the couch, trying to sit as far as possible from the man before realizing that the edge of the couch acts like quicksand. Settling at a respectable distance, he turns towards Chuck and begins to speak.
“Watching you die,” Dean said, holding eye contact with Cas. “Every time I’ve ever had to watch you die. Cas, I can’t—“
The urge to scrub at his skin bubbles up inside Dean, wanting to scrape off Chuck’s words. But he forces himself to keep the eye contact.
Embarrassment threatens to wash over Dean, and he ducks his head, awkwardly rubbing one hand against his neck. “You taught me how. Well, it was a bit like you threw me in the deep end and forced me to either learn or drown, but beggars can’t be choosers.”
Cas said nothing, and kissed him.
This close, Dean can smell the way the scent of ozone clings to him, a perpetual thunderstorm in motion. Dean had missed it; misses it even now.
One of Dean’s fondest memories of his dad was thanksgiving when he was 8, when the three of them had all sat down and watched reruns of oldies all day. His dad had told them that they always used fake diamonds on screen because real diamonds would shine too much, distracting from the film. Dean had no idea if he was telling the truth but he believed it because he trusted his dad.
Snapping his fingers, Chuck vanishes part of the clutter, clearing the way for Dean. “No can do; I have to keep up the tortured genius act.”
No, it did not look cool like in the movies.
“Thank you for listening,” Dean replied, unable to come up with a quip. The air felt too warm and too cold at the same time, the room pressing in at all sides. Talking about his childhood was something Dean never did unless he was drunk or ready to wield every pop culture reference in his armory. What he just did, stripped of any metaphor and irony, just the truth laid bare, it felt like too much. This was all too much.
“No,” Dean says, voice breaking. “No he didn’t.”
Dean was so caught up in studying the house that he almost jerked the wheel when Sam came into frame. Objectively, he knew that time worked differently in Heaven, but it was one thing to be confronted with that by a simple time jump, and another to be consumed by the crushing feeling that your baby brother was only so close to you because he was dead. For all the fear and sorrow that crept into Dean at that realization, he didn’t expect the giddy wave of relief. It was done. His job was done. He could breathe now.
The ice in Dean’s whiskey glass has long since melted but condensation still drips down, marking a path on the floor as he sets the glass down and picks it up over and over, never drinking but pretending he could.
“Yeah,” Dean admits, rubbing the back of his neck. “Set two?”
“How were you even able to do that?” Dean asked.
That was easy. “Sam,” Dean said.
He was putting it nicely for Cas. After doing the deed, he climbed in Baby and looked down, and there Cas was all over him, a dark blot on his flannel. It had taken many deep breaths with his forehead pressed against the steering wheel to be able to hold in his lunch, to not collapse on the spot.
“We should go back,” Dean rushed out, an attempt to smooth everything over. “The Impala’s just over there. You should meet Jack, see Sam again. Your room in the Bunker is just the way it was, I didn’t let anyone touch it.”
“Likewise,” Cas said.
A mocking smile, and then Chuck is plopping himself on his couch, the springs screaming in protest. “Planning every little detail out has never been my style, anyways. I prefer a general direction and writing as I go. Though my publishers don’t always appreciate that,” he adds.
Chuck glances towards his closed laptop. If Dean remembers right, he was mid-sentence writing the Winchester Gospels when he and Sam rang the doorbell. “Self-inserts are a little tacky, but you are my main character.”
“You need to eat.”
For all that Dean has been unable to think about anything but Cas since the handprint left on his shoulder, none of that thinking has gone into the future. His plan so far is this: research, find something (a spell, a tablet, a god, a witch,
“We both want to make sure it never happens again,” Cas said.
“I guess we, I guess we start?” Dean said, his voice uplifting near the end. He reached out to the papers at the same time as Cas, and their fingers brushed in the middle. He yanked his hand back and quickly put it on his knee, tapping his fingers nervously. “You can read it.”
“Did we not just do this one?” Dean asked, mostly to himself. “Give me a second.”
“In all my time observing humanity I’ve never understood how people manipulate religion to justify their prejudice. I can assure them that Jack does not care about human sexuality,” Cas said, glancing at Dean.
Of course, he had an idea of what he didn’t want, but that could be summed up by the desperate plea of
“I guess not,” Cas said, wrinkling his nose. “I’m already rather famous in Heaven, I don’t need a repeat of that on Earth.”
Dread was replaced by giddy relief, and Dean laughed in spite of himself. “I think you have an eyelash stuck, that’s something that happens to humans. Let me see.”
. The earth had crept under his fingernails in a mockery of the time he had broken out of his own grave. Dean wanted that again; he’d take the long walk and the ruptured eardrums just for the good part, for the flash of wings and the chance to start all over again.
“So,” Dean began, clearing his throat. “How much—how much did you see?”
“Really? Sesame Street?” Dean asks, unable to help himself. It doesn’t seem to fit with the monsters he hunts.
They loaded the groceries back into the cart, this time bagged, and walked out to the Impala. Once the cart was emptied, Cas put it back in the store, and returned to the car to see Dean fiddling with the radio.
He hoped the grief hadn’t been too sharp.
“If I get over this inability to speak my mind, just completely let go of it,” Dean answered truthfully, stuffing half his sandwich in his mouth.
“Then don’t,” a voice said.
“It led me to you.”
Jack’s voice cut through the moment. “What happened with the lights?”
Dean looked down at the paper, but the question was still inky black against the white.
Normally, this would be when Dean froze up, closing up to himself and the world, but the warmth of Cas’ knee pressed against his made him want to melt.
“And?” he prompted.
“Next question,” Dean said, pulling back without breaking eye contact. He moved to his side of the table and picked up his chair, seating himself. Their knees were brushing once again, but Dean let it happen.
“Cas,” Dean began. His voice was rough from disuse; he swallowed hard and tried again. “Cas, I…
Dean thinks desperately.
Dean glances around the room, at the faces of those he loves. Jack sits in his chair slightly hunched, hand resting near his beer. Dean fights the urge to yank it away from him. Shifting to Sam, he’s almost surprised at how old he looks. Some gray hairs, his posture straight and strong.
Over Cas’ shoulder, the glide of the Impala into the parking lot catches Dean’s attention. He holds his breath, caring less about his past self walking through the door only feet away from them—and he’s lending his past self a hand now, Cas has to be using his angel mojo to make them invisible for him not to notice this—and more to the warm hand pressed over his mouth. The palm is smooth, uncalloused from Jimmy Novak’s lifetime of education and radio jobs. So different from his own which are marred by gun callouses and scar after scar from tests to prove his identity.
“So, this potion—the
“I love you too,” Cas said finally, and it was all Dean needed. He reached over the divide, grabbed the chain of Cas’ grace, and yanked, their lips colliding in the middle less like a kiss and more like a punch, filled with every emotion Dean had ever held towards Cas that he had forced himself to hide.
Once, when helping Sam study for a test, he’d read about a man who’d been in an accident—something happened to his brain—and that man lost the ability to make memories and so had to leave his family to be protected by strangers, scientists. He couldn’t remember anything about his new life, everything he had was from before, but he was able to form muscle memory despite having no knowledge of how.
Dean smiled, and braced himself for the voice the same way he once braced himself for the flap of wings.
“Apologize,” Cas clarifies.
That’s what Dean wants to do, he wants to reach forward and just
The lights burst. The overhead lights, the lamps, even the counter lights in the kitchen, all shattered, glass flying everywhere. Dean tucked his head under his arms, bracing himself, but nothing ever hit him. When he looked back up, in the small light available, he could see it bouncing off the glass that had stopped in a perfect circle around him. By now, the back-up generator should have come to life with a steady hum, but the bunker remained silent and dark. Dean felt cocooned in the night.
Why does he want to rescue Cas? It’d be easier to list why he doesn’t because he wants, more than anything, to have Cas back. Since the second Cas disappeared on him he wanted him back he wants him
After an amount of time, which could be either an eternity or five minutes, he comes to a crossroads. Continue on this path or walk on a new ring. (And that’s what it is, right? Rings?) The tugging in his chest pulls harder, like a little kid dragging him somewhere new.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas apologized.
A snort ripped its way out of Cas, and Dean’s eyes widened in surprise; he’d never heard Cas laugh like that.
“I’m dreaming.” It wouldn’t be the first time he had had too much to drink and started seeing things. Hell, it wouldn’t even be the first time he had hallucinated Cas.
“Was that okay?” Dean asked.
The protesters were still there, and away from the safety of the Impala he could hear just how loud they were. For a moment, the noise of their microphones combined with the honking of cars speeding past almost overwhelmed him, but Cas kept walking until he stood directly in front of the man holding the microphone.
Movement refocused Dean on the house. Sam had aged some, grey hairs growing in around his temples and new wrinkles on his face. Dean was too far away in the Impala—though his eyesight seemed to have sharpened since Earth—but he thought that those new lines might even have been from smiling too often, an affliction Sam hadn’t had before.
He crosses towards the nearest post and scans the fliers, hoping for some indication of his spot in space and time. A concert poster for some band he’s never heard of (and what kind of name is The Cab anyways?) says that they’re playing tonight at 9pm, April 2, 2009.
“We have to finish this set, Cas. Only way to break Rowena’s spell.”
They were still standing in the dark. Dean, and the family he had built around him. There were steps to come, with a floor filled with sharp objects being the most pressing concern. But for once in Dean’s life, there was nothing weighing him down.
Sick of pacing around the room, Dean ventures towards the doorway, guessing that the vending machines at places like this aren’t the sturdiest and he could probably just kick a drink out of it.
Cas nodded.
to Dean the way no one else has. He likes to watch trashy TV and he never fully understands Dean’s pop culture references and he’s always willing to indulge Dean and do movie night with him, even when Dean spends half the movie making sure Cas is paying attention to the right parts and Cas always already is.
As he closes the door behind him, he can hear Chuck rehearsing his lines, saying the same phrase over and over again until the words lose all shape and melt into sounds, airwaves with no direction or meaning.
Cas swallows hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down. There’s the sound of a scuffle inside the motel room, and Dean knows there’s not much time left.
Dean realized his mistake, and floundered. “He’d probably be out on some serial killer walking tour, or talking about how the sun is bad for your skin.”
“If you need my grace,” Cas says, each word carefully formed, “Then you need to get it yourself.”
What Dean says instead is, “Elvis rewrote the script. He’s doing an encore.”
“One bacon cheeseburger,” Dean orders, smiling. “I heard Oprah’s girlfriend said this place has the best ones in the nation so of course I have to check it out.”
In choosing Dean, Cas chose a better version of himself. Dean owes it to him to do the same.
“Dean,” Cas said, tilting his head to the side. “Even if I owned a thousand things, it would still be my most treasured possession.”
Dean tests the weight again, but it won’t budge, He’s pinned in place.
“What, is this not proof enough that I’m not interfering with the Heavenly game plan?”
The world is not so much white as it is the existence of every color at once. It’s not so much dark as it is the utter absence of everything, as if light isn’t even a twinkle in Chuck’s eye. Everything in sight swirls and spins around, like the spots that dance in his vision after hitting his head particularly hard on a hunt.
The edge of the table cuts into his wrist as he settles his hands on it, trying to ground himself. He shifts in his seat and his knee brushes against Cas’, and even through two layers he’s so warm. He’s always been so warm.
If Dean remembers correctly, he and Sam get a room and then fight about Lilith, his past self leaving to go park the Impala somewhere as a fuck you to Chuck. Plate cleared, he stands up and stretches his legs, smiling at the waitress in acknowledgment on his way out.
Dean blanched. “Of course not,” he said, walking over to the table and pulling out a chair. The table was small, barely more than a card table, and his knees were nearly brushing against Cas’. Knowing Rowena, that was intended. Dean cleared his throat, and scooted back a few inches until he could no longer feel Cas’ heat through his clothes.
Cas answered before Dean could think of a response. “I love how when someone makes you feel something very deeply you can’t even bear to look at them.”
Cas is quiet. The moment stretches on too long and Dean remembers the guidelines of the spell, how it’s for an angel on the precipice, still able to fall either way.
It’s once more a struggle to look at him. Dean hadn’t realized how Cas had let himself age alongside him until he laid eyes on him again, fresh off the Heavenly boat. This Cas is so willful, so determined to want to believe that Heaven is right even as doubt creeps in. Dean can see it even now, the doubt like ivy growing over him, nature reclaiming a long-abandoned house.
Six months. It’s been six months of Cas in the Empty, a place he once confessed to Dean was no more pleasant than Hell. This time there’s no annoying a cosmic entity out of death; Cas is trapped and telling by the way he looked at Dean in the dungeon, Dean doesn’t think he’s going to fight it. Not even Jack can help him, not skilled enough in his powers to be able to reach through.
“That’s not,” Dean stuttered, glancing down at the paper. The question faded; it counted. To clear the tension, Cas read the next question.
Someone just out of view must have done something, because Sam doubled over in laughter before crossing over and out of the frame, into an area of the house Dean couldn’t see. What was left was the empty dinner table, brown and reminiscent of the very table he and Sam had once carved their initials in to.
Then Cas came back, and Dean had been happy—been ecstatic, even—but Cas came back in a distinctly angel way. Annoying ancient cosmic beings was something Dean was familiar with, but he hadn’t even known the Empty was a place that existed, much less a being that could make death deals. He hadn't known how angels felt, hadn't known how Cas felt, and so he just kept it to himself. When the Empty had taken him again, and Cas came back again, Dean didn’t know what to do. It was terrifying to get everything you’ve ever wanted.
Dean wants to scream, every repressed emotion from either the past six months or the past 12 years fighting to get out.
The cool touch of a marble statue presses against Dean’s fingertips, memory resurfacing. The fire inside him is quickly replaced by ice, breaking off and spreading into his bloodstream.
“Of you leaving.”
It needs salt.
Logically, Dean knew that Cas already knew all of this, having touched his soul and rebuilt his body and all of that. Still, this felt new and achingly vulnerable. He steeled himself and looked back at Cas, and saw vulnerability reflected right back.
“Maybe you could try the CD Claire left in the car,” Cas said.
The part of Dean’s brain that likes to keep him alive warns him that his strategy has already worked, and if he keeps going forward like this he’s going to run off a cliff sooner or later.
“I don’t think I’ve ever sung to myself," Cas said. "To someone else? Nora’s baby, when I was human the first time.”
Dean nodded at him, and silent communication passed between the two. They both knew where this was going.
The mechanical hum of the Bunker fills the air, taking up space where Dean could not. It’s become a home when home was once only a memory, the smell of smoke lingering wherever Dean went the only proof that he had had one at all.
The hand on top of his own stilled and Cas’ shoulders fell. “Of course,” he said, and moved to remove his hand. Dean stopped him by tightening his grip, silently pleading with Cas to trust him. Cas’ hand relaxed, and he gave a short nod.
“Here.” Dean’s voice was hoarse and his face felt hot. “Blow on it, make a wish.”
What did friendship mean to Dean? Cas was his best friend, no doubt about it, but there was always something between them setting them aside. He recalled shamelessly geeking out with Charlie, something he hadn’t been able to do when he was young. He felt for a moment the kindness he had found in Donna, and the shared love of good food he had with Jody. Most of all, he remembered sitting side by side on recliners with Cas in the Dean Cave, simultaneously cursing himself and praising himself for not buying a couch. The art of watching something out of the corner of his eye was long practiced by Dean, and he barely ever ended up paying attention to the movie, instead admiring how the scenes flickered across Cas’ face. There was always a curious ache inside him, begging him to reach out and touch, like sunflowers turning towards the sun. Dean swallowed long and hard.
. Dean wonders if this Cas is thinking of that too.
“My turn,” Dean said, voice thin, and he braced himself by staring behind Cas’ head. He started with the fire, how even now he could recall exactly how hot it felt and his desperation to get out with his brother safe and sound. He went on to his year of silence, and how he didn’t quite understand what was going on, only he knew he’d never see his mom again. At that he choked up for a moment, before pressing on.
“You told us. And I’m not going to tell you more.” Dean leans against the wall, arms crossed. “Spoilers, you know?”
