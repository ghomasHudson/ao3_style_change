But how? Mycroft didn't answer him, instead John's voice cut through the tense silence. "You don't know everything yet. It would feel like... taking advantage of you, if you can't make a decision, based on all the relevant facts." Defeat and resignation coloured John's voice.
at the pub." John didn't have to elaborate that he was referring to the rapist of his sister. "It was a school reunion and there he was... Laughing and joking around. Flirting with women, who didn't know what a monster he was."
“You know,” she started, when they were all back to focusing on their tea again, “the younger people are much more open-minded than the ones of my generation.”
“Oh yes, they shun all other plants to get the nectar from them,” Martha agreed easily, preparing another plate with Swiss rolls.
"I was sick," Sherlock informed Donovan, as he swept past her in the lobby of the hotel. On any other day he would have pointed out to her how hypocritical it was of her to criticise him for not solving a case for them. After all, she was usually the most outspoken against him helping them with their police work.
"And where is the third cup then?" Sherlock didn't have to turn around to know, that Anderson had his arms crossed in front of his chest and was smirking triumphantly at his back. The cretin really thought he had thought of something, that Sherlock hadn't.
John's eyes softened to a tender blue. He reached his hand towards Sherlock, but aborted the movement at the last second and let it fall in the space between them. "Of course, I love you."
Blue eyes snapped up to his and Sherlock almost flinched away at the anger, that was swirling around in their depths. "They were rapists." The word dripped with disgust as John spit it out. "They were disgusting monsters, that needed to be stopped. Besides," Something dark flashed in John's eyes, "She dared to assault you. I swore to myself, that I would never let anyone get away with hurting someone I love, ever again."
“Speaking of the devil,” Martha muttered to herself, but plastered a smile on her face, before turning around to greet one of her neighbours. “Mrs Miller, what a pleasant surprise.”
"You love me?" Sherlock blinked at John in astonishment. Mycroft only sighed loudly in his Mind Palace and was probably wringing his hands, because Sherlock was focusing on the least important part of John's confession. Least important for someone like his brother, but not for Sherlock.
"I didn't know, how else to scare you out of your wonderings, on what John and I get up to in bed." Sherlock smirked. He could clearly imagine the crimson blush on Lestrade's face, while he threw on his clothes. "Now tell me about the case."
"We have a double homicide," Lestrade informed him as he ignored Sherlock's greeting. "A man and a woman. They were killed by a headshot."
, but he wasn't willing to engage in this mindless mating dance of the general public, anymore. He had given up on it years ago. Why should he bother, when most people lost their interest in him, as soon as they learned that he was transgender. And the few who weren't discouraged by it, soon realised, that they couldn't handle him. Obviously, rude behaviour, body parts in the fridge, stinking experiments and a fascination for crime scenes, were a deal breaker. For a second, he wondered if John would mind and then scolded himself an idiot. John was only making these remarks, because he was bored out of his mind, where he was crunched down in the bushes.
Sherlock could have spent hours just holding and being held by John and kissing him, until their lips were raw and dry, if it hadn't been for their difference in height. It was exhausting to bend down to meet John's lips and Sherlock was certain that his lover didn't fancy a stiff neck the next day. "Let's take this to the bed." Somehow they made it the last couple of steps to their destination without any major injuries - Sherlock didn't count the bruise on his shin - and tumbled onto the bed.
"Sleep well, Cuddle Bug." Sherlock only managed to smile against John's shirt, when his voice rumbled in his ear ,before his eyes fell shut. Tomorrow, he would forbid John to call him every stupid pet name under the sun, but for now it was kind of... nice.
It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining, the birds were chirping and the air was crisp and clear. In short, it was the perfect day to run a few errands and maybe have a chat with the nice chap from the butcher’s shop. Martha smiled to herself. The young folks of the village were absolutely lovely, the absolute opposite of the older – her own – generation.
, while they were both preparing for a long night of fantastic sex, after his lover had successfully killed another man. Life was strange, but Sherlock couldn't be happier with how it had turned out for him.
So what could he deduce? He wasn't in a hospital, but he was lying in a bed, with cheap, but soft sheets. Combining that information with the dusty air in the room and the faint noises, from the street below, brought Sherlock to the conclusion, that he was in someone's flat. A flat, that was located on the third or fourth floor of a building, that was located in the outskirts of London.
John sighed. It wasn't an angry sigh, but a slightly annoyed one. Sherlock had made sure to catalogue all of his lover's sighs in his Mind Palace, to judge his mood by them.
“It’s no big deal,” Martha smiled tightly and sighed in relief, when the cab turned the corner into the street. “I would move whole mountains to make them happy.”
Sherlock leaned forward to underline his words with a kiss, but was stopped by a hand on his chest. "John?" Rejection clenched at Sherlock's heart ,as his lover turned his head away. What was wrong now? They had both confessed their love to each other, so why was John refusing to kiss him? He hadn't had a problem with kissing him earlier in the kitchen.
"Ahem, no." The man shrugged, without a trace of apology on his face. "I added some tramadol drops to your water. It's usually not recommended when you have a head injury, but as I was there to watch you, the benefit was higher than the risk. You should be completely pain free in a short while."
Of course, it was raining today. Martha sighed and shifted her umbrella to prevent her clothes from getting wet. She hadn’t spent two hours, carefully selecting her wardrobe, to have it ruined by the unpredictability of the English weather, now.
"No." It was an easy answer. Sherlock had expected John to massage him, but he certainly didn't mind if his lover wanted to kiss him first. No matter where John intended to put his lips.
"Anything?" Sherlock turned to Lestrade and opened his mouth to deliver his deductions, but stopped himself at the last moment. If someone close to the victims of the siblings had killed them, as revenge for their crimes, then Sherlock didn't see why he should push the police on their track. God knew that Valentine and Michael had got what they deserved. Nevertheless, he could solve another case for Lestrade. Maybe it would help some of the victims to work through their trauma, if they learned that their rapist was dead. "You should show the picture of Ms. and Mr. Valentine to the victims that have been raped. I am sure ,they will identify him as their rapist and her as someone who showed friendly interest in them ,during their stay at this very hotel."
So, he wanted to play dumb? Or did he just want to hear, how Sherlock had figured it out? How cliché, but maybe this would buy Sherlock enough time, to come up with a plan for escape... or Mycroft would locate his phone and safe him. At least owning his brother a favour, would be better than the alternative.
"It's fine," he assured his friend hoarsely, when John made to get up, to help him. And then, because Sherlock's mouth was sometimes even faster than his mind, he blurted out: "You can move in with me."
Sherlock grinned, as Lestrade clenched his teeth in obvious annoyance, but didn't bother to fire back an insult. Coupled with the dark rings under the DI's eyes, his crumpled shirt and the new strands of grey in his hair, it was easy to deduce that the Yard was desperate for Sherlock's help. It had to be a good case then and probably a high profile one as well or Lestrade would have asked for his help much sooner.
A door started to rattle in his Mind Palace and before Sherlock could decide if he wanted to investigate what was behind it, it sprang open. There it was: John's room. For a second Sherlock couldn't see a difference, to the way it had looked before - the tapestry and the curtains still looked the same to him - but then he noticed all the tiny details, that had been added. His gun was no longer hidden between his jumpers, but lay prominently on top of his bed. Next to it were John's army fatigues and his dog tags. A cup of fine chinaware set on his nightstand. Sherlock didn't need to get closer, to know which tea it was filled with. Just like he didn't need to check the gun, to know that it was an army issued SIG. He had seen it before - of course - when John had shot the killer in the park, but somehow he hadn't made the connection back then. The truth had been hidden in his Mind Palace all along. Hidden away by himself from himself, until he was ready to face the truth. Honestly though, Sherlock didn't know if he was ready, but he was aware of it now and there was no way, that he would be able to delete that knowledge.
Finally, Sherlock reached for the massage oil and dribbled it on John's chest and belly, while moving further down his body. He rubbed the oil in John's skin and took extra care to massage his nipples, until they were perky and glistening. Sherlock wasn't particularly interested in having someone play with his own nipples, but John loved it, as his groans proved. And the thickening hardness in his pants was also a clear statement. Actually, Sherlock had planned on spending as much time on John's front, as his lover had spent on his back, but when he noticed the tip of John's cock peeking over the waistband of his pants he changed his mind. He kept one hand attached to John's right nipple, while he sent his other to a different destination.
then," John murmured, from somewhere next to the bed, because he obviously believed that Sherlock had spoken to him. "What about..."
By the time John finally plopped open the bottle of massage oil, Sherlock didn't believe that he could get even more relaxed. For once in his life he was wrong. When John's skilled fingers dug into his flesh Sherlock could practically feel the knots in his back unwinding. The sensation of the oil in combination with his lover's warm hands added to the overall relaxing experience. Overall relaxing, because a part of Sherlock was doing exactly the opposite. Blood was rushing southwards as the place between his legs started to pulse with arousal. The fabric of his pants already felt slightly damp and Sherlock was positive that he would ruin them completely, if John carried on like that. Embarrassment coloured his cheeks, as he hid his face in the pillow when John dug his fingers in the hard muscles of his thighs and he felt himself becoming even wetter.
"Are you lost in your Mind Palace again?" A retort was ready on Sherlock's tongue, when he noticed the soft smile on John's face. He wasn't mocking Sherlock, but was truly interested in the answer. The realisation was unsettling.
"I am in my own flat and I can very well walk around however I please. Besides," he threw over his shoulder, as he marched towards his bedroom, "It's not like you haven't seen me naked before."
"Are you doing this to make me laugh or because you can get away with calling me all kind of pet names today?" The soft fabric of his pyjama bottoms was a welcome sensation on his legs, when Sherlock put them on. Another yawn was forced from his throat and he laid back on the bed, even as he still looked at John in curiosity.
"Does your interest in kissing me mean, that we are still dating?" Sherlock cursed the wine for pushing the question past his lips, when John stared blankly at him. So much for not scaring him off.
“Thankfully, it’s just a trip to the city.” There was no need to clarify which city, she meant. After all, there was only one bigger town nearby, that deserved that description.
"Nothing to say to that, Freak. I am right, aren't I?" Sherlock huffed an annoyed breath, as he left the elevator with Donovan on his heels. "Firstly, I went to Oxford not Cambridge. Secondly, I prefer to administer drugs intravenously to destroying my nasal glands and thirdly," Sherlock smirked at the Sergeant, "Anderson has a date with his wife tonight. You could have left the condoms at home, if you don't intend to use them with someone else, that's it."
"And you invaded Afghanistan," Sherlock couldn't help, but point out and they both dissolved into laughter. It only lasted, until Sherlock winced in pain though and grabbed his head. Laughing while concussed apparently wasn't a good idea.
Sherlock didn't even try to hide the hurt at the betrayal from his lover. He had worried that John wasn't interested in him anymore and was only working so much to spend as little time with him as necessary and here... his lover had been planning a murder.
Relief washed over him and Sherlock nodded to all of John's requests and threw back the covers. As long as he got to clean himself, it didn't matter to him if he took a shower or a bath.
"You are very eager, aren't you?" Sherlock couldn't tell if Valentine really believed this nonsense or if she was merely mocking him. It didn't matter in the end, as she straddled him and tore at the buttons of his shirt. Time seemed to skip and her hands were caressing his bare chest a second later.
Sherlock let his eyes wander farther through the room. He noted a khaki uniform and scrubs, next to woollen jumpers, under which a gun lay hidden. A smile flickered over Sherlock's face. How fitting of his mind to decorate John's room like this. Never mind, that Sherlock still didn't know, when or why it had been added to his Mind Palace. His feet carried him to the bed. A teddy sat on top of the perfectly made sheets. It was wearing a jumper and scowling warningly. A sense of danger radiated from it, but when Sherlock touched it, he only felt warm and protected. Maybe this was where this stupid thought had come from. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the teddy, even as he held him close to his chest. He should probably think of a way to delete it and the feelings it symbolized, but Sherlock couldn't bring himself to do it. Not yet anyway. Maybe later, when...
"I am not ashamed." He ignored the disbelieving laugh that sounded from Mycroft, in his Mind Palace and continued: "If I report Ms. Valentine - that's the name she used at the hotel - to the police, I will have to tell them everything. And even if they keep it secret by sheer luck, everything will come to light if the case goes to court."
"That's sick." John's words echoed Sherlock's own thoughts, but he still didn't look up and only mourned the loss of contact, when the hand fell from his shoulder. A second later the hand was back though. "Tip your head back and close your eyes. I am going to wash your hair, Muffin."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and let his sheet fall to the floor, before he turned towards his bedroom. At least, that got Lestrade's attention and he sputtered behind him. "You can't just... Sherlock, it's not decent to..."
“Would you like to order something else?” The young waiter smiled politely at Martha, who declined with a headshake. “Not yet, my boys will be here soon. We’ll order then.”
“And you don’t have to, love.” Martha sighed happily at the sight of her boys kissing each other gently. She couldn’t be happier for them.
Sherlock put his head back on the pillow and allowed his body to relax as John's mouth found its way down his spine, only to lick a long strip back up again. Goosebumps broke out all over Sherlock's body and a content sigh fell from his lips as John took a moment to suck on his earlobe before kissing his way back down. He pressed a kiss to each clothed cheek and then - to Sherlock's surprise - spent a long time exploring each of his legs with his lips as well.
The annoying voice of his brother was probably right about that. Any sane person would worry about having their lover exposed as a murderer, but Sherlock... Well,
The mere idea made Sherlock shudder despite the warm water, but John still didn't seem to understand. "What will come to light?"
"I know this is hard," John murmured and his gentle voice did wonders to soothe Sherlock's nerves, "But I need to know what happened. I called Lestrade last night and he told me about the case." John paused and Sherlock frowned slightly. Both at the fact that Lestrade had shared secret information with John and at the time specification. "Yes, you were out for a good fourteen hours. It's eight in the morning now."
The man furrowed his brow. "You were spot on about my past in the army, my injury and that I am a doctor, but... I am not killing people. Oh and," he added with a chuckle, "I was in Afghanistan. Amazing really, Mr. Holmes."
“Where are you going, my dear? I hope it’s not another doctor’s appointment.” If Martha didn’t know her neighbour so well, she would have even bought her false concern.
"You know," John interrupted their quiet routine as he reached between Sherlock's legs to layer his curls in foam, "I never thought it would be like this."
"Thank you," Sherlock whispered, as he spooned up behind John with his lips pressed to the ear of his lover. "I know, you had something else in mind and..."
"I won't be," Sherlock assured John, with more certainty than he himself felt. There was no way he could tell, how his body was going to react to John's presence. Still, Sherlock would be damned if he allowed this woman to come between John and him. He had only just found his Watson and he wasn't going to lose him over something like that.
"Go ahead and use the toilet. I will take care of the bath." Sherlock's head snapped up, to meet the understanding eyes of his lover, before John turned his back to him to fumble around with the tap.
"So you are well again?" Sherlock frowned at the question, but then recalled that John had made up a story of Sherlock having a bad case of migraine, brought on by some drugs, that someone had slipped him at a bar. It was almost frightening how easy an DI was fooled these days.
"I wouldn't mind," Sherlock replied. There were only a few activities that sounded more alluring than kissing his lover for hours on end.
"Not yet," John admitted subdued. "I got the job, but I won't start working there for another month."
Upon arrival, Sherlock became aware of another pressing need. His bladder was screaming for him to use the toilet and new heat rose in his cheeks, as Sherlock pressed his legs together. On any other day, he would have either thrown John out of the room or just gone ahead with using the toilet, but today he was unsure on how to proceed. He didn't want to leave his lover's side, as irrational as this was, but he also didn't feel comfortable with using the toilet under John's watchful eye.
"Don't be stupid. I won't leave you alone." The words sent warmth rushing through Sherlock's body. He was suddenly glad, that he had his back to John or the doctor might have noticed his blush.  How juvenile to blush at such a simple statement. It wasn't like John had confessed his undying love and attraction to him. Not that this would ever happen... and where did that thought even come from?
John waved Sherlock's words away. "I don't have much. As long as there is a bed and a wardrobe in the room, I will be fine."
"Sick?" Donovan sneered as he followed him to the lifts. "You probably met up with some of your posh friends to snort cocaine, like all the good Cambridge boys."
John snorted in amusement, at that. "I’m not sure, that you can decide that. Even if I won't be convicted, the police will certainly take me into custody. I just killed a man after all."
“They are… what? How?” John’s eyes were wide with shock, while Sherlock looked quietly out the window.
Sherlock couldn't say where he had gone wrong, with his deductions, but it didn't make sense for this man to be the criminal, he was looking for. There was no reason, why he should have given him his phone, otherwise. Maybe his bad judgement could really be blamed on his concussion.
There he was again, telling Sherlock what he had to do and although he was right, Sherlock resented him a little for it.
It spoke volumes of how shaken Mrs Miller was, that she didn’t even think of a retort, but numbly followed Martha into the living-room and accepted a glass of sherry. With a relieved sigh, Martha sat down herself and sipped from her glass, waiting for her neighbour to start talking. Minutes passed, but finally the sherry brought some colour back to Mrs Miller’s cheeks and she haltingly shared her news. “Mr Andrew, he ran out onto the street, just like that, like a lunatic. He was hit by a car and died on the way to the hospital.” Mrs Miller took another swallow of her sherry. “Mr Taylor, apparently he suffered a heart attack and his wife… the poor soul, fell down the stairs, in her hurry to get to the phone. The neighbours found them, when they hadn’t brought in their newspaper by noon.”
His own grin spread to John's face, even as his lover tried to look serious. "Yes, it was amazing how much smoother everything went, after you took over the stalking and planning part of the job. You really are a genius." A quiet giggle escaped John. "Listen to us. Other couples recall their first date when they shower together and we talk about killing people."
“That might be, but it doesn’t change the fact, that the old folks still dictate how the village is run,” John pointed out and then shuddered. “I still have nightmares about Mr Andrew with his pitchfork.”
“But we’re the last of the elders,” Mrs Miller insisted. “All the others, they are much younger. I know that day would come, but I never thought it would arrive so fast. Over the last two years, all the others have died. Without us, who will prevent the wrong people from moving here?”
Revisiting the events of yesterday evening hadn't helped at all, to bring Sherlock closer to figuring out what was going on with John. He only knew that it meant something, that John was spending so much time away from the flat and that he hadn't wanted to sleep with him when Sherlock had initiated it.  There was something... Something niggling at his mind. He often got that feeling when the answer to a problem was hidden somewhere in his Mind Palace, but without him finding the way to its location. It was frustrating.
“Nothing could keep me from seeing you, boys.” Martha regarded them fondly and signalled the waiter that they were ready to order. “Now tell me, what’s new?”
He managed to climb out of the bathtub and was wrapped in a soft towel, before he had even the slightest chance to feel self-conscious. Sherlock glanced at John who was busy - or pretended to be so - with rinsing the bathtub, while he dried himself. Suddenly it was easier to speak what was on his mind, to the back of his lover than to his face. And although Sherlock hated himself a little for his own cowardice, he still used the opportunity.
"Seems like part of you agrees with me, Cupcake." Sherlock barely managed to find the energy to roll his eyes, even as he allowed John lead him back to the bedroom.
“You really think that your honey solves everything, Mrs Hudson, don’t you?” Some of the old, cruel spark was back in Mrs Miller’s eyes, but Martha didn’t let it bother her, making her way to the kitchen with a smile. “Yes, I most certainly do.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest against the insults, but kept it close, when he noticed how John's shoulders sagged and he nodded in acceptance, at Lestrade's words. Great, now he had two people, that would nag him about being more careful. If they met up with Mycroft, they could have a chat over tea.
"Then what is it?" John snuggled more comfortably against Sherlock and pressed a kiss to his temple. "Tell me, please."
"To Baker Street," Sherlock told the driver of a taxi he had just hailed. He was determined to solve this mystery, as soon as he got home.
The water had just boiled and the tea set to brew, when the shower was shut off. John had taken ten minutes longer to shower than usual. Another difference to his routine. And if Sherlock added the fact, that John was home much earlier than usual - three hours earlier to be precise - then there were already three discrepancies. He didn't get the chance, to wonder what that meant - if it meant anything at all - when the door to the bathroom opened and John stepped into the kitchen, a few seconds later. He was clad in his favourite dressing gown and his hair was still wet and sticking up in all directions.
of me, because I wasn't aware that you were preparing to kill someone. But," Sherlock furrowed his brows. "You had already killed many men before and you didn't have a problem with sleeping with me."
Sherlock only listened half-heartedly to Mycroft's reasoning, as he tried to come up with a way to tell John that he didn't have to worry about touching him, like usual.
"Such a beautiful thing! I will ride you till you scream." Valentine's hands moved to his zipper. "Maybe I will use some of Michael's toys on you afterwards. I am sure, I can keep you for some time, before you are missed."
Now, I'm really curious what you think, after reading this chapter. *bounces on her feet* Let me know if the twist came as a surprise or not. ;)
Sherlock winced, as the words fell down between them. He waited for John to laugh at him, for such a stupid assumption. Or worse, for his newfound friend to get angry and proclaim, that he was straight and not interested in men. It would only be more hurtful, if John announced that while he was into men, he wasn't interested in Sherlock, because he was transgender. Not that John wouldn't find more reasons, that spoke against being with Sherlock, but this one sounded the most likeliest. After all, his friend hadn't heard him torturing on his violin, in the middle of the night yet.
"It's either in the bathroom, because the killer cleaned it of any evidence or he took it with him to clean it somewhere else and dispose of it later. I assume the latter. Our man wouldn't risk leaving any evidence behind, just because he was in a hurry to get out."
Sherlock considered his words for a second. He could call Lestrade and present him the murder suspect, but that would mean losing John and that was the last thing Sherlock wanted to happen. They had only met a little more than a month ago, but already Sherlock couldn't imagine life without his lover anymore. He suspected he would even miss the stupid pet names, that John tried to stick to him if he were to send his lover to prison.
Sherlock blanched. He hadn't thought of that. Why hadn't he thought of that? And why did it come as a surprise, now, when he had - falsely - believed himself in the hands of the murderer, for some time now?
"Doctor John Watson," he informed the DI in a clipped voice, that Sherlock had never heard from him, "I moved in with Sherlock, after he was attacked by a serial killer and needed medical attention, which I provided."
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully. When he had first got the idea to how they could work together, he hadn't even dared to dream, that it would be so... perfect. Especially not after John had at first refused to even consider it. Thankfully, it had only taken until reports about attacks at the park had made the rounds, for John to give in.
Sherlock sneered at the words of his brother. That was exactly, what the real Mycroft would say. He wouldn't understand, why Sherlock was dreading this conversation with John. In his mind everyone of lesser intellect wasn't of more importance than a goldfish. He would probably laugh at Sherlock, if he learned that his little brother was afraid of losing John and tell him that he was exchangeable. But that wasn't true. There was no one like John, Sherlock was certain of it and if he was to lose him on top of everything else that had happened today, then...
“Really? I wouldn’t venture there, if it wasn’t an emergency. And even then,” Mrs Miller shook her head in disgust, “I would think twice about it. In our youth, it might have been a nice destination for an outing, but nowadays it’s been overrun by rabble.”
"Does the flat have two bedrooms?" Sherlock's heart sank at the question, but he still answered truthfully. "Yes, it has two bedrooms. Though, I fear I have already claimed the larger one for myself."
"You can fill me in, on the most interesting details, while I get dressed," he told Lestrade, who still looked flabbergast, at the display of affection, he had just witnessed.
"Awake, I see!" The words, spoken in the well-known voice had the effect of a déjà vu on Sherlock. At least this time, he knew that he was safe with John. He tried to smile, but it slipped from his face as he noticed the look in his lover's eyes. There was anger in them. A lot of anger and it was directed at Sherlock.
Sherlock didn't point out to John, that he had already tried out one pet name that day. He blamed it on the danger of getting shampoo and water in his mouth. It certainly had nothing to do with the way John's skilled fingers started to massage his scalp. "That's it, Sugar. Relax."
Sherlock mumbled in protest at the pedestrian endearment and kept his eyes closed. He had told John right away, that he didn't like pet names, which obviously had been a mistake. Now it seemed as though his lover was set on finding the one endearment, that Sherlock wouldn't hate. It was a complete waste of time, as Sherlock had told him numerous times, but his words had fallen on deaf ears. Obviously John was as stubborn as Sherlock was brilliant, therefore he would have to endure a new pet name each day forever... or until John's vocabulary ran out.
"Both." Sherlock smirked, even as he agreed to solving six cases, of his brother's choosing, before he pocketed his phone once more. "He will tell you that he holds a minor position in the British Government, but he actually is the British Government."
"Yes, but," John rubbed his neck with his hand nervously, "I know it will sound stupid, but to me this wasn't much different from someone having a lot of relationships, before they meet someone they love. It doesn't influence their love, but going back on the promise to myself, not to kill someone again, felt like cheating on you."
"Almost done, Precious." The bottle of the conditioner was opened and John's fingers worked their magic again. "Now, let's get you out of there."
Light blue eyes only blinked at him in confusion. "Let's just imagine for one second, that I’m the killer - which I’m not - then why shouldn't you be my type? You said yourself that his victims are young and handsome. You’re certainly both."
Sherlock wiped his suddenly sweaty hands on his trousers, while he waited for John to reply. His friend was worrying his lower lip between his teeth and frowned down at his plate. God, but he had ruined it, hadn't he? Sherlock took another swallow of his wine, as his hope shrunk with each passing second. His offer had come much too soon. He should have waited until at least their third date, before inviting John to live with him. Just because Sherlock was sure, that he wanted John in his life, didn't mean that his new friend saw it the same way. Interest in dating didn't necessarily translate to commitment. A lot of people only dated for fun, without wanting anything more serious. They certainly didn't move in together, before they hadn't tested if they were compatible in bed.
Sherlock grabbed the armrests of his chair in fury at the memory of the incident at the hotel, ten days ago. After that
“To bees?” John echoed his partner’s words disbelievingly, but then shrugged. “Oh, why not, they’re extremely useful after all. To bees.”
"God, you... Come here!" Their lips met over wine, dumplings and soya sauce, as they leaned over the table, to claim their first kiss. It only lasted long enough for Sherlock, to get a taste of John, that made him crave even more, before they pulled apart.
“As I said, admirable. Just be careful,” Mrs Miller leaned closer, to whisper into Martha’s ear, when the cab pulled up at the kerb, “they have
"I... we..." Sherlock got the chance to collect his thoughts, when the waiter brought their drinks. "We will take a plate of assorted starters for two and..."
"I love you, too." The words were so easily spoken, that Sherlock wondered why he hadn't used them sooner. It was the simplest and most beautiful truth: He loved John Watson.
"It's alright."  Despite his words, there was a tight note to John’s voice and Sherlock didn't dare reply, as he shuffled slowly to the bathroom with his lover's help.
"We checked with the room service. They really ordered tea for three. You were right." Sherlock ignored both the impressed undertone in Lestrade's voice and the annoyed huff from Anderson, as he cocked his head to the side, to deduce more about what had happened here today. The killer had forced them to have tea with him, so it was likely to assume that he was British or had lived long enough in Britain to pick up such habits.
“Yes, I do, sometimes. So what?” Sherlock shrugged. “It’s not like we can ever move back, there. They made it damn clear, what they thought of us living together and I, for my part, don’t intend to go back to hiding who I’m, to make some bigots happy.”
"Ah now I remember," John's voice crackled, in Sherlock's ear, "I was worried, that you would get yourself killed, with this idiotic stunt."
Sherlock almost asked why they were still working on that case, before he bit his tongue as he remembered that the police didn't know about the dead suspect. They couldn't close the case, because Mycroft had made sure that there was no evidence left of what had happened to the murderer. Obviously though, Sherlock had been wrong when he had deduced that one and the same man had been responsible for all the crimes committed. Either that or the forensics had made a mistake, which was too farfetched an assumption. Nevertheless, the case sounded intriguing if only for the weapon that had been used.
“Ah, I envy you.” Mrs Miller straightened her hat, with a meaningful look at Martha’s bare head. “It must be nice to have time for a pleasure walk. I wish I could just walk aimlessly around town, without having to worry about the flower arrangements for our church or everyone’s contribution for the spring festival.”
"Better," Sherlock admitted to his own surprise. The throbbing in his head had been reduced to a manageable level and the gears in his mind started to turn again. "This wasn't just Ibuprofen you gave me."
“Of course, Mrs Hudson.” John’s reassuring smile never reached his eyes and Martha reached out to take his hand, as well. Her boys might not believe it, but she knew that one day, they would all sit around her kitchen table, just like that, without having to fear her neighbours.
"Stop it!" The words were commanding, but the hand that enclosed his wrist was gentle. Sherlock blinked down at his hand, where his own fingernails were digging in the flesh of his chest.
"Sherlock?" John stroked the back of his hand gently with his finger. "Did I say something wrong? Oh God," John's eyes widened in panic, "I just assumed that you would want to kiss me. I didn't even ask if that's something you enjoy."
Sherlock didn't get the chance to argue with either Mycroft or John, because steps on the staircase announced a visitor, to their flat.
"Then that's settled." John took a sip of his wine and Sherlock found his gaze drawn to his lips. Would he get to kiss them tonight? They had agreed that they were on a date and kissing was an essential part of dating, as far as Sherlock knew.
Sherlock clenched his hands into the sheets, to stop them from trembling. It wasn't the first time that someone had insulted him like this. It wasn't even the first time, that the insult had been a result of someone finding out that he was transgender. And yet, it had affected him more than ever.
"When I was sent home, I didn't know what to do with myself. I might have shot myself if I hadn't met...
John didn't deny the accusation. Neither did he pale or try to run, but he merely sighed and nodded in confirmation. "I should have known that you would figure it out. What gave me away?"
"Sorry, I should have thought of the light before." Sherlock turned his head in the direction of the voice. His host was sitting on a chair, next to his bed and looked at Sherlock with an apologetic smile. "How are you feeling?"
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest such an absurd statement but closed it again with a snap when he couldn't come up with a good counter. The truth was that even when John was at home he wasn't inclined to spend much time with Sherlock. Oh, they still ate dinner together and watched a movie afterwards but it still felt like something was between them all the time. It wasn't like it had been...
"If it's alright for you, it's alright for me." John leaned forward and gave a peck to Sherlock's lips.
"I am not sure that still qualifies as washing." Sherlock smirked at how breathless John sounded and pushed just the tip of his index finger inside, to provoke a moan from his lover. "It most certainly does. I have something planned after all." He crouched down behind John to press an open mouth kiss to his right cheek to make his intentions clear.
"When did you move in?" Lestrade addressed John this time, as he stepped up to them. "I am Detective Inspector Lestrade, by the way."
"Bloody hell!" The light caught in the silver strands of Lestrade's hair, when he shook his head. "You mean you really are together? Not just as flatmates or friends, I mean, but you are..."
“Oh, that’s a shame.” Sighing John reached for a cherry scone. “Next time you make some then. If we move in across the street, we’ll even be able to help you with it.”
Carefully, Sherlock took the two steps to the toilet and sighed in relief, when  he sat down and let go of the pressure in his bladder. The sound of the water filling the bathtub drowned out any other sounds and Sherlock felt himself relax. Usually, he wasn't shy about his bodily functions, but right now he was glad that John's back was turned to him, while he peed. There was probably some psychological explanation for his feelings, but Sherlock didn't intend to look for it. There were enough other things he had to worry about. The case still wasn't solved and Lestrade didn't know about what had happened the other night. Therefore, it was likely that the DI would call around again to ask for Sherlock's help... and for details of what had happened.
"You know," John whispered with a cheeky grin as he laid down next to Sherlock on his side, "I could spend hours just kissing you." He underlined his words with a sound smack to Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock crossed his arms in front of his chest and drew the sheet tighter around his body, in the process. "That's what I just said. Do keep up. Now, back to the case..."
"Is that alright?" John asked as he sat down on Sherlock's bum with his legs to each side of Sherlock. "I am not too heavy."
"And this was just as good, if not better." John turned his head far enough to peck Sherlock's lips with his own. "Maybe next time though you would like to wear a G-string. I missed playing with your plush arse."
"God, Sherlock. Do you always have to do that?" Lestrade pressed a hand against his chest and glared at him. "I will suffer a heart attack, one of this days."
The bell rang, just after Martha had sat down with a nice glass of sherry for the evening. With a sigh, she got up to open the door.
Sherlock gaped at John. He had known of course that his lover had been angry at the police for leaving him alone, when he had played bait for the killer, but he hadn't been aware of the depths of this anger.
It was either his imagination or the Mycroft, in his Mind Palace, had just made a very vulgar innuendo. Whatever it was, Sherlock found himself inhaling sharply and coughing a second later, when he choked on his food. At least John would assume, that his blush resulted from his coughing fit.
"There is nothing to be ashamed of, Buttercup." Sherlock snorted at the ridiculous pet name, but let it go in favour of disagreeing with John.
"You shot him." John managed to nod and shake his head at the same time. "Not right away. I didn't have my gun with me. I met sure to meet him in the men's room and pretended to know him. He was drunk already and he didn't get suspicious when I invited him to come with me, to meet up with some
“Mrs Hudson,” John interrupted her gently, “I know you mean well, but I doubt that your neighbours would accept two homosexual couples and a single parent.”
"Well done," the stranger praised him and held a glass of water to his lips. Sherlock didn't need to be asked twice to drink. It certainly helped against the fool taste of vomit and stopped the burning in his throat. "Now, just take it easy for the next twenty minutes. You should feel a little better by then." Sherlock doubted that. Ibuprofen didn't seem strong enough, to even dim the pain in his head. Especially not the pills, that you got without a recipe and most people didn't have any others available at home.
""Wait a sec!" Lestrade stared at them both, like they had grown horns. "He," he pointed at John, "Lives here? With you?"
"What," Sherlock started as John licked a strip from one ribcage to the other. "Just mapping my way. Do you mind?"
Sherlock took a shaking, but it didn't do anything to calm him down. If anything, his panic only rose as he felt his chest constrict painfully, when he inhaled. Cold sweat was trickling down his back and his hands started to shake, where they lay useless in his lap. He couldn't do anything to stop this man. There was nothing in his reach, that he could use to defend himself and even if he had a knife at hand, Sherlock doubted. that it would be of any use. Not when he was still in pain and slightly disoriented.
Sherlock couldn't help the exasperated sigh, that fell from his lips, as Lestrade gestured between them, like the idiot he was, instead of just saying what he meant. "We just had sex last night, if that answers your question." Sherlock ignored both the embarrassed glare from John and the fierce blush in the DI's cheeks. "Can we talk about the case now?"
Sherlock barely managed to keep up the movement of his hands and mouth, as more blood rushed between his legs and made him throb with want. His arousal had built up for so long, that he was only a hair trigger away from coming. And God, did he want to come. He pushed back against John's fingers and his lover got the hint, increasing his pace and pressing his mouth so close to him, that it felt like John was eating him out through his pants. Sherlock could only hold on to John with his hands and lips, as he tripped over the edge. His legs shook with the power of his orgasm, as it washed through him.
They prepared their drinks in silence - a splash of milk for John and two spoonful of sugar for Sherlock - and then retreated to the couch. Sherlock frowned at how far away from him John chose to sit. Usually, at least their thighs were pressed together, but today his lover left almost enough space for a third person between them.
Sherlock couldn't even start to unravel this mystery now. Not when John was looking at him, with a suspicious look on his face. "Is your brother some sort of criminal mastermind or does he work for the Mafia?"
Sherlock almost splashed the tea all over himself at the last statement. John wanted to talk to him. This didn't sound good. Not in the light of recent events and not after Sherlock had promised John, that he would be careful, only to come home in such a state afterwards. Others had broken up with him over less.
Sherlock heard the question that wasn't voiced and nodded. "You can do so as well." He blushed at how weird it was of him, to want John's hands on him, but fear his eyes roaming over that part of his body.
"But John," Sherlock glared at the hideous jumper, in front of him, "Don't you understand? That man was the killer. He took my bait and..."
"Why?" At that John looked up at Sherlock with a sad, but tender smile on his face. "Because I didn't want to draw you into this mess. I was already falling for you at that point and I couldn't go on hunting rapists, when I wanted to build a life with you. Besides," John's lips twisted into a weird grimace. "I assumed that you could easily catch such men and make sure that they would be locked up forever."
He flinched when the man reached a hand towards him, but it was only to gently touch his forehead. "You don't appear to have a fever, but I am worried about your illusions. I didn't think, that your concussion was that bad, but..."
Sherlock wondered if there was any way to make his brother sound less superior and annoying, in his Mind Palace, but dismissed the idea a second later. For that, Mycroft would have to be less annoying in real life. World peace would be achieved, before his brother would even start of thinking to change his attitude towards him.
"No," Sherlock interrupted him and peeled one eye open to look at his lover, "We agreed that you could only try one pet name each day."
Mycroft assured Sherlock in his Mind Palace, but he wasn't convinced by it. It was just as likely that John was angry at his attacker as that he was angry at Sherlock, for endangering himself so carelessly. Usually, Sherlock would have tried to figure out which it was, but right now he had more pressing matters to take care of. There was still the feeling of unwelcome fingers touching him everywhere and it made his skin itch so badly that he felt like tearing it away.
"The one that was also a rapist?" There weren't too many serial killers lose in London, but Sherlock still wanted to make sure.
"I am aroused, too." John's voice stopped Sherlock from mentally berating himself. He gasped when John lowered himself lightly on top of him and an unmistakable erection pressed between Sherlock's cheeks. "Does it bother you?" Sherlock shook his head against the pillow and grabbed John's arm to prevent his lover from even thinking of getting up. He liked the weight of John on top of him. It grounded and aroused him at the same time.
He blinked rapidly. His mind was working as fast as possible, to figure out what had just happened, while he had been wandering through his Mind Palace. Absolutely stupid, Sherlock scolded himself, as he looked at the man lying on the ground, only a few feet away from him. Shot to the neck, still alive, but approximately dead in the next thirty seconds.
Christ, Sherlock took a large swallow of the wine, how had he got to this point? Not even a week ago, he had believed that he would always be on his own. And now, he wasn't only sharing a meal, with a man, who had proclaimed himself to be Sherlock's friend, but who was also interested in dating him. To top it all off, said man had also just shot someone to save his life and giggled over a dead body with him. Years ago, Sherlock would have believed that he was suffering from drug induced hallucinations ,but he was clean. He hadn't even smoked in the last couple of weeks.
“Your bees are very fond of your rhododendrons,” Sherlock remarked casually, putting the cherry scones, that had set to cool by the oven, onto a plate.
Sherlock accepted the information with a nod, but didn't find it in him to say anything else and John continued.  "So I know that you were after a rapist and I know that you were drugged and," he gulped painfully, but carried on, "obviously someone undressed you... Touched you. Did... did he rape you?"
"And you didn't know him well enough, to conclude that he would still do it?" John's eyes grew hard as steel. "But if he baited the killer, in his own free time, then Scotland Yard wouldn't be at fault, right? Nice way to get rid of any responsibility, you might otherwise have had."
This chapter contains explicit sexual content and lots of feelings. ^^ There is only an epilogue left now, which will be posted next week. Enjoy. :)
do it." Sherlock sprawled his hands over John's ribcage and nuzzled his wet hair with his nose. "I like how you smell when you get back home, after your work for the day is done."
"The Intercontinental. The victims are a Ms. Mary Valentine and her brother Michael Valentine. Sherlock are you still there?" Lestrade added when Sherlock didn't reply.
"That's why she started to drink." John only snorted at Sherlock's words. "No, she only started to drink, after the little fucker had been acquitted of the crime he had committed. They said that there wasn't enough evidence to proof that the sex hadn't been consensual." John slammed his mug on the table. Tea splashed everywhere.
"Calm down, Sherlock." A gentle, but insistent hand pushed him back, until he was leaning against the headboard with a pillow behind his back. "I know that you were drugged."
." John sneered in disgust. "I waited outside the pub for him. No one saw us together. We walked to my place, where I told him to wait downstairs while I retrieved my gun. I shot him in a back alley and walked away. Afterwards I waited days for the police to knock at my door, but no one came. Then I read about another rapist, that had gone free after ruining the life of a nineteen year old girl and I knew what I had to do." John laughed humourlessly. "I couldn't work as a surgeon anymore, but the army had taught me how to shoot and more importantly, how to collect information and wait patiently for the right time to shoot." John sighed and Sherlock bit down on his tongue, to suppress the urge to cut in with his deductions, as it was obvious that his lover wasn't finished yet. He was right.
"Because it looked like he was going to shoot you." John's eyes narrowed at him. "What the fuck were you even doing? You didn't react to anything I said. You didn't give me your assessment of the situation or any other fucking clue, as to how to proceed. So don't take it out on me, that I made a decision, based on the information I had."
"It's Ibuprofen. You have a concussion and I can only imagine the pain you must be in. Just take it." The pill was pressed harder against his lips and Sherlock relented. Either the man was telling the truth and there might be a slight improvement, to how he was feeling or... Well, he was in no state to fight anyway.
"Why did you shoot him?" Sherlock clenched his hands at his side, as he glared at John, as the doctor stepped up next to him.
"Of course," Sherlock splashed his tea all over the couch, as he gesticulated with his hands. "You didn't want to have sex with me, because you felt like you would - how did you put it -
“Heart failure, Doctor MacGill says, if you want to believe a Scot.” Mrs Miller pursed her lips and Martha refrained from pointing out that their doctor had never been to Scotland, in his whole life.
"Now, hold on," Lestrade sputtered and held up his hands, in a placating manner, "I told him that his plan was too dangerous and that we wouldn't do it. Hell, I forbade him from doing it."
John's shoulders stiffened at the question, but when he turned around his eyes were bare of any accusations. "I am not angry at you, Sherlock." Blue eyes looked openly at Sherlock and their owner shook his head. "I am angry, that you are right that almost everyone would define you by your gender identity, if they learned that you are transgender. I hate this and I despise these monsters, that forced you in this corner." Something dangerous flashed in John's eyes, but it was gone a blink later. "I will never hold it against you, that you want to protect yourself first. Don't ever think that." A tension, that Sherlock hadn't even been aware of left his body, at John's sincere words and he almost slumped against the washbasin.
"You freak! You fucking freak! You tempted me!" The shrieking tone of the voice tore through Sherlock's head. "Get out! You disgusting Thing! Get out!"
“I’m sorry, we’re late.” John hugged her with an apologetical smile, then gestured behind him at Sherlock. “He forgot the time over one of his experiments.”
Please, read the trigger warnings before starting on this chapter! If you can think of any more warnings, that apply, please let me know.
He heard John's answering laughter from the shower and grinned, as he turned the dryer on. Sherlock might not have dreamed up this life for himself, but he wouldn't give it up for anything in the world. Not as long as he had John in it - his perfect little killer.
Certainly his living arrangements or his love life couldn't be more interesting than whatever had brought Lestrade here, in the first place. For a second though, he almost feared that the DI would indulge in more chitchat, since he appeared amazed at the relationship between them. Thankfully, the moment passed and Lestrade seemed to remember, why he had come to Baker Street. "I have the folder in my car. When you are dressed, you can come with me and read it on our way to the Yard."
"Start blowing your hair or I won't blow you tonight!" Sherlock huffed out a laugh at that. "Smooth, John. Very smooth."
Sherlock merely rolled his eyes at the statement. They kept telling him that he was dramatic, but Lestrade was even worse. "You could reduce your risk of heart attacks by eating less donuts and cutting back on your coffee consumption. I also see that you have taken up smoking again. I assure you, that's putting you more at risk for heart attack than seeing me in a sheet."
And also the forensic scientist hadn't intended to, his comment helped Sherlock to ground himself in the present and get himself back under control.
"And if we soil the sheets of one bed, we can just move to the other one, without having to change them right away," Sherlock added out loud and was treated to a crimson blush, from John.
He was glad that the Inspector's back was to him or otherwise even Lestrade would have noticed the way Sherlock turned pale and swayed on his feet. His body still remembered what had happened in this very room. Panic rose in him, as adrenalin started to rush through his veins to allow him to fly the scene. Sherlock swallowed hard, when bile rose in his throat and leaned against the doorframe while he tried to get his heart rate back under control.
"Guy? What guy... Oh!" Sherlock only didn't hit the floor, as he tried to scramble out of the bed, because John caught him and pushed him back onto the covers. "You are not running off like that. Not that you could anyway, but I won't let you try."
Sherlock leaned back and looked closely at his lover. His shoulders were hunched. His head hung low and he had averted his eyes from Sherlock. His grip on the mug was so tight, that Sherlock feared he would break it. In short, John was afraid and yet he still carried on.
"What happened, Sherlock?" John looked almost frightened to hear the answer, even as he soldiered on. "I don't know if you remember, but you came home with a taxi. You didn't have any money on you and the driver was threatening to call the police, when Mrs. Hudson heard the tumult and called for me. You were drugged out of your mind."
A surprised chuckle fell from John's lips. "That's what's keeping you up? Three times, but don't expect this to become a habit. I am still exhausted from it."
"You’re kidding." Sherlock shook his head at John's disbelieving tone and gestured for them to move towards the exit of the park. "Not at all. He is probably going to kidnap you, in the next week, if you stay around me."
Sherlock's voice dripped with sarcasm, as he let his eyes sweep over the scene before him once more. The tea had been served, but neither brother nor sister had drunken from it. Some spillage on the table and the coaster spoke of shaking hands. Therefore the murderer had already revealed his weapon, when they had ordered tea. A planned murder then. The gun hadn't been a precaution during some dubious business negotiations, but had been brought here with the sole purpose of killing them both.
“Oh, Mrs Hudson, it’s horrible.” Mrs Miller’s hands clenched around a white handkerchief. “Mr Andrew, Mr Taylor and his wife, they are all… they are all dead.”
Yes, Sherlock mused as they continued their dinner, this was going to work. And he couldn't wait for tomorrow. He was sure that Baker Street would feel even more like home with John in it.
"And you were just drugged, not twenty-four hours ago. You need rest." Sherlock opened his mouth to argue, but all that came out was a loud yawn. Great, now his body was betraying him as well.
"It's a memory technique to sort and store important information," Sherlock explained and then sighed when his eyes flickered to the still body in the grass. "I could have interrogated him, if I had paid more attention."
The man was moving around the room. Sherlock heard the rustling of fabric and smelled cleaning agent, as his former accident was scrubbed away. Cold air hit him a second later, when the window was opened. It felt nice to breathe in fresh air, until he started to shiver, but before it became to unbearable the window was closed again. The next sounds indicated the closing of shutters and then... silence. Sherlock frowned and when the movement didn't send a jolt of pain through his head, he slowly blinked his eyes open. A relieved sigh escaped him, when he noticed that the room was dark, except for a dimmed lamp at the foot of his bed.
"A date consists of two people going out and having fun together," he still started carefully, to test the waters and took heart from John's encouraging smile, "I would say that the description fits us well."
"Have a nice day, Sergeant," Sherlock called over his shoulder, as he entered the crime scene after Lestrade.
“Definitely,” John agreed readily. “like all of them, but sometimes,” a wistful look entered his eyes, “I still miss it. Not the insults and attacks,” he added hastily, when Sherlock coughed quietly, “but it’s a beautiful village. I loved living there. You miss it, too.” John silently dared Sherlock to deny the claim with a pointed look.
Sherlock turned sideways, to watch as Lestrade held his hand out, for John to shake. To his surprise his lover didn't make any move to take the offered hand. Usually, John was telling Sherlock to be more polite, so why would he...
Sherlock barely remembered to wrap the sheet around himself, before he hurried towards the living-room to greet Lestrade. "I hope the case is interesting," Sherlock called out to the DI, as he rushed into the living-room, before Lestrade could so much as call for him.
“Apropos bees,” John remarked, after his third cucumber sandwich, “I would love to try your honey, would it be okay if I got some?”
Sherlock refrained from pointing out to John, that there wasn't much he could have done to help his sister. There was no guarantee even, that a therapy would have helped her, although it might have made a difference on the long run. Instead, he waited for John to continue his tale even though Sherlock already suspected where it would lead. Even Lestrade would have made the connection by now, if he had been given this information.
"No, that was brilliant!" John beamed at him and Sherlock's heart jumped in his chest at the sight. "Usually though, it's considered rude though to order for your date, without checking with them first."
Sherlock sneered inwardly. He wasn't afraid of a word, but he felt fear, indeed. Fear of... being raped and then killed. Sherlock would really prefer it the other way around. Not that he liked the idea of having his brains blown out, but he would prefer not to experience...
you found is of any worth whatsoever." Sherlock pushed himself away from the wall and walked into the room. It was helpful that it looked much different than the last time he had been here. The place wasn't only swarmed by forensic technicians and police officers, but there were also splatters of blood and brain tissues on the wall, the ceiling and the floor. At last Sherlock's eyes fell on the two bodies. They had obviously been sitting on the couch, when they had been shot. Michael's body was sprawled partly on the cushions, while Mary’s had fallen to the floor, after her brain had been blown out. Relief washed through Sherlock at the sight of her destroyed face and his body relaxed a little at the visual confirmation that she was truly dead. He didn't have to fear exposure from her anymore and he could also be sure that she would never get to assault anyone ever again. The same applied to her brother.
"Doubtful." Sherlock pursed his lips, when deductions about his host started to come in. He was shorter than him, although he couldn't say by how much, as long as they were both sitting down. His possession of prescribed pain killers suggested, that he had been injured himself and probably undergone surgery, not so long ago. He was older than Sherlock, but not by much, although the hideous jumper he wore suggested otherwise. All in all he appeared harmless, but...
"They had tea," Sherlock gestured to the fine chinaware on the table and the assortment of pastries, "Before they were shot."
Sherlock frowned as he licked into John's mouth and earned a moan from his lover. Indeed, John tasted like tea and not like the cheap stuff they served at his surgery, but like a much more expensive brew.
“Hello Mrs Miller. I’m waiting for my cab, but the driver appears to be running late.” Martha just hoped that the cab would arrive in the next few minutes. She had been looking forward to this outing and she didn’t want to give Mrs Miller the chance to ruin it for her.
“Very well, if you change your mind, feel free to let me know.” With another smile, the waiter turned away from her table.
"That will be all for the moment." John smiled at the waiter, before Sherlock could order anything else. "Let's see how hungry we still are, after the starters, before we order anything else."
"It's stupid," Sherlock muttered, but turned his head towards John, to peek at his lover with one eye. "I don't want to... take off my pants. I know it's absolutely irrational and that you have seen me without them before and..."
They had lost most of their clothes on the couch and around the living-room, before they had made it to Sherlock's bedroom. There, they had spent a couple of hours of pleasuring each other, before the need to clean up had driven them to the bathroom. Unnecessary to say, that their much needed shower had turned into yet another round of sex.
Sherlock cocked his head to the side and considered John's words as well as the man himself. He was probably right. It shouldn't be so easy, to brush the murder of these people aside. Anyone else would have called the police already or failing that, they would have thrown him out of their flat at least, but... Sherlock wasn't anyone else. If John had killed for fun or for money, it would have been a different matter, but Sherlock could understand his lover's reasons. Besides: "I am sure that Mycroft has killed more people - directly or by order - than you did and I still don't deny that he is my brother."
“That looks wonderful, Mrs Hudson.” John helped arrange all the plates on the table, but frowned when Martha held a champagne bottle out for him to open. “That’s not exactly proper for tea,” he remarked, but dutifully poured a glass for each of them.
"Right." John sounded sceptical and Sherlock sighed. "You don't have to stay, John. I understand, if you would rather go somewhere warm and..."
"Sally, that's enough." Lestrade glared at his subordinate and then gestured for Sherlock to follow him to the room.
A disgusted shiver ran down Sherlock's back and he only barely managed to turn over the side of the bed as he retched. Water and bile ended up on the floor, but Sherlock was too exhausted to care as he sank back into the mattress of his bed.
"Brilliant as always." John's lips twitched up. "I swore to myself that night that this would be the last one, I would kill."
"Well," Lestrade's voice sounded subdued even over the phone, "It's the same weapon that was used to kill the first few guys, but not the ones that were raped. Our forensic team just figured that out."
Mycroft sounded as annoyed as he would be in real. Sherlock sighed. He hadn't been able to answer this question completely until last night.
"God, we shouldn't giggle," John managed to get out after he had sobered again, but the happy gleam remained in his eyes.
"Because he is a pompous, meddlesome git not because he killed someone." Sherlock met John's wide eyed stare and tried to remain serious, but couldn't help the way his lips twitched upwards in a grin. A second later John's expression mirrored his own, before they both erupted in completely inappropriate giggles.
Fine, so there had been... a case. Yes, that sounded about right. Lestrade had come to beg him for help, because his stupid officers hadn't been able to connect the dots. There had been murders. For the last three months various men - of all ages and backgrounds - had been killed, with a single shot to the head. Naturally, the police hadn't found a connection between the victims. Until the murderer had changed his modus operandi and Sherlock had deduced, that he would be the perfect bait. That was, when he had decided to wander the streets, where the murderer was most likely to look for his next victim. And then...
A grin split Sherlock's whole face at the thought, before he could hide his reaction. It wasn't considered decent to feel happy about crimes, but instead of distaste Sherlock only detected fondness in John's gaze.
He still expected his new friend to ask him what kind of experiments he did and then was left to wonder, how often John would manage to surprise him, when his actual words reached Sherlock's ear. "And here I thought, I would get to shut you up with kisses, once in a while." John winked at him. "It appears that I will have to kiss you, until you feel like talking again."
How had this all gone so wrong? The question ghosted through Sherlock's head, even as he stumbled against a sideboard and sent a vase falling to the ground. The door, to the hotel room, seemed miles away, as he took an unsteady step while holding onto the wall for support. He needed to get out of here, before the drug knocked him out. If it had at least been something opiate based, Sherlock doubted that it would have such an effect on him. In the years, he had used drugs, he had built up quite a bit of resistance to them, but his body didn't have any defence against... date rape drugs.
"Christ, you..." John turned around hastily and Sherlock came face to face with his lover's half-hard cock. But before he could even get a taste of it, John had grabbed him under the arms and hauled him to his feet. "Get out."
“Oh, of course not, don’t be silly, my dear.” Martha patted his cheek fondly. “You can also look at some of the houses, here. The one across the street is for sale and I think it would be perfect for you.” Martha glanced critically at the sandwiches and wondered if she should make some more with cucumbers. “And I think the one down the street would be perfect for Molly, it has a large garden for her daughter to play in and Irene and her girlfriend could…”
His own words startled Sherlock out of his sleepy haze and his eyes snapped to John, who was sitting on the edge of the bathtub. There was still a tight line to his lips, but John didn't look angrier at Sherlock's announcement. Instead there was understanding in his gaze and Sherlock relaxed again. That was until John spoke. "You don't have to work on the case to bring this bitch down. If you tell the police about last night and identify her, they can take her in. I am sure they will find evidence, that she was accomplice to the other rapes, as well."
“Isn’t it always heart failure?” Martha murmured instead and directed her saddest smile at her neighbour. “It’s what happens, when one gets old.”
"Do you want us to be on a date?" The light of the candle danced in John's eyes, as he leaned forward on the table, to gaze openly at him.
"That I am transgender." Sherlock fixed his eyes on the surface of the water. "Everyone will know. Not only the judges and the police, but the media will learn of it as well. It will be all over the internet in minutes and whenever someone hears of Sherlock Holmes after this, the first thing that will come to their minds will be, that I am transgender. No matter if they hate me for it or celebrate me for it, my gender identity will define me from this moment forward and... I don't want that."
"Not everyone is gone for close to twelve hours each day either," Sherlock muttered to the empty flat. If John had started to work at an A&E, he would have understood the long hours but considering that his lover had taken a job at a local surgery Sherlock didn't understand why he had to work so long. They didn't need the money so badly that it was necessary for John to work so much. Sherlock had just earned them a nice cheque by solving the thief of a priceless collector's doll from their flat. The rent for the next couple of months was therefore secured.
Sherlock merely managed to nod, as his throat constricted painfully. When he had made his offer, he had assumed that they would share a bedroom. They were dating after all or... weren't they? Certainly John hadn't changed his mind so fast. Then again, he had said that they were dating, before Sherlock had put his foot into his mouth. Therefore, it would only be understandable, if John had re-considered.
Sherlock was still too breathless to reply, but somehow he managed to fulfil his lover's wish. When they lay snuggled together with the covers drawn up to their chests, Sherlock finally slipped out of his sticky pants. He felt John's eyes on him, but when he met his lover's gaze there was simply understanding written in it and no judgement whatsoever.
His head hurt. Sherlock stifled a groan and forced himself to lie perfectly still, although his head felt like it was going to explode.
"No!" Sherlock sat up with a start. Water splashed everywhere and John grimaced when his trousers and his jumper became wet. Still, the hand he placed on Sherlock's shoulder to keep him from jumping out of the bathtub, was gentle.
That was exactly, what had found its way into his body, although Sherlock couldn't say for sure, what drug it had been exactly. The options were numerous. He couldn't even tell from his symptoms - disorientation, nausea, trouble seeing clearly - what he had been given.
"Yes?" John nodded slowly, but the penny dropped, before Sherlock felt forced to elaborate. "You thought I didn't want to date you anymore, because I didn't want to share a bedroom with you?"
"Don't you dare go to the gym," Sherlock whispered against John's lips, "I like your small belly. It makes for the perfect pillow." A huff of laughter brushed against Sherlock's chin before their lips met again to engage in a passionate dance.
"Yes, everything went as you planned it. The bastard will never lay hand on another woman." Sherlock grinned and it only grew bigger, when John squirted some shower gel in his hands and then gestured for Sherlock to turn around, so that he could wash him.
"What can you tell us, Sherlock?" Right, Sherlock blinked to clear his head from the odd mixture of feelings that were swirling through his mind and took in the crime scene.
Sherlock's eyes snapped open with a start and he gasped for air like a drowning man. The sudden light and movement increased the pain in his head, but he had to know. He had to see for himself that he was home. That he had made it back to Baker Street and that he wasn't still with this woman.
"God, you're absolutely stunning." A light blush stained Sherlock's cheeks at John's praise, as the eyes of his lover roamed all over his body. Or at least, the parts that weren't covered by fabric.
"You will move in tomorrow," Sherlock announced with a bright grin and plopped a deep-fried prawn into his mouth.
"Sherlock, please." They stared at each other for a long moment and then laughter bubbled up in John's throat. "God, this conversation is the craziest thing, I’ve ever done."
"Hey, careful," John protested half-heartedly, as Sherlock swung him around and started to massage his scalp.
"Sherlock! Look out!" The shout echoed through Sherlock's Mind Palace, followed by a shot, that almost deafened him, as it tore him back to reality.
"Hold still." John didn't move a muscle, as Sherlock arranged them both to his liking, until his head was bedded on his lover's chest and his arm was around his shoulders. It wasn't the most comfortable position, but it allowed Sherlock to listen to John's heartbeat and breathe in his unique scent, which calmed his nerves, because his mind associated it with the safety of home.
Sherlock blinked up from his menu. "But you do. When we entered the restaurant, your eyes found the list with the wines, on the cardboard behind the bar, right away. You skipped over the white ones and your eyes lingered on a dry, red wine, for approximately one second. Therefore I ordered it." Sherlock finished his deductions with a flourish and then his face fell. "Was that wrong?" He knew that his deductions were correct, but the way John had told him, that he hadn't asked for wine, made Sherlock doubt himself.
“Another reason not to indulge in idleness, less one can’t finish their work, before the Lord calls them to His side.” Mrs Miller straightened her hat anew and glanced noticeably at her watch. “Oh, just look at the time, I need to hurry if I want a selection of the brightest roses. Would you be so dear and let the others know about Mrs Brown, since you’re already planning on just walking around town?”
Sherlock only managed to catch the first splash of semen with his mouth, as John's cock slipped from between his lips, as he gasped in pleasure, when John bent his finger inside him and rubbed his clit between two fingers, at the same time. Sherlock barely registered the warm fluid that painted his cheeks and forehead, as he shuddered through another orgasm.
It hurt. This was the first thought that flowed through Sherlock's mind, as he swam back to consciousness. His head was pounding. His throat felt raw and sore. There was an empty pain in his stomach and worst of all, his brain felt like it had been flooded with syrup. Every step he took in his Mind Palace appeared to take hours, as disconnected images were projected on the walls of it. The disapproving look on the face of a concierge. Moving images of London's streets. The irritated voice of a man. The knocker of 221 Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson's worried face. Angry blue eyes. The interior of their flat and then... nothing.
"Let's have some tea and I will explain everything to you... if you don't want to call the police right away, that's it." The first hint of insecurity and fear passed over John's features.
Tea splashed over the rim of the cup and onto the saucer, when Martha sat the cup down with more force than planned. “They are old, they won’t live forever,” she offered as calmly as possible.
They were seated in a secluded corner of the restaurant and Sherlock ordered them a bottle of wine and one of water, before they were left alone to study the menus.
Sherlock shook his head. Not that he could deny the logic behind such a statement, but he had believed that he had deleted all this psychological nonsense years ago. Obviously though, it was still hidden somewhere in his Mind Palace. He would have to take the time to search and delete the information but not now. Now, he needed something else. "I have to take a shower."
“What’s new in the village, Mrs Hudson?” John looked curiously at her, while Sherlock – bless his heart – did his outmost best to appear uninterested in the answer. “Oh, nothing much. Mrs Miller is her old, charming self, my bees are especially diligent this year and have produced the sweetest honey, so far and… Oh yes, Mrs Brown has died.”
There was confusion mirrored in John's eyes for a second, before he proved that he was slightly smarter than average, since he appeared to get the hidden meaning, in Sherlock's words. "Sure, sounds great. Lead the way."
"You are the only one, who sniffs at my hair," John reminded him, but didn't make to step away as Sherlock moved from his head to his shoulders and let his hands trail down his back.
"Pleased to meet you, Doctor Watson," Sherlock took the offered hand and then cursed himself for his stupid words. After he had accused John of some terrible crimes, vomited on his floor and came out to him as transgender, he couldn't think of anything better to say?! Sherlock was appalled at himself. That was, until he heard his host's chuckle and noticed the twinkle in his eyes. "Please call me John, Mr. Holmes."
"Drink up. I will clean up this mess," John gestured to the vomit on the floor, "And then we need to talk."
"Just take it." The phone landed on the blankets, as the man sighed in frustration. "I really don't know, how else to convince you, that I am not going to rape and kill you... or that I have committed any such crimes, in the past."
A snort sounded over the earpiece. "You mean, it's going to end with you in my bed? Sounds great to me. Can we just skip this whole stalking a killer thing then and move directly to the good part?"
John's eyes widened comically at the announcement. "I just told you that I killed enough people to be considered a serial killer."
Slowly Sherlock closed his hand around the phone and turned it on. The screen came to life. There were numerous messages and calls from Lestrade.
"Bad people," Sherlock clarified and stole another kiss from John's lips. "Besides, our first date included you shooting someone."
"I can't tell the police about last night." Sherlock closed his eyes in despair at the simple truth.
John shook his head. "I hadn't really thought about it. I want to believe that I would have told you, but then again... I couldn't withstand the temptation to kiss you back in the kitchen. And things might have gone further, if you hadn't figured out that I was the killer. I... I don't..."
