"More like, fancy you tracking me down here" said the Captain. Is not as if he was hiding, he was just walking through Central Park, trying to order his messy thoughts and come to terms with everything he had found out recently.
They walked in silence for a bit more. Even when they hadn't been talking for all that long, not even sharing the same space all that often, there was a trust building on between them, less want to fight and get at each other's throats and more friendship and bantering. It was nice. For Tony, it was different than with Pepper and Rhodey, the soldier didn't harassed him into being honest, he just took what Tony wanted to tell him. For Steve, it was nice that someone actually asked and didn't sneak behind his back to find out on their own to throw it to his face.
"What are you doing here, Tony? I thought after your sergury, you would be recovering. Isn't too soon to be out of bed?" he asked concernedly.
"Come on, Cap. You know I wouldn't have said no to a distraction. Being in bed all day? It was killing me" Tony said dramatically and Steve smiled lightly.
"He survived you, I doubt this would drag him down" replied Steve, trying to shoot for amusement and was rewarded with the small quirk on the corner of the genius' lips.
"Still, you could have just called. No need for the face to face, though I can understand you missing me and all" teased Tony.
"I must say, I'm surprised you called. Heck, you're even using videochat" Tony was quick to change the subject, teasing Steve was always a safe area and he couldn't use a bit of a laugh, even if it was at the Captain's expense.
"I'm not as hopeless in tech as you like to think" raised a brow the soldier, a small smile playing on his lips.
Steve turned, controlling the impulse to attack out of surprise, muscles tensing for a moment before he recognized Tony and relaxed, crossing his arms and watching him unimpressed.
"He's gonna pull through. He's tough" said Tony, sounding defensive even when Steve hadn't been attacking him, as if the Captain had been calling to tell him he should prepare himself for the worse or something.
There was a moment of silence were neither men knew what to say, they weren't this kind of people, the ones that talk of their problems and do the feeling-talk, Steve just prefers to deny it all and say everything is going fine while Tony just works himself raw and uses avoidance and hard sarcasm to keep everyone away. The only two persons in the world Tony thought he could talk to were unavailable to him, Rhodey was away on his job and Pepper... that was just falling apart and he didn't know how to make it stop.
“Dr Gottlieb why is it necessary for Tony to be awake for this last detox treatment and is it really necessary, after all he has been slowly detoxing for the last two months with the medication you prescribed that I have been giving him.”
If you are successful in getting back to the penthouse without exposing yourself fully I will consider your punishment ended and we will start afresh with a clean slate.”
Tony barely help back a sob as Steve’s hand pressed against the front of his pants in full view of the others, a disappointing look on his face.
“But l’m not supposed be like this, l would never have let Steve do this to me in my universe, l don’t understand why l am not more resistant to the changes you have forced on me.  Why have l not broken, for Christ sake, dozens of strangers fucked me this morning and l was hard and would have had multiple orgasms if you had not caged me.
“Mmmm, Winter I think that our fuck toy likes the idea of being a real bitch, no stubby cocklet ruining the line of her panties, yes Tony we know all about your secret stash, you will be getting punished for keeping that secret from your Alphas
Over the last two years he had modified and perfected her body, so now she was  petite, curvy and had a full bust with pert nipples that were always erect. Her blond hair curled round her shoulders framing her delicate features.
Also, l am quite capable of looking after myself, l don’t need security, l have the armour and Jarvis.”
Morning had finally arrived, he had been dressed in tight black shorts, shackled hand and foot and led through the Tower to Ms Potts office.  The Alpha CEO of Stark Industries had stripped him of his shorts and proceeded to run her hands over his body and head, in a physical examination as though he was a prized animal at a show.  She had then bent him over her desk and pressed the SI brand to his shoulder, ignoring his gasp of pain her teeth had then sunk into his bonding gland and his fate had been sealed, a cold and impersonal bonding on her part but the flood of Alpha pheromones had his omega instincts rearing to the fore and he had dived headfirst into the feeling of belonging and the need to serve his Alpha completely, that came with the initial rush of bonding, it didn’t matter that it had not been consensual, he had still fallen to his knees and presented himself to her.
He still loved Steve even if he did not like him very much, at the moment, and the thought of not being with him was scary. After all who would want him the way he was now, small, weak, and pathetic who wet himself and cried at the slightest thing.  After all the trouble he had caused and the time and effort everyone had put in to getting him healthy, he would be such an ungrateful brat to throw it all back in their faces just because he was selfish and wanted his own way and was not taking into consideration Steve’s feelings and needs.
The first time he met Tony he had known that he would do anything to ensure that he would belong to Steve.  Tony needed his love and protection, his wild reckless nature needed to be tamed, the fragile soul hidden beneath his many masks would shatter if Steve did not gather him up and keep him close under his loving control.
He rushed through milking and feeding BB, feeling generous he took off her harness, just leaving her tied by a long lead rein, through her nose ring.
Oh God, she couldn’t let anything happen to Sam, what if they interrogated him and found out about the underground omega escape routes that were being set up.  She couldn’t lose him again they had only just reconciled, not after their years of separation whilst he was in the Air Force and their previously divided views on omega rights.
Tony fucked himself on Steve’s cock using the sides of the bath once again for leverage the warm water buoying his pregnant belly, but no matter how much he bounced on his Alpha’s cock he could not get enough rise to push himself down hard and hit his prostrate each time.  It really sucked that he was totally reliant on his Alpha to give him an orgasm or another omega.  No matter how much he masturbated or rode his Alpha’s cock he could not orgasm without his Alpha’s permission.
Steve laughed at the evident sign of his discomfort and told his omega to remain still, eyes closed and with his hands resting on his thighs palms upward.
“No Bucky I want to keep it like it is as a reminder to Tony that he cannot whore around anymore since it’s too small to give anyone any pleasure.”
Oh, don’t you get all growly and offended, Peggy would never have worked, Tony is your omega, and your bond is getting stronger, you just need to keep fucking him and putting him in his place when he is here. You have done an excellent job with his feminisation, and you have bred him once already, he will catch again when the time is right.
Capturing the omega’s lips, he roughly kissed him until he was gasping for breath.  Snaking his hand down between their bodies he captured the small stubby cock, rolling it between his fingers as the cock cage released falling on to the bed. Winter worked the cock until it was plump and weeping clear drops of pre cum. Sitting back up he pinched each reddened nipple as he continued fondle Tony’s cock.
Tony knew it should be physically impossible for his body to take in both Alphas fists without being ripped in two, but here he was bearing down as his knees slid out to the sides, his holes swallowing their fists, then their wrists and as gravity had its way he ended with his cunt and asshole seated halfway down their forearms.
Once in the bathroom he quickly stripped Tony out of his trousers, ripping the side seam of the pull-up he held the sodden mess in front of Tony’s pale face.
There we go, see the pretty lights, on the other side there will be a special someone waiting to greet you, he is going to be ecstatic that his mate and child have been returned to him. Now come along step through, the pups are safe on the other side.”
“Sir, I must inform you that with the plugs at their largest it will be highly uncomfortable and nearly impossible for him to walk upright.”
“Such a good omega I am so proud of you, this shows that you are embracing our bond, submitting to the knowledge that as your Alpha I am in control and you need do nothing but trust and follow where I lead you.”
“Stupid weak little omega can’t even manage one simple task! That is why you need an Alpha you are not strong enough to survive on your own, all those years of pretending to be strong and independent just caused you to fuck things up and make mistake after mistake.”
“That’s so you will know your place and never forget.  If you are a very good whore, we might reward you with some work for S.I. but only if you don’t display any signs of rebellion or dominance.  You better hope that my omega is recover soon, because you can’t even come close to replacing him, but I will just have to make do.”
He stares at himself in the mirror as he sits on Steve’s lap, his pussy filled with his Alpha’s cock, the gold rings round his irises are the most startling change, they glow brighter every time Steve tweaks his nipples or grinds his cock against his sweet spot.  His pecs are soft and tender, he can see they are already slightly swollen.  He does not want to look at his stomach, but his Alpha takes hold of his hand and places it over the hard outline of his enormous cock, surrounded by his soft cum filled belly.  His own cock is hard and leaking, already smaller in size, he knows from having bedded omegas that it will shrink down further along with his balls.
All the public and press wanted to see was his latest outfit or titillating photo on Instagram.  It was even worse for Pepper, she was totally shunned, seen as a whore and laughed at by the business world and a porn star and pregnant mare by the public who had made her film “Slutty Cow gets a good Milking” one of the highest grossing porn films of the year.
The President spent some time teasing her clit and cunt with light flicks of the suede whip, once her labia and asshole where covered in a sheen of omega juices and slick he began to reign down heavier strikes until her cunt and hole were both swollen and puffy, her labia piercing almost hidden by the engorged flesh.
With some careful manoeuvring Steve had Tony kneeling, Winter laying on the floor with his fist buried in in the panting omega’s asshole.
He was also fascinated by the thought of meeting his counterpart, he could only imagine the research and scientific advancements that they could make with their combined knowledge and with Professor Hulk as well.
Even with Dummie and the other bots trying to manually push the huge round disc there was very little movement, Tony glanced over at the glass wall panels, flinching at each heavy thud against the reinforced glass.  Whoever was out there was either very strong or had some kind of explosive battering ram that was causing the glass to start cracking with each hit.
You will return tonight in time for this Gala you have spoken about and show to the elite of Midgard that Loki is no longer favoured by Asgard and is to be treated as a Jotun whore.”
Her hair had already been bleached white, so all that was needed was to cut it in to a severe ear length bob, shaved into the neck with an extremely short fringe that showed off her bleached eyebrows, black smokey eye makeup with a hint of silver and dark lips, completed the look.  Her body was then painted with black and white markings.
For a moment it looks as though Steve not going to be a dickhead about his omega being Iron Man but true to form his Alpha instincts kick in.
Bonding with Tony had been planned between himself and Pepper and the timing speeded up due to his mission.  He agreed fully with the return of Alpha and Pack Law. Omega Registration and the Stark Amendments he now believed were the correct way forward for all omegas.  His experiences with Tony showed what could be achieved if a wayward omega had a strong Alpha and followed a strict regime.
Thor returned after spending some time on Asgard, he looked incredibly serious as he asked for an emergency Pack meeting.
“Do you want to live on you own? Do you want Captain Rogers and Ms’ Potts to take care of you, or do you want the Court to decide where you live?”
Humming with pleasure she welcomed the return of the fingers to her once again milk laden breasts, the thick digits kneading and stroking, coaxing the flow of milk from her aching teats with a gentleness that she had never been shown before.  She couldn’t help but moan a soft ‘thank you’ to her gentle tormentor.
“That’s it such a good boy just relax and enjoy the evening, all these Alphas are here to watch you, their omegas are going play with you and make you feel so good.”
Steve could sense through the bond a broad outline of what Tony was feeling.  As it was mostly all true he could not offer any comfort to his omega, it would be false and a lie.  He would however ensure that he would not crush his omega’s creativeness and drive to help others as Iron Man and to atone for his past as the Merchant of Death.
Matters had only gotten worse in the last six months after Tony had been on the wrong end of a deranged witch’s de-aging spell. Tony had gone from being the oldest Avenger at 46 to the youngest at 17, he had retained all his intelligence and memories but had the physical body and emotional maturity of a stroppy teenager.  There was no reversing the spell as Thor’s hammer had ended the witch’s life before they realised what had happened.  Thor had been most apologetic, but even after consulting with Queen Frigga there was no solution to be found.
Captain Rogers had men and women swooning in his full-dress uniform, his blond hair and blue eyes sparkling in the sunlight, his arm wrapped round the petite figure of his husband Tony Stark.  Dark curls had been tamed into a tousled just out of bed look, his slim body dressed in a fitted pink shirt and black dress pants, his signature high tops, noticeably without lifts adorned his feet.  He was smiling adoringly up at Captain Rogers who towered over him, clutching a small velvet cushion, it appeared as though his task had been to carry the wedding rings during the ceremony.
“Great everyone, that’s a wrap, thanks you guys, there is a car waiting to take you back to the city.
Tears flowed from his omega’s eyes, sad pools of pain and despair, short, sharp  rapid gasps for breath told Steve that a panic attack was imminent, Steve smirked knowing that he Tony in the palm of his hand this would be the turning point in their relationship.
First Stark Industries, you will be stepping down as Head of R&D immediately, you will continue to work on projects for SI in your own workshop. You will not work more that twenty hours a week unless l give you permission.  Pepper has adjusted your salary accordingly, any private consultancy work will be thoroughly vetted by Pepper and myself, and you will be accompanied by security at all times if l or the Avengers are not available.”
Pepper adjusted he bra and buttoned her blouse, she would need to change her stockings and skirt before the meeting, perhaps she would forgo her knickers and give the old bastards one last thrill before she ousted the lot of them.  With the shares she had been secretly buying back and Steve having Conservatorship of Tony’s holdings they would have enough to buy out the remaining board members and have total control of the Company.
Steve could feel Tony shaking and gasping for breath as he spoke, with the help of Anna he released the restraints and gathered up his trembling husband, on seeing him naked apart for what looked like an adult diaper he wrapped him in the blue blanket before sitting in the armchair by the side of the bed.
“Bruce when you are ready to start her procedures, I want Pepper to observe, whilst she is being a good submissive beta alpha at the moment, it will not hurt to give her a reminder of what could happen to her if she transgresses against the Pack and myself.”
“That’s it Steve, now l am going to stand, and l want you on your knees, it will be a better position for you to work from and you will be able to swallow the whole of my cock.”
“Steve if you have finished with baby doll’s mouth, can you get her up on to her knees for me, I want her to ride my fist.”
Steve could feel Tony’s thoughts and knew that this was a significant moment in his omega’s training, there was only one outcome to this perceived battle he would be victorious and his omega would learn that his body belonged totally to his Alpha and that his Alpha could do anything he wanted to said body.
Pepper’s hair was a vivid orange, the short spikes glistening with a frosted gel.  Her dark lined eyes had frosted orange lids and under eye, the thick coating of brown lipstick made her lips look full and plump.
The watcher stared at the shivering figure, his boy looked beautiful, the satin hugging the faint curves that were appearing on his small frame, the stockings and shoes elongated his legs, giving definition to his claves and slim ankles, he imagined them hooked round his back or over his shoulders. He palmed his hard cock as he wrote instructions on the mirror for his little captain to follow.
“Hell, Hulk doesn’t mess about, l reckon I could fit both my arms up there. Oh my god! Look at the size of him, he is going to tear her apart with that monster!”
But that would all change now that he, Captain America had been unfrozen and bought back to life after seventy years under the Arctic Ice.
“Good omega, once the pups have been born and you have bonded the operation will take place, there is plenty of your milk frozen and now we have the new omega milk cow the older pups will be able to feed whenever they want.
“Bruce, get the fuck off of me, initiation is over, and I am never allowing another alpha to put me into that kind of position ever again.”
“Such a good Captain for me, now when l knot you you can come but only on my command, just like the pretty submissive bitch you are.’
Days passed in a blur of feeding and caring for all seven pups, the girls needy and clingy, confused by the additional pups, Loki and the Nanny ensured that each pup had their turn with him, at night the girls refused to go back to the nursery and Tony found himself surrounded by his pups, a smile on his face in the quiet moments when all seven were asleep.
“Good idea Bruce, also I think that Friday should be restricted to the Tower and the Compound, after Ultron and Thanos I don’t feel that the public are ready to know the extent of her abilities, apart from the fact I don’t feel comfortable with her having access to the whole of the internet and the ability to hack into any data base in the world.  Put what restrictions you think are necessary and just give Tony access to simple commands for help within the tower, no news channels as well, I do not want him concerning himself with outside problems, he needs to learn to let go and concentrate on what is now important to him as an omega.
Back in his suite he circled Tony, taking note of all the differences in his appearance.  He certainly looked healthy and just as young, but he was decidedly more feminine in appearance.
“Alpha Rogers, your omega has slight bruising on his face, deeper bruising on his hips along with mild to deep scratching on his stomach and thighs.
The Omega Registry have agreed to withdraw their legal right to claim complete guardianship over you as a highly vulnerable Omega, on the proviso that you bond immediately with your Pack for stability and that you live as a Traditional Omega for a period of time, until they feel you have embraced and accepted your Omega status. The Registry will regularly check up on you, to assess you and your interactions with your Pack and with your Alpha.”
Tony bore done on Bucky’s fingers fucking himself in the cold hard digits, mewling at the burn as third finger joined the other two stretching his hole.  Bucky grinned and jabbed his fingers hard up in to omega’s hole just as Steve bit down on the bitch’s puffy teat.  The omega’s scream of pain was enough for him so shoot his load, coating Tony’s ass and thighs with his thick cum.
Darcy and Loki stayed on their knees, jaws and throats aching, as their Alphas continued to enjoy the Gala, uncaring that their heavily pregnant omegas were extremely uncomfortable, foreheads pressed too the floor, as they held presentation position, so that all could see their exposed bejewelled and ringed sex. Sira stood watch over them, her switch flicking at their raised asses if they drew move or make a noise.
“Oh fuck, look at how easily l can fit my fist into his sloppy cunt, Sam com on, let’s see if you can fit your cock in as well.  Jason you and David see if you can fit both your cocks in his mouth.
Winter and Steve pull out together as their knots deflate, Steve slips in the butt plug before he manhandles Tony until he is laying with his head over the edge of the bed.  Winter climbs on to the mattress, gripping his omega’s hips hard he presses his cock between wet pussy lips, sliding deep in to the tight heat of Tony’s cunt.  Winter lets loose, ramming his cock repeatedly up into Tony’s cunt whilst keeping his hips pinned firmly to the mattress, he can already see the bruises forming beneath his fingers, stark black marks against pale smooth skin.
Thor has seen the look of lust sweep over the President’s face at the sight of Loki, though diplomatic relations with Midgard were not important it would not hurt to have the President’s favour.
First time litters can take a long time so just keep your omega hydrated and fed, the birth channel is still tight so you may want to either fuck your bitch before full labour starts or insert an expanding dildo to help loosen the muscles further.
He finished wrapping Tony’s feet in the belt webbing made from his security officer uniform, it was crude but at least would protect the soles of his feet. Tony was wearing the t-shirt, which covered his stomach and upper thighs. It was the best they could do as the trousers were to tight round his waist, whilst swamping his shot legs.
Steve the baby needs a name and it is the Alpha’s duty even to this day to name the child, the omega gets to choose one of the middle names, an antiquated rule not often followed but it will set the tone.”
Once in the examination room the doctor motioned for Tony to strip and stand on the scales. Noting the results, he then gestured for the omega to lay down on the examination table.
He was a certified genius, who had revolutionised the weapon industry and even when he stopped making weapons after his kidnapping, he still made defensive gear for the armed forces.  He diversified into tech, medical and green energy leading SI to become a Multi Billion Dollar Global Entity.  This all by the age of 24, yes, he started at a much younger age than most, having finished MIT at the age of 14.  The death of his parents, betrayal and kidnapping had not stopped him form rising to the top of the world of business.
With some gentle prompting they managed to get a dazed Lady Sophia to sign the enclosed documents, passing full control of all her assets to her husband, abdicating her title immediately in favour of any female alpha child she might produce.  The most important and life changing they left until last, ‘The English Deed of Omega Ownership’ an archaic document that few realised still existed.
Pepper froze at the hard tone in Steve’s voice, she wanted to tell him to fuck off out of her office but fought for control, she turned and walked towards him, struggling to bare her neck in submission.  As she moved forward, she took note of all the changes to her office, all her ultra -modern furnishings had been replaced with wood and leather steeped with the smell of Steve’s alpha pheromones. In front of the floor to ceiling windows there was an omega crate and breeding bench, in the far corner she could see a small office set up.
Over time the rarity of omegas gave them their own power, they became wealthy and independent, able to hold Alphas to ransom over mating and pups, leaders of their families in everything but fighting. But as Society evolved Omegas became arrogant and corrupted by the power they held, refusing to bond and bear pups, not wanting to be unmade on an Alpha’s knot.  During that time Omega Crates transformed into Omega Nests, luxurious and opulent, with no bars.
Steve didn’t bother to dress after his shower, he threw himself onto the couch and had Jarvis que up all Tony’s training videos, spreading his thighs he took his cock in hand as his omega’s sweet cries filled the room. He would get Tony and his pup back, even if it took years, he would never give up and with Bruce watching over Tony and working on a way to align their two universes so a Portal could be created he knew it would be sooner rather than later.  For now though he would just make use of Pepper and test out Natasha’s new toy.
If for any reason, JARVIS went off line for more than ten minutes then Tony would be able to use the escape routes hidden within the walls or if injured lock himself in the panic room underneath the armour assembly platform at the back of the workshop.  Only Steve and the rest of the Avengers knew about the panic room, Tony had built it himself whilst the tower was being constructed along with the hidden passageways.
There are dinners in Steve’s apartment in the Tower, always home cooked meals, that he thinks taste even more special because Steve has made them, when he compliments him on the taste, he just gives him a small smile and a kiss, saying ‘Only for you’.  The kissing and handholding stay in the privacy of their apartments, they still sit together on movie nights though and Tony tries not to blush at Natasha’s knowing looks.
Steve smirked as Tony shuffled into their personal training room, hair sticking up on end, bleary eyed with a grumpy look on his face.
Natasha filed her nails as she waited for Pepper to finish applying her makeup, she knew Pepper was being deliberately slow as a protest to the outfit she had laid out for her to wear today.  She had also spent twenty minutes brushing her hair and styling it in a perfect ponytail, ensuring her bangs were straight and level.   She smiled inwardly, little did the bitch know that within the next few days she would be firmly under Natasha’s influence, Stark Industries would have their CEO and she would have her pet Alpha.
Before Stark could sit he grabbed hold of his arm and dragged him from the room, luckily there was an empty office next door he kicked the door shut behind them engaging the look to ensure they would not be interrupted.
Hands began to caress his body sliding along his limbs and skimming over his chest, fingers brushing over his clamped nipples making him hiss in pain.  His shadowed vision darkened further as a head lowered over his face, soft lips and a tongue began to lick and suck the cum off his face. He shivered as teeth nipped and kissed along his jaw and down his neck, his newly shaved skin more sensitive to each bite and lick.
Know lean over the end of the bed I am going fuck your holes and fill them with my, cum before I plug you. Darcy screamed a he wrecked both her holes, his cock pounding into her with no care for comfort or pleasure, once he had shot his load in both holes he pushed in the largest plug in his collection, laughing as she begged him not to split her in half.
Steve had seen the security footage after the event but wasn’t going to admit to Clint that he longed to get his hands, on Tony’s lithe body and sink his teeth into his peachy round ass cheeks.  Unfortunately, it would never happen, Alphas mated with omegas or betas to form packs, base- line humans did not have the physiology to form bonds or be influenced by an Alpha’s voice.  Tony would always be an outlier of the pack and Steve would not risk destroying the forming Pack or the Avengers because he was lusting after him, also Tony deserved to find love and be in a committed relationship not just a fling that they both knew would never amount to anything long term.  The Pack needed an Omega to love and cherish, to feed and fatten, to form a family bond with.  Steve needed an omega to become his mate, to do all the aforementioned with, and to his give him pups.
Memories wiped after every mission, he was then put in cryogenic sleep until he as needed for his next mission.  Brutally punished for any show of rebellion or mistake on a mission, the Winter Soldier became a cold, unfeeling, killing machine.
Tony would be the main caregiver to their pups as was a mama omega’s role, this responsibility surpassed all others apart from his submission to his Alpha.
Bucky had stayed silent as he continued to slowly fuck his bitch whilst fondling its milk swollen tits as Steve fed the little cow.  Now seemed the ideal time to plant a little seed of doubt in Steve’s mind.
Tony screamed as his channel was filled with his Alpha’s huge cock his burning ring of muscles stretched to its limit, each thrust hitting his gland the pain of his cock being pressed against the nubs on the inside of the cock cage as it tried to fill contrasting with the jolts of pleasure each time his gland was hit by his Alpha’s cock.  Time blurred along with the pain and the pleasure, minutes or hours could have passed and Tony would not have been able to say which.
After the procedure he busied himself picking out an outfit for his baby boy to wear, he had decided that a bit of fresh air would do Tony the world of good, there was a special secluded play area where Daddies could have all kinds fun with their Littles.  Nurse Mayer had already left the specially adapted buggy for his baby, Tony would not be allowed to walk until his bones had hardened and even then, Steve was going to insist that he crawl or be carried most of the time.  Walking would be a treat for good behaviour and when he was in his semi-adult headspace.
There followed the indignity of having yet another enema, even though he told them he had just been thoroughly cleaned by his Alphas inside and out.  His skin was scrubbed pink with disinfectant before the final humiliation of having a catheter fitted along with IV ports in both hands.
Tony recognised that older woman being interviewed as the last nannie he had had before he was sent away to boarding school when he was eight years old.  Mary had adored him and along with the rest of the staff doted on him showering him with all the love and attention that he did not receive from his parents.
“Morning little boss, looking good, got you some jellybeans from that new sweetshop that’s just opened, all- natural flavourings, they even have blueberry ones.”
Steve had known that he would be a controlling and traditional Alpha even in this modern age where it seemed that omegas had been given the right to refuse an Alpha bond and loudly proclaimed their independence.  On meeting Tony Stark and discovering he was an omega he had known that he would accept no other omega as his mate, the challenge of taming the loud obnoxious and arrogant omega had excited him.  Deep down he knew it was a reaction to all those Alphas of his pre-serum days who had treated him with distain and mocked him for ever thinking he would be able to get an omega to bond with him when he was such a weak and sickly Alpha.
He spent hours taking out the rest of his frustration and aggression on Pepper,  finally he strapped her to the breeding bench and whipped her behind raw, then branded her lower back with the words ‘Avengers Whore’.
Everything has to always be about you and what you want, have you ever considered what your husband needs, what you should to do to make him happy and to show your love and how grateful you are for him not abandoning you to a life loneliness in some care facility.”
A warm bubble bath had already been prepared, he wasted no time in striping his baby of the soaked diaper and placing him in the water.  Unstrapping the pacifier, he tossed it into the sink along with the soaked mittens that he had forgotten to take off.  After gently sponging down Tony’s limbs he washed his tear stained face before tipping his head back to wash his tangled sweaty curls.
He manages to make it to the nursery door before he drops defeated to his knees with a scream of rage, tears burning in his eyes he starts to crawl forward his nostrils flaring as he catches the scent of both Alphas.  He needs to get to them his heat is flaring up and all he wants is to be fucked and filled with cum.
Letting go of the beads he watched as they swung down between his omega’s legs the small cock dragged down by the weight, unsurprisingly his omega remained hard, the small hiss passing his lips the only reaction to the added weight on his piercing.  The string of crystal beads gradually slowed to a stop hanging down to mid- thigh sparkling in the light.
“Come on Steve, feed me, I am fading away to nothing before your very eyes, cake first then grapes and I think I want chicken tagliatelle for dinner with garlic bread and a side of asparagus spears from that my favourite Italian restaurant, just say my name and they will deliver, even to the hospital.”
Omega Stark is dehydrated and has missed his last two feeds so l recommend that you crate him and l will initiate his feeding and rest cycle, he should be adequately healed and rested for your use his other orifices this evening.”
Steve timed 10 minutes then move Tony to suckle on her other breast.  By the time Tony had drunk his full, Pepper was moaning and restlessly moving her legs, her nipples swollen and red.
The leash tightened jerking him closer to Steve’s leg, the shortening of its length had him straining to remain on his knees, his neck stretched tautly.
The reaction of the Pack was everything he expected, Hulk had stayed for a short time but had then dragged Jella down to the Hulk Room, thankfully it could be made soundproof and was built to withstand treble the strength of Hulk on a rampage. Curiosity won out and they turned on the live feed and settled down to watch Hulk claim his omega giant.
Tony blushed furiously as Steve gently sponged his body, he kept his eyes closed as large hands moved his limbs carefully so as not to jerk his injured shoulder or leg.  When the sponge brushed over his groin he whimpered as he felt his cock twitch, fortunately or unfortunately as the case may be, the catheter stopped him from getting harder.  The drag of the sponge along his perineum and over his hole made his gasp out loud.
“Great Bruce, can we start now, Tony has napped long enough, I have ordered a sexy corset for him to wear to the White House on Monday.”
“Pup, you are to obey the Vet and follow all his instructions, you will be punished severely if I find you have misbehaved.  When we return I expect to see a fine little breeding bitch, ready and eager to show its owners how well behaved and useful it can be.
Steve waited for his knot to go down enough so he could pull out and plunge into Tony’s pussy, even drenched in slick he could still feel his cock rubbing against the soft walls, there were strange little bumps that massaged his cock as he ploughed into him. The drag of his sensitive skin over them, drove him into a frenzy, his knot popped, his alpha fangs tore into Tony’s neck, ripping away the scarred skin. He felt the moment his fangs pierced the omega gland, flooding it with mating serum as his cum filled Tony’s hole.
With that said he pressed the brand into the flesh over his omega’s heart.  Once removed the image of an American Eagle with wide spread wings and hooked talons was imprinted onto his omega’s flesh.
Closing down his computer, he bade Jarvis lockdown the lab, it was time to speak with the pack Alphas about the two options they had and check up on their omega’s milk production. The testing period had ended, he was expecting good results, but just in case he picked up another vial of mammary tissue stimulant.  Both Alphas had a fetish for seeing their omega with large tits, so he was fully expecting them to advocate using the gel regardless of whether it was needed or not.
“You will walk five paces in front of me when we leave this room, you will keep your head up and eyes looking straight ahead at all times, if your shirt slips off you will not stop to replace it so I suggest you do not rush or make any sudden movements.
A heavily pregnant bitch always turned him on, especially Pepper, as he knew how much she hated being pregnant and gaining weight. This time he was going to insist that her breasts be enlarged beyond their natural pregnancy growth.  His slut would hate having large breasts and a huge belly, he would definitely have her professionally filmed and photographed this time.
“Jarvis, please sedate them all tomorrow morning after they have eaten and cleaned themselves.  I will have three of the Iron Legion come down and prep them for travel.
The doors to the ballroom opened and Ms Potts entered in towering heels, a few steps behind her came the other bids for the auction, the girls dressed in thigh skimming sheer strapless dresses and the boy in tight, translucent shorts, Natasha could see that they were all young and beautiful, none were omegas, probably just rich kids wanting a thrill or college students wanting money to help pay their fees.
Tony’s hole was dripping in slick so he he slid right in and took his time, slow, deep thrusts that dragged over his omega’s prostrate with every pass. Tony whine and moaned beneath him, trying to push up to meet his thrusts, stilling he said nothing until his omega stopped all movement and sound after a whispered ‘forgive me Alpha.’
Tony clawed at Steve’s hand trying to pull it away to stop the ever increasing pain as his cock was slowly crushed.
Alphas, like wolves knot their bitches/omegas when breeding. Tying them together to ensure a successful impregnation and mating.  Now human physiology and biology has long lost that ability, but what we can create are the physical attributes such as slick glands and Alpha knots.  You would be surprised how in demand these modifications have become, powerful men and women are always looking for new ways to dominate and subjugate.
Tony looked at Sarah, it was strange to think this baby was part of him, she looked nothing like him, blond haired with bright blue eyes, she stared up at him with a knowing look as if to say, yes I am here and you will do exactly what l want. There was no doubt she was an Alpha.  He changed her nappy and dressed her , he yawned, his jaw aching along with his hips and sex, he couldn’t think why he ached so much, Steve hadn’t been that rough with him last night, not compared to Him.
“Remember, if you waste any, you will be punished.  Now drink up then clean up, and then l want you on the breeding bench, time to fill your cunt with my cum and get you pregnant again.”
He managed to push in a fourth finger, smiling when he felt Steve push pack to meet his thrust. His own cock was rock hard and dripping, but he resisted the urge to do anything, he just kept pumping his fingers in time with Steve’s thrusts in the silent omega. Shit the ball gag was probably stopping the meg from getting enough air!
Tony slowly returned to consciousness, tired eyes fluttering open to blearily take in the sight of his Alphas placing a pup on each breast, try as he might he could not bring his arms up to hold his pups securely so they could feed.
“I am sure Natasha will dig up the dirt on Adams, I would suggest she takes a close look at the step-daughter, something is not quite right. I will send Clint to help her, they will be able to wrap things up quicker if they work together.”
The hot wet warn of Tony’s mouth enveloped his straining erection the graze of teeth as he pushed deeper sent frissons of pleasure along its length and through his balls. He felt the head of his cock nudge against Tony’s throat but knew that only halve his cock was fully in Tony’s mouth and that soon he would be gagging for breath when his full length settled in his throat.
“Fuck, Sweetheart you really scared us, if it wasn’t for your sub dermal tracker, we may never have found you.  What the hell were you think, going off on your own?  You know that is one of the rules you are never supposed to disobey.”
Now little one it is time for bed, lets put your paci back in and get you wrapped up snug as a bug in a rug.”
Clint sniggered as he bent down next to Tony and shoved a handful of bacon into his mouth chewing noisily trying to get a reaction out of silent omega.
“My bitch’s holes are open for use until midday as part of his mandatory punishment.  I expect to see a well used and cum filled omega when l return, this is your opportunity to show Tony Stark  his rightful place and punish him for his utter disrespect to yourselves as his workers and to the Stark Industries Pack.”
“Master Bjorn, you were right, he has responded well to our care, it confused him but eventually he began to relax and respond to the positive attention, especially when he realised, he would be rewarded with the sweet scent of omega pheromones.
You will be allowed workshop time for Avengers repairs and auxiliary support during battles and if the Avengers are called away on a mission.
Tony sighed, he as not going to stop feeding Peggy just because Bruce didn’t like the fact, he had not taken off his clothes the moment he came home.
“Steve, stop being a dick! I am going back inside and finding a toilet, there is no way I am shitting myself.  Afterwards I am getting the hell out of here and as far away from you as possible, I love you, but I think you are the one that needs treatment not me.”
“Sweetheart you are so pretty laid before me, your soft thighs coated with slick and your hole loose and ready to take my cock.”
Steve screamed as Bucky’s knock wrecked his hole, the pressure on his prostrate sending him spiralling into a torturous orgasm pleasure and agony fighting  for dominance as Bucky tore into his shoulder.   His body thrashing and shaking as heat and fire ripped through his veins.  He could hear himself screaming and begging, Bucky roaring as his cum flooded his hole, pushing up inside him.
Once the omega started to stir, he climbed out and got dressed in his sweats and t-shirt. After eating a quick meal, the nurse bought the baby back for him to hold.  Bruce arrived a short while later, standing off to the side to monitor the situation as the whimpers of the hungry baby stirred Tony to open his eyes, his befuddled gaze landed on Steve’s face, his sharp intake of breath and panicked moan had Steve reaching out to cup his face, making him meet his eyes.
Bucky had scared the shit out of him so he as only to happy for Winter to have appeared.  He was still wary and a little scared of Winter but the bonding had helped and as soon as Dr Strange could be found Bucky could hopefully be gotten rid of completely.  He was concerned about the development of the pack bond and what it meant for him, Steve was being very cagey about the details and Winter just gave him a tiny knowing smile whenever he tried to ask him.  Jarvis yet again had put a block on any internet research he had tried stating it was at his Alphas behest.  He was thoroughly frustrated at his lack of knowledge of both traditional omega pregnancies and war/fighting pack bonds, he could hazard a guess that he was not going to be enamoured about either traditions.
“ well l would say that she probably caught after her first cycle, remarkable really given that her womb was still not fully mature.  That’s probably why she is only carrying four pups,  subsequently when she is bred  l would expect four to eight pups in each litter.
Slipping his sandals back on he entered on to the common room floor, hoping that none of the Alphas would be present, his luck seemed to be on his side.  Tony was fast asleep, curled up in his nest, well as much as his huge pregnant stomach would allow, his breasts were considerably smaller than the last time he had visited.  He knew from speaking with Tony that the other omega was extremely relieved about this, but he couldn’t help the brief flash of anger, that it was at the expense of his aunt May.
“Mmmm Steve that’s it, god your fingers are magic the always get me hot and wet, ready for your cock to split me in two.”
“Maybe one day Prince Thor, for now though l think Loki needs to be punished for coming without permission and for enticing Omega Stark into misbehaving.
As sight and sound returned he realised he was still in the omega crate that Alpha Steve had thrown him into the previous afternoon, at first he hadn’t been bothered, relieved to be away from Alpha Steve’s anger, exhausted and hurting he had curled up and passed out.
Sira finished locking together all the piercings, moving away she motioned for Thor to spray his cum over Loki’ clitoris and cunt lips, to aid.
Steve pushed her forward towards the conference table, eager for the moment she realised that there was a few new, but familiar faces sitting at the table.
“You like that don’t you baby, the thought of everyone watching and seeing how beautiful you are as you take my knot, maybe another night.  But for now, l am going to make you sit on my knot whilst l play with your omega cock until you squirt and my cum floods your greedy hole.”
“You are improving Captain, but you need to be in absolute control of your body and mind at all times you cannot afford to be distracted by your emotions whilst fighting, save them for when you are fucking our pretty little omega.”
“Shhh sweetie, they are just about to start filming, we will discuss it tomorrow with Bruce.  Now watch Pepper, she is going to become a porn star after this film is released, a much better fit for her that pretending that she was capable of running Stark Industries, I don’t blame you though for making her CEO, she is just that good an actress and took advantage of your  mentally fragile state.”
“Please, p-please, please. I-I-I’ll be really r-r-really good. I-I won’t get s-s-sick a-any-m-more, I p-pr-romise.” He wails.
And then the hand withdraws, Steve frowning as he looks up at Tony with reproach. Tony chuckles, brown eyes twinkling.
He tries the door but it's locked. Still, he doesn't lose hope. With new found determination, he climbs over the pilot controls, light flickering as the engine dies to malfunction.
To be fair, he’s had four of the six bottles of vodka all by himself (This does not make him alcoholic, Natasha insists).
him before. He didn’t think that that still applied to today, admittedly it sounded outdated even to him.
“Yeah. I’m real sorry, Tony.” He mutters, too low for him to hear, gut clenching as his eyes drop to the floor.
Steve officially meets Pepper Potts two days later. He’d just finished his run on the treadmill when he catches her chastising Tony in the kitchen. He’s sweaty and panting, but he’s also hungry. It also looks like he’d just cut them off from something important.
His brain supplies, growling and snarling at the Omega just outside the door. But that’s all instinct, instinct that would subside in the coming days.
“I let you have me as you needed.” Stevos says. “If that meant a friend you could tell your woes to, a silent shadow or a sexual partner, I was glad to fill those roles.”
From there, he’d gone where he was needed, capturing bases and intel from Nazi stations and halting their progress on their men, destroying and delaying as best they could. The sense of purpose drove him to wake up, grit his teeth, and do what needed to be done even if it meant killing other men.
money. But it’s not much to live on, unless you do it every night. I think you’re a nice one though. The nice ones get picked up by an Alpha around here, then they never come back, or they become not-so after a while.” She shrugs.
“It is, I think.” Steve replies, finding himself wondering what Tony is thinking. He has a good idea, but he would prefer not to assume. A Fight state takes a lot out of an Alpha, mentally tiring, like a headache, he’s been told.
It feels both light and heavy, cool against his heated skin. Once Tony steps back, he tips his head to look up at him, hoping that Tony can see how grateful he is for the necklace.
Tony nods but doesn't press for more, looking satisfied by the answer and maybe that what presses Steve to go on.
“To Sir's cabin lounge.” Is what he gets, Steve does feel the disapproving tone from just that, and then Steve's phone gets an alert in his email box (Ebox? Inbox? But messages are different than in his regular phone’s messages?). Perhaps JARVIS had at least presumed his curiosity, but there were files upon files of the news articles from the days prior, all with the headlines “TONY STARK ATTACKED” or similar, boldly titled.
The hot plate, of course, is right on a work desk. Steve places a couple strips of bacon and sets it on a low sizzle. “Yup! Jarvis told me where it was. It’s amazing! Like a little moveable stove.” Steve comments happily, making sure the heat isn’t on too high, preferring his bacon chewy and juicy, before he remixes the pancake batter he’d used earlier just so that the flour wouldn’t clump together again.
“Is that a Nokia? Oh my god, they actually gave you the indestructible phone.” He could hear the horror in Tony’s voice from across the room.
pay off, I know it.” Tony throws back, biting viciously into his apple. “But I’m not making any more weapons for them, Pep, I just won’t.”
“We’ve already compiled a short list of Alphas we think would be compatible for you, and if you think you’re up to it, we could go over the list.”
The Alpha looks older than Andrew, dark hair to match, youth stripped away and what’s left is sharper eyes and a stubborn jaw, yet there’s something similar in their eyes and mouth. A certain guarded kindness.
“If you could hold it up towards the northwest corner of the room, on your left, that would be optimal, Captain.”
Fight or flight, that was what it came down to, and most of the Alphas stood their ground and fought, ‘til their pride became the death of them, along with their squad.
“Beautiful.” Stevos says eyes stuck to the view of Tony’s ass, adding a fourth finger that has Tony mumbling for relief. He’s hard again, like holy fuck he shouldn’t already be hard again but he is, erection straining between his legs, dripping for attention.
Natasha casts Clint a sympathetic look, turns to Steve. “Today’s progress was good. That’s one hideout down, the rest we can hunt until they scatter like rats.” Sounds like a promise. Or a mission.
Even if it’s mostly the weather, and experts saying how the economy is 'stable’, he gets a few tidbits about the different things that make him feel at least slightly connected to the outside world.
“Tonight?” He blathers. “Oh. But we have to make sure he is thoroughly cleaned and groomed to your liking, wouldn’t want to-”
He almost does, halfway through the motion before there’s suddenly a hand on his arm, prying it down, actually bending the metal and titanium as Stevos gives him a hard look, angrier than Tony has ever seen him.
The reply comes quickly, in form of an email that pings on his cell phone. It’s a yes, to Steve relief, along with an attached file that Phil insists Tony sign and emailed right back to him. There’s also a carefully worded message that, should Tony be pressuring him into anything, he ought to tell Phil immediately and he can pick Steve up, no questions asks.
He finds himself with a new phone (Stark Phone 2). Steve is upset (pouts) for a total of five minutes before Tony takes pity on him and explains the features. Apparently he can write emails and use the internet on his phone instead of his laptop, everyone else does it that way, Tony insists.
“That’s stupid. I didn’t do it because I was an Omega. I volunteered because I wanted to save lives. I went through the experiment because the Doctor believed it would worked. I-I crashed the plane because I didn’t see any other way. I didn’t think I’d get to live through it.” He admits. He feels guilty, he doesn’t deserves that look, not when he’s been such a coward.
Steve obeys, pulling his shirt up just enough to expose his nipples to the chilly breeze. Tony makes quick work of the display, latching a mouth to one nipple, while he uses his free hand to twist and worry the other.
Natasha has that part covered, already in the control room of the building, retrieving locations and names from their database and forwards it to SHIELD for immediate operation. Steve has no doubt Brock will be taking one of those location, with his pack system and Omega on the team, it would be difficult not to feel disgusted.
He’d read about homosexuality. Where it was fine these days when an Alpha-Alpha pair were married, or an Omega-Omega pair for that matter. Steve had never really thought them any ill, there were secretive pairings back in his neighborhood, and he’d wished them the best like any other couple.
“Very well, I shall schedule a driver to pick you up at your location.” And it must say something about how well Steve is acclimating to JARVIS that he doesn’t bother confirming if the AI knew where he was. “The Stark jet is available for your comfort, it will be waiting at the airport upon your arrival.”
“Amazing.” Stevos whispers, his fingers playing Tony’s beard, so intimate a gesture, and kisses him on the nose. “My brave Anthony, they will sing your name is praises, your image will be known throughout the world.”
“Why not? You’re a god, aren’t you? Can’t you do whatever the hell you want?” Tony challenges, raising a brow at Stevos.
His first orgasm hits when Ed pinches and squeeze his nipple. It suprises him, his fingers smooth and warm, his vision whites out and squeezes tightly on the grunting Alpha behind him, coming on the bed. Vaguely, he hears Ed’s voice, probably a narration of techniques but Steve blocks that out.
He brings up his gaze to look at Tony, so close, with his scent right there, warm brown eyes anchoring him on the spot.
Steve takes in a breath. He doesn’t know how to explain to Tony that he can’t just fit himself into his world, that he barely felt like he fit in his own rendition of the world right now. He can’t just let himself be swept away by what Tony wanted for him, as good as his intentions were, that just wasn’t how Steve was.
His own Ironman suit is dented in more places than one, and it’s a pain to remove each and every plate from his body. Bruises blossom from his skin, no doubt they will be worse in the morning. He shuts down the lab and clambers into his bedroom.
Brock sighs. “Then go ahead and disappear off into your rabbit hole. I’ll take care of Steve here for the time being.”
There's a car waiting for him, without a driver which Steve takes as a curious sign. He gets into the driver seat, and no sooner than he buckles his seat belt does JARVIS's cool voice fill the car. “If you don't mind, Captain. I'll handle the steering wheel for the drive.” And with that, the car purrs alive and they rumble off.
“You’re looking at the very first prototype generator for the arc reactor. The first step into commercializing clean energy. Stark Tower was just a pet project, a hello world to the world about what my little baby can do.” Tony enthuses, patting the generator on it’s hood. “At least, she will be once I put her through her paces.”
“Oh honey. It’s all very complicated. Things that only adults should be worrying about, okay? I’ll explain when you’re older, but right now you need to go with those men, like we talked about last night, remember? While I was packing all your things?”
to check up on me than those iffy doctors who’ll probably stick something cold and impersonal up my ass for whatever reason. Since you suggested it, I expect you to take full responsibility, and make sure I am in one hundred percent working order.”
It’s a pleasant surprise when he does drink, the chocolate just short of scalding, warmth enough to stave off the slight chills of Fall. Not that Steve has felt truly cold, not since the serum, but he could imagine the comfort it would bring. He moans into the drink, taking in gulps, the little marshmallows are kind of like sugar cubes, he muses, popping sweetly in his mouth with little crunches. He’s suddenly sorry that he hadn’t added more.
“It’s a small detail, no really, I’ve been thinking about changing the floor anyway, this one isn’t even reinforced to take the Ironman suit. Actually, in hindsight, I could have at least brought one that would be a match for you.” Tony goes off. “Clearly something has upset you enough to belay your usual good manners and decide to make me rethink about my poor choice of cars.”
“Can’t help it, can he? With what he is, makes sense cos you’re just about the most distressing Omega ever to walk the streets’a Brooklyn. Has his work cut out for him.”
Three hours into the flight, Steve feels the first vestiges of restlessness and walks around to inspect the plane.
They sit in amicable silence for a while, Steve taking his time with his drink now, afraid that as soon as he finishes, he’d have to say something, nervous about the topic at hand.
Didn’t stop the Alphas in the military from thinking about it though. Or letting him know about it too.
“We can change the activation codes. Any word or keyphrase you’d like, I thought we’d go basic and somewhat serious. Honestly, we can still go with ‘Thundercats ho’ if you’d like, catch and release words. I’d also kind of like to toy with the idea of an electromagnetic field, for deflecting metal debris and bullets, probably. Or at least iron-based bullets, An EMP blast would be fine too, I’m still working on an EMP shield for the suits, it would be nice to test things out with that.” Tony rambles on while Steve catches his breath.
With every moment that passes, Stevos seems to have a harder time controlling himself, he’s already started grinding his hips against Tony’s, hands pulling him closer to rub their lengths through the cloth of their jeans.
.” John adds in, a smirk as he stretches out his legs. “Better pick something you don’t mind being called over and over again. But an Alpha’s brain loses any form of higher thinking once their knot shows. Poor things, really.” He peers over the window. “Ahh, looks like our first customer.” He waves at the window and Steve turns to look as well.
It’s often that he asks himself, why? Why did all this people choose to carry his symbol in the most mundane things possible? Coffee mugs and the like, seemed pointless in the grand scheme of things.
The vision had come so vividly to him, and it had hurt more than the water forcing itself in his lungs and freezing over, the dread in those nightmares was nothing compared to the realization that he was dreaming, and that he had to wake up soon.
“I didn’t expect you to wear it all the time. Not on missions anyway.” Tony quickly dismisses. “By the way, was your latest mission the twenty third or the twenty fourth?”
Steve would wake up with that sense of dread, that that world was gone now, and all that was left were his memories of them.
It’s almost ironic that he enjoys getting lost in the street, going for whatever catches his eyes, picking through alleyways and sidestreets.
“We got our wish.” Stevos chuckled bitterly. “There was calamity in the lands, unusual tremors and storms. Demi-gods from the lands were called to the citadel, monster brought havoc to the smaller towns, causing chaos and killing anyone that crossed their path, but there was something larger afoot.” Stevos’s gaze was far, holding onto a distant memory, Tony can’t even imagine what he’s seeing, except it mustn't be good with how distraught the god looks.
Not only was he super confused, he was in a hell of a lot of pain. Every time Steve breathes in it felt like he'd been stabbed in the heart (which you could say he was.) the last time Steve could remember feeling pain like that was after his Mum died and Bucky found him his having his worst asthma attack to date.
So Natasha took over for Tony, explaining that he seemed to be in shock but questioned him to what the problem was and why'd he have Steve's phone.
If the doctors are quick enough Steve may be able to come through. After all he’s got so much to live for, hasn’t he? Even if he makes it through, his best friend was pissed off at him. Steve could be sure that he’d still want to be best friends. Nat and Sam barely have anything to do with him anymore, his roommate was barely an acquaintance... and the love of his life doesn’t love him like he used to.
Banging on the door he began shouting for Steve, he needed Steve to be there, to talk things over. He needed to remind Steve how much he loved him. There was so much to he needed to tell Steve but he didn't know what to say.
Tony, slowing down his sobbing, was ushered into the room by Nat, who was always the more friendly one towards him. When trying to explain the events of the night all the trio heard was a bunch of babble.
The doctor came over and began to explain what she new about the accident. Tony felt so much pain when she said that according to a witness Steve was walking across the road while a car came speeding down sending Steve flying.
He got to the restaurant in no time, and if he was driving slightly above the speed limit so what. His boy was the most important thing right now. If Steve was there maybe
The night was getting on and all of this crying was making Steve tired. Every time he managed to stop his crying he would find something that reminded him of Tony to only start crying again. He thought that by now he would have nothing left to cry. He checked his watch, he'd been sat there for at least
"Shit, Jarvis. Tell me I haven't missed the date with Steve I planned to make it up to him" Jarvis didn't need to respond, Tony already knew the answer. " I believe you did Sir" Fuck, Tony didn't need that sort of attitude right now. What was he going to do.
While they prayed and hoped to see Steve again, in the surgery room things where looking unfortunate. Too much blood being lost, becoming stable, then unstable. It was a whirlwind.
"Hu...rt.  h..hurt" Steve managed to finally say just before his breathing becoming harsher and shorter and blacking out. Nurses and doctors frantically rushing him to theatre as his heartbeat slowly deteriorates.
This is why Steve was sat in his favourite Italian restaurant, because Tony had promised to make it up to him, promised that it was the last time that would happen, Steve was going to be his priority. What a fool he was, really Steve did you really believe he would take a minute our of his day for you. What does a man like that want with a stupid, untalented, broke guy like him can't forget broken, from his naivety from previous relationships.
Bucky was kicking himself, regret was his only companion at the moment. What a dick he was to Steve and he might not even get to see him again let alone apologize for everything.
In Tony's Lab he was working on a little gift for Steve. To be completely honest he's been working on it since their 1 year anniversary. He knew how much Steve loved painting and drawing but was shy and insecure about it, Tony knew how worked up Steve could get over one of his assignments. the first painting Tony had seen was A) by accident and B) of him.
Perhaps he should phone Bucky, he's sure that Bucky mentioned during the week that Sam and Nat wasn't being allowed over as he needed to study for his test next Monday.
I mean I'm shit at summaries, it just continues from the previous chapter and may be sad as you could of guessed from the title.
Steve rung him for the 5th and final time after leaving 2 voicemails, if he didn't answer he was going to leave. It went straight to voicemail. Apologising to the waitress for the time wasted Steve set off, not entirely sure where to go or what to do he decided a nice trip to the park seemed like a decent idea. Before he left he made sure there was a tip left for the trouble he caused (even if it was his fault). Moving through the double doors of the exit, Steve's never felt shitter than he is right now.
Making it to the floor that the guy on the phone said they rushed to the  reception desk. "Steven Rogers.... we're hear to see a Steven Rogers" was the first thing Tony said or did when he got there. Thankfully the nurses under stood him and sent to get the doctor who tending to him after had given him their information.
In Tony's eyes Bucky did not look happy to see him. That must be a sign that Steve was here, normally Bucky looked like he at least tolerated him.
When Tony was woken up, Jarvis was alerting him that he had been locked down in his lab for 60 hours. how has he spent two and half days down here. The first thing tony did when he emerged from the lab was jump in the shower, you don't realise how sweaty and gross you get when your focused on something else. After a quick shower, Tony decided he should call Steve, to see what he was up to and if he wanted to come over now he had finished the ring. He couldn't wait to give it to Steve, once the studio is done he can present them both to Steve. See the way his eyes light up when happy, the cute little smile and the way he blushes. Sinful. Tony went over to his phone and noticed he had several missed called from Steve and 3 voicemails. He was confused, had something happened.
Phoning Bucky's number he was already on the verge of tears. What was he going to say, since the first 'forgetting' incident the trio had been uncertain of Tony, convince that he was using Steve for his 'Youth' and would neglect Steve's needs. Which Steve wouldn't believe for a second.
So Bucky trudged his way through the mess on the floor, there was too much in the way earlier with no time to move it all. Once the door was opened he was face to face with
around the apartment was a good idea , even when Steve was home he was made to stay in his room and have to shout to check if they were decent.
So Bucky confess what happened between him and Steve. Only to get lectured by Sam and Nat about how he should have put Steve first because they're argument was over something small and silly. Like he didn't already know by now.
Tony had first introduced him to it when Steve was struggling with his Art essay. Steve had called Tony crying, not knowing what to do. He had been tired but also adamant that he could go to sleep until he finished his essay, while there was a loud ass party in the flat above distracting him.
3 hours. 3 HOURS, that's how long Steve waited for Tony. It was so embarrassing, sitting in the Italian restaurant that not only did Tony book but also promised Steve for a special night out as they haven't been able to see much of each other recently.
Tony spent ages organising a room for Steve in a studio where he could go to have space and be free to be creative, a space to hang and place any inspirations to paint (hopefully many photos of him and Tony), a place where he didn't have any restriction on where he painted and how careful he had to be with the paint. (Steve had to be carful of any of his stuff getting paint on it, that's what you get when you get the smaller room of the apartment).
Tony thought. Cause there was no chance he was going anything but the quickest he could. That's pretty fast despite what his age may suggest.
Steve couldn't blame him, he was running Stark Industries and spent majority of the time either in meetings or developing new incredible designs for technology even if he promoted Pepper to be CEO, Tony can't just sit around and not do anything (This was one of the many things Steve loves about him).
Knocking both Bucky and Sam's arms they all looked. When Tony still didn't move or do anything. Nat took the phone off him to speak to Steve. She was shock to hear an unfamiliar voice. "Sir.. are you still there sir."
Not worrying about showing up in style, he takes the closet car from the garage to the restaurant hoping that Steve was still there, while Jarvis was trying to get through to Steve's phone.
So he learnt that Steve had been waiting there for 3 hours and left at 9PM which was unfortunately an hour ago. He was ultimately screwed, he couldn't even get ahold of Steve, the only other option was to contact Steve's friends. The first place and probably only place Steve would go was to Bucky's.
Tony didn’t know what to say, he had so much regret and worried in his mind and heart that he didn’t know what to do with himself. Constantly thinking if he’d remembered then this wouldn’t have happened. Hell if he’d of priorities Steve from the beginning they wouldn’t of been in this mess.
It was a painting of him working down at the lab, smiling because of something Steve said to Dum-E. Turns out Steve wasn't aware he left it out and was stumbling over his words when he noticed Tony had seen it. About how it wasn't that good and it was silly for him to leave it where someone could see. Tony had asked if it was for his assignment and he's never seen Steve look so doubtful and unsure of himself. That was when Tony knew he would do anything to proved to Steve he was amazing.
He greeted Bucky with his frantic panic, "I need to speak to Steve, please let me in I need to let him know how sorry I am, I'll change. I need to tell him he will always be my focus. Please. Steve. Steve, let me see him."
He listened to the first voicemail, Steve sounded so excited. "I'm nearly at the restaurant, I can't wait to see you. I've missed you so much and thank you for making it up to me, I understand you had work and I forgive you. See you soon, Love you. Bye".
and the look on everyone's face. Nat has a straight face, the look of no emotion which scared him the most
He was in so much pain, he hurt so much. He spent a long time just laying there. Crying. Shouting. But he was getting tired, no one was coming for him. Nobody Loved him. A little rest wouldn't hurt. Maybe when he woke up everything would be fine and Tony would love him again.
Once the nurses seen him try to open his eyes they were a tad bit hopeful but sadly it looked like they could barely be opened. A good sign was that he tried to speak, while keeping an eye on his heartbeat they rushed him down the corridor into a medical bay room.
Perhaps if he went for a walk he would be able to keep his mind off of it all. Only then did he realise it had been raining, he was completely soaked and haven't even noticed.
He fucked up. He loved his boy so much but he's fucking this up. Steve's friends were right he was no good for Steve, how could he be. None the less, Steve will always be his mouthy angel who saw the best in everything but would throw a punch to 'fight for what's right'.
All the while Bucky was becoming more and more confused. He was now joined by Sam and Nat who was intrigued by all the racket. "What are you on about, why isn't steve with you?" Bucky asked for clarification.
After that explanation Bucky felt terrible, shit. Steve had most likely phoned Bucky for comfort and needed Bucky and what did he do. Okay maybe Bucky was a little harsh on Steve. Ah fuck. He needed to be realistic, he things he said was awful. Fuck he regretted everything he said and now needed a way to make it up to Steve. But it seems that he was second in line for that.
But Steve has always been there for Bucky and vice versa. Best friends always have each other's backs. Bucky is gonna know what to do and maybe they can have the ice cream in the freezer and cuddle up watching a film, maybe DoLittle he's been meaning to watch that.
Bucky woke up from from his slumber to some asshole banging on his door. He struggled to get untucked from Nat and Sam, after their make up session
Explain Steve's injuries however was the next step the doctor took. Explaining that he's gonna need a lot of support once he's out. While Bucky offered to take time from college, Tony stopped and insisted that Steve satay with him.
They all came to realise if Steve wasn't with Tony or with them, the big question was where was he. Tony told Bucky immediately to phone Peggy, cause surely he would have gone home and if they couldn't phone Steve, Peggy was the second best option. Tony was praying right now that he didn't know Steve as well as he thought. Steve would be at home and not out on the streets alone with just his thoughts.
So Tony took him to go this coffee shop that was out of the way and peaceful. He also helped him when he didn't know exactly to right or how to phrase a certain sentence. And now there may not even be phone calls, hell there may not even be a relationship anymore. Wiping his eyes with his sleeve Steve began to cross the road.
Repeating the information, Tony finally snapped he immediately rushed to his car with the others trailing behind him shouting that they were coming too.
Walking towards the exit of the park Steve registered how cliché it was. Heartbroken and walking in the rain, all he needed to do now is burst out in song and it be like the movies. Oh boy, here come the tears again.
Steve was sat quietly on the park bench trying his hardest not to cry. This afternoon was not going the way he planned. It was 9PM when Steve left the restaurant, he knew he couldn't go back to his apartment because Peggy had Angie, her girlfriend over.
“You love that don’t you.” Tony croons. The drag of the heavy girth around his walls is more than what Steve can take, he whimpers, mutters incoherent approval, muscles bunching together in the effort to take what Tony is giving, his legs so spread out that Tony can sit between his thighs with comfort, all the while pressing deep inside of him.
“The ice,” Steve continues, swallowing as he feels the shards pierce his skin. “the plane crashed, then there was water and I was drowning.” He hadn't expected to survive. Frankly, he doesn't know how to talk about it. His dreams are vivid but they aren't what had happened.
Steve still wonders. Would his father be proud of the man he became today? A question that would never be answered, yet he feels that it has shaped his life in its absence regardless.
Raza, the leader of the terrorists, hits him with the butt of his gun, his vision goes black as Tony drops to the cave floor.
Thor, who has a good grip on Loki, narrows his eyes at the nearest agent, who stutters that Fury wants to talk to him first.
Steve mulls that over. Tony Stark, possibly the last connection to the past he had. It almost felt like a trap. After a two months of sitting around, why had no one told him that Tony Stark existed? And then seeing him on this list? It all sounded too suspicious.
“You do not!” He can hear the scathing tones from the god, even while he swerves and ducks to avoid most of the gunfire, the rest scrapping off the Iron Man suit. “You do
“Not disagreeing, Steve.” Is another reminder, less patient. “But some choose it for themselves. A few do anyway. Those couple of kids back there? The ones that wanted to stay? Their families probably get a fee for them going along with it. And then an allowance for however long they stay with their buyer.” Clint speaks with controlled remorse. “Better than everyone going hungry, better than getting rejected for jobs day after day because you were born a certain gender.”
“Sleep it off?! My jaw feels like it’s going to fall off any minute and you tell me to sleep it off?!” He’s livid, glasses askew which makes him look even crazier than he already was. Thankfully, a couple of waiters start escorting Justin elsewhere with promises of medical attention.
“Mr. Stark would like you to know that he will join you within the hour, and asks if there is anything you might need him to bring.”
here and draw.” He sees Bucky let out a sigh, continues on, emboldened. “No ones gonna be looking at our pictures if a war’s going on. I’m not gonna let us both go hungry, not if I can do something about it. I can carry my own weight around here, Buck. Ain’t fair when you’re doing all the work for us.”
“It’s beautiful.” Steve has to say, because it is. As close as man and machine will ever be, form only ever to service its user, not a plate out of place.
It isn’t long before Tony spots the helicopter overhead, gets excited and starts yelling. The helicopter passes them, and then makes a turn. There are tears in his eyes as the reality that he’s going home sets in.
He then normally winds down with another trip to the gym, this time with weights and a couple of bags. They gave him a regimen for his training, something about researched efficiency. And while he nodded, and thanked them for their
Jasper leads him to another door, and stops right before it. “Your Omega is in this room. I feel like I should inform you of that first.”
Everyone gives him a wide berth, though there a few people who are friendly enough. When Nick Fury (Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) drops in and asks how he finds the agents, he tells him that they are all nice to him and he's glad that they can accommodate him while they are all so busy with their work. Which is the truth but all Nick does is stare at him that he wonders whether or not it was the right answer.
Steve just really looks at him. Late thirties if he had to guess, thick combed-down black hair and a growing belly underneath a plush coat. Steve just smiles. “No, sir.”
“They’re perfect for each other, together for at least seven years now, I think. Except Cara has a strong preference for Omegas in bed but they claim that they haven’t found the
Everything would go back to the way they were, while Tony went to answer the phone the trio became more relaxed. They could all breathe, the tension was gone and Steve was alright. After all this call must be good sign that everything everything was alright.
Reaching the streets Steve was beginning to get tired. He had to stay out all night so the best thing to do was go get coffee. He already knew the best coffee place to go, it was little and quiet but the best part was that it was open 24/7.
. He waited outside of Tony's 'little' house (more like mansion to Steve). What made it worse was that it was pissing down with rain. That's how he ended up cuddling Sam and Bucky on their big coach that night, while Natasha screamed down the phone at Tony.
And he couldn't believe how selfish he had been. Steve had been so worked up with his relationship drama that he'd forgot to ask how Bucky was.
"Steve...Hospital....accident....critical." Was all she made out. Steve, her poor Steve. Tears forming in her eyes lead both Sam and Bucky to be concerned. Natasha had never openly cried like that before. Looking at Tony she needed to snap him out of it.
Both Tony and Bucky looked at each other. As much as they didn’t like each other they both knew, they’d both do anything do Steve and how much they both truly loved him. Tears both in their eyes they both hugged each other, praying that Steve would be alright.
Bucky just looked at him unimpressed, he knew winning Steve back was a long shot but he'd try anything to even hope for Steve to give him another chance. Through a deep sigh he begged for Steve once more before dropping to his knees.
They all got bored of Steve eventually. At least he’d be with his mom who he knew loved him eternally.
With the sound of sirens drifting closer Steve closed his eyes to the thought of his love, who wouldn't be his love no more.
Bucky's was a bit different though. Tony was more confused by Bucky's face, it seemed to be a mix of anger, sadness and regret. Probably for ever letting Steve be with him.
This was the final strike. The waitress came over to ask if he was sure he wanted to wait to order, I suppose its makes him look lonely, sad or crazy waiting for someone for that long but he just wanted to give Tony a chance to prove him wrong, that Tony does care about Steve and wouldn't forget about him.
Steve Rogers, Sarah's little Stevie. Used to come in with his mum and take cookies to the rest of the doctors and nurses. Poor thing barley managed to visit anymore, after his mums death she never saw him until now in such events. She was called away and left the other doctors attend to his injuries
He had planned this date. Wine and dine Steve. Show him how much he loved him, every inch of him. Hold him tightly in his arms and never let go. After the first time Steve called him out on his bullshit and saw through his asshole façade he knew he was down for the long ride.
He felt a lot calmer since his call with Steve, he had so much going on he felt slightly guilty for snapping at him like that but who could blame him, his own relationship was on the line, he didn't have the time.
It was all such a rush, next thing Tony knows is a hospital bed is being wheeled past him into the surgery room with Steve on. He looked awful, face bruised and bloody. His poor boy Hirt so bad and it was all his fault.
So did it matter if he didn’t pull through surgery. As his heart rate slowed, the doctors are gonna have to make a big decision.
His eyes are a bit blurry from all the crying which was also making him dizzy , he needed to pause for a minute before he fell or something.
When Bucky answers though his train of thought switches immediately. "Look I can't talk right now Steve, I'm dealing with my own relationship at the moment so I don't want to hear about Stark or how the date went. Maybe try opening your eyes to your friends problems as well. We can't all be a billionaires booty call."
Hope you like it. Sorry I took so long to post a new chapter, I’ve got a lot of essays I have to write thanks to quarantine. :)
also thanks for the lovely comments, I wasn't sure if I was goin to continue this but looks like I am.
That's why Tony's idea of him staying over was brilliant. No having to shoved earplugs into his ears or blast his music loudly through his headphones, he also gets to have fun with tony
He just sat there as the call was ended. One by one the tears began to stream down his face. He was alone, phone turned off, sat in the dark surrounded by nothing but his thoughts. What a night.
If he was to go back to his apartment now, there was no way in knowing what he would walk in on. Plus he promised her that he would be out for the night and she had gotten so mad last time he walked in on them because Angie had felt to awkward to stay, so he didn't want a repeat of that.
Once in the Med bay the doctors and nurse was analysis his injuries, he seemed to be in pretty bad shape, the main doctor treating him recognized his name and face.
Military, he can see it in his stride, the kind that gets drilled into you with months of repetition. Steve had never really gotten it down, thrown into the field of battle far too quickly to allow any kind of habit to form, but he saw it in the men he fought with, and his squad. Knowing the man is the military is hardly any comfort, especially with Tony's history with them.
“I- Uh. Adrenaline? Still shaking it off, post traumatic stress? I’m getting old?” Tony says, distracted, eyes darting from Rhodey to behind him, on the floor, on some rubble, anywhere but Stevos. Rhodey at least looks sympathetic.
“Please. Don’t.” And then Steve is laughing. Laughing harder than he can remember and it’s not even really that funny.
an Omega’s arousal, and outside of that Omegas were rarely knotted if it weren’t to make pups. An Omega wasn’t suppose to get wet if the Alpha didn’t want it, the only exception was for heat, the Omegas biological signal to look for a mate.
There’s a flurry of bidding, and the blonde Omega is quickly worth two hundred fifty in just a few minutes.
“Of course, we’ll talk soon, Marlow.” Tony eases in, taking the attention away from Steve. Marlow, the Beta, looking honestly concerned when Steve’s jaw tightens. “You better catch up with Cara before she realizes you’re gone.”
There’s no one with him on the plane, no one had met him on the runway. Once he had seated himself, the doors closed, the engines started and off they flew. Better this way, he thinks, the solitude appreciated as he devoured the news.
“My Omega has told me that you’ve taken his things. I’d like you to get them for me. Now.” He demands, because he can.
There’s a pregnant pause, a hum like JARVIS was thinking. Steve understood that JARVIS was like a computer, an Artificial Intelligence that
so he doesn’t know where that misconception might have from and Tony is in no sense a small man. It’s all sleek curves and lines, deceptively lean design that hides its strength among other things. Compared to a tank, the suit looks incredibly lightweight and agile, which Steve doesn’t doubt, nor does he doubt the amount of firepower it actually conceals.
He shifts to his knees when Tony becomes impatient, rubbing his cock against Steve’s thigh in aborted movements.
“Which reminds me. I’ve got this gala-charity thing on Saturday, wanna make it a little less boring and be my plus one? I can promise good food.”
There’s a sketch of the dildo in Tony’s tidy lines, detailing the appropriate buttons to be pressed to turn it on. There are three buttons on the dildo, two of them controlled the speed of which it
It tastes like grass and rust, with an almost sterile aftertaste that follows, reminds him of hospitals.
“Yes, of course. We wouldn’t dream of pushing anything forward without your explicit consent. The list already contains Alphas whom will help integrate you into society, we can go over the list when you think you’re ready and conduct a Scenting to see if you’re compatible.”
“First of all, I’d like to say that it is an honor, to be speaking with you. I’ve been a fan of your work for as long as I can remember.”
It takes Stevos fifteen minutes to convince him that they should take a bath together. Damn the god’s stamina, all Tony wants is to pass out in bed, but he relents when Stevos casts those stupidly beautiful blue eyes on him.
And then there’s ragged breathing, broken and pained that breaks the silence, hands curling over his back, pulling him in close, a sob in his ear where Tony’s head lay.
“Taking an interest, son?” Howard barks, laughs as he pulls Tony back down to his seat. Tony hadn’t even realized he’d gotten up, his thoughts were focused on getting a better look of the Omega.
Natasha’s contribution is vodka. While Steve isn’t sure he can get drunk on it, and even though Steve tells Natasha as much, she gets a gleam in her eyes that he isn’t sure how to read.
As soon as Tony leaves, or if he never showed up in the first place, Steve does some reading in his room. After lunch, he keeps busy with another workout session, and practices what Natasha taught him. There’s no firing range in the mansion (It would have been strange if there was), so instead he takes that time to draw on the sketchbook Happy got him.
“The flight’s about-” Happy checks his watch. “Five hours if we’re lucky. Just in time for dinner. As soon as the crew is down with pre-flight, then we’re out of here.” Sensing Steve’s discomfort, but plainly not knowing what to do with it, motions towards the back of the plane.
face-to-face. He could appreciate that, a very human gesture, he liked to think that he was a good judge of character and could tell if he liked someone within the first five minutes or so, like he used to do.
“It means,” Natasha butts in, elbowing Clint hard on the side. “that I was sent in to see if he’s of any use for S.H.I.E.L.D.. I reported what I saw, someone else does an evaluation alongside mine, and a decision is made.” She casts a furtive look at the screen.
He had gone over with Natasha’s words in mind, pretended to trip over one of the Alphas and then used his ‘
“Feed him your cock.” And Andrew does, shucks off his own pants and lines himself up to Steve’s mouth.
It doesn’t stop the bit of sadness that comes from with it, as he sinks back into SHIELD in newly formed determination. He focuses on that instead, on being useful, as he goes through bags on a daily basis, punching away at them as much as his frustration with allow. Learning as much as he can from the people around him.
He takes his time shading in the muscle, the hint of power in the relaxed muscle, promising strength yet choosing not to use it. He lets his pencil glide over the page, unhurried. Each fold in clothing is given the same attention, alternating between light and hard strokes to compensate for the lack of color. (Lead is good enough.)
“Ugh. When will Richards give up? He tries something new every week and it always ends up a disaster, christ. Why won’t Susan just break up with him already?”
“Not really.” He answered. He was sick most of the time, unable to leave the confines of his bed at worst, his Heats came sparingly, sometimes only once a year as compared to the regular three times that a normal
“Stevos, I need to come.” Tony moans, a jolt of pleasure shaking his voice when Stevos hits his prostate again.
He must have said it aloud, feels his cheeks heat up at Tony’s comment. There’s something with Tony’s voice too, softer, less barbed with distrust (or was it because of the scent in his head?)
Steve couldn’t hope to take in all of the Alpha’s cock, stopping just short of his knot, but he could damn well try.
Tony tentatively touches Stevos’s length, curved proudly upwards with a drop of pre-cum just at the tip. He licks his lips and looks up for permission before he dives right in.
