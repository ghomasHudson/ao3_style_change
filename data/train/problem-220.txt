“She works beneath Marcus and found out about the invitation unintentionally.  She is interested in Lestat’s escapades and the extensive file that the organization keeps on my Maker.  She sees this as a means of possibly garnering access to vampires.  It is the folley of a young inexperienced agent that has proven to be our advantage.” David paused, reiterating ineffectually, “We are lucky to have met with anyone.”
The urge to punch out the obnoxious intruder was quickly bubbling up. "You obviously want me to entertain you in some fashion but won't get around to the point. Should juggling suffice?"
With his maker’s arm about his shoulders and their steps paced in time with one another, they walked down the street, the whisking away to the penthouse somewhat forgotten now that they were enjoying the proximity.  Louis's eye were downcast, watching the contrast of leather with worn canvas converse runners on his own feet, the two of them together working as naturally as Lestat had always fancied they should.
Several minutes had passes since the call from John had been so abruptly ended.  Time in which anything could have happened.  For once in his life he tried not to ascertain the numerous different probable outcomes that could have transpired.  He did not want to know.
David brought his hand up to take his maker’s hand from his face.  “I mean to only warn you.  This is a dangerous game you are setting up to play.  The board is bigger and far more complicated than you know.  There are many that could stop you, who are watching.”
Their eyes met. John’s eyes were glassy. Not with tears, for those would be blood if he were to shed any, but with the change. The iris’ glowed iridescent, lit from the back, like those of a feline, giving the man an animalistic appearance that no longer seemed alien to the detective. Within those eyes were still the same thoughts, the same fears, the same love. The vampire nodded his ascent and Sherlock leaned over and John inclined his head to allow their mouths to meet. Chaste. Short and sweet, lacking the lust of their previous unbidden grapples. This was familiar. This was how it had been and how it was meant to be
When Lestat had arrived at the mansion he had come with much different intentions than unannounced voyeurism, but that had all quickly changed when he had gone to make his usual grand entrance and the quickened pattering of a mortal heart was audible along side the more familiar vampirical beat of his fledgling’s.  This gave him pause. It was a wicked little delight to happen upon both his David and the elder Holmes brother entangled together. Both were far too engrossed in their activities to notice Lestat’s quiet entry. The older vampire had slipped through the partially opened French-styled doors of the home office space and was leaning casually, silent and still against the nearest bookcase. A shadow shielding the blond from the low light of the room and allowing him a spectacular vantage point to watch the show, completely unbeknownst to the two men.
he thought,
"Shit." The word slipped out as his peripherals started to frantically scan the entry for anything that could be used as a weapon against the intruder.
That seemed to only fuel the desire growing within Lestat for this mortal man.
When they both turned back, they could see the man’s gaze was on them. Sherlock could feel the scrutiny even though they were separated by more than fifty feet of bridge and courtyard. It was when Marisa’s head turned back, her gaze steady, blue eyes shining in the moonlight, that everything went dark.
Now the detective was offended.  “I don’t need your sympathy.” He tried to simply scoff.  It had come out more of a snarl—his game was off, given the recent morphine relapse—and he straightened his spine, squared his shoulders, and raised his chin before replying more coolly, “What an utterly useless gesture.  Your sympathy would benefit me in absolutely no single way.”
"She just...vanished." John said aloud, sounding befuddled by more than not being able to keep up with the woman.  Sherlock cocked his head and knit his brows, and John continued, with a shrug, "Well, I mean, not just anyone could do that.  It's as though her entire person transported somehow…somewhere else.  Scent and all.  All at once."
“Do you want this?” John all but breathed the words across the pulsing hardness he slowly pumped. His eyes travelled up the pale length of perfect skin that was his lover, admiring every single inch and wanting it all.
When the breeze shifted he caught the sudden and undeniable smell of blood and bleach, causing his nose to crinkle as he took immediate notice of the caution taped section of roadway and sidewalk in front of 221. A van was parked near the tape with its back doors open wide, as a man in rubber boots swept a spray of pressurized water back and forth over a patch of ash-fault and concrete, pushing the water away into the nearest sewer grate.
John had never been to Canada before and after escaping London, they had hired a private jet and come straight to Edmonton and the hovel in which they sheltered. Louis had been commanding and integral to his first couple of hours of vampirical life, taking care of everything that he needed. At first John had wondered, why Canada? Why this city? Perhaps convenience, ease of travel and accommodations. Louis was established here, at least to a certain extent, that much had been apparent from the beginning. Yet soon the more surprising answer had become clear.
John felt like a dart had pierced the back of his skull. The needle like point jamming between the atlas and axis of the skull and spine, instantaneously blackening his vision. The pain associated with such an affliction would be acute, yet his own pain now was a moment of piercing electric shock that subsided like the ebb and flow of the tide into something dull and aching.  Soon it was but a weight, a pressure that lingered on the vertebrae there, constant but no longer harmful. He raised his hand to the back of his neck, assessing, and finally relenting to massage the point. His muscles were taught, tensed from the experience, but otherwise there was no physical marking that he could feel that would denote a trauma to the area.
The vampire’s backside pivoted on the table, bringing his legs to dangle off the side before he jumped to the floor beside the detective. The sheet fell away and he paid it little regard.  As the perfect naked flesh of his backside was revealed, John stood with his back to Sherlock and admired the morgue that he recognized.  He seemed curious, appraising his surroundings as if he were unaware why or how he was here.
From the library Sherlock had quickly found the locked door, behind which John now slept.  It was a solid slab of steel, with no visible joint or rivet, thick enough to stop any kind of penetration.  It reminded him of a bank vault.  It was only more proof that during the day a vampire was incapacitated and therefore at their most vulnerable.
“It’s been covered up, Greg, and has to stay that way.” John began to lie, “I barely escaped and have been with protective services up until this point.  Sherlock is with me now and the governments trying to use us to get the people responsible.  It’s…well, it’s a case gone bad, is it what it is…and now we’re trying to fix it.”
“Shut up, Louis.” Armand cut him off softly.
Diplomacy was definitely out the window—as the other man’s brows folded down over top of those blazing eyes and he snarled back, “This is why I did not want you to know the truth, the gravity of the situation is beyond your realm of understanding!”  The bite in the sudden rise in Louis’ volume hurt his ear drums and the doctor winced.  Then the brows lifted a touch and the man added, “But I gave you my word and I will honor it.”  Earnest again, the voice seemed to plead once more for John to listen, to understand, to heed.  “He is what I have said he is.  An immortal, with the key interest of manipulating you and Sherlock as a means of entertainment.  He means the both of you harm and is more than capable of accomplishing it.”
“She was someone before she became Mary Morstan.  That much is obvious.” Mycroft pointed out, wanting to say more as he was cut off.
As he came up the steps his nostrils became acutely aware of the mingled tang of blood and antiseptic that perfumed the flat.  Rounding the doorway and coming into the kitchen he was assaulted with the reason why.  Outstretched on the table was the mangled carcass of what John thought must have been a pig.  The animal was on its back, hooved legs sticking straight up into the air, the large head dangling from the table’s edge, the fleshy neck torn open.  Congealed blood was smeared on the floor like a jar full of grape jelly had shattered everywhere and Sherlock was covered in it, from head to toe.  At least he had had the damned sense to wear an apron and some goggles.
vampire.  However, we are gathered here this night to bid a final adiue to this incredibly boring waste of flesh and bone.”
With a sigh, he stopped and tilted his head back, eyes closing as he allowed the downpour from the rain-drenched night continue to cascade over him. The cool water had long ago plastered his short hair to his skull and he was only now becoming aware of exactly how uncomfortably soaked he had become. There was an upside to this though, the rain was helping to clear his head faster and the long walk the flat would help even more. He began moving again, taking care to not walk into anyone this time.
“Ugh,” the inspector pulled the sleeve of his jacket and stripped shirt back to check his watch, “it’s half past five.”
"What happened, Sherlock?" John repeated in a quieter, more plaintive tone.
Sherlock refrained from looking up from the papers, laptop, and folders in front of him on the table.  All the vampire got in the way of a response, was a quickly mumbled, "Good evening to you too."
Sherlock mad a low sound of discontent as John’s mouth, the one that was layering so much pleasure on top of what they were already feeling left him. With a growl that rumbled deep in his chest, he tilted his own head and mouth flashing wide for a bare moment bit down into John’s shoulder.
“And what exactly are we going to play?”
When John failed to immediately supply an answer the consulting detective lost the little patience that he had. He shoved the vampire with supernatural force. As John stumbled backwards, he launched himself at his companion. John was so surprised by the detective's speed and strength that he didn’t try to defend himself. John didn’t feel a real threat in this space. His instincts were dulled by the conflicting emotions that roiled in the back of his mind and his gut.
Ignorance was a poor excuse, hard to believe, harder still to forgive.
Clenching his jaw, John struggled to contain his anger with the man. “I am not wearing a bloody dress!” He went so far as to stomp his foot down, trying to get the man’s attention. He had the feeling that it didn’t work when Sherlock didn’t even blink.
His eyes snapped to her, beyond the veil of his narrowed dark lashes, nailing her with his own reproof.  He blew the smoke into her face and callously reminded her, “John, is not my keeper and he is not here to polish my actions to tailor me properly for the satisfaction of others.”
"Boy, nothing gets past you." she said, with a shake of her head.
This deduction quirked the corners of the vampire’s lips and he thought of the consulting detective and his outrageous skills that had first piqued his interest and drawn him away from the North Carolina’s.  Besides being incredibly gifted of mind the detective’s greatest skill was that of simple observation—the skill of seeing and translating.  The vampire had just done the same thing, made a plausible conclusion based on a simple observation.  His eyes scanned the cherub’s face again, taking in the small supple mouth, pouted with intrigue, as those liquid caramel orbs watched him back.  Armand always wanted something and it was he himself that had admitted pursuit.
“I am.” Lestat replied acidly, walking away. "Something that you can trust, I will never forget."
John sighed and deciding that just maybe he did need the pick-me-up he snatched the mug of coffee and took a long slurp.  The bitter taste hit his palette and he grimaced.  Tea would have been preferable.
The answer was simple in Armand’s mind—whatever they choose to do. His attention was focused on ensuring that not only did he enjoy himself, which he of course did, but it was done by securing the smile that was sweetly turned his way on the pale lips of his evenings companion. Tendrils of raven hair had been left long and gently flitted across sharded emerald eyes.
One way or another the detective knew he would unravel this mystery that was vampirism, whether John helped with that or not.
what I am doing.” He had ground out each word, shaking with agitation, as he explained, “If you have yet to work it out, Lestrade, which I have no doubt that you have not, Mary-Morstan-is-dead.  John is not.  Therefore, I am clearly not looking for a woman I know is deceased, I am looking for John.”
Sherlock leant close, his nose grazing hers. His lips curled back and in a low growl he scornfully spat, “You. Disgust. Me.” Each word was pointed, filled with thorns, rolling off his tongue with malice and bite.
“What if I told you that you could escape from all of this…”
Lestat’s grip on the detective’s neck tightened and lifted, bringing a wicked mirth to the vampire’s lips, as the man’s toes struggled to touch the floor. It had been a palpable threat and even though maker and fledgling could not share internal dialogue, John got the message loud and clear. In mercy or perhaps theatrics, Lestat brought the man down low enough that they were eye to eye, before he licked the perimeter of the detective’s red-stained mouth.  He smacked his lips together and gave a satisfied cluck of his tongue.  “He is irresistible, isn’t he?  There is something to be said for the bouquet of a Holmes’ blood.”
John collected the putrid coating of the remnants in his mouth and spat. Then he wiped at his mouth and hauled himself back into the seat, panting with both exhaustion and the need to feed, a terrible mix that made his head hurt.
No messages.  No phone calls.  No word from John.  He gnashed his teeth together and tossed the useless piece of technology across the room.  It clattered noisily across the floor and under a chair.
Sherlock was still curious about the amulet that she had somehow managed to shove down Moriarty’s throat while they were all distracted by the gruesome spectacle the demon was making of the pair of them, but he was unable to say a word before the girl blinked out of existence, with a chipper final salutation, “It’s been a splice, boys.” As she teleported to wherever it was the mysterious organization kept these powerful ancient relics, the detective doubted he would ever see her again.
When David spotted the blond it was already too late for the woman he had thought to spare. He saw her lifeless body lying on the rooftop of the building she had been seeking shelter in. Lestat stood next to her and it was all David could do not to let his rage over-ride his reason as he approached his maker. The woman hadn’t even been drained, her neck was snapped and Lestat was staring at her dead body.
“I wouldn’t worry.  She thinks you’re genetically endowed with such desirable attributes.” Sherlock confirmed for his friend.
“Well thank you, now would you be so kind as to help me take the rest in? I’m afraid I’ll drop the eggs next and they won’t do near as well as the damned oranges.” Though her tone was trying to stay cheerful, it was easy to hear her frustration.
“This is above me, Sherlock.” Mycroft’s soft voice broke his meandering thoughts, bringing him back to the disastrous reality that he was facing.  John had indeed been taken, to where and for what purpose still unknown, by who still a mystery.  Mycroft could not help, had done all that he could do.  It was up to him.
That explained a lot.  The headaches, the feeling of being watched, the feeling of intrusion that had overcome him in the nights leading up to the penthouse debacle.  It had all been Lestat trying to break in.
"He--yuh!" John’s indignation was stifled by a yelp as Lestat's arm lock tightened with the sickening sound of flesh and joints being squeezed. Like a nut in the hold of a slowly tightening vice, the fledgling vampire, weakened as he was, was hapless to do anything about it. Lestat's expression hadn't changed and Moriarty only continued to be amused with his well laid plans.
“There in lies the risk.” Sherlock confirmed.  “Ludvik ordered Mary’s death. Marisa was true there. Despite Moriarty’s agenda, getting the stone away from Ludvik is imperative. We just need to control the stone after that point.”
"At least your putting up a bit of a fight. Though Lestat tried there was no chance for him. I had my fingers so deep inside my little Angel I think I lost a ring. Such patience was required, and he was so painfully eager he almost botched it up a time or two, thinking he could have a will of his own again. Sad really." Moriarty was reveling in his triumph, lording it over his captive audience.
John’s lips compressed into a thin line before he hastily smoothed out his expression. He fought the urge to rub the back of his hand against his skirt in disgust. Thankfully, the man didn’t try to mouth any other part of John as they turned and began to descend the steps.
John shrugged and replied very simply, “Depends on what you’ve accomplished, I guess, now doesn’t it?”
Sherlock felt a pit in his stomach at the words and he parted his dry lips to reply, only to be cut off by the blond. "It honestly wouldn't matter if you didn't. Now, you have had a rather rough day, I think, so while you rest up and try to rationalize what has happened I am going to run a little errand. I’ll save you the bother of looking for a way to contact someone, I’ve taken the liberty of relieving you of your phone. The closest human is further away than you could reach in your state and… well, I wouldn’t want to spoil all your fun. I’ll let you try to figure out what country you’re in while I’m away.” He raked his fingers through the golden mane of hair.  The man looked even more impossibly and infuriatingly beautiful through the hazy focus of the drugs in Sherlock’s system.
Moriarty’s eyes widened, and he nodded his head.  “Yes!” he squealed, excitedly, as he lifted his hands out to the detective and asked, “Wasn’t that just thrilling!?  Did you get my brains out of your coat?  I always loved that coat of yours, with your lapels cocked up to show off those cheek bones of yours.”
It had been their equally keen minds that had drawn the two together back then and the dark-haired man with the watery-grey eyes, for all of his aloofness was painfully curious to know what secrets the older 'Classified Adviser' had. The first time they had found each other naked on the floor, sweaty and panting, had seemed to surprise both of them. They had been going over details for a case that David had been asked to liaison for.  He was artfully dodging pointed question after question, when Mycroft had suddenly grabbed him by the collar and kissed him. In all honestly, the thought had occurred to him a few times that shoving his tongue in the mans mouth would be the most intriguing way to shut his snide assumptions up and so, when the other had initiated, he retaliated in a heart-beat.
Sherlock coiled his tongue around one of his fangs, the canine cutting a line across the centre. Blood filled both of their mouths in an instant. They both cried out at the sweet tang, mouths beginning to duel once more. With that first taste of crimson on his tongue the last thread of control he’d had snapped and all thought of John leaving was gone. He was ravenous, his own tongue coiling around the wound, drawing it into his mouth and sucking the minor cut, drawing more of that delicious taste to him.
"Mm, yes." Lestat sat on the edge of the bed next to the half-naked detective and smiled as he watched the man begin to access his new surroundings. "You're rather fond of it. I should have been more considerate and taken some to go. Easy enough to correct if you truly desire but I'd much rather enjoy your fully attentive company.” He smiled at the brunet and reached out to turn the gaunt face towards his own.
“That would be a shame. I’m rather attached to it.” Lestat replied coolly, relaxing as best he could, while he considered his next course of action. He was being allowed to leave, he knew that much, and from what he gathered, he could have Sherlock so long as he didn’t kill him or turn him.
John raised his arm over his head, signaling a cab much too Sherlock's chagrin.  In a quiet voice, the vampire replied, "You don't wanna' know."
It took the detective a moment to rationalize and conjure a response, to fight past the lust of their love making, to form an answer.  “Since…since the day… I jumped.” He panted back.
Why else would he have so brusquely forgone a subtle reintroduction into the doctor's life?  He couldn't wait for societal nuances and acclimations to be met.  It would have torn him apart to be in London and not be with John.  Mycroft, the idiot, had not failed to mention Mary Morstan, he had excluded her.  He had known about the woman all along, as part of his agreement to keep tabs on John Watson while Sherlock was in his employment.  His brother had sat there in Russia and watched him being beaten for the same reason why he had allowed Sherlock to be tackled by John in the restaurant, because he did not like to get his hands dirty.  He did not want to get involved.  He had no doubt suspected the outcome of that meeting and had no doubt watched in complete enjoyment as John nearly broke his nose with a well-aimed head bunt.
“There are no more resources for me to access when it comes to this matter, you should know, M.” David’s use of the pet name earned him the barest hint of something besides deep consideration of the next move. Mycroft took in a deep breath and looked at his companion with a tired expression.
John was still unsure how he felt about the detective and the ‘incident’.  What does one make of something like that?  What had possessed him to bite the damned fool?  He couldn’t even remember how it had happened, just being shoved off and the taste of the blood in his mouth.  When he thought about it, the pang of iron on his taste buds resounded throughout his tongue and cheeks.  It was strange, even more so than Sherlock’s nude sprint through the flat after the pig and his bath.  God, that had been torturous.
“John is my priority but I can’t spare the man power to do anythin’ about it.  Not with a mass murder on my hands.” Greg pointed out.  It was as close to asking as the inspector might come.
“Yes.” She said, lifting her brows mockingly, before she scoffed, “Ya’ know, for a renowned genius detective you probably should have already known that.  Who else would put up with you and your creepy staring.”
John could feel everything coiling deep inside and fought to hold onto this just a little bit longer, just a little bit more. Sherlock tasted exquisite, like a fine scotch with subtle notes that no mortal could or would ever be able to appreciate. With a pained gasp, John tore his mouth away from the temptation. He knew he couldn’t take much after everything the other man had gone through in the last twenty-four hours. But the temptation was there, to take as much as he could stand and damn the consequences.
John was directed by the man to the club chairs at the desk and he moved to one to sit, as Sherlock took the wing-back on the other side.  The detective pulled his lap top closer, as though he were some staunch lawyer beginning to address a new client.  His fingers began typing at the key board, without even the delay to open a program or file, as he gazed across the expansive desk top at John.  "Are you surprised?"
"Heh. Yeah." Was the only thing John could think to say. The dull roar of Sherlock’s mind was like standing behind a waterfall with someone turning the volume slowly higher and then lower. No where near where it had been when he first left his friend. In fact it was a strange thing to know that Sherlock had consciously tried to slow his mind and focus on putting John at ease because he had picked up how uncomfortable John had been. It was weird but made sense in a strange way. When the two men had been together, despite their differences, they had a strange connected empathy for one another... well, more so John for Sherlock but the genius had learned to balance observation with a small but growing understanding of emotional intelligence.
The bounce in the immortal’s step was a clear indication of his cheerful mood as he meandered amidst the throngs of pedestrians with all the snide self-pleasure of being a wolf in sheep clothes. One whom had yet to invest much thought towards if he would be ending a life this night or not, though he had no particular adventure set in mind for the evening he was occupied with thoughts of his recent interaction with London’s infamous consulting detective. He couldn’t help the predatory lick of his lips at the thought of indulging in drinking from the guarded mortal, in the elixir of his rich blood and the locked vault of his mind,when a sudden thumping against the large picture window of the shop beside him provided the vampire with the rare pleasure of being startled.
Sherlock walked away from the table, his trailing fingers grasping the corner of a stack of papers and file folders.  He flung the mass with a sharp violent thrust of his arm and the papers noisily flapped to the floor behind him as he left the kitchen.  His limbs lazily carried him into the parlor, like a skiff drifting from its moorings in an ever growing sea of chaos.  He found himself at the desk, his eyes cast down at the closed lid of his laptop.  There was a stack of papers here too, another of the coffee table by the couch, more tacked to the wall above it.  All of them were useless.  Proffered him no gain.
Marisa rolled her large eyes with a pretty flutter of long auburn lashes and tossed the towel down onto the counter. Turning away again, she began searching through the cupboards, neglecting to provide the consulting detective with an answer. Sherlock stood fast in his spot by the doorway, assessing what could be going on and what the next move should be. Clearly the girl was here for a purpose that she was hesitating to reveal. If she was here, it surely meant that Lestat was back in the picture and that she needed help of some sort.
“Yes,” she replied with a nod, “I haven’t heard a lick from him either, but he did forward enough rent to cover the rest of the year, saying he would return when he was finished whatever business it was that had called him away.  He was an odd fellow.  Pale as a ghost but awfully charming to talk to.”
these were the books that came up when he was researching the vampire earlier so he was already familiar with what they were.  He had, however, at that time disregarded their credibility, believing then that the vampire was but a man, emulating a fictional character.
All of this in the thrum of the powerful heart filling him with liquid fire, as he plunged himself deeply into the shuddering body of the beautiful creature below him. With a straggled cry he broke the embrace, crying out as he came, rocking against the other. Earning only a whimper from Armand whose arms had fallen to his sides limply, Louis collapsed suddenly upon him forcing out a great contented sigh from both men in the wake of their exhausting activities.
His body itched with the need to be outside, to be free of the daytime safe-house, which protected him both from prying mortals and from the deathly light beyond. He was restless—had been all day—wishing, worrying, thinking, regretting. He slept now because his body demanded it—this new body that was so unfamiliar in comparison to when it had once been mortal. Immortality had changed many things and it was not easy to wrap one’s mind around how it affected everything—every little minute aspect of one’s self.
"Stop thinking." John said, with a visible wince.  He pinched the bridge of his nose, as they walked.
There was a moment of silence that finally the consulting detective broke.  He reached his gloved hand across the cab and his hand came to rest on the soldier's knee, just below the injury.  There was a squeeze from his finger tips that John was sure the man intended to be reassuring.  It was instead uncomfortable and so John unfolded his arms to swat the touch away, only making the detective's devious smirk grow more amused.  "You know by now, surely, that there is more to this death than Scotland Yard has interest in."
Those eyes were not just blue.  No, they were almost navy in color, speckled and broken by striations of light brown that circled the small round opening of the pupil and trailed softly outward, as naturally beautiful as the veins within the cellular make up of an orange slice.  His eyes were an effective window, not to his soul, but to his intentions, his motives, his desires, his thoughts.  In that moment they were closed, a bleakness within them that failed to reveal anything.  Something that bothered the detective more so than the intimate touch and closeness excited him.
Everything appeared staged, set, utterly perfect.
The man lazily rolled his head against the union jack pillow under his head, to see the take away that had arrived an hour after Lestrade had taken his leave.  It had not been touched and was by now most certainly a congealed mass at the bottom of the Styrofoam container.  His stomach growled in protest as if on cue and with a lopsided smirk the detective scooped up the lamb curry, as he got up off of the couch.
The hot flood of copper filled his mouth as he swallowed greedily. Each hard thump of the other immortals heartbeat reverberated through his chest, sending another delicious wave of crimson gushing forth. The rush of the older vampire’s blood spread through his veins like fire as he hungrily took what was given. With each swallow the world grew impossibly darker behind his closed eyes as visions of Armand flooded his mind, passionate encounters from his mortal youth in Venice. Times spent with his maker, Marius. Then flashes of the
“I haven’t seen that blond fellow that was over not long ago to see you,” the ever nosey Mrs. Hudson said, as she prepared his cup with cream and sugar, not bothering to ask how he liked his tea.  “Has he gone back to America then?”
He would leave Sherlock to consider his words, as he continued to perpetuate Louis as the catalyst in all that had transpired. It served no purpose to reveal that he had been to London several times weeks prior to Louis’ arrival, assessing the detective, planting the seeds of a mystery that begged to be solved.
The words were fast and pointed, as he gained his composer, inhaling through is nose deeply as he made the long few strides towards the raven-haired man whose face still registered some concern but more so, sadness. No... pity.
Now, his companion on the other hand... A far easier read. Lestat hadn't even alerted the ex-military man when he had tuned so easily into the other man’s thoughts and partook of the stream of self-conscious emotions and feelings. Many of which were directed at the man who pulled him along on what seemed like an unreal adventure. After all, he had only recently discovered his former lover was not, after two years of grieving—actual grieving—dead. And who, was indeed here to slip so easily back into his life as if he had only gone out for a proverbial 'pack of smokes'.
The detective rushed inside, ignoring the blond beast who was making a show of dabbing his lips with a cloth, as he rushed within. Keeping the blond in his peripheries the long legs carried him swiftly into the space and rounding the back of the settee, he saw a man was laying prone. John’s eyes were closed and his face rather tranquil despite the glaring contrast of his bloody torn shirt. It was obvious that he was breathing easily and it was confounding to witness the doctor so reposed, as though in sleep, without the slightest sign of trauma or harm despite all visual evidence to the contrary.
John had enough. He absolutely refused to let Sherlock continue to try to push him away. This needed to be dealt with now. Angrily, John caught the genius’s wrists in a tight, nearly bruising grip and pried them off his hips before he pushed them forcefully against the wall.
“It is done.” The detective whispered against his mouth, pushing past the finger to kiss John again, deeper and more sensual, his need becoming apparent between them.
“That’s it?” Sherlock’s question sounded pathetic in his own ears, he was hoping for more information on the artifact and so he tried again. “What about this artifact?”
"That's not what I meant..." Her voice never reached his ears as he strode away from the cold concrete walls of Bart's.
Realizing he was in no shape to fight off the blasted man, John growled low in his throat. “Fine, but this is the only time.” Clenching his fists, he made a point of glaring over at the wall. A massage would help he rationalized, then Sherlock would get over his odd mother hen attitude and leave John be.
Sherlock rolled his eyes heavily in exasperation, as he grumbled, “No, John. If you had not been so blinded by hatred you would have seen it too.”
The man who was once James Moriarty sat casually, one leg crossed over the other in the high director’s chair and watched the immortal creature writhe, mouth gaping in screams that the demon had rendered silent. The vampire’s striking blue eyes were now dark, the pupil wide and unfocused, seeing nothing of the space the two creatures inhabited. A seemingly endless black space, no walls or ceiling or floor. Just the pale naked form, which thrashed about the space wildly, alternating from laying on the ground and staggering about, clawing at himself and the empty space around him.
The other man looked considerate for a moment, weighing his reply, as he casually leant on the doorframe. “I hate to admit it, but I’m afraid I don’t know the answer to either of those questions quite yet.” He added becoming animated with his next exclamation, “But that’s exactly why I have
His eyes had selfishly roamed the man from the top of his curly head to the tip of his out stretched legs, toes pink from the hot bath water.  He had noticed things that he hadn’t wanted to—the new things that were there on the man whose body he had once known like the back of his own hand, whom he had mapped many times with his own hands.
Lestat’s arm wrapped perfectly around Louis' back as he pulled their bodies close together in a smooth motion, pressing his lips to the other vampires’ in a kiss that was neither demanding or fleeting. It started as an abrupt apology, softening quickly to a confession, as their lips mingled together for that long moment. Louis’ body was tense in his grip. Lestat wanted to disarm him and draw him in. The tang of his own blood rose in his mouth, deepening the kiss as he parted his lips in an intimate submission, offering his lover the very thing which forever bound them. He would give Louis the world.  It was a far better distraction then pondering heaven and hell, dancing with Devils and witches, or toying with the Talamasca. It didn't matter really, not right now.
Lestat’s thin fingers, with their manicured glassy nails, picked up the duck.  His eyes inspected it intently, as he gave it a squeeze and no sound came out.  Those eyes moved from the toy back to the detective in a flash, his mouth turning down at the corners, and with a disenchanted tone the man criticized, “I find your lack of squeaker very disappointing.”
John scowled darkly and crossed his arms as he leaned against the doorframe to Sherlock’s room. “No.” That was all he would say on the subject. There was absolutely nothing in this world that could change his mind about this. There was no bloody way he would be caught dead in
Lestat tried again, to the same effect, felling a large oak, before finally clipping his fledgling with a right hook that sent John flying.  His back collided with another tree, imbedding his upper body into the trunk of it.  Lestat came at him again, as he struggled to free himself, and John barely escaped a deadly head shot.  As Lestat’s fist missed, the fledgling connected with a knee to his maker’s stomach.  Lestat doubled and was crushed to the ground by a joined set of fists that drove down hard against between his shoulder blades.
Sherlock whirled about on his heel and with those wild wide eyes he exclaimed, “No!  You must leave!  Now!”  The consulting detective marched to the door, opening it and swinging his arm in a wide sweep through it, gesturing his need for the inspector to depart.  Immediately.  When Lestrade returned a thin-lipped glare, the detective gave an exasperated sigh, throwing his head back dramatically and bending at the knees, before he growled through grit teeth, “John will never come back if you stay.  It has to be just me and even then I cannot be certain!  Trust me, if we are to have any chance at finding him this is it.”
Unsatisfied and still confused, he left the mirror and returned to the bar to find that the bartender had cleared his drink away.
John gnashed his teeth. The calm tone the other man used was not helping to keep his anger in check. “Then why don’t you wear the bloody thing?” he snarled, arm flinging out to point at the horrid article of clothing.
Louis felt the anger and frustration rolling off Mrs. Hudson and quickly returned the gentle pat to the back of her hand that he had just received. Sympathetically he stated with a soft smile towards her, “Reminds me of my ex.”
There had been precisely eight times in Sherlock’s adult life, thus far, of which he had felt and experienced many of the physical responses to the fight-or-flight-reaction that fear stimulated. The elevated heart-rate, constriction of chest muscles causing shallow breathing, crispness of vision due to dilation of pupils and of course the pilomotor reflex of goose pimples, among other less-notable reactions. It was rare that the consulting detective was surprised and so much rarer that he landed himself in a scenario where he was likely to encounter that particular set of circumstances.
That was what a voice whispered from the back of his mind. He thought about this, as his eyes made lazy loops around her sparkling eyes, over her generous smile, down the length of her neck, and back up to the curve of her shoulder. Round and round they went, soaking the visage of the woman in, until once more he heard it whisper its unwanted reminder.
The sound of those teeth piercing flesh seemed too loud in the hush of the room.  It was a clean bite, only mild discomfort apparent on the detective’s face, as his eyes fluttered closed and he allowed the vampire to deepen his embrace.  David could smell the blood in the room, a fresh new scent that mingled with the dissipating aroma of their own previous love making.  John looked away, more uncomfortable than his friend, his eyes brooding, his mouth hard, and his fists white knuckled at his sides.  His mind was moving too fast now for David to clearly read everything but he got the clear sense that the new vampire was struggling to stay calm and hold it all together.
It was delightful, Sherlock thought, to hear John snort with laughter, overcome with the inability to keep it inside, as he allowed his own deeper chuckle to mingle.  John’s face had been freed of the aging facial hair he had grown to protect himself from loving again—even though Mary had been able to bypass the whiskery wall—and now the grim face must be gone too.  The detective knew that laugh, inside and out, understood that it was honest and true, and knew that John must be smiling too.  The urge to look back at his former flatmate was intense and he willed himself to resist it.  Having John in the bathroom was success enough.  Facing the other man might ruin everything.
“John was a good man though.” She said, almost mournfully.
John grimaced and thought once more about just bookin’ it.  He dismissed the notion, knowing that it would only raise further suspicion.  Greg was no idiot and he was a good friend.  He would not give up.  He would dig until he got what he wanted, even if it took him a life time.  John decided to give half-truths.  “Look,” he sighed, lowering his voice, “It’s been difficult…and I can’t give you many of the details, but things haven’t gone as planned and…well, plans had to change.”
Lestat’s eyes twinkled as his wicked grin spread wide across his face.
"Do you want to share him, Louis?" The tone was predatory, as he turned to eye the boy again. Dark hair with brilliant teal streaks that were only seen when the tussled mop was tossed. He was handsome and young, two-day stubble graced his chin and the dark burgundy golf shirt, displaying the carnival name, rode up to reveal a plane of hard abs beneath.
The blankets fell away and he realized only then that he was naked.  No pants, no socks, nothing.  The doctor shrugged and made his way to the door he felt most likely was a bathroom.  There was nothing he could do about it now.  His clothes were probably close by.  At least he hoped they were.  He would look straight away, after he relieved himself.  The door did open to an ensuite and the warm lights clicked on as he entered, unveiling the largest bathroom he had ever seen.
“This oughtta’ be good...” the older vampire could not help himself. He glanced back at the fledgling, who returned the comment with a glowering glare. ‘A good time for you to flex some of your mental capabilities, John. Let’s see if you can read it from her mind.’
John had moved so fast that his inferior sight could not keep up and Ludvik was dead on the ground before Sherlock had even thought about it. He stopped flooding John with his thoughts, thankful that it was over. He was mentally exhausted. Ludvik’s hold over John’s mind had been more powerful than he had anticipated. It had taken him far longer to break through than he had wanted, each moment he was locked out a moment too long for John inside. The detective had not been sure what Ludvik was capable of and how quickly he could exterminate his target, but Sherlock did not give up. He had found a chink in the mental armor that the telepath had laid and although it was small, the detective began to work away at it. He wore it down piece by piece, getting more and more information inside, until, like a dam it broke, and he was able to flood Ludvik through John. Just as he had predicted, it was too much for even Ludvik to filter, which gave John the chance to end his life.
The detective had not been surprised that she had spoke, he could tell for the last thirty minutes that she had wanted to.  The question however was most intriguing.  Sherlock was not sure he knew the answer.  Who was John Watson now?
His lightly stubbled cheek grazed against the man’s straining erection, forcing an unintelligible sound from the man’s throat. John turned his head just enough to give it a quick kiss along the side before he began to crawl once more up the man’s body. His mouth found new places to kiss and bite as he moved, rubbing along Sherlock’s deliciously smooth skin until they once again faced to face.
“Then where are we going?” the detective asked, relieved to see the confirmation in the eyes that glanced back to him.
But those eyes still blazed and John couldn’t help but feel as though he were being challenged. As the detective twisted the handle John lurched forward and slammed his palm into it, forcing the door closed once more. “I think it would be best if we continued this now.” He forced himself to sound calm as he said the words, even if he wanted to yell and rage instead.
Clothing was merely a shell then that his body was incapable of soiling and Louis was impeccably clean and neat, so he was never dirtied when out. At current he favored a navy cable knit sweater that was worn but not in tatters just yet. It was a striking contrast to the green converse runners, which seemed brand-new in comparison, the rubber toe still a pristine white.
“Perhaps if it weren’t a pig…” the doctor heard the detective thinking out loud from the bathroom.
It had been terribly easy to extract the information in the case file regarding the poor young man's death from Lestrade.  The inspector was not happy to hear that Sherlock was interested but knew when to work with the consulting detective, especially when it involved one of his cases.  The police had assumed that the case was simple enough, a drug mule that had been let go—permanently.  There was little at the crime scene which was in actuality a dump site, meaning there was little evidence to draw conclusions from.  It was a debacle, as was most of the work Lestrade's men tackled.
John was thankful to have the other vampire here, with him, guiding him, helping him adjust. He feared what may have come to pass if the man had not intervened. He feared what still could if they were ever to part ways. He was like a lifeline pulling him through a vast ocean of unknown trepidations, constantly washing over him with the ever eminent threat of drowning him beneath their heavy weight. John hated to be pulled but he also feared letting go.
"I literally hate the way you use literally improperly." Came an equally exasperated reply.
"You git. That's not even an ashtray." John snipped, pointing at the disgraced bowl. For emphasis he snatched one of the empty cups and beaned the indignant and ruffled brunet in the head with it.
Molly had seen the wound earlier but his agitation at her erroneous assumption of its origin had ended the discussion.  Allowing her the chance to examine the wound up close reopened this bypassed conversation and the detective inevitably had to give the young woman a clipped account of the scenario that had led up to the incident.  Of course he understood that she would naturally be drawn into discussing particular details about his relationship with his former flatmate, which Sherlock wished to avoid.  So, he decided to beguile her into shocked silence, as he gave the account in short blunt points, whilst flashing her that small upward turn of his mouth that females seemed too find captivating on him.
– John and Mary’s engagement
Whoever had ordered the restoration had gone to a lot of effort and expense to conceal the truth and most certainly had the means and experience to do so.  The yard would have been fooled, would have easily overlooked the most obvious signs.  The home was staged to make it look like Mary Morstan had fled—willingly, of her own volition, in a trained manner of flight.  A female had lived here, but had chosen to leave, without informing the man she had cohabited with.
John trailed kisses over the pale man’s collarbone, nipping here and there as he began moving down. Both hands abandoned what they were previously doing to skim over ribs before making their way to Sherlock’s trousers. Working the button and fly with one hand he unwound the detective’s leg from his body and moved down.
John plucked at the dirty yellow material pooling around him. “Why am I wearing a dress?”
“Nope.” Came the succinct reply, as the detective spun on his bare heel and walked to the far corner of the parlor.
The doctor brought up a hand to separate them, laying his index finger against the detective’s cupids bow.  “Promise me, Sherlock,” he said, “no more dying.  I lost you once…I can’t do it again.  That means the little things and the big things.  I am a part of you and you have become a part of me.  What you do to yourself you are doing to me.”
David gave a resigned sigh which wheezed out of his tall dark frame.  The young body that his old soul now inhabited still a truly beautiful gift to his maker, but the soul inside was the same, aged and wise with the many years of mortal living.  Lestat could not deny that his David was both a pleasure to behold and entertain but also a voice to be heard.  The man knew many still in the mortal realm from which they had both come and he had been easily accepted into the immortal one he had entered not long ago, gifted with a cordial disposition that drew a general acceptance from others without any effort of his own, which his maker had always benefited from.  Yet now the other man was hesitant.  It was obvious that he did not trust giving his maker certain information and the blond was irritated that for all his vampirical gifts and powers that he could not just pluck what he wanted to know from his fledgling’s mind.
—and the slightly larger master bedroom at the hallways end, sandwiching a small but efficient bathroom between them, a doorway allowing the main bathroom to also double as an ensuite to the master—
“Ah, yes, isn’t it inauspicious to not be able to read the thoughts and mind of one’s maker?” the other vampire’s voice was serrated.  Louis knew that the edge was not meant to cut him, although he understood to pain the other was feeling well.  “You are insufferable, Louis,” the voice on the other end added, it was only slightly gentler than the last comment, “and I am a fool because of it.  Of course.  When and where?”
“Yes, John…yes!” Sherlock could only pant, as the fingers began to work a steady pace, reaching and probing just far enough to make his skin light with fire and his senses tingle with arousal.
David had been    The mortal’s need was evident enough as the trousers were opened and pushed roughly to the floor, followed by the cotton pants beneath.  Then he took him wholly into his mouth, careful to keep the hard yet soft flesh from his sharp teeth.  The strangled gasps from earlier were abandoned for a much more throaty erotic moan that roused David’s own growing lust and the fingers in his hair tightened their grip.
Knowing that any further relationship with the man would involve no doubt many more of these strange incidents, in which he was made uncomfortable by the other’s inadvertent actions which were an unfortunate by-product of his oblivious and aloof nature towards social graces and interactions, John gave in.  He settled himself on the closed lid of the toilet adjacent to the ceramic tub his friend was reclined within, accepting that conditioning himself to these events would serve best to protect him.  Still he adjusted the crotch of his now tighter blue jeans as he sat himself down, before he leaned his elbows onto his knees and clasped his hands together, preparing himself to endure this moment of weakness he felt within the uncomfortable company of the naked detective.  “So…” he said, attempting to continue a conversation that had been sufficiently ceased earlier.  He hated the sound of his voice, so obviously awkward and strained.  The doctor cleared his throat and decided not to talk.
As if sensing his companion’s anxiety, the brunet, suddenly explained. “I told Marisa where we were and that we would need another day to travel. The meeting is set for tomorrow night. You will need to recoup until then.”
In two strides he was kicking open the door to their master bedroom.  He plunged into blackness, illuminated only by the low ambient light behind him.  He could see feathers strewn about the room. The bed was shifted several feet away from the wall.  The dressing table was smashed in front of him with shards of mirror glinting precariously warning of the danger that lie within.
The black cab came to a screeching halt outside the home of Mary Morstan.  The windows were black, not a single light turned on, when others along the block were semi-lit with the activities of the people inside.  He threw cash at the driver, who lit up in the front seat.  Sherlock was out of the vehicle and up the steps to the front door without even bothering to close the vehicle door.  It didn’t take him long to find the spare key under the frog shaped flower pot—
John chuckled, "I guess you bloody well deserved that."
“Towel.” It was a quick order, not a request.  Sherlock clenched his teeth and grabbed for the nearest hook, where a yellow towel was hung.
Sherlock smirked. “Genius detective returns from the dead, seeking vengeance against gay lover’s new fiancé.”
“Yes.” Sherlock asserted. His eyes never left those of the vampire. He leant forward, cupping the side of the cool face he knew so well, planting a soft kiss just before his ear. “No one is paying us any mind here. It’s late, the clock is their focus, and we are just two lover’s on vacation—like them. Try the ‘little drink’. It will help.”
"Isolated but still localized." he mused aloud, wrapping the blanket about himself a little tighter.  The edge of it had slipped open, revealing a long length of his thigh, and he was not sure yet if he was freezing or sweating.  His body was slick with perspiration but his skin was crawling, even beside the heat of the fire.  He readjusted his covering and realized then too that he was incredibly hungry, the smell of the boiling pot becoming more and more irresistible.
“Normally it’s a lovely place, I mean, we have all sorts but this latest business with the grizzly murders and such is just awful. I imagine Sherlock is working on it though.” Mrs. Hudson reassured herself, rising from the chair to attend the squealing kettle as Louis took the opportunity to dump the contents of his cup into a near-by potted plant.
Sherlock turned to expect the vehicle that would carry him swiftly away from the threatening man, but the cabbie seemed to have other intentions in mind.  The detective watched as the black car swung into the lane closest, slowing down to a mere crawl as it approached, yet it did not stop.  As the cabbie passed he also noted that the man inside was slowly and very methodically licking the steering wheel.  Wide blank eyes rose to meet his own, the mouth slightly gaping, chin wet with the saliva of his previous workings at the wheel, before he picked up to normal speeds and pulled away into the thrum of traffic on the busy street.
Finally, one evening as they sat quietly alongside the hearth, sharing a pot of tea, she asked him, “Who’s John?”
John felt a little confused, by this.  “So…?”
John could pretty much admit that the Christmas party had been a hit.  221B had overflowed with people, merry making, and presents.  Most of the attendee's seemed to enjoy Sherlock's little deductive parlor tricks, as he guessed the contents of each package correctly before the intended recipient opened it.  It was actually fun.
"I haven't time for riddles, David. When you have something worth-while to say then you know how to reach me.  Until then, welcome home."
“I apologize for the deception, Dr. Watson, but it really was a necessity.” The man said.  His voice was soft and silken, calm and assuring.  His eyes were earnest and, hell, were they ever one crazy shade of green.  They damn near glowed, rimmed with the dark soft lashes and finely arched brows as they were.  With a sigh, one brow arched a little higher and then he moved, he drew up his hands in a peaceful diplomatic gesture and John realized he’d been staring.  The man continued, in his oddly calm manner of speech, “Nevertheless, I must ask that you refrain from casting any more items off the roof top before you do hurt someone or worse, attract any unwanted attention.”
Just as he tried to break loose, to spin one desperate theory, his vision was filled with the white hard body of Lestat, who had skidded to the floor boards in a relaxed reclined pose beside him.  His head was propped by an elbow on the floor and his glowing blue gaze sparkled with mirth and enjoyment, as he chuckled, light and mocking.  “Oh, Sherlock,” he said, drawing out the last syllable of his name—like Mrs. Hudson would when she was overwhelmed with compassion for his cold and strange ways.  His tongue licked his lips again, this time slow and sensual, purposed.  “I do love it when you gasp.”
"Mrs. Hudson!"
Lestat knew exactly what would happen if he did as he wanted—which at that very moment was to wrench the damn mantel from the wall and smash it into Louis’ bookcase.  His temper would be his downfall. Proving Armand’s cool headed composure in comparison to his own selfish destruction of those things others cherished.
The remark hung in the air for a few stale moments as Lestat digested it, then leaning forward he narrowed his eyes at David.  “…and so… you’re saying I can’t read?” Lestat’s face remained perfectly serious in a blend of confusion and indignation until David couldn’t help but smile and soon both immortals were chuckling fondly.
John froze, halfway through the doorway.  He knew what he had heard, but for whatever reason he needed to hear it again.  He cocked his head back over his shoulder and demanded, "Say that again."
They moved together, Sherlock thrusting against him and John rocking himself back, their cries mingling as they panted and groaned. He could feel Sherlock’s lips move against his skin, even as no words came out.
The two girls left giggling and bundled in winter coats, mittens, and hoods. They headed out into the cold evening air and huge white plumes trailed after them as they laughed. The vampire watched as the girls hugged and parted ways. When he turned back, Louis was watching him very curiously.
Still, there was no sign of the other man. John pondered then if perhaps the detective had tried to nod off—it happened so rarely that the doctor was surprised. Although unusual, the sleep was needed, and so John set to his own tasks for the day.
Shortly after, John had again departed to return home to his fiancé and Sherlock had returned to brooding for the next few days, with only the occasional outing to the hospital morgue he frequented. One night the detective stopped and purchased a few papers from a stand in an off-beat area of town, acquired fish and chips and returned to 221B.
“Bloody hell!” Mycroft gasped, his breaths panting once more, as David leaned his torso forward over the other, smiling wickedly.  “You’re a heathen.”
"It's here." the dark haired detective said, unable to restrain the spread of smile across his mouth.
"Like hell you will. As soon as I leave you're going to try to get into the basement." John crossed his arms over his chest, suddenly feeling too much like a scolding parent who had the sixth sense to know when their petulant child was up to no good.
"John, you’re off somewhere again and it is obvious that you are not pleased. Shall we depart?" Louis did up the buttons on his heavy wool coat and slipped the doe-skin gloves over his pale fingers before he opened a hand in gesture for the other man to lead the way.
John felt his adam’s apple bob in his throat as he swallowed reflexively.  Maybe this was real.  Maybe he really was a vampire.  When those words left his mouth the doctor truly believed them.
"Please don't refer to it as an experiment, Sherlock." John reprimanded, shaking his head, "I don't need to be reminded that I am nothing more than an experiment to you."
The doctor let out a heavy sigh, sitting down in his chair behind the desk and wrapped his hands about the plain white mug, filled with the aromatic brew.  That was Mary.  Always looking out for him, always mindful, always there.
The vampire felt his body jerk and his eyes flashed open. Sherlock’s grip turned the wheel sharply back and the car came back into its lane, only garnering a few honks from passing motorists.
Mycroft startled slightly at this.  “He’s back?” the thin lips stammered.
His stomach did a flip as Sherlock slowly lifted the jumper higher, inch-by-inch, exposing more of his chest. Grasping the edges of the material himself, John took over, needing to get the genius to leave before he noticed anything. He pulled the jumper over his head, cloth obscuring his vision as he stepped back. John drew in a startled breath and stopped as he felt long fingers gently skimming up his ribs.
That last statement made the doctor paused in his typing, as his brain considered this viable possibility that he had never entertained. The ever-moving brain theory was gaining traction. He glanced studiously at his flat mate, whose attention was still consumed by his task. Sherlock’s unwavering dedication to his focus reminded the blogger of his own project.
“What about the blog? How do you know about all this anyway?” There was an incredulous air in the questions.
“I chose this when Lestat gave me the ultimatum… to try to save you… and you wanting this so badly means that, in a way, I sacrificed my soul for nothing. I realize that we both will live a new fantastic, practically immortal life if you are changed. As much as I love you – you insufferable cock – I can’t tell you that I want to spend eternity with you, because I don’t know if that’s what I want.” The confession finally passing the vampire’s lips lifted a weight off John’s mind and heart that he hadn’t realized was so painfully heavy.
Teasingly his fingers gently circled them a few times before he began to roll and pinch the small buds. All the while his mouth trailed down the man’s arched neck, placing kisses and nips along the exposed skin. Teeth were hard then soft, John carefully listening and feeling how the detective responded both verbally and non to the various sensations he was causing.
Now, if only he had thought to bring his laptop over when he had taken the painkillers he could do a bit of writing before he became too drowsy. However, as he hadn’t thought about it until this moment, the bloody thing was still across the room. Looking longingly over at the device for a few moments, John shook his head before wincing at the pain the motion caused. Nope, he was not getting it and not shaking his head again either.
The Yard had also closed his penthouse case.  Open and closed, obvious mass murder gang war crap.  It didn’t sit well with him.
He made his way with them back home, to London, sailing high above the continent below on the cloud gift.
“When Louis told me that Mary had a double life, I fought believing him. I thought he was a nutter.” John chuckled again, “and then he bit me and, well, having your blood sucked out and someone else’s memories forced into your brain, you kind of start to question what is fact and what is fiction these days.”
The knob wiggled and moved, unlatching, and then eerily the door slowly pulled away from the jamb.  At a snail’s pace—typically over dramatic—the door swung open, to reveal the mysterious blond man languishing in a tub full of white sudsy bubbles.  The detectives mind instantly went into overdrive, assessing the scene beheld before him—
“What other option do I have?  This has been your plan all along.” The detective reminded the damned vampire, “Is this the only way that it can be done, then?  Only if I accept?"
The stranger shrugged and replied, snippily, “How unimaginative.  Where’s the fun in that?”  He smiled widely, adding, “I have a more elaborate plan for you.  Trust me, it will be far more entertaining.”  His head lolled slightly to his left shoulder, as both hands returned to the pockets of his trousers and he rocked back onto the balls of his heels.  “If you think you get bored—whew!” he blew out a dramatic breath, grumbling all the way through it, as he rolled his pitch black eyes and laughed, “Ha, you have no idea.”
John could tell that the man had more to say but he couldn’t keep his rage from boiling out of him and angrily he ranted into the phone at his unknown captor, “Don’t apologize, let me out!  Why are you doing this?  Why me?”  It was a tumbling ramble of words that John himself was not even sure was entirely coherent.
She sat there, the amulet in her delicate white fingers. Her head was bowed, as though she were deep in prayer—which he very much doubted. Her red hair fell over her shoulders, in contrast with the glinting gold that surrounded them, flickering in the sparse candle light that was barely enough to light the room. She was waiting, and Sherlock was certain he knew for whom.
“You were paid to stay with me.” It was more of a statement then an question.
Sherlock was much more of a restless sleeper. It had always been a source of frustration between them when they shared a bed. There had been more than one argument about the war for the bed covers. The thought raised the corner of his mouth. He had always won those battles as well, ending all of John’s quarrels with a well-felled kiss. The almost-smile slipped. He doubted the tactic would hold water now.
“Oh , you mean that the world’s hottest detective is missing?" The younger girl finally blurted out, her voice hitched with an exuberance that she tried, too late, to subdue.
"Only if you consider Detroit an exotic local." Came a warm reply.  "I have a few more stops before I can truly offer to whisk you away. After all, you tease, as usual, and won’t come with me. Not now, no matter how alluring my offer."
"Thank you." He turned and walked into his flat, there was a finality to the click of the latch catching behind him.
His dreams for the most part were nothing out of the ordinary or much different than what they had been before.  Sometimes they were random drivel, like hanging with his mates from school, sneaking drags from stolen cigarettes, or the odd getting running-away-terror that always entertained the idea of locked doors or doors that opened to nowhere.  Sometimes they were more contemporary, dealing with his change, blood drinking, or hunting.
Sherlock almost blurted out a platitude just to garner his release but when John’s eyes narrowed on him, piercing him with a look that clearly stated he knew exactly what the detective was thinking, the man gave a long grating sigh of resignation.
!"  John implored him, as that irascible anger transformed into grief.  His hands were on his own chest, more importantly over his heart, as he told the detective, "This is forever.  I will never be the same.  I will always be this and there is nothing…” That single word hung in the air a moment, pungent with feeling, stinging as it rang in the detective’s ear drums, “…that
The detective’s head was jerked back violently, his scalp screaming with the pressure. He was held in that awkward position, just long enough for the pain it caused to become unmanageable. Then the hand that help him released. He brought his head back, feeling the muscles in his neck protest, and his brows lowered dangerously over his eyes at the wide black orbs before him.  Moriarty flicked the tip of his chin and stepped back, standing upright. Sherlock stopped him. His hands darted out, making fists in the cape-like mozetta draped over his shoulders. He pulled the demon back, knowing full well that the creature bemusedly allowed this. Sherlock took advantage of the moment, hissing into the man’s face, “But it’s not you, is it?  Not really.  You’re a demon now.  It’s the demonic power that gives you the strength to do this.”
Sherlock flared his nostrils, identifying that tea—Cream-Earl Grey—was reaching optimal steeping in the china pot that sat poised on the edge of the kitchen table. He glided through the precisely executed movements that ensured that just as he pressed the edge of the delicate gold-rimmed china cup to his lips, the newspaper strategically held by his other hand, as one leg crossing casually over the other, his body would appear the very picture of one whom had been relaxing for quite some time as the door of the flat opened and one, John H. Watson entered the residence. It was obvious that some event had transpired to put the doctor in a sour mood and judging by the darkened hue and debris on the back-left of his trousers, the muddy scuff on his shoes and the tear in the right elbow of his fairly-newly acquired jacket, a tumble of some sort had happened very recently, as the discoloration was obviously caused by the wetting of the denim material.
“I won’t be more than an hour.”  John instructed, turning to leave, “Get to work.”
Although the two years they had spent apart had been torturous in every sense of the word, the detective had been prepared for it.  It had been a sacrifice, but one that he had been prepared to take.  John’s grief was needed to solidify his efforts in the eye of Moriarty’s extensive crime ring and had done so very effectively—at John’s expense.  The man had done what many men would do—attempt to move on—and when the lovely and mysterious Mary had so caringly offered to become a part of that healing process, what normal man would resist?
“Stop hitting yourself, John! Stop hitting yourself! You did good. It was a valiant effort on your part, but I am sad to say that it was not good enough.” Lestat’s laugher was almost disembodied, seeming to engulf the air around them as he assaulted John with his own hand.
The sight of Sherlock Holmes panting and writhing, sweat-damp curls framing that angelic face sent shivers of pleasure along his nerve endings. As his knuckle began grazing against the man’s ass John worked the tip of his second finger in, stretching the tight muscle further.
"Well that seemed hardly necessary." The consulting detective scowled. "Perhaps I should rephrase the question. Why are you pursuing me? It's obvious you have John Watson so what exactly do you want from me then?"
He could feel the soles of his shoes sticking to the floor, as he entered the seedy pub.  A man was asleep at the far end of the bar, in a darkened corner a couple of men sat talking quietly while stooped over pints, and a silver haired elderly woman, haggard and miserable looking, plucked away at the Video Lottery game off by the lone pool-table.
“I won’t stand for it, John!” his voice rang out in the bedroom, and his fingers tightened around the trapped hands. “I cannot allow the time to pass and for us to be separated… permanently!” The tone was both piercing and growling at the same time as he vented his fury and his fear. “You were right! I have lost you once more. I failed you.” The words became harder to say, but Sherlock pushed through the painful constriction in his throat. “It’s my fault Lestat did what he did, and there is nothing I can do to reverse it.”
When the back of his knees finally brushed against the edge of the bed he slowly manoeuvred them around. John released his white-knuckled grip on the now damp dress shirt and coiled his arm tightly around the other man’s waist, pulling that delicious body flush against his own once more. All the while he did not break their heated kiss. Their mouths duelled and bit, tongues darting out to tease and taunt the other man as they both fought to take control of the kiss.
The frustration straining almost painfully against his slacks twitched, reminding his easily distracted brain of yet another way the other man left him aching. John hadn’t pushed back yet, hadn’t pulled away from his advances, nor had the vampire reciprocated with the same fever of their original encounter in his mind palace. The atmosphere this time was much the same, except, this time he and John were more keenly aware of the lucid dream state they were sharing. Here, there was no risk of physical harm to either of them. No limitations beyond what their own minds and mutual desires could conjure.
John's hand’s slid along the length of the man’s long, pale legs, parting them as he began to crawl his way back up. He lowered his head once more and ran his tongue along the underside of the man’s knee, feeling the slight twitch in reaction to the sensation. He turned his head slightly and used his hands to further widen the detective’s legs before beginning to kiss his way up first one thigh then the other. When they had both received affection from his fingers as well as his mouth he continued to move higher.
It was therefore very aggravating to Louis that his bored maker had followed him to London.  It was an irritable distraction from his own motivation of coming—the watching of the great Sherlock Holmes, the world’s first consulting detective, at work, utilizing his most marvelous talents, honed over years of dedication, skill, and training.  It was something Louis had come to deeply respect—the man was gifted amongst his mortal peers—and Louis regretted that his own interest may now warrant any danger towards the mortal.  For the danger of the human world was a threat but the danger that Lestat’s interest brooked would be absolute.
"But it is true. I would be happy to show you..." Before Sherlock had a chance to finish the breath he was inhaling there was a sudden rush of air. His world shifted rapidly as he felt the lighting fast touch of a gentle press and the whoosh of motion that stirred his hair and clothes. Within the micro-second it took for the consulting detective to register what was happening the man’s body was inches from his own and before he had time to shove the other away the blond was suddenly out of the bathroom and leaning casually in the door frame off the bathroom, eyeing him hungrily. Spinning deductions screeched and grinded against one another, sparks flying, as their probability was eliminated.
Sherlock began to knead John’s ass. Warm, wet fingers circling closer and closer to his entrance with every thundering beat of his heart. At this exact moment, John didn’t care, he wanted everything that the other man would give him. John cried out, his hips bucking when he felt a single finger trace along the rim of his entrance, circling in slow teasing strokes.
The other girl was scoffing and the vampire could hear her fussing with stacking empty cups. “So, I'm just supposed to leave my husband and kids and move with you...to Baker Street?”
He opened the envelope and withdrew a single sheet of fiber paper, as well as two tickets to the opera for that evening, the note simply read:
John rocked slowly, forcing their erections into contact again and again, the sweat and oil coating their skin allowing for a smoother slide. Leaning forward he once more caught those delicious lips with his own. Sherlock’s mouth opened immediately and their tongues duelled for dominance.
it read.
Sherlock didn’t respond right away, instead crawling onto his lower back, long legs framing him, guaranteeing that John wouldn’t be able to just roll off the bed. “You are being ridiculous; a massage will help and you will feel better for it. I will do that, then you will sleep.” The tone brooked no arguments.
The Talamasca were done helping. The agent had made that perfectly clear. This would be the last time he was able to use his clout as the former head to garner any interactions from the group that they did not initiate. That being said, his focus was now on the rogue faction and that was precisely whom he was now going to seek out.
In defiance, the detective grabbed one of the other guns and shot down into the shaft. He turned back to his flat mate, eager to gauge his response. John glowered at the prat.
"With who?" Sherlock was very interested now in the supernatural politics of this underworld so closely knit with their own.
John remained behind but close enough to ensure that he would be at the ready should something unexpected happen. There was a brief moment when he became aware that Sherlock was considering ‘making a run for it’ just to test John’s ability to track him. The thought was just as quickly dismissed, much to the vampires’ relief, when it was followed by the recollection that John had access to his thoughts and so, now already knew of the idea.
Now the bastard was gone.  Who the hell knew where.  He didn’t really care.  Fuck him and all the bullshit that followed him.  He and Moriarty—if that really was who that thing was had been that had appeared amongst them like a bloody ghost-Hoodini—those two psychopaths deserved one another!
The diplomatic voice gave an equally non-partial answer.  “You suffered quite a bad head injury, as I am sure you are aware, and…”the voice paused, tried to take the time to calculate, what was to be said next, “as for Mary, unfortunately…”
“You must go inside.” She stated. It had been pushed out of her, words she dreaded to say. She extended the key, refusing him eye contact, as he nodded and she released it into his hand.
Sherlock's grin melted and he casually waved off the comment with a dismissive gesture, as he resettled himself with his head reclined on the arm of the settee. "I don't see how that has anything to do with anything."
The detective then retrieved his jacket from where he had shed it so haphazardly the night prior and it was then that he spotted his mobile, obscured by the rubbish bin and some discarded balls of paper that had missed their mark.  He was both delighted and bothered to have found the thing.  It sent his pulse racing, a reaction that he tried with all his might to stifle, as he clicked the black screen on.  The phone refused to react.  It was dead.
The truth was a bit of both.
Lestat took a deep breath and his shoulders slumped a little as he stepped away from the confrontation with John and flopped into the wing-backed reading chair nearby. He looked human in the movement, the swagger gone, the arrogance squashed, instead he appeared weary and almost concerned as he stared distantly at the carpet. He lent his chin in the cup of one hand with a long finger running up his cheek and tapped his temple, tousling the golden curls.
“Now.” No reassurances, no flowery words, just that single word command. The order was clear. The detective arched again, forcing John’s fingers to penetrate even deeper.
“And you have.” Sherlock confirmed, “She told me that she met you once when you were first dating Mary. As I understand, they were not on the best of terms, so it was no doubt a very brief meeting.”
“We both know that I am worth the attention, my sweet.” Lestat replied, nonchalant in the face of his fledgling’s obvious concern.  He folded his arms over his chest and plodded forward, needing to know, “And the consulting detective?  Are they watching him as well?”
John could not recall the last time he had read aloud. It made him feel childish and insecure, vulnerable in a way he was unaccustomed to. He reasoned with himself that it was ridiculous to recant now and for such preposterous reasons. Thousands of people had read his blog now. Sherlock had even read them—where he felt he was being terribly maligned and misrepresented.
Sherlock was such an enigma. The man had never seemed interested in a physical relationship with anyone, not even The Woman, but especially not John. Their first evening eating out together there had been that initial confusion over John’s inquiries into the man’s personal life, leading Sherlock to very adamantly claim to be married to his work and he really was. There was no room in the genius’s life for anything that did not involve mysterious murders.
"So this is your game then?" Sherlock stopped, fragments of his scattered observations began highlighting themselves, as he sifted through the settlement in the screen that he used to view the world around him. "You're going to perform parlor tricks and then have me try to deduce how you've accomplished them?”  It was disdainful, thick with resentment and offense.  The detective was beyond this kind of distraction and irritation—even if he couldn’t explain what or how these phenomenal feats were performed.  His narrowed saturnine gaze nailed the man across the room from him, who was casually straightening the clothing he had laid out on the detective’s bed.   It wounded his pride to ask, but Sherlock forced it out, “Is this a means for me to earn information on where you're keeping, John?"
"Of course, Louis. You know I can hardly deny you anything. Send me the address of your first stop tomorrow night and if I arrive after you have left then I will call you. Is that acceptable, lovely one?" the endearment was exactly what Louis needed to hear at that moment, when he was feeling as if he was slowly slipping off a ledge of guilt for the mortals he was now desperate to protect.
He paused at the order, thinking that Sherlock couldn’t possibly be prepared enough, he was a hell of a lot bigger than his two fingers. A quick glance down confirmed what he knew to be true. Yep, it was much bigger than two fingers. “But-” He started but was cut off.
It had been twenty years. Cafe' au lait with just a hint too much milk. The texture was finer than silk, smooth, pore-less as it was flawless. Feeling the sensation through the warm and worn fingertips of the man by the blood-link that filled his mouth caused David to moan in duel pleasure to that of the body trembling against him.
Sherlock’s reply was quiet and almost sincere enough that he believed himself. "Alright, John."
The detective had no need for a car and could care less for something as flashy as the sleek profile of the high speed sports car.  It did not take much for the vampire to deduce who the Ferrari belonged to and it did little to calm his increased agitation.  He came up to the expensive vehicle, running a finger along the glossy paint of the side panel.  He caught the scent of the electrical impulse racing to the horn from the alarm system within.  There was a spark of heat, a soft pop, and then the faint aroma of smoke.  The alarm made no sound.  A wicked grinned graced the full pale lips of the immortal.  “So, my dear one,” he whispered, peering through the black glass of the tinted windows at the leather bound steering wheel with in, the impeccably clean tan interior, and cedar accents, “you are still here, entertained by your consulting detective...and I see you are receiving the attentions of another.”
There were no discernible footprints after the police had carelessly trampled any possible trace of evidence, no blacked or scarlet-stained trail to follow, and the garbage in the small street had all been ransacked and disturbed by the foolish weapons search undertook by the attending beat cops. They did not stop to think that there might not have been a weapon to hide, complete conjecture, based on the wound itself. The more Sherlock thought about the damage done to the man’s throat, the more he was certain it had been done, literally, by hand.
John just stood there like an idiot for a long time, staring at it.  He wondered when the vampire—that still seemed ridiculous to admit—would return and where he intended to go with him.  Then he finally got up the balls to grab the thing and turn it on.  There was nothing new.  No text or calls that he had missed.  He sighed, fairly disappointed.
“I love this dance…” Armand whispered, his lips ghosted against the other immortals, as they pressed softly against each other. The kiss was slow and searching, almost as if they were so wrapped up in each other that at times it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began—hesitant and sweet. It was as if each press of Armand’s lips against Louis own was a little question—
The door to the flat closed and Lestrade leaned back against the wrought iron railing beside the buildings entrance.  He hiked up the collar of his long wool jacket, to protect his neck from the chill on the slight breeze that blew caressingly from the north, and then reached into a pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes.  He pulled one out for himself, sticking it between his lips before he directed the pack toward the other man.  The detective’s cold gaze darted down to the half empty pack and then back up to the inspector, before his thin fingers reached out to pluck a stick of tobacco out for himself.  Lestrade pocketed the pack and retrieved his lighter, cupping his hands about his mouth as he flicked it for a spark.  His cheeks drew in with his breaths, as it lit, and he puffed out his first bit of smoke before passing it off.  Sherlock lit his own smoke, drawing in a long drag that he let settle inside his lungs for a long moment, before releasing it.
The brunet was indeed silent, as she worked the buttons of his collar open, exposing the wound and its monstrous bruising.  Her fingers quavered ever so slightly as she gently examined the area while he gave the account.  Without a word she went about her task, listening as she worked at cleaning the wound with antiseptic.  When he was done she continued in silence, redoing the buttons when she was finished.  Her fingers were not shaking as much anymore.
David was keenly aware that the man quavering beneath his suckle was a man capable of blocking even Lestat’s level of mental intrusion.  As one of the most powerful of their kind his maker’s gifts and abilities far surpassed his own and many others of their vampirical family.  He had been gifted the blood of the ancient’s, the Queen of their damned kind, and still this mortal was capable of blocking his intrusions.  All this was slowly being revealed to David through this connection, the bloodletting, the little samples that Mycroft seemed to enjoy as much as he did.
Suddenly a hard pillow whapped John in the face, causing him to start and cry out in offense as Sherlock bellowed pitifully, "You never do
The writing was surprisingly fun for John. He had been shocked by how much he enjoyed the blogging exercise his shrink had prescribed him, once he and Sherlock had some adventures worth writing about. It was also relaxing, which was sometimes more of a draw to him. When he was writing about the cases they had, he could forget about everything else. Like that know-it-all psychiatrist had predicted, John found the writing restorative. It didn’t heal. He refused to believe that. But it certainly could make him forget for. Each adventure relived through each strike of the keys on the keyboard could replace one past ache and painful memory, drowning them one by one in a deep bottomless well somewhere at the back of his conscious psyche.
John was quiet and so was the detective. “They no doubt thought I’d finally lost it.” He said, adding cynically, “As much as I maybe portrayed that no one considered us lovers, I am afraid that it is us who were blind. I’m sure it was not a leap for many of them to conclude that I must have had some involvement in your disappearance.”
Why had John been targeted?  To get to him.  It had worked, terrifyingly so.  In that moment at the fire he had not assessed, could draw no conclusions, for his sole focus had been pulling the doctor free from harm.  It left him feeling vulnerable…and having others pry into what he had yet to conclude was monstrously irritating.
“Louis,” Armand raised a hand and cupped it softly over Louis’ mouth with a lazy smile, as long lashes fluttered to eye him ruefully. “How about we lay here a little longer before I have to go... and let us pretend, that I do not.”
John’s head fell back as he groaned again. No one had ever sucked on his balls before, how had he not known it could feel this good? It was amazing. Those long, agile fingers pulled his leg wider, leaving him fully exposed. He panted through the starbursts of pleasure, gripping the sheets as his body twisted under the assault. “God,” He breathed.
The word hit the detective like a clap of thunder, loud enough to shake his foundation. Reality came smashing back like a surge of electricity. He had not lost. There was still one more thing he could do.
“In fact that did take up the majority of my effective time but I did manage to pull some information together regarding this group of ‘watchers’ that Mary was supposedly a part of. There are a few locations that are consistent in my cross referencing of events, which reported to have involved creatures or paranormal activity that this group would be interested in.” Sherlock looked tired as he stood up. He planted his hands on his hips and twisted from side to side, cracking his back.
“Louis, Mrs. Hudson!  The tenant downstairs!  He was just here!  I saw him come in!” his voice was strained and extreme, pervaded with urgency.  He gave only a moment’s hesitation, a quick dart of his tongue across his lower lip, before he amended in a slow measured tone, deep in timbre, “It is of the utmost priority, Mrs. Hudson, that I find that man.”
Sherlock was his best chance to find out what had truly happened to Mary, what she had been involved in prior to their life together. If the man was still mortal, Louis’ tutelage would serve John well in tempering his thirst and if his once lover had been turned into what he was now…well…if Sherlock hadn’t gone mad he would be practically unstoppable. There was a sinking in his stomach as he caught on the thought of the self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath spiraling into madness after the transformation. He himself had great difficulty with it, the doctor in him vehemently refused to agree in the possibility of his own existence and means by which to he was now forced to use in order to continue living.  He worried Sherlock would find the rationalization even harder.
“Ugh—n-name for the cup?” she finally managed.
"Then go home, John." Came the insidious remark, so casually purred from across the backseat of the vehicle.  John was so incensed by the beguiling provocation that his head whipped back around, the deep blue of his mottled eyes dark and narrowed with suspicion and rage.  The other man was reclined, one leg crossed neatly over the other, head tipped downward so that his bemused smirk was all that more aggravating and devious.  Sherlock added insult-to-injury as he finished, "but you won't."
It was more intriguing to see him stop.  Like he had somehow shut off the need to know, Sherlock was in his room, undressing, pulling out freshly pressed clothes from the closet.  He redressed, ran wet hands over his face and through his hair, before slipping into his iconic wool jacket and headed out.  He brusquely bypassed his concerned land lady and left the flat, stopping outside to light a cigarette and talk with a young girl, huddled in a nearby alcove of the building next door.
Whatever those powers were, he could tell, call it intuition or what-have-you, that they were not good. Not just in the limited scope of those individuals involved, but his experience told him, even on a more grander scale.
—perhaps some kind of supernatural phenomenon—akin to her knack for disappearing and appearing in places she had no business being able to get into.
The quirk to the corner of his flatmates mouth wasn’t there anymore though.  The detective’s back was turned to him, his gaze slightly obscured by the angle told John that he was stoically watching something through the window that faced the main street out front.  This contrast again pricked his ears to the call of another case—that new distracting adventure that he was yearning for—making the doctor feel slightly like a yo-yo being tossed down and then just as quickly recoiling back.
Louis listened as he sat on the cold ledge of the Baker Street flat's roof top, to which he had been forced to abandon for the time being.  The detective was getting closer indeed—ever the clever man that he was.  Louis had made arrangements to leave and still the man had caught sight of him as he made his last preparations.  It was not hard to evade the rushed approach of the desperate detective, leaping unseen through the darkness out of the way, but still it seemed to fuel the man's urgency.
John groaned loudly as one deep knot was found and worked on just below his right shoulder blade. Both hands focused on that one spot, pressing in and demolishing it one stroke at a time. He couldn’t help the shiver that ran through his body as long, elegant fingers splayed and ran along his ribs, nor could he help the way his body was responding to the stimuli. A physical response to a physical action, he mentally told himself, nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed over.
Sherlock leaned back in his chair.  She had found him a shirt a couple of days ago that somewhat fit.  She had nothing on the island but what she had packed for the expedition and so she had loaned him her largest sweater, which still stretched across his shoulders and failed to reach his belt—at least it was dark grey and not florescent pink.  He tried to mimic her stance in the chair but the sweater pulled uncomfortably at his shoulders when he drew his arms together, so instead he placed his hands around the cup before him, and quipped back at her, “Well, first off, I would find it hardly a credible claim, it having come from Lestat.  The creature is an compulsive liar and is incredibly adept at manipulation.  What you really need to know is why he would want you to believe that John is dead?”
“It serves me perfectly well for the time being.” John announced, unable to keep the triumph and mirth from his tone.  “Look,” he negotiated, “I can tell already that it will probably only take you fifteen minutes to figure yourself a way out of them, but let it serve as a warning, Sherlock.  If we are going to be working together then you need to listen to me.  You need to trust me.  Respect me. And yes,” he gave a resigned sigh, running a hand back through his hair, before admitting, “I am going out to feed.  You’re not invited.  Stay here.  Stop leaving while I am unable to protect you.  Figure out what the hell possessed Moriarty and then find a way to kill that bloody bastard, once and for all. Okay?”
"Out here," his reply was inviting.
Their late-night dashes through the alleys and seedier areas of London had always left John exhilarated, slightly breathless and focused entirely too much on his beautiful and mad friend. Again, he always brushed those off as the adrenaline high, but he could only lie to himself so much before the lies unravelled before his eyes.
"Who is this?!" He shouted into the phone.  There was silence. "You do realize you can't keep me penned up in here forever!"
Sherlock stood there, clad in his plaid blanket, holding his clothing to his chest, assessing her with his narrowed gaze.  It was extremely odd, he thought, to be placed in the care of a young woman who lived a wild life out in the middle of no where.  He had expected an old timer, still nostalgic for the good old days.  She ignored him and went about her task, he assumed she was cooking.  There was a large pot over the fire and she had been placing chopped vegetables into it.  She sat up from her squatted position and went back to the table, where she grabbed a chair and returned to the hearth.  She sat down and took up a large metal ladle, which she used to stir the contents of the pot.  It certainly smelled like food and his stomach gave a rebellious growl in response to the aroma that now filled the main room.
The red head went out to meet the man, crossing the bridge. They greeted one another, just as one might suspect two accomplices to do. There seemed to be no suspicions, no animosity between them, and Sherlock knew then that Ludvik held no power over Marisa
The detective’s head ached. He massaged his temples as he thought. Sherlock was not sure if the pain he was experiencing was from mounting fatigue - he hadn’t slept in days – or from the strenuous research, which seemed to bear little fruit. How unrewarding.
“D-do you mean…extra hot?” she asked, looking confused.
John blinked after the detectives quickly retreating form before locking the door and going after the confusing man. He had to run the last few steps as Sherlock tried to slam the door in his face. He caught the edge of it before it clicked shut. After taking a few deep, calming breaths, he opened it to find the man staring out his bedroom window.
You. This. Us. Each word flitted through his mind as he tried to think past the delicious press of the detective’s solid body against him. ‘You’ implied a level of dedication that John was afraid that the other man couldn’t give. ‘Us’ was similar, a commitment that he didn’t know if Sherlock was even able to offer. “This.” The word slipped unbidden past his lips. This. The here and now with no real thoughts of the future, only of what they could attain in the moments they had.
“I can think of none.” His voice was meek, alien to Lestat’s own ears. The prince was gone and here there was the boy who had been beaten brutally for attempting to run away with the players centuries before.
When the pretty brunette shifted in her seat across from the blond, Lestat took the opportunity to lean forward just a bit and flash the girl a dazzling smile that bordered on predatory. Pink rose to the girl’s cheeks, heat flushing over her as she swallowed suddenly choking a little and bursting into a coughing fit as she quickly rose and excused herself past the others whom she had drawn attention from.
“Mm-yes, thank you.” John responded, putting the cup back down on the desk.  At least she had seen him try it, maybe he could get away without finishing the awful brew that the nurses insisted on concocting in the staff kitchen.
“I don’t trust her.” Sherlock stated, having evidently plucked the thought either from the vampire’s own mind or from the look on his face.  From his face, John thought, to console his own agitation.  Sherlock spared him a brief glance from the road, explaining, “Marisa has not asked us to trust her.”
“I'd hate to spare you any undue pain but I do have other things to be getting to.” The steely cold grip let loose.  The body fell and just before the moment of impact a woman’s scream was heard echoing up through the streets, followed instantaneously by the sickening crunch and squelch of flesh and bone coming to a sudden stop from the gravity fed speed of its decent.
“That’s what Sherlock had said, when I showed ‘im the card.  Said it was to placate the easily dissuaded.” Greg offered and John was surprised to hear it.  “But who are these people?  What do they want?”
"Not a good idea, I'm afraid." John cut in, informing his friend, "I've been advised that it would be best not to interact with people I knew...well, before.  We can go somewhere here."
He pulled his head back and brought the man’s erection from his between his lips, letting them slip wetly off the head.  He licked with his tongue, slow lazy circles permeated by the odd quick flick, that left Mycroft panting again.  Then he would dive down, taking him wholly once more, reveling in the shudder that tensed the mortals body taut like a bow.  He repeated this pattern, the moans of the man music to his ears, until he felt the other drew close to climax.  One more throaty moan, his head fell back, he was on the precipice and David withdrew, keeping him there.
Her eyes flashed up to meet his—they trembled a second before flashing away again. That second had said all he needed to know.
The slender girl was a few years her junior and unlike her bright frames, the others were black and elegant, as was the brown woolen-hat she wore. It was tipped perfectly to highlight the soft angles in her face, as she laughed and eyed her friend wickedly, waiting expectantly for her girlfriend to answer.
“Of course, my lady.”
“Tonight, I shall.” He agreed.
Sherlock's curls shifted about his brows as he turned his head back to his friend, those variscite eyes engaging, as the smile on the man's lips broke.  "Lestrade was right, there is no crime scene.  The body was obviously dumped, the murder was committed somewhere else, and the body was cleaned.  Extremely well."
They rose and prepared for the meeting with Marisa, which would lead them finally to Mary’s murderer, Ludvik Prochazka. They shared many of the same things they had as lovers in their previous life together; undressing, showering, and shaving—all of which lacked any gratification. The entire process, a scenario the detective had lavished in his mind the many long cold torturous nights he spent without John beside him, was soured by the daunting tasks to come, leaving both of them heavy and mechanical, as they prepared for what was to come.
“I want this, to become the creature that you have become, John. Vampirism has considerably more benefits in my world than disadvantages, and I do understand what I’m saying. Despite how preposterous this all seemed months ago, you are the proof.” Sherlock leaned closer as he spoke, eyes blazing as he tried to convince John. “You are the reality as much as Lestat or the others I have encountered.” Sherlock saw the offence John took to being compared in any way to his maker. There was a deep anger and guilt that rolled in John’s guts at the thought of the detective so willingly wanting to undergo this change.
“It’s time we move this little game along my pale knight. I expect that there shall be no falter in your part. I surely could not have made it more clear what the repercussions will be should you attempt to betray me or you fail outright. It might seem as if you stand to gain nothing by succeeding in my tasks but rest assured, there will be a reward of sorts. I am not without the ability to provide mercy, what sweeter gift can there be?” The smile turned to vampire was cheshire and with eyes black as pitch the fear welled again in Lestat’s gut. It only served to widen the demons grin, who seemed expectant now for an answer.
John staggered on his next few steps back through the door frame.  Sherlock had taken a step forward, anticipating a fall. The vampire caught himself and shot him a weak look, which made the detective feel like an ass for being so belligerent.
John tried to cry out her name and only heard himself whimper, faint and distant.  Her eyes were wide, her mouth gasping, choking, and then the man pulled his hand back and John could see the blade, slick with bright red blood, as Mary—his Mary, sweet Mary—slumped to her knees and then the floor, hands dripping the blood she tried to hold back.
He looked away and took a deep breath, holding it for a long moment before letting the air rush out of his lungs. He shot the younger man a cautious look, trying to see if there was a reaction to his words. He was slightly disappointed when none showed on Sherlock’s face. He pushed on anyway. “But it seems that I might not be completely straight either.”
“That would do, John, but perhaps I may be the answer you’re seeking.”
“Yet…” John looked from his friend back down to the pig his hands were deep within, and gave a satisfying smirk, “you were unable to prove it, weren’t you?”
Louis’ fingers grasped the tiny china cup, needing an object to fidget with.  It wasn’t that he was nervous, he was the exact opposite in fact.  He found the elderly woman’s attentions and mannerisms oddly calming and familiar, as though his dream of mingling perfectly amongst the mortals were a distinct reality here within the confines of this woman’s kitchen.  He fiddled with the cup out of habit, as all immortals learned to do to blend in.  They certainly could not drink the contents within the cups but most mortals never noticed.
“Fuck you!” John bellowed, losing complete control of his tenuous emotions.  Ridiculous as the outburst had been it was better than the panic choking him.  “Let me bloody well outta’ here!”
Sherlock’s eyes moved over the subject’s face, down the length of exposed neck and collar bone, to the lump under the sheet that was the arm at the individual’s side.  He flipped back the white cotton with a quick flick of his fingers, taking the man’s wrist.  The member was cold with death and when he placed his first two fingers on the notch in the wrist he could detect no pulse.  He placed the hand back down at the man’s side and placed his hands on the neck just below the collar, with the same result.  To be expected.  The man had died after all.
"Where the hell is the bloody phone?!" The doctor stopped, narrowly avoiding a tumble, as he came skidding to a stop on white marble floors in front of the coffee-table. The fragrance of the huge bouquet displayed in the center took him a little off guard as he snatched the vibrating mobile and answered the unknown number.
