“Yes, the surgery on his leg went well. As for the neurosurgery, the images indicated I could modify the stereotactic biopsy technique—which doesn’t involve going in through the skull—to retrieve the, erm, the item. Dr. Watson has a concussion, which, with proper care, he should heal from nicely. Not to minimize the seriousness of a concussion but being hit by a car is a nasty business and often causes even more severe brain trauma.”
!! My heart bounces in excitement.
Reaching my arm toward him and wiggling my fingers, I beckon him.  Setting down the plate, he locks his fingers with mine.
“Whilst you were napping, I went out and bought you a present,” he says, changing the subject, a sly smile on his face.
At the sound of her name, Rose loped onto the floor of the cab and laid her head on the gapless seam where Sherlock’s and John’s thighs met, her large brown eyes guileless as she seemed to query the men.
“I have business to take care of,” Sherlock stated matter-of-factly.  He lowered his voice for the sake of privacy as he sat down on the bed John had cleared, testing it with a pitiful bounce that fell far short of any expectation of comfort.  Looking as if there was no more natural place for him to be than behind bars having a casual conversation, Sherlock watched John as he moved his pile of bedding to the other mattress.
The baby doesn’t agree or disagree, but rests her head on his jumper, content for the moment.
“I want to own you,” he growls, his voice dark with lust.
John tries to hold back the annoyed sigh as his exasperation threatens to outweigh his patience. “Your dedication is legendary, and admirable, but it won’t keep you from collapsing with raging pneumonia, or a terrible kidney infection. You’re going to make yourself sick, Sherlock, and sooner rather than later, and then you’re not going to be any good to anyone at all.” He softens his voice, tries a different tack. “Fifteen minutes. Please, Sherlock? Fifteen minutes of a lie down and if you don’t fall asleep, I won’t keep you from getting up and going back to work. Promise.”
together. John has always known it, down deep inside, known he was settling for a distant second when he married someone else. If Mary hadn’t been a master manipulator, skilled on getting exactly what she wanted from her target, John wonders if they ever would have lasted long enough to make it to the altar.
John nods. “Like holy hell,” he says between gritted teeth as the last of the saline flows over the wound. “But I made this bed myself, didn’t I? Okay, look for a suture packet containing a 25 gauge needle.”
Sherlock shoves him hard into the side of the car, steps back, gun still aimed at the man’s head. “Go. Don’t tell anyone you found us, or I will find you and
“Yeah,” John groans. “Give it to me, I want it--”
“Of course not,” John replies. “I wouldn’t expect you to. Hand it over, and hold my forearm still, wrist and elbow, well away from the wound.”
Sherlock does almost all the work, packing a change of clothes and a toothbrush into John’s black cycling bag, bringing John a damp flannel to swipe over his hands and face, then helping him carefully maneuver his injured arm into his jacket. John’s jeans are still unmistakably, disturbingly bloodstained, but he doesn’t have the energy right now to change and any cabbie who’s been driving the streets of London more than a week will have certainly seen far, far worse.
(What John really wants is to stretch them with thick-gauge silver rings, weight them so his nipples are puffy and full and engorged with blood, hanging and swaying with each thrust when John fucks him. But Sherlock hates wearing vests and they’re already borderline visible right now to anyone who is perceptive enough to notice, so the barbells will have to suffice for now.)
He rises, slips out of bed as quietly as he is able, uses the loo and brushes the morning funk out of his mouth. He spits, rinses, stares blearily at the creased, somewhat worn-looking man staring back from the mirror.
John is making an unbelievable (yet in hindsight, utterly unsurprising) discovery; the brilliant, gorgeous, untouchable Sherlock Holmes is a terrible,
” His tone is shocked, disbelieving, sorrowful.
John exhales his held breath.
“You not belong here,” she cries, jabbing a gloved finger at the ice-glazed ceiling. “Up there! You Illegal!”
“You’ve been at my side almost every single minute,” John says. “When did you even find time to hack the hospital’s records?”
“Goddamn you,
Sherlock grips the base of his shaft and presses hard, just barely manages to stave off his climax. His balls ache and throb with the denial of release, and a choked whimper escapes his lips.
A beat passes before Johnson recovers some shred of composure.
“Because I’m selfish,” Sherlock sniffled, “and destructive, and I need to learn self-control.”
“They’re not bad people,” Johnson protests weakly. “I never would have brokered a transaction with people I thought wouldn’t be good parents.”
Another ten minutes pass before well-dressed people begin to leave the restaurant, mostly in couples and small groups, climbing into their cars and pulling out of the lot. Almost exactly twenty minutes pass before a black Lincoln Town Car pulls up to the kerb in front of the restaurant.
It doesn’t burn, which is good news indeed since a UTI is a very present risk in his current condition.
As soon as he lowers the gun, the group of kids act on a herd instinct of self preservation and make a break for it, sprinting down the street and away from John as fast as their legs will carry them.
Sherlock places the safe on top of the filing cabinet next to the door, thumb rolling the first tumbler of the lock.
In point of fact, now that John looks, he notices that Sherlock is quite a bit thinner than he should be, cheekbones sharp, the tendons of his neck clearly visible. He remembers what Molly told him about Sherlock not eating, not sleeping, and a hot spike of guilt flares in his belly. He’d been so selfishly wallowing in his misery, he’d not even noticed the obvious signs of Sherlock’s own unhappiness. He permits himself to feel it for a moment, the regret washing over him, then resolves to put it away, to focus on the present.
“Does he, now,” Sherlock murmurs, and Patricia looks up at him like she just remembered he’s still in the room.
They lie still and gasp for breath together as the aftershocks spark and recede, leaving them limp and sweaty and spent. John winces and grumbles a bit when Sherlock pulls out, but huffs out a chuckle when Sherlock tugs his hair gently, tilting his head back for a proper kiss.
“Sherlock,” John murmurs, when the moment stretches out just a bit too long. “Talk to me.”
“Is that what this is about?” John asks, the fight-or-flight reflex singing in his nerves, making him feel slightly unreal. He’d never had any inkling anyone from his army days knew, and what a hell of a way to find out. “My personal life is absolutely none of your goddamned business.”
To be honest, he always felt like a bit of a fraud in those conversations, extending advice while not having any firsthand knowledge of fatherhood to fall back on -- further complicated by the fact that parenthood, while something he had never been opposed to, was something John had, at some point in between Helmand and Sherlock Holmes, decided wasn’t in the cards his life had dealt him.
For several more minutes they lay side by side in the dark silence, with the stillness of the room punctuated only by  the muted growl of the occasional van trundling down Baker Street.
"I'm sorry, "John says apologetically, lifting his head. "I should have shaved-- I'll just go--"
“Can’t argue with that,” John agrees.
“I know how that feels,” Sherlock tells him. “You know that I do. But there’s no objective reason you should feel badly. You’ve never done anything with me, or to me, without my enthusiastic consent. You never would.”
“No,” he says, emphatic, and Sherlock believes him. “No, I don’t. Do you?”
Sherlock sagged, boneless, against his chest, spreading the cooling wetness between them. Despite the post-orgasmic aftershocks still shivering through his body, John slipped quickly out of Sherlock and tipped him gently to his side, untying him efficiently, freeing his limbs before the endorphins wore off and painful cramping set in.
They linger over dinner far longer than necessary, picking at a shared plate of tiramisu as Sherlock deduces the surrounding patrons for John’s amusement. Too soon the restaurant begins to empty, and at last they find themselves on the kerb. Sherlock hails a cab and turns to John, fumbling uncharacteristically for the right words.
The smoothie shop is peak bourgeoisie hipster aesthetic, all sandblasted brick and exposed ductwork. The menu is written in coloured chalk on a huge board, hanging above the steel counter holding several industrial blenders and bins of various ingredients.
Sherlock presses his fingertips into the warm, pliant flesh of his hips as John thrusts down onto him. “I love it,” he rasps, and he does, loves the hot tight pull of John moving around his cock, he loves the discipline of willing himself to stay still, stay passive as John fucks him, uses his body to chase his own pleasure. The tension winds up tighter and tighter in him, the urge to thrust almost unbearable as John rides him harder, hips snapping down against his, his arse bouncing lewdly against Sherlock’s thighs as he moans and shudders with obscene, gorgeous abandon.
Sherlock slips off the bed, wondering briefly if John wants him naked. He hadn’t said, so Sherlock does exactly as he was told, kneeling on the rug next to the side of the bed, heels tucked under his rear end, and waits.
Time to put it all away. John’s always been aces at putting things away.
“An hour. Maybe ninety minutes.”
John’s lips slide across his jaw, his teeth gently tugging on his earlobe, making him give the tiniest whimper.
“What do we do next?” John asks, irritated and anxious, sick to death of sitting around and talking, itching to fly out of the chair and tear apart the city to find Sherlock.
But John knows staring at it like it’s a cobra about to strike solves nothing whatsoever.
“Morning, love,” John replies, and kisses him on the mouth. Sherlock’s breath is terrible, unbrushed teeth tinged with a leftover trace of old garlic. John could not possibly care less. “You awake?”
“Of course,” Sherlock says as he rises, taking his leave with a single curt nod to his brother before placing a large steady hand on the small of John’s back, guiding him out the door and taking him back home to Baker Street.
“I promise,” he murmurs with a small, fond smile.
She turns the handle, opens the door. D'Annibale is standing there, a thunderous look on his face.
“I should have left him
“What’s got into him, John?” she asks, her voice plaintive but edged with an unmistakable annoyance as she wrings a flowered tea-towel in between papery, blue-veined hands. “I know it’s not my business, it’s not, but when you two finally worked it out he seemed so happy, and now he’s worse than ever.” She lowers her voice, conspiratorial. “Are you two having troubles already?”
John doesn’t know where the things he says come from; he knows that if he were to hear a recording of himself later, when he’s in his right mind, he would likely die of crushing, cringing mortification. They things he says are so are ridiculous, so cliched, lines that sound lifted from the most hackneyed BDSM porn imaginable. But right now, in the moment, it works, it all works.
“I should tell you every day,” Sherlock whispers into his ear, the feeling behind the words making the tightness in his belly spiral even as unshed tears prickle in his eyes. “It shouldn’t take almost losing you for me to say it--”
Armed with new awareness, John shifts his attention back to his hostess. “I have to say,” he says, as evenly as his traitorous innards will allow, “this is a remarkably civilised kidnapping. The nicest I’ve had so far, and believe me, I’ve had a few.”
John can’t help but smile as he shakes his head in disbelief. “That was...amazing.”
It’s not too bad.
Sherlock asks the question that’s been roosting in the back of his mind.
John slides the loop of the leash around his wrist and unbuttons the fly of his jeans, lifting his hips just enough to shove his jeans and pants down to free his straining cock. He wraps the leash around his right hand and pulls Sherlock around roughly to settle in between his thighs, grabbing him by the hair with his left.
With a small jerk of his head, John barked out an ironic laugh.
“Oh, Father!  How terrible for you!  But what else could you have done?”  Millicent dabbed a cloth at the moisture that had collected on William’s brow.
One would think he would know that people do not shower with clothing on, but he seems surprised to see me.  All of me.
With sickening clarity, Sherlock realized that what he had seen wasn’t a video. It was John’s memory.
Thank you, Burning_Up_A_Sun for your extraordinary beta-ing!  And thank you for your grace and patience in allowing me to go on about the chapter without actually saying what it's about until I send it to you.  I know that has to be annoying!
Lestrade pawed a hand through his hair, his shaky sigh telling John everything he didn’t want to know. That Sherlock’s brilliance, and stupidly uncanny luck, might not be enough to save him this time.
Holding his mobile out from him, he considered what to say, fearing that, in his inadequacy at human interactions, he would drive John away not ensure he stayed. For far too long, Sherlock pondered how to phrase
“Okay, I will let you love me in whatever way you see appropriate.  It is not for me to say if you are misguided in your affections.”  I stroke my fingers through the hair around his ear, grateful beyond measure to be able to touch him.  To love him.
“And you think he killed her?”
, Sherlock.”
Sherlock blinked - once, twice - and then a smile graced his mouth, and he reached behind John’s neck, removing his necklace.  With trembling fingers, he took the bejeweled ring from the box and threaded it onto the necklace where it joined the two other possessions most precious to John: his son’s ring, and a small leather pouch that held the note Sherlock had written before he was to be hanged.  Replacing the necklace around John’s neck, Sherlock took a thin cord from the box and slid it through the other ring.
think about having sex, then.  Intercourse.”
“Yes.  He be ill, sick to the stomach when I met him, and again during the night as we rode.  And after some persistence I persuaded him to tell me it has happened several times in the last few days.  You have seen him stumble, have you not?  Tis not because he be tired, though certainly tis not helpful, but his foot goes numb.  His hands, too. I believe his symptoms be from arsenic poisoning. Tis no sure way to know, not unless he dies and they examine his liver, and that, of course, be nothing for which we wish, but my mother has seen several such cases; humble woman that she be, she be known for her knowledge of medicine.  And poisons.”
about what I call him
“The only subject you’re sensitive enough about to react to this… degree would be issues regarding your sexuality.” Sherlock looks away, takes another sip of juice. “He implied your marriage ended because of a homosexual relationship with me, or something along those lines.”
Just in case.
“Only a scratch, no need for medical attention,” Sherlock replies, moving close to John’s side, placing a hand lightly against his elbow, cupping but not quite exactly pressing. “You heard the DI, John. Time for us to go home.”
And the very centre of who he is, the very Sherlockness of his deepest self, his quicksilver brilliance, his loose limbed grace, his unexpected wry humor, his deeply hidden but very real tenderness--John knows that no matter what becomes of them, even if Sherlock and he somehow live a hundred lifetimes, across a hundred different universes, this central core of Sherlock’s being is so steadfast, so certain and true, that John will always know him by whatever bone-deep internal magnet draws them to each other so inexorably.
“I’m all right,” John declares, rolling up the window and slumping back into his seat. “I’m all right.”
The taste and smell and feel of him is everything John ever imagined and more. It’s perfect.
It’s close to noon, and he’s halfheartedly struggling with the crossword at the kitchen table when Sherlock rises. He passes by John without a word on his way to the bathroom.
“American bloke,” John remembers. “Sleazy as all hell, had to be twenty years older than her. He was her live-in physician and drug dealer as well. They had only been married a couple of months. Sherlock was called in to prove he deliberately gave her the drugs that killed her. He claimed it was an accidental overdose, but Sherlock proved it was murder.  He was guilty as sin, and a right bastard, too.”
“Morning,” Sherlock murmurs, sleep rough and barely awake.
“I think,” Sherlock says, and his pale eyes are suspiciously shiny. “I think not being your first isn’t so important, if I get to be your last.”
The phone in his hand makes it more difficult to shut down the nagging impulse to send Sherlock a barrage of needy and neurotic texts demanding his immediate return, so John shoves it under his pillow, out of his sight but not too far away.
They taper him down him from co-codamol to paracetamol. A spectacularly unpleasant time is had by all.
...And here we are.
Barring the whole Mary debacle, where he was fogged by grief and exhaustion, John’s instincts are seldom wrong--and as the days pass, John becomes increasingly certain he’s not wrong about this, either.
The phone rings again, the standard boring stock ringtone the phone came with, and the simple chime has never sounded sinister or full of terrifying portent until now.
“The leg pain.” Sherlock’s head tilts in brief contemplation.” It’s psychosomatic, isn’t it?”
Sherlock is watching telly in the recliner chair, his face drawn with tiredness,  pale eyes tinged with dark circles. He’s curled himself up somewhat awkwardly. making himself as small as possible, his arms wrapped around himself against the chill of the hospital air conditioning.
“Precisely,” Sherlock says.
“I would tear London apart with my bare hands to find you,” John declares, low and fervent.
," John says, voice going breathy, as Sherlock’s fingers trace the inside of his pelvic crest, down to the crease of his groin. He closes his eyes, almost dizzy as the blood leaves his brain and rushes into his cock, seemingly all at once.
particular moment.” Why was she making it so difficult?
“Poisoned?!”  John shot a look to Sherlock and turned back to Colin.
“You said you did not want me promise to not kiss your back again.  I have been thinking about this and if you want me to keep doing it you must enjoy it.  Would that be a correct assumption?”
What did I say wrong?  My eyes fly open to see what he is doing.
“I fear my dear brother regards the MOD far too highly. He’s always been a bit, shall I say, whimsical.”
“I do not deserve it, John.”  Sherlock opened his eyes and tilted his head back so he could look at John, albeit upside down.  He needed John to see his eyes, to see his sincerity.
“I have arranged for a private jet to meet us.”  I consult my watch.  “In exactly one hour and forty-eight minutes.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, but before he could speak, his mobile chirped an alert. He whipped it from his pocket. And reading the message, the whole of him tensed, from the tightening of his expression to the gathering of his limbs.
“John?”  A rumbling voice came down from upstairs, a voice that John would know anywhere.
“Yes.”
My hand…
“No, no. It’s not that. It’s just that I…I spoke with Nika Rudnikov.”
John searched Sherlock’s face, but as much as he tried, he couldn’t find the artifice.
that might be suspicious.”
Hmphh.
I am not sure I have said this before, if so only once or twice
I label this tone Smirky Boy.  Maybe it is painful and he wants to retaliate for some grievance I have caused him that I have already deleted.  No, that cannot be it.  He said he enjoyed it.  We shall see if I do as well.
Running out of the pavilion to where he had heard the signal, his view hampered by his hood, John fought the urge to throw it back.  But he could not take the risk; to reveal himself would put Sherlock in peril.  Hearing it again, John spun in its direction. Not more than a few dozen yards away be Colin and Aldus, and a jolt of hatred pierced through him as he glimpsed Cedric, his face twisted in anger.  By the time John reached them, Colin and Aldus had him in their grasp.
“The Pine Barrens of New Jersey,” Sherlock replies. “Over a million acres of undeveloped forest, right in the middle of the most urbanised region of North America.”
He extends his gun hand, finger on the trigger of the Glock, aiming directly between her eyes.
It’s not until she’s less than a metre away that Seb realises Molly Hooper is very, very old. Or rather, she looks old--her shoulders are sloping, her face as greying as the stone wall, seamed with creases and wrinkles. Her eyes, however, are a contradiction, bright and sharp, indicating that she may not be as aged as she first appears.
John stops his mouth with another kiss, then nips at his neck, the juncture of his shoulder as he moves his fingers to the other side of his torso, flicking and rubbing at the pebbled flesh. He’s more aggressive now, just up to the edge of too rough, making Sherlock’s nipple ache and throb as the pain transmutes, sharpening the edge of his pleasure, making him shiver and whimper, low moans trapped in his throat as he finds himself caught between warring impulses, wanting to both pull away and beg for more at the same time.
Sherlock smiles at that, and moves in to kiss him again, making up for lost time, finding the lube and flipping the cap, slicking his fist before closing it around John’s cock, bringing it back up to full attention immediately, making John draw in his breath sharply. Sherlock works him up and down, just the pressure and speed John likes, as expertly as if he’s been doing it forever. That thought makes John wonder, fleetingly, to what extent Sherlock surreptitiously monitored his self-pleasure habits all those years, and the idea of that sends a fresh shower of silvery hot sparks of arousal across his nerve endings.
Sherlock looks away,  blushing, completely adorable and hopelessly awkward in equal measure.
“It was bad enough that you had to pretend to forgive her,” Sherlock says. “Add that into the mix, and there was no way you would have been able to maintain the façade.”
“He’s right, John.” Lestrade looks at both of them, shoulders straight, gaze even. “I should have known. The fact that an obvious homicide was ignored like this is reprehensible. And I am deeply sorry. Sherlock, I promise you I will do everything I can to make this right, and to try to keep it from ever happening again.”
“Turn to face me,” John says in the hallway, his words brooking no dissent.
Alan Turnbull, a nurse who served with John in Kandahar, is a friend of sorts but not a close one by any means. He and John texted back and forth a few times after John's return to London, had discussed meeting up for drinks but as these things happen, neither ever followed through. Yesterday, Al messaged him out of the blue and told him he was getting married shortly, girlfriend up the stump and whatnot, and invited him out to his last moment stag do. Impulsively, John had accepted the invitation, his heart still brimming with cheery, unguarded optimism over yesterday’s job offer and his tenuous reconnection with Sherlock.
“I want you,” Sherlock says, still puzzled. Had he not made that clear?
He dips his head, looks at the young PC from under long dark lashes. “Constable ... Laurie, is it?” He holds out a hand and smiles, a small private thing, full of promise. “I fear we’ve got off on the wrong foot, and I apologize. Please, call me Sherlock.”
“Lay your head right here, pet,” he says kindly. Sherlock does as he is told, and a small sigh escapes him when John’s fingers begin to card softly through his hair, short nails scratching gently against his sensitive scalp.
“Well, yes,” John says, then feels like a dick. “But no,” he backpedals. “It’s not really you. It’s just been a long day, and I’m sick and tired of being a fucking shuffling invalid.”
“A bit dull, perhaps. A little mundane,” Mr Atherton supplies with a small, knowing smile. “A bit too boring, perhaps, for a former Army man and compatriot of Sherlock Holmes.”
So while a case is on, sex (and the slippery slope of physical affection) is off the table. Completely.
Maria is the villain here, to be sure, but all three of them bear blame for what they’ve become. No one here is innocent, no one will escape unscathed, and John understands now, with a bone deep certainty, that one -- or more -- of them is going to die here tonight.
“If I recall correctly, you took care of me for almost two months when I was shot. Fifty eight days in all, not that I was counting.”
Sherlock glares at him, fury and disgust evident in every line etched into his pale, exhausted face.
“Just be more careful next time,” John says, his tone a bit softer.
Then the recent memories come tumbling in, making him smile despite the fact that he can barely move, and Sherlock discovers that yes, even smiling hurts this morning.
“Because I killed her.”
“Listen to me,” John says, his voice low and urgent. “You did nothing wrong. Nothing.”
“Oh, I agree. No parental discipline at all. Really, it’s tragic.”
“A dog,” Sherlock says, contemplating the notion. “I think… yes. We could do that.”
“Give that back to me or I’ll --”
Occasionally Sherlock goes out for a bit, to Bart’s or to Speedy’s or just for a walk to places unknown. He doesn’t always tell John where he’s going, but he is careful to always let John know when to expect him home.
“An interested party.”
Sherlock is lying on the other bed, wearing only his jeans, curled tightly in a foetal position with his back to John. His naked shoulders tremble with each ragged breath.
Sherlock sighs and wraps an arm around John’s belly. “Incomparable. Literally. I have nothing in my life with which this experience compares.”
“Do you know anything about a man named Lou?” Sherlock asks.
Late the next afternoon, Sherlock is pacing the short length of the motel room, smoking and muttering to himself.
“Yes. She did.”
"Back door, yes, sir. She didn’t tie us up or anything, which surprised me, kind of, but like I said, she seemed sick and maybe not on her best game that day."
John acquiesces, releasing Sherlock’s cock with a loud wet slurp and scooting himself carefully up his body, keeping his weight on his knees and elbows as he trails gentle kisses up Sherlock’s neck, along the edge of his jaw, against his hot, sweat-damp temple.
“Good boy,” John purrs in approval, and bends to his task, holding Sherlock down and spreading him wide open with both hands as he licks and sucks enthusiastically at his arsehole, swirling and flicking, licking him open, pushing into him with a pointed insistent tongue as Sherlock moans and shivers, the pleasure winding up higher, tight and red hot deep in his pelvis.
“Looks a lot more comfortable than your old friend the foldout chair,” John observes.
Sherlock mentally supplies.
“John,” he moans. “John, I-”
As Sherlock cried and shook, John really, really hoped the married ones next door were out for the evening.
"I’d have a copy of that police report," Sherlock says briskly.
“And look at you now,” John says. “Absolutely gagging for it.”
“Jesus, no.”
The hushed, reverent tone of Sherlock’s voice does something to John, makes the push and stretch of his fingers (
It’s glorious.
This story exists in the world, now, solely because you guys are here to read it.
“When you removed your coat to sit down at the table, I saw the monogrammed label sewn below the inner breast pocket.
Alligator Guy’s lips contort in a truly spectacular fashion as rises halfway from his chair. His companion places a warning hand on his bicep; Alligator hesitates briefly before returning to his seat.
“Yes you are,” Sherlock says. “Why will you never admit it?”
“I know, but…” John stops, pauses in consideration. “Okay, I admit that when we started this, I didn’t know where we would end up. But I like where we are. What we have is good. It’s brilliant. It works for us. I don’t want to risk that. Also, what about…” he runs a hand over Sherlock’s back, over the pale scars that have faded but will never entirely disappear. The intent behind the gesture is clear.
“Outstanding." He gives her a more serious look. “I have a favour to ask, Patricia.”
A moment of silence.
The black lace of the knickers is stretched tight across his groin, the crotch not nearly wide enough to contain him, the rounded bulge of his testicles spilling far past the edges of fabric. His long, slim cock is held firmly against his stomach by the snug material, the head of it well visible above the material. A smear of precome is visible, shiny wet on the taut expanse of his belly.
“You’re absolutely right,” agrees John, and pushes down the small burst of self-consciousness in his chest as he hooks his thumbs into the elastic of his boxer briefs, eases the constricting fabric carefully over his straining cock, down his hips, and off. He tosses his underwear aside and straightens his spine, chin up, boldly meeting Sherlock’s wide pale eyes.
“If it wasn’t for me, you’d be safe right now.” The words spill out of John’s mouth unbidden.
Sherlock swallows, exhales. “Yes.”
“And that’s when…” Lestrade prompts, not bothering to hide the amusement in his warm brown eyes.
“Drink it,” Sherlock tells him, kind but firm.
Sherlock grew still, then exhaled. He shook his head. “No,” he whispered.
“Watching what?”
John glances over at him and smiles in return. “Hello there, sweetheart. How do you feel?”
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John breathes as his tongue finally works its way inside of him, teasing him, leaving him open and dripping wet with saliva. “God, that feels so good, fuck.” Sherlock lifts his head and kisses the small of his back as he slips a finger into his relaxed opening, making John gasp out a string of small incoherent sounds as he arches his back and clenches tightly around the intrusion.
Settled means sometimes you make romantic love by candlelight, murmuring hushed words of endless devotion solely because you want to, because the moment feels right and good.
who I am, thanks.” Sherlock moves closer to the shelves, swipes a finger across the edge. “Needs dusting in here. May want to have a word with your cleaning person.”
Sherlock shudders and gasps. “I don’t -- I don’t -- maybe, I don’t --”
“I need you to find her.” He tries to grab onto Sherlock’s tee shirt, to pull him closer, but his hands are uncooperative, his fingers sluggish and numb as they fumble against the fabric. “Promise me you won’t stop until you find her.”
“It’s very fortunate for you, Miss Hackforth,” Sherlock murmurs, “that you use a running app and post your daily log to Facebook.”
Mycroft actually waits two more days for his inevitable descent upon Baker Street.
He closes his eyes and listens to running water, to the elderly pipes groaning and creaking, to John’s sturdy baritone as he serenades the stained tile walls of the bathtub.
“Anything you want.” Sherlock moans, the exquisitely dirty words sparking a firestorm of arousal in his belly, the stirrings of an orgasm beginning to build low and hot in his spine. “Everything. You can have everything.”
John unlocks the front door and lets himself in, takes the steps up to the flat slowly, the dread increasing with each riser.
“Katie Kravitz accepted my -- well, your -- friend request.” He swipes across the screen with his thumb. “This is outstanding. I have full access to her private posts, and she’s the sort that posts almost every single thing she does.”
“I looked at your memory files,” John replies. “I started to… I was going to look at the other stuff. I was. But I didn’t. I didn't want to.”
“Whoever picked out this mattress,” he tells Sherlock, “we should send them a thank you card.”
“Put your hands on your body,” John directs him. “Touch yourself all over.”
If he does, he will collapse, cease to function, like a laptop with a fatal virus, or a marionette with cut strings.
“You don’t have to hold your breath,” John tells him, unable to keep the small, fond smile off his face.“You can breathe through your nose, you just have to--” and he takes Sherlock’s head in his hands and shifts his approach, brings their mouths together at a new angle so their noses don’t mash into each other as they kiss. Sherlock reciprocates, tentatively at first, then with increasing enthusiasm as he realises with the new angle he can now breathe and kiss at the same time.
John narrows his eyes, tilts his head a bit as he contemplates. “Quite a few Pennsylvania number plates.” John considers a moment longer. “Which might make sense if we were just off the highway, but we’re well into town, and it’s not a great neighbourhood.”
The tension winds up even higher, up to the breaking point, the pressure almost unbearable, then something in him breaks free, and he feels himself begin to fall over the edge, the involuntary contractions beginning, his abdomen tightening and his cock twitching and beginning to spill before he feels the release. A split second later the orgasm hits him, a wave of incandescent, mind-numbing bodily pleasure that seizes every nerve ending and carries him to a place beyond, a place where nothing matters except the shuddering ripples of bliss that transcend life and death and the boundaries of his physical self.
Martinez leans back, crosses his arms. “And that’s all of it, right there?”
“No, I am,” John insists, though he can’t deny the lack of conviction in his tone undercuts his words more than a little. “I’m doing a lot better. I mean, I’m fucking exhausted and everything hurts and I’m marinating in my own filth, but if I could just have a shower and an actual meal, I would be doing pretty well. Considering.”
“All right,” John says, and he cringes at the way he sounds, at the measured,
It’s the silver minivan they saw in that same space the night before.
As their laughter fades to gasping giggles, John wipes away tears of mirth with his left sleeve, then picks up their intertwined hands and kisses Sherlock’s sandy knuckles, dry and gritty against his lips.
“First day of spring on the calendar,” he grumbles, shrugging out of his jacket, “and it’s a bloody blizzard out there.”
“You won’t speak unless I ask you a direct question, or to use your safeword. Do you understand?”
“And that concerns us because?”
Sherlock feels fragile, somehow, unmoored, dangerously adrift without that steadying hand.
“Believe so,” Sherlock replies.
“And what about Lou Andrews?” John asks. “We still don’t know how to find him.”
“Well,” John replies, noncommittal. “I don’t know I’d go
The him of five years ago would have been absolutely beyond horrified at his behaviour.
Admiration and resentment. Protectiveness and annoyance. Love and anger. Complicated. His feelings about Sherlock are always, always so goddamn complicated.
Sherlock nods. “Which brings us to Mary.”
He flicks off the light over the bathroom sink and returns to the bedroom, crossing the room on bare feet to slip into bed beside Sherlock's warm frame.
They go silent, words fading away as instinct takes over; they move together, the slap and slide of their bodies the only noise in the room save for the occasional moan or sigh. There’s no hurriedness, no urgency, no fear or worry or uncertainty, just the two of them, together, enjoying each other as time slows, stands still, the universe contracting to just the two of them joined like this, as close as human beings can be, making each other whole and complete.
“Ridiculous,” John mutters, but he opens the door and exits the car to do as he is bid.
John’s colour improves, slightly. He brings Chinese over and they eat lo mein while watching some crap reality show on ITV. He doesn’t smile, exactly, but he is alive and eating and
A tall man in his fifties steps out of the restaurant and begins to descend the steps. He has the the frame of a formerly athletic man running to fat in late middle age, dressed in a suit carefully cut to minimise his spreading midsection. He’s in possession of a full head of silvering, carefully coiffed hair, his hairline oddly shaped and low on his forehead.
“I know,” John says. “It was a real mess there, for a good long time. Took all the king’s horses and all the king’s men to save my arm, and even then the infections almost did me in.”
Sherlock makes a low, distinctly annoyed sound. “Oh for the love of -- ” he rasps, irritation and need co-mingling in his tone, a mixture that is so uniquely
“You have a remarkable number of law books,” Sherlock observes. “Most look like they haven’t been touched in a very long time. Suppose it stands to reason, since all the available public information indicates you aren’t a very good lawyer.”
Sherlock stares at him, completely blank, eyes wide and unblinking.
Sherlock’s heartbeat thrums under his fingertips, so insistently, undeniably alive.
It has begun to rain outside. The drops glitter on the dark-tinted glass of the car window.
“Accelerated decrepitude,” Seb offers around a mouthful of toast.
“Hiya, Watson,” the Chief says with a forced joviality, the tone of a man backed into a corner and preparing to climb over whoever he has to to get out of it.
“I’m not risking spilling anything on this posh furniture,” John says, carefully rising and making his way to the dining room table.
“I mean it, John.”
“I figured.”
“Well, yes,” John replies, regarding the director with curiosity. “You read the papers then, I take it.”
The skull remains silent, but his empty eyes seem to regard John with a softer, almost bemused understanding.
“Mycroft.”
John sighs and rolls his eyes.
“That he’s looking for drugs?” John supplies.
John is quiet for a moment, combing his fingers through Sherlock's tangled hair in a brief moment of shared respite.
Slowly, as if having an out of body experience, John drains his drink and sets it aside on the table before turning his hand slowly, palm up, so his and Sherlock’s hands press together.
?” Martinez laughs. “I don’t have the faintest damn idea where to find her. “
“John--” Sherlock says, low, at the same Caldwell raises his hand, just slightly, palm out. A show of civility, and also a gesture to his bodyguard.
Bleeding out into one’s pleural cavity is an incomparable sensation.
“Scott H?
a human by mistake?”
“Okay?” John asks softly, hoping against hope.
“Yes, John,” he breathed.
“Katie, what’s going on??? I just went to your Facebook, did you… what do you mean you’re leaving, why would you just leave? What about Lily, you can’t just... No, Katie, you’re scaring me, babe. Tell me where you’re going, okay? Just tell me where you’re going so I don’t worry. No, this is between us, you tell Adam to --”
“Essentially,” grumbles John sarcastically. “What the fuck does that mean?”
The other three percent he’s huffing, rolling his eyes, or barking single-word responses.
“Yes,” Sherlock replies tersely, inserting the flash drive into the USB port of his laptop.
“So everybody knew,” John says, feeling a bit like he’s having an out of body experience. “The whole time. Everyone knew.”
“Where were we?” he asks in friendly flirtatiousness.
“No Marquess of Queensberry rules here, I see,” Sherlock murmurs with a grin, clearly amused.
“In the bedside table,” Sherlock replies, his voice even but his face still flushed. John sits up, turns to his left to open the drawer. Inside is a tube of hand cream.
“Nine weeks,” John breathes out, the rage in him white hot and vicious. He could kill Mycroft right now without batting an eyelash. “Nine weeks. You
“What should we do?” he asks.
“Are you?” John asks, the anger buzzing in his brain threatening to gain the upper hand. “Are you really?”
Sherlock teases his nipple gently with his teeth before repeating the maneuver on the other side, licking and sucking at the rosy-brown nub until John is gasping his name and seeing stars. He slowly moves his way down John’s torso, exploring him with his lips and tongue, tasting him, pressing kisses into the softness of John’s belly as his large hands roam restlessly up and down the length of his body.
John realises that Sherlock...is afraid.
A small involuntary ‘oof’ of shock and surprise escapes his lips, but as usual his reflexes completely outpace his brain and he’s kissing back, feverishly, the feel of Sherlock’s wet demanding tongue in his mouth sparking the always-banked embers of his longing back into life.
Sherlock shakes his head. “Not anything. And I want to, now, with you. Very much so, but I’m concerned that you’ve been so much more--” He sighs in irritation. “This inability to express my thoughts is
“Chief Inspector’s asking for you.”
“I’m not going to change,” Sherlock says truthfully.
“...against NHS records. Insulin prescriptions. Look at hospital admissions. Got it,” John says, but Sherlock is drifting away again, his eyes fluttering closed.
“I want to help, sir,” Rocco says, voice rough. “Please.”
“I'm thinking I want to fellate you.”
“Yes, it opens from the inside.”
“Good,” John says. “Good.”
John gives a short huff of sardonic laughter. “No, I’m really--”
“God, John, yes, yes, fuck, oh God.” He babbles heedlessly at the wet heat of John’s mouth surrounding his testicles as his fingers stroke his twitching, leaking cock, gently first then more insistently. “I want,” Sherlock pants. “I want, I want--”
“Um,” he mutters, hopelessly awkward and suddenly feeling very shy.“Hey.”
John closes his eyes and swallows against a spike of pain. Sorrow pierces his heart for the crime of a stolen life, for the loss of something precious that never even truly existed.
“I know,” Sherlock says. “Neither am I.”
“I will always take care of him, Mrs. Hudson. That’s not about to change.”
“That’s wonderful!” Glenn exclaims.
“It’s dark,” he murmurs, barely above a whisper. “The blindfold. It’s the grey silk scarf you bought at Covent Garden last fall. The silk is raw, the texture is... rough but also soft.”
A leash. John has him collared and leashed like an animal. The humiliation of it lights his nerves on fire, shame and desire and submission twisting and building inside of him. He looks down at his cock, so stiff it rises almost flush with his belly, dark red and shiny wet at the slit.
“Quite so.” John cradles the side of Sherlock’s face in his hand, turns his head to kiss him thoroughly on the mouth. “You were that certain, hm?”
“Well, now that you know, I guess I can tell you a little more,” Greg says. “Sherlock was active in his early twenties. It wasn’t a good fit, I guess, and I think it was after he left them is when his real problems started. He was reinstated after... well, while he was gone. I was surprised to learn he went back to it. ” He looks at John. “How did you think he had the resources to go hunt down Moriarty’s web overseas?”
“That’s not what--”
I’m the closest thing he has to a friend.
“John. I can’t.” His deep gravelly voice is wound with tension, bordering on panicky. “I
“Tell me,” John said, kissing his forehead. “Tell me what you need.”
“How has Hamish Baker been posting every day for months?”
“I will never understand the human impulse to buy excessive amounts of staple foods in response to any kind of measurable snowfall,” Sherlock observes. “It’s not as if the delivery vans will be held up more than a day or two at most, and God knows the average Brit could stand to lose a stone.”
He stands stock still, hoping the woman will crack under the pressure.
It occurs to John that while he fully believes he and Sherlock are the loves of each other's lives, the two of them figuring out how not to royally fuck this up is actually going to take a
.” He’s annoyed now, but endeavouring not to show it. “Are friends so thick on the ground here you couldn’t use another?”
“I know I shouldn’t ask, but is he a suspect of some sort?”
“I believe that will do,” Sherlock says evenly. John nods and rises; with Sherlock keeping a weapon trained on Martinez, John keeps his newly acquired gun pointed squarely at Nestor, although at the moment the man is moaning, maybe sniffling a little bit as well, and generally not looking like much of a threat to anyone at the moment.
Sherlock
John remakes the bed (finding the bottle of lube lost among the tangled bedclothes and putting it into the night table drawer) and takes the soiled sheets out into the kitchen for tomorrow’s laundry. He returns to the bedroom, toes off his shoes; he’s sliding his belt out of the loops of his jeans when the ensuite door opens and Sherlock emerges, stiff prick flushed dark red and bobbing upright against his his flat belly, nude and unselfconscious and breathtakingly beautiful. John feels his mouth literally water at the sight of him.
“Jesus, Sherlock.” John’s voice is quiet but rough, choked with desire. “Do you know what you’re doing to me right now?”
The shivering spasms of John’s body and his name on John’s lips are more than Sherlock can withstand and he lets himself go, pounding into John hard and deep as his orgasm takes him, sweet silvery bliss starting low in his spine and pulsing out in electric waves, making him gasp as he snaps his hips hard one last time and spills hot and slick inside John’s tight passage.
Sherlock picks up his head. “I’ve wanted to do that for a very long time,” he says, his voice rough, catching a bit on the words.
-- I was. I thought you were watching him, too.
was he talking about?”
“No,” he rasps. “No. It hurts, it’s so... full, so much, but it’s good. It’s going to be good, I know it is. Just go slow.”
And when Sherlock steps out of the bathroom a few minutes later, damp, clean-shaven and clad in only underwear, John suddenly sees that the truth is really, ridiculously,
“Sweetheart. After what you’ve just been through...I don’t know if this the kind of thing we should--”
In this moment, John knows he will have to make a  judgment call. He doesn’t think about the lives this man has taken, the unforgivable acts he has committed. Instead he thinks about the patient in front of him, the terrible damage to his lungs, the slow lingering agonizing death that awaits him.
“You’re so amazing,” John murmurs reverently, kissing the damp curl at the nape of his neck.
“All right,” Sherlock calls, his voice tired and strained. Much as he endeavours not to show it, he is still gravely injured and still in considerable pain.
“Sherlock.” He squints, tilts his head, trying to form the question more fully. “I’m wondering about something.”
John is deep in his own space, feeding his own deep need as he swings the crop hard against pale and tender flesh, and Sherlock is suddenly terribly afraid, afraid of disconnection, afraid John is too far away from him--
In short, it’s rather like snogging a very large, overly enthusiastic mackerel.
John squints at her abrupt rudeness but says nothing, merely sighing a bit as he follows Sherlock to the hallway at the far end of the room.
Sherlock’s hands slide across the small of John’s back, move down to explore the warm curves of his arse. “Side table drawer,” he says quietly, the softness of his words a counterpoint to his insistent fingertips.
John shrugs one shoulder, nods. “The world is an imperfect place and all that. Still and all, I would rather you call the shots right now, in terms of...physical interactions.”
“It would be my pleasure,” John murmurs with a smile, leaning over to give him a long, lingering kiss, openmouthed, just the barest flicker of tongue.  The scent of sex still clings to him, earthy and musky and intoxicating, and for a brief moment John considers just dragging him back to bed.
But right now, alone for just a brief moment, the pain is still fresh and razor sharp, and John can’t stop the silent tears that begin to flow as Sherlock sleeps.
Sherlock looks at his brother briefly before shrugging his consent, broadcasting a bored indifference John somehow suspects he doesn’t truly feel. He unbuttons his slim jacket and sits down at the heavy polished table.
. He finds he now thinks of Lily that way, more often than not. It’s the truth, if not legally, then in all the other ways that matter. And as far as the legal bit, he and John have been feeling around the edges of that, now that the entire mess surrounding her birth has been fully straightened out. Lately, they’ve found themselves having brief, deliberately vague conversations around Doing Something About It. He suspects this is all going to end up with them married, sooner rather than later, shortly after one of them gets up the nerve to actually say the word outright.)
“You have me,” John murmurs, quiet and serious, wrapping his hands around Sherlock’s sheet-swathed waist. “All right? You’ll always have me.”
John looks up from the five across he’s been looking at blankly for far too long.
“I’m trying to keep you healthy and rested. I didn’t know you found that so offensive.”
Which makes it very much like flying, indeed.
“You’re my master,” Sherlock moans, meaning it, meaning every word, willing to surrender every cell of his body to John for eternity if it means John will end this torture and let him come.
When Mycroft speaks again, his voice is softer, kinder.
“My God, Sherlock," John mutters under his breath. "What a incredible
John can’t help the amusement that tugs at his lips. “Nope. You’re gonna stay in your pants for a while longer, I’m afraid.”
“That’s fine,” John tells her. “I’m happy to have a word.” Sherlock inhales with intention, as if about to speak and at length; John quells him with the sternest look he can muster in his compromised state, then turns his head to give the nurse a much milder expression. “I don’t suppose I’m allowed to have tea?” he asks politely.
“The gun,” he murmurs,
“Anything?”
John moans, quietly. “I’m, oh, fuck...I’m sure. I like feeling you open me up.”
“Clever pet,” John murmurs approvingly. “I don’t want to tie you down for your punishment. I want you to take it willingly.” Gentle fingers stroke his hair. “Are you willing?”
John shakes his head, collects himself. There is, after all, a pressing matter that requires their immediate attention. He releases his hold on Sherlock’s arm and swipes a hand across his wet face.
I mean it.”
“I do,” Sherlock says. “Unless you’ve another stun gun handy?”
“Don’t get arrogant, John. It doesn’t suit you.”
In the old days, Sherlock would have glanced at his phone briefly, made a face and then let Greg’s first call go directly to voicemail. If it’s anything above a four, he will call back between two and four more times, and if it’s above a six he will arrive at Baker Street in person within the hour.
“Talk to me, love,” he murmurs, tender and a little concerned. “Tell me what you need.”
“The man who was Maria’s contact in Philadelphia, according to the information we got from Dobrev’s office. His name was Lou, yes?”
But John cannot seem to follow his own advice, and he watches Sherlock, watches the rise and fall of his thin ribs. Now that the heat and passion of their initial encounter has passed, he can’t help the questions that rise unbidden to his mind, can’t but help but wonder about Sherlock’s origins, about his very nature.
“It’s not my Plan A,” Sherlock says defensively. “It isn’t. It’s a far second. An emergency backup, at most.”
John doesn't miss the flash of warmth in the detective's eyes at the words of praise. Then the moment passes and Sherlock exhales softly, almost a sigh. “Besides, you’ve always come through when I needed you. Always. I’ve never doubted it, and you’ve never let me down. I only--” he turns his face away from John, looks out the car window. His face is pensive, almost sad. “I only wish you could say the same of me.”
“How are you the way you are?”
John is no genius consulting detective, but he knew Sherlock had obeyed by the way his eyes slid down and away from meeting his own when he exited their bedroom, from his uncharacteristic quietness all day long at the Yard, from the subtle but unmistakable manner in which he shifted his arse in the hard, cheap conference room chair as the afternoon wore on.
“Stay,” John tells him as one would a dog. He rises, adjusting his painfully hard cock inside his now too-tight jeans as he crosses the small room and pulls a wooden chest he pulls from the back of the voluminous wardrobe. He pores over the items he had selected as likely candidates earlier in the day, then ducks into the loo to grab a clean bath towel. He returns to the bedroom, sets his selection of items at the side of the bed, removes the duvet and puts down the towel. before coming to stand behind Sherlock.
Sherlock looks down at John’s hand over his heart, and he knows with crystal clarity the decision he will always make.
As he waits for the kettle to boil, his eyes light upon his mobile on the counter. Before he can stop himself he picks it up, taps out a short text and hits send.
John stands, holds out a hand. “Let’s go find the panda Lestrade promised us.”
John turns his head, looks out the window and sees a herd of white-tailed deer, grazing peacefully in a fallow field in the lengthening late-afternoon shadows. They seem utterly oblivious to the busy six-lane highway and the cars rocketing lethally by mere yards away from them.
Sherlock drops gracefully to his knees in front of him. His normally pale face is ashen, and John knows he’s not imagining the barest trembling of that deep Cupid’s bow.
The island on the other side of the bridge is home to a cozy seaside hamlet, a sleepy beach town which is feels light years removed from the gaudy, vulgar neighbor next door. The shadows are lengthening, twilight encroaching as Sherlock pulls into a sparsely populated car park marked “Public Beach Access -- Permit Required”.
“Remember when you were six?” John shrugs off his coat, tosses it carelessly aside with his cane, sinks down into a nearby chair. “You and your brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window. You were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anyone that? Remember the spider that lived in a bush outside your window? Orange body, green legs. You watched her build a web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg hatched.”
John does, deep and hard, his wet lips smearing against Sherlock’s, breathing each other’s air, panting and moaning into each other’s mouths as they move together. The pace quickens, Sherlock gripping them both tighter, stroking harder, the friction and the slide of it so good it borders on unbearable.
“Very good, sir,” the young man replies. “Wheels up in forty minutes.”
“What?” Sherlock whispers.
“Two hours, hm?” John asks ninety-seven minutes later, carefully neutral in tone.
“I’m going to do so many things to you,” John growls low and rough, fucking harder into Sherlock’s curled fingers as the maddening hot itch of need spreads through his body. “I’m going to show you everything and you’re going to love it.”
“Jesus,” John murmurs.
(See the end of the chapter for
John shakes his head. “No, I’m fine for now.” He turns to Greg, brows knitting together in confusion. “Can I ask you a question, though?”
And for the first time in his life, he allows himself to believe.
An hour or so later, the sound of the card reader whirring and the click of the opening door rouse John from his light doze.
“What about me?” John answers, and he means for it to be playful but it comes out a bit strained; his balls are starting to ache, his belly throbbing with need for release, and as if reading his mind (or perhaps his testicles) Sherlock doesn’t waste any more time with teasing him, instead dipping his head without preamble and engulfing the sticky-wet, purpling crown of John’s cock with his mouth. His plush, shiny wet lips slide down the shaft, almost to the base, and back up again to suck almost daintily at the very tip before taking him back down his throat.
John gives him a look. “Yes.”
Approaching/touching from behind without asking
He can’t stand it for one moment longer.
As he pulls it up onscreen, John feels a stab of guilty remorse at how poorly he behaved earlier, how cruel he was to Sherlock. He reads the message with a frisson of anxiety, half expecting to be told off in no uncertain terms.
John scrolls. He only has to go through three entries (yoga, sunset, chopped parsley on a tabbouleh salad) to see his daughter for the first time.
“I’m absolutely certain,” John says. “Give me the phone.”
Aside from that he has no idea where he is or what’s happening.
Even with the red fog of lust enveloping his brain, John can see now why Sherlock is proving so damn good at this, at fucking, by viewing the physical mechanics of sex, of how their bodies work together, as a both a skill to learn and a puzzle to solve. He’s so bloody good at this already and he’s going to be absolutely brilliant in no time at all, just like he’s brilliant at everything he puts his genius mind to, and John is absolutely blessed, the luckiest bloke in the world to get to hold him and touch him and have him--
He stared at the small pile in front of him, willing it to divulge its secret. He began again, methodically going over each item a second time. A third time. Picking up the tube, he ripped apart the thick, hard paper, examining its layers.
Lestrade sighed.  He’d known better than to ask the question, but he’d felt it his duty.  When the police had caught up with the chap’s friends they’d said they watched “that tall fellow, there”, indicating Sherlock, push their friend over the rail.
Seeing the neatly mounted red balloon with the caricature of his own face (comically shriveled, and stained with whatever questionable trash that had followed it into the bin), John’s mouth parted in bewilderment. Sherlock had found it and kept it. “But that was over a year ago. Why do you still have it?”
He sighs and twines the fingers of one hand with mine.
“No, love,” John said, reaching for Sherlock, holding him close.  “Thou did nothing wrong.”
Sighing, Mycroft picks up the tumbler sitting beside his chair, taking a sip before he rejoins Greg in bed, gratified he was able to give Sherlock something he missed out on when he was young.  Such a precocious child.  But as Mycroft is about to rise from his chair, the mobile rings.  Who can it be at this late hour?  Looking down at the screen his brows lift in surprise.
safe.
“Yes, that’s it.
“As you are aware, he and Greg have been in a relationship for a number of years now.  Quite happily it seems, so I sought his viewpoint.  What he said was quite illuminating.”
Sherlock didn’t move except to straighten himself, his face growing pale with the effort.
He leans down—
“What is it, Sherlock?”
John stirs under the covers.  “Come to bed, honey,” he murmurs sleepily.  “They’ll be here before we know it and you need your sleep.”  He pats a hand in the empty space,
As ill-advised as it seemed to bring her along—most particularly for her—Sherlock couldn’t argue with her logic. Twisting the throttle, Sherlock eased the Vespa between two lanes of vehicles, and seeing the path ahead was clear, he zoomed forward, quickly leaving the seat of government, and his pursuers, behind.
Cedric squinted in Sir John’s direction. Though he had never known the Knight to be violent outside of the confines of his profession save for the need to protect an innocent life, it was not his place to override a command.  He would do as instructed.  Cedric drew his sword, raising his arms to swing its razor-sharp blade at the neck of man whose only response to a second death threat in one day was to roll his eyes.
“And this must be your daughter.  May I hold her?”  Mrs. Hudson stretched her arms out to take the little girl. “She looks
John sighed.
“Congratulations, by the way,” Sherlock tossed out as Colin hurried toward the door.  Taking the axe to the corner of the room and setting it next to the wall, Sherlock patted it, clearly disappointed he would not be putting it to use.
“Stop talking, Sherlock.  Wait.  How do you know she has a boyfriend?  Did she say something to you?”
No, neither John nor Sherlock sent the letters.
He sees me start to argue with him, but ignores me and continues.
Outside, Sherlock took a cigarette from Mycroft’s offered pack. Accepted the light. And waited until he took several long drags into his lungs before he spoke.
“Sir John.  I will return momentarily to help you return the horse to the stall.”
“Go back to bed, love.  Just because I can’t sleep doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.”  He looks so tired.  John never has been a good traveler, a circumstance that has become markedly worse in his advancing years.
“You are a sensible man, John Hamish Watson.”
Poking the threaded needle haphazardly into the fabric, Millicent set the embroidery hoop to the side and moved to the bed.  Taking the frail hand offered her, she cradled it in her hands.  She held it lightly; his skin, thin and fragile, be apt to tear with even the lightest touch.
“You were saying?” John asked, relaxing into the seat, but not without leaning a pleasing amount of his weight into Sherlock.
“I see you’re a friend of Clastenbury’s.  Any friend of Clastenbury’s is an enemy of mine.”  The sneer on the prisoner’s face was so cliché that John almost wanted to laugh.  But he didn’t, knowing without any doubt his life was in danger.
Wounded, Sherlock stood back, watching mutely as John jerked his jacket on and grabbed the handle of his carry on, wheeling it to the door. His back stiff as he stood at the threshold, John paused long enough to throw a “Merry Christmas” over his shoulder before hurrying down the steps.
Sitting at the bank of the Thames he contemplated a future he couldn’t envision.  Soon he would have to move out of the Army housing and he had no desire to search the ‘flatmate wanted’ ads.  Besides, who would want him for a flatmate?
Holding his gaze firmly, Nika explained it to him again. Maybe this time it would take. “I wish it were simply about the exchange of money, Mr. Holmes, but I do not have the ability to reverse what’s been done. Yes, I discovered the neurons upon which the programming is based, but it will take someone with, at the very least, computer science expertise to dismantle the code. And I can’t imagine it is something that could be fully reversed without having the victim in hand. In other words, it is not for lack of will that I don’t help you; it is that I cannot.”
“And what would that be, Mr. Holmes?”  The side of his mouth quirks up as he tries to figure out what will come out of mine.  Secretly, I think this is one of the reasons he finds me so intriguing, he never knows what I am going to say.  He doesn’t know if it is going to make him happy, or mad, or thoughtful, or perplexed.  Whatever it is it I always seem to surprise him; I am a walking Jack in the Box.
, be used to travel to…Las Vegas.  Whilst it was not a heated argument, it was a point of contention for several days.
“Okay, okay,” Stamford said. “You make an unexpected discovery. Can you look at from that point of view? Please?” Stamford wiped his brow, adding under his breath, “I never thought this would be so difficult. Those Fairy wings better be worth it.”
“Sherlock.”
“They’re on their way. And Sherlock?”
“Pity. Rather nice, isn’t it.”
Mayhew’s back slammed against the wall, Sherlock’s grip on his shirt collar pressing him into the hard surface.
rise to knighthood.  Tis clear?”
But Sir John and Aldus walked away, and Colin knew he had no choice but to face the gargoyle.
It was not until just after the sun crested the horizon that Sir John fell asleep; he could not stop thinking about Sherlock. About the exchange between Cedric and Aldus. About the fact he had been alone far too long; he was too young to live the rest of his life without a mate, a wife. A child. The thoughts swirled in his mind until he was so tired none of it made sense. His limbs grew heavy, his mind dull, and finally, blissfully, he fell asleep…
“How long has Dr. Watson been in love with you?” I ask quietly. This cannot have escaped the notice of the world’s most observant man. And even if it has, he needs to know.
Long seconds passed, but no response came.
I am magnanimous in my restraint not to tell John I was right; the mere fact that he refused sex is proof that I am.  But what do I do now?  I feel as if I have tried everything, and it is unquestionable how clever and devious I am.  But not only have my attempts not lightened his mood, he has grown increasingly dour.
That bugged him. He knew it wasn’t because they didn’t want to give bad news. Medical professionals had to do that every day; it was an unpleasant but necessary part of the job.
Lestrade pursed his lips.  He really did detest getting into the middle of these things, but he also didn’t want to see his friend abuse himself any further than he already had.  Sherlock could protest as much as he wanted, but he clearly did
In front of me are eyes filled with such gentleness I feel as if I could drown in them.  A mouth whose ends slant up into an impish smile, the tip of a rosy tongue teasing its entrance.  Gone is the pallor, the deep wrinkles, the skeletal-like physique.  This is not the John I last saw, the John who died.  This is the John I saw the day we met.  The day I have long known is the day we fell in love.  While I do not care what age he appears, to me his face is always the very definition of beauty, I am glad not to be reminded of the moments so heartbreaking there are no words to describe them.
, there might be hell to pay. For both of them.
I have an idea!  John and I should move to a warmer clime, one where we are free to sleep in the nude without fear of freezing to death.  Australia or Ethiopia, perhaps.   But, alas, I do not think John would be any more inclined to sleep without clothing.  “But what if there is a fire and we have to run out of the cottage, Sherlock?  Do you really want emergency personnel to see you in all your, uh, glory?” He would ask, his eyes straying to the region of my “glory”, his tongue playing with his lips.  It is no matter to me, but as enticing as John is I do not want
“John!  What do you see?”  He has reached the roof before me.  What is going on?!  First someone one in our chimney, then the pounding on our roof.  Now bells?!  Perhaps I am having a nightmare, one from which I will gladly wake.  Unless…  Is there a dead body on our roof? I tremble with anticipation; that would be the best Christmas present I could ever receive.
Wha-?
did Sherlock just do?!
“Thank you, honey.”
Humph.  The “big time”, as if London were a remote village in Iceland.
Sitting in the lounge chair on the veranda of her bungalow, gazing out at the waves lapping on the beach below, the warm breeze ruffled Janine’s hair, cooled the sheen of sweat on her skin.  Closing her eyes, she sought out and found the damp slit between her thighs, firmly massaging her clit with two middle fingers.  God that man was gorgeous.  What she wouldn’t have given to wrap her fingers in those curls and give them a good tug, watch those luscious lips part in surprise.
“That, I do not know.  Nay, I do know.  Nothing will be all right again until Sherlock be released.”  In the dim light, he could barely see Colin’s face.  “Thank you for everything you have done.”
John’s movements feel sluggish as he goes from bed to desk to retrieve his gun, but they become more confident as he checks himself in a mirror.
“Now wait a minute.”
“Mary?!  Why would he be with Mary?” Sherlock’s voice carried through the hallway, his astonishment causing him to forget the hushed tone he used.
Another sharp head shake.
Sherlock leaned in, resting his lips on those that moved gently beneath them.  Twas a chaste kiss, warm and soft; a kiss born not of passion, but of love.  A kiss that filled the hollow spaces in Sherlock’s chest.  And he sighed, with reluctance pulling back when John mumbled against his mouth.
“I’m 63, Sherlock.  I’m getting old.  Hell, I
What did that mean? Isn’t that what they always said? At best, it was a practiced banality to salve the distress of the uninjured. A disposable term to keep loved ones from getting in the way.
“Besides, Mycroft is never wrong.”  I say this with a glint in my eye.  But whilst we both detest admitting it, we know it is true.
“What are you doing?” John’s feeble protest deepened into a breathy moan. “Chri-” Throwing a palm flat against the wall, his other sought out the mass of Sherlock’s hair, tightening his fingers onto locks that curled around them.
A beloved face.
This time Sherlock wasted no time emailing John back.  He liked that John was interested in his work, that he thought he was ‘normal’, not knowing that he subconsciously wondered just how long that opinion would last.
As strained as his and Mary’s relationship had been the last few months, he still couldn’t see her turning her back on him; he had no doubt she wanted to remain married to him.  And yes, he was thought to be Magnussen’s killer, but it would be ludicrously hypocritical for her to pass judgment on him over
“Why be you such a wanker?”
:  Feel John’s back.  I stifle a whimper at the thought of doing so, the ecstasy it will surely bring.  Blowing a heavy breath out to right myself, I resolve to only touch it with my hand.  Surely to touch John with my fingers will produce similar results as with my lips, and to do so will make my actions less obvious.
Quickly getting down to business, Sherlock told John, “Here’s your new phone; Mycroft deactivated our mobiles so we couldn’t be tracked.  The important numbers you need are programmed into it, and it answers to the same number as your old one.
“But John, you told me to come live here.  How can you say you love me when you were willing to let me go?”
Sherlock snorted. “The MOD isn’t going to waste their time and what reputation they have left on a recording device, even one as sophisticated and innovative as the type that was implanted in you. No, it’s about power, John. It’s about ensuring that the British Empire restores some of the global influence it’s lost in recent decades. It’s no longer about land grabs and nuclear weapons, it’s about the ability to reach the masses, ordinary people living ordinary lives who are too numb to know they’re being manipulated to do things that go against their very nature. And that’s something that the MOD’s latest experiment can do.
Mary sat in the dark, trying to focus on the gentle rhythm of the rocking chair as she watched Sherlock sleep.  It would not do to get overly upset; it wouldn’t be good for the life she carried inside her.  But the movement that should have been soothing wasn’t helping.  Her festering anger grew as she watched him become agitated, gripping at his covers.  As she listened to the small, agonized moans that erupted into a startling shout.  “John!”
I smile as he gives me his ‘What the
My heart pounds against my rib cage.  It beats too quickly; its reassuringly steady rhythm lost to fear.  This time, I know they will kill me with their beatings. I have gone too long without giving the prison guard the information he seeks.
was one thing of which he never got bored.
“I know what I said, and I know you think twas because I be jealous.”  Aldus pursed his lips, thinking.  “Yesterday I would have been very much against it, believing it be not natural for men to love each other in the way a man and woman do.  But I barely slept last night thinking about Eduard dying; he be so young.  One does not know when one will die, so why not be as happy as one is able?  If Sir John were to die tomorrow, I would not wish for him to have been unhappy.”
John snorted.  Determined.
An enormous huff of air escaped John, leaving him weak from relief.
“Why did you get so antsy, Sherlock?”
“I don’t like pecans,” John said as Sherlock retrieved him from the bowels of his coat pocket.
When he saw Sherlock on his screen, to put the face he remembered with the brain he was getting to know, John sucked in his breath.  He remembered Sherlock was beautiful, but had thought that his brain had at some point been fried by the desert heat…no one could be that gorgeous.  But no, his memory had not played tricks on him, Sherlock was every bit the image of perfection he recalled.
He felt ashamed at what he told Sherlock minutes earlier, that the detective was ‘very important’ to him.  Whilst true, it had to have sounded as if a slap to the face.  How more patronizing could he have been?  But what else could he have said when he himself was only just now realizing what Sherlock meant to him?
“John! I need you to examine my neck!” Sherlock leaned back, pressing into John’s healthy leg.
Sherlock sat there listening to the words that, like bricks, built his wall back up around him, the wall that had been torn down by the small blond man so expertly, so effortlessly.  With dark eyes darting back and forth, he sat there thinking.  Wondering where the flaw was in Mycroft’s account, the loophole that meant John had survived.
At first, Sherlock did not think he had heard correctly, there be so much
, before-”
“Let us find somewhere to sit for a spell; I do not want thee to keel over.”  John’s eyes creased in worry, and he seemed poised to catch Sherlock at the slightest hint he be about to fail.
“But I am unhappy now that you are not holding me.”
“Your fiancé?  But, you said…”
Bringing his hands up, one to the beautiful face that was giving him life and the other to wind itself in the sensual mass of curls, John gave all of himself.
Ahhh, yes.  Twould be good to get home.
New clothes, fresh haircut. In preparation for today?  Hair dusted with a little more grey, but he couldn’t say it was an unattractive addition. No, not at all. Hands still, no tremor or agitation.  Shoulders squared , ready for whatever was to come. Eyes as deep blue and keen as before The Fall, healthy.  Eyes that searched his.  For what?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right, then. I think I’ll take that nap, after all. Let me know what time you want me out of the flat.” Careful to avoid looking at Sherlock, John got up and hurried to his bedroom. He needed to escape; suddenly, it was more than his head that hurt. He’d tried to prepare himself for this day, the day Sherlock might bring someone home, but he’d never thought it would cause him actual physical pain.
“I do not like that this is the last item on your bucket list.”  There.  I said it.

He must have dozed, at least a few minutes, because when he opened his eyes, across from him sat an imperious man looking at him over a beak‑like nose.

“His knife. Where is his knife?” Sherlock patted Eduard’s hips. “Cedric? Aldus? Did he not have it with him?”
“If it will help, John, I—”
“Do not take Sherlock’s ways to heart, he be decent enough once he gets to know you.”  Aldus took a portion of the bundle from Colin’s arms, stuffing it into a wooden box.   “And Sherlock’s as smart as they come, he is.  I was only angry with him for what he said about Cedric, but if Sherlock says Cedric killed Eduard, then I have no doubt he did.  But it does not make it any easier to believe.  I will miss Cedric; a good friend he was.”
“No dear.  I don’t want statistics, I want to know
mine.  And because with just one look he tells me I am everything he ever wanted.  Because, even after all this time, with one touch he tells me I am all he needs to make his life complete.  Because with one gently spoken word, be it ‘love’ or ‘sweetheart’ or ‘honey’, he tells me there is no one he treasures more.  And that he can do this with Katie, JJ, Jacob, and Jennifer, too, making us each feel we are most valued?  How can one not revere such a man?
“Sir John,” it began.
“...but if there is one thing I know, it is you.  You may be the smartest person in the room, you may have studied cigarette ashes and ciphers, and a thousand other subjects that may or may not come in handy one day, but there is one thing you haven’t studied.  And that is

“I be sleeping.  I heard an ‘umph’; it must have been when Sir John be hit.  Twas dark, but I saw a knife come down and stab him.  I rose to defend Sir John, but as I grabbed the intruder, that must be when he stabbed me.  I tried to overpower him, but he be too strong, and he ran.  He escaped into the woods.”  Cedric jutted his chin out, as if daring anyone to challenge his assertion he had done everything he could.
Had he known he was about to meet the person who was to become the love of his life, he would have been intrigued to know there could be such a thing.  He had, of course, heard the phrase, but had never given thought to the possibility it might apply to him.
John, helping the other man walk, calmly, but resolutely, told the guard, “This man stepped on a broken bottle out there.”  He nodded his head to a far corner of the yard.  “The soles of his shoes are thin and it cut all the way through, puncturing his heel.”  Under his breath he muttered, “So much for prison reform.”

Responding in Sherlock’s stead to Dr. Watson’s question, I say, “Enchanting. It was an enchanting evening, indeed. That would be what Sherlock would say.” As I speak, I sift quickly through a list of romantic tropes, those prompts that bring a reluctant lover’s feelings to the fore. I must get Sherlock and Dr. Watson moving in the right direction.
beneath the unfamiliar bath gel still clinging to him from a recent shower.
He looks at his watch.  “We still have, oh, an hour before the ship docks.  What do you say to a little…recreation?” John slides his hand up my thigh, a smirk on his face.
Looking at the time on his laptop, 12:12—he needed to get to Hackney, and soon—Sherlock restarted the video, bracing for more revelations. But after John deleted the confession, no more was said in the same vein, instead, changing subjects to talk about Mrs. Hudson and the case they’d been on the night before.
Over the next few weeks a pattern of communication developed that Sherlock found to be easy to engage in, despite his preference for texting.  He liked talking to John, liked that John never seem to get bored talking to him and even if he didn’t understand what Sherlock was talking about he would ask questions and never hint that what Sherlock had to say was odd or annoying.  John was never anything but kind and interesting.
“If I was trying to kill you, you’d be dead,” John informs her bluntly as he palpates the area none too gently, making her flinch and hiss in pain.
John waits.
, the morphine doesn’t take away the pain so much as it makes it seem somehow remote and easier to ignore) as much as he feels like he’s been rearranged, chopped up roughly then put back together from the inside out.
“That was smart,” John says encouragingly. “Good job, Patricia.”
John’s hand presses hard against his scars, the lines of his name carved into Sherlock’s flesh.
“Hmm?”
“It was just… you know how mums do that thing, that instinctive thing where they bounce, just a little? She was doing that. And it made me think about how…” John shakes his head, tries a slightly different angle of approach.
“He really is,” Sherlock replies coolly from the doorway.
“Jesus,” he mutters. He looks over his left shoulder and sees Sherlock hovering in the doorway.
“I was tested monthly for six months after my drugs lapse. You were tested for STI’s when you learned of Mary’s infidelity, as well as six weeks after. We’re both completely clean, and you’re the only person I’m ever going to have sex with, and I’m the last person you’re ever going to have sex with. I don’t want to use condoms.”
“No,” he snaps. “No, I do not have to understand a damned thing. We have an agreement in place, and I don’t -- ” He closes his eyes, rubs them with shaking fingers. “This has nothing to do with -- you know what? Fine. Forget it. Forget it, and thank you for absolutely
Sherlock exhales, lets himself relax into the comfort of John’s flesh and skin and bones, feels the rise and fall of his ribs against his chest, the soft sound of his deep, even breathing.
Behind the closed doors of Baker Street, the detective was frustrated and angry, devastated by his failure, both in solving a case and in saving a life.
He wraps another towel around his arm, watches the white cotton turn crimson as he tries to to calm his racing pulse and figure out what he should do next.
Something in Maria’s eyes shifts, almost softening into something like pity. “You want to think I’m broken, that I’m defective, but maybe I’m not the one who’s wired wrong. Look at you, Sherlock. You wanted nothing as much as you wanted to be just like me. You wanted to climb over people and never give a damn and yet you could never quite pull it off. Because you
He remembers a line from a film, one of his secret sentimental favourites.
“Right,” Sherlock murmurs, the reassuring note in his voice not ringing precisely true. “Exactly right.”
His face must be terrifying, because Sherlock sits down and picks up a fork, cuts a piece of fried egg and puts it in his mouth. John sits in the other kitchen chair, pinches the bridge of his nose and shakes his head.
“If I’m out past dark, I’ll text you,” she says, pulling on her gloves.
“Can we…” John begins, then cuts himself off with a short-self conscious chuckle as he rests his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. “I like being close to you,” he murmurs. "Can we just...”
I look back uncertainly to the sitting room.
“Do you find my distress amusing, John?”  I ask as if affronted, but pleased that my plan to make him happy has borne fruit.
Looking up at the magnificent creature beside him, John found he had trouble breathing. His heart pounding in his chest, he whispered, “Yes, ‘oh’.” John licked his lips, suddenly parched. “I- I am so…you are so…”
“Be there something I can do for you, Sir John?”  Aldus asked from the corner of the room.
“I…I never told you I love you.”
Flying up the stairs to the flat, he reached the top, fighting for air. Not because he was out of breath, but knowing, even before he looked into the flat, what he would see. Knowing that what he would see would likely be the end of him.
But this was no date for which he dressed; it was for the most important meeting of his life.  One that would decide what direction his remaining days would take.
Sherlock felt a spark of panic.
“Do not blame Cedric, he be weak from his injury and I made him lie down.”  Aldus’s cheeks flamed, and he took a concerted interest in his cooking.
“Daddy!”  Katie ran to me and I picked her up and gave her a kiss.
“But thou has not heard--”
Andi’s mobile pinged, and she checked the sender. Mycroft.
“Oh.”  John cleared his throat, too startled to pull his hand away.  “And just what do you conclude from
Her explanation that she fell in love with one of her marks somehow didn’t ring true, but no matter how much he argued that they were meant to be together, she stood firm in her resolve.  One day she simply didn’t come home and he hadn’t seen her since.
“Of course, I didn’t.  Living and working with you was one of the greatest privileges of my life; I’m just sorry it took so long for us to be together again.  But here we are and we’re never,
“You all right, honey?  Are you sure you’re ready for this?”  His voice is soft, his eyes searching.
“No, John.”
.  There’s not a chance in hell I’m going to miss the birth of our first grandson.  Now,
Now John was really puzzled.  If the police had come and gone, why was Sherlock still here?  And why wouldn’t he come down to meet him?”
“No, of course not.”
Before he could take a step, he froze.  His chest heaving, for the second time that day he struggled to breath.
I kiss his shoulder and say it again, stronger this time.  Believing it, because it is true.
“People believe what they want to believe, John.  Dressed in your armour, adorned with your crest, adapting your mannerisms.  In the back of their minds they may question it, but they will not seriously consider it to be anyone but you.  As thou says, what fool would take thy place?  Thou should know by now, John, I be no fool.  I would not undertake this if I did not think it the best way to rid our lives of Cedric.”
My own back starts to ache from the angle at which I am massaging him.
Cedric scowled, and storming past John and Sherlock, pounded down the stairs.
capable hands.”  To keep up appearances he cleared the few steps between them and gave her a hug before holding the door open for her to get back into the car.
“What?!  Mycroft always leaves a pack for when he visits.  Now where ARE they?!”
dead. You don’t get to see Rose. You won’t ever know what’s going to happen with her. On the other hand, if you disable the bomb, we’re both out of here. You’ll go to prison, but you’ll be out. Someday. And I can make sure you get pictures of your dog. If you’re dead, you get none.”
I was so, so stupid.  So childish.  John deserved better from me.
Switching on the nearest lamp, his eyes rebel against its brightness, and as he listens to the voice on the other end of the call, I watch him.  Watch his shoulders square, the deep breath he draws in and releases slowly through his nose as he clenches his jaw.  How he squeezes his eyes shut for the briefest of moments, bracing himself against whatever this person is telling him.  His tongue darting out of his mouth, he moistens his lips and takes another deep breath, fortifying himself.
I thought I would be able to hold it together better than this; I mean after all, I didn’t shed a single tear when I married Mary.  But today?  Marrying the man I’ve been in love with for so many years?  I...I don’t have words for it.  Thank God I wrote my vows down or I don’t think I would ever get through it, hanky or no hanky.
? Really?”
During the day, however, Sherlock is quiet, carefully polite, reserved to the point of being distant. He responds, mostly civilly, to John’s comments and queries but doesn’t initiate conversation himself.
Sherlock says nothing but stands still for a moment, allows John to peck his cheek before he turns away, muttering something to himself about mass spectrometry.
“I’m sorry, John,” Sherlock says quietly. “I truly am, but you saw tonight what she is capable of, and you are an unconvincing liar. If you had known for certain and she found out, she would have easily killed you without a moment’s hesitation. It was a huge risk involving you at all.” He looks down at the ground. “I
John moves the cloth off Sherlock’s thighs, massages cream into sore flesh. “You’re my responsibility, Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
John sees Sherlock’s eyes flicker microscopically to John’s gun, ten feet away on the concrete floor, and he a spike of sick fear runs him through as comprehension dawns about what Sherlock is planning. He sees it all unfold in his mind’s eye; absent a plan, Sherlock is calculating the incredibly low odds on being able to dive for the gun and snatch it up in this scant moment of Mary’s divided attention. John’s nowhere near the head for math as Sherlock, but he knows the odds are terrible, so low Sherlock will almost certainly end up sacrificing himself just to give John a miniscule chance of avoiding the black van that will take them to an undoubtedly nightmarish fate.
“You play beautifully,” John says, his voice rough and low as he gazes at the long pale line of Sherlock’s neck, the strong angle of his jaw, dusted with the beginnings of a gingerish stubble. The simple, uncomplicated humanity of that imperfection, that mark of an exhausted man needing a shower and shave and a good night’s sleep--it makes something blaze forth inside of John, hot and bright and wanting.
Disappointed and restless, Sherlock pokes desultorily at his violin while John types up some case notes (despite Sherlock’s eidetic memory, they often come in handy, later, though the detective would rather be strung up by his toes than admit it). John is just coming to the end of his scribbled pages when Sherlock lays down his instrument and gazes at John’s bent blond-silver head as he types in his painful two-finger style. Without a case to distract him, their conversation of four days ago returns to the forefront of his mind.
They wait one beat, then another.
“I love you,” John murmurs and kisses him, soft and wet.
John glances over at the Chief. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, and he sees his own understanding mirrored in the older man’s weary brown eyes.
Sherlock’s bare fingers come up to brush his cheek, come away red. “You’re hurt,” he murmurs, something in his icy eyes softening.
