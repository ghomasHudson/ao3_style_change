He's never felt so uncomfortable and cut short when telling Anna goodbye before. Is she really so concerned that Dean is as bad as his father assumes? She doesn't even know him. Neither does his dad. It's getting a bit ridiculous at this point.
He does, several times in fact, on the way there. He lists pain and needles and possible infection as his reasons, among other worst-case scenarios, but neither of his companions wants to hear it. By the time they make it through their small town and into the neighboring mid-sized city where Ruby’s shop is, he’s accepted his fate. The red neon sign for
to say it. I think she knew I was lying, but she seemed almost angry. She cut our appointment short. When I left, I swear she mentioned Dean instead of the name I gave her. None of it made sense."
Dean offers his bottle, but Cas shakes his head. "I had a rather adverse reaction to mixing alcohol with my medication last night that I’d rather not repeat."
this chapter describes a panic attack, so if that bothers you, this is a lil heads up. my apology comes in the form of offering you the first Big Romantic Tension Moment. i really enjoyed writing this chapter, so i hope y'all enjoy reading it. my inspo songs were i wanna be your girlfriend by girl in red and private fears in public space by front porch step.
There's an entire stash of Castiel's clothes that never made it back to his house laid out in front of Meg as she scrutinizes them in an effort to pick the best outfit.
“Keep your money to yourself,” she says, holding his gaze. “You’re something special, Castiel. I don’t know if you see that yet, but you will. Don’t let anyone steal that shine of yours.”
A girl with shiny dark curls and heeled leather boots under her polyester gown pushes (if not a bit aggressively) towards him through the crowd that has dissolved into joyful chaos, and he instantly matches the grin that shows off her dimples. He's already waiting to catch her when she practically dives into his arms and clutches him tight enough that their hearts pound against each other's chests.
"Oh, I like you, pretty boy." She thinks for a moment, considering, which can be a dangerous thing coming from Meg. "I dare you to get your ear pierced. Hoop. Cartilage. Promise it'd look good on you. I’m being nice since you were so quick to agree." Before he can protest, she adds, "And don't say you don't know where to do it; my cousin Ruby owns a piercing and tattoo shop. I’ll text her right now."
With a start, he jumps back and shakes his head in an attempt to rid himself of other Castiel's unnerving stare before rushing to leave. He's gotta find Meg. He needs to go home before he has a fucking panic attack.
"Thanks, cuz,” She tells Ruby. “I’ll see you around. I’m going to go see what other trouble I can convince these innocent kids to get into."
Pam seems dazed, blinking rapidly as she lifts her head, but offers an attempt at a reassuring smile. “How did I do? Did the guides have anything interesting to say?”
The music filling the room is so loud that it feels like the beat is playing the drums on Castiel's ribcage.
“Will you stop?” Meg chides, sliding her arm around his. “It’s fine. We’re going to make a new friend. A friend who already seems to like you.” At his unconvinced expression, she adds, “I won’t leave you.”
His mother was a skeleton in the closet, locked up tight in the farthest corner of his mind. He rarely ever dared to peer inside, always praying that she'd leave to haunt someone else. She never did.
Castiel wouldn't be so apprehensive about calling his father if A) he wasn't about to lie, which he only ever did to cover for Meg, rather than himself and B) she wasn't staring so intently at him as he listened to the phone ring.
He feels a tap on his shoulder and sighs before reaching to turn down the music. "Dean, if you're going to be weird about it, we can take you home."
Strange, sure. It didn't mean anything - at least that's what Cas told himself. It was something he chose to ignore once he woke and the memories of his dreamworld would quickly slip away.
The crystal ball flickers to life, casting a soft white glow on her and Cas’s skin in the dimness of the room. Pam remains focused, her eyelids trembling as if trying to fight the urge to open. She grows more drawn as moments pass, a troubled look on her face, until suddenly her features go slack, and her posture straightens. She should try her hand at acting if this doesn’t work out. It’s taking everything that Castiel has not to chuckle at the theatrics.
Castiel wants to tell her that there is such a thing as oversharing, but he knows she means well, even if she’s not great at it sometimes.
"Castiel's phone," he answers. A slightly panicked female voice immediately speaks over him. "Meg, hey. It's Dean. I-" Meg cuts him off with something that draws a chuckle out of him. "Yeah,
i didn't work my inspo songs into the chapter well, but i did throw in plenty of familiar faces. ;) also, i hope you all enjoy steve the cat.
“Aw, Cas. You’re such a sweetheart. Don’t worry, we’ll see each other again.” She pats his hand. “I'm so proud to see you head out into the big world. Both Dr. Milton and I are. Speaking of, she will be with you here in just a minute.”
He'll have to tell Dean eventually. He just has to have the right words, which are hard to find when he doesn't have an explanation as to why his father disapproves of Dean. In the meantime, each time the thought gnaws at him, he distracts himself with learning more about his new friend.
The four friends arrive at an elaborate red cloth tent that looks out of place next to its white vinyl neighbors. The curtains that make up the doorway are held back by tasseled golden ropes and are only open just enough to allow the smell of incense and the sound of soft music to flow out from within. A wrought iron easel sits out front holding a hand painted wooden sign that reads “The Mystic Lady: Madame Pamela Barnes” in bold gothic lettering. A dark haired beauty peers out as they approach, greeting them with a welcoming smile and waving them inside.
He can hear the echo of distress in Dean’s voice from seeing him so broken and wanting nothing more than to help him. Making sure he wasn’t overbearing but reassuring. There wasn’t any doubt that he’d have done whatever Castiel asked at that moment.
It had been a Saturday in June, hot as hell and lined up to be as boring as any other weekend in a small town when twelve year old Castiel decided that fairytales were bullshit and soulmates didn't have to be romantic.
Castiel ducks down. “Yes, dad. Don’t worry about us. Be careful on the way to your writing seminar. Good luck.”
Dean picks back up at his carving slower this time, and Castiel notices that the lines have begun to form four crude letters: D.W. and C.N. "Nah, man. Don't worry about it. Sorry for hitting you with the click flick shit."
"Hello, handsome," Castiel greets, crouching down to offer Steve a customary scratch behind the ears, which he accepts with a resounding purr before following his human companion inside.
“If I was smart, I would’ve had a plan for Sammy and me by now. But I don’t, Cas. I have no fuckin’ clue what I’m going to do for the rest of my goddamn life. I barely graduated because I didn’t care. He won’t say it, maybe he doesn’t see it now, but one day Sam’s going to realize I’ve never been anything to look up to.”
He didn't mention it to Dean the day he told him his favorite color, but when things make him genuinely happy, it feels like yellow looks. A soft shade, like filtered sunlight through the thin curtain of a reading nook while reading a gripping novel. Or the color of an old blanket laid out on the grass for a picnic on a perfect afternoon. Warm. Safe. Comforting.
His friends are leaning against the paint chipped hood, deep in conversation, as some nineties rock song plays from the stereo. They don't notice him yet, too caught up in whatever joke they're sharing. Meg's hand goes to Dean's shoulder for support as they double over in a fit of laughter and the sight sends a flood of affection through Cas's chest.
“Hello?” he moves back further against the seat. “Hi, dad. What’s up?” There’s a low hum of John Winchester’s voice over the line, and Dean begins to frown as he goes on. “Yeah. Yeah, I’ll be home soon. Alright. Bye.”
"Then why didn't you, I don't know, feel comfortable telling me? This past month... I mean, I talk to you every day, man."
“I’d like that,” he says instead. “I’d also like to take off this costume and wash the parking lot filth off of myself, so I’ll be right back.”
"I promise we'll be safe, daddio. You know you can always count on me." Meg leans her head on Castiel's shoulder with a sweet smile. Everyone knows better.
“Ah, Sammy’s fine. Spends most of his time with his books or talking to his girlfriend, Jess, when I’m not bugging him. He’s the one who had to convince me to get some real friends other than him.” He pauses. “Now that I say it out loud, that’s kinda embarrassing.”
“No, Dean, I… I should never have insulted you”, he sighed and looked down at his bed, “I am being a terrible host. I lost my temper… I shouldn’t have. Would you please forgive me?”, he asked, rising nervous eyes to the hunter.
“We got out in time”, Dean added in a dismissive murmur, “Dad handed me Sammy, told me to run. He tried to wake mum up. None of us understood what had happened until people in the neighborhood started screaming”
Dean fluttered his eyes closed, his breathing slowed, and Cas was almost sure he had already drifted back to sleep. But then he blinked them open and searched for him.
He felt protective of Samandriel. Respect and certain fondness towards Michael and Lucifer. And he shared a strong feeling of camaraderie with Uriel, due mostly to how much of bookworms they both were.
Dean found himself kneeling. He rose his furious gaze, got one foot on the ground. His fists were balled by his sides, knuckles cracking.
The mention sombered Cas a bit, but he braced himself not to show it. It made his smile disappear, though.
“I want you. I want to try this, Cas”, he said, eyes locking into his, heart pounding, “I… I think we got a pretty good shot at this. I can´t… promise you now we will be together forever but… I
With the endrega on his heels, bellowing; Castiel parted with a last burst of force the twisting vines that rose in front of the bushes that made the body of the plant creature, the acid flowers he had wanted so much to get away from in front of him.
Poor Cas. This chapter is mostly to show the shock he faces in front of all the new things. The filthiness of the real hunting giz, the crudeness on how Dean dispatches the last monster, how he´s just not trained or accostumed to any of this... He´s gotta suck for now xD I love it- cause it leaves room for character development ^^  This whole story is about how much Cas learns, grows and matures through the story.
“It’s not a bad job. An important job. Maybe not one with a high survival rate, however”, the mage conceded with a tilt of his head.
Dawn had come, and it cast long shadows upon the still dim place. The trees, the grass beneath his feet, everything was the same. Including the corpses of a pack of woodland fiends.
The charging creature passed him as he faceplanted against the ferns. He had learned how to roll at one point in his training, but he had no idea how to do it in a ground full of plants, and anyway he was so nervous he didn’t remember the motions. He got to his feet, completely out of breath, limbs burning; but tried to gulp on his dry throat and started running back towards Dean again.
“Hmm”, Dean grunted in what Cas really hoped was a clinical examination of the dark marks, and not a slightly condescending appreciation of his not so muscular physique, “Doesn’t look too bad. I get a bit more than that from a potion. You should be fine for now. Possibly can take several doses like that”
“Don’t worry about me, Cas. I’m fine, promise. I ain’t helping nobody by bleeding out. If I need help, I’ll tell ya”, he said in a low murmur without looking at him, “Rest and eat. You’ll patch me up when you feel better”
In a merciful turn of events, Dean turned his head to look towards him for the first time in what seemed like an hour, and he slowed down until he stopped. Cas stopped by his side, hands on his knees, feeling incredibly grateful.
The angel put his hands over his, smiling across his tears; and for a second, everything stilled. Everything stopped. There was only green and blue, and Dean´s beating heart and that stupid
Castiel frowned, and it seemed that sadness was sinking deeper and deeper into him. Dammit, this was going all kinds of wrong…
“Yeah”, the hunter smiled a bit, “You gotta know how to move in the wilderness. Follow trails, for example. We’ll have you kill something easy today if you’re up for it”
“With your light, and your shadows...”, Castiel continued with that devoted look of his. Then he turned uncertain, “If… this is really how you feel... If it´s what you really want, if you´re sure…”
“Well”, the hunter made a brusque movement with his sword to one side, ichor splashing from it, “Until you are- if you ever are- you be extra careful. Look around you, at all times. I haven’t stopped checking around since we stopped, if you haven´t noticed. You gotta do the same”
The mage scowled and raised both arms in a wide circle, fingers curling as if he was grabbing the whole world.
“What’s the big deal? I merely have bruises, and the slash on the side’s just a cut. It bleeds a bit and annoys me if I bend. Small business”
Eyes closed, eyebrows frown, his awareness traveled into organs and muscles, tissues and blood vessels. He felt the tear on his stomach, the ruptured abdominal cavity, the strain the whole system was under to try and keep the body alive through pain and blood loss.
Dean huffed out a breath, obviously uncomfortable, anguish in his eyes. He looked as restless as an animal in a cage. Cas understood- he had thought he was finally leaving, right that moment…
“I thought healing magic was like potions. Potions don’t fix cirrhosis, that I know for sure”, he snorted, “Most of the hunters I know chug’em on a daily basis, but that ain’t stopping the alcohol reaper”
He hadn´t known the sigil had been ruined before jumping into fire with him, but he didn´t have to mention that at that moment. And it hadn´t been on his plans to get barbecued by then, or to stay behind; he totally had thought they could leave flying together.
Dean´s labored breathing was the only thing that broke the stillness for some seconds. The hunter had stepped over the fallen mage, dagger held in an upside-down grip; and stayed on his guard scowling at the creature, until it hadn´t moved for almost ten seconds.
Dean snorted and shook his head. Then he frowned and wiggled a bit to be able to drop back into the bed again with a huff, closing his eyes for a second. Then he turned his head on the pillow to look at him… calculating.
in a long while, but it rapidly left him without pain or scarring. Everyone in the kingdom had suffered the disasters. Everyone had had to learn their own way to cope, to accept what had happened, and move on.
“It’s different”, he finally said, eyes lost in the middle distance in concentration, “I know that I will have to fight, and kill, for survival. So yes, if at some point I need to eat, I will kill too. But… that is not the case right now”
- Jake Abel and Tyler Johnston (Samandriel) really look alike, right?? ^^ I love them being brothers.
The mage shook his head and closed his eyes, dismissing Dean. He started taking deep breaths, stilling his thoughts, leaving the pain out of his awareness. He pictured his whole body on his mind. He could feel every damaged tissue on his body, the blood flowing onto the sheets. He collected all the strength he had left, took one last deep breath, and opened his eyes.
, he remembered again; and Cas looked around, heart thumping frantically on his chest. He located another trail of moving ferns going his way and he turned to face it, angel blade tightly gripped on his hand, jaw tense.
“Help me get it inside”, asked the mage, kneeling beside the wolf as he stretched the open end of the bag to a width unbelievable for anyone who ignored the magical nature of the item, “I will drop it in the forest when we go”
He looked at Cas. He had no idea how late he had gone to bed, and he knew he needed the sleep to keep the Corruption at bay. Dammit, if he had the damned tattoo… He sat on the bed, got up again some time later. Flipped some of the pages of that monster atlas with the stupid wrong names. But at some point, he realized he had stalled as much as he could, given Cas as much rest time as possible, and he was wasting precious daylight.
He tried to smile, and Cas smiled in return. He took a deep breath and let it out. Jesus, his nerves were going to explode one of these days, if he kept not finding his brother.
No hope shone in Sam´s eyes. His brother extended his arms to wrap them around his wife, defeated, and they both melted together, kneeling to the ground. The angel advanced to stand between them and the flames, ruined arm dangling uselessly at his side.
“You said you can´t do anything big”, the hunter said, looking at him very intently, “Is teleporting a big thing? Or can you do it?”
“I... don´t know, is there somewhere near you´d like to try?”, he tried to continue the charade with a calm expression.
Cas gulped. He still felt the phantom pressure of Dean´s fingers on him… But he shook his head. This was no moment for such thoughts.
the gaps of his pelvis, diving down into his covered groin, and he gulped. Dean looked at him with a weirded out expression as he tilted his head. A big drop of water fell from his hair at the movement, sliding down his neck, hitching for a second on his clavicle, to finally continue its journey down his pectoral.
His ashen, pained face just made a sweet smile, as if thanking him. As if saying that it was okay. That he was happy. That it was enough. That it was really okay. There was only a little bit of sadness, but his fond eyes seemed to say
He had no time to change, no time for a shower. He took the silver basin that was still on the floor beside the bed with dirty water from the night before, and took it to the nightstand that was closest to the mirror on the wall, the left one. As the basin touched the wood, the water was instantly clean. He splashed a bit on his face, hoping it would erase the remains of his sleep, and tried to comb his disheveled hair with moist fingers. It was a poor substitute for correct hygiene, but he could not waste a second. Luckily, he didn´t need to shave.
“I actually do”, answered the mage, leaving the dagger on the nightstand again, “You were willing to attack me”, he said in an accusatory tone, frowning.
he never explained to anyone, and no one ever had gotten out of him where he went. Their mother did not ask nor seemed to mind, as long as he fulfilled his responsibilities. And his time for running away was coming to an end, given the ultimatum their mother had given him.
“I don’t have more answers for you right now, Dean”, the mage turned to him with a slightly sad frown, seeming tired, “I can only know more after I speak to my brother again”
“Well, I gotta say, that monster repellent smells like hell, but works like a charm”, the hunter said as he took his bag from his shoulders and dropped it on the forest floor beside him, “We haven´t found anything yet. Last time I was here, I had to stop and fight something every ten fucking minutes”
the spell that what it’s looking for, is an essence. That’s the most confusing part for me. And your blood, tells the spell which essence specifically”
The hunter snorted at that. The rabbit munched on some low leaves, completely unaware that his demise was being debated. Cas was practically pouting.
. Sure, woodland fiends were huge and easy to dodge if you spotted them from afar… Unless you run to them to see what they were eating and got into fighting range.
“Well, you know you can crash here as long as you want, and the warding here is excellent”, he mentioned in a tone of voice reserved for real state vendors commenting on how good water pressure is.
“Stop assuming it´s a boy, Dean”, Sam chided slightly, smiling, “We may go simply with a gender-neutral name”
Seconds passed. Grunting, muffled sounds of protest soon turned into dizzy groans, that turned into silence. Dean raised his hands and let the guy breathe, as Sam let the other man drop to the floor. They both checked their pulses and nodded to the other.
Gah! I´m sorry I didn´t post last Sunday. This was gonna be one of the chapters that came with an audio clip- I wanted to do a little montage of me narrating the first action scene to some epic music. However, last week was creatively very exhausting for me- I got eagerly back on the horse of Dreams of Perdition and published a chapter of it, then two days later I got the idea for the little scene in Try (15x19 fix-it-fic), I´ve started to plan a roleplaying game in the Supernatural world (which has got me writing and designing so many things)... And when Sunday night came I just felt I couldn't do more xD
“I remember his love. His patience. I remember sitting on his lap while he told me stories. I remember him nursing me back to health, patiently by my bedside. I remember that for a time, probably after he spent so much time healing me, he paid more attention to me than to any of my other eight siblings”, he said with a guilty smile of glee, “I remember his lessons. His values. I just don’t remember, you know. His face, or his name. But that’s not important. I remember who he was, in the way that matters”
The old hunter just made half a smile as he turned around and rummaged inside a bag he´d apparently brought… to turn back to him with two glasses and one bottle of golden-colored liquid. Dean smiled upon noticing its probable nature… but then his face slacked as he recognized the label.
“Uh… Wow. Sorry, man”, his eyes shifted, insecure, “I just, you know, wondered if it had been different. I assumed…  But no. Everyone’s lost someone on the Plagues. Shouldn’t have asked like that… Nyeh. I’m not good with words”, he murmured, shaking his head.
He had definitely never seen Gabriel like that. He was suddenly very sorry he had worried his brother like that.
There, in… the middle of the cornfield that extended in front of him. There, in his stupid trenchcoat and blue tie.
If he were a biomancer like his brother Gabriel, if he knew more about using life magic, he could have easily touched the ground and ask the forest. But he wasn’t. The biggest feat he had ever done with life magic was changing his own eyes, and probably because changing one´s body was very close to healing magic. He couldn´t make a plant bloom even if it killed him.
A hellhound appeared to the side of the angel and he had to roll to dodge, then got to his feet as soon as he could. Dean charged at a pooch that intended to attack his friend from the back again.
The tentacles reached for Cas, who had landed close to the thing, but Sam jumped and hacked at them, making them go back. The hunter took the angel by the back of his coat and dragged him back to get him close to the fire. As he did that, the tentacles suddenly went to the hunter instead, writhing around his arms and torso.
Cas stared at him, a worried frown to his expression, until he lowered his gaze. His eyes flickered, confused for a second, then looked away.
Castiel nodded and kept going. The hunter started to dart looks back at him, and the noble started to feel embarrassed- but he could not for the life of him stop dragging his feet and hunching his shoulders forward. His arms felt as if they weighed tons.
“It doesn´t matter if I´m ready or not”, he grumbled, not looking up, “It´s about what´s right. And he shouldn´t be down there”
He got to his feet, but heard a noise at his back, and lashed out a hand as he spun before even looking. He understood in a fraction of a second that another thing had almost gotten to him.
He had gotten the angel there almost dragging him, although he had complained if he teased him. After leaving him on the bed, he had stayed there motionless with his eyes closed. But he had answered to him when he had asked if he was all right, with another “I´m just tired”. So he had guessed he was okay.
Sorry I didnt post in August. But Im still here, still grinding. And I dont care how long this will take.
But… some things started to not add up in his mind. He frowned, his eyes not focused on anything rather his reorganizing thoughts, and he blinked in confusion as Sam left him to sit in the passenger seat of the Impala after opening the door for him, legs still dangling out of the car.
“Yeah, Cas”, said Sam in a controlled, slightly pained voice, “It´s not as if these are my first broken bones. You look pretty banged-up”
They were sitting at the base of a tree, its trunk to Dean’s back. Away from the clearing covered by the sea of ferns, again in one of the areas with firs and oaks; there were spots of grass and weeds where sitting was easier and more comfortable than among the gigantic unfurl leaves. The ferns grew on patches there, to Cas’s relief- it was way easier to see if something was approaching on the ground.
Cas seemed to excuse himself from his conversation with Ellen and Mary and walked to them. But as soon as he got close, he stopped right in his tracks. His eyes were wide with awe, his lips partly parted. His expression turned marveled, shocked, humbled.
Yes, I put that here instead of at the beginning notes so it took you guys by surprise xD I did not want my squeeing to create expectations and ruin the smooth transition of the chapter from "look at the trees... the forest is beautiful... so many details..." to "RUN FOR YO LIIIIVES!!" xD
Dean frowned, determined, and scooted to look closer. His lips parted in horror as he saw in the dim streetlights the fingermarks that were starting to appear on Sammy´s neck, bruises darkening by the minute. He just then realized that his brother´s voice sounded a bit too raspy.
He shook his head. Sam was more than capable, and they had Castiel’s little bio-whatever ritual to let them know Sammy was still alive. And…
Dean´s eyes shone with uncertainty for a second; before he frowned, determined, and gave a curt nod. Before Cas could move, the hunter took a small scalpel that the doctor had left ready beside the cauldron, and made a small cut on one of his fingers. He directly put his hand over the cauldron and a drop of blood dropped in the mix. A faint-glowing red spiral of light surged from where it fell on the center, to swirl around the cauldron until it touched its edges.
“Yes, it´s easy”, he answered, mind racing, “I am… trying to think in which other way could I help you”, he murmured, “Can you give a one more minute before leaving?”
“How does it work exactly?”, Dean asked as he observed, trying to get Cas to talk excitedly about magic like other times.
“Ah…”, Cas hesitated, slightly embarrassed, “I meant I… thought you´d be mostly unconscious until I healed you. Then I´d take you back to the forest and leave you on your merry way”
“Oh, hey”, Dean caught her by the wrist with wide eyes, “I just got an idea. Why don´t you put on that green dress you have? I´m sure it will look awesome with those. Can you do that for me?”, he gave her his sweetest smile.
He turned his head to look at Dean. The hunter was looking right back, and he bobbed his head up to him with a small smile. He was sitting with his legs crossed, and he had the map extended on his lap.
This chapter was part of the previous one before, and it took a lot of work to do (and to re-do xD). In the end I splitted it up cause it was so long... And I´m so glad I did that, cause it allowed me to introduce the nightmare. I really wanted Cas to have nightmares on his first corrupted night, it made all the sense; but I felt it took the attention from the wolf attack on the previous chapter. So here you go :)
“I was, and I wrapped that up ASAP. Come on”, Dean gave her a cocky smile, “You think I´d miss a day like today?”
Castiel nodded and they started walking. They were in Hell, in a complex maze of stone hallways, dark and must, light by torches here and there.
The hunter seemed more rested, his face less flushed… but he had to check on him to be sure. However, before daring using his power in earnest again, he decided to make a little test. He stood up and looked down at himself- his dirtied, bloodied, fabric-shredded self. Then put a hand on his chest and made a small effort of will.
The immediate explosion roared in the clearing, throwing a punch of hot air and acrid smell that shook Castiel´s hair and clothes. He fell to the ground, Dean beside him, as the plant screeched in obvious pain. The mage looked back at it, seeing it partially covered in flames, the flowerheads opened wide to the sky, the vines squirming- having let go of him.
Cas snapped his eyes back up upon hearing his name, completely lost on what the conversation was about. He looked to his mother, who tilted her head looking at him.
The hunter immediately extended a hand to help him, which he took gingerly as the world slowly turned vertical again, swaying a bit on the edges.
Dean would forever, forever swear he didn’t make the sound he emitted as he felt the kick of his future nephew; but it sure made Jessica burst out laughing.
He turned in a slow circle, his alert eyes scanning the vegetation. His hand had come to rest at the hilt of his sword at some point without him noticing.
His voice did not sound forcefully cheered now, and his charming smile was gone. He stared at Cas, calculating, as if he was trying to figure him out. Castiel´s heart pounded uncomfortably, unsettled by the moment of true menace.
Dean snorted as he shook his head with incredulity. Cas smiled a bit to himself and looked away. Both men stayed looking upfront for some moments, pensive.
“Okay, then I declare this slumber party over. I´m taking Cas to a bed and then I´m gonna eat something and
“Jittery but fine too”, he observed Dean as he went to the fridge to grab them two beers, “Clinging to the tablet as if it´s gonna keep him safe from Crowley”
His blood froze. He knew that voice, that British accent. When he could focus his terrified eyes, they locked onto a mischievous smile.
So he dismissed it as he kneeled beside the man that had ended all his hopes and dreams, and roared wildly as he punched his face, his knuckles blooding.
. His skin felt still on fire, the pain was incapacitating, and he groaned in frustration. He suddenly felt a hand on his arm… And almost fell to the floor in relief. He looked down to see Cas lower his hand and close his eyes, laying his head on the floor.
There. He´d said it. He risked a look towards the angel. His back had straightened and his eyes, lost in the cornfield, were getting wide. He was pale. He looked… hopeful and scared at the same time.
“Yes”, he answered immediately, and he improvised babbling, “Just… something I needed. For the Academy. It will have to wait until tomorrow. It´s alright. It was just, preferable to have it sooner”
The flowerheads reeled back as the vines tensed, one of them breaking with a snap; and Cas screamed as he felt how the sudden tug almost cracked the bones on his legs. But it made the plant stop tugging so much for a second, which made Dean trip forward against the centipede. Suddenly not needing half of his strength to keep them in place, he planted his feet and pushed his sword forward- the Impala broke through the thing´s upper end with a satisfying crunching sound.
Cas winced as his head tensed up again, and left his eyes closed for some moments after it passed, exhausted. He felt the bed move as Dean dropped on it with a grunt and took the covers over him. For some reason he looked to his left, to find the hunter looking back at him. Castiel´s face was slashed, half-covered in wolf blood, strained in pain. Dean´s was beaded in sweat, slightly pink-flushed by the low fever he still suffered, expression sick and exhausted.
“Please, Gabriel. I´m really tired, and I want to return to my room”, he said in a serious tone, walking past him.
They both shared that comfortable silence they sometimes got into, sipping on their scotch, knowing all the feelings between them without the need of acknowledging them or saying them out loud. Bobby might not be his father… but family didn´t end in blood.
It really didn’t matter. The six demons that had been scratching the symbol a second ago turned towards them.
Dean´s eyes widened as his heart galloped. Castiel frowned at the question, as if he didn´t know what to answer. Panic surged in Dean at the possibility of the angel declining, and he practically screamed:
Without opening his eyes completely, he put a hand on Dean´s shoulder; his other one on the bluestone at the wall. This was the hard part: to actually perform the teleportation spell
“Whatever you are doing”, his brooding brother said, “just… be sure you are choosing the right path”
Dean looked at Sam as if he wanted to murder Cas. Sammy let out a sigh as he shrugged his shoulders in a gesture of impotence.
Cave was a bust. Eerie, creepy as fuck- especially being illuminated by Castiel’s little ball of white light instead of the warm, shifting oranges and shadows of a torch. But it was empty- no kids, no nothing. Cas stepped on a bundle of giant spider web that was by one of the walls, and after cutting him out Dean noticed more bundles, like sheets extended in one place or another. Guessing the place had new inhabitants, they skedaddled away to continue after Sammy’s path.
As always, this chapter was written to music: an apocalyptic music compilation to inspire the nightmare (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBUQppVsMp0) and for the rest, a relaxing medieval playlist that to me is starting to become Kingdom of Heaven´s official soundtrack (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27e0A74_4Lc).
The angel turned to look at him. He was still wearing the damned suit and blue tie, Dean had convinced him to ditch the trenchcoat for the occasion. The hunter shook his head as he saw the tan garment folded over a near chair.
Dont worry about all the types of magic, Cas will explain them in more detail to Dean at some point :) For now just know there are 9 types and each brother is specialized in one of them! And every one of them can do kinetomancy to one degree or another. Did you like them? Ive tried to put every angel ability shown in the show and categorize it in different specializations ^^ Kinetomancy is for flying/teleporting, we´ve already seen Cas´ healing abilities, Michael is specialized in smiting through light, Gabriel in mind magic/illusions and transforming himself and others (life magic), Samandriel once in the show made a bush burst into flame...
He staggered back two steps, flabbergasted. Nothing made sense. He looked around wildly, trying to find something for his mind to latch on to.
Castiel used that moment to close his eyes for a second and take a deep breath. He was still his patient, getting offended would not help anyone. The unjust accusations hit him in some tender spots- after all, he was more aware than most about how many sacrifices nobility entailed. However, peasants may not be aware of that. Even if they were, he tried to understand that Dean was hurt, in an unknown place, that he was not feeling safe there; and that he probably hated being assumed poor and delinquent as much as Cas hated being considered whimsical and exploiter of the working class.
“Dean! You didn´t have to! I´m sure you were so busy with the hunt”, she said humbled as she took it, “When did you even…?”
It tried to attack him from the other side, but Dean sprinted around the one on his left. He ran right in front of its face for it. He interposed his steel to stop mandibles that shot towards him, but he grunted in pain as he kept running and his steps faltered just a bit, his left hand clutching his waist. One of the frontal legs must have cut his side, though Cas couldn’t see any blood from there.
Second: Ellen and Jo had been too close to the explosion. They had both died instantly, hugging each other.
“Yeah. She´s round the back, she wanted to get something from the garden, a rose or something like that for you”
I mention again - this was written during SUMMER OF 2020. Do you have *any idea* how long Ive waited to share it with the world?? ... Well, yeah, you know exactly that, but DO YOU KNOW how EAGER I've been about sharing it? :D Ah, I'm so fucking happy- and so eager to know what you think about. Spare some words about the construction of the kingdom's history? :D We will learn more about how the Kingdom works right now in future chapters.
Castiel wasn´t exactly comfortable as he walked around the bed in his linen pajamas, self-consciously looking down, but he was also aware that this would probably be good for him. He was a doctor, and he would be expected to attend uncovered bodies in the future. The previous nights had proven to him that the chastity of nobility and his natural shyness were liabilities to his craft… so he would definitely benefit from becoming a bit more flexible about it. He was aware that spending time with someone so different could teach him a lot of things, and he was determined to seize as much knowledge as possible from his short time with the peasant- this topic included. He was glad the hunter was already dressed, though.
Dean´s eyebrows rose in understanding. It had been so damned long since any of them had mentioned Sam´s long-lost girlfriend. He cursed his damned stupid mouth for ever opening.
“I´m… sorry”, the mage mumbled, pressing the back of his neck with a hand, “I… That took me by surprise”
Cas opened his mouth to provide that it didn’t, it was that his nostrils were saturated with the smell and provided him a false sense of taste… but he was too winded to give long speeches. He closed his mouth again. He had made his own nostrils become able to smell again as soon as they had walked away from the corpses, and the initial intensity of the change had been so strong, the ointment so pungent, that he had to agree with Dean for a moment. Now, not only his sense had accommodated to his normal levels, but his lungs and throat were simply
“The usual. I studied, researched… I went to the Academy yesterday. Did some combat training, and they gave me some ingredients I needed”
“No reason to”, Dean cut him in a relaxed, calm tone as he passed another page of the book and perused its content, “You obviously needed that, man. No harm done”
“Don’t do that again”, the hunter said firmly, “This time it worked, we were lucky- and I obviously had underestimated how much you could do. But from here on, you gotta listen to me, man. When things get real bad, when shit hits the fan- I gotta know I can focus on fighting for my life without worrying about protecting you. So you run or teleport the fuck out, cause if not, you’re gonna get me dead. Clear?”
- In this fic, although they won't be discussed in extension, genetics are very important in the background story. So it pains me, but for things to work, Uriel has to be white, since both his parents are white. I thought of fixing this by making him adopted, but that really broke too many things; it made no sense and didn´t explain why he has as much power as he does. His face for me is still Robert Wisdom´s (Uriel´s actor in the show), and if I´m honest, I picture him black sometimes as I write. So he´s canonically white for everything to make sense, but you guys are free to visualize him as black as I visualize him xD I promise more people of color will appear later on- not many since SPN really does not have a lot of cast like that, but I promise important powerful people are black. Remember Billie? She´s somewhere :)
“My Baby is strong. She´ll be fine. I really doubt someone could be roaming freely through that forest stealing stuff from the ground. It´s made of steel, iron and silver… so anything that tried to chew on it probably got its mouth burned. And there´s no hunter´s sword in the world that doesn’t resist a bit of bad weather”
He looked around the room. Stupid little monkeys. They had known he would appear there as soon as he realized they had their dirty paws on the price. They had thought this heist through very well. But they were just buying time. As soon as he was freed from the trap, he would be on their heels.
Castiel whirled his head in that direction- and saw the fern leaves disturbed… making a beeline of shaking plants towards them.
“Well done, you get a cookie”, Dean smiled a little bit, and pointed at what he actually had meant the mage to see, “Notice how they are more separated and deeper as they get in, but closer and not as deep on their way out?”
for a second. A cold fear started to spread through all of his body, and he didn´t know where it came from; maybe from an old memory, or an invasive thought, or just… just the memory of a nightmare of something that never ever came to be real…
“We won’t have to hunt for our subsistence in the Army, the Crown provides prepared rations”, Castiel countered.
The hunter nodded sharply with his lips pressed and swiftly stowed the waterskin into his bag before getting to his feet.
Sam yanked him through his clothing. He was more than happy to oblige him, running towards the door, while Dean charged against the King of Hell.
But this time… it was different. There was something in the way Castiel, just for a moment, melted into his embrace, held him close. In the way his hands pushed deeply and softly into his back. It wasn’t like any hug-tap-tap they had ever shared, and what Dean had honestly gone for as he threw his arms around him. He froze as he felt the change. Maybe… Cas was just, not holding back anymore.
“It would”, Cas nodded, “But not only that”, the angel continued, “The tablets are the last direct instructions from God that are left. Maybe he left a message in them. We never read them all the way through, after all”
Crowley had him reading the tablet diagonally, interested first in what different topics were mentioned.
Food. His stomach clapped giddily at that idea. Far away, across the fog of dizziness, he felt hungry.
The bearded giant on the bed stopped his motions and whirled his head towards the wardrobe. Dean could not help but inhale sharply, cursing in his head.
The mage tried not to worry. He´d been told something like this could happen, right? He was glad Dean hadn´t seen it, though. He did not want him to worry any further, especially if he wasn´t sure there was anything actually wrong. He´d ask Gabriel as soon as he had the chance.
“I have to go back to that forest”, he said stubbornly, as if that invalidated everything Cas had said.
Cas made a claw of his left hand, gathering energy, and threw it forward when one of the trails got uncomfortably near. The pulse of force that surged from him shook the ferns, leaves swept up as if by a sudden gale, revealing the floor behind them- and a sliding creature that was starting to curve up. The spell caught onto it with full force and toppled it backwards, showing a myriad of a thousand skittling little legs.
Lucifer still looked out into the night for some moments, nodding, with Castiel´s worried eyes on him every second.
“Dean…”, he murmured looking down in repentance, “I am really, really sorry about your sword. And the rest of your belongings. Truly. I just… wanted to heal you, and didn´t think of or see anything else. I guess… I don´t pay a lot of attention to material things. I do have anything I want whenever I ask for it. I should have realized sooner that I brought you here with nothing but the clothes you wore. I am sorry”
The mage looked at Dean with a gasp. The hunter was smiling from ear to ear, a sharp contrast to his previous humor.
At least, until they get out of the room and start hunting. Then we will go back to The Witcher soundtrack :)
“It´s perfect. I think I´ll leave this here and have it after dinner”, he said, as an excuse in case the servant saw him run downstairs right away, with obviously no time to have eaten it all.
He started crawling towards it, more than willing to put himself between the creature and the bullets.
“You are welcome”, he said, so petulantly that Dean knew how smug he felt for doing for him that he had liked. The bastard.
Castiel shook his head in disapproval as his brother untied the sash and twirled it around his neck, using it as a scarf and hiding the revealing shirt and tunic.
Remembering the Second Trial, he looked around in his pockets and found his sunglasses, that he put immediately on top of the flames- which were obviously Holy Fire, why else would they be surrounding Cas? He took them out and put them on, hissing in discomfort as they were still too hot. Luckily the flames were bright enough so that he could see a damn thing even with the shades on.
“The sooner, the better”, Castiel provided quickly, steeling his expression, “I need all the extra practice and training I can get, that´s all”
The mage blinked, fuzzy memories returning to him. He did remember a soft voice, a slight shake on his shoulder.
His angel blade slashed left, right, spewing trails of blood that shone with the light of the reddish flames, two bodies went down. Other two demons attacked him and he dodged one, kicked the other, and then he sunk his blade into mid-air: a whining, doggie sound rose against the roar of fire.
“Hey, I know you´ve got issues, okay?”, he said seriously, crisply even, “But not every supernatural creature sucks. He´s good people, and he´s saved my ass- and Sammy´s- more times than I can count”
“No, no”, he murmured, “It´s just… the glow of your aura. The miracle of life. It´s… a bit overwhelming. You… are doing God´s work, in a sense. I feel very honored to be in your presence right now”
The pleasant buzz of alcohol through his body lulled him deeper and deeper, he smiled at it gratefully. The noise and the light from the TV were gone. It was just dark, blissfully dark. Dark, and quiet…
“Er, no, I do understand the basics”, he explained, “The base is Dead Lake water, commonly used in divination techniques. Extends the range of the ritual to the whole of this plane. The ingredients are meant to add meanings of searching, locating; and the rest is… biomantic ingredients that…
. He was in one of the Doomed Forests of the Kingdom, the ones roamed by monsters. Where no one but crazy hunters would enter. He was defying the Academy´s rules, his family´s desires- to become better, faster. To get into Heaven´s Army… as soon as possible.
Cas couldn’t help but smile back. He was five years younger than him, but even though he was already twenty-two, the youngest of the house would always inspire a protective feeling in him. He wore an embroidered red tunic with a white sash, along with white linen pants, comfortable and simple. He had been perching on the wall, nose inside one of his many journals, until he had raised his eyes towards him.
“I, I, yes, of course- of course I´d like it”, babbled Cas, frowning in a strange attempt of looking serious and respectable through his nerves.
“I know that this is uncommon, and that it must be difficult for you to trust a stranger, if your life has been as complicated as you tell me it has. But I swear to you- I mean you no harm, nor bear nefarious intentions towards you. I will teleport you out when you are healed, and I
So yeah, Cas might be shy… but Dean had seen him gape and blush when he’d accidentally seen him naked. So maybe it wasn’t all shyness. Maybe Dean had been dangling in front of the poor man what he couldn’t ever have.
“Okay. Plants are denser here, so watch your step. In every sense. For one, raise your knees higher than you usually do, step with determination so you don’t slip on the leaves. Also, remember there can be things in the bushes, in the trees, or beneath the ferns or fallen leaves. Don’t forget to stay alert and watch your surroundings. I´ll take the lead, you follow”
Castiel pressed his lips. He was sure that Dean would not believe him if he told him that yes, sometimes bodies were used but
Fuck. How had his happened? Maybe… He was used to hunting with Sammy. To him watching his back. Sammy would have felt the danger, as he had. Sammy would have seen the leaves move as something slowly approached them, as he would.
Then he turned away and stretched, making his neck crack. He sighed, tired. He had had a trying day at the High Academy of Magic, with combat practice as well as precision training. Then the flight back home, and the teleporting. The repetitive movements and the warm, crackling fire had made him drowsy... but it was clear he wouldn´t be going to bed anytime soon. He intended to check on the hunter ́s state at least every hour, every two if everything looked good after a while. So he allowed himself a single yawn before directing his steps to his desk.
“Dude”, he gasped a moment later, straightening his back a bit to look behind him at Castiel, “Are you okay?”
out of his league. That he had had problems mid-way, that he had feared for his life, and that he had used almost all of his magical talent to go back from a horrid half-transformation state, getting Corrupted enough in the process to have lasting symptoms. And that for such idiocy, he had not gone to his brother- that happened to be an expert in life magic. As if he had almost had a
Cas got down to one knee, breathing hitching in pain, a strained expression on his face. Being surrounded by this much Holy Fire could not be good for him. He turned around to put both arms around Jessica and Sam, wincing in agony as he moved his burned one, and he tried to cover them as much as he could with his trenchcoat, with his whole body.
He frowned. Maybe he was still upset. But Dean had said his piece, made amends- that should do it, right? Maybe he needed some time? He frowned as Cas stood still again once more and sighed. Dean pressed his lips and tried to analyze it as if he was trying to guess the intentions of an enemy, to find weaknesses. Cas… didn’t seem ashamed anymore, he realized. He seemed... Sad. Worried. Maybe he was thinking about the marriage thing?
“Alright, then I´m gonna nap. Don´t fucking crash us into anything”, he grunted irritably as he leaned against the seat and closed his eyes again.
Dean tensed, suddenly very uncomfortable. He always forgot that the face he knew, he trusted with his life- was of a James Novak that died some time ago. Not really Cas.
Castiel looked up right after getting a spoonful in his mouth. He took a second to munch and gulp before asking:
“Yeah, they are the missing folks. Plus some”, Dean answered in kind, “Get antidoting, Sam. We´re getting them outta here. I´ll cover you”
The hunter got into the room and dragged a chair from a little desk so that it was close to the bed and facing it, and plopped into it with wide-spread knees.
The healer left with hurried steps, pondering his brother´s words. What on Heaven could he have meant? Did he know about Dean, and about Castiel´s plans to go against Academy wishes of getting out on the field before graduating? But if he did, how had he found out? He didn’t think Gabriel would have told him… No, that made no sense. This was probably related to Michael and Lucifer and their trial or something. He huffed, pissed. Good thing he was out of all of that. Hunting with Dean would be more than enough to…
Castiel couldn’t help to let out a sigh, and even he was surprised to hear how dismayed it sounded. Another detour meant more time to get to the nest, more time walking.
“Well. I would suggest taking into consideration why your father doesn't like this individual. Maybe he sees something that you don't." She pauses, expectant, but Castiel remains silent. He's not going to explain himself to her, his father, or anyone. "But... I suppose that's for you to use your best judgment. I know you’re on your way to substantial changes soon, and I hope that they make for an easy transition.”
He’d never given much thought to the validity of “feeling like the only two people in the world” because he’d never experienced it. Every bit of literature that had described it, every romantic movie that had tried to show it, it didn’t come close. His attraction to Dean has a hand around his throat and his stomach swirling with unfiltered desire.
“David. His name is David. He found me when I was emptying my stomach in my classmate's bathroom during the party we’d gone to and assisted me before taking me home. I didn’t think we’d speak beyond that, but….” There was so much to say about the friendship they’d built so quickly and so fiercely, but it felt almost private, in a way. “We share a profound bond now, he and I.”
"I'm fine, thank you, Kelly," he says as he scrawls his name on the sign-in sheet. "You look lovely today, as always. How is baby Jack doing?"
There's a lot of cursing and complaining that goes into maneuvering a comparably much taller, deathly uncoordinated drunken individual through the house to Meg's room. Still, she manages, even with him stumbling the whole way there.
Sleep is still pulling at his mind, begging him to rest again, but he processes that Meg says thank you. Dean replies that it was more entertainment than he's had in a while, then something about putting his phone number in Cas's phone if she needs anything.
There's a fine line between wherever the present Here is and blacking out. Castiel is balancing it recklessly.
"I know, I'm fucking amazing," Meg says as she beings digging in the backseat of her car, tossing random items in every direction. "If you thought you'd get away with not dressing up too, you're wrong." She emerges with a plastic bag full of clothing and shoves it towards him. "Put this on, I'm ready to eat fair food."
“Look at her,” Dean lets out a low whistle, running a hand along the hood. “You fixed her up all by yourself, huh?”
The Old Park, as everyone aptly refers to it as, is nothing but a dilapidated public pool, a concrete slab that used to house skate ramps, and a brick building where the grimy cracked showers and toilets are. There used to be a swing set and a slide, but they’d been long since torn down. Graffiti litters every wall and crevice, locks hang on the chain-link fence as a remembrance of lover’s past, lawn chairs of every color dot the pool’s floor. Over time, kids have figured out ways to rig an assortment of string lights and lanterns, shadeless lamps, you name it, as a way to brighten the area at night. The town’s small police force has tried its best to keep kids out but to no avail. It’s been the go to spot for as long as anyone can remember.
“Here,” he heads to his closet, immaculately kept in comparison to the clutter on his wall, and shuffles through his shirts before tossing over a too big AC/DC hand-me-down tee that he never wore. He opens the top drawer of his dresser, pulling out a pair of gray joggers. “Half of my pants are in the wash, but I have these. I don’t know what size you wear, but if you need normal shoes…” he nods to the Docs Meg had him wear the night they’d gone to The Old Park and hands Dean the clothes. “I’ll be back in a few minutes if you want to change here.”
While they loved their friends, they'd always been closer with each other than with everyone else. One day at recess in fifth grade, Meg told Castiel he was her unicorn and he was stuck with her forever. He agreed on the condition that she let him have one of the bee stickers she had been putting all over her folders. The rest, as they say, is history.
"That's the best part. I love seeing you be naughty. Plus, fuck what your dad says. He’s always been overprotective. It's not like he's ever even explained why he hates Dean's dad so much - and so what? It's not like they're the same person." She slides the phone back into his hand. "Call me the devil on your shoulder, but I say play with fire. I know you want to."
"You're allowed to have emotions, Dean." Cas isn't so sure anyone has reassured him of this in a long while.
“We’ll see you next time," Anna says, holding the door open for him. "Tell Meg and your new friend Dean I say hello.”
"Cas" is usually a nickname reserved for family or friends, not mere acquaintances, but coming from Dean's mouth, it sounds like they've known each other forever instead of a few disastrous minutes.
"Bad enough. Usually, I'm with Meg after she coerces me to attend parties. He assumes she's my girlfriend, also. I don't bother correcting him. It makes it easier."
With that, he pushes through the curtains, wanting to get as far away as quickly as possible. Being in this tent suddenly feels suffocating. There’s a familiar tightness rising in his chest, the rush of fight or flight overtaking him. It doesn’t make sense why this was happening now. It doesn’t make sense, but that doesn’t matter. He has to leave.
"What did she say?" Castiel mumbles, trying to shove off of the floor. His body feels like what can only currently be described as the equivalent of soaking wet cardboard. He rests against the wall and rubs his hands over his face in defeat.
"Shove your subtle toxic masculinity up your ass, Dean. I told you you’d look good. You’re welcome." Meg winks at him salaciously, then averts her gaze to Castiel. "You, too. Now, who wants a slushie? I’m thirsty, and it's not just for you two."
to get to him - but The Whispers keep telling me to stay away. Every time I get close, I wake up. Every night."
When alone, there’s no outside interruption to break the constant loop of fear and feeling like he’s dying. Alone, it’s just Castiel and his mind, battling it out to see how long it takes to convince himself that his surroundings are real and he’s not in danger. It’s a hell all its own inside of him, one you could never guess was there from the outside looking in.
The most enchanting part of it all is the woman who runs it, though. She’s dressed in a skintight black tank top and long, layered wine-red skirt, her languid gait that of someone aware of her powerful presence. Her feet are bare against the ornate rugs that cover the ground, but her ankles are encircled with delicate silver chains decorated with amethyst beads. The same stone rests at the base of her throat.
The duo spends most of their day sleeping off their hangovers, shoveling junk food, and watching Netflix. They're halfway through the third season of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, surrounded by blankets and snack bags with his head in her lap, when he goes to check his phone for the thousandth time that day. She snatches it out of his hand.
Meg's hands are on his shoulders, slipping down to his waist where she slides her fingers into the belt loops of the dark jeans she'd talked him into wearing. He cradles the back of her neck with one hand, their foreheads touching while they move like two parts of one well-oiled machine. Sweat is dripping down his collarbone, laughter is mixing with every risqué sway of her hips. Meg tosses her hair back and kisses Castiel's cheek before saying something about how having fun looks good on him.
"I thought you said they make me look like a 'huge fucking poser'?" He adds air quotes for emphasis.
“I hope my friend’s futures are more easily decipherable,” Cas says, pushing his chair back. “What do I owe you?”
He can't think of the last time he felt so open and free, right down to his core. A moment of simple happiness like this is what people spend their days praying for, searching for, and once they find it, they never stop trying to replicate it.
“I´m… practicing some life magic”, he provided, uncomfortable, “Don´t worry, you will not have to clean that, I´ll take care of it”
“Oh!, yes, yes…”, he looked around wildly until he found his folded trenchcoat and walked to it to rummage on its wide pockets, “I… I was told it was customary to deliver gifts at birthday celebrations”
Dean´s heart was pounding fast. He was so fucking nervous, frozen two steps away at his father´s back. He wanted to disappear, to be a state away-
“If you don’t rest, your fever could get worse”, the healer said without heat, “And your wounds could reopen so easily…”
“He seems like a very skilled warrior, indeed”, Castiel said as his eyes roamed around the clearing, “He must take after his brother”
“It´s okay”, he said as he wiped it with his sleeve, a bit of blood that still was trickling being cleaned away, “You weren´t in control of yourself”
Cas knew that when he focused his power a lot, his eyes shone with a blue light… and it could be weird to watch. Dismissing the change, he sent his intentions through his veins.
good. He saved me both times. The doctors said that I was practically undone when he got to me, but twice he put me back together”, Cas smiled to his memory, “He saved me, he brought me back”
of seeing Cas happy coursing up and down all over him. A joy that had eased all his pains, and made him feel that the excruciating days of nerves and plans had been all worth it... so worth it.
“Awful”, he sighed, and looked down at his hands, “The shadows got inside me and I felt they were going to make me explode… But Pestilence was worse”
“Magic can heal anything. Almost anything”, he corrected himself, “If the healer is good enough”, he added with a small smile.
“As if it weren´t the thing that´s actually gonna make him go after him”, grunted Dean taking the beers to the table, Sam following.
PS- Haha, I just realized with all this talk about the Corruption that... Dean should have been a little bit Corrupted the first time Cas found him. So I went back to edit chapter two. Just know that when Cas is cleaning him, there are black veins over his heart, that fade away in the next days, and there are no more veins when Cas finally uses magic on him again!
“That hast to be terrifying”, the noble commented worried, “Waiting like that. And in the darkness of a cave”
“I… We could find woodland fiends again, fight against them”, Cas said as he rummaged inside his bag for his silver pliers, “Or if Sam has been hunting in this area, he might have been bitten by one of these things. It´s good if we already have some teeth to make an antidote from”
A blade appeared out of nowhere, from behind a blur flew over him, and a clang resonated in the forest.
“T’s okay, man”, Dean said as he shook the map to straighten it before he started folding it, “You did a hell of a show- you can have a damned break. But you gotta get yourself that tattoo we talked about”, he added in a slightly sterner tone.
“Precisely", said Cas, forcing himself to look up, to try to smile, to bury memories, "That´s one of the reasons the door is locked. So no one comes in”
“He’s always been a very smart kid”, Dean said, eyes lost on the middle distance, a proud smile on his face, “Fixed it all on his own. He couldn’t tell me or my dad when it happened- we were out, on a supply run. So he shut himself up in Bobby’s library, started researching like crazy. Bobby was out, but he knew where the key was- and also all of his ritual ingredients. He got his big head between books and before the shadows overtook him, he had already figured out how to heal it and done it. We only learned what happened when we came back and found him exhausted, a jar of Holy Oil by his side. Along with
His towel passed over the curve of his deltoids, which drew a defined shoulder, down to his biceps. With careful movements, he slid a hand behind his elbow to push slightly upwards and slipped the cloth below the laying man ́s left arm. He cleaned the towel again before getting to his forearm, where he knew a bite mark still remained. He had noticed it the first time he had touched the hunter ́s temple, but his abdominal wounds had been more urgent.
“But… I didn´t want you to stay rotting in Emptyland. This… is as far as I got”, he lowered his eyes sadly, “You deserve better. Better than me. You deserve everything, and… I can´t give you that”
“Don´t worry, man… mmf”, he grunted a bit as the needle pierced his skin, “After fighting demons and angels, we eat djinns for breakfast. We got this”
“Well, you were right about something. We nobles had it much easier sometimes. When the End came… we just had to stay in our homes. Our castles could not be run down by monsters. Then, we had it way easier than common folk”
“A´ight”, said Dean, “Then I don’t know when, but get one, okay? I´ll make you the drawing and you go wherever you nobles can go to get a tattoo”
However, the missing persons count had raised dramatically from one day to the next, so getting to Oklahoma had rapidly climbed up on their list of priorities. First it had been four, in the article Sam had come across to. A fifth person had been fortunately found, but the local police had declared her erratic and out of her mind. The next morning, there were already eighteen people missing; in a town that was not big enough for it to not cause a bit of a panic. Something was moving, fast, taking a huge amount of victims on its way… and the hunters wanted to get there before more official attention arrived.
Dean looked up to frown at him, obviously not liking the answer. The anger had brought a stronger glint into his eyes, as if he was suddenly more awake. He glanced aside in frustration, and for a moment his eyes passed over the lab table… and a slight frown changed his ensemble. Interest peaked in his green orbs, anger forgotten.
Castiel blinked once. Twice. That was… the greatest excuse he could have come up with. By no means should he blow this up with his awful lying abilities. He licked his lips and looked away, trying to look offended.
Angels fell, Cas was human for some time, but recovered his Grace. Angels hated and hunted Cas for some time while Team Free Will looked for Metatron and a way to restore heaven. Third change is, no Abaddon, so no Mark of Cain- so Charlie is still alive, and has not met Cas yet. Rowena hasn’t ever appeared. Fourth change, they succeed in defeating Metratron without him killing Dean. Cas breaks the Angel Tablet in time for Dean to kill him with an angel blade. Metratron is dead cause I hate the bastard xD. Angel Tablet was destroyed into pieces by Cas in Heaven, and no one knows what happened to the Demon Tablet, since Metratron had it but he´s dead so he can´t tell.
The mage frowned pensively, tilted his head as he squinted, while Dean engulfed the last of his sandwich.
“Okay, let´s all just… relax for a second”, said Dean with a dismissive wave of his hand, “Yeah, that thing´s there and we will kill it someday soon. But for once, we don´t have a huge doomsday on our hands. Crowley had a plan and we fucked it up. The angels are cozy on Heaven. Maybe we can just all, you know, take a break. It´s been a while since we dedicated some time to old-fashioned hunting. And monsters haven´t waited patiently until we finished our hellish/heavenly disputes. We got some work piled up”
The crushing of leaves got closer, and closer, thundering clacking legs at his back; and when he looked over his shoulder he immediately jumped to one side with a yelp.
“It is”, he answered as he nodded, “The flavor combination is very nice, and also the mix of textures. The bread is crunchy, but the ingredients inside are juicy”
“Y… You wouldn’t snap out of it, nothing I did worked”, Sam was answering fast, nervously, “I-I screamed at you, I slapped you; nothing…”
When Dean looked back at him, Cas just gave him a small, kind smile. Dean had been right, they were very small wounds, that had barely taken energy out of him to fix.
His mother run to throw his arms around his neck, and his gigantic sibling took her and even lifted her up a bit from the floor as he hugged her back.
“Yeah but… you´re studying already, right? You mentioned an Academy? That you trained there for years”
Honey met blue, and Gabriel grimaced a bit in frustration. His eyes lowered for a second, and when he raised them again, all of the copies he had created with mind magic disappeared.
“Come on, man. If us hugging after we thought the other was dead was a bad thing, we should have gone to jail long ago”
The hunter looked back at him with a compassionate smile. He had been pointing the marks of the trail to follow to the mage so he could start learning, but he knew well how difficult it was to get the skill.
Castiel looked at the fiery walls. Holy Fire worked specifically against angels. It was just normal fire to other creatures… not as lethal or dampening. They could theoretically jump it without more than some minor burns.
Okay, he realized, maybe he shouldn´t have left him alone like that. Castiel already knew everyone there from separate events, but this was the first Winchester party he ever attended. Yes, he had once said hi to his mum from the Impala as they left, and he got along with Charlie marvelously; but he was not the most social being, and navigating a human gathering could not be easy for the angel.
Dean stopped right on his tracks, only two steps away. His father´s voice was… Awkward? Insecure? Non-belligerent?
“Yeah, yeah, I know, man”, Dean answered with a dismissive shake of his hand, “But can you like, I don’t know. Bring some booze or something with dinner?”
they were suddenly out of the thing, close to Sam and Kevin. Dean landed right on his ass at the angel´s feet, dizzy as the blood rushed back into his head.
He shook his head at the thought and splashed water over his face. He’d never think of Cas like that. First, there was nothing sexual or anything going on between them. And the mage only wanted to help. Be a good host, by his words. And damn, he had helped. They found the trail.
When the bottle came down, Dean would swear it had not emptied itself at all. Cas had probably just let it touch his lips. He smiled fondly as he shook his head.
And before Cas could argue, she took him by the hand and dragged him along in Ellen´s direction. The angel shot a panicked look towards Dean, but he just smiled and waved him goodbye by taking two fingers to his temple as a salute, letting him know he was alone at that.
“‘Course it works…”, scoffed Dean as he shook his head; but then he suddenly frowned, “Dude. Have you
Dean made half a smile and sat at the base of a tree. Cas followed him dragging his feet and plopped down.
Cas murmured a grumbled answer, and soon all of them were retreating to the comfort and safety of the bedroom area.
Something quivered in his gut when he took the silver razor Cas had given him. It wasn’t even silver-handled… it was silver
“Oh”, Cas´ eyes brightened as he had the answer to that question, “This one comes from the northern slope of Tolbachik volcano in east Russia”
Silence. He could picture Castiel scowling at him in the distance. Sam walked to him and asked for the phone with a gesture. Dean huffed out in exasperation as he gave it to him and went to the door, to watch that no one got close.
“I doubt whatever´s there is kind enough for us to search around. Do you forget the wolves that tried to eat your ass? How long did they take them to get to you?”
“You can’t trust that in a Doomed Forest. Everything in here grows like crazy. Even in normal forests, if the humidity is enough, they will end up surrounding the whole trunk”
. He supposed the angel had a point. At the end of the day, his dad was a ruthless hunter, and his fame preceded him.
He stopped, spreading the wings vertically to the ground, hatching on the winds to come to an abrupt halt; before starting to flap them to keep him in more or less the same spot… and listened.
Maybe, though he hoped not, a pack of smaller things that had the ability to change their skin to match their surroundings. That surrounded their prey right before diving in and devouring them in a violent frenzy. The piranhas of the land.
“Nah, they´re sleeping. I guess that´s one way we can do this”, he shot a look towards his brother, “Take them one by one, stealthy style, send them to dreamland. Until we can go face queen bee”
The mystery of it dragged his mind away from his stray thoughts and shaken emotions. He listed the Croatoan disease symptoms- something no one ever had understood- with a flutter of eagerness in his gut, fascination leaving pain behind. He dove into it, grateful and greedy.
He looked to his right as he felt Castiel´s hand on his shoulder. The angel was looking at him in firm worry.
“Sorry, Cas. I know you´re my doctor and all- but you also said you wouldn´t hold me here against my will”
“Do you… wanna talk about it?”, he offered a bit clumsily, “Losing a brother, I… I honestly don’t know what I’d do. If I lost Sammy”, Dean said in a murmur, eyes pained.
“Or we can find another way”, said Sam, putting a hand on Kevin´s shoulder, “As if we didn’t have enough books in the bunker to look up first”
Castiel left his eyes on her for a moment before lowering them to his plate. His mother… he loved her. And he respected her, of course he did. He… thought he understood her, to a degree. She only wanted what she thought was best for her family. She was protective, and tried to lead her children- that she had practically raised on her own- with an iron fist in pursuit of driving them towards excellence. He knew that if she was pleased, she would be her strongest, fiercest ally.
Dean was gonna say something else, but for a second he thought he heard Sam calling him. He twisted his neck around to look back towards the house… but had he really heard anything?
He saw the angel close his eyes, panting, maybe trying to think. He had probably just been surviving until that point. Maybe the idiot had even thought that the more monsters he killed, and the longer he entertained them; the less he and his brother would face. A death well spent. Stupid little soldier.
“So you haven´t given it to her yet”, Dean guessed, finally looking away first- like pretty much always.
The mage opened his mouth, speechless for a second… realizing what his brother thought. That he had tried something that was
Michael didn´t acknowledge him, talking kindly with Samandriel; and Lucifer made a dismissive sound and walked to Uriel´s side to also stare out the window.
. An experience I’m not eager to repeat”, he declared with a shudder, “But it was the price for keeping me alive. It must have been tough on my father too. He performed spell after spell, night after night, without resting or stopping- or getting Corrupted himself, that good was his control over magic. I will always be grateful to him”
So wrong. So, so wrong. Someone walked close behind him, and he jumped to look back. The guy had looked at him as if he was crazy, or insulting him. He had awkwardly apologized, reminded himself that not everyone was trying to kill him, that any demon that got close would be spotted by Cas. And looked back to the water.
“And I´m betting my ass that there´s gotta be a way to find the other tablet with it. I mean, they´re kind like… sisters, right? A spell or something that ties them together”
“Okay. Alright”, he clapped his hands once to get into focus, “Then, let’s get some breakfast, and we’ll get going”
He turned his eyes to his left. His father was approaching him with a paper plate that contained a juicy homemade burger.
“Would… you like to see the ranger´s message? It´s got some nest locations. It will be very helpful to find Sam”
“I-I don´t… think so…”, the young man babbled looking at the thing, “There are rituals, spells; but I´d need ingredients…”
“This, young man, is my new favorite toy. I have broken angels with it, you know” he talked with a distracted tone, while he swirled the spike in two of his fingers, looking at it, “It allows me not only to take a spike into the part of your brain that processes pain, causing a torture much more intense that what could be gained through any other means. Skipping the middle man, so to speak. No, it can disassemble your mind. Your identity”
Dean didn’t stop his smile from conquering the rest of his face as he took the glass and sipped from it. He immediately moaned with his eyes closed.
