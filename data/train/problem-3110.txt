Dean is briefly stricken by the cock of its small, horned head and the half-closed slant of its eyes. The striking shade of its scales that remind him of eyes that are just as blue, just as piercing-
It doesn't seem right. Stepping into this room and there being no one in it. It feels like a strange, foreign place.
Dean scowls at him in return, wondering where the hell Sam is. He's supposed to be the responsible one here, not him.
Cas always making and buttering the toast while Dean scrambled eggs; always setting up the coffee machine while Dean retrieved their mugs.
"Unicorns are an old and powerful magic." The unicorn shifts away before pressing its nose into Cas' hand instead. "They are not easily killed."
Huffing, Dean drops his hands but he doesn't move to close the door. Instead, he watches as Cas reaches his hand out, slow and steady.
"The horn would indicate it's a unicorn," Cas is squinting at the windshield when Dean slowly turns his gaze towards the passenger seat. There's a curious lilt to his voice when he adds, head tilting to the left, "I had not realized they still existed."
Dean's frowning when he turned back towards the cupboards.
Cas' sigh certainly embodies that of a mother being presented a wild, flea-ridden animal and begged to keep it. "In the pasts, dragons were known as being... guardians of other mystical animals. Due to the nature of their protectiveness and tendency to establish hoards, those who might have sought to hunt them would often steer clear of their territories, and the creatures themselves were drawn to them."
Another odd look, and Sam's hand rises to absently rub Mushu's head. The dragon makes a chittering sound and tilts his head into it, eyes closed. "Not since last night. I think he was heading behind the house."
Dean's gaze scans under the table and towards the door to the laundry room, from where he's stalled in the threshold. As if there's a chance that he somehow overlooked a grown, six foot angel in his grog.
Cas' head turns towards him, a crease forming between his brows. "There was a time when you said the same of angels."
"To get some pie not contaminated with dragon drool."
The resulting silence is just a touch too long. "You could say we are of... similar virtues."
And Gabriel said he has a handle on it.
"What- You mean the unicorn? In
"There's dragon spit in my pie," Dean says, angst, because its muzzle is burrowed into the corner of the dessert. When it lifts its chin to peer over at them, its still slurping up a large chunk of apple. As soon as its disappeared, so does its attention from them.
As it turned out, a unicorn in the garage was only one of his problems.
Or fangs.
- before he lets his angel get run down by some over-aggressive horse with a stick on its head.
The head poking out from under Gabriel's elbow, a deep, shimmering blue adorned with stubby bumps on its head and he couldn't be serious-
There's gaping cracks left behind where they met the concrete.
After dinner they cleaned up the kitchen and moved to the living room to sit on the couch with a refreshing beer. Sam tried to teach him a bit German, but all Dean could manage was “Hello” and “Thanks”, despite Sam’s best efforts. “Dude, you really need to know a bit when you want to move around here.”,Sam said frustrated and Dean rolled his eyes. “Why do I need to learn it when you’re around anyway?”, he replied to which Sam didn’t find a logical answer. Dean marked this as one of the rare triumphs in his mental book and grinned. Sam scoffed and took another sip from his beer. Then he suddenly straightened himself and cleared his throat, looking at Dean. “You know, I forgot to ask you something.”, he began and Dean turned his head to look at this lanky brother in interest. “Well, I told you about some of my friends. You remember Gabriel? His parents have a second house at the Baltic Sea and he invited us all to spend a week there. You wanna come? They wont mind.”, Sam asked and his eyes went all big. Dean smiled at the typical puppy look only his brother excelled at. “Sure, man. I mean, a week? At the sea? Why do you even ask? Besides, I’m curious to meet your friends. I mean, that Jess girl you told me about? You sure there isn’t anything going on?”, he replied in a teasing tone, laughing as a blush crept over Sam’s cheeks. The younger cleared his throat before nodding. “Okay, then I’ll tell Gabriel. Actually, we wanted to depart soon - maybe day after tomorrow? We’re all on summer break anyway so we’re flexible.” - “Sure, man. You can show me around here then first!” Dean felt excitement about the plans now. First he’d discover an European capital with his favourite person in the world and then he’d get to see the sea for the first time close. He’d even meet Sammy’s friends! To be honest, he was quite curious about them, wanting to know if they are good enough for Sammy (which, to be fair, is quite an unreachable standard). They continued talking until late in the night. At some point around 3 am Sam kept yawning constantly and rubbing his eyes so Dean shooed him off to bed.
Now freshly cleaned he went back to the kitchen and his stomach growled even more at the smell. Sam was standing at the stove and was currently frying something. As he heard his brother’s steps he turned around and grinned. “Hey. I thought you might be hungry so I figured to cook you some burgers. You know. To not scare you away.”, he said mockingly and turned back to the deliciously smelling patties. Dean’s face lit up and he started to grin. “Awesome! I’m starving!”, he said and planted himself at the small table on the wall opposite of the stove. The kitchen was small, smaller than most kitchens Dean had ever seen, but to be fair, it was an apartment and not a white-picket-fence-house like in America. The brothers chatted casually while Sam was finishing the burgers, catching up on their lives each in Kansas and Germany. Dean told Sam about the one time he pissed Bobby off when one of his female visitors was strolling around naked in the house which made Sam laugh. In return Sam told him about his new life here in Berlin, how the school was going and of his friends. Dean was surprised and relieved to hear his little brother has adjusted so well. When Sam put the plate with a steaming hot burger in front of Dean, he dug in right away ignoring the mocking commentary of his brother that he really should take care of his cholesterol levels. “Dude, this is so good!”, Dean sighed with a full mouth which earned an exasperated look from Sam who’d stacked his burger with a ridiculous sum of vegetables. He finished his burger within a few minutes, making himself another one, despite the accusing looks he got from his younger brother. Dean had missed Sam’s cooking just too much and he wouldn’t waste the opportunity.
He rubbed his eyes, willing the traitorous tears away. A burning pain spread in his chest and filled his lungs. Dean let out a shaky breath, opening his eyes, looking into the rearview mirror. And froze. Cas.
For a while they watched the dark waves crashing on the shore in comfortable silence. Dean couldn’t stop thinking about their previous short conversation and something inside him was curious about the guy sitting next to him.  After a while Dean cleared his throat and turned to Castiel. “So, Cas. What’s the deal with this house? Your brother hasn’t really said anything about it yet.”, he asked, watching the other’s reaction closely. He noticed how Castiel’s body froze and a frown wiped off the solemn look on his pretty face. “It is complicated.”, Castiel muttered. “Hey, you don’t have to answer that. That was a stupid question anyway.”, Dean immediately replied, feeling a bit guilty though he couldn’t exactly why. He didn’t even know the dude. “No, it’s alright, Dean. I understand why Gabriel hasn’t said anything. My family is not exactly something we are proud of.”, Castiel replied and turned to Dean, looking at him intently with a tint of sadness in his eyes. “My family is among the higher political ranks in the GDR. We moved here from Russia when I was a small child.”, he began and Dean nodded slowly. So that’s where his strange yet not unpleasant accent came from. Castiel didn’t lift his gaze from Dean and continued. “The reason my siblings and I speak English so well - My parents insisted we learn the language in order to become successful politicians.”. He furrowed his eyebrows as if he internally cringed at the thought. Dean couldn’t blame him. His family didn’t sound exactly like a perfect apple-pie family. “This house is actually theirs. They bought it for vacation but during my childhood it usually stood empty. After I graduated I decided to move in and live here. My parents weren’t exactly happy with it but decided to leave me alone.”, Castiel finished and Dean could see the tension falling from his shoulders. “Sucks, dude. But you made something really nice out of the place.”, Dean said, pointing at the terrace and the beautiful view to the sea. Cas began to smile and nodded. The moonlight was reflected in his eyes and made them shimmer. ”Yes. I like it here. It’s quiet.”, he only said. Not exactly knowing what to say to that, Dean just nodded and returned the smile, not tearing his gaze away from the silvery- blue eyes. He didn’t know how long they’ve been looking at each other when Cas turned and looked back to the sea, still with a smile on his face.
When he was alone in the living room again, Dean stared out of the window, watching the empty street beneath him. His mind kept him awake with the jet lag and the upcoming days and when the sun rose up and the streets slowly filled with people,  he didn’t feel tired at all. He decided to look in the kitchen for some coffee. A while later Sam trotted into the kitchen, yawning loudly, probably woken up by the clanking and rustling of Dean searching for that damned coffee. “Jeez, Sam - Where the hell do you have your coffee?!”, he moaned, shutting one of the drawers shut. Sam flinched at the loud noise and groaned, showing Dean where he’d hidden the coffee (exactly in that last cabinet Dean hadn’t peeked in yet!”). Two cups of steaming hot coffee and a breakfast later they decided to head out, so Sammy can play the guide and Dean will tease him for being such a nerd. But actually, he was excited to see the city his brother was living in now.
There was this huge shopping street with an unpronounceable name (at least for Dean!) where a lot of rich shops were lined next to each other. Apart from that the city had several parks and cafes, people were sitting outside, eating ice-cream or they were taking a walk, playing with their children, cycling and so on. Dean liked the lively, easy-going atmosphere of the city and slowly he understood Sam’s decision to stay here for a while. What he didn’t like was the fact that the Germans apparently didn’t know pie - he found out when they were eating lunch at a cafe.  Sammy gave him an apologetic look as he grudgingly stabbed his strawberry cake with the fork. He would’ve never admitted it out loud, but the cake was pretty good. After their lunch they made their way to the Wall because Dean really wanted to see what it was like being so close to the border between the Eastern and the Western world. It’d be the closest he’s ever been to the Soviet Union. Sam wasn’t exactly comfortable with the idea but he would never deny his brother. When Dean saw the Wall for the first time, he at first felt a bit disappointed. He’d imagined it as a huge, thick concrete border guarded by soldiers. Instead the Wall was smaller, maybe 10 feet and no spot of concrete could be seen. It’d been sprayed on in so many colors showing paintings, signatures, powerful demands. On the other side though... he could see two watchtowers along the wall. Soldiers stood on there, carrying heavy guns. That was the moment Dean realized how different the West and East were. He wondered what life was like over there, if there are so many people guarding the Wall on that side. Did it feel like a prison?
A bitter chuckle escaped Dean‘s throat as he thought of motel rooms, fast food dinners, coffee spilled on the seats, weapons clinking in the backseat.
This was enough. Something in Dean snapped and he ran. His feet carried him on the hard road, towards the angel. The angel that was once his and all of his and now none of his. One hand grabbed his arm and yanked him around, the other pulling him closer. There was just a second where Dean saw irritation in his eyes before his lips crashed with Cas. They were dry meeting soft ones. Dean‘s entire mind went blank and all he could hear was his heartbeat. Cas seemed frozen in shock. Suddenly, slowly, Dean felt two hands sneaking around his back, grabbing his shirt. Cas returned the kiss with uncertainty which soon disappeared. His hands went to Cas‘ neck, feeling the short black hair at his fingertips. They kissed for seconds, minutes, what could be years on Earth and Dean didn‘t care. He focused on the feeling of Cas. On the radiating warmth that seemed to erase all the hurt and confusion. It felt as if the bond snapped right into place like a broken bone healed. Softly, slowly he pulled away from Cas and opened his eyes. Blue ones looked at him in confusion and hope and Dean let out a shuddering breath, his heart up in his throat. „Me too.“, he whispered and saw Cas‘ eyes widen in shock. Dean couldn‘t help it. He chuckled quietly. „You know, you need to stop looking like that.“, he muttered, which made Cas frown. „Like what?“, he asked with his raspy voice. „Like that stupid angel who wouldn‘t ever believe that I would let him go away like that!“, Dean replied, smirking. His fingers stroked Cas‘ neck and damn, did it feel good. Well, it did feel a little weird, being so close to Cas, but mostly it felt good. „May I remind you, that you‘re the one who died on a rusty nail?“, Cas replied sarcastically and Dean snorted. „Touche.“ He stepped back, but let his hands rest on Cas‘ shoulders, in case that damn angel would still want to fly away. „We good?“, he asked, worry rising up. Maybe Cas really hated him. Maybe he truly did everything wrong.
Before Dean could take a closer look, he heard Cas behind him closing the cabinet doors. “My siblings.”, he heard him say and turned around. “It’s the only photo I have of them.”, Cas continued and handed Dean a glass with a golden liquid. “Is whiskey alright? I don’t really have anything else -”, he tried to apologize but Dean interrupted him, taking the glass quickly. “Dude, I love whiskey!”,he said with a smile. “And your room is awesome! Did you move it all in by yourself?” Cas shook his head with a slight smile. “Most of the things were already here when I moved in. Apart from the books of course.”,  he replied and took a sip. Dean chuckled, taking a sip himself. The whiskey burned in his throat in a familiar way and he could taste an unmistakable tang of the sea mingling beautifully with peat smoke. His eyes widened and he met Cas’ curious gaze. “That’s some good stuff.”, he said and took another sip. “A friend of mine has some connections.”, Cas just replied with a smile. “You want to go to the beach? I always find it calming to take a walk in the night.”, he asked and Dean nodded enthusiastically. “Sure!”
. He really wasn‘t good at this. A few minutes went by, them just staring awkwardly at each other. Then Cas sighed. „I know, Dean. You don‘t feel the same way. You don‘t need to say this.“, he murmured and took a few steps back, shoving his hands down the pockets of his trenchcoat. Dean just gaped at him in shock. „Do you really believe that?“, he said a little louder than expected and flinched. Cas just stared at him blankly, mask all up. „Yes.“, he just said.
„Y‘know. What you said-“, he started but Cas already interrupted him. „You don‘t need to do this.“, he said, a sad and angry look on his face. „No, I need to do this. You need to listen to me, Cas!“, replied Dean. Anger surged through him too. „So don‘t fly away with that feathered ass of yours!“
The night, though peaceful, came to an abrupt end as Dean was woken up by loud knocking on the door. “Dean! We gotta get up!”, he heard Sammy’s voice and groaned. Why the hell did they have to get up this early? Grumbling, Dean staggered out of the “bed” and dressed himself, packing up his things. “Coffee, Sammy?”, he called hopefully and the reply came immediately. “Is in the kitchen. Better drink it now, they’re coming any minute!” Groaning Dean made his way to the small counter and poured himself a cup. “Remind me why we need to go at such an early hour?” he called to Sam who was probably braiding his hair in his room or whatever. Oh, that coffee was healing his sleep-deprived soul. "Dean,it's the
“Hey, Castiel.”, he greeted him nonchalantly and turned back to the sea, taking another sip of his beer. He’d heard some rustling and Castiel stepped into his view. He raised his head with a raised eyebrow, expecting the other man to just ignore him. But instead he met Castiel’s gaze. His irritatingly blue eyes, now darker due to the dim light of the moon, were looking at him in curiosity. “Hello, Dean.”, the other man replied in his gravelly voice. “I believe we’ve been on the wrong foot.” Castiel’s eyes were still on him and Dean swallowed. Somehow he couldn’t dart his own eyes away from this deep blue. Slowly he nodded, cursing himself for the irritating reaction he had on this strange man. “Yeah, you bet.”, Dean said evenly. Castiel tilted his head with a slight smile. “May I sit?”, he asked and pointed to the empty space on the bench. “Sure, man.”, Dean replied with a shrug, deciding that this night couldn’t get weirder anyway. He released a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding as Castiel sat down beside him. “I want to apologize for my rude behavior.”, he said in a serious tone and looked straight at Dean. There was a slight accent in his voice and Dean wondered what it was. He didn’t really know what to say to that so he just chuckled nervously. “Don’t sweat it, man. I mean, we’re the ones intruding your home, so it should actually be me who’s apologizing. Well, actually, its that stupid brother of yours.”, he replied and mentally kicked himself for blabbering. He saw something like humor flicker in these blue eyes and saw the other man smile slightly. “Actually, yes, I still blame Gabriel for all of it. But that doesn’t excuse my rudeness to all of you.”, Castiel said and looked at the sea. Dean had to suppress a smile. Maybe this guy wasn’t so bad.
“Lucifer? Like the devil? Wow he must have been a handful. Does he live up to his name, at least?”
DEAN: Yes, Cas. I’d like that. When are you free? Name the time and place, I’ll be there.
CAS: I am doing better than I was a few months ago, and I am sorry too, for how I reacted. I miss you, Dean. I miss my best friend. I know it is too much to ask for, but I was hoping that we could meet sometime soon? I would really like to see you, and apologize in person.
“Dean Ross Winchester!” came an angry voice from the other end of the call, making Dean flinch. Sammy never used his full name unless he was in trouble. Well two can play this game.
“Listen, Dean –“
Snapping out of his thoughts, Dean raised his eyes to look at Cas’ face. Cas was pretty much staring at Dean and was blushing slightly. Dean looked down at himself and almost smacked his own fa e because of it. His Jeans was unbuttoned and hung low on his hips. His shirt was open in the front and gave an unobstructed view of his chest and stomach. He realized that Cas was staring at the tattoo that he had on his chest. A flaming star kind of thing that, according to lore, prevented Demon possessions. Dean didn’t believe in all that but Sam did. So when Sam went to get his tattoo, Dean got it too. Beneath the star was the date of his parents’ deaths.
“So? How was your day off? I heard you went back to Cas’ place. Did you guys do it? Oh you totally did, didn’t you? How was he? Was he the best sex you ever had? He looks like he’d be amazing in bed. How –“
Groaning, Dean pushed Cas off himself and reached for his phone to turn off the alarm. Finally, with his alarm quiet, he woke up a bit and looked around. Sometime during the night their t-shirts had come off and now Cas was lying beside him, trying to snuggle into his side, humming contentedly when he found the warmth of Dean’s body beside him.
“How can I help you?” he asked. He knew Balthazar hated it when Castiel was so formal with him but by now the habit had been beaten into him and Castiel preferred to keep it up with everyone.
When he entered the room, Claire immediately spotted him and ran to him with the shout of “Mr. Doctor!”
Before Dean could say anything, Cas interrupted, “Don’t worry, I already told him to go home. So today Dean will go home and sleep and then come out for drinks with me, before joining back for work tomorrow.”
In reality, Dean wrapped his hand around his dick right as Cas’ lips wrapped around the head of Dean’s dick. The slight touch was a relief from all the pressure, causing Dean to sigh with pleasure. Dean’s hand squeezed slightly at the head of his dick, right at Cas, in his imagination, began to suck at it.
A few minutes later, Cas was almost ready to leave for his date. With Dean’s blue shirt, and a pair of jeans that showed off his ass wonderfully, Cas looked like a walking wet dream. Not to mention his hair which looked like he just had a round of really amazing sex. Thankfully, Cas was too busy trying to fix his hair to see Dean adjust his jeans because who would not be turned on by that view.
Dean reached the room and waited for Cas like he was told to. What seemed like a century (but was actually less than two minutes) later, Cas came sauntering in, his heels clacking on the floor almost seductively. He closed the door behind him and crawled onto the bed, not even bothering to take off his heels, arching his back to show off the curve of his ass, before settling against the headrest.
“If I can’t wear my band tees, what am I supposed to wear, oh queen mine?” Dean mocks her.
“Well, then, you can keep sleeping, but you won’t get to meet Mr. Cas and Claire.”
Dean moaned at the hot, wet pressure around him. He pulled Cas’ knees over his shoulders and leaned forward to kiss hi, before he started fucking into him- hard and fast and relentless.
Dean waved him off because, really, it wasn’t a big deal. Sure, not a lot of people had seen this photograph but it wasn’t a big deal despite what Charlie said.
Dean, even though totally on board with this turn of events, was still confused about what was going on.
Cas cut Dean off with another kiss. “Dean. Why wouldn’t I want you? Why wouldn’t anyone want you? You’re one of the most selfless people I’ve ever met. If it was up to you, you’d spend your entire time with the kids, your own wellbeing be damned. I am honored to know that you want me back when you could have anyone else you wanted. I don’t do one night stands, Dean. And if it is acceptable to you, I would very much like to take you out on a date tomorrow.”
By the time Cas had dropped him off at the hospital for his shift, he was already running late for work so they decided that Cas would come over to the hospital after school, along with Claire. There while Claire was with the nurses and other kids, getting to know them, Dean and Cas would discuss the best plan of action about what to do for her.
Dean looked at Charlie’s retreating figure and wondered what sins he was making up for that he had such nosy friends. He joined Cas and they went to the movies.
“He’s not my husband, Sammy. Cut it.” Dean told him, seeing clearly that Cas always got uncomfortable when people teased them like that.
With shaking hands, Dean managed to open the door and unceremoniously led Cas into his room. Once inside, Dean shut the door and continued to kiss any part of Cas’ body that he could reach. Dean fisted one hand in Cas’ hair while his other hand roamed all over his chest and stomach.
And please do leave a comment if you liked it, and if you want me to add or change something (I'll see what I can do about it)
“Fuck me.” Dean whispered, still looking at Cas’ dick in his hand. He looked up and met Cas’ eyes. “I want you to fuck me, Cas. I want –“ Cas cut him off with a desperate press of his lips.
Dean picked up his tray and brought it back to his table, clearing it up a bit to give Castiel some space to sit. If Castiel’s seat ended up being too close to Dean because of a suspicious lack of space on the table, that was no one’s business.
Instead of going to his regular haunt, The Harvelle’s Roadhouse, he went to the gay club that was a few minutes away from his house, because that way, at least he won’t have to feel bad about turning down any girls that hit on him.
Dean opened his mouth to reply but he was cut short by Cas again.
Dean was reduced to moans and grunts as Cas fucked him hard enough for his back to bruise against the wall.
He turned to the guy and smiled sweetly, “Would you look at that, even as faggots, we can get more pussy than you. How does that make you feel? Come on, Cas, let’s go.”
It was possibly hours before he was finally able to fall asleep with tears in his eyes about not being able to tell Cas he loved him ever. Especially now that Cas was so happy to be dating Blondie. He would never mess that up for his best friend even if it meant hurting himself. Cas deserved to be happy and if it was Blondie who made him happy then Dean would just be civil towards him.
eyes, and is sporting some serious sex hair. Seriously, every time Castiel rode his motorcycle to the classes, the helmet messed up his hair, and all Dean wanted to do was to run his hand through it, pulling at the soft-looking locks and mess them up even more. Again, Dean knows that to a normal person, it would be seriously creepy how much he knows about his student’s life. And if the fucking clothes and the hair and the glasses weren’t enough, Castiel lifts his hand to twirl his pencil between his fingers and that action almost brings Dean to his knees right there in front of his entire class. Castiel is wearing black gloves- the kind with the fingers cut off at the knuckles- and is sporting some maroon nail polish that matched his jacket perfectly. God, what wouldn’t Dean give to see those huge, red nailed hands wrapped around his cock, right fucking now! Dean wants those fingers on his cock, him sucking on them, or maybe fingering him open for something much big- STOP! Ugh he really needs to concentrate, today’s topic was an important one! Dammit, Novak!
“Glad that you asked, Cassie. See, the thing is, I don’t want to go to the stupid ball, I’d much rather enjoy the night with my lady friend and try to convince her to take part in a ménage e – what’s the French for twelve? – Anyway, I don’t want to go and mother would be furious if I didn’t so I want you to go on my behalf. And before you say anything, this isn’t a request, I insist. Have some fun, you deserve it after what the family has put you through for all these years.”
“Fuck, you’re so gorgeous.” Cas groans and tries to fuck Dean even faster. Dean can feel the rough material of Cas’ jeans against his ass, and dammit, if getting fucked while still fully clothed isn’t the hottest thing ever.
By this time, Mr. Novak looked tense, almost as if he was afraid that his sexuality would come in the way of his daughter’s treatment. Dean decided to put his fears to rest.
“Oh hey, Cas” Dean said awkwardly. “I thought you would have left by now, you know, for your date with Balthazar.”
That was more than what could be said to Castiel’s stepmother, who shunned him when he revealed his preference for men. Even though Castiel still lived in the house, he was treated like garbage and more often than not, he wondered if it was all worth it.
This hit Dean like a bag of bricks. “Okay, let’s say what you said is true, there is still a problem. Cas is in a relationship, and there is no way I’m going to break them up just because I love him. He deserves to be happy and he will be happier with that Brit than he would be with me.”
Again, with the Dad voice. Dean rolled his eyes and went to Cas’ car thinking that if Sam knew that the parent voice worked on Dean, he would probably make him eat rabbit food all day long.
AS USUAL, FEEL FREE TO POINT OUT ANY AND ALL MISTAKES.
Even though they had gotten ready for sleep a while ago, it was after 12 when they finally fell asleep, on the couch of all places. They had been awake, talking about themselves in a manner that seemed a lot like a relationship-y way to Dean, staying up till late, talking and munching on some frozen fries that Cas had heated up. With someone else, this would have scared Dean, but with Cas, it felt natural. And before either of them knew it, they were asleep, in the middle of a conversation about how Dean had restored his car, his Baby, after a particularly bad accident. It was the same accident that had killed his dad but Dean left that part out, along with any talk about his tattoos. That was a bit too personal to share with someone he had known for only a few days.
Fuck that man had a mouth on him. It was a surprise that Dean hadn’t come already, what with how turned on he was. He nodded once and Cas smiled, satisfied. He took off his jeans and boxers and stood beside Dean in all his glory. Dean’s mouth went dry because Cas had an absolutely gorgeous dick. It was at least ten inches long, had to be at least that, and so thick that Dean wasn’t sure if his hand would even wrap completely around it. He couldn’t wait to have it in him.
As it began to get dark, Balth told him to get up because they had somewhere to be. Groggy, Cas woke up and helped Balth clear up. By the time they were in the car, Cas was fully awake and ready to go wherever they were going. Soon they stopped in front of Balth’s house and Balth got out to open his door and escort him to the door like the gentleman that he was. As they entered the house and turned on the light, a bunch of people shouted ‘Happy Birthday’ to him and came to hug him. Among of the first to hug him was Gabe, who Cas was pleasantly surprised to see there.
They stayed at the bar for at least a couple hours, but Dean lost track of time. He was with Cas, albeit on a not date, and he was in the familiar territory of The Roadhouse, where he practically grew up. Through the night, they had beer and burgers and pies. Jo and Ellen and Bobby, who was Ellen’s husband and Dean’s surrogate father, all came over to their table to tease Dean and tell Cas that they would whoop Dean’s ass if he was out of line, to which Dean always looked offended and replied, “I thought you all were supposed to be on my team!” They shared some embarrassing anecdotes about Dean from his childhood and taking pity on Dean, Cas shared some of his poor moments. Lapses in judgements as he called them.
After Dean, quite literally, tucked Cas in bed he put a bucket near his head to puke in, if needed, and set a glass of water and medicines to help with the headache that was sure to be present in the morning. Then he went to the couch to sleep there for the night. There was no way he was letting Cas sleep on the couch when he was drunk. Dean spent better part of the next hour cleaning up rooms that didn’t need to be cleaned, just to simmer down his arousal, but it didn’t work. Cas’ touching had him all worked up and the knowledge that Cas was in his bed, sleeping in his clothes just sent shivers down his spine. He lay in bed for even longer, wanting to fall asleep, but his veins were burning with desire and all he could think of was the way Cas’ hands felt on him. Finally, unable to ignore his dick any longer, Dean turned over and shoved his sweatpants down to his knees. He pulled down the comforter and licked him palm, before covering his achingly hard cock with it.
“I never thought I’d get to do this.” Cas said. “I knew you were gay but just because you were gay didn’t mean you had to like me. Jessica told me multiple times that I wouldn’t know until I tried to talk to you, but I never could gather the courage. What if you rejected me? It would be uncomfortable at the hospital and I didn’t want Claire to get in between of our drama.”
"... sexual tension between them. It's suffocating." Charlie was saying
When they went to the counter, the barista seemed amused to see their group’s antics. Gabe flirted shamelessly with anything and anyone that caught his attention, most of all he flirted with Sam whose face turned all shades of red.
“Dr. Winchester, you have a call from Dr. Barnes in paediatrics. She says she has a possible Cancer case for you.”
“Oh so you did get my message. Just never bothered to respond.” Dean replied lightheartedly but letting some of the hurt seep into his voice.
“Yeah, well, nothing happened, Bradbury. Because he doesn’t have a crush on me and we’re just friends. Now get to work, don’t you have kids to look after?”
“Really? How have you rebelled?” Dean was intrigued. Who would have thought that this Holy Tax Accountant looking guy would be a rebel by nature?
“What? Have an orgasm? Some would consider it a cause for concern, Dean.” Cas replied with a too realistic to be true innocent face.
“Me too, Cas, I- What are your plans for Christmas?” he asks, swallowing the ball of anxiety that is building inside him. Cas tilts his head in confusion and squints adorably.
“Whatever, Dean. I’m going to sleep. Good night.”
Now that the cat was out of the bag, so to speak, Sam, Gabe and Charlie left no chance to tease Dean about Cas. Sure, they did it earlier as well, but then it was just to rile him up. Now they knew for a fact that there was something going on and their teasing just got worse.
When only a week was left for Cas’ big birthday bash, almost everything had been arranged. The booze, the food, the birthday pie (a tradition of theirs ever since Dean had made Cas the pie), the guests, and the strippers (don’t ask. That was all Gabe and Dean knew it would do no good to try and stop him). The only thing remaining was making sure Cas got to Douche-thazar’s house in time for the party.
Cas looked up at him and grinned, before tucking him back in and zipping up his pants, as if he didn’t just almost cause them to be in an accident. Damn, it would have been embarrassing to explain why he crashed into something. ‘Oh yes sorry officer, actually I had my dick down the throat of the guy I’ve been in love with for years.’ Yeah, no thanks.
Fairly certain by now that Castiel was queer as well, Dean decided to shoot his shot.
Ignoring the sarcasm in his voice, Charlie fishes out a red colored button up that ‘brings out his eyes’ with a pair of dark blue jeans that ‘hug his cute little bubble butt perfectly’. She also insists on doing his hair in a different way, which he won’t admit, looks pretty good.
Castiel pounded on Dean's door, creating a ruckus that Dean's hungover brain could not tolerate this early in the morning. With a groan and a throbbing head, Dean turned towards his clock and saw that it was 10.30 am. Right as Dean ay back down, Cas crashed open his door and climbed on the bed, shouting even louder with a shit eating grin plastered on his face. Bastard. He knew Dean was hungover and still he thought it was a good idea to be loud. That meant only one thing. War.
“..... Hello? Earth to Dean? Ground control to major Tom? Anybody in there? Yoo-hoo?” A hand waved and fingers clicked in front of Dean’s eyes as he came back to the present. He looked around and realized that he was still at lunch with Charlie.
As always, English isn't my first language and this is unbeta'ed so feel free to point out any mistakes.
That shut Sam up for a whole until they went to sleep.
Dean looked at him blankly because not many parents wanted to do that. “What?” he asked.
.” he said, extending his arm for Dean to shake. “I am Castiel, owner and night shift barista.”
"Oh, come on, Jo," Cas chimes in. "You really don't have the right audience here. None of them care what girls think about asses."
Cas opened his mouth to interrupt him but once more, Dean held up a hand, cutting him off before he could speak. He thought that it would be easier for him to simply say what he wanted to, and get it over with, rather than wait for Cas to let him down kindly.
When they’re both relatively more presentable, Dean turns around and wraps his arms around Cas’ neck and pulls the man in for a kiss.
The disappointment on Cas' face about Dean needing to go quickly disappears and he happily gives his number to Dean.
Thankfully, it was a slow night, and Castiel didn’t get any customers. Every once in a while, Castiel would get up to get them refills and would come back and slide his seat closer to Dean. whether it was on purpose or not, Dean didn’t know; but he sure as hell wasn’t complaining. During the course of the next few episodes, Dean and Castiel ended up with Dean’s arm around Castiel’s shoulders and Castiel’s head resting on Dean. Every time Castiel would huff out a laugh, Dean felt the hot breath tickle his neck. Castiel’s hand had ended up resting on Dean’s thigh and even through the material of his sweatpants, he could feel the warmth of it. Truth be told, he had no idea what part of the plot they were at - he had a six feet tall, wet dream of a man, cuddled up to him and not even Merlin could take his attention away from that.
“On your hands and knees.” He said. Prepping someone was much easier this way. As soon as Dean got into position, all thoughts left Cas’ mind. Dean had a perfect ass and his pink hole was fluttering in anticipation. Without a lot of self-control, Cas leaned forward and sucked at Dean’s hole. The moan that he was rewarded with was one of pure ecstasy and Cas knew he had done something right. He speared his tongue and began to fuck Dean’s hole with it. He ate the man out like a starved man, until Dean was a moaning, writhing mess on his bed, eagerly pushing his ass into Cas’ face for more. There was a constant stream of pre-come leaking from his dick and making a mess of the sheets.
Dean was so distracted by the sensations that he missed the sound of the bottle opening, and the next thing he knew, there was a cold finger pressed against his hole, not quite pushing in. he moaned loudly and pushed his hips back, trying to get it in. when Cas pushed in his finger, it burned a bit. Dean stiffened and Cas must have felt it because he redoubled his efforts around Dean’s cock, trying to distract him. Soon Dean had relaxed enough to start begging for more fingers.
“You should come over to my place. We don’t do a huge celebration, just me and my brother, and our best friend. There’s no way I’m letting you guys celebrate Christmas alone! It should be illegal for anyone to be alone during the holidays!” Dean would have gone on and on about how he felt about people spending holidays alone when Cas interrupted him.
Dean nods, and with one last lingering look at Cas' mouth, turns to leave, heading back home.
He turned towards Cas and took his hand, pulling him outside. They got to the car, hands still held together. Cas stopped Dean and hugged him. “Thank you, Dean.” He said.
After the end of the movie, Cas dropped off Dean at his place, where they ate some of Dean’s homemade burgers with a beer each.
Dean Winchester is writing some notes for today’s lecture on the beard when he hears the door open and shut, followed by the quiet shuffling of feet. He sighs to himself and without turning towards the class, says, “You’re late, Novak.” curtly, but not unkindly.
“What are you doing with my clothes?” he asked in an amused tone.
“Merry Christmas, babe.” he says, dropping a kiss on his kids’ cheeks and pecking Cas on the lips.
Suddenly the lights turned on and Dean saw a gorgeous blonde hovering at the door with a baseball bat in her hands.
“No Mister Dean, you know my daddy!”
“Ugh, gross.” complains Claire and Dean grins at her.
Jeez I'm an unreliable piece of crap, aren't I? I don't even know what to say except that I was too lazy to type this out and kept on putting it off.
Dean was going to have a really hard time, no pun intended. No one should be allowed to be this sinfully hot.
By the time they got up to leave, Dean and Cas were pleasantly buzzed, so Jo decided to drop them off at Cas’ place. Cas would then drop off Dean to the hospital, where he was already supposed to be headed in the morning, before going for work.
Anyway, here you go.
Just yesterday, for instance, Dean was in the shower when he realized he had forgotten his clothes in his room. Assuming that Cas had already left for his date (who went for so many dates, anyway? Cas and Balthazar, apparently), Dean, instead of wrapping his towel around his waist, used it to dry his hair and went to his room to get his clothes.
Cas was in his room buttoning up his jeans. His jeans that hugged his ass in such a perfect way that Dean had to remind himself to breathe because HOLY FUCK Cas had a phenomenally perfect ass. That ass should be made illegal. Cas was wearing nothing – absolutely nothing – on top. Dean wasn’t sure if he should check out Cas’ ass or his chest. Cas had a perfectly chiselled chest, how had Dean missed that before? Dean’s eyes raked Cas’ naked torso with the hunger of  someone who hadn’t gotten laid in ages. Although, in Dean’s case that was pretty accurate.
Dean had been pacing in the room for the past God-only-knew-how-long, since Cas left for his date with that prick Balthazar. Yeah, okay so Dean hasn’t ever met or talked to Balthazar but it didn’t make him any less of a prick. Any one who went on a date with Cas was a prick, as far as Dean was concerned. Any one who went on a date with Cas was a stupid, selfish prick who didn’t deserve to be with Cas because Cas was one of the most selfless people that Dean knew.
“Shut up, Dean. I know you’re off now, I wanted to ask, will you be coming back home any time soon?”
“Goddammit” Dean muttered. Thankfully the voices were a total boner killer so he didn’t have to worry about feeling guilty about jacking off to his male best friend.
With his husband and kids under the same roof, there is nothing about this picture that Dean would want to change.
So here Dean was, pacing the room, with his eyes on the door and ears outside, listening for any sign of Cas coming back from his date. Now it wasn’t as if Dean was jealous. Pshht! He wasn’t, really. He was just worried about his best friend because Cas hadn’t been on too many dates before. What if he read the situation wrong? What if something happened? What if Cas was in trouble and needed his help?
Dean was awake in mere seconds as soon as he realized what happened and turned around to look at Cas. Cas was obliviously still asleep, his arm wrapped around Dean’s waist. His hair was a mess, more so than usual, and his mouth was slightly parted as he took in deep breaths. And because, of course, Dean was only human, his gaze shifted lower than that. Cas had fallen asleep in his sweatpants and a T-shirt, but during the course of the night, his T-shirt had ridden up and his pants hung pretty low. So low that Dean could see the head of Cas’ dick peeking out of the waistband, swollen and flush. That along with the fact that Cas had just humped the air in his sleep, moaning out something that sounded dangerously close to ‘Dean’, was not helping the rapidly hardening situation in Dean’s own clothes.
“I’m almost there, I’ll be there in 5.”
“So you gonna tell me what’s up with you and Gabriel?”
Sam looked at Cas like he had grown another head. “You said that to Dean, and he agreed? Wow Dean, all these years and you never took a day off and you agreed to him? Kudos.”
Before he knew it, the day was over and Dean hadn’t gotten anything done and neither was he any close to figuring out if Cas had a crush on him.
“Are you feeling well, Dean? You don’t sound well. Do you have a fever? Wait I’ll get you some medicine, it will help.”
Cas gave Dean one last glance and got up to leave but Dean held his wrist and stopped him. Dean got up and pretty much crowded Cas’ personal space.
“What? Yes I’m here, you were saying? Wait a second when did Gabe come on call, I was talking to Sammy.” Dean said, not realizing that he had zoned out for a minute, so focused on Cas’ ass that he didn’t notice Gabe come on line.
By the time Cas left, Dean had been overthinking a bit too much so he decided to grab another beer before he went off to sleep. He’d berate Charlie later. Right now, he had an aching dick to take care of and go to sleep. He wondered if would he ever remain friends with Cas after all this blew over and his daughter was done with her treatment.
Dean turns around to look at his student and stops dead in his tracks. Castiel was a good looking man on a regular day (Dean would know- he had had many phenomenal orgasms that ended with Cas’ name on his lips), but today he seems to be taking the word gorgeous to a whole new level. He is wearing a red, nearly maroonish leather jacket that is almost a size too small, stretching around his biceps and his chest deliciously, and a dark wash jeans that Dean knows even from the glimpse he gets of Castiel’s backside, was the one that always framed the bulge in his crotch perfectly - yes, he knew it might be borderline creepy how well Dean knew Castiel’s clothes, considering the younger man had been in his classes this semester only.
"I am." Dean says timidly.
More number of guests, however, posed one problem. How would Dean fit them all into his place. His place was big enough for just a few guests but the entire department would never be able to fit in there. So he had only one option on his hand. Balthazar.
Dean was the best doctor in the field in the entire state so his services were quite in demand. Every morning he would reach the hospital around 7am with gifts for his patients and their families in the form of food. He would go over the vitals of all his patients and take care of his appointments for the day. Then he would make his rounds, sitting with all the kids one by one, talking to them and making them laugh. After lunch, he would gather the kids around him and read them stories, while the slightly elder kids would do what they wanted. After story time the children would take a nap as he looked over other stuff like paperwork. He would sit with the families of the children and tell them about the treatment and how it was going. By 11pm he’d get ready to go back home and by 12 he’d be in bed. His phone was always by his side so that whenever he was on leave or at home, he’d still be on call. On such occasions when he wasn’t in the hospital, another child oncologist, Dr. Jessica Moore, would always be on call. Jess always told him to go home early or take a vacation but with only two doctors, they didn’t have time for that.
That night Dean slept like a log, better than he had in a long time. Thank God for visiting brothers who wore him out, right?
Castiel Novak was his oldest student. At age 34, he was almost the same age as Dean, and Dean had overheard him talking to his friends about how he was married to his childhood best friend turned high school sweetheart. In any other situation Dean would have felt guilty for thinking that the other man was painfully, devastatingly gorgeous, but Dean figured, their age difference wasn’t much, so it wasn’t as bad as it would have been with his other students.
Both the men collect their coffee orders and go sit at a table towards the back of the shop, talking about nothing and everything. Dean tells Cas about how he came back home early on his birthday, just to find his husband in bed with someone else- two someone else's to be specific- and Cas expresses his anger on Dean's behalf. In return, Cas tells him about how he got custody of his infant niece after his brother died, and is a single parent to the now 7 year old. Dean feels lighter than he has since his divorce, and the whole thing feels a lot like a date, but he doesn't mention that to Cas.
The kiss ended too soon for Dean’s liking, and as far as first kisses went, it was not the best either, but it was everything he wanted from his and Cas’ first kiss. Dean pulled back and rested his forehead against Cas’, his eyes still closed. He let his hands roam over any part of Cas’ body that he could reach – his chest, his back, his thighs, his face. Finally Dean settled his hands on Cas’ head, fingers tangled in his hair, which were indeed as soft as they looked. Finally he opened his eyes and looked at Cas. His lips were red and swollen from their kiss, his pupils dilated with arousal and his breath was coming out in pants. It was one of the most glorious sights that Dean had ever seen.
“You know,” IRL!Merlin with his blue eyes and dark hair began. “If having to pause your show annoys you this much, you could always wait two minutes to collect your order and THEN start it?”
"Oh yeah? Why? Are they suddenly all gay?" Jo snarks back, not unkindly.
Your comments and Kudos mean the world to me.
“Going somewhere, doctor?”
Finally after a long time of crying, Dean lifter his head from where Cas was holding it against himself and unwrapped his arms from around his waist. Huh. When did that happen? He wiped off his tears and looked guiltily on the stains he left on Cas’ shirt.
The duo left the house as quietly as they could and as they went out to the terrace again, Cas stopped. “Wait, I forgot something.”, he just said and vanished back into the dark house. As soon as Dean was alone he walked towards the railing and put his elbows on it. The salty scent of the sea filled his lungs and cleared his mind a bit. Cas was pretty alright, he thought. Actually, more than that. Before their meeting on the terrace, Dean had thought Cas was some cranky, arrogant guy with a stick in his ass. But the other man had proved him otherwise. He couldn’t really grasp what had happened but something told him he could trust this guy. So far Dean actually liked him the most from the people he’d met here apart from Charlie. He was sort of awkward, but somehow his rusty social skills made him even more bearable. Dean was fed up with people trying to talk around the bush and Cas was refreshingly different.
“Come on, Dean!”, he heard Sam shout and wrinkled his nose. “Shut your cakehole, Sammy!”, he retorted and took another step into the cold waves. The wet sand beneath his bare feet felt weird, slimy, muddy and he didn’t like the feeling. After arriving yesterday, the friends decided to swim in the sea once they’d finished breakfast. It would be the first time for Dean and that’s saying something. But he didn’t expect the water to be this cold. The waves splashed around his legs and he shuddered once more. The others were already deep in the water, laughing and shouting. Gabriel was diving beneath the surface and sometimes Dean could hear one of the girls shriek and giggle as Gabriel tickled them sneakily. The beach was empty, since it was the family’s private ground as Gabe had explained to them the night before. So at least Dean didn’t have that many spectators laughing at how he was still struggling to get into the waters. The sun was burning his back and he sighed. After gathering up all the courage he could find, he jumped into the waves.
„Look, Cas.“, Dean started. „I‘m not good with words, so- um..“ Cas just stood still, waiting for what he had to say. It made him nervous. He felt his heart racing in his chest and tried to grasp the next words in his already scrambled brain.
Dean smiled. His eyes followed the racing clouds as he thought about Sammy and his short-term stay in a country that he knew nothing about except the fact that it is in Europe. The next hours passed by in a trance and suddenly Dean was jolted out of his thoughts by the rattling and shaking of the machine. A mechanic voice announced: “We are soon landing in Berlin-Tempelhof. Please fasten your seatbelts and remain in your seats.”
Berlin was huge. That’s the first thought Dean had if someone would ask him about the city.
His whole body was frozen, tensed, anxiety-filled, as he sat in this too new car, listening to Kansas, all alone. He never realized how big Baby actually was, how much space there was. It felt strange not to have Sam sitting next to him, pouting about Dean‘s choice of music, Cas in the back, squinting at Dean as he didn‘t get the reference.
, the sarcastic voice in his head said.
And for the first time in years, Dean felt true happiness.
. Didn't he know she is way out of his league? Dean grinned at Jess. "Nice to meet you too. Sam's told me a lot about you.", he said with a wink and caught sight of his brother blushing furiously behind Jess.
When they stepped on the terrace, Gabriel knocked on the door instead of taking out keys. After the questioning looks he got from the others he rolled his eyes. “Well, my baby bro basically lives here. So I figured I’d give him a heads up!”, he explained and Dean raised his eyebrows and glanced at Sammy who looked just as confused. The younger Winchester cleared his throat. “Um, Gabe, did you tell him we were coming?”, he asked and Gabriel just shrugged, smiling wickedly. Dean sighed and shook his head. If that brother is a younger version of Gabriel and now pissed - he really wasn’t looking forward to it. Gabriel knocked again and they could hear a grumbling voice saying: “I’m coming.”. Soon after the door opened and a taller guy with dark hair and broad shoulders stepped out. Once he saw Gabriel he glared at his older brother. “What are you doing here, Gabriel?”, he growled in a deep voice Dean hasn’t heard like before. “Oh well, Cassie, I thought I’m gonna take a little trip with my friends! Now let us in!”,Gabriel replied nonchalantly and pat his brother on the shoulder which earned him another glare. “Cassie” stood with his back to Dean, so he couldn’t see his face, but he saw his shoulders sag in defeat. “Fine.”, Gabriel’s brother grumbled and stepped aside to let Gabriel in, who let out a loud “wohoo!” and stormed in.
, Dean thought,
What a strange name. Charlie stepped forward and grinned at him. “Hey! Nice to meet you! I’m Charlie!”, she said and pointed at the brothers. “The tall one is Sam and the shorter-” - “
The car came to a screeching halt and Dean stumbled out of Baby as fast as he could, keeping his eyes on the angel standing on the middle of the road.
(almost wrote pain instead of main, because honestly this is all supernatural is about, am I right?)
Darkness wrapped over the bright trenchcoat, over the blue eyes, over the last smile.
When they were all ready, the four young people followed Gabriel along a small path that led them out of the forest and onto the dunes. The sight stole Dean’s breath. White beach stretched out as far as he could see. The sea was green-blue and waves crashed to the shore. A strong wind blew into their faces, cooling the heat from the sun. And on top of the dunes, surrounded by a few pine trees there was a house. It was a fairly old one, in white, decorated in a lot of details. He could see a huge terrace with a view at the sea and immediately knew he’ll be sitting on there all day, just watching the waves. “C’mon, kiddos!”, Gabriel called and Dean saw he wasn’t the only one that stopped, watching their surroundings in amazement. A laugh was bubbling in his throat and rose to the surface and he beamed at Sammy as they started walking towards the house.
blue? Castiel stared at him, face unreadable. And Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away, something about him captivated him. When he heard Sam clearing his throat though, he finally awoke and blinked a little, looking to the ground. Charlie and Jess already entered the house and he could hear them laughing with Gabriel. “Well, Castiel, it’s nice to meet you.”, Sam said, being the more diplomatic one of the two brothers. Dean looked up to see that Castiel only just now tore his gaze from Dean and faced Sam. “Hello, Sam and Dean.”, he said and nodded inside. “Apparently my brother has already made himself comfortable here. I suggest you two better go in and find your rooms before Gabriel makes a mess of them.”, he muttered, frowning. Dean hadn’t said anything yet but now he chuckled. Castiel’s eyes fell on him again and Dean’s words suddenly stumbled in his throat. “Well, that sounds like Gabriel. I mean I have only met him today, but I can imagine he’s gonna leave the whole house in a wreck.”, he said and pat Sam on the back. “C’mon, Sammy, let’s go.”
“Dude, this is
, Dean thought and followed his example. Shortly after they made their way to the beach, barefooted and with a bottle of liquor. The sand was wet and cool beneath Dean’s feet as they reached the sea. Cold water flowed around their ankles as they walked along, chatting about their favorite books. Dean mostly listened to Cas ramble about Tolstoi and Dostoevsky as he hadn’t read that many books himself. In return he told Cas all about the TV shows they had back home. “Dude, you don’t know Scooby Doo?!”, he exclaimed in disbelief as Cas gave him a confused look when he started talking about his favorite childhood shows. This revelation ended in a long lecture about the famous dog and his friends to which Cas listened with great interest. Dean didn’t know how much time had passed or how long they’ve walked until they noticed the sky turning brighter and changing colors. Hues of pink and orange streaked along the blue of the night. The sea was calm and glittered in all colors as the sun rose up. The two men sat down on the sand, watching the sunrise and sharing the bottle of whiskey in comfortable silence, each lost in their own thoughts. Dean was once again mesmerized by the view, feeling an utter sense of hope and peace. And that Cas was sitting next to him in the sand, not caring whether his clothes would get dirty or that he’d get too cold - well, that made it even more memorable.
“How come you’re here, Dean?”, he asked then, leaning back on the bench. Dean followed his example and leaned back too, looking up at the starry sky which didn’t look that different from the one in the States. “Well, there’s Sammy, my little brother. He hates being called Sammy but I’ve called him that ever since.” He heard Cas chuckle. “I suppose that is an older brother thing.”, the lean man mused and Dean started to grin. “Yeah, well he might be taller than I but I still remember the times I changed his diapers and fed him some Lucky Charms.”, Dean continued. “What about your parents?”, Cas asked curiously and Dean felt a heavy weight on his heart. He closed his eyes and breathed out. “My mum died when I was four. It was a fire and dad barely got me ’n Sammy out. Although I don’t remember much I miss her. She used to say angels were watching over me. Baked me all sorts of pies when dad was working.”, Dean murmured and straightened himself with a sigh. When he opened his eyes he saw Cas looking at him with a strange look on his face. It wasn’t exactly pity and Dean was grateful for that. He’d heard too many people saying “I’m sorry for your loss” in his life. He cleared his throat and darted his eyes away. The sound of the waves took a bit of the weight in his heart away. “Well, Dad’s been taking care of us ever since. We moved around a lot due to his work but at least we had a roof over our head. Although the summers at Bobby’s up in South Dakota were the best.”, he said with a shrug, forcing himself to smile. He didn’t want to ruin the mood, so he continued on. “Bobby’s a friend of my dad, practically family by now. He’s quite a grumpy guy who says ‘balls’ a lot, but he took care of me and Sammy more than once. And he taught me all about cars. Thanks to him Sammy was able to go to college and get this scholarship that got him here. I’m just here for a visit. Usually I fix cars back at Bobbys.”, Dean finished and smiled. He was so proud of his younger brother. Though he’d never tell him that or else Sam would never let it down. But Dean was glad he’d made himself a future and found some friends here. He knew Sam will be alright and that thought gave him immense joy.
"Your son of a bitch, you're lucky
"Abuse? I just taught him a lesson." He said, rolling his eyes.
Of course, as Dean was a single omega in a dirty bar in a small town, it didn't take too long for a unpleasent situation to happen.
He wouldn't be able to fight on his own.
"Sam didn't tell me, but... you kind of already smell like an omega."
He decided to try another type of question.
He was so absorbed in his own thoughts he didn't even notice Castiel was already knocking on Alisha's door.
At first, Dean thought Gordon was talking about the fact that he couldn't play like most kids could. Or about how Dad kept leaving him and Sammy alone for days.
"Listen here, Gordon, both my sons will grow up to be strong Alphas, they'll be the best hunters around and they're going to make me fucking proud!"
Dad and his friends always used mean words to talk about omegas, Dean has even heard them saying these stuff directly to omegas on the streets. He couldn't understand what they meant, but it just sounded so mean that he was afraid to ask.
But at that moment, Bobby understood that the guy couldn't be trusted to raise these kids.
Dean had never seen his dad so angry, and that's saying something  because John was always angry.
Alisha didn't say it, but they could feel how much Mr. Smith being dead was a relief for her. Lillian talked about her with distaste, but she still wanted Lillian to be happy and free of that man.
As soon as Dean left the house Sam and Castiel were asking him how it went.
"No one would think that you're weak for admitting that you're hurt. " Castiel said, frowning as if he couldn't understand why someone would think such a thing.
"I don't care which are his reasons, what's important is that my children are coming with me." John kept a proud smile on his face. Not that he was actually proud of his son, he was just proud of himself for knowing exactly which buttons to push to get what he wanted. "Dean, please go get your stuff and wake your brother up."
"Hey, you didn't fail me. Maybe dad will get mad at you, but I won't. I don't mind you being an omega" He smiled sweetly. "Everything will be ok, Dean."
And, in fact, a few hours later the three of them, disguised in their FBI suits, were talking to Lillian Smith, the first victim's wife.
"It's okay, Dean. It's okay, you don't need to be fine all the time. You can break down, you can even cry if you want." The angel ran his hands up and down the man's back, trying to comfort him.
Dean always knew he would be an Alpha.
"I'm sorry you had to-" He started to say but got interrupted by Dean.
Omegas... so hysterical all the time.
"You're way too rude, bitch. I bet I could teach to be more omega-like." He said.
"You bet I did. I've seen him striking her across the face. I've heard him screaming at her." The girl told them." I tried to call the police on him, but nothing was done. Tried to convince her to leave him, but she wouldn't."
Dean pressed his lips in a thin line, considered what to do next. She was clearly on a defensive mode, one wrong word could make her stop cooperating.
Slowly, Dean wrapped his own arms around Cas too.
"Listen to me, Sam. I'll punish your brother as I see fit! You're too young to understand what he did, but believe me he deserves everything he'll get"
"No, no no no... This can't be happening! Please, NO!" He begged to no one in particular.
"I'm fine, Sammy." He answered, although he couldn't be farthest away from fine.  He could still smell the heat on himself and he felt disgusting.
He raised an eyebrow at that. It was very clear that she was a traditional omega, now even more so.
"Fuck, oh no...fuck!" Dean said, not being able to complete a single sentence. He had done it, he screwed everything up.
John chuckled.
I love feedback, pleaseeee comment! I love comments, I really do!
That wasn't exactly the reception they were expecting, but they could deal with that.
"I'm good, Cas. It was nothing..."
Then, Dean and a sleepy Sam entered the room.
With that, ignoring Castiel's calls for him, he stormed out of the bunker, got in Baby and started driving away to no place in particular. Just... away.
At that, John smirked gleefully.
WE'LL START DESTIEL FOR REAL NOW.
◇ WARNING: Violence towards a minor ◇
"Okay. What about talking about what happened in that bar, Dean? Can you do that? And more important, do you want to talk about it?" He asked. "If you do, I am always willing to listen."
"I'm just saying, man. He cleans, he cooks, he takes care of the youngest one... You teach him to act like an omega."
He just couldn't stand to see how repressed his big brother really was.
"I'm sure of it, Mrs. Smith." He said. "Now, do you anyone who disliked him? Enough to want him dead?"
"I heard him screaming, but I thought that Lillian had decided to fight back so tried not to look. So that I couldn't rat him out to the police, if something happened to him." She confessed. "But that was foolish of me. It wasn't her."
He knew it when he was nine and he overheard a conversation between Dad and another hunter named Gordon.
Oh, right. Hunting was an even bigger problem.
The first heat of an omega is always the longest and most difficult one, but it was especially hard for Dean. John never told him what he should do if he presented as an omega, so Dean had little knowledge about what was happening to his own body.
"Friends and family of Dean Winchester?"
At that, Sam went to the Impala to pick up his laptop and Cas and Dean crossed the street, quietly. The omega was still thinking of the night before. Of how weak he had allowed himself to be.
Dean always knew he would be an Alpha.
The disdain was clear in her voice. She didn't continue but Dean could almost hear her saying "how you're going to find a mate like that?".
"Good call. Me and Cas will talk to the girl, then."
Please, give me feedback! Love you guys!
Dean always knew he would be an Alpha.
The woman tightened her lips, looking suspicious but nodded anyway, opening the door for Dean to enter while both Alphas stood dumbfounded outside.
And that was what made Dean panic.
So, as painfully obvious it is that Dean is in love, his stubborn self will do nothing about it.
Dean saw the best thing that ever happened to him. He saw someone who was strong and caring. He saw someone who was compassionate, who loved with all of his heart shamelessly. He saw the perfect example of what an Alpha should be.
"It's fine, Sam. You did good, that guy would never listen to me." He said. "Let's just go, ok? I don't want to be here anymore..."
He sat on his bed with tears in his eyes as he slowly understood what was happening with his body.
"But you hated him?" Dean asked.
He paused, waiting to see if Castiel would say something to him, but he just remained quiet and very attentive.
"Huh... I-I guess I could." The man answered, scratching the back of his head in discomfort. "There was this asshole who kept saying that I shouldn't be involved in an investigation, that I should just be getting a knot somewhere else. I answered him and he called me a bitch and started to grab me by the arm..."
"Are you sure you don't just want to get wasted?" Sam asked, in a teasing sound to which Dean just rolled his eyes.
The first monster he killed on his own was a werewolf.
"Yeah, Sammy. Go back to sleep... I just..." He didn't even know what to tell his baby brother. God, he was so fucking ashamed! Dad would tear him a new one when he's back, for sure.
Dean can deal with it.
"No, Cas. That's how the world goes, I should be adjusted to it already. Maybe it's just how things are meant to be for us O's."
"Can I hug you?" The angel asked and Dean simply nodded.
"N-no, Sammy, you absolutely aren't. I guess we should all just go to sleep, right?" Dean said, a bit panicky.
instead, he hugged Cas tightly. He let all emotions out in that hug.
He always made crude comments about his son's status, he always teased Dean for everything and made he work at least twice as hard to prove he could be a good hunter.
"I know you don't wanna hear it, John. But I'm saying this for your own good: keep treating the boy like an omega and I won't be surprised if he turns out to be one" And that was what pushed John over the edge.
He wouldn't make Dad proud.
Cas approached him slightly, with a frown on his face. Dean tried not to stop eye contact but it was hard when just looking at those bright blue orbs made him want to scream "screw it!" to everything he knew about himself and dive right in.
She flinched hard at the question.  For a moment, She just stood there looking surprised at how fast he guessed what went on in her house.
"We've got a case, bro." Sam said, putting the newspaper on the table for his brother to read. "mysterious deaths in a small town nearby. By the witness' statement, it sounds like a ghost case."
However, he didn't want to upset Bobby after everything the man did for him and his brother. He knew Bobby just wanted what was best for them.
Sometimes he forgot how humans could be worse than monsters.
"Yeah, man, I'm sure."
Dean was getting more and more frustrated. How could Cas not see it? Not understand how Dean should be completely used to that by now? How he should have been capable to ignore it?
Dean felt his cheek color in embarrassment. He hated this, he hated the way people talked about him as if he was worthless.
If you ask Dean, he'd say the worst beating was that first one, after he presented.
"You know why, Sammy..." Dean said, clearly becoming embarrassed. He hated talking about these stuff; both his omega issues and his love life.
John was clearly getting more irritated, looking ready for a fight.
Growing up as a hunter was hard, but being an omega hunter was even harder.
Then, the man focused his attention on Dean again.
Castiel seemed confused, but let it go, for now at least.
Castiel wrapped his arms so tightly around Dean that he felt like he could barely breath, but he had never felt as safe as he did at that moment.
John started drinking even more and getting even more angry at everything and anything. He just couldn't forgive his son for being an omega.
"Just forget about it, Sammy." He said. "You know what I think about all of this and you can't change my mind."
He couldn't believe he got this close to kiss Cas. The last thing he needed was to reveal his feelings to him, he couldn't do that to himself or to Cas.
"Sure, let me just get Cas."
He made it in 45 minutes.
He made a promise to himself that he'd never be that weak again and he will not break it.
Time kept passing, some things changed, others didn't. They made some friends and lost others. They kept hunting, kept fighting and killing monsters.
Well, that guy was the devil himself and Dean didn't feel sorry for him. Unfortunately, bad people or not, there was still a ghost killing people and Dean still had a job to do.
Lillian, an omega, opened the door with a sceptical look on her face.
He wanted to be angry at her tone, but the truth is that she was just someone even more broken as he was.
With gritted teeth she replied:
"No, too brainwashed for that. She really believes her husband was a good man." Dean explained. "But she seemed to think one of her neighbors might have hated him enough to kill him."
