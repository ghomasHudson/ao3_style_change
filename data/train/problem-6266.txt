Steve frowned and looked down at his hands, opening and closing them. “Just getting started.”
The redhead rolled her eyes but gave him a soft smile. “I’m glad you’re home and okay. Where were you though?” She looked over at Steve again. “Vegas?”
Steve spread his arms and looked around. Looked at Tony. “In case you haven’t noticed, you’ve landed into some very dangerous waters.”
Tony laughed and looked straight out his front windshield. “Yeah no. Have you forgotten the part where I said you keep running away from me?”
Steve shook his head. “And how do you figure?”
“So I spoke with Natasha and Bucky. We’re in agreement that we need to bring in Thor, Clint and Sam as well.”
He smiled easily. “Show me what you’ve got, Rogers.”
Steve spent three days scrambling for answers about an organization he had no knowledge of and planning an escape he was only 12% sure would work. Three days before the sound of bullets hitting metal and flesh shook him from his meditative daze. Three days and the first sight Steve had seen other than men with bad breath and even worst attitudes was a woman standing tall, a gun at her side, victory curls in her hair, and a very British accent.
Tony’s play at being offended was belied by the fact that he couldn’t keep a grin off his face. “That really hurts, Sourpatch.” He leaned towards Pepper and clutched at her arm. “Potts, tell Rhodey that was rude.”
“What? Pffft no. Of course not.” He carefully tore the sheet from his book and held it out for Tony to take. Tony shook his head and lifted his hands.
Steve glanced up at her and smiled a little. “Good. I mean that he’s happy.” He sighed and then picked up his phone. “I’m going to order the pizza.”
“I’ve got money, a phone, a bike...or a car. I think you had a pretty kick ass motorcycle so I have one you can have.”
Tony’s eyes were shut again but he was smiling. “Yeah.” His voice was soft, quiet, but he was laughing. “We really really are.”
“But I didn’t. I’m here and we’re going to wake up on Christmas morning and open presents and do all the silly things that families are supposed to do and then if you’re okay with it and I’ve stopped shivering by then I’m going to take you to bed and give you a very special, private Christmas present of your own.”
*****
“Yes. It is my call. And you’ll do well to remember that.”
HYDRA hadn’t even had Tony for a day this time around, but they were unmerciful. His head was once again bleeding sluggishly, bruises lining his features, painted on almost every inch of skin showing—Steve didn’t even want to think about the bruising that must be under his clothing. A couple of his fingers were bloody and bending at odd angles and Steve squeezed his eyes shut before tucking that hand against Tony’s chest and covering it lightly with his own.
Steve didn’t want to know that story either. Well that was a lie. Actually he did.
Steve gave up on telling Tony to stop calling him that. Tony told him it was just his own way of showing affection. “Better.”
It had all started one day with Steve. Someone had taken an aerial shot and it was in the newspapers the very next day with the caption “Captain America takes time from hero-ing to help clean up one of the many messes throughout the city.”
Tony laughed, a slight bounce in his step as he trailed along next to Steve, hand squeezing firmly. “I want that recorded. First thing when we get home--- er, after I fix your bike.”
Bucky waved at him dismissively. “Yeah. Sure. Sure. Just give me fifteen more minutes, mom.”
Tony stopped what he was doing and sighed. This was going to mess up his record. "I hadn't noticed. Thanks. Glad we had this talk."
The door opened quickly and a startled Tony nearly fell from Steve’s lap.
Steve was blushing a little bit but when Tony looked over at him he was smiling. Tony smiled back at least and cleared his throat.
Steve was silent for a few moments. “What if I was the one that made a mistake? It can go both ways but I want us. You. Don’t you think it’s worth a try? We could end up being the greatest thing that ever happened to either of us.”
“Heart condition. Look it up.”
“Are you ready?” Steve asked as he liberally covered a finger in lube and Tony could only nod, his throat too dry to form any words. Steve just smiled and scooted back slightly, his hand sliding back between Tony’s legs. The brunet reached for a pillow to place under his hips as Steve’s finger traced around his hole once more, kissing Tony’s thigh as he gently nudged in a finger. Tony grunted and Steve looked up.
Tony eventually pulled away to catch his breath, a look of discomfort flitting across his face and then it was gone a split second later. “How do you feel about a New Years wedding?”
“I can take care of myself.”
His last words, drowning between choking and gasping for air, were a fierce declaration of. “Hail Hydra.”
“Don’t blame yourself, Steve. It happened too fast. And besides, I could have just as easily been alone and the result would have been the same.”
Steve covered his mouth with his palm to hide the smile that broke out on his face at both the teasing and the wounded look Tony shot at both his friends.
Steve was blushing. Again. Good grief. “You’re welcome.” He ducked his head and then placed his sketchbook back in the safety of his school bag. He heard Tony stand up to collect his own things before leaving and looked up just as the brunet was walking towards him, holding out a slip of paper.
Everyone nodded and Steve’s foot fell on the pedal just that much harder.
Steve eyed Tony briefly when he’d made himself comfortable, looking for any sign that Tony wasn’t absolutely sure about involving his friends in this past the point they already were. When he received nothing but a shrug, that seemed to say ‘this is out of my hands’, in return he turned his attention to Pepper and Rhodey.
*****
Tony hummed as he examined the sweater. “Well that’s not the way Starks celebrated. Besides, everyone in my family died when I was 17.”
Steve placed the robodog on the counter and reached up to cup Tony’s face with both hands, thumbs gently stroking over his cheekbones. He pulled Tony’s face closer to his and the genius actually moaned, hands flying up to Steve’s shoulders as he deepened the kiss.
“It’s not good. We’re almost to Bruce now, Steve. Just get here as soon as possible.”
When Natasha didn’t answer right away Steve started to sprint, taking turns blindly as he searched for an exit. “Nat, how bad is it?”
Steve crossed his arms over his chest and quietly positioned himself against the wall. Yeah he was most definitely over their silly fight.
“Your romantic gestures are going to be the death of me, I just know it.”
Steve shook his head. He started after around the corner Pepper and Obie had disappeared behind, made it about ten steps before footsteps came thudding after him.
Obies eyes were wide, his mouth held open, speechless. “Tony!” he finally settled on, backing away from Pepper. “You’re alive.”
“It was you, wasn’t it? The accident on the bridge, it wasn’t an accident.”
“Living dangerously then. If you don’t make me best man then I won’t speak to you for at least six months.”
“Let’s go! Come on! I’m ready!” Peter insisted, running toward the door to the garage.
You’re still here and that means more to me than I’ll ever verbally admit. To anyone. Probably even you.
Pepper gripped Tony’s hand as Rhodey’s hand squeezed Tony’s shoulder. “We expect him back in one piece, Captain. Don’t make us regret leaving him in your care for the time being.”
“He’s learning fast, really hoping to pass you in rank. I always say, goals:  Gotta have ‘em. Now let’s go.”
Tony was sitting in the kitchen, sipping at some coffee at 11:30 at night because why not? It wasn’t long before the very person that took up the majority of space in Tony’s mind took a seat next to him at the table. Steve’s hand immediately went to the back of Tony’s neck and began massaging it gently.
“Yep.”
“Oh, thank fuck. It’s about damn time,” Clint snarked, drawing closer to them both. “About you being alive and about you kissing. Mostly about you kissing. We were just a few weeks from trying to parent trap you both, I hope you know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m coming back. Okay? It’s not a forever deal. With me leaving I mean. You have things you’re trying to sort out too. What happened the other day wasn’t good for either of us. I think we both have a lot of head clearing to do.”
“It appears that there is an element of memory loss occurring as a result of magic.”
Tony mock scowled at Steve. “Sergeant Major Nuts-N-Bolts is not a punishment. Why would you say that? You’re going to break his circuit board. He loves you already, Captain.”
Tony furrowed his brow. “Well, okay, Mr. Mine Mine Mine. You don’t have to. I guess. You should at least let me improve it. I can teach it how to do more tricks. I can program it to respond to only you. I can probably make him more cuddly too.”
Tony looked at Pepper and gave an apologetic shrug.
“We’re playing video games later.”
“That is a damn dirty lie, Rogers.” Tony took another breath. “I hate myself for not knowing. I should have known. Something should have told me. I was clueless though. And I hate that. I hate it so much because I thought it was you and it wasn’t.”
As it turned out, genies can eat a lot. Steve might have been enjoying the sweet and sour chicken a little too much but the genius thought it was funny. And maybe a little cute. Not that he was going to say that. Besides, Pepper couldn't keep her eyes off him either which was making their conversation more difficult to have.
Pepper just stared at him and waited for almost ten seconds before sighing. “You...tripped over him?”
Tony made his way to the sink while Steve cleaned, standing behind the blond and wrapped his arms around his waist. “These can wait.” He moved his hand down to Steve’s groin and gave a small squeeze. “This cannot.”
Tony smiled with relief. “I hope we’re able to make it work.”
“But, Steve, we were…”
Tony nodded and relaxed as Bruce got to work.
“That’s silly. Why do you think you’d lose me as a friend?”
“You guys know I’m not an actual medical doctor, right?”
Steve rolled his eyes but it was obvious he was more flattered than anything. He quickly added that one last detail. Tony took it and held onto it carefully as if it was the most precious thing he’d ever held in his hands.
“How do I turn you off?” Steve muttered, scowling down at the bot. “You’re being obnoxious.”
This was not good. Tony knew himself and he knew that all it would take is one slip for him to destroy the friendship he’d developed with the super soldier. It was enough because Steve Rogers saw past the bullshit and still wanted to be friends with him anyway.
“My home? Stark Tower.”
Steve shut his eyes as another voice filled his head.
“Amazing?” That was Morita.
“That was so hot, Steve,” Tony says with a low, rough voice, straining to brace some of Steve’s weight against him. He’s so hard himself that he’s definitely ready to go home. “We’re leaving the vibrator in and on at full speed and you’re going to fuck me into the mattress the moment we get to our bedroom. I won’t be turning it off after the first time you come though, so you think you can handle that?”
Steve opened his mouth again. “You told the coffee maker you were going to destroy it.”
Steve did stop and turned around. “What?”
“Why have you been avoiding me, Tony?”
“Just accept the damn compliment, Tony, because it’s true.”
“Yes. Of course I am.” He ruffled Steve’s hair. “Did the movie get boring?”
The brunet shrugged. “That’s pretty much all there is to know about me. When I’m not doing this I’m playing the piano at home and writing my own sheet music. I graduated from Juilliard with a Master of Music degree. In case it isn’t clear, the piano is more or less what my life revolves around.”
When the silence got to go on a bit too long, Tony’s doubts and fears trying to make a valiant return, he cleared his throat and pointed at the papers littering the table that he’d only just noticed. “Uh, what’s all this?”
Of course Steve was able to rationalize the feelings of a coffee maker. Tony should never have installed an AI in it. He regretted a lot of his decisions to put AI into his toys.
“You say that every time, and you still end up telling me because you can’t keep it quiet.”
“Well, I’ll be the death of you so sort of means you plan on spending the rest of your life with me.”
“What you’ve done for Bucky, it’s really been great. He’s a completely different person and you didn’t have to do that and I wanted to say thank you,” he said rather quickly.
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Nice save, bro. This is why you’re not my favorite.”
“Whatever. I wish I had a drink right now,” the genius grumbled.
The team waited in silence and Fury opened the door for Maria Hill to enter. She was holding the hand of a child. A small child with shaggy brown hair and a look of utter boredom. He couldn’t have been more than five.
Natasha lifted an eyebrow while Clint rubbed his arm where Natasha had pinched him.
Steve winked at Peter.
They’d gone down this road frequently and they always fought afterwards. They always fought anyway, but those intimate moments hadn’t helped much. They were good. Always good. Tony never wanted to let it be known that he was the one who wanted more from Steve though. He knew what he was and where he stood, but he’d stopped trying to deny to himself that Steve had stopped being a booty call for him and had become someone he craved and someone he wanted to wake up with every morning. He wasn’t sure Steve even really liked him all that much but he was going to take what he could get as long as he could.
“Pfft,” Tony rolled his eyes. “Why would I not be okay?”
Steve rubbed at his face with his hand, trying to futilely block the flush he felt heating up along his cheeks. It didn’t help when he heard Tony mutter ‘I wish” under his breath.
Steve blinked himself out of his thoughts and turned his head in the direction his friend Bucky had pointed. He wiped his sweaty palms on his pants. No one wanted their first handshake with a woman to involve sweaty hands, and Steve always froze up in the company of women. They all intimidated him. He might look like an All-American jock, but the truth was that Steve was a shy arts student who was sometimes part of a popular grunge band, but those were almost two different lives for him. He didn’t prefer one over the other, but when he donned his grunge look he preferred to do it for an audience. Alone he just wanted to be Steve Rogers, starving artist.
Natasha snorted, and murmured so softly Steve was sure only he’d be able to pick it up. “I can’t hear you”.
“Or Iron Man,” Steve mused.
Steve rolled to his feet just in time to block a punch sailing towards his face but not so lucky to stop the next one that landed right on his ribs. Steve doubled over involuntarily only to be kneed in the face.
Steve nodded. “Okay...sure.”
Dear Steve,
“So you think that because I am rich that I have it so easy?” Tony’s eyes were wide and his mouth was gaping. He was so offended and couldn’t even come up with a quick enough retort.
Natasha at least attempted to be sympathetic. “Just so you know, we’re really happy that you have found someone. Tony’s never been this happy in the entire amount of time that I’ve known him.”
“Sorry. I think I figured out where the problem is though.”
Steve gave him a quick nod, his breathing labored as he spoke. Of all the times they’d had sex, they had never once done it face to face. Perhaps it was too intimate. Neither was sure where he stood with the other and Steve had a feeling this was probably going to change everything because they were literally going to have to face what it was they wanted. No time for anonymity. They were cold, alone and this was the moment they’d have to finally admit to themselves what their true feelings were. The thing that kept them from discussing it to this point had, in fact, been a combination of a fear of rejection or realizing that they were nothing more than a good lay and a warm body to occupy one of their beds at night.
“Does it hurt too much?”
“Is that going to be a problem, Stark?”
Steve gave his friend a confused look. “Who?”
“I’m a billionaire. Making wishes is almost selfish at this point.”
“Yeah. Same. Steve?”
“I am J.A.R.V.I.S. Master Stark’s artificial intelligence and guardian of his residence.”
Clint spoke up. “Has he been compromised?”
Steve grinned softly. “I hope not. We’ll see how you feel after you eat though.”
“None of that, Mr Grouchy Pants. It’s something I can fix in a matter of hours. Hopefully you guys have no, ah hm, business, to take care of before dinner.”
Tony straightened his posture a bit and looked the genie right in the eyes. Even his eyes were blue. Blond hair, blue eyes. Figures.
Steve laughed and kissed Tony’s forehead. “I think we have somewhere to be soon.”
Steve paused at the doors threshold, back to Tony. “You know how you could be part of my team? By following my damn orders like everyone else does.”
Steve shook his head. He didn’t know. He couldn’t remember at all.
Tony snorted. “Dad, I told you my friend Steve was coming over.”
Steve gave Tony a puzzled look. “Should I?”
“There are a lot of things I wish I could change about my past. One of my captors called me the greatest mass murderer in US History. Or something like that. I mostly just remember the greatest mass murderer part. My weapons killed so many innocent people and I will live with that guilt for the rest of my life. But, as my stupid therapist has told me, we learn from the guilt and it makes us stronger. Your mind is on complete overload considering you’re trying to shove 70 years worth of information into that brain of yours, so it makes sense you’d still be beating yourself up over this, but we all have guilt and we all hate ourselves and we take care of each other. You hearing me?”
"You better not let this affect your work on the field."
Tony’s window went down and he popped his head out. “We need to talk.”
“You look cheerful. What’s going on?”
The brunet smiled. “Yeah. That’s...hi, I’m Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries,” he held out his hand.
Steve threw a napkin at Tony and laughed. “I drew a lot. Paced. Invented my own worlds.”
He knew Bucky was in there though. Somewhere. Steve had caught glimpses, brief glimpses in the way Bucky would scowl at him or roll his eyes. The blond tried to tell himself it was good he was able to annoy Bucky enough to warrant said scowl and eye roll, even if their conversation had been nothing he’d felt good about. This had been their worst encounter with each other yet that didn’t include much violence. He’d had to restrain the winter soldier a few times, but the harder he tried the more he felt like he was going to lose Bucky forever. Again.
The blond was shivering despite the amount of heat he was putting out and Tony wrapped his arms and the blankets as tightly around the both of them as he could. “Can we agree to never accept a mission in this country in the dead of winter ever again?”
Tony then presses two fingers against the base of the vibrator and lightly pushes on it several times, enjoying the way Steve nearly doubles over.
“Yeah. It’s just that everyone else I knew from before did.”
She’d untied his wrist with a flick of her knife, grabbed his hand tight, and said very firmly, ‘keep up’, and he had. They’d ran and ducked and hid behind corners until a car pulled up fast around the corner and the lady, who later identified herself as Peggy Carter, shoved him in the backseat and shouted at the driver to ‘bloody drive!’.
Tony took a step back from Steve. “Don’t you think I know that? Don’t you think I’ve been thinking about that since I was old enough to understand what kind of life I’m having? I have to make all sorts of sacrifices just so I can pursue my passion!”
Natasha returned his iPod to him and nodded her head forward to let him know his answer was on the screen.
He started with the bottom and worked his way up. Blue pointy shoes. Blue genie pants. Blue genie bra. Blue genie vest. Blue genie hat with a blue veil thing on it.
Steve clasped Tony’s hand when the billionaire grabbed it as he shut the door. “Peter’s going to be wired when I get home. Natasha never listens to what I say and I don’t argue because she looks like someone who could easily kill a man.”
Tony just shook his head, responding breathlessly. “No. No it’s fine. Don’t stop.”
Tony smiled up at Steve and playfully nipped at his bottom lip. “I’ve been waiting for my present all night long, Steve. Don’t you want to give it to me yet?”
“Steve. You--wait you’re in love with me?”
Steve entered Tony’s bedroom after he and the others cleaned the kitchen. Tony had been ordered to the bed and told he could get out of cleaning this once since he supplied them with the meal. He mostly figured they could tell he was exhausted. So here he was, sitting on his bed with his tablet in his hand once more.
Steve sighed and shook his head. “I don’t know. I need to leave though. For awhile.”
“And here’s where things start to get a little tricky, Pepper.”
Tony stayed quiet as the doctor did his work. Steve was still holding onto his hand and it felt nice. Once he was finished and left the room, the genius turned his head to look at Steve who had that same miserable, guilty look.
And it was at that moment that Loki suddenly appeared in front of them. Natasha stood up straight and glowered at him. Bruce and Clint found themselves easing toward the path that existed between Loki and Tony at the moment. Steve clenched his jaw.
“Nu-uh, this doesn’t get you out of getting us actual Christmas presents when the time comes,” Clint said, voice muffled by the shirt he was wrestling over his head.
“Thanks, Bucky, but I think I’ll keep it to myself.”
Tony looked like he was about to protest even further, but he dropped his shoulders and turned. “You’ll have your weapons and armor soon. I have work to do. See you around, Rogers.”
Tony wraps arms around Steve’s neck and presses a leg between the soldier’s, thigh pressing right up against Steve’s crotch. He starts dancing slowly to the beat, leg moving against Steve’s cock. Steve’s arms wrap around Tony’s waist, helping him achieve that desired friction he so desperately needs before Tony turns the vibrator onto its highest setting and Steve nearly falls over.
Steve stayed silent.
Tony’s grin faltered. “Who said I’ll still be around when this is all said and done?” Tony muttered. “I’m not exactly a part of this whole—mob family you’ve got going on. I don’t play a part here.”
“Don’t be rude, Tony. They seem nice. Where did you get them?”
“Can you tap into my comm, JARVIS?” Steve asked quietly.
“You won’t find anything here, you know,” the man said lightly, pushing his round wire framed glasses further up his nose. “Once I heard all the commotion, I set all databases to self destruct mode. Though, judging from that conversation you were having, it wasn’t information you came looking for.”
Tony was silent for almost ten seconds. “I never said I hated you, Steve. I can’t tell if you asked me to come with you as a way to punish me for something or if you wanted Iron Man to have your back, which sadly enough, doesn’t seem to be an option considering the state of my suit at the moment.”
“You’re being corny right now.”
Steve sighed and kept reading; it was just his luck that’d he’d set aside work for more work, though it was satisfying to know that he and his people were still ahead of the media which, okay, wasn't too hard when one of the largest New York newspapers, the Daily Bugle, was run by J. Jonah Jameson, notorious for publishing articles that tended to focus more on pop culture figures than really hard hitting journalism.
“I know! Fuck, I know that! I understand that. I want to help him. I want him to remember me and I want him to know that I’m here and that I’ll always be here but I can’t if he refuses to let me. I can’t bring him back if he keeps running away.”
*****
The smile fell from the child’s face and he tilted his head thoughtfully. “My dad keeps saying that you’re dead, but maybe if I tell him I found you he’ll be proud.”
Steve found his footing and floated back down to the ground. “I don’t remember signing up for this,” he muttered when Tony was in the shower.
Steve chuckled a little. “Guess Clint was right.”
“So says the man who doesn’t have to pay rent to live in a place like this,” Tony responded with a smile, mostly to show that he wasn’t holding it against any of them.
“Well this has been a rather anti-climactic night, don’t you think, boy?”
Steve closed the door behind him and reactivated the security settings. “It serves several purposes. Nat and Bucky come here on occasion, just to get away. As do the others in their own time. Tight security, away from everything happening back home but close enough to show up if the call comes in; it’s a safe place.”
Natasha shrugged. “He’s actually kind of a narcissist but overall harmless. He’s a certified genius though so maybe it’s hard for him to be modest when he knows he’s better at something than most people will ever be. He’s also still young and on top of the world right now.”
Tony cut his eyes toward Steve’s friend. “If you were smart, you’d never need to be reminded in the first place, Barnes. My lateness was in the name of science, so bite me.”
“I’m sitting right here,” Steve reminded them.
Bucky held his hands up in surrender and shook his head. “I’m just saying. If that’s who was making you smile earlier then I say go for it, but you can’t tell me it’s nothing because you get this look on your face when you like someone and you were wearing that look when you were on your phone.”
The blond clapped, biting his bottom lip and still smiling. “Well that was,” he coughed and looked down shyly. “Once again that was amazing. Which you already know.”
“Brother Steve! I hear there is much need for assistance once again. I am saddened to see that our efforts to protect this fair city cause so much damage at the same time.”
Steve looked up. “Hmm?”
He follows Tony when the genius leads him towards the dance floor, knowing anyone who looked closely at him would know something was up. Tony doesn’t take them right to the middle, but he doesn’t place them on the fringe of the crowd either. Tony wants them to be able to make a swift exit if need be.
“Because he’s not,” Tony added somewhat softly.
“Romanoff, Barnes, Barton and Banner you’ve already at least met once or twice.” Steve jerked his head towards a bigger blond. “This is Thor,” and then pointed at a dark skinned, smiling man who had a falcon of all creatures resting on his shoulders, “and this is Sam Wilson.” They’ll be working with Bucky to gather intel on the warehouse you were kept in. Any and all information you have on where you were kept should be noted and passed on to these three. Romanoff and Barton will handle gathering information on Stane and his connection with HYDRA and Schmidt.”
Steve was thinking of Tony and wondering if Tony would remember him...or even recognize him. He was sort of hoping so because he had been nothing if not intrigued by the guy after their brief initial meeting. He tried to tell himself he felt bad for intruding on what he had assumed was a private session, but he found himself hoping for an encore.
“Morning all. I’d love to stay and chat but I have work to return to.”
Steve spit out the coke he was drinking. “Wh-what?” He was now doing the blushing thing. “I don’t...what?”
“Why are you doing this? What for?”
“As you wish, sir.”
When he didn’t say anything Steve lifted his head. “Tony? What’s bothering you?”
The groan he got from Steve was rewarding in every way possible. Steve had to use both hands to pull Tony’s face away from his chest so he could kiss him, his tongue sliding against Tony’s twisting with it. He took that moment to undo Tony’s pants, pushing them down as far as he could while his mouth was still on Tony’s. Tony clumsily stepped from his pants and broke the kiss so he could pull his own shirt off.
That caught Tony by surprise. “What do you mean by that?”
“Steve, I…”
“Did I what?”
“Well I did propose to him.”
Tony paced back and forth, much to the growing annoyance of both Steve and Bruce. It was one of a small handful of nervous ticks that Tony apparently had, come out to play as they waited for their first update from Romanoff and Barton’s work undercover in Stark Industries.
“Are you trying to get me to stop liking you?”
“I’ve been doing more research into arc reactor technology. Do you know what a power source like that is capable of doing? Well aside from being extremely destructive in the wrong hands? It can be used as a clean energy source. It can be used for so much and it doesn’t have to be weapons.”
“Why come to us?”
“I heard. “ He smiled. “Did Natasha enjoy it?”
You’re more than a product of Howard’s genes though. You are a giant, Tony Stark. You stand out from the rest because you made sure everyone noticed you. You changed yourself, made yourself, and above all, you always try to do the right thing. There was no way you could have ever been like me. The world was always waiting for someone like you.
*****
Steve laughed at the kid’s enthusiasm.
“I’ve also been instructed to remind you that if you do not speak to the captain at your earliest possible convenience then, and I quote, ‘there will be hell to pay, Tony.’”
Except for Thor for obvious reasons.
He should leave. He really should. Steve really did try to think of how he would feel if someone was watching him draw while he wasn’t aware of it. It felt invasive. He’d been there before and he wasn’t prepared, wasn’t ready for anyone to see what he was doing. Not yet. He knew he should respect this guy’s privacy, but he could not pull himself away.
Natasha took a seat next to him and let her head rest on his shoulder. “We have your back, Steve. You know that. Tony more than anyone. You guys will work it out and until then, Tony will still support you as a friend no matter what.”
Steve was surprised later that night when the bot found him again, chirping excitedly as it zoomed around his legs, and periodically into his legs. He was even more surprised that he didn’t mind the company the bot provided even if it did follow him everywhere. LIterally everywhere.
Tony needed to file that away for later. It wasn’t a good time to let his emotions get the better of him. “Is that what you’re going to do to me too?”
Tony stood up then, a yawn he’d been suppressing finally forcing its way out. “Well that’s my cue. Night.” And he walked out without another word.
“This isn’t how I wanted Christmas to go.”
Another look flickered across Steve’s face. “I know that name. Stark. It struck me the first time you said it. I don’t know why I know it though.”
Tony watched his friend as he conversed with his boyfriend. He had forgotten to tell Rhodey that he might be sleeping with Captain America, but now that he was here, he was sure he was doomed to get a lecture from Rhodey.
“Steve! Hey!”
“Did you send him a picture of your abs or something? Maybe he can be the new me.”
“Uh…” Steve tried to interrupt but was cut off by the bickering duo.
“Pierce is here,” Bucky said quietly. Steve clenched his fist at his side; he was well aware of Alexander Pierce’s involvement in what happened to Bucky after the war, of the cruelness held by that man. He’d been like a ghost since Bucky’s escape, no trace left of him anywhere except for now, here today. Steve should be out there, Steve needed to be in here. He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and took a steadying breath. Bucky’s breathing became heavy, “Should I—shit!” Gunshots echoed over the comm.
“Is this a mob or a spy agency?” Tony asked, genuinely confused.
“About?”
Steve gently pulled Tony away from him. “Why do you keep saying that your dad likes me so much?”
Steve shook his head. “I was worried about you.”
“You have expressed trouble when the loss of life has been brought up in the past,” Steve responded. He folded his hands on the table. “I need to make sure you know what’s going to happen and agree to help without making trouble.”
He was smiling like the big goofball everyone told him he was. He knew it. Whoever this guy was, he was talented. He could carry a tune, he was singing and not many people he’d known could pull off Frank Sinatra so well. He tried, he did, but there was a reason he wasn’t lead vocals. Steve could sing. He could sing well, but it wasn’t where he was strongest. This guy could probably be singing lead vocals if he really wanted to. Steve wanted to ask him so many questions already and he knew nothing of this person at all except he was part of The Avengers.
Tony could see that Bruce wanted to argue with that because Tony was only 25 years old. Yes, he was the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company, a certified genius, a holder of several impressive degrees, a brilliant and innovative creator and had the emotional baggage of someone more suited to be in their 40s at least, but the way he looked at the world sometimes, full of hope and naivety and grandeur, further emphasized how very young he actually was. They were all things Bruce had said to him before in some way or another.
Steve gives a barely perceptible nod and Tony can see he’s pretty far gone.
“Funny enough, that’s now how I see it, but you seem to forget that I can match you in the game of stubborn assholes.”
More gunshots came through followed by the sound of shattering glass.
The groan that escaped Steve’s lips was beautiful and Tony smiled.
“You’re walking. Quit trying to get out of it.”
Steve considered this for a moment while Tony walked with him to the nurse’s office. “Sure?”
“Call me Tony at least.”
“Nothing a hoodie, a baseball cap and a pair of tinted sunglasses can’t fix.”
He loved his teammates so much. He was so happy to have them in his life no matter how nosey they were, but they didn’t question him about his trip once and he relaxed for the first time in over a month. They were his family now.
“Yeah, but not if you just accounted for the added—“
“What? Boy, this isn’t my fault,” Obie tried again, stepping closer with his hands up. “Pepper was stealing secrets from us and trying to sell them. She has them on a thumb drive—“
It took awhile for both of them to finally come down from their high, passing the time with lazy kisses. Tony’s hands were roaming all over Steve’s chest. This was obviously heaven or Tony was being rewarded for something. It’s not like people like Steve were standing on every corner waiting for someone to snatch them up. Tony wasn’t surprised to learn that Steve’s feelings were mutual because they’d been doing their bizarre little dance for awhile now, but he was surprised someone like Steve could want someone like him.
Pepper reached out and covered Tony’s hand with hers, squeezing tight. Rhodey looked murderous, hands balled up just under the table.
“I know exactly what I’m doing, Obie,” Tony lied. So what if he was still trying to figure it all out, trying to cycle through every option he had. Growing up he’d wanted to be like Obie, had modeled himself off of the man, but now, now he wanted to be nothing like him. He didn’t want to become the man who would kick someone when they were already down, who would take advantage of a weak point when they were already in the lead.
Steve leans his head back until it’s against Tony’s and whimpers. “God, yes,” he moans, placing a hand over the one Tony has on his clothed cock and presses it even harder against the hardness. “Please,” he begs.
Steve shot a glare at Bucky but it was only half-hearted. “A friend.”
“What? Not me!”
Everyone gave him a blank stare.
Steve grinned. “That actually doesn’t surprise me.”
“I can be overbearing and a real asshole sometimes.”
Nuts-N-Bolts kept nipping at Steve even as he backed up, tiny claws clacking together when he missed. “Steve is a jerk,” he chanted in his high little voice.
Bucky looked over at Steve, a smirk on his lips. “When you were selling me on this whole mob lifestyle you didn’t mention going up against a buncha evil scientists in green suits.”
Tony brings out the camera later in bed, just to get some practice.
Tony looked up then, worried, and Steve was crying silently. “I woke up and everyone was just gone, Tony. I missed out on their lives. I just wanted to reassure myself that I could have a normal Christmas and that…”
The fighting felt endless, drawn out until Steve felt almost numb to any pain, until he was bruised and bloody and his breath came in gasps. It was almost a physical relief when Skull’s next hit threw him close enough to his gun that he was able to grab it and fire, two shots, one in the leg and the other one landing somewhere between his shoulder and his chest.
“Yeah yeah.” He let go of Steve and gave him a small shove out of the way to go check up on the other band members.
“Hello, Steve,” came the robotic voice, low and menacing yet still carrying that robotic edge. “Would you like to play a game?” Steve stared down at it, eyes wide until the creature’s metal eyebrows began to waggle and its voice went back to its high pitched chirp as it zoomed its way around his legs.
“Why would JARVIS, never mind. You know he’s not actually a dog, right? You still can’t get him a leash.”
Tony shook his head. “No. It’s still not. This was all Steve’s idea, bringing you guys here. Which…” Tony looked at Steve, a little bit confused, but mostly happy. “Not that I’m complaining, but how exactly did you guys get here anyway?”
Steve beamed. “Thanks, Tony!”
“I have yet to find something about you that I don’t like,” Steve responded honestly. Tony was surprised by the utterly earnest look on Steve’s face when he said that.
Bucky pulled his shirt over his head with a slight frown. “You help with my arm.”
“Master Tony.”
“Okay, so if you fought over something stupid, then why aren’t you doing something about it instead of sitting around doing nothing?”
“Because he doesn’t want to talk to me?”
Steve was silent for a moment as he processed what he’d just heard and his eyes turned to look over at Tony who seemed to look away from the soldier quickly, almost as if he were too embarrassed to look at the soldier. Steve frowned.
“Tony, tell me about this Iron Man gig Steve mentioned. What performances?”
“Tony, I’m so--.”
“Thanks, Steve,” Happy responded. “Tony was a real pain in the ass…”
“Pepper and Rhodey. Uh...Virginia Potts and Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes. The two people I trust most in this world. I need to let them know I’m okay.”
When he finished eating, he folded up his paper and stood to walk his plate to the sink where he could rinse it off, mind suddenly not on the elections that were just around the corner but instead on Bucky and his arm that had been giving his trouble as of late. He could tell every time they talked lately that it was causing him pain in the way that Bucky would twitch the fingers on his flesh hand towards the metal one as if he wanted to grip it to stave off whatever was hurting him. A state of the art prosthetic apparently came with a price, but Bucky still insisted that it was worth it just to have the full range, plus some, mobility that a normal prosthetic limb just couldn’t provide.
Ironically enough, meeting you made me hate myself a little less. I mean come on, it’s not like I’ll ever stop doing that, but realizing how perfectly imperfect you are was a breath of fresh air. I’ve gotten to know the real you. I mean, I suppose I’ll always be a little pissed off that even at my most perfect (I mean look at me, no wait don’t because this is you I’m talking to) I was still never able to measure up to you.
“Don’t worry. You’ll learn one day.”
“Right. Maybe it’s a previous genie encounter?”
Steve wasn’t listening though. His eyes were unfocused and he looked like he was in a completely different place.
“I—“ Tony swallowed hard again, shook his head as if to clear it. He folded the drive in his fist and  focused his eyes on some point over Natasha’s head. “What’s on the drive?”
Tony grumbled as he sluggishly walked away, flipping Steve a lazy bird the whole way.
“Information on you. What kind of work do I do for you? My involvement in your affairs. Build us this weapon or we will kill you. Tell us where to find the Howling Commandos or we will kill you. Lot’s of death threats being thrown around.”
Steve looked up, confused. “What?”
That caused Tony to chuckle. “I’ll keep that in mind.” He picked up his tablet, and stared at the schematics for Bucky’s arm as he worked out where to dive in. “You want me to knock you out? Then you don’t have to worry about getting bored. And really, I remember how much you whined when we were first doing this, I could do without it this time around.”
Steve replied before he was able to stop yourself. “Because you’re incredible. You’re the most amazing person I’ve ever met. I--I mean, why wouldn’t I?” He was blushing and had to look in the other direction.
Natasha smiled. "Glad we had this talk. You're a good man, Stark."
Steve took a moment to register that. “Oh, the guy they were just talking about on the television?”
“Why are you always so god damn ungrateful? I’ve given you everything you have ever wanted in life. The best schools. Piano lessons ever since you were a toddler. I told you that whatever you do, please make sure you keep the integrity of our name intact. Instead I find out you’re part of a rock band that takes away from the time you actually need to practice.”
Once all the children were seated, Mister Steve smiled and Tony sighed. This just wasn’t fair. Maybe he was going to be a lame storyteller and maybe he was a jerk because really, he was far too attractive to be a really good person as well.
“So this was…”
“And thank you for tuning in, Mr Rogers.”
And he was off again before Steve could even finish saying “Tony, wait!”
“That’d be spoiling the surprise. Do you listen to anyone that isn’t you?”
The blond just huffed. “I don’t think it’s going to ruin anything. I just said that I feel the same way.”
Steve began laughing. “I was kidding. Anyway, come join us.”
Steve looked down at his work spread out over the table and then back to the bot currently attempting to climb up Tony’s leg. “Sure. Let’s go.”
Knowing what he knew now, Tony almost dreading leaving the shower and he couldn’t pinpoint why. It wasn’t as if he couldn’t tell Steve was already having random memories of times he couldn’t give a particular date to. It explained why things looked so familiar yet different. The selfish part of Tony had already started growing clingy, and Tony knew he was clingy because Rhodey never let him forget he was clingy, that part of him wasn’t sure if he’d lose a friend he was just now gaining once he found out the truth.
Steve grabbed Tony’s hand from under the table and smiled. “We should talk later.”
“It would appear that Steve the Genie has temporarily relocated himself to the common area. He is currently standing in front of the window again.”
“Yeah. Yeah I think...I just want to wake up and see you. The real you. And know that you’re still here anyway.”
Steve could see it, strangely enough, Tony flying through the air in a suit of armor. “I like it.”
Steve’s eyes rolled to the top of his head and he tried not to blush. He failed. “Thanks, Bucky.” He looked back down and gave his friend a hug. For once Bucky returned it instead of groaning about Steve being far too sentimental. “I’ll call you later.”
“We didn’t do a very good job when we realized it had to be one of us. It’s just that no one ever expected it to be you,” the brunet all but whispered.
He set his phone down and sat up, stumbling toward the bathroom to take a shower. The warm water felt nice and helped clear his head a little.
JARVIS’s voice was as calm as could be, “Evacuation is complete, I have instructed rescue crews to retreat. Starting upload to mansion servers.”
Tony kicked the box hard across the floor. “What the hell do you want me to say, Rogers? Hey, this has been a not so bad experience even though once again I’m getting close to people who only want me for what I can give them. I’m not looking to make the same stupid mistakes over and over again!”
“Thanks for dinner, Tony. I’m glad we did this.”
“I don’t know who that is, but he sounds like he might be a real bore.”
Their next major clean-up occurred two months later, hot on the heels of completing their previous one. Go figure.
Tony smiled, promptly pulling the soldier into a rough kiss, his fingers carding through blond hair. They both stayed together for awhile until the genius pulled back to take a breath.
Steve let out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding. “I learned if from you.”
Damnit.
The door was open and Tony was waiting patiently at the piano, but he was standing against the side of it rather than sitting down. He had his arms crossed and an excited smile on his face. Steve returned the smile and set his guitar against the wall.
“You almost died, Tony.”
Steve let the dish he was holding drop back down into the sink and quickly drained the water before turning around, letting out a quiet groan as Tony’s hand left his pants.
“Sir, Ms. Potts is on the line and Captain Rogers is seeking entrance into the workshop as we speak.”
“Oh that? Yeah they threaten me on a daily basis. It’s nothing new, but you should see how much they want to be my friend when it’s time for a big science project.” He smiled, showing his teeth, and shrugged. “I guess it helps when your father has the best lawyers ever, but I don’t really like to fall back on that much. Everyone already knows it anyway.”
Steve cut him off with a grin. “Tony.”
He will adamantly deny the fact that he squealed when the next thing he knew involved Steve putting an arm around his waist and lifting him slightly just to give him those extra inches he needed to complete his task. Star on top, he sighed when his feet were back on the ground.
Steve blinked and Tony removed his fingers from the blond’s lips. Steve licked them where they’d been pinched together and then smiled. “So are you saying that wouldn’t have worked if Clint or Natasha had asked you?”
“Hey!”
She laughed softly. “I’ve been asked to stand here and wait for you to show up. I had an interesting talk with Natasha.”
“Is there something troubling you, good Captain?”
Steve rolled his eyes. “I never tried to sell you on this lifestyle, Buck. You followed me cluckin’ around like a mother hen.”
Pepper didn’t say anything. She nodded her head.
“I’m not. Well I am, but I’m not mad at you. To be honest, I’m confused about my feelings when it comes to all of this, but not about my feelings for you.”
“What did they want?”
Steve rolled his neck until he heard another pop before he picked up the remote and turned of the television. The silence was very much welcome at this point and Steve let his head hang, eyes closed.
“Wanna try that again?”
“I’d tell you that was wonderful but you already know it was.”
“Oh. Turn on video feed.”
“What?” He found himself hugging Tony tighter, glad the kid wasn’t able to see his face right now. “Tony, I like you the way you are. If you were like me, then you wouldn’t be you. You’re wonderful.” Steve hated this. He hated it because he knew that Tony did grow up to be the very things he was scared of, never believing he was an actual hero. Nothing he said right now would change the future because this was Tony de-aged without memories, not any sort of time travel. “You have no idea how wonderful you are, Tony, but you are. I will always think you’re amazing, and I want you to remember that.”
Tony quickly added a “never ever” into the conversation. Natasha just grinned at him but didn’t promise a “never ever.”
“Ah. No. A deserted island actually but that’s something I’ll tell you when you get here. Steve isn’t...well he’s...ah, special. Don’t mention to anyone else that you’ve heard from me. I probably should have dropped by and visited you instead of calling like this.”
“So I guess I’ll see you later then, Tony.”
He pushed himself up and brushed the sand and dirt from his face and the front of his suit while he was turning around to kick at the offending...thing that had tripped him. He wasn’t expecting to find a bottle on the ground.
“Well take a seat.” He nods to the chair he placed next to the piano. “Prepare to have your mind blown away by this spectacular song choice.”
“Fair enough. I suppose that due to my untimely kidnapping and quote unquote death that he never actually got around to holding that press conference.” Steve caught a glimpse of something in Tony’s eyes before it flickered away. “I’m trying to get SI out of the weapons business.” He paused and shook his head. “That’s an explanation for another day.”
Steve was standing awkwardly, a nervous smile on his face. “I uh…yeah.”
The genie looked down at the ground. “I don’t belong here.”
“Oh.” His eyes widened. “Oh. How long have you been in that bottle?”
Steve stopped, panting a little. “Well I’m here now.”
Tony frowned at that. “Maybe.” He looked at the television. “I’m going to take a shower. Pepper will be so proud. Two showers two days in a row. You really are a good influence on me,” he said with a wink. “I’ll be back soon. Don’t fall asleep or leave...unless you’re tired.”
“Oh? Oh. I don’t know if that’d be a good idea. We might get tired of each other fast.”
“Where?”
Tony nodded and gave his boyfriend a small smile. “So, I guess I should come on up. I thought it was earlier than this.”
Tony placed the wrinkled page neatly back in the folder before shutting it again, his breathing off, heavy and paced as if he were trying to control it. His jaw was clenched, eyes squeezed shut.
Steve scowled at her before turning back to Tony. “What is it exactly that you want from us?”
“I uh...”
He shoved all thoughts of Tony away for the moment, if only so that he could actually focus on his work like he’d been attempting to do before the genius had burst into his space; and it worked. For several hours Steve managed to keep all thoughts of the brunet  to a minimum, managed not to feel even the slightest bit guilty for keeping Tony locked away. It was for his own safety, that’s all they were trying to do was keep the man safe, even if it meant he ignored Steve for awhile.
Tony turned his full attention to her. "Could you get this over with? I'm sure I get the gist of it. Pain of death, you'll kill me, blah blah blah, don't hurt him, don't cheat on him, he's a good guy, real hero. Does that sum it up?"
Bucky turned to glare at Gabe this time. “Shut up. You guys just don’t get it. Tell them, Steve.”
Tony didn’t hesitate to shoot Obie in the side, the blast hard enough to knock the other man to the ground, howling in pain.
As the AI began recalibrating the HUD, Tony put a pair of black goggles over his eyes and turned on a blowtorch, moving it to a joint in his gauntlet that had also malfunctioned as a result of his stellar landing skills. He supposed maybe he shouldn’t really be upset that Steve was once again angry with him as he did deviate from the plan, but it’s not like the good Captain ever actually listened to Tony’s reasons. He also reminded the super soldier on a daily basis that he wasn’t a team player, but that excuse never flew.
Tony stared at it for the longest time. He was still smiling but it looked more like a smile of wonder rather than a smile that said he was about to pick on Steve for staring at him far too long to remember that much detail. Tony was quiet when he spoke.
Bruce looked like he wanted to object to Steve’s demands, but before he could, Tony started speaking, explaining in great detail with almost manic excitement everything about the weapon that helped him with his escape. No, he didn’t make anything for them. No, he didn’t give them the real blueprints. Yes, he swears. Steve wanted to tune out about halfway through when their conversation delved off course into a conversation of their own about ways to potentially make the weapon more efficient in the future.
What they arrived to was all out chaos. Smoke billowed from the top floors of Stark Industries, gunfire being exchanged between a line of police and from within the crowd of people scurrying about trying to get out of the way. There were firemen running in and out of the building carrying stretchers and covered in soot and news crews scavenging like vultures at the barricades along with bystanders who seemed to have no regard for their own safety.
“Can’t move…”
Steve briefly shut his eyes and exhaled. “Sorry. I’m tired. Tired. That’s all. I think I might go back to bed.”
Tony looked back down at him, his jaw twitching. He stayed quiet.
Steve found himself being swamped by fans looking for autographs and reporters who felt it was more important to follow up a question about how he was helping to rebuild the city with “and are you single?” It was always times like this Steve wished Tony was there to field those questions because he knew how to talk his way around every subject known to man. Steve had first hand experience with that every time he tried to talk to Tony about why he needed to fill the team in on any changes he made to battle plans.
Tony wrinkled his nose. “I do too. I’m still alive.”
Tony scowled at that. “Not a kid.”
Tony, for all he wanted to retort, walked towards the skinny kid instead and held out a hand to help them up once they were alone.
“Well then I guess I can’t say no.”
"I don't take orders from you," he replied as he made his quick escape.
“Not likely…”
“Or else,” Pepper added on, voice steely, and Steve didn’t doubt for a minute that they meant every word.
He walked back over to his bed and threw himself down on it, grabbing a pillow and holding it over his face to mute his frustrated scream. When he was finished he hurled the pillow across the room and stood up to pace back and forth.
“Give them what they wanted.”
“Yeah yeah,” he muttered as he stepped onto the elevator. “Take me to my genie.”
The blonds smiled at each other and Steve breathed a sigh of relief. “Glad to see you showed up.”
The soldier felt his face blush a little but ignored it as he poured another very generous amount of lube over his throbbing erection, lowering himself slightly, one arm resting next to Tony’s head as his eyes searched the genius’. “I think uh…” he looked between their bodies. “We might have to just do it. This way.”
“Hello, girls!”
Steve closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the seat, lost in thought as he tried to figure out HYRDA’s angle this time around.
Steve deserved better anyway.
Tony landed and quickly received applause and cheers from other workers. His faceplate opened up once more, Tony smiling and his arms lifted in victory. “Thank you, thank you! I’m here all night! Well not literally, but you know what I mean.”
Steve sat down on the floor and held the tiny robot dog in his hands. He grinned when it started barking. He laughed when it started doing tricks. “Tony, this is-this is great! I can’t believe you made this so fast!”
“I think I can be persuaded.”
When Tony did speak, Steve was almost startled, his voice breaking the silence like a whip. “Stane,” he began, voice hoarse, “Steve, he’s—he didn’t tip HYDRA off and have them do his dirty work for him. They—he is.” He spit the words out as if they left a nasty taste in his mouth. “He’s one of them.” Tony went tense and then limp almost immediately after, his voice quiet. “I never knew. Never suspected. I didn’t even know that HYDRA existed and I called myself a futurist. This whole time he’s—he knew. He saw me with Bucky—“ Tony turned flipped through the pages, face pale. “He knew who you are. Has been trying to keep me under his thumb, under their thumb the whole time. When I said I was getting out of the weapons business, he had them take me to their warehouse to break me until I was forced to make keep making weapons. Thought they could get me to tell them where you were as a bonus.”
When they finally pulled apart, both smiling like huge dorks, J.A.R.V.I.S. interrupted their moment by announcing that “Master Barton has asked me to inform you that it is about fucking time.”
“I think we need a moment or two of privacy.”
“You have defective vision then. You’re an old man. It happens.”
“And I have a lot of targets painted on my back. It would have been helpful to know where some of those targets might have been coming from. I might have been able to plan differently.”
“It isn’t important. It’s stupid and it’s not important and you’re making things harder by doing this.”
“Try not to traumatize a pizza delivery guy like you did last time either.”
Steve turned around, voice low. “There’s nothing here. Let’s go.”
Luckily, that trip was over and they returned to the tower with a bundle of new clothes for Tony and some new toys. These toys fell under the category of tools and pieces for what he said would be a robot, but Tony was going to do what he wanted no matter what.
Steve narrowed his eyes at Tony even as he spoke to the rest of his team. “Give us a moment, would you?”
Tony sat back on the couch with a sigh while Peter continued to unwrap gifts. He was distracted so Steve sat back too, putting a hand over Tony’s. “I’m pretty sure I’m going to be in this for the long haul, Tony.”
“First of all, Captain, he is not an it, he is a he. Secondly, he’s standing right here and it’s rude to talk about someone like they aren’t even in the room when you and I both can clearly see him there, running into the wall--” Tony paused and frowned, though just for a moment. “That’s not supposed to happen, I’ll fix it. Thirdly, his name is Sergeant Major Nuts-N-Bolts.” Tony held up his hand in a stop motion when Steve opened his mouth to object and pointed at the bot where the name had in fact changed on his little screen. Tony grinned smugly and almost proud. “He’s already moved up in the ranks. You can’t say he hasn’t earned it, that sonuvabitch.”
Tony snorted. “Captain Perfect does not get shovel talks.”
They nodded and smiled once. The blond still had a puzzled look on his face.
Steve looked down at his attire and then back at Bucky, giving him a very pointed look. “I cannot go into a performance hall looking like this. They’re going to be dressed to the nines and I look like a crime waiting to happen.”
Any and all conversation was cut off when The Avengers started playing. Steve had never been so relieved in his life. He was soaking up all the awkward in the room and probably making every other person look and sound amazing by comparison. At least now he wouldn’t have to try and think of things to say because he would, without a doubt, embarrass himself and somehow Bucky too. He majored in awkward.
Tony groaned as he trailed behind Steve to the front door, radiating a level of curiosity that must have been killing him. Steve made a point of unlocking the door as slow as possible, if only because he sort of liked the way Tony bounced eagerly on his feet while Steve made him wait.
There was a semi-collective groan making its way around the room and Steve’s smile faltered a bit. Crap.
Steve lifted an eyebrow. “Okay,” he said, voice hoarse.
This wasn’t a situation they were getting out of in the next few hours. He really hated his life sometimes.
“For what?”
“You did not. Stop it, Tony. Just believe what I’m telling you now. That’s all that matters.”
Tony unbuckled his seatbelt and opened the passenger door, one foot already out before the door was half a foot opened. “You a good girl, Cap?”
“I’m ready. Oh god I’m ready.”
Steve laughed and dropped his head to Tony’s shoulder, the genius carding his fingers through Steve’s hair once more.
Steve chuckled quietly before his mouth was on Tony, barely sucking on the head before he began making his way down, taking him in and covering his shaft completely. Tony almost came right then, the pleasure too much but he managed to close his eyes and force back his orgasm. Just a little longer. He wanted this to last as long as possible.
“Yes.”
“Dad, Steve’s here,” Peter shouted over his shoulder.
*****
“Bucky, we need to get going soon.”
“It’s going to be a good Christmas, yeah?”
A smile quirked Steve’s lips. “You weren’t letting me into the workshop through the door so I used magic.”
He lifted his eyes just once to see his best friend and Natasha deep in conversation. Good. Maybe they’d found something else to talk about. He had a lot to think about, and all of his thoughts seemed to swirl around one particular person. He knew very little about Tony. They’d only met on two different occasions, and they were both rather limited in the information they had shared with each other. Tony had made it seem like music was all there was to know about him. He didn’t really mention his family or give any hints as to what his life outside of The Avengers was even like. To be fair, Steve hadn’t told Tony much more, but Tony seemed like he didn’t want to talk about himself much. Considering Tony’s lack of modesty that he only assumed came attached to a large ego, he would have expected a little more.
“You’re taking all the stupid with you,” Steve said softly, his attention no longer on Pepper or Tony.
Somewhat unsteady, he reached the shoreline and found quite a bit of debris that had washed up, but nothing that he seemed to actually need. That stripper pole? Well, he might be able to find some use for it. He located a few items he could use as tools and a few unopened bags of peanuts. Extraordinary.
“You know, I can still program this arm to slap you in the face at random intervals.”
“I just wanted…”
“He’s...you need to trust me. I know he rubs you the wrong way. He’s like that. He’s abrasive and sometimes careless when it comes to...okay so he’s completely tactless. Just...he’s not a killer. He’s young and he’s still very naive and trusting. Stane is someone who meant a lot to him. Probably still does.”
He stopped though and lightly pushed at Steve’s shoulder. “Sorry. I can’t…”
The bot hit Steve’s desk for what was probably the tenth time today, jostling all of Steve’s things. He frowned down at where the bot was hiding under his desk. “A leash would probably do the trick,” he muttered to himself.
“Have you been waiting around so you can kill me yourself?” Tony asked, voice rough with disuse.
“Yeah. That’s…” what I’m scared about right now, he finished without speaking. “I know.”
Steve waved as the car took off and wondered just what he had gotten himself into as well as what he’d do to pass the time in Tony’s absence.
“Put a sock in it, Barton!”
“I--no. You didn’t. It’s just me. I’m not--” he threw his hands up. “I’m not like you.”
Pepper’s eyes were determined, if not a little hesitant. “Please be safe,” she said, pulling him into a tight hug before running out, leaving Tony alone with a down Obadiah. The man was struggling toward his gun, Tony walked over calmly and kicked it to the corner.
“No. No we’re not. We are not doing double dates. I have had my fill of bad experiences going on doubles dates with you, Bucky Barnes.”
“Stark.”
While Natasha was on the phone Bucky leaned over the table they were sitting at to get a look at what Steve had been busily working on. “I thought you were supposed to be doing a self-portrait.”
Steve blinked. “Do what?”
“I could eat.”
“Is there anything else you’d like to do?”
A frustrated Tony tossed his hands up into the air and stormed out.
“We’re going out to the diner in a few. You want to join?”
Steve didn’t know what to say, didn’t really understand why Tony was telling him any of this to begin with but unwilling to say the wrong thing and ruin whatever was going on here.
Tony was laughing loudly. “As you heard, that’s J.A.R.V.I.S. J.A.R.V.I.S., this is Steve the genie. If you need anything, Steve, just ask him and he’ll help you. Let me tell you about the adventure I just had, J.”
“How did you even get here?”
Steve nodded. “Fair enough. What do you want to talk about?”
It was a time consuming process, assessing the weapons and noting pertinent information in a battered old school ledger that led to him being the butt of several ‘old man’ jokes by his colleagues, at least those close enough to ever see the ledger in the first place, but Steve was of the opinion that it was safer than using a computer to keep his records, especially when it concerned their under the table matters.
Tony snickered. “Impatient impatient.”
“Do you really want me to sit here and wax poetic about you for the rest of the night or do you want me to show you?” Steve arched an eyebrow.
Steve looked down, pawing at the back of his neck. “Not right now,” he murmured. “I need some sleep.”
“No, that’s you, Tony.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Big deal. I wanted to go with you. I was just giving you a hard time because I didn’t want to seem too eager to spend time with you.” Wait he just said that out loud. Oh no.
He opened his bedroom door and waited for Steve to enter before shutting it and taking a seat on his bed.
“Aww, Cap, come on. Were you planning on dragging me to watch this movie all along?”
“It rather is. Do you wish to tell him?”
Tony nodded quickly, looking right at Steve. “I do. I’ve heard everything. I’ve taken care of Hammer. More or less. He hasn’t realized it yet, but he’s slow and it might take him awhile to notice. I don’t care what he does to me. We’ve always hated each other, but when you fuck with someone I care about, I’m going to get even. So I did."
“Only if you promise to stick around a little longer.”
Steve snorted. “Trust me, I know. I’ve seen the size of your head.”
The first HYDRA goon Steve ran into only had a moment’s warning before Steve slammed the butt of his gun into the man’s temple, causing him drop like a sack of flour to the ground. Steve ignored the instinct to wince at the sound of his head slamming into the hard cement floors and kept moving.
The blonde followed Tony out of the room and down the halls until they reached what Natasha called the science dungeon, a project they’d originally intended for Bruce but had done just as nicely for Tony. When they arrived, Tony got right down to brass tacks, explaining everything using words that Steve could follow or stopping to explain when he couldn’t. He circled Steve, instructing him to open up various compartments and watching patiently as Steve took a look around inside of the bot. Overall, it was a very enlightening and informative lesson, one where Steve actually found himself enjoying the other man's presence.
Tony wrapped both his arms around Steve’s shoulders and held on tight, yanking Steve down until he was slightly bent over Tony, hands at the other man’s hips, gripping as tight as he could.
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand for one more ridiculous, wordless second and then let go, putting his hand back on his side of the car.
“My AI?”
Tony grinned wide. “He deserves it.” He looked between his friends again. “You know. I would be upset that you two trusted a mysterious letter with only a hint of finding me with no proper backup if I had any room to speak, but things being as they are, how about we call it a draw?”
“Damn. Okay point.”
Steve blinked. What the hell was going on? He hit reply on the last message.
“Fuck! I’m starving and I would kill for some coffee right now.”
Steve obeys Tony’s order, hips moving over Tony’s thigh as he dances. Tony slowly slides his hands over Steve’s back, down to his waist, and then to his ass where he gives a few encouraging squeezes that he knows jostles the plug inside of him. He doesn’t miss the way a flush starts to creep up Steve’s neck or the way his movements against Tony’s leg become more erratic.
I wasn’t you, I wasn’t like you. I was always Anthony Edward Stark and never Steven Grant Rogers, the greatest man Howard Stark ever knew. I wasn’t who he wanted me to be.
“What? Hey! Fuck you, Rogers. I’d never take us to some place like McDonald’s. I was definitely thinking Burger King.”
Bucky snorted. “No business today. Lucky me, I enjoy sitting here for hours with nothing to do.”
Tony reached out, hands playing along the neckline of his vest, breath just barely brushing against Steve’s neck. “This is all becoming very afterschool special. I didn’t know you had it in ya, Cap.”
Tony laughed, quiet but laced with pain. He clutched at his ribs and winced. “I didn’t ask to be taken.”
For someone who felt the need to remind them all constantly that he ‘wasn’t that kind of doctor’, the man never seemed to fall short on fulfilling their medical needs.
“This is marvelous craftsmanship, Tony,” Thor chimed in, a beaming smile as he ran his hands over the fabric of the vest. “Truly remarkable.”
The older man’s face shifted into a scowl and he stood, grabbing Tony by the throat as he slammed him into the wall. “You were always too arrogant for your own good, boy.”
“So is the sweater a fashion statement or…” Tony tilted his head. Where Steve had found this monstrosity he had no idea, but the smiling face of Rudolph and his actual blinking shiny nose looked back at everyone else.
Without a word to either of them, he took a seat opposite Tony and watched closely as Tony carried on with his work.
“Impossible.”
“It emits a specific high-frequency sound wave that paralyzes anyone within a designated distance.”
Steve just grinned. “Oh. Before I forget, I have some food for you. The pancakes aren’t...well they got cold, but I can make you more, but there is some pasta that I made for you afterwards because I knew you’d get hungry at some point.” He grabbed Tony’s hand and pulled him out of the room.
Steve took cautious, slow, steps until he could lean against his desk at Tony’s side. “And people like you…what do they deserve? Nothing?”
“So would you be interested in going out on a second date with a guy like me?”
Tony lost. Steve smirked. The genius glared but stood up, grabbing the empty canteen from the backpack they had. Too bad they didn’t have enough foresight to pack…
“I’ve got a selfish streak a mile long and I like the idea of giving you a run for your money.”
“Is that the only thing you took away from what I was saying?”
“Tony,” Steve said, a bit louder this time.
“I hate you.”
Steve whined quietly at the praise and Tony rewarded him by raising the vibrator setting up a notch. He enjoyed the sudden jerk and loud gasp Steve made as his hand continued to move slowly over the soldier’s hardness. It took every ounce of willpower he had not to pull Steve’s cock out so he could climb under the table and suck him off. God, did that sound hot though. Apparently his own dick was just as turned on by the thought as it strained against the jeans he was wearing.
Steve nodded once but couldn’t bring himself to move, and Tony seemed to be having mixed emotions on the idea as well. And wow. When had they gotten so close to each other?
Steve turned his head and stared out the window, trying and just barely managing to keep an impassive face as Tony told Rhodey and Pepper everything that was happening—everything that was going to happen in the future. He tried to remind himself that he was trusting Tony, even if that included trusting Rhodey and Pepper as well.
Tony batted his eyelashes at the soldier.
Steve sighed and crossed his arms over his chest. “What?”
Steve did not object at all.
“Why don’t you ever listen to me?”
“So Bucky tells me that you’re in a band too! Peggy never mentioned that part.”
Steve checked and loaded his gun. “I’m going to kill him. I’m going to find him and then I’m going to kill him,” he said lowly.
Rhodey smirked and leaned over to whisper quietly in Tony’s ear to which Tony’s entire face blossomed cherry red. Pepper laughed at the sight.
That caused Tony to laugh. Peter was brutally honest about things, just like he was. He was about to tell them that they really needed to leave when a man came out and took a seat in the ridiculous looking reading chair. A few children were taking seats on the tiny chairs for kids while parents stood back to watch. Peter made his way over there too.
Steve grunted, attention focused mostly on going over the organization's books. “What can I say, I’m lovable,” he said, mind elsewhere as he took notes.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up at that and a few unsavory yet incredibly sexy thoughts drifted through his mind.
Tony sighed. “DUM-E. U. Stop it now. You’re being rude.”
Well Tuesday happened as they generally tend to do. This one had been no exception as midtown had suddenly found itself surrounded by giant, lost turkeys. The operation could have run smoother, but the archer in all New Yorkers had apparently come out that day as many were prepared to see who could take down these turkeys with their own bows and arrows if for no other reason than to have the giant birds stuffed and displayed somewhere. Clint was personally offended and Hulk became even more enraged after being hit with one too many stray New Yorker arrows.
“If you say so, kid.” He ignored the glare Steve shot at him. “I don’t care for them either, so how about I’ll have your back if you have mine?”
“I’d like that,” was Steve’s reply, genuine and with a smile that Tony had said earlier that lit up a room. He’d tried to take it back and then cover it up with a joke, but Steve had semi-graciously accepted it.
They were halfway to their destination when Tony heard someone hollering immediately before he was quickly shoved out of the way and off the sidewalk, straight into the path of a taxicab and all Tony could think immediately before it happened was “oh crap, this isn’t how I’m supposed to die.” And then it was lights out.
Tony had the audacity to look slightly ashamed. “Yeah…..”
Steve just blinked and opened his mouth to say something, possibly to yell at Tony and get embarrassed, but ended up sighing and grabbing the bottle from Tony, tapping him on the nose with it.
Instead of facing the problem head-on like a responsible adult he decided to camp out in his workshop for a few days, and if he had to ignore the pained look on Steve’s face every time the soldier was unsuccessful at getting in, then so be it.
He shrugged. “Just someone I met.”
Steve chuckled. “No. Not at all.”
“No more secrets. I like having you around.”
“What do you want to know?” he asked, sounding every bit as tired as he suddenly looked.
Steve laughed softly and pulled Tony into a kiss before the man could keep talking. Tony would most likely never admit that he screamed like a teenage girl on the inside. He was going to take what he could get so he responded to the kiss almost immediately. Maybe he lived in a world where Steve Rogers wouldn’t get tired of him, wouldn’t leave him, but he was too scared to actually hope for that. Living in the moment was what this was about. Perhaps it’d take him somewhere great, as long as Steve was with him.
Once they were half a mile away they ditched the vehicle and Bruce behind, making their way from there on out by foot, quickly but quietly.
That night Tony introduced Steve to popcorn, coke and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. They were seated on the couch together but had managed to start off on opposite sides. Every time Tony had to explain a pop culture reference to Steve he ended up scooting closer to the genie.
“Fine by me.” Steve shifted, his arms crossing over his chest, and watched Tony tease the bot for a minute or five. “So…” he waited until Tony looked up at him expectantly, “is he a spy?”
Steve smiled. “Sorry. Didn’t want you to pull a muscle or anything. Looked like you were putting all your energy into it there after all.”
Bucky sighed. “Yeah but she’s also…”
Tony grabbed a chair and pulled it alongside Obie before plopping down. He stared down at the older man who was very obviously not trying to show how much pain he was in. It was testament to Obie’s extreme pride that he acted as though he hadn’t just been shot, as if he himself had chosen to lay on the floor at Tony’s feet. The metallic smell of his blood pouring out, staining his shirt, was enough to make Tony’s stomach turn, but now wasn’t the time to show weakness; it would only give Obie more strength.
“Ice cream isn’t breakfast food. But you can have the bacon and eggs.”
Tony looked up sharply. Steve had asked that question.
“I’m an art student. I work to help pay for school and joined a band to pass the time. I suppose I needed a separate hobby, but art is my real passion. It’s usually what relaxes me the most.”
Steve seemingly accepted that and leaned forward to press his lips to Tony’s. “Love you.”
The genius sighed, obviously tired. “It’s what I do. I’m in the business of making improvements.”
“‘Sides”, Steve continued, “HYDRA has never run like much of a mob organization. They have the superiority complex of gods walking the earth among swine. Their ties and beliefs are so rooted in ancient mythos that they’re practically a cult organization. ‘Cut off one head and two more shall take its place.’”
“What if my flaws are really bad? Because I’m arrogant and people always tell me I am. I’m kind of an asshole about it. I’m rich so that means I’m spoiled.”
Steve studied Tony’s face for a moment as he thought this over. “I don’t think I will, but even if I do it’s because no one is flawless. That doesn’t necessarily mean I’d stop liking you.”
The trip through the rest of the warehouse was fast this time around, filled with a silence so weighted that Steve felt almost tethered to the ground. He forced his legs to keep pumping, to keep propelling him forward until they were far enough away that the heat from the buildings explosion only warmed the back of Steve’s neck like a hot breath.
“Schmidt?” the older man asked, his voice presenting as falsely confused.
*****
He wasn’t expecting the confused stares.
Tony grinned. “You just gave this dork an amazing handjob so what does that make you?”
Tony snorted. “No. What would be helpful is a nice, hot shower, which I plan on taking the moment we get back to the tower.”
“Sorry about that. I uh...don’t know where they got the idea that we should.”
“So am I free to go then?”
Tony may or may not have added an extra bounce to his step and he most definitely did not walk into a wall because he was too preoccupied with looking down at his cell phone. Anyone that says otherwise is a damn dirty liar.
Bucky was all charm and charisma and could hold the attention of the entire room with not much more than a smile if he wanted to. Girls had always been Bucky’s forte. Steve came along for the ride, and he’d managed to ruin the nights of quite a few females who were expecting Steve to be like Bucky. Well the Steve from before. The Steve who was about five and a half feet tall and maybe 95 pounds. Where they found his awkwardness offputting and undesirable before, it was now quirky and adorable and Steve did not appreciate either of those distinctions.
Guilt. It hit Steve like an oncoming train. He realized he was dropping everything, including Tony, so he could leave as early as possible to track down Bucky, and while he knew Tony wanted to seem indifferent, the truth was that Steve wasn’t even taking the time to say goodbye properly and Tony was most likely taking it as a rejection.
“You’re only human. We all make mistakes, we do things we’re not proud of, but we learn from them don’t we?”
He still really wanted to tear Tony a new one for coming out in the first place, but he also sort of wanted to hold onto the other man for dear life because, good lord, how were they both okay? Tony was alive and mostly unharmed and if he wasn’t sure that his own shoulder was out of place, he’d shake the genius until he Tony agreed to just listen. For once. Tony was going to be the absolute death of him, Steve decided as he took the other man’s shoulders in his hands, breathing heavily, shakily, one way or the other, this man was going to kill him.
Steve’s eyes just twinkled.
Tony nodded at that. “Me too. I can be really demanding and self-centered.”
Steve didn’t bother to dignify that with an answer because he could lie and blow his cover right away or tell the truth and feel silly since he barely knew Tony anyway. Instead he just put his earbuds on and pressed play on his iPod. The music itself was relaxing, but piano pieces were always relaxing even when they weren’t. That probably only made sense to Steve. It was good for his focus, which is exactly what he needed if he was going to finish the portrait for his final art presentation.
He swiveled his head to assess which would be less painful and frowned a bit when he saw another disappointed look on Steve’s face.
Obie sneered. “You’ll destroy Stark Industries. You’ll put thousands of people out of work—“
Pepper just snorted and wiped at her eyes. “’Don’t worry about me’, he says. We’ve been worried about you for weeks, Tony. And now here you are telling us about all the horrible things that have happened to you and how it isn’t over and you want us not to worry?” She sounded incredulous, shaking her head as if Tony was a problem she could never hope to solve but resigned herself to sticking with anyway.
“But I didn’t ask for it!” Tony argued.
“Please. Not right now.”
Tony was back.
The smile Tony gave Steve was blinding and beautiful and Steve couldn’t imagine it ever having been anyone other than Tony. Always Tony. He gave the genius one more peck on the lips.
“Bullshit,” Steve snapped. “Be a man and say what you mean, not whatever will get this conversation over with the fastest.”
The blond gave him a smile, pressing a kiss to his forehead this time. “We’ll see. Get some sleep. It sounds like you’re struggling to say anything. I’ll still be here when you wake up.”
Rhodey was the first to speak. “We got a message, addressed to Pepper and I…it hinted at finding you so we came.” He shrugged as if that was all it took.
Steve took another breath to calm himself, it was no time to let emotions cloud his judgment. “Right.” He looked around the corner briefly. “Four in the corner, two in the middle and six scattered. Twelve all together, all equipped. Quick in and out, Stark is either being held somewhere else or he’s already made his escape attempt. Either way, we need to clear out these guards to make the odds tip in our favor.”
The silence in the room was stifling.
“Let him know I’m here. Just that I need a few hours before I see anyone.” Honestly he didn’t want to see anyone at all. He didn’t want to hear their questions about how things went, to hear their apologies and see the pity in their eyes when they learn he once again failed and would probably continue to do so.
“You make it sound so simple, boy,” Obadiah wheezed at him.
This scene played out several times with the same outcome every time. The problem was the fact that Tony was so persistent and kept coming back and coming back. He’d stopped inquiring about a second date though and stopped trying to be affectionate. He even stopped sitting next to Steve on the couch during movie night or when they were playing video games.
Steve paused. “What? I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Bruce raised his hand. “I’ll start putting hooks on ornaments.”
Steve looked up from his drawing for a moment to give Tony a smile. Tony smiled in return and perched himself on the back of the couch, leaning over to see what Steve was drawing. “Wow, that’s really good.”
“Suit yourself, bro. We’re doing double dates when he gets back though.”
Tony blinked, a slow smile forming on his lips. Suddenly it was clear. And easier than he expected it to be. “I love you, Steve.”
Tony stopped right in front of the blond but didn’t make a move to touch him. He wasn’t sure what to do in instances like this and Steve didn’t seem to know what he was supposed to do either. “It went well. I mean I visited three different countries in six days and I was tired, but I managed to stay awake through every performance so I count it as a victory.”
“Well I’ll be here waiting.”
“Steve, stop right there. I can assure you that he wants to.”
“I told you to warn me, St…”
He turned to look at the intruder. Tony. He was standing back a little, eyes focused on Steve’s hands.
After a few moments Tony found his voice again. “What just happened?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “You’re like, five years older than me. Stop calling me a kid already.”
“Right. I can do that. You know me. I’ve always enjoyed being the focus of attention.”
“Hey! Rude! That’s the worst wish ever. You should have wished for your own department store of overpriced shoes with heels that are…”
Steve eyed the light in Tony’s chest but didn’t say anything. “Okay.”
“Why can’t you take me to my parents?”
Steve gave a shrug and stopped what he was doing. “Would you have wanted to tell me if i had asked?”
“I still look younger than you though,” Steve said quietly.
Tony actually blushed a little but answered as if it was plainly obvious. “Because you’re a hero. That’s why.”
“Why? What’s going to happen if you do talk about it?”
“So you really did hear?”
Zola spit blood onto the tile. “When a dog runs away it’s your job to find it.”
“What’s the hold up, Tony? We’ve been…” Pepper stopped midsentence to fully grasp what she had just walked in on.
“They want to run tests for a few days.” His voice sounded rough. “Apparently it’s unusual to find a super soldier turned genie turned back into a super soldier.”
After much consideration and a little selfish moping, he finally stepped out of the shower and put on some fresh pajamas. When he found Steve, he was busy drawing. Where Steve had found a sketch pad and a pencil Tony wasn’t sure, but Steve probably popped it into existence. That seemed to be his thing.
“I don’t think they’ll let us into the lobby if we’re completely drenched like this,” Steve mused while he swayed with Tony, in the rain, a smile on his face hidden in the hair of the man in his arms.
“You get as many as--”
Tony shrugged. “Yes and no. Now doesn’t count. In the future?”
Tony’s eyes were trained on Steve. He was trying to tune Obie out because he wanted all of his attention on the blond. One of Steve’s fingers twitched, and then another, but he still wasn’t able to make a move.
Tony laid his palm flat on Steve’s stomach, pulling it away almost as quickly as he’d placed it there. He muttered under his breath, “How do you not have a girlfriend?”
“I told you so, Tasha!”
“So that sass is a Steve thing and not a genie thing.”
Steve took it with a smile of his own. “Steve Rogers, art teacher. You already knew that though.” If both of them lingered a little too long on the handshake, neither of them bothered to mention it.
The blonde abruptly shut the ledger, all important information recorded and ready to be hidden away for the time being. Steve sat at the table a bit longer though, his pen forgotten, fingers steepled underneath his chin.
Howard squeezed his eyes shut and pinched the bridge of his nose. “We’re going to discuss this later. And don’t think you’re going to be getting out of this Anthony Edward Stark. This is going to have to stop. How are you going to handle it if the tabloids catch on to the fact that you’re apparently dating a man for Christ’s sake? Do you even think about that? Have you stopped to wonder if these people are using you and taking advantage of you for your money and fame?”
"I hate my life right now," the genius mumbled. Which was a lie. He had Steve in his bed every night and this was the happiest he'd been in a long time.
Obie rolled his eyes. “It wasn’t me. Not exactly. I just knew the right people to pay off to make it look like a terrible accident.”
He decided it would be a good idea to text him and let him know. Natasha probably wouldn’t kill him. Then again, this wasn’t the first time he’d jokingly proposed to his best friend.
Steve finally smiled. “I want to try. With you, that is. It’s probably a really bad idea but it’s all I’ve been thinking about since you left and I want to try.”
Tony was on top of the world. He was adored by people who didn’t know him personally, and those who did were regularly tested. Even with all of that, Steve figured it must get pretty lonely at the top. Tony was quick witted and socially awkward, but well-versed in how to handle the spotlight. It had taken awhile for everyone to actually see Tony for who he really was, and he turned out to be the exact opposite of what Steve had first assumed. Even though they were influenced by Loki’s staff, Steve still regretted the things he said. He’d tried apologizing but Tony waved him off and said it wasn’t necessary.
“Okay okay yeah. Bad choice. Scratch the movie,” Bucky replied. He glanced at Natasha again. “Any more ideas?”
Fury just smiled. "Dismissed. Get out."
Steve stood up from behind the desk. “Barton?”
“I had a good time,” Tony finally blurted out, and he might have been blushing a little.
Peter giggled. “I think we broke him.”
“At least we’re warm now,” Tony finally said.
Tony nodded. “You better st--fuck.” His hips were bouncing. “I want that cock inside of me right now.”
Steve got used to sleeping in that chair, hunched uncomfortably over with his head resting lightly on the edge of Tony’s bed. While he waited, Steve would fill his time with sketching, reading, or doing what little work he could accomplish from the room, though mostly he just watched Tony.
After he quickly grabbed a warm jacket, a scarf and a pair of gloves, he found himself walking out onto the sidewalk with Steve who always insisted that they walk somewhere instead of having Happy drive them because it honestly wasn’t that far to walk and a waste of gas. Tony always told Steve that if he ever ended up losing an appendage because of hypothermia that he’d make sure he knew it was his fault for the rest of Tony’s life.
Steve pushed himself from the table, back popping as he straightened up. He rubbed the back of his neck to ease the tension that had built up there, tension that would only get worse until he could finally take a moment to relax at some point in the future. Definitely not tomorrow though, tomorrow he had to take Bucky and Natasha out with him, if for nothing more than a little hard hitting persuasion, something the both of them excelled at.
“Nah. Life’s too short.” He grinned. “It’d be a crime for me to feel ashamed of what we just did. I want to do it again. Soon. Well maybe not soon. I have to leave in a few minutes. I’m going out of the country for a piano performance.”
“I need you to do something for me.”
He looked at the soldier and the soldier winked back.
Tony held up a thumb drive. “Lots of encrypted data. Usernames. Passwords. Account information. Stealth.”
Steve groaned. “Tony, ho—“
“Okay this isn’t just for you, but I’ve completely redesigned the quinjet engine. I uh...well I can show you in detail if you want to. It is just a more efficient engine, more practical, a few extra punches the current one lacks.”
The blond rolled his eyes and laughed. “Sure.”
“I’m right here. I don’t need protection.”
Now Steve was beaming and he gave Thor a sweater.
The kids followed suit though.
“What?” Tony felt a little dizzy after that. “Why?”
Tony opened his mouth to reply…
And he knew he’d probably outlive all of them as well.
Pepper just nodded as she stared at Steve, taking her seat again. “That really helps the outfit make so much more sense. Tony!” She lightly backhanded his arm. “I thought you picked up a hooker or something!”
And there was his suit. Completely powerless. He was still pissed about how that happened too.
It would serve him right.
“Oh god. Stop teasing already!” He was breathless and his cock was already throbbing with want.
“Then don’t let them get to you. I’m a big boy. I’m not some fragile doll or whatever. I can take care of myself and it’s not their business to say anything otherwise. Especially if they’re implying that I’m so easy to hurt.”
“The same way you’re telling him you’re terrified that he’s going to look down on you because he’s got all this newfound confidence, which is totally fake by the way, and will think that you’re just an idiot not worth talking to?”
“The...what?”
Until Steve’s face lit up even more.
Tony shut his mouth and looked at Steve.
“Not during an actual performance, no. I have just while practicing though. It happens. The hours are long but I can’t complain.”
“What I do is purely on a need to know basis. What we do has nothing to do with your work on Bucky.” Steve knew how ridiculous it all must have sounded now, all things considered, but it had been the truth up until Tony managed to get himself kidnapped HYDRA. “You not knowing, it was as much for your protection as it was for ours”.
“Not bad for a kid.”
“I’m not feeling it.”
The tip of Tony’s tongue was poking from the side of his mouth and he was concentrating hard, trying not to get too angry about the fact that he was not a cookie artist. Once he less-than-skillfully completed one, he held it up with a smile on his face. “This one is for Clint because he’s a dick.”
*****
“You caught me,” the genius snarked, hand flying up rather ridiculously into the air. “He’s here to watch you get undressed and then report back to me. In hindsight I should have installed a better camera but that can always be fixed.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “It’s not like you can’t just fix him right back up.”
Bucky threw his arm over Steve’s shoulder as they walked. “Hey. I worked hard for this huge ego. I earned this ego! Anyway, she’s coming out with us later. I told her you would drive us. Thanks ahead of time.”
The brunet’s head shot up and he looked from the screen that was showing a very put out looking Pepper to the door that was showing an equally put out Steve.
“I will always choose Iron Man when I need someone to have my back. That’s always a given. I also enjoy having Tony Stark around too, though.”
Steve shook his head. “I don’t revel in fear nor do I desire it as you do. I want peace, even if that means getting my hands dirty with scum like you. Cowards hiding behind words,’ Steve stood tall. “Now quit stalling.”
With a heavy sigh, Tony rolled over onto his back and grabbed his far-too-excited-this-early-in-the-morning son with one arm and pulled him down, tickling his stomach mercilessly while Peter squealed with laughter. The more the child struggled to get free, the more spots Tony found to tickle. Once Peter cried “uncle” Tony finally stopped.
Tony had told Steve everything he’d learned. He’d watched Steve’s face shift from horrified to sad to confused and all other emotions in between. And after all of that Steve still didn’t know. He couldn’t remember. He’d allowed Steve the privacy of going to another part of the building to read the files they had, to see the pictures. Hopefully it’d help him understand why he was at odds with things he knew and didn’t know. He’d been gone for a couple of hours at this point.
Clint finally snapped his vest into place and struck a heroic pose. “Again, as remarkable as this feels, which, yeah nice, I feel like we aren’t emphasizing how this doesn’t get him out of Christmas presents. Come one people, personalized arrows!”
“Bucky, we’re not actually getting married. He’s just joking around.”
Sheet music in front of him, he shut his eyes and started playing. He’d memorized the music long ago and chose to play with his eyes closed or while focused on a point beyond the piano. The times he had always messed up had been the times he’d focused too hard on the sheet music or whenever he decided to look down at the keys while he played. He was a total ham anyway and he knew it. He lived for reactions, for the sense of awe people felt when they watched him play. Tony Stark knew he was good at what he did. The piano was his life. He lived it, he breathed it, it was home, it was him. He’d begun to wonder if he was good at anything else. He was smart. Hell he was an acknowledged genius. His IQ was ridiculous but he had a hard time putting stock into a number that determined if you were actually smart. No one considered art a basis for testing intelligence so people who excelled in the arts but failed in the maths and sciences were more often considered colorful or entertaining rather than highly intelligent. He knew he was smarter than almost everyone he knew, but he also knew he wasn’t at the same time.
Bruce shrugged. “Why not? If I hulk out at any point it’s not like it’ll be a total loss.” Natasha pursed her lips and nodded in agreement and Steve now stood with only one sweater remaining. He smiled at Tony and waited for Tony to accept it with open arms.
“Not everything needs to be constantly improved upon. Sometimes the flaws are what makes something perfect.”
She cut him off. “It doesn’t matter, Tony. Get your priorities straight. I have to go do more damage control.”
“I have indeed ‘got this’, as you have so eloquently worded it,” the AI responded with a hint of sarcasm.
Steve sputtered and then snorted. “Yeah right. You wouldn’t be impressed.”
Tony continued on. “Are you new here?”
Tony squinted for a moment before his own eyes widened and a smile crossed his face as well. “Steve? You failed to mention that you were in a band.”
He tried to get things back on track with a rush that wasn’t fooling anyone. “We should probably discuss what role the two of you can play without putting you in any direct lines of fire.” He focused his attention on Pepper. “Anything you can get on Obadiah would help. Location, business meetings, accounts that we haven’t already found. We want to corner him so he has nowhere to run when we come knocking at his front door.” Steve shifted to Rhodey once Pepper gave him a determined nod. “The Red Skull.
