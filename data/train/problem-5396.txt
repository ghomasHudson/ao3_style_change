The room on the other side was dim and just as sparsely populated as the parking lot had hinted at, only a handful of people scattered around the room, a single lethargic game of pool in progress. The smell of cigarettes and cheap beer washed over him. He took a deep breath, the last of the tension leaching from his body. It could be any other bar he’d ever haunted across the country, but for the sharpness of salt and gun oil undercutting it all that let him know that he was among his people, something wary and alert deep inside him finally relaxing at the familiar smell and the sense of safety it carried. He finished his visual sweep of the room at the bar, where he wasn’t surprised to find Ellen already looking back at him. It had only been a couple of months since he’d last seen her, and she hadn’t changed at all, right down to the unimpressed look she was giving him that he could feel all the way across the room. He sighed, braced himself, then walked across the room, the worn and stained wooden boards creaking under his feet.
written in block letters above a listing of the service times. The buildings around it were just as incongruent, and Dean wondered if the church was maybe the last remaining part of the original town, if it had simply shifted and changed and evolved over the years around it, the church the only constant over decades of growth and change. This late in the day, it was silent and empty, and Dean drove past it without stopping. Just past the church however, he finally spotted a sign declaring that there were
“What do you mean?” Nicole asked. Sam frowned.
“Dean,” Jim said, his hands gentle on Dean’s own, coaxing, slowly pulling them away from his head. He reluctantly raised his eyes to meet Jim’s, hating the way the grief and sympathy in them made tears sting at the back of his throat. “Do you think…” he started, then paused, clearly hesitant, maybe worried about how Dean might react to whatever he said next. “Do you think Sam might have lied?” Dean blinked at him.
“Fine,” Kyle finally said, glancing at Nicole before his eyes slid over to where Sam was standing in the background. “You’re with Jason,” he said, and Sam nodded.
“Y’know, I’m running a business here, Winchester,” she said as soon as he was close enough to hear her without her having to yell. “I don’t need you coming in the back door and harassing my staff. None of the rest of these assholes try to pull that shit,” she nodded towards the rest of the room as Dean slid onto one of the barstools.
“You did something,” Jason said, repeating Kyle’s earlier accusation as he pointed at Sam. Sam let his eyes widen, taking a couple steps back and shaking his head.
“About going to university,” Jim said, and Dean started shaking his head before he had the chance to finish talking.
“Nice to meet you,” Dean said, belatedly reminding himself that he should probably be at least polite to the other hunter. You never knew who you might run into on a hunt, or who you might need to call in for backup. Rick nodded, standing and knocking his knuckles against the bartop.
It was the clothing that drew the eye, the source of all the colour, as the blood had long since dried dark and brown. The bodies had clearly been out there for some time, though Dean would guess that the curse had done a decent amount to speed up the decaying process based on what it had done to the man and woman in town in such a short amount of time. The blood splatters on the rock had dried as well but were still clearly visible against the dusty grey, reaching high up the sides of the rocks encircling the clearing. As his eyes followed their path, he noted that there was none on the white rock, even though the path of the spatter meant that there should have been. Dean stepped forward again, but not towards the rock this time, diverting to the body nearest him. It was a little girl, no more than eight, and his stomach rolled as he crouched down next to the tiny body. He never knew if he should wish for numbness in moments like this or not, if it would be better if he felt nothing at the sight of small bodies or if that would just mean that something inside of him was broken beyond saving. He did know that it never got easier, as he cautiously reached out and rolled her over. She moved easily, and he wrinkled his nose as the smell of decay finally reached him. Pressed face down in the wet dirt, her face had gotten the worst of it, and Dean again had to breathe through the nausea, forcing himself to examine her mouth even as all his instincts told him that it was wrong, disrespectful, a violation that he had no right to.
“That makes sense,” Nicole said, turning to Kyle, who, after a tense moment, reluctantly nodded his agreement.
“Sam. He wasn’t at Stanford.” Jim’s frown deepened.
“I just needed a minute,” he said, a weak excuse but the truth nonetheless, all he had to offer. “I just… it’s… I needed to
“Do what you will to me, hunter,” it said. “It will not change the fact that your precious little brother is already damned. There is nothing that you can do to save him, or to stop what has already begun. The angels are too stupid to realize that they have already lost, and you will be dragged screaming and dying to the pit, where you belong. You can feel it already, can’t you, Dean? The damnation licking at the edges of your soul, your humanity slipping away as you hunt for what has already died, what is already beyond all hope of salvation. When we get to that final bloody day, when Hell rises triumphant and free, the Sword will already be nothing but ash, and heaven will need to find another weapon to wage their doomed war.” The demon’s rage was clear, its voice transformed into a buzzing, inhuman noise, words layering under and over each other as it glared at Dean. He had to fight not to flinch away, the demon’s words pouring out of it without pause like an endless, burning stream, each one landing on Dean’s ears with a weight that spoke of prognostication: a certainty that belonged only to zealots and prophets. He felt like he couldn’t breathe, each word striking something deep inside of him, like a single chord on some impossibly large string, echoing and reverberating through his bones, making him shake as he stared back at a face warped with fury. He still didn’t understand, didn’t know what the demon was talking about, but it felt true in a way that made his mouth dry, his breath shaky and unsteady.
he thought, finishing his inspection of the room. Turning back to his food, he heard his stomach growl embarrassingly loud. He almost groaned as he bit into his burger.
Sam shoved forward with his hands, using them to direct his power as it rushed towards Novikov. Novikov’s eyes widened, and then flickered, disappearing alongside the rest of him as the specter vanished. There was a flash of white as the ghost retreated along the lines of power that he had seen earlier, scars of magic and pain that were indelibly etched throughout the house. Without anything to hit, Sam’s power dissipated, flowing out from him in a wash like the tide going out, and Sam let it go. Novikov wasn’t gone, but he was gone for now, and that was all Sam needed.
“¿Cómo está el tuyo, viejo?” Dean replied, and fought the urge to smile when Bobby glared back at him. He turned back to his stack of books, muttering something about respect and kids these days, and Dean turned his attention back to the book in his hands instead. The cover had a crudely drawn pentagram on it, and when he opened it he saw that the entire thing was handwritten by someone who apparently had only the loosest grasp on what shape latin letters should be. Sighing, Dean hooked his beer off the table before letting himself sink further back into the couch.
Dean blinked, and they were inside his hotel room. He jerked himself free of Castiel’s unresisting grip, running towards the bathroom, barely managing to lift the lid of the toilet before he was collapsing to his knees in front of it and throwing up. His muscles were clenching weirdly, his entire body shivering, and he couldn’t think around the unfamiliar sensations taking over his body even as his stomach forced out everything he’d eaten that day.
“A child could do the same,” she said. “And you, Samael, are not a child.” He scowled at the name but didn't say anything. Merihem smiled brightly at him, as if she could hear what he was thinking, even though he knew perfectly well that that was a skill she didn’t possess. He shot her an irritated look instead, fought back the childish urge to stick his tongue out at her. .
“Another one?” she asked, and he shook his head.
“You’re going to tell me what you know about my brother,” he said, and the demon threw its head back in an exaggerated laugh, designed to provoke, just as much a lie as any words it might have spoken. When it looked at Dean again, its eyes were black, and its smile seemed to have grown an impossible couple of inches wider, the thin human skin straining at the corners, the mortal flesh struggling to contain what broiled within it.

I truly cannot believe I wrote something this long, this fast :o
Dean asked, latching onto the most ominous part of that statement, and the bartender grinned, leaning forward.
“Sorry Dean,” she said, verbalizing what he already knew. “Nothing on your brother, or your daddy.” She nodded towards the larger room. “Most of this lot just got here in the last hour or so though, haven’t had the chance to talk to most of them. They might have heard something. Since you’re staying the night, you’ll have lots of time to talk to all of them, and anyone else who might come in tonight.”
Dean had checked John’s journal after he’d hung up the phone, just in case, but wasn’t surprised when he wasn’t able to find anything in there by that name. John had only been to Mexico on a handful of cases, and even then, mostly sticking to the north-west part of the country – Dean would be heading far further south than he thought John had ever travelled. Despite its unhelpfulness in this case, Dean could admit that John’s journal had come in handy in quite a few hunts in the ten months since he’d walked into a cabin just outside of Red Oak to find no sign of his father other than the torn paper remnants of the research from a hunt and the journal, his father’s prize possession, sitting square in the middle of the kitchen table. A gift, and a message, both well received and understood by Dean.
He still stayed the night, more because he wasn’t sure he’d be able to drive anywhere without getting at least a couple of hours of sleep. He didn’t want to risk accidentally running his baby off the road.
It was too flat down here, too open. The wind that whipped over the snow banks was sending snow gusting into his vision, sharply stinging against his cheeks, despite the fact that it was ostensibly a clear and sunny day. The sparse scattering of trees that filled the valley were no match for the force of the air twisting around them, their limbs creaking and groaning under it’s force. Sam tugged the hood up on his parka again, hunching forward so that the wind couldn’t grab hold of it and yank it off again. Under the added protection of the rim of fur now circling his face, he turned in place, taking stock of his surroundings, and his options. To his right he could just see the curve of the river, surrounded by rocks swept free of snow by the wind, flashes of the river rushing by still visible amongst planes of ice, deep blue in hue and thrusting jaggedly upward where it had broken against each other and refrozen, thrusting its harsh edges upwards to catch the sunlight. It would be difficult to cross, dangerous as well. Even if he was able to find a path across the ice, unbroken by the whitecapped water, there was no way for him to know how thick the ice was, and if he fell through… well, it would just be a contest to see what killed him first, the rocks lining the riverbed, or the cold choke of the water itself.
“No worries,” he said. “I’ll hear it from someone else, some other time maybe. Just thought it sounded cool.” Dean snorted, shaking his head and hoping the noise wasn’t as bitter as he felt.
“You shouldn’t have let her go,” the woman said, and Sam turned to see Merihem standing behind him, arms crossed as she stared after the other woman. “She’s already at the neighbors. The police will be here soon.” Sam shrugged.
“See?” Bobby said. “He’s still–”
cw: attempted suicide, graphic descriptions of violence
Halfway through!! And we finally know who has Sam [eyes emoji]
The demon looked up as he approached, a wide grin splitting the face of the man he was riding. He was young, whoever he had been, white with long blonde hair and a tattoo of a lion on his shoulder. Once, Dean would have wondered who he was – if he had family, if there were people missing him – but he’d become completely numb to those questions long ago. You saved who you could, and if Dean had to choose between a meatsuit and whoever they were after, he’d choose the one not occupied by a demon every time. Hazards of the job or a slippery slope to hell, whatever. Dean tried not to think about it. He needed to sleep at night, and he figured so long as his list of lives saved outnumbered the people he killed, or watched get killed, or let get killed, he wasn’t evil. In some grey area, maybe, but not evil.
The morning dawned cold and clear, wind no longer whipping around and through the trunks and branches of the empty and isolated landscape. Silence was the only thing to greet him when Sam pushed the branches out of the entrance to the hollow, blinking in the dim grey light of early morning. He climbed out, limbs aching from sleeping curled into a small ball, his back even more sore than the day before, muscles tense from both the cold and a night spent on edge, ready to wake at the slightest sign of something nearing his small shelter. Nothing had though, and the snow surrounding him was smooth and unbroken. Sam stretched, shaking out his limbs, bending first one arm across his chest, then the other. He frowned when the motion elicited a strange crackling noise from the inside of his parka, and he unfastened the clasps to peer inside. There was a pocket in the lining, just over his heart, and he used his teeth to pull off one of his mittens so that he could reach inside of it. It wasn’t until his hand closed around its contents that he considered that this might be a trap, a test, but by then it was too late, so he just pulled his hand back out, finding himself holding a granola bar and two hand warmers. He blinked at them in blank surprise for a long moment, before thinking
“Go bother someone else,” Katerina said, but Dean could see the smile threatening on her face. Still, he pushed himself up and away from the door, gesturing between the two of them as he walked across the room.
“Probably lucky he didn’t do worse this time,” she said as Sam carefully rolled the sleeve back down. She handed him the cufflink when he held out his hand, and watched as he finished putting himself back together. Neither of them commented on how hard he was shaking, bad enough that it took a few attempts before he was finally able to secure the cufflink. It was part of his punishment after all, and there wasn’t anything that either of them could do about it.
, but it was hard to tell around the ringing in his ears, the way his entire body was throbbing in pain as his lungs desperately tried to remember how to breathe. Sam pushed himself up onto his elbows, then to his knees, his entire body screaming its disapproval. He took a single deep breath, braced on his hands and knees, body trembling, and then he shoved the pain away with the ease of long practice, locking down his senses until the physical pain barely even registered. Raising his head, he wasn’t surprised to see that the room was empty aside from Jason’s body, the other teenagers having clearly taken the opportunity to escape the basement. Sam briefly wondered if Ryan had done this, before remembering the way that he’d looked behind Sam.
“Sam,” she said, and Sam waved her off.
If Sam wasn’t at Stanford, then where the hell was he?
“I told you, I didn’t,” it said. Dean gritted his teeth.
By the time he reached the kitchen, he had to admit that what his gut had told him the second he woke was true: they were alone in the house. Whatever the things that had invaded his dreams had been, they had not followed him to the waking world. Dean swallowed, standing still in the moonlight, staring blindly at the sink and trying to process what just happened. He was exhausted though, had scarcely slept at all going by the clock on the stove. The taste of fear was still hot and bitter on his tongue, and his heart rate hadn’t slowed at all since he woke. He could barely think about everything that had happened, everything that had been said to him, much less try and understand it. How it had even happened at all, how he’d ended up in that strange place that twined together reality and dream. Fuck, he needed to talk Katerina into letting him ward the whole house when she woke up – that he’d somehow been dragged into that place from her bed definitely meant that the current warding wasn’t nearly good enough. He blinked, swaying with fatigue, and frowned. There had been no pain to the movement, and Dean belatedly realized that he was able to see normally out of both eyes, had been the entire time he’d searched the house. He raised his hand to his face slowly, fingertips no longer sending an ache through his whole face as he pressed down on the smooth skin there, hot to the touch. He stood still for a long second before he looked down, twisting to expose his side fully to the moonlight spilling into the room through the window. His breath caught in his throat, and he wasn’t able to do anything but stare down at his body in shock.
Jim pulled back, shrugged.
“Yeah, I know,” he said. “Not the same thing.”
” he said. “You’re–” he cut himself off, eyes going wide at something above and behind Sam’s shoulder, and Sam only had the time to half turn his head before a force slammed into his side, sending him flying across the room and into the concrete wall. He hit the ground with a heavy thud, chunks of concrete and dirt raining down around him. He could hear the distant sounds of voices, maybe one of them yelling
“Is what?” Kyle snarled back at him, though Sam could clearly hear the tremble in his voice.
“Who’d you hear that from?” he said instead, taking a slow drink of his beer in an attempt to stop his hands from shaking.
Still, he was more cautious as he crossed the final stretch of icy ground between him and the building.
“No, probably not.” He hesitated, not speaking for a long moment. Merihem let the silence rest, waiting for him to go on. “She was just so small,” he finally said, voice soft. “Seeing her lying there like that… she was just so small, still just a baby really.” He stared out into space, the sight of the girl lying crumpled on the floor filling his mind, the screams of her parents still echoing in his head, their blood soaking his clothes, spreading across the floor. When he’d touched her, he’d left smears of blood behind, a physical reminder of the invisible stain of corruption that he left on everything he touched. The gasp of air sucked into shocked lungs was still loud in his mind, the look in her eyes when they’d fluttered open to see him kneeling over her, the hummingbird-fast beat of her heart remembering how to work. His touch might spread nothing but disease and death but she had walked out of that house with tears in her eyes and breath in her lungs and he couldn’t bring himself to regret that. He looked over at Merihem, met her eyes, and knew that she both did and didn’t understand. They shared a small smile, before Sam looked back out over the crowd.
“Okay,” he said, “then let’s do this.”
The wave of power shattered, falling to the floor and vanishing into nothing, and Sam barely managed to stagger the few final steps into the kitchen as it left him. The doors were open, and he didn’t know if it was because the sun had risen or because he’d destroyed Novikov but either way they were gone, the kids were
“I know,” Ryan said, not taking his eyes off Sam. “But he’s not going to kill you, so please just step away.” Kyle swallowed, loud in the silence, and grabbed both of the girls, pulling them to the side, away from Ryan and Sam. There was a long moment of silence as Ryan and Sam considered each other. “Why did you think it was Jason?” Ryan asked.
“Winchester, right?” the man asked, still unphased. Dean nodded, watching out of the corner of his eye as the man regarded him.
Fully inside the shadow cast by the outcropping, Dean could see that what had looked, from his previous line of sight, like an unbroken wall was actually split, a path curving upwards and disappearing between the two rocks. Dean glanced around him, but there was nothing there, no signs or sigils or tracks, so he cautiously began to follow the path, gun held at the ready. He moved slowly, thinking absurdly of Indiana Jones as he scanned for any sort of trap, physical or magical. There was nothing, just the dirt of the path, the rough surfaces of the rocks boxing him in, rising far above him. Dean looked over his shoulder and began walking with his back against one of the rock walls, painfully aware of just how trapped he would be if anything came at him from both sides. Still, he continued forward, the smell of vegetation and water growing thicker as he moved deeper between the rocks, around that curve that had prevented him from seeing where the path would lead him. There was a final, abrupt corner in the path, and then Dean was surprised to find himself at the edge of an open, round clearing. His gun didn’t waver, though his brain struggled to process and categorize everything that now lay in front of him all at once. The first thing that registered was just how colourful it was, how vibrant, and then he registered just why that was, and his stomach lurched with nausea.
“It’s fine,” he said, voice turning wry. “I’ve had worse.” She snorted, releasing his hand.
“Right,” Dean said. “Because you’re an angel?” Castiel cocked his head to the side.
Thank you again to Eliza for the beta, you are the absolute best!!
“Now, an old man’s gotta have some secrets,” Bobby said. “It’s the only thing that keeps us from total irrelevancy.”
Thank you to Helen for the beta!
Dean had intended to finish his food before making his rounds of the room, but it turned out he didn’t get the chance, a heavy body settling into the stool next to his after only a few minutes. Dean turned to look at the stranger now sitting next to him. The man didn’t seem at all put off by either Dean’s glare or the way his cheeks were puffed out with half-chewed food, just offered his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam thought with a groan, staggering to his feet with the help of one hand braced against the wall. He scanned the room, but the ghost was nowhere to be seen. Sam glanced down at his watch, and fear so strong it made bile rise in his throat rolled through him. He only had half an hour remaining until sunrise and he didn’t understand how that could be, he should have had hours still, he should have–
It took two days, most of two cases of beer, and two trips out into the yard to beat the shit out of an old junker with a crowbar before they found the spell. It was in a small book of spells that Bobby explained had been given to him by a hedgewitch in Nova Scotia a couple of years earlier. There was a slightly dreamy look in Bobby’s eyes when he talked about her, and Dean decided not to ask any more questions, quickly moving along to asking Bobby about ingredients. Bobby peered down at the page, the neat writing and clear directions making Dean despair for the seven books – none of which had the decency to be written in English – that he’d spent the last couple of days struggling through.
Cold metal hit his palm, and Dean pulled all the strength remaining in his body into his arm, forcing his fingers to curl around whatever had been tossed to him. Acting on nothing but a foundationless, inexplicable trust, he used gravity and what was left of his strength to bring his hand down, slamming whatever it was into the side of the demon. The movement didn’t have enough strength behind it, shouldn’t have managed to damage the demon at all, even if it was capable of being harmed by mortal weapons, but whatever it was slid inside the demon without resistance. Dean’s eyes were just open enough to watch its eyes, turned towards whoever had yelled Dean’s name, crackle through with red lightning, watched as it traveled across its entire face, down under the collar of its shirt and then across its arms. When the lightning had faded completely, the demon slowly slumped to the side, falling off of Dean, limp like it was somehow
he repeated to himself.
know him, and how much she saw through his bullshit, but didn’t lose the look of concern hovering at the edges of her expression.
maybe, or
“Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica,” he said, taking a bitter satisfaction from the way the demon began to shake, the strange, sibilant noise of its anger getting louder and louder, though they were now accompanied by hurt exhalations of pain. “Ergo, omnis legio diabolica, adiuramus te... cessa decipere humanas creaturas, eisque æternæ perditionìs,” he continued. From the corner of his eye, the demon abruptly stilled. Dean looked up before he could think better of it to see the demon looking down at something on the floor, a slowly widening smile splitting its face in two. Dean’s gaze followed its own, and he only had half a second to register the swirl of chalk mixing with spilled holy water at the edge of the devil’s trap before an invisible force was slamming into him, sending him flying backwards until he crashed into one of the concrete pillars holding up the ceiling. His entire body screamed with pain as that same invisible force kept him in place. Only managing to keep his eyes open through sheer force of will, Dean watched as what remained of the devil’s trap flamed out of existence as the demon stepped through it like it was nothing, like it had never been there at all.
Dean glanced around one final time before he bent to pick the lock. He only needed a couple of seconds, metal scratching against metal, until he heard a familiar click and was standing and slipping into the building. Inside was silent and dark, the space filled with that hollow feeling unique to empty buildings; a combination of instinct and experience letting him know that there was no one else there. He looked towards the back of the room but didn’t bother walking any deeper inside of the building, instead turning and walking towards the bank of candles that lay to the left of the front doors. Ignoring the matches provided, Dean took out his old silver lighter instead, rubbing his thumb over the initials carved into the side for a long minute. Shaking his head, he picked out a candle to light. The flame of the votive flickered slightly when he put it back, a single glowing point in the darkness. Dean stared at it for a long minute before closing his eyes. He still didn’t believe in God, maybe believed even less than he had before Sam disappeared, but something about doing this whenever he had a chance, lighting a candle and sending a prayer to the Virgin Mary to watch over his brother, made him feel better. Maybe just because he knew Sam had believed, that he’d smile at Dean if he was here to watch him do this. For a second Dean could swear he heard his brother’s voice echoing in his head, the happy lilt to his words, the way he’d tease Dean for this if he could see it. The pain in Dean’s chest was almost physical, and he sucked in a deep breath, eyes still closed. Letting it out slowly, he repeated the prayer a final time. Opening his eyes, he blinked down at the candle, the flame wavering in an unseen draft, reflecting off the glass column that held it, before finally turning and walking away.
The monster was huge, almost the size of a horse, and it stalked towards him on feet capped with thick, black claws, grinding into the rock with every step. The white fur that covered most of its body would probably be a perfect disguise for the winter landscape if it weren’t currently contrasted with the dull grey of the rocks surrounding them instead, thick and matted in places with what might be mud, or old blood. It smelt like rotting meat in a way that made Sam wonder how it was ever able to stalk its prey, though he supposed it didn’t matter if something smelled it coming if it could move faster than them, if it could easily catch up with them and rip out their throat no matter how far or fast they ran. He figured the only reason he hadn’t smelled it earlier was thanks to the wind sliding around the side of the mountain, coming from Sam’s back and pushing the creature’s scent away from him. Proximity drove it into his nostrils though, and Sam had to fight the instinctive urge to gag. Watching how it moved forward, Sam quickly became certain that his hypothesis was correct – it could easily outpace him, the slow roll of muscles beneath fur revealing just how strong it was, its legs sturdy and thick with the promise of motion. It hadn’t used that strength, that speed yet though, was still continuing its slow walk forwards towards Sam. Its tail, thick and shaggy like a wolf, thin and long like a rat, was whipping back and forth behind it, sending scatters of stones falling whenever it hit against the rock wall.
“Huh,” Dean said, deciding to put that in the pile of things to think more about later. “Okay, well. Thanks, I guess. For saving me. Again.” Castiel didn’t move, but somehow managed to look even more uncomfortable.
Now that he was here though, it was impossible to avoid the reality that Katerina was going to see him with his shirt off, see the mess of bruises and clumsy stitches that covered his waist, done with one eye swollen shut and dizzy with blood loss. It wasn’t anything she hadn’t seen before, and it was a hundred times better for her to see it than it would have been if he’d picked up a civilian, having to make up a story that would explain the injuries in a way that wouldn’t freak them out. It also meant that she would know what it represented though, the wounds saying more about the decisions he’d been making, the kind of hunts he’d been going on, than his words ever would. It meant that she would worry, and probably tell Ellen, and Ellen would tell Bobby, and all of them would keep worrying about him without ever saying it to him, just keep giving him those
“Dean, Dean, Dean,” it said, nudging at the freshly broken bone with one of its feet. “This is just sad. Don’t you realize you’re already dead?” Dean finally got his knife free of the sheath, his hand shaking with pain and blood loss. The demon kicked it out of Dean’s hand, uncaring of the way that it sliced deep into its foot as it did, seeming not to notice as something in Dean’s hand snapped. With that same foot, the demon nudged at Dean’s side, forcing another choked noise from his broken lungs. Pain rocketed through his body, so fast and sharp he couldn’t think through it, couldn’t do anything but try and blink back the darkness encroaching on his vision. He watched, helpless, as the demon stepped over him, planting one of its feet beside each of Dean’s hips. It stared down at him, a horrible mockery of a grin on its face.
“You should be more careful,” he said, and Dean’s hands flexed at his sides.
cw: reference to past suicidal ideation
he thought again, smiling to himself as he reached the door. Or rather, when he reached where the door should have been. He jerked to a halt, just in time to hear the sharp indrawn breath of the kids behind him as they saw his flashlight beam hit the blank wall.
The specter’s eyes flared red, and in a whisper it was standing inches in front of Sam’s face. Sam stared into its eyes without blinking, letting it take in how calm he was even as he began to release his power up out of his core into the rest of him.
“After you,” he said, and followed her back down into the pit below.
“That was a dirty trick you pulled earlier,” the demon continued. “Tricking me into the trap like that.” It tutted, its grin gleeful in a way it hadn’t been before, not even when it had been taunting him about Sam. “You were probably just afraid that you couldn’t take me in a fair fight, right?” It reached out towards him, and Dean couldn’t even flinch away from its touch as it ran its fingers down the side of his face, eyes gentle and searching as it stared into Dean’s. It leaned in, its breath hot against Dean’s cheek as its mouth brushed against Dean’s ear.
She shrugged again, but didn’t say anything else, just nodded when Dean thanked her before standing. She paused, giving him one last considering look, before placing one hand heavily on her shoulder and closing her eyes, speaking under her breath and so quickly that Dean was barely able to catch what she said.
“I don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about,” he said, “but you’re going to tell me how I can find my brother.” He splashed the demon again, uncaring of the amount this time, watching with an ugly sense of satisfaction as the water covered its face and chest, making the demon scream. He couldn’t help but smile at its obvious pain, at the way it desperately panted for breath as the air between them slowly cleared of the steam coming off of its meatsuit. The demon snarled at him, it’s face finally contorting into an expression as monstrous as the thing inside of it.
the voice said.
Thanks so much Helen for the beta!!
He wanted nothing more than to collapse on the ground, but he forced himself to walk forwards instead, looking down over the edge of the rock. Far below he could just see the mangled and broken corpse of the monster, body turned to nothing more than a sack full of meat and bones against the rocks, speared straight through by the tree it had come to rest upon. It was almost certainly dead, but Sam still reached out with his mind, a thin tendril of power winding down the mountainside, sending it snaking through the creature until it found its still and already cooling heart. Sam released the vision, staggered back a few steps from the edge before finally allowing his knees to buckle beneath him. His one arm was a mangled mess beneath his sleeve, and he knew if he didn’t address it soon he was going to pass out from blood loss. He ignored it though, instead using his undamaged arm to sweep clear the stretch of rock in front of his knees. Gritting his teeth, he dipped two of his fingers into the bloody holes left in the parka by the monster’s black teeth, coating his fingers in his own blood before pulling them back out and beginning to draw on the ground before him. His vision was beginning to waver by the time he finished the final stroke, and he could only hope he’d managed to do it correctly, blinking slowly as he pushed his hand entirely inside the sleeve of his parka.
. He glanced over at the dead man whose legs Alex’s body was still partially crumpled over to see that a civilian had approached while he’d been busy inspecting Alex, a woman who was now kneeling in the pool of blood, headless of what it was doing to her dress. Her hands hovered nervously above the man as if she couldn’t decide whether she should touch or not, and she was crying, silent and soft but shaking with it all the same.
Suddenly Dean couldn’t breath again, couldn’t move, couldn’t do anything but watch and wait as Bobby repeated the same words as before, throwing Ian’s name in this time. The match dropped, fragile wood slipping from between calloused fingers, and somehow it felt like it took longer to fall this time, the herbs taking impossibly long to catch. Dean felt he was moving through something thick and viscous as his eyes slowly moved from the flames licking above the rim of the bowl to the map below which had again caught fire except– except now it actually was burning, from the outside edges in, same as it had with John. This time though, the flames raced across the paper evenly, without hesitation, devouring and starving for each drop of ink, each twist of a river and winding curve of a mountain range.
“We need to go,” he said.
“Fine,” he said, letting resignation shift to anger in his voice, turning on his heel and stalking towards the front door. He could hear the teenagers following after him, watching to make sure he left.

he said.
“So you think he somehow made a door disappear?” the boy asked. “Kyle, c’mon.”
It took less than a minute for Dean to close the distance between himself and the truck, and as he drew closer he realized it wasn’t so much parked as it was stopped; halfway on and halfway off of the sidewalk as if Alex hadn’t had the time, or ability, to park it properly. Dean walked around the front of the truck to look into the open door. The first thing to catch his attention were the keys, still hanging in the ignition, followed quickly by the empty glass bottle sitting on the driver’s seat, another one resting in the footwell of the passenger’s side. He picked up the one from the driver’s seat, tipping it until a single clear drop finally shook itself free to land on his finger. He licked it.
“You sticking around or just passing through?” she asked as she handed it to him. Her eyes narrowed as she examined the bruising on his face.
“You’re
He didn’t look back at the body as he crossed the room to where his backpack was shoved in the corner, got dressed in what little light was leaking in around the curtains pulled over the room’s sole window. This far away from the body, the scent of death was replaced with other, only slightly less unpleasant smells: rotting garbage, piss, the rank stench of unwashed humans. Sam grimaced as he tugged on one of his few remaining clean shirts, sniffing to make sure that the smell hadn’t permeated it’s threads at least. Despite the fact that it was shoved in the same bag as his dirty clothes however, it luckily smelt of nothing more than dry canvas and the faintest whisper of laundry detergent. He’d have to do laundry soon though, which meant he was either going to have to come up with some money, or break into a house. Neither option was ideal, both presenting their own special opportunities for disaster. He couldn’t afford to draw attention to himself, not right now. He glanced back towards the body as he tucked his shirt into his jeans, then bent and shoved everything that had scattered out onto the floor back into his backpack: some dirty shirts, a sheath bereft of it’s knife, and an unlabelled bottle of pills that he stopped to frown at, shaking them and watching the small unmarked white ovals rattle around, a few larger green and yellow ones disrupting the hegemony of the bottle. He opened the lid, tipping two of the white ones out and staring at them for a long moment before finally mentally shrugging and swallowing them both dry. Throwing the bottle in the backpack, he zipped it shut before picking up his worn brown canvas jacket, standing and pulling it on as he walked back to the bed. He kept his eyes on the woman as he reached under his pillow and pulled out his gun, tucking it into the back of his jeans in a movement that was more muscle memory than anything. There were no marks on her body, nothing to indicate how she died. Not even any bruising. His eyes flicked around the room as he walked around the bed to get closer to her, but there was nothing there that hadn’t been there when he’d arrived the previous night, just the detritus of whoever had been squatting there before him, empty bottles and fast food wrappers. Next to the other graffiti that covered the walls, the red spray paint of his warding hardly even managed to change the place. Crouching, he ran his eyes over her from the other side, but there was nothing more to see than what he’d already observed. He reached out, ran a finger down the same path his eyes had just travelled, from the high peak of her cheekbone, down her neck, her chest, her stomach, stopping just below her hip. He tapped the skin there once, twice. It was still so soft, smooth, perfect.
“That was about John and not you,” he said. “You know Bobby’s never had anything but love for you boys.” Dean shrugged, uncomfortable, and watched as Jim shot him an exasperated look.
“Don’t lie to me,” Dean said, taking the cap off the water bottle. The demon glanced at it again, and this time Dean was vindictively happy to see a flash of fear, or at least dread, slide over its face.
“Yeah she is,” Ellen said, before leaning in, a serious expression crossing her face. “Are you doing okay Dean?” Her eyes flicked back to the bruises covering his face. Dean gave her his best grin.
“Yeah,” she said, “I could have.” Sam rolled his eyes, but had to fight the urge to smile back at her. The thought of why she would have felt the need to warn him quickly cut through the amusement, though, and he carefully met her eyes when he spoke next.
“So another hunter beat you there,” one of the other hunters said. The hunter shook his head.
“Sorry,” Dean said, and Rick shook his head.
. He’d probably gone maybe a couple hundred meters, and there was still at least five miles to go until he would breach the treeline proper. Gritting his teeth, he put his head down and forced his legs to keep moving, keep pushing forwards, snow churning around his thighs. He’d had his arms hanging loose along his sides when he’d started walking, but as he kept moving, kept pushing forward, he found himself raising them to hug around himself, tucking his hands into his armpits in a hopeless attempt to keep the wind from penetrating his skin, needling down to his bones. He supposed he should be grateful that he’d been provided with as much protection as he had been – the boots were warm, and dry, and he’d been allowed two pairs of thick wool socks. Long johns, jeans, and a waterproof shell protected his legs from the worst of the wind, while a heavy sweater layered over a long-sleeved undershirt and under the heavy parka protected his torso and arms. The mittens over his hands were warm as well, and lined with fur, though he was already dreading needing to take them off later. He found himself wishing for a hat or snow goggles, but quickly dismissed the thought.
“It’ll get better,” she said finally, and Sam looked down at his hands, rubbing the tattoos on the back of each, feeling the ache of them that had been getting worse and worse lately, the ghost of the blood that had covered them so often.
he said, clearly relishing the reveal despite his earlier indifference. Dean raised an eyebrow at him.
some small, shocked and numb part of his brain thought, and his stomach rolled. Swallowing harshly, he shoved the thought down.
but Raoul made a good burger.
Despite his lecture to himself, Dean still went to sleep that night with a tight clench of nerves in the pit of his stomach, the foreboding feeling of something being wrong making sleep difficult to find. He woke up early too, blinking awake after far too little time spent asleep, the grey pre-dawn light just barely visible through the gap in the curtain, his eyes gritty and blurry with sleep. He rolled over with a groan, burying his head in a pillow, but after lying there for another hour he gave in to the reality that he wouldn’t be getting any more sleep. Instead, he dragged himself out of bed. If he was going to be awake anyways, he could at least go get some food and head out into the desert before it got too hot out. Stretching with a groan, he picked up his phone, not realizing just how much he was hoping to see a message from Alex waiting for him until the disappointment of the blank screen – no texts, no missed calls – crashed over him. Swearing, he tossed his phone down before getting up, pulling on his standard uniform of jeans, heavy work boots, a shirt, and a plaid button-up on top of that. Gun in the waistband, knife in its sheath, Dean decided to walk over to the diner he’d gone past the day before, just past the old church, and see what they had in the way of breakfast. The air was still cool when he let himself out of the door, and he felt himself settling more and more into his skin as he walked, breathing deep and letting the silence and stillness of the early morning centre him, drag him into complete alertness despite his exhaustion. He nodded to the priest who was standing just outside of the church, waiting for his congregants to arrive. The man nodded back to him, watching Dean walk past with curious eyes.
Dean thought bitterly, but he didn’t say anything more, just nodded and turned and headed back to Alex’s truck.
When Alex lunged forward, it was with an abruptness that made it so much more obvious how quickly the ways in which his body was contorting itself were travelling away from what was natural, what was human. There was no tensing of the muscles, no preparing to move; just Alex, standing, and then Alex, moving, the motion twisting and jerking his limbs like he suddenly had far more joints than he’d had before. The congregants had continued to move away from him, but it was a dense crowd, and those at the outside edges, out of sight and with no idea what was happening, were less quick to move, getting in the way of those closest to the centre. They were still so near him, had nowhere to go. By the time Dean finally cleared the crowd and drew his gun, decades of training and experience overriding his shock and horror at seeing what had happened to Alex, Alex had already traversed the remaining distance between him and the crowd. He wasn’t quite fast enough though, was still raising the gun to aim it when Alex slammed into the nearest civilian, sending both him and the man to the ground as he ripped into the man’s throat with his open mouth, jaw finally closing with a sickening crunch, wet and tearing.
“Of course,” she said, “I’m happy to help.” She gestured towards the chairs in front of her desk and Dean sat, allowing himself to relax into a familiar lazy sprawl. The woman – Vicky, according to the small name tag pinned to her shirt – gave him another quick once-over before she turned back to her computer. “So, what happened?” she asked as she clicked around. Dean plasted a wry smile on his mouth.
it said.
,” he finally said, but there was no one there to answer him.
A force slammed into Sam’s stomach, sending him skittering back across the room until his back once again hit the wall, driving the breath from his lungs and sending pain spiking up his back and into his skull, where it remained, pounding and inescapable.

he said.
There was nothing living left on the wide clearing in front of him, though judging by the blood still slowly sliding down the surface of rocks, dripping off of the trees, that hadn’t been the case for very long. If it weren’t for the shreds of orange coats, the bloodstained cloud of feathers scattered all around, he wasn’t sure he would have recognized the bodies for humans. They were torn apart so completely that there weren’t even the skeletons remaining to identify them as such, though he did spot half a skull almost completely buried in a drift of snow. It was like they had been put through a meat grinder, viscera scattered everywhere, bones snapped easily into shards that stuck out of the snow, appearing from between rocks like the first flowers of spring, blooming red and hot out of the white powder. The level of destruction was almost impressive in its complete obliteration. There was still steam coming off of the cooling bodies, and Sam would guess that they hadn’t been dead for more than twenty minutes, if that. Whatever had done this would still be nearby then, and his back twinged in pain as he tensed up at the realization. The scene was bloody enough, covered in enough remaining meat and organs that he had to wonder if whatever had killed what had been, based on the boots he was able to spot, two hikers had even eaten any of them, or if had torn them apart for the mere sport of it, for the pleasure and thrill of the kill enough for whatever had done it. There was no way to know for sure unless he went through the remains to see if there was anything in particular missing though, and Sam had no desire, nor the time, to do any such thing. It would be messy, and was unlikely to give him any more information than what he already had. Instead, Sam cast another wary eye around him. He spotted two backpacks leaned neatly up against a tree, and realized that the two humans must have stopped for a break when the monster had found them.

could escape. Years of training had ensured that he had kept his grip on his gun even while being thrown across the room like a ragdoll, so at least he still had that on him, he just had to–
“Katerina’s off soon, yeah?” he asked, and heard a snort from behind him, though by the time he turned around Ellen’s face had been schooled into a carefully neutral expression.
“You really have no idea what’s happening do you?” it asked. Dean kept his face blank, but he couldn’t exactly counter the demon’s observation with anything concrete, and that just made it laugh again. “Oh, this is delicious,” it said. “The angel’s greatest prize and you have no clue what’s ahead.” Dean blinked, fingers unconsciously flexing on the water bottle at the demon’s reference to the angels.
Sam thought as the sound of someone laughing loudly drew his attention back to the people moving through the house above him. He needed to hurry.
This time, Dean managed to catch ahold of Bobby’s wrist before his palm made contact with Dean’s face. Dean didn’t say anything, just stared at Bobby, feeling his entire body beginning to shake.
was, and the priest didn’t ask, just nodded.
Thanks again to Eliza for continuing to beta!
“Yeah,” he finally said, picking the conversation back up. “And like you said, I deserved it.”
“Dean,” the angel said, voice serious. “Can you stand?” Dean pushed himself up, grimacing when he realized the demon was still lying slumped over, half on top of him. He kicked it away, stumbling to his feet and frowning down at the body when it didn’t move.
The bored front desk clerk took his credit card without even glancing at the name on it, and it was only a handful of minutes more before Dean was once again blinking in the sunlight. Grabbing his bag from the Impala, he walked through the tiled courtyard to the room matching the number on the key he’d been handed. The room, once he got inside of it, wasn’t much cooler than outside, but it was dark, and Dean let out a long breath of relief as his eyes adjusted to the lack of light. Throwing his bag towards the single bed, Dean didn’t stop, just kicked off his shoes and began tugging off the rest of his clothing, leaving them strewn across the floor of the room on his way to the shower. The first touch of cold water against his skin was the best kind of shock, and Dean braced his hands against the wall and breathed deeply as he let the water wash the dirt of the road from his body. As he showered he ran back over what Alex had told him on the phone. It hadn’t been much, admittedly: twelve missing people in three years – though four of those had come in the last month when a family of two parents and two children had disappeared – and local legends that talked about something called
Despite the theatrics, they both made it all the way down to the bottom of the stairs without incident. Their flashlights still didn’t seem to penetrate the darkness the way they should have, like the shadows had their own weight, a viscosity that the light was struggling to push its way through. A feeling of wrongness crawled across Sam’s skin, putting him on edge. For the first time, he could truly feel the presence of the spirit that occupied the house, its energy settling in the room like a fog, cloaking and infusing everything it touched. It was powerful, not enough to be truly dangerous to Sam but enough that he wasn’t able to resist calling just a little of his own power to the surface, a comfort and a precaution both. Despite the overwhelming feeling of dread filling the basement, they hadn’t yet seen anything, and Jason walked further into the room, Sam trailing after him. Jason was keeping his flashlight level, sweeping from side to side. It seemed like they’d already walked further than they should have been able to without seeing a wall, without seeing anything, but there was nothing around them, just empty air and hard packed dirt below. Sam glanced over his shoulder, and the realization that he couldn’t see the stairs sent real fear spiking through his gut for the first time. He quickly shoved it down, rolling his eyes at himself. He was still the most dangerous thing in this house, he reminded himself. Even if the other things in the basement with him might disagree. Turning back around, his flashlight hit Jason’s back. All at once, both their lights flickered once, twice, and then went out, the white glow of Jason’s shirt immediately eaten by the complete darkness.
“I think she said he had long brown hair,” he said finally. “I asked for her to be more specific about the scars but she was too freaked out to remember any details.” Dean leaned back in his chair, heart still racing despite himself. It was a stretch on multiple levels, but there was something about the story that was tugging at every instinct he had.
It was a simple spell really, in the end. It felt almost like it should have been more complicated, for how long it had taken them to find it, for the importance of what it was being used for. Dean couldn’t help but feel like it was somewhat anticlimactic as he spread out one of the two maps of the continental United States that he’d scavenged from the gloveboxes of some of the junkers outside. There should have been something to mark how important this was, how the information that he was about to learn would either heal him or wound him beyond repairing, beyond hope and sanity. It seemed ridiculous that all it would take was a small bowl of herbs, a six line chant, and a dropped match for Dean to find out whether or not he really existed as a person anymore.
that was the last thing Sam had ever said to their dad, the sight of him walking up the steps of the bus, not even glancing back at Dean before he disappeared into the night in a growl of diesel and fading red taillights. Dean had spent the next couple of months waiting for a text, a call, anything, but as the weeks went by he had slowly let go of those expectations. Sam had chosen, he’d tried to tell himself, and he hadn’t chosen Dean. Simple as that.
“Ready?” Bobby asked, making him jump slightly.
“We should search the house,” Sam said, shrinking back when the group again turned towards him.
“We’re trapped,” one of the boys helpfully offered.
“John?” he asked, and Dean shook his head again.
He hadn’t been given a gun, just the long machete that currently hung atop his parka in a sheath running half the length of his spine, and the twin blades strapped to his thighs, high enough that getting at them with the parka on would be a struggle. He’d thought the fact that all of the clothing was a dark, mottled brown was an obvious trap when he’d first realized where he was, had bristled at how exposed he’d be, how much he’d stand out against the endless blank canvas of the snowy plane. Headed towards the line of brown tree trunks in the distance though, he could see how they could help hide him instead, help keep him from turning from the hunter into the hunted.
The stairs were long, narrow, and sank downwards into a pool of darkness. Sam and Jason stood side by side looking down the steps for a long moment, then glanced at each other, Jason’s wide eyes meeting Sam’s own. His gaze flicked down at Sam’s hand, still pointing his flashlight down towards the darkness before them. The beam didn’t seem to go as far as it should, the light yellow and weak against the thick shadows below.
“Fuck,” he said, raising his gun again and pointing it at the group, holding the flashlight up alongside it. Chrissy screamed again, though shorter this time, her hands flying up to clap over her own mouth, thank god. “Move away from the stairs,” he said, walking slowly across the room. They obeyed instantly, though they moved in a slow shuffle, Kyle putting himself in front of the group like the idiot he was, arms spread protectively. Like that would do anything, even if Sam had just been an ordinary man with a gun. Sam ran his eyes over all their faces. They all looked equally shocked and scared.

While his hand was still free, Sam bent over and picked up a handful of clean, fresh snow, putting it into his mouth and letting it melt on his tongue until he could swallow the water. He ate two more handfuls before he brushed his hand off on the outside of his parka and pulled the mitten back on. Looking around himself, he decided to keep heading upwards, towards the peak of the mountain. It was as good of a direction as any other, and the high ground did hold the potential of affording him some perspective that he wasn’t able to grasp while he was still down here, buried within the body of the forest at the base on the mountain. Taking a deep breath, he began to walk.
“You, me, Vegas,” he said. “Just saying. I’m ready whenever you are, baby.”
“–and I’m
Helen stays the best, etc. etc. wow was this a long one.
he told the voice that was screaming at him with the confirmation of just how completely he had failed his brother.
chapter explores how Sam was shaped into Hell’s weapon by Azazel, including physical and psychological torture, interspersed with memories (both real and false) of his childhood with Dean. Culminating incident is a hallucination that leads to him killing a young teenager, at which point Azazel is able to convince him that he is fundamentally evil, and always has been.
“We’re just helping him fulfil his destiny,” it said. “We all need to be ready for the war to come, for the Puer Regem to rise up and carve Heaven into pieces until the screams of the heavenly host makes the rivers and oceans and lakes boil dry.” Dean took a deep breath, the mess in his chest beginning to coalesce into pure anger. He was tired of being talked in circles.
Sam thought to himself, but predictably that was not the consensus reached by the group. Instead, Nicole eventually split away from everyone else, walking over to Sam as the others slowly stopped talking.
“Yeah,” he said. “Well. A lot of things would be different if he hadn’t caught me.” He didn’t know if he was talking about now or then, but he supposed it didn’t matter. Past, present, future: in all versions of reality, he had been caught, would be caught again. As he loved to tell Sam, over and over again, it was destiny, Sam’s fate to be caught, a preordained and inescapable doom. Sam glanced at Merihem, just in time to catch the face she made, somewhere between humour and sadness, and knew she was thinking of the same thing. Sam let his expression mirror hers as he turned back towards the ballroom, a dark and pained amusement at the absurdity of his attempts at defiance, the small, stupid part of him that still struggled against the inevitable. The silence that settled between them was comfortable, even if it was still choked with so many things left unsaid, empty platitudes begging to be released, stifled under the threat that the truth might accidentally slip loose among them.

“Jim,” he said in return. “How are you?”
and–”
“Fine,” Dean finally spat out, trying to ignore the way the word trembled in the air between them. “If you won’t tell me anything, I’ll just find someone else who will.” The demon’s eyes were still narrowed, fixed unerringly on Dean’s face even as he pulled a slip of paper from his pocket, Bobby’s writing swimming in front of his eyes for a long second before he forced himself to focus.Taking a deep breath, he began to read:
“No,” she admitted, keeping her arms crossed as she looked at him. Sam set down the plate, regarding her in turn.
The long pillars of the rock outcropping formed a near perfect circle inside which Dean stood, the shadows making the space unexpectedly cool despite the midday sun hanging high above them in the sky. The space wasn’t large, but it was dense with plants, making it seem both smaller and larger than it actually was. There had to be a water source somewhere within the rocks, a spring or something like it, though Dean couldn’t immediately see it amongst the greenery. He could smell it though, and could see where the liquid had soaked through the dirt, turning the ground thick and muddy. There were clear footprints here, but Dean didn’t need footprints anymore to tell him that he’d found the right spot, not with the slab of white rock rising up out of the mud and plants. There was something about it that made Dean’s brain
A short chapter this week! When I started this fic, I didn't want it to end up being too long, so my goal for each chapter was actually for them to be about this length.... as you can tell, that's really going well for me.
“If my Dad’s dead it won’t work,” Dean finished. “I know. And I know I probably–” Dean broke off, voice cracking slightly, and he cleared his throat as Bobby looked away. “I know I probably won’t ever find him,” he said. “But I just need to know, for sure.” Bobby nodded, looked down at the piece of paper in his hand.
Even from a distance, Alex looked terrible – his skin ashen and eyes bloodshot. His jeans and shirt were covered in what looked like it might have been dried mud, and Dean could see where sweat had soaked through the grey shirt he was wearing at his collar, his armpits, plastering his thick dark hair to the curve of his skull. Alex’s eyes passed over Dean. For a second, Dean thought that Alex had spotted him, but his head kept turning, and Dean realized that he hadn’t seen even a flicker of recognition pass through the other man’s eyes. Swearing under his breath, he began picking his way through the crowd to where Alex had now stilled, staying in one place despite being buffeted back and forth by the civilians, still shaking, shoulders hunching and limbs bending and unbending in abrupt shocks of movement.
“Nah, I think I’m done for the night.” Ellen looked surprised, and he didn’t blame her. He’d spent more than one night in the Roadhouse getting so drunk he couldn’t stand, and with the promise of the use of the cot in the back, that was normally exactly what he’d have done tonight. But the other hunters' stories had put him on edge, set something humming under his skin, making him want to run, to get into his baby and gun it down the highway, burning rubber to the sound of Bon Scott telling him exactly where he was going. Drinking wouldn’t help with that particular urge, and at this point it was too late, he was too tired, to run the way his body was telling him to.
He reaches into the inside of his jacket, takes ahold of the handle of his favourite knife, safely stowed in the sheith he’d sewed into the jacket lining, drawing it slowly. He could always use his gun instead, loaded and ready against his back, but there was something about using his knife in this moment that held far greater appeal. Some petty, jealous urge to cause as much damage to this picture perfect home, this family that everything that Sam had never been allowed. Not that they would have it anymore, after tonight, Sam the spark that would ignite their world and burn it to ash around their screaming faces. He smiled, a jerky, unnatural expression as he paused just outside of the dining room, adjusting his grip on the knife. He could see a reflection of the room in the glass of a picture hung on the wall he could see in his shallow field of vision, the small family still arranged the same way as they had been earlier, the father’s back to Sam. Perfect. Sam took a deep breath and stepped around the corner, the boy not even noticing him, the woman barely having time to do anything more than widen her eyes in sudden fear before he was taking two quick steps across the room, grabbing the man by his hair and dragging his blade across his throat, arterial blood splattering across his wife and child as he died with nothing more than a strangled gurgle. Sam let go of his hair and the man slumped forward. He ignored him, absently wiping his knife off on the back of his shirt as shock finally gave way to understanding, and to terror.
“Hey,” Dean said, raising his free hand towards her. She turned to look at him, her face streaked with tears and full of sorrow. “You need to move back,” he said, then cursed when she just stared at him.

.” Bobby nodded, expression unchanging.
Like Alex, like the people in town, her mouth was an open wound, a mess of blood and rot, toothless and mushy with decay that had started long before death. He avoided looking at her eyes, instead scanning down her body. There was a wound on the arm that had been lying beneath her body, huge and tearing and Dean’s mind shied away from acknowledging what it was, what would have caused it. He knew, of course, knew what it meant for what had happened to this family, how this girl had died, what she had seen and felt before death had claimed her. Gently laying her back in the dirt, he went to check the other bodies. The boy was the one nearest to his sister, so Dean checked him first. He was older but still so fucking young, though he was lying face up, so at least Dean didn’t have to turn him over. A quick visual inspection confirmed his suspicions – the boy’s mouth had also turned into a hollow, hungry cavern, though the bite that had infected him had been taken out of his shoulder, his shirt torn and stiff with dried blood. The mother, crumpled against the base of the wall opposite, told a similar story, including the placement of the bite, though it looked like she had been more… chewed on, meat missing from her arm and chest as well as from the initial bite, the source of her infection.
“He’s going to kill you dude, get
“Why, wh–” Dean started, but that was all he got out before Castiel turned back to him and put his hand on his shoulder.
Dean let out a long, relieved breath as he carefully drew out the blocks of C-4 that had been packed at the bottom of the trunk. There was a detonator too, and he pocketed that before climbing back down from the truck bed. He found a backpack in the back seat of the truck, and filled it with the blocks of C-4 along with the rest of the holy water before heading back to the rocks. He didn’t waste any more time, just began setting up the explosives around the edge of the circle, avoiding only the stretch directly behind the rock, where the vegetation was thickest and he would have to get within a few feet of it to place the blocks. The itch to go to it rose up in his brain a couple times, but throwing holy water at it seemed to make the urge subside, and he managed to finish with only a few false starts towards his own doom. He hesitated once he finished though, and after a moment’s debate went back to the bodies, pulling them to the centre of the circle and arranging them in a row on their backs, eyes shut. It wasn’t enough but nothing ever could be, and it was the best he could do. He glanced around one final time before heading out of the rock circle. He had no idea what the range was on the detonator, no idea what the safe distance was for him to be, but he figured he’d start from behind the truck, and get closer only if he needed to.
“Okay,” he said to himself. “Okay, okay, you’re okay. You’ve got this,” he said, pulling his phone out and setting up the GPS before shifting the truck into drive and pulling out onto the road, making a u-turn away from the church. “You’ve got this,” he said again as he turned north.
she said.
“Dean…” Jim started, but didn’t finish. It didn’t really matter. Dean could guess how that sentence was going to end either way.
“Oh no, I’m all on board for that now, you’re an angel of the Lord, sure, whatever. Why the fuck are you attuned to my soul? What do you mean that you’ve been commanded to save me?” Castiel stared back at him but didn’t speak, the silence stretching on for so long that Dean was certain that he wasn’t going to answer at all. He was trying to figure out what question to try throwing at the reticent angel next when Castiel finally broke the silence stretching between them.
“Samuel Winchester,” Dean said. Vicky looked back at him.
echoing in the back of his head, the familiar baritone of his father’s voice.
“Yes,” Castiel responded, still avoiding looking at Dean.
“No need to get all mushy on me now boy,” he said, tossing a book at Dean’s face as if to emphasize the point. Dean half smiled as he looked down at the large book now in his hands. “Now, that’s a book of spells Penny – do you remember Penny?” Bobby didn’t give Dean any time to respond before he continued, “Penny got it off a witch in Mexico back in, oh, would have been around ‘86?” Bobby looked off towards the ceiling, forehead wrinkled in thought before he looked back at Dean. “How’s your Spanish these days?” he asked.
The demon was watching him carefully now, eyes flicking across Dean’s face, searching his reactions.
“–eye,” Dean finished, voice flat. “Yeah, I remember him.”
“We should check the other doors,” one of the girls interjected, and that suggestion managed to draw the attention of the whole group. There was a long moment of silence as the teenagers glanced nervously at each other. When no one argued, the girl who had spoken turned and led the way back to the main room, long white braids almost glowing in the darkness as they swung behind her. The other girl rushed after her, speaking to her quickly but under her breath, not loud enough for Sam to catch it. There was a confusion of arguments and hushed speculation as they dispersed through the main room, half the teenagers still eyeing Sam nervously even as they grabbed lamps and flashlights from among their backpacks and sleeping bags. They only hesitated for a moment though, before they all headed off without any further discussion. The two girls went off as a pair, but two of the boys went off on their own, and Sam couldn’t help but stare after them in shocked incredulity.
Dean said, eyes turning helplessly towards the two other bodies lying on the road.
“Come on,” she said, leading him back through the bar.
Dean asked, and the woman shook her head before tapping her temple. Turning, she called the waitress back over, before sitting down in the chair across from Dean. She grabbed the waitress’ pad and paper when she got to the table, waving the other woman back off towards the one other customer in the diner without looking up. The younger woman rolled her eyes behind María’s back, but walked away without argument.
“No,” she said shortly. Dean worried at the edge of the label on his bottle with his thumbnail.
Dean thought as he looked at the piece of paper, slightly singed at the edges, and the smudged blue words on it labelling the town of Red Oak.
“You don’t think you deserve to be saved,” Castiel finally said, voice wondering, which didn’t really answer Dean’s question.
“That’s what I’m afraid of,” he whispered. After a minute, he felt fingertips on his temple, and turned his head to meet Merhiem’s eyes as she brushed his hair back, tucking it behind his ear. Her expression was again unreadable as she stared at him before finally dropping her hand, climbing back to her feet. She held out a hand. Sam stared at it for a long second before sighing, taking a hold of it with his undamaged right arm and letting her pull him to his feet.
“And we’re supposed to just trust some random guy?” Kyle shot back, and the teenagers began speaking over each other, the conversation rapidly devolving into confusion as they drew together into a tighter circle.
He lay where he was for a long moment, staring into her sightless eyes, the white film of death obscuring whatever colour they had been in life. She had been dead long enough for rigour mortis to set in, her body unmoving even when he shifted on the mattress, rolling onto his side to get a better look at her, but not long enough for her to begin to rot, the stale smell of death thankfully not yet tinged with the scent of purifying organs beginning their slow journey towards becoming nothing more than a slurry of meat and liquid. Her dark hair was sprayed out over the pillow, the chaotic tumble of curls strangely reminiscent of a spreading pool of blood and viscera, and he spent a long minute staring at it until he was certain that it was nothing more than hair. When he glanced down he saw that she was clothed, though the thin peach coloured bra and panty set did little to grant her any modesty in death. It made it sadder somehow, than if she had been naked, the small amount of fabric affording no real protection, revealing the vulnerability of having a body, that nothing you put on yourself can save you from the inevitability of something crawling inside you and tearing your insides bloody. Sam looked at her for another breath, two, three, then reached out and gently shut the lids of her eyes. It didn’t make it better, but it didn’t make it worse either, and with a sigh he pushed himself up, getting out the other side of the bed.
Dean knew he should go back to the motel, maybe, get his car, get more supplies than just the single clip he had on him, a knife and four bottles of holy water, but he felt weirdly numb in a way that made that thought feel much less urgent than it should have. It was easier to just stick the keys into the truck’s ignition, easier to turn them and hear the familiar rumble of the truck coming to life beneath his hands. He took a deep breath, glancing into the rearview mirror. For a second he thought he saw that same man again, with his tan trenchcoat and intense gaze, but when he whipped his head around to look over his shoulder, there was no one there. He turned back, noticing for the first time that his hands were shaking slightly.
“Eat,” she said, avoiding Dean’s eyes. She didn’t wait for Dean to respond, leaving just as quickly as she’d arrived. Dean watched her retreating back for a second, before turning back to glance down at the burger and fries now sitting in front of him, then back up to see Ellen smirking at him. He looked down, fighting the urge to fidget.
He made his way quickly down the stairs, the sound of his boots hitting the floor echoing up and down the tall concrete chimney of the stairwell, a hundred running footsteps rushing after him. Pushing open the door, his eyes immediately went to where he’d set up shop lights the day before, their brightness the only source of light in the otherwise pitch black space of the former parking garage. The white lines of the devil’s trap all but glowed under the force of the two lights directed at it, the slumped form of the demon in the middle of the trap a miserable, dark lump in contrast. Dean carefully stepped over the burnt remains of the summoning spell he’d used to get the demon there, ignored the dead goat lying beside it, drained of its blood, heart long since turned to ash. Water covered the last stretch of concrete between him and the trap, splashing lightly beneath his boots—his previous supply of holy water, a victim to his chase through the darkness to get the demon into the trap. The sight of it reminded him of the blow the demon had managed to land that had caused him to drop the holy water, and his hand throbbed with the remembering. He was pretty sure that nothing was broken though, so he continued to ignore it as he stepped into the warm circle cast by the shop lights.
“No,” Sam said, “I’m not. Tell your friends to step away.”
“How did you know where I was?” he tried. “That I was in… that I needed… what was happening?” Castiel frowned at him.
Dean clenched his fists, nails digging into his palms.
“Because God commanded it,” Castiel said, voicing ringing with something new, something profound and terrible. “Because we have work for you.” Dean felt something drop in his stomach, the demon’s earlier words echoing in his head.
Sam thought, forcibly tamping down on the urge to grin at them.
“So, Sam,” Nicole said. “Why don’t you tell us what you know about this place?” Sam shrugged, affecting self-consciousness.
“But he’s alive?” Dean repeated, just so he could hear Bobby say it again.
Sam thought as he peered over a small drop, checking for any safe, hidden space beneath where it curved outwards. He spent a brief, useless minute fantasizing about warm fur wrapped directly around his flesh, long teeth and jagged claws and uncomplicated and unending hunger. For a second he swore he could almost smell fresh blood, steaming hot on the frozen ground, but when he looked around, suddenly on edge, there was nothing to be seen. Just his imagination, and the cold then. Shaking his head, Sam continued on his path. He didn’t have to go much further though– just a few meters from where he’d been standing was the fallen body of a huge tree, the grasping tangle of its roots stretching above Sam’s head. It had probably been felled in a recent storm, based on the lack of deterioration, and it was where the base of the trunk had fallen over a dip in the ground that Sam found his shelter. One side of the trunk was pressed completely flat to the ground, leaving only one side of the hollow exposed to the wider forest. The dip was maybe half as tall as he was, but it was deep enough that he would be able to push himself deep inside, effectively removing himself from the worst of the elements. Sam drew his machete, swept it into the darkest corners of the recess. Sure that there wasn’t anything else using the trunk as shelter, Sam walked further forward, until he reached the crushed and broken limbs of the tree’s branches. Putting his knife back in its sheath, Sam used brute force to rip off the dead boughs, ignoring the shower of still green needles that fell over and around him. In the last of the fading light, Sam walked back to the hollow, laying the branches down before stepping over them, going onto his hands and knees and crawling into the small space. Turning so that his back was against the protective back wall, Sam grabbed the branches and pulled them in, covering as much of the opening as he was able by wedging them between the frozen ground and the trunk of the tree, and either side of the mouth of the opening. It wasn’t perfect, probably wouldn’t provide any sort of cover during the day, but Sam was sure that it would do for the night, unless something far more dangerous, something with senses far beyond any ordinary animal, found him. There wasn’t anything more he could do than what he’d already done if that was the case though, so he settled himself tighter against the back wall, pillowing his head on one of his arms and listened to the sound of the wind rushing by outside, erasing any signs of his passage into the woods.
Pain, sharp and sudden, the crack of palm meeting skin still ringing through the air and then his wide, surprised eyes were meeting Bobby’s, alight with fear and sadness.
s/o to Helen for the beta, as always so incredibly appreciative of you screaming at me in the comments/pointing out when I've used the same word four times in two sentences.
“No seriously. When are you gonna finally leave this dump behind to run away with me?”
“I didn’t say that,” it said, and Dean splashed it with holy water again, more this time, enough to make its face twist in pain. “Fine, fine,” it said, laughing despite the steam still rising from its skin. “I’m not lying, though.” Dean moved to raise his arm, but the demon kept talking, forestalling the threat of any more holy water reaching its skin. “I don’t know where young Samael is,” it said. “Shifrat za-'iil is rather… precious about his favourite pet.” Dean’s stomach twisted, the taste of bile heavy on his tongue at the confirmation of the worst of his fears.
“Fuck,” Jason swore, turning to look at Kyle. “We need to get out of here man,” he said. Kyle shot him an annoyed look.
“Yeah ok, but we go in pairs, okay? No one should be alone.” Kyle said before walking over to one of the bags – the first one Sam had searched – digging through it before eventually emerging with an extra set of batteries, that he pocketed. Nicole and Chrissy were having a whispered conversation, while Ryan stood in the middle of the room, eyes nervously flicking from person to person. Jason had peeled off from the group at the same time as Kyle had, and Sam watched out of the corner of his eye as he walked towards the backpack that had had all the spell-making supplies. He crouched down in front of the bags, blocking what he was doing from Sam’s view, but Sam could still see when he slipped something into his pocket.
Dean thought, eyes flicking from him over to the woman sitting anxiously at one of the tables, her eyes fixed on the man’s back.
he asked instead, and the man shrugged.
“Dunno,” he said. “I asked, but the girl said there wasn’t anything about him that made her think he wasn’t human. Apparently just told her his name was Sam, walked her back to town afterwards.”
“Yeah?” the final boy asked, expression curious. “Did you find anything at the first one?” Sam winced.
“I told you not to call me that,” she said, her accent as heavy as it always was, weighing down each vowel like molasses, a perfect complement to the deep rasp of her voice. Dean leaned back against the door with a grin, watching as she finished her interrupted walk over to the sink, dumping all the dishes in the soapy water already filling the large metal basin.
, he thought, not for the first time. Letting out a long breath, Sam braced himself, and continued walking.
“And yet you’re saying the Ave Maria.” Dean raised an eyebrow at Jim, who rolled his eyes at him before settling into the pew next to him. They sat in silence for a long moment, the words that he’d been in the middle of receding sitting heavy on Dean’s tongue.
As he began nearing where he thought was around the right area, Dean slowed the truck down, looking more carefully at the desert around him – moving slower, the tires were kicking up less dust behind him, making it easier to see, and he scanned the ground for any signs that Alex had been here earlier. He figured if he could spot where Alex had gone, that would be easier than trying to follow the sketched map sitting on the bench seat next to him, easier than looking for some unknown and undescribed marker. He’d left the road hours earlier, the corner that the road had spun through the landscape directly countering the route sketched out on the map. There had been a section of the fence removed right where the map and the road diverged through, large enough for Alex’s truck to pass through, so Dean figured he was on the right track. Alex had clearly torn back into town with an urgency that didn’t allow for attempts to cover his trail, and there had been a few other signs of that franticness that Dean had spotted over the past hour – a knocked-over barrel cactus, a cluster of maguey plants with clear tire tracks crushing them – that let him know he was still on the right track. The desert was dry enough that for the most part the tread of the truck didn’t leave any marks on it once the dust settled behind it though, and there were a few long stretches where Dean didn’t see anything, and had to just trust in the accuracy of the map still sitting on the seat next to him.
upside to the dull predictability of suburban homes he thought to himself as he slowly walked down the hallway, making sure to keep close to the wall, where the floor was far less likely to make any noises that would give him away. The sound of cutlery clinking, of the child’s babble, the man’s laugh, was muffled through the wall, and made something strange and forgotten spike through Sam’s stomach. Memory, maybe, though this was a life he’d never had, even before. Guilt, even less likely, a weakness he’d done so much to eradicate.
he said,
“Shut up,” Sam snapped, and Kyle’s mouth closed with an audible click as his teeth met. “I thought it was him,” Sam said, gesturing with his head towards the body
Sam screamed as its teeth sunk deep into his skin, and he was sure that the thick fabric of the parka was the only thing that prevented it from biting clean through him, ripping the arm right off, the grip on him just as tight and deadly as a beartrap. The machete dropped from his numb fingers, and he reacted more on instinct than from training, raising his free hand and bringing the blade held in it down with all the strength he could manage, driving it deep within the meat of the monster’s shoulder. The creature buckled as Sam felt something within it snap, the limb collapsing as it listed to the side with a whimper. It’s jaw loosened just enough for Sam to wrench his arm free with another scream of pain, the creature staggering back, Sam’s knife still buried in its flesh. Ignoring the blood streaming from the sleeve of his parka, soaking the fabric through, Sam kept his eyes on the monster as it struggled to recover from its own injury, its one leg now clearly useless, Sam’s knife having severed what was likely a tendon or something else equally critical. It wasn’t done yet though, its yellow eyes fixed on Sam, mouth open in a horrifying parody of a smile, mouth now smeared with Sam’s blood as well as its previous victim’s. It was preparing to attack again, undeterred by the damage Sam had already dealt it, the injuries hampering its movements, and Sam was officially out of weapons. Taking a deep breath, Sam forced himself to push the pain away, to reach deep inside himself for the silent, black emptiness at the core of him, still waters full of power and nightmares, and released it. The cool, clear water filled him until he was almost bursting with it, fingers shaking with energy and blood loss both as he pulled his arms back before thrusting them forward. The monster shrieked in confusion and pain, scrabbling desperately at the rock as it was shoved backwards across the ground. There was a brief second where it managed to hook its claws into the rock and it looked like it might manage to catch itself after all, but Sam pushed harder, barely noticing as blood began to run from his nose, falling slick and hot over his open mouth. The monster’s claws broke with a loud, aching crack, and it skittered backwards, still desperately grasping at the rock before it finally reached the cliff’s edge and disappeared from Sam’s sight with a final, lingering howl that made his teeth ache.
“Oh,” Rick said. He looked disappointed, confirming Dean’s guess about why he’d come over and asked Dean about John.
, he thought again.
“Yeah?” he said. “And how exactly are you proposing we do that?” As Jason opened and shut his mouth a couple of times, cogs in his brain almost visibly turning, Sam quickly ran his eyes over the group, taking stock of their expressions. They all looked pissed or afraid, or both. He waited, giving them another minute to move past fear and anger to action, but the minute passed in total silence.
he thought, then continued looking around the room. There were eleven people there, eight of them hunters. He was surprised to realize that there was one that he knew after all, Fatima looking back at him with the same expression of surprise, and he exchanged a quick nod of acknowledgement with her.
The kitchen was exactly how Dean remembered it, the scent of fresh herbs a constant clinging scent, the ancient silver kettle that Jim filled with water from the tap the same one he’d been using Dean’s entire life. Dean took what had become, over the years, his seat at the table without even thinking about it, though something in him clenched as he looked over at the two empty chairs next to him, the ghosts of the men that should be in them an almost physical presence in the room. Jim turned back from turning the stove on, catching where Dean was looking before Dean could look away. Dean grimaced, but Jim didn’t say anything, just grabbed a pair of mugs and the box of tea from the cupboard. It wasn’t until there was a mug steaming in front of him, Jim sitting across from him, that Jim broke the silence.
but he hated spending time with civilians.
the ghost said. Its mouth didn’t move but its words echoed in Sam’s head all the same. Sam smiled again.
It took three people and almost an hour of wandering the halls of the building before he ended up tapping on the open door of a small office shoved in a corner at the end of a quiet hallway. The woman behind the desk looked up at him, short blonde hair and round glasses with a thin silver frame, her skin dark and smooth. She ran her eyes up and down him, and he had a second of feeling self-conscious before he realized that the look was appreciative rather than judgemental, and relaxed into a familiar slouch, a flirtatious smile already tugging on the corner of his mouth by the time her gaze returned to his face.
“It is my mission,” he said, and Dean frowned at him.
“Now… now I go find Dad,” he said. “And then I’ll find whatever took Sam, and I’ll fucking tear it apart.”
“I can call him and let him know you’re coming,” he said. “But I know he’ll be glad to see you. And I think he’s your best bet, for figuring out how to begin to find your brother. And your dad,” he added as an afterthought, and Dean fought not to bristle at the slip. Jim wasn’t wrong. His father had been–
“Who are you? What are you doing here?” he demanded, walking across the floor until he was only a meter away from Sam. Sam saw the moment he registered just how big Sam was, though it didn’t seem to throw him off as much as it did his friend, now pulling even with him. They were both big guys in their own right though, and after a second they seemed to recover, angry expressions solidifying as they glared at him in unison.
“Um…” she said, trailing off before visibly preparing herself to continue. “Your brother was offered a fully funded scholarship in 2001, had accepted the offer and was all set to start in September of that year.” The word
. Alex had found himself at a standstill, and so had called Dean to see if he knew of anything with that name, or anything else native to the region that might cause people to vanish without a trace. The offer – and it had been phrased like an offer, not a request – for Dean to come and help if he was interested had been dropped in at the end, so overly casual that it had made Dean grin into the phone, not bothering to even pretend to consider before saying yes.
“Bobby,” Dean said, voice breaking and he felt his legs give out beneath him but didn’t seem to be able to move, to do anything to prevent himself from collapsing to his knees. The sound that they made when they met the floor sounded like it would hurt, it should hurt, but Dean couldn’t feel anything, couldn’t process anything. All he could do was stare at the map, the untouched map, the map that should have shown him where his brother was, god,
“This spell tracks souls Dean,” he reminded him, “so–.”
“Worked a job with your dad a few years back,” he said as Dean swallowed. “Hell of a hunter.” Rick paused for a second. “Kinda scary though.” A guilty look passed over his face, as if he’d only just realized that maybe wasn’t the right thing to say to the man’s son. “Sorry,” he added. Dean shrugged, not really sure what to say in response. He might not have seen or heard from his father in well over a year, but it wasn’t like that was an inaccurate assessment of John Winchester, or one that Dean hadn’t heard before from other hunters. Rick stared at him for a long, silent moment, but when Dean didn’t react, he kept going. “I heard he was working a job up in Alaska a couple months ago,” he said, “some sorta sea monster or something.”
He stayed on his knees even after it stopped, after the last shiver left his body, his forehead against the porcelain rim as he focused on his breathing, trying to find some way to steady himself against everything that had just happened. Finally he forced himself up, flushing the toilet and slowly making his way over to the sink, rinsing his mouth out before he took a deep breath and turned, walking back out into the room. Castiel was still standing there, which wasn’t a surprise, though Dean didn’t think he would have been surprised if the angel had disappeared either.
Sam opened his eyes, and this time Novikov was there, floating right in front of him, a smile stretched wide across its face.
“He’s alive,” Dean whispered to himself, and used those words to force himself to his feet. Bobby watched him, expression still wary, until he saw that Dean seemed steady enough despite the way he was still shaking slightly, leftover horror and adrenaline and mind-numbing sorrow still shocking its way through his system.
“Piss off,” she said, turning away from him to stick her hands into the water.
“No,” he said.
The look the priest gave him was more considering, though Dean still kept his own gaze fixed forward.
“I’ll be in the rectory when you’re done,” he finally said, and Dean nodded, grateful for the space. He still felt like he couldn’t breathe, like he hadn’t taken a full breath since the woman had told him his brother was missing, but there was something about sitting in the church that was calming, even if there was nothing there that he’d ever believed in. He looked up at the crucifix that dominated the front of the large room, the peaceful expression on the man’s face utterly at odds with the violence done to his body.
he thought, mind snapping back and forth between what he had just done and what would be done to him because of it.
“Shut up,” he said, voice rough as he picked up a handful of fries. Ellen raised her hands.
“Hey baby,” he said when it became clear that she wasn’t going to drop anything after all, and her head snapped up. Her eyes narrowed as she finally looked at him properly, realizing who it was that had almost knocked her over.
“Nope,” he said, popping the p with a grin, “girl said that nothing touched him at all, just some invisible force sending him flying. Pinned him against a tree too, then the guy pulls his gun, and that’s the end of that.”
“Yeah,” he said, voice flat as he continued to stare down at the map. There was a moment of silence, but when Dean didn’t look up, Bobby began the chant again. Sam’s name stood out even more awkwardly than John’s had amongst the mess of vowels and consonants that made up the chant and by the time Bobby reached the final line, Dean had stopped breathing entirely. He watched as Bobby struck the match, holding it and the bowl above the map, so tense he thought if anyone touched him he would shatter into a million pieces, never to be repaired. The match dropped from Bobby’s fingers, spinning through the air before hitting the herbs with a muffled surge of heat and consumption, the copper metal of the bowl reflecting heat and flame back on itself as the mess of ingredients ignited completely. Dean’s eyes travelled from the bowl to the map, his breath catching in his throat as he saw flame begin to lick at the edges of the map, watching as the flame slid across the map leaving behind–.
before the teenagers could get out, before the
Dean swore inside his head, briefly wondering if this guy would maybe tell him where his abuela lived, or give Dean her phone number.
The change he had on him just managed to cover the bus fare to get him to the train, and he wasn’t surprised when the man he sat down next to subtly shuffled away from him. He knew what he looked like, what he smelled like, just as well as he knew that people would be far more likely to ignore him, to avert their eyes and forget his face if they thought he was homeless. He smiled at the floor of the bus, a far more bitter and empty expression than the one that had stolen over him back at the house. It was one that sat far more comfortably on his face though, felt more natural, more right. Sam took a deep breath, swallowing before he let his eyes drift out of focus as he began chanting under his breath, the Hatamtite rolling off his tongue just as easily as English. The man sitting next to him got up and moved away, and Sam smiled again without pausing in his recitation. The vision, when it rose before him, was choked in black smoke, dense and unyielding, and he put more force behind his words, still speaking whisper quiet but with as much of a push as he could manage, pain spiking through his head despite the pills he’d taken earlier, the sharp ache cutting through the fog of medication. It managed to tear a jagged rip through the roiling blackness though, revealing a flash of a street name, a picture-perfect suburban house, a head of dark brown hair shot through with grey and a flash of blue eyes, crows feet wrinkling the edges in a smile. When he released it, he wasn’t surprising to find himself panting, shaking with exertion. The sense of eyes watching him was stronger than before, but when he glanced up all he was greeted with was a series of heads quickly turning away from him, going back to determinedly pretending he wasn’t there now that they knew he wasn’t about to die or something. The vision had confirmed that he was on the right path, offered him the reassurance he needed to lean back in his seat, breathing deeply and letting the pain wash over him. He briefly debated pulling out the pill bottle again, but he didn’t want to risk getting kicked off the bus and having to walk the rest of the way. The steady pulse of time slipping away from him was now a constant sensation, a reminder of how near he was to his goal, how he was probably already out of time. The pain that always accompanied his visions was one of the milder ones he regularly experienced anyways. He glanced up at the map above him as the robotic voice announced their next stop over the speaker, tracked the thin blue line that marked their current route almost all the way to the end before he finally spotted his destination. It would be at least an hour, maybe two.
“He’s hidden,” Bobby said. “By something more powerful than I’ve ever seen before.”
“I don’t even know where to start,” Dean said, voice breaking as he finally acknowledged aloud the helplessness that had driven him to make the almost two thousand mile drive to Blue Earth in two days. “Jim, I don’t… it’s been four
The woman barely had a chance to scream before the sound was lost to the noise of blood filling her airway as the dead man tore into her throat in turn. Dean swore again, louder, lunging forward and wrapping his arm around her stomach, yanking her backwards. The dead man tried to follow, but he was hampered by Alex’s body lying across his legs just as much as Dean was by the weight of the woman, hanging limply in his arms. He couldn’t tell if she was dead, couldn’t look down to check, forced to keep his eyes locked on the man now struggling to his feet. He moved in the same strange, jerky movements that Alex had; skittering and heavy all at once, a mess of limbs and joints and something just sideways of human. Dean managed to take two more steps backwards before the dead man began to follow after him. He tried to shift the woman without dropping her, but when he felt the way she lolled in his arms dropped her instead, raising his gun and shooting the man in the forehead. The scream that had been rolling through his body and out his throat, building as he’d moved upwards, cut off abruptly, and he stared forward for a long moment before crumpling back to the ground. Dean didn’t wait to watch him fall, was already turning towards the woman laying at his feet, gun turning, turning, just in time to watch her surge upwards, a scream building in her lungs, squeezing out of a ruined throat and sliding wetly through her open mouth. Dean was so close to her, he could see it, see the black root rot spreading through her mouth, climbing upwards from her teeth or maybe down into them and the bullet pierced her brain just as the first tooth fell, sliding backwards through blood and gore and deep down into whatever remained of her trachea.
“Wait!” Ryan shouted, pushing his way in front of Kyle, hands raised. “It’s me, don’t kill them, it’s me. I’m the witch.” Sam looked him up and down, considering.
Sam’s power slammed into Novikov’s with a force that made the spectral form slide backwards, though there was nothing physically happening. Where it hit him, Sam could see white fissure lines sparking out from Novikov, branching out into the darkness, into the bones of the house, up through its every limb.
There were a couple of times, long stretches of bare rock, where Sam became convinced that he’d lost track of the monster, that it had left the path in favour of clambering up or down the mountain directly, but he always picked it up again as he slowly worked his way up the side of the mountain, following the trail back and forth, back and forth, the air growning thinner and thinner the higher he went, his ears popping with the increase in altitude. He was forced to put his machete back in its sheath during a particularly tricky and narrow portion of the trail, pulling off his mittens and shoving them in his pockets as well, freeing his fingers to hold onto the rock wall to the right of him, trying to stay as far as possible from the sharp drop inches away from his boots. He almost slipped at one point, heart in his throat and blood pounding in his ears as he just stood, clinging to the rockwall for a long, horrible moment before he felt safe moving again. The path turned a corner after that, opened up wide, and Sam realized that it was taking him around a curve of rock, a ripple in the side of the mountain, flat and thankfully clear of the loose shale that had covered previous stretches. To the left was still that same sharp drop, not quite a sheer cliff but close enough that Sam was sure a fall would prove fatal, the distant tops of trees threatening to impale anything that might land on them. To the right was a small cluster of trees, just barely hanging on to the mountainside, before the rock wall once again rose up, high and imposing and impossible to climb. Not that he had any intention of trying, Sam thought to himself as he began to quickly cross the easier stretch of path. It was a relief, after how precarious the previous section had been, to walk forward with confidence, and it was likely that relief that made Sam, just for a minute, just long enough, to lose some of his caution, to let go of the sharp observation of his surroundings. It was pure luck then, really, that he hadn’t quite made it to where the path once again narrowed when it came around the curve, appearing in front of him like a spector, like a nightmare, freezing him in place so abruptly he almost stumbled.
The car door had barely shut behind him before Pastor Jim was walking down the rectory steps, his familiar face making something inside Dean relax despite himself. He wasn’t a child, was years removed from the boy who had run around the rectory, the church beside it, chasing after his little brother, but in that moment he’d never felt so much like one, filled with the sudden desperate need for someone else to step in and take this burden away from him. For someone, anyone, to tell him everything was going to be okay. It would be a lie of course, but just for once he craved that same false comfort he so often offered to civilians: hollow words promising that they were safe, their family was safe, the monster was gone and there was nothing else that could hurt them still waiting out in the darkness. He pushed the thought from his head, straightening his back as he headed across the gravel, breath puffing in the air in front of him.
“Why’d you do it?” he asked.
“Well, I think I’ve learned my lesson now,” he said.
“Why did you take Sam?” Dean finally asked, deciding not to acknowledge just how thoroughly he didn’t understand what the demon had just said to him. The demon shoved its hands in its pockets, rocking back and forth on bare feet, overly casual in a way that was obviously meant to set Dean on edge. Dean fought not to show just how much it was working.
The curve of the road opened up into a large flat expanse, cracked and broken pavement stretching out in front of him. The high fence made up of sheets of rusted metal that separated the lot from the railway next to it was nothing but distant shadows in the darkness of the night. Dean knew from his earlier visit that the few smaller buildings in the distance were empty as well, nothing inside of them other than graffiti and beer bottles and shards of glass from long-broken windows. It was the taller building, the one closest to him, that he headed for now. Unlike the other buildings, filled with the detritus of years of humans stumbling in and out of their hollow shells, their doors yawning open and welcoming all comers, he had had to break into this one himself—the thing that had made up his mind to use this building over the others. He was only a few meters from the door when his foot skidded on a patch of ice. He threw out his arms, desperately trying to keep his balance, and winced in pain as the sudden movement pulled at the muscles across his shoulders. The wound was healed enough that he’d already taken the stitches out, contorting himself in a small motel bathroom to avoid a trip to a hospital. It had been a stupid injury too, rushing into a haunting, realizing too late that the spirit was far more powerful than he had accounted for. Bobby told him off for it as he’d stitched Dean up when he’d shown up at the scrapyard at three in the morning, telling him he was being reckless, careless, stupid. Nothing Dean hadn’t heard before from the old man though, and if part of him pointed out that it wasn’t only Bobby who’d been telling him that over the last couple of years, well, that was easy enough to ignore.
“Once more unto the breach,” she said with a smile, and Sam laughed, the sound only a little bit bitter.
some darkly fatalistic part of his mind commented, and he pushed the thought away. He wasn’t there, couldn’t think like that. Not when Sam was out there somewhere (please god be out there somewhere), not when there was still a chance that he could find his brother (please god please god I’ll give you anything). He’d climbed the stairs to the second floor of the rectory with feet that felt like lead, Jim lingering in the kitchen with his books and a half-heard explanation of trying to look up scrying spells. He didn’t think, just turned and walked down to the room at the end of the hallway, and it wasn’t until he was standing in the doorway that he stumbled to a halt, a wave of nausea rolling through him as he stared at the two twin beds pushed to either side of the small room. He could almost see the faded outline of Sam at 5, 13, 17, sitting on the edge of the furthest bed, laughing at Dean’s joke, complaining about the way he spread his stuff out over everything, ignoring him in favour of reading something impossibly dense and boring. For half a second Dean was sure he was about to hear his brother’s voice, that Sam would come up from behind him, shove him into the doorway and tell him to get the fuck out of his way. There’s nothing there though, nothing but silence and dust and cold, empty sheets. Jim didn’t say a thing when he came stumbling back down the stairs, carefully avoiding meeting Dean’s eyes as he headed over to the couch instead, collapsing in an exhausted sprawl. His throat was thick with guilt and he felt like he could barely breathe for it, much less fall asleep, but somehow, impossibly, between one breath and the next, he did.
“Which one of you is it?” Sam said, voice harsh and unwavering, somehow managing not to give away the mess of fear and regret churning inside of him.
“Sam,” he said, trying to push as much innocence and warmth into his smile as he could. He could see a couple of the other teenagers relax slightly at the sight of it, though Kyle and Jason still looked pissed off. Still, as long as he could get the majority of them to trust him, that would be good enough for what he needed to do here. The upside of running a short con, he supposed. Less time to build up trust, but also less need for it to stand up to any sort of test.
His eyes were travelling over the crowd without purpose when his attention snagged, caught on one of the men who was walking amongst the crowd. The way he was moving was strange though, his motions juddery and stilted and starkly at odds with the comfortable and familiar flow of the rest of the congregation. Dean frowned, something about him registering as oddly familiar… and then he turned, and Dean’s eyes widened in surprise and recognition.
.” Dean’s voice broke off into heavy breaths as he lowered his head into his hands, fingers running into his hair and gripping tight, tugging, the sharp pain of the wrenching motion the least he deserved.
“It was Sam’s favourite,” Dean finally said. “I don’t know if it was because of mom, or something else, but…” he trailed off, shrugged, feeling weirdly embarrassed and exposed. Jim just nodded though, didn’t comment any further on why Dean was praying to a god he didn’t believe in with a prayer that wasn’t his own.
“No,” he said, voice nervous but insistent. “I didn’t! I just came to see if I could find evidence of ghost activity, here look,” he said, swinging his backpack off his shoulder, opening it to pull out an EMF reader. He waved it at the boy, who didn’t seem at all mollified, instead reaching out to grab the backpack.
“Castiel,” he said, the name coming out slow and shocky.
“So…?” Chrissy said, shifting from foot to foot and rubbing at her arms. Kyle opened his mouth to reply, but Ryan interrupted him before he could.
“Nah,” he said. “I mean, maybe, but when we asked around, trying to figure out who it might have been, we ended up finding this girl, the kid’s girlfriend, who was actin’ real spooked. Took a minute but she finally admitted that she saw the whole thing. Said she was out in the woods with her boyfriend when this guy shows up outta nowhere, huge dude with all these crazy scars, and all of a sudden her boyfriend’s growing fangs and claws. Boyfriend makes a lunge for her but…” the hunter paused, looking around the table to make sure everyone was listening to him, obviously savouring the captive audience, now that Dean had called attention to his story specifically, “...before he can grab her, boyfriend goes flying across the clearing.” The table shifts, clearly not expecting that.
Sam stepped back and just listened as they argued about what to do next, and, quieter, whether or not they could trust Sam.
While Sam had been breathing through the pain, the monster had apparently managed to recover enough to take another go at him, and Sam barely had time to brace himself before it was rushing forward again, it’s head now coated in a lurid mixture of its own blood and the blood of its victims. Sam flipped one of his knives forward, widening his stance and staggering his legs as it moved forward. He had a brief second to wish that he had the time to strip off his parka, to mourn the mobility lost in its thick, warm layers before it was upon him and the thought disappeared in a rush of adrenaline. Its jaw opened impossibly wide as it let out a noise that was somewhere between a human shriek and the hunting howl of a hellhound. He waited until the last second before dodging to the side, feeling one of its teeth catch and rip the fabric of his coat as he swiped at it’s throat. He couldn’t tell how deeply he managed to cut it through the mess of fur covering the hidden flesh there, but when he and the creature both swung back to face each other again, their positions now reversed, he saw that it was enough to stain the fur black with blood, though apparently not enough to slow the creature for long, as it almost immediately began to move back towards him. Sam had only a second to brace himself, to consider his options, before it was again driving at him with an open mouth and lolling tongue.
. He curled his hand around her hip, raising his other to her shoulder and rolling her stiff body until her back was exposed. The sheet stuck to her skin, peeling off reluctantly as he held her up, a slow tug of stained fabric inching away from icy skin. She must have already been dead when she’d been cut into, he thought, looking at the marks on her skin, or he’d have woken up in a pool of her blood, would have been able to see it seeping out from beneath her body. As it was, the blood had hardly even penetrated the sheets beneath her, had just barely stained the top elastic of her panties, a red bloom turned brown and dull against the light fabric.
Sam swallowed, a harsh, horrible feeling against his dry throat. He staggered down the stairs, then turned back to the house. Its empty windows stared down at him, and Sam closed his eyes against their accusing gaze. He let the pain and anger and fear that was overwhelming him stoke his powers a final time instead, reaching out with the heat burning inside his fingers, spreading them across the house until he finally felt a floorboard catch under the press of a white hot spectral palm, flames suddenly licking up, hungry for the old and dried wood that made up the house. When Sam finally forced his eyes back open, it was to the sight of smoke beginning to climb from those same broken windows. An empty smile twisted his lips. The smell of smoke was just reaching him as he turned and headed around the side of the house. The shattered pieces of the bones in his leg continued to grind against each other as he walked, but he was finally able to push the pain away.
Novikov flickered, and then his power was hitting back at Sam in turn. Sam allowed himself to stumble back a pace as the force of it hit the wall of Sam’s defenses, though it didn’t actually do anything to pierce them. He could see Novikov’s eyes widen, and he smiled again.
“All I know is that there was a door there before he showed up out of nowhere, and now there isn’t one.”
“Now now,” it said, face twisting into a mocking expression of disapproval. “Where’s the fun in me spoiling the surprise? You’ll find out soon enough. After all, it’s been written since the beginning of time: ferrum ferro ab utero bestiae viscera Mariae ducam plaga mundus ardebit cum eis.” It grinned at him then, an expression so full of genuine happiness that it made Dean’s skin crawl even as he tried desperately to pull every Latin lesson Bobby had ever given him forward from the depths of his mind. Sam had always been better of the two of them at dead languages though; Dean far better at the living ones.
Thank you as always to Helen, the real hero of this fic.
Dean asked.
“I fucking will wound you,” she said, pointing her finger at him as she walked back to the other side of the kitchen. Dean watched as she stalked past him towards Raoul, who was actively ignoring both of them, leaning against the counter and doing something on his phone. She pulled her notebook out of her pocket, quickly rattling off an order to the other man. Raoul didn’t even look up from his phone, but Katerina just kept staring at him until he finally heaved a long sigh and pushed himself off the counter, pocketing his phone and walking over to the fridge.
that are hunting monsters now?” one of the hunters asked, voice disbelieving. The woman shrugged, obviously uncomfortable.
more specific cws will be included in the chapter notes of whichever chapter they occur in.
“Guys–” Ryan said, letting the flame go out as he raised the hand back up, palms towards Sam, a protective gesture so familiar it made Sam ache.
“You said you understood why he did it,” Sam said. Merihem shook her head.
“So what, it’s
“I will not,” it said. “There is nothing that you could do to me,
he offered, and Dean took in a deep breath, riding out the wave of grief that rolled through him. He had a job to do, he reminded himself, and let out the breath.
“I’m sorry,” he said before his brain had a chance to catch up with his mouth. Ryan’s face twisted, and Sam felt Ryan’s magic singe along his skin like sparks from a fire, an involuntary result of the anger filling his eyes.
“Who is Shif– Shifre–” Dean started to ask, breaking off as he stumbled over the unfamiliar name. It wasn’t like any demon name that he’d heard before, and that was just another drop of fear to add to the growing sea inside him. The demon grinned back at him, clearly enjoying Dean’s confusion.
“Alright,” Kyle said. “Me and Nicole will take the second floor, Chrissy and Ryan, you take the attic, and Sam and Jason can do the basement. Good?”
(See the end of the chapter for
and decided that was enough information for them. Based on the angry look on the boy’s face when he spun back to Sam, Sam was guessing it was the latter.
“Alex!” Dean yelled without any hope, and was surprised when Ale– whatever had once been Alex raised his head, turning towards Dean with blood streaming from his mouth, small chunks of something Dean couldn’t identify mixing with the gore and tumbling to the ground. He wasn’t screaming anymore, but the crowd around them was more than making up for it, people now desperately shoving at each other to get away. Dean made a split second decision – didn’t wait for them to get any further away, didn’t wait to see what Alex would do next – just adjusted his stance slightly, shifted his aim, and squeezed the trigger.
Moving as quickly as he was able to while still not making any noise to give himself away, Sam approached the bag closest to him, a small grey backpack leaning against a still rolled-up sleeping bag. Putting his flashlight between his teeth, Sam pulled on a pair of black latex gloves and carefully unzipped the bag. It was a mess, clothing shoved in without any sense of order, a phone charger tangled in a pair of socks, a granola bar crushed almost flat. Sam smiled around the flashlight, quickly sorting through the chaos. If all the bags were as disorganized as this one, all the better, though it did prove disappointingly empty. He supposed it would have been too easy, requiring the kind of luck he had never in his life had, for it to be the first bag he searched. He glanced around himself for another bag as he shoved everything back into the first one, sparing a moment to listen to the distant sounds of people still moving around above him. Spitting the flashlight back out into his hand, he quickly picked his way across the floor to the next bag he’d spotted, a bright pink backpack covered in pins. He winced as they rattled against each other as he unzipped it, but refocused as soon as he could see its contents, sighing as he saw how neatly it was packed. Sticking his flashlight back into his mouth, Sam quickly memorized the layout of the bag before he began emptying it of its contents.
“Jim told me what happened,” Bobby said, and Dean was abruptly grateful that he wouldn’t have to confess to this man as well, someone who had had just as much a hand in raising him and Sam as John had for at least a third of Dean’s childhood. He wasn’t sure he would have been able to bear looking into Bobby’s eyes and telling him that he’d lost Sam, the thought sending an aching pain through him. The only thing that would be worse would be telling their Dad, and Dean had already had to do that once in his life. Though he supposed that at least this time that wouldn’t be a conversation he would be forced to have.
“You should leave,” the boy who’d first confronted Sam said, moving so that he was more directly in Sam’s eyeline, trying to draw his attention off of Nicole. “We got here first.” Sam fought the urge to roll his eyes.
“Fine,” Sam said, voice as hard and smooth as glass. “If you won’t tell me, I guess I’ll just shoot all of you to be sure.” He slid his finger onto the trigger, solidified his stance, and–
“No other description of him?” Dean asked, fighting to keep his voice disinterested, like he didn’t really care either way about the answer. Beneath his ribs though, his heart had jumped. Swallowing, he forcibly reminded himself that Sam was an incredibly common name, that plenty of hunters were really tall.
he thought.
Inside the only illumination came from the windows—half broken and half papered over with pages of newspapers years out of date—the scarce light providing him with little in terms of visibility. Dean pulled out his flashlight before he turned towards the basement. The building had been filled with offices at some point, maybe something to do with the operation of the railway. Whatever it had been, it had long since been abandoned. Aside from a few unsettling reminders of what it had once been—a single office chair, sitting alone in a beam of moonlight; a desk, its drawers ripped half out; a filing cabinet spilling its papers across the floor, not important enough to be salvaged from the hollow corpse of the building—it was totally empty. The location made it inhospitable to the homeless, and teenagers and junkies both apparently preferred the easy access of the other buildings, because Dean hadn’t found any sign that another person had set foot inside here since it was first locked up, however many years before . Which made it ideal for his purpose.
a wave of fondness flowing through him as he shook his head. It was a stupid risk oh her part, giving him these small provisions, something that would have bloody consequences for both of them if anyone had found them, but it made him smile even as he tucked them back into the pocket. His hands were still relatively warm thanks to the thick mittens, warm enough that it wouldn’t affect his dexterity, and he wasn’t yet so hungry that it was a problem, so he made the easy decision to save both of them for later, when things became more dire. He had no doubt they would – he was surrounded by a seemingly endless wilderness, with no idea what he was looking for or where it was. There was no guessing how long he would be out here.
“–do you suggest? Because–”
“Hey Bobby,” he said as he finally reached the bottom of the steps. Bobby’s gaze on him was bright, sharp, even as he raised the beer to his mouth and took a long pull. He nodded towards the cooler sitting on the porch between them, and Dean stooped to grab a bottle of his own, opening it with his ring and taking a long drink. Bobby’s eyes stayed locked on him until he swallowed, at which point he finally smiled, gruff and warm in that way that only he ever managed.
helen is a literal HERO
and sat up with a gasp, hand clenching around a gun that was no longer there, sheets pooling around his waist. Beside him, Kateria made a small noise of protest but didn’t wake, settling deeper into the pillows as Dean’s wide, scared eyes passed over her body to the rest of the room. There was nothing there, just shadows and the sounds of Dean’s own ragged, desperate breaths. He reached beneath his pillow and grabbed his gun, his real gun, the difference between it and the dream version of it obvious only now that he was once again holding the real one, cold metal a comfort against his skin as he slid out of bed. Naked, he silently crossed the room, slipping out of the door to search the rest of the house.
The diner was old and worn down, but obviously well loved, the table Dean was directed to decorated with a vase filled with a small handful of flowers, the chipped tile of the tabletop a perfect match for the faded paper menu he was handed. He couldn’t stop himself from letting out an appreciative moan when he was brought a cup of coffee, and he settled in to observe the town as he waited for his food. There were a lot of people now walking past on foot, probably headed to the church. When the waitress returned with his food, Dean tried to ask if she knew anything more than the bartender had about the bocas huecas, but she didn’t seem to know what he was talking about. Dean smiled, told her it was no problem, but she just frowned at him before walking away. The next time she came by with more coffee though she also had the cook with her, an old woman with sharp eyes and deep laugh lines surrounding her mouth, her gray hair hanging down her back in a long braid. Much like the bartender the previous night, she seemed wary of Dean’s questions, but brightened up significantly when he showed her the photo of Alex. Dean fought the urge to sigh as she launched into a recounting of what a nice young man he was, how sweet and polite and such a good listener too. No one ever talked about
Thank you so much to anyone who's made it this far, and endless thanks to Helen for her feedback and encouragement along the way!
Sam realized he was shaking just as he reached the front hall, but he couldn’t tell if it was because of the growing hunger burning in his veins or the fear and pain suffusing the rest of his body. He paused, leaning against the wall for support as he struggled to breathe for a long minute before he forced himself to keep going. His mind was a mess of pain and fear and the dull static of panic, and he couldn’t seem to gain control of it long enough to disassociate from the pain radiating out from what felt like every single fibre of his being. When he opened the front door to the early morning light just cresting the horizon, Sam just stood and stared out at the spray of gravel where the teenagers’ cars had been. He wondered briefly if he should try and go after Ryan, but the chances of the witch sticking round were infinitesimally small, and the chances of him remaining unwarded and findable were even smaller.
“Just passing through,” Dean said, taking a long swallow from the bottle, the cold drink more than welcome after the late-afternoon heat. “Got a line on a hunt in Detroit. Figured I’d swing by though, catch up on all the latest gossip.” Ellen rolled her eyes again, leaned on the bar. She considered him for a long moment before sighing and shaking her head, and Dean felt the hope that he hadn’t even acknowledged he’d felt, had been trying so hard
“You said you came here to look for ghosts,” he said. “Do you not know?”
“You killed a demon,” Castiel said, which absolutely didn’t answer Dean’s question. Castiel knew it too—though his expression remained blank, flat, Dean was certain that the angel was, on some strange metaphysical plane of existence, shifting guiltily. Dean decided to let it go. It wasn’t like he didn’t have plenty of other questions for the angel.
“It’s dead,” he said, feeling slow and stupid, like he was still thinking at half-speed.
Jason gestured for Sam to follow him through the only other doorway in the room. Sam went easily, barely paying attention, still running over his options in his head. The issue, really, was that there were still so many hours left until sunrise. He didn’t know if the summoning spell would work through the magical barrier put up by the ghost, so it would probably be better to wait until he could make a clean escape by just walking out the door. On the other hand, being alone with Jason right now was the kind of opportunity that he might not get again before the end of the night. He spent a brief second wishing that he could just use his knife, something that would make it easy to pass off as something the ghost had done. He shoved the thought away – there was no point in wishing for impossibilities. They were standing in an ancient kitchen now, and Sam added his own flashlight’s yellow beam to Jason’s, already sliding over its contents. Unlike Jason, Sam was barely registering what he was looking at, though he did take note of the rusted out knives hanging from the wall, and the way that it looked like something impossibly strong had smashed straight through the heavy wooden kitchen table. Jason had obviously noticed it as well, staring at it nervously. Sam wondered why he would look afraid, before reminding himself that as far as Jason knew, he needed to keep up the same act in front of Sam as he had in front of the whole group of teenagers. Turning his head, Sam let his flashlight drift around the room one last time. He thought he caught a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye, but when he turned there was nothing there but shadows and dust. He fought the urge to sigh. Of course the actual ghost was going to make an appearance. Drahomir Novikov might not have been a serial killer, but his neighbors who had started those rumours had been right to be suspicious of the man. There had been a lot of black magic performed in this house over the decades that Novikov had lived there, and a lot of blood spilled. It was hardly a surprise that when one of his rituals had finally turned on him, his spirit would decide to remain here, powers amplified far beyond what would normally be possible for such a fresh haunting thanks to all the magic still lingering in the bones of the house.
“He never showed up,” she said, voice apologetic. “Didn’t check in to his dorms, didn’t register for classes, nothing. His student account was closed when we couldn’t get ahold of him by December–” Dean stopped paying attention to what she was saying after that, head spinning as his heart pounded, jackrabbit fast, fear and confusion swirling through him.
thank you again to eliza for the beta!!
. His vision wavered strangely, and he couldn’t tell if it was because he was crying or because he was going to pass out with the pain of his world ending, his world having ended who knew how long ago and he hadn’t known,
the message read, the cut of the words messy and jagged in a way that made Sam curl his lip. Sloppy, but at least he was now certain he hadn’t been the one to kill her. He sighed, let her fall back onto the bed with a heavy sound. He rose, looked down at her for a long minute before turning and heading back to his backpack. There was no point doing anything about the body – someone else would find it eventually, and he had no desire to deal with the police today. He had other things to do, other places to be. After all, that message had been clear as anything.
Dean could do, would do, all of that just fine on his own.
he said,
“The girls shouldn’t be alone,” Ryan said. He was looking at Chrissy, smiling at her in a way that was probably meant to be reassuring, but was itself too nervous to really do the job. “I’ll come with you Chrissy,” he said.
“What?” he asked. “What does that mean?” Castiel finally looked at him again, head tilting in that way that was quickly becoming familiar, looking at him for so long that Dean found himself shifting uncomfortably under the weight of his gaze.
“It’s good to see you, boy,” he said, and Dean smiled back at him, leaning up against the porch railing.
, and the thought was sharp with bitterness. Bobby stood, heading towards the inside of the house. “I pulled some books this morning,” he said as he held the door open. “There’ll be something in one of them that’ll help us find your daddy and your brother.” Dean didn’t say anything, just followed after Bobby into the warm interior. He glanced around as he stepped through the devil’s trap Bobby had painted on the ceiling, but as with the property outside, while the piles of books, weapons, and bottles had almost certainly shifted and changed over the years, it somehow managed to also look exactly the same as it had the last time he’d been there. On the old wooden desk that was probably at least as old as Bobby was a stack of worn books, some of them seeming to only be held together through sheer determination, a few with actual duct tape, which would probably make whatever Benedictine monk hand wrote it die on the spot if they could see it now. Bobby headed towards the desk, nodding towards the low stained couch against the wall as he did so. “Make yourself comfortable,” he said, and Dean let himself sink down into the familiar piece of furniture, the springs groaning in protest beneath him, depositing his still mostly-full beer on one of the few free inches of space on the coffee table in front of him.
Sam froze, the sound of the floorboard creaking under his foot painfully loud in the otherwise still air. He stood completely still for one second, then another, listening. There was no pause in the conversation he could faintly hear above him, and after a moment he continued walking through the front hallway, careful to be cautious of the old, loose floorboards bending under his weight. He wrinkled his nose. The building was so old and decrepit, it would be a miracle if no one inside fell through the floor before the end of the night. Though he supposed that was the least of his worries, and the least of the worries of the teenagers wandering around the second story above him too, though they didn’t know that yet. He took two more slow steps forward before the hallway opened up into a large front room. Sam stopped, quickly surveying the space then glancing at his watch.
It was a horrible sound, and the crowd around Alex flinched back on instinct before they began moving backwards with purpose, staring in fear at the man standing in the centre of the rapidly widening circle. He was still screaming, didn’t seem to be pausing for breath, and the noise was wet in a way that made Dean nauseous, wet like there was something torn in his throat, like there was blood frothing in his lungs. His jaw continued that same ticking motion, faster now. There were still a handful of people standing between Dean and him, and Dean began shoving at them harder, fighting to move forward as they fought to move back, struck with the sudden instinctive knowledge that something horrible was about to happen.
“Aw Bobby, you could never be irrelevant,” Dean said with a grin. Bobby rolled his eyes and it was like no time had passed since the last time he was here, Dean stealing beer instead of being given it, nineteen and sure that he had the entire world figured out. He had never found out what Bobby and his Dad had even fought about, when Bobby kicked him, and Sam and Dean by proxy, off of his property that August, had never asked. He did remember that he and Sam had spent more than half that summer at the junkyard though, Dean shoved under cars and covered in grease the whole time while Sam struggled through his first real growth spurt, bones stretching and lengthening into awkward skinny limbs that absolutely fucked his ability to spar for months before he got used to his new height, only for it to start all over again. The thought of Sam manages to wipe the smile off his face like it had never been there, and he watched as the lingering smile on Bobby’s face disappeared as well as he took in the change in Dean’s demeanour.
When the GPS told him he’d arrived at his destination, Dean allowed the truck to drift to a slow, grinding halt, peering out at the landscape surrounding him. There was a rise to the east of him, a ragged outcropping of rocks marring the otherwise predominantly flat landscape, and to the west a countering dip, the ground slipping downwards and out of sight, rising back up far enough away that Dean could barely see that what continued on was just more desert. Climbing out of the cab, Dean landed on the ground with a puff of dust. He looked back and forth between the rocks and the valley, before looking ahead, towards where the straight flat stretch of desert he’d been driving across just continued ever onwards. There was nothing on the map, nothing that he could see on the ground, that would indicate which way he should go. Grabbing one of the bottles of holy water, Dean arbitrarily picked the outcropping, dust rising behind him as he cautiously approached. The desert was silent other than the fading tick of the truck’s engine cooling behind him, the cry of some bird in the far off distance, the sound of the wind and the crunch of the dirt beneath Dean’s boots. As he got closer, Dean noted with some surprise that in the shadows of the rocks there were more plants growing, not just the familiar cacti and maguey plants he’d become used to over the last couple of days, but ones that needed actual water to survive. He registered that thought at almost the same time as his nose picked up the smell of water, and he remembered that Alex’s jeans had been caked with mud. He swallowed, heart rate picking up in readiness. Shoving the bottle of water into his pocket, he drew his gun and continued forward even slower.
Sam thought with a sigh. His favourite thing – unknown spells with no obvious countercurse. Pulling out his phone, Sam quickly flipped through the book, taking photos of all of the pages. Barely paying attention to what his hands were doing, he began repacking the bag, shoving everything back in exactly as he’d found it. His attention turned upwards as he did so, towards the sounds coming from above him. They had faded significantly for a while as they went up, Sam assumed, to the third floor, maybe even all the way up to the attic, but they were getting louder again, the sound of footsteps against the floor growing closer and closer. Sam swore to himself, shoving in the last of the clothing and hastily zipping the bag shut, standing and heading back towards the hallway that he’d come in through. The footsteps above were getting louder as they came closer to the stairs leading down to the room that Sam was just now leaving. The creak of floorboards, the shuffle of feet, was accompanied by the indistinct murmur of voices that were becoming more and more clear as they drew nearer to the stairwell. Sam hurried down the hallway, avoiding the floorboard that had creaked so loudly before, letting out a relieved breath when he reached the front door and there was still no one in sight, no one yet coming down the stairs. Sam reached out for the doorknob, swung the door all the way open, the star-bright sky revealing itself to him in a rush of sharp night air. Sam didn’t move through the door, instead immediately slamming it back shut, the darkness of the hallway once again swallowing him whole. He smiled in satisfaction when it banged loudly, the voices behind him abruptly cutting off at the sound. Taking a deep breath, Sam turned back around, drawing his shoulders upwards slightly, forcing tension into his spine. He began walking, retracing the path he’d taken only seconds earlier. He glanced down, making sure to step on that same rotten spot this time, and swore when he realized that he’d forgotten to take off the gloves. Fumbling, he almost dropped his flashlight, but had just managed to get them off and shoved into his pocket when he stepped into sight of the main room.
“The last time I saw Bobby he was running us off his property with a shotgun,” he admitted, raised an eyebrow when Jim waved the words away like they were nothing.
Alone, in the desert, no one else around to feed on, the entire family had turned, then starved, a single, horrifying decision leaving them all dead. Dean’s eyes moved back to the rock, considering. They hadn’t gone anywhere, hadn’t even tried to, as far as he could tell, and he wondered if that was how this curse had survived so long without notice, and with relatively few victims. The majority of the people who had had the misfortune to stumble upon it simply wasting away, far from the sight of anyone else, never able to pass on the curse. Except for Alex, and Dean swallowed against the knowledge that if Alex hadn’t come back to town no one else would have died, though the thought of Alex dying out here, alone and afraid, made his heart ache just as much as how it had happened. Still, it didn’t make sense, if the family was consumed so quickly that they didn’t even leave the stone circle they’d stumbled upon, how Alex had managed to stave off the transformation long enough to go back to town. Except, Dean corrected himself, for how Alex was a hunter, and knew far better than this family what was happening to him. Dean remembered the holy water, and cautiously put his gun away before pulling out the bottle. He splashed a little on the father, just to check, but wasn’t surprised when there was no reaction.
. Dean shook his head, trying to disperse the echoes of words that would never be spoken aloud. Jim didn’t know yet anyways, didn’t yet realize the full scope of how badly Dean had fucked up, how badly he’d failed his whole family.
... but the body he’d left to decompose in that house was still sharp in his memories, a warning written and paid for in blood. Instead, he dumped all of the wallets in a trash can outside of the station, before heading in to purchase his ticket. At least he’d be able to sleep more on the train, his limbs heavy with hunger and exhaustion, weeks on the road without slowing down, without stopping for longer than it took to take care of only the basic necessities: water, sometimes food, even less often shelter. He was so close now though, almost done. The train ride would give him time to rest, to centre himself and prepare for what was ahead.
“Shut up Chrissy, it is not,” he said. “I know Jason talked this place up–” he gestured at the boy who’d said they were trapped, Kyle’s partner in trying to intimidate Sam “–but it was just to scare you. Ghosts aren’t real.” Sam didn’t bother to hide the frown he shot at him, though he made sure it was more one of mild confusion than the contempt he was actually feeling.
“Hi,” she said. “Can I help you?” Dean nodded, stepping further into the room.
, it said.
“Thanks Bobby,” he finally said, and Bobby shrugged awkwardly.
“My bag? How would you… oh,” he said, before anger and sorrow broke over his face, one after another, mixing together into a mask of pain. “His bag was next to mine,” he spat, fury burning in every word. “He was probably getting his fucking knife so he could protect you.” Sam bit the inside of his cheek to stop himself from flinching back at his words, but wasn’t able to stop his eyes from flicking over to the body lying just inside the swinging light cast by the group’s flashlights.
“Subter te duco e fovea, Merihem. Adiuro vos ad me invenient me et lugeret filium suum in captivitate diaboli,” he said as black spots danced in front of his vision, putting his blood-covered palm down in the very centre of the design smeared across the rock. His entire body swayed, eyelids heavier and heavier. “Detrahet me in domum suam,” he whispered, and the sound of something moving towards him across the stone was the last thing he was aware of before the darkness finally claimed him, pulling him completely under its sway.
When Merihem found him, Sam was sitting tucked in the corner of a balcony, his side pressed against the railing, body curled up like it would do anything to make him appear smaller, like it would somehow allow him to hide in plain sight, disappear into the shadows. She didn’t say anything at first, but he still knew it was her standing behind him, had known it was her coming when she was still on the stairs half the floor away from where they were now. He shifted over, making room for her to sit next to him, and she did, threading her legs through the railing and kicking them out over the edge, letting them dangle in the empty air. She leaned back, palms pressed to the cold marble floor, stretched out and taking up as much space as possible. Sam shot her a look, but she just smiled back at him, overly-innocent. He turned back to the scene in front of him, and felt more than heard movement next to him as Merihem did the same. The silence between them settled, turned comfortable. From where they sat, high above the ballroom, the screams were barely audible, sinking beneath the sound of the orchestra playing something discordant and ancient. It could almost be peaceful, but the scent of blood and perfume was still heavy in the air, making it impossible for Sam to pretend, even for a minute, that he was anywhere other than where he was.
“What did you do?” Nicole said, but it was less of a question than it was a statement. “Oh my god, what did you do?” Her flashlight was pointed at where Jason’s body lay in a rapidly growing pool of blood, and Sam had to fight to keep his eyes from following the beam towards the evidence of what he’d just done. His heart was racing. He could feel his calm control slipping from his grasp, the fear of what was going to happen rising in the back of his throat.
Taking a deep breath, Dean turned to the rock, taking a few steps further back. He had no idea what, if anything, this was going to do, but if Alex drinking holy water, dumping it over his head, had helped to slow the infection, there was a good chance that it would affect the source of the curse as well. Bracing himself for what might happen next, Dean sprayed the rock with the holy water. The reaction was instantaneous, steam rising from the rock as it made a horrible, high-pitched noise, somewhere between the screech of a hunting hawk and the sound of metal grinding against itself. Dean couldn’t help but flinch back, an involuntary, instinctive reaction. It continued as a single, unending noise, until finally, as Dean watched, the water finished evaporating off the rock, and the scream trailed off into nothing. Dean took a couple of cautious steps closer, trying to see if there had been any damage to the rock itself, but it didn’t look like there were any marks on the rock to show that anything had happened at all. He splashed some more water, and the rock reacted in the same way, again leaving no damage behind. Dean quickly retreated across the space, until he was standing next to where he’d entered the enclosed space. He stood there for a long moment, considering his options. The holy water was clearly having an effect, but there was no way for him to know if it was enough to break the curse on its own, or if there was something else he needed to do. There would also be no way for him to test if it was broken other than touching the rock himself, and he didn’t think that was something he was willing to do, ever. He bit his lip, then looked up at the rocks far above him. If he couldn’t destroy the rock itself…
“I said don’t lie to me,” Dean said. “I know you have him.” It was a bluff, but Dean was a pretty good liar, a lifetime of hustling pool, shoplifting food, dodging social workers behind him. Telling Sam that everything was going to be okay, which had turned out to be the biggest lie of all.
“Yeah,” he said, smiling at her, “but none of the rest of them are your favourite.” She rolled her eyes at that, but went to grab him a beer anyways.
Despite Jim’s reassurances, Dean still half expected to be greeted by a gun when he pulled into the yard of Singer Salvage that afternoon. There was no gun though, no sign of Bobby at all as the Impala came to a slow, rolling stop, the sound of gravel pinging off the undercarriage the only sound other than the low growl of the engine. It was strange, Dean thought as he looked around the junkyard. It had been almost a decade, and there was no way that the vehicles that surrounded him were the same ones that had been there the last time he was at this place, when he was still a teenager, but it somehow managed to still look exactly the same as it had back then. Though maybe the particulars of the vehicles were less important to the sense of familiarity than the worn facade of the house stuck in the middle of all of the rusting metal carasses, the smell of rust and dust that washed over Dean as he shut off the car and climbed out. He shoved his hands in his pockets as he looked around him, wondering where Bobby was. Jim had said that he’d sounded as pleased as Bobby ever did over the phone, when Jim had told him that Dean would be headed his way. That he hadn’t come out at the sound of a car in the yard was unusual, though Dean supposed he might be down in the basement, or further back on the property. Dean made one last slow scan of the yard before checking his gun and heading towards the house, keeping an eye out on his surroundings as he went. He managed to get a couple of meters away from the dilapidated porch before he abruptly became aware that there was someone sitting on one of the chairs. There was a brief second where he went for his gun, before his eyes adjusted to the shadows cast by the overhang and a familiar face finally materialized from the darkness. Dean relaxed his arm, taking in the old, worn cap that he’d swear had been the same one Bobby had been wearing his whole life, the hunter’s uniform of plaid and denim, a bottle of beer held in one scarred hand.
“You’re crazy,” Kyle said. “God, you’re crazy, you– you locked us in here, you–”
“I think you should go to Sioux Falls,” Jim said instead, and Dean looked at him in surprise.
“Poor Dean,” the demon said, “lost your little baby brother.” Its voice was mocking, and the smile on its face had Dean fighting the urge to grind his teeth together as it spoke. “Only had one job, look after little Sammy. Couldn’t even do that right. No wonder your Daddy left you. Probably couldn’t stand to look at your face anymore, knowing what a fuckup you were.” Dean tried not to react, even as something deep in his gut twisted, the voice that lived somewhere in the back of his mind whispering at him.
, a difficult man to stay friends with. Even among the hunters who were still willing to take his calls, few of them had much love to spare for John Winchester. Dean sat with the offer for a long minute, thinking over his options. Jim was right though – Bobby’s library was legendary amongst the hunting community, and Dean had run into more hunters that knew Bobby, had swung by Singer Salvage for one reason or another over the years, than didn’t. If Bobby didn’t have anything for him, he might at least know where Dean could look next.
“Dad,” Dean said, not even letting Bobby finish. He tore his eyes from the map to meet Bobby’s wary gaze. He looked at Dean like he was something fragile, someone who would break at the slightest bit of additional. Which maybe wasn’t wrong, he thought as he looked back at the map. “Start with my Dad,” he said. There was a long pause, and when he looked back at Bobby, his face was filled with hesitation.
“Proof enough for you?” he said, but didn’t wait for an answer, running his gaze up and down Sam. “You’re not a hunter,” he said.
. Dean had stared at the journal, fury and helplessness and fear burning in his chest and swore he would do exactly what John wanted, and fuck the old bastard anyways. He’d only lasted six weeks before he’d broken, drunk out of his mind and shouting into John’s voicemail. He couldn’t remember, the next morning, if he’d mentioned that Sam was missing or not, but either way John didn’t return his call. In the last few months, Dean had flipped wildly between confusion, sadness, fear, self-recrimination, before finally settling into a deep, simmering anger. He wasn’t sure he’d ever wanted his father to be by his side, to tell him that everything was going to be okay, this badly in his entire life, but John had apparently decided that he was done being Dean’s parent. Which was just fine with Dean, really. He didn’t need him to find Sam, didn’t need him to tear apart whatever had gotten its hands on his little brother. Didn’t need him to tell Dean that it wasn’t his fault, that Sam would be okay, wherever he was.
thanks for reading!
“S’weird,” one of them observed, taking a swig of his beer, and there was a murmur of agreement across the table. There was a long moment of silence. When it was broken, it was by someone with a story about a demon he’d run into in Germany years ago, old gossip about monsters and victims long dead. He gave it a minute before he tuned out of the conversation, mind racing. It wasn’t anything, not really, but his gut was telling him otherwise, the same hunter instincts that had saved his life so many times telling him that this was
followed shortly after, and Dean ignored the wave of fear and nausea that rolled through him at the thought. Instead he turned around to grab the second map, pocketing the small scrap revealing where his father had apparently been hiding from him, avoiding Dean and letting him think he was dead rather than just pick up his fucking phone, the absolute bastard, why would he–.
“So you know he’s dead, for sure?” Bobby said, and the flare of irritation was hotter this time, stronger, making Dean narrow his eyes.
“Ellen,” he said, then stopped, not sure what else to say.
“Alright,” Ellen said slowly, giving him a slightly worried look. “Should I grab the sheets and stuff for the cot?” Dean looked towards the kitchen.
Dean shook his head, trying to clear out the threatening darkness of those memories. Whatever it had been, it hadn’t happened again since, and he had far more pressing, and present, matters to attend to. Dean slipped out the same way he’d come, locking the door behind him and heading down the sidewalk.
Nicole said, at almost the same time that Sam spoke:
cw: child death
For his part, he didn’t bother even making a gesture to follow after any of them – after all, he knew what they would find, and since Kyle had apparently elected to stay behind and stare at Sam with open hostility and suspicion, he figured it would probably be better not to disappear from his sight quite yet. The slow build up of the lie, the creation of a fragile trust and sense of camaraderie was fun and all, but he was also on a deadline, and the faster he could get these kids to stop seeing him as a potential threat the better. It wasn’t long, anyways, before the kids began to return, all frightened expressions and jumbled explanations of blank and empty walls: no windows, no doors, no nothing.
“There was a rocking chair that I thought maybe moved? But no, not really.”
Ahead of him stretched out the river valley, open and exposed. Covered in a thick, smooth blanket of snow, it was blinding to look at, the trees interrupting its blank expanse few and far between, though they grew denser as he continued to turn, looking towards the mountains that were to the left of him. The forest grew steadily thicker the further away from the river it went until it finally reached the point of being impenetrable by Sam’s eyes as it rose higher and higher up the side of the mountain before, high above his head, it began to thin again, giving way to ice and snow and blank, sheer rock. Behind him was much the same as ahead, save for a slightly denser population of trees, and the staggering path of Sam’s own tracks, the only blemish on an otherwise uninterrupted plateau. He traced his eyes back to the point where his tracks began, two boot prints in the middle of an otherwise uninterrupted hill of snow. They were already being swept away by the wind, filled in by the snow still sliding past him atop the thin crust of the snowbanks. In an hour, there would be no sign that he’d been there at all. Turning back, Sam considered his options. Crossing the river would be dangerous, unjustifiably so unless he knew for certain that it was necessary. Since he didn’t yet know anything more than what he had observed for himself, it would be stupid to try and make it to the southern half of the valley, at least not now. Maybe later, if it did prove itself necessary. For now though, for now he decided to follow his first instinct, the one that had hit him in the gut when his boots first touched the snow, like a fist accompanied by a screaming wave of ice and cold.
The thought rose to Dean’s mind unbidden, making him falter in laying the map down on the table. For it to not find Sam… Dean hadn’t let himself even consider that that might happen, but now, standing and waiting for Bobby to mix a second batch of herbs, awash in the relief and rage of his father’s continued existence, it was hard to keep ignoring the possibility.
