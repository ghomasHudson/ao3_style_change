He’s angled towards Castiel, forearms resting casually on the wooden countertop and a smile curving his lips. Even in the low light, his eyes look so
“So when you’re thinking about the answer you’re going to give him tonight,” Benny finishes, leaning back once more. “Just remember that. I won’t let you fuck him up any more.”
“Do you want me to sit next to you, or back on my stool?” Dean asks once Castiel has paused for breath, and there’s nothing pushy or insistent about it, just a calm openness. Patient. Waiting.
Dean settles back onto his chair, and Castiel can’t stop staring at his arm. The upper part of his arm is covered in colourful ink that peeks out from beneath the sleeve of his t-shirt, but his forearm is bare apart from that mark, and so of course Dean, when he turns back to Castiel and pulls on a new pair of gloves, notices him looking.
When Castiel lifts his hand in a little wave from where he’s sitting, the child peeks out a little further, and he can see them more clearly. It’s a little boy, no more than three or four years old, his face tear-streaked and his body possessing the same slightly translucent quality as Castiel’s own.
There’s a cheeky, teasing spark in his eyes, and Castiel gives him an affectionate eyeroll. “Just a few,” he says sarcastically, even as a new interviewer closes in on them.
The night before, he had sat on his bed, staring down at his arm and wondering what it would look like tomorrow. Would it have a Dom mark? A sub mark? Would it have a mark at all?
dominating you, that it had come so naturally to me when I’ve spent so many years trying to be the total opposite of that. I just… I felt so
“Dean!” is all Castiel manages to get out in warning before the door flies open, slamming against his shoulder and sending him reeling.
The bark of the tree’s trunk is rough against Castiel’s cheek where he leans against it, but he doesn’t care, and barely even notices—it's not like it can hurt him, after all. Even if he fell all the way down to the ground from here, he would still stand up without a scratch or any trace of pain. No doubt many people would kill for that, but for Castiel, it’s just another part of what his life (or lack thereof) has become.
,” Hannah reprimands, without looking up from her laptop. It’s a wonder that she wasn’t designated a Dom, what with the way she manages to keep Inias in check sometimes. “That’s personal, Castiel might not want to answer that.”
Somehow, picking up his phone and dialing that number feels like one of the most overwhelming, terrifying things he’s done in his life—including packing up and moving across the country to go to college. Calling Dean means acknowledging that he has a problem. Calling Dean means acknowledging that he thinks Dean can
He asks about Dean’s interests, smiles when they make eye contact, tries not to let himself be distracted by the touch of his gloved hands. Dean is beautiful and witty and clever, and Castiel had not expected to be feeling so head over heels for his tattoo artist, but here he is, very slowly working up the courage to ask Dean out to a bar or a movie or
All that comes to Dean's mind is another ‘shut up,’ so instead he flips Sam off and reverses out of the parking area. "Find me the nearest town so I don't have to put up with you any more," he mutters, and from the back, he hears Sam snicker.
This artist has a variety of works, some in brilliant colour and some in stunning, complementary black and white, but all of them are beautiful and each one tells some kind of story. The art itself is beautifully executed, and Castiel can’t stop staring as he scrolls down the page, taking in every single tattoo this artist has to show. He’s never considered getting a tattoo now, and it’s still a little crazy to think about having someone else’s artwork on his skin, but Castiel knows instinctively that if he wants anyone tattooing him, it’s this artist.
“Did you grow these for me?” Dean asks quietly, crouching down to get a closer look at the flowers. Castiel follows him, but instead of looking at the flowerbeds, he can’t help but find his gaze drawn towards Dean instead.
Dean can’t help but huff out a laugh. “Sometimes I wonder,” he mutters wryly, and Cas flicks him lightly on the bicep.
For a moment, Dean is taken aback—his sensitive nose can only pick up hints of that scent on the air, but even so, he can tell that this person is an alpha, and this person smells
, Dean thinks with amusement as he finishes packing up his things. “You wouldn’t happen to have any money riding on me asking Cas out, would you?” he asks, shoving his laptop into his back and swinging it up onto his shoulder.
He uses his grip on Novak's hair to pull him down further, until he's taken Dean in as far as he can possibly go. Even then, Castiel takes it like a champ, his throat relaxed even with his nose barely nudging against Dean's pelvis. It has to be up there with one of the hottest things he's ever seen. "Never thought you'd be this good," he gasps out, and Castiel seems to take that as a challenge.
Hannah looks down at it for a few more moments, then scribbles a note about it in her notebook before turning her attention to the grave’s headstone.
There’s no point in pretending—his family probably heard the gunshots and sent Cas to check up on him. He only ever comes out here when he has no other way of letting out his emotions, and so Cas is definitely the one best equipped to deal with that.
"Just fine," he says with a shrug, then bites his lip in concentration as he focuses on the moving. One swift scoop, and then it's into the container, just seconds before Novak opens his mouth again.
They sit on the beach and watch the otters until the sun begins to set and dusk creeps in across the cove, and then Dean takes Cas’s hand and leads him back up the beach towards the cottage.
That earns him a quiet huff of amusement from Dean, before those green eyes fix him with a gentle, sincere gaze. “Because I like you, Castiel,” he says quietly. “You’re determined, but you’re also kind. The more I ran into you and the more I learned about you, the more I liked you. I couldn’t resist getting a chance to meet you properly—you’d never have treated me that way if you’d known I was the
Before Dean can say anything else stupid or awkward (or both, god fucking forbid), he forces himself into action. He can stand here by his counter being a whole dumbass around Cas all day, but if he’s actually moving around, talking about his plants, he might stand more of a chance.
Novak nods. Fuck, this is so much more touchy-feely than Dean is ever comfortable getting, but for once, he might not be the most emotionally constipated person in the room. It sounds like they’ve both been too stupid to make the first move—though, why the
Cas fumbles at Dean’s fly even as Dean starts to stroke—gentle and teasing for now, enough to get him worked up but not too distracted.
being pressed back against the counter. He draws breath to argue, but then Castiel's lips are kissing over his jaw, biting and sucking along his throat—hopefully not hard enough to leave any marks, although he’s pretty sure he’s out of luck there.
. All the guys he’s ever been with have started out as friends or hookups, but to ask a stranger out on a date?
The booth must hold so many memories, but Castiel can’t let himself linger here. He has to try to find some kind of concrete clue
Castiel runs his fingers through Dean’s hair, over and over again, and they sit together, and they breathe, and Castiel loses himself in it just as much as Dean does. It’s relaxing, and Castiel leans back in his chair and lets himself appreciate the calm and the quiet.
Cas growls in response, a sound that rumbles through his chest, pleased and possessive and all the things that tie Dean’s insides into knots. Strong hands pin him against the ground, and Dean pushes back against them, smirking into the kiss as he nips gently at Cas’s bottom lip. He’s not one to just roll over, and Cas must like that, if the appreciation that weaves into the scent of his arousal is anything to go by.
“Okay,” he says with a nod, giving Cas a little smile that he hopes will put his mind at ease. “Cas it is. And about last night…”
There’s a woman standing at the bow of the boat, red hair and red cloak billowing in the wind as she holds a large pendant up to the sky. A few feet to their left, there’s another guard, clearly surprised by their appearance. After hearing their boat explode, he must have thought that they hadn’t survived—it must be a nasty surprise to find out that they’re still alive.
It gives him pause. Usually, he’s very quick at noticing people’s designations; since it’s something he focuses so strongly on with himself, it’s hard not to extend it to other people as well, to notice if they’re Dominant or submissive or unpresented.
When Castiel had gently suggested that perhaps it was time to leave the hunting to the next generation, it took Dean a little while to accept it, but eventually, he did.
Dean should have opened his store ten whole minutes ago, but instead he’s been standing here chatting to Cas like some kind of lovesick idiot—which he totally is, he won’t deny that at all.
“Gotta say, Krushnic,” Dean says, his tongue curling around those syllables, even as Castiel’s blood goes cold. “You really do know how to fuck.”
At first, he can tell that Dean feels a little odd about it. Sam decides to stay in the bunker for a while, at least so that he can get the next generation of hunters set up in there, but Dean and Castiel move out to a little house not even thirty minutes’ drive away. It’s the first time that Dean has lived like this since Lisa, and Castiel tries not to feel jealous about
He walks up to the little family quietly, not wanting to disturb the woman in her last moments with her children. Instead, he waits by the head of the grave.
done this, but he trusts Dean to guide him, and to teach him, just as much as Dean is trusting him to be his Dominant.
Dean sees an opening, the slightest slip in the alpha’s defence, he takes advantage of it. He ducks in quickly, landing a punch to the man’s stomach that knocks the breath out of him, then hooks his leg between the alpha’s and unbalances him. They both hit the forest floor with a
He doesn’t want to give in just yet, despite how tempting it is to lean forward and brush his lips along the shaft of Dean’s cock, so instead he settles for kissing over the exposed skin of Dean’s thighs as he pulls the jeans and boxers the rest of the way down and lets Dean step out of them.
Which is how he ends up working late on Tuesday evening, hunched over his desk as he sifts through the paperwork and records of the museum’s newest display collection.
After that night, something changes between them. There’s a tension that wasn’t there before, more than just Castiel’s frustration with Dean, and it simmers away under the surface in every single one of their interactions.
This time, the contact is skin to skin, without the barrier of Dean’s gloves between them. Dean’s fingers are gentle, careful, as he tilts Cas’s forearm this way and that to get an idea of how the tattoo is healing. “It’s looking good,” he says finally, looking up with a grin. “You must have been taking real good care of it. I’ll be able to finish the rest up today, and then you’ll be good to go.”
“I’ll bring my partner, too,” he says, giving Dean’s thigh a quick squeeze. “I haven’t been feeling so well today.”
For now, he can sleep happy knowing that he has finally found an answer to the question in his heart.
When he opens his eyes again, they’re dark, glazed, as though he’s looking at Castiel but not quite seeing him—caught in that haze of pleasure, and desperation, and
Dean tries to ignore it. There’s nothing he can do about the situation but grin and bear it and try to pretend nothing is wrong, after all.
scenario, with whips and leashes and whatnot. He doesn’t really have much to base his perception of dominating off of, after all, other than what he sees in the media, and…
It buttons together in the front—elegant and silver to match the necklace that hangs from Cas’s throat—but leaves his arms free to move. Behind him, the hem of his coat is cut low and dramatic, almost cape-like where it ends at his mid-calf. It’s black all over with silver accents to match the jewelry on Cas’s wrists and fingers and the silver glitter in his hair and it’s a testament to how little Dean has been able to take his eyes off his familiar that he doesn’t even care that that fucking glitter is going to end up in their bed tonight.
He ends up texting Inias over his lunch break, after he finds himself thinking around and around in circles about the question.
Amongst the white, the shape of a man is barely visible, dressed in jeans and a leather jacket with the collar turned up against the cold. His shoulders are hunched, and he looks as though he bears the weight of the world upon them.
The door cracks open, barely an inch, and Dean glares through it. “I’ll come out when you stop being an asshole,” he points out. “Fuck you and all your stations.”
But there’s something that seizes his attention, not in his head but in his heart. A feeling that hooks behind his sternum and guides him forward, telling him:
Cas catches Dean’s hand and intertwines their fingers, moving back to Dean’s side once he’s sure that Dean isn’t going to retaliate further for his comment. “I do like watching you sleep,” he admits, his thumb skating over Dean’s knuckles as he looks back out over the dusk-washed river. “You look peaceful.” He pauses for a second, then asks, “Do you like it out here?”
Dean is watching him, an unreadable expression in his eyes, but there’s also a curiosity there. One that says
Dean does not get along well with his roommate--which doesn't body well for the fact that they have to quarantine together...
to respond, because after all the years he’s spent being terrified of his own biology and how he’d seen it represented while he was growing up… Anna thinks he’s a good Dom. He’s a good
“Why did I have to lose him?” he whispers quietly as the storm begins to subside, his grief leaving him empty once more like the pull of the ocean at low tide.
Castiel finds Dean in the dining room, field trip specimens spread across the table. He leans over Dean’s shoulder, watching as his husband carefully categorises one of the rocks in front of him. “What’s that one?” he asks, even though he knows the answer.
It’s cold out. Dean has the collar of his coat turned up against the winter air, beanie pulled down snug over his ears, and Cas is equally bundled up.
“Nothing beats cooking burgers on a grill, but I guess we’ll just have to make do with this. Unless you feel like setting off all the fire alarms and sprinklers in your apartment?” His smile widens to a grin, and he nods at the zebra cactus on the windowsill. “At least then you wouldn’t have to worry about watering your plants for a while, huh?”
Until the man follows his greeting up with: “I was hoping I could buy you a drink.” His grin widens, and he spreads his hands in front of himself. “No homo.”
Dean takes a step forward, and then another, and another. Slowly, the distance between them is lessened, step by step, bit by bit, until he’s close enough to reach.
Cas hums, turning his face against Dean’s neck. His lips brush lightly over Dean’s skin. “I was, yes. Didn’t realize you were so deeply engrossed in your work, though. How is it going?”
“I love you,” he whispers when they break apart for air. “Thank you for being there with me. I couldn’t have done that without you. Not then, and definitely not without all the ways you’ve shown me I can be better this past year.”
Dean looks up from whatever he’s working on at the computer, and for a moment, when he meets Castiel’s gaze, his face lights up.
“You didn’t mention that you liked to be handfed,” Castiel murmurs, his voice low and rough from disuse and the effects of the arousal beginning to curl through his veins. Dean shrugs, a faint smirk pulling at the corner of his lips as he chews and swallows.
Dean is quick to obey, but steady. He crosses to the table as though he’s floating, and crouches to set the cushion down—adjusts it carefully, so that it’s to his liking next to the chair Castiel usually sits at, then stands. He doesn’t move, just stays there, hands clasped behind his back. He’s half-turns towards Castiel, and Cas can see the beautiful curve of his jaw, the darkness of his eyelashes.
Electricity sparks beneath Dean’s skin as Cas leans back against the car and nods, his chest heaving breathlessly. They both watch, enraptured, as Dean’s fingers fumble with the belt buckle, the button, the zipper. He manages to get it all undone, but Cas has grown impatient.
Somewhere in the background, Dean vaguely registers the sound of the Netflix logo, but he has no idea what Cas has put on, and he really doesn’t care. He’s here with his angel, arms and wings wrapped snugly around him, heartbeat slow and steady beneath his ear. There’s nothing that could ever make him feel better, and nowhere else in the world that he’d rather be.
It’s actually surprisingly beautiful. The water is clear and fast-moving, the banks grassy, the air warm and quiet. Most importantly, though, there’s no one else around.
They'd made their way south for a storm that had looked promising in southeast Oklahoma, but it had fizzled out before they'd gotten there, leaving them high and dry once more. After having done this for so many years, they're used to the disappointment by now, but Dean would be lying if he said it wasn't starting to get on his nerves. Storms are unpredictable, but it'd be nice if they could make it to at least one tornado this season.
“Told you I’m a Man of Letters, Cas. I know things. I might not be a psychometric like you, but I have skills in other areas.”
There are no words exchanged as they get comfortable, Dean’s back pressed against Castiel’s chest and Cas’s arm curved around Dean’s waist, like two halves of the same whole. It feels cozy and intimate and
Apart from the video game audio, his apartment is quiet, undisturbed—so when the printer in the corner of his lounge room suddenly whirs to life, he almost jumps a foot in the air.
They still have plenty of time to spare before they have to leave if they want to get back to the bunker before nightfall, and Castiel is still thinking about the riot of colour and sound, so he nods. Beside him, Dean looks a little less certain, but still says, “Sure,” and follows after Sam as he leads them back towards the parade.
Dean smiles around his mouthful of food and gently nudges Cas’s foot under the table. “Of course, Cas. I wouldn’t do it any other way.” Then the look in his eye turns cheeky, curious, and he quirks his eyebrows at Castiel. “So. You still wanna know what I’m into?”
,” he begins, sounding more vulnerable than Dean has ever heard him, “that while I’m working, I can’t have you near me. You’re distracting, Dean—I’ve seen you watching me, I’ve seen how you look at me and heard how to talk to me, and I can’t get it out of my head. It puts me in a difficult position, because I can’t afford to be distracted or worrying while I’m supposed to be working. I can’t concentrate when I know you’re close by, part of my security team, putting yourself in harm’s way because of
Anna’s expression morphs into one of concern. “Of course, Castiel. Do you want me to walk you back down to the basement?”
"Yes, Dean?" Castiel asks. He's only half-dressed, and his hair is sticking up in odd directions. His eyes look slightly red-rimmed, but as his gaze falls on the letter in Dean's hand, they widen. "Were you looking in my desk?"
Dean is expecting to be able to sneak back to his tent, catch an hour or two of rest, then get back to work…
“Cas, I really like you. I’ve enjoyed working with you, and if you want to go back to just being friends or colleagues tomorrow, then I respect that. But for what it’s worth…”
But then his brows crease, and his expression morphs into one of worry. “Heya, Cas, you—you’re not looking so good there, buddy.”
“I did.” His voice is quiet over the noise of the crowd. Dean leans in closer to hear him, always gravitating into his pull.
It’s just after the New Year, and since Castiel has used up all his time off by now, he finds himself back at work for the first time since the dinner party.
familiar. “I’m distracting, am I?” he asks with a grin, coming to a stop in front of Dean’s cauldron and tilting his head.
He holds out his hand, and Dean stares down at it, his heart in his throat. He could’ve asked anyone to be his pretend date for tonight, but he chose Cas, and he’s beginning to think it was the biggest mistake of his life, because now…
Castiel stares at the thick line running down her forearm, proudly displayed like a status symbol. She won’t give up until she knows—it’s not in her nature.
But the longer he spends away from Cas, no matter how much they keep in touch online… it starts to feel like there’s a hole in his chest. Like there’s a piece of him missing, a piece that only ever feels filled whenever he’s in that tiny dorm room with Cas in Princeton.
By the time they’re a few days into their quarantine, Cas is feeling much better. He’s taken over cooking from Dean, who’s definitely starting to feel more tired than he should after taking care of their chores. They knew that Dean would almost certainly catch it from Cas at some point, but it still catches him off guard when he feels suddenly breathless after cleaning up the kitchen.
look over and give the bottle a little wave to check that it’s okay to drink it, and as soon as Castiel has given him the go-ahead, Dean’s grabbing a glass and pouring himself out a generous three fingers of whiskey.
Castiel swallows down the bile rising in his throat and shakes his head. “No gun,” he whispers, and watches Dean’s expression change with his realisation.
Cas pauses, removes one hand. Dean is hyperaware of every one of his movements, from the shift of his weight, the flex of his fingers—
He drops his duffel by the foot of his dodgy-looking bed and pulls out his notebooks—full of the information he’s picked up from his dad over the years, and the details of the case that he’d found. He knows where the nest is, and from the number of killings recorded, it can’t be large. He’ll head out there in the morning, slice up some fanged sons of bitches, and then be on his way back home. John will be so proud of him.
“You stupid hunter,” the incubus hisses, his eyes glowing faintly red now that neither of them are pretending any more. “You really think you can con your way into my domain and try to defeat me? As though I can’t see every desire that goes on in that pathetic brain? Civilians don’t lust after angels, hunter boy. And even if you’re in denial, I know every last bit of it. You never stood a chance.”
And then there’s a flash of metal, and the vampire’s head separates neatly from his neck, the decapitated body slumping to the ground to reveal a young man standing over Dean.
Now that he’s alone in his kitchen once more, Castiel takes stock of the situation and rethinks his plan. He’s pretty sure he has enough food to turn his meal into one big enough for two people, and it’ll just take a little bit of tweaking to make it suitable for what he’s decided he wants to do tonight.
He finds Dean in his studio, as he’d suspected. There’s a mess of paper on his desk, and Dean’s hands are smudged with graphite from hours of hard work. Some definitely gets on Castiel’s face when Dean pulls him in for a kiss hello, but he really can’t bring himself to care.
This has to be weird for Cas, having been here for so long, but as soon as they started to fade a few weeks ago, they knew that their time here was coming to an end. They’re both almost completely transparent now, but they can still touch, and Dean takes full advantage of that as he bumps his shoulder against Cas’s.
“Until next time,” Cas says with a grin, sticking his hand in front of the lens to wave to the audience before turning off the camera. Dean groans as he rolls over towards the side of the bed, slapping at the keyboard of his laptop until the stream shuts down. Another day’s work, and another incredible fuck from his amazing boyfriend.
Castiel is the only one who gets to see what he’s really like. What he was before, tainted and made misshapen by what he has to endure but, at the heart of it all, still good.
Castiel has met his fair share of talented artists, but he’s never met one quite like Dean Winchester.
Dean rides into the camp just before sunset. There are few things he loves more than being astride Impala with the knowledge that his weapons are within easy reach, and he’s had a nice ride out to the front lines. Now that he’s here, though, his work begins.
good. Castiel grasps him by the jaw and kisses him, hot and hard, putting every single ounce of desire and gratitude and
Cas looks up at him, blinking in surprise. "That's cool?" he ventures, a hint of disbelief in his voice. "That's all you have to say?"
Castiel wants to introduce himself, but he doesn’t—which is why he’s so surprised when the stranger appears by his elbow at the bar, twenty minutes later and with two beers in hand. There’s that smile again; flirtatious, confident, but with something fragile and glass-brittle behind it.
That's not quite enough, though. Now that he's started in on the pranking, it's hard to stop, and so Dean stands at Novak's work station and eyes the things that Novak holds second-most precious to his heart.
Night has well and truly fallen, and the streets are full of cars and people on their way to enjoy the nightlife. Dean begins to walk, and they fall into step, sharing a steady silence until they’ve deemed themselves far enough away to be safe.
Dean, of course, is not thrilled about this newest hunt, but he relents anyway. He knows there’s no way he can win this argument.
I found out that one of Baby’s parts is shot, and because she’s so old I have to order it special, and it’s going to cost me a fuckton of money I don’t have. And
Or so he’d thought—until the door to the roof bangs open, and suddenly Cas finds that he’s no longer alone.
“Dean?” he calls again, but this time he’s listening for it, and he hears it again. When he lies down on the pier and peers over the edge—

,” Anna seethes, stalking alongside Castiel as they make their way back down to the basement. “It’s fucking
That gets a laugh out of Cas, and the sound of it melts Dean's heart even more. "Yes, Dean," he says, and his voice is light and amused and so happy it hurts. "Yes, I will be your boyfriend, because I would also have to be an idiot to say no to that."
They’ve been quiet for a little while, Dean catching his breath after their run to cover, and Castiel is perfectly happy to let the quiet stretch out between them. The gardens need the rain, and the sound of it pattering across the path and the tin roof and making the tree leaves dances is endlessly soothing.
Dean chuckles, and just like that, then tension in him dissipates. It’s so gratifying to know that he’s made real progress with his communication and their dynamic, just like he said he would. There’s no way he ever wants to let Dean down.
He pulls his earbuds out as he steps up to the booth, but the man is already talking as he gestures to the scanner in front of him, and it takes Dean’s brain a delayed few seconds to piece together his words.
His tutor looks up at him with raised eyebrows, definitely caught off guard, but his expression softens into one of gentle amusement when he realises what Dean is shouting about. "So your friend replied, hmm?" he asks with a smile, then stands up from his desk with a quiet sigh. "Alright, meet me at your desk, and we can figure out what to write back."
Until the man scents the air, freezes up, and looks directly towards where Dean is crouched in the shadows.
The corners of the man’s mouth pull down, and he presses his hands against his chest, as though he’s been wounded. “Ouch,” he says. “I guess that one was on me, though. Gotta be prepared for the truth.”
And so, considering they drive to work separately and do their best to act professional at work, their colleagues have no idea that they’re dating. Which… does not have the repercussions that Dean and Castiel had been expecting.
He can’t attend his first matching ball without having a dance, right? It’s just for fun. Just to say he’s done it.
Cas closes his eyes for a second against the sadness that washes over him at the thought of his family. This isn’t how he’d wanted to leave them, but it’s not like he has much of a choice now. It’ll take time, but they’ll be okay.
But that night, he stays home with his family. He talks with them, catching up on all that he’s missed while he’s been away, and he tries his best not to think about all that he’s missing on the boardwalk by the ocean.
And together, in the space that they have carved out as their home, their sanctuary, they hold each other and sleep.
As a matter of fact, he does—Castiel enlists Dean’s help in pulling the casserole and potatoes out of the oven, setting them aside for a moment while he grabs their plates and cutlery. He really should have been a good host and had all this ready before Dean arrived, but he’s been thrown for such a loop today that it’s a miracle his meal has made it through unscathed.
about the way he is around Dean. The lack of personal space, the fact that he always comes whenever Dean needs him, the
manages to avoid rolling his eyes. “I believe I can do that,” he snarks. “I’ll see you at your car.”
There’s only so long he can keep them waiting, though, before he himself starts to get a little antsy. Once he catches himself fidgeting in place, shifting on the bed in anticipation, he knows it’s time for the show.
“Can I?” Dean murmurs against rain-wet skin, barely audible over the drumming of water onto the roof of the Impala and the whistle of the wind. His fingers drift down, teasing against the waistband of Cas’s slacks.
Slowly, he gets better and better at his craft, and with each piece that he creates, his grace is depleted further.
He wasn’t kidding. There are some old texts in there, ones that Castiel foggily remembers from when he was alive that look as though they’re about to fall apart, but it’s the newer ones that catch Castiel’s attention. The books with lovers on the front, or monsters, or things that Dean dubs ‘spaceships’ and that Castiel can’t help but be insanely curious about.
Before that thought can circle back to the existential panic that’s laced his thoughts for the past week or so, however, Dean manages to derail him once more. “Yeah, we didn’t get to talk much about your work before,” he says, leaning his hip against the edge of the counter and raising his eyebrows at Castiel. “How about we get started with cooking dinner, and you tell me about it while we work? I don’t know about you, but I’ve barely eaten all day, and I’m fucking starving.
They don’t talk for the rest of the drive, just listen to the music playing through the stereo, each caught up in the tangle of their own thoughts.
. Even without the dress sense, though, the guy’s eyes and sex hair are captivating, and any hope Dean had of eloquence dies in that moment.
magical artifacts—of taking them out of the hands of bad people and storing them away so that they may never be misused, or even used at all.
As soon as he tries to gravitate casually towards the bag, however, Dean appears in his way. He leans, relaxed, against the countertop, and gives Castiel a smug smile. “You peeking there, Cas? It’s a surprise, busybody, stay out.”
Dean’s eyes widen; the smile disappears from his face. “I—um,” he stammers, clearly thrown by Castiel’s response. It’s oddly satisfying to see Dean off guard and flustered when he’s usually pretty collected. “You—you
A few moments pass—quiet, electrically charged and full of anticipation—and then Dean shifts, sliding off the couch and onto his knees on the ground. He lowers his gaze, lashes fluttering, and, after a moment of hesitation, presses against Castiel’s calf.
Night has well and truly fallen by now, and the forest is silent. Still. It’s very different from the camp at night time, full of rowdy chatter and singing until the early hours of the morning, so as he makes his way back, Dean takes a moment to enjoy the quiet.
For a few long moments, all they can do is stand there, the silence hanging thick and heavy between them with all the things half-said.
Cas lags behind as they hightail it back to the Impala, and Dean pauses to wait for him, wrapping an arm around his shoulders as they meet.
His question earns him a dramatic sigh from Dean, who slumps against his shoulder. “Don’t complain to me when you’re tired tomorrow morning and we’ve got nothing to show for all this bullshit,” he mutters against the fabric of Castiel’s trench coat.
"I fail to see how it can be that difficult. I can get a good photograph from here, and if the tornado comes my way, I can just... drive away from it."
When Castiel wakes, he is expecting the bed to be empty. They have a lot to do today, after all, and from the brightness of the sunlight filtering into the room, they don’t have much time left to waste. If Dean was already up and about, Castiel wouldn’t blame him—he’d be a little disappointed, of course, but he’d understand.
Dean’s expression turns mischievous, and he raises an eyebrow. “Hmm… you’re thinking about how good last night was, and how you wish we could do it again this morning.” He pauses for a few beats, then makes a show of chuckling and shaking his head. “Oh, wait, I think those are my thoughts.”
Dean Winchester, slumped in the hay shed, sweat on his brow and a bloodied rag wrapped around his shoulder.
It’s lazy and relaxed, all slow-moving bodies and the drag of hands over skin, and Castiel is definitely going to have to email Adler with a bullshit excuse for his absence—but that becomes the last thing on his mind when Dean’s hands and mouth start to roam, and all of Castiel’s thoughts dissolve into pleasure and bliss and
The gossip flows through the camp like water, stirring the soldiers into chatter and activity. So much for ‘later this week’—Dean will have to work quickly if he’s to have any information of value before he’s called in for an audience.
“I’ll tell you when I’ve made my decision, Cas,” Dean points out. His words are gentle, and he punctuates them with a quick kiss to Cas’s cheek before stepping away, grinning. “But that definitely won’t be before I’ve had my morning coffee, just so you know.”
Dean inhales, breathing in the clean forest air, then exhales again. He’d had his doubts, and he’s still not sure about a lot of this whole camping bullshit, (and he’ll
It’s just a few hours. Then Cas can forget all about it, and return home with Dean. “We can do this,” he says, more for his own sake than for Dean’s.
Castiel had walked him to the door, a hand hovering lightly over the small of his back. In the low light, lips parted and lashes fluttering over cheekbones, the temptation had almost been too much, but he’d resisted. Whatever it is between them… he wants to take it slow. He’d felt
They still don’t talk much, but Dean has started to smile whenever Castiel arrives, and it feels like
Dean grins, teeth white in the moonlight. He seems to almost float across the ground as he crosses the few strides between them, stopping within arm’s reach of Castiel. He holds his left hand out, his scythe glinting against tanned, freckled skin. An offering. An invitation.
“I don’t want to be like her, dad,” Cas whispers, face tipped up towards the grey sky. “I don’t want to be a Dom. I
“It’s okay,” he murmurs to Cas one night, when they’re curled up in bed. “Your feathers will come back. Besides, no matter what, I’ll still love you and your wings.”
“You don’t see him much anymore?” Castiel asks quietly. With Dean’s eyes closed and his head resting on the bench right next to Castiel’s thigh, the urge to run his fingers through Dean’s hair—or physically comfort him in
It’s Anna, of course it is. “Yes,” he says distractedly, running a hand through his hair in poorly-tempered frustration. “Can I help you?”
Dean flattens himself to the wall instinctively and hugs his broom to his chest, hoping that the shadows are enough to hide him from the vindictive caretaker. He's not sure how soundproof the barrier is—or how it even came to be there, for that matter—but if he can hear Filch then it's safe to say that Filch can hear him. Dean's wordless spells have always been hit or miss, so he just has to hug the stone and hope.
, he really shouldn’t have let his thoughts stray in that direction, because now he can feel himself getting hard in his slacks. “My bike’s been making a bit of a funny noise, you see. I wanted to bring it by, see if you could… help me out.”
For a long moment, they sit there, both looking down at the collar. Castiel rubs his thumb over the soft leather, then musters his courage and properly looks at Dean’s face for the first time.
And Dean had died. He’d died over and over but some motherfucker out there—not God, he’s not that stupid—is looking out for him, and Dean is one lucky son of a bitch, because he’d come back every time. He’s gotten so many new leases on life, and the way he sees it, it would be disrespectful not to use them.
I am posting this deliriously tired and very sunburnt because I simply cannot sit on this chapter any longer or I will s c r e m. Thank you as always to
He has blue eyes and wild hair and a smile that makes Dean’s heart stop as they catch each other, apologize, and then introduce themselves.
The whole way through the ending of the documentary, Castiel can’t stop staring at the artist’s arm and the colourful ink that adorns the skin around her mark. When it ends, he reaches for the remote and switches off the TV, then sits and stares into space for a few minutes. Thinking. Turning his thoughts over and over in his head.
It towers above him, all crumbling bricks and snaking vines, exactly what he’s been looking for after weeks of searching and months of planning and years upon years of studying the ancient texts that have directed him to this very spot. Several of the remaining inscriptions and tablets from other sites mention this god, and the existence of a temple dedicated to him, but while other scholars had dismissed the temple as being lost to the cruel winds of time, Dean had not given up so easily.
Novak gives him a quick smile and gestures to the chair opposite his desk. “Welcome, Special Agent Winchester. Please, have a seat. And I’ve told you, you’re welcome to call me Castiel.”
Charlie rolls her eyes, making her way across Dean’s chambers and plonking herself down onto his bed. If it were anyone else, Dean would be pissed, but since it’s Charlie, he just rolls his eyes. He has known her for over half his life, after all, and has always been one of his closest friends and confidants.
The silence stretches out between them, and Castiel immediately regrets pushing so hard, because sober Dean would definitely be suspicious of his questioning, and just how strongly he's fixated on those two words.
Castiel’s heart judders in his chest. He’s been trained for so many different situations, but now that he’s face-to-face with the vigilante he’s been tracking for so many months, the man who started off as a nemesis and somehow, somewhere along the line, became an ally…
The boy gives him a smile that seems like more of a practiced smirk than anything, but it’s still the first proper expression that Castiel has seen from his since he busted onto the rooftop. “Shoulda seen the other guys,” the boy says. He pulls his leather jacket closer around his body and watches Cas. “How about you? Why are you up here?”
Dean blinks at him, and then his mouth curves into a sweet, happy smile. He presses a kiss to Castiel’s lips, and when he pulls back, his expression is soft. His eyes sparkle.
than okay. No sign of Zachariah? His boyfriend happy? A chance to talk to his work friends as well as to mingle with some of the people he admires?
He’ll be back tomorrow, Castiel is sure—he always visits for a few days in a row, before he goes off to work or hunt again—but all his time with Dean is so precious, and missing even a single day still
Even once they’re out of earshot, it’s a few moments before Dean speaks. Castiel doesn’t press him, just waits patiently.
Now that he’s here with Dean, part of him—the impulsive, biology-driven part—relaxes in the sub’s presence. Dean
There’s some unintelligible grumbling, and then a muttered, “Just leave me to die,” which Dean can’t help but snort at.
“Yeah, he’s okay,” Castiel throws back, and the jitters turn to warmth in his chest as he sets about fixing his own breakfast.
“Alright,” he tells her with a laugh, watching as her cheeks turn as red as her hair. “I’ll see you next week, Charlie. You’ll have to wait and see what happens with me ‘n Cas.”
Castiel looks down at the linoleum table top beside his coffee and sighs. Was it too much to ask for this conversation to go smoothly? “I’m getting a tattoo, Inias. You didn’t hear me the first time?”
touch, that’s the cause. Dean makes a quiet sound and leans into it for a moment, and then he grins up at Castiel, bottom lip caught between his teeth.
When Dean is gone, it’s like there’s a hole in his heart, a yearning void that can only be filled by green eyes and a beautiful Kansas drawl. The sun comes out when he’s around, and Castiel feels impossibly more alive, but it hurts more and more each time he leaves, when Castiel finds himself alone once again.
And that’s why he forces himself to loosen his grip, holding the old woman’s hand loosely and watching as she slowly fades away, her serene eyes the last thing to disappear completely.
When they separate, Cas’s hands still cling to Dean’s jacket, as though he’s unwilling to let him drift away again. Dean leans close, the edge of the barrier biting into his chest. “You came,” he says, breathless and exhilarated.
He sings out his feelings, everything he wishes he could say to Cas, closing his eyes halfway through and just letting himself go. So much to say, so much still left unsaid, so many feelings bottled up inside him with no way out. Even if Cas isn’t here to hear this tonight, at least it’s a start.
All he gets from Dean for a few seconds is a confused look, and a slight tilt of his head. “What?” Dean says eventually, as though Castiel has said something that he can’t quite wrap his mind around. “Cas, you—don’t you know what today is?”
Dean makes a quiet sound, and when Castiel looks up, his eyes are hooded, dark with pleasure. His lip is caught between his teeth, and it muffles the moan that rumbles from his chest when Cas wraps his lips around the head of his cock. “Ah, ah,” Castiel reprimands, gentle but firm, even with Dean’s erection bumping against his bottom lip. “I want to hear you, Dean.”
There’s no way Dean—or any witch, for that matter—can possibly go through life without a familiar. Witches who have tried, who have insisted that they don’t need a bond to temper their magic, have been slowly driven mad by it over time. The bond of a familiar is strong, and sacred, and only to be shared with those who are the most compatible.
As he exhales, he feels himself deflate, the panic and turmoil draining out of him and leaving a bone-deep weariness in its place.
in his apartment—before Inias arrives. Usually he’d go digging for some snacks so that he feels like he’s playing the proper host, but tonight he just doesn’t have the energy or the impulsion. Instead, he pulls a bottle of tequila down from the top shelf of his cupboard and calls it a day.
And then he remembers the summers he spent as a teenager down by the lake, how he’d shared his first
It's small—a fucking Honda Civic or something, by the look of it—and Dean isn't expecting it to stay. Anyone driving a car like that shouldn't be out when a tornado really gets going. The only reason Dean and Sam use the Impala instead of trading in for something a little more solid is because it was the car John had first gone chasing in, and it holds a sentimental value. It's by no means a beginner's car, but they've learned by now how to keep it and themselves safe, so it's a risk they're willing to take. Besides, it's what's made them so recognisable. Everyone knows the Winchester boys by their car.
Castiel stays at his desk for another ten minutes, just focusing on calming himself down as he runs through his end-of-work-day routine, then packs his bag and hightails it out of the building. It’s dark outside now, and he pulls down the sleeves of his coat and hunches his shoulders as he makes his way through the crowds of people either on their way home as well, or going out for the night. He’s giving off a definite ‘don’t talk to me’ vibe, and he’s fine with that.
When they agree, the stakes doubled, is when things start to go wrong. Dean sinks his balls with practiced ease, trouncing his opponents soundly and with a smirk that never wavers. The naïve façade is gone—except, as he collects his winnings after the game, he shrugs one shoulder and grins.
He shifts, pulling back so he can sit up and pull his shirt the rest of the way off—then takes a second to just admire Dean, his bowed legs splayed out and already looking absolutely
Dean doesn’t even pause, just shrugs one shoulder and nods. “Sure, Cas. What’re you feeling? Diner food? Pizza? Chinese? They just opened a new burger place down the street, we could go there.”
effect at all. Something else is in control of Dean’s ship now, and it’s all he can do to brace himself and hope that he makes it out alive.
As soon as it hits the ground, Cas is sliding up behind him on his knees, chest pressing against Dean’s back and hands sliding over his bared torso. “Beautiful,” he murmurs into Dean’s ear, and Dean melts back against him, his eyes fluttering closed. Even the simple drag of Cas’s fingertips over his skin is intoxicating, and when they drift down towards the waistband of his jeans, his breath hitches.
And when their pie is brought out, they share slices, their fingers touching shyly across the tabletop and soft smiles bright enough to light the entire room.
When Dean comes to Castiel and tells him he’s not allowed to go up by the church for the next few days, Castiel’s interest is immediately piqued.
Because when the man yells, “Out you come, boys!”, out of the shadows walk two very familiar men. They step into the sickly glow of the streetlight and stand side by side, posture perfectly straight. There’s a glazed look in their eyes, and Castiel realises that they’re well and truly under this man’s spell.
The ship brakes at the very last second, just enough to lessen the impact slightly, but it’s far too late.
"Here we are," Uriel announces as they approach the drawbridge, which has been lowered in preparation of their arrival. The horses' hooves clatter on the wood as they canter across—and then they're inside the walls.
“I figured, with your reputation,” she muses icily, “that you’d at least know how to draw a proper devil’s trap. Very sloppy of you, Castiel. And you don’t even have an angel to protect you.”
He observes the world with eyes that must have seen so much, a patient weight to his gaze that feels ever-so-slightly familiar. Castiel stands in the middle of the path and watches him, curious.
With all his plants checked, Castiel moves onto his next option: cleaning. Usually, cleaning his apartment is something that helps him to settle his mind. Organization or cleaning of any kind is good, he’s found, but there’s just something so satisfying about having his apartment neat and presentable that satisfies some deep-down part of him.
"Sam," Sam corrects from the backseat, then puts his other headphone over his ear and gives Dean a knowing look in the rearview mirror.
“Are you okay?” Dean asks as he pushes himself back onto his heels, giving Castiel space to sit up and do a quick bodily inventory. All parts seem to still be attached and functioning, even if they feel like they’re made of lead.
Dean snorts as he makes his way over with the two mugs of coffee. He hands one to Castiel, then steps back and looks at him thoughtfully. “You know you don’t have to keep working for them, right? You could do what I do. Be a Man of Letters.”
Dean is leaning against the building, his head tipped back against the stone, hands pushed deep into his pockets. There are bags under his eyes, and he looks
It’s the end of a long day, and Dean is lying on his bed watching Netflix when there’s a knock on his door.
So he buries himself in work. In his activities. Buys two new plants the very next day, runs twice as far as he usually would, tries a series of new poses that leave him a sweaty, frustrated mess on the floor of his living room, all in the vain hope of escaping the specter of Dean Winchester that feels as though it haunts his every waking moment.
News has been travelling around the city of the masked man with a voice like honeyed whiskey who can make anyone do anything he wants with barely more than a few words. It explains how the vigilante (a word that Castiel even says in his
“You can prepare the dessert and bring it through to the living room,” he decides—still keeping control, but letting Dean have his small moment of pushback. Fucking hell, this is hard. “I’ll be waiting there, and we can eat our dessert while we watch Netflix—
And then he forces the thought out of his mind, and slowly crawls under the blankets that haven’t been used since he was last here. He’s so tired and so heavy that sleep is quick to take him, his heart aching.
Usually, Dean is good at sitting still, content to stay in whatever position he picks. Tonight, however, he’s fidgety—sometimes it’s just small adjustments to his posture, but occasionally he shifts position entirely. It’s as though he can’t quite get comfortable, as though there’s something he
the top of his list for the day. Instead, he throws together a quick breakfast, then pulls on his clothes and heads out to survey his farm.
And then he disappears from Dean's sight, rummaging around beneath his workstation to find his missing timer.
Her voice is pitched low and sultry, and Dean has to fight to keep his disgust from showing in his expression. He needs to cut this off immediately. “I’m sorry,” he says bluntly, lifting his glass of wine and pushing his other hand into the pocket of his coat, “but despite being here, I’m not interested in finding a familiar to bond tonight. You’re best off looking elsewhere.”
“Shoot it, Cas!” Dean shouts, his voice thick with pain, and it’s only due to so many years of hunting and his own quick reactions that he’s able to fire two shots into the werewolf’s skull.
It seems like a beehive should have more protection than just a few well-tightened straps, and Dean can’t help but eye it with concern, even as Castiel turns the truck off and opens the door.
So he sits on his front step with his diary and alternates between writing and looking up at the stars, filling page after page with whatever comes to mind. So much of it is about Cas—about the possibility of a new beginning, a spark of happiness where there had been none before, about his sense of humour and awkward grumpiness and everything that Dean likes about him. The words flow when he writes about Cas, and before he realises, time has crept well into the early hours of the morning, and his eyelids are drooping.
"I'll go into the bathing ensuite," Castiel suggests, making his way over and carefully picking up his outfit. This close, Dean can't help but watch the way his hair curls just slightly behind his ears, or the kind crinkle of his eyes when he looks over.
"I'm gonna trust that that's the truthful answer," he murmurs. "But you seriously couldn't have told me that before?"
“Yes,” Castiel says quietly. “That is what I meant. But that’s not your fault, Dean, just as I know now that it’s not my fault, either. It just is what it is—but I hope that now you can see things from my perspective, now that you know the full story.” He gives Dean a small, tentative smile, trying not to admire the way that the light of the setting sun makes Dean’s green eyes glow. “I hope we can be friends, you and I.”
Castiel doesn’t hesitate to lean forward and kiss him, relishing the taste of his own precome on Dean’s tongue. He spends a few seconds learning the shape of Dean’s lips against his own once more, then releases Dean’s hair to let his hands wander south, to the button and fly of Dean’s jeans.
of pool hustling and betting. It all adds up—although it’s definitely nothing fancy. One bedroom, and a lot of DIY projects, but it’s mine. And… well…”
“Nor I,” Cas echoes. His hands continue to move over Dean’s skin. “Not that I’m complaining, however. I just wanted a walk to clear my head, but this was infinitely preferable to being murdered in the woods.”
Not because of the sports themselves. No, he likes college sports because of the cheerleaders—and one cheerleader in particular.
And so Castiel sets out to do his job every day with renewed vigour, and a determination to bring down whoever is behind the mask and the voice, to show them that no one is above the law.
So when he kneels at the end of his bed one night and pours his heart out about the one person in his life he couldn’t live without…
Castiel frowns—that seems very soon. He’s not sure that he feels ready to jump into anything that quickly. It might be good to get it over with, though, so he doesn’t have to overthink anything. Then, hopefully, he can going back to being normal for as long as he can. “Um. Yes?”
So when he turns up one day with a grin from ear to ear, Castiel is not expecting the nature of his news to be what it is
Cas can’t help the tiny smile that tugs at the corner of his mouth. Dean seems keen to see him, if the speed of his replies and the smiley face are anything to go by. Some of his worries dissipate, and as he sets his phone aside and returns to his work, he soon realizes that he’s
The years wear on, and the two of them continue to be inseparable. Wherever one goes, the other is often not far behind, and they spend more than a few nights together in the bed in Dean’s quarters. Those years are the best years of Dean’s life.
When Dean sells his soul, he’s given a year to live. How the fuck does someone fit an entire lifetime into one year?
“Yeah,” he says, even though he can feel his throat closing up with the intensity of the emotions that are washing over him. “Yeah, I’m fine.”
All too soon, they find themselves standing at the front entrance to the museum, staring up at the grand doors that have never felt imposing until tonight.
His chest feels too tight, as though it’s being crushed against the chair, and he can’t breathe. The room feels as though it’s swimming in front of his eyes, and he hasn’t experienced anything like this since—well, since his eighteenth birthday.
Most of the time, Dean takes his work incredibly seriously, but sometimes there are nights like tonight where they can both feel in their bones that their work isn’t leading anywhere. Castiel is
When they load his body onto the wagon to begin the journey back to his hometown, the horses know. They roll their eyes and stamp their feet in place, anxious. The smell of death hangs on the air.
He shoots Castiel a grin from where he’s standing by the stove, one that’s teasing and playful but that carries an underlayer of sincerity.
house would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but for Castiel, the ancient, priceless artifacts that he keeps in his house are just another mundane reminder of what his life used to be life.
But as those words ring in his head, the warmth of a kind man who couldn’t have been certain that Cas was there but had wished him a Merry Christmas anyway…
He’s back by the pine tree, which is definitely not where he’d been before. It’s a few seconds before his memory comes back, his mind clouded and disoriented, but then the image of that car comes back in vivid detail.
“Not really,” he says, watching them go with a smile. “They’re all different, you know. You wanna try making one?”
"That's amazing," Castiel breathes, watching as the pear becomes a door handle in front of their very eyes. "I knew the kitchens were here, I just never knew that you could get in."
. “Because it’s bad enough to know that there are people out there whose job it is to die in my place, but knowing that
“Yeah.” Dean clears his throat, looking out over the hill to the town beneath them and beyond, where the sun is starting to sink toward the horizon. “When I could talk to you, see you… it freaked him out. I guess he assumed you had something to do with my mom dying, or disappearing, and as time went on… I think things got twisted around in his head. He started teaching himself to hunt ghosts, and the deeper he went, the more he found out about. There’s some scary shit out there, but it was the spirits he was really focused on. Taught me ‘n Sam how to force them to cross over, how to fight them if they were malevolent. And he told me…”
His words make Dean pause, looking back over his shoulder guiltily from where he’s lowering the plates into the sink. Castiel waves a hand and stands up. “It’s fine, Dean. There wasn’t much to clear away anyway. Thank you for being proactive.”
“Me too,” he says weakly. He feels pale. Unsteady. “I… I don’t think I’m feeling that well. I’m going to go clear up my desk and head home—can we talk more tomorrow?”
The guy stares helplessly at the paper in Dean’s hand, as though if he wishes hard enough, he can will it out of existence. It becomes clear after a few moments that that isn’t going to work, though, so instead he just gives a long-suffering sigh and says, “Yes, I think you’re right.”
Dean starts to formulate his plan. It's petty, and childish, and it's definitely not the best use of time, but it's sure as hell going to make him feel better after the way that Novak's comments have put him off ever since that interaction.
And now it’s Castiel’s turn to say, “Oh.” Dean smiles at him when he looks over, and there’s nothing but acceptance and understanding there. For the first time, sharing this part of himself feels like a weight has been lifted off Castiel’s shoulders.
Lying on the ground underneath him, his wings sprawled out to each side, blue eyes wide and earnest and fixed on Dean. It’s as though time slows to a halt, just for a moment.
It’s cheesy and adorable and when Dean leaves the farmers’ market another hour later with the candle in his pocket, Cas’s number in his phone and a date scheduled for tonight, he can’t keep the smile off his face.
Glad that he didn’t have to explain (or defend) himself, Castiel follows Dean towards the back, staying a step behind to let him lead but also endlessly curious about what’s waiting for them downstairs. He’s heard a lot about establishments like these, after all—that they’re illicit, immoral, dens of sin and iniquity—but Dean is buzzing with adrenaline and anticipation that makes Castiel impatient to find out what the big deal is.
Castiel is also the one to build him back up again; to harness his ever-collapsing entropy and halt it, to put him back together as he once had with his own two hands, so long ago that it feels like a lifetime now. That is what he is to Dean, and Dean is something similar to him, and it’s fucked up, but it’s
Far above the trees, where the clouds touch the sky and that blue-white openness is all the eye can see, Castiel flies. He is to the sky what a dolphin is to the waves; beautiful, elegant, powerful. This is his home, and he owns it with grace, great black wings flexing to catch every current and updraft. The wind blows against his hair, his feathers, and he laughs joyfully.
Shifters are one of Castiel’s least favourite monsters to hunt. As if seeing one’s own self reflected back isn’t unnerving enough, the way the creatures are able to get inside his brain with his own knowledge and pick him apart always puts Castiel on edge.
Everything here reminds him of Dean, and so in an effort to get away from it all, the thoughts and memories of Dean that linger as though his ghost is
does, since he just looks like a young man sitting by himself and playing music in the middle of a cemetery. Castiel always glares at the ones who give Dean rude looks. It makes him feel better, even if they can’t see his disapproval.
Before he can reply, though, Johnnie’s form starts to become even more transparent, until Castiel can see the grass through him. His arms are no longer embracing the boy, but passing through him and then Castiel blinks, and he’s gone.
And then he’s kissing Cas, kissing him with frustration and anger, biting at his lips and pulling at his hair. Cas gives back as good as he gets, digging his nails into Dean’s skin while he reaches out blindly for the nearest available surface to put his cigarette out on. Dean’s air tastes like smoke and whiskey and a little bit of weed, and he drinks it in like he’s drowning. Drinks
Castiel’s interest is now doubly piqued, and he sets his papers aside, focusing his attention solely on Dean. “I am,” he confirms, and gestures to the chair opposite his desk. “Please, take a seat.”
Cas hesitates, glancing toward the entrance to the tent where Bobby and Rufus are surely waiting outside. “…Castiel,” he says finally. “Or Cas. But you don’t need to be formal with me. Not after last night.”
Dean whips around, his eyes wide. He'd been so sure that he'd been alone in the kitchen—Castiel had packed up his station, talked with the others like he was going home, but here he is, standing guiltily at the end of Dean's countertop. For a second, Dean opens and closes his mouth, and then sets his face into a scowl.
The silence between them stretches out. Dean doesn't know what he's supposed to say, standing here in the corridor in the early hours of the morning, opposite the boy who has no idea Dean's in love with him.
It’s a kind offer. “Thank you,” he says, giving her a quick smile that he doesn’t feel. He won’t go, but at least it means she’s looking out for him.
to the king. That’s an added layer of stress he hadn’t quite needed for this assignment, but he’s worked under more difficult conditions before. It makes him wonder if he’ll get to
All in all, there's a good atmosphere in the kitchen today. Considering the snow swirling outside and the bleak, grey appearance of the city skyline, it's definitely nicer to be inside near the warmth of the ovens and in the company of good friends.
“Unless, I, uh,” he stammers, shifting on his feet. “Unless you want me to sleep on the couch or something. I don’t wanna misread—“
He does his best not to prompt. Not to push. If Dean wants to share, he can do so in his own time, no matter how insatiably curious Castiel is feeling.
They don’t know exactly where they’re going—and really, isn’t that the fun of it? All that’s important is their car, and their music, and each other’s company. They’ve been friends for as long as they can remember,
It would be easy to be content with that. With staying put, and setting down roots, and letting fate continue to sweep him along this path. He stays in his job, meets someone nice, starts a family right here in Lawrence and never leaves.
Finally, the rope comes loose, and as the pressure around Dean’s chest disappears, all the force that had been keeping him upright against the pole goes as well, and he pitches face-first into the sea. When he reappears, he’s spluttering, churning the water with his hands to keep himself upright.
Dean nods, the corners of his mouth pulled down in sympathy. He must be used to questions like this. “It’s always hard to lose a loved one, Cas,” he says gently. “But time heals all wounds. Your brother will struggle, but ultimately, yes, they’ll all be okay.”
Over and over again—like that’s the only thing that Cas is capable of broadcasting right now. But Dean doesn’t. He
They move slow, as though time is slightly off-kilter, and there’s a hazy quality to their movements. Castiel has to really focus on them for the waviness to stop. Where are they going? And why are they moving with such… urgency?
He doesn’t know which of them initiates the kiss—just that it’s everything he’d ever wished it could be.
Cheeks burning with pure mortification, Dean pulls out his wallet and slides his license onto the scanner, which responds with a much more positive beep. “Sorry about that,” he mutters quietly, unable to even look the cute TSA agent in the eyes, fixing his gaze instead on the name badge that reads
The truth is that Castiel is ready to do whatever Dean could possibly ask of him. He nods, watching as Dean rubs his hands together in excitement.
The guy gives him a quick look up and down, so brief that Castiel might have missed it, but he doesn’t. And it piques his interest, reconsidering his first heterosexual assessment—
They wake up on the couch, Dean’s head pillowed on Cas’s chest and the blankets wrapped so snugly around them that there’s no hope of subtle extrication. It’s so
It’s not at all what Castiel was expecting him to say, and he blinks, caught off guard. He’s spent the whole weekend ignoring Dean’s texts, and now Dean wants to get dinner with him? It feels like there’s some kind of ulterior motive behind the offer, but Castiel has no idea what it could be, even as he turns the question over in his mind.
He stops Dean mid-sentence, leans in close and kisses him, long and slow and deep. “What was that for?” Dean asks breathlessly when he pulls back, his grin shining bright.
John nods approvingly, while Dean feels like his heart might shatter. He doesn't even get to have his wedding here, with his family and his friends? Sure, they'll have the 'other ceremony' here, but on the night he meets his future husband, when he devotes himself to someone forever...
Dean just laughs, and enjoys the feeling of the wind in his hair as he urges the Impala on, further, faster.
Dean, but Castiel is pretty sure that he can outlast any of Dean’s attempts to annoy him into leaving early.
For a few seconds, Novak keeps up the innocent expression—and then it morphs into a wicked smile, and he shrugs his shoulders. "You seemed so keen on the
If he’s honest, Castiel doesn’t fully expect Dean to return the next day. He watches the sunrise from his tree, arms wrapped around his knees as he replays every second of his encounters with Dean over and over in his head.
up onstage making fools of themselves. They pout and gently try to get him to stay, but it must be clear that he’s done, because eventually they give up and say goodnight.
There’s an ache in his chest that he hasn’t felt this strongly for a long time, and he feels so very alone.
“C’mon,” he says, and there’s no universe in which his smile couldn’t raise Dean’s spirits even just a little bit. “Only a couple more hours left, right? We’ve got this.”
They’re few and far between, but they do happen sometimes, when all the local hunts are being taken care of and no one urgently needs them for research or advice. On these quiet days, they don’t have to be hunters.
Disappointed by the lack of consequences, Dean stands, ready to keep exploring the chamber to see if there’s anything else that could be the ‘heart’ that the texts had referred to.
“I certainly don’t like having them unannounced.” Castiel makes his way along the empty hallway, ignoring the doors that lead off it—weapons storage, interrogation room, the garage full of stolen cars and bags of drugs. Instead, they stop at the door at the end of the corridor, and Castiel looks back at Dean, making sure he communicates the full heat of his intentions through his gaze. “For someone like you, though… I’ll make an exception.”
“No.” Castiel takes a deep breath, straightens his spine. “No, I need to do this. I need to face her. But Dean… there’s something I need you to do for me.”
Dean looks. His shoulders look a little slumped, and there are bags under his eyes that certainly hadn’t been there on Saturday. His brows crease in concern, and he leans forward across the table.
He leans his hip against the edge of his counter and drinks his coffee, letting the heat of the mug warm his hands. It’s cold out, which makes life a little more difficult for the plants out the back (who are, thankfully, more hardy), but inside his shop he keeps the temperature nice and steady, and it always makes it a nice place to be during the winter. Most of his plants are more than a little temperamental, after all—they’ll find any excuse to be unhappy.
The ugly Continental is parked out the front of the farmhouse, and Dean has never been so happy to see such a shitty car in his life. “Dean Winchester,” he says, and the hunter must have heard of his family, because he raises his eyebrows. “You?”
“You plannin’ on leaving me?” Dean says against his skin, pressing his forehead against the curve of Castiel’s spine. His voice is sleep-roughened, but Castiel can still hear his smile, feel it in the shape of Dean’s lips on his skin.
They climb into bed together, and Castiel had held all these grand aspirations of making love to Dean for the first time in an apartment that is truly their home, but once he’s under the covers with Dean… all he wants to do is be close to his boyfriend, and be able to sleep for however fucking long he wants.
Tucked away behind a stack of books, pressed down by a paperweight, is a stack of papers. They're the exact same colour and size as the paper from every single letter that Dean has ever received from C, and he can't help but reach out to touch them.
Everything about it is slow, gentle, the antithesis to how sex usually is for Dean. But in the quiet of the night, with everything that’s been shared still hanging between them and the moonlight filtering in through the windows, it feels
When Dean isn’t getting used to being able to touch Castiel (still a wonderful novelty, and Castiel doesn’t think that will ever wear off), or adjusting to life as a newly-minted spirit, he’s spending time with Sam. Whenever Sam is at the cemetery, Dean is never far away, and today, he’s lounging on the grass beside his own grave, fingers interlaced behind his head as he looks up at the sky.
.” There’s no response, just crackling static from the prison’s end, but suddenly that becomes the least of Dean’s problems.
From the top of his tree, he watches Dean toss his equipment back into his car. He lingers in the parking lot for a minute or two before finally driving away, red taillights disappearing down the winding cemetery road and into the darkness.
Castiel turns up to the hay shed to find Dean standing outside it, his bag packed and hat pulled down low over his eyes. He’s waiting. For Castiel? It would’ve have been so easy for him to just leave, disappear without a trace, but…
“How’d you like your first Pride, Cas?” Sam asks. Somewhere along the line, he’d ended up with glitter in his hair, and after much of Dean’s grumbling and Sam’s failure to displace much of it, he’d been relegated to the backseat. Castiel has a feeling that Dean would have been more annoyed about the prospect of having glitter in his car, were he not also still feeling the after-effects of the parade.
shows up. After all, Castiel Novak is the only guy who can give Dean a run for his money in the fashion department, and he always looks forward to their friendly showdowns.
The first ficlet has art from the amazing c-kaeru, so go give it a rebagel to show her how much you love it! (
Castiel doesn’t reply—just smiles that knowing smile, gives him a wink, and pushes open the door ahead of Dean.
A weakness that takes the form of a roguish, yet self-deprecating smile, with capable hands and a voice that, Castiel is sure, would sound beautiful begging his name every night.
With gentle hands, Dean guides Castiel over to the grave. At the foot stands the asphodel, but as they kneel down beside the grave, Castiel catches sight of a tiny sprout right in the middle of his grave, one that definitely had not been there the last time he’d visited.
The first half of the race hadn’t been so bad. Dean had been targeted, of course, but the new diversion systems he’d installed had kept him out of the way of most of the laser shots sent his way. (The buildings that had taken the hits instead of him hadn’t been too lucky, but that is always the case with the races; it is part and parcel of living in such a wild place.)
And Castiel understands why as he moves closer and pinpoints the outline of a door, barely distinguishable from the wall.
Dean is totally happy watching people fuck up watermelon carvings and horrifyingly complex cakes, and leaving Cas to keep plugging away at the research. From the way Cas snorts at some of the jokes and makes quietly horrified sounds when the creations are revealed, however, he is splitting his attention somewhat.
, he thinks to himself. Even if it’s just enough to start the ball rolling, to get the police to dig into the other shady things that Naomi and Adler have surely been getting up to, that will be good enough for him.
shitty. What a piece of shit.” For a few long moments, they just stand there, leaning against each other. Dean reaches back, and runs his fingers through the short hair at the nape of Castiel’s neck, soothing. “So there’s no way to get out of the dinner?” he asks after a little while.
Dean tests him like nothing has before, with his easy charm and dogged loyalty, and the way his smile sets alight something in Castiel’s chest that feels like a hundred hummingbird wings. A human should not be able to elicit this kind—or
Anna leaves a few steps ahead of Castiel, but before he can follow her out the door, Dr. Adler grabs him by the wrist, halting his progress. “I know it’s demeaning for someone of our status to work under a sub,” he says quietly, close enough to Castiel’s ear for him to feel the damp condensation of his breath, “but you know how it is—quotas to be filled and all that jazz. Don’t you worry, though. I’ll sort it out soon, and you’ll get the role that a promising young Dom like you deserves. Just be patient.”
Ever since he was able to visit without Naomi, Castiel has come to the cemetery just to talk to his father. He never gets any kind of response—never expects any kind of response—but it does help. As long as he has someone to talk to, even if it’s the headstone of his father who’s ten years gone, all his issues feel just a fraction lighter on his shoulders.
He can ask Dean if he would be amenable to that next time, but for now, he tries his best to keep himself still and let Dean show him what he can do.
. They don’t have to worry about saving the world, and even though they’re always ready and their house is painstakingly protected, their life is quiet. Peaceful. Uneventful. For the first time, Castiel has a chance to just
The interviewer says something in response, probably making some closing remarks for the cameras, but Castiel doesn’t really pay attention to any of it. Instead, his focus is on Dean—the steady solidness of his presence, the quick squeeze of his hand, the smile that curls his lips when Castiel looks over at him, that feels like it’s just for him.
He was a hunter. Hunters didn’t live to see life past thirty-five—maybe forty, if you were good at what you did. Once you knew about the things that were out there, there was no getting out of the life, and once you got old, you got slow.
He rubs the back of his neck awkwardly, and Castiel gives him a smile to reassure him that it’s fine. “I understand, Dean. It’s okay. Did you find anything?”
Cas’s brows crease in a frown. “Actually, that would be far too much water for them—most of them are succulents or indoor plants that don’t need very regular watering, that much all at once would give them root rot, and—“
Dean is doing a very good job at keeping his anger under wraps, but Castiel can feel it in him as they stand up from their chairs.
“I’m an expensive man,” Castiel quips back with a smirk, reaching up for the bourbon, then closing his liquor cabinet. When he turns to set the bottle on his desk, he finds Dean leaning against the dark wood, hands pushed into the pockets of his jeans. His medusa piercing glints, drawing Castiel’s attention down to his lips. “What made you come here today?” he asks, forcing his attention away to pour out their drinks.
But one night—one stupid, drunken night—he gives into curiosity. He’s never met a crossroads demon, and so, in the moonlight, Dean assembles a box and buries it beneath the crossroads near his motel.
In the corner of his eye, Castiel sees the guard freeze, as though he’s just realised how expendable he is to her—but by that point, it’s too late.
The corners of Novak’s mouth turn down. His voice, when he next speaks, is soft, but his words are blunt.
Castiel nods, watching as Dean turns away to retrieve another mug. “I should probably go to work today,” he points out. “The museum lets me have flexible hours, but I do feel like there’s a limit to
The masked man consumes his thoughts. Slowly, Castiel’s attention drifts away from catching the criminals roaming the streets of his city, and instead focuses solely on the man whose voice haunts his dreams every fucking night.
And then he gets his first look at the man it belongs to, and any remaining thoughts he may have had fly out the (metaphorical) window.
As Castiel’s eyes slowly adjust to the darkness, he sees Dean look up at the ceiling for a second. His intake of breath wobbles. “It’s the second,” he says finally, his voice quiet and small.
Now it's Castiel's turn to blush. He rubs the back of his neck and glances away, and isn't that interesting? Dean leans against his broom and waits.
Castiel dumps the tins down onto his countertop, then narrows his eyes at Dean and Charlie, who somehow manage to muffle their laughter enough to play at looking contrite. "I'm guessing this was your doing?" he asks, and Charlie points her finger at Dean.
And then, early one morning, Dean disappears for a little bit with a, “Don’t follow me, Cas, I’ll come find you when it’s ready,” and a teasing kiss that lingers on Castiel’s lips even after he’s gone.
, down towards the water. It leads him along the pier, right to the very end, and as he stands on the edge, looking out over the ocean, his ribs feel as though they’re about to burst with the strength of the feeling pulsing within him.
, but here he is with his righteous man and even though he knows hundreds of languages and thousands of ways to say it, somehow the idea of Dean
“Ah, Mr. Novak, Ms. Milton!” Dr. Adler stands as they enter, greeting them with a smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes and a handshake that is uncomfortably strong. “Take a seat, please. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Novak—I hear you’ve been doing excellent work as a registrar.”
He has no ties to any organization, nor is he involved with the police. Castiel is not stupid. He has done his research. Dean Winchester is merely a man with the voice of an angel, and who has caught the attention of a very influential man indeed.
“How’s breakfast looking?” he says instead, forcing himself away from the window and away from the thoughts, questions,
Castiel’s jokes are terrible and he’s always grumpy before he’s had his morning coffee and he doesn’t understand half of the pop culture references Dean makes, but that’s okay, because Dean is smitten and he spends his whole week looking forward to Saturday, when he can talk to Cas and see him smile.
“Still grumpy that he can’t be out here,” Dean tells them with a grin, “but teaching the young alphas is a good distraction for him. Even with an injured shoulder, he still kicks their asses.”
He scrambles for his machete and leaps out of the Impala, running in the direction of the commotion.
“You,” he breathes, the single syllable barely a sound with how hard it is to squeeze it out of his throat.
Which is why Castiel has volunteered to train a handful of new hunters, teaching them how to deal with a Wendigo that the Men of Letters have only recently been able to locate in the wilderness of Minnesota.
While he’s been sitting, stuck in the paralyzing cage of his own thoughts, night has fallen. The cemetery is empty, the gates locked, and above, dark storm clouds gather thickly against the night sky.
It takes a second for Castiel to register exactly what’s happened, and then he starts to pray—frantically, and more fervently than he’s ever prayed for anything in his life.
Dean raises the door threshold just enough that she trips over it on her way out. She flips him off over her shoulder without looking back, and Dean can’t help but laugh.
A series of dodges and missed blows, feet scraping for purchase on the debris-littered concrete, steel flashing in the dim light and glowing blue eyes far too close for comfort. The djinn is strong, but Castiel is stronger.
Castiel thinks back to that day, when he had found Dean looking over his collection as though he belonged in Castiel’s house, as though he’d simply used his own key to pay a visit.
He’s tall, wearing ripped jeans, combat boots, and an old leather jacket. His hair is a mess, he’s spattered with blood, and the ground around him is littered with all the vampires that Dean had failed to kill.
Castiel could hazard a guess at who that might be. It’s interesting that Dean is still around, though, considering how he’d acted… last night? Two nights ago? Castiel isn’t entirely sure.
Castiel sits back. Hearing all that feels like he’s taken a physical blow to the chest, and he closes his eyes for a moment as he tries to curb the rush of emotion welling up inside him. Around them, the trees start to rustle, their limbs creaking against a nonexistent wind.
Before he can second guess himself, Castiel reaches for his phone and opens his conversation with Dean.
It’s a hard decision to make. The hardest of his life. But when he’s accepted into a postgrad program at Stanford, halfway across the country… it feels like a sign. It feels like the world opening up before him.
It’s the same as with women. If anything, he hits the pain-point faster—because guys are much more direct than girls, he’s sure. It’s definitely not because it takes less time for him to seriously start entertaining ideas of fucking whoever he’s talking to.
The snow comes, and then melts away again. Summer passes, followed by another winter, then another summer. Castiel sees many people come through his cemetery in the years that follow, and helps many spirits pass on.
That pulls a chuckle from Dean. "Let them wait," he declares, cupping Castiel's cheek with his other hand and kissing him.
They had started out as young men, fit and stubborn, with something to prove to a world that felt as though it was against them even from the start. Now, though, they’re older, and while they aren’t necessarily
His battery is shorted out, irreparable apart from a replacement or access to a new power source to bring it back to life, and all he can do is watch while the other racers fly past. It’s too late in the race now to be able to swap out, and Dean knows that he’s done for. He’s going to have to wait until next year to be able to reclaim his dad’s title, and he bites back bitter tears of frustration.
And there it is. The thing that Castiel has always been sought out for, the thing that makes him valuable, an
"I love you too, Dean Michael," he says, his voice tinged with amusement, and then they're kissing again, and Dean is more than happy to let everything else slip away.
Castiel grits his teeth, strengthens his will, and holds onto that thought. It had helped him the last time he needed to save Dean—he just has to pray that it will help him now.
And there it is. It’s exactly what Castiel had been afraid of, that Dean would outstrip him, push him into things that
But none of his colleagues are looking towards him. Instead, they’re looking towards the precinct entrance. He turns to look, and there, standing at the entrance of the bullpen…
He’d gotten a house, and a garden, and a simple life that is quiet but that he loves with all his heart. He’d gotten himself a hobby, and a job providing restoration services at the local garage.
It's a gamble, but one that pays off, from the way Cas breaks into a smile even wider than the one before. "A date," he repeats, a hint of wonder and excitement in his voice. "It's a date."
“What the hell was that?” Dean hisses, and there’s anger in his voice, but it’s not hard to pick out the worry that undercuts it as well. “What were you thinking, disappearing like that? One second you’re there and then I look away for a
They finish their food in silence. Cas helps Dean up when they stand, because suddenly he feels exhausted—exhausted by the lateness of the evening, and by the relentlessness of the thoughts that just won't leave him alone tonight. He collects his broom, and then follows Castiel back out of the painting and into the corridor.
They’re just yards away from their goal when a bullet hits the bow of the boat, burrowing into the engine with a
But, once again, his hands land solidly on Dean’s shoulders, and he gives them a gentle squeeze. “Come on,” he tells Dean, his voice soft. Every word feels like it’s breaking his heart even more. “Let’s join them up on the hill.”
say that he doesn’t really know where to start. Should he talk about Saturday? Or ask what Dean is doing right now?
“Bossy,” Castiel mutters with a grin, but reaches for the last pie nonetheless. When he holds it out to Dean, the sub is much less shy about curling his tongue around Cas’s fingers, and once he’s taken it from Castiel’s hand, he rests his cheek against his knee once more.
Inias went home late last night, he remembers, saying something about still having to work tomorrow. He’d gone to the effort of making sure Cas made it to bed though, if the pajamas and bottle of water on his bedside table are anything to go by. Upon closer inspection, there’s also a bottle of aspirin and a little note that says:
“Yes,” he says, and his voice is deep and serious, but there’s a lightness in his eyes that makes Dean’s breath catch in his throat. “It’s me. My name is Castiel.”
The flowerbeds are full of bright, yellow flowers. Castiel had put all his effort into growing every single one of the daffodils that now stand in the soil, petals facing up towards the sun. They’ve always been some of Castiel’s favourite flowers, and now he hopes that he can share that with Dean.
On New Year’s Eve, Dean brings beers and his radio to the cemetery. It’s cold, so cold, but Dean insists that he doesn’t feel it, tucked up in his thick jacket and beanie like he is.
Castiel’s cemetery is blanketed in a thin layer of snow, everything powder-white and perfectly still.
Dean sets the coffee down in front of his grumpy boyfriend and waits for him to notice. The moment he does is clear—Cas’s face lights up, and his frown disappears.
There’s genuine gratitude in his voice, and when Castiel looks over at him, they share a smile. It’s soft and intimate and for just a moment, it feels like everything else in the world falls away.
Dean has never been tempted by crossroads deals. Too shady, too unpredictable. He can solve his problems himself.
Dean blinks, as though he’s been caught off guard by the question. “I have to be,” he says, and Castiel’s breath stutters.
He keeps finding himself dozing off at his post. He doesn’t usually sleep unless he’s properly disappearing for a while, but right now he keeps losing time. A few minutes here, a few minutes there, and the quick breaks are probably the only thing keeping him going right now considering how exhausted he is, but there’s still that terror in the back of his mind about missing Dean.
He waits for what must be an hour, and then another, and another, until night is falling and he has not moved. Is he doing something wrong? Is there a heaven, or a hell? Has his life on Earth made him unworthy of
Having foreseen this possibility, he’s brought a sizeable amount of his work home with him. Now he sets himself up on his couch with his laptop and a coffee (
left. Your father did not look happy after you mentioned me—looking back on that moment now, it doesn’t surprise me to know that he was afraid of me. To know what he became because you met me.”
Still, even though he likes figuring out what Dean likes and what drives him wild, he doesn’t want to torture him. Not this morning, when the sun is barely peeking through the window and they’re still sleep-drowsy, their voices rough and movements slow.
There are pain meds in one of the drawers, and Dean fumbles around in the dark until his fingers close around the bottle. When he opens the cap, several pills spill out into his hand, and he inhales a shuddering breath.
Bobby leans his elbows onto the table, gesturing at the small figurines that represent Eden’s forces. “We’ve been here for almost a month,” he says, “and we’ve had no luck in breaking through the enemy’s defences yet. The king will be arriving later this week to review our strategies and join the battle, and we’d like to have some new information to provide him with. That’s why we need you.”
Naomi smiles thinly. Beside her, Zachariah smirks like a smug toad, as though reuniting mother and son is the best thing he’s ever done. For once, though, Adler is the least of Castiel’s worries.
Cas’s heart skips a beat at that, because he’d almost forgotten the question he’d asked Dean last night, and hopefully ‘I’ll talk to you tonight’ means that Dean will have an answer for him by then. He’s not sure how long he can wait before his nerves get the better of him, but he knows that he has to be patient and let Dean come to his own conclusions by himself.
Castiel blinks up at Dean, his brain still half-fogged with sleep. He’d been having such a nice dream…
The sun is starting to set outside now, blue-black shadows creeping into Castiel’s apartment and enveloping it. It’s getting late, but the unsettled jitteriness still remains.
Dean rolls out his neck, then fishes the keys out of his pocket. "Let's get outta here, then. Homewards we go. And hey—if the storm doesn't pan out, then hey, at least we can visit Mom."
He moans and arches his back more, dropping down to his elbows and angling his face towards the camera so they can see just how desperate he is for Cas’s touch.
He doesn't want to think about that right now, though. For the first time this season, they've got their strongest lead, and they're perfectly positioned, right on the edge of where the storm is brewing. They're not in its way, according to Sam, instead just skirting the outer edge and able to move along with it if they have to, so for now... they just have to wait and see if anything touches down.
It’s been the perfect night. All their family and friends are here, everything has gone smoothly, and to top it all off, Cas looks fucking
“Well, Dean,” Castiel says, turning back towards the control panel. “Nice to meet you. I wish it wasn’t under these circumstances, but…” He shrugs one shoulder, tapping the computer screen and making a few adjustments to the autopilot’s trajectory. “Desperate times and all that. And now that you’re aiding and abetting my escape, I doubt you really want me to let you go. So I’m very sorry, but you’re stuck with me.”
“Come on,” Castiel tells Dean, letting his hand fall. “Once we’re out of here, I’ll tell you what I found.”
In saunters Cas, wearing that same fucking leather jacket, stubble on his jaw and a smirk curling his lips. He’s gorgeous,
. It’s something that he’d never thought he could ever have with someone who wasn’t unpresented, but here they are, and Castiel continues to surprise himself at every turn. Being with Dean is an adventure that he doesn’t think he’ll ever get tired of.
Castiel fixes her with an unimpressed look, barely refraining from rolling his eyes at her faux-ignorance. “You really believed that manipulating people into making unnecessary demon deals with you wouldn’t earn you a courtesy call from a hunter?”
It's almost nightfall when they reach the border. Dean has been here once before, but it's hazy in his memory, and this? It feels so much sharper, so much more real, because now he's not just riding along it to point at the other side and say that he's seen Eden. No, this time, he's crossing over it.
“Mayday, mayday!” he shouts, trying every possible solution he knows as his ship hurtles towards the prison that is now growing rapidly larger in his front window. If he can’t shut it down, he’s royally fucked. This is
He’s tried so hard to save so many people, but he’s also done so many bad things. He’s run, and he’s failed, and he’s disappointed, and in all honesty, he probably doesn’t deserve to be saved.
