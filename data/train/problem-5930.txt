“Please…Bucky…stop…stop…please.”  Steve pleaded for mercy.
Ten minutes later, he heard a voice.
.”  He responded, sarcasm dripping from his tongue.  “Your body…your holes…belong to me and Thor and your Daddies back home.  It is not for you to decide when you are used.”  He picked her up and secured her on the bench on her abdomen.  “Go on boys.”  He said to the Warriors Three.  The men had waited all night to get a piece of the petite Midgardian.  Fandral stepped up to her mouth and slipped his huge cock in.  He moaned in ecstasy as his dick was enveloped in the warm mouth.  Volstaag stroked his monster cock and shoved it from behind into the waiting pussy.  “Dear god, Thor…I don’t think I’ve ever felt anything so tight!”
“It was a good lesson for her to learn.”  Bucky replied.  “She needs to understand her place…her role.  There’s still a little serum left inside her.  She’ll be fine by morning.”
Tony stepped away and Bucky slipped her off Clint’s cock and place her on the bed stomach down and lifted her hips.  He pushed hard into her cum clicked pussy and groaned at the sensation.  He took longer this time.  He slowed down when he felt himself near completion.  He fucked her for almost thirty minutes before he let himself cum.
important you are to me.”
“Please, Mistress!  It’s so cold there!  Please!”
“That’s a good answer, boy.  Come to Poppa.”  The man’s huge hand guided Clint’s mouth over to his thick, ten-inch cock.  He stuck it all the way in, choking the archer.
“You did a very bad thing, Stevie.”  Bucky started as he sat down on the bed.
Steve turned up the audio.  “What was that, boy?”
Soup and warm mead were brought in and placed on the floor beside Steve.  In a rush to warm, Stevie frantically consumed both.  When she finished, she huddled inside the fur.
“Fine.  But get your asses back here tomorrow.  We’ll check how Cap is doing.”
“Okay, my boy.”  Thanos patted his leg.  He saw only a small hesitation but then Tony straddled his large leg.  This was a position that he had his boys assume on occasion.  “What is it Anthony?”  Thanos added in a gentle tone.
“There is one more lesson for today, child.  When you are done and if you have been performed well, there is a large meal and a warm, warm bed to sleep in.”  She could tell Stevie wanted to speak so she nodded.
“Please…it hurts so much…”
“Yes, what, honey?”
“Maybe.”
Tony had no answer.  He didn’t want him to hurt them.  Tony was still somewhat injured and he had no idea what state Steve was in.  He gently directed Steve into the bathroom and surveyed the area.  There appeared to be a large tub and a faucet like structure.  He turned the water on and was pleased to find it to be a good temperature.  “Come on, Stevie, let’s get cleaned up.”  He sat Steve down on a chair and helped him remove his complicated suit.  “Can’t believe you’re still fighting in this armor.”
“You’re telling me…”  Tony groaned as he stood and lifted her legs and thrust inside her empty pussy.  Stevie yelled out in pain.
One evening, Tony was in the lab perfecting a new weapon he had developed.  He was harnessing some of the energy from the Stones to make hand held weapons for the soldiers.  There was some power left in the Stones.  It certainly was diminished after balancing the universe, but there were some uses for it still.  Tony wanted to ensure that the soldiers around Stevie were well armed to protect him and to defeat their enemies.
“They are, my sons.  They will make wonderful additions to our little family.”  He smiled.

“Now, baby…you need to do better than that.  If you don’t make me come properly, you will be punished.”
“Either suffices, Captain.”
“Please…Bucky…”  He cried out as James thrust up hard.
The super soldier was determined to hurt the being who took everything away.  He wiped out half of humanity.  The Avengers had failed.  As Steve neared his target, Thanos smiled gently; it was so different from the demeanor of their fight.  He held up his gauntlet and pointed it at Steve.  He thought he heard Natasha screaming in the distance.  A glowing form of light surrounded Steve and he fell unconscious.  Thanos picked him up and cradled the human.  He turned to the others and smirked.  He raised his gauntlet and disappeared.
“Yes, Mistress.”
“I know.”  He sighed.
He cut her off.  “They’ll never know if I just use your mouth, will they?”  He stepped closer to her.  “You wouldn’t tell…would you?”  He smirked as he forced her to her knees.  He unbuckled his pants and let them fall to the floor.  His cock was huge, hard and leaking.
Steve stepped over the threshold and was led into a study.  She looked around, taking in the old-world décor.
After some time, Steve spoke again.  “I’m glad it’s you.”  He whispered as if confessing a deep dark secret.
to show me the way.”
Tony wiped the wetness off as he grasped his face.  He needed Steve to focus.  “It’s okay, Steve.  I understand.  I do.”
“Well done, my friends.”  Thor said as he stood.  “I hope you enjoyed the revels.”
“Ask for permission, slave.  You are only allowed pleasure because I allow it.  Your release belongs to me…is determined by me, not you.  You must request authorization to cum.”
“Oh, Anthony.”  He said as he continued stroking his monstrosity.  But suddenly, his cock seemed to retract and soon, it was about 12 inches in size.  It was still wider than 2 human cocks, but appreciably smaller than before.  He lifted Steve’s legs and placed his tip against his fluttering hole.  Tony crawled over to Steve and lay next to him, wiping his tears and stroking his sweaty hair.  “You’re okay.  I’m right here, baby.”  As Thanos pushed inside him, Steve let out a scream in pain as he pushed through his muscle.
“Yes,
When Steve did not answer, Finna grabbed her chin.  “You shall answer yes, Mistress.”  She said forcefully.
“Hey, Pete.”  Tony responded fondly as he held the crying youth in his arms.  A tear fell from his eyes as well.
Bucky and Tony quickly changed into theirs and they walked towards the dining area.  The wonderful smell of food wafted through the air.
Steve practically crawled over to Vision and turned over the dead gray body.  Natasha ran over to him, clutching her abdomen in disbelief.  Bruce, Thor and Rocket stood silently.  Rhodey’s voice pierced the quiet.  “What is this?  What the hell is happening?”  He looked around to the group for answers that no one could give.  They all stared in the distance.  Steve’s eyes watered as he flopped down to a sitting position defeated.  A tear escaped as he whispered in disbelief, “Oh, God.”
“Yes, Daddy.”  She answered without hesitation.  Bucky looked past her to nod at the Asgardians, impressed with her demeanor.
“How?”  Bucky asked.
“It’s
“Good girl.”  Bucky smiled at his Stevie.
“Clit stimulator.”  It started circling her nub.  It built in intensity with each stroke.
of the night as hundreds watch you get ravaged by a tentacle creature.  Its dozens of appendages settling in your holes…suspending you in the air…fucking you for hours and hours with no rest in sight.  You would be on display if it pleases the Grandmaster.  There are so many creatures he could choose from.”  Steve was shaking in fear now.
“I know, Buck.”  Feeling warmed for a moment that Bucky was still in his life.
“No, thank you.”  Steve answered politely as she kept her distance from the stranger.  There was awkward silence for a time before she continued.  “Why am I here?”
A guard announced their arrival.  Thor beckoned them in, and he and his brother laid eyes on their slave for the first time in weeks.  She was beautiful as she dropped gracefully to her knees, supplicating to her Masters.
Thank you for the feedback! It is so appreciated!
“Shit…”  Clint said as his pants tightened during this conversation.  “You guys have fucked?”
“It’s okay for you to come with us.  It’s safe.  We’re your friends.”  Sam said.
Still not looking at him, he replied, “I thought you said it was a curse?”
“What?”  Clint said in surprise but once the image was in his head, he could feel his shorts stirring.
“Yes.”  He lowered his hands to his tiny waist.  “You owe for all the years you made me want you.  All the blue balls you gave me.  You belong to me, Stevie.”
“Stevie,” Bucky began as he looked down at her and gently grasped her chin, “Tony, Clint and I have to go back to New York.  Thor and Loki are going to take you to Asgard with them.”  Her eyes widened in fear as she recalled the cruel words when Loki described his home world.  Her breathing sped up.  She wished she could return to New York.  Maybe she would have a chance to get help.
“We don’t do anything.  Me and Steve.  It’s hard.”  He looked down.  The strain of being sexual playthings was wearing on both of them.  Tony was trying to be strong for both of them, but it was difficult.  He couldn’t help it when his mind drifted to Peter or Pepper or the fact they failed the earth.  As for Steve, he didn’t talk a lot, and when he did, he sounded so young and naïve.  The emotional toll of life and losses rendered him altered forever. Tony thought the Mad Titan liked that.  It seemed to cement the dynamic that he wanted to create.  Tony was trying so hard to preserve as much of himself as possible.
“Your cellie is on the Yard.”
After resting for a few minutes, he got up and dressed.  He picked her up and brought her back to the kitchen.  She looked debauched as she sunk to the floor after he hooked the leash.  He smiled down at her and then got into the glass elevator and descended into the garage.  He was waiting for his Boss when Tony pulled up in the Bugatti.  They stepped from the car.  Iron Man walked up to his employee.
“Loki…come enter her pussy.  We shall share in the spoils.”
“Natasha is well trained, Stevie.  Do you know how long it would take to train you up like that?  In your new body?”
“You did nothing of the sort.  You are selfish.”
“Concentrate on me, sweetheart.  Ignore him.”  He kissed his lips again and was happy to see Steve shakily nod.
As the brunette gazed down at the nude body, he palmed one of the breasts.  They were as soft and supple as they looked.  If it was possible, Bucky became even harder.  He looked down at Steve’s bare pussy…he wanted to thank the witch for that.  He appeared so innocent and pure.  He couldn’t wait to pound into his Stevie.  He smiled as he heard the other men in the room disrobe.  No one spoke as they waited for Bucky to proceed.  After fondling the right breast, he let his hand wander slowly down, until he used one single finger to push inside.  Steve screamed in pain as his long finger bumped against the dry hymen.  He tried frantically to close his legs.
Tony did not know what to say.  He flopped down on the chair.  They were trapped, billions of miles away from home...at the mercy of a madman.
Steve could only shake his head in disbelief.
“I always will.”
“Peter.”  Tony said around a lump in his throat.  He wiped at the moisture in his eyes.
“Oh…oh…”  She arched her back.  Finna steadied her with her non occupied arm.
Bucky smirked.  “And what about you,
Please refer to tags as the story continues. Thanks!
After many hours, Stevie’s jaw ached from sucking over ten cocks and each man released down her throat.  Her stomach ached from all the cum inside her, she felt as though she might vomit.  But she did not dare to complain.  She liked it when the Mistress was nice and encouraging, it made her feel happy.  Now that she had seen the error of her ways, she was ashamed of her behavior around her Daddies.  Everything hurt so much because she was being difficult.  She belonged to them and they could do as they see fit.  If she is good, the pain will lessen.  If she is good, she will get rewarded sometimes.  If she gets the chance, she will show them how obedient she could be.
“Not gonna lie…”  Tony said as he gathered his stuff up and they all began to walk back into the mansion, “I’m a bit jealous you get to take her there.”
Thor looked to his servants.  One came up and secured Steve face down onto the breeding bench.  Her backside was exposed.  The crown prince looked to the musicians and motioned for them to restart playing the rousing tunes.  They all raised a toast as the group continued their revels.  The lead Vanahemian stepped up to the bench.  A servant helped him remove his overlying armor and then he opened his tunic as he stood behind Steve.  Another servant parted her cheeks to reveal her glistening back hole.  He settled his cock against it and shoved in, causing her to scream out in pain.  Although there was lube slicking the way, she was so tight.  The man groaned happily as he fucked in and out.  He stopped for a moment and turned the table.  “She is much too loud.”  He looked to his lieutenant, “Yellen, quiet her front hole.”  He commanded as the other man stepped up and when he freed himself, shoved his leaking, hard cock into her mouth.  Steve gagged violently as she was spitroasted.  No one paid heed to her distress as they enjoyed her from both ends.  They completed nearly at the same time, causing cum to ooze from her holes as they stepped back from her and returned to their seat.
Steve frowned slightly.   He hated that term.  “Well, you should see yourself.”
“I’m sorry!  I’m sorry!”  Steve exclaimed in fear as he grasped his left cheek where Bucky had hit him.  He hoped it didn’t bruise.  Bucky turned him hard towards Clint.  “Apologize to your Uncle, sweetheart.”
Bucky came into her field of vision, but initially said nothing.  She lay there as he lifted her legs to inspect the damage.  He was pleased to see the areas had tightened up appropriately overnight.  He picked her up and brought her to the bath.  She did not react as he placed her in the tub and bathed her.  He dried her off and carried her to the kitchen.  She immediately lowered herself to her knees and waited for instruction.  She saw Tony palm his cock, so she crawled under the table and took him in her mouth.  When he strongly stroked her hair, she understood she was to suck his cock.  She did expertly.  The three men exchanged pleased looks as they gazed upon the compliant former super soldier.
“Fuck!”  He shouted when he saw Steve slumped against the vanity, blood pouring from wounds on both wrists.  Her skin was sallow and pale…her eyes open but vacant.  Tony and Clint grabbed towels and each attempted to wrap the cuts and stem the hemorrhage.
Stevie’s face was soaked in Sif’s juices, but she did not dare to wipe off the release.  She would wait for permission.
“Please…”  She moaned in response, the pleasure feelings inside her contrasting with the horror show she was witnessing.  Her pussy was so wet at this point that she could hear the juices as Finna fondled her. “Oh…please…”
Bucky shrugged.  He wasn’t as much of a control freak as they thought when it came to Stevie.  “Why not?”  He replied.  “I have no problem making her call us all Daddy.  I’ll let her know tomorrow.”
“Yes, Agni.”  The guard nodded and started leading them into the palace, pulling Steve on a leash.  The opulence of the palace was noting Steve had ever seen.  Her face heated when she noticed so many people staring at her as they made their way to their destination.  She tried to ignore the murmurs of the people they passed. Steve knew they were talking about her.  She felt so alone as her steps faltered and the guard corrected her by tugging hard, almost causing her to stumble to the ground.  It seemed an eternity when they finally arrived at a large door.  The guard entered the huge space and handed the leash to another.  He bowed at the princes and made his leave.
“No, sweetheart, let your Daddy’s cum stay on.  It will remind you that you belong to us.”  He smiled as he looked down at her.  He reached down and attached his large hand to her thin arm and pulled her up.  He walked her over to the corner of the kitchen where Tony had placed the chair last night.
Steve shrugged.  “Unfortunately, that is the punishment given.”
“This one is particularly fetching, is she not?”  He paused.  “Come hither, child.”  Steve walked on shaky legs up the remaining steps towards the ruler.  “While I prefer the Aesir, she is an adequate specimen.”  Loki and Thor joined Steve in front of their father.  Loki closed the last remaining gap as he detached her leash.
Stevie was huddled naked into the corner of the cell that she woke up in this morning.  She had been washed and fed.  She trembled in fear waiting for Thor and Loki.  She knew she messed up when she angered the Lady.  She knew punishment was coming but did not know what to expect.
“Ahhh!”  She howled in pain.
“No game, child.”  Thanos said as he sat down.  “I need to rebuild my family.  You are my boys.”
“You are needed in New York.  There have been a few threats since you and the boys decided to take a god damn vacation without informing me.”
“Well, my friend.”  Finna swept into the chamber as graceful as ever.
“We’ll see.”  Natasha answered.  “Do you want to see them, honey?”
“No…Uncle Tony please…”
“Within reason of course, but yes.”  The Mad Titan answered.
were stitched neatly on the front.  Tony held up his own bedazzled with the arc reactor.
“STOP!!!”  Steve begged as he tried to grab onto Thanos arm.  He punched at the large appendage which was futile.  “STOP!! You’ll kill him!”  A sob escaped him.  “Please!!”
…does that make you the big strong Alpha?  You fucking asshole!”  She sobbed.  “And you…and your fucking suit of armor…couldn’t beat me until I changed.”  She swiped at her wet face harshly.  “And we both know your little bow and arrow could never defeat me before.”  She snarled at Clint.
Tears fell from the super soldier as he gazed upon the man he had not seen for two years.  “T-Tony…is it really you?”
As evening settled that day, Finna had a last task for Stevie.
“Just about done.”  Tony responded.
“You both are responsible for the deaths of my children.  While you should be killed, I cannot do that.  You two deserve to live.  You are important to me.  You possess strength and wit.  You… will be my new children.”
. DEAD DOVE: DO NOT EAT.
Astrid sat up and slid the chair back and turned to Finna.
“Anthony…”  Thanos turned to a stunned Tony.  “Anthony!”  Iron Man raised his tear filled eyes to him.  “Prepare your little brother to take me.”  He reluctantly grabbed the lube as he crawled over to Steve.  He covered his fingers in the wet substance and circled Steve’s tight hole.  He opened up gently, working his way up with his fingers.  He would touch his prostate to give Steve some pleasure.  He tried to ignore Thanos in the room and whisper words of encouragement to him, just like he did the night before.  But even with his fingers, there was no way Steve could accommodate the massive cock.  He leant down, opened his legs and circled the hole with his tongue.
“Et voila!”  He said with flourish.
Thor looked to Finna when she inquired if they were pleased with the slave and he answered, “Aye, Finna.  Thank you.  She looked perfect.  After her bath, provide her with the elixir to ensure she is alert for us to have our fun.”  He smiled at his friend.  “Have the servants place her in the East chamber.”
Tony went to pick her up and placed her on the bed.  He lubed his cock and positioned her on her hands and knees.  He gestured to Clint to take her mouth and they spit roasted her.  She made a noise when Tony entered her pussy, but they met with no resistance and they both fucked in and out, reveling in her warm pussy and mouth.  They released at nearly the same time.  The trio smiled at each other and then at the Asgardians.  Now they had the perfect sex toy.
Tony saw this and quietly said, “JARVIS, lockdown.”
Thanos removed his clothing as his large body loomed over Tony.  He went behind his human and opened his cheeks and began caressing his tongue around his hole.  Tony whimpered and moaned at the stimulation.  As he opened up the large tongue slipped inside and Tony could only cry out.  As it hit his prostate again and again, finally he shouted as he orgasmed and   flopped down onto the bed.  Thanos picked him and lowered him onto his cock.  He did not move as of yet, he just looked at him.
“N-No, Mistress.”
“It hurts…please…”
Scared that he would hurt him more, he reluctantly opened his mouth back up as Tony painted his lips with precum.  Steve could only take it as Clint hit his cervix hard again and again.  Time seemed to have no meaning as he endured their abuse.  Suddenly he felt wetness inside and his throat was filled with bitter, thick fluid.  As Tony pulled out, Steve choked and cum fell from his mouth.  Steve fell to the bed sobbing as they both stepped away.  “Please…stop…”  He pleaded, his voice rough from the treatment he just had.
“Oh, honey.”  Bucky moaned as he bottomed out inside Steve.  He picked him up and sat down with him again, his cock piercing inside Steve’s little body.
Tony’s new armor was magnificent.  It was similar to his old Iron Man suit but more sleek and lighter.  The metal he used was far stronger than vibranium.  When he flew in the sky, he was a vision of purple and gold.  To provide energy for the suit, Thanos allowed Tony to access a portion of the power stone.   During their next campaign against the Kree, Tony destroyed their flyers single handedly.  With their dominance from the air and Steve’s might on the ground, the Kree fled from the Battle that day.  And as time moved on, three dominated their enemies easily.
“Why focus on the time when you are home?  Wherever you are with me will be your home.”
by the way…and he needed a break.  Can you blame the guy?  How would feel if you just lost your dick?”
She heard a rustling noise and suddenly a massive cock was in her face.  “Be a good girl for us, Little One.”  She heard Thor say as she felt Loki’s large hand on the back of her head.  She tamped down a sob as her mouth was slowly forced onto Odin’s cock.  She could feel Loki and Thor surrounding her.  The king grasped her hair hard as he stood and then thrust in and out of the warm mouth. It seemed to last forever; she was relieved when he finally released in her mouth.  The King was unfazed as he tucked his spent cock back in and nodded as his sons.
“What does it do?”  Bucky asked.
Even with all his money and connections, there was no lawyer who could argue their way into a not guilty verdict.   The prosecutors played a highlight of their offenses against Steve Rogers and their fellow Avengers testified and verified the footage was real.  They were convicted unanimously.  Luckily, Steve did not have to be present during the trial.
“Yes, Daddy.”  He answered as he looked down in despair.
“I’ve waited a long time to have you Stevie.  And I decided it was time.”  He paused.  “I’m actually happy that the witch changed you.  You were always running head first into fights and gettin’ hurt.  You’ve proved yourself as Captain America, now it’s time to do something else.”  He ignored the hate in Stevie’s eyes.  “You can’t fight like this anymore.”
Steve stood there trying to make herself as small as possible.
Thanos took a seat by him.  He watched the glow of the lights reflect on his beautiful boy’s face.  “I am so proud of you, Anthony.”
In the morning, the men were eating breakfast, while Stevie was warming Clint’s cock.  Has petting her hair as he finished his bagel.
Until they got their bearings, Tony thought, he needed to see how this played out.  He was glad Steve was here, but he was worried about him.  Tony had to guide him, with his hand at the small of his back.  Steve appeared in shock, detached from what was going on.  He was concerned that the events truly caused Steve to finally break.  Tony began thinking about Peter, he felt as though his heart shattered a million times over when he thought of Spiderman’s last words to him.  He had failed Peter.  The Avengers had failed Earth and the Universe.  He was going to survive this and make things right.
It was a button up shirt and a flowing skirt that fell to his knees.  Without saying anything, Steve knew to place the items on; his face flushed in embarrassment and shame for having to place women’s clothes on.  With a quivering voice, he asked, “D-Daddy?  What about underwear?”  Steve’s heart pounded in fear for even opening his mouth.  He hated himself for calling Bucky Daddy…it made him want to throw up; but he did not want punishment.
“Use your mouth now on his hole, Little One.  Make him ready for his Father.”
“Yes, Mistress.”
Stephen waited a bit as his face fell slightly.  “No.  Your memories will be intact.”
“It’s amazing, Stevie…I was actually worried that we went too far with the bot.”  Bucky began in a menacing tone.  He scooted next to her and stroked her hair.  He grabbed onto a section of her blond strands and pulled hard, causing Stevie to yelp in pain as her neck strained towards him.  She knew Bucky was angry…but she didn’t give a damn.  He was going to hurt her regardless of her actions.  “I can make it so much worse for you.  I have seventy years of Hydra ingrained in me.”  He threatened and Steve tried not to react, but she swallowed heavily.  She was trying to remain brave.
Stevie finished urinating and washed her hands.  She stared at her reflection.  How long had it been since she was cursed?  It felt like a lifetime…even longer than the time in the ice.  How pathetic she was as she traced her face, her breasts and down to her hairless privates.  As if outside of herself, she began opening drawers.  She saw a razor and slowly lifted it up.  She popped off the cover.  Her hand shook as she gazed at herself one more time.  She lifted her wrist towards the razor.
“Good.  Thank you as always, Finna.”
“I had to call in the Fantastic Four to neutralize one of the threats.”
Bucky spread his legs.  “And what is this, honey?”
“Yes?”
Tony had no idea how much time had passed on the alien planet.  He tried to keep track of the days but hours seemed to vary and the days never seemed to be the same.  He stopped trying to quantify the time they had been there.  The few occasions he had asked Thanos, he did not receive an answer.
“Good boy.”  Thanos beamed in satisfaction.  “I am so proud of you, baby boy.”  He stood with Steve in his arms and carried him over to the bed.  Steve removed his clothes and Thanos followed suit.  The large alien sat on the bed and Steve fell to his knees.  He started stroking Thanos’ cock as it retracted.
“What’d Stevie do?”
Loki continued.  “Perhaps, you can provide some instruction and she will require punishment as well.  We have borne witness to her discipline on Midgard and perhaps their ways are lax.  I believe she needs to see a form of Asgardian punishment and perhaps that will be a true deterrent to her bad behavior.”
“Did you disobey, Tony, Stevie?”  When she didn’t answer, he pinched her nipples hard.  “Answer, now.”
“You are fucking wicked, Stark.”  Bucky said as he laughed.
“Watch.”  He answered as Tony directed the suit over to Steve.  It stood over the shaking former super soldier, its glowing eye slits staring down menacingly at her.  She tried to scream and fight the restraints but to no avail.
One morning, Stevie was brought to the special showers.  She was washed by the servants, her hair dried and styled and light makeup placed.  The servants brought her to Finna when they were finished.  The woman smiled warmly as she beckoned Steve to her.
“We can use the back channel, Thor.”  Loki answered.  He did not want to risk Fury attempting to remove Steve from their sights.
“Yes, your Highness.”  A voice responded.
“In time, my sons.  In time.”
“Ya think?!  It’s been over three months since in happened.  I doubt it can be reversed.”
“And the piece de resistance…”  Tony announced as one last small tube surfaced.  It traveled in between her legs to its destination.
Thor lifted Stevie from the bench and carried her over to where Sif lay with her legs open, her cunt glistening and ready.
“Don’t deny it, Iron Man.”  Clint chimed in as he laughed at Loki’s statement.
Tears poured down his face.  “My pussy.”
Steve had no response to him.  He was not sure the point of this all.
Her big blue eyes looked up at her former friend.  “D-Did I do good, Daddy?”
“You will be punished for your sins against your Masters.”  She let go causing Steve to lose her balance.  “Back to your knees, slave. You do not want to disobey me.”  She paused.  “Do you?”  She asked and when Steve did not answer immediately, she slapped her across the face.  “You heed me when I speak to you, child.”
Bucky grinned as he nodded.  “I’ll have another turn soon.  Who’s next?”
“I’m beat.”  Clint announced as he stood up on shaky legs.  “I’ll see you in the morning.  He left and returned to his suite.  Bucky picked her up.
“I do not think a reversal is imminent, James.”  Loki said.  “I explained before that my research has been fruitless.”
“As always, Finna, you do not disappoint.”  They smiled as they made their way from the banquet hall.
The men smiled as Bucky got up to walk to Stevie in the bedroom.  He released her bindings, scooped her up and handed her to Tony who would have the chance to sleep next to her that night.  He deserved it after all his creative inventions.
Bucky looked up with a smirk from where he sat.  “What did she do?”
“I will.  Come back inside.”  Thanos returned to the house and the unspoken expectation was to follow him.  Steve and Tony complied for now.
“Thanks, Buck.”
Two figures emerged from the ship.  There was a collective gasp when they realized it was Steve and Tony.    They appeared healthy and resplendent in their gold and purple armor.  Their faces were young and each had long flowing, silken hair.
“Anything, Daddy?”  Steve asked.
“Hi guys.”  Steve said.  No one answered initially; they simply stared at the vision in front of them.  His long blond hair fell below the shoulders.  Despite the fact that the sweatshirt was a bit big, they could see the outline of the B Cup breasts.  While encased in leggings, Steve long legs appeared so appealing in his ensemble.  His heart sped up slightly, but he ignored it.  “What’s going on?”
DEAD DOVE: DO NOT EAT
“Hush, Little One.”  Thor calmly responded as he slipped in a second finger.  Steve jumped from the pressure but Thor’s large hand held him in place.  He removed his robe and it fluttered to the floor.  He stepped up grasping his enormous cock and started to slowly push into the pucker.
“Let’s go downstairs.”  Tony said as they followed him down the staircase.  When they arrived, Tony motioned to Bucky to set her up on the table.  It was like an exam table at a doctor’s office, only thinner.  There were attachments for her arms.  Clint and Bucky worked to secure each.  Tony pushed a button and a harness lowered from the ceiling.  He proceeded to secure her legs.  She was spread eagle.  He detached the bottom half of the table.  He put a gag in her mouth to keep her from whining.  He also placed headphones to block out noise.
“Great, Jarvis.  Have the boys all come up for a feast.  Tell them to wear their robes I have provided.”
“In any manner they choose.”
“Fuck…”  Tony moaned out as he palmed his rising cock.  “I have to ask…and we are all thinking it…will you allow us to partake?”
“Don’t go…”  He choked out, panicking that Tony was leaving.
She slowly climbed off the bed and stood in front of the god of mischief, who was stroking his monster cock.  “Sit on your uncle, Pet.”  Steve refused to let herself cry as she lowered herself onto his cock.  As always, she was so tight that it burned terribly as she went down.  She straddled him but refused to look at him.  Loki reveled in the tightness and closed his eyes briefly.  “Your cunt is still so snug for your uncle.”  He smirked as he rested his hands on her slim hips.
Bruce stepped up; he was the only one not holding a gun.  He had a tablet.  “It’s interesting what you can learn if you access JARVIS’ database.”  He said in an eerie, calm voice but his eyes flashed green.  “Fury contacted me…he thought it was odd the way you acted every time he asked about Steve.”
Steve cried out at the sensation, “W-What are you….Tony…oh…”  He arched in pleasure as Tony ate out his hole.  He yelped as a tongue slipped inside, his own cock was standing at attention.
The billionaire nodded.  “Absolutely.  I know lots of people who would pay premium for a piece like you.”
“She has a lovely mouth, my boys.”
He shook his head as more tears escaped, he refused.  Bucky’s metal hand grasped his chin and forced him to look up.
“Steve, trust me.  We’ve got to fight him. We can’t let him win.”  He grabbed his hands.  “Come on, Captain.”
“I would love to bear witness to that.”  Thor smiled.  “But alas, we are to travel to meet with the Jotuns today.  It is not an appointment we can miss.”
“So, I was thinking…”  He began.

“Did you, little one?”  Loki grinned as he bucked up causing Steve to cry out and a tear escape.  “Tsk…tsk…tsk…”  He wiped her face.  “Your pussy will always be enjoyable for us.”  He bucked up again and grabbed onto her tits.  “You are fortunate we have taken you as ours.”  She shook her head and tried to push him away and lift herself off him.  It was futile of course.  He let his finger drift down and he shoved it inside her pussy alongside his cock.
I will be using a few MCU characters in different roles during the fic.
“What do you need, Stevie?”
“It is okay, precious.  I am here.  I will always be here. It will always be you and your brother and me.  Never fear.  I will take care of you.  My beautiful Steven.”
“Fuck…”  Bucky groaned out as his cock continued little spurts inside the tight pussy.  “Amazing.”

“I’m a sweet little girl, Daddy.”
“What is it?”
“We advised her to pleasure the Lady and she failed miserably, which in turn gave our friend great distress.”  Thor informed her.
“What, Little One?”
Finna’s face darkened as she proceeded to crack the whip against her left breast.  “AHHHH!”  Stevie screamed in pain, as a red mark bloomed on her chest.  Tears streamed from her face.  She was hit in succession on the other breast and then her vaginal area.  Steve arched her back as she howled in pain, unable to find relief.  Sweat poured from her body as she attempted to calm herself down.  She could hear Finna’s footsteps but not see her.
“Bucky…”  He tried to keep his eyes from watering.  “Can I have some clothes?  Please?”  He wrapped his thin arms around himself.
“This is your naughty chair, honey.  For all the bad things you did yesterday, you’ll spend a time out on this.”  She looked down at the long and wide dildos attached.
“You can’t be Captain America anymore, so you need to be useful, right?”  He smiled.  “You’ll be our good girl.”  He started tracing a finger around the left nipple causing Steve to gasp and try to pull away.
They left her with the fucking machine for two hours.  When they detached her from the bot, she lay there barely responding.  For a second, Bucky panicked and felt for a pulse.  Happy to palpate one, he picked up the limp form of Stevie and they walked upstairs with her.
Steve’s lips trembled.  “Y-Yes…”  He whispered as he started to sob quietly.
“Shoulda used the bot earlier.”  Clint remarked with a wink as she moved over to him and started sucking his dick.
“Good girl.”  Tony moaned as he grasped Steve’s hair and thrust in and out chasing his pleasure.  Finally, he released inside his mouth.  “Fuck…I swear that’ll never get old.”
Thanos stepped up to him.  “You need guidance.  You need me to show you new worlds that you could never imagine.  You require someone who will care for you.”
Tony kissed his head and placed his hand on Steve’s face.  “And when it’s my turn…”  A sense of dread filled him as he spoke.
Bucky laughed.  “Stevie, honey, I am a walk in the fucking park compared to
Thor and Loki returned to Asgard with the promise to come back in a week.
“AHHHH!”  He screamed.  “Please, Daddy!  I’m sorry!”
“It’s okay, sweetheart.  It’s only me.”  He leaned down and placed a chaste kiss on Steve’s lips.  The super soldier slowly closed his eyes at the soft touch to his mouth.
“Good, baby.  Because you are Daddy’s little girl.”  Bucky grabbed the back of Steve’s legs and curled him up exposing his pink rosette.  “And this is your special spot…your special hole for your Daddy and your uncles.  The tightest most delicious hole for your Daddy’s cock.  Your beautiful ass.  Daddy loves your ass, honey.”  He stood Steve up for a moment and coated his cock with lube.  He motioned for Steve to lean his hands on the counter.  He rested his dick against the rosette and pushed forward.  He groaned in bliss as the snugness encompassed him.
“Didn’t do any good, though, did it?”  He paused.  “You still murdered trillions because you’re fucking crazy.”  He finally gazed up at his nightmare.
“Looking forward to it.”  Loki replied with a smile.
“Nothing… I mean…”  He stumbled on his words.  Thanos took his book and walked towards a large plush chair near the bed and sat down.  He flipped through the sketches.
“I’m sorry!  I…I…”  She became distressed.
“Yes, Daddy.”  Stevie said as she shimmied down the bed and latched on to the semi hard cock to keep in her mouth all night.
Steve felt alive as he spared with some of the soldiers.  He had missed the physical activity.  They had been on New Titan for a few weeks.  Thanos had introduced him as their commander and at first the troops had been skeptical of the Terran creature, as they called him behind his back.  But once they saw his strength and skills, they accepted him as their leader.
“Your lesson, slave.  Learn to ‘eat pussy’ as you Midgardians say.  You will be timed and will earn punishment if you do not comply.”  She left Steve with the guard and left the room.
Thor and Loki were dressed in their finery.  A guard entered the room and grabbed the leash and stood behind the princes.  They began their walk to the Great Hall.
“Is this a test?”  His voice trembled slightly.
“Do you need some water, honey?”
“Where did he go?”  Steve looks around.  “Thor…where did he go?”  Steve looked around frantically, the sounds of battle now turned to an eerie quiet in the forest.
Bucky lifted Steve up and placed him hard on his knees.  “Be good for Tony now.”  He nodded for Iron man to wander over with his cock.  Bucky stood behind him as Tony slipped his cock in the warmth just like last night.  He couldn’t wait to use Steve’s pussy.  But his mouth was amazing.
Finna smiled down at Steve as she stroked her hair, a proud look on her face.  Warm feelings encompassed Steve.  Finna attached the leash and as she nodded at Sif and departed the chamber.  She said nothing until they returned to the stable.  It was a room Steve had not seen previously.  On the table were meats and fruits and some mead.  A large cot that contained pelts and blankets awaited.
“Of course, Captain.”  He nodded.  “Give me a bit to gather the necessary ingredients and we will get started.”  He smiled awkwardly and proceeded to leave the room.
“Jesus, Reindeer Games!”  Tony exclaimed.  “You are such a shit disturber!”  He gave him the finger before turning back to Barnes.  He wasn’t afraid of the Winter Soldier. “Fine, Steve is gorgeous!  Man or woman.”  He shook his head.  “How you never fucked him in all the years you have known him, I have no idea.”
“The spell was created for mischief, not true malice.  I can perform the reversal if you would like.”
“Get the fuck away from us, Grimace.”  Tony spat out, hoping he’d leave them alone for a time.  Steve was in no shape to do anything else at this point.
Tony wanted to ignore the stirring in his cock, but it was hard.  He needed to focus.  “We need…I need…”  He closed his eyes.
Right before Thor lit her up with his lightening, she unleashed a spell on Steve that changed him into a female.  Tony and Clint cackled at the sight of the former Super Soldier now swimming in his uniform.  While Thor meant to subdue the witch, she ended up turning to ashes, leaving Steve stunned as he watched her now disintegrated body float like dust onto the ground.  They all realized the seriousness of her death as the days turned into weeks and there was no reversal of the spell.
She nodded.  He loosened his grip around her waist, and she slipped onto the floor and immediately placed his dick in her mouth.  “Jesus…”  He gazed and Tony and Clint.  “Amazing…” He groaned as she expertly sucked him.  It didn’t take too long for him to cum down her throat.
Steve lifted up his wrists.  “What are these?”
“Don’t mind if I do, boys.”  Clint had a bottle of lube and stood; he picked a limp Stevie off Bucky’s cock and walked him over to a bed that was set up.  He lay Steve down on his belly.  “On your knees, Stevie.”  When he did not respond quick enough, Clint smacked his ass hard.  Steve scrambled to comply even though he hurt.  He could feel cum oozing down his legs.  Clint’s fingers entered his pussy and scooped up some of Bucky’s release.  He used a finger to insert in his ass, the cum slicking the way.
“Take it out!!!  Please… take it out!!!”
“Remember your manners, child.”  She added as she swept out of the room leaving Steve alone.  The guard locked the door behind him.
Tony chuckled as he stood.  He helped Steve sit up against the headboard.  “Yeah, that’s not going to work for me.  I already had a father.  He was a dick but I guess now he looks like a saint compared to you.  Thanks but no thanks.  I don’t need a new one.”
As he settled against Bucky, a tear fell from his eye.  His control was the last thing they could take from him.  He was now utterly lost, and he knew it.
Thor stood and walked over to Steve and stood behind her.  “This is our slave from Midgard.”  He said in a pleased voice.  The contingent from Vanaheim was awed.  Thor reached over to her front and grasped the collar of the see-through robe and loosened the ribbon and slipped it slowly down her shoulders to reveal her naked, glowing body.  The leader from Vanaheim nodded his head and smiled as he clapped.  He looked to the All-father.  “I never knew Midgardians could be so beautiful.  They are such primitive creatures.”
“How’d you do it?”  He asked.
Steve absently nodded, not fully hearing what Natasha had to say.  Before she stood up, she looked at the Widow.  “Tasha, where are my Daddies?”
“Her mouth and cunt.  Amazing pussy.”
Silence befell the room as the guard led a trembling Stevie into the hall by her leash.  When they reached the platform, the guard unhooked her.  She stood there, head down, trying to ignore the stares of the people in the room.  A tear slipped down her face, but she tried to ignore it.
“Sorry guys.”  Tony replied.
“I have been without a partner since Jane and I ended our dalliance.”
THREE MONTHS LATER
They nodded.  “Very well.”  Thor replied.
“And what have we here, my sons?”  He smiled as he placed his staff in the holder next to his throne.  “Come closer, let me see your little treasure.”  Loki stepped up on the altar as he presented Steve to his father.  “Beautiful creature.”  He turned to Thor.  “You always liked the Midgardians, my son.”
, and do as we say.  Maybe it won’t always be too bad for you.”  He could tell Bucky was a sadist by the way he fucked Steve so hard and gave him no pleasure.  Clint would be a little nicer later but right now he was so hard he could cut glass with his erection.  He released Steve’s head and it snapped back.  For a moment, the former super soldier felt fuzzy in his brain.  Before he had a chance to react, Tony shoved his 8 inch leaking cock inside his mouth, muffling Steve’s scream.  Clint entered his pussy at the same time.  He was trapped between the two men, moving forward as Clint punched inside and then choking on Tony’s rod as it hit the back of his throat.  He thought he would easily suffocate to death as he struggled for air.  Steve tried to withdraw his mouth and his teeth grazed Tony causing him to cry out.  He withdrew his cock and grabbed Steve’s chin and slapped him across the face.  “Watch the fucking teeth, Stevie.”  He looked up into his former friend’s eyes and all he could see was lust and hate.  What had Steve done to deserve this treatment?  He thought they were all friends…a family…how could he have been so wrong?
The rest of the team had been his family, if a very odd, dysfunctional and brought together out of the need to save people, but it was still a family; Tony welcomed them into his home, hell, he made each one of them a floor specifically designed to their liking, he had founded them, given them constant updates and equipment out of his own money without receiving anything back, barely a mumbled ‘thanks’. None of them bothered to get to know him out of their own volition and many were content to stay with the first impression they had on him, on the Tony described by tabloids and reports that made him no justice and portrayed a reckless, eccentric, selfish, narcissistic asshole that only fought for himself when they couldn’t be farther from the truth. It was true he could be eccentric but that was the façade he put to protect himself. And how could people thing he was selfish when he gave so much? Whether it was money, support, equipment, he donated to thousands of charities, he gave away scholarships as if they were cookies and they told nothing about how selfless he was? And how could he be narcissistic when he hadn’t let anyone touch him ever since the incident in Afghanistan happened? He who was so distressed and repulsed by his own scars that he hadn’t let anyone, not even Pepper, touch him or see him without a shirt on, except Rhodey. Natasha had played double agent on him so many times, Clint had called him backstabber, Bruce had vanished out of sight but Tony was well aware whose side he would pick if he were there.
“Honey bear, this is not exactly the time”.
"Hey... Hey, Steve." The voice sounded closer.
“Your husband is inside, with the little one” she informed and the tone in her voice didn’t alert T’Challa of any harm that could’ve come to either his child or husband so he thanked her and walked in with light steps.
To Tony, Steve was the biggest example of a double standard he had ever seen for the soldier claimed he desired to protect people but he didn’t want to make himself accountable for his mistakes, he claimed he was fighting for the freedom of people when he ignored the several countries -129 now- that demanded for the Avengers to be regulated, to make themselves responsible for the damages they’ve caused. Tony understood perfectly the fear other countries had, that a group of American super-powered, enhanced dudes going around the world ignoring borders and people’s rights and leaving destruction and death behind. Tony was tired of being hated and feared, those were one of the reasons why he signed the accords, and it was an attempt to correct his past mistakes. If things had stopped right there it wouldn’t have been too bad, sure they had their disagreements but Tony know they would work around them and come to a middle point; the accords weren’t fixed yet, they could be modified if only Steve and his ‘side’ agreed to come to terms and review the actual version to propose ways to improve it, if things had gone that way, but then Barnes had to appear.

“Are you happy with me, Daddy?”  She asked needing reassurance she performed well.
“Our friends.”
Iron Man returned holding an object that looked like a booster seat.  When he placed it down, he showed them his creation.  “We can use it as a punishment chair.” It had a one dildo affixed in the middle and one farther back that appeared adjustable.  Tony smiled.  “It is remote controlled and has some attachments.”
“Jeez guys.  You’d think that you could muster a little more excitement for traveling in a private jet and staying at an ocean side mansion.  Tough crowd.”  He said as he stood.  “We’ll meet in 2 hours in the garage.
Bucky nodded.  “Sounds good to me.”  He stood and adjusted his pants.  “Let’s go to the penthouse, Tony.  It’s a good place to start.”
“O-O-One.”  Steve choked out and cried out again with the next blow.  “T-Two…”
Steve’s cheek trembled; she could barely contain her rage.  What did it matter what happened now?  They owned her whether she was compliant or defiant.  She was just a thing to be used.  There was no compassion…nothing left of the team Steve thought existed.  Perhaps it was Steve’s naïve nature that led her believe the best in people.  Steve was so wrong.  People were horrible and by nature selfish.  Looking at her former teammates with lust in their eyes despite what happened the previous day…it did not matter what had transpired.  She would be their fuck-toy until they bored of her or killed her: whatever came first.
“Inventive and a genius!”  Tony answered as he picked up the remote to his chair.  He pressed the start button for each component and Steve tried to scream but it was muffled by the fake cock in her mouth.  They could hear and see the vibration of each dildo and the clit stimulator rotating against her.  It only took a few minutes and she shuddered with an orgasm.  She tried not to scream again but to no avail as the stimulation to her clit did not let up.  It was painful as she came again quickly.
“Make the Lady cum, Stevie.”  He commanded.
The soldiers returned from annihilating a Kree stronghold.  It was the first of many victories to ensure they remove the Kree threat from their lands.  With the win, they also acquired new territory for Thanos.  It was rich in resources.  Steve would ensure those in need in the outer parts would receive some help and could be safe from threats
What will happen to our poor Stevie at the feast?
“No!”  Steve answered helplessly as he gasped at the first feel of Clint’s tongue on his clit.
“Thank you, your highness.  You are very generous.”
“Steve…Steve…it’s okay.  It’s okay.”  Tony was immediately by his side, trying to calm down the agitated super soldier.
The guard announced his arrival at Thor’s room.  The Asgardian brothers eagerly awaited her.  They were not disappointed.  She appeared like an angel, glittering with the piercings.  Her pale skin shining.
***************************************************
“I call this planet New Titan.”  He answered and then sat down on a beautiful large chaise.  “After my home planet was destroyed, I looked for a thousand years for a new place to rebuild.  This is a very diverse planet, filled with many species.  There are some problems; some I hope improved since balance was restored to the universe.”  He sighed contentedly.  “We will address those issues soon.”
Bucky added, “Mr. Jack can clean you but that’s it.  He is not allowed to do anything else.  Only Daddy and your Uncles can use your holes.  Okay?”  Stevie nodded as a strange feeling of relief encompassed her.  “Let me hear you, honey.”
“Of course, Jackie.  I’ll see you in two days.”
Lady Sif moaned as her hands grabbed onto Stevie’s long locks.  She started pushing her pussy into the eager mouth.  Sif arched and groaned in pleasure.  Her juices started flowing as Stevie tried her best.  She slipped a finger in like she was taught and hit the right spot, because suddenly Lady Sif screamed out as her release hit her hard.  She was convulsing in pleasure as she pulled on Steve’s hair so tight that it felt as if it would rip out.  She collapsed back against the chaise as she breathed heavily with exertion.
Tony looked at her.  “Took us a while to get here.”
She looked to Bucky for approval.  He nodded as he caressed her cheek.  “Thank you, Daddy.”  She stood up and limped into the house.  She had taken all three men in her pussy multiple times that day and she was sore.
Steve tried to keep from tearing up at his words.  He had the same fears.  “What am I going to do, Bucky?  I won’t be able to be Captain America anymore.”
“Curious aren’t you?”
“Nothing, man.”  Clint said as he gave Tony a look before taking another drink of his beer.
Bucky, Clint and Tony all looked at each other at once.  “Shit!”  Tony exclaimed realizing she had been gone for longer than it was needed to urinate.  He took off for his bathroom and the others followed.
“Can’t wait.”  Tony said as he placed a copious amount of lube on his aching cock.  He knew he should probably prepare him first with a few fingers, but he wanted it as snug as possible.  He rested his dick at the pucker for a moment, enjoying feeling Steve tense.  As Clint shoved his cock in his mouth, he thrust forward hard causing Steve to cry out.  Clint hit the back of his throat.  Steve practically convulsed at the shock of being spit roasted so suddenly.  He thought this would be the moment he would die as he struggled for air.  Clint back out briefly and then continued his assault.  Both men were vigorous in their fucking.  Time seemed to lose all meaning as Steve could only focus on breathing and the pain radiating through his entire body.  It was as if he could feel Tony all the way up to his diaphragm.
“I cannot wait to partake, but for now, I need your body, Loki.”
Stevie nodded.
He sat back.  What no one knew was that all those years ago, he chose not to lift Mjolnir.  He spared the ego of his former friend.  He gazed up at the heavens.  When the time comes…he was going to
A few hours later, he returned and made himself some lunch.  He placed some on a plate and placed it in front of Stevie, along with a cup of water.  She ate silently, always grateful for food.  Afterwards, she stretched out on the floor and drifted to sleep.  Not once did she try to remove the leash from the hook.  She did not want to risk the consequences.
“I don’t want to lose what we have, man.”  Clint said.  “It’s too good.”
“Boys…”  Bucky interrupted.  “There’s more than one hole, idiots.”
“My compliments to your training, my friend.  She brought me to great pleasure very quickly.  Well done.”  Sif smiled as she tightened the strap on her robe.
“Why?”  Tony asked.
Tony shook his head.  “Just make it quick please.  Hopefully I have earned that.”
“I think we broke her.”  Clint said in almost an amused tone.
“I know, but you do spend an awful lot of time in here.  He needs to know he is important too.”  He looked up at Thanos as he stood.
“Yes, Steve, I understand.  My mistake.”
“Can I suck your cock, Daddy?”
“Sleeping.”  He paused.  “I wanted to talk to you.”
“Take us back.”  Steve said, finding some defiance still in his body, even though inside he was overcome by fear that he had never felt before.
“What are you hiding, my child?”
Loki grinned maliciously as he walked over to them, whilst stroking his own leaking cock.  Thor held up Steve’s legs, contorting him into a position that could not be comfortable.  But they paid no heed to any distress from their former teammate.  They were all consumed with lust.  Loki bent down slightly as he tried to guide his cock into Steve’s front but found the area dry and felt some chafing.  He grabbed the lube and placed a generous amount on his dick and slid inside.  He marveled in the still tight pussy and he moaned.  The small body was trapped between the two large figures.  Thor thrust up in synchrony with Loki’s movements into Steve’s pussy.
Bucky grabbed Steve’s face hard.  “And if I hear one more ‘stop’ from you, you will regret it.  For the last time, your holes belong to us.  It’s our right to stuff them when and how we see fit.  They aren’t yours anymore.  Do you understand?”
Tony stepped up and placed lube on the smaller flexible cock behind her.  He pushed it inside her ass, they could see both her holes stretched wide on the dildos.  He opened a small space and brought out a clit stimulator and placed it against her nub.  He handcuffed her wrists and pressed a button on the wall.  A harness lowered down from the ceiling and brought her arms up above her head at a ninety-degree angle and attached her restrained wrists to it.  He placed a fake cock inside her mouth and attached the strap around her head to keep it in place.
“It is a normal reaction, Little One, to traversing the Bifrost.  It takes some time to acclimate to it.”  Thor said as he looked to Heimdall.  He nodded his greetings to his old friend.
As he entered the prison, it was slow going as he was shackled at the waist and legs.  He was strip searched and given standard prison gear.  He received a buzz cut and shaved.  The warden met him in processing and informed him he would now be housed here.  He was denied protective custody and was placed in General population.  Clint attempted to argue but to no avail. He asked to discuss his move with his lawyer and all the Warden told him was that the move was approved.  As he followed the two guards to his destination, they entered the noisy cell block that must have had hundreds of cells; cat calls were hurled at him.  The sounds were deafening and a sign of true chaos.  He kept his head high and ignored them.  The guard stopped and he unlocked the cell.
“Yes.”  He stepped forward.  “You will find the metals and resources you will use are far superior to those found on earth.”  He placed his hand on Tony’s face.  He knew his Little Genius was suffering without an outlet for his intelligence.  It was time to allow him to play.  “Now…if you do anything that displeases me, Anthony, your brother will pay the price.”
“Sounds like fun, Stark.”  Bucky said as he made his way over to Steve.  He picked him up, causing the younger one to groan.  “I’ll get her cleaned up and ready to go.”  He smiled widely as he carried Steve to the elevator.
“Did you enjoy your year-end bonus?”
After a few hours, Steve had been used by the ruler of Vanaheim and his delegation many times and in all her orifices.  She was dragged away to be bathed.
Steve could not move, his body trapped in Bucky’s arms and his cock inside him.  He stared out the window, the image of the beautiful blue sky obscured through his tears.
“What the fuck?”  Iron Man answered.
“I-I’m s-sorry for my words, Daddies…”  Fat tears of humiliation fell down her face.
“What’s going on with everybody?!”  Peter said as he looked around.  “They’re back!  That’s what we all wanted!”
Stevie’s heart sank.
“I’m sorry, Daddy!”  Steve begged.
“Good.  Now it is time for your next lesson.”  Finna attached her leash again and called for an attendant.  They traveled to another part of the stable.  Stevie was secured again to a table.  Her legs were placed in stirrups leaving her legs splayed open and her core front and center.
“I think when the nobles see this pretty one, there may be some increased demand for slaves from Midgard.”  Odin added.
Clint sat on a large chair and Bucky lowered her ass onto his waiting cock.  She cried out at the stretch but otherwise was very docile.  Clint leaned in and spoke in her ear.  “I missed your ass, sugar.  I dreamt about it.”  He said as he fondled her nipple rings from behind, causing her to moan slightly.  “Do you like that, honey?  Such a little slut you’ve become.”  He gestured to Tony.  “Only whores have their clits pierced.  Did you beg for that?”
Tony gazed at Clint and Bucky who were stone faced.  “What are you talking about?”  He replied in a haughty dismissive tone as he casually looked back at Black Widow.
“I’m just rerouting something to make this more effective.”
“It can’t fit.”  Tony said with emotion in his voice.  “You’ll kill him….you’d kill me.”
“I shall like to try her ass!”  Volstaag exclaimed as the men all smiled.  He walked up to the bench and unstrapped Steve. He brought her over to the oversized bed and threw her, none too gently, on the soft surface onto her back.  His large hands grabbed her legs and opened them as he practically bent her in half.  He lined up his cock as he ignored her sobbing.  He shoved his large dick inside in one move.  The shock and pain were so great, Steve passed out.  Volstaag did not care, he simply enjoyed the tight space and took his pleasure.
“Alright.  Sending them now.  See you in a minute.”  He hung up the phone and sent their location.  It only felt like seconds later when the two Asgardians materialized in Malibu.  They were looking well and healthy and dressed in Midgardian garb.
She pleaded as he hauled her up and unhooked her leash.  “You fucking slut!”  He slapped Stevie.  “Only Daddy and your Uncles are allowed to have your holes.”
“Now, apologize for being naughty to your Uncle.”
“What are you talking about?!”
“But we can let Doom unleash all his fucking bots all over the world, trying to destabilize some regions?  That’s such bullshit!”
“Please…Mr. Jack…Daddy s-said…”
“I’m a whore.”
“Y-Yes, Daddy…I understand.”  Steve added, fearful that he would be electrocuted if he did not comply.  He forced his shaky legs to return to Thor’s side.
Loki stood up with her still stuck to his cock and he laid down on the bed after Bucky vacated the space.  She was in the riding position now.  “Brother.”  He summoned Thor who smiled as he grabbed the lube and placed some on his cock.  The god of Thunder pushed Steve down until her chest was flush against Loki’s and she cried out as he pierced her back hole.  The brothers moaned as they shared the former super soldier.  At one point, Loki, perspiring from the absolute pleasure turned his head slightly to Clint.  The archer understood what he was asking so he went to the top of the bed and stood just beyond Loki and pulled her head up hard and pushed his leaking cock inside her mouth.
The Warden responded, “In your life, Stark, you may have made all the rules.  But here, you follow the prison’s rules.  You are no better than anyone else here.  So, prisoner 161019, if you do not comply with the mandatory search, we are authorized to employ any means necessary.  Do you understand?”
The Winter Soldier chose that exact moment to join the men in the common room.  “Ask me what?”  He said as he marched over to the mead and poured himself a healthy dose so he could actually get drunk.
After consuming their hamburgers, the three men walked outside to take in the magnificent view.  They left Stevie sitting on the kitchen floor eating his food.
Bucky’s face tensed as he brought his metal hand against Steve’s small neck.  He squeezed slightly and all Steve could do was to paw at the metal appendage as he choked his breath from him.  As fast as it happened, Bucky let go and watched as Steve gasped for breath.
“Like I said re-education.”  Loki responded.
“General Population.”
“Three holes are better than two.”  He said with a smirk to the group.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Daddy, please…I’m sorry.”
“Please, Bucky…it hurts…please…”
“Bucky?”  His small high voice trembled slightly at the look in his friend’s eyes.  He scooted back a few spots, but Bucky’s metal arm wrapped around his waist and pulled him back closer.
“Shh…Stevie…look at me.”  He smiled at him.  “Good…now it might hurt for a second but I promise you I’ll make you feel so good, baby…okay?”
“I understand Daddy.”
They both thrust in and out in tandem and finished inside of her.
“Agreed.”  Tony and Clint answered.
“Hands up, MOTHERFUCKERS!”  Nick exclaimed.
“Whatever…”  Tony said as he brushed his hand through his unruly hair.  “We are joining forces with the Fantastic Four tomorrow.  Hopefully, we can end this.”
After they quickly ate, they slipped their shoes on and exited the home.  They began walking down the steps when Thanos stepped towards them.
“Best idea ever, man.”  Clint leaned his head back against the couch, content after his orgasm.  “This will be good for the team.  I haven’t had this much sex in a long time.  Didn’t realize how much I needed the release.”  Tony hummed in agreement.
“We’ve been monitoring you…waiting for Steve’s return.  We were able to see what you have done to Steve this whole time. It takes some time to break through the firewalls, but we discovered Steve was back late last night.”  He paused as Tony started getting red in the face.  “Luckily, I remember the codes you gave to override the system undetected.  And that’s what I did.”  He stopped because he had to control his growl.  He did not want to turn into the Hulk.
“Well, well, well.  If it isn’t the Asset.”  Brock Rumlow smirked as he looked upon the former super soldier.  “It’s our lucky day, boys.”  He said to the other Hydra agents that were imprisoned along with him after SHIELD fell.
The super soldier gasped as Tony’s warm, calloused hand found his way to his cock.  As it stirred, Steve moaned.
“Yes, Mr. Stark.”
They two gods smiled as they stood.  They kissed each other passionately.  Loki placed Steve on his back and secured his wrists again with magic. He climbed on the bed and placed his cock at Steve’s entrance.  He waited as Thor positioned himself behind his brother.  He grabbed the lube and put a generous amount on his fingers as he inserted one and then two inside Loki.  The younger brother moaned in ecstasy as Thor hit his magic spot inside of him.  “Brother please…I need you inside me…”
“Bucky…”  Steve extricated himself from Bucky and tumbled onto the floor.  He pushed himself up and ran towards the elevator.
Sam removed his pack and goggles and placed them to the side.  They approached slowly.
“Does it matter?  We all wanted a more compliant slave, and now we have one.”  Loki smirked.  “Unless you like the ones who still have a bit of fight in them.  Believe me, it grew tiresome.”
“He dropped it for now when I explained for the millionth time, that our dear captain needs some R & R and that he’d find it in Asgard.”
He grunted a hello.
“Which parts?”
Looking sheepish for a moment, Clint turned to Loki.  The dark haired Asgardian was sitting on his brother’s lap, moaning as Thor stroked his hard cock.  “Lokes, lose the restraints.  I don’t think he’s going anywhere.”  Then he looked at Tony.  “Pussy or mouth?”
“Up, boys.”  Thanos said after a few minutes.
After Thor and Loki dressed for the banquet, they surveyed their slave in front of them.
“He was so big, Daddy!  I-I-I c-couldn’t stop him!”
“We expect good behavior from you, Stevie.” Thor began. “Do not embarrass us.”
“Still nothing, Lokes?”  Tony asked.
Steve moaned as his consciousness returned.  His bottom felt cavernous, as if he would never close again.  The pain was immense as he tried to curl into Tony.
“Captain Rogers, welcome to the Raft.”
“Hello, Finna.”  Thor smiled.  He was fond of the mistress that managed their slaves.  They grew up together.  She inherited her prized position from her parents.  She was incredibly capable of her job.  She oversaw obtaining and distributing pleasure slaves for the royal family and the noble class.
Maria and Sharon still had guns trained on Clint and his bow was on the other side of the room.  Sam and Rhodey proceeded to cuff Clint and Tony.  Natasha placed vibranium cuffs on Bucky.  She then attached discs to each of their necks and stepped away from them.  She nodded at Rhodey and Sam to give some space and looked the three dead in the eyes and she pulled something out of her pocket and pressed a button.  Clint, Bucky and Tony all screamed as they fell to their knees.  Because they had no use of their hands, they crumpled to the floor.
Finna led her back to the training areas of the stables.  They entered a room with two slave women restrained to gurneys.  “Now, Stevie.  Let us try again.  I want you to make them release.”  She looked at the nervous petite girl.
“Sweetheart,” Bucky started, “come over to Daddy, honey.”  He watched Steve struggle to slide down the bench and walk over.  “No, baby.  Crawl to Daddy.”
Natasha appeared like she had been slapped across the face as she gazed at Sam.
Natasha’s eyes watered as she whispered, “Steve…”  Guilt coursed through her as they were unable to save him from Thanos’ clutches and that the two sacrificed themselves for the team.
“Like what?”  Bucky asked.
“I’m getting a towel to clean us off, sweetheart.”  He quickly retrieved one and wiped them both down.  He gathered Steve in his arms.  “You did so well.”  Steve buried himself in Tony’s smooth chest.
“Y-Yes, Mistress.”  Stevie responded, trying not to shake in fear.  She scrambled into the chair.
Thank you for kudos and comments. It really fuels me and inspires my writing!
“That is so fucking hot…”  Clint moaned out as he stroked his cock.
“I will call you anything I want, boy.”  Thanos spat out.  It took a moment, but his demeanor calmed.  “I am impressed by your genius.”
“What’s on his wrists?”
“N-No…”  Steve choked out.
“Wow…the B team.  That’s…kind of sad.”  Tony switched over to speaker so Bucky and Clint could hear the rest of the call.
Bucky flopped down onto the bed; he felt boneless after having the best blow job in his life.
Steve nodded and tried to control his breathing.  “I’m sorry.”
“AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!”  Steve shook involuntarily as her orgasm flowed through her.  She panted as she tried to calm her breathing.  Her body was floating as she slumped back against Finna.
He rested his cock against Steve’s entrance.  He pushed a few times causing Steve to cry out.  “Bucky, stop…please…please.”  Not responding, Bucky shoved his dick inside causing Steve to scream out so loud it may have been heard throughout the Tower.
Bucky stood.  “How will we know when they can come back?”
“No, you won’t.”  Bucky replied bluntly, surprising even Steve.  He was so used to Bucky being more optimistic when it came to him.
She nodded.
“Yes, it is.”  He smiled at Thor and then tasked himself with making a plate of food.  He walked around to where Steve knelt, dejected and motionless for the time being.  He placed the plate down.  “Go ahead, Stevie.  You have ten minutes.”  When the former super soldier did not move, Bucky bent down to his level.  “Are you going to make Daddy repeat himself?”  He asked in a menacing tone.  Steve immediately grabbed the plate.
Finna grabbed Stevie’s chin as she wiped the tears cascading down her face.  “This is what occurs to bad slaves, child.  The only reason why she is not dead is because I have modified her body enough to be able to handle the monster cock.”  She smiled as the creature finished inside her and was dragged away by a guard, only to have a male slave thrown in there next.  The man tried in vain to run from the Minotaur.  You could see him banging on the glass, begging for respite, but to no avail.  The monster found his anus and thrust inside the man.  One could see the outline of its cock in the man’s torso.
With the two secure in the ship, Steve and Tony walked until they were side by side and facing the others.
“Don’t try my patience, Stark.  You will not like it if you do.”  His eyes narrowed.
“Love your mouth, my precious baby boy.”  They continued for a time, but eventually, Thanos pulled Steve off.  He gently laid him on the bed and grabbed the lube.  “Show me your hole, Little One.”  Steve spread his legs and grasped his cheeks.  Thanos salivated at his pink rosette.  He prepped his with a few fingers and then finally slid in.  Steve cried out, “Daddy!” as he accommodated the stretch.  Thanos thrust in and out and it was an incredible feeling for both of them.  As Steve neared his completion he grabbed his cock, but Thanos spoke.  “No, precious.  You cum on my cock alone.”
Thor and Loki shared a look and smiled.
“I don’t want to hear it, Stevie.  You’ve been an awfully bad girl and perhaps some time with the chair will give you some to time to think.”  He motioned down with a sharp nod of his head.  All Stevie could do was lower herself down on the stiff cock in the middle of the booster like seat.  As she got fully to her knees, she cried out at the pain of the fake cock inside her.
“And why should I let you, Hawkass?”
“Leave me alone, Bucky!  You’re scaring me.”  His eyes were wide with fear as Bucky stood in front of him, towering over his petite figure.
“Yes, Daddy.”
“Yeah.”  He choked out as Steve helped him up.  They shared a look and both knew they were powerless against this madman.  Steve turned to face Thanos.  A tear escaped his eyes as he tried to steady his shaking hands as he slipped his shirt off.  He kept his head down as his hands hovered at his waistband.  He slipped the pants off and suddenly stood naked in front of both Tony and Thanos.  His body blushed as he used his hands to cover up his hairless genitals.  Thanos said nothing for a time as he admired the man in front of him.  Tony was trembling with anger as he felt paralyzed to help Steve.
His right ankle was only mildly irritated indicating that Steve tried to no avail to wrestle away from the restraints.  Bucky chose to ignore that for the time being as he leaned down to undo the cuff.  Hopefully Stevie was not idiotic enough to try to escape again.  He picked up the naked former Avenger and carried him towards the others.
“Agni.”  Thor smiled.  “How fair thee?”
“NO!  Daddy…h-he d-did it…I couldn’t s-s-s-top him.  I-I-I told him you s-s-said he couldn’t!”
Steve forced himself to find his voice.  “We tried to stop him.   We…Wanda had to kill Vision to destroy the stone.”  Tony stood there stunned at the admission, but understanding why it had to be done.  His heart ached for Wanda and Vision.  “But…he…” Steve’s eyes flickered over to Thanos briefly, “used the stones and turned back time to right before.  He ripped it from his head.”  Steve’s lips trembled as he tried to reign in his emotions.
“Come here, baby.”  Bucky reached over and picked him up and lowered him onto his hard waiting cock. Steve cried out at the stretch, despite the fact he had just cum.  His walls tried to reject the rod inside, but Bucky would not allow it.  “Look at me, Stevie.”  He commanded.
“There is a reversal that is quite simple, really.”
Steve knelt under the table, trying to accommodate the wide girth of the god of Thunder. It stretched his little mouth that he could almost feel the sides tearing. He could not help the tears that fell…the helplessness of the situation. He could not ignore the feel of it inside him and the smell.
He reluctantly had JARVIS order him more properly fitting clothes after the first week when he did not turn back.  He could no longer walk around in clothes that fell off him.  He ordered them a few sizes too big because he did not feel comfortable in form fitting clothes like Natasha wore.
“Still working my Little Genius?”  Thanos said as he walked in to check on Tony.
“Good boy.”  Rumlow said as he released the pressure on his neck.  “Not so strong when you don’t have your super soldier serum anymore are you?”  He smirked.  “Westfahl?  You ready?”
“Of course it hurts, baby.  You were a naughty girl, so you didn’t deserve any slick to help.”
If there is anything you would like to see happen to our poor Stevie, I am always open to ideas!
Tony raised a finger.  “Few logistics.  We don’t want to have any bambinos running around if that’s even possible in his changed state.  If Bruce were here, I’d have him take care of that.”
“Good, girl.” Bucky said, pleased to see Steve obeying.  “You are being so good, honey.  That makes Daddy very happy.  Climb up, baby.”  Bucky helped Steve up and he lowered him on his cock.  His unprepared front channel causing him to wince at the friction.  Bucky said nothing as he caressed and pinched his nipples.  He fondled him for a few minutes, his hard cock continuing to grow inside him.  Finally he leaned back, and turned to Tony.  “So, what do have planned for our little vacation?”
“No…”  Steve whispered as she looked around and tried to break her bonds.  She gasped at the touch of the warm tongue on her core.  The woman attacked her clit vigorously.
…the Captain of America…”
When they were finished with breakfast, they spent a casual day at the beach and by the pool.  On the deck of the pool, in the shade, Tony placed her on a padded bench on her belly.  She was strapped in.  When the need struck them, they would go to her and fuck her holes, sometimes two at a time.  They gave her water and food when they needed to.  It felt amazing to be able to be serviced when they wanted it.  They enjoyed this docile version of their Stevie.  She was entirely focused on their pleasure.  Her holes felt amazing and her cock sucking was the best they’d ever had.  They created the perfect slave.
After some time, Tony forced himself up.  The suns descended in a beautiful array of colors and the moons now shone bright.  “Come on.”  Tony held his hand out to Steve who complied.  They were not sure where Thanos was in the home and for now Tony didn’t care.  He walked them to their room and turned down the sheets.  He climbed into one of the beds and Steve followed suit.  While saying nothing, Tony held out his arms and gathered Steve into his arms.  The younger man was shaking as he snaked his arms tightly around Tony.  It took some time but the two eventually fell asleep.
He could tell when the sensation switched for Steve because his neck went back and he moaned in such a dirty manner, Tony almost came right then and there.
“I know.  I’m so sorry I couldn’t stop it.”
As the barrier dissipated, Peter ran over to Tony and jumped in his arms.  Even though he was now in his twenties, he clung to him like a little boy lost.
“Yes, Mistress.”
As they grew tired and Steve was barely conscious, Volstaag took one last turn in her ass.  By now, it was nearly gaping from all the use it endured.  Loki assured them by the next day, she would be virgin tight in her cunt and ass.  As he ejaculated one last time inside her, he moaned in relief as the last of his spend came out.  His big body looked down at the still frightened face of the slave.  Instead of pulling out, he turned to Thor.  “May I relieve myself, your highness?”
“Thought about it.”  He looked at Loki. “Is the spell reversible?”
Steve sat in his suite, charcoal in hand sketching the skyline.  As he had done during this trying time, he hid in his room.  He was embarrassed by his change.  Not only did he look like a woman, but he could feel the serum was lessened as well.  While not fully gone, his strength was definitely diminished.  He was grateful to not be plagued with his previous aliments, but his shield was too heavy to properly use it.  He knew he could probably adjust…after all Natasha was an Avenger too, but to not be able to contribute in his usual capacity was almost too much to bear.  After the group initially had their laughs, Tony and Clint especially, the gravity of the situation hit him.  Three weeks later, they were no closer to a reversal.
Steve’s eyes shot open as he gasped.  He took another step back.  “No!”  He replied emphatically as his breathing picked up.  Panicked eyes looked again to Tony.
“I’m Daddy’s little girl.”  Steve whispered as he tried to avert his eyes.
“Y-Yes, Daddy.”  She whispered as she teared.
Steve kept his head down as he refused to look at the man he didn’t know anymore.  Bucky used his metal hand to raise his head.  He gently wiped the tears that were still falling.
When she returned, Steve was huddled in the corner.  The guard informed her that she did not meet her timed goals on any of the other slaves.  Finna knew this.  She was watching on the monitors, plus she chose her three slaves that were modified to not feel pleasure.  She did not want Steve to succeed.  She simply needed her to start to learn the technique.  She did not need to be rewarded yet.
Clint, Thor, and Loki were in the penthouse when they arrived and dressed in their comfortable robes.  Clint’s was embossed with a bow and arrow, Thor’s with his hammer and Loki’s horns.
The younger brother smirked as he lifted the golden rope and followed Thor.  They reached their destination after some time.  Two royal guards were posted on each side of the entrance to the room.  They bowed to the princes and opened the door.  The ancient entryway was over 30 feet tall.  The brothers stepped inside, and Steve had no choice to follow.  In the distance sat King Odin on his gigantic golden throne.  He was an intimidating figure as they approached.  The walkway was lined with Imperial soldiers guarding their King.  There were at least fifty of them.  They all bowed in succession as the brothers passed.
Thank you for all the comments and kudos for this fic!
The guard grabbed the leash and began leading her away.
“Of course, Thor.”  Tony led him out and to a guest room.
Barton was perplexed as he sat in the prison bus.  He saw the sign for a federal prison of California 5 miles ahead.  He had attempted to garner information but was given none thus far.  He was only told that he was being moved.
“Oh, Steve…you are doing so well…”  Tony tried his best not to choke him or go faster than he could accommodate.  He was moved back and forth inside the warm heat.  “Oh…Oh…I’m going to cum…”  Tony moaned as he started to withdraw from the welcoming mouth.  It was embarrassing how soon he needed to climax.
The next day, Bucky let Stevie stay in bed, restrained at the ankle, after she woke him up with an amazing blowjob.  Tony, Clint and Bucky were preparing breakfast when Tony turned towards the elevator.
“Each new day the Captain can be returned to a state of purity.”
As they disembarked the plane at the private airport, Clint, Tony and Bucky held light conversation.  Their luggage was removed by a valet and they made their way towards their transportation.  Steve said nothing, his right hand was held in the metal one of Bucky’s; the hold was tight…a warning not to try anything ill-advised.  They approached a blacked out Suburban.  The driver, a tall intimidating man with a scar on his face, standing by the car removed his glasses as they approached.
, honey?”  Bucky replied in a tight tone.
“The Maw.”  He paused.  “How did he do it?”
“Thank you, Captain Rogers for discussing your ordeal with us.  We can hope that others are inspired to come forward to heal and demand justice.”  She turned to the camera.  “This is Christine Everheart for WHIH.”
“In due time, Anthony.  You will have to trust me.”
“Fuck…fuck….FUCK!!!!!”  Clint exclaimed as he thrust one more time so hard that the only reason Steve didn’t move was the iron grip he had on the back of his neck.  When he felt empty, Clint stepped back, wiping sweat from his brow.  He was slightly unsteady from the intensity of his orgasm combined with the beer he drank so far.  “Not sure what’s better: her pussy or her back door.”
?”  He tilted his head in his direction.  “Didn’t you jack off to posters of Captain America when you were a snot nosed teenage little shit?”
“Do you feel my hand, Stevie?  Does it feel good?”
“Y-Yes, D-Daddy.”  Steve responded.
Less than a second later, something clicked. Tony was speeding towards the clouds, higher than he’d ever flown before.
He did his best not to fly too fast; he didn’t want to miss Tony if he was somewhere in the wooded area—but if he
He twisted and turned in Tony’s grip, shouting in surprise. “Who are you? Let me go!” he roared, looking up towards Tony’s masked face as they flew towards Pyra. “Put me down!”
Rhodey grinned easily at Tony as he crouched down in front of his friend. “I guess it’s been a minute.”
She shook her head slowly. “Fury threw Tony out centuries ago because he saw Tony as a threat. We all liked Tony. He built things constantly, and a lot of his creations are still here on Olympus—Rhodey’s shoes, Clint’s bow and arrows,
Before they could talk about anything else, Thor approached the two of them in the great hall, with none other than Natasha Romanoff following shortly behind him. Steve tensed automatically, preparing for something similar to his earlier interaction with Clint, but Rhodey nudged him discreetly. “They’re cool. No trouble.” Steve didn’t relax completely, but Rhodey was a better judge of the Olympians than he was, and he was reassured at his words.
Tony was working furiously in the bottom of his volcano, intent of finishing the prototype of his new suit. He knew that he would have to bring the weapons online eventually, but first he wanted to perfect the suit’s flight. Any of the other gods would simply charm the ability to fly onto an inanimate object, but not Tony. He had the ability to create something with his
Steve shifted his weight on his feet, and crossed his arms in front of his chest. He wanted to roll his eyes, but what was left of his self-preservation told him that he’d better not. “There’s not much to tell,” he objected yet again. “He thought that I was a human, and he came flying to my rescue. He took me back to the volcano. I left as soon as the ash cleared. There’s nothing else to tell.”
“What is that?” he demanded, pointing an accusing finger at Tony, who was still recovering from their landing. He was seated against the opposite wall, one leg bent at the knee and the other one sprawled out carelessly. The suit had powered down in their descent, finally giving out, and Tony raised his head to pry the mask off of his face with his hands.
“I’m observant,” she repeated, and Steve grew frustrated with her. She put a hand up to stop any sort of retort from him, companied with a warning glance, and he watched her, waiting for an explanation. “Nothing that I know about Tony from his time on the Mountain has ever lined up with what everyone was saying about him. That he’s a threat, that he wants to bring about the

fight back, but there was no way to stand a chance unless they were all unified against Fury. “What if—” he cut himself off, hesitating for a moment longer. He took a deep breath before continuing. Everyone in the group was staring at him, confused looks on their faces as he whispered the question that no one had ever asked before. “He can’t banish everyone from Olympus. What if we all stood up to him?”
Natasha walked towards him, perching at the foot of the bed. “Of course. Sorry,” she said, crossing her legs daintily, not sounding sorry at all. “Rhodey went to check on Tony and you had to stay  here?”
Clint and Natasha had warned him about Tony before they’d even reached the gates of Olympus, but most of what he knew about the god had come from the townspeople in Athens. He was rumored to be a recluse, hiding away in his volcanic workshop all hours of the day. He’d heard stories of people getting too close to the mountain and being escorted away by Tony’s automatons, and Steve had always recoiled from the thought of the god alone in the bottom of a volcano for eternity.
Fury didn’t miss the challenge in the man’s voice, and he quirked an eyebrow up at him in response. He wasn’t enraged by Steve’s words, but amused, and Steve didn’t like that at all. “I came to tell you that the other Olympians have insisted on a welcoming party for you, tomorrow night. I expect you’ll be there?”
Natasha recognized the taunt in his voice and on his face, but she didn’t react. She stood to leave his room with ease, headed towards the french doors on the opposite side of the bed. With one hand on the door, she looked over her shoulder before opening it, her red hair framing her face, preventing Steve from reading any of the emotions there. “Not everyone here is his enemy, Steve. Or yours. When we have a plan, when there is a way to

down there, and that’s on you.”
of Olympus. I don’t believe any of that, and there are a couple of other Olympians that think that. Thor is one of them.”
Tony crossed his arms over his chest, considering this for a moment. “The most beautiful man on the planet, huh?” he mused, mostly to himself, but Rhodey glanced up at him disapprovingly. He knew he very rarely showed interest in anyone, let alone any of the gods. Most of them steered clear of Tony anyway, by Fury’s orders. But the few mortals that Tony had taken a liking to had shared a common trait; he had a thing for blondes. “What does he look like?” the fire god asked, snapping Rhodey’s attention back to him. Tony had seen the god of love’s temple, but it was hard to know what the man’s distinguishing features were from a ten foot tall marble statue.
Fury stepped closer to Steve, daring him to move backwards again. Steve stood in place this time, anticipating Fury’s power move before he had even made it. “I hope your new quarters are to your liking,” he began, eyeing the bathtub behind Steve. “The Olympians have been looking forward to your arrival.”
Steve Rogers:
Fury turned to leave, already losing interest in the exchange. “You will be there,” he told him, already halfway to the door. He hesitated for a second before leaving altogether, then turned around to face Steve once more. “I did come to set a couple of the ground rules. There is only one rule that I forbid anyone from breaking. Tony Stark is not to set foot on Olympus, and the punishment for breaking that rule is banishment to Tartarus. No exceptions.”
a plan soon. If you don’t get yourself killed first.”
“He’s telling the truth,” Rhodey finally spoke, lifting his head to meet Fury’s startled gaze. “Nick, I go to and from there all the time when you ask me to. I haven’t seen him working on anything; you know I would’ve told you if I had.”
. If he had a godly father, it would make sense that he’d never met him. Fury strictly forbade interaction between godly parents and their demigod children.
again. Tony swelled with pride at the thought of Steve, on Olympus, conversing with the other gods and speaking in hushed tones about Fury. He knew that the thought should worry him more than anything—Steve being so reckless. But he couldn’t help the flush that crept up his neck at the idea—someone else was on Olympus looking out for him.
Fury left without another word, leaving Steve to stand alone in his new bathroom. His hands were still clutching his tunic around his waist, and, finally alone, he dropped his clothes to the floor. He turned the faucet and found that the bathtub was charmed, and it was filled to the rim with steaming water before he could turn the nozzle the whole way. He cut the water and slid into the tub, his eyes drifting shut as the hot water caressed his bare skin. His thoughts lingered on Fury’s final instructions: No Tony Stark, no matter what.
Steve Rogers:
Steve scoffed in disbelief, but he knew that this was an opportunity in disguise. All he needed to do was make some friends, and lucky for him, they were still throwing him a welcome party. The Olympians loved a reason to celebrate, even if there was contention among them.
Thor laughed heartily, and his energy was contagious. Natasha, who had followed the sea god to join them, was smiling as she watched him speak, and Steve felt himself loosen up a little bit as well. Rhodey was already at ease to Steve’s left side, and Steve suddenly felt silly for being on his guard automatically.
“It’s been six weeks, but who’s counting?” Tony asked, sounding sharper than he meant to. Standing up, he wiped his hands on his chiton, the harsh black of the grease staining the fabric. He knew it wasn’t Rhodey’s fault that he was alone. It was Fury’s, and Rhodey was only allowed to visit when the Big Man needed something from Tony.
Alright! Enough of the sap.
“Hello, Steve,” Thor greeted, his voice rumbling deep in his chest and a grin spreading from ear to ear with genuine excitement. Steve couldn’t help but notice that this Thor was very different from the Thor he’d seen in the throne room last night—with sad eyes and a somber face. Steve returned a hesitant smile, not because he was nervous, but because he didn’t know whether or not to trust Thor yet.
Rhodey came from where he’d been pressed into the wall, doing his best to stay out of the way. He approached the center of the workshop with caution, his hands raised in a sort of surrender, but the boy didn’t back away. He was terrified, no doubt, but he anchored his feet where he was standing. Every one of his nerve endings was alive with apprehension, and it showed—but the kid refused to move.
But he kept walking, and Clint kept pace with him as he went. “Hey man, you wanna go, I don’t know, spar or something? Get to know each other?” Clint asked, the arrow spinning even faster in his hand now.
He wasn’t prepared for how quickly he plummeted to the ground. In his recklessness, his only thought was ‘What could go wrong?’ —even as he rapidly approached the earth.
i just wanted to put this disclaimer at the beginning in case it makes anyone uncomfortable, but like i said, it has since been reworked and the only warning that i really think is necessary is the character's struggle with anxiety, and i will tag this chapter and the fic accordingly.
Instead, he walked slowly back to his empty room, his sandaled feet dragging as he went. He walked through the cold, white stone house, and the stark contrast that it stood to Prya was overwhelming.  He crawled into his bed, the satin of the blush pink sliding against his skin easily. The bed was cold, and Steve sighed heavily, closing his eyes as his head hit the pillow.
“Come here, kid,” he told him, and Peter glanced up from where he sat on the workbench. Tony waved him closer to the armor, and Peter obeyed, standing so that he could see what the god was fiddling with in the chest piece. Tony had taken the metal off, and he raised the wiring that was in his hands, motioning for Peter to grab them. He hand been tinkering carelessly while he was listening to the boy’s story, more focused on Peter’s words, and the multicolored wires suffered greatly because of it. Peter took the tangled mess of wires from Tony, and he tugged at them without thinking.
Rhodey shook his head sharply, cutting Steve off before he could say anything else. “No, it doesn’t,” he countered. “Don’t say that. I am the only person who had ever been into Pyra until yesterday. You haven’t seen Tony all these years; I have. You don’t want that.”
“I guess he thought that I was one of the Athenians. He thought he was saving someone,” Steve said absentmindedly, recalling the earlier argument between Rhodey and Tony. Tony had come flying at Steve from behind, there was no way he could have recognized him before he grabbed him.
He noticed a larger blonde man, travelling alone in nothing but one piece of fine linen draped over his shoulder and golden sandals strapped around his feet. From the distance, he couldn’t make out any facial features on the man, but his first concern wasn’t recognition—it was his safety. Unlike the other travelers who had been walking around Pyra, this man had none of his belongings, with him, no family members travelling with him. He was completely alone.
It had been almost a week since Pepper left him, and he wanted her back—he wanted her back
Steve glanced over his shoulder once more, aware that they were still surrounded by the other Olympians and minor gods. “Kind of makes me wish Fury had just thrown me out, too.”
He was pounding away at the warm metal in front of him, his bots at his feet ready to help with anything he may need. He needed the shape of this new suit to be perfect; Tony had made his last one a little bit too bulky, throwing the aerodynamics off. Flight had been possible in Mark II, but too difficult. He couldn’t keep too much weight in the air at one time, and being a god meant Tony had plenty of muscle mass that made him the definition of “too much weight.” Not only had the design been slightly imperfect, but Tony had used the suit to come to the defense of the Athenians upon Sparta’s attack. The opposing city-state’s army had been merciless, and without the other Olympians holding off the attack with them, the Athenian’s defense had given way in the first couple of days. Tony had tried to be of more use to them; he lived among them after all. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that had he not been there fighting, the Olympians would have been more inclined to help the mortals in battle.
Going up through the top of the volcano was out of the question, seeing as the volcano had already started spewing lava and ash with Tony’s earlier work. It was like instead of Tony’s body tiring with the labor of forging new creations, his home tired instead, groaning on protest and spraying ash to dissuade him from creating. Rather than going up, Tony headed through the cavern that was his side entrance, flying at highest speed that his old suit would allow. Once outside, he circled the top of the volcano once before he spotted who had tripped the alarm.
The words left his mouth in a whisper, before he scoffed and shook his head, a mirthless smile curving on his lips. Of course Steve had never loved him, they had had nothing but a few encounters and a few shared kisses that made Tony’s hear soar and hurt altogether.
They kept on going like that, just light kisses and smiled, but as all good things, it wasn’t mean to last; soon enough they were interrupted by a little whimper that had both of them looking down at the little one in between them.
Clint wasn’t exactly happy that he had to wear pink underwear for the next month, but he accepted his fate for eating Petey's cookies.
“Then do something” Clint wasn’t good with animals, sure he thought they were okay but he didn’t know how to deal with them and he’d rather stay away from unpredictable forms of life, he got enough of that during his time at the circus and more of that at SHIELD.
